1,JarcRZq4UXoBTZs5o1L1DQ,Xueming J.,3.0 star rating,"I was torn to give 2 or 3 stars, and I finally gave 3 stars since the food tasted authentic korean food. This is a rather small restaurant, it has about 6 or 7 two person table and then a bar typed table along one side of the wall and front windows. We came here for dinner and ordered seafood tofu soup and spicy pork shoulder. The food tasted good, but it is such a small portion. I would say it is a smaller portion than normal lunch menu in other restaurant. Each order comes with a tiny small container of kimchi where in most other restaurant you will get some small side dishes. There is no korean hot tea available either. Parking is available on the street, but usually you can find one within a block or so.",Ahri’s Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$$,Korean
2,AI1rYT1Hu-sIvKxGL0jW_A,Emily J.,3.0 star rating,Review based on Seamless order. I opted for the Bulgogi Soondubu (Tofu Stew) because it was recommended on Seamless and I wanted something soup-y. I added in udon for an extra dollar bc why not? Some of the udon came in a separate container. Still not sure why they didn't just put all the udon in a different container so by the time it's delivered it's not smushy. Whatevs. The broth is oily but soup overall is not bad. I wish they added in more tofu though bc it is tofu stew. The tofu comes in huge chunks and the kimchi inside the stew is a bit bland and mushy. Overall not worth the $14.99 + but if you're totally whatevs on Korean food you'll probably like it.,Ahri’s Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$$,Korean

I hope no one eats here and mistakenly believe this is what authentic Korean tastes like.. Authentic Korean food tastes much much better than the food served here. I ordered the seafood soondubu and the spicy pork shoulder dupbop. I am suspecting that the meat selections of the menu are better because it is harder for meat to taste bad. It is pretty spicy so be mindful. The seafood soondubu was the worst soondubu I've ever had.. I usually eat most of my food even if it doesn't meet my expectations but it tasted so bland and watered down that I literally couldn't eat more than two bites. It was basically red water with seafood inside. I was sad that the restaurant claimed to serve ""authentic Korean"" so that some may believe this is how authentic Korean actually taste.

The aesthetic of this place is very laid back and it's the perfect addition to restaurants in Jersey City. The workers there are also always so friendly and very helpful. When I go there I normally always got the Tofu Bibim Rice since it's the perfect amount of veggies, carb, and protein in one bowl. As with any Korean restaurant, eating it there is a better experience because it comes served in the hot bowl which makes the edges of your rice very crunchy. They also have different ways you can make your meal healthier and offer brown rice options as well as a mini version of the full bibim rice. The restaurant itself is focused on simple and healthy food. I've also ordered their Korean Ramen before which was pretty standard in terms of ramen. I liked the fresh vegetables in there, but not something I'm dying to order again. There's still so much more of the menu that I'm excited to try out, will definitely be going back. Make sure to try out their homemade special sauce! It's AMAZING! I've been a very loyal customer of theirs and they ended up gifting me a free bottle of their special sauce and it's such a perfect blend of soy sauce, sesame oil/sauce, sesame seeds, maybe even a hint of peanut sauce.

It really makes me question choosing where to eat based off of businesses' stars now.So on a lazy night at home, I decided to try ordering food from somewhere new and different. I came upon Ahri's Kitchen for Korean food and it had, as I mentioned, 4 stars. I got excited and ordered for delivery immediately! I was told that delivery would take roughly an hour, but I was happily greeted with my food within 20-30 minutes! The very shortened delivery time was probably the ONLY saving grace.I ordered the Bulgogi Dupbop and was craving for the sweet and slightly salty taste on pieces of beef to be countered with soft white rice. Instead it was a tasteless bowl of food with a bad vegetable to meat ratio. Plus the meat seemed pretty low quality. My tastebuds and my stomach were so disappointed, the same also goes for the side of the short ribs that I ordered. That was better than the bulgogi, but that does not say very much.

Not a bad place for Korean food but it wouldn't be my go-to place. The gimbop's rice was very dry and chewing it was a little tough. The seafood jeon was probably my favorite, the thickness was just right and it wasn't overly salty and the sauce that it was paired with complimented it so well (I have no idea what what in that sauce but it was good). I also got the bulgogi tofu stew, the broth was a little thinner than I would've expected but the flavor was good, tofu was soft and silky, the meat was also a little dry, but if you dunk it in the soup long enough it makes it a little easier to chew. My cousin got the pork shoulder cooked with red chili peppers and vegetables, over sticky rice. Pork shoulder was done a lot better than the bulgogi.Not too bad for what it is, cute interior, great place to stop by for something quick, not as cheap as you would expect it to be.",Ahri’s Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$$,Korean

We got the Bibimbap and the Seafood Soondubu, the Bibimbap was large and well presented and served it's purpose (but nothing more) however... the stew tasted sooo watered down, tasted like hot water mixed with ""eau de mer"". The girls working there were very sweet, but for the price I would rather just take my money and pay 2.75 for the path and get some better food in K-Town.

This dish need to be mixed with Korean style spicy sauce & we can adjust the spicy level when mixing. The tip is that don't it the rice when it's just served.

63,pz3Ulbuk7ZiUUbT7oFzmpA,Lori L.,3.0 star rating,"As a resident of Jersey City and lover of all Asian cuisines, I was delighted to hear that Ahri's Kitchen had opened up in the Hamilton Park area earlier this year. The restaurant is family owned and operated, and aptly named after the couple's daughter; after moving to Jersey City from Manhattan, the dearth of good Korean restaurants in the neighborhood spurred owners (Aena and Andrew) to launch a venture of their own.The restaurant is simple and welcoming, with a bright, well-windowed interior that consists mostly of two tops and a few four-tops that are better suited for families. Orders are taken at the counter, which is also where their menu is printed against the back wall. You'll find an array of comforting and well-known Korean dishes, spanning a handful of appetizers, kimbap (rice rolls), bimbimbap (rice bowls), jigaes (stews), and noodles. My friends and I took a few minutes to decide on our orders, but our server was helpful in clarifying some of the dishes.We started with the ""Seafood Fritters"", which is better known as the Haemul Pajeon - a crisp pancake-like appetizer that's cooked with various vegetables and seafood. Ahri's was filled with scallions, carrots, calamari, and mussels and although the portion was on the smaller side, it was well seasoned, crispy, and not overly greasy. Take advantage of the vinegar dipping sauce on the side as the acidity cuts through the slight oiliness of the pajeon without being too overpowering.My main dish was the Spicy Pork Shoulder Rice Bowl, or Jeyuk Dubap. It's a dish that consists of stir-fried pork shoulder cooked with various vegetables, including chili peppers, carrots, cabbage, and onion, in a slightly sweet chili pepper sauce known as Gochujang over a helping of sticky rice. I have to say that this dish disappointed me as the sauce was too cloying and sweet for my tastes, and the ratio of it to the rice was far too generous to the former. I missed the punch of spice that's often present in many Korean dishes as well, and while the ingredients used were well-cooked and fresh, the taste of it was lost in the copious and heavy sauce.I'd certainly give Ahri's Kitchen another chance as it isn't entirely fair to give a final judgement to a venue based on one lone experience... But for the time being, I'll make my way to Manhattan's K-town for my Korean fix.",Ahri’s Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$$,Korean

On top of the frustratingly late delivery, the food was just average. We ordered:Grilled Beef Short Rib - it was good, but the portion was small and not worth the $18 price. Bibim Rice with Pork - the pork was average and I wish there were more vegetable in the dish.

74,4xL0mGNr06yP-AqwWjawvw,Jessica L.,4.0 star rating,"I had a sample of Ahri's during the Jersey City winter market. Even in the pouring rain we went both days for the bulgogi. Flash forward like 6 months they have finally had the storefront all set up. Their menu is small but inclusive including a few appetizers, some rice rolls and a mixture of rice and noodle dishes. They sell canned sodas and bottled water and are still BYOB... but no tap water?! Im not sure about that one. I was over the moon when I saw that they had grilled beef short ribs served on rice. A bit pricey at $18 but it was sure a healthy portion, you get about 3 meaty short ribs that they have generously cut up for you. The meat was seasoned well and grilled to perfection. Not gonna lie I may be drooling just a bit as I am typing this up. If you have not tried the cold mustard noodle, then you are missing out on life. It is a buckwheat noodle dish submerged in a cold sweet beef broth with a slight tartness topped with freshly sliced cucumbers and carrots topped off with an egg and a bit of mustard. There are a lot of different textures going on in the dish and the cold noodles does a great job of maintaining them for the life of the dish. Not being a mustard fan myself I found the mustard a bit overpowering, I will make sure to ask for it on the side next time. While their rice rolls sound like a great idea, I was bit disappointed with the marinated sirloin rice roll. Think sushi but with marinated beef and assorted vegetables. Again, concept is great but the meat tasted a bit dry and lacking of flavor causing the entire bit to just taste off. Something that is missing at Ahri's is the generous variety of side dishes, but understanding it is a smaller family run restaurant they do compensate with a small portion of kimchee and soup with every meal. Staff here is great and they are always willing to answer questions and provide their personal recommendations.

Almost too hot to eat!  There was soft tofu in the soup, not the standard silken tofu that I've come to expect, but that wasn't that big a deal to me.  I was more caught off guard by the seafood that likely came from a frozen mix.  Also, the soup itself was kind of oily and not as thick as I like it.  There was a strong flavor though, and the spice kept hitting the back of my throat!",Ahri’s Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$$,Korean

The main reason that keeps us from going back often is that the prices are a bit high for what you get.

Holy crap was that good. The dumplings are perfect to share as well.$80 for four people after tax and gratuity. WHAT A DEAL!!!!If you want BYOB in Jersey City, skip Broa and come to Ahri's. It's a great decision.",Ahri’s Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$$,Korean

It's a cozy little spot that oozes the local vibe in the best way.  It's delicious Korean that is also BYOB.  They have few drinks you can purchase and tap water that is self serve.  The menu is simple with a few choices where it will only take a few extra minutes to deliberate over what choose - but if you are undecided the staff there can lead you down the right path. We've had sit down and take out and the wait is never too long - but the wait for the amazing fresh - made to order food is worth it. The Bibimbap is amazing and the pork shoulder .... and  the kimchi fried rice.  With most items you get extra sides of kimchi - but make sure to ask for some just in case - it's so good. Ahri's is  only getting 4 stars because I've only sampled a few items on the menu - but imagine it's all five star quality.,Ahri’s Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$$,Korean

However, I find this place to be very disappointing for quality and quantity. The appetizers I had were the dumplings and the kimchi and seafoods fritters. The dumplings were tasteless and the felt like I could brought them from a supermarket. The fritters were fine, but I founded to be very oily.As for the entrees, the Bebimbap special, the egg was over cooked for my taste. The Bulgogi rice the meat was very juicy and flavorful and I give my compliments to the chef. Unfortunately, I had to withdrawn my compliment back for the horrendous dish the chef made called pork shoulder over rice. The dish felt like it was just spicy ketchup mixed with the pork and the rice, I personally expected more from this establishment. Personally I favorite dish was the seafood tofu soup also called soodoonboo. It had a wonderful flavorful broth with shrimp amd oysters, but it way too expensive for the quantity of it, $13. Overall, it is a nice place to to grab a bite, but I will probably won't come here again.",Ahri’s Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$$,Korean

That tuna roll was a nine-piece log of nori wrapped around shredded spicy tuna with perilla leaf and...some kind of squash? It was tasty and satisfying. The pork shoulder, marinated in soy, sesame, and chili was served over sticky rice with cabbage, scallion, and a few other veggies. While the meat was tender and the rice well cooked, the dish seemed a bit muted and could've benefited from a bit more chili.All in all, a very welcome addition to the neighborhood and arguably the only 'traditional' Korean joint downtown (to take nothing away from Kraverie or Bon Chon)",Ahri’s Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$$,Korean

Service: it was self serve, had to go up to the cashier and order. She was very friendly and sweet! Place: nothing fancy but I liked the simplicity of the place. It was comfortable and quiet which allowed me to talk to my boyfriend and focus on my dish. There are 2 group tables, four couple tables, and 4 single window seats. The place filled up super fast! Food: I couldn't help but try the pork shoulder bowl as all the yelpers are raving about it. My boyfriend ordered the kimchi tofu stew. We also got an order of the kimchi fritters. I got to taste everything because me and my boyfriend ate half of each other's meals. The pork shoulder was so full of flavor and definitely comparable to koreantown's bbq! The stew was alright. It was my boyfriends favorite but I personally enjoyed the pork shoulder more. The stew Had a ton of seafood in it and the broth was hardly spicy. Luckily, the place provides us with extra kimchi when we want it so I threw in two containers of the kimchi and the broth was perfect! The kimchi fritters were amazing and the sauce was mouth wateringly phenomenal! Went so well with the crispy fritters!All in all I am so glad this traditional Korean place opened up in the neighborhood and I'm excited to come back to try the bibimbap and bulgoki! Probably won't try the stew again as it didn't compare to the flavorful Korean town. I also am saddened that the meals don't come with the traditional side dishes but I am happy that I have a place to go to when I don't feel like taking the path across the river!

But the highlight of the meal arrived, seafood tofu stew. Bland yet overly salty. With a tiny shrimp, gritty oysters, and two pieces of tofu. It has none of the richness and flavor you normally associate with a Korean tofu stew. Too watery, more like spicy salt water. Asked to bring back the dish for an exchange to a different dish... since I have already paid. The waitress/owner brought it back to the kitchen, and then came out said it tastes fine according to themselves...It's supposed to taste like this. Excuse me??!! I've been having real Korean food since I was little...no way! Anyways, refused exchange, said could add more soup to make it less salty. Soup came out. Same awful salty water. At this point, we stopped to care. What is even worse, this is a self service restaurant, so you paid the tips (if you decided to do so) up-front. Ha! My suggestion is to stay away from this place.

140,OQqDy3SwQ8-jqWm4geDvOQ,Lantz A.,4.0 star rating,"So after a gloomy start of the day and some early precipitation, the skies cleared and it was time for lunch. Initially my friends and I were headed to get some Vietnamese food, but someone mentioned this new Korean spot called Ahri's Kitchen!...Ummmmm, Holy Finds Batman!  This is a great spot! The decor is simple and what I'd call ""modern rustic chic""....you know that look where you don't know if your in an old cabin or a banana republic....you know it's kind of saloon like but it's too clean for that, and Martha Stewart might show up out of no where...well someone will know what I mean!  First of all, their simple method of customers ordering food and paying before they sit down but still providing table service was so cool. It also eliminates that process of determining who among your friends has the best accounting skills!  As for the food...totally frick'n bangin' and plentiful!They start you off with a small and delicious complimentary clear broth soup with herbs and seaweed. Ahri's definitely likes to garnish with seaweed as I noticed it was used on most of the entrées. I ordered the Bulgogi Roll ($8.00) which is thinly sliced rib eye marinated in soy sauce, sesame oil, black pepper, garlic, onions, and ginger, rolled with cucumber, carrot, picked dikon, rice , sesame oil, with sesame seeds on the top. This was the largest roll I've ever had and it was delicious. Usually you order a roll for 8 bucks somewhere and it's not enough for a meal (at least for my appetite!), Well that's not the case at Ahri's! Plentiful!   Thinking that I'd get the standard sized roll, I also ordered their Korean Ramen ($8.00) which is noodles with fresh vegetables and a cracked egg. This dish was very tasty, plentiful, and crying for a cool fall day or frosty winter one!  I really like Ahry's Kitchen! It's a great meal and deal,  and it's great for Jersey City. I will need to try more food to give them 5 stars. Until then it's a solid 4 to 4.5!",Ahri’s Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$$,Korean

147,lLPJkTOgrEinzDQnkLBkyw,cory b.,3.0 star rating,"This would be a 5-star,but they've got quite a few things to work out regarding running a restaurant in general. First of all, the food is great. The kiwi marinated short ribs are phenomenal (no taste of kiwi, but delicious regardless). The bibimbap had a great mix of all the usual, the chicken dumplings were very tasty, and the seafood fritter was a bit too oily, but still very tasty.On to the bad. No service. They're nice enough, but if you're dropping $40 or 50 bucks on a couple of people, you can bring the food to one of the 7 tables. Secondly, they haven't worked out all of the kinks. When we're bringing in a 6-year old, actual silverware like a spoon and not chopsticks would be nice and shouldn't be something that should be requested. Especially when we have soup. Again, having to get up to ask for a fork and spoon is amateur hour, even if it is a cafeteria style service.We shouldn't have to ask for napkins either. Or a cup for the kid to drink out of. Or plates to share the food around. Secondly, you don't serve tap water? Seriously? Can an eatery actually not serve tap water upon request? Some locales actually have legitimate laws on the books against that. Legality aside, it's honestly kind of insulting. You have glasses. You obviously have water. Ship it over.I don't have a problem with the price or the portions, the food was great, but I can't give more than 3 stars on this initial review to a place I'd love to give 5 to. I know the owners are new to this industry, so hopefully they work out the kinks and make the place a bit more receptive and welcoming.

It's difficult to find one unless you don't mind driving up to Bergen County. But now, I don't have to drive any more than 5 minutes to Ahri's kitchen to get some authentic bibimbap or Korean barbecue. First off, the place itself is so welcoming and relaxed. The large windows bring in this nice amount of natural light into the place which is great. The seating is simple and neat. When you get inside, you go up to the counter, take a menu, place your order, have a seat, and wait less than 15 minutes for your food to arrive. I haven't been too adventurous with the menu so far, but for the past three times that I've been here, they have always delivered delicious food consistently. My favorite is the rib eye bibimbap which comes in a nice portion size and always comes in fresh. I have also gotten the  rib eye barbecue which was also great.

154,MkJcY0UysQQ11uEzdec8sA,Magnus M.,3.0 star rating,"After months of teasing, Ahri's Kitchen, a Korean restaurant in Jersey City opened up recently. I decided to drop by. The three star review is the aggregate of my ratings in three categories: food, ambience, and service. The way this restaurant is designed is you order at the counter (no waiter service) from a very nicely crafted menu. The fare is what someone would call typical: bimbimbop, or rice dishes topped with meat, Kimbop, described here as Rice rolls, and cold noodles soup for the summer. I appreciate a nice small menu as it can be a sign of good quality control. I ordered the Seafood Fritters, or for people who know Korean food well, the seafood pajeon ($6) as my starter. And for the main, I had the spicy pork shoulder rice bowl ($12). I waited approximately 10 minutes for the pajeon to come out. Normally, that's quite a long wait for pajeon. I figured it was all homemade and takes time. The lovely manager (owner?) called my ticket number. Assuming that my order was complete, I got up from my seat, then fetched the pajeon without the bowl. Sort of odd. You'd think that the chef would time it so that the whole order is complete. Nothing worse than relaxing at your table only to get up numerous times for one order. I wondered, therfore, if I was with a friend, and we ordered several items, if it would translate to a lot of counter calisthenics to and fro. It's also unwieldy to bring back two trays back to your already small table. I don't understand why they cannot consolidate the order into one tray. I do understand that in a proper restaurant, you order your starter and that comes first. In Ahri's case, you have to get your starter and bring it back to your table in a tray. Then, as your mains are ready, you get up again to fetch the second tray. Resulting in two trays on a small table. The couple next to me had the similar awkward discussion on how to deal with the second tray. The pajeon was very tasty and the sauce it came with was not the traditional sauce that accompanies this savory ""pancake"". It was still quote lovely with sesame flavored accents. One major (big) disappointment was that the pajeon was extremely oily and soggy. Pajeon should be very crisp, with a mildly moist center. This one was delectable in taste, but soggy in consistency. The spicy pork dish was very nice. It was seasoned well and not overly drenched in the spicy sauce. I'd say the spice level is medium, and very tolerable for people who find Indian food spicy. You can tell that the ingredients were so fresh. This is the kind of quality that you get when visiting someone's home. Fresh, quality vegetables, moist pork, and rice cooked perfectly. It comes with a small container of kimchee which was very nice as well. Not overly fermented and not too spicy. Fresh and cool. The rice bowl also comes with a small bowl of hot Korean broth which usually accompanies rice dishes nicely. For me, I found the broth too salty, however. Usually the broth should be somewhat on the bland side to compliment the savory rice bowl. Ambience. It's such a cute, quaint restaurant nestled on a corner in a darling part of Jersey city. Really charming exterior and lovely, and arguably, spartan interiors. Little to no clutter. Two shortcomings however when it comes to overall experience. They have, what appears to be one CD or playlist playing only Edith Piaf. That's it. The whole hour experience was Edith. Don't get me wrong, I adore early jazz from the 20s to the 40s, but having only Edith playing throughout the evening is tiresome. Especially since the vocal timbre of her voice is very ""unique"", it gets fatiguing. And remember how I mentioned that orders come piecemeal (no pun there)? Well, you know you're order is up when your number is called. And despite the lovely and professional front staff, having Edith blaring and for staff to announce order  numbers out loud, the cacophony is distracting. It feels, looks like, and even is a sit down restaurant, but it feels like a bit of a fast food joint where order numbers are constantly being shouted out. There were on several occasions, that a table of four friends were getting up and sitting down at various stages of the evening to fetch their food when their numbers were called for everyone to hear. Not so fun. SUMMARY: FOUR stars for the food. Fresh, delicious, and homemade. Not perfect because of the shockingly soggy oily drenched pajeon and salty broth.THREE stars for the ambience. Despite its uber charming interiors and exteriors, the Edith Piaf and shouting of orders combination totally destroys the image I assume they are trying to replicate: charming Parisienne. I've had my lifetime fulfillment quaota of ""La vie en rose"". FOUR stars for the charming and professional staff. It's not their fault if they have to announce every. single. order. I'll definitely come back if just for the food the menu looks exquisitely simple a d delicious.",Ahri’s Kitchen,4.0 star rating,$$,Korean

Both times the food was prepared very quickly. I've had the beef bibimbap, kimchi pancake, and the seafood dukbap. Unfortunately all three weren't too great. The bibimbap was very salty, especially the spinach. The kimchi pancake was overdone, the sides were a bit burnt. The seafood dukbap was the most disappointing. It was extremely bland.

David Chang's style is tasty, but at the end of the day, even David Chang just wants a bowl of noodles with perfectly pickled kimchi. That's Ahri's Kitchen's sweet spot. They are not trying to mess with mutli generation-tested recipes. Their janchi noodles instantly reminded me of my family's Saturday morning meals at home. Simple and light. I also had the seafood fritters, well crisped with an awesome dipping sauce. But my hands-down favorite was the spicy pork shoulder rice bowl. It actually had some kick to it. I tend to avoid ""spicy"" dishes at Korean places because I've noticed that in their attempt to please the western palate, the dishes tend to be more sweet than spicy. But Ahri's Kitchen did this dish justice. A good amount of garlic, gochugaru, chili peppers, and whatever else they added to this mouth-watering dish. Definitely a place to check out.

First, the taste of the first two was satisfactory but I won't be ordering the ramen again. Because the noodles are soaking up all the broth inside the container,  the noodles expand and slightly alter the flavor of the already so-so broth. Lastly, I was a tad bit disappointed with their lack of side dish. It is a Korean tradition to serve some type of side dish when serving the main dish. If they're going to charge the main dish $18, perhaps a side of soup or even a tiny bit of kimchi might accommodate the customers better?

He was rude, unhelpful, condescending and ripped me off by $10. I know I was correct re the $ but boy  did he make me feel unwelcome and wouldn't budge on his take on what went down. Wouldn't it have been smarter of the manager to just give me the 10$ ?  Ordering at the register then sitting down to wait for your food is not my favorite way to dine . No wonder he was grouchy- I'm sure no one tips him and I agree they really shouldn't have to- even if he'd been nice- all he's doing is taking your order. Now I won't go back- can't support some of the management decisions. The customer is always right- ESPECIALLY when you first open and impressions are made.  My mustard noodle dish was wasn't delicious - I found it odd tasting - I had asked the guy for help regarding the menu but he couldn't have cared less about helping me make a decision.
