Parking looks like it could be a hassle but we were able to find one lucky spot around the corner. We waited about fifteen minutes to be seated and it was well worth the wait. ( They will not sit large parties until the whole group is there) We were able to get one of the window booths which had a great view of the water and NY. The menu items all looked delicious.

Food: I had a latte which tasted like watered down brown water, followed by the Popeye skillet. The skillet was drowning in what seemed like water from the boiled spinach? I seriously don't know but my potatoes were soggy; it was also salty. My daughter had the Wilber skillet, which she said was fine except salty as well and a large OJ which fine.

10,nMnMsRYr6NYjEcGybbnA4Q,Rughda B.,2.0 star rating,"Came for brunch on New Years Day with a group of friends. We came during the height of the rush and they didn't have anything left on the menu. That was only the beginning and the most excusable out of all of my problems dining here this day. The waiter seemed embarrassed to inform us first, that almost all of the drinks we ordered were out. We settled instead for pitchers of orange juice, which he warned, would probably run out soon as well. He would keep disappearing to find out answers to our basic menu related questions, such as ""Is the mushroom soup vegetarian?"" It was at this point we realized that the cups on the table were dirty, stained with lip marks. We asked for new cups, and instead of taking our orders and then getting the cups, he disappeared to retrieve cups and made us wait to take our orders down.After finally taking our food orders he returned about ten minutes later to inform us that they were out of chicken completely. We reordered, he read back our orders, we confirmed that he had it down right, and he went off to send it in to the kitchen. We waited for about 25 minutes, and he returned to once again, read back our orders and make sure he had everything right. He asked if he forgot anything. At this point, we were over the brunch completely, and only stayed because we had been there for almost two hours already and hadn't yet gotten our food. A little bit after this, the food starting coming out. They sent me the wrong order, they put bacon on two orders that asked for it without, and they missed one order completely. While waiting for them to get it together, we asked for a side of syrup that was forgotten about until reminded. The missed order didnt get to the table until everyone was done eating, and all 4 of my friends that ordered the waffles said they came out cold.At the end, without us saying anything (I guess they realized they messed up at some point) they ducked off $-9.25 from the bill, and the lowest price meal was $-10.25. The food itself was alright. I've had better at local diners.Not worth the trip.",Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"
11,3liKPNYr8i_6lvrOVGCO6Q,Scott C.,1.0 star rating,"Utter incompetence.  I used to think that the management at this location simply didn't train the employees; I now believe that the employees are affirmatively trained on how to provide the WORST customer service possible in any given situation.After a long hiatus, I decided to give this place another try -- not as a sit-down, dine-in customer, but merely as someone ordering caffeinated beverage to go from the to-go counter.  BIG MISTAKE.I was on my way to work on a Sunday morning, and the plan was to take the ferry immediately after receiving my latte.  Because I knew how poor the service (even behind the drink counter) tends to be, I made sure to allot more than enough time to order, pay, receive my drink, and catch my ferry without breaking a sweat. (For those unfamiliar, the ferry leaves from a location about 60 yards away from the restaurant.)    I enter Turning Point with 8 minutes until my scheduled ferry.  By the 6-minute mark, I've placed my order and the woman behind the counter has swiped and returned my credit card.  Significantly, my order is for a medium latte that requires only the pushing of a single button to fill up a paper cup -- this isn't Starbucks, there's no expectation that drinks be made fresh.  However, as soon as the employee hands me back my credit card, she walks away from the to-go counter without saying a word.          We still have 5 minutes until the ferry, the boat is nowhere in sight, and there's plenty of staff buzzing about the to-go area, so I figure that even Turning Point can't screw this one up.  WRONG. 4 minutes.  The other employee standing behind the counter, who purposefully avoids eye contact with all customers while he answers the phone, has also now vacated the to-go area.  A line grows behind me, full of comments such as ""I don't know why I keep coming back here"" and ""This place is the worst.""  But those commenters are the lucky ones, as they haven't already placed their orders and paid their money.  I, on the other hand, have already paid, and am being held hostage by a business that repeatedly shows its indifference toward its customers.  3 minutes, and I can now see the ferry come into full view.  It has not yet docked in Hoboken, so there's still a decent chance that I can make my ferry ... but, of course, that would require a Turning Point employee to actually show up at the to-go station and press the single button necessary to provide me with the drink that I ordered three minutes earlier.2 minutes, and although a handful of Turning Point employees have passed by, no one has thought to pay any attention to the customers at the to-go station.  Finally, I say something to a server, motion to the ferry, which is now about to dock, and let her know that I placed my order more than four minutes earlier, and that the to-go station has since been abandoned by all Turning Point employees either willing or able to push the single button that stands between me and making the ferry that, with even a modicum of customer service, I would have been outside waiting for 3 minutes earlier.  The waitress that I speak with has the appearance of a dear in the headlights, says nothing, and scurries away toward the dining room.1 minute, and passengers are boarding the ferry.  An employee who I recognize as someone who has worked at this location for a while (might be a manager) finally arrives at the to-go/beverage station, asks me what I ordered, and then pushes the button to pour my beverage.  As the ferry pulls away outside, I tell her about the above, and that I've now missed the ferry that should have been a sure thing, and her only response is: Did you already pay for your drink? I say yes, and she hands me the beverage and says ""Here you go,"" moving on to the next customer, who for some reason waited behind me for all of this time.",Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"

By the time we walked there our table was ready. I got the chicken and waffles me they were amazing... like actually. My parents both got omelette/egg options and I know they enjoyed theirs as well.

Turning Point has a oceanside home vibe too it; homey & comfortable. I believe calling in is allowed (can't make reservations) however I'm not sure how well that's run. Our wait time was about 20 minutes, no complaints there. Be warned that if you're going for the view, there is construction going in front of the restaurant sooo there won't be much of a view for awhile.I love a menu that offers real variety especially in breakfast/ brunch items & this place offers just that. Shy away from the eggs, waffles, pancakes routine & try their flavorful dishes with ingredients like hummus & sautéed mushrooms. Every time I watched a plate be served my mouth was watering (chicken & waffles had me suffering) dish presentation is definitely a ~thing~ here. Ingredients tasted fresh & of high quality. Even more delectable are the low prices. 3 entrees (Cesar chicken wrap, BLT smash (served with hummus), eggs Benedict, 1 pitcher of coffee, 2 large fruit smoothies) = $40. Not bad, worth a visit!

Little hard to say no to a great cup of coffee and tea so we took it.Overall breakfast was great made with fresh ingredients, waitress staff got a little flustered but she was polite enough that we brushed it off.

(For those unfamiliar, the ferry leaves from a location about 60 yards away from the restaurant.)    I enter Turning Point with 8 minutes until my scheduled ferry.  By the 6-minute mark, I've placed my order and the woman behind the counter has swiped and returned my credit card.  Significantly, my order is for a medium latte that requires only the pushing of a single button to fill up a paper cup -- this isn't Starbucks, there's no expectation that drinks be made fresh.  However, as soon as the employee hands me back my credit card, she walks away from the to-go counter without saying a word.          We still have 5 minutes until the ferry, the boat is nowhere in sight, and there's plenty of staff buzzing about the to-go area, so I figure that even Turning Point can't screw this one up.  WRONG. 4 minutes.  The other employee standing behind the counter, who purposefully avoids eye contact with all customers while he answers the phone, has also now vacated the to-go area.  A line grows behind me, full of comments such as ""I don't know why I keep coming back here"" and ""This place is the worst.""  But those commenters are the lucky ones, as they haven't already placed their orders and paid their money.  I, on the other hand, have already paid, and am being held hostage by a business that repeatedly shows its indifference toward its customers.  3 minutes, and I can now see the ferry come into full view.  It has not yet docked in Hoboken, so there's still a decent chance that I can make my ferry ... but, of course, that would require a Turning Point employee to actually show up at the to-go station and press the single button necessary to provide me with the drink that I ordered three minutes earlier.2 minutes, and although a handful of Turning Point employees have passed by, no one has thought to pay any attention to the customers at the to-go station.  Finally, I say something to a server, motion to the ferry, which is now about to dock, and let her know that I placed my order more than four minutes earlier, and that the to-go station has since been abandoned by all Turning Point employees either willing or able to push the single button that stands between me and making the ferry that, with even a modicum of customer service, I would have been outside waiting for 3 minutes earlier.  The waitress that I speak with has the appearance of a dear in the headlights, says nothing, and scurries away toward the dining room.1 minute, and passengers are boarding the ferry.  An employee who I recognize as someone who has worked at this location for a while (might be a manager) finally arrives at the to-go/beverage station, asks me what I ordered, and then pushes the button to pour my beverage.  As the ferry pulls away outside, I tell her about the above, and that I've now missed the ferry that should have been a sure thing, and her only response is: Did you already pay for your drink? I say yes, and she hands me the beverage and says ""Here you go,"" moving on to the next customer, who for some reason waited behind me for all of this time.",Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Our wait time was about 20 minutes, no complaints there. Be warned that if you're going for the view, there is construction going in front of the restaurant sooo there won't be much of a view for awhile.I love a menu that offers real variety especially in breakfast/ brunch items & this place offers just that. Shy away from the eggs, waffles, pancakes routine & try their flavorful dishes with ingredients like hummus & sautéed mushrooms. Every time I watched a plate be served my mouth was watering (chicken & waffles had me suffering) dish presentation is definitely a ~thing~ here. Ingredients tasted fresh & of high quality. Even more delectable are the low prices. 3 entrees (Cesar chicken wrap, BLT smash (served with hummus), eggs Benedict, 1 pitcher of coffee, 2 large fruit smoothies) = $40. Not bad, worth a visit!

If you are vegan, the options are limited...I'm pretty sure they can modify a few items. I ordered the avocado toast and a side bowl of fruit. I know if sounds simple, but it was amazing! The fresh, ripe tomatoes on top of the toast with the fresh cracked black pepper really set it off! The hint of olive oil and lemon really brought the taste of the avocado out. I know that I'm sounding pretty excited over this toast, but trust me, you will too! Everything else was great, the fruit was fresh, the coffee was good...not one complaint during my experience here.

After my friend stood up to ask why this was happening very politely, the host said you are the next table being called, before she proceeded to call yet another group of people. Rude. Make sure you keep bugging them if you do want to eat here so they ignore the list and seat you. Otherwise, turn around and stay hangry.6 months later and I'm still pissed about how this experience ruined my day.

Turning Point was a nice surprise. Enjoyed the low key atmosphere and the food was clearly a higher quality than a sports bar trying to do brunch.

Disclaimer: my review is based on the FOOD. The service can be hit or miss and if you come on the weekend please understand you will most likely be waiting for quite some time so come prepared for that! Also, everyone complaining about reservations  - they don't take reservations! If you call ahead they will note your name so you could wait less but it's not a reservation and you still will probably have to wait! Now about their food - it's delicious! I live for their Kona French Press Coffee though the Costa Rican blend they have is also really good! My favorite dish is the Huevos Rancheros for savory and the Tropical Crunch Waffles for sweet. Though also very good is the Big Easy Benny (and Im not normally a fan of poached eggs), the Corn Bread French Toast, and the Chicken and Waffles (although I get the gravy on the side since it is pretty heavy).Lastly, the view of Manhattan is amazing (though they are doing construction on the street right now which obstructs the view quite a bit).",Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"

There happened to be two empty seats at the bar, so we were able to sit immediately.To start, we shared the OMG French toast (dipped wheat french toast topped with dollops of pumpkin cinnamon mascarpone, toasted pecans, caramel drizzle and chopped Virginia smoked bacon). I was not a huge fan. I couldn't really tasted the mascarpone, and there was very little bacon. I'm also not big on pecans, so maybe that already swayed my opinion from the beginning.For my brunch entree, I decided to go with the Wilbur skillet (two eggs with crushed bacon, potatoes, avocado and diced tomato, then topped with melted Monterey jack cheese). You can choose to cook the eggs anyway you want it. I chose over easy, and the runny yolk went perfectly with the rest of the dish.If I'm ever in the area, I would definitely come back. I would probably choose to sit at the bar again, since that seems to be less of a wait.Tip - free refills on coffee.

Perfect- we had anticipated this.25 minutes later, I go up to the hostess to get the waiting time again. She seemed out of her mind frantic, and told me an ""additional 30 minutes"". With a huge attitude. Girl, I know you're in hell right now but I am NOT the cause. Pinpoint that animosity towards you operations strategist so you two can figure out the reason for your Sunday morning bottleneck.10 minutes later, the three of us get seated. Our other friends are running behind as usual. Different waitresses come on 3 separate occasions to tell us that we cannot hold the table... Something they probably should have mentioned before we were seated? But we finally told them that we could order first for everyone (why were we the first ones to figure out this compromise?).It's worth noting that our actual water was a sweetheart. He brought us everything we needed with a smile. We had brought champagne which they opened for us, and provided us glass flutes.The food was okay at best. Maybe it's because I have my picks of brunch spots in the City, the food was absolutely not worth the 45 minute and the ATTITUDE.I will personally never ever ever come here again. There are TONS of BYOBs in Hoboken, and in the City. Ones with hostesses that won't make you want to strangle them! Ones with better food!

The women told her to call ahead on Saturday instead and there would be no wait, instead of the usual 30-45. When we did that however, a different women said the call ahead puts you on a list, but the wait time starts when you get there. What's the point?! My friend said she was rather rude too. Hostess that day was also not happy or friendly.Still came because the menu looked great and honestly most brunch joints have a long wait anyway or are expensive when not BYOB. When we arrived it was very crowded, but we made do. We were asked if it was ok to be seated at a table for 4 and place an extra chair. It was fine, but very tight (especially with all our champagne haha). Weird that there were 2 people seated at booths for 6 though..We asked for waters, coffees and OJ (later to find the pitcher was charged per person for a total of $18!!) and only received 3 water glasses (2 more arrived about an hour later after asking again). Utensils were thrown on the table in a handful, falling and my friend having to catch some. My food was ok (Lobster Benedict), but the others in my party seemed to enjoy theirs. Kind of annoying advertising a Gluten Free menu, but it really means they don't serve any toast or English Muffin for the GF version of a Benedict. I didn't get the sauce either, but still. Very skimpy and unflavored. Home fries were maybe 15 pieces of undercooked chopped potato (when I asked for well done). Fruit was skimpy and mostly cantaloupe with one piece of pineapple. Tried my friend's pesto skillet, which was tasty.The restaurant slowed down once we were finishing, so we stayed much longer to finish all of our champagne. No, we didn't order more, but there was nobody else waiting for our table. We were treated very rudely for staying. We still tipped over 20% and the bill was very cheap. The view was nice too.

What makes it great is a few things, but it's not without its detractions. #1) It's BYOB. As in BYO-Champagne for boozy brunch. Can I get a hell yeah?! #2) It has outdoor dining with an excellent view... sometimes. If there's a 5% forecast of rain for the day, but it's sunny and beautiful out, they'll refuse to seat you outside. #3) It has fun menu items. The specials can be hit or miss, but the regular menu is pretty solid.The service leaves a bit to be desired, although they're generally very nice, you can be left waiting from time to time. Grouping together what you need so you only need to ask once for anything during the entire meal seems to help that. I would avoid popping in for a quick breakfast sandwich on your way to work though, as not only does it take a bit of time, but you can get a breakfast sandwich for cheaper (and faster) on the other side of the Hudson.Will I be back?

(the comment below mine) put it nicely ""Friendly servers, clean dining areas, and quick service with a view."" They also have a variety of choices from their menu. My boyfriend and I were so pleased, we came back around the same time the next day (Sunday). We came here on a Saturday around 2pm. It wasn't too busy, we were seated within two minutes. My boyfriend had the Tuscany omelette: red peppers in the omelette, sliced potatoes, a small fruit cup and turkey sausage. I'm so glad they offered turkey sausage! The dish had everything he wanted. I had the s'mores hot chocolate. It had whipped cream, some chocolate drizzled with graham cracker sprinkled on top; delicious! My meal was the OMG french toast; three french toast slices, caramel sauce with bacon bits, pecans and sprinkled with confectioner sugar. It was very good, but became too sweet after the second slice of french toast; I do wish that I asked to substitute the caramel sauce for maple syrup.We came back the day after, Sunday around the same time. We were seated within the same amount of time. It was a little louder than the other day and a little more busy. But we still received the same amount of friendly service and great food. My boyfriend got a latte and the same dish. I got the Tropical Crunch Waffle. Our waiter accidentally gave me french toast instead of a Belgian Waffle, but it was quickly replaced. The Tropical Crunch Waffle was served with sliced strawberries, bananas and mangos, with crunchy sweet granola and a side of strawberry syrup. I also asked for a side of maple syrup and pecans. The whole dish was delicious! The waffle was crunchy, the fruit was sweet, the granola and pecans were crunchy as well. Everything tasted fresh! Before tax and tip, the bill on both days came out to below $25! Turning Point of Hoboken is probably the best brunch place we've tried!

The first time I went, I was moderately disappointed in the portion size, but many people say I eat like a teenaged boy, so it might have been reasonable.  I got a skillet that was ok; there were lots of potatoes and just a little less bacon than desired. The dish was served also with the bottom of the tiny ramekin of fruit on top of my sunny side up eggs, which was a little unsavory. On this occasion, the service was a little less than satisfactory, but it was mid-week and kind of quiet. The second time, the service was infinitely better. I guess the weekend staff are more experienced and better equipped. Perhaps my food choice was also better. I got the huevos rancheros, which was quite large ( I ate practically the whole bowl, but that's beside the point).  The mix of hash brown potatoes, dull chorizo, sautéed onions and peppers, beans, and just enough cheese was topped with three eggs and some avocado. It was hearty and well composed.My boyfriend got the cornbread French toast, which was a much more delicate portion than the huevos rancheros. The bread was tender and sweet, but the vanilla marscapone was too much like butter to be enjoyed, but the raw green apples brought a freshness to the breakfast plate, countering the caramel sauce.Overall, I would say Turning Point is solid. The food is pretty good, the prices are not exorbitant and it is a fun place with a beachy, care-free vibe. Side note: The bathrooms, however, are always gross.

I had the Big Easy Skillet and my daughter had the Wilbert Skillet. They are both delicious. But I have to be honest in my reviews, so I have to tell you that I was so grossed out that I almost didn't eat. I went to the bathroom and came out grossed out. The top of the urinal was brown. The inside of it, had dark brown ring and crusted. Oh, and it's not broken. There is running water. No way that a bathroom can get that dirty over night or even in a week. They just don't clean it. I then went to wash my hands and the automatic paper towel dispenser was not working so they had a big roll of paper on top of the sink so you could cut a piece and dry yourself.  Unfortunately the roll was sitting on top of the sink, so it was wet and the wet paper ripped as you pulled it apart. I then came to the table and told my wife what had happened and we could only imagine what's behind the kitchen. We looked at the glass of water and it was dirty. Didn't drink the water. Looked at the fork and knive and it was dirty. Had them returned. What a shame! I thought of talking to the manager on the side about it, but decided to take a look at some of the other reviews, and other people have complained about the same thing. What a shame!!! I guess they don't read Yelp reviews. If they did, then they just don't care, because nothing has improved. What a shame!!!",Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I went here for brunch a few months back and didn't like my food at all. Thinking it was just a bad coincidence, I decided to give it one more try and went here on Labour day during lunch. My server had no idea what was happening. She came to take our order and then disappeared for 15 minutes. I had ordered an iced latte mocha flavored and my friend got a large orange juice. For 15 mins we had no drinks, not even water. Someone finally brought me my latte but not my friend's juice. The latte was disgusting. It was watered down milk. I traced my waitress and told her to change it. She realized she had placed the order to the wrong table and sent me the wrong latte. 10mins later my latte came. Still no orange juice. Our food arrived and then was followed by the orange juice. The food was absolutely disappointing. My friend got the chicken philly. It was a few dry pieces of chicken breast in a bun with the smallest serving of peppers on it. My egg skillet (I got popeye) was average. The eggs were cooked well but the potatoes at the bottom were like little rocks. There was no sour cream on it like it said on the menu and I had to specially order that too. She also forgot the salsa that came with my friend's order. The salsa and chips were the best part of my meal. I really hope that this place stops focusing on their reservation list and makes an effort to serve its customers well and make some quality food.

I complained to multiple people and they told me the waitress would be right there and then proceeded to stand there doing nothing and calling no one. Finally we just grabbed a menu, calculated the total ourselves and were planning to leave cash and leave. The waitress finally showed up as we were putting cash on the table.

However, I ordered food from here recently and now feel more confident giving a review.I can kind of see why I didn't really remember all too clearly how my experience here was previously - the food just wasn't all that special. This time, we ordered a bowl of the turkey chili, the turkey club sandwich, the basic skillet with scrambled eggs and mixed veggies and chicken tenders (off the kid's menu lol). The food took about an hour to arrive after ordering on Seamless, which was the approximate timing it had stated. The delivery woman was friendly, which was nice.The clear plastic containers they put the food in was sort of nice, organizationally. Nothing was ambushed or spilling. However, the plastic was burned through by the chicken tenders - they put the chicken on the plastic too quickly after trying it so there were holes in the plastic. This rendered the chicken inedible because it's now got melted plastic on it (even if you can't see it) - high risk of cancer. As for the food that we could eat, the potatoes that the chicken came with were subpar - they weren't seasoned well and the texture was meh. The turkey in the sandwich was quite dry, and the turkey chili was very watery and the taste wasn't all there. My boyfriend did enjoy his basic skillet, however.

The moment we were seated I noticed that both of our utensils AND our drink glasses were dirty with dried food and lipstick marks.

I got potato hash with my Lobster Benedict; when I was about half way done with my food and about to fork into the potatoes I noticed there was a hair sitting in it. I immediately lost my appetite and stopped eating. My boyfriend complained to our waitress and she took my food away.

The syrup comes on the side so you can basically eat it however you want.The egg dishes are eggceptionally good as well. Perfect combo for the dishes.

She says someone will come over with new one and get our order.  A server finally comes in. 15 minutes later another server brings the food. Bacon is burnt, scramble eggs are dry. The pancakes that I ordered to my 19 months old son are super dry. No butter. No extras. Corn syrup (you pay extra for maple syrup) Summary is: service is terrible and food... well, there are a ton of places that you can get way more without the humiliation of begging for someone to take your order or change water with floating hair.",Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"

The food also looked and smelled amazing! That alone makes me want to come back. Alas, on to the actual review of the cafe. Turning Point Cafe is their fast causal option for people who are on the go or people like our group, who did not have the time for a sit down meal. The cafe offers pastries, breakfast sandwich, and a variety of beverages (both hot and cold). I ordered a berry smoothie and an egg white bagel sandwich with turkey sausage and cheese. Trying to be healthy while balancing the egg. I'll start with the positive, the sandwich and smoothie were tasty and satisfied my breakfast craving. The negative was the wait. They must have not been fully staffed the Sunday morning we went, because the cafe was slow. It took 20 minutes for our food to come out. Maybe I'm underestimating how long it takes the sandwiches and drinks to be prepared, but the staff didn't seem like they were in a hurry either.

But of course she has a job to do too, but maybe getting those buzzers would help, idk something other than screaming in the restaurant. Our party of 6 was seated on a table that would fit 4 comfortably. So we sat squished for a bit, with the baby off to the corner on a high chair. Until we noticed a huge booth open up. WIN! So we were able to move. As we started to place our orders, the waitress informed us that they ran out of ice cream and we were planning on getting one of the shakes (bummer). Then she proceeded to tell us that we couldn't order french toast (another let down). So we placed our orders and they came out a bit sporadically. One of the dishes was supposed to have a well done egg, and it came out over easy. Which was another frustration. But the food was delicious. I got the wilber platter which was fantastic.

However, the hostess situation gets a 0.If you go to turning point you will without a doubt be waiting, minimum 30 mins, which is perfectly fine. The wait is not the issue. The hostess is always so disorganized and overwhelmed. They can't keep track of names, # of people in parties, or the order people came in/called ahead. The stand is a total mess, scraps of papers everywhere in no order whatsoever, putting names down on a page 3 pages prior - that they never refer back to, and forget who is on the page. The huddle of customers are always agitated and running out of patience in the front lobby. I have worked in several busy restaurants in the past and I have never seen such chaos.I've always noticed that the hostess' at Turning Point are extremely young and inexperienced. Management should seriously consider hiring a hostess that is more mature, has experience, and can handle the waiting customers in an organized fashion.

The menu is great with a variety of savory and sweet options to satisfy everyone's cravings. Being a sweet tooth, my fave order is the Lemon Blueberry Dream pancakes with a side of bacon ($2.99 for 3 skinny strips). Most things on the menu are under $10, which makes it a better deal than eating out at some greasy diner.Now onto the seating system.... Reading through other Yelp reviews, I learned that they allow you to put your name down by calling ahead. However, putting down your name does absolutely nothing to shorten your wait on a weekend. What they do is write down your name with the time you called in. Then, once you've arrived and checked in with them, they write down your arrival time. Now here's the tricky part... They only seat you according to what time you arrived. So basically you are still looking at a minimum of 30-45 minute wait time. Even though you got there 20 minutes after calling, hoping you only had to wait additional 15 minutes.Just like Larry David, we were wondering why the heck they allow people to put down their names early if we all still have to wait??? To add insult, they completely forgot about us because we waited outside.So, pro-tips: always allow approximately 45 mins for waiting (that is just a fact of life if you want to eat at Turning Point... or go at off-hours), be patient, and wait INSIDE (make sure the girl hasn't forgotten about you by checking in with her every 10 mins or so).Finally, if you can actually get through all that, enjoy your brunch!",Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I ordered the OMG French toast and it was delicious. It was not overly sweet and the flavors of the French toast with the pecans and high quality bacon, with real maple syrup, made for a deliciously satisfying meal. My husband got the Marsala eggs Benedict which also was delicious and so flavorful. Lots of well sautéed vegetables with perfectly poached eggs on a baguette. We ordered the Kona French press coffee: I would return just for this. It had a very full earthy body and natural sweetness without acidity.  The service was outstanding and the vibe very peaceful and laid back.

Well, sadly, turns out that the food was above par but the service was horrendous. Actually goes on my top three for worst services. My friend and I got seated immediately because it was a quiet Thursday afternoon: there were only a couple other tables filled, not enough to be crazy busy but enough people that there was a nice hum of business. It took the waitress five minutes to bring our water, five minutes to bring the glasses we could drink out of, we asked for a table change because of the sun and it took her ten minutes to clean the table, when I received my iced tea, it came with no straw so I literally waited for ten minutes for her to come back over so that I could ask for a straw. No apologies, no rush. I was a server and I know what's good and bad manners as a waiter. It was painfully obvious that she did not want to be there looking at how slow she moved, literally strolling when patrons were getting impatient for food. When our order finally came, I had to ask her for utensils. Which took another few minutes to get. And when she was back, my friend asked if we could get two small plates because we were sharing food. The waitress lifted the eggs Benny saucer off the hot plate and grabbed the doily and told us to use the bottom plate, which was used as just a serving plate. My friend and I were affronted. She couldn't even get us plates? Seriously? I would understand if she were hectic and every table was filled. Only half the tables were full, and from what I could see, everyone got pretty much the same crap, lazy service. Really ruined my meal which is a shame because I liked the lobster Benedict. They gave a good amount of meat and the English muffins were nice and crunchy, soft on the middle. The eggs were a tad over but the pairing of hollandaise, paprika, lobster, avocado, and tomato with bacon was so good I didn't care much. The French toast was meh. I expected more but the consistency of the bread was a little gross. Too soggy for my liking. I don't think I'll be going back here anytime soon. The view is nice, but you can get that same view with better service and an overall better meal anywhere up and down the Hudson from Edgewater to Hoboken.

The wait staff were rude and didn't seem to care about anything. The tables and cups were dirty when we sat and we were there at opening. It took us asking three times to get enough place settings for our group and I had to send a plate back for being cold. They took it into the kitchen and five minutes later brought it back out microwaved. It looked exactly the same as when they took it just soggy and wilted. Don't get anything with the sausage gravy! You've been warned. We sat near the kitchen door so I could hear the microwave beeping all morning. The French press coffee was good at least.

197,xkzJBEFcjwqQcD3krw1bfQ,Lisa Y.,2.0 star rating,"Turning Point of Hoboken reminds of diners in Indiana. I walk in, fight traffic with strollers to get to the wait list. And then I put my name down. The girl up front tells me it's a 30 minute wait. That's fine.We wait awkwardly by the door because there's not much left of the waiting area that's not already taken up by strollers.This is very interesting for me because a) we don't see strollers at brunch in NYC. b) NYC servers are aspiring broadway stars looking to put food on the table (literally) but the workers here are teenagers paying for their braces. THIS. This is why it reminds me of Indiana.I take a peek at the wait list, and I see that we're the next 'big table'. (Yes, table of 4 is a 'big table'. Lucky for us, we have no strollers so they can literally plop us anywhere.) Unfortunately, the next 'big table' didnt' go to us, because someone called in ahead of time to put their name down. This does not replace a reservation, but it's basically like putting your name down without actually being there.Funny thing, when my SO called an hour ago, and asked if they took reservations, she was passed around to 3 people before they told her, 'no, we don't take reservations.' And did bother to tell us that we can put our names down.Whatever. just give me my coffee.We sit down, and we order our food. Mind you, this is the second time I've been here, and the food is decent enough for me to not just walk out after the whole seating situation. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros, SO got the Lobsters Benedict, friend got the bandito burrito and also the Lobsters Benedict. We also got their french press and also their Bananas Foster waffle to share. Spoiler alert, the bananas were not fostered. At least they weren't spoiled.I thought it was very interesting that they don't give you syrup for their waffles by default. Granted, their waffles are very loaded to start with, maybe most of their clients don't do syrup. But I'm not asking for like a cup of syrup, a little dispenser is fine by me. But you have to ASK for syrup. You can also have the option of purchasing maple syrup for $1.37, at that point, I don't mind spending another buck on syrup. AND IT COMES OUT BEING DICKINSONS. I mean, I'm not much of a syrup connoisseur, but at least slap ""Vermont"" or ""grade A"" on the mini-teeny-tiny jar or something. Not gonna lie, their food is great. I love their chorizo in their Big Easy Benedict and their Huevos Rancheros. The flavor balances are pretty good, sometimes less is more.Girlfriend loves the lobster benedicts, it's her go-to dish at Turning Point. I do love the little rock candy coffee stirrers instead of plain sugar. I don't put sugar in my coffee, so I just eat that like a lollipop. Don't judge me.Honestly, if it wasn't for the limited options in Hoboken, the chorizos, I'd probably not come back here.",Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Thumbs up in the food department. - it's a pretty big place all things considered. There are probably 10-15 tables and a bar that sits 6-8. I definitely don't recommend it for big parties (6+) because you'll wait a while. - affordable. You can get a solid meal for $8-12- cool view, it's right by the water so you can see the city skyline if you're at a window table- milkshakes Negative:- no reservations. They have a call ahead list but they don't honor it. The hostess situation is really unorganized. They use a clipboard, pencil and their best judgement - which isn't good. Open table or some other booking software would do wonders for this place. The bar is first come first serve seating so if you're a party of 2 just hang out by the bar and snag some chairs when another party leaves. Overall pretty satisfied. We came here on a Sunday at 1pm for brunch, which is their busiest time, and we ate and were out the door in an hour. It's got a diner feel, nothing terribly unique on the menu.

When the waitress poured my water there was a sticky dark substance that leaked all over our table, napkins and silverware from underneath our pitcher.  She did not clean it up or check on us as I wiped the table clean.

The meal took an hour longer than it ought to have as a result. Wife says, maybe it's a one-time thing. She wants to be a fan.Time #3, this morning: Wife wants to take our in-laws there for brunch. Sounds good to me, though I had already sort of concluded that things weren't well-run here. Things go downhill: After putting my name in for a table, was told it would be a 20 minute wait. No problem. My entire party stood and sat in front of the hostess. 20 minutes goes by. Nobody calls our name, but we're patient. 45-50 minutes go by. We ask what's up. Oh, we forgot about you, sorry, it'll be another 20 minutes. The hostess (Indian girl with braces) acted like it was our fault. Said ""we didn't know your whole party was there' -- hello, we've been sitting directly in front of you for almost an hour. Crammed in with other people waiting. You never called our name. You never said sorry for wasting our morning. So we left. We went to the Madison Grill two blocks away on Washington Street, got a seat with no line, had great food, friendly waiter, you name it. Better brunch by about a million miles, and a less corny atmosphere to boot. Not a tragedy, but jeez. We aren't the kinds of people who raise fits or even lodge complaints. We don't file one-star Yelp reviews, generally speaking. I try not to have ridiculous expectations for service, but I shouldn't have to budget an extra hour or two into my day because you can't run a restaurant well. And really -- we all make mistakes.

228,oMVnqtBt63iYlZAxPoHbIA,Donna F.,3.0 star rating,"I have to agree with several other reviewers on this place...the food is excellent, but the service and overall way things are run here needs to improve, stat. I think this place is like a game of Press Your Luck; some patrons are seated right away and taken care of, others wait and linger for an hour or more. That said, we were the lucky ones (somewhat).On Sunday (08/31), my boyfriend's mom stopped by to visit and we decided to come here for brunch. I had heard both good and bad things about this place, so I prepared myself not to have too high expectations. I was glad I did this, because the two hostesses (the one standing outside and the one standing inside) were absolutely clueless. Friendly as they were, it seemed obvious to me they were hired about two weeks ago and did not receive any training (if at all). We realized we would be in for a long wait when the indoor hostess gave us a blank stare after my boyfriend's mom asked her how long it would be to wait for a table. ""Um....30, 40...50 minutes?"" she guessed, and then she giggled. No, seriously. I then saw three open spaces at the bar and quickly suggested we sit there instead, as there would be no wait. Ta-da! Crisis averted.Our server Catherine (or maybe it was Katherine) seemed to be more on-point than our ditzy hostesses, and took our orders fairly quickly. I ordered a glass of ruby red grapefruit juice and I decided to get the Tropical Crunch Waffle, which came with sliced bananas, strawberries, and mango pieces, and topped with crunchy bits of granola and a little dusting of powdered sugar. I also thought it was nice they placed the syrup in a separate container on the side; I hate it when breakfast places drown my pancakes or waffles in syrup. I thought it was very good, except the mango pieces didn't blend as well with the sweet flavors of the banana and strawberries. Syrup to the rescue!My boyfriend had the Hawaiian Wheat French Toast, which I took a bite of, and wow...that was probably what I should have ordered. The brown sugar rum sauce alone is worth it. Topped with bits of pineapple, strawberries, banana, and toasted coconut (!), this was perfection on a plate. If I ever come here again, I'm ordering this.My boyfriend's mother ordered the Veggie Omelette and she polished it off (which is unusual, since she normally doesn't clean her plate in restaurants). I tried a piece and I was pleasantly surprised: the eggs weren't overcooked or greasy, and I liked the savory taste of the spinach and tomato bits blending with the sweet flavors of the cheese. Not sure what cheese was used; it might have been goat cheese, but it was good.As I said, we were the lucky ones in that we didn't have to wait forever to snag seats or get our food, but I noticed plenty of exasperated people pacing up and down near the exit behind us. One guy and his wife sat and waited almost the entire time we were there; they finally were escorted to a table as we gathered our things and headed out. Another guy (delivery man, I'm assuming) ran in and loudly complained to one of the servers that they screwed up someone's take-out order, and the server rolled her eyes, grabbed the bag from the guy, and slammed it down on the counter without bothering to check to see if the orders were switched by mistake. Also, it appears no one who works here is older than 23, so that could be a recipe for disaster, especially since I did not identify one person who looked like a manager or supervisor.Bottom line: Turning Point has good food, but they need to get their shit together in training their staff, or else they will lose patronage.",Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"

We would have been there for the opening whistle but both daughters pooped their diapers just prior to us leaving the house.  Boooo our livesWe get there and immediately see 2 open tables outside that are looking over at the incredible NYC skyline that is - what feels like - a touch away.  So we go to stand by the little stand thingy that the hostess is supposed to be at. She's not.  Everyone ""looks busy"" but after 15 min of standing there waiting for the hostess to stop telling us that it will just be a minute, I've had enough; along with the 2 other couples with children whose patience mirrors old people waiting for their food.  The 2 tables that were looking us at us calling our name and saying ""sit here"" FINALLY had someone tending to them so that we can own em.  And then it happened ""Danny? Your table is ready"". It was like the ""Seinfeld party of 4"" moment.  AhhhhWe had to shimmy our huge double stroller and make people get up through the tight space that is the outdoor seating.  But this is our fault for having 2 kids so close in age.  Nobody else's. Boooo our livesLooking on here I saw lots of recommendations.  Rose, my wife, went with the grande Huevos rancheros. It was grand for sure.  Very tasty but we both weren't a big fan of the ""wheat burrito shell"" that it sat in.  I love a nice crunch with my Huevos rancheros and this was not what I expected.  But good salsa and flavors encompassed the food making me wish in ordered it I ordered the burrito.  It wasn't that tasty.  There was just too much egg in it.  Does that even make sense.  The thing was like a chipotle burrito but instead of being filled with wonderful goodness that can kill a small family, it was stuffed with eggs eggs and more eggs.  Oh and there was a lot of peppers, onions and something that resembled chorizo but tasted more like meat balls.  It wasn't terrible. But it wasn't the best I had either. It came in the exact same wheat wrap that was holding my wife's meal.  Booooo. I hate wheat wraps for burritos. We were excited to order the $10 coffee. Yes.  10 bux. It's a french press of blue mountain Jamaica coffee and enough for 4 people.  So the 4 of us enjoyed a nice cup of coffee. Just kidding. Of course my 2yr old and 9 month old did not have coffee.  Best part of the meal I give it 3 stars because it was just ok in my opinion.  We may go back to try other things because you really can't beat that view.",Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Big fan of the fact they offer at least 7-8 healthy options, which is more than most diners.  Even with the healthy options, portions are huge and since its NJ, the price is right. My bf and I ate here for $10 on a busy Sat. Around noon. Waits are about 30 min but since this locations is right by the water, it wasn't a bad view to take in while waiting. When we sat down, they sat us at a big booth and we got a first look at the view. My bf got the egg white pesto skillet which came with your choice of bread (he got English muffin), and a fruit cup (meh) This was really good- touch of basil pesto mixed in with plentiful onions, tomatoes, avocado and mushrooms. There was a lot. I got the fit and trim combo which was egg white scramble with veggies, lean turkey sausage in a honey wheat wrap. Unfortunately  it was not salty at all so a bit bland. However it came with oatmeal that was really good- didn't use my raisins, just a tad of brown sugar. We got a pot of unlimited coffee. It was strong because I was buzzing after round 2.

Service wasn't great - it was hard to find our server at times and when we were looking for the check she was nowhere to be found. There was also no hostess manning the booth for outside seating.

Finally we were seated and ordered. Literally we waited more than 35 min for our breakfast to be served. During that time I watched numerous delivery orders get whisked out the door.

Surprisingly one of the best experiences ever.,Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Fedex clerk returns ten minutes later with an untoasted, bland bagel. That is what it is like to have a bagel here.Another thing. The trash bin here was overflowing.

A couple of friends and myself decided to make our way to this place for some brunch, and from the moment we walked in i knew the staff was going to be the highlight of the day. We walk in and are greeted by a teenage host I'm assuming who asked us how many in our party, we said 3 and stood there as he discussed among himself and some servers who were there as to where to seat us, that lasted a couple minutes. We were seated at the far right side of the establishment and were given menus. We sat there with menus for 20 minutes before a friend had to turn around and just stare at the bar to get someone to acknowledge our presence. A young lady came to our table about a minute later and stated that she was not our server but she would take our drink orders. So we put in the drink orders and continue to sit, quite aggravated at the service at this point. About 10 minutes later the same young lady comes back without any drinks to let us know that they cannot make my friends latte. This wouldn't be such a big deal if we hadn't already sat through the rest of the horrible service. This whole time we still hadn't even met our server. We promptly decided to leave and told the young lady to never mind our drinks. This place really needs a more experienced staff, the food can be great but people don't go out to eat just for the food, they expect some form of service which this places young staff definitely doesn't provide.

Unfortunately we left a little later than we'd anticipated and thus found ourselves caught in the onslaught of people waiting around for breakfast. It took us nearly an hour to be seated, which I guess was our own fault. As for breakfast, it was very good. Both of us went for the skillet and had sausage added to the standard skillet. Coffee came to the table in it's own pot - WhoooHooo! and I think I might have downed the whole thing by myself. Note: I really miss having an over abundance of coffee when I go out to brunch, so that was major bonus points. Turning Point's downfall? We waited (again!) about 10 minutes for the check after we asked for it and nearly 20 minutes for her to pick up the check! She kept on walking right past us as we sat occupying her table (trying to catch her eye, btw) waiting for her to pick up the check. It was preposterous, especially considering the throngs of people waiting outside. She could have cleared her table 30 minutes before she actually did, more people could have been sat and she could have potentially made more money in tips.

The hostess even gave us directions to the nearest liquor store since it is BYO.Second visit I tried calling ahead to say we were on our way and had a dog therefore had to be seated outside. I was told they don't take reservations and when I tried to clarify that wasn't what  I was trying to do I was told call aheads were only for parties of 5 or more (fair enough) and that outdoor seating was first come, first seat. This confused me because the first time we came we had to put our name down. First come, first seat to me means you sit once a table is available but when we arrived the hostess explained yes its first come, first seat but I still need to take your name and you have to wait to be called.Still confused but willing to wait - we did. For an hour. During which we saw two parties of the same size (3) walk up, put their name down and immediately get seated. When I questioned the hostess she claimed they had their names on the list from earlier.When the hostess explained we would be seated next we got up and watched as it took her almost 10 minutes to clean THREE tables off - all the while stopping to clean her sunglasses several times. We saw that two dogs were sitting within the fenced in area which was peculiar because I knew from our first visit that dogs needed to be on the outside of the fence.  The hostess proceeded to sit us at a table farthest from the fence even though she knew we had a dog with us and when we started to bring him in she told us he had to be leashed to the outside of the fence. So we brought up the obvious point that two other dogs were happily relaxing inside the fence. She looked at us blankly and ignored our comment. Frustrated and just wanting to eat, I offered the solution that we sit at one of the two seater tables that was available right along the fence and pull up a chair since we were a group of 3. She reluctantly agreed.The other guests with dogs inside the fence looked at us confused and just shook their head. We ordered the same thing we did the first time we came which was the Grand French Toast and Wilbur Skillet. French toast was excellent but the Wilbur Skillet had inedible avocado (hard and not yet ripe).Service was very slow and we had to flag down our waitress several times - although I believe she was the only one servicing the outside area.All in all, the food is what will bring me back to Turning Point although if it remains inconsistent I will stop coming AND if I have another bad experience with the service I will definitely NOT be back.",Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"

After summoning my family of table readiness, the same declining customer said, we'll take it and she accommodated them instead.

Staff there are friendly and helpful although they have seemed to struggle in finding a great host/hostess through the years. Seating is good although everyone is right about the abundance of families here. The back room or as we call it the ""fireplace room"" is normally a family zone so noise levels will be a bit higher there. Views of the city can't be beat and always impress our out of town guests.Wait time is normally 30 minutes but it helps to call ahead and put your name on the list. Sometimes the wait is longer but we love the place so it's worth it.Food selection is beyond for breakfast although me and my husband's favorite is the Wilbur Skillet. I also recommend the Hawaiian French Toast, Chunky Monkey Pancakes and the Fit n Trim Combo. Portion sizes are really big so don't expect to want to eat for many hours. Lunch sandwiches are also good. My favorite is the Atilla the Ham which was on the cafe menu but they still make it for me (honey mustard dipping sauce is yum!) My husband really loves the salsa that comes with chips and the sandwiches.Drink selection is awesome. As a tea drinker, I love their vast selection of hot teas and their brewed iced tea in the summer is a must. You can always ask for a to-go cup to enjoy on the walk back. My husband loves the pot of coffee they bring to the table so you never have to wait for refills. The Citrus Chill drink is refreshing and a nice alternative if you like OJ.They also have a cafe section for items to-go. Wait is a bit sometimes so don't cut it too close to catching the ferry.

But, this time we did not have a great experience.  Since Turning Point in Hoboken is such a popular place and gets packed pretty fast, we decided to go early.  There was a wait list.  The hostess said there was a 30-minute wait. Wait time to be seated: 30 minutesWait time for a server to take our order: 15 minutes - We were seated at a table that was not even properly dressed! - There was the TP placemat, napkin and a glass.  There were no utensils.  It looked like they just cleaned it off in a rush.  We were waiting for 15 minutes - NO ONE came over to even give us water or offer to take our drinks! I went to the hostess stand to let her know we've been sitting for 15 minutes and no one has come to take our order! And what do you know, a second later here comes a server. I asked for the iced coffee flavor of the day, and the server told me that they only have regular coffee (another let down).  I told him they should revise the menu then and take it out. Wait time for our food to get to our table: 45 MINUTES!  (With 20 minutes to spare for eating before we get a ticket!)Wait time for our check to come to us: 5 seconds!My sister ordered lobster benedict: ""Succulent lobster meat, crispy smoked bacon, avocado, tomato slices and poached eggs on a toasted english muffin glazed with a cilantro hollandaise sauce"". The eggs were very well done and not poached at all! The smoked bacon was not at all crispy as described but very chewy.  They should really call it bacon benedict bc there was a lot of bacon and very little lobster! I ordered Hawaiian Wheat French Toast: ""Multigrain french toast topped with pineapples, strawberries, bananas, toasted coconut, and a vanilla bean drizzle. Served with a side of brown sugar rum sauce""  There wasn't a whole lot of fruit and the toasted coconut was REALLY toasted to the point that it was hard to bite on! The food was pretty decent and the flavors were there.  We like to take our time eating and really chew our food, but with all this waiting, we had to shovel everything in our mouths bc we parked kinda far from the restaurant, and our time on our parking ticket was expiring soon.  It did not make sense for one of us to run to the meter, put more money in and run back to the restaurant.  Food was decent.  Service was bad.  Wait time was ridiculous.",Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I like the concept, but the execution is off at each location. This one is especially bad.

The food does not seem as fresh as it could be. The fruit platters are regularly mushy and served past its shelf life. The staff, while friendly, are incredibly slow. Most recently, it took over 20 minutes to find our server and request the check and then actually receive the check. I love that they leave the coffee pot on your table, but the coffee itself is too bitter and strong for me to enjoy, unfortunately. Maybe it's just me, though.

Truly laid-back atmosphere - we never felt rushed and enjoyed our experience.  We will be back to try other things that caught our eye.Cons: Parking - It's a real Beyotch!  So be prepared to circle side streets or just fork over the cash for one of the nearby garages.  We weren't impressed by the view because we are fortunate to have an amazing view from our own place but we think the staff does a great job given the size of the crowd and the chaos that could ensue.  We will definitely be back and think you should give this place a definite shot if looking for a great brunch spot in Hoboken.",Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Turning point is one of the busiest places in Hoboken which is great for them (if they can satisfy their clients) but terrible for someone who wants a quick bite to eat. I called in this morning to place an order for delivery, 2 bacon egg and cheese sandwiches- these take about 10 minutes to make. I estimated about 30-45 mins, which is normal. The first hour goes by and I'm told they are waiting for the delivery man. Fine. Fast-forward to  2 hours later and still no food. My co-worker called in to check the status and cancel the order, in which she was told that they had no recollection of my order. I then call them back (I rarely ever complain unless it's situations like this) and I was told that they were running behind and that they would cancel my order, flat out end of story.

The view is amazing - possibly the best brunch spot in that respectServers are very nice and always willing to get you what you want when you want itManagement is horrible. Just horrible. This place could actually go on Restaurant Impossible, or one of those shows. There is an absurd line every day of the weekend. That's not unusual for places like this, but it's not only because of the quality of food, it's the lack of qualification of management. They clearly understand how to do inventory because they run out of things often. There are always issues with the kitchen staff fighting with the wait staff. And when an issues arises, instead of them letting you know your meal is going to be slow the attempt to bury it and act as if everything is wonderful. It has gotten progressively worse over the past, let's say, five or six months. And I am starting to think that the food is not worth the wait. It's just not, not when you have a hundred other brunch spots in Hoboken and JC.

They just throw  fresh ingredients together, and I like that.  I often get the huevos rancheros which are good.  My husband has gotten some of the skillets and enjoys them. I've also ordered from the healthy selection which was good too. My only criticism is that they serve granola with one of the healthy meals that has a lot of dried fruit and honey making it really high in sugar. I wish they'd lessen the dried fruit and add fresh fruit to make it healthier.  Regardless, it is tasty and the homemade granola is good. I also love their coffee and huge selections of teas and mixed drink options.  The portions are a good size. The view is great. The service is average.Overall, I love coming here on the weekends.

Our last two visits were among the worst experiences we've ever had at a restaurant. Granted the food is pretty good here but if the employees could ignore you less, they WOULD!One incident, among many, on our second to last visit was the lack of silverware on our table once our food arrived. We asked the two food runners who delivered our food for silverware. They both said ""sure!"" and neither one returned. Not being able to flag anyone else down, I went and asked the guy at the service counter. I could see a whole bin of silverware under the counter. When I asked him for some, he told me I needed to ask my server. Are you kidding me??? I was able to grab another server and asked her. She quickly brought us some. The two food runners we asked never did return. We were also treated rudely by the hostess since we didn't respond immediately to the text that our table was ready. Problem was, she told us there was a 20 minute wait. She texted us 2 MINUTES later and we didn't notice the text had come in. So yeah... TOTALLY OUR FAULT and she was completely justified for being rude to us.Yesterday we returned again against our better judgement. We were seated in the outdoor section where 3 servers were working. 10 minutes after being seated we still hadn't been greeted or told someone would be with us soon. One server walked by our table 5 times. Two of her trips past us were to wander off and then back on to the property. When I told the hostess no one had helped us, she proceeded to take our order, bring us our coffee and food and checked back several times. She was helping take up the slack at several other tables as well as the servers just couldn't be bothered. At one point our server, who had completely ignored us for 20 minutes at that point, decided she was going to start waiting on us. Too little too late. We handed our tip to the hostess, who just happened to be working her last day. Makes totally sense since this place is incapable of keeping good employees on staff.If we ever want food from this place again, we'll take it to go.

The homefries were embarrassingly bad--for a place that ONLY does breakfast, it's an atrocity. The coffee was burnt! As almost every other yelper mentioned, the service was terrible.  The final straw: my friend found a piece of wood in the chicken salad sandwich. It appeared to be about half inch of a toothpick, but the toothpicks in the sandwich were both fully intact.

Afterward you're right on the water, a perfect place to walk off a great meal. I visited on a Sunday morning and there was an approx 15 minute wait for a seat, but the staff was attentive and I thought the wait would be longer than it was. The waiter was upbeat and attentive, started us off with a pot of coffee and they seem to have all sorts of milk options (skim, soy, cream etc). I went simple with French Toast, and 3 large pieces arrived and were delicious. It's worth mentioning that prices aren't absorbitantly high, I found most breakfast/brunch items, waffles, pancakes, eggs etc to be under $10. Very reasonable considering the location.

She did tell us about the awesome 10 East in Bayonne, Minado in Little Ferry and now Turning Point in Hoboken. Turning Point is strictly a breakfast and lunch joint. It opens at 6am and closes at 3pm every day. And because it's in Hoboken, with all their yuppie selves, there are more than a few organic entrees that you can choose from. I, however, am a person who believes on ""living on the edge"" so I ordered what is called a ""Big Daddy Omelette.""  What is that, you ask? It is a six egg omelette, loaded with Virginia Ham, chorizo sausage,  smoked bacon and extra cheese.  And no, that is not a typo: SIX EGG OMELETTE.And the coffee that is served is fresh, fresh, fresh. You actually brew it while at the table. It is one of those where the beans are in the urn, and after waiting 10 minutes (you actually get a timer), you push down on the contraption, thus crushing the coffee beans and making fresh coffee.  Needless to say, it was some of the best coffee I have ever had. Did I mention that this is all on the Hoboken waterfront? Well it is, so you get an amazing view of Manhattan across the Hudson River as you are eating. Highly recommended!PS I should mention that I am typing this from the ICU of the hospital. I guess that six egg omelette really got to me...PPS i'm kidding about being in the hospital.",Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"

There's nothing like having a little Sunday brunch at the Turning Point, with a steaming cup of fresh coffee and the entire Manhattan skyline right next to you. The place has a great New-England-style vibe and having the water (even if it is the Hudson) right outside certainly helps. Everything I've personally tried on the menu is incredible and that includes the Popeye skillet, the Stuffed French Toast, the Crabcake Benedict, the ridiculously huge Huevos Rancheros and the Tuscany Omelet. This is also a great place to bring parents for breakfast as Hoboken is littered with too many bar-brunches where hungover cooks serve sloppy greasy food.

460,DOny_M6Xc_954y9-D2y9mQ,Justin E.,4.0 star rating,"For any fans of HIMYM, I agree with Marshall that brunch is one of the best meals ever created, but I have never found myself awake at the proper brunch time without something else to do. That means the only times that I get to enjoy breakfast and lunch is when I make my way down to the local diner, but in a state riddled with diners, Hoboken is lacking. I had no idea there was another alternative to Malibu, until today. Located on the same side of Hoboken as Malibu, Turning Point is located on the corner of Sinatra Dr and 14th St. Because it is so far away, it isn't visited by many Stevens students, which is a shame because Turning Point enjoys a beautiful view of New York City as it sits right along the water. Unlike a stereotypical diner, Turning Point is bright, clean, and just has a very fresh feeling. The wait staff was extremely attentive and helpful, especially our server Mary, who dealt magnificently with my fit of indecisiveness.  When you look on the surprisingly colorful menu, you will notice a special symbol next to some of the dishes to signify that it is a ""Unique Culinary Creation"" created by the chefs at Turning Point. Always wanting to try the specials, I ordered the Grande Huevos Rancheros, which is their version of the Mexican classic containing diced potatoes, chipotle peppers, chorizo sausage, onion, black beans, cilantro, and avocado on a toasted tortilla topped with mixed cheeses, salsa, and sour cream. If that seemed like a lot of ingredients, it's because it was. The massive dish was one of the first entrees that I've had to take a doggie bag for. Another unique culinary creation we ordered was the Bananas Foster, which they describe to be a New Orleans tradition that had split bananas and a sweet dark rum sauce with toasted pecans on the side. Although smaller portions compared to the Rancheros, the same high quality was there. Not only wanting to try their breakfast, we ordered the Pavo Cubano which is their version of the popular Cuban sandwich made with ham, roasted turkey breast, Swiss, tomato, pickles, and some honey mustard to finish it off, which was pretty good, but nothing to go crazy over. Turning Point also had a collection of exotic French Press coffees, so I had the pleasure to try their Jamaica Blue Mountain Certified Blend. Apparently it is one of the most sought after and expensive coffees in the world. While I thought it tasted pretty good, I don't know if I would have bought that if I wasn't throwing around Stute monies. Located in the far away land known as Uptown Hoboken, Turning Point is a true gem. While it is out of my usual circumference of lazy, the idea of breakfast at lunch got me to take the epic afternoon trek. Their stellar service, nice atmosphere, and delicious food will have me coming back for more. I almost regret writing an article about them to spread the word because the selfish side of me wants to keep this place to myself. However, I am counting that the rest of the Stevens population is like me and will be too lazy or too busy to make the trip.",Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"

465,rxX6LqmIkh8fF0DrqtsIaw,Kelly O.,4.0 star rating,"Three things stand out about my experience at Turning Point: the food, the service and the decor. Two of these three were good enough to return (the food and decor) while the service may become a deal breaker should the restaurant loose its footing. Our meal consisted of Florentine Benedict and Popeye Skillet (with iced chai and ginger tea for beverages). The food was delicious and servings were generous but not obscene. I had plenty of time during the 30 minute wait (Sunday brunch) to take in the decor and appreciate the New England country vibe of the place. Turning Point is clean and fresh, dare I say cozy. Contributing to this warmth is the lovely natural lighting, which helps the space to feel open and spacious. There's also mixed seating comprised of a diner-counter, booths and tables. In short, I very much enjoyed being there on a Sunday morning. I have to agree with fellow reviewers that the service is lacking. It's my opinion that this is due to the customer-facing staff being on the younger side and as such, doesn't have the composure to deal with crowds of hungry patrons. There wasn't any overt rudeness but sometimes I felt as though I were creating an inconvenience for the staff by patronizing their establishment. I think the reason the poor service stands out is because it sharply contrasts with the otherwise home-y atmosphere. This place feels warm and you feel nestled inside of a good friend's home but the encounter with the staff is jarring because you're expecting otherwise. You're expecting a composed host but instead get the service of a rushed, generic diner. The disconnect between and decor and demeanor is striking.

The service was certainly lacking in some basic nuances- first rushing to take the order and then  not following up enough (more on that later).  On the positive side, we shared a crab cake salad/excellent. The tropical crunch waffle with fresh berries, granola and warm fruit sauces was delicious. The virgin mojito is refreshing and more of a slushy. Onto the eggs benedict saga. My sister's crab cake eggs benedict was very good - with the eggs perfectly cooked. I, on the hand (I was very explicit)  requested not to have runny or mooshy egg whites and that is exactly what I got on the second egg. I sent it back and just requested a quick flash on the pan to finish it. The kitchen decided to make a new one and that ""executive decision""  kept me waiting 10 minutes. Then when it finally arrived, it was basically a hard boiled egg. The waitress was apologetic but did nothing in terms of any offering or jester to relieve this faux pas.

We took our leftovers to go and on the way out, the coffee barista upfront offered us bags for our meals and extra utensils and was very pleasant about it!  Yes, the only downside of this place is the noise level and the no alcohol but think about it as making a trip to a much nicer and better tasting IHOP.  This place is clearly a family friendly place so don't expect conversations about hip things young yuppies talk about.   This place rules.

I used to live in Long Branch, NJ and they had a location in my apartment complex so I already knew what this place was all about when they opened up in Hoboken a few years ago. Great brunch and great lunch! They are all about healthier food options and a comfotable place to meet friends. There is also an adjoining cafe with take out options, magazines and wifi. If you're going to have lunch here, I'd recommend the Tomato Basil soup and the Pitalia Melt. For breakfast, its all good!",Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"
504,dOisEUVsc-O7VLiiKLp9Zg,Alex C.,5.0 star rating,"Turning Point is a famous breakfast restaurant that has opened numerous locations across New Jersey.  The Hoboken one is not yet as popular as the others, but once the full word is out the hour long waits will be in effect. I am still yet to have bad food here, everything is great - even the water (they put oranges in it).  I had eaten a majority of the breakfast food - I frequent the wilber skillet among other things.  The service is always top notch and if they F up any of your food they will immediately comp or take care of you in some other way.  One of my friends recently found out they delivered and has become a recent addict.  I think the only way you can have sub-par food here is if you get the most basic meal - just plain eggs, toast and bacon.  I recommend getting one of their omelets, skillets, stuffed french toast or pancakes.  I cannot speak for the lunch as my eyes have rarely left the breakfast side of the menu based on what I have tasted in the past.  They have a pretty expansive coffee menu - if you are into that as well. The Hoboken Turning Point is in an ideal location and looks right out onto the Hudson.  I would highly recommend going soon before word gets out like the one in Long Branch's Pier Village - it is bare minimum an hour wait no matter what time you get there.  This place make for an ideal hangover cure but closes pretty early 3 or 4 so you have to get in before then to get the full experience.",Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I feel like Michael Bay could produce a movie based on people just trying to find a place to eat breakfast on this busiest day of days. I was visiting my brother, sis-in-law and niece for the weekend in NJ and we decided (spur of the moment) that on Mother's Day we wanted to eat at Turning Point. My SIL ate here almost every week that she was pregnant and has taken every member of my family to this restaurant (much to their delight) except for me. We called that fateful Sunday morning and found out that because of the special day, they were not even taking call-ins! Oh my goodness! What to do?! We decided the food was so good we were going to just go for it. We pulled up to the restaurant ran in and asked the hostess what the wait time was going to be to eat some breakfast food! Luckily it was only 30 minutes. AND! Because it was mother's day they had set up a little play area in the back where there were games for kids and free coffee/lemonade for adults. Lovely! We went and hung out in the back for about 30 minutes and were seated in a spacious booth that accommodated all of us easily. And best of all, we had an amazing view of the NY skyline. My SIL and I split the lobster Benedict and the bacche e banane toast (aka: french toast with vanilla mascarpone... was there going to be anything else I would've ordered)? The Benedict was wonderful! Lots of lobster and the hollandaise that was supposed to be cilantro flavored, just tasted like regular hollandaise, which is fine by me! OMG the french toast! I literally cannot even begin to describe how good it was. I have been thinking about that wonderful, sweet, creamy deliciousness ever since I came back to MN. The entire meal was exactly what brunch should be. Cozy, comforting, savory and a little sweet. The service was friendly and fast and the food was outstanding. And at the end of the meal my SIL got a free mug, courtesy of Turning Point, to wish her a happy Mother's Day! Let me summarize how good the food was: our little group was willing to wait for up to an hour with a 3 year old toddler who had not eaten breakfast yet and did not sleep through the night. Yes, it is that good.",Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"

We've has the grande huevos rancheros, the chicken quesadilla, and the he crabcake eggs benedict and they were all just great. The reason we haven't had more of their food is that, well, I love their huevos rancheros!!! They're HUGE and incredibly tasty!

510,Axw9FwbTQpRxQ1R7kQ6-1w,Dan B.,3.0 star rating,"Turning Point is a perfectly acceptable place to get breakfast/brunch/lunch in Hoboken, and based on the line that you will encounter on the weekend, many locals feel the same way. I have been to the Turning Point twice, and enjoyed my food both times. The pesto egg white skillet (it has a different name on the menu) was good, not great - the vegetables didn't seem like they were sauteed long enough, and therefore were watery and didn't add much to the dish. Uncooked onions in a breakfast platter doesn't do it for me.Second time I went, I got the stuffed French Toast, and this was quite good. A fruit/cream cheese mix was in between the slices of bread, which were sweet and cooked to perfection with a little crisp on the outside. When I return to Turning Point, I'll probably select this option again. There is also a very good tea menu, with many different flavors that aren't necessarily common to your local supermarket or tea shop. My experience in the restaurant has been worthy of 4 stars. The delivery experience, however, bumps them down. After placing an order with them ~9:30 AM, we called to get a status update an hour later (food hadn't arrived). They told us that they never received our order. While disappointed, we were told that the food would be prepared/delivered right away - fine. An hour later, and with still no food and patience running thing, the employee at Turning Point (the same one) was extremely apologetic and ensured us that we wouldn't be charged for the food. This, along with a coupon for two free dishes was a tremendous gesture that was well appreciated. Nonetheless, when the food came it was cold and the onions weren't cooked (kind of thinking that maybe they don't intend for them to be). Regardless, I wouldn't suggest take-out from Turning Point - last time I went to the restaurant, I sat at the diner and saw take-out orders sit up at the front for at least 30 minutes before they were taken by a delivery person - who knows how much longer it took to get to someone's door.Suggestions: Don't get delivery, eat at the restaurant. Get there early on weekends unless you want to wait. French Toast and Teas were very good.",Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"

515,CyqSLlNio-q9HtliTpm_Pw,Cindy C.,2.0 star rating,"I am a regular at Turning Point, in fact, there used to be a time over a period of two years when we would go every weekend - either take-out or eat-in but since the last two bad experiences, we haven't really been back.  There is always a number of empty tables but a ton of people waiting. The host/hostess is empowered to do nothing useful; when you call in advance, the person who answers the phone always says the wait is less than it actually is and when you ask to put your name on the ""call ahead"" list, it doesn't ever make it to the host/hostess. When you complain, they do absolutely nothing for you. One time, we asked to place a take-out in person when the wait got too long; I was told to do it from my phone instead (I was standing in the restaurant literally two feet away from the register, really?!?). Additionally, the restaurant looks like it needs a full scrub through and paint job. It is getting run down, dirty looking, and the tables, floors, and seats are sticky. If you can look past all of this, then generally the service is okay once you sit down and the food options are plentiful, hearty, and homey. It's too bad that one needs to go through a ton of frustration before you can get to the food. Despite many surveys they have emailed me asking for feedback and the countless number of times I have shared this feedback, I have yet to see improvement. After years of coming here since they opened, I am finally fed up. I hope change comes soon, it is such a disappointment for a restaurant in a great location with great food.",Turning Point of Hoboken,3.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch"
