It's all about balance in life! There's something here for everyone and vegetable market sides for the veggie lover and for the veggie resistant. Who doesn't love crispy hot sweet potato fries?? Hudson Westville is the more spacious sister restaurant of the Westville's popping up all over lower Manhattan. Even better than not being elbow to elbow compared to the LES, 10th St, and Chelsea locations... the wait is only 20 minutes during prime evening hours!! And you can wait with a beer or cocktail by the bar instead of crowding outside on the sidewalk! Here's what we ordered:- Salmon w/ 2 sides: Salmon grilled simple. My sides were roasted artichokes (love love artichokes and especially when I don't have to be the one cleaning and poking myself with the hidden thorns inside!) and oyster mushrooms with chimichurri (i can eat shrooms all day. the chimichurri was more oil than cilantro/parsley, so I liked it because I love mushrooms, but I probably wouldn't order it again)- Steak sandwich: Oozy cheese, medium rare steak (I love a steak with the fat along the edges. This had a little too much fat on the sides, a little trim would've been preferred)- Side of artichokes: So maybe I scarfed down my artichoke side a little too quickly and had to order another plate of it... nothing wrong with that, right??Overall, the service here was friendly and spot on. Waitress was kind and cheery. It was a chilly, windy winter night in NYC and she didn't mind that we asked to switch our table away from the window. I work not so far from this location, so this location just might become my go to for the space and less wait. By the way, did I mention they take reservations??

There is indoor and outdoor seating/ bar seating/private and shared table seating. The tables are extremely close to each other so this isn't the place to go if you want something quiet and private. The service isn't the best. Ive been here on multiple occasions and have had to ask for things like water, hot sauce, and to have my drink refilled multiple times before actually having it done. I hope that it's just because they're usually busy when I go. This time I have the market side with the chicken cutlet. It was wonderful as always. The chicken was hot and crispy.

It's all about balance in life! There's something here for everyone and vegetable market sides for the veggie lover and for the veggie resistant. Who doesn't love crispy hot sweet potato fries?? Hudson Westville is the more spacious sister restaurant of the Westville's popping up all over lower Manhattan. Even better than not being elbow to elbow compared to the LES, 10th St, and Chelsea locations... the wait is only 20 minutes during prime evening hours!! And you can wait with a beer or cocktail by the bar instead of crowding outside on the sidewalk! Here's what we ordered:- Salmon w/ 2 sides: Salmon grilled simple. My sides were roasted artichokes (love love artichokes and especially when I don't have to be the one cleaning and poking myself with the hidden thorns inside!) and oyster mushrooms with chimichurri (i can eat shrooms all day. the chimichurri was more oil than cilantro/parsley, so I liked it because I love mushrooms, but I probably wouldn't order it again)- Steak sandwich: Oozy cheese, medium rare steak (I love a steak with the fat along the edges. This had a little too much fat on the sides, a little trim would've been preferred)- Side of artichokes: So maybe I scarfed down my artichoke side a little too quickly and had to order another plate of it... nothing wrong with that, right??Overall, the service here was friendly and spot on. Waitress was kind and cheery. It was a chilly, windy winter night in NYC and she didn't mind that we asked to switch our table away from the window. I work not so far from this location, so this location just might become my go to for the space and less wait. By the way, did I mention they take reservations??

There is indoor and outdoor seating/ bar seating/private and shared table seating. The tables are extremely close to each other so this isn't the place to go if you want something quiet and private. The service isn't the best. Ive been here on multiple occasions and have had to ask for things like water, hot sauce, and to have my drink refilled multiple times before actually having it done. I hope that it's just because they're usually busy when I go. This time I have the market side with the chicken cutlet. It was wonderful as always. The chicken was hot and crispy.

These places have a calculated recipe of a casual clean yuppy feel where nothing is offensive and most everything is comfortable.  I arrived right before closing and it was pretty empty.   I never like to order 30 minutes before closing.  Case in point my burger arrived with overly cooked and dark sweet potato fries.  They were moments away from being burnt.  I struggled through a few bites and then examined my burger - The bottom bun was pretty black.  Hey at least they put it upside down. The waitress came over and agreed that it looked bad and took it to be remedied.The fries came back redone and with a new bottom bun.  Still it didn't taste as wonderful as the Chelsea Location always does.  I had a glass of rosé that was full strawberry note and not too sweet.  I liked it.  It was a good pour for $9.My bill was $30, an up charge for the sweet potato fries for $2 resulted in a $17 burger.That was a sucker punch.  With a $5 tip, my late night snack was $35.Westville normally puts out a good product, but this visit was a C, especially in terms of value.  The veggie plate is also around $17, so plan on $30 pp with a drink tax and tip.",Westville Hudson,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

We had a 6:45pm reservation but had some stragglers so we ended up getting seated closer to 7:15pm--totally fair on their part though. We were in time for happy hour which had $6 (or was it $7?) margaritas that were tasty and sufficiently strong. We got a bowl of fries to share. The quantity was large enough for a group of 7 to each have like 6-7 fries eat. Each fry was perfectly crisp, thick, and hot. 10/10 fries would recommend. I had the fish sandwich which was excellent. The fish tasted fresh and was fried until perfectly crispy. I thought they went a bit heavy on the cole slaw though. The salad it came with had a strong taste of dill I think. It was kind of strange for a salad and reminded me a lot of Ikea for some reason... like it probably would have went better with smoked salmon instead of a fried fish sandwich.  This is probably one of the best meals value wise though. I was a lot fuller than my friends who ordered market plates full of veggies. Speaking of market plates, I got to taste some of their's. Overall the vegetables are nice, no complaints. I don't think they're amazing though and are also quite pricy for what they are. I would have rather gotten a veggie bowl from Dig Inn but that's just me.

I signal to the waiter and he comes over and asks how everyone is doing.  Really.  I ask him if he can check our orders.  He comes back to confirm what we ordered.  Something tells me our orders were never placed.  No apologies.  The order finally arrives.  The avocado toast is cardboard.  It has an egg on top which when you try to take a bite, it all falls apart and onto your lap because the toast is so hard.  No flavor.  There were flies all over the place in addition to some bug that was encroaching into my personal space on the floor.  It was disgusting.  You may be right next to my office, but my colleagues and I have better options.",Westville Hudson,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

After the appetizers, I have tried both their breakfast options and lunch options (another reason this is a great place is they seem to always have their regular menu and a brunch special menu which gives your party a choice between eggs / waffles and burgers / sandwiches). I have had their egg sandwich, breakfast burrito, hamburger, veggie burger and they have all been very good and I have walked away more than full.

Even if you're not a vegetarian, the 4 market side platter for $15 is such an awesome deal - so many veggies to choose from, and ridiculously generous portions too. I'm a sucker for their sweet potato fries. For brunch, I went a little unorthodox and ordered the granola with fruit and the watermelon with feta and mint. I like my granola loaded with nuts and honey, and I was especially pleased to see entire globs of honey left over in my bowl. The watermelon salad was nice and refreshing on a hot Saturday morning, but it's something I could easily make myself. Next time I'll go back to my old stand-by of sweet potato fries. This location is somewhat out of the way, but they do take reservations off OpenTable (does anyone else not bother going to restaurants that don't accept reservations? There's enough good food in the city that unless the place is seriously awesome, I'm not wasting time standing in line for it), and our waitress was really sweet.

Overall, the food here is ideal if you're getting shared plates but is also ideal if you want to eat your own food. The food came out quickly, and the service was great. We never felt rushed. Furthermore, even though we were a group of 8 and asked a lot of questions, our server was on-point. She was patient, pleasant, and got our order right. I also really enjoyed every dessert we ordered (vanilla ice cream, an orange-colored sorbet, a chocolate lava cake, an apple pie and a whoopie pie). However, my absolute favorite desserts are a tie between the vanilla ice cream and the chocolate lava cake. Moreover, the restaurant was very clean, and the decor was classy. This particular location would work very well as a date spot. My only complaint is that they didn't bring out ketchup for my side of the table (for the truffle fries).

Not a problem since we were able to sit at the bar and have drinks while we waited for our table. We were told the wait would be 15-20 minutes, and after about 20 the hostess came over and told us it would be another 10-15 because she was waiting for a group to close out their check. After she left, I joked that we were just going to end up sitting at a table that had been empty the entire time, and sure enough that's what ended up happening. Seems like the reservation system wasn't quite working on this particular night, but it may just have been because of the holiday.For dinner, we had truffle fries, two market plates, and I had the minestrone. The truffle fries were excellent, but the minestrone had almost no flavor. One saving grace is that our waiter brought hot sauce to the table. The market plates were the worst part of the evening. This is the thing about Westville we always look forward to, but unfortunately all the vegetables were undercooked and poorly seasoned. I dream about the honey dijon Brussels sprouts here, but this time they were crunchy, not at all caramelized, and had an off flavor.Maybe it's just this location as the other experiences I've had have all been excellent, but especially given how quiet the restaurant was, you would think they could have at least cooked our veggies for a few more minutes!",Westville Hudson,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

The bad: for a restaurant chain that is non for its vegetables and ""market plates"" I was hugely disappointed. At first I couldn't choose which veggies to order because they all sounded so good. Now I'm not sure if I go back if I'll even order a market plate again. I ordered brussel sprouts, zucchini, and artichokes. Many of my vegetables were crunchy and raw.

There were candles lit on each table. The Westville has all local market foods. I'm going to say 90% of their menu they get from the local markets in town. At least that's how they had it advertised. They did have a really big chalkboard with bright vibrant colors on it that had all of the side dishes listed and it was all organic market food sides. There was about 25 different things on their side menus and all of them were made from scratch.  They have a full bar inside. With a happy hour and drink specials listed. The food here is very goodI think that they should be very proud that they get all of their products from the local market. I ended up getting the lamb burger with some kind of Greek homemade sauce with organic mashed potatoes with pesto infusion. My burger was cooked perfectly. The mashed potatoes were delicious pesto is not overpowering it all and you can taste the difference when it's organic. One of my friends ended up getting the salad that had grilled chicken on it and they said it was very good. I ended up coming here around 930 and there was two people just sitting at the bar having drinks there was a Cute couple that was at their table just having dinner in a conversation and all the way in the corner there was a group of five or six people that were just having drinks having a good time. The Westfield us close at 11 o'clock we were the last ones out of the restaurant we left around 1120 and the staff actually followed out behind us. The stuff here is very nice the girl looked like she had been working here for a while or she was part owner of the Westville. I asked her some questions about the organic items that they had featured she was able to answer all of my questions without having to go behind the counter and say let me check she was very knowledgeable. Overall if you're in the village I do recommend coming here especially for a burger or just for a drink. I will definitely be back here if I'm in the village it's a good spot and I really did enjoy the food.

119,Jisa-dpDRyKhR_6YbNbWaw,Alexandra L.,4.0 star rating,"The Quick: Larger than life salads and other healthy delicious entrees.. Yum! The Details: Every time I've eaten at Westville or ordered to go, the food has been consistently fantastic. As someone who is always trying to lose 5 pounds, it can be difficult to find salad options that also fulfill my Italian girl cravings. The Greek salad with grilled chicken lives up to that standard. The dressing is homemade and fantastic, the chicken has a great flavor, and the salad is filled with fresh veggies. It also comes with a side of delicious garlic bread covered in a goat cheese of sorts. I've had the salad four times now (clearly some sort of addiction) and each time it's been great and larger than life. I can usually have a full meal and still have some leftovers-- from a salad, who knew that was possible? I love the idea of the veggie market sides. I've had the plantains which were great, the brussels sprouts   which were pretty good, and the butternut squash which was delicious. For lunch, I think the sides are a little pricey to get with a salad. For dinner, it's a great option to split with friends. The Damage: For lunch you could probably spend between $12 and $15. It is a little pricey however as I mentioned the portions are huge, the food is actually filling, and you still feel good about eating it because it's healthy and made with great (low calorie) ingredients.

And SOMEONE needs to address the misconception!!In theory it sounds like they have a great farm-to-table game. But, in reality, everything is over salted, heavily oiled, and basically just a glorified Dig Inn. I ordered the market plate and had the oyster mushrooms, sautéed kale, broccoli, butternut squash, plus grilled chicken on the side. Have you ever swished salt water around in your mouth to heel a cut or a pulled wisdom tooth?Well two bites of the chicken had the same fizzy effect on my mouth as swishing with salt water. I mean, drink a bottle of soy sauce and you'd be intaking less sodium than the chicken here. The veggies, not a lot I can say for them either. The only difference from the chicken is they were doused in oil. I love olive oil. But I don't need to drink it with dinner. One veggie was 100% inedible: the butternut squash. IT WAS CANNED SQUASH!! Are you joking??? Even the local salad bar bodegas don't use canned squash. Come on. They must've thought that adding way too much sugar would've disguised that fact, but no. That sh*t was canned as a tuna at food bazaar in Bushwick.All said and done, if I wanted salty and oily I'd go to the fried chicken guy down the street from me.

Service is quick and attentive (frequent refilling of our waters and clearing of plates). We got the Westville cobb salad and the watercress-arugula salad with a side of 4 market sides: brussels sprouts, butternut squash, green peas and mixed mushrooms. The salads are pretty big and filling, although I thought the cobb salad had too much dressing and the lettuce was wilted. The pears in the watercress-arugula salad were a nice touch, also a bit too much oil for my taste. Next time, I'd ask for the dressing on the side or half dressing. The sides were great and in generous portions as well. My boyfriend really loves the peas and bacon, and I love mushroom anything. The highlight of the meal is probably the dessert! We got the berry rhubarb pie and it's perfect! The perfect balance of sweet and tart, served hot with a cold scoop of vanilla ice cream.

173,ZqIzbOuM9m13TquNdoLVkw,Christopher K.,5.0 star rating,"What an incredible gem to randomly discover after a long walk uptown from the World Trade Center one recent morning!I had arrived in the City early for a day of meetings at our ad agency near the Holland Tunnel. With over an hour to kill, I was on the hunt for a decent, sit-down breakfast. Having trolled Tribeca for many years, I knew my options for breakfast would be limited to your typical pretentious and expensive joints, where the food generally isn't even that good. So I walked. And I walked. And I walked some more. I even crossed Canal Street. (I never cross Canal Street.) And then I walked even more. At 8:59am I stumbled upon an adorable corner restaurant boasting a breakfast menu. They were just opening, and in I went, the whole place to myself. My virgin voyage to Westville had begun.The space is beautiful. High ceilings, nice light from the outside, very welcoming decor. My server was absolutely awesome. Service with a smile. Whatever I needed, whenever I needed it. I started with an iced coffee, and it was probably the best coffee I have had in the City since moving out of Brooklyn, home to the greatest coffee in the world. Talk about starting things off right.Looking at the menu, my eyes immediately went to the breakfast scrambles, which can be served as a platter, or as a sandwich. I think they started at $6.95, which includes 3 ingredients. I ordered the scramble with salami, fresh mozzarella, and spinach, on whole grain bread. When it arrived, it was absolute perfection. The eggs were cooked perfectly, deliciously seasoned, and chock full of all the goodies inside. The Tapatio hot sauce on the side complemented the dish wonderfully. And the ingredients were so incredibly fresh, you could taste them in every bite.At this price, Westville must be using breakfast as an effective loss leader, because without a doubt I will be coming back for breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner at any chance I get. There are crappy delis in the area that will charge that much or more for an awful breakfast sandwich. And many more fancy restaurants in Tribeca where this dish would have cost $20 or more. You'd be nuts not to eat breakfast here instead.Can't wait to come back. Makes me miss the City big time.",Westville Hudson,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I've been there twice. The first visit was service from a pretty little liar look-a-like, and cauliflower dijonaisse. If I were to ever remember side dishes, this would be in my top five. It's truly symphonic the way whole little dish comes together: A sweet and tart dijon sauce over mild cauliflower that is caramelized, I like to say brûléed, to a delicious crisp. The second visit was all about the special sandwich that day, a whitefish sandwich with a lemon and herb mayo and a pleasantly sour coleslaw. So good that I practically inhaled it.

The spouse went with the shakshouka, which she pronounced as a bit too spicy, for me a bit too mild. The feinschmecker went with a kale salad, to which she added avocado and chicken, making it a bit pricey for the portion size.

194,AFrPaBwygwnITWowVRQZpw,Evan r.,1.0 star rating,"This is one of those reviews that end with an owner calling to apologize. It's a story of hunger, lies, and a restaurant ignoring its end of the buyer/seller contract. It's long, but a lot happens when you're waiting 2 hours for delivery from a restaurant that's only 5 blocks away. I placed my order at 12:27 PM. It was nothing crazy, just a burger, the salmon plate, a couple salads, and chicken fingers to share. The system told me the food would arrive in 30 minutes. I believed it. Why would the system lie? What could it possibly have to gain?12:57 PM came and went with no food. Not a big deal, I thought. 30 minutes was a pretty aggressive promise. Twenty more minutes passed. The meeting I was supposed to provide food for was slowing down. People were hungry and my choice of Westville was starting to make me look foolish. I grabbed my phone and excused myself from the room.""Let me check on that for you,"" the nice lady on the phone said after I gave her my order details. ""I'm really sorry about that. There was a problem in the kitchen but your food's on the way. My manager said he's putting a $20 credit on your account because of the wait.""""Oh wow, thanks."" I didn't call to complain, so the free money was a nice touch. It didn't solve the problem, though, so I asked just to be sure. ""But my food is on the way?""""Yes, it just went out the door.""""Awesome. Thanks so much.""I hung up and shared the good news. The relief that flooded the room slowly dissipated as five minutes passed. Then ten. Then twenty. At 22 minutes passed the time I was told our food was out the door, I called back.""Hold please,"" she said, her voice less cheery than it was the first time we spoke. She came back and said there was nothing she could do. ""Your food left. The driver is out.""""Right. He was out about 30 minutes ago. I'm 5 blocks away. Shouldn't it be here by now?""""He probably went a different route and just hasn't gotten to you yet. He'll get there.""""Can you check where he is?""""No.""""Ok. Great. Thanks for your help. You guys are doing great today.""The call ended and I gave my team the unfortunate update that we were still screwed. There were eye rolls and groans, and a few questions as to why I chose Westville. I found myself wondering the same thing so I just shrugged and said the food would be there soon. That's what the lady said. Why would she lie?32 minutes later, a full hour-and-forty-plus minutes after the order was originally placed and 54 minutes after I was first told the food went out the door from a restaurant a mere 5 blocks away, I called back. The lady did not even pretend to be pleasant when I asked what was going on. She just told me to hold and passed me on to the manager.""Hi,"" he said. ""I'm really sorry about this, but your food should be there soon.""""Right. That's what I was told about an hour ago. What's going on?""""We're really slammed today, but it's on the way.""""Dude. My office is five blocks away from you guys. I was told the food was out the door an hour ago. Can you give me an update?""""It's still in the kitchen. It hasn't left yet.""""Excuse me?""""The food still needs to be cooked.""I sat in silence while the words bubbled around in my head.""I don't know who told her to tell you the food left,"" he continued, ""but she shouldn't have said that.""""It hasn't left yet?"" I may have lost it a bit right there. I could tell because everyone in my corner of the office stopped working to watch me yell-speak into the phone. ""Two hours after ordering and it hasn't left yet?""There were other words said, but there's no need to share them. I'm proud to say I didn't curse, but I was far from happy. The manager did little to assuage my anger, instead choosing to play the ""Dude, I don't want to deal with you and I'm only on the phone because I don't trust the phone lady enough to handle this"" card.Our call ended with me calling him the worst person in the world. I didn't really believe that. There are many people way worse than him. But I was feeling dramatic.The owner called me an hour later to apologize. He defended the restaurant, saying a chef walked out and they were slammed and he's sorry I had to wait so long I felt the need to cancel my order.""I get that,"" I said. ""Stuff happens. But if that's the case, your employee shouldn't tell me she watched the food go out the door when it still hasn't left the kitchen. And she shouldn't tell me it's still on the way when I call back twenty minutes later.""He feigned surprise. No one told him about the lies, he said. He was very apologetic, said all the right things, and offered to make things right by my team, but the damage was already done. It's one thing to place an order and for a restaurant to get it wrong, or for them to overcook an item. Those things happen. They're simply human error. But to lie? That's not an error.

I had a brunch reservation for 6 at 2:30PM. After checking in five minutes before my reservation, I was told to wait a little bit while they took care of some things. Ok - that's usual. I waited for the rest of my group to arrive. There was a group of 6 that was waiting before me (although their full group came after my group all arrived). They were seated before us - by then, it was already 20 minutes past my reservation time. Definitely irked at this point. Why did a group of 6 get seated before me when I had reservations and they did not? Turns out, the hostess got things wrong and did not realize I had a reservation and gave it to someone else? There were two parties of 6 with names starting with C. Another staff member apologized profusely - told us they were trying to rush others out as much as they could so we could get seated.Long story short, by the time we sat down, it was over an hour past my reservation time (waited probably 75 mins). With such a mix-up, the least they could have done was offer us free drinks or appetizers for the long wait. I understand mix-ups.. but apologizing 4x and rushing others was not going to fix anything (and we were all beyond HANGRY at this point!)Definitely will not be returning here - unfortunately since the food was good (although - they ran out of the eggs benedict, my go-to brunch order!

I took advantage of happy hour from 4-8 with a cup (didn't serve wine in glasses) of  pinot grigio  ($6). We started off with calamari as an appetizer. The calamari was fresh and crisp- definetly top notch fried calamari. My main course was a compilation of four vegetables  ($17). Sesame tofu and broccoli, Brussels sprouts with Dijon, chipotle roasted butternut squash and mushrooms. I would advise asking if they could use a lighter hand on the seasonings- the tofu and broccoli was salty enough that I downed the entire water pitcher/bottle, and the mushrooms were also seasoned with salt (couldn't taste anything else). Table for a two but four or even seven are possible. There's a nice bar area and candles are lit on the tables for ambience. I would describe this as a good place to catch up with friends or have a exciting social company outing. Definetly not for those who want a quiet dinner. One star off for the extreme saltiness.

221,TZBJr76Cq-9vYwT33i1PUQ,Jackie J.,4.0 star rating,"Came with a group Saturday afternoon. Light, open space with a family-friendly vibe (read: kids crying and running around). It was still a relief not to be packed into an overly trendy brunch spot. 3 or 4 servers worked together to take care of us and kept the water, lemons, and napkins stocked. My boyfriend and I shared the market plate and veggie burger with fries. The artichoke hearts, fennel, collard greens, and watermelon salad were delicious. My expectations were too high for the veggie burger, based on all the best-I-ever-had rave reviews. The patty is made in house and fried, so it's fresh with a nice crunch. However, the inside isn't studded with veggies. It kind of tastes and looks like mashed potatoes (the base could be other starchy veggies or legumes), and there were no greens mixed in. So it was a fried, white starch burger on a white bun with fries, and ended up being too heavy and guilty. The fries are amazing, though: breaded, seasoned, and cooked perfectly. For dessert the table split the strawberry rhubarb pie with vanilla ice cream. The filling was well balanced and tasty; my friends thought it was too tart, but that's how I like my rhubarb. The crust had the right ratio of flour, fat, and salt but was not as tender or flaky as it could have been; the top and bottom were waxy and the edge was tough. (To avoid these textures, the chef should cut in the butter ice cold and keep the dough as cold as possible until baking.) With tax and tip, it came out to $20/person and was a lovely experience.

Surprising let downs for me were the macaroni and cheese (made me feel stupid full without the ""but it was worth it part"") and the fennel. I KNOW I KNOW, I'm in the minority on both counts, so you should probably try them anyway. Foodies, don't come for me.They also have great drink specials and festive little happy hour numbers.

I split an organic mixed green salad  as an appetizer with my brother and for $7 it was humongous! The dressing wasn't over bearing and we added sweet roasted walnuts which was a nice touch.The main course did not fail to impress. Westville is known for it's healthy food so naturally I went for the grilled marinated chicken breast. You get to choose two sides, so I opted for the sweet mashed potatoes (beyond delicious, seriously probably the best i've ever had) and  zucchini w/ cherry tomatoes & mozzarella (a nice take on a normally boring side). The chicken was thin and juicy.. Seriously if you have little kids who need an imaginative spin on vegetables come here!For desert, my friend who was just drinking beer decided to order 4  market sides for $15. This was one of the most unusual deserts ever but here are my thoughts:1)  brussels sprouts w/ honey dijon: I don't like brussels sprouts and it was quite edible in this situation,  2)  sauteed broccoli w/ garlic: wow, like the sweet mashed potatoes maybe the best I've ever had in the broccoli department.3)  lemon grilled asparagus w/ Parmesan: the parmesan was perfect.4)  artichoke with parmesan cheese:  great comboI will most certainly be coming back here or ordering out since I live near here.",Westville Hudson,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

While some of their other locations can be cramped and hard to get a table, this one is a nice size and you're able to make a reservation in advance. It can probably seat about 75 people, and you have room to push out your chair a bit, unlike some of their other locations! I like Westville as it's not exclusively vegetarian, but it's also not one of those places that only has a hummus option for vegetarians, with everything else being meat-heavy. It has relatively simple dishes that please meat, fish and vegetarian eaters alike! Prices were pretty good for fresh food with relatively generous servings.Service here was good - not overbearing but they checked up on us and served both drinks and food promptly. My parents had beer and wine and both were satisfied with their choices.To eat, many at the table ordered an entrée (a sandwich or piece of fish, etc.), but my mom, sister and I split three veggie plates (with many seasonal options available). This gave us a chance to try a lot of food and eat relatively healthy while still getting quite full and enjoying lots of flavor! Others as the table were also satisfied with their entrees. On the vegetable plates we had the following:Artichoke hearts w/ parmesan (we got the parmesan on the side) - I love artichoke in just about any form and this was great! Nice grilled flavor to these with a bit of a lemony finish.Lemon grilled asparagus - Nice and tangy! Again, grilled to perfection with a bit of seasoning and a fair amount (though not an overwhelming amount) of lemon.Asian style bok choy - A bit heavy on the sauce but not in a bad way. The bok choy was well-seasoned with the Asian-style marinade, giving it great flavor.Brussels sprouts w/ honey dijon - Another vegetable I'm a huge fan of! The honey dijon added a terrific kick (again, without being overpowering to the vegetable itself), to these delicious roasted Brussels. The Brussels themselves were quite large too and there was a good amount of them.Cauliflower dijonaise - The disjonaise had a nice, bold flavor. While I love the taste of raw cauliflower, I know many don't. This disjonaise elevates the cauliflower to a level that even most cauliflower haters would probably find appealing, as you taste more of the dijonaise in every bite, rather than the cauliflower.Soy glazed green beans - Relatively classic. Nothing standout here but solid coating of soy on the green beans with every bite.Snow peas w/ sesame & ginger - Similar to the above soy green beans, sesame and ginger are really the stars here. The snow peas themselves were good and in season, but the sesame and ginger are the main tastes, and a great combo.Oven roasted mushrooms - Another vegetable favorite! These were seasoned with a simple blend of spices and cooked to perfection. Fantastic texture and flavor in these. Again, simple yet executed terrifically. Zucchini w/ cherry tomatoes & mozzarella (we got the mozzarella on the side) - Nothing too fancy here. I think the mozzarella would've added something more, but my sister opted for the cheese on the side. The vegetables were both in season and so lots of their natural flavor shone through. Prepared and seasoned quite basically but well.Seitan, artichokes and chickpeas in a lemon turmeric sauce - This was great - I could've eaten a whole plate of it! It was served in a small side dish/boat on the plate, so as not to mix with the other vegetables on the plate. It was more of a stew than a side. Seitan, artichokes and chickpeas were all steeped in the delicious lemon turmeric sauce. The turmeric really bumped the lemon up a notch. Everything was warm and while the flavors worked well together, they still maintained their own independent strong flavors.Broccoli rabe w/ cherry tomatoes and parmesan (we got the parmesan on the side) - Love broccoli rabe for its bitter flavor. It combined nice with the sweet, tart bite of the cherry tomatoes. The seasoning on the broccoli was killer - pungent yet not overpowering the fantastic vegetable!Soy glazed tofu w/ broccoli and sesame - I'm not a big tofu fan when its flavor rings out, I prefer it masked in a sauce or marinade. This side delivered well in that department. The soy glaze flavors the tofu and the tofu was cooked so it truly melted in your mouth. The broccoli and sesame also had a fun Chinese-food flavor theme to them that paired nicely with the tofu.",Westville Hudson,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

This time, I decided to try something new and got the grilled marinated chicken breast + 2 sides. For their sides, I've tried their brussels sprouts (nicely marinated and full of flavor), mashed potatoes (pretty standard), and sweet potato fries (crunchy and yummy). As much as I would like to try other sides, I always get the same ones because they're that good. If you want a healthier option, I highly recommend their greek salad. I'm usually unsatisfied with getting salad for dinner, but this one was a game changer. I would totally eat the salad as a meal.Of course, there's always room for dessert. I shared a slice of pumpkin pie with mint choice ice cream. Yes, it's not the most ideal combo, but it was still yummy.

249,GC7ow6LnrCuJBqiiRbYdkg,Lauren S.,5.0 star rating,"I reminisced. I analyzed. I re-studied the menu. After all of that, I could not come up with ONE reason why Westville did not deserve a five-star rating. It exceeded all my standards and met all my criteria for the definition of ""perfect."" The restaurant has the feel of an airy converted warehouse with ample natural light and an open floor plan. The big space offers plenty of seating, and they are spaced out quite nicely. The tables near us were close enough that I could admire their food, but far enough away that I couldn't hear their conversations. Again, perfect.And that MENU! Let me start by saying they have an entire page devoted to freaking vegetables. Is this real life? Did I really find a restaurant that values the green goods as much as I do? And it gets better: you can swap in ANY of those veggie sides for the french fries that come with the burgers/entrees. Win.Which brings me to my next point. The staff was so incredibly accommodating and open to all of our requests. Broccoli instead of fries? Sure! Tartar sauce on the side? Of course! Add avocado? Yep! Additionally, our orders were taken promptly, our food came quickly, and we were ""checked on"" afterwards. Perfecto.But the real reason Westville deserves 5 stars is the quality of their food. I discovered this eatery by searching ""best veggie burger,"" and I can see why. It was crispy, flavorful, and wedged between a beautifully toasted Portugese roll. Furthermore, they cooked the broccoli perfectly, which isn't always an easy feat.And just in case I haven't convinced you of their superiority yet, they serve Magners Irish cider and it's only $5, so...you should probably hurry up and take yourself to Westville.",Westville Hudson,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I came here for lunch on a Tuesday at one - we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. I had the grilled salmon, which was under the entrees section, but was absolutely a salad - not sure why it wasn't under salads.Anyways, it was fine - the dressing was okay, the salmon was cooked fine and the greens were mostly fresh (I picked out a few gross looking pieces). It was loud and busy and our waiter seemed a bit flustered - he dropped one of our forks on the floor as he cleared out dishes, which like echoed throughout the restaurant.I didn't think there was anything good about this restaurant to come back for - I was really disappointed because I had heard such great things. Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish - I won't be back to find out.I kept half my salad as leftovers and ate it the next day. At that point, it was basically inedible, which surprised me, as I often eat salad leftovers the next day.

Bf had the burger with fries (he says they tasted like oreida fries meaning the ready made frozen kind). I had a salad which was described as being served on a baguette with melted goat cheese. The goat cheese was just soft cheese, not melted as in hot. The baguette was two tiny slices of burnt toast served with the salad. The salad was big. It tasted okay but nothing memorable. The herbed goat cheese on the toast was the best part of the meal. Had to ask for a fork, napkins and ketchup after our meal was served.The outdoor seating is right on the street and we had an unpleasant experience of a beggar coming up to our table and yelling at us.

We got there before 12pm, so there was plenty of open tables and we got seated right away. The restaurant itself is a nice large size, so if we ever come back with the kids, then there would be no problems with bringing the stroller I think. The waitress was very nice, and was great about refilling our coffee cups throughout our brunch.I ordered the eggs benedict, which included sauteed asparagus and mashed potatoes. Great seasoning, and the eggs were perfect. My wife ordered the challah French Toast, which had great flavor as well, extremely reasonable prices.I think that this place really shines with the ""Market sides"", which is predominantly side vegetable dishes that are either offered individually, or you can get a plate consisting of four of the side options. We ended up getting the four-side option and chose herb polenta fries, oven baked mushrooms, sweet potato fries, and sauteed cherry tomatoes. All of these tasted great, cooked and seasoned very well. There were many other sides to choose from, which gives us multiple excuses to come back again.Ultimately, I was deciding between going to Jane (which can get very crowded), and this one, and in the end, I think that we made a great choice.",Westville Hudson,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I Instagrammed my food.  It looked amazing on the plate and tasted even better.  I guess the lemon was for the chicken, but I thought it was fantastic just plain.  Like my friend, I had enough for a second meal and we both decided to take the leftovers home.  Our waitress checked in on us once right after we got our food.  After that, we didn't need anything so we didn't mind/notice that she never came back.  Once we were finished with our meals though, it took a while to find her.  We asked a couple of other servers who passed by if they could either ask her to come by or at least hand off the check, and it still took a little while after that the get the check.  We saw her waiting on a huge table, we got it, no big deal... we just had to leave to catch our show.  On a regular night, it would have been a pleasure to eat our meals and relax for a little while after without being rushed out, but we had someplace to be so we were kind of anxious.  The devastating part?  We both had our leftovers wrapped and a guy came to the table and held up one bag.  ""Chicken?"" he said.  ""That's me!"" I said.  I don't think I have to go into long detail here... you know what happened.  I was so upset the next night when I opened the second half of my delicious food  and found my friends beets.  YUCK!  :(",Westville Hudson,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

So I was so surprised how well-executed our impromptu brunch here was!!!!!!We ordered their burrito, burger and a side of roasted artichoke hearts. Everything was so delicious. The burrito was very flavorful and it came with chorizo mashed potatoes that bumped up the flavor even more. The burger was served on a gorgeous Portuguese roll that soaked up the juices from the thick patty so well. The burger was cooked exactly medium rare and they even indulged my love of eggs by allowing me to add a fried egg to my burger. The fries that came with the burger were addictively crunchy. The only knock I have is the artichoke hearts (albeit generous and meaty) which had way too much lemon going on them, too puckery!!!This place is very kid-friendly, our 1 year old was offered crayons and a coloring sheet as well as a cup of water with a straw without our asking.Well done the Westville team!",Westville Hudson,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

And I don't generally like fried foods at all.  But no matter what you order, the food is always fresh and the portions are big enough to share.

A chopped salad with a vast array of veggies, pumpkin seeds, flavorful chicken and a chili lime vinaigrette.  Ya ya, everyone makes a chopped salad.  Well, there was one other item that made it truly memorable. Dare I say...magical even.  Wee little golden cubes were smattered about the plate.  I, as everyone else, assumed these were potatoes that had been flash fried or another root veg of the sort.  But alas, as I take a bite I realize NAY! (I did yell that in my head)  These are not a common filthy vegetable.... these golden cubes of awesomeness were fried halloumi cheese.  HALLOUMI CHEESE!  I immediately realized I had made a careless mistake of uttering that entirely to loud. Conversations ceased...the beady eyes of 11 members of technical support fixated on my plate.  I immediately assumed the stance one would have guarding their food in prison (don't ask how I know that) as the frenzy of forks headed my way.  It wasn't pretty...friends turned on one another attempting to grab just one cube of my coveted treat while I defended my lunch like a ninja, wielding my cutlery at any sweaty hand that came my way.  You don't know what sorrow is until you see a grown man from the web development team crying because he can't have some of your cheese.  Sooooo, ya, give Westville a try some time",Westville Hudson,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

We sat at the bar so I can't comment on waiter service, but the bartenders were great - they made good recommendations and were super friendly. As for the sides, each was awesome. We split the sweet potatoes fries, the plantains, the lemon asparagus and the zucchini with mozzarella and tomato. Each was very tasty. The price was reasonable (at least for downtown NYC standards) for two mimosas and splitting the 4 sides (about $30).  We also split a really yummy whoopie pie.Overall great chill ambience, food and service.

Although their brunch specials sounded great, I was more in the mood for a beer than eggs.After reviewing the extensive list of market veggie choices, we decided to split the 4 veggie plate and a burger.The roasted beets with goat cheese were great. Couldn't quite figure out what herb was in the cheese, but it provided a nice bright flavor that complimented the tang of the cheese and sweetness of the beets.The Asian bok choy was good, but not evenly seasoned. One bite very flavorful and the next a little bland. The grilled Mediterranean salad was delicious, with a light char that gave a nice smokey taste. It was the first either of us had tried broccoli rabe and it was OK, but not a favorite. All the veggies were well prepared, not over cooked.While the market plate would have been plenty for both of us, we still had the burger in front of us... The pattie was a bit thicker than either of us prefer, but we were pleasantly surprised by how tender and juicy it was.

I work across the street and there is almost no other place in the area to sit and eat. I thought the space Westville moved into was haunted. Every other restaurant that was there tanked. Then again, they weren't Westville. The food here is just as awesome as the other locations. I've been to this location 4 times since it's opening and their service just keeps getting better.  If you get there after 12:15 expect a little wait, but it's worth it.

404,YPp36lsDC42E2MH6e1_RMg,Tara O.,5.0 star rating,"By far one of my favorite 'food' restaurants in NYC.   If you're hungry and looking for a good meal, it is impossible to go wrong at Westville.  I've been to all of the NYC locations (original in the west village, east village, chelsea, and this newest location in the south village) and the menu is the same across the board; there is something for everyone.  The cast iron turkey burger is hands down one of the best burgers (beef, turkey, or otherwise) I've ever had.  The salads are GINORMOUS (you'll definitely be bringing home leftovers) and the brunch menu (though not served during the week,  :(  ) is unreal.  Regardless of what you order, you'll need to get a market plate to start/share.  The market plate consists of your choice of 4 seasonal veggie sides.  Sounds boring/normal/whatever, I know, but it is DE-LISH.  I would say I go to westville solely for the market plates, but the main dishes are so phenomenal that I just can't say that, obviously.Moving on to location/ambiance...in a shift from the other locations' small, intimate atmospheres, this new location on Hudson st  is by far the largest and the most ""scene-y"".  Big wrap around bar makes it a good place to meet friends co-workers for a drink (in addition to food).   Larger space allows for more breathing room in between tables (the other locations can sometimes leave you feeling like you consciously need to make an effort to not reach 6 inches over to the next table and grab a handful of fried plantains off your neighbors plate).  Some may think the ambiance here takes away from the original westville vibe, but seeing as the menu is exactly the same and doesn't disappoint, I have no qualms.  Plus, the bigger space allows for a shorter wait time for a table....that's good in my book!

I have been to every location in the city and they keep the same quality of service, delicious good and great ambiance at each and every one. You can't really get better than their market vegetables and their cobb salad is certainly top notch. After challenging myself to no french fries for 6 months (and taking note of all the fries at restaurants I'd eaten at in that time) I made the decision that the Westville fries certainly looked the best. The day that 6 month challenge ended I ventured back to Westville and boy was I right. Their french fries are perfectly crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. You can't go wrong ordering anything on their menu, and the brunch menu is stellar as well.
