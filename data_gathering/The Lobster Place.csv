However, when my boyfriend told me he'd never been and we found ourselves nearby on a Saturday afternoon after a day of gallery hopping, I was willing to give it another try.The Lobster Place must be the crown jewel of Chelsea Market, and if there were more stops like it I might like it better. You have a few options here for sit-down, including sushi, lobster, soup, and oysters, as well as a market for taking fish home. It's as clogged with tourists as the rest of the market, but there's enough seating that the experience is less stressful.Any time is a good time for oysters, so we sat ourselves at the oyster bar. They have a helpful map above the counter placing their varieties between salty/sweet and big/small. They also have clams and other seafood. We went for two each of the three sweet'n'smalls, which were Chelsea Gems, Kumamotos, and Gigamotos. Each were a little under $3.They came out quick. This isn't the most attentive shucking, so I would use the little fork rather than slurping. More shell than I can excuse, really. Gigamotos were good but nothing special, Kumamotos were great, and Chelsea Gems knocked our socks off. Will keep an eye out for them in the future. Definitely super fresh here.

For the third trip, we had to make a point to go because WE HAD TO. And boy oh boy, I felt like a kid inside a candy store.Stepping into the Lobster Place, I wanted to buy everything. I literally just opened my wallet and said here take my money, take it all (that's saying a lot cause spending gives me heart palpitations).Our first stop was for the the lobster bisque because my friend kept raving about them. It's stationed in the back by C&P Galley...and you served yourself. Obviously, get the large...better yet get two. That's what I did...and you won't regret it. The New England clam chowder was my second favorite. They were jammed packed with flavor, thick, and with chunks of lobster for the bisque & clams for the chowder. It was delicious, I still dream about the bisque till this day!And while we were at C&P, we also ordered the lobster roll. A bit pricey, but worth it. I do believe it's the best roll I've tasted. I shared it with my friend, not because it was big, but because I needed to make room for all the other foods we ordered. Roll was normal size bordering on the smaller...I could have eaten it by myself.Then we made our way to the steamed lobster counter...I order a small steam lobster. It was gigantic though. And it was the freshest lobster I have eaten thus far in my life. They give you the whole lobster intact, it was magical. If you love lobster and you're in New York and can't go up to Maine, this is where you need to go!!!They also have lobster fried rice, but they ran out. I was depressed about that, it sounded amazing...and it probably was if they ran out. Next time I came back, I will definitely get them even if I need to camp out at that market!Side note: this is somewhat like a communal eating, you get your food and you try to find a table to eat at around.

The Manhattan Clam chowder has whole clams, not chopped up small pieces. The New England clam is the same, big chucks of clams and veggies. I never had the ""soup in a bowl"" deal, that's alotta bread! Be careful because the soup will burn your mouth if you take it out of the pot and sit outside the store to eat it. Buy your soup and sit on a bench, go to the High Line, let things cool down. Why are you in such a rush? If you want a treat, It's expensive but order Lobster roll. Big lobster chunks that aren't slathered in mayo and other fillers. The bun wasn't a cheap hot dog roll but a nice size piece of bread. I've never bought fish here, only lunch.

My favorites were the seared salmon belly, yellow tail, hokkaido uni and toro with caviar. I'm also loved the wasabi served here. It tastes nothing like store bought artificial wasabi.

18,F_smZKP0SJPg0pTcAeg60Q,Lambert P.,4.0 star rating,"The Lobster Place has a known presence inside of Chelsea Market.  It's wide and bright and there's sparkling ice and a seafood bar, a sushi bar and just claws of that shellfish, hot sandwiches and just so much going on.  It's like 3 or 4 separate places in one shop but they're all seafood related.  I was sort of confused as we ordered our sandwiches to go it was given to us in a Cull and Pistol paper bag but the receipt did in fact read The Lobster Place.Off to the right is a place to line up to order hot food such as sandwiches, soup and your basic to go type fare.  Sadly there's a door that opens out right by where the line forms.  A worker had to excuse himself several times in that people were blocking his way into the back room where he was constantly taking things back and forth.After looking at the menu on the wall I like the option of the oyster po boy sandwich and my wife ended up getting the salmon burger.  I like lobster rolls but honestly they seem to be overpriced and aren't necessarily the greatest value for the money not to mention not satisfying every time.  They had a choice of 4 different chowders and while each sounded great we decided to get a medium scallop and bacon chowder.  The other choices were lobster bisque, and both New England and Manhattan clam chowders.  This place sort of reminded me of that place in Seattle Pike Place market where people line up to get their sandwich and soup and Chelsea Market sort of has that kind of feeling.Because there were only stand up type surfaces to eat in this area and the front of the place was all high stool type seating we decided to take our food out and have it in the central walkway where there are many low top tables as it would have been more comfortable in there.  With the sandwiches they give you a small bag of Utz's plain potato chips each as well.  The sandwiches looked as good as they were.  I particularly liked the generous quantity of fried oysters in the po boy.  I didn't count how many there were but it's safe to say each bite was a good ratio of bread to filling without having to feel shorted along the way.  My wife's salmon burger was curious.  The bread was sort of a grilled press bread, not quite sure what kind but it was a good consistency and it worked with what was inside and how it was served.  The salmon had a rich velvety texture and it was a contrast to my crispy bits of oysters in my sandwich.  The soup was very good, not too thick but creamy and savory.  The soup is self serve so my wife mixed it up a bit before filling the to go cup so that it had an even mix of scallop, bacon and liquid soup.  We threw a pack of oyster crackers in there after eating enough of the soup to make room for the cracker displacement.  The medium was a good size for sharing the small wasn't as good of a value and the large would have been to much.  This was only the 2nd place we went to try after trying Los Tacos No. 1 and it would be the last of the evening .  There's so much to try at Chelsea Market and only so much real estate in the bellies but I'm glad we were able to try these seafood sandwiches and soup because it was a nice change from your everyday sandwiches and such.  Most of the sandwiches here are about 10-15 bucks with the exception of the lobster and crab sandwiches.",The Lobster Place,4.0 star rating,$$,"Seafood, Markets,, Seafood"

My shrimp & fries cost around $14 and took no longer than 15 minutes to come out. I took it elsewhere to eat since there weren't any open seats in the actual market, so consider ordering to go.The shrimp (about 8 medium sized pieces) was fried to perfection- not too breaded and far from greasy. The cocktail sauce given to me was a weird texture as it was all clumped together so I used ketchup instead.

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?Where do we even start with the atmosphere at The Lobster Place? In what is undoubtedly the gem of Chelsea Market at least from a square footage and atmosphere perspective, you can find virtually anything you want related to seafood at one of the various stands. Live lobster? No problem. Oysters? Easy. A dish of fish? Readily available. I actually had to search a bit to finally track down where the lobster rolls were coming from, and didn't have to wait more than twenty minutes line to table for my roll. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?Even with lobster price points where they are today, my mental limit for a lobster roll is $20.00. I paid $16.00 at Luke's for what I would call a very small roll, and here at The Lobster Place I paid $18.00 for a standard small lobster roll. Expensive? Yes, but still worth it all things considered. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?This was undoubtedly a very good lobster roll. Large chunks of fresh lobster were complimented by some select peripherals like light mayo and celery, and the whole thing was brought together in a buttery roll. The one thing that this roll was missing was the zing factor, which Luke's brings about thanks to some exceptionally unique and flavorful spice that tops their rolls. The Lobster Place lets their lobster do the talking, which is totally fine, but just one more flavor contributor would go a long way. Single Star Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?Absolutely. Star Granted.",The Lobster Place,4.0 star rating,$$,"Seafood, Markets,, Seafood"

Also had a restaurant called Cull & Pistol right next door. I've been to The Lobster Place more times than I can count, and it's become one of my go-to spots for a bite to eat when in Chelsea Market with friends or family. The sushi is excellent and very reasonably priced, and if you don't see exactly what you want the chef can make it for you right then and there. The soups are excellent as well, and you can even order one in a bread bowl, which makes for a nice and filling lunch. The last time I went, my cousin and I sat at the sushi bar (we had dinner reservations a couple hours from then so we didn't do the formal omakase, but wanted to abate our appetites a bit). We ordered some sake, I had a carafe of one of the more dry sakes on the menu ($14) and really enjoyed it while my cousin had a glass of an unfiltered sake with fruitier notes ($5) - sweet sake is not my thing, but she enjoyed it.We ordered the edamame ($4.50) and I had the hamachi ceviche ($10) - hamachi belly, yuzu, garlic dashi, and jalapeno. My cousin ordered a few pieces of nigiri (I believe she had the tuna but I can't remember what else she had). The nigiri ranges in price from around $3.50 to $10, and interestingly enough toro is not MP. Everything was very fresh, not the best fish I've had, but for the relatively modest price I can't complain. Would love to come back and try the reasonably priced omakase ($70) as well. Taking off a star because I think some things at TLP are a little overpriced (the soups are pricey and some of the fresh fish is a little overpriced as well) but mostly because of the lack of seating. There are seats around the sushi bar, but aside from that if you want soup or lobster or whatever you have to eat standing up. I guess this is to deter the hoards of tourists in Chelsea Market from loitering in TLP, but still makes it an unpleasant experience.TL;DR: Freshly prepared seafood in Chelsea Market, no seating (except around the sushi bar).

From a whole lobster to a lobster roll, and from oysters to sushi, it was all there. There were several sections in the shop: sushi, oysters/clams, etc., lobster and other fish. I got a small raw oyster sampler which contained several different types of oysters. All were equally delicious. I was a bit through off with the saltiness of it because it was my first time trying oysters, but it was still delicious (they also served beer). I definitely had an amazing time here, as there were so many different types of clams and oysters. The people who run this place are amazing. After placing your order, you would give the paper to one of the guys working there and they would start by putting a bunch of seaweed on a brown plate, then they would pick out the oysters/clams you choose. From there, someone would skillfully cut the oysters open and place them on the plate. When you're finished, you would leave your plate there and you would pay (make sure to tip them!)

The place is a haven for seafood lovers, offering everything from sushi, to fresh fish, oysters, clams, shellfish, you name it. The lobster is all the way at the back, and you can choose sizes between 1.5lbs to up to 4lbs. We chose to go with the medium (2lb) lobsters, which were $42 each at the time. Prices change based on market prices. You can take them home live or have them steam them for you immediately. You can eat there or take away easily. We had them steamed for us, and we even asked for all female lobsters because we wanted the lobster eggs :) The quality was fantastic, the lobsters were HUGE even with the mediums. Thinking back, I definitely would've gone for the small (1.5lb) instead because the 2lb was too much for one person, and the price difference was significant that day. $30 vs. $42 each. We didn't notice this until after we had ordered. Service was fast and friendly. Overall, good quality, worth if you want to impress with huge beautiful lobsters. Getting them steamed there is easiest and will not hurt freshness.

I waited about five minutes for my salad, which was made from scratch.  The woman in the window was the same cashier that rung me up.  I asked her if the poke bowl was made from scratch as well.  She said it was, so I confirmed again that no substitutions can be made, and she confirmed without providing any rationale.  I can only assume at this point that there's some price differential involved.I'm giving the place two starts, because the food is actually good.  I'm originally from New England, and the clam chowder is actually pretty decent here.  I ordered the beet salad as well, and it's pretty evident that they use high quality ingredients to make them.  It was delicious.Despite the food being good, I don't think I'll be back for another $18 soup and salad lunch with a side of snarky attitude.  I understand that Chelsea Market is overrun with tourists and that their job is probably not the easiest in the world.  But as someone who lives and works in the city, I choose to spend my money elsewhere next time.  It's really too bad that the gift card didn't cover this one...",The Lobster Place,4.0 star rating,$$,"Seafood, Markets,, Seafood"

The sandwiches were lightly dressed, mayo-style, and came with a bag of chips. I thought the brioche bun they came on was quite good. My favorite among shrimp, crab, and lobster was the shrimp, which was sweet and more citrus-y than the lobster slider. A lot of people were indulging in the steamed lobster. However, the dining experience seemed very troublesome. The prices were also not much cheaper than what lobster goes for at sit-down restaurants, so I'm not really sure what the advantage would be of going here to get a steamed lobster unless you were getting one of the jumbo sized 3+ lb ones.

If the thought of being packed in with tourists while you dine makes you break out in hives, come here anyway. Just do take out! I will be honest; I used to see the hordes of tourists flocking here during the summer, to get the lobster and haul it off to the tables in Chelsea Market or the Highline to dine. The tourist trap warning would flash in my brain and tell me to flee. Then recently, two friends invited me to their apartment for dinner. And what they serve me? It was sushi from here. The rolls we had were creative, beautifully made, and the sushi was ever so fresh. I was an instant convert. So don your cloak of patience and come hither. This market has evolved from a simple seafood market with some sushi to go on the side to a large fish market with a full scale eatery. In the middle is a dining counter for those who want to sit and dine on all sorts of oysters. They range from reasonable to pricier. There's another eating station for sushi lovers, with chefs ready to customize to your palate's desire. The sushi to take out has more interesting types of fish and rolls not usually seen in take out sushi selections. The sashimi I had was superb, huge pieces of buttery sushi that slid down my throat with not the slightest trace of fishiness. The sushi isn't cheap here, about the same as in a decent sushi restaurant, but worth what you pay. Towards the back to the right is the seafood ordering station where you can get oyster po boys and lobster rolls, seafood chowder and even poke. And of course, there's the station for ordering lobster and tables in the back for standing and eating. Everything is clean and brightly, lit, the better to highlight all the seafood that will entice those dollars out of your wallet.Coming at off hours isn't really a strategy here. Jet travel may have altered the Circadian Rhythm of tourists in regards to all habits but eating. I have passed by this place at all different times and it is always a mob scene. Just do what I have decided to do and take out. For me, raw fish, when it's good, begs for quiet contemplation of its subtle tastes, the delicate mouth feel in each bite.

Very sweet ( good kinda of sweet) and juicy which means it's fresh. There isn't a whole lot to talk about here since you can't beat fresh lobsters. Our lobster is a little bit overcooked though, but no big deal. Be prepared to get your hands dirty. - Lastly we have the raw fresh oysters - from $2.50 to $3.50 each.

Apparently I went on the busiest day of the year but I'm a southerner and been to club, a few elbows here and there and you can keep your place in line. Do not walk out without trying the scallop burger. I repeat, do not miss this burger!! So flavorful with spicy mayo and the kimchi did not overwhelm it at all. They have different sections in the place and this is on the upper east side of the restaurant, if you will. From that area you get soups and sandwiches, we also tried the new England clam chowder (above average!) And salmon poke which was a huge portion!! Got me giving my regular poke places the side eye with their portions. The lobster and crab legs are from the upper west side of the space. They were delicious but the lobster was just very slightly overcooked, great bang for your buck though. The small one is 1.5 lbs for 13$--the one in my pic was not a small one fyi. The crab legs were the best price I've seen and delicious. In the center you get oysters with horseradish lemon cocktail and mignoette sauce.

I liked the Nauti Pilgrim since it was rich and sweet in taste and smooth in texture.  Wild Cat Cove had a complex taste profile since there were notes of melon toward the finish.  Copps Island was too mild in taste although the taste may have been hidden from the previous oyster I consumed before it.  Ship shoal had a good balance of brine and sweetness with the brine being a bit stronger.  The workers there did a great job of shucking since they were fast, very little juice was lost and no bits of sand or shell were in the oyster.",The Lobster Place,4.0 star rating,$$,"Seafood, Markets,, Seafood"

Turns out it was the Uni Ikura Don ($35). After much deliberating and getting additional recommendations from the (super sweet and helpful) hostess, we decided on the Uni Ikura Don and a Chirashi bowl ($28) to share. Btw, the prices on the online menu are outdated - they have since increased!Everything was delicious and soooo fresh. which is only to be expected at The Lobster Place, where their fish is probably sourced from the stand right next to them.

It didn't make me absolutely melt and feel content to die at that very moment... That could be said for the uni/sea urchin. They were so buttery and good, but just not my favorite? Which is sad because I absolutely love sea urchin. And you can bet that if my bank account could sustain a diet of pure sea urchin and rice, I'd definitely do it. The salmon roe, surprisingly was my favorite. I used to not like salmon roe, but now I've realized I just had bad salmon roe. They weren't fishy or slimy.

Then again, I'm a seafood lover so if you're a seafood lover too, then this is the place for you.They have seafood in every way you can imagine - fish to take home, 3-pound lobsters, lobster rolls, a sushi bar, frozen items, condiments to go with the seafood to take home to cook that you will want to spend all of your money on, oysters shucked right in front of you, you name it!On both occasions, I tried the raw clams and freshly shucked oysters near the front. I don't have any complaints (except maybe if you come during crowded times, you might find it hard to wedge yourself into their bar-like ordering system).

And apparently the sushi is amazing. They also have a prepared sushi selection that looks great! You'll just have to read others review on it; don't just take my words for it. :) They offer a few warm dishes; and a few soup choices. I ordered the sliders sample: lobster roll, crab club, and a shrimp slider...all on brioche buns. My fav had to be the lobster roll. My Boston friends would vouch that it is just as good as theirs. Lol  My little brother got the fried shrimp boat with fries. He loved it so much, he ordered a second dish! My cousin got the lobster bisque in a bread bowl and a salmon burger. Omg....sooo good! We literally finished everything...including the bowl. LolThe establishment also offer alcoholic drinks: wine and sake. I settled for sparkling grapefruit. Yummmmmmmmm!!!!

It's insanely difficult to choose amongst the impressive array of seafood and sushi, but I wasn't in the mood to sit down and pry a whole lobster apart (though they looked superb) and I can find amazing sushi anywhere in the city. The ordering process was pretty simple. My tab came to just about $20 for a single lobster roll. I was a little disappointed at the size; it wasn't terribly large. Also, they must've skipped my number because I ended up having to go up to the pick-up window after about 10 minutes of seeing everyone who ordered both ahead of and behind me pick up their food, including my boyfriend. The matter was instantly resolved and I dove right into my lobster roll as soon as it was in my hands. The aforementioned disappointment regarding the smallish size of the lobster roll immediately disappeared with my first bite. This lobster was fresh, tender, and dressed perfectly. I prefer a more robust bun but the toasted bread was tasty. I finished it way before I made my way back to the high line. Overall, I was satisfied with my purchase. I'll spend $$ for quality lobster.

165,C_UphYt3lmKO7VpK3VLK2Q,Thierry T.,4.0 star rating,"(This review is in regards to CP GALLEY and FRESHLY STEAMED LOBSTERS)1. Service - there are no waiters here, the only service you get is only through the cashier. So if I am to judge on their service, I think the cashier was quite nice and friendly. No complaints. For all vendors, you'll need to line up and order from their displayed menu. You pay for the food as you order, grab a table, and wait for your number to be called before going back up to pick up your food. 2. Price - Price for Lobsters vary per market value, but when we were there in February 2017, it was about $25 a lobster? By the way, there are 4 vendors here, and each vendor has their own cash register. One Lobster roll including chips was about $10-$15. 3. Ambiance - This is an interesting setup. It appears as just a fish market at first glance, but it's actually a fish market and a cafeteria. There is only one place that sells fresh seafood, and the rest are just eateries. Besides the sushi joint, there are no chairs to sit on, so you'll have to stand. Not exactly a romantic place to eat, but a cool and casual hang out spot if you're craving seafood, sushi, or lobster. 4. Food - As far as eateries are concerned, there is a sushi joint, a place called CP GALLEY, and FRESHLY STEAMED LOBSTERS. I had a Lobster roll from CP Galley which was fresh and tasty, it came with a bag of chips and no drinks. Although it was really good, I thought that my sandwich was smaller to my liking. It was about a palm size, and not a foot long (which I would prefer more). But nevertheless a good sandwich. My wife had the Lobster from the other place, and it was very meaty, fresh, and very flavorful. We walked out of there pretty content and satisfied. We'll definitely be back.5. Cleanliness - the setup here is nice and clean for all 4 vendors. There are no restrooms that are a part of the store because this is inside the Chelsea Market shopping mall.

Towards the right is the C&P (Cull and Pistol, same as the seat down location next door) Galley for soups and a windows to order prepared items such as lobsters rolls, sandwiches, salads, etc. Towards the back you can order steamed lobsters.We tried the C&P Galley for a fantastic lobster roll and BBQ shrimp po'boy special which was great as well. The lobster roll was lightly dressed and came with gorgeous chunks of lobster in a toasted hot dog roll, chips, cole slaw and pickle were included. The shrimp in that po'boy were large and lightly fried to perfection!The array of lobsters looked beautiful and the a couple of ladies next to us were sharing a large 3 1/2 pounder with claws as large as their heads! haha It is difficult to find a place to stand at the standing bars, but there are tables around the Chelsea market you may want to try. If you make a reservation Cull and Pistol next door might be a better choice for a sit down meal.

Other foods such as the fresh filets or steamed lobsters are only upper-fair in quality. Which is surprising, considering the high turn-over these folks seem to have. It seems one has to travel far in NYC, respectively speaking, to get very well maintained fish. Especially, since Blue Moon has folded shop and no longer vends in Union Square.

They have nice wide varieties of fresh local catches of the day and oysters from different parts of the state. The prices for sushi is reasonable, as well as seafood, certain things are considered pretty pricey.. it all ranges.What I usually get here to eat :Live sea urchin (uni) - they usually have either from California or Maine. I've had both from here before and usually enjoyable but it really depends on who and how well they clean your sea urchin. Sometimes its a mild clean briny taste.. and sometimes it can be super briny.Oysters - I love that they label where each oysters are from and describe the finish of the taste where each comes from. They range from $1.10-$2.70 here. **Note: Cull&Pistol is attached next door where they have $1 oyster special from 4-6PM.Raw scallops - big, chunky, and decent... wish it was sweeter like how I normally love my raw scallops.Sushi - I've gotten the pre-boxed ones with otoro (fatty tuna belly)... decently priced and decent quality. I've never had their sushi bar omakase... But a friend who's been almost everywhere in NYC and Japan many times for omakase actually likes to occasionally come here for his sushi omakase cravings...

The market itself has a very wide array of everything from fish, to oysters, to clams, to lobsters and everything in between but the freshness of everything is pretty spectacular. The market has a stall for sushi, a soup counter, fresh steamed lobster with varying prices depending on the size and then there is the stall that serves the lobster rolls and other seafood items. The market only has a small standing area for eating but you could take the food outside and find a table inside the Chelsea Market.The food:Lobster Roll- Fresh claw and tail meat, celery, scallions, lemon & mayo, on a grilled top-split bun. I thought the Lobster Roll was very respectable. I thought the bread was great, it was nicely toasted with a nice butter flavor. The lobster meat itself had nice flavor and was not overcooked, the meat had a nice bite to it. The Lobster Roll had a nice underlying celery flavor that went well with the roll. The roll was all about the lobster with a very light addition of mayo just to bind the roll together, but I like me mayo and wish there was a tad more. Overall a a good roll but still Pearl and Mary's is still king for me. yelp.com/user_local_phot…",The Lobster Place,4.0 star rating,$$,"Seafood, Markets,, Seafood"

However, the actual meat inside the shell was skimpy.  I downed a dozen and my stomach barely noticed. The prices didn't seem as great once factoring in the 50 cent shucking fee.

Fresh everything it appears, and huge lobsters in the back for about $30.We decided to go to the window in the back right and ordered the lobster roll starter kit or something like that. I believe around $20-25 and you get two hot dog sized lobster rolls and chips. Disclaimer, I don't love cold lobster, but this was pretty good, the bun was amazing. The lobster chunks were here huge. So big my fiancé choked on one piece, she said she nearly died, but she is probably exaggerating. We also go the fries. AMAZING. Maybe the best fries I've ever had in my life? I've eaten a lot of fries in my life. I also got a cup of the black bean chorizo soup. It was really good and super hot!! All the soups here are ridiculously hot.

Initially, I was a bit put off by having what seemed to be a pre-cooked lobster, but it tasted pretty good to me. I had a nice 2lb lobster which was nice and meaty. it was about $50 with a diet coke, so it wasn't' cheap, but it was certainly delicious, and it tasted as if it was freshly cooked to order.It does get extremely crowded, and it probably would have been really hard to find a place to eat if I arrived at 12:30, but it was fine at 11:45.The fish and seafood at the fish counter looked amazing, and I was sad that I wasn't able to take any home with me to cook.

The meat is super tender and juicy, and the other ingredients mixed in make an awesome burger. The bread is amazingly buttery, and the sauce adds a nice acidity. It's a very light meal that'll fill you up. You also get a free bag of potato chips that you can put inside the burger to add a nice crunch.

Two small lobsters and a beer here came out to a little over $70 after tax and tip. Not totally horrible--I've wasted $70 on more useless things. Note that this place will be crowded and you will have to hover behind some people to try to swoop on their table space once they're finished. Once you find a spot, you're going to be trying very hard not to elbow the stranger next to you while attempting to gracefully crack open your lobster. What can I say about the lobster? It's simply steamed, served with melted butter and lemons. No frills--it's just you and a crustacean. Deliciousness in its purest form.The oysters are some of the freshest I've ever had.

It might seem a little pricey but honestly where can you get a whole 1 1/2 lb lobster for $25.99 at any restaurant. The lobster comes with lemon and butter and that's honestly all you need. You order the amount of lobster you want and you get a number. While you wait for your number to be called, there are plenty of other places around that you can browse. There's a smoked salmon area, clam chowder station, fresh sushi bar, and a poke stand.Once you have received your lobster you feel a little like a savage as you rip into the warm flesh and hard shell of this underwater creature. But the claws are so juicy and soft and tastes like butter and you dip them in more butter and a spritz of sour lemon and you're in heaven (even if the lobster is looking at you with its eyes..).Tip: If you don't know how to eat a lobster or what part to eat, the claws, tale and legs are safe. The grey/green looking goo in the body can be eaten (delicacy for some and sometimes eaten on toast) or completely discarded as some don't like the taste or texture rather. Get yourself some lobster!

My aunt and uncle both got lobster rolls and lobster bisque and loved it!For my second time around, we came on a Sunday afternoon. That was our first mistake. It was so overwhelming crowded, but it was to be expected. My boyfriend got the lobster roll picnic basket, which he said was good, but thought it was a little too pricey for how small the lobster roll was.

Don't think I've ever had a bad piece of fish here, & the prices are pretty average - not the cheapest but not the most expensive either.In terms of prepared foods, I see lots of people gorging over steamed lobsters, but I think their salmon burger, lobster bisque, & NE clam chowder are excellent! They also have some of THE BEST sushi in the city & an omakase for $65 is some of the cheapest for quality sushi! I personally love their sake ikura don & uni ikura don!

What is cool is they have mini cups available so you can try the soup before you make a purchase--my opinion is to go straight for the New England Clam Chowder because it's the best I have ever had!  They serve beer on tap, they have a sushi station and a raw bar station. Two words--Diver Scallops--so fresh so delicious and pretty big as well. They are about $8 and change each but worth every penny.

246,wG35rxvRF8jOmLKma4NY4g,Moni L.,5.0 star rating,"My first Omakase experience was at the sushi counter in The Lobster Place. I've been wanting to try one for a while now but some of the prices are obscene in NYC. In case you don't know what Omakase is, it's a meal consisting of dishes selected by the chef. Unwilling to pay $150-$200 a person, my friend and I decided to try it out here. We chose the last option on the menu: Traditional Omakase Tasting ($68 per person). It came with miso soup (which was delicious), tuna tartare (appetizer portion), 12 pieces of nigiri (chefs choice), and finished with a hand roll. If you've seen Jiro Dreams of Sushi, it's served like in the documentary. The chef stands in front of you and prepares the nigiri, placing each piece on your plate consistently after you finish each one. In other words, you don't get a platter of food that you can eat at your own pace, they wait for you to finish one before giving you another piece. The food was fantastic and so fresh. The selection varied from mackerel belly to Amaebi (sweet shrimp). There were also quirkier pieces such as sea slug that resembled a slice of mushroom. The nigiri course finished with Uni (sea urchin) which I know many people love but it's a bit hard for me to stomach. On that note, the only piece of criticism I have is that it is a bit stressful to eat in front of someone, especially since I don't want to offend the chef. He was cooler than Jiro though (ha). He didn't spend the entire time watching us take every bite so I imagine it was less stressful than eating at the renowned Japanese restaurant. By the end of the meal I was so stuffed that I couldn't finish the hand roll and felt like the chef thought I didn't like it. Another chef came up and teased me about not finishing it...womp.While I don't think I would do a traditional Omakase regularly (who's got that kind of money?), I would definitely recommend it. It was a great experience and worth the price which was significantly lower than other NYC restaurants that offer Omakase.",The Lobster Place,4.0 star rating,$$,"Seafood, Markets,, Seafood"

On weekends this place is packed to the rafters so come on weekdays if possible for a more leisurely experience. The Lobster bar sits at the very back of the market. You can look at the lobsters on display and choose the size you want, this is then freshly cooked for you on the spot. You can also choose a side of chowder and a beer or wine. There are a couple of small stand up bars to start dissecting your lobster at. I have to be honest and say that I was a little let down with the Lobster, it wasn't the magical experience I had hoped. Never mind we went to the sushi bar and this is where the magic happens. On our first occasion we tried some sashimi as well as a chirashi don. The sashimi as you can expect is super fresh, the bed of rice it sat on was very well seasoned and makes for a delicious lunch. We enjoyed it so much we came back for the Omikase grand set. It's the most expensive set on the menu and I recommend you choose a seat infront of a sushi master and request they serve each sushi piece individually in the traditional style.

The 2.5 lbs lobster that I shared with my wife is one of the best ""fast food style lobsters"" I can think of. They are pretty fresh but pre-cooked  about half way. The final steaming process happens after you order them. I think that's why it's not the softest of lobsters, but for the price and the amount of time it takes to turn each order around, I think it's a great deal. They are cracked for easy pickings. Just squeeze some lemon, dip them in butter and you're good to go.Couple of other things I've tried are the crab club and the oyster po boy. I loved the crab salad in the crab club. I'm drawing a blank trying to figure out the herb that was in it, but I know I've had it before.  It goes well with the crab. I could've done w/o the oyster po boy.

First ordered half a dozen oysters at the stand up oyster bar. There is a wide selection of both east and west coast oysters. I selected Kusshi (BC), Kumamoto (CA), and Eagle Rock (WA) and they were all amazing and fresh! Next I mozied on over to the sushi bar that was located right next to the oyster bar. The menu was a bit pricey especially since it wasn't an actual sushi restaurant. Asked the chef to make me a mini omakase of 6 pieces. He served me uni, mackerel, yellowtail, amberjack, toro, and raw scallop. Each one had it's own sauce delicately painted on and he instructed me to eat it without dipping the fish into soy sauce. The fish was fresh and flavorful. Also tried my friend's salmon belly that was lightly seared and tasty. Afterwards, the chef made us a complimentary piece. It was a ball of tuna that was torched just to sear it on the outside. It came on a bed of daikon and topped with ponzu. Great experience at the Lobster Place.

Meaning, you leave it up to the chef to choose what you will eat. Omakase can be pricey, but the prices here were pretty decent and fair in my opinion. I ended up with 6 pieces of sushi of different fishes and one roll. Can't quite remember which fishes were in my roll, but everything tasted amazing and fresh. I can't tell you how much I love a fresh fish and the textures that were going on in my mouth. Yes, I'm very much a tactile eater. After eating and paying at the sushi bar, I was planning to just walk out and leave. But then, I saw oysters. When I travel to coastal places, I usually try to snag some oysters in my mouth. So now was just the right opportunity. I ended up just getting three. The selection, mind you, is pretty large there too. I personally like Kumamotos so I took one of those. It has a sweet almost honey dew finish. I also tried out two others per recommendation: Wiley and Mayflower. I ended up really liking the Mayflower. Unlike the sushi counter, the oyster counter has no seating. But feel free to stand there and eat your oysters. Next time I'll try out the lobster!",The Lobster Place,4.0 star rating,$$,"Seafood, Markets,, Seafood"

We left very satisfied and without waiting more than 5 minutes to order/eat. 1) the lobster roll was delish. I just hate celery, which is nobody's fault. The lobster was really tasty though. 2) the shrimp salad with tarragon was the surprise winner IMO. You won't be sad to order this. Tastiest of them all. 3) the crab club. Bacon, crab salad, avo, t+l....really tasty and satisfying. 4) the lobster bisque. Sadly - more creamy than lobstery. aside from that it tasted good. If you don't want to spend too much $$, go for the Shrimp Salad sandwich with tarragon or the crab club sandwich. Otherwise, you can always indulge with the lobster roll.

Lobster roll is about $17, and you can add a bag of chips, a root beer, and a cookie for about $20. I recommend just going with the roll unless you're a big fan of Utz plain chips and a small semi-hard cookie (why, when you could go to Levain?!). My first thoughts on the lobster roll was how tiny it was. However, the bun was buttered and grilled with a nice crunch, and the lobster was fresh. Of course, could have used more lobster, but it's not as heavy (mayo-doused) as other lobster rolls.Clam chowder is pretty good (especially for dipping of bread / crackers / fries).

However the lobster was top quality. There wasn't a single area in the lobster that wasn't filled with sweet, firm meat. The head was filled with tomalley or ""mustard"" which was rich, creamy and full of umami flavor, almost like the flavor of sea urchin. Also the lobster wasn't dripping with water so you can tell a good amount of the price we paid was for actual meat. For the current prices, it breaks the bank though, so I suggest waiting until prices go down to get the best value.As for the C&P area of the Lobster Place, they messed up my order. Instead of giving me the Crab Club I ordered, they gave me the Oyster Po'Boy. I even confirmed if its the right order I am picking up and they said yes.

That's right - a WHOLE lobster! Eyes and everything - not for the squeamish. They crack it for you in all the right places, which makes it easy to eat. Which is good because you have to eat it standing up - there are two stand-up eating areas (by the lobsters and by the entrance). Market price ranges from $21-26 for the smallest size lobster (1.5 pounds), bigger lobsters are obviously more expensive (up to $43 bucks). Get your own, don't try to share one, there's not enough lobster meat for two - sadly what's in the body is not edible, so it's basically the meat that's in the claws and tail.

The Lobster Place has always showcased fresh seafood, but after the renovation and expansion a while back, it's gotten insanely better. It would be a daily stop for me, but the prices are on the expensive side, so I try to keep it at a minimum.The soups are all delicious (my favorite is the scallop and bacon chowder), but sometimes when I feel adventurous, I mix a bit of the soups together into one cup and it makes an entirely new soup so I get all the different flavors.The sushi/sashimi is super fresh and the sandwiches are good as well. They used to have wraps, but I haven't seen them for a while so either they sell out quick or I'm missing something.You can choose any sort of fish by the pound and some are already marinated so that when you get home, all you have to do is put it on a grill or baking dish. I got sea urchin once and they clean it out for you (for a fee, but it's well worth it) which was awesome because I definitely did not know they needed to be rinsed out and I'm sure I would have eaten something I'm not supposed to.The Lobster Place should be a stop on everyone's itinerary, whether for lunch or just to check out.

Plus,they charge 50 cents less if you take them home and shuck them yourself. My one comment is that they need to dig a little deeper with their oyster descriptions - everything  is 'briny' with a 'hint of ocean.' Well of course - they come from the sea.The shuckers also know what they are doing - not a bit of grit in any and they are served nice and cold. You can top your oysters with a dash of lemon, prepared horseradish, mignonette, or cocktail sauce. I have to say that the mignonette is too pungent and strong - it drowns out the delicate flavor of the oysters.Here are my favorite:- Shigoku: from the West coast exclusively, super deep shells but small in size. The meat is sweet and creamy. My favorite.- Pemaquid: large, meaty and briny.- Kumamoto: small, deep shell but sweet and cucumbery.- hog island: large, briny and chewy.- forbidden: metallic, briny, with nice meat.The long neck clams are a pass - they taste better steamed in beer.I also tried the lobster bisque.

Best thing to do (I think) is to let your feet take you to where your eyes land and keep repeating the process until you can't eat any more. Seating is sort of an issue - people flock here because they're in the know, and those who aren't in the know come here because they're in Chelsea Market and see a crowd of people waiting by here.

Which I'm not really complaining about since that's how much it costs usually. But compared to Luke's it was a bit weak. Sure the pieces were fresh and they were huge chunks, but something about it just didn't hit the spot. So were the soups... we tried the lobster bisque and bacon scallop chowder and both were meh. Lobster bisque was too creamy and cheesy and lacked depth of flavor and the Bacon scallop chowder was the same... Something about seafood is that the flavor or the seafood must be perfectly in tact no matter how you choose to season it and they just didn't do such a good job.

And after having me wait at the window for a minute staring at them, a guy finally told me the prepared food shack (for lobster rolls) wasn't open until 11am.The uni/sea urchin we paid a fortune for was not as fresh as it should be (not live like we're able to get out here).  Two stars for the whole steamed 2lb lobster.

Their meals on the go section is now larger (ie, seafood soups, lobster rolls, steamed lobsters, sushi bar, take out sushi etc.) There's even a area in the front and back to eat your seafood meal. The steamed lobster section is large as you see the steaming vats and piles of lobsters on display.A bit pricey but you'll find a wide variety of seafood to purchase to bring home. Various fish, shellfish, and prepared items of marinated fish and crab cakes to cook at home. I picked up some clams to be cooked at home with linguine, 12 in all for 5 bucks. not bad. Fresh and tasted sweet and of the sea.Also had the lobster roll. Not a big fan as it was over cooked and a bit rubbery. I've had better in the city. Also had the sushi as well. Fish was fresh but the sushi was plain jane.A bit crowded during rush hour and a large contingent of tourists you can find a nice deal here and there.

It is a tad pricey; a large is about $8.50 and a quart of chilled soup to take home is $15. I've tried three of the soups. The New England clam chowder is delicious and warming. The Manhattan clam chowder is tomatoey and not near as good as the creamy, rich New England one. The lobster bisque is overrated.

The restaurant is very crowded around weekday dinner so you gotta find a place outside. When I bit right in, it was a great warm rushing experience. Crispy fried? check. Soft, flaky fish? Check! Not too overpowering but tangy tartar sauce? YES! The three flavors really did the job and then when you try the french fries, they have this Old Bay seasoning. I loved it... the only downside ?

Got the fish n' chips which came with a side of ketchup and tartar sauce and was either $12.95 or $13.95, an average price I'd say. There was a good amount of fish given, and although it was good, I didn't love it. I found the batter to be a little too thick for the fish, and it definitely weighed it down. Now I am a New Englander who has worked in a clam shack, so I know what I'm saying when I talk about fish n' chips, and unfortunately these weren't really doing it for me. The fries were good, thinly cut and were seasoned in what seemed like a paprika type mixture. It might've even been Old Bay seasoning. One thing is for sure, they were pretty good. My friend got the fried shrimp which came with fries and cocktail sauce and really liked it. I tried one of his shrimps and they were great! Cooked perfectly, and had a crispy, flavorful batter that had a little kick to it and the batter on it was not heavy at all. Really good! This place doesn't just have a quick bite to eat, it's also a giant fish market with fish that looked pretty fresh! One thing I must say that broke my heart though, was the way their lobsters were being housed. They were all piled into very small containers which were each labeled with how much they weighed. The lobsters you could tell, were cramped and uncomfortable. Also, with storing lobsters like that, even though their claws were clamped with elastics, they can still damage each other and the lobsters in conditions such as those, can die pretty easily as well.

Given that I didn't know anything about oysters, I told the guy at the oyster bar that it was my first time and asked what he would recommend, and he asked if I preferred sweet or salty, and make a few suggestions based on that. I appreciate that he took the time to ask and figure out what I might like to make sure my first time was worth it and it definitely was. The oysters are super fresh and between $1.50-$2.75 each so it makes it easy to just go and enjoy as many as oysters as you like (or can afford, lol).The store itself is very crowded and the seating isnt the best, but Chelsea market itself has a bunch of seating in the complex so finding a seat isnt too terrible.",The Lobster Place,4.0 star rating,$$,"Seafood, Markets,, Seafood"

I'm not sure if it was as good as Luke's rolls, which are my current favorite, and they might even be smaller than theirs for roughly the same price, but it was damn good nonetheless and I also liked the New England clam chowder I got.  Bottom line: the sandwiches, lobster and soups in the back might be your best bet.

The nice gentleman behind the counter informed me that they didn't receive any that morning although he did have Jonah crab claws for me to try.The Jonah claws were succulent and juicy, although not as meaty as the stone crab claws were fabled to be.

With that being said, I ordered oysters from the raw bar. It took about 7 minutes just to get their attention beyond the rows of people standing and waiting to order. It literally felt like 1am at a crowded bar. Once I got close enough to order, I was shocked at how expensive they were (around $3.00, $3.50 for a single east coast oyster). I'll pay that when I'm seated, in a restaurant, being served - but this place is a marketplace, so the price is a little outrageous. Since I came all this way, I ordered a dozen variety oysters. It ended up being $44. 16 minutes later, they called out my number on my receipt, and I balanced my plate while eating, since there was nowhere to sit (I was so annoyed that there were people sitting at the barstools NOT eating). The first 3 oysters I ate where sandy and had chunks of shell. I looked at the guys shucking oysters and they were in the weeds, I figured that was why mine were half-assed. I threw the rest out because the sand was such a turn off.

The waitress was very attentive, and offered great advice on both sake and sushi. I had one of the omakase nigiri dishes, and chatted with the sushi chef as he created the meal.

The calamari had peppers fried with it in the batter which was cool but unexpected so we initially thought it was like squid blood or something. We have no background in seafood hematology. It was very crispy and a nice kick with the sauce. A tad over fried.My crab cake sandwich was small for the price but it was worth it once I took a bite. It is very quality crab no fake filler and fresh. I honestly don't think I've had a better one outside of MD or higher end restaurants.

527,1-cTC4hlbzFXyQcofaP9Vw,Kevin S.,2.0 star rating,"Wow. It seems like it's been a while since I've written a poor review. Well, here it goes.After being so excited about visiting Lobster Place, I had finally arrived. I started with a lobster bisque. It was horrible! My chowder was bland and had hardly and lobster flavor in it whatsoever. There were also just little scraps of meat floating around in it as apposed to having some chunks. I did not finish it as I decided to save the fat on something else in Chelsea Market. So I'm 0 for 1.Next up was the moment I was waiting for, the lobster roll! The first thing I noticed was that it was smaller than other lobster rolls I've eaten previously, and had a pickle on top. Well, a pickle does not belong on a lobster roll, I can now tell you that from experience. The meat was served cold, which is no problem, but some of the pieces seemed to still be a little frozen in the middle! The bread was also nothing to write home about. Where's that good bread I've been having everywhere else? It was still edible because I was eating lobster after all, but why have mediocrity when I could have gone with something better and cheaper? Easily the worst lobster roll I've ever eaten. I guess I'm 0 for 2.To top of my lunch was a chocolate chip cookie (they gave me an extra one too, so points for that). Not that this would make or break the deal, but it was the worst chocolate chip cookie I had ever eaten. I ended up giving the other one away to a stranger. Hooray! 0 for 3.In conclusion, this was not a good experience for me. I was extremely disappointed. That being said, I do like what they have going for them with their selections of fresh seafood. I am sure I would have been able to find something enjoyable there had I been willing to buy two lunches in the same day.

528,eYmXgEYwkSbx101ZHkkjDw,Karen C.,4.0 star rating,"A fish market that smells good? What is this sorcery?It feels kind of redundant to give a 4-star place with 700 reviews, another 4-star review, but I like coming here and I feel like I owe it to them to give them a solid rating! Even though it's 50% fish market, 20% sushi bar/take out, 20% raw bar, and 10% ready made food or DIY shucking supplies, it still feels very clean and I feel completely safe ordering raw oysters and clams not even 7 feet away from fish fillets and whole fish being sold for cooking. There are salt water fountains practically drowning the lobsters in the back of the market and even with all that salt water running and hitting the lobsters I still feel clean walking around and having a raw appetizer here.The downsides to the Lobster Place are that this is unfortunately far from a hidden gem, because its located in tourist central AKA Chelsea Market (okay maybe Times Sq gets that title, but the Market is at least a runner up) and it doesn't help that Chelsea Market is neighbors with the High Line, another crowded tourist area. It's crowded here at all times of the day, except in the morning. Coming at any time after lunch is like trying to navigate the subway during rush hour. It's real bad. They have standing bars you can eat your raw bar goodies at with small jars of different raw bar condiments like mignonette, cocktail sauce, and horseradish(?) but some of their customers are inconsiderate and move them around or don't put the lid and spoons back where they belong which gets annoying. Often times when I come in the afternoon I have to go find seating outside of the Lobster Place in order to chow down, because there ain't no way in hell I'm carrying my tray of raw oysters and clams outside in the NYC summer heat. That's just nasty, nooo thank you. It takes a couple minutes of stress and frustration finding a place to eat but once you do it is so worth it because their raw bar is fresh and juicy. They're good at shucking while keeping the delicious oyster/clam liquid in the half-shell which not all places are good at, so don't take it for granted that you get that extra briny water!Another downside is that their sushi is of meh quality. I expected better from a fish market, especially a highly popular one, but the fish is just meh and the prices are not meh, they are oh god where did my money go?? I asked one of the sushi chefs if he could make the same box as one of the ones he put out in the refrigerated to-go section except with squid instead of tuna/shrimp, and he said he couldn't because those boxes were specially priced to be that cheap, and if I wanted it substituted for squid I would have to pay for EACH PIECE A LA CARTE. That would have literally costed more than twice the price. Yeah, literally. Like the price would have gone up from ~$15 to somewhere in the 40s. The selection in each box looked completely random because each of those ""specially priced"" boxes had different fish in them, and the box that had every fish that I did want (with the squid instead of tuna/shrimp) were made with brown rice and I like my rice white. He said he would have to charge a la carte pricing if he simply switched the two rices, even though white rice is actually cheaper than brown rice... Cmon guys, I'm literally saving you money here, and you're going to charge me extra for it? Talk about poor policy.Even though it seems like I have a whole lot more to complain about than I have to praise about, in a world where fish markets are typically smelly, dirty, and overall unpleasant, this fish market somehow manages to be none of those and that is more than enough to warrant a four star rating. Plus it isn't their fault they're popular!

I can't think of any other better place to get lobster. Well, I lie, I'm sure I can.I grew up in New Jersey and visited New York very, very often, yet last week was my first time going. I ordered a steamed medium lobster, $14.50 a pound, and lobster bisque. The lobster was very reasonably priced, and it was so delicious. The lobster is prepared with all the vital spots cracked open, thus making it very easy for one to consume at a fast pace. Butter is included as well. The lobster bisque was a bit creamy, and it paired with the lobster well.My small gripe is that there is basically no seating inside, just a few chairs. However, there are tables outside, and if you are lucky, you can cop a seat or two there. I only tried the lobster and the bisque, though I hear the others are good as well. The raw oysters looked scrumptious, and I will be adding that to my list when I return here.

Whole grilled lobsters with garlic butter for twenty dollars, oyster po boys and lobster rolls are amongst the other fresh and excellent value hot options.For something lighter for lunch the sushi, sashimi and seafood salads (Tuna nicoise, crab club for example) are excellent.For those with time to sit in - there's a fresh seafood bar, and I can vouch for the variety and freshness of the oysters - delicious.Lastly, for those cooking at home, this is the best fishmongers in NYC with huge variety of line caught, prepared dishes and smoked choices.

If you like oysters, I recommend the Kumamoto because it's got a really traditional oyster taste. It's high in salinity, if that means anything to you. They're kinda small but real real juicy. It was everything I loved in an oyster. The oyster pond has a slight sweet aftertaste and it's really light and fresh tasting as well. I would recommend this type to people who are maybe new at trying oysters. It has a really pleasant aftertaste too. The schoodic was similar to the oyster pond but it was slightly larger and I thought was a bit sweeter too.

See, we were going to shove as much food as humanly possible down our gullets during this trip. After seeing a lady dig into a giant freshly steamed lobster, we immediately entered the Lobster Place. So much seafood! Fish and clams and oysters and lobsters and sushi and things I'd never even heard of lay there on the ice, glimmering coldly as I snapped photos that were relatively uninspired. After a couple of freshly shucked oysters, we headed to the back where we hemmed and hawed. Fresh lobster... or lobster roll? We decided on the easier-to-eat option and sampled some soup while we were waiting (pro-tip -- they'll give you little sample cups if you're nice enough.) Our roll came out hot and glistening with butter. The lobster was oh so fresh, presumably having just been removed from it's crustaceous shell and we enjoyed every last morsel. We did want a little more flavor though so we asked the folks behind the counter for some more Old Bay. It gave it that zing zang of old bay. Delicious. Tragically, our soup samplers were really nothing to write home about. The lobster bisque tasted weirdly plastic-y and I wanted more clam from the clam chowder. So if you're on a belly budget -- like we were -- do the lobster, skip the soup and then clamber on to the next place.",The Lobster Place,4.0 star rating,$$,"Seafood, Markets,, Seafood"

You order the lobster, either small, medium or a large. And they steam it up, put it on a tray with butter and you dig in! I usually  have to share a medium lobster with my boyfriend. We each get a claw, and a side of the lobster tail.  It can get messy, so a first date to chow on lobster like this, may be not a good idea. Around the lobster place, there are beautiful other seafood in the market. Once you walk in, you get a fresh whiff of seafood,  if you are into that stuff.  I've also tried the different kinds of clams that they open right in front of you. Depending on what kind of fancy clams/oysters you want, you tell the guy, and they are happy to open them for you.

They've got all sorts of fish, clams, scallops, and lobster available for you to pick up and prepare. The fish is better quality, IMO, than the cuts you would pick up at a Whole Foods (much less your average NYC grocery store). To boot, the salmon and the Chilean sea bass are both rich and full of flavor, and you get a much better deal preparing a solid recipe on your own than going out and buying the same dish at a restaurant.The prepared food they have is also extremely solid. The lobster roll at $17 is pretty steep, but it's full of fresh lobster meat that is complemented well by an assortment of veggies and herbs. I wouldn't call it as savory as the lobster roll I've had at Luke's, but it's still pretty freakin' good. The clam chowder here is also fantastic...one of the best I've had outside of any Boston shops.If you need to pick up some seafood, this is the place to come - no way around it. The prices are reasonable, but I trust that I'm getting the best quality fish I can from here, whereas I wouldn't venture to say the same of any grocery stores.

I lived in Chelsea for 25 years and remember the excitement when it opened as a largely wholesale establishment, so I made the trip down to NYC for some Chilean Sea Bass for the holidays ($50), and wow, what a disappointment. Simply put, the fish was tough and tasteless; I thought the fishmonger's difficulty cutting it sprang from a dull knife (and I said as much to him), but actually it was just a fish that wasn't fit for consumption. So to top things off I wrote to let them know and promptly heard back (a full month ago now!) from their ""Director, Retail and Restaurant,"" who stated ""I'm going to touch base with our staff regarding your issues, however in the mean time, I'd love to mail you a gift card to the address in your email that will cover the fish as well as an additional amount in hopes you'll give us another shot."" Guess what?! A month later he hasn't sent me a thing! (And no thanks, there's no need to send me anything now.) Don't be fooled by the crowds of one-time tourists buying prepared food here, this is no longer a fish market for those who know fish.

You will have to make your way through crowds of tourists and past many shops that cater to them but eventually you will find yourself in a fish market that offers just about any variety of fish you could want. After living in Maine for a few years, I developed a love of haddock and this market was the only place in Manhattan I could find that offered it. It also stocked a similar fish known as hake and both of them were priced at about $9.00 a pound in 2015. These fish were sold as fillets, beautifully presented without any bones and as fresh as possible. The fish trays in this market are arranged around the room for taste (from mild fish to stronger tasting ones) and the knowledgeable staff is helpful in assisting buyers who may not be certain what to buy.

Don't forget to add the hot sauce to your soup!Oysters, It's so nice to be able to see all the fresh oysters available and be able to choose which ones you want instead of looking at a list from a menu not knowing how they look. Decided to go with three from the east coast. I never remember which ones I eat but one of them was from Martha's Vineyard! The guys shuck them for you (for a price).

With those factors in mind, we decided to head to The Lobster Place for lunch, as my Uncle (he had to take care of some business, so he could not join us this time :() and Aunt agreed that the food was excellent and that he even buys all of his seafood there, as he feels that the quality is excellent. Upon entry, we found The Lobster to be immaculate, large, and very crowded. There are many different counters for things like different types of fish and shellfish, a counter where you could buy different types of cooked food (like oysters, lobster meals, and seafood sandwiches), and of course, the sushi bar, where we went to first, as we were in the mood for sushi and heard excellent feedback about their sushi bar. Needless to say, the feedback proved to be more than correct as the sushi proved to be absolutely excellent! Since the wait to sit at the sushi bar proved to be long, we decided to get sushi from the refrigerated case, as it looked very fresh and they had what we wanted. I got a platter with salmon, tuna, squid, and California Rolls along with iced green tea to drink, my mom got Salmon Sashimi, and my Aunt got Lobster Tempura Rolls. While we were not worried about the price, we found that the prices were in line with what we paid at other sushi restaurants (i.e. a piece of Salmon was $2.25/piece, in line with other places I frequent as that's in the $2-$3 range). When we finally found a spot along the counter to eat our food, we were all impressed with our food. I found my sushi platter to be fantastic, as the Salmon was the perfect temperature, had a satiny sheen, and a buttery mouth feel. The tuna was pristine as well, as it melted in my mouth and was pleasantly meaty. The squid was tender and pleasantly salty while the California rolls had slightly sweet and meaty crab along with creamy avocado, and pleasantly vinegary rice. My mom, who is very picky about sushi and sashimi also loved her Salmon Sashimi, as she also found it to be the perfect temperature, had a satiny sheen, and a buttery mouth feel. While I did not try my Aunt's Lobster Tempura Roll, she felt that it was excellent. Since we loved our sushi so much, both me and my mom got second helpings of sushi, with the friendly and hard working sushi chefs making me a fresh Spicy Tuna Roll without mayo, which was smooth and very spicy! My mom loved her second helping of Salmon Sashimi and was in sushi heaven. After our delicious meal, we both perused the fish market and found the many different types of seafood to be very fresh and for some of the seafood we would buy, we were surprised that the prices were not as high as we thought they would be and even reasonable in some cases, with Atlantic Salmon being priced at about $12.95/lb, which is on par with Fairway and Whole Foods, so that was not bad at all.

So I walked around Chelsea Market for a place to sit, there really isn't much seating inside The Lobster Place. I finally found a seat, by one of the ATMs next to some tourists.

The roll was small & it wasn't warm. Aren't the rolls supposed to be warm? What ev's I was hungry. I have eaten lobster rolls before and I felt there was something missing from this one. Don't know what it was, but it tasted a bit bland, as if I cracked the lobster myself & ate it straight with no butter, nothing. Hey I'm not knocking it, there are obviously incredible reviews about the roll from others. Like I said I'm not much of a fish person, so who knows. Welp I finished that sucker with the tourists looking in awe on how I can just eat tht roll with no care in the world. Needless to say, I was still pretty hungry. Would I buy it again? Nope.

For me there was a fishy aftertaste. She liked these, I liked the Totten Island. There are descriptions for each one though, so you can pick and choose what you want to experience.*** Escargot- 425 degrees for 10 minutes--more or less, depending on how soft you want it. We took these home and baked it. You definitely want some good, fresh bread to eat with this--and there is an excellent place not 50 feet away-ish. The basil-butter worked wonders with the escargot. I know we prepared ours a little chewy. I've also had escargot with pesto, which is another option if you are taking it home. Just find a perfect wine with this dish, and you're all set.AtmosphereStrong, fish smells all around. Some people even covered their faces as they walked by. Living near the ocean, I guess I was used to it? I did enjoy walking around and seeing the variety of different seafood they had to offer. Still, it acts basically as a fish market and cafe combined.ServiceThe service was okay, you're not expecting waiter service here, just guys who know what they're doing, and that's most important. If you want some good deals, have a girl order, because she got goodies I didn't get. Haha.AmenitiesThey do shuck your oysters, I'm sure they also provide other services, like when you buy fish, etc.ConclusionI really need to come back here for some chowder and/or bisque.

The cookie was a nice added touch, nothing memorable, but let's be honest, I wasn't there for the cookie.  I was there for the lobster roll.  And my God was it good.This lobster roll was probably one of the best I've had in NYC.  Like most rolls I've tried, the meat was overflowing on to the roll, and the lobster roll consisted of meat and mayo. I noticed though that these were big chunks of meat.  Everything tasted super fresh, and I think my favorite part of the whole roll was the chives on the very top.  This gave some additional flavor, without being too overpowering.If you are thinking of going to the High Line, stop by The Lobster Place first and grab one of these boxes to go.  The lobster roll is great, and it's even better that you'll get a whole meal out of it for $4 more.  Personally, I think The Lobster Place, followed by High Line is a cute date idea or a great way to catch up with friends.",The Lobster Place,4.0 star rating,$$,"Seafood, Markets,, Seafood"

I expected my new pet lobster roll to be so loaded with flavor that any silly illusions of 'size doesn't matter' would be justified for the first time in my life.Second Disappointment: Size does matter.

Me and my date tried a few from Maine and New Brunswick. It was about $1.50-2 each, after the shucking price, which is a hell of deal as opposed to getting it from an oyster bar which can range from $3-4 per oyster. They even arrange it in a to-go platter, with lemons and ice, which is a nice touch.

They are fresh, full of juicy lobster meat (unlike those lobsters you see that have probably been living for months inside of those tanks at certain restaurants) and are seasoned perfectly! They even give you the option of leaving the lobster whole or opened (they provided a free service and will open up the lobsters for you for easy access and less hassle).

Norwegian smoked salmon is just too salty for my taste, and the the real Irish goodness can be too rich for my blood... Well, wallet... especially if I'm looking to feed 20 people for brunch. Also, two words: salmon burgers, a real dinner saver, quick and delicious at about $5 each, they also feel a little fancy... especially when I pan sear with a cumin and goat cheese topping.

The small is $3.50, medium is $5, large is $6.25, and soup in a bread bowl is $7.95. The crab soup didn't have much crab meat to it but the spicy flavor was nice. The New England clam chowder was excellent. The chowder was creamy and thick but not too thick (if you stand a plastic spoon up in the chowder it should fall down), the potatoes were cooked and cut correctly, the clams were tender and the overall salt/pepper seasoning was well balanced.

You'll see people milling about or walking up and down trying to snag seats because there's very little of it. However, if you go on a good day, grab your food and go eat at the High Line, where there's plenty of seats and shade where you can eat and people watch at the same time. Now on to the food. While this store does also sell raw seafood, its their Shack in the Back that really brings the crowds. Whether its fresh steamed lobster or one of their wraps, everything tastes super fresh, and is super duper delicious. I myself have tried many of their wraps. The lobster wrap is a bit on the pricey side, but is definitely worth it for the experience and jam packed with huge huge chunks of lobster meat. I personally like the smoked salmon when I'm craving some seafood for lunch. It's very flavorful and filling. But, the best thing about this place is the soups, namely the clam chowder. Every single time I pass by the area, I must get myself a cup of clam chowder because it is just so authentic and creamy. The oyster crackers are complementary, which is also a plus.

I stumbled across this place while checking out Chelsea Market for the first time and when I put my eyes on their corn scallop chowder I could not resist trying it. This chowder soup could potentially be the best soup I have ever tasted in my entire life! (forget about the Soup Nazi) and that includes eating at some of the best soup spots in San Francisco to 5 star resorts on Lanai (Hawaii).

Their fresh seafood selection looks amazing, but I usually come for eating lunch on the spot. I'm not sure but they may even be more famous for their sushi, you know... because of their fresh inventory and a published review up on the wall... ?

They also have Lobster Bisque, Manhattan and Clam Chowder that all look great too, but I have not been able to break away from that Corn Scallop chowder (amazing!) Some day I may build up the willpower to do it, when my psyche is focused and I feel stronger :)

This is definitely one of the jewels of NYC. I highly recommend stopping in and checking out everything else Chelsea market has to offer as well. Just don't be confused with the Hale & Hearty Soup chain right before The Lobster Place, because it doesn't even come close! In fact, I am amazed that so many people eat their as I pass by heading to the Lobster Place.

No horseradish or cocktail sauce. People love the lobster bisque and while it is creamy and delicious, I sometimes find it too heavy. I still recommend trying it if you haven't had it before. As for the fish, they carry a pretty wide variety but really only the tuna and salmon are sushi grade.

But when you move on down the coast on the way to LA, you have to stop by San Luis Obispo for their clam chowder. And I just have to say, that SLO still has my heart. The Lobster Place is true in all its glory. Fresh fish, fresh lobster, fresh oysters, fresh everything. You can literally smell the freshness seeping from its walls. First they lure you in with their cart of fresh oysters, clams and cocktail shrimp. They literally shuck the oysters in front of you as you order from the cart. Perfection. Then they lure you with all the people eating outside and inside the store -just a look at the lobster roll is enough to make you walk in. Then, when you're inside, you just can't help yourself to some fresh sushi, or some chowder -which you have 5 different kinds to choose from. I was overwhelmed. I did not know what to get. The menu was huge and everything sounded so good. I was contemplating on getting a sandwich and soup or maybe a salad and soup. But I wasn't all that hungry -and prices were all that cheap. I settled on a bread bowl and chowder. But I would definitely want to try the lobster roll ($17) or the salmon on a baguette ($8). The already made salads looked good as well ($6-8). Anyway, moving on. They also offer whole lobsters (market price). So anyway, I ordered and waited for them to ""hollow"" out the inside of the bread ""bowl."" I'm not sure what kind of bread it was -from Amy's Bread. It was warm, fresh, but all he did was pull out the inside and stick on the side of my plate. He didn't bother grilling the top piece of the bread or retoasting the bowl. I was a bit disappointed.Now, the chowders... There was Manhattan Clam Chowder (pass), New England Clam Chowder (maybe), Crab Soup (meh), Lobster Bisque (possibly), and finally, scallop and bacon chowder (BINGO). It was the right choice. I'm not a big fan of clams. Let's just say I like more potatoes than clams in my chowder, but scallops instead?!?!? I was in heaven. I didn't really taste the bacon. The flavor was all in all good. Not the best I had, but up to standards. I would go back to try the lobster bisque. The bread was okay.This place is great. I would definitely come back to try other things. It's a bit hard to figure out where to order and pay at first (two separate areas). But you'll figure it out. Seating is VERY VERY VERY limited.

Maine lobsters didn't acquire a reputation for nothing, after all.In all the lobster I've eaten in all it's culinary forms (lobster rolls, soups, stews, in pasta, omelets...boiled, steamed, grilled, etc), one of the best experiences eating lobster I've ever had is the lobster bisque at Lobster Place. It's not too buttery and has a nice balance of cream, onion, garlic and other savory ingredients. The flavor is off-the-chart exquisite, and up until recently, when I worked in a company on the second floor of Chelsea Market, I was getting the largest container of lobster bisque at least two times a week...sometimes more. Throw in some crackers, and it makes for a delicious, tummy-filled lunch. I couldn't get enough. It's that fantastic. Certainly if you're ever strolling through the market, save your appetite for the bisque. I kid you not you won't be disappointed.On the whole, Lobster Place offers an assortment of fresh fish, lobsters and shellfish, a variety of other soups, frozen foods, specialty items, and other oceanic edibles to indulge your craving for seafood.

However, it's a welcome change for sure.The soup itself is a bit thicker than campbell's. They also use larger clam pieces than campbells; that's a big plus there. They throw in Sunshine brand oyster crackers with the soup. The crackers go pretty well with the soup.

1069,XfR2vmNWu16ZH6STYqU-9A,Ryan S.,5.0 star rating,"The first thing you notice when you step into The Lobster Place is the smell. I never thought I would fall in love with the smell of a fish market, but the fare here is so unbelievably fresh that there is no rotting, salty, ocean reek. There is only the smell of ice, scales, and shells. Every type of seafood you can imagine: shrimps, lobsters, clams, oysters, several varieties of smoked salmon, whole fish of every kind, are presented and practically begging to be consumed on the spot.I bought tuna sashimi and selected three bluepoint oysters, which were shucked for me (for a fee of 20 cents per oyster). The tuna was the deepest red I'd ever seen and so fresh it was almost transparent. I could bite through it like butter. The avocado slices, pickled ginger, wasabi, and even the sliced daikon on which everything was topped were all irresistible. The oysters were so fresh, they still had salt water in their shells. This, with a squirt of lemon, made for the best oysters I have ever eaten (sadly, I haven't been able to replicate the experience since).Please come here. You won't be disappointed. It's a little pricey, but it's definitely worth the culinary experience. The Lobster Place reminded me of the scene in Hearts of Atlantis where Anthony Hopkins tells that kid ""Your first kiss is the one by which all others will be measured"".

That time I ended up and almost immediately regretting eating at Hale & Hearty which was also in Chelsea Market. I was not at all disappointed in my much anticipated return. I mean how could I be? The Burton Sample Sale was great! I got a helmet, 2 pairs of goggles and boots all for under $200. That's a steal considering that they were all 2010 items. Oh man I got sidetracked.. hard not to with all my lovely new snowboarding gear sitting right next to me.But anyway back to the food at The Lobster Place. I bought a spicy salmon avocado roll and a white tuna avocado roll that came out to about a bit under $6 each. My brother and sister who had accompanied me got the lobster bisque, shrimp salad wrap and eel avocado roll. My sushi was delicious as I had already expected. I just couldn't decide on what to order as I watched the men behind the counter cutting the fresh fish and making fresh batches of sushi to be put out. The lobster bisque was somewhat good. Although it was a bit heavy on the butter. After half a cup it was too much to handle. The shrimp salad wrap was amazing. I had only one bite and I just didn't want to give it back. Even now I still wish I had gotten the shrimp salad instead of one of my rolls. Now I've got the shakes from withdrawel. Didn't try the eel avocado roll though. Eel has never been a favorable food for me. I always end up getting poked by the tiny bones or scales or whatever those things are.After reading some reviews I'm thinking I should have tried the oysters on the half shell. About $1.25-$2.50 each and $.20 to shuck? Sign me up! So here is my order for next time: shrimp salad, oysters of the half shell and a different soup. Score, score and more score!

Unless you wait for 30 min for a freshly-steamed lobster, all the lobsters are pre-cooked and been siting on the shelves for hours (hopefully not longer); once you place the order, they spend 2 minutes to warm it up.  We ordered a 2-1/2 pound lobster first - it came out lukewarm and the meat was tough and dry, did not feel fresh at all; we asked the staff to reheat it and he looked pissed.  Since it's a big lobster, the shell was extremely tough; even though they cut off the top of the claws, it was still very difficult to get the meat out with the flimsy plastic utensils. After finishing this one ($50), we felt so unsatisfied that we ordered another one, a 1-3/4 pound.  This one is a little better as it's smaller - the meat is more tender, the shell is easier to break, and it's warmed up more thoroughly than the first one.  However, overall, it's a disappointing experience - took a lot of effort to get the meat out and it tastes rubbery as if it were leftover stuff from two days ago.",The Lobster Place,4.0 star rating,$$,"Seafood, Markets,, Seafood"
