11,ZZELut-m0rSyivf8saCMKA,Mark S.,4.0 star rating,"Weekend brunch review.....This was actually my second visit after having been here last weekend.  It is a vegan/vegetarian place but you will never miss the meat.  Their dishes will tempt any person's appetite and the flavors are on point.  They opened a couple of months ago and the outdoor patio, although quaint, was pretty full on a dreary day. For drinks we each had the iced coffee, with myself requesting and getting a shot of espresso added.  The Mrs. had the omelette special which consisted of tomato, basil and mozzarella. It was accompanied by roasted potatoes, a refreshing arugula and whole grain toast.  I in turn enjoyed what I had last weekend so much that I ordered it again, the Acai bowl.  It was served with plenty of fresh fruit, bee pollen and chia seeds.  I kept getting brain freeze eating it so fast. Look, if you want to break up the monotony that can be weekend brunch, The Cliff is like a breath of fresh air with their menu. That is coming from someone who is a carnivore and throughly enjoys weekend brunch.

We all were very pleased with our experience.The place has a few tables but the environment is inviting and cozy. They also have a back patio area that we weren't able to sit in because of the weather (boo). The brunch menu had some great choices but I decided on the Brioche French Toast topped with mascarpone, almonds, berries. Delicious. A side of scrambled eggs paired perfectly. I ordered an ice latte and it was great. I always feel like I need to go a little further then what I would like to get myself a decent iced latte but seems like The Cliff is a contender to be one of my top choices. I am a bit disappointed that the small latte is $4.00 and if I compare this to my next place- Black Rail, I can get a medium at the same price tag. Gary, the owner, was super friendly and wanted to make sure our experience was a good one.

I can't give it less stars even though I desperately want to because their regular menu items are pretty spot on delicious. I just wish these carry-out items were easier to carry out and didn't leak from the paper bag. I understand it's fried, but I'm sure there's a better way to package this. I feel really uncomfortable eating this dripping in canola oil. Just wish the owners would think about this when putting it on the menu. Despite all that it does taste good, but you have to look past the oily food.

All of the drinks were delish but if your brunch is not complete without bubbly, they do offer a variety of fresh-squeezed juices and you can BYOB. Our waitress was so lovely, and Gary, the owner, is fantastic. My friend Joe and I are hobbyist photographers and we wanted to take pics of the adorable patio area. We didn't realize that they had cleared the placesettings because of the rain. Without asking, the staff re-set the tables. They take pride in their restaurant and want to represent it at it's best.

Not sure why not on menu as put mint in watermelon and have the lemonade.  It would be better if mint allowed to steep in.The French toast looked amazing but like most thick cut toast was a bit dry. I wish the bread was half as thick and got 4 slices.  Also could use less marscapone and more syrup.  Fruit tasted fresh. Food gets 3.On a sunny day this place gets 5 star as perfect backyard.  The main part is very cute as got all the requisite cute cafe coffee shop look.,The Cliff,4.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (Traditional),, Scandinavian"
31,ZZELut-m0rSyivf8saCMKA,Mark S.,4.0 star rating,"Weekend brunch review.....This was actually my second visit after having been here last weekend.  It is a vegan/vegetarian place but you will never miss the meat.  Their dishes will tempt any person's appetite and the flavors are on point.  They opened a couple of months ago and the outdoor patio, although quaint, was pretty full on a dreary day. For drinks we each had the iced coffee, with myself requesting and getting a shot of espresso added.  The Mrs. had the omelette special which consisted of tomato, basil and mozzarella. It was accompanied by roasted potatoes, a refreshing arugula and whole grain toast.  I in turn enjoyed what I had last weekend so much that I ordered it again, the Acai bowl.  It was served with plenty of fresh fruit, bee pollen and chia seeds.  I kept getting brain freeze eating it so fast. Look, if you want to break up the monotony that can be weekend brunch, The Cliff is like a breath of fresh air with their menu. That is coming from someone who is a carnivore and throughly enjoys weekend brunch.

We all were very pleased with our experience.The place has a few tables but the environment is inviting and cozy. They also have a back patio area that we weren't able to sit in because of the weather (boo). The brunch menu had some great choices but I decided on the Brioche French Toast topped with mascarpone, almonds, berries. Delicious. A side of scrambled eggs paired perfectly. I ordered an ice latte and it was great. I always feel like I need to go a little further then what I would like to get myself a decent iced latte but seems like The Cliff is a contender to be one of my top choices. I am a bit disappointed that the small latte is $4.00 and if I compare this to my next place- Black Rail, I can get a medium at the same price tag.

I can't give it less stars even though I desperately want to because their regular menu items are pretty spot on delicious. I just wish these carry-out items were easier to carry out and didn't leak from the paper bag. I understand it's fried, but I'm sure there's a better way to package this. I feel really uncomfortable eating this dripping in canola oil. Just wish the owners would think about this when putting it on the menu.

Not huge, but tons of light and really interesting details everywhere. The brunch menu has a lot of delish options. Ya'll know i'm a carnivore at heart but I honestly didn't miss the meat in this meal. The menu is vegetarian and vegan but there's something for everyone. I had the brioche french toast - delicious! The mascarpone was perfect, the berries were fresh, and it was a satisfying portion. I had a fresh lemonade that was so refreshing and delicious. All of the drinks were delish but if your brunch is not complete without bubbly, they do offer a variety of fresh-squeezed juices and you can BYOB. Our waitress was so lovely, and Gary, the owner, is fantastic. My friend Joe and I are hobbyist photographers and we wanted to take pics of the adorable patio area. We didn't realize that they had cleared the placesettings because of the rain. Without asking, the staff re-set the tables. They take pride in their restaurant and want to represent it at it's best. That was an above and beyond moment, something that shows us they're attentive to their customers. I'm so glad to be back in the neighborhood.

The Cliff is exactly what's needed around here and suits much of the younger commuter demographic well. The food is fine. As a meat-eater I kinda wish there was a an option to maybe add chicken to my salad- I also think it would be better for business- but, having worked in a kitchen before, I know there is plenty to love about the simplicity of having a meat-free kitchen. Vibe is friendly casual, service is super pleasant, and prices are appropriate enough. If I still lived in the area, I MIGHT'VE come back.

I haven't been to California (yet), but -- between the menu options, the decor, and the service -- I felt a very California cool vibe. Before my friends and I stepped foot inside the manager meets us by the door to escort us in. It was an impressively warm welcome. I don't know about you, but that hasn't happened to me at even the fanciest of restaurants. We sat outside in the back patio. I highly recommend sitting there if the weather permits. It added that extra oomph to the overall experience. - 4 Stars for Service & Ambience - How's the food? One word: REFRESHING. We went for weekend brunch and we had plenty unique options to choose from, including an array of non-alcoholic beverages. I'm not sure if this place is BYOB. We ordered the French Toast for the table, per the recommendation of our hospitable host. And, I will now recommend that to you. Then, I ordered the acai bowl and the rest of my companions ordered a delicious egg dish. Their meal consisted of an omelette of eggs with mushrooms, tomatoes, and goat cheese plus a small arugula salad, whole wheat toast, and potatoes. Honestly, I regretted my selection as soon as their food came out.

Music was super loud and euro-trash techno. Could not hear soft spoken waitress. Love the colorful umbrella ""ceiling"" outside on patio. Whole grain bread I had with avocado sandwich was delish. Hate the fact they're out of he bean burger and don't serve any hamburgers (grass fed beef burger would be appreciated) they just have Cod burgers and I loathe Fish. Never assume everyone loves fish. Blech. Portions are generous apart from the latte, which is very tiny and expensive. In fact I feel it's all very overpriced & sadly overrated. Menu online looks much better than it is in reality.

Excellent breakfast/brunch options, especially for the health conscious crowd, and their ice coffee is arguably the best in the area.

After sitting and watching everyone around us get seated and eat their meals. We knew something was up, we were FORGOTTEN. Took about an hour to get cold French toast and an acai bowl.

This time, I asked for my bread to not have butter (note to the restaurant: If you're going to have vegan meals, don't butter the bread. Or, better yet, have vegan butter like Smart Balance/Earth Balance). My boyfriend ordered a regular meal and they didn't butter his bread either so he asked for butter. That's just a minor inconvenience but it seemed like they were forgetting everything, and we had to keep asking for more things, which they kept forgetting. (Sugar for my coffee, hot sauce, salt and pepper, water, etc.). The fruit bowl was not the best - I love blackberries and they were super tart.",The Cliff,4.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (Traditional),, Scandinavian"
78,InNWfDUlC347aTm7P1qVPA,Alaysha H.,5.0 star rating,"As a new resident of Jersey City, I was afraid that the city would not have as much to offer in terms of restaurants and charismatic brunch spots as my previous home town of Hoboken. However, after spotting the hipster-chic and organic restaurant The Cliff on Yelp, I made the short drive to the restaurant. I was captivated by the artful pictures of organic foods that decorated several high rated Yelp reviews. When I finally got to The Cliff, I was stunned. It was a diamond in the ruff, in that such a charming place existed along the small street in Jersey City. Instantly, I was greeted by smiling hostesses and unique decor. The interior of the restaurant was clean, cute, and had several pieces of unique and artful designs. When my guest and I were seated in the back patio, I was amazed. The umbrella installment across the skyline as well as the unique table and chair setup was a sight to behold in itself, and reminded me of a carefully crafted art show. We had learned that the owner and his family built the place from the ground up, and that each unique piece of the restaurant was hand crafted. I encourage everyone to ask to hear the history of the place when visiting. The only thing better than the setup (and the tiny succulent planes placed on each table) was by far the food. The chef was undoubtedly talented. From the presentation (any picture the food is guaranteed to get a couple hundred likes on instagram) to the combinations of tastes to the portion sizes, everything was unbelievable. My guest and I ordered five meals to split between the two of us, simply so we could try many things on the menu. We cleaned our plates--every one. I would recommend the French Toast, Pressed Samswiches, and Acai Bowl. I highly suggest visiting The Cliff for breakfast lunch and dinner if you are able. Such a wonderful place--will be back several times over.",The Cliff,4.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (Traditional),, Scandinavian"
79,li248O_kxbLEX-hLic8H1A,Veronica A.,3.0 star rating,"I was eager to try this place out since it was new. On a Tuesday early afternoon I stopped in with my kids for brunch. We decided to sit outside. The waitress was sweet but a bit lax. It took awhile to get our order in which made my kids want to get up and run all over. Finally the food  came out and everything looked great. My only issue was the not so hard boiled eggs my son ordered. As I began to peel the eggs I noticed that they were soft boiled with a very tiny center. The cook tried to re-do them but they came out runny again. Sadly, I just am not sure I would return. The atmosphere is cute but the mixed up with the eggs gave me a bad vibe.",The Cliff,4.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (Traditional),, Scandinavian"

The price is a bit expensive but being that it's the only vegan restaurant around the area, I overstand. They greeted me when I walked in and were polite. The food is made when you order. You will wait a bit but it's all worth it ! They served eggs as well which kinda confused me because it's a vegan restaurant but hey ! Who cares.

83,9-Wsoq-e5WgmAy6-x4STHQ,Hando E.,5.0 star rating,"Honestly, everything about our first trip to ""The Cliff"" was wonderful. My girlfriend and I are avid brunchers and wanted to find a place local that allows dogs. Our waitress was lovely and attentive, and showed our puppy soo much love! We started off with the Avocado toast as an app and it was soo pretty we didn't want to touch it, aside from it being a slight over toasted (harder to cut into than we'd liked) the flavor was Amazing! We also ordered the brioche French toast and Egg white omelette, both were splendid! At first I thought the portions was a tad on the small end but also very hearty. The outdoor seating is very eloquent and welcoming, i love that they don't try to pile as many tables to where you're on top of each other. Now if I had to be picky I would say they should add goat cheese to the menu and have wine buckets since it's a BYOB. But all in all, this was a Lovely visit and we will be back on the regular.",The Cliff,4.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (Traditional),, Scandinavian"

The place was not packed was a surprise, at the same time, they just opened two months ago. Very cute interior and exterior. It was 5 of us and one baby. The service was slowww at first, and she seemed mad that my boyfriends mom asked for her hot coffee, but then she brightened up and was nice and quick from then on.

I'm happy I got to try out the french toast because it really has been the best I've ever tried. And they were out when I came in! Luckily, the owner(?) bought in fresh groceries. Coffee and refreshments were delicious. It was amazing to find a vegetarian place, but it had really limited options on the menu. Would definitely revisit if I was in the mood for just french toast.
