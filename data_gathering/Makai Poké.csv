Unlike other poke spots, your bowl price can be entirely reasonable depending upon how you build it (your bowl can easily come in under $13, unlike Shaka's set price of $14). I come here more than Shaka not for the price alone but the fact that they have salmon!Makai also offers outdoor seating for warmer weather.",Makai Poké,4.0 star rating,$$,"Hawaiian,, Poke,, Acai, Bowls"

Bonus are the options to have salad or zoodles instead of rice. Who needs all those carbs, anyway?

6,-VWxa75N4DtpXua6OAwg5Q,Pierson T.,3.0 star rating,"Tonight is the first time I've come in a while (probably 2 months?) and a lot has changed. Previously, I would have given this place 4-5 stars. However, tonight's experience has unfortunately changed my opinion. To start, while they've added many new options on the menu, including poke pizza and acai bowls, my review will be solely on the poke bowl. I always get a regular bowl (2 proteins) with white rice. First off, the sushi rice was warm, which is good, but also very mushy and soggy, which isn't good. When selecting proteins, the salmon and tuna chunks are so tiny, and the scoop is so small, that you feel like you're barely getting any proteins. They used to be more generous with how much they give you, but this time my bowl was pretty much all rice. Even after adding sauce and toppings, it still wasn't enough to cover all of the rice. I understand that portion control is difficult to perfect, but if I'm paying over $11 for a poke bowl, I gotta feel like I'm getting enough fish. Lastly, the workers are nice, but I felt like they weren't attentive enough. I was the only person in line and there was another customer being helped at the cashier. Two other workers were also there, but doing other things. In my mind, they should've dropped what they were doing to assist in taking my order, at least until the worker was done ringing the other customer out. Unfortunately I was left standing there for quite a while waiting to order. It doesn't make sense to have three workers in the area, and two customers, but leave one customer waiting. The process could have been streamlined much better. Overall, the actual food tasted pretty much the same as before, but I didn't leave feeling satisfied, as I had leftover white rice and not enough fish. It's enough to make me feel like not coming back again.  I may give this place another chance, as they do have new menu items.",Makai Poké,4.0 star rating,$$,"Hawaiian,, Poke,, Acai, Bowls"

I loved the set up of the restaurant and its in a popular part of Hoboken. There's seating inside and outside of the restaurant. Because it's in Hoboken, metered street parking was very challenging.

I've never seen one of those before so had to come here and try it out. After reading the reviews, I definitely was expecting the prices to be a bit steeper than other places. In total, my meal came out to about $18 with the pineapple poke bowl (2 protein) and a drink. I've only had a poke bowl once before in the city, so I'm still fairly new to the concept. The staff was more than helpful and really patient. I got the salmon and shrimp on the white rice, only got seaweed, cucumbers, and masago as toppings (misread the menu and thought that the other toppings were extra charge, whoops! My mistake), and sesame seeds, spicy mayo, a chili sauce, and garlic to top it all off. Originally I only asked for the spicy mayo but the person who helped me suggested the chili and garlic since they went well with the shrimp. He let me try the sauce first to make sure I liked it. It was delicious, so glad he helped me out there! I went to sit outside and I can't even tell you how many people stopped to check out the pineapple bowl I was having! Definitely an intriguing look to your typical poke bowl. It tasted even better than it looked to be honest. The salmon and shrimp were fresh, all toppings and sauces blended nicely, definitely worth the hype in my opinion. The prices are definitely higher than other places, but don't let that stop you.

What a welcome addition to the neighborhood.In addition to Honeygrow, Makai Poké has become a regular healthy lunch spot for me.The first time, I have to admit, they put WAY too much dressing on my bowl, but this was when they first opened and I think things were just crazy.I gave it a second try yesterday, and I'm so glad I did! I asked for sauce on the side of course :) I love that you can build your own bowl, and the ingredients are so healthy and fresh. It was pretty filling too. My go-to's are the spicy salmon/tuna and regular ahi tuna or salmon. Best to mix and match so that it's not TOO spicy! For $11-12 for your meal, you get a good amount of food, and you can tell that it's great quality.They unfortunately don't have chicken, so if you don't like fish, this may not be for you, but they do have tofu if you're looking for vegetarian options.

However I finally found another place where I can get a bowl or sushi burrito and not worry about breaking out in hives. So there are numerous options here at Makai: 1. Poke bowl, 2. Açaí bowl, 3. Sushi burrito, 4. Sushi pizza, 5. Hot dogs I'm pretty sure they will create even more as time passes. My review is based on the bowl, burrito and hot dog. So the bowl and burrito has three sizes and there's not size difference but there is a protein difference small gives you one, a regular let's you choose 2 and large gives you 3. Proteins offered are fish, kani crab, shrimp, octopus, etc. so you have an array of choices. And the toppings are endless and you can chose as many as you want including crunchy toppings at the end too. As well as a choice on sauce I usually pick the makai which is a mix of sweet and spicy but I tend to get extra spicy mayo for more kick. The base for the bowl you get a choice of brown or white rice or salad. Overall great flavors!! I've been back a few times already.",Makai Poké,4.0 star rating,$$,"Hawaiian,, Poke,, Acai, Bowls"

Don't get me wrong it's not bad but I felt the ingredients were skimpy, not enough variety and the rice wasn't cooked properly. I noticed that the server didn't give me a lot of Salmon to begin with so I asked for an extra scoop.. He told me he'd have to charge me, which is totally okay but the extra scoop he gave me consisted of two small salmon cubes. I looked at the guy and thought, ""really?"" But didn't want to make a fuss. He charged me extra for that generous scoop. Poké is my absolute favorite dish so when I find a place I get super excited. Not gonna lie, as soon as I took a look at my bowl my smile went down. I want to add, after looking at some of the pictures other costumers took of their bowls I'm shocked because my bowl looked nothing like that! My bowl looked pretty sad so maybe I just had bad luck?

My go-to's are the spicy salmon/tuna and regular ahi tuna or salmon. Best to mix and match so that it's not TOO spicy! For $11-12 for your meal, you get a good amount of food, and you can tell that it's great quality.They unfortunately don't have chicken, so if you don't like fish, this may not be for you, but they do have tofu if you're looking for vegetarian options. They also do take-out if you're in a rush. Overall, I would highly recommend you try this place. It probably won't be your last time.",Makai Poké,4.0 star rating,$$,"Hawaiian,, Poke,, Acai, Bowls"

I asked them to put every other topping on my bowl and topped it with avocado, spicy mayo, sweet midnight, rice puffs and shredded seaweed... you think I'm crazy? I WAS IN HEAVEN!

However I finally found another place where I can get a bowl or sushi burrito and not worry about breaking out in hives. So there are numerous options here at Makai: 1. Poke bowl, 2. Açaí bowl, 3. Sushi burrito, 4. Sushi pizza, 5. Hot dogs I'm pretty sure they will create even more as time passes. My review is based on the bowl, burrito and hot dog. So the bowl and burrito has three sizes and there's not size difference but there is a protein difference small gives you one, a regular let's you choose 2 and large gives you 3. Proteins offered are fish, kani crab, shrimp, octopus, etc. so you have an array of choices. And the toppings are endless and you can chose as many as you want including crunchy toppings at the end too. As well as a choice on sauce I usually pick the makai which is a mix of sweet and spicy but I tend to get extra spicy mayo for more kick. The base for the bowl you get a choice of brown or white rice or salad. Overall great flavors!! I've been back a few times already.",Makai Poké,4.0 star rating,$$,"Hawaiian,, Poke,, Acai, Bowls"

Don't get me wrong it's not bad but I felt the ingredients were skimpy, not enough variety and the rice wasn't cooked properly. I noticed that the server didn't give me a lot of Salmon to begin with so I asked for an extra scoop.. He told me he'd have to charge me, which is totally okay but the extra scoop he gave me consisted of two small salmon cubes. I looked at the guy and thought, ""really?"" But didn't want to make a fuss. He charged me extra for that generous scoop. Poké is my absolute favorite dish so when I find a place I get super excited. Not gonna lie, as soon as I took a look at my bowl my smile went down. I want to add, after looking at some of the pictures other costumers took of their bowls I'm shocked because my bowl looked nothing like that! My bowl looked pretty sad so maybe I just had bad luck?

I'm a bit of a rookie ordering Poke bowls, so Makai employee Meghan walked me through patiently and nicely, offering samples along the way.  By the time we were through, I had assembled a delicious Poke bowl to go that included a white rice base, sushi style fresh salmon and marinated tuna, seaweed salad, cucumber, corn, mango, a scoop of guacamole, sesame seeds and a zesty soy dressing. All of the ingredients tasted fresh and the flavors worked surprisingly well together.  You have to be careful with the pricing, as you can spend anywhere between $11-20 for your bowl. Mine came out to about $16 dollars tax included, so make sure you ask what's included and what is extra.  Makai will probably get a lot of take out and delivery orders, but they've also noticeably done a great job squeezing in many small tables NYC style for those that choose to dine in.  Hoboken has a growing selection of diverse cuisine and Makai is another solid addition to the city's casual dining.",Makai Poké,4.0 star rating,$$,"Hawaiian,, Poke,, Acai, Bowls"

48,lqGVi770JuPd-G0lZzhVyA,Anderson F.,3.0 star rating,"Okay - food alone will probably reach two stars. Just doesn't match up to more than 50% of the other poke places I have been to. We were a party of 2 and ordered a bowl and a poke pizza slice. I just had to try the pizza slice to see what the fb hype was all about. I have two critiques I would share here. The first on the food is the ratio of the protein to the carbs. Way too much rice for both items. When the rice is so much more than the protein, the dish appears to be sad and and the establishment appears to be stingy, may it or not be the case that the establishment is stingy. The second critique is that the restaurant had run out of certain kani and their specialty makai sauce by 6pm when the closing time listed is 930pm. These are two relatively easy opportunities for improvements.The Pizza Slice Poke Experience - I went in with a really low expectation and was ready to dog it. But when I actually tried it, it wasn't bad. It also wasn't great because there was too much rice, which is mentioned above. I was given the option of adding a crunchy item and seaweed salad on top of the protein, and the crunchy topping gave me a slight sensation that i was chewing on some cripsy bread which I found incredible. I tried giving it the brooklyn fold so the toppings wouldn't fall out, and that just turned it into an ugly handroll. Luckily for me, i like all handrolls!Where 2stars went to 3stars.On the service side - we were received with a great welcome by all the staff who where there that night. I appreciate their enthusiasm of seeing me there, even if it's a bit overwhelming. I appreciate them taking the time to explain the menu and give a quick how-to order your food session. They showed me great patience each time we were at a decision diamond. Service was amicable enough to earn another star in this review. During checkout, there was a sign indicating a 10% discount for students. I showed my CUNY student ID, but was denied the discount as the cashier reasoned that the discount was for Stevens students only.

They had choices of raw ahi tuna or raw salmon (regular or marinated), crab salad and tiny shrimp, but no other seafood or proteins!  Where's the octopus, where's the tofu, where's the yellowtail?  Also kind of weird they are no land animal proteins (pork, chicken), but I understand the land animals aren't very traditional in the poke world.   I thought they had a fairly good amount of veggies to put in the bowl but with one exception -- why in the world don't they have avocado?!?  [I would also suggest they get some julienned carrots and cilantro]  I was also a little surprised to see they charged for a nori topping ($1).  They had a pretty good fridge selection of drinks, but I wish they had a water station.  I love the rice they use at Makai, but I am not so keen on the tiny scoops of protein they put into the bowl.  I was barely satisfied after eating the large bowl (3 proteins), I could only imagine how hungry I still would have been if I ordered a regular (2 proteins).  Staff was friendly and helpful, however.  I liked how they gave out samples of the ""daily fish specials"" and of the different sauces.   I hope they get some outdoor seating, because eating poke outside is just summer goals.And that ""you had me at aloha"" sign is just perfect too.",Makai Poké,4.0 star rating,$$,"Hawaiian,, Poke,, Acai, Bowls"

I had two proteins, zucchini noodles, and avocado.  That's it.The spicy kani is what saved this bowl.  The zucchini noodles were fresh and really nice as a healthy option. The avocado....oh man.  Super unripe, and there were literally only three small slices (slices, not 1/8ths).  The tuna was TOUGH and hard to chew. I don't want to feel like I'm ripping my food apart =(Also the shoyu was basically just soy sauce, which made the very small portion of tuna really salty.Overall, kind of disappointing for the price (stop cheaping out on portions for more expensive ingredients!!

Delivery was fast, but the tuna in both bowls was not fresh at all - to the point that I had to throw it out and get an alternative dinner.  I don't know what the process is for making sure the tuna you serve is edible, but it wasn't practiced for my bowls. I should note that the rice and salmon in the second bowl was fine. So maybe just a one off bad batch of tuna? Hope no one else got sick. The other reviews here seem positive, so maybe I just need to give it another chance. But my first experience was a major turn off. Hope they up their quality control. Will update this review after my next go at it. I REALLY want to find my Hoboken fix for a pokebowl. Otherwise it's a long-ish trek to JC.Update: Walked in to give it another chance on a Monday, and the fish quality was good.

I opted to make my own custom bowl since I've had poke before.I ordered a regular white rice bowl with spicy tuna and Hawaiian shoyu-marinated tuna with a variety of toppings and finished with their Hawaiian shoyu sauce. I have to say that although it was a touch salty for me, it was delicious and so filling! The reason why I'm still giving it 5 stars is because even though the custom bowl I made for myself wasn't perfect, I know exactly what to do next time I go in order to make it perfect for me! Personally, I recommend using the Hawaiian shoyu sauce only if you get regular unseasoned protein; it was a bit too much with my protein selection.Overall, I would recommend the place.

This place RULES!My first time here, they walk you through the whole process (your bowl is designed Chipotle style). Me personally, the home made marinade tuna & salmon are excellent (they let you sample almost anything).The fish is fresh as fresh could be (may as well have plucked it right out of the ocean). No fish smell whatsoever.The only thing that was a problem (and this may be because they're so new) they seemed to be short on multiple ingredients.But this is a very VERY tasty experience.

They took the time to walk me through options and offered suggestions as well. I got the build your own with 3 proteins, spice tuna, ahi tuna and a tuna special....I like tuna. They had a great variety of choices for toppings and the pickled vegetables and seaweed salad were delicious. I topped it off wit ha miso ginger sauce and sesame seeds and took it to go. I got home and cracked it open and it was amazing. The fish was so fresh and all the vegetables went well with my selections.

144,I1xAWvhV051AXitfjNiIEg,Katie C.,3.0 star rating,Stars are for portion only. Taste and options are 5 stars. The portions depend on which worker you get but I received way less tuna in my regular size bowl than the person next to me getting a snack size bowl. They don't skimp on the grains but after 3 bites all the fish and toppings are gone and you are left with a family size portion of grains - Shaka bowl def recommended over here if you are looking for proportionate distribution of base and protein.,Makai Poké,4.0 star rating,$$,"Hawaiian,, Poke,, Acai, Bowls"

The staff was super welcoming when I walked in the door and answered all of my Poke questions. I got a regular Poke bowl with white rice, one scoop of ahi tuna, and one scoop of salmon. The fish was really fresh and the rice was cooked perfectly. There were so many toppings to choose from and all the sauces looked amazing. I had the classic shoyu sauce and the siracha mayo, so delicious. So happy I came to try this place! Will be back soon for sure!",Makai Poké,4.0 star rating,$$,"Hawaiian,, Poke,, Acai, Bowls"

However, as an avid sushi lover I feel like I can judge some raw fish based product. That being said, this place is fantastic. I'm having more trouble trying to stop myself from going every other day. Fish tastes fresh and I love building out a bunch of different combinations each time I go. I've really only had the burrito but won't switch, too good. Highly recommend!",Makai Poké,4.0 star rating,$$,"Hawaiian,, Poke,, Acai, Bowls"
151,3JWQUx_ulUFbWWsPAFY6hw,Morgan V.,5.0 star rating,"While the poke is delicious, the five stars is largely attributed to the service I received here. I was a little overwhelmed by all of the options when I first walked in but the woman who helped me was willing to explain all items to me and was extremely patient with my indecisiveness. She also created one of the most beautiful bowls I have ever seen. I believe her name was Meghan (distinguish by cool tattoos on her arms) and she is the main reason I'll be returning!",Makai Poké,4.0 star rating,$$,"Hawaiian,, Poke,, Acai, Bowls"

154,PF1lVdQK2Ot_gxxq2SMMAA,Max M.,5.0 star rating,"I've never sought out Hawaiian food before, but this place just opened today. I had to check it out, and I was glad I did. It's like fusion cuisine, with Japanese and Californian, and other inspirations (as far as I can tell). I had a bowl of tuna and salmon, with a heaping helping of a bunch of different toppings. It's bowls made to order, give me some of this, some of that, I love it cause there's so much familiar food there prepared in ways I've never seen before, so it's good to go. I brought a friend with me, didn't even occur to me he didn't eat seafood, but they were able to accommodate him with pulled pork and chicken.  There was even a soy option for vegetarians (and vegans I imagine).  They have imported sofas from Japan and Hawaii.  They didn't look appealing to me, not really my thing (I'm not the most adventurous drinker), but my friend got one and when I actually tried a sip of his white cream soda, it wasn't bad.  Sweet, inoffensive.  Anyway, I really enjoyed the food, and I'm glad a place like this opened up in Hoboken. It's not something I've seen anywhere in the area, so it's good to have something really different and really good as an option.",Makai Poké,4.0 star rating,$$,"Hawaiian,, Poke,, Acai, Bowls"

The fish is soooo fresh and they are transparent about where their seafood is (locally) sourced from. Also, this is the first poke place I've been to outside of Hawai'i where the sticky white rice is cooked properly. Mahalo for operating as sustainably as possible. Will definitely be a regular here!",Makai Poké,4.0 star rating,$$,"Hawaiian,, Poke,, Acai, Bowls"
