0,CTSH1ESIGEL9uPmspTmItw,Cheryl N.,5.0 star rating,"I had an amazing dining experience here on a Saturday Night earlier this month. I have been to Fig & Olive before, but never to this location.  We arrived around 6:15 p.m. and I thought I had made a reservation on Open Table. I accidentally had made it for the following Saturday, but before I could ask for to put our names in the manager said that was ok and they still had a table for us since it wasn't that busy yet and sat us right away! Woot!My friend and I were at a corner booth table in the main dining room which boasts a gorgeous wine display behind the bar. Our drinks came out right away. Their specialty cocktails are the same price as well drinks $14 and up, so you may as well get a specialty cocktail if you are into spirits as we learned when we got a G & T for our first round (which had plenty of alcohol in it).The bread with the 3 olive oils came out next from different regions. The first was from Greece, another from Spain. I can't remember where the last one was from, but they all were different and amazing. Their flavors ranged in complexity, and was fun to dip our bread and taste the different olive oils.Their crostinis are amazing. I love the Manchego with fig and marcona almond. We also had the Proscuitto, ricotta, fig, loive, and walnut and the Kabocha Squash with pickled mushroom, and pear. I am drooling just thinking about them! We ordered 6 and just got two of the same thing so we could each try, but you can also order 3 or 6 different ones and then cut them in half.Our server Abigail was fantastic, she was always there when we needed her. Our main courses took forever to come, we didn't complain at all, we just started to wonder since the place was now packed and we wanted to get into The Whitney Museum before it closed. Abigail came over and also notice we didn't have our food and said she had already talked to her manager and apologized and the next round of drinks was on the house! Again, we did not even make a peep, Abigail was proactive, and we really appreciated that about her and it says a lot for the restaurant as well. The second round of cocktails included the Rosellini and the Summer en Provence. Both amazing drinks which I highly recommend.Our main courses were the Bouillabaisse with grilled scallop, Chilean sea bass, mussels, lobster bisque, shaved fennel, and saffron garlic aioli. My friend had this. Make sure you have your camera set to video when it comes out as they pour the lobster bisque into your bowl. I got the Grass Fed Filet Mignon, which I have never had hear. They cooked it perfectly and it boasted five start flavors! Who would have though a Mediterranean Place would do Filet Mignon so well. I enjoyed the haricot vert, mashed potato, olive oil béarnaise that it came with.There was also a DJ at the bar area which was fun! Love this location. I can't wait to come back. Thank you to the peeps at F & O for cultivating such a great dining experience.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

We came in for a brunch pusld deal, and it wasn't a really good deal but the space and the food were nice enough that it was fine. There is a limited menu from which you chose from, and that of course is always a bit annoying, but I get it... Our appetizers were delicious. I ordered the cheese and mushroom croquettes and loved it! Hubby got the carrot soup and the service and presentation of it were quite pretty!! It's a soup-experience. And it was delicious! Annoyingly though, you don't get a bread basket, you have to pay for it because it comes with other baked goods. How about a simple bread basket?... Entree wise, hubby got the best thing! Salmon Benedict toast with a salad. His salmon was delicious, thick cut and abundant. Should have gotten that... I got the lame omelet, and really, I should have known better... the potatoes were NOT fries, the omelet didn't taste like goat cheese, it felt very under -seasoned and underwhelming. Boohoo :( Desert we got the chocolate cream and the crostinis. All good. I like the dinner menu better, but I think that's because we were very limited with our pulsd deal.

The restaurant was about half full, and we got our appetizers shortly after we ordered them (we had ordered the calamari and mushroom croquette). Then we started waiting for our entree. And waiting. And waiting. My boyfriend had ordered the Chilean sea bass while I had already decided way before arriving that I would get the tajine. Unfortunately, when we finally got the food (a good 45 minutes after our appetizers), the tajine was rather disappointing - it was more or less a deconstructed version of the Moroccan dish I had been so excited for. The sea bass was good, but not worth the long wait.Dessert was fine and arrived quite quickly, but overall I had expected more from this hyped restaurant.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

The inside is super gorgeous though and everyone who worked there was bright and welcoming. I got a blackberry drink which was really good but my only complaint was there was large chunks of blackberry that made it impossible to drink through the straw and even messier to sip. It definitely needed to be strained. For food - do yourself a favor and get the mushroom croquettes. THEY ARE AMAZING! We also got 6 crostini - octopus, shrimp, Gorgonzola, and manchego. The octopus/hummus pairing was kinda weird, wasn't a huge fan. The shrimp was good. The Gorgonzola was amazing. The manchego was good. For an entree we split the poached eggs and prosciutto and it was fairly good.

Meeting a friend for some drinks, bringing a special date, or taking your Aunt for a birthday dinner (hint: that last one may have been why I came!).If your going for cocktails - the Rosselini is a great option!Appetizer: We went with the 6 Crostini. They can easily be cut in half for trying different kinds. Cutting into thirds is a bit too small. Highly recommend the goat cheese and the prosciutto.Salad: We both had the Fig and Olive salad. The cheese, fig, olive, and apple....yummmm.. such a good combination. Entrees:The hanger steak. Let me repeat - the hanger steak.  I will be comparing every steak I eat, from now on, to the hanger steak I had that night.  It had a smokey taste that was melt in your mouth perfection. The potatoes and rapini (broccoli raab) had perfect flavor and it was all perfection. My Aunt had the sea bass. I'll be honest... she seemed pretty excited but I missed every detail of what she said and declined her offer to try it. I was lost in my hanger steak.Dessert:The perfect ending to the perfect meal.

14,6tnSJdu3lNPrsiF6BcxhRw,Lorelei Y.,3.0 star rating,"Came in for restaurant week last week, and ordered one meal off the RW menu and one off the regular menu. From the RW menu: -Burrata: the cheese was delicious (I mean, I love cheese, so obviously), but the tomatoes were pretty underripe, which meant that they weren't very flavorful-Risotto with chicken: decent, but a little disappointing. I've had much creamier risottos in my day, and this one felt like it had been under-stirred while cooking-Pot de créme: unequivocally deliciousFrom the regular menu: -Scallops: delicious and perfectly seared-Branzino: fish itself was delicious, but the sauce it was served with was a little weird-tasting for my personal preferenceWe ordered drinks, as well: a Stella for him and the Grenache rosé for me. A service hiccup occurred when we got our drinks, as I ended up getting a glass of red instead of rosé initially. This was easily resolved, and I got my rosé in the end.TLDR: probably don't come in for the RW menu, but ordering off the regular menu is probably a decent bet.Service-wise, we had a lackluster experience getting seated here. We had an 8pm reservation, and didn't end up seated until something like 8:30pm, despite the restaurant having open tables (four-tops, and we were a group of two, but still, if you have people waiting forever to be seated, I'd think it would be preferable to seat them at a four-top than to have them waiting for half an hour).",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

17,yyU9MewXfNq4F1r5VkO0FA,Paul V.,2.0 star rating,"With Fig & Olive being as popular as it is in Los Angeles, I had high expectations for their NYC location. Unfortunately, those expectations fell a wee bit short on account of what was some rather mediocre and unimaginative food. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?One thing that Fig & Olive does exceptionally well in this NYC location is deliver a top notch atmosphere that's complimented by good service. There's so much real estate here that the place was half empty even on a beautiful Saturday morning, and the diversity of seating can accomodate virtually any party. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?The prices are reasonable at Fig & Olive, and I was surprised to see that my Penne Funghi pasta dish was only $21.00. That's some serious value all things considered. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?So it's here that things more or less fell apart. After noting that my Penne Funghi dish had 'truffle' in the description, I became concerned that, like pretty much all other 'truffle' related dishes these days, that Fig & Olive wouldn't fall into the trap of overdoing it. I almost made a point to tell the waiter to take it easy on the truffle oil, and immediately regretted not doing so the second I got a whiff of my dish. The components for a good pasta dish were all here: well cooked pasta, diced mushrooms, and shards of cheese; but sure enough, the entire dish was absolutely drenched in truffle oil to the point of being near inedible. I finished about half of the dish before giving up. No Stars Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?I can chalk this one up to bad ordering on my part, but even setting aside my botched dish, none of my friends seemed overly impressed with their lunches, and there are thus simply too many amazing options in the immediate vicinity to recommend Fig & Olive's meatpacking spot.

34,6tnSJdu3lNPrsiF6BcxhRw,Lorelei Y.,3.0 star rating,"Came in for restaurant week last week, and ordered one meal off the RW menu and one off the regular menu. From the RW menu: -Burrata: the cheese was delicious (I mean, I love cheese, so obviously), but the tomatoes were pretty underripe, which meant that they weren't very flavorful-Risotto with chicken: decent, but a little disappointing. I've had much creamier risottos in my day, and this one felt like it had been under-stirred while cooking-Pot de créme: unequivocally deliciousFrom the regular menu: -Scallops: delicious and perfectly seared-Branzino: fish itself was delicious, but the sauce it was served with was a little weird-tasting for my personal preferenceWe ordered drinks, as well: a Stella for him and the Grenache rosé for me. A service hiccup occurred when we got our drinks, as I ended up getting a glass of red instead of rosé initially. This was easily resolved, and I got my rosé in the end.TLDR: probably don't come in for the RW menu, but ordering off the regular menu is probably a decent bet.Service-wise, we had a lackluster experience getting seated here. We had an 8pm reservation, and didn't end up seated until something like 8:30pm, despite the restaurant having open tables (four-tops, and we were a group of two, but still, if you have people waiting forever to be seated, I'd think it would be preferable to seat them at a four-top than to have them waiting for half an hour).",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

37,yyU9MewXfNq4F1r5VkO0FA,Paul V.,2.0 star rating,"With Fig & Olive being as popular as it is in Los Angeles, I had high expectations for their NYC location. Unfortunately, those expectations fell a wee bit short on account of what was some rather mediocre and unimaginative food. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?One thing that Fig & Olive does exceptionally well in this NYC location is deliver a top notch atmosphere that's complimented by good service. There's so much real estate here that the place was half empty even on a beautiful Saturday morning, and the diversity of seating can accomodate virtually any party. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?The prices are reasonable at Fig & Olive, and I was surprised to see that my Penne Funghi pasta dish was only $21.00. That's some serious value all things considered. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?So it's here that things more or less fell apart. After noting that my Penne Funghi dish had 'truffle' in the description, I became concerned that, like pretty much all other 'truffle' related dishes these days, that Fig & Olive wouldn't fall into the trap of overdoing it. I almost made a point to tell the waiter to take it easy on the truffle oil, and immediately regretted not doing so the second I got a whiff of my dish. The components for a good pasta dish were all here: well cooked pasta, diced mushrooms, and shards of cheese; but sure enough, the entire dish was absolutely drenched in truffle oil to the point of being near inedible. I finished about half of the dish before giving up. No Stars Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?I can chalk this one up to bad ordering on my part, but even setting aside my botched dish, none of my friends seemed overly impressed with their lunches, and there are thus simply too many amazing options in the immediate vicinity to recommend Fig & Olive's meatpacking spot.

We actually had reservations at another restaurant and they messed up our reservation so I panicked... But quickly went on open table.com and saw that fig and Olive had an opening in an hour... It was a Saturday night and no other restaurants had availability until after 10:30 PM, but since I have eaten at fig and Olive uptown before and was pleased, I was very happy to make the last minute reservation there instead.As I always do, I called the restaurant after making the reservation online just to confirm that they got the reservation... I told her of my situation it being last minute, and having eight people... The reservation was in an hour and I asked if there was anyway we could sit before since we were already in the area. The manager was absolutely wonderful, told us to come in right away and she would do the best that she could to sit us as soon as possible. When we got to the restaurant, the table is ready for us and the woman was apologizing for the other restaurant, and told us that she would make sure our experience at the restaurant would be great. I don't know the name of our waiter, but he was wonderful. We had a large party and he exceeded all expectations as well. He was very attentive, we had to picky eaters in our party and he suggested wonderful things for them. He chose my drinks for me, & they were both delicious. I'm a big Moscow mule fan & the""Mediterranean Mule"" was delicious. The waiter then suggested I try the ""Provence Margarita"" and it was equally as delicious. For dinner, we got two cheese plates to share & the beet & burrata, as well as the mushroom croquette. All were delicious. The cheese plate came with fig & olive spread & they were to die for as well. For my meal I got the Provence roasted Amish chicken. It was on the bone, but wasn't the least bit dry, it was fantastic. I can't tell you how much Fig + Olive saves the day on what could have been a potentially disastrous experience for my bride friend.

This review is from a brunch on a Saturday.Ambiance: high ceiling and big dining rooms (multiple) with live jazz music. The interior is quite nice with modern and fig and olive branch like decorations. The bar area is also big and could easily dine on the bar. However due  to the big rooms is is REALLY  only a group-friendly restaurant, the noise level is 11 out of 10 and with the live music, sorry to say but it made it worse. Music itself was fantastic but the volume with the dishes, people and the saxophone really made it impossible to hear anyone at my table. Food: Average at its best. If you are a foodie and want high quality and/or indulging type of brunch, you will be disappointed. We ordered:- truffle croquette (the only good thing from our table)- omelette (comes with a salad so boring and too ""healthy"")- quiche with salad, again so boring- hamburger, fries were good but the meat was burnt, and not juicy at all- salmon eggs Benedict, so average kind of painful- 3 type of crostini, all just ok - artichoke salad, extremely acidic inedible I ordered TWO sides of skinny fries to cheer myself up and ended up with a stomach ache.Cocktails were ok, Bloody Mary is super spicy.We ordered the chocolate fondant dessert, only time in my life I left dessert unfinished.When asked for mayo was told they don't have Mayo and that their chefs don't believe in it... umm how is one supposed to eat fries?

My chicken was cooked maybe a little too well. Her beef was a little too well done. Massive portion sizes, err on the side of one less dish/side you won't need it. We almost took half of it home.

Alex suggested that I try the crostini and I am happy that I did because they were awesome. Gorgonzola, goat cheese, and manchego quickly became a favorite.

As for the food, we began with the crostini which were amazing. We had the mushroom, manchego and gorgonzola - each I highly recommend. As for the appetizers, we had the zucchini carpaccio and burrata. The burrata was very good, although heavy so definitely share with at LEAST one other. The zucchini dish unfortunately was by far the worst dish of the night and $14 for essentially sliced zucchini with olive oil was definitely not worth it. I would not suggest that dish. For main we had the truffle risotto which was delicious! I recommend sharing as it was quite heavy.

Wonderful response and now on to the food.After drinks (made impeccably), we shared the artichoke appetizer which was truly 5 stars. Very different than the one's we get in LA and well worth it. Next, two of us got the carrot soup and two got the squash and chestnut soup. Both very good and would have again.The entrees consisted of the F&O salad, the vegetable risotto, the Riviera salmon and the linguine with a salmon skewer.

Additionally, it's just an overwhelming amount of fried food so I would suggest sharing it with someone else. I felt really uncomfortable at the end of my meal. Nonetheless it is very very good. For my main entree I ordered my go to dish - paella del mar. It comes in a tiny pan which makes its presentation very nice. It's a generous portion size with lots of tasty Spanish rice, scallops, shrimp, calamari and mussels. Definitely recommend getting this dish. Once again I couldn't finish all of it so I ended up just eating all the seafood. Everyone loved this dish. Just squeeze a little lime on your mussels and you'll understand what I'm talking about.

Even though the deal stated 1 coupon per table, Fig and Olive was very accommodating and allowed us to use the 2 deals and sit together(++).  When you go to restaurants and not paying full price because you have a deal, sometimes you get treated subpar to those paying full price, but I can say this definitely was not the case at Fig and Olive  (++) we were treated extremely courteous, and the server was very attentive.

The Fig & Olive salad was nice, except we wished they had used different greens instead of romaine lettuce. Salmon entre was pretty good, but definitely have had better.

I think it's over priced and take out taste better. Skip any chicken dish. If you want chicken, go to wholefood and that might actually be 10 times better. My friend throw away most of her chicken dish. the paella is sad. According to my friend, their wine is a bit over priced and lack of good selection. I didn't really like it either.

Our food choices were picked in advance by one of the girls in my party who put this dinner together.

It tasted like a cheap cocktail you would get at a dive bar when you are twenty one. There was inexplicably pepper sprinkled on top. I sent it back and got a Malbec, which I thought would be a safe choice- and it was gross.It took our waiter forever to take our orders and it took me upwards of fifteen minutes to actually get the pear Blanche that I ordered. No apology. And when I sent it back, it was still on the bill- he did take it off once we reviewed with him that it was terrible. My food which was the fettuccine shrimp mascarpone was under seasoned, over cooked, and tasted like something you would buy at an airport Sbarro's. For $27. It also took awhile to get ahold of our waiter to try to get pepper or anything to doctor my incredibly bland and disappointing dish.After all this, I do think this place is just somewhere people come to for the scene- but if you actually want good food (and I can't stress enough good drinks- like I haven't had that bad a drink in ages)- look elsewhere in NYC.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

90,kDtP_DKT2yebOCsjSiGs_A,Anna K.,4.0 star rating,"Simply put, Fig & Olive is a staple in the Meatpacking District.I've been to Fig & Olive for dinner on a few occasions, and it has never disappointed. Upon walking in, the restaurant offers a large, open space, with an upscale-casual, almost ""clubby"" feel (they often have a DJ). While it is often noisy at night, if the ""trendy"" vibe is what you're looking for, it makes for a great experience.The menu changes seasonally, although there are staples which remain on the menu, year round. The options are rather extensive--however, there is a focus on Mediterranean ingredients (hence the name, ""Fig & Olive""). The restaurant claims to source their ingredients sustainably, when possible, as well.During my most recent experience at F&O, I ordered the Provence Roasted Chicken, which was beautiful, fresh, and delicious. It was accompanied by perfectly-roasted fingerling potatoes, ratatouille, and topped with beautiful basil leaves. I would definitely order this again! While the prices were on-par with what you would expect in NYC, the portions were rather generous.Fig & Olive now has several locations across the country--from LA to NYC to Chicago to Washington DC and more--so it is not exactly unique to the Meatpacking District. However, if I find myself in any of those cities, and want a reliable, fresh meal, I will definitely consider F&O.P.S. If you plan to dine at Fig & Olive on a holiday (i.e. New Year's Eve, etc.), be mindful of the fact that they change their menu for special occasions.

Avocado shrimp was the best.Hamachi crudo came with orange, which made it a bit sour, but the fish was very good. Mushroom croquette was served with just the right amount of truffle, but you could only eat a few as they're on the heavy side. Salmon was seared tenderly with a very crispy skin, and the duck came out very firm, which went well with the onion puree.

We immediately order some drinks and entree (all suggested by the waiter) and wait for the feast to begin. The drinks come out - 1 martini and a cocktail for me- I still am not sure of the name but I'm sure that the drink is good. Next the entree: it's a chicken stew with cous cous. It's shareable so I take a couple spoonfuls and am immediately transported to the kitchen of one of my college friends where her mother was cooking a chicken stew that tasted just like this... it was magical and I enjoyed every bite. The combination of spices, okra, carrots and something sweet like a fig filled my tastebuds. They also bring a tray of spices and sliced almonds to add to the couscous which is to DIE for.

Although it is on the pricier side, the sometimes have groupon deals that I definitely recommend hoarding like a squirrel prepping for winter. The groupon is pretty great. Three Crostinis an app or dessert and two entrees and two glasses of wine.The Crostinis are super fun and great. Each one is a good bite for two people so they are totally shareable. The mushroom one is super flavorful and earthy. You can't make these at home kids...it's hard to find mushrooms of this quality. The prosciutto one was also pretty good. Very good quality ham but the figs were a little too much and overshadowed a little. The Manchego cheese one was a little unbalanced in terms of sweet and salty but still good. The sea scallop app is awesome. The scallops were huge but overall a very nice app. The carrots were cooked to perfection and the carrot purée was insane. So light and smooth and flavorful. The pesto does have cilantro in it so becareful if you don't like it. The orange slices added just the right touch of sweetness.For my entree I had the lamb. It was cooked well and the portion sizes were great. The gnocchi was very tasty and the goat cheese didn't over power anything. The eggplant was a little greasy. Overall a heavier dish. It did make me crave a salad. I wish there was a sweet or spicy or fresh element to cut the heaviness. But this was not a big problem. My friend got the Bronzino. It was filets, which surprised me a little. The odd thing was that as a filet they skin wasn't fresh....but she said it was flavorful and she liked it. She's quite picky so I trust her.For dessert they threw in the sampler cause it was my birthday. They hazelnut bar was to die for. The texture and flavor were super rich. The chocolate pudding was very cute and light. The sorbet provided a nice bright burst of acid amongst the sweetness. The sorbet was also very flavorful in terms of fruitiness. Finally the cookie bar was interesting but I think they texture of the shortbread could have been improved with a touch of egg or milk in the dough. The pairing of it with micro greens was very creative and lovely....although gave it a slight savory spin. However with the pudding and Nutella bar as the backdrop, this created a fun balance.Now the service....ugh. When I go to restaurants it's much more important that the food is good so all of my stars are based on food. The server was confused for sure and slow. We waited a long time for everything. Luckily my friend and I really like each other so we didn't really notice. What cracked me up was that he took my groupon at the beginning. Then at the end, he came to ask me for it, charged me for it again...and then asked me for it again.....but then he found it crumpled in his apron. Not the brightest crayon in the box. The silver lining is that his slowness did allow us to really taste the food slowly, savoring every bite. This place will never get a Michelin star because of service. However, the food is much better than some of the other Michelin star NYC restaurants....like gramercy tavern etc. I will definitely be hoarding the groupons next time they are available!",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

113,shm4nlWoiu20P9-4z_tZdQ,Anastasia I.,3.0 star rating,"IT IS A SUNDAY BRUNCH REVIEW:Food- just OK.. Mushroom truffle croquette: wonderful, full of flavor, highlight of the meal. If u go to this place - order this dish.Steak and Eggs- mediocre- steak cooked to the desired temperature but - it is very tough cut of meat, very stringy, potatoes -overly-dry, inedible, chimichuri sauce is on point.Poached Eggs with Salmon: let's put it this way - salad was the best thing about it. Huge dry ""crostino"", 3 tiny pieces of salmon, claimed-to-be ""horseradish cream"" was anything but horseradish, zero flavor. Eggs cooked well. Salad dressing was perfect. Bottom line: I would not order this dish again or recommend it to anyone.Dessert: cherry and cream on olive oil ""cookies"": delicate, not overly sweet, tasty over-all, something to recommend/ or order again - maybe not.DRINKS: Very Bad!!!! Bloody Mary - more like red-colored vodka with Tabasco and stick of celery. Absolutely the worst Bloody Mary I have had in New York City. Period. Where is the flavor???(horseradish, pepper, salt, Worcestershire sauce, or even tomato juice?) - that has to be there, not just vodka and Tabasco! Service: alright. But very slow, but forgivable (well, it's a busy brunch; though, it should not be a half-hour wait for steak cooked ""Rare"")Ambiance & Decor: beautiful room, modern, noise level is ""energetic"", live jazz during Sunday brunch is a plus!

It was such short notice but we were glad that they were able to accommodate us. Our server was very friendly and professional.. Just so happens that Fig & Olive was part of restaurant week. For $42, you chose an appetizer, dinner entree, and dessert. Appetizer: I had the octopus salad with the potatoes. It was delicious and savory. I loved the sauce that came with it. I would dip the potatoes in it with every bite. Great way to start off. My boyfriend had the fig & olive salad which came out in a bowl, but with a good portion. Someone else had ordered the watermelon salad. I took a bite of it and it was DEE-LICIOUS. Perfect summer salad, it had a chunk of cheese that may or may not have been mozzarella. Regardless, I wish I had that salad as well.. Entree: the paella del mar dish was very fulfilling. Scallops, mussels, shrimp, rice and calamari. I could not finish this!! But I thought it was an amazing dish. However, most of the family had ordered the F&O Tajine and they did not like it. It was almost a struggle for them to finish it and the cous cous was too dry for their liking. Someone else had the Mediterranean Branzino and he said it was OK/Good.Dessert: they only had 2 options. I had chosen strawberry vacherin (strawberry sorbet, whipped cream, with strawberry marmalade on the bottom) I was very pleased with this dessert. The other option was the pot de crème which came in a small cup and a piece of crunchy hazelnut chocolate on the side. At first you would think this was a beverage, but once you dip your spoon, you'll be surprised that it's chocolate heaven in a cup! I can't even describe it to you but I loved every bite of it. Overall, it was a good experience and the ambience was great. I came here once years ago and this place hasn't changed.

116,IIMCc0rTUA4rMdXZ1M3zrQ,Ashley H.,2.0 star rating,"I wanted to love this place. Food is mediocre at best and service is so so. I came with a group of 11 people. We made a reservation (I believe a restaurant should only let customers wait a maximum of about 10 mins for a table since after all, they are expecting us). We waited over 30 minutes for a table which is a very long time considering that we had a reservation. We took advantage of the $29 restaurant week deal which consists of an appetizer, main course and dessert. I ordered Mushroom croquettes: Very crispy croquettes. The sauce turned me off though. Tastes like plain mayonnaise. I didn't go to a restaurant to have plain mayonnaise. Rating: 6/10 Vegetable linguine: Imagine making linguine then adding sauce to it, mixing it then letting it sit for a couple of hours. Yep that's what it tastes like. The sauce was incredibly dry. Flavor was nothing special. I only had a few bites of this. I couldn't take it anymore. Rating: 1/10 Chocolate pot de creme: It's a cup with cream on top and chocolate on the bottom. The cream was great but the chocolate was nothing special. I found the chocolate too sweet. The little chocolate biscuit was too sweet as well. Rating: 4/10Service could be better. I had to ask twice for my linguine to get packed to go (gave it to my friend, fortunately he liked it). Water wasn't refilled enough. Restaurant wasn't as fancy as I expected. Some customers wore tee shirts and shorts. When we called the restaurant we were told to dress semi formal. The way others dressed was more casual than anything else.

The major problem was with my main course.  I ordered the lamb dish medium rare.  The lamb came out on the rare to raw side but even worse was that they burned the rosemary garnish and the burnt taste permeated not only thru the air but also into my lamb and the gnocchi and vegetable side.  They did quickly replace it with a new dish but surprisingly made no accommodation on the bill or any other offer such as a drink or dessert.    A couple of friends ordered the bouillabaisse and the portion seemed quite skimpy.  The paella was said to be excellent as was the bronzini for two.  We passed on dessert opting to take a walk on the High Line and get something there.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

The seating was a bit tight, other than that the restaurant was intimate. The setting felt quite romantic, from the dim lighting, plants on the wall, the tall shelves of wine, to the olive oil bottles by the kithen.We kicked it off with drinks, their Red Sangria is a must, sweetened with blackberries and raspberries. What about the Rosemary Focaccia Bread? Savory dough on the house served warm with three different types of olive oil you can taste. Next came 6 crostinis, we had one each, I ate the Crab Heirloom Tomato Avocado Apple Aioli Crostini, pretty in looks yet light in flavor, crabmeat was fresh. All the other ones were appealing in presentation, there were no complains. For appetizers I'm just going to talk about the Crab Cake and the Fig Gorgonzola Tartlet, those were my favorite ones. The aioli complimented the crab cakes very well, smoky yet tangy. As for the tartlet, a lightly seasoned salad wrapped inside buttery prosciutto, how I wish there were more cheese on the plate.For entrees we shared with the one sitting across, it was too hard to split among all 6 of us and try every dish since we had a long narrow table. Joanna N. and I shared the Paella Del Mar and their Maine Lobster Bouillabaisse. The paella was a good size and came with perfectly cooked mussels, shrimps, scallops, and calamari in the cutest single size pan. The dish had great flavor, rice was tender yet al dente, what a paella should be all about. On the other had, the Bouillabaisse is a bit on the smaller side. The broth, lobster bisque perhaps, is poured in the bowl at the table, too bad there wasn't a spoon anywhere to sip it all up. Fresh, perfectly cooked seafood with a couple of sauces to play around with--rich garlic aioli and a small dish of olive oil.Always room for dessert and we did 4 of them! I loved their Warm Chocolate Souffle., irresistible warm chocolately ooey goodness. I also enjoyed the Dessert ""Crostini"", which was brilliantly put together with preserved cherries, mascarpone cheese, and crushed pistachios on top of a square shaped cookie.Everything went well for us this past Thursday night, except for one mistaken dish but our server corrected it right away with a smile.

142,SK5P1vs-Wh_k0wNDe25dQg,Camille H.,3.0 star rating,"The location and decor of this restaurant is a solid 4, however there were some things that knocked this review down to a 3 for me.I dined with 3 of my friends for restaurant week. We had a 7pm reservation and were  seated about 10 mins after 7pm. The waiting area was a little cramped but not a big deal.We were seated at two tables pushed up against each other, sandwiched between two single tables. It was a bit too close for comfort. I was almost rubbing elbows with my neighbor and could hear her entire conversation with her dining companion (it didn't help that they were loud talkers). Meanwhile the music, while modern and upbeat, was a little loud and made it hard to hear my soft spoken friends.Our waiter was ok, but he was a tad sarcastic. I asked him how much tea was before ordering and he was like twenty thousand dollars or something stupid like that. Just answer the question, chandler! Also, do servers no longer check in on patrons to ask how things are at high end restaurants anymore? This also happened at Acme NYC the other day.I ordered mint tea ($4, in case you're wondering), mushroom croquettes, branzino (came with figs and snow peas) and the pot de creme. My friends had basically the same things with one person switching things up by ordering the fig and olive salad for her appetizer, and two others test driving the paella and mediterranean chicken for their entrées.I explained to the water I couldn't have potatoes, which came with the branzino, and asked for veggies instead since I saw yelp pictures with the substitution. His response was that substitutions were only for full paying customers and that he would just leave the potatoes out. Really working hard for that non-tip!On to the food;*The 6 mushroom croquettes were small, creamy, crunch and delicious. It tasted like cheese inside instead of mushrooms.* The branzino had a hint of sweetness thanks to balsamic vinegar. While the portion looked teeny tiny I can say I was full after eating it - without consuming a side of potatoes and without a substitution* The seafood paella had great presentation but was filled with rice and low on the actual seafood.* If you're super hungry, the mediterranean chicken is probably the dish for you. The portion size was very generous and my friend couldn't even finish her meal.* The pot of creme was a bit of a letdown. I thought the chocolate would be melted but it was cold and rich. The creme was unsweetened and there wasn't much of it. Pictures showed this dessert with a cup filled to the brim with creme (which I was looking forward to) yet all four of our pot de creme's were only halfway full last night. So... looks like they've started skimping in this area over time. No buenoFinal reason for my lowered rating is that while tasty, all of the food was lukewarm instead of being hot (including the croquettes) - I hate that. Also, there seemed to be a lot of accidents happening around me (waiters dropping things, knocking into me while passing, etc.)The good - Our server split our check just as we wanted without any issueGreat ambiance and high quality food",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"
143,csh0PAMybLGHAlT_9SEEHA,Joanna N.,4.0 star rating,"I've been to this Fig and Olive a handful of times over the past few years so this review is definitely long overdue. But, I've always had good experiences. Since my most recent visit was yesterday for dinner, this review shall document that. I love the ambiance here. So trendy, warm and romantic. Good for all occasions. The ceilings are high with tidy shelves upon shelves of wine. The kitchen and staff area are semi-open to reveal everyone bustling with activity, yet dinner was slow paced and relaxed. My girlfriend had purchased a Groupon for 4 but since we had a party of 6, we just ordered 2 additional entrees. The Groupon allows for 6 crostini, 4 apps, 4 entrees, 4 drinks and 2 desserts. As with most deals, there were a few ordering restrictions but none that affected what we had in mind.The crostini here is delightful. I've tried most of them before but the one that I ordered last night - mushroom, artichoke, truffle, scallion, parmesan -- is now my new favorite. There was a generous heap of incredibly flavorful mushrooms atop the rest of the ingredients that worked so well together. I could have devoured 5 more, easily. For apps, we split crab cakes, sea scallops, octopus and a fig gorgonzola tarlet. Since there was 6 of us, we pretty much only got a bite each of everything. My favorites were the crab cakes and scallops though. Small, but fried just right, filled with finely shredded, well seasoned crab meat. The scallops were seared and seasoned perfectly, too. The octopus, sliced as thin as deli meat, was just ok. I could have also passed on the tart which was not very memorable. I was hoping for more gorgonzola. More fig! One of the entrees I've never tried was the lobster bouillabaisse(grilled scallop and lobster, Chilean sea bass, mussels, lobster bisque) so that's what I went with. It was fairly small but pretty good. The bisque was poured into the dish table side. It was rich yet subtle in flavor. The seafood was perfectly prepared though. The flaky sea bass was the best. Desserts(we ordered two extra) were mostly wonderful. The dessert crostini -- simple but great. The maraschino cherry added the ideal amount of sweetness.  Chocolate pot de creme was smooth, creamy and addicting. The creme brulee cheesecake had a weird texture and was way too rich. The chocolate souffle did not rise but was gooey and decadent nonetheless.Service was pretty slow but we didn't mind since we were catching up.

The salad that came with the chicken was quite large and had some interesting additions, like brussels sprouts and green beans.The waitstaff was attentive but not overly so. The food took a while to come out, but seeing as I was out for Sunday brunch I appreciated the time to sit and chat with my friends.

It's sweet and it tasted pretty good. My cousin E. however thought it was bitter. I actually prefer this drink over summer in provence. [4 / 5] - SUMMER IN PROVENCE (cocktail) - gin, house made rosemary thyme syrup, muddle blackberries, fresh lime juice. This was pretty good. My only gripe was there were too many blackberry seeds in the drink. [3.75 / 5]- CROSTINI: This time I ordered the 2 I had last time and tried a new one. The new one I tried was the Mushroom, Artichoke, Truffle, Scallion, Parmesan. It was alright but the Burrata was definitely better and LAST TIME I CAME HERE THE CROSTINI WAS BETTER. This time the toast part of the crostini was SOGGY and by the time you brought it to your mouth it fell apart on you. Last time the crostinis were crunchier and harder and it didn't fall apart. - FIG & OLIVE BURGER - The burger was topped really high and therein lies the challenge of getting a bite out of it. What's unique about the burger are the PICKLED ONIONS and I usually don't like raw onions or onions in my burger but these pickled onions are actually quite good. What's also great about this dish are the FRIES and the SAUCE. The fries are so skinny and crunchy!! I really love the TOMATO SHALLOT AND MAYONNAISE SAUCE. It's kind of sweet and it pairs well with the fries. This also comes with a small side salad and I definitely think it helps balance out the meal especially with such a meaty burger. The beef patty was medium done and it was quite good.[4 / 5]THE OKAY:- FIG & OLIVE SALAD - Manchego, fig, apple, tomato, walnut,olive, romaine, fig-balsamic - arbequina olive oil. Tasted pretty good. I liked the fig balsamic and olive oil dressing. Ingredients were fresh. You get big pieces of succulent figs in the salad - definitely a plus. What I didn't really like were the olives. They put too much but you can always push them to the side. I usually don't like cheese but the manchego was alright. It wasn't overbearing like goat cheese. Its similar to mozzarella but it's consistency is harder/stiffer than mozzarella. [3.5 / 5]- PENNE FUNGHI TARTUFO - too much truffle oil with penne and trumpet mushroom. This dish felt like it was lacking something because the dish was just covered/drenched in truffle oil. Don't get me wrong I love truffle oil but it just didn't work with this dish. It was lacking meat or some kind of protein in this dish. I would definitely recommend adding the Chicken for an extra $6 to make this taste better had I known earlier. [3 / 5]CON:- RIVERA SALMON BURGER - I didn't really like the salmon patty which was mixed with shallots, capers, and dill. It just tasted like salmon mixed with herbs and it just didn't sit too well with my palate. This also comes with skinny fries. I didn't really like tartar sauce or whatever the white sauce was for the fries. It was kind of sour.  [2 / 5]NOTE: I felt like I had a better time last time versus this time. The food for restaurant week during dinner tasted better than the food for brunch.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

My bf ordered their filet and compared it as 1 of the best steaks he's ever had and he's had plenty! I ordered their truffle penne and it was ok. I've had better. My personal opinion was it needed more truffle but I'm a truffle junkie so that's my preference but the dish was pleasant. Our apps included the Crostini (fantastic!) And the bibb lettuce salad with champagne vinaigrette (delicious!). Our meal ended with the chocolate souffle w/vanilla bean ice cream. Everything was fantastic.

We all tried different ones- they were all good. I had the salad as well, absolutely delish. I think it was their house salad of sorts. I am a sucker for a salad with figs in it. We all had the mushroom risotto for dinner. It was perfectly cooked- not mushy or anything. For desert I had some sort of sorbet and cream if I remember correctly.

I've been here several times and most recently this past Thursday with a girlfriend. Apparently on Thursday nights they have some sort of pink ladies theme with a DJ and drink specials.I had a few of their martinis which were heavenly and they had a large selection of drinks and wine.It is also restaurant week so we opted for the $42 menu. I started out with+ Mushroom crostini with artichoke, truffle, parmesan- Shrimp crostini with avocado, cilantro, tomato+ Octopus crostini with hummus, pimentonAll were heavenly. I highly suggest getting a few crostinis to share with the table. The shrimp one I wasn't crazy over, but the other two were AMAZING+ Paella del mar - paella with seafood (scallops, mussels, octopus, you get the idea!) This was great and surprisingly light. They don't give you a huge portion (or maybe because I ordered off of the restaurant week menu) but it's enough and properly entree size. The peas were a bit overkill as there must have been a zillion (and who the hell even LIKES peas?!) but nonetheless, solid dish to order.I finished with the chocolate mousse for dessert which was awesome.This is a loud sceney type place but great to go every once in awhile.

Next time, we'll have to try the charcuterie plate but we sat down for a real meal that night.Croquettes - amazing. Creamy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Couldn't tell it was mushrooms hidden in that ball of rice because it was so tiny but a good starter. Make sure you get the crostinis! Bites of classic flavor combinations in Italian spots like manchego and fig, goat cheese and chives, prosciutto. I don't think you can go wrong with crostinis so definitely a crowd pleaser. Vegetable linguine was simple and delicious. I like my pasta dishes sauce heavy so I wished it had more pesto, but there's definitely enough to coat each strand. The dish mixed in zucchini spaghetti with regular spaghetti and I couldn't even tell the difference.

The food however, was great.The second time I went for a work-related dinner event and everything was absolutely perfect. The service was top notch and the food was great.Today was my third time at this location and it was packed at 2pm. So packed in fact, that the kitchen was massively backed up and slow. So slow that it took nearly 30 minutes to get our bowl of olives (appetizer) and an hour for our lunch to come out. Just when I thought I'd shoot myself if my 10-year-old asked me one more time when our food would arrive, the food arrived. And it was, of course, great.Ultimately F & O gets 4 stars from me because despite all of the delays, the food is consistently fresh and delicious.

I've been to this location multiple times so I feel like I'm in a position to say - every time the service has sucked. For the prices you pay there it is mind blowing to me that it takes forty minutes to get a drink and you then have to get up yourself to get the waiter to ask why its been over an hour to get your dinner entree or dessert. I literally had to get up twice to find our waiter as he just never came back around to check on us (and it wasn't even busy that night!).I've been here three times, every time I had a different waiter but each one just seemed to have an attitude and was less attentive than anywhere else I've ever been.

The ceilings were very high. Many people were dressed business casual, but there were some people wandering amongst the crowd dressed casually, but still neat. The service was excellent, as it was prompt and our waiter was excellent. The noise was a bit on the loud side, so it was a difficult to hear the waiter and your table mates.All of the food on the restaurant week menu was fantastic and so was the larger than usual selection! 6 appetizers, 4 main courses, 2 dessert options! Rarely do you see 6 appetizer choices for RW!As for what we ordered, we had a party of 4, so we basically ordered different dishes for the appetizers and entrees. ----- AppetizersProsciutto, Octopus, Shrimp CROSTINI - Not on the RW, but the waiter recommended it. The toppings were generous and the crostini bread was really crunchy. FIG & OLIVE SALAD - It was what it was, a salad. The romaine lettuce was very fresh and I liked the simplicity of the ingredients. Definitely for the lighter eaters.SALMON TARTAR - Another very simple dish, but the portioning of the tartar surprised me. Once again, nothing but freshness coming out of this plate. The salmon was excellent.TRUFFLE MUSHROOM CROQUETTE - My fave of all the appetizers! I'm biased towards truffle anything, but the truffle sauce was amazing. I could've ate 50 of those croquettes + truffle sauce! The croquettes were crisp where each and every bite was the perfect crunch.MELONE & BURRATA - A strange looking dish with a piece of cantaloupe as the centerpiece. It wasn't too memorable in either direction.----- EntreesPETITE FILET MIGNON - Had mine cooked medium rare and it was perfect! The steak was about 8oz. and it was extremely tasty with juices flowing out of it. The size of the steak with the mashed potatoes and string beans hits the spot!RIVIERA SALMON - Fresh, light and once again cooked to perfection. ROSEMARY LAMB CHOPS - For an extra $6, it was well worth it! They give a big serving with 5 pieces of mini lamb chops. Flavor was outstanding on all of the pieces and they were very easy to cut thru.----- DessertDESSERT ""CROSTINI - Out of the 2 desserts, this was my preferred one. I love strawberries and this one had a piece sitting on top of some mascarpone and a crostini. Really good combination.CHOCOLATE POT DE CRÈME - This was an interesting one. They serve you with a small cup of vanilla cream and you mix the praline financier cookie into the vanilla cream. What you get is a chocolate concoction that you can scoop up with your spoon. A bit sweet, but nonetheless very well thought of and irresistible for those with a sweet tooth.I loved the atmosphere here and the food was excellent!

Of course we ordered the mushroom croquettes and we both got the Penne Funghi Tartufo with added scallops. The mushroom croquettes were pretty typical; a little greasy and weak on flavor. I recall not being as enthusiastic as the raving reciews about them. Or maybe that's the concept because the mushroom pasta was meek af as well. It tasted very...mushroomy and nothing else. The penne was sort of undercooked, it was very chewy. Overall it was very earthy and mild, oily. Which I guess is sort of what theyre going for. Maybe it was our mistake to order a mushroom themed dinner. The scallops however were A+, buttery with each bite oozing flavor and juice.

We arrived 15 min late for our reservation but the staff was understanding and accommodating. The maitre'd was pleasant and made sure that we we had a comfortable seat (in a less noisy area of the restaurant). Unfortunately, I did not get his name. Our waiter was knowledgable and helpful. His suggestions for food and drinks were spot on. I mean, everything was pure perfection. The crostini trio was a palate pleaser, the scallop appetizer was flavorful and ideal for sharing. I expected the portions to be small, but they were surprisingly filling. I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass, which far surpassed my expectations. The combination of the citrus and grapefruit flavors were robust (a party in your mouth), and the texture was just right. It tasted unbelievably fresh. My boyfriend ordered the branzino and was beyond impressed. (they do not serve it whole as many places do-it's served in three smaller portions) It does come with a side, however. I would recommend ordering an appetizer in addition if you come to dinner famished. The roasted honey carrots or the mashed potatoes are a good option. The potatoes are made with olive oil instead of butter, so it's filling yet not heavy) The waiter was thoughtful and offered a desert of our choice because he knew that we were celebrating a birthday. Despite being satiated (not stuffed), we managed to take a few bites of the apple tart-which again, was perfect. It was just the right amount of light and flaky, with enough sweet. A wonderful way to end our dinner. Thank you for making his bday a memorable one! Cocktails Fig and Walnut Julep - really tasty, not too sweet, strong.

Other times we had to ask someone to get her so that she could come up to our table. And when she did she was in a rush to go to another table.

I had the Cucumber Cosmo and he had the Fig Julip. Both were tasty. Everyone was so speedy that we had to close out right away and enjoy our cocktails at our table.We were brought the small trio of olive oils and bread pieces...a fine size for sampling, especially with all the food that was to come.We each did the $38 pp restaurant week menu with the $7 add on for 3 crostini.  I was very impressed that the kitchen decided to give us basically 6 different crostini to try (neither of us had the same one), so we ended up sharing bites of each.  I don't remember all of them off the top of my head but ALL were outstanding.  Service was excellent and not too slow or speedy.  Just right.I feel like most of the appetizers and my paella were single servings as compared to the normal menu priced sizes but it was PLENTY of food.I had:Fig & Olive salad - fresh and flavorful.  Loved it.Paella del Mar - So filling.  Seafood was fresh..a little too salty in some spots but not enough to turn me off.  Rice was moist, plenty of peas, not a lot of chicken.  I think I got one small piece.  Don't know that I would order that dish again.Dessert ""crostini"" - Delicious.  One piece was missing pistachios.He had:Truffle mushroom croquette - Amazing.  I will definitely get that next time.Chicken Tajine - I seriously don't know what all the bad reviews are about on this dish.  The liquid keeps the chicken juicy..the flavors are outstanding, as are the accompanying sauces.Chocolate pot de creme - AMAZING.I loved this location too and had no issue with the house music being pumped through the sound system.  Will return!UPDATE:  We returned a second time during Restaurant Week and it was still outstanding and amazing.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

I saw a lot of tall, skinny, vaguely European couples eating and not really talking to each other. But the #1 thing I noticed - tiny food portions. Nothing on the menu is cheap, but everything is tiny. It's also deceptive because the menu is set up to look like a menu for sharing, but unless you're dining with ants, this is not a menu for sharing, in fact, most things we ordered were barely enough for one person.The trio of vegetables was literally 3 pieces of vegetables. Crostinis are so small, in fact, I think every time I come here the crostinis get smaller. Entrees were pretty delicious, especially the truffle risotto and the whole branzino prepared tableside, but $26 risotto and $39 a person fish does not impress.

The restaurant was buzzing with patrons and the staff seemed a little stressed out, so service was a bit inconsistent as a result. Our server was so friendly and made it a point to assist our table with any dietary restrictions and drink orders!The prix fixe menu was fairly good, but I would have liked to see a little more variety for the vegetarian diners at the table. F&O listed the veg options as a mushroom soup appetizer and a mushroom risotto entree, which seemed a little boring and repetitive. The kitchen was able to whip up a decently sized appetizer salad for our vegetarian diners as well, so that was considerate of them. Otherwise the food was great. We loved the sea scallops and the Chilean sea bass, and I heard great things about the steak. The dessert however, fell flat - the cute little meringue heart was adorable but I'm just not a sorbet fan. Sorbet tends to feel like a cop-out on what could have been phenomenal ice cream. Cocktails were fabulous and flowing - we tried a couple of different fig cocktails, F&O spin on an old fashioned, the raspberry mojito and the champagne.All in all, a good dinner at Fig & Olive, although in the future I might avoid their prix fixe events since I'm a fan of their regular menu options.

Usually I end up complaining about a mediocre menu with mediocre food and I wish I had not spent $35 on dinner. This was not the case with Fig & Olive. After our original destination for RW fell through, we made a reservation here and were happy we did. From the outside, it doesn't seem like much. It's dim, small-ish windows, and a tiny sign next to the door. Once inside, the entire space opens up with HIGH ceilings, long tables, and a beautiful bar.We were quickly seated after grabbing a cocktail from the bar. I had the julep and was not disappointed. It was tart but with a hint of sweetness and it packed a punch when it came to the alcohol content. Once we were seated, we received the regular menu along with the RW menu. We decided to order some olives off the regular menu and they were delicious, however, they took away our small plates so we awkwardly had to find a spot for the pits. The bread they serve is okay, not great, but comes with a few types of olive oil (ranging from mild to spicy).For my appetizer I went with the octopus. This was some of the best octopus I have ever tasted. It was sliced extremely thin, length-wise, and doused in a yummy olive oil paired with potatoes and olives. I could have had 3 more plates of that. For my entree, I went with the paella. The rice was delicious, while the seafood was just okay. It wasn't bad by any means, it could have been just a bit fresher. For dessert, 3 out of 4 a the table ordered the chocolate mousse dish, while I went with the crostini. When dessert was served, we were given 4 mousses. I flagged down our waitress, explained the issue, and she said, ""no worries! I'll get the crostini and you can also finish the mousse for free!"". My crostini came out a few minutes later and I was glad I said something. It was like a cookie on crack (best way I can describe it).Overall, Fig & Olive is fantastic if you love Mediterranean food. Our waitress was super nice and accommodating. The only thing I disliked was that you can get a drink at the bar before dinner, however, you must close out your tab before being seated at your table. Why not carry the drink tab over and add them all together at the end of your meal? Still a great place to check out.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

We did LOTS of research and slowly whittled our choices down to a few of the 'cool' places in NYC for showers. We chose Fig and Olive because of many things but most importantly was the incredible communication from their events manager Amy to us. We would email her and have answers within a few hours in most cases. And planning a shower in the nicer NYC restaurants can be challenging, but Amy worked with us and found a way for us to get past any challenges that came up. For example, we were working with  one place that's very well known as being 'equivalent to Fig and Olive, and asked a question. The response was, "" you already asked that question, check your emails"".  That is not how Amy treated us, she treated us as if we were her best customer and her only customer, both of which we were not. Plus they had the best menu of all the places that were being recommended on Yelp and Trip Advisor. I like to pick places based on how they treat us, and we really hit a home run with Fig and Olive. Once we booked, Amy passed us over to her assistant Derissa, who was also incredibly easy to work with.The Crostini's were all amazing and everyone loved them.We decided on a Shower Brunch and were able to offer excellent choices for those who prefer breakfast or lunch. All the food on the menu got rave reviews from our guests who came from NYC, NJ, the suburbs and as far aways as Seattle and Alaska. Our future daughter in law does not like over the top places that are too much. When we found Fig and Olive we knew it fit her personality, elegant and classy but not loud and brassy. We had so many compliments from our guests which made us so happy we picked Fig and Olive. The most important comment came from Kara, the bride to be.""Thank you both so much for a beautiful shower! It was low key and casual, but elegant and festive.  Truly perfect. I had a wonderful time. And the food was fantastic! I can't thank you both enough for all your hard work and effort.""Thank you Amy, Derissa and the entire staff at Fig and Olive for making this bridal shower all we had hoped for, and more importantly, more than Kara had dreamed of.

But then, why would you when everything you're trying to do in Meatpacking is just steps away?THE STORY: Fig & Olive is effectively a pregame to a club in Meatpacking. That being said, it's perfectly comfortable to enjoy some well-cooked, French- and Mediterranean-inspired dishes like the Primavera Lobster Risotto with brightly colored asparagus, caramelized carrots, cherry tomatoes, baby zucchinis, and snow peas with a rich and sometimes slightly runny lobster base. There are unfortunately fewer pieces of lobster than one would think would warrant the $32 price tag, but the ingredients are clean, fresh, light, and ultimately satisfying.But for most of the guests at this Fig & Olive outpost, the food is secondary to the loud house music and the clever signature cocktails, particularly the Piscine, which features sparkling wine on ice with muddled fresh strawberries. These are the guests that don't really mind that service is often rushed and inattentive, and that the hostess table is typically more rude that welcoming. But for a group looking for a stylish restaurant with easy eats in the area, Fig & Olive definitely won't disappoint.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

226,mSI_NRFOSxZwxP_HvuEwWQ,Sarah W.,2.0 star rating,"Overall, it seemed Fig & Olive's approach to the Restaurant Week Winter 2016 Menu was more, ""Hmmm...what are the cheapest items we can put on here, never mind if it's all bland"" rather than ""Hmmm...How do we showcase a delicious dining experience for a value price."" Save your time, money and select another spot for your culinary adventures! I was looking for a nice ""go to"" upscale restaurant to take out-of-town friends whenever they are exploring the Meatpacking/ Chelsea neighborhood. Fig & Olive Meatpacking hugs the High Line and is a short walk from Chelsea Market, Ground Zero Museum Workshop, the Gansevoort Hotel Rooftop Bar and great art galleries. Unfortunately, the convenience offered by its location was the pinnacle of our dining experience. The restaurant space is large, open and modern. Our group of three arrived for lunch. We were quickly seated. Reservations for lunch is unnecessary. It's quite empty. I ordered what was recommended by our waitress: the Insalata Di Frefola appetizer, Grilled Thyme Chicken Pillard entree, and the Chocolate Pot de Creme dessert. The dishes were completely destitute of engaging flavors! Even the complimentary bread and olive oil dips failed to fancy any of us. The samples at Trader Joe's tasted better than this! My appetizer was bland. My husband's Truffle Mushroom Croquette was delicious--we should've double ordered that instead of getting anything else! The chicken? Dry, elementary in it's preparation and flavor combination, poorly paired with a tasteless bed of greens. The dessert was ok. Good news is that I was in great company, my dining neighbor, a nice lady visiting her daughter, joined our conversation (hello awkwardly close, but sometimes surprisingly pleasant NYC seating arrangements), and we all enjoyed one another! xo",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

Located in Meatpacking, Fig and Olive's ambience was of course superb. There's a coat check, soft candle lit lighting, and walls covered with olive oil bottles, red wine, and plants. Our waiter was extremely nice and gave us plenty of time to look at the menu. I had the Octopus a la Gallega for my app, Paella del Mar for my entree, and Chocolate Pot de Creme for dessert. Paired it with a Fig and Olive cocktail. The Octopus is a beautiful spread and deliciously refreshing. The Paella reminded me of a gumbo, risotto-like rice dish with seafood works - scallops, mussels, and shrimp. It's very creamy and can get a bit heavy but the scallop was amazing. The Chocolate Pot de Creme looked quite plain but was the perfect dessert to top off the meal. Snack-sized, light, creamy, smooth finish.

The octopus is a cold dish and very refreshing. It served as a perfect partner to the truffle croquettes which were very delicious but very rich.-Chicken Tajine: very flavorful, the chicken is moist and delicious with all the vegetables. It also comes with a side of couscous. It's a lot of food. I ate half and took the other half home.-Paella: It was good, but I'll be frank it's not the best paella I've had. The scallops though were very good.-Chocolate creme de pot and the dessert crostini: both were good. Didn't really care for the cherry on top of the crostini so took that off.Besides the food we ordered I enjoyed the olive oil tasting that comes with the complimentary foccacia bread.

I want to give more stars, but I just can't. The drinks are very yummy, the bartenders are very friendly, the food is always good, and the wait staff are very attentive, but what is wrong with the host staff.  Had dinner reservation for 5:15pm, but my wife showed up 30 minutes early.  When she walked in, she was greeted by a hostess (big improvement from our last visit).  She checked in with the host to let them know she's here for her dinner reservation. Since she was early, asked the hostess if the bar still had happy hour and the hostess's response was, ""no, we don't have happy hour"" with an attitude as if it was beneath F&O to have happy hour. My wife walked over to the bar and asked the bartender, who responded, ""of course we have happy hour.""  By the way, Fig & Olive happy hour is mon-fri 4-7pm.  My wife and I have been going to this F&O in Meatpacking for years and happy hours have not changed.  I showed up few minutes after my wife and joined her at the bar.  When she told me about the hostess's comment, I was very surprised.  I ordered my drink and wife and I waited for our reservation.  While we were waiting we decided to order some crostini, which we always enjoy.  F&O always makes them taste so yummy. Okay, so 5:15 comes and goes and no one comes to inform us whether our table is ready or not.  By the way, the restaurant is empty and only one other customers beside my wife and me.  We saw the hostess walking by, so we reminded her we're ready for our reservation.  She asks us to settle our bill at the bar, so we did and standing round again for the hostess to come and get us.  After several minutes, again, there's very few customers, I walked over to the front and informed the hostesses that were standing there we were ready.  One of the hostesses finally seated us and our fabulous dinner started. I didn't get the name, but the bartender was very friendly and she made tasty drinks.  Our waiter was also excellent.  He suggested the chicken tagine which my wife loved.  Great recommendation.  He was very attentive, friendly, and helpful.  I wish I asked his name, so I could praise him.  Another great experience and dinner. I don't think the problem is the host staff, but poor training from the managers of the restaurant.  The host staff need just as much, if not more, training since they are the face and the first to greet all customers.  How do staff not know there's happy hour every weekday?  It's on their menus.  The reason I am so critical here is because F&O is not a one $ sign restaurant.  Believe me, it's not cheap here, so I expect more from every single staff.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

The restaurant has a large dining area and the ambiance is classy but warm and casual.  The service is friendly and attentive as well.The highlight for me, believe it or not, was the Spiced Orchards mocktail.  It was kind of like a mojito but even tastier although it's non alcoholic.  It used a gourmet apple juice with Thai basil, lemon, fresh ginger and lime.  So refreshing and delightful.  A splash of vodka or rum would probably make it even more fun.I thought the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict was tasty.  The crab cake itself was  ok (not lump crab meat (I'm a crab snob)) but when combined with the poached egg, sautéed spinach, hollandaise,and toasted bread, it was very good.  I also tried a sample of the Fig and Walnut Pancakes.  The pancakes were so light and fluffy and great with the slices of figs, crunch of the walnuts, and fig maple syrup.  Really yummy.  Finding availability for brunch at most restaurants in this area can be difficult esp for a group, but here we had no problem.   The restaurant is in a great location as well, right near the Highline and Chelsea Market.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

We arrived 45 minutes early and had a drink at the bar along with crostini appetizers. The bartender Anzou was amazing. I normally drink Chablis and hubby Merlot but the bartender allowed us to have a tasting of three different wines that are comparable to the ones we like. Hubby always gets very impressed by an informative bartender that takes that extra step. The atmosphere is city-chic and can get loud at times but we didn't mind it. We enjoyed the music the DJ was playing. He was playing 80s to current trance remixes. For dinner I ordered the Seafood paella which was very good. The only thing I found was that the mussels seemed a little more chewy than my liking but it could be because the size of them was massive. Hubby ordered lamb chops which was served with garlic gnocchi and fig. We have ordered lamb chops in many places but these by far are one of the best. It has this amazing smokey flavor and the seasoning is so fresh you can taste the fresh thyme. We didn't have room for dessert but from what we can see from our neighbors it looked delicious.

I would come back again. Oh did I say ""hair"" there was a hair in my fries. In all seriousness, I'm willing to overlook it and try this place again. It's a really gorgeous location, the price is meh, and the waiter was cool. My order was a Rosemary panini and truffle fries. Their appetizer was this bread with THREE types of olive oil from three different countries. I think it was Spain, Italy and Portugal. My favorite was the oil oil from Portugal. It had this ""spicy"" taste to it. Next time I go back I will be sure to take pics and update what I had, the presentation, as well as the service.

I drive by this place all the time and have always wanted to come by to check it out. First of all, the inside of this restaurant is gorgeous! The soft lighting and the giant racks of wine behind the bar are beautiful. It feels like the classy, high class establishment that it is.We were introduced to Mitchell who works at the corporate level, but had a long history in bartending. He told us about his experiences with working with alcohol and explained to us the scientific nature of exact measurements in crafting cocktails. That evening he created 3 drinks and let us sample each one. The Pumpkin Martini with its graham cracker crusted glass was my favorite one, even though I tend to dislike pumpkin. It had the crunch factor and thick, grainy liquid that combined to recreate a pumpkin pie. In this case, the sediment of the drink added to the experience. The second drink was the Pear Blanche. Strong and fruity, I recommend this one to anyone who likes frothy drinks, as it is made with egg whites. The last drink was the Fig and Mint Julep. It was refreshing and the shaved walnuts on top added a layer of interesting texture. The figs they use are not overly sweet which helps the natural flavors of the fig to kick in more.The crostinis they served throughout the class were so beautiful I almost couldn't eat them. Naw who am I kidding. They were frickin delish and I ate probably half the bread they served. Ranging from Shrimp Avocado to Manchego Fig to Prosciutto Ricotta, there wasn't a single crostini I didn't like. I also can't pick out a favorite because they were all so good. The presentation was so good they really belong on the walls of the Gugenheim. Beautiful establishment, perfected drinks, aesthetic dishes - what else can you really ask for?

Honestly, we didn't really have a great experience. I wasn't ""wowed"" by the food at all-- the service was ok though, but when the bill came I thought about all the other places we could have gone and would have saved all that money, lol. The crostinis were the only thing I actually enjoyed. The fig risotto was blah (needed some spice and pepper) and the beef carpaccio that the waiter said was the best was actually not the best I have had. It was rather dry, had limited truffle and was sticking to the plate. We didn't finish it.

Steph Q. and I happily accepted and it was just as delicious as last time. Fig & Olive presented us with a 6 crostini sampler and the ones I remember were shrimp with avocado, mushroom with artichoke, goat cheese with caramelized onion and beet with ricotta thyme. They were all very good and my favorite was the caramelized onion with goat cheese, which I was surprised about. I usually despise goat cheese but there was something about the combination of the onion with it that made it really delish! Since I loved the beef carpaccio last time, I decided to try to the tuna carpaccio. It was pretty good but I definitely still love the beef carpaccio the best. On our way out, we noticed a wonderful scent and inquired about the scented candles they had in the front. The hostess told us they were white tea candles and that we could order them from a brochure she gave us. At $20 for 4.6 oz, it actually wasn't too expensive. I love scented candles so I was quite excited to go home and order. However, the candle in the brochure is a mandarin candle, not the white tea that was at the restaurant. Oh well, another excuse to go back, eat some more good food and inquire about where to order the white tea candles.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

All of my guests had arrived by 9:40 and we were patiently.. (and hungrily) waiting by the bar. I do have to say the atmosphere of the restaurant is superb. A beautiful cozy restaurant with dim lighting for something more intimate. We were seated by 10pm and happy birthday to me! Nick Jonas was dining behind me. I didn't act like the 24 year old I am  by staring like a creep though, of course.  I thought, great!.. lovely menu, lovely ambience, this dinner is going to be great. Boy was I wrong.Not sure if the restaurant wanted us to starve to death being we didn't get served any kind of food until 11:15pm.... 11:15 !! and this includes any kind of table finger food, which we had to ASK for before keeling over from hunger. The waiter had spilt a whole beer on one of my guests, soaking her entire outfit. To try to make this situation better they tried bringing us a free round of shots... which.... ended up on another one of my guests. Now i have two soaked girls at my table smelling like beer and cucumber melon. The food was OK at best. After waiting almost two hours, this is not what i would have expected. The Crostinis were soggy, and the yellow-fin tuna carpaccio didn't taste fresh. I also had the bay scallops, which were good along with the mushroom truffle oil penne. The pasta was delicious, I will give that much to them.My boyfriend told them it was my birthday so i got a chocolate souffle ... which... was... amazing. I gave an extra star based on this magnificent dessert because it was just too good. So technically, i rate this place 1 star.Management knew they screwed up when the maitre d gave my boyfriend his cell number and email address to please give the restaurant a second chance with our next dining experience completely on them.Ehh, we probably wont give you that second chance, fig.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

Unfortunately, we got our focaccia and three varieties of olive at the same time as our colorful appetizers. This timing was not great, but turned out fine.The creamy center of the burrata merged with the sweet fragrant cantaloupe and slightly firmer tangy tomato and herbaceous emulsion added a savory feeling forging a rounder dish. The bold red broth of the lobster bisque was briny and smooth, dotted with pimenton chive mascarpone lobster pieces and a pretty crouton. Definitely a tasty summer soup highlighting lobster. Little rosemary lamb chops were served with elevated herbed goat cheese gnocchi. Slabs of grilled eggplant added smoke and bitter notes as relief of richness. My chicken tajine came with steeped oils, almond slivers and couscous. The chicken, dark with spices, was on top of stewed carrots, zucchini, onions, plump figs and green olives. The couscous was perfect to soak up the spiced sauce. The bitterness of the dessert chocolat pot de crème diminished with every bite. While the pretty dessert crostini focused on the ripe red strawberries on a crunchy shortbread, smeared with mascarpone, and drizzled with dark balsamic. Both had expected connections and contrasting textures.Our food was delicious, but our meal felt a little rushed.

Out of the three locations, I like the Meatpacking venue the best. The ambiance is a mix between intimate, modern and apologetically feminine. With dimmed lighting, shelves of different olive oils and flora that doubles as artwork, it's perfect for anyone who would Instagram the aesthetically pleasing food and decor. While you have a selection of meats and poultry, the food is more dainty than other Meatpacking hot-spots: truffle croquettes, paella, risotto, etc. The portions are big and if you invest in F&O's prix fixe menu, which is available Sunday through Thursday, you will leave feeling satiated and satisfied. My favorites are the ""Paella de Mar,"" ""Mushroom Truffle Croquettes"" and ""Beef Carpaccio."" Each table is also served bread and three different types of olive oils, which usually vary in origin and heaviness. Drinks are moderately priced, averaging at around $12, and also reflect the restaurant's dainty attitude. The quality of service definitely depends on the day, time and waiter. There was one occasion when one of my friends and I were given complimentary glasses of champagne as we were there until close.

When we arrived at 7 we were told that our table is getting ready so we sat at the bar for drinks. We weren't seated till about 835! Crazy right! By then we had asked several times for an ETA and were told twice that there are tables with checks on the table waiting to be paid shouldn't be much longer. If we had been giving realistic timeframes to begin with we would've just opted for indoor seating! At the very end of our wait we were told that they don't really take outdoor table reservations which was unusual because when I greeted the host with my name he acknowledged that it was ""4 for outside.""Okay, on to the good. Once seated the staff redeemed themselves by sending us over a crostini sampler which was delicious and very necessary as at this point we were ""hangry"" The food was absolutely delicious! We always eat family style so we had 2 salads and 2 beef carpaccio apps. For our main course we had the steak, branzino, paella, and truffle risotto. Everything was amazing but if I had to choose an MVP definitely the risotto! Our server, Anzou (spelling that right?, was wonderful and he took so many pictures of us. Sitting outside on a warm night in meatpacking always makes for good people watching and the ambiance was very intimate. At some point some crazy drunk pedestrian purposely knocked over our second bottle of wine.

I guess healthy portions? I definitely wouldn't have been full without the bread to start. And the creme brulee was tiny (didn't come in a ramekin as I expected). But it was really good too. I wish the lavender flavor came out stronger though, but that's a personal taste I guess.It was pretty darn expensive so I definitely won't be back on a regular day (until I'm older and have a good job) but for special occasions, for sure.

We magically got a reservation for 8:15 on a Friday evening (score!!!) we walked in to walls of olive oils that they showcase in their meals. The decor was in true NYC and meat picking district style. Place was busy but the service was amazing as well as attentive. We had drinks and chose off their pre fine menu and we didn't feel cheated because of restaurant week portions can be small at times but were just enough even if we didn't do it for restaurant week given the other foods that came in for the menu. Crostini, the house salad, fried truffle bites, duck, risotto(for the vegetarian guest) and the desserts were outstanding! Fresh tasting and wonderfully plated. My only negative was the rose old fashioned just a tad to strong for me but delicious in theory.  The whole experience was amazing from start to finish and will definitely go back whether it's restaurant week or not!  I just wish I had taken pics but it was date night and just didn't think lol",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

Tried the flatbread as an appetizer, which was delicious.For the main course I wanted the Chateau Briand, but they said they could only make it for two. I then asked about the filet mignon; I was informed that it is marinated in garlic, and that's the only way it comes. I have a garlic intolerance, so I couldn't go with that. (Steak shouldn't be marinated with anything as far as I'm concerned).I settled on the duck reluctantly--main course choices are very few. It arrived on a bed of purple, sweet cabbage; the cabbage was horrible! There were two small pieces of duck breast and a couple of baby potatoes. Duck was okay. Potatoes were simply boiled.My companion had a risotto. That arrived in a huge dish, but the quantity was only as large as  my fist. It tasted like something out of a can, like Chef Boyardee. Terrible.They served us no bread. I felt it was a rip off with sub-par food. After I left, I was still hungry, so I stopped by a deli and ordered a buttered roll to satiate my growling stomach.

There are also many high bar tables all over so you can choose to sit there or at a lower booth like table. We sat at the bar so we had easy access to drinks.

Mostly the food.Appetizer: We ordered the Carrot and Brussel sprouts and Scallops. The Carrot and Brussel sprouts were mostly apricots with shredded brussel sprouts and 3 pieces of carrot. Way too sweet and not what we expected. It was more of an apricot appetizer than anything The seared scallops were average. We received 3 on the plate. 1 was large and the other two were very small. The flavor was okay, but it certainly wasn't worth it.Mains: I ordered the Rosemary Lamb Chops. The pieces were very small and mostly fat. I was able to get 1-2 small bites from each chop. The gnocchi was cold on my plate when it arrived and extremely bland. Needless to say I was dissatisfied and still hungry. My partner ordered the Filet Mignon. The meat was tasty and well seasoned. However, the sides were bland.Dessert: We had the chocolate cake they offer for birthdays. It was good. We decided to bring the rest home because we were unable to finish it. When I got home and opened the take out box, it had been thrown in upside down and there was cake all over the outside of the box as well.Service: Our server was generally absent and didn't seem to care about our table. She never checked back with us, and was uninterested when she was present.Overall: Don't waste your time. We left a 20% tip to our server, though she didn't deserve it. $180 tab, poor service, bad food.

Fish was huge - EMP ate every bite. I enjoyed my gazpacho and couscous. J enjoyed his tasting menu.Bill was $123.03 before tip.The restaurant had high ceilings but not cavernous. Chairs were comfortable and since we were early, the resto wasn't crowded.Note: if you are wheeling a baby carriage, you will need help to climb the steps, plus the bathroom is small - my friend brought Allegra into the bathroom while I stood outside with the stroller.

I got really lucky and somehow scored a 6pm reservation the day-of shockingly. (It's a long story, but I had made a reservation a while back somewhere else, and had to cancel it at the last minute.)Fig and Olive delivered, on everything. In what could have been an opportunity to  gauge my eyes out, they had a really nice prix fixe with a price that seemed on point. First the olive oils and bread. Definitely delicious, although I'm going to say something potentially unnerving, so get yourself ready. I couldn't taste the difference between the olive oils. Sorry to let everyone down. That said they all tasted great despite my inability to differentiate them. To start I ordered the heirloom carrot soup which was a nice light soup, and sufficiently whet my appetite for the main: the most perfectly cooked filet mignon steak I think I've ever had. Seriously, this was just great. This is what steak is supposed to be. Tenderness and umami, and a consistency almost resembling that of butter. It was a blissful moment, and one which I will try to treasure.The plum pisco was a nice drink, and it was surprisingly strong I think. Or maybe I was just tired from a long week, it's hard to say.For dessert we had the chocolate brownie, which was extremely rich. A little bit too rich for me personally, but at that point of the meal I had no appetite because I was stuffed from everything else, so I can't really speak to this too much.Gorgeous atmosphere, great service, and to top everything off they brought my girlfriend a rose at the end, which I thought was a really nice touch for valentines.

326,29q3AESBw4TcU2qSlYJrrg,Alfven T.,4.0 star rating,"We had dinner here for restaurant week.  This was my third time eating here in the past year. We returned here based on past good experiences I've had. We arrived at our reservation time and were told it would be a 5 minute wait as our table wasn't ready. This seemed odd as it was early and over half the restaurant was empty.  Another family came in after us and was seated before us but I didn't say anything. We were seated in 5 minutes as promised. We sat at the far end of the restaurant at the tables along the white couch and pillows. Water was offered immediately and drink orders taken.  We ordered a white sangria and a red sangria.  Both were yummy. We then placed our order off the restaurant week menu and added on 3 crostini for a surcharge.  The server allowed us to pick our own crostini rather than ""chefs choice"" as noted on the menu.  We appreciated that gesture as we hadn't even asked for it. All this time we received no bread. We asked three different people for bread over the course of 5-10 minutes. The crostini arrived and as we were about halfway through them the bread finally arrived along with our appetizers.  The table was quite crowded with all this arriving at once and the bread dish had to stick off the side of the table.  A pet peeve of mine is when one course arrives before you finish the previous one.  I know from past experiences here that 3 types of olive oil come with the bread and they are described to you by the server. In fact we observed this taking place at the table next to ours. When the bread was finally brought to our table there was no explanation given of the types of oil. As we finished the crostini and started on the appetizers we saw someone approach with our entrees! He probably didn't realize we saw him as he turned around and brought them back to the kitchen. This is beyond frustrating that a restaurant of his caliber cannot get the timing right. Ok so now on to the food:Crostini: We had the prosciutto/ricotta cheese/olive/fig, the shrimp/avocado, and the goat cheese/caramelized onion.  All 3 were delicious. Appetizers: We had the tomato/burrata salad and the octopus.  Both were fresh and tasty. Main: We ordered the truffle risotto and the paella.  The risotto was very tasty and you could sure taste the truffle. However it was not very hot and had a film on top of it which was likely from sitting in the while we finished our appetizers. The paella also tasted fresh and was very good. Both portions however seemed small, perhaps because it was off the restaurant week menu? We observed a table with a larger portion of paella that we assume was ordered off the regular menu. Dessert: We ordered one of each. The fruit sorbet and the pudding.  Both were very good but again, small potions. Service: This was the downfall.  While everyone was polite and respectful, there was a major lack of attention to detail. Both the appetizers and entrees were brought out before we finished the previous course. We were never brought bread until asking for the third time. When the bread finally arrived it was too late to enjoy it. Also we were not given an explanation of the olive oils that accompanied it.  One big plus was that the busboy remembered we wanted no ice in our water.  He kept refilling the water and made sure to bring a separate pitcher with no ice in it.  Strangely one time, one of our glasses was filled with seltzer water. The noise level was very loud which was in a large part due to loud music playing.  It was hard to hear each other speak due to all the noise. If not for the service deficiencies I would have given Fig & Olive 5 five stars.  Due to the issues with the service (mainly lack of bread and courses arriving before we were finished with the previous course) that I noted above I'm lowering this to 4 stars.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

The white truffle olive oil gives it good flavor. Anyway, this review is about one occasion in particular.  Last month, I had brunch here for the first time. I elected for the fig and walnut pancakes. I thought they were perfectly fluffy and the walnuts were nice. Our water cups were promptly refilled. We were constantly checked on, which was great. Brunch was perfect UNTIL we got the bill. For four of us, the total was $64. We gave the waitress $20 in cash and told her to split the $44 balance on the three cards we handed her. There was a point I asked her to make sure she understood what I said. She repeated it back to me verbatim to confirm. When I received back the card sleeve, I was appalled to see $64 split between the three cards (approximately $21.33 on each card). She took the $20 for a tip! That's 31% gratuity, an amount I would never tip unless they served me with a gold fork and spoon. Overall, it left a bad taste in my mouth.

All the food was prepared with rich flavor. My favorites were the croquettes and the truffle risotto. They also have fig in everything including some drinks but I'm not complaining. Figs are delicious. Had my birthday dinner here and had a great time. Order to share so that you can try a lot of the menu. Small portions. The host was also pretty rude. He had tried to get us to sit at a standing table even though I had made a reservation for 9 people 2 weeks in advance. After some reasoning he got us a table with nice seats and space.

This place was very accommodating given we were bringing our 3 month old in for dinner on a Friday night. It was our 11 year anniversary and we were excited to go out. The place was packed but not once did we feel rushed or not catered to. Our waitress was a thin blonde kind of looks like Marion Cottilard and was super sweet and attentive. Managers (I'm assuming) came by to ask how everything was during dinner which was pleasant. If we could spare a minute from stuffing ourselves we would answer lol the food was that great! I had pasta and my husband had chicken we shared the apps and dessert. (Posting pics) The dishes were thoughtfully prepared and brought out with elegance. The way they poured our soup to the way they plated entrees and dessert was also a sight to see. You don't get that kind of experience everywhere even at the extremely fancy places like Tao.

That was one letdown, we pretty much sweated thru dinner which wasn't fun as we were indoors. When we arrived, we were seated pretty quickly for an 8 pm reservation on a Saturday night. We started with the crostinis, and as we were a party of 3 we ordered 9 of them. They were really good, enjoyed them a lot. We had some with prosciutto, some with fig, and some with goat cheese, and liked them all. The cocktails were pretty good too, I went for an old fashioned and it was made perfectly. We also shared a bottle of stags leap merlot, which was great, and I had the veal Milanese for dinner, which I thought was just ok. Really was nothing special, if I went back I wouldn't get it again. They also bring out bread with a few different olive oils for tasting, which is a nice touch at the beginning of the meal.Now, the service was kind of weird, at times too fast, at times too slow, and our waiter complained about the heat and his bus boys the whole time, which got annoying. We weren't finished with the apps when they brought out the entrees, which I hate. Maybe they were trying to turn the table over, but regardless I wasn't happy about that. For dessert we had planned something special for our friend's birthday, and we enjoyed the chocolate warm cake thing they put a candle in for her. I thought for what we got it was expensive too.The decor in here is pretty cool, the place is very trendy, fits right in for the meatpacking district. There's a large, ornate bookshelf when you walk in, and the bar is a huge square in the middle of the restaurant. I like this place, but that's about it.

Warning: the atmosphere is on the LOUDER side -great music - but just loud :/ Tables a fairly close to each -most are long style so you may be sitting next to someone you don't know! I came with a large group of friends (~8 of us) for dinner at 9pm. Great area in meatpacking so you can hit up bars or clubs after. Well dressed crowd in their 30s for the most part. My fave part is the large wine selection they have! The decor also is of wine bottles and olive oil jars!! Lovely atmosphere - little bit of poshness.For the food: Known for their pork chop and meat dishes -they were delicious. Adequate portion size so you won't feel too heffer to go dancing or drinking after! Salads were huge portions though. Salmon dish was a bit on the smaller side-my friend was super hungry so demolished that dish in minutes -bit pricey for the amount of fish you get. Don't go there Hungry in that case!Dessert: Unique on that stood out was Creme Brulee Cheesecake with peaches. This was a foodgasm! The cheesecake had the crisp torched top like creme brulee that crackled once you cut into it...the cheesecake was lightly whipped and had a thick creamy texture in a cute little round set up (see my pic) sitting a top sugar butter cookie. Now when you add the spiced peaches in this mouthful - it was definitely a foodgasm of intricate fruit, creme, toasty cake. I'd definitely just go back for the this cheesecake!My friends ordered the Chocolate souffle with ice cream on top which was warm and gooey but I'm not really a chocolate person so to me -it was exactly how a chocolate souffle was -nothing to write home about.

They were all so delicious. For the appetizers we had the truffle mushroom croquette and the octopus. When I had the first bite of the croquette it was so crispy on the outside and so creamy. The octopus was simply amazing. The olives were to die for! For my entree I had the branzino. I had to admit that I wasn't expecting it on the sweet side but I absolutely loved it. To me it was the perfect combination of sweet and savory. My boyfriend had the filet mignon. It was really tender, for me it could've used a bit more salt but it was still pretty amazing.

I came in at 10:30ish on a Friday and was promptly seated. The place itself is rather large with a ton of high top seating surrounding a rectangular bar and tons of low tables further away from the bar. They start you off with three different olive oils from Spain and fresh bread. We had a bottle of Pinot Gris for dinner, which was delightful. Very crisp and paired with my sea bass well. Our waitress was really nice, friendly, upbeat and knowledgeable, I like how she chatted with us a bit as the restaurant became fairly quiet towards the end of the night. I had their fig and Gorgonzola tartlet to start, which was fantastic. I asked if it could be made without prosciutto, and she said it wouldn't be an issue at all. The puff pasty was warm and flaky and the cheese, fig, walnut combination was spectacular. On top of the pasty was arugula and tomatoes which was the perfect finish. For dinner I had the chilean sea bass, which highly recommend and was just the right amount of food for me. It was light and refreshing, and the combination of flavors went together very nicely. I actually felt really good after dinner, just full enough. Everything tasted very fresh and I love how olive oil is a main ingredient in almost everything.

My favorites were the goat cheese with caramelized onions and chive and the Prosciutto with the fig. Their beef carpaccio was delish and so was the truffle mushroom croquettes! I shared my rosemary lamb chops entrée with a friend and it was more than enough! 4 pieces of amazing lamb chops with polenta and some veggies. Meat was ordered medium well and it was very flavorful! Would love to come back and try a few other dishes! My friend didn't like her vegetarian dish so she exchanged it for a vegetarian ravioli dish which I thought was okay.

Octopus may have been soaked in too much olive oil. But, the mushroom and the burrata dishes were very delicious.I tried a little bit of chicken Tajine. it was fantastic! The texture was tender and the sauce was delicious.My main dish was Mediterranean Branzino. I got three pieces of the fish with a side of mashed potato. I finished all three pieces without a guilt.

He then never came back until way later when he asked us if we wanted dessert, and by this time we were pretty much done and not going to order more drinks. We thought this was pretty bazaar considering most waiters push the drinks and always ask you if you want another round. Even though it was pretty busy it still a little unacceptable that the waiter never checked up on us or asked us if we wanted more to drink, he pretty much took the order and disappeared and runners brought out our food.

379,mmf-KP1c96i2eBm0cPuOXQ,Vivian L.,4.0 star rating,"I've been to the other Fig & Olive in Midtown East, and the two branches have wildly different vibes. The Midtown location gives off a much more intimate and comfortable feel, whereas this Meatpacking locale is a lot more glamorous and spacious, which I suppose befits the neighborhood that it's in! Come here if you want to hit up some nightlife in the area after your dinner =). Came here during Restaurant Week  (I'll admit, I picked this place largely because it was easier to book with a larger group than many other places). We had a group of 12 (the maximum you are allowed if you want to eat off the RW menu) and were seated at a long table in the back of the restaurant. For my 3 courses I chose the truffled cremini (a type of mushroom) croquettes, the lobster risotto, and the chocolate pot de creme. Scrumptious all around! The croquettes were amazing, crispy little nuggets of flavor exploding in my mouth, smothered in truffle cream, heaven! The risotto was perfectly creamy with a slight bite, and they were certainly generous with the lobster! And of course the pot de creme, which I've had at Fig & Olive before, is so smooth and rich that I just gobbled it all down, scraping the edges when I was done. A definite solid choice for RW, highly recommended!",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

The restaurant wasn't busy for lunch on a Tuesday. Since the weather was a little nicer, F&O had outdoor seating in front, but we opted for indoor because it's still quite chilly. Our server was Robert, he was friendly and offered quite a few recommendations. Although they did not have a formal bartender, our drinks came out amazing. We had the piscine (sparkling wine on the rocks with a few strawberries) and the fig & walnut julep (this was divine with excellent presentation and a great balance of flavors- a bourbon cocktail with mint, fig, and shaved walnuts on top- truly refreshing). We started with a cheese board, which had a fig jam spread, F&O tapenade, 4 different cheeses, and 4 pieces of bread. They never offered us bread with the olive oils. When the food runner delivered our appetizers, we asked for more bread, but never got it. There seem to be a lack of communication amongst the staff. When the busser came to clear our plates, I asked for bread yet again. He brought different bread from the cheese board, which is the bread with the olive oils and is normally given in the beginning of the meal. We decided to order from the lunch pre-fixe at $28 per person, which was an excellent deal. Our appetizer was the beef carpaccio ($3 supp), which was fresh and tasty. It was made with balsamic, white truffle oil (my fave), cherry tomatoes, shaved parmesan, and a few pieces of greens.My husband and I order the paella del mar, which was served on a cute, but typical paella pan. It came with 8 pieces of calamari, 3 mussels, 1 jumbo scallop, and 2 jumbo shrimps, which was more than enough. The paella's rice was flavorful and was softer than most paella's from its delicious broth. My husband prefers the rice in a paella valenciana, which is typically drier. Overall it was delicious and I finished the entire pan. My daughter ordered the penne funghi tartufo, which had mushrooms, parmesan, parsley, and scallions cooked with truffle oil. It was delicious. Our desserts were the dessert crostini ( 2 shortbread cookies with mascarpone, cherries, and pistachio pieces on top) and the chocolate pot de crème (a small pot/ cup of chocolate mouse with vanilla creme on top- it was delicious and not overly too sweet). Presentation always goes a long way. I felt the food runner could've cleaned off the food splatters on the plates before bringing our dishes to the table (which is seen in my food pics). Overall, it was an alright experience. I wouldn't mind coming back, but it's definitely not the top 10 restaurants to frequent.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

Definitely go with people who like to share because there are going to be so many things you want to try.  The lobster bisque was probably some of the best I've had and I loved the crostinis especially the carrot one.  My favorite meal however was the truffle risotto.

I understand they are trying to showcase their oils, but everything (especially 2 salads we tried) lacked acid. The crostini are fine, we tried all 6. Peas with ricotta is by far the best. I had chicken paillard which again, was perfectly normal. Definitely not a standout and the salad it comes with was served with a bunch of random things that did not match. Had the same thoughts on the fig & olive salad. Most hilarious thing we got was zucchini carpaccio which is literally a raw zucchini, thinly sliced, with a few shavings of parmesan and a drizzle of olive oil.

400,sjbtIm3kdOyRLE08JBMxIQ,Jacqueline H.,4.0 star rating,"It is strange that i have not reviewed this before Well the meatpacking location is in my opinion the best Fig and Olive in NYC (Actually i like the one on Oak Street -Windy City- better than any other one.) Especially in terms of ambiance this one is superior to the one on Lexington.But given the large number of choices in the area, you are likely to miss it. So. Let me tell about it. First, for the quality of the food and service the prices are extremely reasonable -and they should keep it that way, especially the prix fixe things are good in which you get the sample the dishes they are best known for. Such as the mushroom croquettes for a very nice appetizer -they can be salty though, but still delish. I also love their crostini selections -which gives you a lot of freedom to choose from. As main course try the chicken tajine -not my cup of tea in general, but i actually loved it here. As pasta you should go for the shrimp fettuccine -light and has a very flavor rich sauce.Dessert. Souffle is ok. But the chocolate pot de creme is good. Try it.Their olive oils are crazy good by the way -and the bread / focaccia that comes with it is enough to sate your appetite. Their wine menu is also good -good reds and some rose, you should know that i am not the one to talk about white wine as i hate it altogether. Give it a try whenever you are in the area -or better yet, go to the one on Lexington, which is very good for a weekday lunch or afternoon gathering if you have some free time as it is not as crammed as many places usually are. And since UES is disastrous in the food scene, it would be a lifesaver each time you have visitors from out of town who would not go downtown -their loss.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

My first impression was ok the manager (french) who greeted us was was very kind and even though the place was busy he got us a table after less than 15 mins. Everything was great (good service and food) until the GM (not the French one) started yelling at his microphone right next to us. My wife and me we both have experience with restaurant management so we knew that he was yelling at the floor managers or at the hostesses or both. Our dinner was ruined my wife was really disappointed so she decided to grab one of the hostesses who looked frustrated but as soon as my wife grabbed her she showed us the warmest smile we've probably ever seen she asked how could she help us and my wife asked her how could she deal with that manager yelling at her for what she tried to convince us that he wasn't yelling and after we insisted she finally said that it was a really busy and weird night and that everyone was stressed and that he would never talk to the staff in a bad way on purpose. When she left (because someone called her from the mic)  I could see that she was still frustrated and we kept and eye on her. For our surprise even when we thought she (and the other hostesses) was about to explode she was just kind and warm to all the guests. Just wanted to write this review because people like that deserve to be published and awarded. We only hope that the managers over there apreciate what they have with that girl and know what they can loose letting her go.

It was very good and my friends enjoyed their meals as well. We finished off with desserts which I didn't particularly care for, but my friends liked. All in all, it was a good experience and the staff was very pleasant. Would definitely come back again.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

They were top notch and with some champaign made for a great brunch. (French fries here are also great, and the croquettes I am a fan of - had that the last time).  Also if you can go during restaurant week I really think you will have a great experience.   You get to taste a variety of their popular menu items and it doesn't put a complete dent in your wallet.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"
412,3HwgeSe9godRPeKuILAVpg,Damaris M.,2.0 star rating,Nice ambiance. Waiter was nice.Food not impressiveAppetizer- Truffle Mushroom Croquette. Wasn't what I expected. Tasted like a frozen food dinner. Not that I have ever had one. I can only assume that the taste isn't natural. Dinner- Coming from Miami I wanted to taste the Paella because I like to compare and normally love it. The rice was under cooked which is a common review on yelp that I now see... The calamari was over cooked.  I sent it back and it came back salty. I can only assume they added water and salt to cook the rice more. So major sodium overdose. If you know Paella this is a poor example of it. So I gave the second star because of the ambiance.  Don't fall for this place based on the looks of it. Never Again..This is my first review. This place inspired me to write this. If your a chef like my sister is I would urge you to eat here and write your own review.,Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

I was recommended by friends to try out the happy hour at Fig and Olive in the Meatpacking District. Since we had reservation at Buddakan at 6:30 pm we figured we would have a drink at F and O. When I got there, the place was closed for a private event. I had looked up the website and there was no mention that the place was closed to the general public this evening. I suggested they update the website so people like me don't waste their time planning an evening where they shouldn't. The manager who refused to disclose his name but he is slim built and African American with a beard - was extremely rude and talked to me in a derogatory manner. How does one do this and still hold their job? I will be taking up his behavior with the main office.

It was Restaurant Week so the novio ordered from the $38 dinner menu (appetizer: mushroom croquettes, entree: filet mignon, dessert: waffle with berries).  Since restaurants almost always give us TOO much food, I opted instead for the regular menu items, hoping that this would balance out the food quantity.   We ordered first the octopus appetizer and then added the Burrata salad  later because the portion was not filling.  I was still very hungry.  If you're a fan of flavor, get the mushroom croquettes.  They are intensely good (and they're truffled so how could they go wrong?).  The octopus appetizer is not that great and they present it on a big plate for you, but the octopus is sliced so incredibly thin that you can't even taste the octopus.  Filet mignon wa tender, but lacked flavor.  There was a sauce to pair with it, but it had congealed and was not very appealing (clear sign it had been left out too long).  All in all, a decent experience, but I wouldn't recommend it over the other options available to you in the MPD.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

There's a lot of peas on the menu if that's your thing. One of the best drinks included bourbon fig and shaved walnuts. It was too good to be an alcoholic beverage. The flourless chocolate cake was excellent in flavor and creamy texture. It was also a nice size so you can probably share it. Service was wonderful.

So although I enjoyed the food very much, I can give this place high stars due to the extremely poor service. First, when we sat down with waiter came up to us and asked if we wanted water. Great start! We got water. But then about 20 minutes later he came back to get our order. We ordered drinks, appitizers, and the main course at the same time. We got our appetizers within 15 minutes, then drinks after 10 more minutes. We have to ask for bread with olive oil twice. I think that our waiter would have never brought it out if my friends hadn't known that they gave bread and olive oil before dinner. And we had to ask for it TWICE! We waited another 15 to 20 minutes for our main course and then we got dessert. Besides the horrible wait time for everything, the waiter was not very kind or tried to make an effort to connect with us to make our experience enjoyable. One time when we tried to get our bread basket, we tried to signal that we needed him and he avoided eye contact. The next time he came around I had to actually call out to him to get his attention.The food was good. We ordered 6 crostinis. The one with goat cheese, chives and carmalizrd onions was the best one.

The Manchego cheese Nd fig was also good. The cocktails were yummy and well balanced. But I was a bit bummed when I saw the wine list. I had the beef tartare which was good, but the mushroom croquette was so perfect; not too creamy and te truffle sauce complimented it very well. My best friend had the lobster samosa which was very light and sweet, they used phylo sheets to wrap it with.As for the main course, I had the lobster rissotto which was okay.. I feel like it was a bit over cooked for my taste. They had the filet mignon, very very good. It had the perfect char outside and was cooked medium like we asked.For dessert the pot de creme was the best we ever tasted, not too creamy and just the right amount of chocolate sweetness.

The Shrimp Crostini with avocado was perfect, crusty and the pesto added a zing to it. We loved the Chicken Samosas and also shared a portion Red bell pepper Crostini and that was good too. The Truffle Risotto was excellent, so was the Gnocchi and the Sea Scallops. We finished off the meal with the Chocolate Souffle that had tiny bits of orange  and it was absolutely  DELISH! The service however was pretty erratic and we had three servers - all in rotation.

After a stroll on the High Line we exited and found ourselves on W13th.  Ahead the Fig and Olive.  Outside or inside seating is available.  We did go in and the interior is everything one would think high end should be. Light and open interior with walls lined with shelves of beautiful olive oils at the entrance and wine bottles  in the bar area.  As lovely as it was we opted for the people watching seats outside.  Foot traffic was high due to perfect weather.  Our server Darraug was a gem.  He spent time on the drink/wine offerings  with over 30 wines offered by the glass.  I opted for the Rossellini;  Passion fruit vodka, fresh squeezed blood oranges and lime juice.  This was a refreshing treat and new to the tastebuds. Also a Sangria Rojas with fresh muddled fruit, brandy and bite sized pieces of fruit, as well as a stunning glass of Cabernet Sauvignon from Lombary.  We moved on to the food.  We love to order many dishes and share everything.  We started with the Yellowfin Tuna Carpacco with Cilantro and Toasted Sesame oil.  The fish was shaved paper thin cold with just a hint of oil, then we shared the 6 piece mixed Crostini. This was one of the most amazing dish I have experienced in quite a while.  A perfect bowl of Gazpacho Wes up next, cokd; creamy and just blended enough to allow for the crunch of all the ingredients to shine. Moving on we selected the Skirt Steak with fries Med Rare cooked to perfection,  Provence Roasted Chicken, served with rosemary; garlic, lemon raratoulli and conflict heirloom potatoes.  This dish was grand. And finally Spanish Cod served with zucchini, fennel, tomatoes and chickpeas.  Everything we ordered was presented beautifully . The service impeccable;  we were giddy on wonderful drinks and food.   There was just one more element to add, Dessert; warm Chocolate Souffle,  Creme Brulee Cheesecake and the Chocolate Pot De Creme, oh and 2 Irish Coffee.  I did have the strength to take myself back inside to purchase 2 bottles of Olive Oil.  This was the best meal of our 3 day trip.Come here treat your self and some one you love to a truly marvelous food experience.  It's well worth the price and so are you.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

However, the restaurant redeems itself because the decor is very nice - feels like a contemporary Greek / Tuscan villa, they did a great job with the lighting, a comfortable orange glow comes from the bottles arranged around the center of the room in sky-high shelves. Service was good. The cute thing about this restaurant is that they specialize in olive oils, so they brought three different olive oils for us to try with the bread.

The entrees were disappointing, and there was no hand soap in the bathroom. Otherwise, this is a great place with excellent service (and really comfy seating). Gorgeous decor - take some time to check out the walls and touches everywhere.A selection of crostini was delivered to the tables, and most were absolutely delicious. My favs were the goat cheese/ caramelized onion/ chive (exceptional), mushroom/ artichoke/ scallion/ parmesan (yummy) and tuna/ mousse tomato/ chive (fun). I was less charmed by the others, but they were happily eaten by everyone.Appetizers were also quite good. I really enjoyed the tiny truffle mushroom croquettes, and the fig gorgonzola tartlet that I tried from a friend. Less successful was the zucchini carpaccio, which was an inventive idea but ultimately boring and underseasoned.We were full for the entrees, which was good since they were underwhelming. Fettuccine with shrimp, San Marzano tomato and marscapone was boring and the shrimp was overcooked, and the french omelets were similarly dull with a bit too much scallions and chives overwhelming the other flavors. Everyone who ordered the salmon seemed to enjoy it though.Desserts were quite yummy, with the stars being the chocolate pot de creme and the caramalized apple tart. I'd skip entrees and do drinks, apps and desserts here, and enjoy a lovely restaurant and a nice night out.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

The bread was delivered after the salad. Our waiter did very little to guide us through the menu. In fact, despite each of our entrees offering enough 'sides' on the plate, he encouraged us to order 2 sides for our table of 5. The filet my husband ordered was tough and was a strange smokey flavor. The Sea Bass was very delicate in texture, but lacked much flavor. The Brussel Sprouts were sour tasting and the spinach side was just fair, at best!

However they will not seat you until the entire party is present. We ordered a few Appetizers and they were devoured within seconds. We had Jamon & Bruschetta, Octopus and Crostini. We also had bread with different types of olive oil. For the main dish I had Goat Cheese Ravioli while others had Lamb Chops, Seafood Paella, and Shrimp Fettuccini. The portions did seem a bit small at first but we realized that they were extremely filling. Every morsel was eaten. It was unfortunate that we were too full to sample any of the dessert.

455,57YJbx_Bx2rOR4YREKktGw,Clara D.,3.0 star rating,"While some aspects of Fig & Olive are on point, my parents and I did not have the best overall experience at dinner on Saturday night. Upon making the 7pm reservation, my mom notified the staff that she is in a wheelchair, which brought about many issues. While this restaurant is technically wheelchair accessible, it is NOT easy to get a wheelchair inside. There are steps leading up to the main entrance, and so we were told we'd have to enter through the back of the restaurant, which we did not think would be a problem. We arrived early and the manager said it would take 10-15 minutes for the back entrance to be cleared for us. At around 7:15 a hostess led us around to the back of the building where there is an outdoor wheelchair lift. It took several minutes for her to realize she could not operate the lift on her own, then run around to the front of the restaurant and get her manager, who also fumbled around a bit before finally getting it to work. Then we were led through the building and through the kitchen/garbage area and received awkward stares from the entire staff. The hostess and manager were friendly and apologetic but this did not start the evening off well. At the end of the meal, we went through the same fiasco but it took about 3x longer to get the assistance needed. So basically our dinner started and ended on an unpleasant note. I understand that 99% of those who dine at Fig & Olive are not disabled and the restaurant doesn't have to use the wheelchair lift often, but since my mom notified the restaurant well in advance that she needed special accommodations, there was no excuse for the staff to be this blatantly unprepared.Anyway, once we were finally seated, we noticed how beautiful the restaurant is. It is gorgeous. It is also incredibly loud, with the sound system blasting house music. My parents and I were scream-talking at each other during the entire meal and still could barely hear each other. It was frustrating.The table service was not bad, but definitely not as good as one would expect at a $$$ restaurant. The food was great but I thought the portions were too small and, for the most part, not worth the high prices. The meal began with complimentary bread and 3 types of olive oil for dipping. We then ordered 6 different crostini ($21), which were presented beautifully and were all quite flavorful, but very tiny. My mom thought her Chicken Tagine ($27) was okay. My dad and I, in celebration of my birthday, shared the Chateaubriand - beef with vegetables - for $47 per person. The steak was delicious and cooked perfectly, but the price is absolutely outrageous for 3 slices of beef each. My raspberry mojito was perfect. And we enjoyed the dessert tasting, which came with four cute, tiny desserts.Though the ambiance and food were good, I left with a bad taste in my mouth because of the wheelchair issues, excessively loud music, and steep prices. With so many other amazing restaurants nearby, I would not recommend Fig & Olive.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

Finally placed the order of large sparkling water, Lamb meatballs and salads since we really had no other options for a full meal. Lamb meatballs arrived and where good. Salads arrived but no one collected the appetizer plates or share plates. First bite found a sticker from an apple inside. Called waiter over and he apologized and asked him for the menu to choose something else, also asked him if he had any cold sparkling water since mine was room temperature?, he went and checked and said they are all the same temperature. I had only a glass of it and billed for it. As soon as my appetizers came, I looked over to a table who sat right after us and they where allowed to order entrees, very annoying and a WTF moment.

Fine, so be it, both my friend and I had been dying to eat here and figured Restaurant Week was the opportune time. We chose to hit the Meatpacking location on a Friday evening, reservations for 2 at 7:15. When we walked in, the restaurant was already very busy, as expected for a Friday night. It appeared as if people we were waiting to get a reservation while I just glided on through, gave my name and was then taken to my table. Reservations are key people, don't you know this. Now it only makes sense to have two bottles of wine before dinner ... everyone does that right? Well with that being said, we were both really hungry. They started us with some house olive oils and some bread, not sure if they were all the same but certainly delicious.We had decided prior that we were going to do the crostini tasting but only three of them as they looked like a hearty serving. Well hunger took over and I ordered 6, go big or go home. The run down, Mushroom, Truffle Artichoke, Parmesan/Manchego, Fig, Marcona Almond/Gorgonzola, Onion, Cremini/Shrimp, Avocado, Cilantro, Tomato/Salmon, Ricotta, Citrus, Cilantro/Manchego, Fig, Marcona Almond. All of them were fabulous, and don't get discouraged about the size, it's perfect for splitting with another person. The standouts for my were the Shrimp and the Mushroom. The shrimp was marinated perfectly and accented the avocado and well one can never go wrong with mushrooms and truffle oil. With that being said we kept that theme rolling and had Northern Italian Mushroom and Truffle Soup: Cremini mushroom, garlic, onion, thyme - White Truffle Olive Oil. The soup was nicely pureed but still had some texture of the mushrooms adding a little bit of depth to the soup. The flavoring of the white truffle oil paired well with the garlic and onion but didn't overtake the dish. The Zucchini Carpaccio was stupid. It was Zucchini finished with olive oil, lemon pine nut, Parmesan  Picholine Olive Oil. The zucchini was flavorless and just had that raw veggie flavor to it. I meant to order the tuna one, but again two bottles of wine plus I felt like being a bad ass and having a specialty cocktail, don't do that either. For entrees, we had the Penne Funghi Tartufo. Who doesn't love pasta, especailly when it's prepared like this: Cremini mushroom, black trumpet, Parmesan, parsley, scallion - White Truffle Olive Oil. We truly kept the mushroom theme going, but this dish was a home run. The mushrooms were tender and melted in your mouth. The shavings of fresh parm were delicate and but didn't break at the stab of a fork. The penne was almost al dente and coated nicely in white truffle oil. Our second entree, Trio De La Mar Bouillabaisse, was not a winner in my book. The dish was grilled scallops, lemon sole, striped bass, côte d' azur fish soup, shaved fennel saffron garlic aioli and olive oil cracker - Saffron infused Olive Oil. The dish looked enticing when they first brought it over but the minute the poured the broth over the fish it just looked sad. Yet still full of flavor and the fish was prepared to my liking, it wasn't anything special. Nothing can beat dessert and once again my eyes were bigger than my stomach. When the desserts came out, I thought I was going to have to hit 16 Handles, but that wasn't the case. The Dessert Crostini, three shortbread cookies with  amarena cherry and mascarpone pistachio spread. Wow. I don't even like cherry's but they did this dish right. Pairing the tartness of the cherry with the salty and sweet combo of the spread worked really well together. The shortbread melted in your mouth with strong after tastes of butter and sugar. Our second dessert, Chocolate Pot De Creme reminded me a fancy pudding. Crunchy praline financiers & vanilla cream. To be quite honest, I don't have much memory of this, again either the booze or it didn't mean much to my palate. It sweet and served with a what reminded me of a piece of fudge with rice krispys in it, now you can't go wrong there! The decor here is very modern, clean cut and chic. It's basically how I want my house to look someday. The walls are lined with olive oils, which may seem a little cheesy but it worked.

The portion was very very generous-- in fact I could've done with less but I'm definitely not complaining about this. I ordered dressing on the side but somehow did not need it either because the salad was already dressed or the sauces on the meats soaked into the lettuce. Honestly it was so difficult to choose a dish because everything looked so good! I appreciated the relative simplicity of the menu-- a lot of times pricey restaurants feel the pressure to combine the most arbitrary foods...definitely not the case here. I loved the little olive oil assortment they brought out with the bread-- very tasty. I'll definitely be back!

While the hostess seemed a little irked by this mixup, she was very accommodating and was able to find us a table on a very busy Friday evening. I was very appreciative, made that known, and we were seated almost immediately after my snafu was resolved. The waitress who seated us was also very understanding saying that it had been happening a lot lately. I was still pretty raw about it, but was happy everything worked out.The cocktail list is fantastic (a pomegranate martinin is just fantastic) and the crostinin to start is a great way to a fantastic meal. For two, we split three: the burrata, wild mushroom, and cucumber. For dinner I had the sole (which comes beautifully prepared in a parchment bag straight out of the oven) with roasted vegetables and a side of garlic and parmesan mashed potatoes, my other half had the chilean sea bass beautifully presented in a deep plate delicate with a to-die-for cream sauce reduction and asparagus. For dessert, creme brulee NY cheesecake with figs and raspberry sorbet with craime fraiche, meringue cookie and a double espresso to boot. I was very pleased with my meal here, a successful birthday dinner. The ambiance is very trendy and beautiful, there is a life DJ (who was JAMMING) the entire night, and the olive oil tasting they provide (which is a specialty of theirs) gives you a fleeting moment of insight in the complex and expansive world of olive oils.

But the tables and chairs are so close to each others, we can barely walk by, and after we seated, people kept ran into the back of my chair. The staffs are very nice and very friendly, I have to give them a star on that. I ordered the Lobster Bisque, they are two options, with Lobster and without Lobster. Which to me is kinda weird, I thought it says ""Lobster"" Bisque, and now on the bottom like says with Lobster or without Lobster. Um......shouldn't it be just call ""Bisque"" if you are going to give me the options with or without Lobster? lol Just saying. Main Course I ordered ""Fettuccine Shrimp Mascarpone""This dish here, the Shrimp is reallllly good, the sauce in this dish was great, I almost drink all of it. lol The reason why I only giving it 3 stars instead of 4 is because they are over crowded with tables and chairs and leaving people no space to walk. Just think of a second, do you really want someone to kept kicking or bumming the back of your chair during your dinner every 5 minutes?

We were very happy with our food and beverage but the service was slow and we felt very obviously neglected. One example is our waiter constantly passed by the bar where our drinks were ready and waiting. I had to tell the manager that those were our drinks and we have been waiting for them. Also our waiter would constantly walk away without even asking to clear dirty empty dishes. All of this may have been excused but the restaurant was probably at 15 percent, almost empty.

485,ljBVfyHeKJ6Cfi-FKHCE0w,Meredith X.,4.0 star rating,"The qualm I usually have with participants of restaurant week is that they give a poor representation of their actual offerings. Poor quality, sloppy preparation, careless presentation, whatever it is, I usually leave disappointed. Fig and Olive was not one of these restaurants. Ordered a cucumber cosmo. Refreshing, light, delicious. Decided the crostini selections were too delectable (I love anything that has fig) to pass up so went with a trio tasting which included the machego, copa, and prosciutto selections. The ricotta cheese on the prosciutto crostini was creamy, light, served as a nice contrast to its savory prosciutto companion, favorite out of the three. Yellow fin tuna carpaccio as the starter. The tuna was so fresh and dressed lightly to really complement and not overpower the fish. The effort was undeniable when the tuna fell away with the gentlest tug of my fork. Pumpkin sage ravioli for the entree (love anything with pumpkin too, or maybe just anything edible?). The plate was sprinkled with with pumpkin seeds and the raviolis rested on a pumpkin puree/mash. The roast chicken actually served as the filling for the ravioli. Tasty and unusual ravioli form. I think I would have preferred a more traditional filling or have the pumpkin puree inside the ravioli instead. The raviolis were a bit dry (combo of pasta and white meat? nice effort though) so I think it would have been more enjoyable to have a wetter ingredient inside.  Disappointed with dessert. The dessert crostinis were glorified short bread cookies. Lacked complexity, exciting flavor complements. It seemed like they were haphazardly thrown together with no real thought behind trying to see how best to fit them into a flavor combination. Had a taste of the pot de creme. I prefer mine to be richer because hey, if you're going to have chocolate, don't half ass it. Really was expecting a more powerful dark chocolate flavor to come through but it was muted. Both were tasty but just were not up to par with the rest of the meal.Overall, great experience. The courses prior to dessert were all executed well. I would liken my experience to Mario Kart: you think you're about to win and cross that finish line and then someone shoots you with a spiky shell and you lose your win.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

I can't even begin to list them all, since I got drunk off all the truffle oil and burrata. After sampling each and every one of their amazing crostini combinations, I have concluded that all of them are my favorite. I also enjoyed the little tastes of fresh tuna tartar, thinly sliced beef carpaccio, warm truffle mushroom croquette, and creamy crab cake. I can only imagine how good the real food must be. The venue itself was very nice, tall windows to let in natural light (I presume), a large bar upfront with fantastic cocktails (I mean it, really fantastic), coat check, a very spatious main dining area with high ceilings and great ambiance, and of course, the usual good looking meatpacking crowd.

I could barely get out of my chair to use the restroom. I felt bad for the waitstaff who struggled to serve people because of this. (maybe that is why our waiter was a jerk?).

491,gAm8CvAejEMaGi4XpRjLBw,KC G.,3.0 star rating,"If it was solely based on location and atmosphere then Fig & Olive would get 5-stars. Right in the middle of Meatpacking, it's quite a spacious restaurant with a modern romantic ambiance. Unfortunately, the food and drinks were not as great. I'm not sure if it was because I went for summer restaurant week but it's disappointing when a restaurant reduces its quality for the promotion, which I think was the case here. The only thing that I was impressed by was the abundance and variety of the restaurant week menu -- and only 1-2 items had an additional cost -- but it went downhill from there.I started with the Salmon Tartar as an appetizer and was very surprised by the preparation of it. The salmon was served in large chunks rather than minced as is the usual preparation of tartar and it barely had any seasoning or flavor on it. For the main course, I had the Petite Filet Mignon which I requested as medium-rare. I'm not sure if it was the lack of a proper knife (they only gave me a butter knife) or that the meat was extremely chewy but in either case, it was difficult to eat. The worst part was the sauce that they tried to pass off as Bearnaise which tasted salty and sour. The dish also lacked any sides so I was left still hungry afterwards. The Chocolate Pot De Creme was probably the best part of the 3-courses but it didn't justify the disappointment from the first two parts. Lastly, for drinks I had sangria which was typical - nothing special about it.All in all, I would not recommend going to Fig & Olive for restaurant week. I do however want to try it regularly and see if there is a difference in quality.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

It was pretty empty, but the atmosphere of the restaurant was really nice.We ordered the following:- Prosciutto, Ricotta, Fig, Olive & Walnut Crostini- Crab, Heirloom Tomato, Avocado & Apple Aioli Crostini- Shrimp, Avocado, Cilantro & Tomato Crostini- Octopus a la Gallega- Sea Scallops- Mediterranean Branzino- Yellowfin Tuna a la Provencale- Caramelized Apple TartThe crostinis were all good. I am not a huge fan of olives, and was happy that the olive was not overwhelming in the Prosciutto Crostini. The Shrimp Crostini left something to be desired -- I think it needed some additional flavor, or possibly more cilantro. The Crab Crostini was my favorite out of the three that we tried.In terms of appetizers, both the Octopus and Sea Scallops were good options. The Octopus could have used more flavor/seasoning to complement the dish. The Sea Scallops were very citrus-y, and were one of the highlights of the meal.For dinner, we tried the Tuna and the Branzino. The Branzino was good, but was really nothing special. The mashed potatoes that came with it were bland, and I really think the dish could have used something else to make it stand out more. The Tuna was very good, and the variety of flavors in the dish came together very well. My only complaint is the way that it was cooked - we asked for rare, but it came out cooked much more than I expected. The rare middle of the tuna was excellent, but it was disappointing that so much of it was cooked through.We split an Apple Tart topped with ice cream for dessert. This dish was apparently a recipe of the owner's mother - I thought it was very good.For Drinks, we tried:- Sweet Red Pepper- El Matador- The Fig & Olive- Pear BlancheAll of the drinks were very good. I would not get the Pear Blanche again, because it was definitely too sweet.Overall, the food and drinks at Fig & Olive were good - but they really did not live up to the expectations that I had for the restaurant. In addition, our service was not great. The restaurant was nearly empty, but it took a long time for our server to wait on us, and he rarely came back throughout the meal.I am giving Fig & Olive a 4, but would prefer to give it a 3.5 rating if possible.

This may involve some Saudi royalty but more than likely it just results in a fine evening out on the town.  My point? Fig & Olive is a beautiful space, most everything I've had was perfectly proportioned and delicious tasting and to sum it up, there's a very small likelihood that your path will lead to disaster. Good for impressing friends, dates, or colleagues and it's large enough to accommodate big fancy dinners easily. The food and drinks are priced quite high, however, so keep that in mind before swinging by on a whim. If you're in the area between 5-7pm though, try the apperitivo menu that comes with a cocktail and sampling of appetizers.

We had to ask the bartender to take our drink order and then I had to get my own food menu because he never asked. Once the food came he never followed up to ask us how the food was or if we needed anything else. I felt like we were inconveniencing this guy by being there - it was awful. Please understand that I used to be a bartender and server so I'm usually not one to critique the service - I know it's not easy to do what they do - but this was unacceptable.

We started with the Sweet Potatoes Bravos, or something close to that name.  The menu seems to change often as they fully take advantage of the Farmer's Market across the street, and I don't see it on the menu today.  If you see it on the menu and you like sweet potatoes and sweets, with a tiny amount of heat, you should really try this.   For our entrees we had pasta with a rabbit ragu, and the fig and prosciutto flatbread.  Both were amazing.  The pasta reminded me of what Grandma and Aunt used to make, only slightly more refined (I'm not knocking my Grandma and Aunt here, but there is no room for refined when you have a bunch of heads waiting at the trough and you're cooking while doing the laundry and looking after the kids).  Every bite was just so fresh tasting and delicious.  There is no way any of this was ever frozen.  This is how food should taste.       Have a mentioned I wanted to hug everyone in the kitchen? I'm sure all the desserts are great, but we had the Warm Cookies and Cream.  If it's only the two of you, don't let the fact that it comes with red velvet cake, chocolate ganache, puro olive oil citrus cupcakes, pecan and mint chocolate chip cookies, new age black and white cookie, fried apple pie, peanut butter oreo, nutella rice krispie treat, pumpkin whoopee pie and pudding pops stop you.  Please don't let it stop you!  Go for it and just jog home dammit!

It did take the server a little long to come to us, but he was good after that. We ordered the Cinsault - Domaine De Rimauresq, Cru Class Rose, which was very refreshing after a hot day, if a tad a pricey side; but what the heck, it was a cru class. We went with the tuna tartare and the salmon crudo (tuna was better), the olives (no brainer), the heirloom tomato salad, truffled mushroom croquettes (this is a must!), and a few of the tartines. We also asked for the bread and olive oil, which came out with three different kinds of oil - I'm not sure if you have to specifically ask, but be sure that you do. Overall everything was great, and it's just hard to choose what you want. Go and explore; I'll be back!(Also, I liked the atmosphere, trendy, not too noisy - certainly not quiet - but not too loud. Would be good for a date or a group.)",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

I'm not much of a brunch person, but the prospect of drinking before noon was its selling point. Had the Crostini Sampler. You get to choose 3 to 5 of their crostinis depending on how much you want to pay. I highly recommend the mushroom crostini! It's unbelievably savory and deceivingly delicious.I split the burger with a friend. I regretted that decision. It was juicy, moist, and well made. It was a solid burger that surprised me. Maybe it was the lack of expectations?Next up came the Fig & Walnut Pancakes. Another highly recommended dish! A great way to end brunch.Actually, the star during my experience here from start to finish was their Bloody Mary. I was never a fan of BM's before I ordered one from this place. I've since been ordering from numerous restaurants and bars but they just can't seem to make it to the standard that got me hooked.Last words: I'd definitely come back here again for brunch! They get a little busy during their brunch service but it's worth the wait. Be sure to check out their mushroom crostini and fig pancake.

Her bad points was that she was obviously upselling us. She also must of been really busy and had too many tables because she would disappear for long periods of time. The tapas were delicious. The apps were great we had the truffle croquettes. Amaze balls literally. But the biggest let down was our entrees. I had the Lobster risotto which was one of there pricer dishes. The waitress convinced me when she described to me that it had a lobster tail and a claw. The claw was bigger than the tail. I'm not sure that is even physically possible in the lobster seafood world. The picture I'm going to post is going to show you exactly what I'm talking about. It was the biggest upset. I'm not even here to complain or bash any restaurant or any one but it is what it is. I feel cheated. But did not mention it to any one and said everything was great. I was so tempted to eat all the mediocre risotto and leave the lobster that came with the entree so I could send out a message to the manager that it's not fair to describe that dish as a lobster tail and a claw. It was painful to realize what they considered to call a lobster tail. Would I recommend this place? I'd say ""Give it a try but there's tons of better places."" Sorry but I'd never go back. Nothing stood out enough for me to want to go back. Well maybe the 2010 French Le Chateau Melbec bottle of wine that we had but I bet I can find that bottle for a fraction of the price that we paid.

Everything was absolutely exquisite, from the famous crostini to start with, the burrata, prosciutto, scallop appetizer, the lamb, the steak and sea bass. Lastly, the dessert was the icing on the cake with just enough to end the meal on a sweet note without having to leave feeling heavy. The servers were flawless in their execution and in suggestion the perfect wines or drinks to go with our different meals. I was completely blown away by their accuracy of wine pairing as I never had to ask to try another wine than what they first suggested. Lastly, the ambience in this restaurant couldn't be more perfect, the lighting is soft and romantic yet it feels trendy and bright enough to see your food.

So lets put him aside and focus on the establishment. Its a very modern trendy chain restaurant so I expected the whole.. "" Please take a seat at the bar until your table is ready"" treatment. Even with a reservation I had to spend an extra 15 minutes with someone I already knew I hated, staring at empty tables and bored waitresses as I downed my first Passion fruit Mojito. ( Which as amazing!)We finally sit down, and to my luck my waitress was in training. Which is normal, we've all been there. But did she really need to be escorted by three people at the same time!? Felt as if we were being reviewed as well. Extremely uncomfortable. Now to the food..The  Fig and Olive salad far surpassed my expectation. The nuts, and goat cheese mixed with the figs and olives.. yum! Amazing combination.The crostinis were good, nothing to rave about, and not worth the price in my opinion.My main dish was the Penne Funghi Tartufo. This is a dish that has so much potential, and shame on them for drenching it in oil. I get it, its truffle oil and has an amazing flavor, but having to strain the pasta of the grease with my fork is not acceptable. So what did my date order..? He ordered a chicken platter, but thats about as descriptive as I can get considering I didn't care what is was, or if he liked it.Long story short... no second chances for my date, or for Fig and Olive.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

The lighting is beautiful, the wall décor simple but elegant, the ceilings high and open. What came to mind immediately was that this place would be ideal for a rehearsal dinner/bachelorette brunch/baby shower... I blame the fact that all my friends are in 'that' stage of life (I'm not quite there yet). The beautiful space --seriously, this would be a great date night venue ambience-wise--is all complemented by the great staff and amazing service. Our server really took his time to explain the dishes and make appetizer/entrée recommendations. My favorite line, by far, was re the pumpkin sage ravioli (""To be honest, it's a seasonal dish... and it's not fall anymore"").So, per his recommendations, we ordered a trio of crostini to start. My friend and I both agreed that the prosciutto crostini (with ricotta, fig, olive, walnut) was the best one of the three. The mushroom crostini (with artichoke, scallion, parmesan) was too mushroom-y, if that makes sense; the manchego crostini (with fig, marcona almond), likewise, lacked balance amongst the ingredients.  As for our entrées, I ordered the Fig & Olive Chicken Tajine, while my friend had the Riviera Salmon. I wasn't a fan of the chicken tajine, to be honest. There was too much broth and not enough flavor... which doesn't make any sense. But the accompanying couscous was pretty good (and nicely plated)? My friend's salmon, on the other hand, was perfectly cooked and warranted no complaints from either of us. He gets the upper hand on the better entrée choice (this time). My take-away from this dining experience is that Fig & Olive is a beautiful venue... that falls short when it comes to the food. For the prices they charge, you can find better options.

It took us about 2 hours to finally even think about putting an order in for an entree and they didn't even care! We let the waiter pick our starters and we ended up with a variety of crostini and tartare. I had the mushroom crostini which tasted as good as it looked. You could distinctly taste every ingredient and they were perfectly sized. I then had the shrimp tartar and the sea bass tartar (couldn't 't find it on the menu, but we got it) and those also tasted like no other! Everything was super flavorful and cooked and prepared so well. Portions for the apps were also pretty decent. I don't think you can come here without ordering at least one appetizer. I had the pumpkin ravioli as my entree and it wasn't as good as I hoped, but still delicious. It was a little dry on the inside, only because they put chicken in it too. I would have rather them not and just made it a real pumpkin ravioli, but it was still pretty delicious. It was definitely something different and the garnishes they had added to the meal as well. For dessert I tried the chocolate souffle and the creme brulee cheesecake. the cheesecake is a must have! I love the carmelized top of a creme brulee so just imagine that on top of a creamy piece of cheesecake. Delectable. That alone made the entire meal. The chocolate souffle is every chocolate lovers dream. So rich, so tasty and not too sweet. Although I must say, my cousin makes a killer chocolate cake that tastes just like this. All in all, what an amazing experience. The atmosphere was perfect for a group gathering, first date, 50th date or just cause.  There is something here for everyone. From the super picky eater to the person who can't wait to eat the table, you can't go wrong. Also, the drinks are pretty damn good. I had the Raspberry Mojito and I thought I was eating candy.

We had just about everything on the menu and not one dish was a disappointment.  Water glasses were constantly being refilled by attentive waitstaff.  Nice relaxed meal with WONDERFUL desserts in the end.  Coffee is tasty but not too strong (if that's what you're into)The only downside was the female hostess.  She was not friendly, appeared to be a bit standoffish and did not even greet us when we entered.  Thank goodness for the male host!  He absolutely rocked!  We had a number of gifts in a large bag that we wanted to present to the guest of honor throughout the course of the meal and he was so accomodating.  He stashed the bag for us and even blocked the table's view while I rushed passed to get more gifts throughout the course of the meal.

Some of worst food in last few years.  Dessert, a chocolaty pot de creme w/a cream--was it a foam?--actually very good.

566,0OWW8WGBl37WtQ-pOe5r4A,Kristy T.,2.0 star rating,"My family and I were super excited to try ""Fig & Olive"". We had heard so many wonderful things about it for so long that it had been on our ""must try"" list of restaurants. Sadly, the food did not meet our expectations. First, the space and decor is very chic, but the tables were all very close together and so it felt a little cramped. I was lucky that the table next to us was empty. If it was filled, I'm sure we'd be knocking chairs all night. The service at ""Fig & Olive"" is great. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the olive oils served in the restaurant and was also pretty good with the wine. The ambience and service definitely scored better than their food. So, let's talk about the food. The crostini tasting was fun and the ingredients were all very fresh and tasty. However, the flavors were nothing out of the ordinary. My fiance ordered their burrata, tomato and pesto crostini and commented that it was just like local Italian joint. To their defense, our local Italian place is very, very, good.... but I just think there should be a distinctive difference between a fine dining restaurant and a very, very, good restaurant. No?My fiance ordered their truffle risotto and my aunt had ordered their paella. Both rice dishes were too wet. The risotto was mushy and had no bite. It was kind of like eating truffle porridge; tasty, but not a risotto. The seafood paella was undercooked and still had liquid at the bottom of the pan. We asked our waitress to bring it back and when it was brought out a second time, it was better. However, because they did not remove the seafood before putting it back on the stove, or oven, the seafood all came out overcooked. Being a fine dining restaurant, I thought they should have given her a new one all together, especially since she had only taken one or two bites out of the dish. Moreover, a good paella, or the best part of a paella is a soccarat, the toasted layer of rice at the bottom of the pan. The paella we ordered had none. There were some other flaws in our meal, such as a Bronzino with soggy skin, dry and unflavorful mash potatoes, under seasoned snow peas, and a chocolate pot de creme that was overly sweet and tasted more like a dense chocolate mousse than a creamy custard. Needless to say, I won't be going back for seconds. Their only saving grace was their truffle mushroom croquettes and their braised octopus salad. Both dishes were beautiful and delicious, but other than these two plates, we were very disappointed with the food.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

This place is a shame.We ate here because it was close to our hotel and the menu looked amazing. Don't be fooled like we were. I started with the tuna crudo, which was actually good. But it's hard to mess up simply dressed raw fish. My husband got the sea scallop and artichoke tapenade, which I immediately said sounded sketchy (isn't a tapenade usually made with olives?), and it tasted just as strange as it sounded. The sea scallops were whole, surrounded by an artichoke tapenade that had such a strong flavor I couldn't eat it. And I love artichokes! Shit is just wrong. The worst by far was my entree...spaghetti calamari. The tomato sauce was basically just black and red pepper. The calamari looked like it had bread crumbs on it at some point, but mostly ended up sitting on the pasta. The calamari was overcooked and chewy. I had about 3 bites and couldn't eat any more. My husband had the pumpkin sage ravioli and he didn't like it. The nail in the coffin for this place was that our Mexican waiter (he never introduced himself) clearly couldn't have cared less and ignored us most of the time, never asked us how our food was or if we wanted more wine.

For the appetizer we ordered the crab cake and truffle mushroom croquette. The  truffle mushroom was very fulling and yummy. The crab cake was okay, I had better ones elsewhere. For the entree we got paella de mar and primavera lobster Risotto. Both the entree was a bit salty and we didn't finish it.  Maybe because the truffle mushroom croquette filled us up! Their dishes were pretty small but it's good for me since I don't eat much. For dessert, we got brownie with ice cream on top (for my birthday). We used a deal for $99 and the tax was around $8. And you can tip them however much you want. No mandatory percentage. We gave $20 tip for the good service. Would recommend for a date night!",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

The interior is clean and sleek, the layout of the bar and restaurant is sophisticated and extremely trendy. The hostess were very stylish. I felt fierce clad in a DVF Lemon/Gray ruffle tier zipper front dress with silver platform heels. The lighting and decor is modern and simple. I loved the wine rack and oil rack from the different regions of the world. Our waitress was a complete sweetheart! Very meticulous and friendly. She gave us a run through of the menu and wine/cocktail list. I had two white sangrias (pinkish tint) with fresh fruits  and rosemary in champagne. It was fruity and sweet which catered to the occasion for our anniversary. My husband opt for water since he's not much of a drinker. The waitress brought out some olive oil samples with a bread plate. She introduced the different olive oils from around the world. Our favorite was the F&O Koroneiki from Greece (warm and rich in texture with hints of banana, green apple, bark, fig, & ripe Macedonia fruits)! We also had the F&O Chemlali from Tunisia (nutty, buttery & smooth texture), and F&O Picual from Chile (grass, green wood flavor and clean texture).For appetizers, I had the Sea Scallops & Truffle Artichoke Tapenade (seared sea scallops, truffle artichoke plated over mushroom arugula, pine nuts in aged balsamic vinegar). The sea scallops was bursting with flavors and went well with truffle artichoke which tasted more of a stuffing. My husband had the Crostinis: Crab & Lemon Cilantro Mayonnaise (highly recommended if you love crab salad), Mushroom, Artichoke, Truffle Parmesan(a bit bland in flavor), and Prosciutto, Ricotta, Fig, Olive, Walnut (sweet taste with bold walnut flavor). For our entrees, I had the Filet Mignon, medium with herb olive oil butter and choice of two sides. I chose the mixed green salad with Tomato, Scallion in Balsamic Olive Oil Dressing and Roasted Fingerling Potatoes & Shallots. My husband had Trio De La Mer which included Mediterranean branzino (glazed with fig & aged balsamic vinegar, snow peas & fig),Seared sea scallop, Artichoke truffle Tapenade (same as my appetizer except the scallop was huge) in  a mushroom - Truffle Oil, Seared salmon with grilled summer vegetable. The portions are just right (except for the Filet Mignon) if you are looking for a light dinner without feeling overstuffed.  We shared the warm caramelized apple tart with a scoop of vanilla ice cream recommended by the waitress. Secretly, I would had indulged in the Warm Chocolate Soufflé if I wasn't feeling full from all the food. Unfortunately, I didn't get to order the popular Fig & Olive Oil Gelato that was highly recommended by fellow yelpers since it was not listed on the menu. The waitress thanked us towards the end of the night. We were told to come back and visit very soon. Highly recommended for any celebrations or special occasions! *Fig & Olive was also featured in one of the episode of The City.*",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

Learned.  The crostinis are the signature here (apparently from the yelp reviews).  The best one that we had was the shrimp.  Very fresh and flavorful.The beef carpaccio was extra.ordinary.  The vingerette that was drizzled on top was the perfect amount of acidity and it was complemented very well by the sweetness of the cherry tomatoes.  Topped off with a little bitterness from the argula and I can definitely get used to eating carpaccio.Happy eating, suckers.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

For appetizers, my boyfriend loved the Fig & Olive Salad, and the Mushroom Croquettes were absolutely delicious for this mushroom obsessed fan. However, my entree was disappointing. I got the Penne Funghi Tartufo, which smelled wonderfully of truffles, but was basically swimming in olive oil. Granted, it was tasty high quality olive oil, but it was very greasy. The penne was too al dente and very chewy. For the price, I would have expected higher quality for a simple dish like pasta.

When we finally were seated, my party of three decided to try the prix fix menu that came with two courses, an alcoholic beverage and coffee for about 28$. This would have been a fantastic deal for us, had it not been for two problems.First, the time it took to get our food served was awful. We waited nearly a half an hour for our first course, and then another forty five minuets for our second course. Every time we inquired to our ""overwhelmed"" waiter we were told ""its out of my hands"".  We were finally served after we had decided that if it did not come in five minuets, we would just get a check and leave. In the time we were waiting we were not once offered a refill on our drinks. I would maybe understand this poor service if the restaurant was full, but there were only a handful of occupied tables in the whole restaurant. The second issue was the food. Portions were small all around  and my zucchini carpaccio was quite bland. The small size detracted from any value we felt with the prix fix. On a good note, I did enjoy the Sangria which had a very full taste.

Back to business- service was amazing. our lovely waitress was very personable and accommodating.  I have tried beef carpaccio and fig and olive salad which were fresh and delicious and seafood paella- with kink of spice and crunchy seafood. My cucumber cosmo was refreshing and crostini and pot de creme dessert were light and wrapped up our dinner perfectly. The only issue that I have got was that during the dinner I constantly felt being rushed despite the fact that it was a dead Monday evening and the restaurant had ample of tables available. Granted I took my time with the dinner ( all in total we spend 2 hours) since I was meeting a friend whom I haven't seen in months yet my main courses arrived while I was still nibbling on my appetizer. i completely understand that chef times the food and sometimes patrons eat slower than kitchen excepts but then bussers start coming when we were about to be done with our entrees trying to take the plates away. Finally when we were done and plates were cleared, one of them came and took our drink glasses from the table while I still had my cucumber cosmo in it.

As for the food- they have a pretty big menu, and they incorporate olive oil in pretty much all their dishes- hence the name, Fig and Olive. There is a pretty big variety suited to many different tastes- but nothing too outlandish. I noticed they had a lot of tasty sounding small plates and appetizers. However, because it was pretty late, we decided to skip the appetizers and go straight to the main course. Boring me ordered the rotisserie chicken with a side of mashed and a tossed salad. My bf had the fillet Mignon with a side of string beans. Well- the chicken was awesome! Moist and delicious, i really enjoyed it. The tossed salad was really good as well and i was lovin the string beans that my bf ordered. The mashed- ehh- a little too plain for me but my bf begged to differ. He also thoroughly enjoyed his fillet. The service was great- no complaints there, my only complaint and the reason for the 4 stars rather than 5 would be the closeness of the tables to one another.

629,CWgKEJA9x45mesEF_mrXuQ,Caitlin Z.,3.0 star rating,"3 stars solely because the food here was fantastic.  The service, however, was another story.My sister and I both live(d) and work in New York City, and have for several years.  My parents were in town visiting for the day.  We went to a show and came for an early dinner, around 6 pm (we had reservations).The hostess was friendly and showed us to a table right away.  I did notice that the white fabric covered cushions on the chairs and benches along the wall had dirty spots all over them.  I know it's hard to keep white clean, especially in a restaurant, but ewwww.  There were only about 4 other tables sat in the entire restaurant, with about another 3 or 4 parties sitting outside.  This place is huge, so it was basically empty.Then, my annoyance begins.  The busboy was very kind and attentive and rarely did we have an empty water glass.  However, I was left wanting for everything else.  We waited for about 10-15 minutes without anyone approaching us for even a drink order before I started looking around with the ""what the hell"" look.  Finally, a server comes over and says, ""so are you ready to order?""  I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt and assume that maybe she's annoyed because she thinks we're tourists?  (To be fair, my parents are.)  So I had to give her a little New York attitude and let her know!  I said, ""Um, is it possible to take our drink order first?""  She looked confused and said, ""Oh, sure.""    We waited another 5-10 minutes before our drinks came and then a different server came to take our order.  Drinks - I got the Fig & Olive Dirty Martini.  I loved it, as my normal order is an extra dirty martini, and I love salt, however it was too much for the others who tasted it.  My sister ordered the Fig & Walnut Julep.  I didn't taste it, but she said it was overly sweet with not enough bourbon for her taste.  She basically likes to drink rocket fuel though.The olive oil tasting that came with bread was very good.  One of the olive oils had a little spicy kick to it and was delish.  We ordered appetizers to share.  The 3 vegetables (fennel, artichokes, red pepers) were delicious.  We also ordered 3 crostini - manchego & fig, prosciutto, ricotta, olive & fig, and tuna & hummus.  However, the server got the order wrong and we got the shrimp & avocado instead.  A little annoying, but it was yummy so all was forgiven.  For dinner, I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass.  It was cooked perfectly, and was accompanied by asparagus, mashed potatoes and a cream sauce that was not too rich.  The food was just delicious, and was just enough.  All of the dinners received rave reviews.  My sister had the lobster risotto, my mom had the chicken tajine which comes with a generous side of couscous, and my dad had the branzino.  Another service complaint - my sister and I had both finished our drinks before our meals came and were never asked if we wanted another.  Our server didn't even show up again until we were almost halfway through dinner.  What if one of our dishes had been wrong?  Also - don't restaurants make money off of selling alcohol?  Could have fooled me because we managed to each get one glass of wine after having to flag down our server.Lastly, we ordered the dessert taste and share sampler.  It was just enough to get a little bite of the four desserts - and left me wishing I had ordered the shortbread because the little morsel I had was so delicious.  My dad and I both ordered port and were instead given Lambrusco aka bubbling sweet grape juice.  Honestly, the server was nice, not rude at all, but the service overall was just terrible.  I mean it's not the most upscale restaurant ever, but the prices certainly don't scream T.G.I. Friday's, although the service did.  I have been to the location on 5th avenue before and never had a problem with service.  I would definitely return to Fig & Olive because the food was amazing, however, I most likely wouldn't return to this location.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

The place is huge, the service was incredible, and the food and drink tasty.We shared 3 crostini, the olives, the tart, and the zucchini carpaccio, and we both had the Rosselini cocktails and loved everything, along with the complimentary foccacia and olive oil to start.  Of course the neighborhood is fantastic as well. Popped back in for a late lunch a few days later, and the service was meh. By the time we got there, the things we wanted from the menu were sold out.  Including the bread and oil that you get when you first sit down. Bummer. I was really looking forward to sampling those oils again.  We ended up sharing the zucchini carpaccio (yes, I loved it that much), and I got a salad, and the Mr got a panini.

640,uTu0Uh3qj27ZMIP8xwf9VA,Jason K.,1.0 star rating,"Worst front desk customer service experience in recent history. we had made a dinner reservation for 9:15pm on a Saturday night. The check-in area is located in a small vestibule just inside the front door, which would be okay but for the crowd of other table-seekers squeezing in as well as the crowded coat-check area which is in the same place.  The hosts were neither friendly nor rude, they just seemed numb to external stimuli, perhaps from the loud loud club music that fills the place. They also have a sales area in the front where they sell olive oil and spices in attractive bottles. During the endless wait, I noticed that the expiration dates on the olive oil bottles all stated that the oil was best consumed by 2007...The food smells wafting over were admittedly somewhat pleasant, but a table was not in the cards. after an hour of waiting, repeatedly being told that we ""are next"", we gave up and went down the block to Spice Market where we were seated immediately and had a perfect meal. Overall impression, other than the poor control of customer experience, is that the place is an amped up version of an ""Olive Garden"" chain restaurant, but likely with better food, not an intimate Mediterranean restaurant with a crafted culinary experience. this place is a venture - capital fed food enterprise, albeit one which is tuned with solely cash flow in mind.

642,zQzX_kBJkbHjBbBjJiRayw,Nina D.,3.0 star rating,"I came here for restaurant week with a few girlfriends. We had reservations on a Thursday night and it was PACKED. We showed up on time but still had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated while literally every person that showed up after us got seated first. 10 minutes isn't a long time to wait, but it was annoying to stand next to the pretentious hostesses who acted like we either didn't exist or were bothering them by standing in their presence.The food was intense. I started off with 3 crostinis. Manchego, proscuitto and copa. The copa was the best of the three with a surprising sweetness. The beef carpaccio was okay but was overpowered by the truffle oil. I had the trio de la mar bouillabaisse for my entree. It was very good, but the portion was extremely small and the huge chunks of fennel were easily mistaken for the fish. The chocolate pot de creme was chocolate overload. Anyone who likes rich, creamy chocolate is in for a big treat. The sangria was good.I say the food is intense because all of the flavors are really in your face. The oils that are incorporated into the meal sort of overshadow everything else. I literally tasted the white truffle oil from the beef carpaccio for days. That wasn't exactly how I would like to remember a meal. If it wasn't for the crostini add-on to our prix fixe menu, I would have left utterly disappointed. Those little crostini's definitely added a star to this review. The only way I'm coming back is if I go to the F&O in Westchester (less douchebags) to get a bunch of crostinis because they're the only things not drenched in oil. I really wanted to buy the candle that was in the bathroom because it smelled incredible and they sell it at the front with the rest of their oils. I changed my mind pretty quickly when I saw that it was $28 for a small candle and that I would have to deal with the hostesses again if I got it.

We were sat down immediately when our full party of 4 came to the restaurant. The environment was very trendy and intimate, it was dim and brought on a relaxed vibe at the same time. When we sat down we get the restaurant week menu which was a choice of 1 app, 1 entree, and 1 dessert for $38 (without tip and tax). We all started with a glass of wine, they have a pretty vast amount of wines from the bottle to choose from and a few by glass. The waiter came to the table with some warm pieces of bread and 3 different olive oils to choose from for the dip. I started with the truffle mushroom croquette, which was delicious. It was soft on the inside with the potato and mushroom filling, and crunchy from with the deep fry  on the outside with the truffle creme sauce under. For the entree I got the chicken tajine that came with a side of couscous. The entree came with 3 fairly large pieces of chicken in the sauce with apricot, cucumber, and carrots. In the end I chose the chocolate pot de creme. When I first saw, it was just in plain white cup. It had a very dense texture when I dug into it with a spoon. It tasted delicious like a chocolate mouse with a milky whipped creme topping. Overall I enjoyed my experience at Fig & Olive. The waiter was polite and nice, the food was good. I however wish I didn't have to pay almost 60$ for a meal but it was mostly for the theme and food.

I went here with my family for a joint birthday celebration and they were very accommodating with our table, even adding an extra seat last minute. We ordered almost all of the crostinis, a cheese platter with all 5 cheeses, and the mixed olives to start. They were all fantastic. For dinner we had the paella del mar, the tajine, the branzino, the rosemary lamb chops, and the penne funghi tartufo. Everything was absolutely incredible. Personally, i'm not a fan of paella because it's a little too fishy for me, but I have to say the paella here is phenomenal. The added saffron really makes a difference. I'm also very sensitive to the gamey taste of lamb, but the lamb here was perfect. Not gamey at all and very nicely seasoned.    For dessert we had the warm chocolate soufflé, the chocolate pot de creme, and the mixed berries crostata. The pot de creme was great, very smooth in texture and chocolatey in taste with a nice layer of vanilla on top. The chocolate soufflé was okay, but if you're not a fan of orange and chocolate i wouldn't get it. The waiter promised us we wouldn't even notice the taste, but it was definitely noticeable. The mixed berries crostata is for anyone who wants a healthy dessert. It's literally a mix of berries in the filo dough crostata shell with a little bit of vanilla mascarpone at the very bottom.  I highly recommend this place for a date night or any special event.

These are a few things I tried today...Shrimp Ceviche - refreshing and tangy, not bad. Yellow Fin Tuna Carpaccio - light and simple. Mediterranean Chicken Samosa - amazing!

This was the best part of the meal.  I especially recommend the mushroom and burrata crostinis they were both extremely flavorful and made of the freshest ingredients.  They also brought out foccacia bread with 3 olive oils as a starter.  This was a nice touch but would have been much better if they brought this out when we were first seated instead of when we were pretty much done w the crostinis.I was very disappointed by my main dish - I ordered the branzino which came with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.  My mashed potatoes were completely cold - like they had been made and scooped onto the plate hours ago.  The fish was okay but it was disappointing as well - lacked flavor, tasted fried and was tiny (like they served me only a quarter of the fish).  My bf got the steak and he said it was pretty good but agreed that his mashed potatoes were cold as well.  Our friend got the spaghetti calamari and thankfully he enjoyed that dish.We finished the meal with the tasting and sharing plate; we selected the chocolate pot de creme, the apple sorbet, crunchy praline and a strawberry crostini.  I was impressed with the desserts, all four were really good.  Warning:  each dessert you get is ""bite sized"" so this would be better to order if you are on a date (not the best suited dish for 3 people). I don't think I will come back here since my main dish was so disappointing.  It's a shame because the crostini, olive oil tasting, cheese and desserts were very good...",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

As for the food -- mediocre. Crostinis are great. We mixed-and-matched to try the truffle, manchego, and roasted bell pepper crostinis, and they were all delicious. As a main course, I had the penne funghi tartufo with grilled chicken. It was good, but it didn't taste any different from a pasta dish from the Cheesecake Factory (and I  LOVE the Cheesecake Factory).My friend absolutely swears by their Chilean sea bass, which I didn't get to try, but would if I'm to return a second time.For sides, we split the mashed potatoes and gnocchi, neither anything out of the ordinary. Gnocchi was on the harder side (I prefer them soft and creamy).For dessert, we had the chocolate cake, or souffle? Whatever it was, it was rich, but again, nothing spectacular.As for the service, it was difficult to find our waiter who kept disappearing.I'd only come here to entertain guests in the MPD area for dinner.

674,3Ss0XRdFyRgKLnOdnfJDAg,Nancy S.,3.0 star rating,"Fig & Olive - Fab ambiance (large, warehouse space with ""earthy"" tones and decor), amazing cocktails, food.. was subpar.I believe that this was a prime example of how food quality deteriorates when it comes to restaurant week. I was very excited to try this restaurant out after hearing good reviews from friends and it being a ""trendy"" restaurant and all. I got there relatively earlier than my friends so I decided to have a drink at the bar. I tried the Summer in Provence (on the recommendation of a good gin cocktail from the bartender) and it was amazing, rosemary thyme soaked in it with real blackberries on the bottom! Great cocktails always put me in a good mood so I was ready for my dinner to be fantastic!We decided to start off with a choice of 6 crostinis for 13$ and chose a various number of them. Our waitress (service was wonderful!) quickly brought over a selection of 3 olive oils and some bread which was fantastic. The crostinis came out and the 5 of us each got a little bite of each of them. Let me tell you, the crostinis were the highlight of the meal!! They were all delicious and filled with different assortments of flavor--my favorite two were the Mushroom, Truffle Artichoke and Parmesean and the Prosciutto, Fig, Ricotta, and Walnut ones.I got the tuna carpaccio for an appetizer while others at my table got the beef and mushroom & truffle soup. The Tuna carpaccio came out very thinly sliced topped with almonds, arugula, and sesame oil. It was very good, very nutty. A small taste of the other two entrees gave me nothing to really write about here...Then came the entrees. I ordered the Bouillabaisse and was really looking forward to it. It sounded delicious and I usually love sea bass! The first bite was good, then as I got to half full I started slowly resenting the dish. It was way too fishy, the flavor of the sea bass and the scallop (one) wasn't anything to write home about and, not to be too harsh but I started to feel like I was drinking a can of hearty progresso soup. Don't get me wrong, I love progresso soups, but I just wasn't expecting it to be on my plate at a restaurant in Meatpacking (or should I be..)The other members of my party got the Fig & Olive Tajine which, from a couple bites, was tasty. I enjoyed the couscous. But after a while my friends, too, shared my desire to.. stop eating. None of us finished our entrees completely and I found myself regretting not ordering something else.The desserts were tasty. The shortbread cookies were good on the dessert ""crostini"" and the cherries and mascarpone were perfect to get rid of that fishy taste in my mouth. I didn't try it, but from my friends' reactions it seemed that the chocolate pot de creme was actually very delicious.Hopefully, I'll come back to Fig & Olive in the future and edit this review to be better. I'm hoping that the food quality was just because it was restaurant week because the Crostinis were amazing compared to our actual dishes.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

677,2df45Qtpxqqv-04GcNaftA,Matt L.,2.0 star rating,"Dining at Fig & Olive is very difficult. Meatpacking district is always a bit busy and packed, but not all restaurants have such a hard time managing their customers as Fig & Olive does. The atmosphere is great on the first glance and things start rather nicely, until it hits around 8PM where the restaurant is completely full with a insufficient number of waiters/staff working to meet the demands of the customers. The music is so loud that we literally have to scream to talk to one another. Most of our dishes were cold and felt like they were pre-made and served whenever the staff can manage. In fact, Ravioli was cold and it took us 15 minutes to even locate our waiter who took the dish out and brought it back 30 minutes later when all of us were finished with our individual dishes. Then we worked another 15 to get our desserts until we had to give up and leave. And getting the check was the worst part. I literally had to get up and find our waiter to ring us up and I had to sign the check as I was standing next to the cashier. I have known this about this location for sometime now until I had to go out for dinner yesterday with clients and am thus forced to write this. Every other Fig & Olive location were decent, but this particular branch is overwhelmingly horrible in its services. One might say that all restaurants in Meatpacking district are similar in its problems, but I would say Fig & Olive would be ranked worst among them. I suggest you reconsider dining at a different location that serves the same dishes with better service.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

Much to our surprise, we found a Groupon for two people at a price of $70, which included three crostini, one appetizer to share, two entrées up to about $38 each, and two alcoholic drinks valued at $14 apiece. Needless to say, it was a pretty terrific Groupon, with no real restrictions, other than only being valid from Sunday through Thursday. For our choice of crostini, we decided to go with the Shrimp and Avocado, the Manchego, Fig and Prosciutto, and the Parmesan and Burrata with Arugulla. They were all super good, and frankly, since they were by no means large, I truly wish we had not needed to share. I could have eaten them all, without a problem!  After the three crostini, we then had the Fig and Gorgonzola Tartlet, and, although it was not exactly my fave, it was actually quite big to share, and both my husband and daughter completely finished it. We were also given some very tasty bread and dipping oil for the table. As for our drinks, I went with a wonderful glass of Chardonnay for $13, while our daughter and my husband leisurely sipped on a cocktail made with sparkling white wine and strawberries for $15. There are not enough words to really describe just how delicious our main meals turned out to be. Holy cow! Every single dish, from the fish, to the risotto, to mine which was the Moroccan Chicken were full of flavor and of decent portion size. In fact, none of us could finish our dinner. Next time, we will definitely save room for dessert. With regard to service, our waiter was incredibly professional, yet warm and friendly. For example, he quickly realized that I am totally blind, even though most people tend to be taken aback when they finally figure it out, and consequently, from that point on, he would casually explain where each of my foods and drink were positioned in front of me. However, his approach was not at all condescending or intrusively helpful. The restaurant is upscale and well decorated, and a pretty nice place to bring family and friends when celebrating. Without a doubt, we will recommend to everybody, and return to try other menu items that seem interesting.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

They were very accommodating as to the fact that our show got out much later than we'd planned, and said it wasn't a problem to push the reservation until we got there. When we arrived, they were ready to seat us, and although the restaurant was mostly empty, they tried squeezing our group  of 5 next to two other large groups. Granted, we did want a round table so we could more easily talk to each other, but there were plenty of tables available. They said they'd have to figure something out for us, so we went to the bar to wait. In the 15 minutes that we were standing at the bar, the bartender only made one drink for us - a Cosmo. I don't know/understand what could have taken so long. And when he finished that one drink, he walked away, and we couldn't get his attention again even though we tried. Again, this place was NOT crowded, and if there's only one bartender, he should be able to easily accommodate a group of 5 in all that time (with pretty basic drink orders).Once we were seated at our table, no one came over to take our drink orders, which we'd been waiting for since the bar. We finally flagged down the maitre d. When the rest of our drinks finally came, the Cosmos had been made differently than the one made at the bar, and they forgot olives in my friend's martini where he specifically requested them. I know it's #firstworldproblems, but this is a pretty pricey place, and you would just expect more. While looking at our menus, the lights in the place suddenly dimmed dramatically, which was not pleasant for those of us who need light to be able to read. We placed our order, and although they never brought one of the appetizers we ordered, and were out of what my dad wanted at 6:30pm... the food was overall really tasty - though I don't get why there's truffle oil in everything because it's pretty overwhelming of any other flavors. I personally don't think the experience as a whole- or even the tasty food - was worth the prices, because the service was all around terrible. We were pretty good-natured because we were happy to be celebrating together, but it was embarrassing that we'd picked this place for the birthday girl and she couldn't even get what she wanted. A place like this should have been run much more smoothly.

Paella: Fine, standard.Deserts:Forget the names, but we got both of the options.  I'm not a huge desert guy but I very much enjoyed both of these.  *I see a number of gripes here about the portion size.  I always factor in portion size and I was pleased with it.  Plenty of food and I left quite full.Nice time, but probably won't go back because the prices on the regular menu are pretty outrageous for rather normal food.  But I'm glad I came though to say I experienced it and we had a good time.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

The jazz music the restaurant played was horrible (and too loud) in that all that was audible was this obnoxious pounding base and the faint sound of some musician talking his lyrics but very muffled. It sounded like AM radio with bad reception or the kind of noise pollution you would hear through a wall and complain to your landlord about. I do love the soups (among other things) at F&O so it's hard for me to pass those up. That being said, I have much better memories of the place from a few years ago where I had a great dinners or brunches here and there with my girlfriends at this location. Sadly, as with most things and definitely in the case of NYC, things change. This place has become much more touristy and annoyingly trendy (always a risk when considering Meatpacking establishments) and the wait staff seem to for the most part be blasé. At a recent brunch here, we ordered the crostini (which is always good) along with soups as our appetizers and then main courses to follow. The soups came out five seconds after the crostini platter came so we sat there eating the crostini platter with our soups getting cold just sitting on the side at our table (the croutons in the soup also got soggy as this happened). The waitress seemed oblivious. You would think that a restaurant that is used to having its customers order their infamous crostini plates would be accustomed to the timing of bringing out courses...When my fiancé asked for ketchup and mustard once the entrées came, the waitress said she would get them and be right back. We didn't see her for awhile and then she seemed to remember and brought the ketchup over. Once we realized she forgot the mustard, the next time she came back, we asked if we could also have mustard. She acted like this was the first time we asked for mustard and told us that F&O doesn't have mustard. Um.. okay. I just love babysitting waitresses and chasing them down while I'm trying to have a relaxing Saturday brunch after a long week! Also, I'm sorry to say this but you'll notice a majority of the glowing reviews are from tourists or people who are not from NYC. Sadly, this F&O location is closer to me and within walking distance of where I live but if you can, I recommend the 5th Ave location well over this one. It feels like a much more ""adult"" restaurant and the people who work there do too. For $100 for brunch for two people, there are better options out there.

Ok, seemed odd enough that they would be able to find us in that sort of crowd, but whatever, we needed drinks.30 minutes went by, no word from anyone, so we went on up to the hostess stand to see what the hold up was. The hostess then began to show me a list on her computer screen of about 20 tables that she needed to seat before she could seat us. Okkk...interesting that no one bothered to tell us that as soon as we walked in the place. Real nice of them to have us go buy $40 martinis and ""forget"" to mention that we won't be seated til next Tuesday.

A great waiter always adds to a experience. Good food, wine, table. Great Friends. Paella, which is not usually my choice because I don't like to get stuffed with fillers like rice.

I did bring a sippy cup for the littlest so it was fine but if they have a kid's menu- they might as well have those cups too.

We started the evening with two glasses of sparkling Giulio Ferrari. I chose the gazpacho soup which was truly excellent. A side of bruschetta completed the dish. As the main dish, seafood paella was well made, with generous portions of scallops. Lemon sole was interestingly made and served wrapped in a paper, which the server had to expertly open on my table. Although it was a nice touch, I found the paper to be somewhat annoying. The dessert crostini is a winner and I highly recommend it.

Luckily (and oddly enough) they sat us immediately after telling us it would be a 25min wait.. I was excited to come here, loved the atmosphere and the menu looked amazing! I am typically a seafood fanatic so the trio de la mer would be my definite choice but I had been craving chicken for some reason so I opted for the grilled truffle chicken dish since there were no substitutions allowed on the trios. Also had the waitress choose a glass of pinot noir, it was good but not remarkable. I hate to admit that I've ever been to a TGI Friday's but I would have to in order to compare the dish I was served. The chicken breast seemed to have come out of the freezer before being pounded and flattened to death and then overcooked. The 'mashed potatoes' were cold, stiff and over seasoned. The leeks were soaked to death in oil (and I'm just not the biggest fan of leeks anyway). As hungry as I was I did not enjoy the meal at all. My friends each started with the crostini and only mentioned the mushroom crostini as being really great, they then had salads and one friend had one of the jamon dishes.

I'm a big fan of this place, although it's location in the meatpacking district is slightly tedious to park in or around (I know, I know -- CLEARLY I'm an LA girl, not NYC)I loved the wall covered in little potted olive tree plants, and on the Sunday brunch I was there for, there was a great jazz trio playing (a little loudly, but hey- it's live music) the entire time! We had a reservation, and I was a little worried because I knew half of our party was running about 30 minutes late. Not to worry; they were totally chill and seated the first half as soon as we got in, prepped us with menus and drinks (try the Rossellini -- it is pure heaven. Passionfruit vodka and pureed blood orange) and then left us alone until the rest of our party arrived. Sooo not what I'm used to from restaurants! Food was yummy; most of our party had the 3-course (insanely well priced) menu, with offered a lot of choices for it being Restaurant Week! I sampled some of all of the food, and everything was super yummy and yet simple, like the penne tossed in oil with mushrooms, and the filet mignon, and the rack of lamb.

714,hhZSmSKrx4CNgn9vG_c-6g,Rosa C.,5.0 star rating,"What a gem!! I've always wanted to dine here but since it's all the way deep in meatpacking I rarely get the chance to. Fortunately enough a friend of mine was offered complimentary sparking wine and crostini sampler so we decided to go. When entering the establishment - my first impression is that unlike many of the restaurants in meatpacking it is by far one of the least gaudy and pretentious places I have ever been. I graciously gave coat check my jacket and was lead to the table my friend was waiting. Second impression - the decor is simplistic but elegant. With the shelves full of olive oil it speaks to the nature of the restaurant and suits its name perfectly. A few minutes after we sat down we were offered our complimentary bread and olive oil, a glass of rose each and a selection of crostinis. Where do I begin?!?! The complimentary bread was okay - do not eat too much as it will fill you up before the main course begins! The glass of rose was great. It served as a light start to the evening before delving in into the different crostini options Fig & Olive had to offer. They served 6 different crostinis: mushroom, manchego, shrimp, salmon, proscuitto and beet. My favorite was definitely the proscuitto. Some may say that it is bland and not really flavor enlightening but there is something about the salty sweet combination that I love oh so dearly. The semi salty slice of proscuitto with the sweet fig and ricotta cheese was such a great combination - one could eat a million of those and die happy. The mushroom is my 2nd favorite but I wished it was served warm as oppose to cold. The parmesan and scallion lend a lot to help flavor the mushroom crostini. My third favorite would be the beet with orange. Beets have never been a tasty vegetable but with pared with the citrus orange it offers a pop of flavor that is strangely welcomed. The rest of the crostinis are just as great. There's something about each of the combinations that makes you keep coming back for more. HOWEVER I don't know if I would pay the hefty price for some crostinis (3 for $33 or 6 for $20). Since they were offering RW I opted for the RW menu while my friend ordered an entree. She ordered the truffle risotto - which was okay. Not too sure if I would pay $25 for rice, mushroom and truffle oil. It was good - a tad too much truffle oil for my liking but the risotto was cooked perfectly and the flavorings were well infused. I ordered the beef carpaccio, paella de mar and the chocolate pot de creme. The beef carpaccio is definitely well worth it. The beef were sliced every so thinly as though it would melt on your mouth with parmesan cheese and balsamic vinegar. I felt they had put too much parmesan but the balsamic vinegar was the right accompaniment. The acidity from the balsamic helps to counter the cheesey parmesan. The paella was okay. The presentation was beautiful but the rice left much to be desired. One of the highlights of the evening was definitely the dessert. The chocolate pot de creme was like a thicker version of a chocolate mousse. The frothy vanilla cream and presentation made reminiscent of a cappuccino.  The chocolate was not too overly chocolately but definitely sweet enough as a dessert. The praline financier was the perfect accompaniment to the dessert. It was a bit smaller than expected but it was delicious. It had the crunchy nuttiness with a faint sweetness. Another highlight of our dinner was the attentiveness of our server. One of the things I appreciate the most is when the waitstaff takes the time to describe what is on our plate and doesn't rush us. For example when we received our plate of crostinis our server told us what each crostini was. She didn't rush us and was so helpful. I also loved how the manager had come by our table to thank my friend for visiting the restaurant again. I think it's so great that they reached out and offered complimentary wine and crostinis as a 2nd visit. If only more restaurants took that initiative. If I get the same offer as my friend did I would love to come back and try their other entrees. I may also want to try their other locations as well. ~happy eatings!",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

Food was yummy, but overall I'm not terribly satisfied.First of all, overpriced! I mean, if I paid like half of what I actually paid, this place would've gotten at least 4 stars. The decor was pretty and the service was decent but there wasn't anything that really stood out to me about the place. I think it's pretty heavily franchised too, like internationally, so I guess that's why it didn't feel too special. Everything was just...alright. And expensive. Okay now onto the food. Here are the things I've tried on their prix fixe menus (can't remember the exact names of the dishes sorry!). Appetizers: samosas, zucchini Main courses: penne with mushrooms and truffle oil, seafood paella Desserts: chocolate pot de creme, pastry with ice creamI don't recommend the samosas, I've had much better. Zucchini was interesting and a nice light appetizer, but I probably wouldn't get it again. I personally liked the pasta a lot, but then again I'm a huge fan of mushrooms and a huger fan of truffle oil. Paella was alright, pretty good, quite filling - scallops made it slightly more value-for-money. Both desserts were pretty good. The chocolate pot de creme was quite delightful but only initially; it is very sweet and there is definitely a limit to the amount of its thick creaminess I can handle. The pastry and ice cream was good, but I've nothing else to say about it. So yeah, all in all - decent service, ambience suitable for conversation, good-ish but overpriced food.

I checked in and one member of our party hadn't arrived. We were told to wait at the bar and we would be seated when she arrived. Not two minutes later she arrived, and I went back to inform the hostess our whole party was there, who snapped at me to go back to the bar. Thirty minutes later we had still not been seated. My friend went over to ask about the status of our table, and the hostess informed her she hadn't checked us in as a completed party. What?!

No mention of family style, which is something that should have been mentioned since many people in the group have various food preferences. Portions are small (smaller than usual menu portions), so what happens is that there is not enough food for everyone. Desert was the worst, they brought out 2 varieties of deserts, 16 in total. One of the deserts was served in   tiny cups (chocolate soufflé), so definitely not something to be shared. So basically some people got soufflé and some people did not. Not to mention service was awful, the bus boy kept clearing plates and deserts BEFORE guests had a chance to finish. I saw him taking away un-touched deserts. Coffee/tea was not served at all, only after we had to ask numerous times, and after the desert was served.

Eggplant with Tomato, Basil, Thyme - The seasoning was not as pronounced as one might think.  A little bit disappointing.Salmon ceviche - The components of the ceviche were balanced.  The salmon (which is typically a very flavorful fish) was very mild.  It probably would have been much tastier with wild salmon. Chicken samosa - Surprisingly good, and I loathe chicken!  The flaky pastry encasing the chicken was delicious.Vegetable and Burrata platter - Not the best burrata there is, but the plate definitely has all things Mediterranean covered: piquillo peppers, olives, burrata cheese, and tomato.All of this food had to be washed down with wine.  My Rioja was decent once it had time to breathe.  The wine list has some solid wines from France, Italy, and Spain.Dessert was also a life decision.  After narrowing down the options, we opted for the apple tart.  The entire tart is paper thin - it is a razor-thin layer of pastry with slices of apple laid across the top.  A scoop of vanilla ice cream topped the tart itself.  The dessert was delicious and very appropriate for autumn.Overall, the meal was very enjoyable.  Was anything astounding or life-changing.  Not really.  But if the craving for Mediterranean small plates strikes, Fig and Olive provides a variety of options to satiate.3.5 stars.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

(BTW, of the 5 of us in our party, everyone but me had been to this or another Fig and Olive before and had wonderful things to say about it.) Where to begin?? We waited half an hour for water and an hour for a cup of coffee and a glass of wine. We were told they were out of bread, then that bread was $9 a basket, then a plate with four slices of dried baguette appeared on the table. The restaurant was very understaffed and the waiter was harried, stressed, condescending, and downright bitchy. When we asked about the MIA coffee he replied, ""There are 20 tickets ahead of yours, what do you want me to do??""

We asked about an appetizer that never showed up (as we were finishing our main meals): ""Did you want me to go check on it? Are you sure you ordered it with me? Well it was on the list I turned in..."" At one point things got quite heated and my 78-year old father gently touched his arm to try and talk down the situation...he jerked away and snarled, ""Sir, please do not touch me."" Finally, just as we were resolved to walk out, our food was delivered. No surprise, it was very uninspired. At different times during our visit we spoke to two different managers. One was not helpful (""Yes, I understand."") and the other (a woman, Terry - ?) was awesome. She comped us our entire meal and we left without tipping the bitchy waiter (we tipped the two wonderful bus boys $10 each). This is something none of us had ever done, but we felt 100% justified in doing so. And it wasn't only chaotic in the front of the house, on the way to the bathroom you could see under the curtain into the kitchen, where there was food and dishes cluttering the floor. My brother heard some poor kitchen staff lamenting loudly ""Never in my life! Never in my life!"" They were obviously having some serious staffing and management issues, but they should have shut their doors, not continued to let people into such a chaotic situation where a negative experience was guaranteed! And if the waiter had had a good attitude, we would have been very understanding. I hope they get it together, but we won't be going back anytime soon!

We had to ask for bread at the beginning of the meal because the waiter had forgotten to bring us some. The mushroom soup was good and light but lacked the ""scrumptious-ness"" that I expected. Texture-wise it was off as well, and the pieces of mushroom varied like it had not been properly blended. The beef carpaccio was good and the zuchini carpacio was slightly odd. The pumpkin ravioli was tasty but the texture didnt blow me away -  though the pasta itself was quite good. All desserts were good. The service was pretty good/as expected - except for the forgotten bread. The atmosphere is great - the ceilings are high, the people are attractive, it's fun.

We visited on a Fri evening and it was apparent that they were looking to turn the table over a half dozen times that night. They asked us 3 times whether we were done with our appetizers. The waitstaff also bumped into my chair a dozen times and not once did any one say excuse me. Bread was served with a trio of olive oils which was a nice touch, except our waiter could only explain them to us as light, medium, full. Really? Your whole restaurant is based on the quality of olive oils and that's all you can tell me? Thanks! These are all tell-tale symptoms of poor management and training.Food: Unremarkable in terms of creativity but proficiently prepared. Scallop appetizer was nice but the tomatoes that came with our crostini were watery. The branzino was delicate and the filet was tender, though neither were ""amazing"". Drinks were excellent though and were clearly the standout here.Value: The problem here comes down to value. For about $10 more person, you could get stellar service, creativity and a meal worth remembering from a countless number of restos in NYC (see a certain Chef Marc Forgione).

I just don't have the heart to bump it up to a 4.Went with a friend to Meatpacking branch (pun!) for a fun night out. I'm usually more into low key places, so the atmosphere wasn't quite my style, but I certainly won't fault them for that.We started with some mixed olives (obv) and a few crostini. The olives were great, although I've had more interesting flavors elsewhere. The crostini were winners, for sure.For the main course, I went with the trio de la mer. Although the scallop was fantastic--perfectly cooked, great texture, explosion of flavors and white truffle olive oil--the remaining two pieces de la mer were a little disappointing. The salmon was overcooked and the branzino was bland.We finished with the chocolate pot de creme, which was a saving grace of the meal.

Being from Sweden and enjoying restaurants in our historical buildings in Stockholm, this is one of those places I just knew would be a favorite just as I walked in. The setting is beautiful. High ceilings, great bar, nice interior (the olive oil bottles on the shelves), good looking people and lovely atmosphere. Sure, the noise is rather high in the evenings, especially on Fridays and Saturdays when I have been there. So If you are sensitive to sounds I do not recommend visiting late on weekends - because you might have trouble hearing what your friends at the table are saying and the waiter when you order. But hey.. you are in New York. If you want silence there are other places to go to! I am not sure if they have the same house-DJ all the time, or if he just plays on the weekends. But the music was so good when we were there last summer. RnB at its best! Really nice being at a restaurant with their own DJ, instead of recorded music. It makes the bar area more fun as well. Sometimes you are placed there for a while if you are waiting for your table and that s not too bad :) The only negative criticism I can give is that the waiters sometimes felt stressed and that there is less personal attention than the more intimate dining places I have been to in Soho/West Village. But it's probably also hard to get that commitment at a popular spot in the Meatpacking District that can accommodate so many guests simultaneously.All I can say it that I enjoyed hanging out in the bar with nice waiters and great DJ, and I had a great experience when seated in the restaurant as well. I especially liked the Fig & Olive Salad (addictive) and I'm looking forward to go back this Spring to try more things on the menu! Actually next week!

We went on a Friday night and it was early so honestly, the place wasn't SLAMMED and there was no excuse for the service and food we received.It started off nice enough - it was also clear that our server was in training. She kept referring to the male server who was overseeing her. We got for the table:1. mushroom croquettes in a truffle sauce - delicious! Bite sized fried balls with a decadent cream truffle sauce. Would get this again and highlight of the night.2. Zucchini crudo - my husband said I make a better one at home. It's just sliced zucchini laid on a plate, drizzled with lemon juice and olive oil, shaved parmesan and pine nuts. Nothing crazy.3. The bruschetta tasting of 3. They were tasty enough.My husband got a glass of wine with his lamb chops. I got the chilean sea bass and my mom got the seafood paella. Let me start by saying, my husband and I dine out ALOT and we dont' balk at crazy NYC restaurant prices. I'm saying this to let you know, we have alot to compare to.Each plate was around $30 bucks with his lamb chops at $40.  My mom's paella was gummy and oversalted. My chilean sea bass was WAY overwhelmed by the flavors of cumin and accompanied by rubbery heirloom carrots. My husband (who requested medium rare lamb chops) got very rare lamb chops. He requested they cook it a bit more and it was sent back. It arrived again slopped onto a plate with the chops charred to black outside. He ate it but was not pleased. During this time not ONCE did our server come back. If we needed a fork or to resend his main course back, we had to hail someone down each time. He would have had another glass of wine if someone had asked but no one came by. She finally shows up at the end of the meal to offer dessert - still no offer to fill his glass. Service was not good. The manager did comp us the lamp chops and that was nice but the food was so subpar and accompanied by terrible service we will NEVER return.The place was full when we left so maybe it's still trendy with out of towners and those looking to go out in the meatpacking district but that's it for us.

Well by the time we ordered, we ordered drinks, appetizers and the main meal all at once because our waiter took about 35/40 min to get to our table. Drinks took forever to make and were warm when they arrived to us. Must have been sitting at the bar for a while. We ordered multiple crostinis for our table of 6. They were decent and arrived a couple minutes after our drinks. I have to admit the Borotta was delicious. We probably got our food at 1130ish and the waiter announced it was last call. Last call at 1130 on a Saturday night?? How does that happen? Anyways the food was great besides the terrible service from both the waiter and the hostess. Expect to spend a lot of money. It's NYC.

If we would not have noticed, the combined tip would have been well over 30%. An honest mistake on the restaurants part and their systems - or a deliberate attempt? You are having a good time, enjoying the meal, having a few drinks - and don't notice. We gave the server a 20% tip on the combined bill - but left wondering whether something was going on, with the 'suggested' tip amounts well in excess of the actual charge amount.

The space is very nice, spacious--similar to a lot of spaces in meat packing. I think it is a great place for a girls night out. The server was very friendly and attentive. A few of my favorites are the mushroom crositinis, the mushroom truffle croquettes, the scallop appetizer and the Chilean sea bass. For dessert, I really like the chocolate pot de creme. I overall think they do a better job on sea food rather than meats like chicken and veal (I had the chicken tangine and also the veal milanese).

The only dish I didn't care for was the mushrooms in wine that came as the side dish - the taste was too strong - and the bread they serve in the beginning is somewhat dry and just ok, but other than that, everything was very good. The seats are comfortable, the service excellent, the portion size right on target (not too large and not too small). The men's bathroom is in dire need of a revamping, but other than that everything in this place works like a clock. However, I don't think I'll be returning any time soon, because I didn't care for the modern/impersonal/chic vibe/atmosphere of the place. The ceilings are very high and the decor is very modern. It lacks intimacy, or fun, or something that will draw you in. If the same exact food and service were in an intimate setting, I'd be a fan and return. But the current setup just doesn't do it for me.

The one thing I did like was their beautiful display of cooking oils for purchase at the front of the restaurant (all over priced but a nice display to look at ). Lets get started with the menu..........................Appetizers:Salmon & Dill Avocado Tartar -$6Shallot, Lemon, Olive Oil - Salmon was fresh but they over powered it with dillFIG GORGONZOLA TARTLET - $14melted gorgonzola, prosciutto, fig, walnut arugula, tomato,on a fine puff pastry-The tartlet was Ok .  It was over powered with gorgonzola so it was hard to taste the tomatoes, fig or prosciutto .  I also want to share that they were not fresh figs, they were dried (A pure disappointment considering the price and the fact that figs are in season!

We had wine which was great, and worked through a series of the ceviches, crostinis, and appetizers as well as desert which, without entrees even, proved to be pretty filling for two. The food was good, not the best tartares or Mediterranean inspired fare I've had - but towards the top of the list I would say.It was a tad pricey, but what we expected.

Its minimalistic decor is impeccable and the service is top notch. It is a truly pleasant dining experience. Now for more details on the food...The menu is huge, especially for what I've come to expect at lunch. It encourages you to share a bunch of apps, tapas, meats, cheeses, olives, bruschettas, etc. You name it, they've got it. So we went for the Jamon Iberico - always a crowd pleaser, and the Tuscan Salad - which is a mix of prosciutto, marinated artichokes, eggplant tapenade, kalamata olive spread, and some kind of ricotta spread - pesto perhaps - all SO delicious. I believe I've ordered this salad as my entree in the past - a lovely tasting plate.I was almost full at this point, but still we split an entree: the Mediterranean Sampler with skewers of beef, chicken and shrimp. Nice-sized portion of each. Perfect for sharing, especially after all the apps we started with.Sounds like a 5-star review, I know... The only thing holding me back is that it's a bit pricy.

We did the price fix where for 140 bucks (100 + tip) a person we got drinks (took forever to get them, so I only ended up having two drinks!) and the smallest plates of food (TO SHARE) to eat.  I couldn't even try the food because by the time the plates got to me there was like a bite (and the other people who were sharing had like a bite each).  I feel Fig and Olive took advantage of the price fix and us. Now, I am small and get full easily and when I left, my friends and I looked for a pizza shop. I was still hungry after I left. They gave out small plates per every four/five people and there were like 2 small pieces of food on each plate...shame! The hostess was rude and pretentious.  She acted as though her time was better then mine (honestly, I make more money in an hour then she does in a week and I am much nicer).  The server was very friendly though.  When we were waiting for our table, the bartender took forever to get us drinks.  It was just not worth my time or money.  I don't mind spending a good amount of money on food if there are friendly staff, a normal size portion, and the food is good.

The hostess approached us and said that they had a ""very special table"" that just opened up and if we'd like we should totally eat earlier than our res. We did. It was totally worth it. Once seated at our lovely table with our delicious cocktails our waitress greeted us. I wish I could remember her name, but at the moment it's beyond me. Regardless she was great. For starters we ordered three crostini's, all of which were delicious, light and full of flavors. We also ordered the zucchini carpaccio with a substitute of almonds instead of pine nuts (I'm allergic). The dish was so simple, yet unbelievably flavorful.  For our entrees I ordered the Paella. The fish was excellent, the rice cooked to perfections, and most importantly (for me) the portion was perfect. It wasn't one of those paella's you order and have dinner for a week. My fiance ordered the filet, and I must say it was ridiculously good. It actually surprised me - they use some sort of brine with Mediterranean herbs. Get it. It's that good. For dessert we decided on the cheese cake brule. Sounds weird, tastes great. Interesting concept and executed well. Anyway, this place worked like a well oiled machine and if you read my posts that is very important to me. Food is only one aspect of a great dinning experience. This had it all.

My favorites were the manchego and fig and prosciutto and fig-others at the table who enjoy seafood more than I do really liked the salmon. For my main course I got the roasted chicken and it was so good! The meat was cooked perfectly-not dried out at all and had great flavor.

For crudo's go with the salmon and the beef tartar, i'm sure the tuna is okay i'm just not a big tuna fan.  Finally get the truffle mushroom croquette and the bisque.

Otherwise, the decor was nice, really high ceilings, and very spacious. I had the tuna tartar for my appetizer. It was light and fresh, and it kind of reminded me of a pickled Korean dish. I also loved that it came with toasted bread on the side. For the entree, I had the salmon- it was fresh and very soft, almost a little too soft and slightly undercooked. It came with a saute of chickpeas, olives, and onions. Average, in my opinion. Dessert was an entirely different story (And the only reason why I give it 4 stars as opposed to 3). The chocolate pot de creme was heaven in a bowl. A chocolate moose topped with light creme on top and a piece of crunch on the side. WOW. The creme was a perfect supplement to the sweet, chocolatey amazingness and in my opinion, what made the entire dessert so good. Without the creme, it would have just been a chocolate moose, which is too much sweet at once.This place was okay, but I would come back every day for the rest of my life just for the chocolate pot de creme.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

The cocktails are great and you definitely feel like you're in a hip, stylish NYC restaurant... although at times it felt like we were in an actual nightclub with music blaring,  making conversation below screaming level difficult...However there is no way the food justifies the exorbitant prices. This place is all style over substance. I ordered the mushroom and truffle oil pasta and it tasted like something I'd cook at home (and I'm a pretty bad cook!).

The first time we went there was for winter restaurant week. I had the tuna tartar for app  and the paella for entree. Tuna Tartar - Very good. Flavor and texture were both great. Paella Del Mar - RIce was cooked perfectly and the dish had great flavor. The only downside was that  the portion was definitely on the small side.Second time around, we ordered from the regular menu. App: Beef Carpaccio - DELICIOUS!!! Super thin slices of filet mignon topped with arugula and flakes of parmesan. I don't know why this isn't the universal way to serve beef carpaccio. Entrees: Mediterranean Branzino with Fig & Balsamic - Fish was cooked nicely with a slightly crispy skin. LOVE LOVE LOVE the figs and the balsamic reduction. Fig & Olive Mediterranean Tasting platter - Steak and shrimps were cooked to perfection. The chicken was a bit overcooked...not surprising since I've never had chicken in a restaurant that wasn't overcooked. Flavoring was great. Loved the greek yoguart and honey.

It was like eating a liquid version of tzatziki, which I love! We were also given three types of olive oil and bread, and each was delicious. I especially likes the herby Australian one. For my main course I chose the penne, and am I glad I did! There was a perfect distribution of pasta and mushrooms, with black truffle paste and white truffle oil. Oh my! I ate every bit, and it was a very large serving so I was pretty stuffed by the end of that course. But, that didn't stop me from enjoying my dessert - chocolate custard and a praline bar. Fantastic!

The salmon crudo with grapefruit and orange was like an Italian version of sashimi--so good! The branzino ala plancha was grilled to perfection, and the lightly drizzled pesto on top was an amazing pairing. I tasted the summer chicken tajine as well, which was also very flavorful and fall-off-the-bone tender.

Our friend living in the city recommended Fig & Olive in the Meatpacking district. The restaurant itself is gorgeous - with modern architecture and wide, open spaces throughout a building that looks like it may have once been a slaughterhouse 100 years ago.Our reservation for 7 was at 8:30pm and we were seated promptly. This place is fun - and the music is loud. If you expect to have conversation with someone at the other side of the table, forget about it.I ordered the Filet Mignon, medium-well. My 2 complimentary sides were roasted potatoes and sauteed mushrooms. The steak was cooked a bit more on the medium side than I would have preferred, but tasted very good and flavorful. I greatly enjoyed the sauteed mushrooms which were a perfect compliment to the filet. The roasted potatoes were very bland and disappointing.For dessert, our table ordered the chocolate souffle which was outstanding. rich and made perfectly, with a great scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. id definitely order this again if i came back.overall, nice experience, great atmosphere, but i wouldnt come back with a large group. a date or double date would be fine...",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

Before I could even finish my entree I noticed that my friend absolutely devoured hers, haha. I wish I remembered what she ordered, but it must have been amazing. Additionally, if you only come here for drinks please try the Summer in Provence cocktail. Muddled blackberries, gin, thyme syrup and lime juice. They had me at muddled blackberries.

Eye-candies for both gals and guys; cool place for the young and the old to hang out.Prices: Mid-range to highFood: Great qualityService: Dining Service is Excellent; Hosting Service is Hostile Atmosphere: fun, chic, and cool for singles and couplesThe Long Review: The Bad Stuff:Hosts and hostesses can be a little hostile. We got their on time only to be told it will be 10 minutes before the table is ready; it took an extra 10 minutes before they would check on us again. Towards the end of 20 min. waiting, I decided to order a drink.  Just as I took my first sip, the hostess came over and said our table was ready. I tell the hostess 'great' and assume they will add my drink orders to our bill. Big mistake! She snatches up and makes one of those ""yeah, I don't give a ""F"" face"" and says, ""you need to pay for the drinks NOW"". It was the tone of her voice that was shocking. She snatched up like a loan shark, demanded we pay for it. Here is the funny part. The drink was a Sprite! That night we had a dinner that totaled over $300 for two people. But the hostess made a blip about a $2 glass of Sprite. Insane! Was she having a bad day or was the restaurant having bad time making money? The Good Stuff:The dining service is amazing! We got the best seats in the house on the stage deck with the view of the whole place. The lighting was perfect! Fig and Olive at Meatpacking district figured out how to control their lighting so that it's not too bright to scream ""loud"" or too dim to make you want to take the candle and bring the menu closer for a better read. They have a balanced menu that caters to seafood, meat, and veggie lovers without compromising quality. Food: The food at Fig and Olive is worth every penny! From the random orders of appetizers we made (at least four different dishes including one sample plate), to the main course dinner, we finished every plate craving for more. I had their salmon dish. The combination of colors (green, creamy, and golden brown) in its food décor complimented the mood as much as it satisfied every bite of its taste with the juicy savoring flavors that give new meaning to ""yummy!"" If you are on a budget, their appetizer menu alone can be a wonderful choice because you will satisfy your hunger with a taste that will make you curious about their main course; you will find telling yourself ""I want to try this place again"". Dessert: Finally the desserts! We must have had at least 2 or 3 different desserts. I am not crazy about cheesecake but at Fig and Olive, they really put their hearts into it. Each glide of the spoon is gentle, smooth, and soft, like caressing the curves of a foxy woman gently with the fingers until you touch her lips with yours. You close your eyes with the first bite, and you feel as alive as the first kiss you had with your hot date. I particularly remember the Warm Chocolate Soufflé. The buzzing taste of orange infused with vanilla ice cream melts in your mouth until it makes you get a genuine organic MOUTHGASM!!! You definitely want to share the dessert with your date to step up the fun to unwrap every bit of naughtiness for the rest of the night! :PPeople: Some of their hosts and hostesses have the VSS (visible stress syndrome). Being a host can be a tough job but when you do it, do it with a smile that's genuine and you never know how generous your customers may be to you.  Bottom line: They could use professional training!The waiters/waitresses and waitstuff are very cordial. They work with professionalism that shows they know their stuff AND that they CARE about their customers. You should reflect that on your tips! The Service:  Great service minus the host/hostesses. This is equivalent to business class service on an airline. I am happy with the way my waiters and waitresses have served me over and again on my multiple visits there. Overall:Go there for the fun of hanging out with your friends on a sultry summer night, or a warm company in winter. You can expect a great experience at Fig and Olive Meatpacking District once you get passed the gatekeeper hosts and hostesses. You are paying for both great food and great dining experience. The entire setup of the restaurant evokes that through its excellent décor and presentation in its people, service, and most importantly in its food!",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

859,gWvmjEJoxMjOrX7hiU7rNA,Jeanne R.,2.0 star rating,"I went to Fig & Olive last night to try out their restaurant week menu and have to say I was more than disappointed.  I know it can sometimes be hard to judge a restaurant based on RW, but I feel like that is an opportunity for them to attract new loyal customers that may not have otherwise considered them.  I made a reservation for a friend and I and we were seated promptly, however we were put at a very small table despite the restaurant being nearly empty.  We ordered from the restaurant week menu, I had the tuna tartare, grilled truffle chicken paillard and the pot de creme.  The tuna was boring and flavorless.  The chicken was terrible - it was so dry and tasted like shoe leather.  How hard is it to make chicken paillard?  It was supposed to come with truffled mashed potatoes and leek confit, but what was on my plate looked like overcooked leeks that had zero flavor and freezing cold mashed potatoes that were grainy and bland.  It seemed as though they had made all the RW dishes that morning and let them sit until someone ordered them.  The pot de creme was rich and creamy, once you got through the watery whipped cream on top.While the food was a huge let down, so was the service.  Our waitress was really nice and attentive, but they rushed us so badly that we were hardly finished eating and they were taking away the plates.  We were both drinking expensive wine so it's not like we were just wasting the table space drinking tap water.Overall I was really disappointed and will never go again.  If they think restaurant week is a time to half-ass it they are really missing the point.  I love to go out and try new places and am just glad that I got to see what Fig & Olive were really all about to save myself the trouble of trying them on a regular night.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

Boy, after my trip to the Meatpacking district last night, do I feel like an idiot.  There are oh so many things to do with figs and this restaurant takes up the Iron Chef ""secret ingredient: fig"" challenge with fervor.  There was fig chutney, figs chopped and figs baked, figs in balsamic, fig stuffing, whole split figs and figs baked.   Figs and various olive oils are the stars of every dish.  After a meal here you will have a greater understanding of the joys of a true, fresh Mediterranean diet.I got the grilled branzino and a side of sauteed spinach.  The fish came in little fillets with a crispy sweet skin.  Each piece sat on top of a cut, baked fig and the flavor combination was really well planned, the sweet and the salty with the chunky white fish.  The spinach was barely cooked so it tasted super fresh. It was mixed with almonds and...can you guess?  Figs!  Again, I thought this was all really good and though the portions were small, they were surprisingly satisfying.A word on the atmosphere:  since I knee this place was all about the basics and clean, fresh tastes, I was kind of surprised to feel the trendy vibe flowing through the place.  Instead of white walls and bright lights, the place was dimly lit and tinted with a soft pink light.  Eighties music was playing, who knew?  The bar was hopping while people waited for a seat in the expansive restaurant.  I guess all if these elements are necessary if you're gonna open up a place in the Meatpacking district.  Overall, I truly enjoyed my meal.  The prices were affordable and the ingredients were quality.   I also won't ever have to google ""fig"" and its cooking uses ever again.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

He brought over some yummy focaccia and a selection of three olive oils, which tasted surprisingly different when tasted next to one another.  I got the gazpacho for the first course, lobster risotto for the second course, and chocolate pot du crème for dessert.  Gazpacho was a generous portion and very fresh. Another generous portion with the lobster risotto - it was an entire lobster tail, which I didn't expect during Restaurant Week, or at a trendy restaurant!  The risotto itself was oversalted, and I didn't like the whole baby carrots cooked into it, but the lobster itself was very good.  Chocolate pot du crème was a WINNER, and it was served along a tiny biscotti that looks pretty unassuming but somehow tasted like Nutella.This place has a fun, trendy scene.  Lots of beautiful people floating around and expensive handbags.  It was noisy inside, which seemed right for the setting.  Beautiful interiors with a pretty bar and towering plants..",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

She snorts at me and fawns over the other guest, ""Oh, that's our signature dish, you'll love it. You have great taste."" Ok, weird. She got one order incorrect because it looked like she was trying to hear another table's conversation. I orderd another drink and it tasted totally different from the first one.

Apparently, the group that had our table before us was taking their time with their meal, and the staff couldn't very well kick them out of the table. Unfortunately, they couldn't find a table to seat us anywhere else either. At least the staff was very apologetic the whole time.Once we finally got our table, we got champagne and several rounds of crostinis on the house to make up for our long wait. Again, our server was very apologetic and thanked us for being so accommodating. The crostinis were OK in taste, some tasted better than others. The rest of the meal was uninspired and nothing that great. My friend ordered some kind of pasta which tasted bad enough for her to exchange it for a salad.

I was really impressed with the superb interior design. The high ceilings and large windows make it a very bright and airy place to eat. We caught the tail end of the brunch, so it wasn't too busy and were seated immediately which was a good start. However, it took a quite a while for our server to come over; we actually had to ask for him. In between that a drink we didn't order had been put on the table and when we asked  our server about it he looked completely perplexed and didn't really say that much. very strange....The menu at Fig and Olive looked quite good, and I will admit that there were lots of options. But, I couldn't help thinking that a smaller more refined menu would have done the trick. It was a little overwhelming and not easy to navigate. I ordered the chicken salad which had a wonderful dressing and was accompanied with vegetables. However, I was disappointed at the meager portion of chicken. The chicken samosa my sister ordered was OK, but nothing special unfortunately (unfortunately it wasn't even hot). I didn't try the other dished but they looked good. I really wanted to like this place more, but the odd service and average food brings my star average down to three. I mean, I didn't even get the orange juice I ordered.

We each got a ceviche (which for 6 bucks a pop was a huge portion and really fresh), then shared the fig, ricotta, and prosciutto tart, which was amazing. Cheese, meat and warm puff pastry-divine. I highly recommend the cucumber martinis as well (I love cuc beverages-makes me feel like I am being fresh and healthy while consuming hard alcohol).We were pretty full by the time we got our mains, which were the Fig and Olive salad and spicy shrimp penne. The salad was huge and amazing-fresh ripe figs, 3 different kinds of cheese (including a big chunk of manchengo), great dressing. The penne itself was al dente and good for penne (I am not a super penne fan), but the shrimp was plump and big and juicy. The sauce was not spicy at all, but still tasty.Totally fun fact-they have 3 different kinds of dirty martinis!!! I tried the nicoise, which was an interesting dark red  color and was utterly delicious. Too full for dessert, I asked the server to have the bartender make me a drink with Frangelico, and it was frothy and exactly what I wanted.

She was warm, present, knew the menu and was able to steer us in the right direction with what to order. I happily settled on the Crabcake Eggs Benedict and my friend had the Truffle Mushroom Fontina Scrambled Eggs. The presentation of these items was spot on how I would want my food to come out and the taste of the food matched the visual aesthetic of these items perfectly.  As well, Deena did right by us when she confirmed that the Creme Brulee cheesecake was as tasty as it sounded, so we happily scarfed that down too. Not once did we ever feel rushed there and Deena and the rest of the staff were personable, which made for a stellar first impression.

925,yDW4j6EktVOR9socI-a45w,Becky K.,5.0 star rating,"NYC's Restaurant Week has been open for a couple weeks now and I had the pleasure in visiting one of the most renowned restaurants in the Meatpacking District. Located not far from the beautiful Highline Park, Fig &Olive was on the top of my list of restaurants to visit when Restaurant Week started. Amanda and I made our dinner reservation to have another fine dining experience.Fig & Olive is an extremely well decorated European fusion restaurant with a highly modern interior. Everything about the restaurant, both the inside and the outside, was chic and we were greeted with the friendly hostess and waiter who showed us to our reserved table. Because it was still early for dinner, the restaurant was fairly empty, making the service much faster than what I had expected. Restaurant Week always has a three course prix fixe menu and Fig & Olive was not an exception. I ordered the chicken samosa as my appetizer, paella del mar as my entrée, and chocolate pot de crème as my dessert. Amanda also ordered from the Restaurant Week menu, getting the gazpacho de andalucia as her appetizer, the Fig & Olive summer chicken tajine as her entrée, and the chocolate pot de crème as her dessert. Prior to getting our appetizers, the waiter brought out a plate of warm freshly baked bread with three different types of olive oils. Amanda and I really liked this bread platter, particularly because we were given the chance to try different flavors of nutty and fruity olive oils. Shortly after the bread, our appetizers came out and all I can really say is that both of our appetizers were superb, setting the bar high for what to expect for the rest of our meal. The chicken samosas that I had ordered were seasoned perfectly, covered in crispy and light puff pastry, topped with a sweet and tangy sauce. The gazpacho de andalucia that Amanda had ordered was fresh and simple, plated aesthetically to satisfy the diner. As for our entrées, we were even more impressed with Fig & Olive after tasting the first bite of our dishes. The paella del mar that I ordered was cooked perfectly, with the creamy rice combined with well-seared scallops on the side. Amanda's chicken tajine was also grilled to perfection, but what she loved the most about her entrée was the grilled fig that came alongside the chicken. The overall savory dish was heightened by the sweetness of the fig, adding a great balance to the rest of the dish. Lastly, for the dessert, our chocolate pot de crèmes were the prefect finish to the entire meal - the desserts were light, fluffy chocolate that still had the rich, sweet flavor. All three courses at Fig & Olive were light and fresh. Fig & Olive is smart with their flavors, creating refreshing yet innovative tastes using simple ingredients which ultimately result in great dishes. Although the general price for a meal at Fig & Olive is on the higher end, Restaurant Week provides a great opportunity for diners who want to enjoy a fine restaurant experience at an affordable price. I'm aware that Fig & Olive also has a cheese platter and crostini tasting that has been extremely popular amongst eaters, so I'll be sure to try this out the next time I visit.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

The restaurant has a nice decor and ambiance earlier in the evening. We were given a tasting of olive oils with bread which was delicious. We didn't feel rushed out the door after our meal.Cons: the service was extremely slow. We waited at least 10 minutes between the time we got our wine glasses and the time the waiter came back with the wine, and then again before he took our order. Once the order was placed the food arrived quickly though. One of us ordered the salmon, which came unevenly cooked and overly salty and could not finish her dish.  After mentioning this to the waiter , he was apologetic. When we ordered one dessert to share he brought us an extra chocolate cake on the house. While this was a nice gesture, why not just take something that we did order off the cheque ? We didn't just order one dessert because we couldn't afford two. The rest of the food was good, but not extraordinary and certainly not worth the price/hype.

Got sat and ordered  a ridiculous amount of food.  I like a waiter that doesn't stop me or tell me that I have ordered too much.  I know that eat a lot, I don't need someone else telling me that.  And our server just let us keep going until we were done.  A rarity for sure. Kept the delicious food coming and the wine flowing.  They were also very kind to follow the laws of making me drink a few sips out of the bottle before allowing us to take a bottle for the road.  I enjoyed my meal and my service.  The only thing that kept it from being 5 stars- although an abundance of veg options throughout the menu, there aren't really any for entrees.  But, there was MORE than enough amazing options for me to eat and eat and eat!

Three stars for my Fig and Olive Mediterranean tasting entree (shrimp skewers, lamb skewers, and chicken). Two stars for the spotty service. Highlights include: the sesame tuna tartare, the cheese plate, beef carpaccio, the trio of olive oils that come with the bread your server will bring to your table (range of flavors, fruitness, and spiciness - yum!), and the salad we had - don't remember what it was called, but it had the most amazing fresh mozzarella. And the olive oil mashed potatoes were a delight that's not to be missed - whatever olive oil is used (the menu specifies - I just can't remember) is a killer.My entree, particularly the lamb and shrimp skewers, was underseasoned, which was a bit of a downer. The couscous that the lamb was served with also tasted a little off to me, but I can't really explain why. It seemed too... sour?The cocktail I had - the Rossellini cocktail (passion fruit vodka, blood orange puree, orange bitters and fresh citrus juices. Served straight up with an orange twist) was amazing - refreshing, sweet but not too sweet - perfect. This alone would make me want to come back here. Fresh juices, guys, not the bottled nonsense you get from other places in Manhattan. This drink is actually worth what it costs, which is more than what I can say for other rip off places in the city. This is probably the best cocktail I have had in New York - ever. Half of our table had the caramelized apple tart, and the other half had the olive oil gelato with shortbread cookies; both were recommendations from our server, and both were delicious. I tried my manager's apple tart, and it was incredibly flaky with just the right sweetness. My olive oil gelato was rich and creamy, with an interesting taste, but I couldn't really grasp that olive oil background as much as I'd hoped. Despite that, I enjoyed every bite of it. The shortbread was buttery goodness.The service left something to be desired - our server was inattentive, and it took a lot of effort to get him to take our orders for almost everything. He had no problem being attentive with other smaller parties around us, which really drove all of us nuts. The management really needs to work on getting more staff so that tables like ours aren't feeling like they are being neglected.Factoring in the service and the A-OK-ness of my entree, this place gets 3 stars in my book.

I am not from the city and am not overly experienced with city fine dining. We did have an overall good experience, however I can't say the overall package is worth the price for what they charge. I have to give them points, we were late for our reservation due to traffic and they still sat us in a timely fashion. Our waiter was attentive and entertaining without being overbearing (okay, maybe a little overbearing) but better than being forgotten about. I did not try the crostinis (their signature). Two of the girls who had gotten there early tried them at the bar and said they were tiny for the price. They basically described them as 3 bites for $10.  Drinks were delicious, if pricey, and ample. I can't say they were necessarily worth the price, I have had better for less, but I guess you pay for atmosphere. My main issue is with the entrees, which were extremely tiny and were ridiculously priced. My ravioli were good, but not great, and at $25 was shocked to get 6 little ones. No sides, those area extra. Atmosphere is great,trendy, good lighting, nice flow. The paella may have been the most sizeable item on the list since there was a good mix of protein and rice for the price. There was also a DJ which was nice. And while I might be have thought my sticker shock was a little biased since I was not local, I could tell the other 3 girls were a little uncomfortable when we got the check. 2 drinks each plus a single entree for five came to almost $400.

It's sophisticated without being over-the-top and doesn't have the fussiness of the other restaurants in the area. There's a great vibe when you walk in and the bar area seems to always be hoppin'! The service is excellent and they have a really great wine list and special drinks menu. Now to the important stuff: the food. Deeeeelish. We went for restaurant week (best time to go!) and I couldn't say one bad thing about anything on the menu. I'd suggest going for the prix-fixe (I believe they offer it year-round, not just RW).The Bell Pepper and Tomato Soup was very tasty. Not too tomato-y, not too creamy, and perfectly spicy! For the entree, you absolutely positively must get the Filet Mignon - it's uh-mazing. It was cooked just as I asked and the herbed butter they serve with it... there are no words to describe. Dessert is pretty standard, but still very good. This is definitely one of my top favorite restaurants in NYC. It's a slightly pricey spot though - which is why the prix-fixe is your best bet.

I went with a group of lady friends, and although the overall experience was enjoyable, I had a few qualms with the place. I stress the food was good, and so was the service, but I only gave them three stars for the following reasons: Our entire group did not arrive at the same time. Understandably they would not seat us until the entire group was there, but we had well--behaved twin three-year old boys with us. Normally I can justify a restaurant having us stand while waiting, but with twin three year olds???? We had them standing for at least 15 minutes while waiting for the last person in our party to appear. We asked for a refill of the bread and olive oil sampler, and when our waiter dropped a piece of the bread on our table, he put it back on our bread plate. Not what I expected from a high-end restaurant. My pasta dish came with a side of Parmesan cheese, and it tasted more like 4C Parmesan cheese than real parmigiano reggiano. Maybe I am being overly fussy, but when I spend a good amount of money on a meal I expect certain things. The food was good and the atmosphere was lovely (with one of the jazz players giving the twins little egg shakers to ""shake"" along with the music,) but I don't think I will be going back anytime soon.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

We had the dessert sampler which is great since you get to have little bites of 3 or 4 desserts-wish more restaurants had dessert samplers. The crostinis are appetizers that are perfect for 1 person-not really for sharing. My pumpkin ravioli was also delicious, although I felt the flavor was very subtle and not as strong as I would've liked since I love the taste of pumpkin. The concept of bringing out 3 different olive oils with bread is unique and clever. The bread was soft as well which is a plus. The main negative is that it's not a great place to have a group conversation since the music can be too loud.

The olive oil flight that accompanies the table bread is wonderful ( I'm a dipper who enjoys diversity). I ordered the tuna tartare appetizer, branziano fish dish with figs and balsamic, and the pot de creme ( delicious chocolately pudding with hazelnut cream biscuit anyone?!??!) I was very satisfied with my meal but we were here for lunch on a friday and it was empty. I would definitely come back for small plate options later in the evening.

They put the F in Fig, as it is the only place I've been to that preserves its integrity. They don't caramelize their figs to death and make it PART of the dish instead of only a sauce. Another cool thing is the ENTIRE PARTY doesn't have to order the prix fixe. I also tried the Chicken Samosa, Fig Gorgonzola Tartlet, Organic Chicken, Lamb Skewers, Pasta, Apple Tart, Souffle, which were all delish. The only miss was my appetizer, which was way oversauced to death.3 COURSE PRIX FIXE ($36)Ordered:-Yellowtail Carpaccio - super thin, WAY TOO MUCH sauce on it, FAIL-Branzino - aka European Sea Bass, 4pcs of deliciousness, crispy skin, cooked perfectly, big hit, fresh figs (untampered) under the fish pieces-Cookies & Cream - 2 choco chip cookies, madelines (delish), 2 mini pastries that tasted like wannabe rugelachNote: They don't seat you until your ENTIRE party is present.Total came out to $47/pp after everythingI took my meetup here:Pics to follow...",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

I personally think the meatpacking branch since it has the best decor. The high ceilings and spacious loft made the restaurant  hip and modern yet has a casual elegance to it.Upon arriving, the server was polite and cordial. To start off they served us bread with a variety of olive oil. The olive oil was quite interesting but the bread was cold and of poor quality.I had the scallops as an appetizer and they were scrumptous! For main course I had the Funghi pasta, and must I say it was somewhat disappointed. It was tasteless. Both my friends were fans of lamb but they did not like their Lam Shish kabobs. It was undercooked and not remarkable.Overall, I think this place is one of those to-be-seen spots that used to have decent food but no longer cared about their quality once they became well known.

All the meat was tender, the use of olive oils and figs were fun, and I enjoyed having more than 2 choices for each course. Portion size was on the small side, but the food was surprisingly filling.We ordered a sampling of 6 crostini off the regular menu, and they were the high point of the meal. Although pricey (6 for $18), they were packed with a lot of interesting and complex flavors. Prosciutto, ricotta, fig, olive, and walnut... all in one bite!

Fig and Olive is absolutely, hands down, the perfect place to enjoy a leisurely evening with your best girl friends over amazing food and wine - be it one friend or a whole group. I went with the latter and every single one of us absolutely loved it. The ambiance would make for a fun and romantic date, too. I wish I could recall specifically the dishes that we had, but it was last year and given the size of our group we probably had a little bit of everything on the menu. I can definitely remember savoring every bite and sip, thinking that it was fantastic and have been dying for a return trip since.I spend a decent amount of time in NY and we have thought/talked about moving for years, but for the most part I'm content staying put in the nation's capital. Every now and then I come across a meal, a neighborhood, an experience that makes me pine to pack it all up and move pronto, and my visit to Fig and Olive was one of those nights.

I ended up just paying with an average tip amount, but I couldn't help feeling like we had been taken for a ride the rest of the night.  I don't like this kind of thing, almost more than just slow service or cold food, which are at least obvious in their faults.  Not going back.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

977,iYLOCmJTqEKVix7EYbCuNA,Carol H.,3.0 star rating,"I came here for RW for 3 other friends on a week night, and the experience was... all right.  First of all, this is in an incredibly desolate part of town. You get out of the subway station and you walk, and you walk, and you start to feel like you're getting into the shady areas where people get killed in warehouses and dumped into the river and you call your friend to make sure you haven't passed it, then you walk another block and pass it by accident anyway, because its signage is incredibly small and its windows so dark is blends into the surrounding warehouses.The hostesses were perfectly all right, not friendly but not cold either.  I don't know how they determine seating, but they led us through the first room to a table in the equally dim  back room.  Atmosphere: weirdly club like. Thumping bass, hip hop music... if it had been turned up a bit more with all the tables gone, it would have been exactly the same as any of the clubs in the Chelsea area.   The decor was awesome, just look at any of the pics for more details.Our server was strangely absent for most of our meal... he dropped off menus, asked about drinks, then didn't come back for our orders for a REALLY long time.  We were socializing and all so it was okay, but it was a bit annoying cause I was hungry.  The rest of the meal, it seemed like he only swung by to check on us because we were seated next to the large group he was also waiting on.Food: the portions were larger than I expected, but I left with an uncomfortably heavy feeling (see my review on Craftbar for what a good full feeling is).  The olive oil and bread they give you at the beginning were tasty.  I had the tuna carpaccio, grilled branzino, and chocolate pot de creme.  Carpaccio--amazing.  Thin, delicate tastes, went down well.  The branzino seemed a bit heavier, it still tasted good but was kind of...oily?  Not literally, but in the way it made me feel.  I traded a bit of it for the lamb my friend had, and that was pretty damn good.  Whatever it was cooked with masked that lamb-y taste very well.  My dessert was uninspiring, I probably could have presented it better than they did, and the same goes for my friends' tiramisu in a cup.  Overall, it was just an ""eh"" dining experience...not great, but not crappy either.",Fig & Olive,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Mediterranean,, French,, Vegetarian"

I've read the reviews and thought I was in for a "" fresh"" & "" healthy"" treat. I was wrong. A majority of the dishes on the menu included truffle oil( which I do enjoy in moderation), it was almost impossible to avoid. What they call ""crostini"" was in actuality just little slices of stale bread with some sad toppings. I sent it back after one bite and the manager came over. After I explained why it was not for me, she proceeded to push for a detailed description of why I didn't care for it. I felt like we were not speaking the same language. Normally I would appreciate the restaurant sending someone over but this woman had a terrible attitude (you'd think I insulted her personally, which of course I did not.) Honesty, I can make better food myself! The only positive note is that the ambiance was very pleasing and they have a very nice selection of wine.
