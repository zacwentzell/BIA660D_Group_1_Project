I can definitely see this place packing out on a Saturday night. When you first walk in there is a bar along the right wall and tables along the left. This walkway leads into a backroom with a dance floor and another bar along the back wall of this room, a nice perk for quick drink output. The bathrooms are upstairs which seemed to be relatively clean and the line moved fast (at least for the guys).The food served on NYE was pasta, sausage and peppers, fried chicken, and potato skins. I am not impressed. There are no tables so you were forced to eat like a prisoner standing up holding your plate and shoving it down your throat as fast as possible before you spill it on your nice outfit. Drinks were very light for an open bar, maybe a half oz of liquor in each, it was straight soda, i stuck to beers. No top shelf alcohol, no shots, food was ehhh. For $100 i think I'll go elsewhere next year for NYE. the bar itself though seems ok and maybe i would come back for a casual night of partying on the weekend.

40,NPKoA2XDImG_UunZT9M8WA,Ms. R.,1.0 star rating,"DO NOT HOST YOUR OPEN BAR HERE I recently hosted an open bar at this establishment in celebration of my Graduate School Graduation with about 30 of my closest friends. After paying almost $2,000 to host the event at Wille McBrides, I asked if they would have a place to store the gifts that my friends were bringing for me (most were bottles of wine, champagne, and vodka), and they did. I placed each gift behind the bar and they were taken and stored in a locked closet. I went back the next morning to pick up all of my gifts and received nothing but the bottles back. It wasn't until the week after when I was devastated to find out that one of my gifts, a Kate Spade Watch and Purse worth over $400 total (the only gift that wasn't a bottle), was stolen right out of its gift bag by one of their employees. As if having a gift stolen out of the bag was not enough, the manager was unapologetic, unsympathetic and refused to accept or acknowledge any blame whatsoever. There is simply no other explanation how I could have received every single bottle that was gifted to me and NOT the watch and purse. The manager did nothing to assure me she would look into it or ask any of the employees. What was supposed to be a pleasant memory and celebration for me, one which I worked hard to treat my friends to, is tarnished by the selfishness of an employee and an apathetic manager.",Willie McBrides,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Irish, Pub,, Music, Venues"

The food menu has recently changed and it's probably the best bar food menu in town - wings and flat bread pizzas are must buys every time. Great for sports and football with a good tv layout and bartenders who knows to put the right games on. Also, if you're far call the limo and they pick you up free.  Better than uber!

And that is too often.For some reason at Willie McBrides, it is all about who you know. I came here a couple months ago and before entering was told I had to pay a cover. Umm, what? This is a Hoboken bar, not a night club. While I understand a cover if there is a band, there were no acts that night. I started to walk away in disgust and my friend who knew the coat check girl and bouncer ""smoothed"" things over and we got in for ""free"". I was also here for a birthday party and again, the staff was horrible. Upon entering the back room and paying for an open bar, a small spanish-looking bouncer is warning me to behave. I haven't done anything wrong, was polite, and was in a good mood; please don't lecture me for no reason. Over compensating? He wanted to the put the open bar bracelet on my left wrist; I told him I would rather have it on my right because I literally just got my cast off my left arm for a wrist fracture. He throws a temper tantrum and I say okay just to be done with it. He isn't the only alpha male wannabe working there either. Every time I go there is a white male bartender always in back bar with glasses.  He constantly bitches openly about how all the customers suck. Thanks douche. He will text on his phone the whole night and will do his job when he feels like it. Why are you in a customer oriented job if you hate it? Go back to school or something. This is probably a good time to mention that their open bar policy is a joke. They are purposely slow to the point it makes no sense to buy it.  2 drinks every hour is not my idea of open bar. While I understand you don't want your customers fall down drunk, you implement the no shot policy, which Willie McBrides does.  But don't promise open bar if your business plan is to not deliver by being super slow.  Why is it that I can go to the bar in front and order without a problem? Because that is not open bar. As others have pointed out, they pull a bait and switch tactic with their beer specials. Their website will give a special on Miller Lite, but they do not honor it when you show up. When you point this out, they delete it from their website. But the next day it will be up again? That's blatantly dishonest and illegal. Shady door policies, overzealous bouncers, and bad attitudes is not my idea of a fun time.",Willie McBrides,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Irish, Pub,, Music, Venues"

The space in the back is pretty big. The only thing that is annoying is that the only bathroom is upstairs so if anyone in the front needs to use the restroom they have to walk through your event but not much of a big deal. I was here recently for the Hoboken Comedy Festival and they did a really good job. I would say they were able to sit about 75-100 people maybe more? But it was comfortable.

I was starving and ordered a chicken quesadilla, which I found surprisingly satisfying. They also had $2 Miller draft special, which might have a been a happy hour thing, although I'm not positive. Willie McBride's has a divey, lazy kind of vibe. There is an assortment of characters and age groups although they all share a quality of intrinsic informality. The problem with this place was the credit card minimum - which was $15 dollars. The problem was not so much that this practice is illegal, but that one of the male bartenders (he had a goatee) was extraordinarily rude and inept. I've worked at a number of restaurants, and it's just not good business practice. The man running the trivia was kind and comedic, and the female bartender was cordial also.

There's no better way to fight off a hangover from a weekend of bad decisions than to roll up here Sunday morning, order a Monte Cristo French Toast and Mimosa for a cool ten bucks down, and then fire up the Mario Kart Wii for you and three of your friends to play prior to kick-off. Then, proceed to spend the entirety of the day watching every single NFL game across the country, courtesy of their multiple TVs surrounding the front bar, not to mention the projection screen in the back room. Willie McBride's is how Sunday Funday is done right.But what about the rest of the week? What good is a bar only good for one day out of seven? Not so fast. Every Friday and Saturday (as well as the occasional Thursday), Willie's hosts live entertainment. As a huge Bruce Springsteen fan, it's always a treat to catch the fantastic cover group, The B Street Band. There is a cover charge, but I never pay it and I'll tell you why.Willie McBride's has a free limo ride service on the weekends. And when you take it, you will also pay no cover - for using, again, their free limo! Why would you not take advantage of this? Whether you live around the corner or on the other side of town, it doesn't matter - call the number and take the limo. Where's the downside? 'Cause I can't seem to find it. But, seriously, don't be a jerk and make sure you tip the driver.During the week, Willie's is not only home to all your other favorite sporting events, but there is Team Trivia on Wednesdays, Happy Hour Thursdays, and deals and specials that continue day in and day out, including $2 domestic drafts. It is an all-around great Irish pub, smack in the middle of Hoboken, a perfect location for a meet-up whenever you and your friends' little hearts desire. The bartenders will sass the hell out of you if they remember you time and time again, only adding to that neighborhood bar feel. There's an aquarium behind the cashier, a fireplace in the corner, and live cameras filming the crowd dancing in the back for your enjoyment - all because, well - because why not?And perhaps that's where I'm going with all of this. You won't find me turning down plans to come here - I wouldn't be able to defend such an unthinkable response (nor would I want to). Why not go to the best bar in Hoboken? Exactly - why not?

The appetizers were ok, but were just like the frozen varieties you can buy at the super market. The sandwiches were deffo not great. I had a Reuben while one of my friends had a turkey burger, and the other had sliders. The turkey burger was dry and seasonless, the Reuben was greasy (and not in a good way) and the sliders were initially under cooked but then corrected.

Reading the fine print, I knew they didn't do shots so I assumed this would be out of the question. So when she made my cousin a Jack & Coke, I asked very politely Me: Hey... I know you can't do shots so I'm assuming a rocks drink is out of the question, but Jack & Coke is just too sweet for me.. can you please just only put a splash of coke in mine?Her: No. I make my mixed drinks the way that I make them. Everyone gets the same.Me: I don't mind coming back a million times and you can pour the same amount of Jack you would pour in any other drink.

But, it was one of my old college roommate's bdays and she lives there and all I can say is: Eeeeek!!!Seriously, beyond the fact I payed a cover in NEW JERSEY, I got a watered down vodka club (with a lime??? no, honey, club gets lemon) in a plastic cup. I know, I'm high maintenance. But, I do not dig. We grabbed a spot by the table covered with empty cups, shot glasses and other trash that the bar crew did not think was necessary to clean off .. EVER. We were watching the TVs, which I thought the grainy footage was a Paris Hilton sex tape ... but, it was not ... it was a live feed of the dancing from the other room. WTF? I need to see this myself.I walked back with the girls and observed. Seriously -- there were about 15 18 year olds DIRTY, DIRTY, DIRTY dancing hardcore to a subpar cover band doing typical cover songs (""She was an American Girl"" ""I wanna be sedated"" .. you know what I mean?). Suddenly, another high school kid grabbed my hand --- OH HELL NO!  I just stared at him while he tried to dry hump my leg. Gross. Ick. Nast. I needed to leave ASAP. I'm not exaggerating, ya'll, those kids were seriously 18 and roofied. The girls were acting like Miley Cyrus at the Boom Boom Room. And, that, is not a good look. Meanwhile, some ugly cougars kept ""accidently"" elbowing us. Yes, we are younger, prettier and stealing your high school boys but put your hands on me again and I will drop your over-worked Jersey ass.My girls and I quickly ran out as quickly as we came and I could only muster one sentence before we headed out in the night, ""Were we just on a Dateline special?""",Willie McBrides,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Irish, Pub,, Music, Venues"

I suggested Willie's based on the my last experience.  the cover band that night was not NEARLY as entertaining, and as a result there were not as many people dancing or even occupying the back room.  I felt majorly let down, although luckily the band pulled together a couple hits for the ""crowd.""The sports bar area is enjoyable though.  The crowd is friendly and it's been easy to strike up conversations with the people around me without feeling creeped out.  Fun place to meet people!  I recommend this place for a casual night out and for a weekend without expectations --but don't come here for an event/someone's birthday unless you know the band is going to play something alright.",Willie McBrides,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Irish, Pub,, Music, Venues"

(Don't be an asshole, please tip the driver since you skip the line and cover when you roll in this kind of style).  The live acts on the weekends are usually so-so, as are most live bar cover bands (can't I keep my $10 cover and put it into the digital juke box instead??), although they did let me and David G. freestyle battle the two white middle aged MC's who were the Saturday night act.  The camera by the stage may be one of my favorite features, as the broadcast to the plasmas in the front room allow everyone to enjoy the blacked-out dirty dancing you didn't think anyone saw.  I'll laugh at you, but deep down I'm just jealous of your all-out good time.Tons of TVs in the front show all the locals in action , tables out front for the nice weather, and the food is pretty solid as well (the wings are kinda sloppy).Incredibly, their brunch is fantastic.  I went out on a limb and got the pancake and egg breakfast, reasonably priced at $9 with hash bacon and sausage, one drink included.  It was delicious and the pancakes were light and fluffy, possibly the best I've had at any brunch anywhere (excluding IHOP, which is obviously breakfast to the Gods).  Good spicy bloody too.",Willie McBrides,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Irish, Pub,, Music, Venues"

I've also been here a few times at night and had a pretty good experience although the one time my friend & I decided to go to trivia they ended up not having it because the crowd was not large enough which was a little bit annoying. The main reason I finally decided to write a review is because this past Friday my friends and I finally had a chance to ride in the Willie McBride limo. While I live only a block away, this Friday I was at my friend's apartment in Weehawken when we decided to head back into Hoboken to go out. I remembered about the Willie McBrides limo and so we decided to give it a try. It was definitely a really fun experience and it was great that it also meant no cover.
