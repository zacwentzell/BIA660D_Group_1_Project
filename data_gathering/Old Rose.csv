Which made us think, that this place would be absolutely perfect for brunch before exploring the Whitney around the corner.Still, dinner here is absolutely beautiful as well. The high ceilings and beautiful decor are really lovely.I couldn't decide which cocktail to order, but the waiter was really great about breaking down the two options I was considering and helping me figure out which would be best for my palate. I went with the white star, which has vodka, prosecco, and lavender. It's sweet and fresh, really brightened up the meal and didn't taste too much like alcohol. My friend ordered a negroni and was very happy with it.For the meal we both ordered pizzas. She got the mushroom pie, I got the vodka pie. The crust is nice and thin on the bottom, but doughy and nice on the edges. Each slice of my pie got a nice leaf of basil and dollop of burrata.I'll definitely come back here and try to make it for brunch!",Old Rose,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

I got the vodka pizza which was really yummy. However, the reason why I'm giving this place such a poor review is because of the service. Our waiter was rude and never came to our table; we were constantly trying to flag her down or get her attention. Then, the kitchen messed up my order and gave me a different pizza at first when my friends got their orders correct. So, I was sitting there without any food for almost fifteen minutes while they ate. The manager was kind enough to apologize and offer for the pizza to be free. Unfortunately, when we asked our waiter (which wasn't the same waiter we had at the beginning, I think she finished her shift?) to give us our check, we were still charged for the pizza. So, I had to go up to the manager and have him fix it. Then, they fixed it, which was good. My two friends and boyfriend put down their cards to split the bill evenly amongst the three of them and yet again, they messed up the charges and the receipts. Honestly, the meal should have been free for us, I've never experienced such bad service like this anywhere in New York City and it's pretty sad because the food in this restaurant is on the pricy side and one would be expecting top notch service.

5,HJnZMoAlaJD4nWxGEz9T_A,Christina L.,4.0 star rating,"After exploring some articles about trendy new restaurants in NYC, I decided to celebrate my 13 year friendsiversary with my best friend at Old Rose. My friend kindly made a reservation at 7:15pm. Old Rose is located inside of the Jane Hotel, so just go in the main entrance and make a quick left and the hostess will greet you. Once I got seated, I had to take a quick picture of the very romantic vibe (recommend for dates, anniversaries, and a nice evening dinner). The selection was very limited on the menu, and it seems like they switch it around occasionally since some items on prior Yelp posts were no longer available. We ordered the burrata to share - because how can you pass on burrata? My friend and I got 2 different pastas: Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe and Rigatoni Bolognese. The burrata was unbelievable. It was very different than any other burrata I've ordered. The thick slice of sourdough bread came toasted, so the outer edges were nice and crispy while the inside was so soft and warm. The cheese came in some olive oil topped with tomatoes and basil. It just melted in my mouth and tasted fantastic! Soon, the pastas came. They were also cooked to perfection. The only suggestion was that the spaghetti would be slightly a thicker version, but I do note that it's a personal preference. The pastas were topped with fresh parmesan. To end the delicious and filling meal, we got the desert menu. We were debating between the lime cheesecake and panna cotta. Just before we were going to choose the lime cheesecake to share, the waitress came by to tell us they ran out of the cheesecake. We settled for the panna cotta which came with dried raspberries with a caramel/chocolate drizzle. It wasn't my favorite, but it was a nice way to end the meal. I thought it was a reasonable dinner and I hope to come back to try other items on the menu, especially the pizzas, and also to get my lime cheesecake fix!",Old Rose,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

It's quite small and got pretty loud in that we couldn't hear what people said at the end of our table (we were a big group).

Food wasn't extremely expensive though definitely not cheap. I opted for the short ribs pasta (forgot the name) which was tasty though it didn't blow my mind. It was definitely different than getting pasta at any old Italian restaurant. The drinks on the other hand were just straight delicious. Got a coffee based cocktail and then switched to Negronis which were out of a tap and were outrageously delicious. I would highly recommend it. Only problem was they were slightly expensive.

8,zMDt8a5ioHltwYlYnqznrw,Jess P.,4.0 star rating,"GET THE PIZZA. My biggest takeaways from my experience here were: the space is beautiful and aesthetically pleasing | the brunch menu is a little small so if you have a picky eater, probably not the best place to take them to and the portions are a little bit small for the price.I ordered the mimosa which could have been stronger but good nonetheless and the table ordered the burrata vodka pizza which is a MUST TRY (if you didn't get that from how I started my review). It was probably one of the better pizzas I've had and I could probably eat the whole pie alone. The cheese was so light and it paired well with the vodka sauce. For my main I got the fried egg and gigante beans which was served with bread and had a great bolognese sauce. I wouldn't normally order a dish like this but it was DELICIOUS. I loved the sauce, and surprisingly loved how well it went with the beans. Only complaint was, we had a pretty big party and we were stuck in a small-ish table even though we made reservations. We were told that they were expecting bigger parties, but they never came and we had to stare longingly at the bigger, empty tables around us.",Old Rose,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian
9,SC4C7rzKVfzFGci2C8ENWg,Shawn H.,4.0 star rating,"Going with four stars but wrestled between four and five -- the food here was really great, but the experience wasn't quite perfect.We got the sourdough bread, the vodka burrata pizza, the bucatini with bolognese, and the flourless chocolate cake for dessert. The bread was fine, but overly-buttered for my tastes. (I realize that most people will actually like that...) The pasta was truly outstanding -- the bucatini probably could have been very slightly more al dente, but the sauce was perfect, and they didn't completely cover the pasta with it, which was fantastic. (Reminded me more of an Italian sauce than an American one.) We also really liked the chocolate cake, which seemed like more of a milk chocolatey taste.The pizza was also very good -- it's a takeoff of Jon & Vinny's LA Woman pizza, which is one of my favorites of all-time, and this is a very good one as well. (I didn't like the vodka quite as much as Jon & Vinny's tomato sauce, but that is a very high bar.) The only real issue with the pizza is that it came out slightly cold, which was kind of a bummer. But the fact that I still liked it as much as I did is probably a good indicator of how good the cooking here is -- the bread, sauce, burrata, and structural integrity of the slices were all great, it just likely took too long to come out.And that's largely how I'd sum up our first visit -- the kitchen seemed to be far ahead of the rest of the operation. I generally am not a big stickler on service, except when it actually impacts the quality of the meal, which I thought it did here -- the timing between the dishes seemed off, the pizza was a little cold, it was often tough to get a refill on water, etc, all while the place wasn't totally full (we went late on a Saturday night). That said, the food was really great, and I'm dying to try the fusilli cacio e pepe, which was another pasta special and looked amazing. We'll definitely be back to give it another shot, and hopefully I can bump that four to a five.",Old Rose,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

There was only one egg on the brunch pizza to pop! the yolk. The cocktail selection was also very, very darling. I had their Breakfast Gin Martini and it was the perfect mix of alc and lemon.

The restaurant is warmly lit with tall valted ceilings and Art Deco stylings. We had 7:30 reservation and the place was bustling when we arrived. The menu was simple but interesting. Italian fare, with decent vegetarian options. We started with a crispy rice salad. It had a decent spice level with thin slices of jalepenos scattered throughout. Next we had a vodka pizza with burrata. The crust was extremely crisp, a little more so than my liking. But the choice of burrata instead of straight mozzarella gave it a creamy and indulgent taste. For entrees we both had pasta. My wife had a mushroom ragu over fusilli. I had the cavatelli with fennel sausage and broccoli rabe. Both were good but not great. Overall nice space and ambiance.

Here's my however: We came in a big group of grownups and casually mentioned my girlfriends little sisters 21st birthday. We drank, ordered food, had a great time. At the end of the night we were asked if we wanted to order dessert. Of course we said ""we will take a look at the menu"". After deciding on no dessert, out of nowhere, the birthday girl delivered a very small slice of chocolate cake with a candle on it. We were surprised since no one in the party requested a special treatment/cake celebration. It was all good until we got the bill and we got charged for the very small slice of cake that no one requested. We were confused by this charge since we never requested it. When we told the server that we weren't going to pay for it since we never requested Â it we got treated differently. Won't name any names but I am sharing this story because IT IS NOT FAIR TO BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FOR STANDING UP FOR OUR SELVES WHEN WE NEVER REQUESTED THE SMALL SLICE OF CAKE. Listen, I've been to many restaurants when I request a birthday celebration and sometimes we get it without a charge. Sometimes we get it with a Â charge. And that's fine since we requested it.

We weren't super hungry so we ordered the grilled sourdough bread with butter and figs ($6) and the vodka sauce pizza with burrata ($16). I was expecting a little more from the bread for $6, the figs were simply fresh figs sliced in half and the butter was nothing to write home about, but it was tasty nonetheless. I had mixed feelings about the pizza - in a city filled with such delicious pizza I'm not sure this tops my list, but there was something nice and light about the crisp dough and light spread of vodka sauce.

Got a coffee based cocktail and then switched to Negronis which were out of a tap and were outrageously delicious. I would highly recommend it. Only problem was they were slightly expensive. If you're out on the west side and need a dinner spot before going out (and have money to spend) I would recommend this place, although I wouldn't go out of my way for it.

28,zMDt8a5ioHltwYlYnqznrw,Jess P.,4.0 star rating,"GET THE PIZZA. My biggest takeaways from my experience here were: the space is beautiful and aesthetically pleasing | the brunch menu is a little small so if you have a picky eater, probably not the best place to take them to and the portions are a little bit small for the price.I ordered the mimosa which could have been stronger but good nonetheless and the table ordered the burrata vodka pizza which is a MUST TRY (if you didn't get that from how I started my review). It was probably one of the better pizzas I've had and I could probably eat the whole pie alone. The cheese was so light and it paired well with the vodka sauce. For my main I got the fried egg and gigante beans which was served with bread and had a great bolognese sauce. I wouldn't normally order a dish like this but it was DELICIOUS. I loved the sauce, and surprisingly loved how well it went with the beans. Only complaint was, we had a pretty big party and we were stuck in a small-ish table even though we made reservations. We were told that they were expecting bigger parties, but they never came and we had to stare longingly at the bigger, empty tables around us.",Old Rose,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian
29,SC4C7rzKVfzFGci2C8ENWg,Shawn H.,4.0 star rating,"Going with four stars but wrestled between four and five -- the food here was really great, but the experience wasn't quite perfect.We got the sourdough bread, the vodka burrata pizza, the bucatini with bolognese, and the flourless chocolate cake for dessert. The bread was fine, but overly-buttered for my tastes. (I realize that most people will actually like that...) The pasta was truly outstanding -- the bucatini probably could have been very slightly more al dente, but the sauce was perfect, and they didn't completely cover the pasta with it, which was fantastic. (Reminded me more of an Italian sauce than an American one.) We also really liked the chocolate cake, which seemed like more of a milk chocolatey taste.The pizza was also very good -- it's a takeoff of Jon & Vinny's LA Woman pizza, which is one of my favorites of all-time, and this is a very good one as well. (I didn't like the vodka quite as much as Jon & Vinny's tomato sauce, but that is a very high bar.) The only real issue with the pizza is that it came out slightly cold, which was kind of a bummer. But the fact that I still liked it as much as I did is probably a good indicator of how good the cooking here is -- the bread, sauce, burrata, and structural integrity of the slices were all great, it just likely took too long to come out.And that's largely how I'd sum up our first visit -- the kitchen seemed to be far ahead of the rest of the operation. I generally am not a big stickler on service, except when it actually impacts the quality of the meal, which I thought it did here -- the timing between the dishes seemed off, the pizza was a little cold, it was often tough to get a refill on water, etc, all while the place wasn't totally full (we went late on a Saturday night). That said, the food was really great, and I'm dying to try the fusilli cacio e pepe, which was another pasta special and looked amazing. We'll definitely be back to give it another shot, and hopefully I can bump that four to a five.",Old Rose,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

The pizza is personal sized, but is also a great dish to share so you can try their other options. We had the brunch pizza which was amazinggg. There was only one egg on the brunch pizza to pop! the yolk. The cocktail selection was also very, very darling. I had their Breakfast Gin Martini and it was the perfect mix of alc and lemon.

The restaurant is warmly lit with tall valted ceilings and Art Deco stylings. We had 7:30 reservation and the place was bustling when we arrived. The menu was simple but interesting. Italian fare, with decent vegetarian options. We started with a crispy rice salad. It had a decent spice level with thin slices of jalepenos scattered throughout. Next we had a vodka pizza with burrata. The crust was extremely crisp, a little more so than my liking. But the choice of burrata instead of straight mozzarella gave it a creamy and indulgent taste. For entrees we both had pasta. My wife had a mushroom ragu over fusilli. I had the cavatelli with fennel sausage and broccoli rabe. Both were good but not great. Overall nice space and ambiance.

Here's my however: We came in a big group of grownups and casually mentioned my girlfriends little sisters 21st birthday. We drank, ordered food, had a great time. At the end of the night we were asked if we wanted to order dessert. Of course we said ""we will take a look at the menu"". After deciding on no dessert, out of nowhere, the birthday girl delivered a very small slice of chocolate cake with a candle on it. We were surprised since no one in the party requested a special treatment/cake celebration. It was all good until we got the bill and we got charged for the very small slice of cake that no one requested. We were confused by this charge since we never requested it. When we told the server that we weren't going to pay for it since we never requested Â it we got treated differently. Won't name any names but I am sharing this story because IT IS NOT FAIR TO BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FOR STANDING UP FOR OUR SELVES WHEN WE NEVER REQUESTED THE SMALL SLICE OF CAKE. Listen, I've been to many restaurants when I request a birthday celebration and sometimes we get it without a charge. Sometimes we get it with a Â charge. And that's fine since we requested it. But this time we never asked and still got charged. This is why I write this. Not cool, Old Rose.

It's a very pleasant spot to spend a couple hours, a lot of natural light and high ceilings and comfy enough booths. We weren't super hungry so we ordered the grilled sourdough bread with butter and figs ($6) and the vodka sauce pizza with burrata ($16). I was expecting a little more from the bread for $6, the figs were simply fresh figs sliced in half and the butter was nothing to write home about, but it was tasty nonetheless. I had mixed feelings about the pizza - in a city filled with such delicious pizza I'm not sure this tops my list, but there was something nice and light about the crisp dough and light spread of vodka sauce.

My friend ordered waffles, I ordered eggs. My friend's food was cold. My food was hot, means they just made it. The waitress was kind enough to offer us a comp item. So I started to feel a little better. We ordered the pizza. My friend and I sat there for about an hour. Then she got nauseous and basically ran out of the restaurant.

Yes, yes... it's very cute inside, but that's about all it has going for it.Upon coming home and checking my bank account, I saw that they had charged me twice - two different amounts. I reached out to my friend and she check her account as well... same thing had happened to her.The reason why I think their management is shady is because when I called to inquire about this mistake, the manager then told me ""oh yea, I was there when this accidentally happened . We charged another table on your card as well - it should resolve itself overnight and disappear from your account"". First, it did not ""disappear"" from our account and it still has not (going on day three). Second, and most importantly, why not give us a heads-up that this ""mistake"" happened? I can't help but find that very odd (and the main reason I am writing this review).He advised me to email his GM, which we did. We included screenshots of our bank accounts and asked her to please give us a call to correct the problem. After not hearing back, I decided to call and the restaurant where the hostess, who seemed very unimpressed and bored with the situation, told me the GM would be in soon and she would call... we'll see.So, if you decide to have a mediocre Italian dinner at this establishment, please check your bank accounts after... or just avoid all the potential drama and have a great meal at Rosemary's.",Old Rose,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian
