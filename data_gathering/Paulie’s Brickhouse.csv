Paulie's is probably the latest addition that has been sprinkled around town.Opening up about 2 months ago. I've visited a few times now. Once for drinks on a Friday evening & midweek for a dinner with the Mrs. Let's start with the good...9 large screen TV's are scattered around the bar area to catch your favorite sports team. Prices are very reasonable for both food & adult libations. Their pies are named after areas of JC. We ordered 2 pizzas, since they are a 12' variety. A downtown which had arugula, fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, parmigiana, drizzled with truffle oil & a fried egg. Also went with a Westside, a meat lovers pizza that had sausage, pepperoni & meatballs. Both were very good. Even came home with leftovers. :) Roughly 15 beers on draft, plus numerous other bottle options for $5. I stress this place is lite on the wallet.Now the not so good....Since it's so new, service can be a little spotty on the weekends. Hopefully they can work that out for the Friday to Sunday crowd that comes through here. Midweek doesn't seem to be that issue at all.

It's one of the only bars on Central so that's definitely a plus, and the drink prices are fair ($3 Bud Bottles and $6 wine). They are definitely taking the ""bar atmosphere"" concept seriously, blasting house music the entire time. The only food that they have is pizza and wings so we ordered 6 buffalo wings, a pepperoni bar pie and a margherita bar pie. The wings weren't bad, but they barely had any sauce on them. They didn't even really taste like buffalo wings. The pizza wasn't bad either but they didn't give us any condiments. When we asked for condiments a waitress brought us salt and pepper. We then specified that we meant pizza condiments and the girl grabbed them off of another table that was still eating. There were only about 8 people in the entire place, and later while we were eating the bartender took the condiments away from us while we still had pizza left, so it led us to believe they only have one set of condiments. It was hard to get the attention of the bartender and waitresses because they were on their phones a lot, but when you did finally get their attention they were very nice. They might just need to iron out some of these kinks because they do have potential.",Paulie’s Brickhouse,4.0 star rating,$$,"Beer, Bar,, Pizza"
6,qwZ5l6qTzUm1Z9YaayWNYg,Ed A.,2.0 star rating,"Summary: lots of growing pains...lots to improve upon.Anytime a new place opens in the Heights, my bias and subconscious immediately wants to love it. When you think of restaurants and bars in JC, you invariably think of Downtown, and I think the Heights could use a few good places of its own.I visited this place twice over the past month or so - the 1st time just for drinks, and the 2nd time for dinner on a Friday night around 8pm. For starters - the music was blaring, making it difficult to have a simple conversation. I asked someone if they could turn it down, and they said they would ask, but nothing happened.I ordered food around 750pm. Nothing extravagant; since their menu is very simple (which I like - in theory it makes preparation quicker), I went for 2 personal pizzas and an order of fried calamari. It took literally 50 minutes (I timed it) for the food to come out - both pizzas and the calamari came out together. That's simply unacceptable. Someone (manager? owner?) came out to apologize for the wait, stating they were short staffed that night.The calamari was crispy, but totally lacking in flavor. The veggie pizza was passable. The best of the 3 items was my margherita pizza. However, I could have gone next door to ole reliable Pizzamasters and gotten the same things much more quickly (and more deliciously). I gave them a 2 star rating only on account of growing pains / missing cooks that evening / my bias for Heights establishments. But I don't see how you can set up shop a stone's throw away from the best pizzeria in Jersey City and hope to compete with such a subpar offering.PS to the management - in Hoboken recently, a bartender accidentally charged me for someone else's tab. He apologized immediately and bought a round of drinks for me and my buddy for the inconvenience. That is how you handle inconveniences for customers: a free dessert, a free drink - anything other than ""oh sorry, we're really busy"".",Paulie’s Brickhouse,4.0 star rating,$$,"Beer, Bar,, Pizza"

8,t2RN0X5NuJ70qtYU7vu69w,Jenna B.,5.0 star rating,"Really great spot. I stopped in for a Pizza, the Margherita - it's called, The Heights on the menu. Wood Oven pizza is some of the best. Their sauce had great flavor too, which is important. The pie was cut in to 6 slices, I ate 2 and brought home the other 4 to my Boyfriend who gobbled it up. He loved it. If I had been super hungry, I could have easily downed the whole thing on my own. I do wish they had a few more topping options, or a build your own type of thing. My dream pizza is Pepperoni, Mushrooms and Jalapeńos. I know they are still adding things to the menu and I look forward to more to come. As for drinks, they've got the neighborhood beat for prices! $3/$4 shots, $7 for top shelf shots. That's unheard of! You're lucky to pay $7.00 for well shots in most places. $3-$6 Bottles & Drafts. $8-$10 Cocktails. I love that they are being so fair in prices, it's the kind of place you'll be happy to sit for a while. For less than $30 I got a pie that fed two, a mixed drink, a beer & a shot. I wanted to do a happy dance when I got my bill. The staff is lovely, friendly, genuinely caring and they made me feel so welcomed. When I walked in the door I was greeted with a warm and cheery, Hello - I think she was an owner or a Manager? I usually sit at the bar in places like this and the kid behind the bar was great - he stayed on top of my needs while he was busy doing several other things. That's how I like it.

10,fZtSnMecdr8_kuQLhx22xQ,Sneaky B.,1.0 star rating,"WARNING!!! DO NOT think about ORDERING TAKEOUT from Paulie's Brickhouse. For a new restaurant, you'd think they'd want to retain and gain new customers, not turn them away! First off, it took 2 different employees and 10 full minutes for them to take my order over the phone (a Chicken Parm sandwich and Pizza). When I returned home with my order, I sadly realized the sandwich was NOT what I ordered. I clearly stated over the phone that I wanted a Chicken Parm sandwich and what I got was a COLD chicken sandwich with wilted brown lettuce, stringy onions, 2 dots of mayo and floppy-ass bread.  I called and explained the situation and they graciously said they would honor a make-good and make me what I actually ordered. However, five minutes later as I was walking back in the rain to pick up the right order (they wouldn't deliver it), the girl who took my order had the NERVE to call back and proceeded to argue with me over what I ordered. They demanded that I pay full price if I wanted the correct sandwich - another fifteen bucks. I refused. So I am left with no dinner and 15 dollars out of my pocket. Seriously DISGUSTED at this thievery.  The pizza ain't bad but two doors down you can go to Pizza Masters for better food and service.  They were unprofessional, rude and unaccommodating. Customer service was a complete afterthought. You can get better service and hospitality at the McDonalds next door. Please train your staff to treat your customers with respect and keep them coming back. There's a reason why there was only one lonely man sitting at the bar!!!  NOTE:  My initial reaction of walking into the bar was COOL, this is a place I can see myself coming to regularly.  Unfortunately, instead of spreading the good pizza word I will neg this place any chance I get.",Paulie’s Brickhouse,4.0 star rating,$$,"Beer, Bar,, Pizza"

At other places, The waiter or waitress usually just brought out a bottle of ketchup for this kind of dish.  Very nice bar with relaxing atmosphere. Good place to have a brew and pizza.  We had a pie with pepperoni is pretty good too.  I did not think there was much of a difference between a brick and conventional pizza oven but there is.

They demanded that I pay full price if I wanted the correct sandwich - another fifteen bucks. I refused. So I am left with no dinner and 15 dollars out of my pocket. Seriously DISGUSTED at this thievery.  The pizza ain't bad but two doors down you can go to Pizza Masters for better food and service.  They were unprofessional, rude and unaccommodating. Customer service was a complete afterthought. You can get better service and hospitality at the McDonalds next door. Please train your staff to treat your customers with respect and keep them coming back. There's a reason why there was only one lonely man sitting at the bar!!!  NOTE:  My initial reaction of walking into the bar was COOL, this is a place I can see myself coming to regularly.  Unfortunately, instead of spreading the good pizza word I will neg this place any chance I get.",Paulie’s Brickhouse,4.0 star rating,$$,"Beer, Bar,, Pizza"
31,iGZ4KHfjLncVMxqGyfW9_g,Susan N.,2.0 star rating,"wow the worst brick oven pizza I ever had... first time I didn't eat pizza leftovers at home. At $14 per personal pie, that was doughy garbage with cheap ingredients... also, if you're going to be unique and offer peas on the pizza - DO NOT use frozen peas - are you kidding ??    And it doesn't smell good like a pizza place, it smells like Home Depot. Waitstaff seems disoriented and disorganized. Feels like a dive bar that serves bar pies. Was not a good new brick oven pizza restaurant as expected/advertised.",Paulie’s Brickhouse,4.0 star rating,$$,"Beer, Bar,, Pizza"

The waitresses, bartenders and ESPECIALLY the manager are very pleasant and attentive to the customers. The pizza is brick oven pizza and is excellent! The menu is expanding everyday and considering that they haven't had their official grand opening yet, i think they are doing a pretty good job and people need to cut them some slack. You know damn well when you go into a pizzeria they ALL share the condiments. It's NOT that serious. Let's see how much progress this bar makes after the grand opening. I'm sure it will be great!",Paulie’s Brickhouse,4.0 star rating,$$,"Beer, Bar,, Pizza"
35,IOsgBnvpvpFJvHx41WTbbw,Alex M.,4.0 star rating,"Visited tonight, Jan 26, my wife and I each had a burger which was $10 and fries which was $4.50.  It was good but I think $14.50 for a burger and a side of fries is a bit high.  Ketchup came in small containers which I cannot recall it ever being served that way to me. At other places, The waiter or waitress usually just brought out a bottle of ketchup for this kind of dish.  Very nice bar with relaxing atmosphere. Good place to have a brew and pizza.  We had a pie with pepperoni is pretty good too.  I did not think there was much of a difference between a brick and conventional pizza oven but there is. I  like the crunchiness of the crust from the brick oven.  Plenty of TVs to watch a game either at the bar or table.  Definitely will go back again.",Paulie’s Brickhouse,4.0 star rating,$$,"Beer, Bar,, Pizza"

I assume that's all they want and anticipate so their job has been done well.I hope they offer a vegan option on the food side other than french fries in the future. If you want to compete with other establishments in the area, you're going to have to. The good news is I really, really like my potatoes so I'm not complaining. They offer delicious ginger beer. It's the perfect mix of spicy and sweet. I'll have to come back for a cocktail.",Paulie’s Brickhouse,4.0 star rating,$$,"Beer, Bar,, Pizza"
