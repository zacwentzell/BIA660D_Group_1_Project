Five years ago, I went to Morimoto Philadelphia for the first time and fell in love. Fast forward five years and I am living in New York City so of course I HAD to go and visit Morimoto New York. This restaurant is hands down my favorite restaurant (and this is an understatement if possible).All I have to say is we FEASTED this time around at the New York location and I loved every single bite. Items we ordered included:1) Toro Tartare2) Yu-burrata with black truffles3) Crispy rock shrimp tempura - classic must get4) Oyster Foie gras - SO good, we had to order another order, unlike anything I've ever tasted before5) Hot stone A5 Wagyu beef - melt in your mouth deliciousness6) Kakuni (pork belly with 10 hour cooked porridge)7) Miso glazed roasted bone marrow -MUST8) Duck Duck Duck9) Braised Black Cod - needed 5 plates for myself10) Pea Shoots with XO sauce11) Chef's combo assorted sushi platter - also melt in your mouth deliciousness12) Dessert- Fiery Chocolate tart, milk chocolate key lime pie, and tofu cheesecake (all three were recommended by server)I recommend everything at this restaurant!!

1,-HeNMooYCVQuWV8GQ1Zg0g,Jasmine R.,2.0 star rating,"I'm going to sound crazy, but this place is not worth the price. For what I pay for 9 pieces of sushi I can get twice as much for a third of the price WITHOUT sacrificing the quality by going to my regular sushi spot. The ambiance is beautiful and the service is great but the price of food here for someone who's a foodie is over the top for food that is mediocre at best. 45$ for a shot of tequila? 26$ for ramen soup? 13$ for a single scoop of sorbet?! No thank you. I've been three times and third times a charm In the sense that it has solidified that I will not be back. But if you want the experience it is exactly that, I will be keeping my money in places where when I leave I'm full",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
2,xzMvA6gPvSx6xZlUaD291w,Jacqueline X.,2.0 star rating,"Overall: heavy and salty American-adjusted and overrated Japanese cuisine.My greatest issue with them is the food came really slow. We waited for almost 30mins and all our food came at one time. And they serve cold and hot foods together, which I found really unprofessional in a Japanese restaurant. We spent $200 for the LUNCH. Toro tartar 2.5/5 : I seemed to expect to much about this signature dish... it is a thin layer of mince toro, and the texture of toro is not outstanding (might because they're too minced). The dipping sauces came with the toro are too light. Rock shrimp tempura 2/5 : I though it would be the regular tempura but turned to be very different. It is deep fried shrimps coated with 2 different sauce. Too much sauce and flavors, and why offer ranch dipping sauce it is not bbq wings...Chef's combo sashimi 3/5: the sea snail and salmon in them are great, especially the sea snail( u don't get to see them at every Japanese restaurant) the rest are just ok.Eel&froie gras bop 2/5: rice with bits of eel, froie gras and advocating served on hot stone pot. $27 is too much for such a dish.  I can understand froie gras is expensive so you only have few grams of it, but they were really stingy about the eel and the advocado. The eel sauce is to salty. Black cod with rice: my bf has it and he think it was under expectation.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

My friend and I both had some issues finding the restaurant as Google Maps shows that it is located inside Chelsea Market; in reality, it is in the same warehouse as Chelsea Market but it has its own entrance. Luckily I called the restaurant and they picked up right away and were able to direct us to the location of the restaurant. I was really impressed by the decor of the restaurant. Part of the decoration includes a lit wall made from clear glass bottles which really gives the restaurant a classy, fine dining look to it. And this is a bit of an odd thing to comment on, but I really liked the chopsticks they gave us? They were clear hard plastic but not too weighty, and once again, they just looked and felt so classy. Our server was very attentive and courteous in explaining everything on the menu and if we needed anything, he was always around to help us without us having to wait too long. For restaurant week, you can order a set which comes with salad, miso soup, and cucumber pickles and finally a dessert. I ordered the sashimi set which came with 10 pieces of chef's selection sushi. Omakase in the city usually costs a pretty penny, but for $29, I was able to get omakase, plus a salad, soup, cucumber pickles, and a dessert - ie not bad!The sashimi set was good, but I don't think the sashimi pieces I received were anything unique or special. I was disappointed to not see salmon in the set (I know I said I was looking for unique sashimi pieces, but come on, salmon is a staple!) I was however, impressed by the dessert I ordered. I ordered the shiro choko, which is a dessert made of white chocolate cream, passion yuzu sorbet, marble meringue and sesame chocolate soil. Not only was it a very pretty dish, it tasted amazing too! It was packed full of flavor and surprisingly, none of the flavors clashed with each other. I also liked the different textures in the dish from the creamy sorbet to the crunch of the sesame chocolate soil. It was a refreshing and light dessert and the perfect way to conclude our service.

12,phywUldtF0U44_LQ8KLAeQ,Annie L.,4.0 star rating,"Went here for date night with the boyfriend. We were indecisive and couldn't choose between Morimoto or Nobu, but ultimately chose Morimoto because I love me some iron chef (it's true).Whoever designed this place....can I please hazz your numba??? Because literally that was the topic of our conversation (among other things) the entire night. From the backsplash of the bar made of plastic bottles stacked upon another to the room divider in the main room made of (yet again) plastic bottles, to the bathroom stall that completely tripped me out....they clearly know how to decorate the place under a budget while still executing quite a presentation.On to the food....we ordered the sashimi appetizer which was beautifully presented but lacked actual FOOD. We finished that easily. My favorite was the chirashi bowl. It was filled with so much sashimi that I couldn't even finish it---and I finish EVERYTHING mind you. I also ordered the barracuda (meh, pass) and the salmon inure (meh, pass). My boyfriend ordered the surf and tuff (LOVEEEEEE THIS!) complete with hanger steak and hamachi. YUM. As for the drinks, you can't go wrong with the MoriMATCHA if you loveeeeee matcha like me. Or the Morimotini which isn't cloyingly sweet...wasn't sweet at all period. It was perfection. I loved it all.I'd give it a solid 5 stars was it not for our lacking service. Seriously, the bartender was SO ON POINT. The moment we were sat, our waitress completely ruined our experience. She was slow, sluggish almost, and sort of killed our mood. Other than that....come here for amazing food and fantastic drinks---just go straight to the bar :)",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The lunch specials are very affordable (~$30 for a set that comes with soup and salad on the side). The food doesn't look that filling bc it's Japanese style, but don't be fooled!! We got the bulgogi lunch set and the 3-roll sushi set. Loved both, one was just as equally tasty as the other. Really glad that the eel in my sushi was fresh and sweet. For dessert we had the infamous chocolate fireball (trust me, it's not that special once the fire goes out, but the choco is to die for)! Lovely place overall. Would like to come back for dinner if I can afford it - hahaha.

14,1-6AY2anFQYgcuEChFse-Q,Christine H.,4.0 star rating,"I came here on a date night with my husband on a Saturday night. The restaurant is classy and elegant and was packed. We had eaten our way through the city so we ended up ordering a couple of appetizers and a roll. I knew I wanted to get the toro tartare. Then we decided on the hot stone waygu, crispy rock shrimp tempura, and the soft shell crab roll. The toro tartare came out first. It was everything I hoped for and more. The caviar and the various dippers on the side were perfection. The presentation was beautiful. After we finished our tartare, we had a 30 minute wait before our next item came out. Although we had to wait, they brought out a complimentary dish to make up for it. It was a whitefish with shavings of truffle on top. It definitely helped me forget about the wait we had. The crispy rock shrimp tempura was fine, nothing special. It was prepared in two different sauces. I preferred the spicy gochujang. It was served with a home made ranch sauce on the side. The hot stone waygu was delicious. It was so tender and because we cooked it on our own, I could make it exactly the way I like - medium rare.  We ended our meal with the soft shell crab roll. It was one of the best soft shell crab rolls I have had. The crab was flavorful and perfectly crispy. It was a perfect end to our night.The service was great. The food was excellent. It is a bit pricey, but I would gladly come back to try some other things on the menu.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The interior of the restaurant is very elegantly decorated. A hell of an interior designer involved I'm sure.The ingredients are very fresh and worth every penny. We ordered the sashimi set, which has 10 pics of sashimi (5 types) and the very popular hot stone wagyu where the beef is cooked on your table on a hot river stone! I would also highly recommend their desserts. I tried the Nama tofu. It tastes like a cheese cake, but is made of tofu with coffee and chocolate flavored sauce and green onions on the top that made it look like a savory Asian tofu dish. It was such an experience and would highly recommend this place for a weekday lunch!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
16,oWtZSiJLuipULfKuhXHBag,Melody P.,5.0 star rating,"I am not over exaggerating when I say this was one of the best restaurants we've been to for Japanese food. The three things that I ate/LOVED was the hot stone wagyu, soft shell crab roll & toro tartare. The flavor and texture of the wagyu was perfect. The soft shell crab roll didn't have imitation crab (almost every restaurant I go to adds that and I don't like it), but it did have masago, avocado & cucumber which I love. I normally don't eat raw fish unless it's fresh and the toro tartare was exactly that! It was so good with the dipping sauces that came with it. I wouldn't say that this restaurant is unreasonably priced, it's about $3-5 more than other places that I've been to for sushi so the quality of everything justifies the price.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The service is great here. I always like going for an early dinner around 5pm to avoid the crowds. The decor is modern luxury but definitely bring your phone light because it's dim. The tuna tartare is a must try. It's served on a vertical plate where you have to scrape it off. You have to see pictures to understand lol.

I ordered the miso cod and my bf ordered the sushi. My bf liked the sushi just fine. I liked the cod, though it was not as good as nobu's, but it came with hard and cold rice. As a (lazy) Asian, I know what day old rice tastes like and they didn't even have the courtesy of microwaving it. It was hard and ""crusty"" in a way that freshly made rice is not. For a higher end restaurant, especially a sushi restaurant, I expected better. Service was friendly but very slow. Also dishes were introduced in a very rushed way. Just ""this is sushi"" and then done. Like, I know it's sushi? The dessert was lovely, though. Passion fruit sorbet atop of fluffy white chocolate and sesame chocolate.

We were indecisive and couldn't choose between Morimoto or Nobu, but ultimately chose Morimoto because I love me some iron chef (it's true).Whoever designed this place....can I please hazz your numba??? Because literally that was the topic of our conversation (among other things) the entire night. From the backsplash of the bar made of plastic bottles stacked upon another to the room divider in the main room made of (yet again) plastic bottles, to the bathroom stall that completely tripped me out....they clearly know how to decorate the place under a budget while still executing quite a presentation.On to the food....we ordered the sashimi appetizer which was beautifully presented but lacked actual FOOD. We finished that easily. My favorite was the chirashi bowl. It was filled with so much sashimi that I couldn't even finish it---and I finish EVERYTHING mind you. I also ordered the barracuda (meh, pass) and the salmon inure (meh, pass). My boyfriend ordered the surf and tuff (LOVEEEEEE THIS!) complete with hanger steak and hamachi. YUM. As for the drinks, you can't go wrong with the MoriMATCHA if you loveeeeee matcha like me. Or the Morimotini which isn't cloyingly sweet...wasn't sweet at all period. It was perfection. I loved it all.I'd give it a solid 5 stars was it not for our lacking service. Seriously, the bartender was SO ON POINT. The moment we were sat, our waitress completely ruined our experience. She was slow, sluggish almost, and sort of killed our mood. Other than that....come here for amazing food and fantastic drinks---just go straight to the bar :)",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The lunch specials are very affordable (~$30 for a set that comes with soup and salad on the side). The food doesn't look that filling bc it's Japanese style, but don't be fooled!! We got the bulgogi lunch set and the 3-roll sushi set. Loved both, one was just as equally tasty as the other. Really glad that the eel in my sushi was fresh and sweet. For dessert we had the infamous chocolate fireball (trust me, it's not that special once the fire goes out, but the choco is to die for)! Lovely place overall.

We had eaten our way through the city so we ended up ordering a couple of appetizers and a roll. I knew I wanted to get the toro tartare. Then we decided on the hot stone waygu, crispy rock shrimp tempura, and the soft shell crab roll. The toro tartare came out first. It was everything I hoped for and more. The caviar and the various dippers on the side were perfection. The presentation was beautiful. After we finished our tartare, we had a 30 minute wait before our next item came out. Although we had to wait, they brought out a complimentary dish to make up for it. It was a whitefish with shavings of truffle on top. It definitely helped me forget about the wait we had. The crispy rock shrimp tempura was fine, nothing special. It was prepared in two different sauces. I preferred the spicy gochujang. It was served with a home made ranch sauce on the side. The hot stone waygu was delicious. It was so tender and because we cooked it on our own, I could make it exactly the way I like - medium rare.  We ended our meal with the soft shell crab roll. It was one of the best soft shell crab rolls I have had. The crab was flavorful and perfectly crispy. It was a perfect end to our night.The service was great. The food was excellent.

We ordered the sashimi set, which has 10 pics of sashimi (5 types) and the very popular hot stone wagyu where the beef is cooked on your table on a hot river stone! I would also highly recommend their desserts. I tried the Nama tofu. It tastes like a cheese cake, but is made of tofu with coffee and chocolate flavored sauce and green onions on the top that made it look like a savory Asian tofu dish.

The three things that I ate/LOVED was the hot stone wagyu, soft shell crab roll & toro tartare. The flavor and texture of the wagyu was perfect. The soft shell crab roll didn't have imitation crab (almost every restaurant I go to adds that and I don't like it), but it did have masago, avocado & cucumber which I love. I normally don't eat raw fish unless it's fresh and the toro tartare was exactly that! It was so good with the dipping sauces that came with it. I wouldn't say that this restaurant is unreasonably priced, it's about $3-5 more than other places that I've been to for sushi so the quality of everything justifies the price.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

As a (lazy) Asian, I know what day old rice tastes like and they didn't even have the courtesy of microwaving it. It was hard and ""crusty"" in a way that freshly made rice is not. For a higher end restaurant, especially a sushi restaurant, I expected better. Service was friendly but very slow. Also dishes were introduced in a very rushed way.

For dessert we had shiro choko and soba hana. If you do not like the raw wheat taste, soba hana might taste weird to you. As for shiro choko, the sourness of the sorbet and the sweetness of sesame chocolate creates an interesting balance. I would give the overall taste, quality, and presentation of the food 4.5 stars.[Service] We booked in advance for a weekday lunch, but still waited for 5-10 minutes.

I heard great things about Morimoto and wanted to see what all the hype was about. Unfortunately, my experience here was pretty poor.I came here for restaurant week lunch and I think the worst part of the meal was the service. The food we got was decent (nothing too special) - I wound up getting the 10 pc sashimi and the shiro choko dessert - but the service was really poor. First of all, we waited an hour for our sashimi dish which was absolutely unacceptable. We allotted a good amount of time (1.5 hours) for the meal which has been a perfect amount of time for every other restaurant week where there are three courses (this one only has two because the sides come with the main), but we nearly missed a meeting afterwards because of this delay. Nobody really came to check in on us throughout the meal either - I had to ask for water numerous times and check on our food several times as well.If the service were better, I'd probably give Morimoto a 3 or 3.5 because it's definitely not worth the price normally, but the service was extremely subpar so unfortunately I think a 2 star rating is warranted here.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The restaurant is beautiful with its modernized, nautical ambiance in a venue spacious enough where patrons could dine in peace. The staff are delightful, and the food was fresh, creative, and delicious (highlights for me were the chirashi and seared ahi & mizune salad), and they also offer a vegetarian menu, for those of you who don't eat seafood. Morimoto, your food did not disappoint. However, I would have to give major kudos to how amazing the staff were. I came with my family, and we got into a really dramatic argument (we're dysfunctional but love each other; don't worry), with someone leaving the table mid-way through. When she returned, our waiter gave her complimentary serenity tea (!!). At the end of our meal, the manager (I believe) came by to make sure we were doing alright, & offered us a dessert menu. We were indecisive, so he disappeared and shortly returned with complimentary mochi balls. Thank you to the Morimoto team for feeding us incredible food & looking out after us. Especially given how stressed our party was, we genuinely appreciated all the small yet heartwarming gestures.

The inside decoration is pretty good and it was quiet at lunchtime on a weekday as there were just a few people at this time.  Services were very nice. Waiters were polite and ready for your order at any time. We (2 people) ordered a sashimi set and the hot stone wagyu which we can cook the beef by ourselves. There were 10 pieces of sashimi with 2 pics of each type. The meat of the sashimi is very fresh and delicious. The hot stone wagyu is special and the beef tastes good. The only problem is the stone is not hot enough after a while, so we may need to spend a little more time to heat it and the scene is not so amazing. We also order the Nama tofu as our dessert. The taste is very soft, like the combination of cheesecake and tofu, but it tastes more like the former one, although it is made of tofu. With the chocolate sauce at the bottom, the taste of this dessert is perfect. It is impressive because of its Asian ingredients and western flavor.The price of the weekday lunch is not too expensive and it is worthy to have a lunch in weekdays for such fantastic experience and taste!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

First of, the location is right next to Chelsea Market which makes the area busy but definitely puts you in the right mood to experience a good lunch or dinner.Service upon entry was very good with someone checking us in and another taking our coats almost immediately despite being very busy at the time. The area is elegantly decorated with a modern flair with a bright, crystalline theme. We also noticed how the tables are separated with a thick glass divider which helped give a measure of privacy during your meal while still feeling connected to the ambience of the rest of the restaurant. Our server was fast, attentive but not at all intrusive.On to the important stuff though - the food! We ordered the Braised Black Cod, and the Sashimi, with the Wagyu Carpaccio as an appetizer. Finished it off with the Shiro Choko for dessert. The star of the show was definitely the Wagyu Carpaccio. It was extremely tender, very flavorful, beautifully marinated but not overwhelmingly so. Could very easily have finished off another order. Not far behind was the Cod. Nicely cooked, it was soft and had the mouth melting texture you want from seafood. It was extremely good. The sashimi was good and solid as well, with the pieces of salmon and tuna nice and fresh and other accompanying pieces ranging from octopus to mackerel. The dessert rounded out the meal very nicely. After the meal, we all had that nice feeling of being very satisfied but not sickly stuffed.I really enjoyed my time at Morimoto and would love to come back for a full dinner here in the future.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

From the chic interior to friendly service to obviously delicious and well presented food, this is a place to bring someone to impress. For apps, we got the wagyu which was fun to cook on the table, and the bone marrow. GET THE BONE MARROW. Not many reviews mentioned this but it is absolutely delicious. For mains, we got two Maki rolls and the duck. I'm sure any roll at this place will be great so you can't go wrong. The duck was good but a bit awkward to eat with their bread. I think it would be better if they cut the duck and bread into smaller pieces to make them more like sliders so that it's easier to eat. Got the flaming chocolate ball as dessert. This definitely is a crowd pleaser as it ignites into a tall flame that burns blue for a few seconds before it melts the chocolate. The taste however wasn't great as the chocolate tasted low quality and the alcohol used to ignite totally overpowered the dish. Good to get once to see the effect but wouldn't get it again for taste.

With the massive volume necessary to meet demand, it more often means sacrificing quality for the sake of efficiency. Despite that there are also gems that can be found. The entrees were average with the dry-aged burger being the standout option thanks to flavorful and juicy beef patty sandwiched by a sweet nori infused bun with a perfect hint of milk. The desserts were the highlight of the menu and three-and-half of the four stars in this review belongs to the two creative and delicious offerings on the RW17 menu. The first choice, shiro choko, was a spectacular blend of a smooth, white chocolate cream base contrasted with a mildly tart passion fruit yuzu sorbet. The marble meringue wafer was a big hit amongst the millennials of the group, and the giant glass serving bowl was a great touch. The second choice was a light yoghurt parfait, named the azuki hana, glazed with a layer of sake jelly. The blueberry, strawberries, and mochi infused in the jelly gave this beautiful dessert a ""flowery"" presentation.Executive pastry chef Natsume's dessert creations are worth coming for alone and that was probably our biggest takeaway from our RW2017 visit.

I have wanted to come here for quite some time now, however the price point was always intimidating for this poor little church mouse  so when restaurant week finally came around I had to book reservations. The inside of this place is amazing it's big and spacious (two floors) and the interior design is nicely done. It has a nice and elegant design with a modern spin to it, I like it a lot! Our waiter, as well as the rest of the staff, was really nice and very professional, as well as very tentative. Sadly I didn't get his name, so I can't give him a proper shout out, but he was great. Now let's get to the most important part...the bathroom! Haha just kidding. The food here is really good. I ordered the sashimi and my friend got their beef burger. I like that their lunch sets comes with a salad, a couple of small side dishes, and soup. The side dishes were pretty delicious and I thought they were flavored nicely.  I really likedthe dressing on top of the salad, I think it was some type of sesame or ginger flavoring. Also the miso soup wasn't salty and the tofu inside wasn't bland. Hooray!Now getting to the main course...that sashimi was some of the freshest fish that I've ever eaten. It was velvety and not ridiculously chewy, safe for the octopus, which I wasn't the biggest fan of. My friend's burger was pretty good, in my opinion, but she wasn't too impressed by it but she still enjoyed her meal overall, we both did. The desserts were also really good and the design was very pretty. I liked the combination of the white chocolate cream and the passion fruit sorbet. They were definitely a nice balance because passionfruit is a very strong flavor by itself. And the parfait was good as well, very light and not too sweet. Overall food was great!The only thing is because it gets so busy, do expect to wait a bit when it comes to getting your check and getting it back in order sign it, if you're paying with card, but it's not the end of the world.P.s The bathroom is really cool by the way.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Omg). We were able to make reservations the day of at 5:30pm when the restaurant opened. We figured that it would be enough time to have dinner and then go to our Broadway show at 8pm. There is complimentary coat check when you walk in and also a downstairs bar/lounge area. I love the glass (?) bottle wall in the middle of the restaurant and the open kitchen/sushi bar.  What I liked most about Morimoto compared to other Japanese (""$$$$"") restaurants I've been to is there is a wide variety of sushi, sashimi, and hot/cold appetizers and entrees. For starters we ordered the toro tartare and this was probably the best fish tartare that I've ever had. The toro literally melted in my mouth and who knew sour cream would pair so well with toro?! Not to mention the presentation was so pretty. Next, we had the wagyu carpaccio which was also melt-in-your-mouth tender. Although it was good, it didn't blow my mind like the next dish: Grilled eel with foie gras. Holy crap, I had no idea a dish like this existed but I'm so glad that it does - and it's at Morimoto. I love unagi, and paired with foie gras and the lemon and pears on the side, it's truly a luxury. I savored every single bite! The foie gras was also huge - way bigger than the eel and we were struggling to finish it before our next course. I was surprised they offered such a big piece of foie gras. For entrees, we had the surf and turf, which came with hamachi ribbons, wagyu, and a hashbrown - random, but pretty good. I would pass on the surf and turf, the wagyu was a bit overcooked even though we asked for medium rare, and the hamachi was covered in what tasted like guacamole. On the other hand, we ordered the black cod, which was very flavorful. I think Nobu is still my #1 in terms of flavor and softness of the black cod, but Morimoto does it pretty well. I wish there were more options for dessert, but they did give us a complimentary dessert to celebrate our ""monthiversary""; which we finished in less than a minute because we were already cutting it close to our showtime!

The staff was not as attentive as they use to be. It took several attempts to get our waiter's attention and I noticed that when a new table is seated, the tables are wiped with a towel. Is that even sanitary? I ordered similar things this time. Tuna tartar was still good as I last remembered, but the sukiyaki was average. The desserts were disappointing. The highlight of the meal was the rock shrimp appetizer that I ordered. Came in two flavors with dipping sauce. That isn't saying much since the appetizer should not overcome the main entree's. My last visit was last year in August when it was less busy. Perhaps this time around during Valentine's Day they were understaffed? Who knows.

68,5HeSZTymh8AZh6h1vzwxRQ,Caroline K.,4.0 star rating,"I have to write all of this down before I forget.Most importantly, I have wanted to try this restaurant for literally almost a decade.  I remember I first found out about it when I was a wee little college freshman through posh friends who went to expensive art schools and were funded extensively through their trust fund parents, an unfortunate circumstance unbefitting to my own life since I couldn't afford such a dinner.  And then of course add the plethora of amazing NYC restaurants/fine dining/romantic dinners and Morimoto promptly gets placed on the backburner.Fast forward a decade, here I am, baby! I was a little afraid the place would've been played out by now, fearful that the menus would be replaced by some fusion-esque attempt resulting in equal measures of horror and disappointment.  But it wasn't!  Woohoo!The restaurant is beautiful, no doubt, but I've been to so many beautiful posh dining restaurants in NYC that it's just another dime to me at this point.  The atmosphere is a bit douchey if I do say so myself (Meatpacking, I guess) and I overheard people saying how the sushi bar is the prime spot for seating.  Hrm.We did the chef omakase tasting (hey, you only live once) and it was divine.  Absolutely divine.  It's not cheap ($140/pp) but it's worth every single bite.  Seriously, I'm still craving the courses.We also split the oyster with foie gras and uni as an appetizer....MAN.I won't go too much into detail about the 7 courses, but my personal favorites were of course the nigiri set (DUHHHHH), the egg custard served in a steaming glass chock full of uni, dashi and eel (OMG), the wagyu beef with shishito peppers and mushroom served atop a steaming stone slab so that the meat cooks perfectly, the little sample tasting of the toro tartare with creme fraiche and caviar (I need to come back for the full size set for this, this was just pure foodgasm at its finest), and my absolute favorite, the yuzu sorbet as a palate cleanser so we'd have a blank slate for the nigiri.Seriously, what is life?",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

You know it's good when you give a 5 star yelp review while in your uber on the way home. The restaurant is modern, has an open floor plan, and the seating feels private because there's an adequate amount of spaces between each of the tables. We had a booth and it was very cozy with enough space for everyone. Even when the restaurant got busy it didn't get loud. Our waiter was knowledgeable, patient, and equipped enough to guide us through the menu. The food was brought out in a timely & considerate manner. For each course when you finish, your table is cleaned and your utensils are changed. This is a beautiful form of detail displayed by the staff there.We tried the cult favorites for appetizers: The oysters & foie gras, grilled wagyu skewers,  the bone marrow, the toro tartare (pictured) and the rock shrimp tempura. All of the mentioned courses were cooked and flavored perfectly.For my entree I had the surf & turf. First of all the wagyu meat had the texture of BUTTER. It completely just melted in my mouth and was so unbelievable. It came with a side of tuna ribbons which complemented the steak perfectly and came in a delicious avocado sauce. The birthday boy's entree was the sushi platter which came with about 18 pieces altogether. The sashimi tasted like it was caught 5 minutes before it was served. When you eat sushi, the freshness is important and Morimoto absolutely serves up some the freshest fish and seafood I've ever had to date. Sushi lovers: this place is for YOU ! For dessert we had the yuzu flan, the chocolate mousse, and the japanese cheesecake. I could go on and on. Thank you, Morimoto!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Luckily I didn't mind going to Morimoto because the food here is fantastic!Walking into the restaurant on a Saturday night felt like a scene from Sex and the City when the ladies would check out a new restaurant. Yes I know Morimoto isn't new by any means, but that's the atmosphere here. I loved the chill music playing in the background, and the beautiful light display in the center of the restaurant. We were able to grab a drink downstairs before being seated at our table. I liked that we were seated slightly higher up towards the right of the restaurant. Gave us a little more privacy. Our server was amazing. He was friendly and attentive, and also very knowledgeable about the restaurant. DrinksThey have a very extensive drink menu which be were very happy about. We got to try 2 of the specialty cocktails here before dinner and they were great. I loved the White Lily, and my bf's Sukotto was good too. Nice amount of heat to the drink without being over the top. We ordered a carafe of saki with dinner and it was the perfect accompaniment to our meal. FoodMy bf decided to forgo the omakase so we ordered a couple things off the menu. -Toro tartare...There's a reason you see tons of pictures online. That's because its delicious! And that's coming from someone that doesn't usually like sushi. Presentation is A++ too-Rock Shrimp tempura...I liked that it came prepared with 2 different sauces and wasn't heavy on the breading, although I liked the spicy sauce better than the wasabi one-Ramen...incredibly flavorful broth, and not overly salty! Mmmmm-Braised Black Cod....this dish transported me back to Hawaii and one of my favorite dishes I ate there. It wasn't exactly the same, but it was pretty darn close. The flavor is unreal-Duck Duck Duck...My bf wasn't too happy with the sandwich portion, but we both agreed that the roasted duck was awesome. Nice and crispy on the outside.-Eggplant side dish...special side of the evening. We were trying to figure out how it was prepared because it was so good! Tender and seasoned with some delicious toppingI know there are countless restaurants in NYC, but I'd happily come back here in a heartbeat.

She summarized things quite well with very concise wordings.Their seafood options are all very good, although I'd say the tuna tartare was waaay smaller than I have expected (from looking at the other Yelp pictures), I would still recommend it just for its looks/check off since it is very nicely presented.Their WAGYU BEEF CAPRICCIO was amazingly tender and juicy, MUST try. We also ordered their spicy king crab, wagyu on hot stone - where you can cook yourself (8 seconds on each side for medium rare), uni, a lychee cocktail and yuzu cocktail with sake.Last but not least we also tried their Duck Duck Duck, it's sort of like a Peking Duck style.

Chef Morimoto is one of my heroes so anything he is involved in, I will give it a try with all my heart. So writing this review breaks my heart a little bit. Here is what you need to know about Morimoto:1. It's not the best sushi place in Manhattan. If you want a great omakase, there are other places that I would recommend first.2. Reservations are highly necessary at any party size.3. The staff don't really understand that they're talking about which can lead to some miscommunication.4. The toro tartare is the most worth-it dish from the appetizer perspective.5. Overall, the sashimi was not that impressive. The waygu beef was the best part of it, which is saying something.6. The fiery chocolate tart is a unique dessert worth getting.7. Solid cocktails but that doesn't make up for the overall mediocre sushi.If you're going to drop the cash, I would recommend other places.

The Australian wagyu was delicious. I loved the sauce that it came with. Recommend you to try but did not top the list. Toro tartare is good but not one of my favorites. It is a favorite amongst my friends. The hot stone wagyu is on the same page as the toro tartare. The meat is served raw on the side and you cook it on the hot stone.

102,vWgl5edtHyFzBKUFsSoFMQ,Bren W.,5.0 star rating,"My friend and I decided to come to Morimoto for restaurant week, and it was the best decision ever. We got the earliest reservation possible, right when they opened and were able to witness the start of the day serenity. By the time we finished lunch, the restaurant was packed to the brim with many others waiting in line to get in. The food was fantastic. We both got the wagyu burger (who in the world gets a burger in an esteemed Japanese restaurant, right), but it was one of the best decisions ever. The photos may make it look like any old burger, but the toppings and sauce gave it such a wonderful and unique twist that I can still recall the taste as I'm writing the review. We also had sides of chips and miso soup. Our meal was wonderfully wrapped up by one of the most delicious desserts I've ever had too!Our server was so nice and understanding when we took forever to decide what we had wanted to eat, was very lighthearteded when he joked with us about what the reviews on yelp say, and was very helpful with recommendations. During our meal, a manager came to our table (and all other tables too) to ask how our meal was and to thank us for choosing them for restaurant week. This blew my mind because I felt like I was being treated just like any other customer (and not just a restaurant week-er) because I've had experiences in other restaurants where I was treated rudely because I only went for restaurant week.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Granted it was early on a Sunday so when we arrived around 6pm, it was empty. By 7...packed.Yes, Morimoto is super pricey but you pay for the overall experience. The restaurant is sleek and very cook, the fish is incredibly fresh, service is excellent, and the toilet seats are heated...figured I'd throw that in there because it's an awesome perk.Anyway, we ordered the oyster fois gras and beef tartar to start and both were excellent. We also got a few rolls - spicy tuna, salmon, California, and toro. The rolls were awesome except the toro but we were able to swap it for yellowtail jalapeño, a much better choice. We paired it with some sake, obviously, but warming: no hot sake served here, only cold.Also, the cheesecake soufflé is a great dessert choice.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I'll just focus on the decor, service and food.What we had- Toro Tartare - OMG. This was sooooo freakin' good. My friends and I shared everything we ordered, so I didnt have much. I wanted to grab it and run off. Its tuna tartare spread out on a glass flat dish, with condiments. Yum, Yum, Yum. - Tuna Pizza with olives, anchovy aoile, and jalapeño. Until last year I didn't eat raw fish at all. I was missing out!!! You can expect that fish at Morimoto to be of the freshest. The flavors were right on. - Pork Gyoza - Oh you know I can't go anywhere without ordering some sort of dumpling. It was tasty, but I expected more. If I go again, No, when I go again, I'd skip this dish because while its tasty, its too filling, and I'd rather get like my OWN Toro Tartare :). - Tofu Miso Soup - Its a great miso soup, but I'm not sure why I ordered soup. Another thing that filled me up, that was good, but less good than other food I had.- Sushi roll - don't remember which one we had, but the regular roles are just not memorable. Plain sushi, nothing special. Not particularly better than your regular sushi joints.- Duck Duck Duck, the dishes were tasty and delicious. Duck isn't my favorite, it was a friends dish and I tasted it. - Braised Black Cod - food orgasm. This was so good, I was ooh'ing and ah'ing at every bite. The ginger soy reduction was amazing, and did not overpower the taste of the dish. They could have given me 4 of these, and I would have polished off my plate. Even those little tiny beans on the plate  had this interesting sweetness to it.  On to dessert:We ordered the cheesecake, and a white chocolate with passion fruit dessert. The cheesecake was just good, but the other was out of this world. We got the flaming chocolate dessert on the house! That was also incredible, but I do find chocolate to be too much for me after a big meal. They fire it up at the table, and it makes it really exciting. Drinks: I don't know what my drink was called but it was a cayenne infused drink. I love some spiciness in my beverage. Service was amazing. The waiter was attentive. They were always there when needed, but not too intrusive. Impeccable service. Great decor. There are so many decor photos on this page, no need for me to post any.

We had the last lunch appointment (not last patrons in the place). The waiter came over and seemed like he was ready to go before he said hello. Never introduced him self, did not talk about the menu - just came over and asked what do you want to order? In any case we order a roll to start off (I skipped breakfast for this!) and our meals. I know they were closing soon but geese the food came out in 10 mins with the rolls. I got the soft shell crab with noodles and my friend got the black cod. The bus boy came over with the food ""who has this cod?"" and just kind of gave us our food to fend for our selves. I was so wrapped up in talking with my friend I started eating my noodles and complain how bland they are. Quickly realizing there was a broth on the side to pour into the noodles. A place like this, I would think they would pour it in for you at the table side or at least point out everything on your tray when serving, which neither happened.

I had the short rib it was ok at best.. expect to walk out hungry as the portion was small. The meat was literally one slice of short rib the size of half my palm. However, if your food is just ""ok"" at least perfect your service. Our server was rude to the table next to us- granted they were two young girls that might have been a little annoying but it made me uncomfortable to sit there and watch the server treat them the way they were treated- those two girls were shocked by how they were treated as well. I was also served two of the same desserts when I ordered the Soba Hana and the Choko but were given two Choko. I told this to the food runner who brought them out and asked him to take back one since it was incorrect but he refused and said to keep both and he would bring the correct one--- it never happened. Instead I was given my check and rushed out. I just laughed at the situation as I didn't even feel like arguing or bringing it to anyone's attention after witnessing the awkward service next to my table.

I came during restaurant week and ordered the sushi & maki combo. All the side dishes were over-salted and the sushi rice was undercooked and ruined the taste of the raw rice. Sure I came fairly early at 12:30, but that's not a good enough excuse to undercook your sushi rice. I would've rather waited longer for better sushi. I know usually it's the helpers that cook the rice, but it doesn't hurt to taste it before serving it to customers who pay $10-20 for one single nigiri. Also, the maki roll had too many sesame seeds to the point it was overwhelming. The table to my side saw what I was given and asked the waitress if they could change their order to udon noodles instead.... I really wished I got the noodles while I was eating my sushi.Luckily, however, dessert was a lot better. I got a mousse with chocolate and a yuzu sorbet. It would've been better if they gave a smaller scoop of the sorbet because it was much too sour. I picked off only the sides of it to enjoy the dessert. On the other hand, the bathroom is really nice! It has the typical high-tech toilet with warmed seats, and the stall looks amazing! The overall aestetics of the restaurant is well thought-out: the art wall made of filled-water bottles, the multicolored bar, the transparent bar stools, and the japanese-themed table setting (including the chairs). In addition, the music was well-selected, and everything together created a rather pleasant ambience.

During my fourth coming back here, I realized it was probably my last.  Don't get me wrong, the food was amazing, but for it's price point, it is just too expensive for my blood.  The chopped up toro eaten with the six side condiments were amazing.  Who else would have thought to eat raw tuna toro with nori paste, wasabi, sour cream, chives, guacomole, and rice crispies.  The caviar that tops the toro tartare, is amazing as well.  The sushi and uni pasta salad that we got, was also very delicious.  Our bill came out to be about $200 and we were still hungry.  I'm glad I got to experience what it was like but I don't think I'll be coming back.  On a brighter note, the service was impeccable, my water level never reached the bottom of the glass.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Service was amazing and the respect they give to their patron are as close as eating in Japan.My problem lies with the Resturant week menu only. If you are reading this, no need to skip to the end- just avoid this selection of the menu. Choose from their wonderful regular menu and prevent disappointment.Perhaps it was my fault for booking lunch here for the Winter Restaurant Week in hopes for a great tasting menu, and was shocked there was none for the lunch menu. Just a lunch entree, that included a dessert, and some Resturant week inspired cocktails that anyone dining could order.Each lunch entree came with the following:Miso soup- which is same original taste as Japan. Good, but quite standard with a fresh, soft piece of decadent tofu at the bottom. Salad- which was wilted perfect for a soft bite dresses with very good, refreshing ponzu sauce that was sweet to the taste. Simplicity at its best.Raw Green beans- served cold bursting of earthy and fresh flavors. It was a very strong and unadulterated Uncooked flavor that I really loved!Gomaae Pickled Cucumber- very nice sesame and spice with a crisp slice of pickled cucumber Entree- Sushi Combo:Standard proper sushi. Rich was proper, flavorful, and spot on with the texture and hardness. Hamachi (yellowtail)- fresh. Sake (salmon)- fresh and melting in your mouth. Tai (red snapper)- fresh. Seared tuna- fresh and flavorful. Ebi (cooked shrimp)- fresh but very very boring. The Maki was a Tuna roll that was  absolutely amazing! It had a kick of spicy and a earthly blend of flavors that I could not identify. Gari (Ginger) was so nice and the tone of potency was leveled down perfect. Came with fresh wasabi root that was not overwhelming. Entree- 5 Spice Pork Belly:Pork belly taste was a bit different and unexpected. It was a bit too sweet with an extreme ""raw-pork"" flavor. The rice was cooked perfect, yet the tamago was too hard and overcooked. The whole dish felt just mass produced and left a greasy pork-flavored film in the mouth with each bite. It wasn't horrible, however, I guess my expectations were too high for the Iron Chef's Resturant. Verdict: ???Course Dessert: Chocolate Fondant vs Pot De CremeCake was horribly dry and service with a boring scoop of coffee ice cream. Pot de Creme was quite generic, however with a rather nice apricot-Carmel sauce and sesame flake.Verdict: pot de creme On the other hand, the Cocktail was a huge hit! Tokorozawa was a beautiful blend of chamomile infused applejack, pineau de charentes, Fuji apple pervaded honey and demonstrated the epitome of a tasting of the the Chefs skill. The real question iss, who really got this on the menu? There was only a hint of honey with a citrus burst of strong alcohol in each sip. That with the garnish of a charred lemon peal made it easy to drink and wanting more. I only wish it was actually served hot, instead of lukewarm. All in all, everything was fresh with quality ingredient, however, nothing about the food really blew me away.

But the food - oh, goodness, I'm not happy with the food.The oysters were mostly good - a touch of soy & spice, or a zest with ginger, very interesting toppings on the raw bar. Liked it. One oyster was bad, so left it. Mountain plum in the center - don't forget it, it's tasty.The Rock Shrimp Tempura was two styles - the fresh ranch on the side was mostly ignored, but was a simple taste. The spicier version was almost buffalo. The other version was a creamy wasabi aioli. Good, but hard to eat more than a few pieces (too oily). One table downed 2 orders between 3 people!The uni + ikura they were out of. We tried the udon instead, which was ok - a tiny bit of uni, and the noodles were too soft for soba. The ramen soup was a disappointment - the chicken tasted it like it'd been in the soup for far too many hours, and the soup itself was so salty that I could compare it to the chicken noodle from Campbell's. The manager apologized for it and removed it from the bill.Tamago - excellent.The Morimoto chirashi - great fish on top, and a good healthy portion, but the rice underneath was salty. Someone left too much liquid on the fish when preparing and let it drain into the rice? The rice did not taste good.Lastly, a dessert - the chilled cheesecake soufflé was one of the better parts of the meal. Fresh fruit, orange cream cheesecake (light and fluffy), and a drop of blood orange meringue.Overall - service from Matt R and Joel (the manager) was top notch. too bad I couldn't say the same for the food! =( We'll have to give it a shot another time... though probably will skip much of the non-sushi/fish dishes.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Service was meh; it was packed inside and we were squeezed in between a couple of other parties, so it was a little awkward. Decor is modern and the restaurant is spacious for NYC. Definitely a dining experience worth having. After hearing much about the toro tartare, we decided to order it off the restaurant week menu. It's a small serving, so the four of us only had a few bites each. It was incredibly fresh, fun to eat, and the dipping sauces were delectable. I myself am not a huge fan of tuna, so it was fun to order, but I don't feel that I would need to get it again. I ordered the dry aged burger, which is probably the best burger I've ever had. The beef was tender; it almost seemed to melt (maybe that's a weird description but it was amazing). Only complaint is that they seemed to forget the shiitakes on my burger -- very disappointing. The sweet potato chips it came with were yummy, along with the miso soup. I especially loved the salad -- incredible dressing! I also tried the nigiri, which met expectations, fresh and beautiful.For dessert, I ordered the chocolate lava cake which was enjoyable but not memorable.

The sashimi itself was very good, though I may have gotten 9 pieces instead of 10. (2 ea. of four different fish, and 1 pc of shrimp - or does the shrimp count as 2 pcs??) The tuna and salmon were my favorite - very fresh and buttery. However I found a bone in one of the pieces of salmon, which was extremely disappointing for a restaurant with a reputation like Morimoto, even given the RW price reduction. I've gotten sushi and sashimi everywhere - cheap restaurants, expensive restaurants, buffets, in Japan and other countries - and I have never once encountered a bone.I enjoyed the pot de creme. It's essentially like a custard pudding, with a light, refreshing passion fruit flavor, and it's topped with green tea pound cake.Overall the food and service were good and I'm glad I was able to take advantage of RW at Morimoto but I'm not sure if I'd ever return, RW or not.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Don't get me wrong, this restaurant is good- but I just don't think it's enough for my taste buds for the price of the omakase tasting menu. There is 7 courses in total, two fish dishes, one salad, one sushi variety set, a main dish of surf and durf and dessert. My favorite is the first dish with the toro on a plate with caviar and different sauces on the bottom. I thought the other ones were just okay, including the sushi. It tasted just kind of bland to me, not sure why. We also ordered appetizers to share. I had rather high expectation for the ikura with uni, but it came in a jelly like kind of gluey, gooey mixture and I can't be sure it really bought out the extinct tastes of the two main ingredients. I usually love raw food but this mixture just tasted kind of yucky...The oysters with foie gras however was really good! Actually I think the it was the highlight of the meal. The oysters were baked just to the right amount and it was topped with a small piece of foie gras on side which added some depth to the sea, salty flavor of the oysters. The dessert was some kind of manga pudding with ice cream(?) shell outside. Didn't like it that much, was a really too heavy after the main dish of the surf and durf. Something I appreciated is that they brought out a small dish to cleanse the palettes after the heavy main course. It was like a small fruit stick. Oh, the bathroom is pretty. Automatic toilets with Sakura filled reflective glasses in each stall( gives the image of being in the infinity room). Overall, I think I am willing to give this restaurant a second chance. KEEP IN MIND ORDER THE SMALL DISHES, not SUSHI or MAIN. The oysters and the toro appetizers were actually really good, just not the sushi and main course.

I love how there's a tasteful bar downstairs you can grab a drink while waiting for your table (or party in my case hah). One problem I have with the restaurant is that tables are way too close together. Try sitting at the bar if you can. But even so not much privacy offered for parties.Food is pretty damn good though. Some specialties that really stood out and makes me want to go back are:1. Wagyu steak A5 appetizer - amazing melt in your mouth steak! It comes on a hot stone plate so you can cook the meat yourself and is accompanied with a variety of dips. So good.2. Toro tartare - you will appreciate it more if you are a fan of caviar. The first couple times I came here and tried this dish I thought it was mediocre but the last time I really really enjoyed the blend of flavors.3. Cheesecake soufflé - mmm this was delicious. I love Japanese dessert because it's light and not overly sweet. This one paired well with the sorbet and fruit!Other dishes we got:1. Uni foie gras scallop appetizer - very tasty but heavy and buttery. Could only eat one of them2. Wagyu quail egg steak tartare appetizer - my date enjoyed this a lot but I think it cannot compare to the wagyu A5 dish3. Black cod black bean main course - good but I've had better at other Japanese places in the city 4. Sukiyaki - Would get this if you're not trying to sample a lot of different foods because it doesn't stand out but is good on its own5.

I assume that the restaurant ran out of caviar because it did not come with our dish, and when it was brought to the server's attention and back to the kitchen, it returned still w/o caviar. Tasty dish but I wouldn't order again at this price, it's pounded thin and you aren't able to get the full taste from the fatty tuna.udon - three sets of chilled noodles. honestly not much flavor profile to any of the three.

I enjoyed three of the five, one of which was salmon, the other tuna, and the third a white first whose name confounds me at the moment. The fish was the perfect temperature, which brought out the fatty, delicious flavor of the fish. The sides were everything. Miso soup is miso soup, but the mini cucumber pickles, string beans encrusted with nuts, and salad with dark greens and some sort of yuzu, nut and sugar dressing were perfect, no small element fell by the wayside. I tried some of the sushi, which left me uninspired. I've had way better, at a better price point. Tried both desserts on offer, the shiro choko had potential, but the passion fruit yuzu sorbet was way to sour, even mixed with the creme it was unpalatable. The other dessert however, the Azuki Hana, with the sake fruit jelly and yogurt parfait was as tasty as it was pretty- that is to say very. I had two drinks - the sukotto, with its two blended whiskey's had an incredible smokiness, and the morimatcha, which paired everything one thinks of when one thinks Japanese, calpico, sake, and match with vodka and lemon, and was good.

The restaurant has a modern design and decor, with an open kitchen so you can watch chefs prepare cuts of sashimi and other dishes. They have a great selection of wines and sakes here, including a really nice slightly sweet sparkling sake that is excellent served chilled. My favorite dish here was the Spicy King Crab. The presentation  of this dish is great and the taste was amazing. It is well worth the price. I also had a Spicy Tuna maki (roll). This was a disappointment because it really wasn't any better than what you would get at any decent sushi place. For a main dish, I enjoyed the Ishi Yaki Buri Bop, which is a dish where they cook the yellowtail on a hot bowl/stone tableside and it is served over rice and some vegetables. It was very good. Overall, a great restaurant that is worth eating at when you're in New York City, though give yourself a few hours because the service can be a little on the slow side, especially if you have multiple courses which is the way to go here.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Server equally attentive, a bit anxious though to insure that we'd upgraded to appetizers, dissapointed that dessert wasn't wanted. You know the type, a good waiter who has been told to pad the ticket. The food was very good. About right price for premium sushi. Appetizer special of soft shell crab wasn't great.

I won't go into detail on each course suffice it to say, they were all wonderful. Our server Rebecca and wait staff were on top of their game adding to the great experience. The dishes were constructed with the finest ingredients and meticulous technique. I had the wine/sake paring with the meal and each drink nicely complimented the dish with which it was served. The price is not for the faint of heart but it is food art and imho worth the price for the unique visual, flavor and textural experience. The dishes included several types of raw seafood such as toro tartare, abalone, skip jack, shad, trout roe, fatty tuna, also Kobe beef, main lobster and several other delights.

The courses on the tasting menu is chosen by the chef, and the chef chooses what is the freshest available at the restaurant. The whole tasting menu took about 2 hours, make sure you remember that and schedule things accordingly. We also added a bottle of warm sake to go with the tasting. We started off with a cold appetizer, the toro tartare in an ice bath. This has to be my favorite thing from Morimoto! I love the concentrated soy sauce, and the fresh wasabi. You scoop the fresh toro with a tiny spoon they give you. Next was the salad, which was the summer vegetable with dashi-soy beurre cheese fondue. The vegetables are all different and unique, some I have never tasted before, like the little watermelon looking vegetable. Next came the oysters with uni on a bed of salt. Then, the 5 pieces of sushi which consisted of fatty tuna, medium fatty tuna and tuna. Each fresh fish melted in our mouth. Then we had one wagyu beef carpaccio and a spicy king crab plate.

The sushi we had was some of the best I have had in NYC, granted I haven't tried that many places yet. The three stars is for a combination of the food being overpriced for the quality and the poor table service. Our waiter sort of forgot about us at one point and try as I may, I couldn't get his attention. He also was not knowledgeable about the menu, which is something you should expect from a place this upscale. I will note that you should stay away from the house crafted Sake, as they were all off the mark. Their cocktails however were spot on!Another thing to note is that most of the food we got was good, but very salty. My wife even had to skip eating the kakuni because of that. The deserts too were overly sweet and although the fiery chocolate was entertaining, it was wayyy to sweet and didn't have much depth of flavor.I would probably come back during restaurant week's lunch menu as the price would be limited to $29, but the normal menu is just too pricey.

Why the 3 stars.  The drinks were really terrible and I wasn't particularly fond of the dishes.  However, I would come back with friends/bf to try the sushi and sashimi.  ---------------------------------------Coat check is next to the entrance (not mandatory). Be aware that the seats are very low at the bar, so it might be easier to check in your coat.  Seats are nice and wide at the dining area and will be able to support a large winter coat. Service was amazing. There were several waiters assigned to our group.  As soon as  someone left their chair, someone would come by to fold the napkin. Always made sure we had enough water and drinks.  They checked for food allergies before the meal.  They make sure to place the non seafood dishes near the people with seafood allergies and near those who do not eat seafood. Cocktails - I would skip them.  I've had better.White lily cocktail - It looked amazing, but was a disappointment. I love yuzu, but the amount of sugar in the drink overpowered all of the flavors.  I was expecting something light and refreshing.Hydrangea cocktail - same case as the white lily, way too sweet.Sesame blossom cocktail - my friend and I both did not like it.  At first it was good - raspberry flavored, but the aftertaste of the sesame was not good.  It lingered in my month and tasted like cooking oil.  Morimoto ice tea (non alcoholic)- This was very good.  The calpico and crushed blueberries really made this ice tea different then others.  And....it wasn't overloaded with sugar! Appetizers - ehhhCrispy rock shrimp - essentially pebble sized shrimp.  It was ok.  They were lightly seasoned. Wagyu beef tartare - the non seafood lovers really like this.  I personally prefer raw fish to (semi) raw beef.  I just really didn't like the texture of the beef.  The black rice crisp on the other hand was very good.  Appearance wise, it looked like seaweed.Calamari salad - essentially salad placed on top of fried calamari.  Exactly what you would expect it to taste like.  Some of the girls at my table really liked the salad and the light miso salad dressing. Entrée - all cooked entrées.Sea bass - very good and buttery.  A little too much salt for my taste, but everyone else enjoyed it.  Avocado tempura was good.Angry chicken - essentially tempura fried boneless chicken.  This was ok, the chicken wasn't dried out.  The crispy layer was light.  The yogurt sauce complimented the chicken very well. 12oz prime aged New York strip- Sorry I didn't get a better picture as it eaten up quickly.  Anyway this was the favorite of the group.  The steak was still sizzling when it was brought over to the table.  All six sides of the steak was charred to perfection.  It was medium rare, but not overly pink.  Bok Choy and pea shoots stir fried vegetables were okay - a little too much salt.Desserts - was okayCoconut mango blanc-mange (coconut matcha cream, lemon yogurt powder, mango soup - no one really liked this.  I didn't taste any coconut.  The matcha was bitter.  It was such a strange combo with the mango.  It came with a pound cake like bread stick.  There were bits of grapefruit in it, which was weird. Chilled cheesecake soufflé - everyone liked it.  The cheesecake was so light and airy.  It had a bit of lemon fragrant and wasn't overly sweet!  The wine sorbet complimented it very well.  I would totally come back and just order this.Soy latte - this was good.  The perfect bitter drink to cleanse my palette of all of the sugary drinks and salty food.

It is not an understatement when I say that I viewed your menu a month in advance and knew what I would be getting before even arriving to dinner. My party of three started with the toro tartare (but of course), the rock shrimp and a soft shell crab special. It's difficult to pick a favorite, everything was wonderful, but the toro was the first dish I tried and thus my first love. For entrees, the duck, duck, duck, sea bass and surf and turf were selected. I personally had the surf and turf, which consisted of a steak, a potato dish with tuna and yellowtail in an avocado mixture. If you need an example of what the pinnacle of culinary art is, look no further.  Yes, its expensive but it truly is well worth it.

We're huge fans of 15 East and BondSt for this kind of meal but we wanted to try something new. Upon arrival we waited quite a while before our waiter took our drink order. Overall the food was very good. The salad was fantastic. The sashimi appetizer was good but not great.  The Seabass tasted great and was big enough to share. The sushi was just average, good cuts of fish over tasteless rice. The price per piece is the same as Sushi Yasuda or 15 East so coming here for sushi is literally a waste of time. The ramen noodle soup was disappointing - it tasted fine but was very similar to Campbell's chicken noodle soup.   For dessert we had the fiery chocolate tart which was pretty good and was presented nicely. The atmosphere is very nice and overall the food is good, but at this price level there are restaurants that are just better in every way.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We booked the place through open table around 12pm and was seated by the sushi bar. We both tried the 10pc sashimi entree ($29 restaurant week price) -- which came with a chef's selection of fish, a miso soup, a bowl of rice, and a small salad. The salad was refreshing with a bit of citrus-y sauce. The miso soup was pretty good too, with nice chunks of tofu. I thought the sashimi was pretty decent but I was expecting something more fresh and delicious, especially for the infamous Morimoto restaurant. We also tried the Toro Tartare ($30) -- which came with 6 different condiments and soy sauce. This was the highlight of my meal. This was very tasty and is definitely worth trying outside of the restaurant week menu. As far as the dessert -- We tried both the Chocolate Fondant & Pot De Cream. Both delicious in different ways. The chocolate fondant was very moist on the inside, which was great. The Pot De Cream was great with an interesting passionfruit caramel syrup.  The service was pretty decent but what I found kind of odd was the fact that the person who brought out the sashimi didn't explain which fish was which. When I ask the person to find out for me -- the waiter promised to return but never did. PRETTY disappointing especially for a famous sushi bar like Morimoto. But overall, it's definitely worth a try especially during restaurant week lunch.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I have to.My coworkers brought me to lunch and the prices were pretty reasonable for a nice lunch, ranging from $15-$35 ish for a dish (appetizers are each at this price too). Their steaks are available too but much more expensive. It's a Monday so the restaurant was practically empty for lunch. The decor of the place is stunning. I have no words to describe it and the photos don't do it justice. It's worth it to just sit here omg. I was too shy to take photos while with my coworkers, but we ordered the scallop sashimi appetizer, the wagyu tartar, the spicy crab, and the pork gyoza to share. I'm pretty sure they made sure to serve just enough pieces for us. The scallop sashimi is served buried under an assortment of vegetables and roe. The wagyu tartar is served with crackers and a Japanese brioche that perfectly buttery. If I could just eat the brioche for the rest of my life, I would die of happiness. The spicy crab was nothing too special but it was yummy. And to my surprise, the gyoza was very good! It's served upside down with a thin circular layer of dough that connects all of the gyozas. The sauce the dumplings lay in is a mixture of flavors I don't quite know how to explain. So if you're thinking about getting the gyoza but not sure if it will be too plain, don't worry. It's definitely special :) For the main course, my party ordered the lunch set skirt steaks, katsu don, and I had the sushi lunch. My sushi came with 5 pieces of nigiri, one roll, green beans, pickled cucumbers, miso soup, and a small salad. I enjoyed it but it is definitely not the freshest fish I've ever had. And the roll was something quite plain. For the price and lunch experience, I think I would recommend ordering the cooked/hot lunch sets as my sushi lunch was a similar price to the steak or seared fish sets.Next time I want to come for dinner and get more appetizers or maybe I'll treat myself and come for the omakase :3",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We started with scallop carpaccio - really unique and great depth of flavors, toro tartar - toro was great quality but dish itself was plain similar to other restaurants, beef carpaccio - everyone said it was delicious but I don't eat and yu burrata which everyone loved too but I didn't have it was a tofu skin stuff with ricotta and cream in a truffle sauce with grilled sourdough. We got the sea bass as a main this was probably the most delicious fish dish I've ever had - get it!! The miso cod was good too. Others had the duck which was unique and prepared two ways with a variety of sauces and a fried egg. Then we had sushi the spicy yellowtail - favorite so good! Spicy tuna was good, salmon roll and soft shell crab tempura roll. For dessert I had coconut green tea sorbet which was delicious as a lactose free gluten free option! Service: 1 star! I am hoping this was a fluke because I wouldn't expect service like this at a McDonalds. I had to ask the waiter to explain the menu, we had to ask to order, he told us he would come back to follow up on sushi - never did had to ask him again for another menu. Our dishes weren't cleared. We waited 10 minutes before we had to ask a bus boy to clear the plates. It was honestly a joke. They replaced everyone's plates and didn't replace my boyfriends. Had to flag the hostess down to order dessert. Finally we had to say something. The service was horrendously appalling.

I had high expectations going in, and they weren't really met because I've had better quality fish at other Japanese restaurants. This felt more like one of those sushi restaurants to stuff your belly with cheap sushi rolls. Favorites:- Toro Tarare was a beautiful dish and the tuna tasted delicious.- Duck tasted so amazing and the croissant bread was very flakey and buttery. - Green Tea Crepe Cake was so beautiful, soft, and delicious. I'm a huge green tea lover, and this definitely still had the matcha taste to it. I think they could of added a bit more chocolate drizzle to sweeten it up a bit. Ambiance:- I thought morimoto would be a quiet sushi restaurant that was very upscale, however I was very surprised at how lively and loud it was inside. - The restaurant is definitely beautiful and spacious, and they have a cool light wall and automated Japanese toilets. I also liked how sections of the restaurant were separated with glass so that it still felt a bit intimate with your party.

The Morimoto Style Bagna Cauda took a while to get the hang of it (the roasted garlic-anchovy fondue is stronger, i.e., saltier than initially expected, so it's easy to overdo it), but once I did it was fun trying it with the different seafood and vegetables. The Sashimi Combo contained very fresh fish, and the standard variety of them, plus the unique addition of baby shrimp, which tasted light and a little sweet. I tried the baby shrimp for the first time, and I definitely don't want it to be the last - every restaurant should include them as a sashimi special staple.

BUT I have to say the two off menu items, the eel and avocado rolls were to die for - fresh and tender and delicious, and the toro tartare was unlike anything I had ever had - and so incredibly delicate and tasty that I might even consider going back and spending $30 on an appetizer. For entrees, my cousin got the burger (very good), the angry chicken (uninteresting to me), and the miso cod (tender and yummy). All 3 came with miso, salad, pickles, and string beans. My cod entree was a kind of miserly amount, but luckily we had ordered other things too. And it came with beans (3 of them, count 'em), and I thought it was hilarious that they even pointed that out, and mentioned the pickled bell peppers which I kid you not consisted of 3 sim-card sized squares of red, yellow, and orange bell peppers. If you had blinked you'd have missed them. I loved the seating - with these semi translucent panels between tables that made it feel private and loungey, and the service was very friendly.

The duck was SO tender. We both wished we had enough room to finish the dish! The non-alcoholic cocktails: morimoto iced tea and virgin white lily were delicious. The iced tea with the muddled blueberries was very refreshing (we ordered 1 more after finishing), and the white lily was a little too acidic for my dining partner (but I liked it much more than the iced tea).

Many restaurants have been fully booked for the week but I'm lucky enough to book the last table for Morimoto.My friend got the angry bird...i mean angry chicken. First impression, crispy with a little burnt smell. It is better when eaten with the sauce.I actually wanted to get the black cod, but I assumed I will be hungry cause I saw how small its portion was. So instead, I got the dry aged burger, cooked medium rare.  As you can see from the picture, the burger was cooked nicely. What surprised me was the fact that parts of it tasted like foie gras, which was not something you would expect here. Perhaps it's the cheese and the shiitakes combination (not your regular cheese and shiitakes preparation). Pity that it's not as juicy as what I expected. Nonetheless, still a good memorable dish. Burger comes with the chips though it's a little burnt for my liking. Each dishes comes with a set of miso soup, suribachi sesame mixed greens salad, and cucumber pickles. My friend commented one of the dishes tasted like the Indonesian 'gado gado'. For dessert, there's only 2 options. Panna cotta is nice and delicate. Tasted just nice and not too sour. I got the fondant which looked like an inverted cupcake. It's pretty dry so, the orange sherbet and cream was a nice touch.Overall, not too perfect, not too shabby. My friend prefers the angry chicken but I prefer my burger. My previous omakase experience here at Morimoto still prevails, but hey, can't complain for a $25 lunch.

It's a play on Peking duck, which is turned into a croissant duck sandwich. I couldn't taste much foie in the croissant, and the roast duck had none of that crispy yet succulent duck skin that you can only find in Beijing.

I had been to the Morimoto in Philadelphia a couple times and always left impressed with everything. I make sure not to order the same things when I visit, because the menu is so inventive and full of unique dishes. I've done the omakase tastings a couple times, and it never fails to wow me. There are a lot of different types of raw sushi out there, and I can't even begin to describe how well they slice and prepare the various fish and crustaceans here. I considered myself pretty knowledgeable about sushi and sashimi, but my visits to Morimoto proved me dead wrong.The most notable dishes in my mind are the toro tartare and the seafood tobanyaki. The toro tartare already has immense flavor by itself, but with all of the accompanying caviar, sauces and rice cracker crumbles, the flavor and texture profile is amped up even more. Not to mention, it's also a very good-looking dish. The seafood tobanyaki is basically like eating hot pot with all sorts of delicious seafood, in a miso broth. The green tea matcha mille crepe cake is also one of my favorite desserts, ever. I don't have much of a sweet tooth myself, but it's a great mix of rich, sweet but not too sweet, and moist all at the same time.I've yet to actually see Chef Morimoto during any of my visits, but hopefully I'll run into him one of these days.

Our request for extra lemons and extra ginger were handled promptly. We did not have a reservation but because we dined at 5:30 PM it was not a problem. The fish was fresh, flavorable and moistly delicate...just like you would expect it melted in your mouth.  I would definitely go back as they had a huge menu.  I believe we sampled the little neck clams and sushi and yellowtail.  All were perfect!

The dessert appears to be only for restaurant week. We also had a separate spicy salmon roll for an appetizer.Plenty of food. My favorite was the burger which was really tasty. It also came with sweet potato chips which I enjoyed. The sashimi was pretty good. Desserts really stood out which surprised me.

We ordered the rock shrimp which was crunchy and creamy, toro tartare which words don't do justice explaining, and the bagna cauda which was an anchovie fondue, not my favorite but everyone enjoyed it. For our main courses ranked in order of popularity, we had the surf and turf, beef sukiyaki,sea bass, king salmon, ishi yaki buri bop, and seafood 'toban yaki'. All of the dishes were delicious and each had its unique umami flavor. Although I wish the beef sukiyaki had slightly more noodles, those noodles with the soup was yummy. Also you can't go to Morimoto without trying the bathroom. Tried it and loved it. I didn't have to use the toilet but I walked in just to experience the endless mirrors and flush the toilet.

We arrived at 8:00 PM on Friday evening and left around 11:30 PM. During the entire time the restaurant was comfortably full and energetic and showed no signs of slowing down as we left. The energy was great, yet there was not an issue with noise or feeling crowded.The staff were great and extremely knowledgeable. The food came out at a nice pace, the presentation was terrific and the portions were generous. All this at a cost that I though was very reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber. So everything we ordered was terrific, but some of the standouts included: the uni and ikura, the udon trio, the ishi yaki buri bop (yellow tail tuna), brussel sprouts and of course the dessert. Ok so I think that that may be everything that we ordered. As I said it was all terrific!  So if I have to highlight a couple of things it would be: 1- the Uni, served with wonderfully plump caviar in a very tasty broth; 2- the Udon noodles. Definitely the simplest dish that we had, but so tasty. There different types of cold noodles served with a traditional dipping sauce. I know that this sounds a bit boring, but it was really terrific; and 3- the the milk chocolate key-lime pie.

Our waiter was nice. The food is pretty pricey with appetizers in the $20-$40s range. They also offer an omakase for $125/person for 8 courses. My husband and I were considering it but after hearing the options of the 8 courses, we decided to order off the menu. In the end our tab ended up more expensive than if we were both to order the omakase. My husband and I started with the tuna tartare.. I love the presentation! It's like a painting pallet! This cost close to $40...and it wasn't a lot of food. Miso soup was around $10 but it came in a big bowl. We also ordered the Morimoto sashimi which was decent. For main course, we ordered the seafood tobinyaki which was a lot of seafood (crab, lobster, scallop, squid, shrimp on top of a red broth), sashimi pieces (fatty tuna, uni, yellowtail), lobster roll, and grilled asparagus and kamp. They were all delicious. My husband really like the seafood tobinyaki..while I really enjoyed the sushi and asparagus, We ended the night with the seasonal trio sorbet and matcha tiramisu.

The crispy rock shrimp tempura was also very good. The Duck Duck Duck was decent. They gave us their Yosedofu complimentary which was my favorite dish of the evening. In terms of the drinks, the Morimotini was not as good as I had expected and switched to wine after the first glass. For a restaurant of its standing, the service could have been better.

I' m not a sushi connoisseur but I would say my friend and I have a fair amount of knowledge when it comes to raw fish. My friend and I ordered some sushi and sashimi, trying our very best not to go crazy over the menu. I enjoyed my selection of fish but I did not find it outstanding. Fish was fresh but not the finest. I had very high expectations because I was told Chef Morimoto serves some of the finest sushi in NYC. My friend did not enjoy or finish their selection of fish.

Second course:  kingfish sashimi with hot blended oil citrus soy scallion oil (myoga) and ginger paired with saichiken shochu.  Each bite melted in my mouth.Third course omakase with madai butterfish and and mortadella vinagrette oil.  It was served with Chablis which cut through the fish and oil really well.Fourth course, chawanmushi soy dashi custard with dried eel on top, pipette has eel sauce with Wente chardonnay (very rich and smooth).Accidental fifth course, tempura rock shrimp with wasabi aioli, gochujang aioli and house ranch with celery sticks.  It also had a pineapple ginger juice cleanse with a gold leaf for palate cleansing.  It had the right amount of crunch and flavor without being too spicy.Sixth course, big eye golden snapper, chutoro, saba, hamachi and mirugai (giant clam) nigiri with daijinjo sake.Seventh dish, serpentine dish with grilled wagyu beef, Japanese yams and lobster masala and lemon with creme fraiche matched with Etude white wine with violet notes.Eighth course, green tea tiramisu with sour cherry gelato with a sparkling cherry blossom nigori sake.Ninth course, white chocolate matcha green tea mochi.  It was so creamy and the mochi rice skin was tender and chewy.  Excellent!!I loved every bite!!  Definitely would visit here again on my next NYC visit.Even the ambience is very upscale with modern furniture and mood color lighting.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The waiters did not seem to be knowledgeable of their own menu and were not attentive at all to their customers, other than walking around and refilling water, there was no quality check in place to ensure customer satisfaction.Pricing and Quantity - 0/2 StarsPricing is awful. Other than the restaurant week menu, nothing else on the menu was remotely acceptable. The pricing wasn't acceptable due to the quantity of food received for such price. I paid 24$ for a single piece of Fatty Tuna sashimi and 12$ for a single piece of Yellow-Tail. That to me, especially when it's not established on the menu nor by the waiters/waitresses is unacceptable. Quality - 1/2 StarsThe food was overly salted. Their salad was unbearable, for someone such as I with a high tolerance to salt palate, I was literally choking. Their green beans were slightly better but not by much. The miso soup was so awful I had to pass it to my girlfriend to finish, and she had to force it down. We had the sashimi combo and the dry age burger. The burger was awful, it was pretty much a 2x2x2 slab of meat to mess with you, and the sashimi combo was a single roll (6piece) with 4 pieces of sashimi. the sushi rice was terribly undercooked and to counter act the failure to produce proper rice, they added a ton of rice vinegar and it completely downed the taste of the fish. The fish on the other hand wasn't even that great. Paying 24$ for a single piece of fatty tuna and that tuna was nothing special. It was just fresh, that was it. For such a high priced menu (everything was more than 25$ pretty much) you'd expect the quality to be better, NOPE! They spent all their hard earned cash to create a water bottle art wall and a RGB (red green blue) bar downstairs with transparent bar stools and sliding bathroom doors like we're in the future.Total Stars - 1/5Definitely would not recommend to ever visit.

The service was good. The waiter explained everything and obviously recommend the more popular and expensive dishes. I was in the mood for something hot and soupy.

Plain and the noodle was soaking up all the broth.  I guess I should have went to his new restaurant for ramen instead. The bone marrow was sour??? I'm not sure if they put too much favor in it or what it is.  The sushi was just regular,  I could have gotten it for a better price somewhere else. One girl ordered the morimoto style bagna cauda which was really good.  A hint of garlic but not overwhelming.  This was the best dish in my opinion (actually this is an app).

I asked for a private area and booth and I told them I will be celebrating my engagement that night at their restaurant. They placed me at a table that was crammed with other tables and people. It was very noisy (chatter and club music). I felt like I was yelling across the table to talk to my fiancee. We had a wonderful server. She let us move to a booth, which was what I originally requested. We were much more comfortable. I ordered the spicy salmon and shrimp tempura maki. The maki order was just a little better than any small sushi place that I order from Ohio. I also ordered the rock shrimp appetizer and the seafood toban yaki entree, which was pretty good. The lobster in the toban yaki was phenomenal. The worst part is that although the restaurant called me to confirm the seating for my reservation and my idea of having a small surprise desert to celebrate my engagement. They completely forgot both of those! I was very disappointed. We will not be returning.

However, because it was my boyfriend's birthday and we were in the mood for Japanese, I decided to try this place out. It definitely helped seeing how it has such great reviews on Yelp.And, the chef is the Iron Chef guy. Cool!!!!!As soon as I walk in the restaurant, I was instantly amazed by the decor. Everything looks so FANCY AND NICE AND PRETTY!! The host offered me coat check and immediately sat me at my table. Definitely make a reservation for this place - it gets packed. First off, the waiter was extremely attentive. He also had a suprisingly soothing voice, one you would think would suit for narrating a children's book. After I let him know that it was my first time there, he made suggestions on how much food I should get and which sushi I should try.For appetizers, I got the toro tartare (I'd say this is the restaurant's most popular appetizer) and the roasted bone marrow. Both were AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! The toro tartare comes in a very unique ...way..to say it simply. It comes on an ipad looking clear dish (see my photo for reference) on top of a bowl of ice. It also comes with a couple of different ""sauces"" to dip the tartare in (in addition to soy sauce) - some guac thing, fresh wasabi, sour cream, and more (to be honest, I don't know what the other sauces were, but they were really good). The roasted bone marrow was also soooooo delicious. I'm a huge fan of bone marrow, and it comes with freshly toasted bread. The bone marrow is topped with some...circular jelly thing, which I still don't know what it is. Half the time I was eating in Morimoto, I was wondering what I was eating..but in a good way!And the sushi. WOW. I'm used to eating sushi at buffets, but this tops it all. It feels like it literally is melting in your mouth. Everything is so fresh. The restaurant also has exotic sushi - I got the cherry salmon and fire squid. Keep in mind- each PIECE is 7-11 bucks, but it's worth trying a few.My date each got 2 exotic pieces to try, and we shared the chef's selection on the typical sushi - salmon, tuna, eel, etc. This costs about $45-$50. You can either pick sushi or sashimi and can pay more for more sushi. To top it off, we each got a dessert. Each dessert costs about $12. My date got the banana cream puffs (with the waiter's recommendation). HOOOOOOOOOOLY MOLY! I'm usually whatever about cream puffs, but this is no ordinary dish. It comes with ice cream on the side and glazed nuts.....Omg. And plantains. Omg. Omg. My taste buds will never be the same. Also, because I noted to the restaurant that it was my date's birthday, they added a candle and a ""Happy Birthday"" chocolate to the dessert. What a pleasant suprise :)I got the matcha tiramisu. It comes with cherry pieces and ice cream. This was very good too - it was extremely fluffy with a strong, but fitting, cherry taste at random times. Although both desserts were good, if I had to choose one, I'd go with the banana cream puffs.Lastly, GO TO THE BATHROOM!!!!!!  (The downstairs one) It's a very bugging out experience. Each stall has a reflection on a reflection on a reflection..You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it yourself. DON""T FORGET TO CHECK OUT THE BATHROOM!The bill came out to a little over $200 (with tip) for the two of us. It was definitely more than what I'm used to paying for, but it was still an excellent experience.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

As she had already warned me to not have my hopes up too high about it, I wasn't too let down. It fared just to be alright and for the price...definitely a no-go for me again. Everything else that we had was tasteful, but once again nothing extremely out of the ordinary for me to want to say I'd go back to this place for other than the interior design and the presentation of the food.I would come here just to say that I have and try a few things; but I probably wouldn't come back considering the price range and that the food was average.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We opted to sit at the bar so we can maybe interact with the chefs - but I've never seen such emo sushi chefs in my life. I wasn't expecting loud and rambunctious Hibachi chefs throwing scraps for me to catch with my mouth or anything. But maybe a ""HI"" welcome to Morimoto would have suffice? No, they look stern, straight face, it was impossible to even nod at them. So, we ordered the White Lily, which was an amazing cocktail which consisted of yuzu citrus juice and shochu (Japanese beer??). It was damn good. Nice and light. The best experience was the toro tartare. It comes in this huge bowl filled with ice, a small tray of the toro, some spears, and about 6 variety of sauces and a side of sweet soy to dip in. The toro was also garnished with caviar. I was beside myself, it was absolutely delicious. I also ordered the Beef Sukiyaki. I hate to admit that it wasn't the best sukiyaki I've had. I love the par boiled egg to dipped in but the sukiyaki was too sweet and salty. They didn't have enough beef, noodles or vegetables for $38. I expected more with flavors and portions. The bathroom is so cool. I like that it's own individual stall, the wall looks like a never ending hallway... someone can seriously get trippy up in there. The high tech toilet was ridiculous. I know it's TMI, but seriously... when I pressed front, the water came out the back. I was not expecting that.

I added my own spicy sauce: which I would have preferred the chef to do. At any rate the fish was fresh and it really isn't any better than the local neighborhood sushi spot. I rate them 1 for stupidity and 3 for food quality. My first glass of water was warm- the refill was cold.  If I could have a do over I would probably rate it higher, if I could convince them to make the rolls my way without being told no.

I was sadly disappointed. The food was not worth the money. We ordered the shisito peppers (a seasonal special), wagyu beef skewers, and chicken ramen for appetizers. The shisito peppers were underwhelming and not seasoned well. The wagyu skewers were very good, with a nice char taste, and the beef as tender as ever. When a dish is described as ""iron chef chicken noodle soup"" I would expect something pretty spectacular - it was not. It was just super salty broth, noodles, and 3, yes 3, little pieces of chicken. I ordered a sushi roll for my entree and my fiancé ordered the chicken roulade dish. My sushi roll was just a sushi roll, nothing special. The chicken roulade was probably the best dish out of everything; presented nicely with large slices of black truffle scattered throughout the dish. The service overall was not that great. We waited a good 40 min for our main course to come out and our waitress would disappear for 15/20 min at a time throughout the night.

We chose to sit at the sushi bar. While watching the sushi chefs preparing some beautiful looking plates I ordered my usual sushi rolls, tuna and California, so I had something to compare them to. We also ordered goyza as an appetizer. I balked at the $16 price but it was worth every penny. Never had goyza served on a bed of tomato based sauce. It was also served covered by what looked like an edible paper membrane. Don't know what it was but it was the best goyza I have ever tasted.When my order arrived it consisted of a miso soup, a small dish of tuna with seaweed, a salad and pickled cucumbers along with my rolls.The miso soup was the best ever, it had giant pieces of tofu in a broth that is out of this world. I have had the tuna with seaweed and pickled cucumbers before at Micky's Place in Queens and Morimoto's are just as good.The tuna roll was made from giant slices of tuna, some places use chopped tuna but not here. The California roll was made with real crab meat not the artificial stuff that's used everywhere else. Yes, these rolls were also some of the best I ever had.My only disappointment was the $3.00 charge for green tea.

The interior of the restaurant was beautiful, and the service was one of a kind. We got a couple things from the normal lunch menu: wagyu beef tartare, mackerel sushi, and a piece of uni sushi. Our RW courses were: sushi set and angry chicken. The desserts were: mixed berry panna cotta and lava cake with sake sorbet. The tartare was so fresh and delicious. The black sesame crisps on the side was so good. I don't know what kinda magic they're cooking with, but I support it fully.The angry chicken was good, and the portion was HUUUUUUUUUGE. I actually struggled to finish my lunch. My boyfriend's sushi tasted really fresh. The single pieces of sushi were also incredibly fresh as well. A little expensive but worth it. The panna cotta tasted like a standard panna cotta, so you know that's awesome. The cake with the sake sorbet on the other hand.... OUT OF THIS WORLD. I want to constantly be eating that sorbet. I don't even like sake, but the sweet mellow rice flavor made frozen and so delicate is something I'll never stop craving.

I was fortunate to come here on two occasions, because the first time I came here, I got the grilled chicken as my entree. I was a newbie foodie at the time, so ordering poultry at a famous seafood restaurant was a rookie mistake on my end (I mean, it was yummy, but I hate myself for not getting a fish-based dish!).

Our waitress was nice, although we didn't see her as much after we placed our order. The food was surprisingly just A-OK. We got sushi, we didn't get the tasting menu, which I'm sure is amazing and most people will order that. Instead we ordered the spicy salmon, spicy tuna, cucumber roll, sweet gourd roll and a regular tuna maki. As an appetizer we got the edamame, which hands down, was the best I've ever had. They were warm and had flakes of salt on it. Even the soy sauce was amazing! We didn't even finish the edamame and the entrees came out. I got a different sushi roll than what I ordered so they gave it to me for for free and made me a new one. My friend was not a fan of the sweet gourd sushi. We all tried it and we had to agree, it wasn't sweet at all. It literally tasted like a rolled up piece of ginger. I think she was expecting something like a sweet potato?

As expected, the food was unique and interesting but also amazing. We got the omakase, which I believe was 8 courses (2 dessert). One complaint - it's a little annoying that the entire table has to get the omakase or no one can do it. When it's a group of 10 and it's a very expensive choice, that's a tough sell. I'd recommend making sure everyone is in for that before going.For the omakase, it was nice that they asked beforehand if anyone had food concerns. I asked for nothing to be spicy, and they did a good job delivering on that change for all of the meal aside from the sushi (they left the wasabi on it and my eyes were literally watering). Another friend couldn't have any raw fish, so they changed all of the portions to only have cooked food, which was very nice to see they'd edit the entire omakase menu for someone.Favorite dishes: oyster foie gras appetizer, lobster tail and wagyu beef dish, sashimi, salad with quail egg, and this molten chocolate-type cake that was unbelievable.

I think they knew I like it that way- Iron Chef Ramen Soup - This was for SJ who wanted this. We did try the soup base and it was good. The funny thing about this is that the noodles is not Ramen...it's more rice noodle for PHO but without the PHO broth. so it was an interesting mix. At least the broth was good and my husband enjoyed it. That's all that matters. He even said it taste better than my PHO! so good job CHEF- Lobster Katsu Roll - Cabbage, pickled red ginger, Tonkatsu Sauce. My husband loved this one the best and this is definitely out of his element. he usually doesn't eat this type of food. Another great job CHEF- Wagyu Beef Carpaccio - yuzu soy, ginger, sweet garlic AHHHHHHH this is AHHHHHmazing!. this was gone so quick we should have ordered another one of this.  For my sister in law who doesn't like to eat rare food, she even enjoyed it. And to my husband who doesn't eat beef also enjoyed it. The textured of this beef with the sauce turned out great. mouth watering.- Oyster Foie Gras - market oysters, foie gras, uni, teriyaki sauce this is my favorite dish of the night. This is cook so to anyone who doesn't eat raw you can eat this. This came in 3 pieces of oyster and I was only able to eat one...I need another dozen of this to be fulfilled. The uni went very well together. 2nds please- Sea Bass - this came with eggplant and it went well together. I enjoyed the fish but my sister didn't because she said it was sweet...but she also said most sea bass they always make it sweet. If you don't like sweet food, this is not for you. to me the fish was moist with great flavors.

The rice was undercooked and verging on crunchy. The fish was served way too warm. These are 2 very basic things for sushi!! Also, none of my fish was particularly tasty. The maki roll I had was good, but the nigiri was quite flavorless. My squid was very hard to chew and unpleasant.

However, the food is just not quite as high in quality as I suspected. I've dined at Morimoto twice with my bf and I think we've had most of the restaurant's best dishes and more. I'm sad I didn't review this the first time around but I know I've definitely tried the Duck Duck Duck (very yummy and crispy) and the Morimoto sashimi. This time we tried new things:Ramen Soup: Ironically my favorite part of the night. This bowl of soup noodles is big enough to share and we got this because my bf wanted something light. The broth is very good (lots of chicken flavor) and the noodles are cooked to perfection. More soup than noodles, hence Ramen Soup. Scallop Special: This was off-the-menu that night and it's scallops slightly seared with olive oil on the bottom and seasoning on top. Sounded great but I think it could've been better. I'd give this dish a 3.5Toro Tartare: Ahh the one everyone talks about. Don't get me wrong, it was very yummy but perhaps a bit overhyped. It's just tuna tartare (not that much) with a side of condiments you can eat with the tuna. I wouldn't suggest eating it without the condiments or else it'll taste like nothing. Tuna Maki (Sushi): Apparently a new addition to their menu that is a ""big hit"". Meh personally this wasn't impressive at all. Yes you have great fatty tuna on top but the rice wasn't complimentary at all. For the price tag, I assumed it to at least be closer to how other high class sushi restaurants have their rice (room temp and soft). The middle is also just an avocado sushi so I felt like I was eating a not-spicy-tuna roll. Mango (?) Soufflé: Forgot the dessert name but this was my FAVORITE!! It's huge. It comes with the soufflé with a side of wine ice cream and fruit. Ugh. Our meal was relatively light so this definitely filled us. I recommend Morimoto for those who want to impress someone with where they're eating (setting) but I personally recommend Soto (still dreaming about that uni cocktail).",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
312,wtLH3-fQfhIli8YVkHmRTA,Hang T.,4.0 star rating,"The trendiest restaurant I've ever been too. The decor is super nice! I would have my next birthday celebration here if I could. Service was excellent. Tip #1: Make sure you have reservations so you don't get stuck on the long table next to strangers. I could see some people asking to be moved from those seats from our table. Tip #2: Portion sizes are a lot bigger than you might think. Coming into this place, I thought it would probably have high prices for small amounts of food. Wrong! When the food came out, they engulfed our table. The miso soup was humongous and WAY too big for two people, but at least it was good. The shrimp tempura done two ways was also delicious and again too big for two people to finish. Tip #3: Order the Duck Duck Duck! I guess it's one of their most popular dishes. The duck was very tender and not greasy like those you would find at a typical Chinese restaurant. I loved that you had it done a few different ways with a selection of sauces provided. It is messy to eat though as the duck in the sandwich did fall to my plate a few times. Tip #4: Skip the ""A la carte"" sushi. I didn't try their sushi tasting menu. I'm sure it's amazing, but the rolls in the back of the menu were lackluster and boring. Not the best sushi I've had at all. Skip those plates and go with the sushi tasting menu instead if you're in the mood for something fishy.Prices are higher than other places ($20-$30), but you are paying for ambience and a good time, and it is Morimoto.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I am not a huge fan of tuna, but the way it was presented along with the sauces and caviar, complimented each other wonderfully. We then had the uni & ikura, oyster foie gras, miso glazed roasted bone marrow. The oyster foie gras and miso glazed roasted bone marrow were the highlight of our dinner. For our entree we got the duck, duck, duck, which was good overall but because I'm not particularly fond of the idea of croissant and duck paired together, it was my favorite.

Watching all the sushi chefs prepare the rolls/sushimi with such love makes you know that whatever you get is going to be amazing.For drink selection Mark chose an old fashioned and I had a Sesame Blossom - infused vodka, raspberry, ginger..To eat I first ordered a selection from the seasonal sushi bar men - Sweet Baby Shrimp which I had in sushimi form. Honestly at first it looked like I was about to eat baby termites or maggots not fully developed but as soon as I put it in my mouth I was blown away. Absolutely delicious!!! And actually it is sweet. Not in a sugary kind of way but just a sweet seafood selection. Mark opted for the barracuda which was torched.We also had shrimp tempura rolls which were phenomenal. The final order was the Oysters Foie Gras which I loved but, Mark was not a fan of the texture. Personally I love Foie Gras!!

Even baby eel which is something I haven't seen before. At $28 it's still too pricey for lunch though. They make it seem like a deal because of the sides but they aren't good. The salad is just plain leaves - barely even any dressing. Then you get some green beans with peanuts in them - did not like. I was excited for the side of pickles as I love Japanese pickles but these were not. This was more of a Korean side of spicy cucumber that reminded me of kimchee and I don't eat spicy food. The miso soup was blah. So anyway a bit of a rip off but I'd love to try their dinner sometime.

The atmosphere is fun and trendy as expected, and you will see quite a few teeny bopperish people (now I'm showing my age ha). Our waiter was friendly and knowledgable. We indicated we were open to eating everything, except that I do not really like eggplant. The tuna tartare is a standout dish both for taste and presentation. You can scrape down the amount of fish you want to have with several different accompaniments below. You have to see the picture to understand what I mean. There was an interesting dashi broth with seaweed. The play on textures in this particular dish was fun- you had the chewy seaweed and some crunch too. Sashimi dish was fresh, obviously. I liked the Yuzu accent. The entree was a fancy surf and turf with lobster tail and Wagyu Kobe beef. We were really surprised by this- we thought either we would get the lobster or a beef but not both!Dessert was two fold with a little house made Popsicle and then more traditional mochi ice cream.

And right after we got out drinks they told us our table was ready. I mean come on, a drink I get at the bar is just one less I get at the dinner table, they're not fooling anyone. We got the Tartare sampler, spicy crab leg, surf and turf, miso soup, spicy tuna and salmon sushi. The spicy crab leg was the best - it was served in side the crab leg and brought to the table.

We also had the Yosedofu ($18)  (which I didn't think I would like as I'm not a big fan of tofu but this changed my mind) It comes in a covered steaming hot plate which you are not allowed to touch for several minutes. After it settles they prepare the dish with these little mushrooms, fresh wasabi and dashi soy. Wow those flavors exploded in  my mouth.  Really silky and smooth. For dinner I ordered the Seafood toban yaki ($40) which had lobster, king crab, mussel, clam, diver scallops in a red miso sake broth and my date had the braised black cod ($34)  in a ginger soy reduction.

The interior was incredibly classy and huge. It's a very large restaurant too, so less of that cosy intimate feel of some places. I've been to Chelsea market pretty frequently but had no idea Morimoto was hidden so close by! Service was meticulous but not excessive. I ordered the sushi & sashimi set as shown, which comes with desert as well - my friend and I shared the chocolate fondant and the raspberry sorbet desert. My friend loved her black miso cod - it was incredibly flaky and fresh! The sashimi and sushi were great, nothing to complain about, and I loved the salads and the crunch too. But it wasn't that phenomenal that I would come again for it, especially when I can get sushi and sashimi at that quality for a much cheaper price (hello sushi yasaka!).

The oyster foie gras was also decadent - although a little heavy handed on the teriyaki sauce as to mask the full flavor of the oyster or nice chunk of foie gras ontop. The carpaccio was also quite good. We also shared the sushi sampler, which was also a delicious and had a wide variety of fresh fish. Ambiance: dark with modern decor.

We immediately asked to have our table moved.  This was not the type of table that screamed 'celebration'.  They moved us to the middle of the restaurant, with a full view of the sushi bar and beautiful décor.  There, that's better.Our server seemed to take little interest in our request for suggestions.  We ordered three starters to share (including the starter special), the large sushi-sashimi chef's choice selection, and two desserts.  Honestly, I struggle to remember what we ordered, just a couple of weeks ago. Nothing was particularly memorable.  The 'fusion' style dishes (rock shrimp, etc.) are things you could find at any mid-range sushi establishment in NYC (ie: Momoya).  The sushi and sashimi were not the freshest, most adventurous or intriguing selections I have encountered.  I enjoyed my meal at Bond Street about ten times more - the way the fish melted in your mouth - wowza.  I remember that meal, and it was over a year ago!   Our total bill (food, drinks, tax, tip) was a little over $600 for three people, and honestly, I feel robbed.  Happy to pay this much if the food is worth it, but it SOOO wasn't.And as for the bathrooms - yikes.  It looks like these were probably nice about five years ago, and that was probably the last time they were cleaned.  Two stalls were out of toilet paper completely (on a Friday night).  The reflective floral designs are pretty, but dingy and dirty with layers of dust and grime.  The seat does have all those whiz-bangy features, but I was afraid to use them, thinking if they haven't refilled the paper and cleaned the walls, I can't imagine the last time the toilet itself was cleaned.Overall, a big thumbs down.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Topped with a chimichurri and ikura, the bone marrow was tender with a bit of Spanish and Asian influences. It was deliciously savory without being too salty. The grilled sourdough went great with the bone marrow and was perfectly crunchy.+ BRAISED BLACK COD: The miso glaze on the fish was similar to the bone marrow, but the fish literally fell apart when we put our forks in it. I was so impressed by how well this fish was cooked!+ GREEN TEA TIRAMISU: I specifically asked for a special dessert for my boyfriend's birthday, and they added a classy touch to this dessert with a happy birthday chocolate rested on the plate. The tiramisu was unlike any green tea dessert I have ever had. It was topped with matcha powder and a whipped cream/mouse, but as you got further down to the bottom of the bowl, there was a green tea sponge cake with an ice-cream like center.

We started off with their sashimi Appetizer and 10 hours cooked pork belly with congee . Sashimi was visually very appetizing but the fishes were just average. My pork belly was very tender with little bit of fat but it's very sweet for my taste bud I normally finished my food but not that Pork belly .May be that's how it  suppose to be , I am not sure . My waitress recommended me the silver Cod for my main dish and it was sweet also. I just wished it wasn't so sweet. I asked for side of steamed rice to help the sweetness from the fish but it's didn't  help . My friend got Chirashi and it come with miso soup .

For appetizers, we got the Spicy King Crab and Toro Tartare. They were AMAZING. Highly, highly recommend getting either or both. To be honest, I actually didn't think I was going to like the Toro Tartare, but it really surprised me and we ended up practically inhaling it. One thing that I noticed and loved, though very small, was the wasabi. Unlike most Japanese restaurants, it was fresh and authentic. Appetizers get A+s.For entrees, I got the Ishi Yaki Buri Bop and my boyfriend got the Duck, Duck, Duck. We both felt that our dishes were good, but not amazing and rave-worthy. They brought the Ishi Yaki Buri Bop to the table and seared the Yellowtail pieces in front of us by using the heated stone bowl that it came in. The Yellowtail was incredibly soft and tender. The sauce in the buri bop was really good, but overall the dish didn't feel too special or worth $30. The Duck, Duck, Duck was good but would have been better without the croissant and served in the traditional way. The croissant got soggy and was sort of strange to begin with. We also got the Bahn Mi Maki Roll to share, which was the special of the day. It literally tasted like Bahn Mi. Definitely impressive and tasty. Probably my favorite of our entrees. Finally, dessert! We got the Tofu Cheesecake to share, which was really tasty. I'm not exactly sure why it's called Tofu Cheesecake (is it the presentation and texture? or is tofu actually an ingredient?), but it was really, really light and airy. It was good, but I would have liked a stronger cream cheese flavor to it. The sorbet that it came with was pretty good too considering I don't really like sorbets.Other things to note:+ There is coatcheck available+ The bathrooms have bidets with automatic toilet covers and heated toilet seats",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Hands down the worst restaurant experience I've ever had in my life. Came here last night 2/14 for Valentine's Day with my girlfriend. First off, the most important part, THE FOOD. The sushi is nothing special at all. I've been to a few high end sushi restaurants and this doesn't even come close to high end sushi. It was completely average and for the price you're paying, you don't deserve average here. If you want amazing sushi go to Sushi Yasuda. That is on a whole other level than this place. Not as nice of a place but food wise, it is the best sushi in New York.Second, the service. 9PM reservation which I booked 1 month ago. Had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. Sat down at 9:30PM in probably what was the worst table in the restaurant. We were put in a corner where the decor wasn't even close to being ok. It felt like a janitor's closet and mind you, me and my girlfriend are not ugly people. I'm 6'2 and she's 5'10 and models. I had to complain to the hostess to seat us someplace else and he finally obliged and sat us at a good table. Everything seemed good. The decor is beautiful, the table was great now. We ordered the food. Our waiter forgot to tell us that there is WASABI in every piece of sushi. My girlfriend hates Wasabi. This would have been great to know before we ordered and again I've been to high end sushi restaurants in New York before and not one place has done this. Again I had to fight the staff and talked to the manager who took back the sushi and took out the wasabi. They looked at us like we were dimwits who had no idea about good food or service but I take my girlfriend out to the best restaurants in the city and this was by far the worst one I've been too. I spent $200 for sushi that was just average, service that sucked, and an annoying, douchey, loud crowd filled with even more annoying loud music played on the speakers that were probably on the worst 100 list. 1 star is generous.

Comfortable seating if you'd like a table, and with the speciality being sushi, a full bar that you can sit at in order to eat and watch the chefs.Unfortunately, the one item I stopped there for was not available, being only on offer in the evening. Stained glass sushi, you may have seen it on Battle Asparagus on Iron Chef America... I will try it one day!That said, what we did order was amazing, we started with the Toro Tartar, which I had seen on The Best Thing I Ever Ate. Finely minced Toro Tuna, accompanied by several different garnishes to try it with. So good, definitely a must try.The starter was cleared away and our sushi selection was delivered.

We were welcomed by the friendly hostesses in the front where we were led to my requested sushi bar seats. This time though, I did notice a fishy odor as we sat by the bar whereas I did not noticed it the last time around. After a few minutes, it did not bother me anymore.The omakase cost $135 per person and it is really worth it in my opinion for just the experience alone. So much fun! Everything that came out were beautifully presented and our waiter would teach us how to eat each dish. I have never experienced so many different flavors and textures; I felt like a judge on Iron Chef! My favorite was the surf and turf course which consists of wagyu beef and lobster (whoa!) and the seared scallop (scrumptious!). The desserts were all amazing as well. Mm.. Yum. My least favorite were the raw sushis because they were a little boring, but nonetheless fresh and apparently flown in from Japan!About half way through our dinner, we were approached by one of the managers who asked us if we were able to slide a seat down since a couple requested to sit at the bar (we had an empty seat our right, and another to our left). I was ever so slightly turned off because I do not like being disturbed in the middle of my meal but it was really no biggie. We were later presented a complimentary dessert for moving which was very nice of them.We could not help but notice that all the hostesses, waiters, chefs, and managers were all very good looking.

We still enjoyed the entire meal (minus the dessert), but in hindsight, would've ordered a la carte and focus on sashimi and sushi dishes.  We did start off with a fresh and tasty tuna tartar variation that left a lasting impression on me, but besides that I felt the other selections for Omakase didn't wow me.  Back to the dessert - it was an extremely dense, caramel chocolate cake of some sort that couldn't be broken up by a stab of my fork.  I found it too sweet and am not a huge fan of caramel, so I was pretty disappointed.  They did leave us with some fresh mochi balls subsequently, which made up for it somehow, but I still would've liked my dessert to be satisfying.Besides the dessert, I thought our meal was great.  Moreover, all, and I mean ALL the staff were friendly and provided impeccable service.  I'd definitely return again just to try more sashimi.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I've had better.  It started off with the Tuna Tatare which was served in this little tray on an ice bowl.  Not bad, again just a tiny taste.  Then came some sushi salad, which was amazing actually, again, a tiny bit more of that would have been great.  The sea urchin was served in the shell but unfortunately, it was soooo little... like 3 spoons and it was gone..The entree was the wagyu beef and lobster, both amazing.  The beef was very tender.  Overall, the ambience and dining experience was good.  I wouldn't get the omakase next time though.To be honest, I was more impressed with their bathrooms than their food.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Overall, morimoto is for some reason overcompensating...for what, I don't know but it must be due to the pressure of winning a TV competition.Here is a summary: -Tuna tartare: overrated; as someone else reviewed without the condiments it would taste like nothing -Beef carpaccio: THE HIGHLIGHT of the meal. And the most simple. Very good.-Oysters: too rich, overdone. Oysters are great with a mignonette or just lemon juice. No need to add on with foie gras etc. it's really just best at its most simple.-Rock shrimp tempura: the second best dish we had. Crispy and flavorful.-Duck duck duck: overhyped and dry. Not the tender meat duck should be and the croissant was also overrated.-Lobster katsu roll: they were overcompensating with tons of katsu mayo. I couldn't even taste the lobster.

I wouldn't come here again since there are so many other great sushi restaurants in the city.Issues we had:- anything with sauce, was over-sauced and overpowered the actual food itemsFor example:1) Fried Oysters with Foie Gras and Uni - this could have been an amazing dish, but way too much sauce that made it way too sweet ... So much so we started scraping the sauce off... (you can see the extra sauce in my photos and while my single oyster shot looks great, I've had better in Los Angeles for less) 2) Australian Wagyu Beef - We loved the outside crust and the juicy tenderness of this meat, but as I mentioned Morimoto's chef over sauced this and made it WAY too salty! If I reordered this item I would request this medium rare (like we did) and have them hold the sauce... Other items we ordered and my quick thoughts:- Toro Tartare - great presentation and the accompanying flavors/toppings/sauces were unique and fun to eat (although would recommend just holding the tuna plate and scrapping it like that)... Also you must saveur the plum that comes on the side- Sushi - Fatty Tuna (good), Hamachi (good), Uni (decent), unagi (too dry which means over cooked) -- I was expecting ""fantastic"", but as much as I hate to say this given the Morimoto brand, I really think it could have been better!- banana cream puffs - delicious - sake - we ordered the second and third one from the bottom of the list and preferred the third from the bottom (it's also less expensive)Overall, for the price, we were expecting Morimoto's to be better than mediocre.

I went back last week for lunch during restaurant week, and it was great!  Our waitress was very friendly, offereing up recomondations, but wasn't too pushy or annoying at all.  Very nice, really liked her!  I started with the drink she had suggested, white lily.  It was like a martini, but not too strong with a citrus-y taste to it.  Even though the restaurant week menu looked like it would be plenty of food we decided to share a couple appetizers to start.  We got the rock shrimp tempura and it was amazing!  It came two ways, and one way was with a buffalo sauce and it was so good.  It might have given nobu a run for it's money!  We also got the tuna pizza.  It was interesting.  It was sort of like a wonton cracker crust with really fresh tuna on top with tomatos, lettuce, olives, onion, jalapeno and this white sauce that I don't know what it was, but it was good!  For my main I got the cold ramen.  The waitress told me I had made a good choice when I ordered it, and she was right.  It was really good.  The pork belly was good, and the flavor of everything all mixed together was perfect.  Each main dish also came with miso soup, salad, string beans in like a peanut sauce, and pickeled cucumbers, so there was no shortage of food.  Even though I probably didn't need it, I ate all of my dessert.  I got the black sesame profiteroles with strawberry sorbet.  So good!

The restaurant is beautiful! Trendy, modern, all white with a slight 80's feel (is that just me?) that was a nice change from all the modern + dark restaurants that are popular now a days. Music was loud but not obnoxious and there was a cool wall made of (drinking) glasses as a centerpiece.  To start, we had the famed toro tartare and the crispy rock shrimp tempura. The photos of the toro tartare are quite deceiving and it is much smaller in person. It was good but not great. Having been to Nakazawa, the fish just didn't taste as fresh. For $31, I expected better, what can I say. And it's not as fun to eat, kind of difficult actually. The rock shrimp was also good but not great. The portion was large and came with two different types of rock shrimp - one with a spicy kockujang sauce (not spicy) and a wasabi aioli sauce (hint of wasabi) and a ranch dipping sauce. Neither were must/need to order again appetizers in my opinion. For my main course I had the sea bass and it was DELICIOUS! It was everything a sea bass should be- BUTTERY, CREAMY, MELT IN YOUR MOUTH PERFECTION. It was so good my bf wished he ordered it too. I am salivating just thinking about it! The desserts photos on yelp seem to be old- they have changed most of them. We got the warm chocolate coulant, which was delicious! The gianduja (hazelut) ice cream was so good I wish they gave a larger scoop. The bathroom are great as another yelper (Peter D.) has mentioned. Loveee japanese toilets! The back drop was also so pretty I took a picture (lol).Oh and the service was great!! Perfect waiter- there when you need him and didn't linger or talk too much.

I never get sushi here since I don't really see this place as expert in that arena. The decor/ambience is always awesome but I really don't love the tightly spaced 2 seater tables. If you don't get an end seat, forget about having a ""private dinner."" People sitting next to us on both sides asked us questions and chatted for a bit- no complaints, but just saying- need a place to ""talk"" without anyone hearing what you have to say? Forget this place. Anyway, the bathroom is always a trip- love the endless window look. The toro tartare was perfect as it's always been- but go easy on the condiments box. I've seen people get sick after eating that on two different occasions. The scallop was great - sauce was very Asian-fusion. We were planning on going to a second dinner, so we got those two as apps and then had the seafood toban yaki. Comes out steamy on a nabe and it smells like seafood heaven- but eat it fast before it gets cold. Smells a bit fishy if you don't. They could also use a bit less salt- the extreme saltiness was a bit too much for me. I had three drinks by the time the night was over- starting out from the bar downstairs.

I went on a Monday night and had to push back the reservation 20 minutes, but they were super accommodating. When I got to the restaurant the staff was super friendly and also checked our coats. Our waitress was very attentive and I never felt rushed. We first ordered drinks (1 glass of wine + 1 lychee martini) and then checked out the appetizers.To start..Toro tartare (with caviar, sour cream, wasabi, dashi soy) - We ate this first. Not going to lie we were confused on how to eat this (lol) but the server was super friendly and explained the steps of spreading the caviar around the fish and then ""scooping"" the fish and dipping it. Fancy. This dish was so fresh you must order it. It's a little pricey because of the caviar but it's one of the staples at Morimoto.Kakuni (ten hour pork, congee, soy scallion jus) - This pork belly marinates for TEN hours and is so tender. It just pulls apart. I wasn't as big of a fan of the soy scallion but the meat itself was still so delicious. I would still recommend to order this because the taste and texture was just very unique.Crispy rock shrimp tempura (spicy gochujang sauce, wasabi aïoli) - This was the third dish brought out. Ahh rock shrimp is always a favorite dish of mine and this one comes with two dishes each with a different sauce! One was spicy (not that spicy at all though) and one was a wasabi. Both were dipped in a homemade Ranch type dressing. Uhh YUM. Yeah this was the fattening part of our meal but it's such a good dish to share - especially if there's a group of you. There were only 2 of us and we still had plenty of rock shrimp leftover.The meal.. We were pretty full from the apps + drinks that we stuck to ordering two rolls.Eel avocado roll  & Spicy tuna roll - Delicious sushi! These rolls didn't even taste like fish honestly. It was SO fresh. Tasted like a new level of sushi roll. I realize these are pretty basic sushi rolls but sometimes I would rather just eat a normal roll than anything that's fancy and huge.Dessert..Mochi balls - So these aren't actually on the menu, we had to ask for them because apparently they are only offered on one of the ""special"" menus (not sure how to get access to that???). So nice of the waitress though to go into the kitchen and find them for us. You can't eat sushi without mochi balls for dessert!The entire scene of Morimoto is really cool, too. It's very trendy. We made friends with the two girls having dinner next to us - even sang the one happy birthday! Haha! Yeah you sit close to your neighbor diners but it's fine.

399,Upi9IWb2BCYnHQZq2fvKSQ,Z Z.,4.0 star rating,"Came here for a group birthday party with the entire table doing omakase. I was late because the actual restaurant was a bit 'hidden' in that the sign was barely noticeable and the doors hid behind their thick red curtains that I couldn't even see what was behind it to know it was a restaurant.Overall, the ambiance was cozy and the atmosphere was a bit casual in terms of dress code. Service was a bit more hands off, with servers at the table pretty much only when they were bringing out the dishes. We ordered the oyster foie gras to start (separate of the omakase), and it was amazing. There are alot of uni lovers in the world, and I'm not one of them, but I have to say it tasted amazing here. This is a must try.Omakase: This review is a bit belated, so many details are already fading, but there are certain items, good and bad, that I remember very strongly, which I think can help shed some light on dishes worthwhile trying or skipping.- Toro Tartare: This was hands down my favorite dish of the night, followed by the oyster foie gras starter we had. This is another must try at Morimoto. Both presentation and composition was outstanding - the fish was very fresh, but it was definitely the accompanying 6 dipping sauces that made it so memorable and a differentiator from the other toro tartares I've had.- The next few courses were all fish centered, and I don't remember the type of fish that was served, only that they were very fresh and the flavor very simple, but complementary as to not overpower the original fish taste.- Surf & Turf: Lobster and wagyu beef - I was honestly not too impressed with this course mainly due to the wagyu beef. It was overcooked, making it a bit dry and very sinewy. The lobster was a bit too flavorful, which overpowered the 'fresh fish' taste - also felt like a lobster dish you can get at a chinese restaurant with the garlic/scallion sauce.- Chef's seasonal selection of sushi: The fish was fresh, but nothing very memorable. I did get a vegetable piece, which seemed like a bit of a waste. At a renowned japanese dining establishment, I would want to taste all the fish they had, not a piece of cucumber. One member of the table, who for health dietary concerns could not eat too much raw fish was essentially served a vegetable roll for this course. Seems like not much thought/flexibility was put into catering the omakase for occasions such as this. You don't serve someone whose paying $200+ a vegetable roll.- Dessert was okay, not great.Would revisit, but probably not do the omakase again if the quality of dishes we received is 'standard'. Instead, would order a la carte the dishes that we really enjoyed. For a place that's meant to be innovative and trendy in the way they approach japanese cuisine, think they need to work to integrate a bit more innovation into the omakase menu. 4 stars because the best dishes of the night were truly decadent even though the rest could use some work.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Sooo, I feel comfortable giving 4 stars even though I feel my experience was actually barely worth 3. The restaurant is breathtaking. One of the most beautiful places I have ever dined, without a doubt. Bravo to whoever drew that design up.I started my meal with a Sesame Blossom cocktail. It wasn't on the RW menu, but the others looked unappealing; one was a hot toddy and the other had elderflower. Neither are to my taste, so I opted to pay extra for something that appeared more fitting. Sesame infused Grey Goose just sounded too awesome to pass up, but the drink was disappointingly watered down and sour. Blah....Off the RW menu, I ordered the sashimi; chef's choice of 10 pieces with green salad, white rice, and pickled vegetables as the main, and green tea cream puffs to finish. The sashimi was of nice quality, but the pieces were very small, the rice was, well, rice, and the green salad and picked vegetables were nothing to write home about. Dessert was a little better. At least it looked like it was a product of one of the highest acclaimed Japanese chefs in America. This being said, had the the ""citrus salad"" not been included on the plate, the whole thing would have been a one note, matcha mess. :(It was probably a mistake visiting Morimoto for the first time during RW, but frankly, the place is just too darn pricey to go any other time.

Even if a restaurant, which was normally great had an off night, I always let it go. However, the experience I had at Morimoto last night was so terrible that here I am updating the review.I have been to Morimoto several times over the years and have always considered it be one of the best sushi restaurants in NY. That is why last night was so disappointing and frankly shocking.We came last night for Valentine's Day and ordered a bunch of items that we tried before. First, the Miso-glazed Marrow with Roe. The dish came with burnt bread that wasn't even warm. We told the waiter and he asked if they could make it again, but we politely asked that he not bring another order. Despite our request, the waiter came back ten minutes later with another order. His exact words were ""I practically made this order myself."" The bread was still burnt, but warm. The dish itself was poorly prepared. It comes with two bones and they did not even taste the same. The person who glazed it with miso forgot to glaze both. Also the roe they now use has a rigid skin and doesn't taste as good as the one they used previously.The next dish was Seared Scallops. For over $20, we received 2 small scallops that were cut in half. To top it off, they were over-cooked.The third dish was Oysters with Foie Gras. I've never seen less Foie added to a dish in my life. Even after eating it, I still wasn't even sure it was Foie in the first place. I've had this dish many times, and it was always perfect. Whoever was preparing the hot appetizers was clearly messing up every order.At this point, we considered leaving the restaurant and cancelling the rest of the food. But then we said to ourselves, well at least the fish is going to be great. We received the Chef's selection of seasonal sashimi. They were fresh but simply not good, sans one fish. Why the Chef would select this assortment is beyond me. The last dish that was brought were two pieces of salmon sashimi. Salmon is my favorite sashimi by far, and normally Morimoto's salmon is incredible. What arrived last night was beyond unacceptable. Bland and literally dry on the edges. You cannot serve this to customers if you run a sushi restaurant. That's probably why I've never in my life tasted a piece of sushi that was dry on the edges.Overall, I couldn't have been more disappointed. The food they brought out other than the Sashimi selection was shameful. A metric by which a great restaurant should be measured by is consistency and Morimoto came up a mile short.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

In fact, this was the ""go to"" for celebrating important events! ...Until I dined here on Valentine's Day. I hate to write this review but we had an absolutely terrible experience here.I couldn't believe how many things went wrong. It was almost comical... almost.The waiter kept insisting that I explain what is wrong with the food in detail! This makes me feel so awkward! Especially on Valentine's Day! Especially at a communal table!! Over and over he would ask and pry until I'd give in and tell him something.This was quite possibly the most uncomfortable dinner of my life.Here's a breakdown of our extremely uncomfortable and disappointingly unappetizing meal (From my former favorite restaurant):Scallops - OverdoneBone Marrow - Under salted and served with burnt bread (and I know the difference between charred and burnt)Oysters Foie Gras - Disappointing (minuscule piece of Foie and the Oyster tasted off, they also forgot the Uni)Drinks - meh (I ordered the same drink as always and it just wasn't good, also, the first one had something floating in it)We ordered the chef's sampler of special sashimi which had some interesting options we were excited for however only one piece was actually good (and it was indeed very good.We also ordered a couple pieces of Salmon Sashimi (our fav! especially here) unfortunately it was dry and clearly left out a while -- we took one bite and left it on the plate. The Unagi was cold The waiter insisted that we speak with a manager after making me feel as uncomfortable as possible with condescending questions and a plain rude demeanor.The manager apologized, mentioned that we were the only people at the restaurant with a problem (even though the people next to us returned an entree and didn't like the next one...) He offered to take the Sashimi off the bill so we took the offer. I feel like I've lost something tonight. I've come to expect a certain attention to detail, a respect for the ingredient, a pride for the plate that leaves the kitchen. This used to be an immaculate experience for me, one to be savored and remembered until the next celebration... But not anymore (I know, sooo dramatic!

Or go to Nobu instead.Over the past decade and a half we have had the privilege of eating at some of the best sushi restaurants around the world, and this establishment was a profound disappointment. Perhaps my expectations were too high based on my experiences at the other 3 locations of his we've visited, but some of the failings were unacceptable.We only ordered two rolls and they got both of them wrong, the menu is incredibly limited, the ""tofu made at the table"" was very bland and had a ""nasty"" texture, and from the limited tasting of their tuna sushi their rolls are of average quality for 3x the cost. It's worth noting: I didn't realize it at the time that they had broughty my VEGETARIAN wife a TUNA roll instead of the cucumber roll she ordered; I thought it was their attempt at some sort of consolation after I spoke to the manager. Looking back on it now makes me furious.They were also unwilling to discuss customization of the dishes we were interested (my wife has a few food alergies in addition to being vegetarian). The best thing I had was the fois grais, which isn't a good sign for a sushi place. Morimoto's house ginjo sake was also very tasty.The final thing that convinced me I should write a review, however is that my wife and I are quite sure they judged us by our clothing when we came in not wearing a suit jacket or a fancy dress (we were't dressed like schmucks though :P). We made our reservations a few days out and got seated with all the walk-ins, and up against a wall at that. The manager denied that they do such things, but a visual survey of the rest of the establishment shows tall, attractive, sport-coated people in the main areas and the rest of us shunted off into corners. Their loss, though; I was prepared to drop a very large sum of money for a memorable meal, but instead we left early so we could hit up Beyond Sushi before they closed so we could get some decent food.

So, I was excited to go back again after a couple of years, but it didn't quite reach the hype I had created in my memory. We started of our meal with the sushi and sashimi combos (the small size for both). The dishes come with various types of fish so you get to try things you normally wouldn't. Personally I usually only order salmon so it was great trying other types of fish. I LOVED the sashimi: could definitely taste how fresh it was. The sushi set was good as well, but I prefer sashimi over nigiri: it just depends on what you like better. We also got several hot entrees which we found to be a bit disappointing. The Seafood ""Toban Yaki"" was not good. The red miso-sake broth was salty and the lobster, crab, and mussels in the soup didn't taste fresh. We also got the Braised Black Cod which was good, but the portion was TINY. The Duck, Duck, Duck was probably my favorite of the three. The duck was flavorful and the croissant was soft and fluffy. It reminded me a bit of Peking Duck: it even came with the same sauce. It seems like the hot entrees are kind of a hit or miss so I would recommend checking out what others have said first. Dessert was decent. The apple bread pudding was okay: I would have preferred a crisp over pudding but the flavor was good. The mille-crêpe cake is spongier than the Lady M one. It was good, but the highlight of the plate was the hazelnut rocher gelato. I won't go much into the decor of the restaurant, but obviously it is beautiful and lovely.

You can taste the difference, the Japanese waygu beef was buttery and delcious!

It was during the holiday season, but we managed to make last minute reservations and was seated right away. the space is quite large, with multi floors and full bar area downstairs. They have lunch specials but portions are not very big, so we also ordered appetizers. If you come hungry, you may want to add a little something extra. Other than the portion size; you're in for a treat. EVERYTHING is made with delicate detail. We had the toro tartare to start. very unique presentation! unfortunately, it wasn't the tastiest thing I had there but most expensive.to drink, i ordered a cocktail, which was good but my aunt ordered sake and she had a very generous pour on hers. Sake for me next time! To eat, i had the morimoto chirashi, which came with pickles, miso soup with fresh tofu, and a salad with SOMETHING AMAZING INSIDE (no idea what it is, but its a little sweet and powdery). The chirashi is AWESOME enough for me to be super unlady-like and eat 5 orders. the sushi rice is so comforting in an odd way. My mom had the Black Cod and Aunt had the Sea bass. (she inhaled it) and wanted a taco after. (small portions..) Mom was raving about her fish. Definitely a great place for seafood and sake! Will be back! Maybe for dinner next time if someone foots the bill :)price for 3 was about $200. less than i was expecting! but definitely not a cheap lunch..",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

It was so bad I canceled the rest of my orders and asked for the check to minimize my loss. The toro tartare was awful. It tasted very fishy, showing its low quality, yet was $30 for maybe 12 square inches. Even if it tasted amazing it would have been a rip off since not even ichimura would charge that much. But it didn't taste amazing, it was horrifically bad. I didn't even finish it (and it was tiny!)Morimoto's attention to detail and desire to be good is non-existent. As an example, I went to the bathroom and the electronic aspect of the toilet didn't work. Upstairs you can see that they primed a wall but never painted it so its discolored. What does this have to do with anything? It shows that they are happy to charge rip-off prices but have no desire to provide the experience that goes with that. Just complete apathy and why not when they get away with ripping off customers who are unfortunate enough to go to a restaurant 5 years too late than when they should have. They are just running on their reputation trying to price gouge as many unsuspecting people as they can. Simply shameful. For those that care, service was good but when the food is awful and provides the worst value i have ever seen, who cares about the service? I'm going to contact my credit card company and see if I can get a chargeback on some of the money.

The part of the chicken chosen for the recipe was just not right in the first place - OK let's try it with the sauce - things just escalated - that was the end of the chicken. The sauce was all wrong for it, it should have been more delicate, taming maybe, instead it tasted like a fried salsa with a yogurt kick. It was abrasive, it was something not meant for this dish entirely. It felt like I stepped into one restaurant to have the chicken and into another to have the sauce, and both terrible. Miso soup was good, dessert was good (sesame pastry on top of creme) but perhaps in too large of a portion to savor it's delicacy, almost drowning by the time you are finished.

459,1HxkZjuH_mYolZNaagmAZQ,Erin D.,5.0 star rating,"Having just been here for my 4th time, I can honestly say I still can't wait to come back for mori of Morimoto. Whether my little kosher Polish Nana Roza wants to admit it or not, shellfish is my thang, and this Iron Chef has nailed the oyster. Never had better, nor more creative. These half-dozen babies are served three different ways, all equally amazing: soy/jalapeño, ginger citrus, and ceviche. Cocktail sauce and tabasco just seem silly to me now. (I await the day a chef inspires me to stop putting ketchup on my eggs, but I digress...)The sashimi sampler app has been incredibly different every time, and always uniquely, beautifully prepared. It's just as equally a spectacle to the eyes as it is to the taste buds, as are most dishes here. The live scallops are almost too beautiful - more of a display of foam on a massive mountain of ice than anything edible, so I would pass on this one and opt for the life-changing diver scallop dish at Momofuku. For entrees, go Surf n' Turf or Seafood Toban Yaki. The wagyu beef and hamachi of the Surf n' Turf will melt in your mouth, complementing each other perfectly. Not overly filling, but entirely satisfying. The piping hot toban yaki, a Japanese twist on bouillabaisse, is comforting on a cold night. I suggest removing some of the shellfish from the boiling broth so it doesn't overcook - my shrimpies on the bottom of the bowl got pretty tough by the time I got to 'em. (Nana Roza would say it serves me right for eating them, but hey - at least I'm sharing the dish with a nice Jewish boy, Nana!)Lastly, finish it off with the Matcha Tiramisu, and take that spoon straight to the bottom to get down to the green tea goodness that will leave you bowing to the chef. And don't forget to drink... A LOT.... so that you take multiple trips to the coolest restrooms of all time. No spoilers - just go. And don't be afraid to sit down, boys, though you may not be able to get up for awhile.In the words of the great Phil H., Morimoto's ambiance is ""chic Japan meets outer space"".

If you get the chance, I'd definitely choose to sit here over a regular table. Sure, looking at your dinner companion is ok, but watching the sushi chefs work is like a broadway performance!The menu style suited us perfectly, with many waves of small dishes being brought to us until we were stuffed, rather than a typical starter/main ordering.  They were more than happy to take our order in waves as well, meaning there was no risk of over-ordering or going home hungry. We started with a bowl of ramen soup and pork gyoza. The soup was an amazingly simple but delicious broth with perfectly cooked noodles and moist chicken.  It was served in a massive communal bowl, with more than enough for 2 people.  The gyoza are, without exaggerating, the best I've ever had.  I'm still not sure what the weird crispy pancake thing on top of them were, but I don't even care.  Other highlights were the wagyu beef carpaccio, unfathomably tender and draped delicately in a delightful soy and ginger sauce, and the sushi.  We opted for the $45 mixed plate which came with spicy tuna rolls and a selection of 9 pieces of sashimi - some expected (like the salmon and 2 types of tuna), others more interesting (sea eel and kohada(?!)), but all delicious.It wasn't a cheap meal, but equally not expensive and definitely good value.The only thing I dislike about this place is their website.  Check it out, you'll see what I mean.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The fish didn't melt in my mouth as I had experienced from other sushi restaurants I visited on the west coast or in Asia.

465,HEkcpuQNbwRrsiauKyj3zw,Carolina M.,5.0 star rating,"I've been a huge fan of Morimoto since the original Iron Chef. He's a man of few words, but his work is like edible art.My boyfriend made reservations for us here for my birthday and we were definitely impressed by the food and service. Before getting seated, we were given the choice of sitting at a table or at the sushi bar. Sushi bar was definitely the best choice as we got a chance to watch all the chefs work on food. We even had the chef in front of us serve us the sashimi course since we chose to do the tasting. I'm sure the tasting changes on a day-to-day basis, but from what I remember, what made our tasting different was asking for wagyu beef. I think this is an additional $30/person.The food can be playful which is probably a strange way of describing it. The salad course was a mini-fondue dish where you dip various vegetables: yellow carrot, radish, daikon, leaves, etc. There's also the ""famous"" tuna tartare appetizer where chopped up tuna is pressed into a shallow glass tile and you eat it with different condiments (wasabi, creme fraiche, avocado, etc) with a small spade. These were fun to eat.For the wagyu beef entree during our tasting, it was a surf and turf plate: lobster tail flavored with garam masala, and the wagyu beef was served with some kind of caramelized soy sauce. The flavor was definitely strong with the lobster, but I think enjoyed the steak more. I would've preferred a little less sauce to enjoy the beef, but you can still taste how fatty the beef is. While the marbling can't be seen, you could definitely taste it in each bite.My boyfriend and I were also impressed with dessert which came in 3 courses. Typically, I think dessert is 2 courses, but they did something special for me since it was my birthday. First dessert was a sour apple sorbet which tasted a bit like apple pie. Definitely cleansed my palate. The second dessert was like an ice cream bomb: sour cherry syrup, green tea ice cream enveloped in rich creamy ball topped with a sakura (cherry blossom) leaf which was lightly battered and fried. The sakura leaf tasted like one of those snowpea crisps and was a light, crunchy contrast to the ice cream. The last dessert was ""handmade"" mochi. I think it's funny they call it handmade because I thought most mochis were handmade and if it's in a nice restaurant like this, shouldn't it be handmade anyway? I dont think I was that impressed by the mochi since my mom can make it. Service was great. I think the only slight con was not being able to understand all the servers describing the dishes to us. Some servers had accents, but our waitress was super helpful and nice.Oh, and the bathrooms in the restaurant were kinda cool too. Located on the bottom floor, the stalls have remote-control with seat warmers and a bidet. I didn't use it since I still get squeamish at the thought it's a public restroom, but the 3-D walls behind the toilets were kinda trippy. Overall, dinner at Morimoto's was kind of the proverbial cherry on top of my NYC-trip of a sundae.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We were a bit early (before they opened), and they didn't let us in, but did offer to check in our stuff and came outside to get us when they did open. The server came in to check on us a few times during our meal - the perfect amount, and the service was pretty quick.In terms of food, we both got the sashimi lunch set and shared the tuna tartare. Apparently the tuna tartare is Morimoto's signature dish, and it definitely looked like it. I was actually thinking of trying the fatty tuna sashimi, but couldn't decide if I wanted that or not, so the server recommended the tartare. There were interesting toppings that came with the tartare for us to try and I really like the seaweed one, but next time I may just go with the sashimi. I don't think tartares are my thing. The lunch set was pretty good. It came with the amount of food you'd expect - although the green beans were a bit bland, and I wasn't a big fan of that.

Out of all the courses, what stood out most for me: Toro tartare: came on a board with 6 different types of toppings (wasabi, avocado cream, sour cream, seaweed paste, crisps, and chives). It was eaten with a little metal scraper and how it was presented was quite pleasing to the eyesBagna cauda: this was the salad course but served as a fondue of anchovies and soybeans, served along an assortment of vegetables and meats. The fondue was savory and decadent, quite different from the usual cheese fondue.Oyster with fois gras and uni: this was the perfect bite, got the savory of the food gras and sauce, the creaminess of the uni, and the taste of the sea from the oyster.

Of course, since she was 8 or 9 sushi has been her favorite food so of course I knew she would voice this so...Made reservations a week prior, no issues. Got an 1830 Tuesday night. Invited my sister Magdalen and the two kids Rachel and Loren. Place is business smart dress, which I absolutely have no idea what that is. Luckily, the Army dresses you so that morning I went to pay my respects at 9/11 Memorial Park in my uniform and just kept it on and showed up for dinner. Loren and I got there first and went downstairs to the bar and got a couple drinks. I ordered something that was basically a mojito. Was pretty good. the bartender asked me for my reservation name and told me that she'd charge the table for our drinks so that was cool. When Magdalen and Rachel showed up we went to our table. Magdalen immediately commented that she though she was in a restaurant from the movie Blade Runner. I questioned that, considering what the vision of Los Angeles looks like in the movie but she said the place would be found in the Tyrell building. I concurred. Place really does look very cyberpunk-ish and from the near future.When we sat down, Loren asked me about ordering at a sushi place. I told him the ideal is to go omikase and when I open up the menu, the first thing listed in it, is omikase. That is a 1st for me at a sushi restaurant. I'm seriously thinking that I'm actually dead somewhere and this is all a dream. So I tell them this is the way to do it and ask the waiter how many courses as it's a fixed price ($125/person). He tells me 7 courses but you can add the wagyu beef they have for an extra $30/person. I think it was an extra $30. Absolutely, I'm treating my niece so I tell him to throw it in. I'm not going to lie, it's hard to describe every course we had, better if you just look at the pics. We missed taking a pic on one of our courses but you can take a look. Suffice to say, it's all pretty outstanding. If I had a complaint is that 8 courses wasn't enough food so we ended up ordering 2 more plates of sushi. After the sushi, we were full.So what was so amazing that I absolutely have to discuss in detail? The yellowtail was quite possibly the best yellowtail I've ever had. Outstanding. Unlike any other type of yellowtail I've ever had. It almost tasted not from this world. So fresh and it melts in your mouth. What else? Morimoto's has incredibly fresh wasabi. It's really, really good. But even better than this? They have real wasabi. Oh, you didn't know that 98%+ of the wasabi you eat is actually from a horseradish base? Yep, it's ""fake"" wasabi. I have personally only ever found 2 companies that make real wasabi. Morimoto's has got the actual root! I asked and the waiter seemed impressed that I even knew enough to ask. It's an extra $8 for the real thing. You know what? So, completely, worth it. The real thing is so much better than any other wasabi I've ever had. It still has that sting that hits your nose if you eat too much but the taste isn't as sharp as other wasabi which I generally find to be too sharp. You could almost eat real wasabi by itself. I was just amazed. And of course because it was just grated mere moments prior, the freshness! Oh man, this is the way to go. So at the end of the night Morimoto's really doesn't disappoint. The sushi bar btw wasn't full at all. As far as I can tell, you can just roll up to the sushi bar without a reservation and just order food. I could be wrong though, check it. And of course the price is pretty astronomical. For the four of us my bill was a little over $1000 with tip.

However, the location (Meatpacking) definitely adds some hype to this place.The food is made out to be exotic, top of the line, and groundbreaking but the reality is that it is truly not. Does that take away from the fact that this place is great? No.However, the design and decor of the restaurant is phenomenal. Additionally, the bathroom will be a trip to the future.

However our server Todd didn't seem like he had any interest in our table. The restaurant was not busy since our party was seated at 545pm. He seemed bothered by our questions regarding the menu. We were a party of 8 adults (3kids) and our bill came to $650 (gratuity not included). We were planning to order more dushes but decided to finish up and head to Chelsea Market since we were not feeling the service. Food- The table enjoyed the soft shell crab, duck and sushi/sashimi. Kids loved the ramen, gyoza and even the crab. People choose this restaurant mainly for special occasions. When the service is lacking it kills the celebratory mood. The overall experience went from great to okay. We probably won't return since nyc is full of great restaraunts.

They brought the dishes one by one after we were done with the plate. By the end of the meal, 2 hours have passed and we already had begun feeling the fullness of the meal. The food was amazing, they had a multitude of flavors that either coated the palate or cleansed the palate.

I promise my opinion is not bias at all even though he is my favorite iron chef.I was a bit nervous eating here because usually I am not a fan of high end japanese restaurants. The portions are either really small or lacking flavor. Now thank goodness that wasn't the problem here, the problem I had was the service with my table reservations which is why I gave 1 star less.Came on a Thursday night with reservations at 9:15PM. I was a bit late because I took the wrong turn after getting off the subway. Called to let the host know I will be a bit late and due to my surprise she said they can only hold tables for 15 minutes after reservation time. After that they'll have to let my table go and whenever I do arrive, I can then decide if I want to wait or not. Honestly, whenever I know I'm going to be late I will call to let the restaurant know, and as long as I make that courtesy call, the restaurant would let me know that is fine the fact I called to check in. So to me, that was a bit rude they won't even hold my table for another extra 5 minutes. Anyways so we ended up getting there at 9:40PM and yes table is gone, but host said we can get seated at the sushi bar right away. Better than nothing right? I'm glad we got to sit at the sushi bar actually because you can see all the action in the kitchen and everyone was focused and detailed at preparing your food. Our waiter was excellent. I asked for a glass of ice because I like my water cold, and he always refilled it before my ice went out.Morimoto sashimi- I thought this was the layered sashimi that I was so excited for, but when it came out, it wasn't presented that way. Did they change it? Or did I order wrong? Nonetheless it was delicious and fresh! The plate was decorated so beautifully.Spicy salmon roll and yellowtail roll - just the right size rolls, not too big or small. The fishes were fresh and absolutely delicious.Chirashi bowl - now this is the best chirashi bowl I have ever eaten. Period. This bowl is HUGE with massive amounts of fish piled on top. If you are looking to get full off of one dish and want a lot of different kinds of sashimi, get this. You will not regret.Overall I'm so happy I got the chance to dine here. The restaurant is beautiful, hip and very trendy modern.

The dishes we ordered were Morimoto sashimi and zen sai as appetizers, duck and yellow tail rice in hot stone bowl as main courses. The sashimi has about 6 different kinds of fish and each has its own herb and sauce. It is unique yet a bit overwhelming visually as well as taste wise. As for the duck, it was nearly no taste but relied on sauces. The meat was soft enough, the skin appears to be crispy but actually not. The sauce reminds one of Peking Duck. The other entrée is very good but reminds one bibimbap. So they do not show enough creativity. In comparison to another ""En Japanese Brasserie"" that we are very familiar with, Morimoto enjoys higher reputation but to my view food and service is just not as creative, nor as good!To be fair, we probably should have tried their sushi, which is their brand.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

They don't eat as ritually as I do, and despite how much our bill was, we didn't care and left incredibly happy.Be prepared to be overwhelmed with how beautiful the interior and ambiance is. We walked in 20 minutes before our 8:45pm reservations, and was immediately served at coat check. We were directed to the downstairs bar which was absolutely stunning. (See my pictures!) We all had cocktails and watched the bartender make our drinks from fresh juices (not syrup!) and delicious Japanese liquor. He was so nice and informational.We were then seated by a friendly hostess that carried our drinks. My friends noticed that the many chefs are focused and quite when they make their dishes. Great observation. We all ordered the Omasaki; an 8 course meal. It covers everything. Everything. But to be specific, it covers the: 1) Toro tartare, 2) Seared yellowtail sashimi, 3) Bread, vegetables, and lobster with lobster bisque fondue (you originally get beef, but I specifically asked for a pescatarian friendly Omasake*), 4) Seared scallop (probably the biggest scallop you'll ever see), 5) 5 pieces of sushi (sashimi over rice), 6) 4 pieces of lobster (originally 2 pieces of lobster 2-3 pieces of wagu), 7) Green tea sorbet and whipped cream to clear palette, 8) A bed of green tea gelato under fresh whipped cream, raspberry sauce, sugar powdered tempura green tea leaf, and side of a mochi.I don't want to go further than this, because I want you all to just give this place a go.

491,sWetaBr4mYaBgKlMt9fg8g,Margaret F.,3.0 star rating,"I really wanted to give this place four stars to justify the fact that I spent $135 for omakase plus another $65 for a wine pairing, but...I really can't. I've had much better for less money.The first course was probably one of the best as it is their signature dish - the otoro and chuutoro paste with a variety of dips - wasabi, sour cream, nori, avocado purée, and rice crackers. The tuna was delicious and even better with nori.Then...it kinda goes downhill from there. The yellowtail carpaccio tasted like steamed fish, just with a different texture. I was hoping for something more unique for omakase. The anchovy fondue was only good depending on what you dip into it. Meaning anything bland would probably be okay. But otherwise it is way too salty; not sure why they even included ham into it.The scallops were buttery and had a strong smell of burning incense, like in a Buddhist temple. The smell threw me off and I really couldn't focus on the taste. The presentation was nice, though. The sashimi were very fresh, but they included a giant glob of wasabi in the clam that completely overpowered the taste. Disappointing.The Wagyu and grilled Cajun-like lobster saved the meal a little. Juicy and nicely cooked.But then the dessert ruined it. The tiramisu was hidden under a giant pile of whipped cream / marscarpone. The taste of cherry was too strong - I couldn't taste the green tea at all. And then the mochi was underwhelming. Easily forgettable.We also ordered the spicy king crab a la carte. Honestly that was better than most of the omakase menu. The wine pairing was mostly a bunch of Pinot noir and Chardonnay. One rose, a bunch of whites, and one red. Nothing special.Service was good, but I probably won't come back anytime soon. It's a swanky looking restaurant.

Would you like some diver scallop carpaccio with that foam? Lots of foam! But the scallop was tasty and nicely done. The Ishi Yaki (steak seared on Mt. Fuji Lava Stone) was awesome! I am such a sucker for cooking meat at the table on a hot stone. Plus it came with a bunch of sauces and seasonings. It was so fun and tasty! The Ramen soup, is NOT traditional Ramen. It's like a tasty, high end, Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup. Not too many chicken pieces, which was sad! We then got the spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls. They are good. Definitely can tell the fish quality is nice, but nothing too special beyond that. I prefer blue ribbon sushi to this, when comparing the basic tuna and salmon rolls. Of note, the bottom of my water glass completely fell out and water spilled all over me and the table. I have no idea how this happened. It just all of a sudden, the bottom fell off. Never seen anything like it. The server was prompt to clean up the mess, and luckily the damage wasn't too bad. I figured after an incident like this, at a place like this, they would comp a drink or two at the end, or maybe dessert. This never happened. That extra ""umph"" of service, they did not have.

The hostess did mention that Morimoto is at the restaurant frequently, to which where you can find him at the sushi bar concocting his latest creation. Unfortunately, no such siting of him that night.First of all, reservations are strongly suggested. Although we made reservations, we still had to wait a bit. Fortunately, they do have a bar/lounge downstairs so you can get good and liquored up while you wait to be seated. Zen sai -- It seems as though the items in this appetizer changes frequently. We were totally expecting something we were frequently seeing in the Yelp pictures but to our surprise, we got something totally different. I was a little miffed but I kept my mind open to the possibilities. We got 5 little dishes of different types of seafood but our favorite was the crab. The meat fell right off. When does that ever happen?!Spicy Tuna Roll -- We order this roll at every sushi restaurant we go to. The tuna was super dark and it wasn't mashed up with spicy mayo like it usually is. Not sure how he did it but he manged to add a little kick to it.Kanpachi -- My favorite sushi to order! The flesh looked almost fake, as if it were plastic. It was a very pale pink, almost transparent. The fish itself was very soft as if you were chewing on meat that was smoked for days.Sea bass -- Soft, buttery sea bass made with miso and sake kasu. So simple but so amazing. The sake kasu added some flavor to the sea bass, which gave it that sweet taste. Although the tables are rather close, the restaurant itself is so loud your neighbors won't be able to hear anything. The crowd is very lively and at times boisterous but it's all in good times. Our waiter was 110% professional and each time a new dish was brought out we were given a quick rundown on what the dish consisted of.

Were there people actually dipping those overly sauced popcorn shrimp in another coat of sauce? Another example, the side dishes came with the Seabass meal was Korean flavored pickled cucumber, I'd trade it for some authentic Japanese pickled cucumber instead. It's details such as those question the authenticity a little.

Here's what we started with:1. Toro Tartare - despite costing a hefty $31 for appetizer, I gave this a try anyway because it seemed like most Yelpers were raving about it. It was really all about the presentation, which came in a giant bowl of crushed ice, which held up the thin slice of tartare and a small plate of dippings which included wasabi, crème fraiche, avocado, chives, nori seaweed, and rice crisps.   It was delicious and definitely one of my favorites but still, not worth that price. I made sure I scraped every bits and pieces off from this dish. 2. Tuna Pizza - at first bite, I wasn't a fan. But as I ate more of it, it was actually quite tasty.  I think you just need to keep an open mind that this is not your typical Italian pizza. 3. Seared Scallops - three jumbo seared scallops topped with bok choy. I wish I hadn't ordered this because it wasn't like  an out-of-this-world experience. Yes, it was fresh but you can get this at any other seafood restaurant.The main entrée was a bit tricky for me to decide. I wish I had done more research on their entrees before coming here. But I ended up ordering the Crispy Kombu Brined Chicken, which turned out to be my least favorite dish of the night. The portion itself was surprisingly huge. I had to split the chicken with my fiance because it was absolutely a horrendous amount of meat for me (a plus for those meat lovers). But I didn't really enjoy the way they smoked the chicken. The sauce didn't flatter me and in the end, I wish I had ordered seafood instead because the sushi platter that my fiance ordered was super fresh and delicious.   Dessert was the highlight. The apple bread with green tea crumbles  and the tofu cheesecake were like nothing I ever had at any other place. Come here for the experience for the sake of  saying, 'Yes I've eaten at Morimoto' but for the true foodies out there, this place is not worth the money.

I can happily say that the place not only met my expectations but exceeded them. Dining at Morimoto was more than just an opportunity for you to enjoy some beautiful presented and executed foods, it was a total experience. As soon as you walk in you feel like you are under the ocean in a mystical cave. The decor and lighting calm you and set the tone for the food that is to come. While the ambiance was lovely, the star of the show was still the food. My friend and I ordered the Toro Tartare to start and devoured it in seconds. The dish was  so fresh and balanced in flavors that you had to remind yourself you are in public so as not to shove the whole thing in your mouth at one time. For our main entrees we had the Surf and Turf and the Seafood Tobanyaki. The Surf and Turf was executed so beautifully and presented like a piece of art. I've had steak and fish before but it was different at Morimoto because it was so perfectly done. As for the Seafood Tabonyaki, it perfumed our entire table with a lovely scent. It was also very delicious. I can say that Morimoto is really my first experience with fine dining and one I truly enjoyed.

If you're looking for ambience and decor, though, Morimoto is spectacular. The sushi is basically over priced and average. One trip to Sugarfish as comparison will prove that point. Yes, they got the warm rice, but it lacked vinegar and starch. Yes, they have the right fish, but the prep is nothing special. Probably ideal for a big business or birthday dinner, but if you're a foodie and know sushi, go elsewhere.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Never before have coffee beans, cream sauce, and cookie crumbs been married in such a beautiful union. This dessert made my taste buds blossom into dancing flowers, my brain explode with joy and my stomach fall down in gratitude. The rich coffee flavor combined with the creamy, well, cream, leading to the soft cookie crumble is heaven in a glass bowl.And although I usually don't recommend toilet stall photography, I implore you to bring the highest quality camera you have to the bathroom, as it's even more beautiful than the restaurant itself. First you'll stand outside a closed stall for about 10 minutes until you realize that it's been vacant the entire time. Then you'll step inside and be transported to a mystical fairy land with 3-D turquoise walls with pink flowers and a toilet that reclines and warms your butt at the same time. I stood there in awe for about five minutes and took the most artsy bathroom picture I've ever taken in my life.

We had been looking forward to coming here for a while, since we are not from the city.  We started off with a cocktail from the downstairs bar and had fantastic service.  But that all changed Once  we were sat at our table. We did not get greeted for over 20 minutes. Once we did the server walked up and asked us if we knew what we wanted. She didn't even ask for a drink order, nor did she tell specials. Not exactly what you expect for five-star dining. Trying to look past that, we asked a few questions about the menu which she answered in a short fashion and almost seemed like she was annoyed that we were asking questions at all. My husband ordered A tasting menu, and I ordered the vegetarian soba noodles, burrata, tofu and broccoli rabe.  Despite having to order all sides, as a vegetarian it was still a well-rounded meal. It's a good thing I ordered a lot of food though, because my husband portions came out bite-size and he did not have nearly enough to eat. The highlight of my meal was certainly the burrata, and the tofu prepared tableside, that was something I'd never seen before.Unfortunately, after spending over $400, the most memorable part of our meal was the terrible service, so while we enjoyed our food, we will never go back.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

My sister and I decided to come here to celebrate her milestone birthday and felt this would fit the occasion. It's located by the High line (popular and scenic walkway above ground) on the west side. Outside, there were drapes covering the main entrance. Please avoid looking like a fool and not stand around trying to find the entrance and door handle. They are automatic doors. The host and hostess were a bit pretentious and didn't give off that ""hi! Welcome"" feeling. Fake smiles, I saw right through them! Since I was the first to arrive, I asked to be seated first instead of waiting at the bar. Their policy required the complete party to be seated. I looked around the place and it's only a quarter full. Followed by a few ""are you serious"" silent seconds... the hostess said ""but I think we can accommodate you"" and led me to my table. Thankfully, our waitress was a complete sweetheart and super attentive. After taking our drink order, we decided on the omakase tasting menu for $135 pp. They offered an upgrade choice of $30 extra for Japanese wagu beef instead of the Australian wagu (waste of money, stick with the original). Our entrees came out pretty fast. I did wish our servers explain clearly what each of our meals were. They kinda just said it real fast and left. Umm... ok. Overall, the dishes were good, but not great. Some highly mentionables: Tuna tar tar - delicious with all the little spreadsScallop - presentation was so pleasant and the taste was devineFish carpaccio - one of my favorites, really felt like my dad had cooked it.

But i did not like it and thas odd becos i have a huge thing for bone marrows -- ever since i had it at Hunt & Fish.. Another great restaurant btw. But yeah this was too salty), sashimi combo (fresh, assorted sashimi cuts), then we had oh toro sushi pcs and uni pcs.. Uni def stood out for us.. It definitely melted in our mouth. We had the alaskan wagyu ribeye w brussel sprouts on the side. The wagyu ribeye is tender, tasty and comes w a nice sauce to go w it. Overall, everything tasted good--but not like ""OMG great.""

The service was supreme, the staff were polite, and the ambience was comprised of modern decor. Overall the food wasn't bad, but I feel like it was hyped up to be much more than it actually was. The toro tartare was sadly not nearly as exquisite as people had described. All the fish is frozen and then defrosted once it arrives, and it felt as if the quality of the sashimi/sushi was equivalent to that of the discount place I used to eat in college. Ok maybe I'm being a bit extreme with that last statement, but I just expected so much more. The cooked food was actually quite tasty. The wagyu steak was truly medium rare with a crisp outer layer. The last factor of my rating is the pricing. Now I'm generally much more of a hole in the wall type of restaurant eater, but don't mind cutting into my rent money if it's a meal thats worth the extra suffering later.

Well, it just wasn't in the cards: there was tons of available seating but they insisted on offeringus the same poor seating options I heard them offering to the tourist walk ins who came in at the same time as us. The place teams reeks of a past-it's-prime former hot spot and wife and I were clearly at least 5 years too late for a good dining experience. We left after a little back and fort with the management about the poor seats notwithstanding the many empty tables. If I have to work that hard just to negotiate a decent table, especially at Morimoto's price point, I quickly lose my interest so wife and I took our business elsewhere that had much better management, ambience and, I'm guessing here, cuisine as well.

I should have noticed the signs when we could get reservation the day of. So why I would rank it one star1) the menu is not vegetarian friendly 2) don't do the chef tasting not worth it (we are a party of 6 and everyone did it but one of the guest was excluded due to lack of products in their restaurant to accommodate)3) instead of addressing the issue of dietary restriction in a polite way- our guest was treated as if they were an annoyance- the person was spoken in a belittling manner- we were about to walk out due to the attitude but the guest insisted we stay because he felt bad to ruin our dinner experience 4)I was served gluten dessert after telling them I had an allergy to gluten - graham cracker is not gluten free5) this was the topper that made me never want to return- right when the restaurant opened I needed to use the restroom- walked in and a half naked little little girl was in there- I was shocked asked her where her mother was and she just shrugged and stood there terrified. I went to the restroom came out and the little girl was still there but now in a very mature dress and heels. I asked her again if she needed help to find her mom she shock her head was trying to rush to get her heels on. I went up to tell the front desk people because no one was downstairs besides two male bartenders- the lady thanked me but finished her conversation before checking it out. the lady went down and went up with no little girl with her. For the next 15 mins(my view from my seat was of the stairs up from the bathroom level to the restaurant level) i waited but the little girl never came up. So, I got concerned and I had to go down and make sure she was ok and if she was still there I was going to call the police. I went to the restroom again and no one was on the bottom level besides the bartenders and a few servers- the little girl was gone. It made me really uneasy of why was a little girl was getting dressed alone in the restroom and right before we left the bottom floor was closed off for a private party. It was way too strange for me to return. The rudeness of staff especially when the manager tried to fix our dining experience -he did not handle the situation well.

There's 5 bento boxes to choose from and they all come with miso soup, salad, tempura, 3 pieces of spicy tuna roll and 3 pieces of nigri and the ""entree"". It was a great bento box and left me satisfied. I go the waygu beef, I didn't really know how to pass it up. All in all it was good, except for it was room temp-cold-ish and it ran on the salty side with no rice to balance out the salt. The miso soup had fresh tofu, which was awesome.The salad had the best dressing every and wasn't heavily dressed.The vegetable tempura had 4 pieces of deliciousness with an awesome sauce at the bottom.The waygu beef I already mentioned.The spicy tuna was good, lots of tuna.The nigri was awesome.This all came with dessert, which was strawberry panna cotta (awesome!).I'd say for the experience I didn't mind the $25 price tag.

We went through every course, each one beautifully crafted and aesthetically pleasing. Out of the 8 dishes these were my favorite:1) The famous ""tuna tar tar"" - you have fresh tuna on the plate, with an array of 6 dipping sauces that perfectly compliment the tuna. ( I can eat this forever)2) The kobe beef pairing with the Lobster-  I don't think I need to specify how great this is.and the best part of the restaurant, as one yelper stated: is the bathroom!

547,aeJ4PypkvHO8HsuW0JAOjQ,Teresa L.,5.0 star rating,"Two reviews in one: Restaurant week and then the Omakase dining experience.1) RESTAURANT WEEK --- I had my first Morimoto experience when I came here for lunch with two friends. I knew that the food wouldn't be the BEST that Morimoto had to offer, but I was still interested to see what kind of fare we would get. Among the three of us, we got the braised black cod and the wagyu beef. The lunch was served bento box style. Each bento box came with the following: 1) miso soup, which had huge pieces of tofu in it. 2) Salad. 3) 3 pieces of sashimi, 3 pieces of sushi with white ginger. 4) Vegetable tempura (asparagus and scallion) with a cheese based dipping sauce. For $24-ish it was not a bad deal at all. The best part of the meal was the dessert! The Green Tea Panna Cotta was freaking delicious. I think the dessert is what cemented my decision to return for dinner.2) OMAKASE --- I came back a few weeks later for dinner. We decided to go with the Omakase menu, which is an extremely common practice in Japan. Basically in Japan, you pull up a seat and your entire menu is up to the chef. (but in Japan you can pay whatever you think your meal was worth... whereas you can't get away with that here!). The Omakase menu usually goes from lighter to heavier fare. For example, we started with some raw selections and worked our way up to the with surf and turf, finally ending with dessert.In my opinion, the Omakase is TOTALLY worth the price, and if you want the fullest dining experience at Morimoto's you need to get it. It's $125 per person. The chef included items that I would have never thought to order on my own, such as the oyster with foie gras. It was one of my favorite dishes that night. I saw some people ordering Omakase for the entire table... no no! That's just awkward. This is a 7-10 course menu, each plate is going to have small servings. Plus, it doesn't make sense to split a piece of sushi 3 ways!LASTLY, you need to use the bathroom there. Just GO even if you don't have to ""go."" The toilets are badays and are heated!

553,b0x4HrjoB6Mo47G5bJN0rw,Irina D.,5.0 star rating,"Was taken here on a belated birthday dinner by my dad and stepmom earlier tonight.I knew we were going to dinner but had no idea where to. When we arrived at the doors to this restaurants I was confused as I have heard of it before but never thought I would actually be coming here since it is not in my price range. Even the doors to the restaurant let you know you arrived somewhere unique. Once we walked in we were immediately greeted with a smile and asked whether we had a reservation. Once it was confirmed, we were asked whether there was something we wanted to check, since it was raining we checked our umbrellas. The restaurant is large, with a main floor and a smaller floor downstairs. The design is modern and slick yet it does not seem cold. The lights were deemed which gave it a more intimate feel. As some people have pointed out, the bathroom is not to be missed. Inside the stall is an art show on its own and includes a Japanese toilet. We started with the Morimoto Sashimi which is a platter with seared toro, salmon, tuna, hamachi and wild shrimp.I usually do not eat fish besides salmon but I decided that this was the time to make an exception. The pieces are quite small but each one tastes absolutely phenomenal. Two of the fish were covered with caviar: the salmon with red caviar, which was very good but not better than red caviar I previously had, and another covered with black caviar. I never had black caviar before and although it was tiny, it was absolutely delicious. The dressing that the sashimi was sitting on was also memorable, even though I had no idea what it was. Also, there was a piece of fruit on the platter which resembled a raspberry but was nothing like I tasted before. For a main course I had the crispy kombu brined chicken which comes with corn lemongrass puree, nori, cilantro and lemon peel. The corn puree was very very good but the chicken was to die for. I never tasted chicken so soft before, I was almost able to cut pieces of it with my chopsticks. The dressing was unbelievable, I tried to eat as slowly as possible in order to savor the taste of it for as long as I could. I had both my stepmom and dad try it and they both agreed it was excellent. Between the two of them they ordered the ishi yaki buri bop ( yellowtail on rice cooked at the table, really cool to watch) and surf & turf ( wagyu skirt steak & hamachi ribbons, herbed potatoes, crushed citrus & avocado) and they both loved their dishes. For dessert I got the ice cream trio which included chocolate, vanilla and a Japanese flavor whose name I didnt catch. Although vanilla and chocolate are common ice cream flavors, you could tell that the quality of the ice cream was different than in most other places and it was delicious.Our waiter was nice and quite formal, which I guess is expected at a place of this caliber. When he brought the dessert plate, it came with a small dark chocolate on which it said ""happy birthday"" and a candle and wished me a happy birthday. No singing or fake smiles, which is very different than what I am used to. Any time I walked by a staff member I was greeted and smiled at, it really made me feel appreciated.For an hour after the meal was over I felt a natural high so sweet that I was thinking to myself that if I were to die at that point, I would definitely die happy.I would have given this place six stars if I could because no place I have been to so far has impressed me as much.

It's been a while since I dined here and I started to miss the toro tartare. Service is always impeccable. I have always had customized Omakase based on what I had before and what my preference is.

565,vetX-6xh-eeSP8vTGYleNw,Julia H.,3.0 star rating,"Beautiful restaurant, but the food itself was pretty average. FOOD:Toro Tartare ($31)-This was the main reason why I wanted to try this place. I was searching on Yelp for Japanese restaurants in NYC and the presentation of this dish definitely caught my attention. The dish has a very unique presentation where you scrape off the toro tarare with a little shovel-like spoon and you can mix it with a variety of dipping items, which included wasabi, nori paste, rice crackers, chives, avocado puree, and sour crème. The fish was fresh, but overall I thought it was overhyped and overpriced.Grilled Wagyu Beef Skirt Steak ($26): This came with a sweet onion garlic jus, grilled maitake mushrooms, and shishito peppers. The sweet garlic sauce was very flavorful; however, the actual steak itself was average. It was cooked perfectly medium-rare, but there were definitely a few pieces that were too chewy and I had to spit out. The mushrooms and peppers were nothing special. I thought it was a good deal since the lunch set also came with rice, miso soup, side salad, and seasonal pickles, but I would definitely recommend getting a different main entrée if you are thinking of ordering this!Spicy Salmon Roll ($8.25): Chopped Salmon, scallion, & spicy sauce. The fish was very fresh and you definitely get a good amount of salmon in each bite, but it was nothing mind-blowing. Overpriced but I guess it's expected at such a fancy restaurant. AMBIANCE:Beautiful, modern, and sleek. I really liked the décor of the whole restaurant. The bathroom was also very cool. They have Japanese toilets that are heated! The back wall of each stall was pretty trippy as well. It looked like an infinity mirror that had cherry blossoms inside.

The acrylic chopsticks and ombre tables were a nice touch.Service- A definite low point for our group.  We came with a group of 6 and were ready to splurge on a fun dinner.  We asked the server for a suggestions in almost every category and he continued to suggest, in our opinion, very basic options.  Even after telling him we wanted to try something new and exciting he suggested the California roll.  Drinks came out incorrectly  on two different occasions and we had to request them to be fixed.  Throughout the meal we were asking what other tables had ordered because it looked more fun than our choices. Presentation- Highlight of the evening.  Table side pouring of the mushroom soup was nice and aromatic.  Our absolute favorite moment of the evening was the Fiery Chocolate Tart.  The ball of chocolate was engulfed in the flames, but the climax of the presentation was when the flame went out and the chocolate melted into a puddle.  Impactful and memorable food moment! Food- I was expecting a burst of flavor but it was lacking.  We started with the Spicy King Crab, it wasn't spicy at all and was very bland.  The crab was also a little tough and forgettable.  Next we had the Pork Gyoza, a little more flavor here and plating was nice.  The tomato jam and foam were a positive, definitely my favorite appetizer.  The rock shrimp was our next appetizer and it was the most disappointing, it came with a side of ranch dressing and was reminiscent of your local Applebee's.  Chicken Ramen was alright, but was expecting more flavor, was very bland and flat.  The Mushroom soup portion was very small and while beautiful, I personally didn't like the flavor.  The sushi we did order was very fresh and delicious.  The Tuna in the Spicy Tuna roll melted in my mouth.  The California roll was very basic and not a stand out (as we expected) but when there server suggested it we figure we should try it.  The special roll of the evening, topped with yellowtail was a highlight and our favorite roll.  I think it was so great because it was new and innovative.  Would suggest the Chinese broccoli, complex flavors and was an unexpected favorite . Entrees: Angry Chicken- good, nothing extraordinary.  Sea Bass- a definite highlight, cooked to perfection with layers of flavor.  Standout dish.   Dessert was our favorite part of the meal. The Milk Chocolate Key Lime pie was fantastic.  But the best was the Fiery Chocolate Tart- sometimes the table side flame desserts can be gimmicky but this one followed through.  Loved every aspect of this desert, the rich chocolate, the ice cream inside and the chocolate garnishes.  We wanted to lick this plate clean!Overall- Ambiance was a positive but dinner left us desiring more.  Would have left highly disappointed if it wasn't for the killer dessert.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Everything from the lighting to the modern-minimalist feel was great. It wasn't your standard Japanese setting either, very cool and chic.

I had been pretty adventurous all weekend, but decided to really go for it with the chef's tasting menu. I am so pleased we made this decision- as this was one of the better meals that I have had in along time. It was a 6 course tasting menu- and there was not a single bite left on one single course. It is a good amount of food too, it was just that good. I really enjoyed trying different dishes than I would normally order, and really enjoyed the chef sushi selections.

We have both been big fans of Iron Chef America for years, so I knew this place would be a special treat!While it certainly wasn't cheap, this was some of the best food I've ever eaten. Seriously. Our bill came out to be about $89 per person after tax and tip (2 drinks, 2 appetizers, and 2 entrees between us).Drinks: white lily cocktail and the sesame blossom. Delicious! Appetizer 1: wagyu beef tartare. It was heartily seasoned, which I found to be delicious, but my boyfriend found to be a tad but over-powering as he likes to really taste the beef. The quail egg yolk had a very creamy consistency and the chips were great.Appetizer 2: I can't find it on the menu, but it was a fancy fondue with truffle shavings. It came with various bits of seafood, meat, and veggies to dip. We both loved the fondue...it was salty and delicious with a strong truffle flavor.Entree 1: Sea bass with sweet sake kasu, Japanese eggplant, and miso. It actually tasted like lobster, which was insane. So good, rich, and buttery!Entree 2: Duck, duck, duck. This one really took the cake no I highly recommend it. It was a duck sandwich, roast duck, and a duck egg, served with foie gras butter and a red miso sauce. It was so juicy and delicious and crispy and I would eat it again and again and again!!While I can't afford to come here on a regular basis, I would come back for a special occasion. Yum.

I must say the rose wine was amazingly delicious and the sashimi was so worth it. It was fresh, unique way of eating raws. Then continued with the Gyzo which was made in a special way tasted sooo good and flavored. Layered the entrees of skirt steak and the duck duck duck arrived. Before having the entree, my stomach was only a quarter filled. I must say the duck duck duck isn't so much for Asian ppl to try because it's just like the ones you can buy in Chinatown for way less. But on the other hand, the skirt steak was marinated so well that the flavor was different and real good. Tho it's a small portion, but you savor every piece slowly!

We got the chirashi, crunchy yellow tail roll, edamame, and the sashimi appetizer. We also ordered this delicious, sweet sake.The sashimi appetizer is GORGEOUS. The presentation was beautiful and the flavors exquisite. The only downside is that it's not really to share - they only had one of each sashimi so my friend and I could only taste half of the pieces because it's pretty impossible to split the bite-sized portions. We did consider ordering two orders however, so we could both try everything but we ended up being so full that we decided not to.The chirashi bowl was great. I wish the waiter told us what was in it though... There were 10 different types of fish and vegetables in it and we had trouble discerning what was what!The yellow tail roll is to die for. So fresh and it literally melted in my mouth. I would go again just to try their rolls. The cold sake was yummy. The server was very knowledgeable about all the different types of sake and even brought two out so we could try two different ones before we ordered. If you don't know anything about sake, be sure to ask a lot of questions so you can find one that you like. They are very willing to help you figure out which one is the best for you.Overall, great place. Lovely ambiance and friendly service. I had a great time here.

Though I forgot to say no red meat and one of the 8 courses included a piece of wagyu steak which my husband had no problem unloading for me.

585,ma3wztgkpWYgbMYTyS1ecA,Jay G.,5.0 star rating,"Morimoto is one of the better japanese restaurants that I have eaten at in New York City, as well as the Philadelphia area.  First off, it is located in the meat district and stands out with its automatic glass door entrance and the modern interior design.  I have never been to a place like this and decided to take my girlfriend here for dinner on our last night in NYC.  We felt a bit under dressed as many people were dressed full out in what seemed to be their best outfit or one of their best outfits.  Regardless, we ignored this factor as we luckily saw some people who were less properly dressed for the restaurant than us so it wasn't as bad.  The only minor complaint is that we had a reservation but we still had to wait a bit for our table.  We were seated in the room to the right of the entrance at the window seat.The first items we ordered were our drinks in which I decided to try the Morimoto sake flight while my girlfriend had a specialty cocktail.  The sake flight provided three different sakes with different flavors ranging from pear to other fruits.  I enjoyed all three sakes and definitely recommend this to anyone who likes sake.  After this sake flight, I decided to just get a carafe of the best sake in the flight.  My girlfriend enjoyed her cocktail but it was too sweet for my taste.Now, on to the true review.  We decided to order the toro tartare and Morimoto sashimi cold dishes.  The toro tartare was delicious and provided a unique experience as the toro was placed on a sideways rectangular dish and scraped off with spoons.  The morimoto sashimi was good but was just like ordering normal sashimi with some extra toppings such as a jalapeno.For the hot dishes, we tried the rock shrimp tempura, sauteed foie gras and grilled eel, oyster foie gras, and japanese lobster fritters.  The rock shrimp tempura was really good and provided two different sauces which was different from other restaurants we have enjoyed this appetizer.  The two foie gras hot dishes were both very delicious.  My girlfriend even enjoyed both of these and she is not a fan of foie gras like me.  I fell in love with the foie gras and grilled eel as well as the oyster foie gras.  If you are a foie gras fan than you better get over here and try these two appetizers.  The Japanese lobster fritters were pretty good but nothing compared to the foie gras appetizers in my view.As for the sashimi, I went for the kinmedai (golden big eye snapper), aoyagi (orange clam), awabe (abalone), mizudako, and uni (sea urchin).  We also got the eel avocado roll.  All of the sashimi seemed fresh and were very good, some of the best sashimi I have had in a long time.  The uni was some of the freshest I have had in a while also.  The sushi roll was nothing special but was still decently good.  To finish off the meal, we split the tofu cheesecake which was pretty good.  In the end, this restaurant can break your wallet as it ended up costing me a handful.Overall, I definitely recommend Morimoto to anybody who loves foie gras and Japanese food.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Food was average at best, and application of seasonings / dressings seem heavy-handed. Service disappointing. Were seated at 7.45pm and went for the tasting menu. By 9pm, we were only just served our 2nd course (of 7). Toro tartar: Gimmicky, overrated and tasteless, as other reviews have mentioned. I'd prefer a nice slice of fish rather than all minced up and flattened. Sashimi salad: Average. Was swimming in a pool of sauceAmberjack carpaccio: As above. Chawanmushi: At the first bite, we got excited. Perhaps dinner was salvaged? Well, not really. Seems like the chef accidentally added too much salt. Oyster with foie gras and uni: Was drenched in too much teriyaki sauce. Unfortunate, as the dish sounded so promising. (Hence we added it as an order - wasn't part of the omakase) Sushi: Nothing to write home about, but probably the best ( / least disappointing) course we had. We were told it was a ""sushi and sashimi platter"". Well - it was 5 pieces of nigiri. So not sure where the sashimi went.... Surf and Turf: Wagyu was good. And small. And cold. Lobster tail looked impressive but once again heavy handed-ly seasoned. (I.e. intense sodium shock) Dessert: it was actually okay.

I definitely could have gone without anything else, but had to do something extra because hell, I don't go to fancy restaurants all that often.

I totally did not picture it coming out the way it did, but it was good and the various accompaniments and garnishes complemented the toro, plus it was fun mixing everything to make different flavors.Oyster foie gras - With uni on top. Good, but the teriyaki sauce was kind of overpowering so I wasn't able to taste as much as I wanted out of this dish.Rock shrimp - Came out in 2 heaping portions - one with wasabi aioli and the other with this spicy pepper sauce. Both were crispy for having been tossed in the sauces and had a subtle but flavorful taste to them.Surf &Turf - It came with Wagyu filet, bok choy (they had no problem subbing the herbed potatoes that usually come with this), and hamachi ""ribbons"" mixed with avocado and citrus, which they mix tableside. My bf and I both agreed that we loved the hamachi and bok choy but could do without the beef. Of course, if we wanted good meat, we would have gone to a steakhouse.Sea bass - With Japanese eggplant, avocado, miso with a sweet sake glaze. Sooo flaky and delicious! I absolutely loved this dish.

The most important thing to remember is to make sure you get a seat at the sushi bar! This is where all the action happens and the chefs will chat with you if you are friendly to them. To see them work up close is really cool. It's entertainment! Plus, on both occasions the Iron Chef Morimoto himself was holding court there and he came over to speak to us both times. Really nice and warm guy. Was very interested what we thouight of his food, which was terrific by the way.When you pull up to the place the outside is covered with a flowing red drapery across the front.  You can't miss it. Entering the place you are greeted by the front desk staff. Both times our seats were not ready and it would be about 15 minutes to wait, so we went to the downstairs bar/lounge area. Bar area is very clear white with glowing red walls! Futuristic cool. See through poly - plastic type stools, and funky spaceship type feel. Small lounge area to grab a seat and enjoy a cocktail while waiting for your sushi feast to begin.Going back upstairs to get our seats we were also greated by a giant bottle wall. The whole place has this very chic Japan meets outer space vibe to it, which compliments the experience here. It is kind of loud and bustling, probably because of the size and open layout. Personally, I prefer sitting up at the sushi bar area, as the setup of the tables on the floor did not vibe well with me. Dinner here is off the hook! Portions are not huge, but Japanese cuisine is not about huge plates. It's about presentation and fresh flavors so keep that in mind. Crispy rock shrimp tempura, Japanese lobster fritters, ishi yaki buri bop (which they cook in front of you in a hot stone bowl was delish - yellowfin tuna w/rice), fresh maki and sushi were all good. Many choices to choose from. Plus, Morimoto has his own line of sake in all styles and a pretty extensive wine list. Beer of course also. Great stuff to accompany your meal.Had some tasty desserts. Lusted over this chocolate cake with caramel popcorn and corn ice cream that was like a party in my mouth!Seriously, no meal at Morimoto is complete without a trip to the famous bathrooms. Life is not complete until walking into this serene environment, have the lid move up and down on its own, and feel the gratifying warmth of that toilet seat on your butt as you sit down on it. Ahhhhh. All types of controls to play with on this robotic throne.

The salad was  too salty, the pickled cucumbers were good but not great, and the green beans were pretty good but nothing to call home about.The entree I picked was the 5 piece Nigiri with a maki roll. The entrees were really good (thank god). The fish was extremely fresh and I was delighted because after all, good sashimi is what I really came for. The maki roll was a yummy tuna with a light spicy mayo sauce.The desserts were all in all way too sweet, to the point that I could not finish the dessert. The presentation was really beautiful but the sweetness was truly overwhelming and disappointing.Compared to other various restaurant week deals throughout the city, I believe Morimoto was a bit hyped up.

I had their 7-course omakase, which, at Morimoto's, is really more of a set dinner; it doesn't change from day to day, and I wouldn't say all the courses used their freshest ingredients (with true omakase, the courses differ from day to day depending on which ingredients are freshest that day).I enjoyed the food, but surprisingly, the nigiri sushi course was...just ok. Not as bad as supermarket sushi, but it was average sushi. The rice wasn't warm, and the fish was not bad, but not great. I also thought the soy sauce was a bit harsh. One of the courses had a lobster tail, which was nice, but I thought the lobster meat wasn't as juicy as it could have been. I liked the first course, with the tuna and condiments. Also one of the courses was a little non-alcoholic mixed shot -- very good, but a stretch to call it a course. All in all, I think the food was good, but I was disappointed in the sushi, which I would've expected to be excellent yet was just ok.

However, once you step foot into the lobby, you will be captivated by the intriguing decor of billowing ceiling curtains and plush leather seats. My friend and I came for RW lunch. I had the sashimi entree and coffee kuromitsu. The sashimi was very fresh, I would recommend it! The coffee kuromitsu had a very nice coffee flavor and had an interesting mix of textures - creamy and light from the foam, and crunchy and gritty from the coffee beans/crumble. My friend had the pork belly cold ramen, which she really enjoyed, and the black sesame profiteroles, which were very good as well. They were essentially cream puffs with a black sesame filling that was light and subdued - unlike other black sesame desserts where the sesame flavor completely overwhelms you. The one thing that we both agreed would make the dessert tastier is if the cream puffs were served colder (ours were slightly above room temperature).All in all, the food was fantastic, ambience was wonderful, and service was great - save for the minor incident where my friend got splashed in the arm when the waitstaff wiped down the adjacent table with an overly damp towel.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

(7 courses, actually. I don't consider you a course, palate-cleansing ginger drink.) I admit I did find myself wishing we had a greater variety of sushi, but I also understand that the tasting menu wouldn't want to rely too heavily on it. Kudos to our server, who was really helpful and attentive without being pushy or intrusive, AND at one point during the meal, she moved a fork that was placed on my right side to my left because she remembered I was a lefty.

After checking in, we were informed by the host that we had to wait a little because the table before us was lingering. Fine, NBD. Wouldn't be a Chelsea restaurant without a wait. ;-)During that wait time, we talked about the decor, looked over the Morimoto cookbook that was on display, took photos, until we realized that 45 minutes had passed. We were getting a little impatient and the host was kind enough to treat us for drinks for our wait. Could we really be bought by alcohol? The answer is ABSOLUTELY. The boys got beers, while a few of us got this delicious Bulleit Bourbon cherry drink that was sososososooso delicious. Bourbon's the best (next to scotch). Finally, an hour later, and after the host profusely apologized, we were sat. Was this wait ridiculous? Yes, but I noted to my friend that I could not fault the restaurant too much for it because they were so kind to us (even treated us to some appetizers that were brought nearly immediately after we sat because we loved since were absolutely starving) and thoughtful. The appetizer thing - I couldn't think of anything more comforting than being able to eat SOMETHING immediately after sitting down. We were gracious, because probably we would have been really upset had they not gone to all the trouble to make us feel better. As far as food goes, I ordered the surf and turf ($39) that composed of a wagyu skirt steak and hamachi ribbons, herbed potatoes (that were to die for - I couldn't believe potatoes could taste THIS good), crushed citrus & avocado. The hamachi ribbons were prepared tableside (which was cute and quick). I also split the veggie of the day (sunchoke with pesto for $8) with a friend, and it was the perfect combination. My friend Jodi ordered the Sushi plate (the $45 size) and was pleased by all the fresh sushi choices on her plate. Tran ordered the chirashi sushi, which was a HUGE portion of fresh fish. It was $33, probably the least expensive dish, yet came in a gigantic bowl and had about 10-12 things inside. She was absolutely stuffed. My pal Sandra ordered the Duck Duck Duck that contained a duck sandwich, duck egg, and I forget the third component.All in all, the wait sucked but the service was superb and the food mouthwatering.

The wait staff and hostesses were very friendly and we were seated immediately which I liked (I hate when restaurants make you go to the bar and then as soon as you order a drink, your table is magically ready) although they did try to seat us in the area when you first walk in to the left which is like COMPLETELY out of the main dining room and just a weird seating area in general. I felt like saying nuh uh! No one puts baby in the corner! All kidding aside, that is really how I felt.We ordered MANY dishes so I will break it down by what we ate:+ Spicy king crab - A must order. As in, you MUST order this. Did ya hear me?- Tuna pizza - Very bland. I have had this dish at many different restaurants and I can say this is something I would definitely not order again.- Seafood 'to ban yaki' with sweet prawns, scallops, king crab, bok choy,manila clams,oyster mushrooms,citrus butter - Sounds out of this world, right? No. This was also sooooo bland. We even had to tell the restaurant how bland it was. For $37, definitely not worth it. The waiter did take this off of our bill and the manager also stopped by to say she was sorry that we did not enjoy it. I really was surprised at that because usually at the trendy restaurants no one is ever aware there is even a manger working (they never personally stop by tables). Definitely a plus!+ Sushi - We ordered sushi by the piece and they had my favorite; kinmedai. Wooohoooo!+ Milk chocolate key lime pie with chocolate crunch, key lime mousse, frozen raspberry meringue - I actually usually HATE key lime pie. I just never really ever was a fan of this dessert in general. However, when you let your guest choose dessert, you cannot pick what they order. In this case, my friend picked the milk chocolate key lime pie. IT WAS PHENOMENAL. It was one of the best desserts I've ever had in my life. YOU MUST ORDER THIS. Again, did ya hear me? Must must must must!All & all, the food was really mixed. Some dishes I loved, some I really didn't enjoy. It is a nicer step up in terms of trendy restaurants and although I consider this a fusion restaurant, the sushi was pretty good.

617,jZbCRXYDyWtzM7PPiIAzYg,Daniel M.,1.0 star rating,"Sad to say, but this was among the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. Yes, I came in expecting a tourist trap, but this place failed to meet even those low expectations. As for the decor, this place must have looked nice at one time, but honestly it had a delapidated, dirty feel to it.I made my reservation through the NYC restaurant week webpage. I had to take a 5:30 Sunday reservation, but I figured no big deal, I'll get to try the place out for a reasonable cost.We were directed to the bar because our table wasn't ready. Obviously this was a way to troll for us to order drinks because the place was already open, but empty. How could a table not be ready? They sure looked ready. Anyway, I had a scotch and my wife had some kind of lemon coctail which was delicous if not overpriced ($33 for the 2 drinks). As soon as our drinks were served, literally before we even tasted them, we were told our table was ready and brought back upstairs.I asked the waitress about it and she said they did not offer the restaurant week menu for dinner and immediately called over someone who did not identify herself, but I presume was a manager.  Obviously I was not the first person to have experienced this bait and switch.  I did not complain or ask for a manager mind you. Anyway, this odd strident person came to my table and started telling me how the restaurant week menu was only for lunch and grilling me about how I made the reservation. Fine, I'm not happy about this, but it's my wife's birthday and I just want to enjoy my dinner, don't worry about it.Apparently, she was not satisfied, so she came back and started asking me specificially how I clicked through the website when I made the reservation. First, that was 2 weeks ago, do you really expect me to remember in detail? Second, I already told you I just want to have my dinner. I told her I had printed the webpage out and had it in my jacket. She actually took my coat check number and went into my jacket, on her own, and took out the printout.  She came back to the table and insultingly told me I can find ""cost effective"" menu options on their regular menu. No apology, no ""can I get you a drink"", just shut up and pay!Trying not to let this freak ruin my wife's birthday dinner, we order the bagna cauda appetizer.  This is basically some pieces of seafood and vegetable with a fondue style dipping sauce. Neither of us just enjoyed the sauce and we ended up eating the  seafood and vegetables on their own. There were fried shrimp which were very greasy, cold and soggy. Not appetizing at all. I ate a little cherry tomato and it tasted as if it had been cross-contaminated with raw fish. Just nasty.By now we were both skeptical, so instead of ordering entrees, we ordered some maki rolls to share.  My wife ordered fried soft shell crab maki and shrimp tempura maki.  Both were pretty bad primarily because this place apparently cannot fry things without leaving them greasy, cold and soggy.I orderd tuna maki and spicy yellowtail maki. These were basically standard, no complaints, though at twice the price of my local sushi joint (shout out to Sushiyama in Brooklyn).I got up to use the restrooms and another waiter was blocking the aisle. I stopped and waited for him to allow me to pass by, but he just looked at me and then ignored me, leaving me standing there, until I asked him if he could please move in a bit so I could pass by. Just rude. The restroom itself must have been georgous at one time, but is showing its age with a hole in the wall, things falling down and a generally dismal appearance. It had infinity mirrors in the stalls and a fancy toilet.My wife is a big dessert person, so we ordered the creampuffs and the bread pudding.  Of course, nothing was done for her birthday, not even a simple candle or a ""happy birthday"". I'm not expecting TGI Fridays, but it's not unusual to acknowledge a birthday in some way.  Anyway, the creampuffs were fried and, as this place apparently is incapable of frying anything, were nasty and greasy. We each tasted half of one and left the rest. It was just bad. The bread pudding was not terrible, just ok. We managed to get through almost half of it. Truthfully the fresh fruit garnish was the best part. Both desserts came with gelato which was awful. I don't know how you can mess up gelato, but I guess they are making it there and not good at it. Normally I finish off any form of ice cream, but these were also left behind.In the end, we spent $150 for a lousy experience and bad food. It's probably a good thing they didn't honor the restaurant week deal since I probably would have spent a lot more, as I typically do, ordering more drinks, extra appetizers and after dinner drinks. From time to time, we actually enjoy celebrity chef restaurants, knowing they are tourist traps, because they usually are a decent experience with good food, but this place, I'm sorry to say, was horrible.

We got the braised black cod and sushi combo which includes 5pcs of nigri and 1 maki roll. Each combo includes miso soup, salad and seasoned pickles. The miso soup was really strong, the salad was refreshing, I believe it had arugula. All of the sushi was really fresh. The maki roll was okay, I tried some of my friend's black cod, it was alright, I'm not a big fan of cooked fish. As for dessert we got coffee kuromitsu and strawberry shortcake. We both preferred the strawberry short cake. The strawberry short cake was served in a really cute bowl. It was topped with a scoop of sesame ice cream, they used a mix of freeze dry and fresh strawberries. It was really creamy and the crust at the bottom was a nice touch. Great blend of flavors. The coffee kuromitsu was okay, I'm not a big coffee person or a whipped cream person. I liked the texture of the kuromitsu though, it tasted like flan. The coffee bits was a nice touch to the flan. A note on the atmosphere and environment. The interior design here is A+ I love the lighting and the minimalism. The atmosphere is really cozy and refreshing. I recommend checking out the bathroom downstairs. They use japanese toilets but rest assured it's not the one that cleans your arse. Inside the stool is so cool.

There is a big red curtain with Japanese lettering on it with glass doors behind. Once you walk in, you notice the beautiful, clean décor with the white walls, ceiling drapes and glass partitions/walls throughout the dining room. The restaurant is modern looking and keeps the atmosphere classy-casual with its casual dress code. Jackets are not required for men, but keep it clean with a button-down shirt and dress shoes and you'll fit right in. The tables are made out of wood, but there is a glossy look to them to give off a clean, yet contemporary feel. The noise level was pretty average as it wasn't loud, but you could definitely hear people chatting on the low side.As for food, we had the Oyster Foie Gras for an appetizer and the Seafood 'Toban Yaki'  and the Duck, Duck, Duck for entrees. The oyster foie gras came with 3 pieces of raw oysters drowned in teriyaki sauce. The freshness of the oysters were undeniable and the teriyaki sauce added a nice salty kick to it. The Seafood ""Toban Yaki' came with a Half shell lobster, king crab, mussel, clam, diver scallop mixed in red miso-sake broth. Once again, the individual ingredients were so refreshing it was like they just grabbed it right out of the ocean! In addition, there was some greens mixed in for you vegetable lovers. The Duck, Duck, Duck consisted of 3 separate pieces on 1 plate. The 3 pieces were a Foie gras croissant, a roast duck and a soft duck egg with red miso sauce. The Foie gras croissant was very interesting as I'm not a huge fan of Foie gras, but it was so soft and the flavoring on it was excellent. It made me forget I was even eating Foie gras! The duck was very moist, but to be quite honest, I could probably get a duck like this in Chinatown. The soft duck egg was really an afterthought as I thought it just added a nice bright color to the plate, but nonetheless I still enjoyed it because it's food after all.Overall, it's a beautiful, modern, contemporary restaurant. The crowd is very trendy, but not overly conservative-looking. The food is really good, but hard to say if it will blow anyone away. I can see why it's a popular, successful restaurant, however considering who owns it, I came away expecting a bit more with the food.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

They apologized for the wait and started us off with a complimentary appetizer which was the Tuna Pizza (raw tuna, olives, anchovy aioli, jalapeños) and it was very good. We also ordered the Chef Selected Market Oysters (half dozen) which were prepared three ways: two with fish sauce, two with garlic and ginger and two with jalapeños, Toro Tartar (tuna, caviar, sour cream, guacamole, wasabi, dashi soy) and a California Roll all of wich was beautifully presented.

We were a party of 2 and had 3 apps, 1 entree, and 1 dessert all shared. We started with a morimoto sashimi (3.5/5) because pictures from the past made it look amazing (everything was stacked on each other and it seemed to be quite large in size), but the dish we got was separated but we were told beforehand they were redoing the plating. However it seemed like the portion size was drastically reduced as well (maybe the price decreased too from the original, i dunno) but anyway the sashimi itself was pretty good despite the potions being much smaller than I was expecting.Next we had the oyster foie gras (5/5) which was TO DIE FOR. It had uni and some hot sauce  on top and the dish was warm. I never realized how much I prefer warm raw oysters until I had this combo and burst of flavor in my mouth. Seriously the best take on oyster I have EVER had.We also had wagyu beef carpaccio (3.5/5) I thought i was ordering a wagyu beef crostini (stupid/embarrassing mistake) which is what I actually wanted but this was still a decent dish. I did not appreciate the amount of oil they used ( a combination of sesame, olive, and some other light oils) so I dabbed the beef on the side of the dish a few times before eating it. The  beef itself was very tender and strong in flavor. ]Then we got the entree duck duck duck (5/5) as you may have read from other reviews. This duck is amazing, one part is roasted, another looks to be lightly fried and put into a sandwich with really light airy bread, and there was a duck egg dip (along with pork miso dip and hoisin sauce dip). All 3 dips were amazing and I highly recommend you try this entree (shared or not). I know usually the word ""sandwich"" at a classy place such is total hit or miss but in this case, its a direct hit.Finally for dessert we got apple bread pudding (4/5) with green tea crumble, brown butter ice cream. The presentation was gorgeous, and came with a fruit side. Very flavorful, the green tea crumble was interesting, great ice cream.We ordered cinnamon cider and white lily cocktails, both were great (4/5).Also the decor (5/5) of this place as you can see from the photos is top notch, service was very friendly and waiters are extremely knowledgeable about the menu.For what we got, final bill was just over $200 including top and tax, it is a $$$$ yelp place so you are expecting this range.

628,9oFKlZXUDomjO7vfc0YBxQ,Jasmine X.,5.0 star rating,"Probably one of the better meals that I've had in a long, long time. At a hefty price though.I was in New York for a weekend and was looking for a good dinner spot to celebrate a friend's birthday. After scouring through a combination of Zagat articles and Yelp reviews, it seemed like Morimoto was going to be the best choice of a restaurant that would sufficiently blow my mind for the amount of money that I was paying. Luckily enough, I was able to make a reservation for dinner at 6pm on a Saturday on a Thursday. I definitely was not disappointed.My friend and I got the omasake--my first omasake yuuum. 1. Toro Tartar--such an interesting presentation and a lot of fun. It's flattened out and then there are six different seasonings that you scoop up with the tartar. I was particularly fond of the crunchy rice balls and the seaweed condiments. There was also a seaweed like paste, sour cream, avocado, and something that reminded me a bit of a ceviche flavor. Mmmm delicious. 2. Sashimi in hot oil--the hot oil was such an excellent touch to this. Can't remember what kind of sashimi it was but it was topped with mixed greens. I wrapped the mixed greens with my sashimi, lathered it up in the hot oil and it was fantastic. Really interesting touch to sashimi that I've never had before. 3. Fondue with vegetables--the fondue was really beautifully presented and was paired with a variety of vegetables hams, and bread. Fondue was alright--it was cheesy but also had a bit of an Asian flavor to it.4. Assorted Nigiri--yum yum! Excellently sized and fresh. You know that a restaurant knows what they're doing when you pick the sashimi off the rice and see the little ball of wasabi underneath.5. Oyster with uni and foie gras--really interesting take on oyster. The flavor of the oyster was a bit heavy for me but still a delightful dish.6. Mango palate cleansers! yummm. A cute little popsicle7. Wagyu steak and a grilled lobster. Steak was on a delicious bed of yams and was a perfect medium rare sear. Mmmm. Grilled lobster was also perfection and spiced with some Indian curry but still soooo good. They had another sauce to slather onto the lobster. It was two yummy meaty chunks.8. Dessert! Chocolate souffle with blueberry ice cream in a champagne flavored foam?? Excellent. The chocolate in the souffle seeped out perfectly after I had it and the champagne and blueberry ice cream went really well with how hot the souffle was.Really couldn't have asked for a better meal. Throughout the meal, the kitchen got a bit backed up so it took them a little longer to get some of the dishes out. Waiters were extremely kind and attentive to our needs. Since we were celebrating my friend's birthday, they melted a wax candle onto the dessert plate which was a classy, elegant touch. Final bill ended up being hefty, but the quality of the food and the fantastic service was absolutely worth it.

Check out the pictures of those surreal appearance of food. If you couldn't appreciate them, all I can say is that you might not be an artist by heart. What's above and beyond is the fusion with French cuisine: fondue with veggies and sausages, oyster foie gras and uni...Interior decor of Morimoto is futuristic. The lighting fixtures are particularly excellent, but details matter, right? As a a customer and outsider, I hope Morimoto could improve the seating arrangement, as well as lots of details in the decoration, such as brightness in certain area of the dining seating area, and the ugly table counter in women's bathroom.

Good but nothing fancy. 3 different varieties on separate plates along with some broth for dipping. We then shared grilled asparagus with shiitake mushrooms, a spicy yellowtail roll and Uni (sea urchin) sushi. All were very good. Spicy yellowtail wasn't smothered in mayo. It was legit. The Uni was so delicious I can't even find words to properly describe it. Best Uni I've ever had. We had sea bass in miso sauce and a Korean style bowl of rice with yellowtail. Both were good.

634,lHgNf1GVKUogXqZEEqBnMA,Ali M.,5.0 star rating,"IN SHORT: From the food to the setting, Morimoto is one of the most beautiful meals you will ever eat. And yes, you do have to check out the restrooms.THE STORY: Everything about Morimoto is stunning. From the first steps inside what feels like the white, calcified fossil of a whale's ribcage to the wall of glass bottles lining the staircase, and from the sweeping interior space with bright, sexy views of the sushi bar to the bathrooms downstairs, whose warm, mirrored walls are hard to explain on paper, the restaurant itself is a testament to the shiny, elegant interior design than has populated the neighborhood.All of these touches stand as a backdrop , however, to a menu so thoughtfully crafted by the Iron Chef himself. While the $135 Morimoto Omakase tasting menu is a worthwhile indulgence, the long sushi menu and main courses from $29-$39 offer a decadent range of expert options as well. For my most recent visit, I started with the Morimoto Sashimi that featured seared toro, salmon, tuna, hamachi, and wild shrimp in an artful display of quality and texture. One of the best and most exciting main courses offered is the Ishi Yaki Buri Bop, a yellowtail tuna on rice cooked in front of you at your table in a hot stone bowl. The bowl feels massively induglent compared to other, tighter sushi courses, but it is full of delicious surprises like alternating floral and herbaceous notes mixing with the flaky, citrusy fish. The Sea Bass with a sweet sake kasu, Japanese eggplant, and miso is also perfectly cooked and full of nuanced flavor.While the scene at Morimoto on a Friday or Saturday night might evoke more of a swanky club atmosphere less suitable for dinner with parents, there will always be local guests visiting solely for the quality of the Japanese food, and during the week, the space seems perfectly fitting for a special occasion worthy of such a beautiful setting.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I was treated to a omakase at Morimoto for my 24th birthday. Someone must think I'm REALLY special, I'm working on having their mental state evaluated...Made a reservation for two on a weekday evening, it probably wasn't needed seeing that even when we left at 8:30PM there were open tables. We ordered one omakase dinner and then shared a la carte; this is a great idea for any two diners looking for a well rounded experience of Chef Morimoto's food. I found overall that the cooked seafood dishes really shined in comparison to the sushi. Considering the price point I would venture to say the raw fish had me a bit disappointed...with the exception of the fantastic oyster (kumamoto oyster, foie gras, uni in a teriyaki sauce over sea salt). Our meal went something like this: -- Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura in 3 sauces different spicy/savory sauces...This was like a souped up version of any rock shrimp that you've seen on a Japanese menu elsewhere in Manhattan. Crunchy, fiery, fun.-- Toro Tartare in a Bamboo Box with Caviar and 6 Condiments, finished with a Japanese Berry...One of the signature dishes at Morimoto; incredibly fresh with the condiments adding unique flavor profiles to each bite of tuna. Only thing that's a bit upsetting is a smaller size is served with the omakase meal. -- Basic Vegetable Salad...Seemed like a strange choice that would be better off removed from the meal with the price adjusted accordingly. -- Oyster Foie Gras (kumamoto oyster, foie gras, uni in a teriyaki sauce) over Sea Salt. Really fresh--I'm not even an oyster fan and I was beyond impressed with the quality and prep.-- Fresh, Steamed Chicken with Fresh Vegetables...Another bizarre choice for the omakase menu but very tasty in it's simplicity. -- Fluke Carpaccio, Sashimi Sampling, Roll Samples...While I wasn't blow away by any of these, they were a big step up from you local hole-in-the-wall. -- Melon Palette Cleanser...This was a sign that I was in over my head at a restaurant. I am not this fancy. Is this necessary? Probably not. But it was tasty and will make you feel like a fancy rich person? -- Seared Wagyu Beef with Sweet Potatoes coupled with Lobster in a Half-Shell...This was the ULTIMATE surf-and-turf and perhaps my favorite part of the meal. The serving size was plentiful and everything on the plate was fantastically seasoned.-- Chocolate Cake Dessert...Not memorable, but certainly passable. My final assessment on Morimoto, it's a great experience. A bit too trendy for plain folks like us, but it was worth the money for the fun of it. When it comes to experiencing a fresh fish omakase I would stick to a place like Sushi of Gari or Tanoshi Sushi. When adding the element of fresh Japanese dishes, Morimoto's cuisine DOES reign supreme (sorry, had to).",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

In my 10+ years of eating Sushi, I've never enjoyed that particular item in any sushi restaurant anywhere. I've been converted by Morimoto and would bet a lot of money that they have one of, if not THE best Egg Custards in the city. Why the 1 star deduction? The duo of lamb chops entree was just, ok.

Ever since I first started getting into food and blogging it's been on the top of my bucket list of things I must do before I shuffle off this mortal coil.  I was excited, of course, to go to New York since I've never been before, but finally getting to go to Morimoto was the icing on the cake. We started with the Toro tartare.  This slab of beauty is garnished with caviar that you spread throughout and I paired with a dipping sauce and 6 toppings.  You dip it in a lil bit of this and then you top it with a lil bit of that...so delicious!  I was so overwhelmed that I wasn't paying attention to the waiter when he was explaining the different sauces and toppings.  Each topping had different flavor profiles and complimented the toro in different ways ...a definite must try! I wish it was a bigger slab!!!Next we had a ten hour cooked pork belly with congee and soy scallion jus - a modern twist to traditional Kakuni. Sweet and savory melt in your mouth in perfect harmony and just when you think its rich flavors are done, you cut into crispy textures that pull you back in! Loooved it!We then had the crispy rock shrimp tempura.  Erny wanted to order it and I wasn't quite sure why.  With so many unique and interesting items on the menu I was like...shrimp tempura? Really? I was pleasantly suprised by how amazeballs these things were! One was glazed with spicy kochujang sauce that blows hot wings out of the water; the other had wasabi aoli...I was eating these things like butter popcorn topped with crack. So addicting!Erny ordered the Duck Duck Duck for his main entree. It's ingredients say it all...foie gras croissant, roasted duck, a poached duck egg, and 2 dipping sauces. Zomg.  It was very rich and fatty...heaven.I ordered the roasted maine lobster topped with veggies, keffir lime, and green curry sauce. So many incredible flavors yet they didn't take away from the subtle richness of the lobster. My heart melted. *swoon*Erny and I had an incredible meal.  I was smiling the entire time!  I cannot wait to come back and try more things!  Although it ain't cheap, I highly recommended checking it out on your next trip to New York!(Photos courtesy Erny n Me....but mostly Erny.)",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
650,Q8KEm9D4tb42o7MT00DSmA,Sara L.,5.0 star rating,"A much needed review update for Morimoto. Iron Chef Morimoto simply cannot disappoint. Enter through the red curtain entrance of Morimoto and prepare to be allured by the modern and contemporary appeal of the grand interior. Sweeping white ceiling drapes, a crystal barrier in the center, white furniture, wooden tables, provide an exquisite, classy landscape for any dining occasion. As you make your way down the stairs to the lower floor, enter the ultra chic and hip bar, open during the evenings. A fancy venue, but the service here is unpretentious. Contemporary Japanese with Western elements combined, the food here is not what you call authentic Japanese. In any case, the unique fusion style is near flawless. The food goes beyond fantastic and is also simply artistic. Some notable dishes include the Morimoto Sashimi, Waygu Beef, Chilean Sea Bass, Black Cod Miso. They also offer the Morimoto Omakase ($125), which is ""chef's choice"", a true Morimoto dining experience meant to serve an entire table. Regarding the rest of the menu, it's impossible to go wrong with any order. The aforementioned raw appetizer, the Morimoto Sashimi, has become a favorite of mine. It is a combined and layered assortment of thinly, perfectly sliced sashimi with seven sauces served in tiny droppers. Exquisite, a work of art on plate, and a grand starter to your meal; it is a serving of salmon, toro, eel, hamachi, tuna, and eel. For main, the Chilean Sea Bass with grilled, seasonal vegetables has become a preferred dish of mine. Other fish entree, the Black Cod Miso is equally delectable. For those who like beef, the Waygu filet is a wonderful choice, served sizzling hot off an iron plate. It's an extremely juicy, flavorful tender steak with a side of perfectly steamed, seasoned bok choy to accompany. For those who want a preview of Morimoto without breaking the bank, I highly recommend their Restaurant Week pre-fixe $25 lunch special, available Monday through Friday. Without a doubt, Morimoto's pre-fixe is perhaps one of the best ones you'll experience in the city. The special is a choice between two bento boxes, Sea Bass or the Waygu Beef filet. The bento box includes a variety of sushi rolls, salad, vegetable tempura, and miso soup. Lastly, they give you two different options for dessert. Last visit, I had a Black Sesame Panna Cotta, beautifully presented and unique in taste. I had the Sea Bass bento box in my past two Restaurant Week visits, and it has been consistently satisfactory. No formula has ever changed. If considering a non-alcoholic beverage, try the Morimoto Iced Tea, a combination of refreshing iced tea, Calpico, and muddled blueberries.Consistency is key at Morimoto. I've always noticed how the dishes are artfully, cleanly presented, and the food always tastes as good as it looks. I am a huge fan of Morimoto, and this comes from many visits.

Came for lunch restaurant week menu (didn't have to ask for it, it was already included with the regular menu---super plus)Got the cod and friend got the waygu beef. We were surprised how big the waygu beef was--bigger than the fish O.O! The waygu beef came with a lot of different condiments on the side such as sautéed mushroom and a flavorless baby green pepper. Beef was cooked perfectly with a nice seared on the outside. Again, no wow factor, just a perfectly cooked waygu beef, flavored salt & pepper, it's something I can find at a steak restaurant.Fish was a bit disappointing for me and didn't live up to the hype. It's flavored well, cooked perfectly, a tat salty but overall not bad but not amazing. The black things are bean--tasted like a cross of red bean and black bean. The colorful pepper stripes didn't add to anything.Both dishes came with miso soup, salad, seaweed/sweet tofu skin, and pickled cucumbers, and rice.We were here anyways, so why not splurge on their infamous $31 toro tartare? The toro was fresh and the typical regular tasting toro tartare. What was unique about it and that made the bite interesting was the sauce provided. You dip into the soy then into one of the 6 sauces/topping combo. Any way you mix and matched it, it's was a blast of unique flavor in the mouth! FIrst timer- must get! --- I love the wasabi- fresh and a hint of sweetness =) Dessert- got both the coffee panna cotta and the lemon pistachio mouse cake. Both cooked perfectly at the right consistency. Flavor-wise --- Not wow but still very good.We were stuffed by then. I think the dessert did the trick.Another tip, check out the bathroom.

It was a restaurant I wouldn't come back to because it was just mediocre food at a very expensive price. I ordered two entrees, duck & their lobster and neither of them impressed me. I gave it 3 stars, 1 for their amazing decor and the other 2 for their decent food. There was nothing special about it. It was food you can eat anywhere else and it would taste the same.I said I wouldn't be back here again but I came back last Friday because of a girlfriends birthday. Boy am I glad I did because this time around I LOVED the food!!! I definitely ordered the wrong items last time. I started off with their morimoto ice tea and it was lightly sweetened and very refreshing. For appetizers,Oyster Foie Gras -  Oysters with foie gras and uni on top --- I'm use to squeezing lemon juice on my oysters but this one didn't come with lemons. It tasted like the OCEAN! It's a nice combination but I don't think this is for anyone who can't stand the ocean taste. It came with 3 oysters for $21 which is pretty pricey. Sauteed Foie Gras & Grilled Eel -- OH HEAVEN! The pairing of the two is perfection. I'm a big foie gras fan and morimoto definitely made it the best best best! It was like warm butter that melted in your mouth except it was foie gras. I felt like I wanted to order another one! This was  $24 and it was worth every penny.Miso Glazed Bone Marrow -- I don't think i've ever had bad bone marrow but this one was definitely different than the rest. It was Japanese style bone marrow with sake ikura on it mmm yummy. For entree,Ishi Yaki Buri Bop - Yellow tail on rice in a hot stone bowl -- It's like the korean bibimbap except its with raw yellow tail. I did not like this one bit. It was like warm but cold, like half cooked sushi. The flavor was bland. Maybe I needed to put some wasabi and soysauce on it. I barely touched this.Sushi/Sashimi - Eel avocado roll, very fresh and perfectly riped avocado. Definitely an upgrade from the ones you usually eat a sushi restaurantSea urchin Uni - WAAAA MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH ! Super super fresh slimey uni. Loved! I can eat 10 of these. Awabi sashimi - ABALONE for sushi ... what !??! Yeah raw abalone sashimi, a first timer for this one! It was scrumptious!!!! I will be on the search for awabi at jap restaurants from now but I rarely see it on the menu. It was $10 for 1 piece of sashimi but it was definitely worth it.

The hostess offered us a seat at the bar downstairs until our table was ready.At the bar I had a drink consisting of prosecco, st. germain, and something else that I can't remember. But what I do remember is that it was delicious, and that's what counts. Right after I had finished my drink a hostess came down to the bar area to let us know our table was ready. I was impressed with how attentive the staff was.Now, for what you guys really care about. My boyfriend and I split a shrimp tempura appetizer that was amazing. I'm glad we split this because it was way too much for one person.  For an entree we had chirashi sushi, which again was more than enough food for one person.  The sushi was incredibly fresh. Service was great as well, even though the place looked extremely busy.I would go back!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
658,4kHQQ2DP_G1nYTUnl9zNCw,Cuppy E.,4.0 star rating,"I was doing some shopping in the meatpacking district so I decided to go to Morimoto. I've been here at least 6 times before and the food is always excellent. I always stick to the appetizers and hot dishes because I find the sushi/sashimi to be either a hit or a miss. I went to the Philly location last year and I thought their sashimi tasted better than the one here. I ordered the Tuna pizza and the crispy rock shrimp tempura as my appetizers and they were amazing. The rock shrimp are covered in two different sauces and comes with a dipping aioli on the side. The tuna pizza was very good as well although it's a bit messy to eat.For my entree, I ordered the tempura calamari salad and an order of the oyster foie gras. Truth be told, I usually come here only for the oysters. This dish is often imitated but never duplicated. OMG. These oysters are fantastic. If you love uni, oysters and foie gras, then this is the dish for you. It combines the perfect balance of sweet salty creaminess with warm oysters. What's not to love. The salad is huge and it comes with several chunks of calamari and it has a delicious white miso dressing. I ordered two cocktails. The white lily and the morimotini and I found the white lily to be the better of the two. It's sweeter whereas the morimotini tasted like pure vodka and cucumbers. Order it if you prefer your drinks to be on the stronger side.Overall, I would recommend this place as it has something for everyone, even meat eaters. I've had their steaks in the past and they were amazing. They could use a remodeling for the upstairs and the lounge area. Some parts of the restaurant look dingy and bare. The waitstaff were attentive and service was solid.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
659,x3sL7htE8xgWDePwLxx-1Q,Cerca T.,5.0 star rating,"I don't think Morimoto needs glowing review #1964, but I owe it to all you peons, as I sit on my ivory white horse atop Mount Pious. This place is classy and impeccable, the service is as good as you can imagine and the food is really worth the hype. Came here for a company dinner, all 30+ of us served family-style. Here's my comprehensive (yet poetic) review: ::clears throat::Drinks+ White Lily Shirayuri - a grapefruit/yuzu-type cocktail. Refreshing, not too sweet+ Morimoto version of a Negroni - nice and citrusy, delicious! I believe it was called a ""Horoginai?"" something like thatAppetizers+ Chef-Selected Raw Bar - a gorgeous, round platter of Kumamoto oysters, lobster tails and claws and big pieces of crab. Beyond fresh and tender. The oysters were briny, delicious. These platters were devoured.+ Kakuni (10-hour slow roasted pork) - served on a bed of congee and crispy noodle things on top. This pork just melts in your mouth and the soy/scallion jus makes it even better. This ain't your mama's slowcooker pork.+ Tuna Pizza - hyyyuuunnnggghhhhhhh, just give me this all the time. A crispy, thin base, covered in the freshest, brightest tuna that simply melts in your mouth, adorned with sliced tomatoes, olives and jalapeno. Wasabi aoli and micro cilantro on top. I mean, this goes for $19 on the regular menu, and I could just eat 5 of these. Right now. At 10am. (Micro cilantro??? who am I?)+ Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura - I had the privilege of sitting right in front of this thing, and I think I nibbled on it for over an hour. A bunch of wasabi-coated, tempura-battered, heavenly deep-fried rock shrimps and the other, slathered in delectable gochujang (a Korean sriracha, if you will). HEAVEN. This was a play on buffalo wings, cuz it was served with a ranch dipping sauce (lol) with matching celery for dipping (lol). Delicious, crispy, fresh, just really good. A table favorite, for sure.Mains+ Chef's Selected Sushi - we each split 5 assorted pieces of sushi, 1 cucumber roll and 1 yellowtail jalapeno roll (it could have been toro, but not sure). Really nice palate cleanser in between all the bold flavors. The cucumber roll you could skip, but that yellowtail/toro was like butter. Perfectly rolled, the rice wasn't too clumpy or sticky, and the fish was impeccable. Nice hit of spice at the end. Glad I got to try some basics here - they are exactly as good as you'd expect. (I thought I found my amazing sushi in Park Slope and am now ruined forever. Thanks, Morimoto.)+ Braised Black Miso Cod - this was a gorgeous cod filet, seemingly basted forever in a glorious ginger soy reduction. It was caramelized, yet tender and perfectly cooked. Flaked apart just by looking at it. Really superb.+ Prime Aged NY Strip - a solid piece of meat, cooked about medium. As it landed on the table, our server hit it with a splash of onion and garlic jus, which steamed the slices up and gave it a little kick of flavor. It was certainly delicious, but it was just OK compared to everything else. That being said, I've had better steak in many places. (I think NY needs to be medium-rare, max. Too chewy.)+ Sides - Chinese broccoli (my favorite thing ever) and bok choy, both perfectly cooked and mouthwateringly delicious.Dessert+ Green Tea Mille Crepe - light, creamy, heavenly. Not too much matcha flavor, which I was grateful for. At this point, I was ready to roll out of there, so I didn't focus too much on the dessert. But the pieces are big enough to split, for sure. Served with a little ball of Ferrero Rocher gelato and some crispy rice (cute).+ Banana Cream Puffs - some basic cream puffs (yawn), but it had chunks of caramelized bananas on top, with roasted banana gelato. The extra stuff of top was super yummy. Also, there was Cracker Jacks around it - very cool dessert. Had to make room for this one :)Overall, a superb dinner and real great experience. The drinks were strong, the service was great and it was all made better by being surrounded by close friends and coworkers. I recommend this place for any special occasion, certainly an anniversary or the like. Really worth it.Notes: They seriously lack bathrooms in this place. For such a big place, they only have a single restroom upstairs and only 2 more downstairs. That's about it.Also: You can actually get a doggy bag - don't be shy. I have some NY strip and Chinese broccoli waiting for me at home... :)::sigh:: now I return to my mediocre Park Slope sushi and dream of one day returning to Morimoto....",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The waiter described what it was served with - I was like - are you kidding me?  It was one tiny square (when you dice a pepper) of a red, green and yellow pepper.  I mean...why even bother.  No rice, nothing.Do not come here hungry!The halibut with black bean broth was too salty, small, but at least the fish was fresh.Personally I am done spending a lot of $$ on such tiny portions where the food quality isn't at all what it should be for the cost.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

It usually ranged from mostly passable to good which is the only reason I gave two instead of one stars. I used to live around the corner and came here three times before I learned my lesson, gave up and just stuck with Naka Naka. The ambiance is slick and overdone, I think. It's ultra modern and space-loungey and all around trying WAY too hard to be tragically hip and ending up just being tragic. There's something a LOT more douchey about the wait staff who were by and large horrible. I often felt like informing them that I lived around the corner and would be a regular customer were they only to give decent service, but knew it would make no impact. They were snobby, gross, mean, dismissive and often the wait was long. Do yourself a favor and skip this place. If you are in the neighborhood, go to Naka Naka instead.

The downstairs washrooms are a giggle, too!My only complaint: our server was not very accomplished, seemingly hurried for no reason whilst not listening to us, and never around.

The presentation was clever but really, in the end, very disappointing. The amount of tuna in this dish would amount to not even a tablespoon.  But they slather the tuna into a paper thin layer on this chrome platter. Now if the one tablespoon of tuna was off-the-chart tasty, then maybe I would be singing a different song, but this was just ordinary tuna mash.  Not even top quality. I know top quality.  Before coming to Morimoto, my family and I went on a high-end sushi-eating binge at some of the best sushi places. Our trip started in LA and I'm going to give you the names of the sushi joints in LA because they deserve to be mentioned because they make Morimoto seem like an amateur.If you get the chance, visit these sushi places in LA (in this order)1)  Nobu2) Sugarfish3) HaneBack to the review...ROCK SHRIMP TEMPURA--Good, but this is Morimoto.  Expected a lot better than just OK.SPICY TUNA ROLL--Not up to par.  Just like you would get in any regular sushi place. In fact, we had a spicy tuna roll in an airport that beat this one.OMAKASE (Chef's assorted nigiri pieces)--Every one of these paled deeply in comparison to the sushi we had at the previously mentioned sushi restaurants.  The quality just wasn't there.I don't mind paying good $$$ when the quality is there.  But paying bookoo bucks for run-of-the-mill sushi hurts.It was honestly a very surreal experience.  I couldn't believe I was eating average sushi in Morimoto's restaurant.Was it a bad day?  Maybe.  Sushi chef sick?  Who knows.  But for whatever reason, we were all very disappointed.  And if Morimoto sat at that table, eating the food we ate, he would be disappointed too.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We were seated pretty quickly and sat comfortably with the view of the glass bottle back drop and the sushi bar/ kitchen area. I got a ton suggestions and tips from people who've been here (surprisingly, many people have said to skip their sushi...) and instead of going for the omakase menu (as advised and with a leap of faith) we decided to with 4 appetizers, 2 entrees, a dessert and an order of sake (plenty filling for 2...if you walk in hungry)! Appetizers:Toro Tartare - a must try! It's yummy and fun to eat! The whole dish just melts into your mouth.  Zen Sai - an assortment of seasonal Japanese delicacies which included food from the land and the sea (see pics below)! It was again, beautifully assembled and yummyIshi Yaki (hot appetizer)- a beautiful assortment of sauces and dip to go with tender and delicate waygu beef slices, though I thought the dish was pretty and fun to eat, it was not one of my favorites.. Miso glazed roasted bone marrow - Love love love, this dish is a steal compared to the rest of the menu and a must try! Wonderfully cooked and seasoned! Entrees - I was a little less impressed with the entrees after having an assortment of appetizers but still very good...! We got the Ishi Yaki Bury Bop (which tasted duller than the appetizers and was not my favorite nor the best bury bop I've had) and the duck duck duck (was just okay, I was also getting too full at this point) Dessert - Matcha tiramisu, which was good  Overall, we did get to save a little by skipping the omakase and I really enjoyed being here (and as a comparison it was a much better experience than megu...)P.S. this place is conveniently located next to the high line...perfect for walking it off!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

One thing that noticed about Japanese or Asian restaurants is that the restroom are usually interesting. Morimoto has an extremely hard to pull/push door to open but its very cute. The setting is kinda intimate, semi dim lighting and not loud. Now on to the food, We ordered the rock shrimp for apps, which was way better than Buddakan's rock shrimp! Seared scallop (for apps also ), which was soft and well seasoned. Entree, I had the salmon with a side of bok choy, unfortunately my salmon and bok choy was not spectacular or different from any other sushi spot in NYC. My Bf  ordered the Sea bass with a side of asparagus, unfortunately he did not enjoy it, he stated that the sea bass cut was too big, I actually enjoyed his meal.

On to Drinks, a bottle of sake and lychee martini, I'm a fan of lychee martini, I NEED THAT ALL THE TIME IN MY LIFE LOL.

Needless to say, we had a great time here. For appetizers, we had the Toro Tartare, the Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura, and the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio. I felt that the Toro Tartare was my least favorite of the three (not saying that it's bad, just not my favorite) because it was small and the flavor didn't provide any ""wow-factor"". However, the presentation was nice. The Rock Shrimp Tempura was excellent. The tempura didn't feel oily or flaky at all. It was light  and it provided a nice crispy texture to the shrimp. I also greatly enjoyed the carpaccio. It was my first time having Wagyu Beef and I must say, I can see where the hype derives from. It's so tender and it melts in your mouth. For entrees, I had the Sea Bass and she had the Surf and Turf. Out of the two, we both preferred the Sea Bass. The portion was nicely sized, the fish was delicious, and the avocado tempura was incredible. The gf greatly dislikes eggplant, but the eggplant that came with the Sea Bass dish tasted more like plantain than eggplant. Therefore, she actually LIKED it. The Surf and Turf was just ""good"" at best. Beef was lightly charred and tasty, while the hamachi ribbons had a nice kick with the jalapenos in the crushed citrus and avocado sauce it came with. However, it wasn't an awe-inducing dish. So, a little about myself: I am NOT a huge fan of dessert. However, I decided to get the Tofu Cheesecake and she ordered the Chilled Cheesecake Souffle. And... WOW. The Tofu Cheesecake was so light, fluffy, and not overly-sweet. It comes with a few chocolate flakes on top to add a bit of sweetness. The fruits and ice cream adds a nice touch to the dish as well. I tried some of the Chilled Cheesecake and that was amazing as well. I think I would have to say that dessert just may have been my favorite part of the meal!

If it were not for salt, then the chef would literally not know how to cook. I drank an entire bottle of water and two green teas to try to get my mouth to stop tasting salt. But it didn't help. The damage was done. Appetizers:- Tuna Tartar - delicious and great presentation. (sadly, it is absolutely NOTHING when compared to that of Zuma)- Yu-burrata - AMAZING! probably the reason I give this place 2 stars instead of none- Wagyu Beef Carpaccio - extremely salted but very soft- Diver Scallop Ceviche - great presentation and tasteSpicy Tuna Roll - yes, I know, typical... but very goodMain:- Duck Duck Duck - interesting and well made- 20 oz. Australian Wagyu Ribeye with white truffle (extra) - HORRIBLE! More salt than I've ever had on a steak! It was like tasting salted rubber! I don't think I've ever actually sent a steak back, but this one, well, I had no other choice! It was upsetting seeing the white truffles leave my sight, but the steak forced me to consume water and green tea to just fight off the salt. It looked so pretty, yet was such a disappointment!

My sister told the waitress to bring bday cake out to ""the girl who is seated in between the two young men"" but presented the birthday cake to one of the guys at the table!!! My fiancé is allergic to shellfish and TWICE they placed a shellfish dish in front of him and we had to remind them he was allergic. More than twice one of the people in our party was served a good five minutes after everyone else.  We waited 30 minutes in between each dish which is NOT normal for omakase, we were there for hours on hours.  We waited for drinks 25 minutes multiple times.  All of this is so unacceptable for what is supposed to be a top notch restaurant, especially at this price.The food itself was good but our main dish which was surf and turf was served ice cold!

We started with some sashimi and maki.  The salmon and yellowtail sashimi was incredibly fresh.  The lobster kimchi maki was delicious with just enough kick.  The asparagus and soft shell crab maki was also incredible as was the spicy salmon.For my meal, I got the seafood toban yaki.  It's so good that I have not been able to bring myself to get anything else the last few times.  It's loaded with seafood and the red miso broth tastes like lobster bisque but is lighter and not nearly as bad for you!  My wife had the duck, duck, duck which had a delicious duck breast croissant and then the thigh with different sauces.  It was excellent.The dessert this time was stunning though.  Green tea tiramisu.  Insane.  A smooth creamy green tea paste at the bottom, then green tea cake, then sour cherries, topped with a mascarpone cream and green tea crumbles.  Never had a tiramisu like this.  Put even my mom's homemade tiramisu to shame.There's a reason why I come to Morimoto every time I can when am in NYC!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I loved this place because:- the decor is simple, elegant and beautiful- service was spectacular. it's the service you'd expect at a nice, but also hip establishment. - the food was extremely creative. a few highlights:     * The burrata was so delicious (think explosive amazingness (that's what she said) when you cut into it. it's like a molten lava cake except fatty and buttery and tasty cheese comes out. On top: truffle and wasabi. a very unexpected flavor combination that worked so well on the (very) buttered and oiled toasts      * Surf and turf - perfectly cooked wagyu beef served with ""hamachi ribbons"" that are in a guac-like presentation with .. tomatoes! super delish      * oysters... STEAMED (they look raw when you first look at them) with foie gras and umi on top. it's the most blow-your-mind mouthful of ocean, butter, and cream all at once. the oysters were huge.I will admit I was surprised by the mixed crowd. I came here after having cocktails at the Top of the Standard .. and the first thing my boyfriend said was 'why are there SO many kids?!"" I thought this would be an uber hip dinner that was a lotta cocktails (I wasn't too wowed by them) and a see be seen type place.

We started with drinks; she had the Morimoto iced tea, which was interesting (in a good way) and I tried the orange blossom cocktail and it was so good. I can tell how amazing a bartender is by how little I can detect the sting of alcohol in a cocktail (while still getting tipsy) and this drink tasted like sparkling orange juice and I got quite a buzz so kudos to the bartender.For our appetizer, we ordered the toro tartare which was SO good. You can go to youtube and search for ""Best Thing I Ever Ate Toro Tartare"" to see Duff (from ""Ace of Cakes"") describe his experience eating the dish. It was one of the most unique, decadent, amazing dishes I've ever eaten.We tried the wagyu beef bento box and the braised black cod bento box ($25, great deal for the amount of food). The beef and cod were both a bit too salty for our tastes but I loved everything else. I was surprised to see actual sushi being served with the bento (instead of something lame like a California roll) and the salad was vibrant and fresh and topped with what looked and tasted like deep fried orange blossom petals. The bento boxes come with dessert too - panna cotta, which was light, creamy, and yummy.We also ordered a salmon skin roll, which was prepared perfectly.To end our meal, we got the flourless chocolate cake (recommended by our awesome waitress). Because even though the bento boxes came with dessert, we were at Morimoto! Why not go all out? It was served with caramel popcorn and green tea pear sorbet and it was so good.The staff were all really personable and attentive and our waitress was so friendly and nice and we loved her.Lastly, I need to comment on how lovely the bathrooms were.

I think this may be the fanciest place I've ever dined at... but don't quote me on it. Came here after stopping by Chelsea Market and had dinner plans for Morimoto. Just uttering the name as it leaves the tip of my tongue already gives me mind-numbing goosebumps. Came as a party of 4 and upon sitting down I already noticed the partition was clear glass, but later I noticed it frosted over... some kind of voodoo magic to set the ambiance. We started with a liquid form of appetizers known as professionally-crafted cocktails. So cleverly crafted and went down really well. Before I finished my first cocktail, I was already morphing to my alter ego. Our waitress was such a sport. I have a bit of a sailor's mouth on me and she kept her composure and played along. I like that about people, especially when they're working. I visited Morimoto in the summer of 2012 for dinner (aka BANK)... so I'll try to remember what I can by popping a gingko pill. The nitty gritty of what was ordered:~4-6 individually crafted cocktails. The cucumber cocktail is a must try. Very refreshing!-angry chicken ""angry bird""-Maine lobster-omakase/sashimi platter-donburi-seared scallop-2 bottles of Chardonnay -a free bday dessert for me... some kind of ice cream with an edible ""happy birthday"" chocolate bannerAll in all, this is a very unique and special dining experience. If you're trying to win over someone or possibly propose or even a random romantic surprises... this is the place to go above and beyond. It's sure is expensive...

700,7SsGRl4z8rCdvTz-J1n26w,Liv A.,5.0 star rating,"I have been a Chef Masaharu Morimoto fanatic since I was a kid.  I'd watch every episode of the original Iron Chef series even though it was in Japanese and I couldn't understand anything they were saying.  When he came on Iron Chef America, I kept watching.  I always appreciated Chef Morimoto's creative take on innovative Japanese cuisine and the aesthetics on his presentation for each dish.  An ice sculpture with tropical plants serving as a platter for a trio of fish or some new way to eat a deconstructed udon to accentuate the flavor profiles of each of the ingredients....these are examples of how Chef M. always incorporates thought into his craft.  He also uses the concept of umami.  Chef Morimoto is such a personable public figure, you can't help but just fall in love with his enthusiastic, fun personality.Although there is a Morimoto in Napa, I still haven't tried it yet.  When in Manhattan, I took this as the perfect opportunity to try the Morimoto there.  Bf and I headed over to Chelsea for a weekday lunch.  We had a reservation and were seated immediately.  The restaurant was modern and sheik in decor.  It's everything you would expect for a Morimoto establishment..... pleasing to the eye and very welcoming.  The host and wait staff were very professional and provided excellent service.  We even chatted with the waitress a bit and asked about Chef.  She said that he was opening a few other locations so he doesn't frequent the NY one as much these days.  She also shared with us that their staff would watch the Iron Chef America episodes together upstairs when some of their sous chefs from the NY Morimoto were featured.  I thought that was awesome that they had a great comradery among their staff members. Since we were eating our way through Manhattan, bf and I went with a few choices for a light lunch.  Everything on the menu looked amazing but we decided to pick and choose wisely:-Toro tartare:  I saw this Morimoto signature dish many years ago on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate.  I have been wanting to try it since.  Besides, I love toro.  First, the presentation was just incredible.  Second, the innovative way of eating it with spoons of the various condiments not only accentuated all the different flavors but added fun in eating it period.  The little bits of rice crackers gave the toro a nice crunch and texture.  Soooo gooood all around.  Also, the caviar was a nice touch as well. -Wagyu carpaccio: thin slices of wagyu beef seared with hot chili oil....melt in your mouth goodness.  I'm normally not one for beef nor carpaccios (I prefer my beef not to be bloody).  However, this take on the carpaccio was perfect.  It was flavorful and not completely raw so that I could appreciate it much more.  Also presented beautifully as expected.  -$55 Sashimi: chef's choice of fish which included a good assortment of sashimi that was fresh fresh fresh fresh.  The fish had that rainbow tint on it as if it was just plucked out of the sea and served up on the platter.  Each type of fish was grade A and the variation provided nice distinct flavors.  The fish was sweet and just melted in our mouths.  I have no idea how they make the smoked salmon bc it's raw but is infused with a smokey flavor.  Actually, I take that back....I believe I've seen Chef Morimoto make that on Iron Chef before.  Anyway I digress, but I never had anything like it before and it was incredible.  I'm normally not too crazy about the white fishes but everything was exceptional.-Salmon sashimi: again, super fresh and delicious as ever.  Total tab was $150 for our light lunch.  One of the best sushi experiences I've had in a long time.  I was thoroughly pleased.  I can't wait to try the Napa Morimoto now that I'm back in the Bay!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The place was packed, and we were squeezed into seats located in the middle of a long table that seated another 20 or so people. It definitely felt like we were packed in like sardines. Not the fine dining experience I was hoping for. I have to preface this by saying I have had a lot of authentic Japanese food, and this food is just not that inspired and definitely does not deserve the hype. I ordered a salmon roll, the saba, the myoga, and the ishi yaki buri bop, which was our waiter's favorite dish. If you've had korean food before, this is just non-spicy dolsot bibimbop with sweet soy sauce and pieces of cooked yellowtail on top. Definitely not anything exciting. The sushi was of average quality and did not leave me wanting more. One of my friends tried the special New Year's Eve $150 omakase, and she felt the food was underwhelming. The only redeeming dishes that we tried were the desserts. Both the chilled cheesecake and the dessert that came with the omakase meal were excellent.I will also complement the service.

You're given little spatula-spoons to scoop the toro and micro-toppings, eating it nimble by nimble. It's not even bite by bite. It's like centimeter by centimeter. It definitely could have used some carbs to spread on to make eating it less slow/awkward.Chirashi - A surprisingly large portion that comes with an assortment of sashimi. It didn't blow me away though.Surf & Turf - Comes with a nice strip of wagu, slices of hamachi, and a small potato cake.Yellowtail stone bowl - They mix up the contents and sauce in front of you.

So - why 3 stars?  Ding one star for the prices, which are painfully high for what you get.  And ding one star for there being better, especially in this part of town.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

726,BYDGyjPeucvB1RyRC1Y7wQ,Sarah G.,5.0 star rating,"Just scored a last second lunch reservation at Morimoto for restaurant week. Honestly, my expectations were not super high. I'd read some good things about the quality of their sushi, but was also anticipating snooty, pretentious service, and less focus on the quality of food,  as indicated in the ny times review. Well, I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here, both in the food and the service. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, and the food (I ordered the sashimi platter) definitely blew me away. After having sushi in LA last month, my eyes were opened to a whole new standard of freshness I had not yet experienced on the east coast. Today, however, I learned my lesson that this standard does exist in NY, but at a much higher price. However, thanks to restaurant week's $25 lunch prix fixe, I got my fix for a very modest price. On my plate was toro, hamachi, soba (mackerel), fluke (i'm guessing), and salmon. Mackerel can be particularly risky to order in NY, as it can be very pungent when not at its freshest. The mackerel here was outstanding; clean and delicious. Easily the best i've had. Each slice of fish seemed better than the last. The platter also came with a side salad, miso soup, hijiki, and kimchi cucumbers. The salad was dressed with what tasted like a miso citrus vinaigrette with crunchy sesame seeds. The crunchy sesame topping was so good. I would have licked my bowl clean if it were culturally acceptable restaurant behavior! The miso was probably the best i've had, with big chunks of asymmetrical tofu floating about, rather than the tiny diced tofu you generally get. The hijiki was standard but good. The kimchi cucumbers were refreshing and had a nice chili kick. The two desserts they offered were also surprisingly good: one reminiscent of a lemon custard with crushed pistachios and a scoop of ice cream, and the other a layered coffee dessert with this delicious crunchy toasted crumble. But as dessert is not really my thing, i'll skip this is my review.  I really enjoyed my experience here, and between mouthfuls of sashimi was already plotting my next trip back! The atmosphere is also super intimate and sexy. I can't wait to come back on a date and try out some of their cocktails as well!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
727,1McXyYdfnG_MBQdGYv7HPw,Alexander K.,4.0 star rating,"FIrst off, I want to state that this restaurant is beautiful. Even before entering, the exterior is covered in a repetition of tied draped deep-red cloth covering the glass door entrance. The interior itself is very modern with facades of glass with wooden furnishings and soft tones of white/beige all around the restaurant.Anyways, on to the review. My girlfriend and I shared the toro tartare appetizer which our server had suggested; the signature appetizer of the restaurant. Served on a wooden paddle with caviar and six various accoutrements, it was indeed a pleasure on the eyes as well as the palate. The tuna had a rich texture and flavor, and we opted for the accoutrements on the right side of the secondary wooden dish since the creme fraiche and wasabi paste didn't appeal to us too much. Also, the two drinks that we ordered (ginger lemonade and white lilly) were wonderful as well; reminiscent of the non-alcoholic drink pairing we had at Rogue 24 earlier this year.For the entrees I had the lobster with I thought was supposed to be served raw since it was under the ""raw bar"" category, but it came out steamed and chilled. The server later explained that restaurants in NYC are prohibited from serving raw lobster, but nonethless it was satisfying, the lobster was thoughtfully cracked in the right places, the presentation was beautiful, and it was accompanied by 4 different dipping sauces and two different type of delicate fruits which I don't remember the name of. My girlfriend opted for the wagyu beef sandwich, which was crafted well and accompanied by sweet pickles and fried onion rings.Finally we finished off with their inventive interpretation of flourless chocolate cake which was very rich and had a great texture, topped off with caramel popcorn and a delicious serving of green tea ice cream with chopped fruit underneath. All in all it was a solid meal with great presentation, but I would say it lacked the extra ""wow"" factor which makes me unable to give the restaurant a 5 star rating.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Sushi-wise, Morimoto's rice is definitely a lot more seasoned than other sushi joints I went to in the past. It was so seasoned that I found I didn't need any soy sauce at all. After awhile, I thought the rice overwhelmed the fish (especially milder tasting varieties such as tuna). But still very, very good.The fish was extremely fresh and ridiculously delicious. You know you're getting the good cuts here. No fake wasabi here either. The chefs here portion their wasabi accordingly to the richness of the fish.

730,CwMAksh2qSz6igXn1q8Zzw,Mary C.,3.0 star rating,"Morimoto Restaurant, eponymously named after it's creator Masahru Morimoto of Food Network's Food Network's Iron Chef , was near the top of my dining establishment hitlist during a short trip to New York City. Most popular with their Omakase menu, Morimoto also offers an a la cart menu that would please anyone looking for an Asian-fusion dining experience.DECOR: The decor of Morimoto is a confusing work of art. A maze of translucent Plexiglass shapes the room, separating the crowded tables. Scattered throughout this maze is an open kitchen, a pretentious looking bar, and sporadic fixtures providing dim lighting to the room. This place has a esoteric vibe, giving you the impression that this was where it's all happening. You are at the very center of it all and there's no cooler place to be right now, than to be dining at Morimoto'sDRINKS:They have an extensive wine and cocktail list here, and after long deliberation we went with the Selbach Reisling. Sweet, frangrant, and went down like candy. FOOD:Yellowtail Pastrami ($21) - togarashi, gin creme fraiche, and candided oliveThe yellow tail pastrami was an attempt at an adventurous order, as you don't often see the words ""yellowtail"", and ""pastrami"" next to each other. I really had no clue what to expect. I personally wasn't overly amorous of this appetizer. It had a fishy aftertaste, which may be just the nature of yellow tail. A neat concept to serve sashimi fish pastrami style, but it didn't work for me.Hamachi Tartare($25) - osetra caviar, sour cream, wasabi, and dashi-soyThe tartare is served on a flat tray with a dollop of caviar. To consume, you scoop a small spatula full of the fish, and dip it into the accompanying sauces. Almost felt like making a lollipop!Morimoto style Chirashi ($33) - 10-12 different fish and vegetablesThe chirashi is underwhelming at first glance, but as you work your way through it you realize it's a solid bowl of rice and fish. It's filled to the brim with perfectly made sushi rice and bite size cubes of fish of great variety.Duck, Duck, Duck ($32) - foie gras croissant, roast duck, soft duck egg, red miso sauceI ordered the Duck Duck Duck, as a result of successful menu marketing. I admit if it weren't for the name, it might not have ordered it. The dish came on a gigantic plate that literally took up my entire table space. The duck however was delicious! A runny duck egg, crispy skinned duck leg, and a duck breast sandwich. The style of this dish wasn't too far off from Chinese style roasted duck, but the meat was in fact much more juicy and rich.OVERALL THOUGHTS:Considering the location, the amount of food, and the wine that we had, this bill was not outrageous at all. Surprising, since I went in with the impression that it would cost me an arm and a leg. Mind you, not everything was spectacular, but decent enough to have me come back to this socialite haven.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

He doesn't stop at the food level. This Iron Chef gets down to the plumbing level. We are talking about toilets with embedded bidets that will leave your entire backside clean, massaged, and wanting more. This is what makes Morimoto an Iron Chef.  Your mouth and taint will thank you. Incredible...  Food/Drinks==========Took us a minute to get our table, so we had a chance to explore the downstairs bar and drink menu. The Lotus Blossom came highly recommended, made with gin (Bombay), a Japanese citrus liquor called Yuzu (rumor has it this is very hard to find outside of Morimoto's restaurants), and a Japanese soft drink called Calpico. I could down these one after another. Not sure if I'd make it up the stairs back to my table though.Appetizers---------------Once I did make it to my table, I was ready to attack the appetizers. Morimoto Sashimi is a 5x5 - 5 sashimi squares stacked on top of each other, with 5 sauces in tiny squeeze bottles for ultra precision - seared toro, salmon, eel, tuna, and hamachi. Melts in your mouth and the combination so carefully thought out that you should be able to distinguish each layer in the small sashimi square.The steamed scallop is marinated in XO sauce.  Dry scallop sauce on freshly steamed scallops - doesn't take a celebrity judge on Iron Chef to recognize the thought behind this artistic pairing.  This with the sashimi definitely set a level of expectation for the rest of the meal on which the Morimoto's kitchen delivered.Entrees-----------The sea bass - marinated with sweet sake, served with Japanese eggplant, and miso.  Full of flavor and super tender, this sea bass was incredible, just falling off the fork. Nothing more to be said about a beautifully prepared fish like this.Duck, duck, duck - get the f$*k out of here with that evil genius dude.  Duck 3 ways - 1) foie gras croissant (suck it California) - good foie gras is good foie gras. Period.2) roast duck - skin is as good as the meat - crispy goodness. meat is the perfect combination of tender, fat, and chewy.3) soft duck egg - ok I'll go with it.  I appreciate the art form.Dessert-----------I see the words Warm Chocolate Cake and my stomach automagically makes extra room. Can't explain it. Put Morimoto's Iron Chef spin on it and you get it with Japanese dark sugar syrup, rhubarb sauce, a side of ice cream, and some sweet caramel popcorn.  After this dessert, you will want to put on some sneakers and check out the running track along the West Side Highway. Although I didn't meet Morimoto during my visit, this menu iron chef'd the crap out of me. Everyone should experience this place at least once in their life.Also - toilets from the future.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Came here on Christmas eve and I was pretty surprised the restaurant wasn't packed. The restaurant looks pretty swanky inside but the table we had was in a side room and some of the tables were very close together. Decided to get the omakase (DUH). It was $120 a person but very worth it. Course #1: Their infamous toro tartare. The toro was so fresh and I love how it was presented in a little bamboo plate with a variety of accompaniments ranging from guacamole to freshly grated wasabi and seaweed. Course #2: Sashimi of yellowtail. Very fresh fish as usual and came drizzled with a ponzu/soy sauce. Course #3: Very interesting fondue type with anchoives in hot oil dipping sauce. This was probably my least favorite course. They gave very strange things to dip in the hot oil like a tomato or green onionCourse #4: Kumamoto oysters steamed with foie gras, uni (sea urchin), and teriyaki glaze. Normally i'm not a fan of oysters and uni but none of it had any fishy taste. Course #5: sashimi platter of 5 different types of fishes. Course #6: Lobster and Wagyu beef- one of my favorite courses. The lobster was cooked perfectly with a garlic asian taste and the wagyu beef was tender Course #7: Dessert: fig chocolate cake dessert. The chocolate cake was moist and wasn't overly sweet. It taste like those asian chocolate cakes you get. Came with a green tea ice creamOverall service was good. Drinks were always refilled and the food came out in a timely manner.

This is awesome food with amazing presentation, plating, and creativity. My favorite from the omakase was the toro tartare as there were a few different pastes to eat with the tartare. The foie gras oyster was amazing. I really don't know how to explain the flavors I consumed. Seriously one of the best omakase experiences I have had. Yes it will cost you a bit but Iron Chef Morimoto's omakase is something you must experience. I have also had their lunch specials and other food items and everything has been solid but you just have to experience the omakase. Nothing like it.

So we were sent to the bar downstairs to wait for our table. We ordered the Hydrangea, which was their version of a lychee martini. It was delish. We waited about 10 minutes before we were told that our table was ready and they sent a waiter to bring our drinks upstairs. There were 4 of us and we were seated at the long communal table which we were not happy with. But they had no tables available and we were all starving. They had a lot of specials that night that sounded amazing, and even though I wasn't paying or had to worry about budget, I was too shy to order what I really wanted. Either way, we picked a few appetizers to share: Hamachi with jalapeno sashimi, toro tartare, spicy king crab legs, Morimoto sashimi, and their special of the night Alaskan King Salmon sashimi, and baby snapper sashimi. All those items were amazing, absolutely fresh. Morimoto sashimi wasn't what I expected it to be though. My favorite from those was the Hamachi and jalapeno sashimi.For entrees: Surf & Turf (wagyu filet, Hamachi ribbons, and fingerling potatoes). That was my entrée, and it was pretty good. It was really tiny, and I do expect it from a place like this. The beef was amazing. The Hamachi was definitely overpowered by the ""guacamole"". I wish I ordered something else honestly. Sea bass which my friend ordered was amazing. I thought it was the best entrée anyone ordered. There was a yellowtail rice bowl ordered by another person in our party. Not my kinda thing, nor do I think it's worth it to come here for it. My cousin ordered the halibut which wasn't anything special because the steamed fish I make at home tastes exactly like it. Seriously, I should've ordered sushi.For desserts: warm chocolate cake with blood orange sorbet, monkey bread pudding, and sorbet. All was good. There was a smear of truffle honey on the plate of the warm chocolate cake that was sooo amazing. Monkey bread pudding was pretty good too. Overall a great experience.

742,x6dzit_MdMAYJe1QeE2DYQ,Annie C.,2.0 star rating,"It was over priced and over rated. I've eaten in a lot of restaurants around nyc and beyond. The ""japanese wagyu steak"" was very dissapointing, I've had it at different restaurants and it melts in your mouth. The one I had here taste like regular steak that I can get for $30 , or like USA Kobe beef - at best. The toro sashimi was the same situation , it had veins and wasn't what I was expecting as well for the price. The rest of the fish were okay (same quality you can get at any other Japanese restaurant- it was a cut above the all you can eat places though) . The foie gras and eel had good flavor mixed with the Asian pear, but the foie gras it self tasted like the fatty skin of a salmon fish more than foie gras, it didn't have the texture that it usually carries. Those will argue it is the name and the ambience or the service. I will have to say the service was not exceptional, I've been to places that was more polite and caring. For a $70 tip the waiter can at least to pretend to care when he asked for feed back. Instead of asking me how everything was and ended up not being able to handle the truth and became offended and defensive telling me I don't know what I'm talking about because Japanese wagyu beef and Kobe beef are different, (because I told him the steak tasted like USA Kobe beef at best) and made it seem like I've never had fine dining before. So my suggestion is, go just to try it if it's your thing to just say ""been there done that"" but I would not recommend it and take that $$ elsewhere like BOND STREET where the sushi is fresh  and people are nice and clearly love their job.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I'm also a Japan lover so that made it even more important!FOOD/DRINKS - 5 Stars: Here's a run down of what we ordered:Appetizers:- Eel and avocado roll (yelp.com/biz_photos/t1w4…)- Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura (yelp.com/biz_photos/t1w4…)Entrees:- Seafood Toban Yaki (yelp.com/biz_photos/t1w4…) which had king crab, scallops, shrimp, and lobster.- Surf and Turf with yellowtail sashimi, wagyu, and potatoes (yelp.com/biz_photos/t1w4…) Drinks (yelp.com/biz_photos/t1w4…):- White Lily, this was my favorite drink with yuzu and Calpis! If you're a fan of Calpis, this is definitely worth a try... I ordered two of these!- Hydrangea, which is lychee based.This was so much food, but oh so good. The rock shrimp tempura was an amazing way to start the meal. The eel and avocado roll was absolutely fresh.The surf and turf was a good way to get your meat fix as well as some seafood. The sashimi was mixed with avocado. It was my first time eating it this way, but it was absolutely amazing. The Toban Yaki was so good that all that was left was shell. All the broth and every piece of meat was gone! I don't think anything else needs to be said of how good it was.Unfortunately, we were so stuffed we had to skip out on dessert. =/ATMOSPHERE - 5 Stars: This place is very Hollywood/NYC trendy. That might turn people off, but the setting is truly awesome in here. And even down to the restrooms. I literally had to stare at the stall because of the weird illusion... Ok... I know I'm writing about a stall, but you have to see it for yourself. Hahaha.The ambience was nice and it was very loungy and relaxing. We really enjoyed it.SERVICE - 5 Stars: The service here was impeccable. It was perfect from start to finish. Our server was awesome and did a great job. The evening was seamless and the meal had a nice flow.RECOMMENDATION: I recommend this restaurant to EVERYONE.

With the added bonus of this also being an Iron Chef restaurant, I was really excited to get in this place. We made reservations and were a little late - due to crazy traffic - but there were no other patrons waiting and we were seated immediately -'the host staff were impeccable. The problem started when we didn't get to place our drink order for 10 minutes - the tables in the section were all at very different stages - one group was on dessert - one was in the middle of the entree - so it wasn't like the whole section was sat at once - we finally had to ask the waiter's assistant to get our server - she came over and was curt and kept trying to walk away while we were ordering - it was really odd - and that behavior carried through until we got the check - were weren't even asked if we wanted dessert.The food part though was outstanding - everything we ordered from the 3 rolls and the pork gyoza were beautiful in presentation and fantastic in taste - if only the server part of our experience had been better - I would have probably given this spot 5 stars.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
746,GwoVAarqxWLZR2q3Pdjoyg,Louis P.,5.0 star rating,"If 1,300+ rave reviews are not enough to help make up your mind, here comes another. I rarely say a restaurant is perfect in every aspect, but Morimoto proves itself worthy and then some. First thing i must admit is that i am pretty cautious with my money. I wouldn't say cheap, but when we decided we were going to Morimoto and i saw all the Yelp reviews relating to money, my heart might have skipped a few beats. Yes i was scared to spend half of my biweekly paycheck on dinner but i toughened up and we made the trip. My wife, brother in law and sister in law passed through the automatic sliding doors into the coolest place I've been to in a long time. We were 30 minutes early so our coats were checked and we were directed downstairs to the lounge. Empty liquor bottles lined the walls for some real creative decor and the blue lights made you feel like you were in a futuristic club out in space!.We had a couple of cocktails and were escorted to our table. Comfy padded chairs greeted us along with Carlo, who is one of the managers. He introduced himself, thanked us for coming and offered his services for anything we may need during our meal. He then introduced us to Freddy, who would be our waiter for the evening. Freddy told us about some specials and took our drink order, so here's the fun part:We decided to go with a variety of appetizers instead of the very popular tasting menu because my wife and sister in law are inexperienced with sushi. We really went all out with our order and I'm glad we did! We started with the toro tar tar, one spicy tuna roll, rock tempura shrimp with ranch dressing on the side, beef carpaccio and the best app if all, spicy king crab! I don't even know where to begin with these apps, everything was simply perfect! The girls loved the crab the most and my brother in law and I devoured the toro tar tar.Again, all i can say is that every app was made to the highest quality and our pallets were more than pleased! Both Carlo and Freddy were coming back and forth to check up on us, Carlo was answering questions we had about Morimoto that I'm sure he is asked 50 times a day, while Freddy was telling us a little about the spices used in the dishes (especially the spicy king crab), along with some of the stories he has while traveling through Singapore and China. Needless to say we were being treated real well and also getting a first class experience in fine dining. So next we went to the entrees:My brother in law and I went with the line-caught Halibut while the women went with the 'Angry Chicken.' The Halibut, once again, was the best I've ever tasted. It was as fresh as it could possibly be with a black bean glaze on top and it was all sitting in a fine miso broth with a tang that completed the dish to perfection. For dessert, we went all out again! We had a variety of sweets, including monkey bread accompanied by banana chocolate chip ice cream, chocolate cake filled with cream and topped with fruit and popcorn, cheesecake topped with raspberry sorbet along with yogurt and donuts. Once again, WOW! The clear highlight was the monkey bread, which had a syrupy glaze on the outside and an amazing warm yellow cream inside with mini sliced bananas on top! All the food went down with sweet White Lily and Hydrangea cocktails, which complimented the food perfectly. I guess you can say we went with the meal for beginners, we sampled a bunch of the menu but did not delve too deep into the sushi portion. After all was said and done, our combined bill for 4 was a touch over $320 before tip, which wasn't bad at all considering what i was fearing and the fact that we were chowing down at one of the best restaurants in Manhattan! The staff at Morimoto is simply top notch! Carlo the manager paid attention to every detail and made our experience seamless. Freddy the waiter and Cofield the bus boy were quick, kind and intelligent, you really can't ask for anything more. This was only the second time in my life that i had a perfect fine dining experience, with not one bad thing to report. If you are worried about spending too much money, just go in with the mindset that you are about to treat yourself to something better than you can ever imagine. Highest recommendation i could possibly give for a restaurant.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Definitely go for the bento pre fixe lunch special ($25). You get a salad, a meat (wagyu beef, sea bass, or cod), sushi, tempura, and a panna cotta dessert. We also sampled the unagi sushi ($5/piece) and ootoro sushi ($18/piece) as well as the yuzu, lemon, calpico cocktail called white lily ($14). Excellent service, and yes, the most beautiful restaurant I went to in NYC with great restrooms even lol. I really do appreciate the welcoming, warm, and exquisetly gorgeous decor.

Everyone was pleased with the appetizers.Entrees: Duck, Duck, Duck (okay, Peking Duck anyone?). Sea Bass (nom nom). Braised Black Cod (yummy).

The seafood is fresh and seasoned perfectly with a hint of flavor.Desserts: Warm Chocolate Cake, Apple Turban, Sesame Hazelnut Layer Cake and Tofu ""Hot and Cold.""  The Chocolate Cake takes the prize.In my humble opinion, I didn't have an amazing culinary experience but I would go back perhaps to try the Omakase Dinner in the near future.

We were seated downstairs in the lounge area. It was fairly early so nobody was around us until later 7PM. I tried their Bluebell cocktail to start the night. It is amazing. I think every girl should try this. Don't get the Moritini because it tastes like sashimi. We got the Rock Shrimp Tempura as appetizer to share. They brought out two flavors of tempura. One is slightly saltier and closer to Buffalo Wing style and the other is lightly battered fried shrimp and a plate of Ranch dressing. It is definitely very different from your regular shrimp tempura. We also got the Lobster Fritters and again it is very unique and unlike any other fritters I have had. In fact, it is more like a takoyaki ball but with lobster inside. For sushi, we got the spicy tuna roll and eel and avocado rolls. They are both pretty good but honestly I think for the price, it should have been better. The sushi rice was not particularly outstanding. The sashimi platter we got however was very fresh and top quality. I had to leave the party earlier but the overall experience was pleasant and the service was attentive.

I came here again last week for a friend's birthday and it just reminded me of how much I miss this place! It's located in Chelsea on 10th avenue, near Chelsea Market. It's always been easy for me to get reservations to the restaurant because of how large the restaurant is. It has a wonderful ambiance and great service.Things I order time and again:1) Omakase. Obviously the best thing to get especially for first-timers. It will include their signature toro tartare.2) Toro tartare. A must have every time. It's toro tuna tartare flattened in a rectangular plate served with different condiments such as wasabi, green onions, creme fraiche, something that taste like hoisin sauce, and some kind of crunchy crumbs. It's one of the best things I ever ate.3) Seabass. On the healthier lighter side. Sooo fresh and delish.4) Sushi / Oyster. All of their fish is prepared so fresh. The rice they cook is perfection...really makes all the difference...you get a bit of sweetness and vinegar.5) Rock Shrimp appetizer....great to share.6) Their dessert...can't go wrong with anything, but the Green Tea mille crepe cake with rocher ice cream was soooo amazing!!!7) Cocktails - lychee martini....yum.I've always had great service here as expected, which makes this place an easy pick if I'm around the area.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

With all the hype surrounding this place, I expected so much more. Came here for the restaurant week special, so maybe they put less effort Into these than regular priced dishes?? Either way, I was disappointed. The miso black cod, a supposed staple at morimoto, was cold by the time it reached me and extremely bland. The skin was soggy, which is always a turn off for fish. I tried a bit of my friend's Kobe beef and it was salty to the point where you couldn't really taste the beef. We also ordered some salmon avocado rolls, and they were over-loaded with rice, with very lack luster fish.

The whopping total was ~$285 without a tip added.  Again, this place is not for the following types of people:1) the faint of heart2) the animalistic eater3) the recession wallet 4) the ignorant of the meaning of ""Iron Chef"" And 5) the ""presentation doesn't mean anything to me""Come to experience something rare, elegant, and so tasteful, you'll want to take cooking classes.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

He was my idol, and I always cheer him on during the battles. But man, this is the 2nd time he disappoints me.First time was at the Lucky Rice festival in NYC earlier this year. He personally made some lobster on a spoon dish. it was waaay too salty and you can't even taste the lobster at all. What the hell happened to the whole preserving the true ingredient taste that Iron Chefs so highly strives for?And now here at his restaurant. Since we weren't hungry, we only ordered the appetizers. Frankly, the appetizers sounded so much better than the dinner menu.The Tuna Pizza yelp.com/biz_photos/t1w4… It's good, but it's not amazing in any way. Taste kinda like tuna salad you get anywhere else, with mayo.Tuna Tartare yelp.com/biz_photos/t1w4… the whole reason why we were here in the first place. Supposed to be the best thing ever in the restaurant. But did they really use toro? the tuna is not fatty or concentrated in the deep, rich tuna flavor, it's bland! This is probably the least tasty toro I've ever had, and I'm comparing it to places in Miami.Oyster Foie Gras yelp.com/biz_photos/t1w4…I can't taste the oyster, I can't taste the foie gras, I can't taste the uni. I CAN taste the hoisin sauce though, lots and lots of salty hoisin sauce. not sure what the red fruit is in the center, but it's the best tasting thing in the whole dish.Wagyu Beef Carpaccio yelp.com/biz_photos/t1w4… This is actually tasty. nice mixture of seasoning and sesame oil. But I've had real wagyu beef before, and this is not even close. it's too tough to be wagyu and not enough flavor.

769,HC_ro2nM0vMGRahUpSF89g,Jason O.,1.0 star rating,"If I could rate this restaurant zero stars I would based for the awful service on my engagement night. I had called a week in advance to make sure I could get a reservation with Morimoto due to my fiance and I having a great date there in the very beginning of our relationship. The person who answered my call and took the reservation said it would be no problem for a 7:15pm reservation at a specific set of tables. He also said he would let the staff know it was a special night for the engagement. Fast forward to 6/30 when we arrive and our table was not held. We were put in another section and I asked to speak to a Manager, Min, about what happened given I called in advance and was promised. I understand mistakes are made and I'm usually laid back but the indifferent attitude Min showed was unacceptable and unprofessional. She tried to explain that they don't honor reservations because ""It's first come first serve"" which made no sense at all, why take reservations by phone or online? Then she offered my fiance and I free dessert. Free dessert? Really? It's one of the most important night's in my life to date and I wanted the night to be special (it was thankfully) so offering me free sweets isn't going to make things right. It was like she was reading off a script in this monotone voice and did not appear to care at all. She did nothing to resolve the issue in a professional manner.  A more appropriate response would have been to ask us to wait at the bar, perhaps comp a free drink while they sorted out the table seating and then apologize for messing up a special night. Luckily we went straight to Fatty Crab which is our favorite date spot and had a blast, it actually was better than going to a stuffy restaurant like Morimoto versus a small intimate place where our awesome server Colin was genuinely happy for us, he even hugged us goodbye!     Morimoto does have decent food but like other reviewers mention, it is overpriced and caters to the tourist crowds. I will never go back based on the staff and most notably the manager Min, who is either useless or seriously does not care about correcting a mistake the restaurant staff made. Completely unacceptable for a restaurant that charges as much as they do and touts famous chefs, etc...

I don't mind spending that kind of money on a great dining experience but Morimoto fell short in my eyes.The service was okay at best. We got placed at a table away from the main dining area near the kitchen and bathrooms - not exactly ideal. Our server was friendly enough but overly casual and not super attentive (waited too long for more drinks or to have our plates cleared, etc...).We both got the omakase (chef's choice - I believe it was $125/pp) and there were some big hits and definite misses:Really good: Toto Tartare: This was by far my favorite course. Really delicious toro along w/ 5 different accompaniments (wasabi, caviar, etc...) . We found ourselves craving it for days after.Sashimi course - I believe it was yellow tail with a ponzu/soy sauce. Could have eaten a few more plates of that.The dessert - Mango pudding w/ passion fruit sorbet and yogurt power. Nice light and inventive way to end the meal.Sushi course: 5 different types of fish - all very fresh.Meh: The anchovies fondue -   fondue was very, very salty. It came with an assortment of things to dip into it (soshito pepper, raw red pepper, cauliflower, mortadella, etc...). It was a fun idea but the saltiness of the fondue almost killed it for me. Kumamoto oyster with foie gras, uni and terriyaki sauce - I LOVE oysters, foie gras and uni. I was super excited when this came out. The terriyaki sauce was just way too overpowering. Maybe less sauce or a different sauce and I would have loved it. As it was, it was alright but a major letdown. Waygu beef & lobster: Meh. Meat was just okay - I was very underwhelmed, my lobster was undercooked and I wasn't a fan of the spices used.Would I go back? Probably not.

They are either incredibility stuck up, or incredibly aloof. Either way, they do a disservice to their coworkers. The bartenders are friendly, the bus stuff is as well, and our waiter was almost as excited about our visit as we were.Our waiter actually made everything feel a lot less stuffy. He took his time recommending dishes for us and kept checking up on us genuinely caring if we were enjoying everything. My experience at other fancy-shamcy places like this have been that the servers assume everything is perfect, which as we all know isn't always the case.So the food was delicious, creative, but alas, not very memorable. Granted I was there a week ago and took my time to get around writing this review, but I expected myself to remember the flavors in a dish or two. I don't. But that doesn't mean it wasn't worth it. It just means it's delicious fancy food that's worth trying once, for the sake of trying it.  The coolest part of it all though, I embarrassingly must admit, was the toilets.

I have to say this is one of my all time favorite restaurants and I will make sure to dine here again whenever I'm in town. The food was delicious, creative and beautifully presented. Service was outstanding with table side presentations and special attention to my food allergies. The restaurant exterior is very simple and you may even miss it from the street, however inside the decor is very well designed, sleek and modern as you can see from the photos.  You will even have to make a trip to the restroom downstairs. Worth taking a look.  Quite impressive.  I have always admired Chef Morimoto from watching Iron Chef and it was on the top of our list of places we wanted to try. It was a unique dining experience that exceeded my expectations. Toro Tartare is a beautiful and delicious appetizer you have to try and once you've had wagyu on your bibimbap nothing else compares! For the grand finale, dessert, with compliments from the chef. It was a show in itself. Fiery chocolate tart. Yes that's real fire which melts the chocolate. They also gave me the most delicious sorbet trio with such unique and original flavors like strawberry red wine, green tea, and blood orange meringue.  Tomo Arigato Chef Morimoto and staff for helping us celebrate my daughter's birthday.

I heard decent reviews of this place and the whole Iron Chef thing just kind of makes people think this place is good. Well, let me tell you, this place is ridiculously amazing. Even the bathroom is awesome! The restaurant is very modern. Sliding doors, sleek furniture, amazing bar and just an overall clean and sleek look and feel. That alone already started my experience and the food really just sent me over the edge. I am in LOVE with this place and it is seriously worth the splurge. We started with the tofu and the spicy king crab legs. I am not a fan of tofu at all, but this tofu was amazing. The tofu dish was a show: it started with a bowl of liquid and they add some concoction to it and ten minutes later, it became tofu. They top it with mushroom soup and you can add rice crackers to it. When I say I hate tofu, I mean it, but I could eat this for days! The king crab leg was fish roe and spicy mayo mixed together and topped on juicy crab legs. This dish was pricey, but so worth it. I dreamt about it last night it was so good. On to the main dish, I had the sea bass which was a very good sized portion and so juicy and flavorful. I love fish and I love aquagrill, but Morimoto knows how to cook his fish. When I say flavorful, I mean it. Every bite is bursting with all the tastes from the sauce and it really is a party for your mouth. I will say, the table next to us ordered the steak and I was drooling. I really had to control myself from asking them for a piece. For a seafood restaurant, they know how to cook a steak. We finished our meal with the flourless chocolate cake and the red bean doughnuts. The cake was so rich and fudgy and is seriously a chocolate lovers dream. The doughnuts were good, but I liked the frozen yogurt that it came with much more. Of the two desserts, I'd go with the chocolate cake. Our server was a little slow and essentially forgot about us. While I didn't mind the 3 hours meal, it would have been a lot less if he actually paid attention. Minus 1 star for that, but food wise this is a 5 star restaurant. They also do make sure that their customers are happy. The table next to us had their steak cooked wrong and not only did they recook it, the manager came over to apologize and they comped the steak and threw in dessert and a glass of wine. Not a big deal for Morimoto, but they do value their customers happiness. All in all, I would definitely come back here.

Last time I went, the white fish carpaccio was no longer on the appetizer menu but was part of the tasting menu in a smaller portion, which I think is a mistake, cuz it was great in the larger portion. The sushi is also great but once in a while it feels like they need to let the sushi rice warm up to room temperature instead of having it be too cold and stiff, that's my occasional gripe. The steak here is surprisingly amazing! Better than at some steakhouses, and this is a sushi spot so kudos to them.

I came here for NYE's last year with my fiance and it was the best sushi experience I've ever had!  We didn't even have reservations, we just walked in at 11, and were planning to sit at the bar but the hosts found us a terrific seat and were so accomodating!   For NYE, they handed out party hats and beads and little horns for the midnight toast. We weren't planning to go out that night at all but this made our NYE experience so worth it!Starting with food. Their food is incredible. The Iron Chef lives up to his name. Their miso cod is better than Nobu - yes I said it!  Their fish is so fresh, so beautiful, so rich and so delicious! We had the classics: toro tartar, crispy rock shrimp, miso cod, salmon, shrimp tempura roll and some uni sushi. I just knew this was a knockout by how delicious and soft the uni was, and how light and buttery the fishes were. I almost didn't want to list everything because now I'm hungry for it again!  We had a bottle of champagne so I didn't get to try drinks but I saw other people order them and they looked amazing.Ambiance, in one word, is dreamy but modern... the decor is a visual stunner. Morimoto is made to impress and wow. It is clean lines, sparking decor with subtle edgy flourishes.  The pulsating, shimmering blue wall is the focal point for sure. Location wise, it's in the heart of Meatpacking, so be prepared for the Real Housewives crowd.  This is definitely a trendy, be seen type of place, but I also found it so unique and genuinely fun. Service is top notch. Very attentive, polite and knowledgeable about the menu.  Able to give great recommendations, suggest substitutes and explain anything we didn't know. It was NYE's at 12pm, but he was fun and upbeat. We bought him a glass of champagne to toast with us because he was so cool.  I've been to places with great service but everything has been so stilted and formal and rigid. I love places that are sexy and chic but still relaxed - the point is to eat and laugh..stylishly of course.Price - yes it is pricey, but no more so than many other Manhattan hotspots. We spent about $250 I think for 2, with a bottle of champagne. But we also ate a lot. If you come here for a special occasion, it will be worth it. And I saved the best for last..... the toilets. Yes, perhaps the ultimate luxury in Morimoto is when you descend their transparent curving staircase and find yourself in an ultra modern bathroom... and sit your bum on top of state of the art Japanese toilets with heated seats, and a full remote control with that yields you options that you ever imaged existed for a toilet.  I'll leave it at that.  I giggled like a child for 5 minutes straight and upon exiting the toilets, it was apparent I wasn't the only 5 year old there:PMorimoto is a 5 star A to Z establishment, fulfilling all your needs and desires.

Next I got the spicy tuna rolls and he got the shrimp tempura rolls. Both equally delicious. I like that they don't serve low sodium soy sauce either. For entree, we enjoyed the surf and turf, a serving of Wagyu filet seared to perfection accompanied by hamachi ribbons in ""guacamole"" and some herbed potatoes.

It's covered in clear glass bottles and back lit.  It sets the tone for an incredible meal.The other side of the restaurant has 2 or 3 tables grouped together and sectioned off by glass partition.  The glass isn't completely clear.  And it makes it so that you're surrounded by people, but there's enough of a barrier that you can speak softly and be heard by those at your table.There was also a rather large sushi bar in the back of the restaurant. And a bar/lounge on the lower level.The food is to die for! If you go, don't skip the Spicy King Crab Appetizer.

It is truly worthy of Iron Chef Morimoto.......who I actually met during the entree course.Service is unmatched with their attention to detail and client relations. I say client relations because that's what you feel like. You're not some customer that stopped by to grab a quick bite, you are there so that the staff can invest their time and effort into making your experience at this restaurant the best it can be. The hostess not only showed us to our seats but took the time to get to know us before our waiter even came. Then the manager came to introduce himself to us and asked if he could accommodate us even more than we were already. I didn't even try a single bite of food yet and I was already amazed at this place.I decided not to go with omakase menu so that I could choose for myself. So here are the things I chose to eat.I started off with some sushi selections. There are so many but I chose my favorites. Soft Shell Crab Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, and Squid Sashimi. The crab tasted fresh and the outside was not overly fried or oily. The roll was rolled tightly enough so that nothing was falling out, but loose enough so that you could neatly see all the ingredients. The Spicy Tuna was savory and not overly spicy, the fish was chopped into small chunks instead of the usual paste that most sushi places do. The texture of the small chunks really made this roll very palatable as a starter. The squid was fresh and had no signs of being left on the counter or overly stored in the fridge. Next was the tempura calamari salad. When it came out I thought I had they had brought me the wrong dish because it was piled high with succulent calamari. They must have tenderized the calamari before frying it because there wasn't any hint of chewiness or being overcooked. You didn't look at the salad and think ""I wish there was more calamari"", no, you looked at it and said ""damn! that's a lot of a calamari!The Morimoto Sashimi was my favorite. It's a layered wall of hamachi, eel, seared toro and lean tuna. Each section of the wall is topped with a small morsel of something special that enhances the already amazing flavors from the sashimi. If that wasn't amazing enough, you're given 5 pipettes of sauce to mix and match with the sashimi. Fun to eat, great to eat, even better to savor. I ordered the Seafood Tobanyaki, which is a seafood stew. It has lobster, scallops, king crab, mussels.... so divine. The broth is subtle enough so that every piece of seafood flavor shines. Each piece was also cooked to perfection, nothing was overcooked or chewy and they were cleaned and prepared properly.We also had the surf and turf entree. Kobe Beef with Hamachi, served tableside... amazing. The beef was perfectly seared and had great texture. The hamachi was fresh and tasted great with the herbed potatoes.Dessert comprised of Concord Grape Sorbet, Lychee Sorbet, and Green Apple Sorbet.... I wish they opened up a Morimoto's Sorbet Shop. I could eat an entire tub of each. As we were paying, the manager made sure to greet us and make sure the meal went well. Nothing could have made it better. Especially when we got to meet Morimoto himself. Eating at Morimoto's is like a wedding, you're most likely only going to be able to go there once, so might as well go big or go home. Be prepared to spend and you'll never regret what you get for a meal. Some people look at their wedding photos and go ""Awwww..."", I look at my photos from this restaurant and go ""yum. I gotta go back there again"".",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

It is important to mention that this review is based ONLY on the Omakase experience. I had the pleasure of dining at Morimoto from the day they opened and the days when Chef Morimoto was still present most of the time at his restaurant. In fact our first experience was the Omakase and Chef Morimoto attended to us personally (even helped my girlfriend remove her shoes as part of the Omakase ritual). I made the appointment about 30 days prior to our visit and expected to get the usual email confirmation and Omakase form. 2 weeks passed and still no confirmation, so i called again to reconfirm, No reservation was found. No big deal, made a new reservation and within 15 min got my confirmation and Omakase form, which is nothing more than a credit card authorization form. We opted for the $200 pp Omakase and send the cc information per fax as requested. 1 week prior to our dinner reservation i got a call from the restaurant wanting to reconfirm, which i did. 2 days later i got another call from the same guy (johnny) wanting to reconfirm. SO I DID AGAIN. On the day of our reservation (5 hours prior to our reservation) i get another call, from guess who... Johnny, wanting to reconfirm the reservation. At this point i was getting annoyed and reconfirmed yet again, but when he asked me for the Omakase form I had it and told him to go to his fax machine where he would find the form. Sure enough, after now talking to the manager, (Johnny couldn't take the heat) they found the fax, EUREKA!We get to the restaurant and decided to go downstairs to the bar first and have their amazing white Lilly cocktail but checked in at the front and saw johnny, who was not over excited to hear my name on the reservation. We had our drink then were taken to the Omakase table. The whole section was empty but we were sat right by the entrance to the kitchen (what a surprise). It is obvious Johnny had his revenge well planned out..... Now to the Omakase experience, its NOT WORTH IT at all. It used to be a special experience to get the Omakase and i emphasis used to be. We ended up spending a good amount of money on the Omakase and Bottle of Sake but the service and experience was totally not worth it. The food served that evening was at best OK and the service was anything but special or memorable. To the manager and to johnny, you guys should do a better job to honor and protect what Chef Morimoto created. My recommendation: you are much better off sitting at the regular tables and order from the menu. Morimotos food is usually really good and you seldom go wrong.

The rock shrimp appetizer is just an explosion of flavor, and I was a big fan of the tuna ""pizza"" (with olives, anchovy aïoli, and jalapeño) to start. Had a sushi plate to share for 2, and the fish was very well cut. Only slight complaint is that the sushi always contains a bit of wasabi between the fish and the rice, so if you're not careful the wasabi can be dangerous. The lychee cocktail was delightful - aromatic and not too sweet, and not overwhelmingly strong with the alcohol.

The lobster tempura maki roll they had on special was tasty, but the cilantro was a little overpowering.For entrees, the Ishi Yaki 'Buri Bop' was good, but again not extraordinary. They do prepare it in front of you, which is kind of cool, but they are literally just searing pieces of tuna sashimi in front of you. Eh. If I came back, I probably would not order this again.

It took us about an hour to get drinks, and then our food started coming out all wrong and in reverse order, etc etc. We felt ignored and were really disappointed. Anyway, my point is, I brought this to the attention of Tammie, the manager, and she did a fantastic job and salvaged our experience. She made sure we got everything we need, comped our meal entirely, and brought out some extra desert stuff complete with candles when she heard it was my girlfriend's birthday. A lesser restaurant would've just given free desert/drinks and apologized, but they really do hold to a high standard at Morimoto.

They have two great problems: their menu and service.This, in entirety, is how the menu describes the sushi and sashimi combinations they offer:Chef's sushi combination-50/95/[price 3]/[price 4]Chef's sashimi combination-[four different prices]On a separate page, again without any further explanation:Seasonal chef's sushi combination-[price]Seasonal chef's sashimi combination-[another price]Perhaps focussing on sushi for our main course wasn't the best decision (though the sushi choices did take up a large part of the menu). We asked our waiter about the combinations, assuming that without a wordy menu, we'd have to rely on him to find out what to expect. But he couldn't explain the combinations to us accurately in several attempts. We were under the impression after his first explanation that we could combine our favorites from the maki and nigiri list, with different price points allowing more selection. Later we found out there's no choice and no ready estimate of the quantity to expect from the differently priced options. The most helpful comment the waiter could make was that the seasonal selection was more ""about quality"" whereas the chef's selections were ""about quantity.""We ended up ordering sushi a la carte to avoid further confusion. We ordered both maki and nigiri.When we ordered from the nigiri list, the waiter noted our order and confirmed ""two of each?"" We agreed two of each would be sufficient as we wanted variety. Later when our check arrived we realized the menu listed the nigiri per piece, and we were paying $10-12 apiece. In itself, that would hardly bother us-if only the menu was less at fault and not so vague about quantity. And if only the nigiri was exceptional in any way (the rice fell apart too soon for what we were paying.) I don't fault the waiter here-it was our choice not to ask further questions.A few other subtle incidents shape my current opinion: we were offered a choice between seats at the traditional live cooking bar and a proper table. We went for the first option. Since we were early, both legs of the L-shaped bar were mostly unoccupied. We were led to seats on the shorter leg of the bar just beside the point where it bent. The seats looked just fine at first, but we realized after being seated that our view was blocked by the smooth, curved wood which formed the corner of the bar instead of glass. Obviously we could have asked for different seats or just moved-but we didn't know then we were in a cafe.At another point during our meal, I pointed out to our waiter that a fly had somehow shown up in my third, freshly poured glass of sake (I was drinking from a carafe.) I just asked for a fresh glass. I didn't explicitly convey my suspicion that the fly came straight from the carafe. It would've been nice for him to inquire and perhaps bring me back a filled glass instead of an empty one.A smaller and simpler case in point: as we got our coats back, the person who handed them back had an expression on her face that conveyed grave disapproval. I'm not sure whether she was disappointed with the restaurant as well, or the way her day started, or our appearance. She handed both our coats back in a heap to one of us. I do realize I'm being very critical, but it just wasn't indicative of good service, nor the happiest way to greet customers on their way out. After all, we expressed none of our own disappointment to the staff, and did leave a reasonable tip.I hope Morimoto can improve on its menu and service if it hopes to cater to the dining market.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

On this particular visit, my friends and I decided to try Morimoto, which, for sushi and Asian cuisine lovers, as well as iron chef America fans, is a must. The first thing you notice when walking in is just how big this restaurant is. It's quite impressive that they can not only fill the place up, but also bang out such a high standard of food! The service is excellent and everyone from the hostess, to the waiter, to the servers live up the high standard previously mentioned! As usual, I wanted to try everything on the menu, but had to settle for 1 appetizer, 1sushi course, a main and a dessert! I started with some nice 'ginjo' sake, served chilled, the way it's supposed to be!For sushi, I went with 2 sashimi: first was the octopus followed by a special striped jack tuna! Octopus was nothing special, but that tuna might've been the best piece of fish I've ever eaten! I followed that with the seared scallops in XO sauce, topped with crispy onions and bok choy! The scallops were cooked to perfection and the sauce was out of this world... I actually stole my friend's spoon just to make sure I finished the last bit of broth from my plate!For the main course, I shared a 20 ounce wagyu beef rib eye. I had never tried wagyu beef. Although it was just a little tougher than I expected, it was still melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The sear and temperature on it were also perfect. For dessert, I also shared their monki-banana bread. I usually avoid ordering dessert at restaurants, but I would go back to morimoto just for the banana bread! It was THAT good!I'm happy this place was able to live up the the expectations and even surpass them in some instances.

(Honestly, we were so bogged down with work lately, we didn't think to make reservations anywhere until the week before... And these days, reservations in nyc need to be made exactly one month before, 28 days before... It's really become such a hassle!) I was just wary of going to go to  Morimoto since I haven't been eating any sashimi or sushi after suffering terribly from food poisoning from bad sushi a couple years ago in Atlantis. And, that coupled with seeing parasites at work... That people got from eating sushi.... So without knowing what I should get and just half excited about the meal, we arrived at the restaurant. But all I kept seeing on my last minute yelp reviews was Omakase... The host was extremely friendly and our head waitress was sweet. However, the table we were sitting at was not even a foot away from the table next to us. We were uncomfortable and we can sense that the other party was quite uncomfortable too since we can hear everything any one person said. Then, the first food server of the Omakase just threw us off. He brought out the first dish and my husband and I were just really impressed by the presentation and again, we could barely hear him since the table next to us was talking about the lady's lobster dish... I assume that the server greeted us but since we didn't respond, he very rudely says, ""I'm doing fine! Thanks for asking!"" And storms off... My husband, myself and the couple next to us all sat there with our mouths open at his obnoxious behavior. But, that was really easily forgotten since the rest of the service was really nice and the omakase was truly wonderful. Thank you, fellow helpers! I really have nothing bad to say about it, I really want to go have it again. We'll probably go again sometime for the king crab and maybe the Omakase again.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Despite the early arrival, the service was great; our server was extremely helpful with regards to choosing dishes and drinks. We started with some whitefish carpaccio and rock shrimp tempura, both of which were pretty good. For our main dishes, we had the ishi yaki buri bop, which was my favorite dish of the meal. The fried rice went really well with the yellowtail, which was very fresh. We also had the duck, duck, duck, which was pretty good, along with some uni and tori roll. In general, the food was fairly fresh and tasty, but only the yellowtail bibimbap was something that really stood out to me. For dessert, we had the 5-year aged sake (tastes more like whiskey than sake) and the warm chocolate cake with blood orange sorbet and truffle honey. The blood orange sorbet was nice, but I found the cake to be a bit dry and the truffle honey pairing a bit puzzling.The ambiance is pretty swanky, and it's probably a cool place to bring people from out of town for a good meal with great service.

For example, we never hear of the rare salmon (oh-torro?) and Japanese Beef that were delicasies. Sorry I dont remember the exact names. You can blame the cocktails for that.We started off with a few sushi rolls - spicy salmon and eel avocado roll. We followed that with the Crispy Shrimp Tempura. Our Entrees were the Duck Breast and the Austrailian Waygu Filet. Both were amazing. Last but not least, we enjoyed the Chocolate Cake with Caramel Popcorn and Coconut Sorbet. Ive been to a lot of GOOD restaurants across the country, but its safe to say that this is easily one of the BEST restaurants period. Service was stellar, food was out of this world.

I was disappointed but we had waited a while so clearly there was no other table. In the area we sat had maybe 4 tables include ours, two of the groups looked like tourists group, so didn't dress like I thought we supposed to. Maybe female hostess put us that table because when I talked to her, I didn't understand some of the things she said? She didn't like foreigners?I don't know, but was sad that I didn't really enjoy atmosphere. My husband told male hostess that this was for our anniversary dinner and we checked coats, so they saw how we dressed. If I was the hostess, I would never give that table for anniversary dinner couple.In addition, the whole area was so cold!!! Anyway, all food we ordered was delicious. We had beef carpaccio and crispy shrimp for appetizer. My husband got grilled chicken, I had duck for main. We shared tiramisu for dessert. My favourite was beef carpaccio, amazing!!! For drink, my husband had beer. I had cocktail Hydrangea and it was very tasty.Overall, delicious food and drink, but we didn't enjoy atomosphere at all for my anniversary date night.Maybe I should've let my husband make reservation or talked hostes then she could give us better table...?  We don't like complain , so we said nothing.

We arrived exactly on time for our reservation, yet we had to wait 15 minutes while others came in and were seated immediately. Nobody explained why or spoke to us about it, so we were a little confused. I was feeling a little reluctant and we hadn't even sat down yet.COCKTAILS ($14 each): My husband ordered the Morimotini (wasabi infused vodka, sake, cucumbers) and it was very delicious. I ordered the Camellia but I am pretty sure they gave me the wrong drink - it supposedly had cranberry, elderflower and sake, but when it came out, it was BRIGHT red (like Kool-Aid) and I could not taste any of those ingredients. It actually tasted exactly like Hawaiian punch.  I sent it back, the manager came over to help me choose another drink, and the Camellia was never added to the bill. My second drink was much better.MEAL: We went with the 7-course Omakase tasting menu. It was quite tasty, although the portions were TINY and for the price ($125) I would have expected a little more. We have done tasting menus at many high-end restaurants, including Per Se, and I think the Morimoto Omakase would have been better priced at $90 or $100 a person. Granted, it did include wagyue beef, lobster, sushi and foie gras, but... definitely not worth $125. Tip not included, unlike other restaurants' tasting menus. Seating was a little weird (bench on one side and chairs on the other) because you are SUPER close to other couples. I heard the whole conversation of the couple next to me. I'd want something a little more cozy instead of being crammed in like sardines. Overall, nice night. A little more money than I think it was worth, but good food.

We also ordered the Toro Tartare which was really lovely taste-wise although extremely pricy. It was a little strange to have with the selection of guac, sour cream, soy sauce, etc. For dessert my friends got me a matcha tiramisu was lovely, the texture of the ice cream was divine combined with the elements of a tiramisu dessert. We also ordered the tofu cheesecake to try something new. I can definitely vouch for all of my friends when we all agreed that it was a strange experience.

I took my girlfriend there for her birthday hoping she go insane considering she is a die hard Japanese food fan. When we first stepped in the first thing we noticed was the decorum: This place is beautiful and well put together with subtle nuances that really contribute to the overall outstanding ambiance of the restaurant. Once we're seated we were greeted by our waiter who was a nice lady but I felt kept pressuring us to buy the more expensive items on the menu. We ultimately went with two Surf and Turf's for main courses, spicy salmon roll, spicy tuna roll, and a California roll, and for an appetizer the Morimoto sashimi. The first thing to land in front of us was disappointment: 6 pieces of sashimi for $28. This was so egregiously overpriced the succeeding day I was expecting to see gold when I used the bathroom. But hey don't get me wrong they were really good and very well presented but for the price, I feel as if I could've gotten a better bang for my buck. Then our sushi and entrées came. Now for all those who are planning to go there the surf and turf is a dish composed of herbed potatoes and a skirt steak of the infamous wagyu beef. Wagyu is supposed to be this otherworldly experience that will transform your taste buds to a new dimension that is only composed of rainbows and happiness. These expectations, however, did not come to fruition. Instead I was served a medium-rear piece of flavorless meat that was not in the slightest bit juicy or tender. I have the hinting suspicion that they didn't even season the damn thing. I have enjoyed better pieces of meat from longhorn steakhouse than this place. It was a lackluster dish with albeit really good potatoes. Now on to the sushi! Being die hard sushi addicts, my girlfriend and I have made it our life goal to try every sushi joint in NYC. So needless to say we have at least some experience with sushi. The sushi at this place was pretty good but not mind blowing. I have had better and more flavorful sushi than this place. But it was pretty good, the salmon was smooth and tuna fatty with the California roll being decent as well.

For God sakes, you pay a pretty high amount for below average quality sushi by the piece. If you are here for the sushi alone, you can easily find better in the city. Even if you are a roll person (Crunchy, California, Eel avocado, etc), there is definitely much better quality rolls a block away. For their entrees, I haven't had anything that has any sort of WOW factor to it. This is a definite trendy, pretty and place to be seen kind of restaurant, but should not be a place for major foodies. And I totally cringe my teeth when I think of value of the sushi (I don't even cringe this much over $500/person Masa). Now for the good and reason why I don't give this place two stars - It really is an awesome place to hang with friends and have drinks. I've been here many many times over my last 3 years here in New York and many of these times, some members of my party don't eat at all and instead opt for drinks. We spend time enjoying the restaurant's incredible drink selection and dessert. Service is OK - hit or miss. Sushi for the most part is way overpriced and below average quality. But you are in a pretty place with a cool vibe. Would recommend if you are about to go out nearby or want a cool vibe with great drinks. Would not recommend if you are looking for a great sushi spot in the city.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
871,XYhe2a1QBF_hXLKvhBLPuw,Tony T.,3.0 star rating,"Had a few appetizers and entrees along with sushi this time. The beef carpaccio had sesame & hot oil. The beef a little overcooked but tasty. The oyster foie gras had beautiful plating and tasted decadent. The foie gras was seared perfectly, and the oyster warm but not fully cooked. The uni that came with it was not cooked and very fresh. If I could get only one appetizer at Morimoto it would be the spicy king crab, which has sweet crabmeat and spicy sauce on top.For sushi we got eel, which was smoked and well cooked. The ikura was salty & briny. The specials were sockeye salmon, white eel, and red snapper. The sockeye salmon was lean and the white eel was a little bony and tasted like eel but different than the regular smoked eel that I am used to. The tai (red snapper) was a little tougher than I thought it would be but it was still a very tasty white fish. We got some rolls and the softshell crab roll had perfectly cooked crab but the asparagus was not a necessary addition to the roll. The spicy tuna roll  was good but there was nothing special about it. The salmon skin roll had crunchy skin but I would have liked more skin. The otoro was perfect and it melted in my mouth. This is always my favorite pieceof sushi/sashimi.For the entrees we tried wagyu beef bibimbap. The beef was fatty and melted in my mouth similar to the otoro. The rice was good but a few more vegetables would be nice in the dish. The duck duck duck had three different preparations of duck. Each piece of duck had crunchy skin, and all three sauces served with the duck were good. There was no gamey taste at all to the duck. They tried to do a take on Peking duck but bread was too soggy to make it successful.Overall this is an impressive place to bring out of town guests and the fish is always fresh.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

They were pretty reasonable for that type of restaurant. Huge plus :)as for the food, It was good. I have the cod with the black edamame. I wouldn't say it was AMAZING, but It was good. maybe I didn't order the right thing? I am asian and use to a lot of the flavors he uses in his food, it could also be that.I had an orange martini (forgot the name)..but I didn't like it.I would visit here again tho, its one of the places I would go back to several times to try everything on the menu.Don't get me wrong though, although the food was good.

By no means was this Morimoto bad, but for the high prices here I expected more.Food:Fresh ingredients and dishes are presented nicely in general. Omakase is available, although we opted for the regular menu this time. Highlights included the Morimoto sashimi, and the ishi yuri buri bop which is prepared tableside in a hot stone bowl. All the dishes we ordered were certainly good, The desserts also failed to meet my expectations; the menu had a high proportion of Western desserts. Our waiter informed us of a ""monkey bread"" dessert special which I opted for; it ended up being overly sweet and way too large for a dessert portion.Service:For a restaurant of this caliber, I felt that Morimoto fell short. Service just wasn't attentive enough, and on several occasions we had to ask for refills of water/tea, or for finished plates to be cleared. Our waiter also felt it necessary to continually come to our table to ask how everything was after each dish was presented - not a huge deal, but by the time we had finished with appetizers and gotten to the main dishes, it seemed a bit overbearing. The sushi bar left out a bit of our sashimi order, but when we pointed out the error to our waiter they promptly brought out what was missing. Setting/ambience:The restaurant is decorated in a trendy and somewhat minimalistic way; dim colored lighting, a folded-cloth-style ceiling, and Japanese toilets all make for a cool vibe. Unfortunately, the section we were seated in was fairly cramped, understandably so since it was a Saturday night. Overall, although I enjoyed the food, the subpar service and lack of anything truly memorable means I most likely will not be returning here.

We ordered the burger and the black cod, which came with some sides of miso soup, salad and pickled vegetables which were all pretty standard tasting. The cod was cooked very well, very moist, and the sauce on it was delicious. We also got some maki rolls, which were very good as well, the fish was super fresh and high quality, and even the wasabi was good. We got both of the desserts offered, profiteroles and a coffee sort of custard with ice cream. The custard was a pretty sizable portion and definitely curbed any sugar craving I had beforehand!

The wait staff was amazing, very courteous and knowledgeable.The specialty drinks were refreshing and strong as well as rather tasty. The only problem is that took some time to get to the table, as did the subsequent drinks. The food was simply fantastic. They do have a tasting menu for a very reasonable $132, but we ordered off the menu as some of our party was on a diet and they recommend everyone at the table get the chef's menu. The tuna tartar appetizer was amazing, the rock shrimp were pretty good, but they were just shrimp. The bone marrow appetizer was very tasty.As for the entrees, I got the duck duck duck which was very satisfying, basically roast duck, duck confit and duck egg,I love duck eggs. The sushi there was out of this world, and the fish dishes were scrumptious. You can't go wrong ordering anything here, But what else would you expect from Iron Chef Japanese!

883,kXCqZwnoDS8ekCOLIfWgig,Oshun A.,5.0 star rating,"My fiance & I have our subjectively high standards for food, as I am a seasoned cook and he is a health enthusiast. We're also very selective when it comes to what we drop a good bit of money on. Morimotos NYC was an experience I won't forget.We decided to introduce ourselves to his cooking style by ordering the eight course Morimoto Omakase, served alongside some very good sakes and mineral water. This was meant to be a tasting menu & an example of the best the restaurant has to offer.First off, please understand this is not an ""Asian Restaurant"". It's a fusion restaurant. Although Morimoto was trained in sushi and traditional Kaiseki cuisine, he has been influenced by Western dishes in the U.S., and has let this influence his creations. So if you're looking for something that will satisfy a strict Asian palette, this probably isn't going to be your cup of tea. We started out with a very delicate, conservative portion of Otoro Tartare. The Otoro (belly of the bluefin tuna, containing enough fat to melt in your mouth) came with several miniature condiment samples, including crème fraîche, nori paste, chives, wasabi, rice crackers and avacado paste. It indeed melted in my mouth and left me ready for more. The Fluke Sashimi deserves its own review..This was the most wonderfully cut and seasoned sashimi I've ever had, and I believe I had an orgasm in my mouth. The essence of this is so complex, and the flavors blend together like magic. Afterwards came my seared Kampache Sashimi Salad, which is a mild kampachi fish over microgreens with a light apple vinegrette. It was delicious, but it does't hold a candle to the Fluke Sashimi.We then tasted a dish that resembled a fondue, with individual dipping ceramic bowls over warming candles full of an anchovy sauce. My tongue went straight back to a heavenly dimension in space.. the salad before seemed to have cleaned my palette and prepared me for this. Afterwards came a dish that was both interesting and appealed to more than one sense. It was a sample of seafood served in a shell over a bed of sweetgrass, with incense burning underneath. Yes, there was burning sweetgrass inside the bowl! It was amazing, and I felt like I was sitting in a forest floor while I had my dinner. They then brought us plates of Nigiri Sushi, which was quite impressive. And I've had some very good sushi. There was a taste of squid, in which the texture was perfect in comparison to what I've had in the past. Our next course was lobster and a piece of Wagyu steak wrapped around sweet potatoes. This was the tastiest steak I've ever had in my life. Lobster was even great, even though I'm not a big fan of lobster. (generally too ""sweet"" of a meat for me)We then enjoyed three samples of desserts. The first was an impressive pickled watermelon over frozen, watermelon puree with a dash of yogurt. Healthy, non fattening, and absolutely delicious. The second desert was a green tea tiramisu covered in mascarpone mousse with cherry blossom flavors peeking throughout, and our third was a small pastry ball I didn't recognize. This wasn't my favorite, although it was still very edible. My favorite of the desserts had to be the watermelon one, simply because it was both amazing to the taste and the most unique and healthy dessert I'd ever tried. The sake was wonderful as well, but that is an entirely different review. Overall, this was an incredible dining experience complete with a well trained staff and bathrooms you could live in. Yes, the bathroom experience was unique as well. I encountered heated toilet seats, a bidet with multiple settings, automatically raising seat covers and an infinity mirror in the background with cherry blossoms that made me feel like I was relieving myself on some kind of lucid dream plane. And the Morimoto Omakase is designed to be just enough food to fill up a human quite perfectly.

I was actually on the search for a nice Japanese restaurant to celebrate an early Valentine's and a late anniversary. (Better late than never, but never late is better)We actually arrived 25 minutes past our reservation time but we had been seated fairly quickly despite losing the reservation. I haven't heard much about this restaurant before I found it but I decided to give it a shot. It was a bit crowded upon arrival, but that's expected in NYC at 12am. AMBIANCE:I must say, this is THE fanciest Japanese restaurant I have ever set foot in. Sliding glass doors, dimmed lights, beautiful settings. It made my eating experience so much better - perfect for a romantic night out. The top floor is gigantic. At the backside you can see the Chefs grilling/wrapping away. There is also a wall by the staircase leading to the lower floor that is compiled of glass cups/bottles, very creative. Downstairs includes a bar (also the waiting area once you check in) and more seating. Cellular service is weak down here, fyi. I only had one tiny issue with Morimoto, which may be more or less severe for others - the restrooms. Although the restrooms' decor was unique, including the Jap-tech heated toilets which meticulously clean and dry your bottom, I can't say the restrooms were as clean as you'd expect from a place like this. The men's restroom in particular had dirty and wet floors in the stalls, which reminded me of a restroom in a KTV lounge 4 hours into the night. Restrooms being plural because my SO saw some vomit in the stall of the ladies'. But hey, this isn't enough to take a star off this review - it's not like I took my dinner to the restroom! (Maybe I did.. post-processing)SERVICE:One word, three letters - WOW. Once we arrived and checked in to our reservation, we were offered coat check (don't worry, it's free). Since we had to wait a few minutes for our table, we were told to wait downstairs by the bar and help ourselves to some of their delicious cocktails. Instead of a flashing beeper, text or call, the waiter/waitress would come downstairs and find us! Once we were seated, Alex (the waiter) offered us drinks and explained the menu. They were very observant about our water, refilling it without us ever asking or waiting. The food was served in a timely manner and it seems that Morimoto has a large employee count. Each plate brought to our table was brought by a different server and thoroughly described.FOOD:Ah, the moment you have been waiting for. You've been dying to know how my taste buds reacted. We both ordered the Omakase ($135) and I also ordered the Rock Shrimp Tempura and Half Dozen Oysters appetizers (thanks to the Yelpers for recommending these). I won't waste your time by describing every single course because it'll just make you salivate. Plus this review is already too long. Omakase: (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR FIRST TIMERS)- small portions, but it will fill you up- delicious (currently daydreaming about the toro tartare)- sashimi was 100% fresh- taste was very authentic and satisfying - even smelled amazing - in reference to the seared scallop on a bed of rosemary- dessert was amazing, though the yogurt/black sesame mochi may not be favorable by some since the yogurt was a bit sour. But I L-O-V-E-D it.Half Dozen Oysters:- 3 different seasonings- as fresh as the Fresh Prince of Bel Air- no ""fishy"" taste whatsoever- just slurp awayYamamomo fruit:- this small, red fruit appeared in some of the courses, a sweet fruit (careful, has a pit)Cocktails:- ordered the Elderflower (champagne with a yamamomo in it) which was okay.- also ordered the Hydrangea (forgot the details of the contents) which was very tasty, have a few of these and you'll find yourself wobbling home!COST:This is the only advice I will give - DON'T THINK ABOUT IT. Go in there and remember that this is Morimoto, the house of the Iron Chef! This won't be your typical night out. Your wallet may shrink a bit, but hey, it's so worth it!

896,m_1QgEWdcEIY4D-CrWzDMA,The Sushi Legend ..,4.0 star rating,"Morimoto is prototypical New York; trendy, packed, loud, but above all else, good. In fact, it's actually phenomenal, which I was shocked to find myself saying. Usually when a place has so much hype for sushi, it's because it appeals to the lowest common denominator with great maki rolls with ""americanized"" ingredients. Certainly Morimoto has it's fair share of spicy sauces, but it also has incredibly fresh and unique sushi that still manages to appeal to even the snobbiest of sushi connoisseurs. The Food is incredibly unique. Take the Toro Tartar (pictured right) for example - it comes finely chopped on a slab with ""caviar"" on top. While the accompanying sauces and garnishes aren't for me, the tartar certainly is; the colour is as you'd expect with Toro, and the taste is outstanding. If you've heard of Morimoto before, you've certainly heard about this appetizer - and it lives up to the hype. In addition to the sashimi platter, I also did my usual and ordered a piece of nigiri that I had never tried. In this case, the lucky option was ""Sayori"", or Japanese Needle Fish. Tasted a little chewier than Iwashi (Sardine), which looks similar), but certainly worth it, minus the weird stares that I usually get when I order one piece of something no one at the table has ever heard of.Often times at these touristy restaurants, the food tends to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Usually at sushi restaurants, that means the fancy/cool fish doesn't appear on the menu, but Morimoto bucks that trend; there's plenty of options for both the snob and the rookie. The Atmopshere  is great,  buoyed by excellent service, awesome decor and very high ceilings. We had multiple family members order drinks and deserts over the phone for my date's birthday; all were delivered to the table on time, without a problem.

We went a little overboard and ordered 7 appetizers, 5 entrees, and 5 desserts.The appetizers:- Toro Tartare - excellent, but overhyped- 1 lb Lobster from the raw bar- excellent, I LOVED it- Seared Scallops- perfectly done. I don't really like scallops but I liked this dish- Wagyu beef carpaccio - my favorite of the bunch- crispy rock shrimp tempura- good, but nothing special, also kind of heavy- oyster foie gras- YUMMY. gave the wagyu a run for its money- sauteed foie gras and grilled eel - really good, but the oyster foie gras was betterThe entrees:- Duck Duck Duck - awesome, but the duck was a little hard to cut (too much fat/bone)- Braised black cod - good, but not as amazing as the waitress made it out to be- toban yaki - very yummy, lots of different kinds of seafood in a curry type broth- eel avocado roll - standard- sashimi: uni, hamachi, saba, aji, and sake - so fresh and delicious. I usually don't like uni but have to admit this uni was pretty good.The desserts:- chilled cheesecake souffle - YUM- apple bread pudding - Pretty good! Came with a lot of diced fruit on the side- warm chocolate cake - Very good, even though I don't like chocolate flavored things- mori-monkey bread - Barely touched it, was super cute though- tofu cheesecake - Good, a little flavorless, but came with a powdered matcha dip that made it specialI also have to make a special note of the White Lily mocktail- easily the most delicious mocktail I've had all year. We also each ordered a pot of tea at the end and all really liked our own- I got the cool mint and enjoyed it thoroughly.I think it would've been cheaper if we did omakase for everyone but I am glad we went a la carte and tried everything we wanted to, instead of leaving it up to the chef.I definitely recommend Morimoto if you want a perfect evening. Our waitress was awesome (all of the people working there were great), service was speedy and attentive, the ambiance is great, and the lighting is rather flattering ;) The setup of the restaurant also makes it a great place to go on dates because the layout gives each table sufficient privacy and intimacy.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

For example, the toro tartare, the wasabi, chives, seaweed, avocado puree, rice cracker looks like a rainbow. When you mix it together and eat it together with the tartare, it adds so much texture in the mouth! As for the oyster foie gras, the uni and foie gras makes the oyster takes so rich. How interesting it does not take away the taste of the oyster but add more depth to it! LOVE IT!!

Now flavor was exceptional on a few of our dishes and those deserve the 5 star limit (congee). The rating is just over all and because of the other lackluster meals. We had the duck and this is where the joy and hunger died. The white meat was tough, dry and flavorless. I was shocked but powered through dunking it in all the sauces. The breast was what I think the entire meal was suppose to taste like; heaven. The other lackluster meal was mine and my partners sashimi/sushi. I suppose because I love the cook due to Iron Chef and all the hype on yelp we expected mind blowing orgasim inducing food. What we got was a tease and although it got things started it fell short on the promise. All the meals were shared aside from the raw food and sadly we had a bit of upset stomachs later in the night.

I would give the food 8/10 and the service 10/10. We were 20 min late for our reservation and yet they kindly accommodated us. The tuna tartare course was cool and tasty. I was not a big fan of the miso fondue dish. I loved the scallop. I wish there was a sashimi course as part of Omakase. My favorite course by far was the lobster and wagyu beef.

Each bento box came with a small salad, miso soup, assorted pickled veggies, a bowl of rice, and an entree. You could pick your entree from a list that included: fish, beef, maki, sashimi, etc. I chose the (cooked) fish while my friend chose the beef. Both were absolutely delicious. The fish was cooked to perfection and very moist. However, it did get pretty salty by the end -- I couldn't quite finish it :( The miso soup was so yummy! For dessert, I chose to have the coffee/chocolate over the pistachio ice cream dessert. The dessert was so so good. I would definitely recommend the coffee/chocolate one (although I can't exactly remember what it was called haha). As far as atmosphere, when we entered, the wind was blowing pretty hard, so the red curtains were being sucked into the sliding door hahaha. It made me laugh because the door kept trying to close but there were these stupid curtains stuck in the way.

We walked up to an unmarked building and based on the red curtains in draped in a signature Japanese style, we knew it was Morimoto. The restaurant is very chic and modern and service was great. My only grip with this place is that our table was small and we ordered lots of food, so it got really tight. My bf ordered the following for us: Appetizers:Toro tartareOyster foie grasMorimoto SashimiEntree:Ramen SoupSeafood Toban YakiWhole roasted lobsterDessert:Tofu hot and coldCan't complain about much, except for the fact that we were so full our stomachs hurt. The dishes were pieces of art and I can't get over the presentation. The toro tartare was a palette of extremely fresh toro and assorted sauces. The food was so delicate and fresh it melts in literally your mouth. The ramen was very simple and at first glance, I thought, ""That's it?"" But don't be fooled by the simple clear broth and noodles. There was something about that broth that was unlike any other. No need for spices and garnishes, it was perfect the way it was. The noodles were amazing. Yes, it's an expensive restaurant, but worth the try if you've never been. Definitely get the desserts! It compliments your meal and it's yummy.

Let that settle in for a second. The restaurant is aesthetically beautiful; I love all the white and glass look. Feels very modern. The wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly as well. What also stood out was that the portions were normal sizes unlike a lot of fancy Japanese restaurants I've been to where the flavors are good, but you leave hungry.My best friend was visiting from DC, and we decided to go on a whim with a 10PM reservation on a Sunday. The place still felt happening. The food was fantastic, the perfect blend of east meets west. We ordered several appetizers to share and our own entrees. The oyster foie gras and dobin mushi were two amazing highlights for me. Now I have to go back and do the ""morimoto omakase"" aka chef's tasting menu, hopefully with a boyfriend.

915,cHCo0_gLW1OzenuTPNY2uQ,Marina C.,3.0 star rating,"3 stars and I'm being quite generous.I love Morimoto, but I was completely underwhelmed by his entrees. We had dinner there on New Years Eve, it was packed, we were seated right away with reservations.The decor was minimalistic, very modern. Loved it. For appetizers, we had the toro tartare, it was great combined with the various condiments given, however, by itself, it didn't seem that ""fresh"". Who really minces toro anyway? I'm glad I tried it.. (Morimoto made something very similar to this on an Iron Chef America episode.) Does it live up to the hype? yes and no. Do I love guacamole, sour cream, those little rice crackers? yes, yes and yes. Would it taste great paired with almost anything.. YES!  See my point?We also had the tuna pizza which was a nice surprise, all the ingredients worked beautifully. Simple, but very nicely done. The last appetizer was the kakuni which was just okay. The pork belly was stringy and it was so salty, there wasn't enough congee to dilute the amount of sweet and savory sauce that was on top. Sad to say, it was probably the worse pork belly we've ever had, and when is pork belly ever bad?During our appetizers, the lady to my left ordered the ramen soup - which is NOT a true ramen by any means, it's chicken consommé with noodles. The only reason I noticed, was the intense chicken broth smell that wafted in my direction. $15 is insane for something anyone can make at home. Our entrees were very disappointing, but I had a feeling it would before dining. Nothing really stood out to me, so I settled on the chef combination sushi, Although the fish was fresh, it lacked something.. I don't even think I was that full, but I couldn't finish it. It was somewhat bland and boring.  I'd rather get sushi at Yasuda's. L had the Surf and Turf. It was australian wagyu so it didn't have the fat or flavor Kobe beef has. I thought it was bland, L thought it had too much pepper. Why did I suggest ordering the Duck, Duck, Duck entree after both disappointing dishes? So I didn't have to waste a second visit to taste this popular dish which receives such fantastic reviews on Yelp...Seriously?!! It was horrible, I had a bite of each component. The best part of the dish was the croissant and even that was a total let down because once paired with the duck, it was completely soft and limp. The duck leg was dry and the sauces that came with it was too overpowering. Even the slightest dab of sauce was too much. Even the worse Peking duck from a Chinese BBQ shop beats Morimoto's duck.I had three drinks, the Hydrangea, Snapdragon and an Orange Blossom. Had I been slightly intoxicated, perhaps the food would've tasted better. The drinks were good, not great. Nobu's are much better.2 stars - Service was wonderful, especially on a busy holiday. I loved how all the staff worked together, from the busboys to the the managers. The hostesses were very friendly.1 star - Come for the futuristic decor, lovely atmosphere and a few drinks, don't stay for dinner. This is the second Morimoto location I've dined at and probably my last. You're simply paying for the name, the food is not Iron Chef worthy.

The toro tartare was good enough, but the flavor mix that came with it did not really hit home.

There was a lot of fish, but quality should come first......coming from an iron chef restaurant.......I didn't even finish the bowl, which said something....especially since I was paying for a nice meal(this never happens).The chopsticks looked cool and the bathroom toilet was bidet styled, but I really would have preferred simplistic style with quality in the food.

The heavenly taste reminisced in here, with some nostalgia, made me almost forget to mention the burger was served in a set of the previously cited salads and pickle, with the sweet potato chips substituting the steamed rice.    Two desserts made it to the table to perfect the meal (as if the meal had not reached the highest of perfection at that point, already!).  One of the desserts was a coffee infused chocolate mousse with roasted sesame seeds  (and some chopped coffee beans), and a light caramel sauce.  It was very refreshing, indeed.  The other dessert was a lemon tart with a side of pistachio ice cream, and sparkled with roughly chopped pistachios.  Although I am not really into lemon tarts, I must confess the taste was inviting, and the ice cream was very rich in flavor.  The addition of fresh pistachios did take the whole platter to another level, admittedly.That particular afternoon infused happiness and culinary satisfaction to my taste palate.  It was such a whole experience on so many levels: service, design, atmosphere, taste and presentation.  The company of the Iron Chief (as in the courses enjoyed that were created by him) was worth every dollar spent.  It was everything.  And therefore, I am going back soon, but this time my location will be at table number 35 to soak in all the design of the dining room from a wide angle, while watching people in the breaks I will have between my bites (and I assure you those breaks are truly short at Morimoto since every bite invites the next, promptly!).  (Review of Morimoto Lunch Visit on Wednesday, March 5th, 2014)",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The cocktails are pricey at $14 apiece, but they're both refreshing and strong.  My hydrangea had touches of lychee.Service was attentive, but not overbearing, although our elderly male waiter somehow morphed into a twenty-something, skinny girl by the time we ordered dessert.  That's never happened before... not that this caused a hitch in service.Oh, and the flowers suspended in the clear back wall of each bathroom stall mesmerized me.  ...There's a sentence I never thought I would write.  If my bathroom was like that, I'd hang out in there all the time, kthxbye!And if you're lucky enough, you may just see the Iron Chef himself floating around.  After we checked in with the hostess, we spotted an Asian man just hanging out by the staircase and stared at him, checking out his side profile for a few minutes (""is that Morimoto?""  ""maybe it's some other Asian guy.""  ""it kind of looks like him..."") before I just walked up to him and asked him if he was Iron Chef Morimoto.  And with the straighest face ever, he looked at me and told me he was his twin brother.  Good one, Iron Chef.  Morimoto was friendly and hailed a waiter over so we could snap a photo with him.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Rice was hard, the quality of the fish did not match the price point, all of the sashimi tastes the same-tasteless (how long have they been left in the fridge?). Also steer away from the ramen soup, the ramen is just flat white noodle(never seen that kind of ramen noodle), the soup tastes artificial, is too salty and greasy and the portion is ridiculously small.

I had the black cod (thanks to yelp recommendations!) and it was amazing! The only place I've had a dish like this was in Japan when I was younger, so I was definitely brought back to my childhood! This is a great restaurant week deal because usually a meal here is over $100. For $25 we got a plate of soup, salad, entree and dessert (which was okay). For entrees, my friends got the ribs and the burger, and they enjoyed both. For dessert, I'd say the cream puffs were the winner. The other dessert just had too much whipped cream. A tip- check out the bathrooms in the basement! They are incredible! The reason it's not 5 stars is because I do not think my entree would have been worth paying $25+ alone.. So I would not want to come back when it's full price. Also, the rice was a little to dry, which is not really ok at a five star Japanese restaurant.

BUT, I think that some of the dishes were highly overrated and not worth the price tag.Toro tartare - the dish that everyone RAVES about -- I thought it was completely overrated. Yes, the presentation was nice.. but if you think about it, it's just like negitoro (minus the negi -- green onion -- part), on a wooden block. The dipping ""sauce"" was just soba dipping sauce, I think. The 5 types of sauces? Everyday household stuff, like rice crackers, seaweed paste (the kind that I grew up eating on rice.. they sell them in jars, CHEAP, at any Japanese market!), guacamole, sour cream... come on. Not special. Is that really worth $31? Is the caviar even necessary?However, their baked oyster with uni and seared foie gras, doused in teriyaki sauce, was AWESOME. It was so good that I had to order a second plate. I can't say no to foie..The kakuni (stewed pork belly) appetizer? Also awesome. Melt-in-your-mouth pork, with SO much flavor!My black cod with a ginger-soy reduction was great! It was flavorful, and the fish was nice and tender. However.. it's a very simple dish to make. Is it really worth the price tag? Then again, even Nobu's miso-glazed cod is also uber-easy to make, so I guess it's standard at these Japanese fusion restaurants.The sea bass was.. well.. not as good. The fish itself was amazing - a nice, thick slab of bass, super moist and flaky. However, the flavoring just paled in comparison to the cod, because it was a lot more subtle.Dessert - Tofu ""hot and cold"" - A tofu cheesecake, along with a tofu souffle. Both were amazing... If I could eat these every day, I could totally be a vegetarian. 'Nuff said.So why not 5 stars? Yea, the price tag. A lot of these dishes were very cheap to make...

Unless the food was insanely cheap or insanely expensive, I didn't factor price into my review***So the apocryphal story goes that Atlanta pharmacist John Pemberton was trying to create a headache cure when, mixing chemicals haphazardly, he stumbled upon the formula for Coca-Cola. I mention it because most of the time, experimenting with known, well established ingredients fails miserably. But sometimes, just sometimes, it works.Morimoto is one of those times. This was the very first place we visited upon arriving in NY. It set the bar high. Had I reviewed it immediately afterwards, I would have given it five stars. Time (and eating at a multitude of other world-class restaurants) has a funny way of putting things into perspective though.The decor is upscale, neat, and functional. Save for a wall of back-lit glass bottles, it's surprisingly sparse. Overhead, there appears to be a draped cloth roof, though I suspect it's cleverly disguised corrugated metal. Oh, and check out the bathrooms. Aside from having an infinity mirror arrangement, the toilets also have remotes. Yes, seriously.The food was good, though overall the theme seemed to be ""cleverly executed twists on traditional dishes."" Does that count as culinary originality? You be the judge. We shared the toro tartare (Morimoto's signature dish) as an appetizer, the tuna was gorgeous and seemed to melt in your mouth. Eating it was unwieldy, as you're suppose to scrape the tuna with miniature ice-scrapers, then dip it into the piped sauces provided. Half the fun is in the inventive presentation, half the fun is laughing as your fellow diners try to eat it.I had a wagyu bento box, which I thought was reasonably priced (for NY) at $21. Everything in the box was top-notch, though nothing compelled me to come salivating back for more. The wagyu portion was a bit small at 3 or 4 slices. Though I appreciate the nod to Japanese authenticity (where beef protein is a small portion of the diet), the Texan in me demands.more.beef!Wifey ordered the angry chicken, another Morimoto stalwart. Again, perfectly cooked, flavorful yet slightly spicy. Honestly, perhaps the spice was a bit too subtle. Very good, but it lacked that ""WOW"" moment...which was pretty much the theme of the entire meal. Morimoto is worth a visit, and certainly worth the money, but much like watching Morimoto on Iron Chef, it never generates that jump-out-of-your-seat excitement that a few other restaurants in NY create.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
965,uMXTRNIR2yoCiFa5zLCJEQ,Annabel A.,4.0 star rating,"Came here with my fiancee on a Saturday night. The restaurant is right next to Chelsea market. A bit hard to find in the dark - we had walked right into Chelsea market not realizing it is actually located outside the market behind a large draped japanese curtain. Modern - very CLEAN looking decor. But not too trendy like many of the meatpacking restaurants. We got a tad-bit snooty vibe from the front of house lady which almost ruined my experience because she snapped at us for being 7 min late (it was a rainy night and traffic was bad!). Thank goodness our actual waitress was such a sweet japanese lady, this salvaged my YELP review despite the snooty waitress giving us a shaft table in the corner because ""you are so late we had to give up your table!"". Of course we had to try the omakase tasting menu since other Yelpers had been raving about it. It was pretty spectacular - although I really wished the portions were slightly larger. I am completely aware the idea is to have an adventurous meal of tiny tasting portions...but I did leave feeling like I could have eaten a slice of pizza. The nice thing about Morimoto's omakase menu is that they give you a good variety so you don't feel like you're just eating sashimi and more sashimi. Each of the 8 dishes was unique and left me thinking ""WOW this is new!"" whenever our waitress served us a dish. A particular standout for me was the yellow tail. I wish I could describe to you the flavours that entered my mouth but all I can remember was how rich, smooth and heavenly that dish tasted. The surf and turf was pretty awesome end to the meal as well (and the largest of the tiny servings hooray!). Not to mention, they give you TWO desserts. A couple of Yelpers had highlighted that the bathrooms had Japanese-like toilets with all the funky gadgets - so i made it a point to make an intentional trip to the ladies' room just to check out the fuss. I did not see anything special. It was a regular clean toilet with just a cool automatic sliding door. Would I return? Probably yes - it's a good place to bring an out of town guest. But my tip for hungry foodies is that it wouldn't hurt to grab a cocktail and some pre-dinner bites before the meal so your stomach will leave fully satisfied! =)",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
966,HSZaYITzVVUD8Pe2JEq6uA,Salil M.,2.0 star rating,"Look, I'm going to be completely honest, as everyone else generally is on here.  You have to come to Morimoto's just to say you did. Now that that's out of the way, let's get into quality.  Like other food-goers on here, it's WAAAY over-hyped.  There is NOTHING memorable about eating here aside from a $247 tab for two.  I don't usually care about spending money at a unique restaurant, but this was a fail.  I'll never come here again, nor will I recommend it to anyone.  You can get the same quality at your local sushi joint for 1/10 of the price.Again, go here if you want to tell your friends you went here, or try it if you wanted to (like we did) but expect nothing great.Now that I've said this, hopefully you go in expecting garbage and have the best meal of your life :)",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

It's deconstructed all over the plate. It's a gloppy mess. I thought I was in for higher caliber culinary experience. Not tonight. Cocktails were good.Bigger issue for me was the space. It's looking rather tired. Fix the busted wall edges, paint the bathroom walls, refinish the bar top... Oh, and train your front of the house staff how to handle guests' checked coats.

I ordered the eel and foie gras and eel app which was quite good and the others had the rock shrimp, toro tuna, and some others.  The shrimp was a bit over cooked and tuna was good, but I prefer larger pieces than the chopped style.  My entree, charashi was bulging with fresh fish and other seafood, was well prepared with quality sushi and nicely seasoned rice.  My spouse had a seafood stew and a side of ramen noodles.  Though the flavor was good, it was much too salty (my wife usually adds salt to all her meals) and relatively overcooked.  Same for the ramen, really salty.  Overall a bit disappointed in the food which is the reason for an average review.
