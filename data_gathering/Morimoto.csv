Five years ago, I went to Morimoto Philadelphia for the first time and fell in love. Fast forward five years and I am living in New York City so of course I HAD to go and visit Morimoto New York. This restaurant is hands down my favorite restaurant (and this is an understatement if possible).All I have to say is we FEASTED this time around at the New York location and I loved every single bite. Items we ordered included:1) Toro Tartare2) Yu-burrata with black truffles3) Crispy rock shrimp tempura - classic must get4) Oyster Foie gras - SO good, we had to order another order, unlike anything I've ever tasted before5) Hot stone A5 Wagyu beef - melt in your mouth deliciousness6) Kakuni (pork belly with 10 hour cooked porridge)7) Miso glazed roasted bone marrow -MUST8) Duck Duck Duck9) Braised Black Cod - needed 5 plates for myself10) Pea Shoots with XO sauce11) Chef's combo assorted sushi platter - also melt in your mouth deliciousness12) Dessert- Fiery Chocolate tart, milk chocolate key lime pie, and tofu cheesecake (all three were recommended by server)I recommend everything at this restaurant!!

1,-HeNMooYCVQuWV8GQ1Zg0g,Jasmine R.,2.0 star rating,"I'm going to sound crazy, but this place is not worth the price. For what I pay for 9 pieces of sushi I can get twice as much for a third of the price WITHOUT sacrificing the quality by going to my regular sushi spot. The ambiance is beautiful and the service is great but the price of food here for someone who's a foodie is over the top for food that is mediocre at best. 45$ for a shot of tequila? 26$ for ramen soup? 13$ for a single scoop of sorbet?! No thank you. I've been three times and third times a charm In the sense that it has solidified that I will not be back. But if you want the experience it is exactly that, I will be keeping my money in places where when I leave I'm full",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
2,xzMvA6gPvSx6xZlUaD291w,Jacqueline X.,2.0 star rating,"Overall: heavy and salty American-adjusted and overrated Japanese cuisine.My greatest issue with them is the food came really slow. We waited for almost 30mins and all our food came at one time. And they serve cold and hot foods together, which I found really unprofessional in a Japanese restaurant. We spent $200 for the LUNCH. Toro tartar 2.5/5 : I seemed to expect to much about this signature dish... it is a thin layer of mince toro, and the texture of toro is not outstanding (might because they're too minced). The dipping sauces came with the toro are too light. Rock shrimp tempura 2/5 : I though it would be the regular tempura but turned to be very different. It is deep fried shrimps coated with 2 different sauce. Too much sauce and flavors, and why offer ranch dipping sauce it is not bbq wings...Chef's combo sashimi 3/5: the sea snail and salmon in them are great, especially the sea snail( u don't get to see them at every Japanese restaurant) the rest are just ok.Eel&froie gras bop 2/5: rice with bits of eel, froie gras and advocating served on hot stone pot. $27 is too much for such a dish.  I can understand froie gras is expensive so you only have few grams of it, but they were really stingy about the eel and the advocado. The eel sauce is to salty. Black cod with rice: my bf has it and he think it was under expectation.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

My friend and I both had some issues finding the restaurant as Google Maps shows that it is located inside Chelsea Market; in reality, it is in the same warehouse as Chelsea Market but it has its own entrance. Luckily I called the restaurant and they picked up right away and were able to direct us to the location of the restaurant. I was really impressed by the decor of the restaurant. Part of the decoration includes a lit wall made from clear glass bottles which really gives the restaurant a classy, fine dining look to it. And this is a bit of an odd thing to comment on, but I really liked the chopsticks they gave us? They were clear hard plastic but not too weighty, and once again, they just looked and felt so classy. Our server was very attentive and courteous in explaining everything on the menu and if we needed anything, he was always around to help us without us having to wait too long. For restaurant week, you can order a set which comes with salad, miso soup, and cucumber pickles and finally a dessert. I ordered the sashimi set which came with 10 pieces of chef's selection sushi. Omakase in the city usually costs a pretty penny, but for $29, I was able to get omakase, plus a salad, soup, cucumber pickles, and a dessert - ie not bad!The sashimi set was good, but I don't think the sashimi pieces I received were anything unique or special. I was disappointed to not see salmon in the set (I know I said I was looking for unique sashimi pieces, but come on, salmon is a staple!) I was however, impressed by the dessert I ordered. I ordered the shiro choko, which is a dessert made of white chocolate cream, passion yuzu sorbet, marble meringue and sesame chocolate soil. Not only was it a very pretty dish, it tasted amazing too! It was packed full of flavor and surprisingly, none of the flavors clashed with each other. I also liked the different textures in the dish from the creamy sorbet to the crunch of the sesame chocolate soil. It was a refreshing and light dessert and the perfect way to conclude our service.

12,phywUldtF0U44_LQ8KLAeQ,Annie L.,4.0 star rating,"Went here for date night with the boyfriend. We were indecisive and couldn't choose between Morimoto or Nobu, but ultimately chose Morimoto because I love me some iron chef (it's true).Whoever designed this place....can I please hazz your numba??? Because literally that was the topic of our conversation (among other things) the entire night. From the backsplash of the bar made of plastic bottles stacked upon another to the room divider in the main room made of (yet again) plastic bottles, to the bathroom stall that completely tripped me out....they clearly know how to decorate the place under a budget while still executing quite a presentation.On to the food....we ordered the sashimi appetizer which was beautifully presented but lacked actual FOOD. We finished that easily. My favorite was the chirashi bowl. It was filled with so much sashimi that I couldn't even finish it---and I finish EVERYTHING mind you. I also ordered the barracuda (meh, pass) and the salmon inure (meh, pass). My boyfriend ordered the surf and tuff (LOVEEEEEE THIS!) complete with hanger steak and hamachi. YUM. As for the drinks, you can't go wrong with the MoriMATCHA if you loveeeeee matcha like me. Or the Morimotini which isn't cloyingly sweet...wasn't sweet at all period. It was perfection. I loved it all.I'd give it a solid 5 stars was it not for our lacking service. Seriously, the bartender was SO ON POINT. The moment we were sat, our waitress completely ruined our experience. She was slow, sluggish almost, and sort of killed our mood. Other than that....come here for amazing food and fantastic drinks---just go straight to the bar :)",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The lunch specials are very affordable (~$30 for a set that comes with soup and salad on the side). The food doesn't look that filling bc it's Japanese style, but don't be fooled!! We got the bulgogi lunch set and the 3-roll sushi set. Loved both, one was just as equally tasty as the other. Really glad that the eel in my sushi was fresh and sweet. For dessert we had the infamous chocolate fireball (trust me, it's not that special once the fire goes out, but the choco is to die for)! Lovely place overall. Would like to come back for dinner if I can afford it - hahaha.

14,1-6AY2anFQYgcuEChFse-Q,Christine H.,4.0 star rating,"I came here on a date night with my husband on a Saturday night. The restaurant is classy and elegant and was packed. We had eaten our way through the city so we ended up ordering a couple of appetizers and a roll. I knew I wanted to get the toro tartare. Then we decided on the hot stone waygu, crispy rock shrimp tempura, and the soft shell crab roll. The toro tartare came out first. It was everything I hoped for and more. The caviar and the various dippers on the side were perfection. The presentation was beautiful. After we finished our tartare, we had a 30 minute wait before our next item came out. Although we had to wait, they brought out a complimentary dish to make up for it. It was a whitefish with shavings of truffle on top. It definitely helped me forget about the wait we had. The crispy rock shrimp tempura was fine, nothing special. It was prepared in two different sauces. I preferred the spicy gochujang. It was served with a home made ranch sauce on the side. The hot stone waygu was delicious. It was so tender and because we cooked it on our own, I could make it exactly the way I like - medium rare.  We ended our meal with the soft shell crab roll. It was one of the best soft shell crab rolls I have had. The crab was flavorful and perfectly crispy. It was a perfect end to our night.The service was great. The food was excellent. It is a bit pricey, but I would gladly come back to try some other things on the menu.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The interior of the restaurant is very elegantly decorated. A hell of an interior designer involved I'm sure.The ingredients are very fresh and worth every penny. We ordered the sashimi set, which has 10 pics of sashimi (5 types) and the very popular hot stone wagyu where the beef is cooked on your table on a hot river stone! I would also highly recommend their desserts. I tried the Nama tofu. It tastes like a cheese cake, but is made of tofu with coffee and chocolate flavored sauce and green onions on the top that made it look like a savory Asian tofu dish. It was such an experience and would highly recommend this place for a weekday lunch!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
16,oWtZSiJLuipULfKuhXHBag,Melody P.,5.0 star rating,"I am not over exaggerating when I say this was one of the best restaurants we've been to for Japanese food. The three things that I ate/LOVED was the hot stone wagyu, soft shell crab roll & toro tartare. The flavor and texture of the wagyu was perfect. The soft shell crab roll didn't have imitation crab (almost every restaurant I go to adds that and I don't like it), but it did have masago, avocado & cucumber which I love. I normally don't eat raw fish unless it's fresh and the toro tartare was exactly that! It was so good with the dipping sauces that came with it. I wouldn't say that this restaurant is unreasonably priced, it's about $3-5 more than other places that I've been to for sushi so the quality of everything justifies the price.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The service is great here. I always like going for an early dinner around 5pm to avoid the crowds. The decor is modern luxury but definitely bring your phone light because it's dim. The tuna tartare is a must try. It's served on a vertical plate where you have to scrape it off. You have to see pictures to understand lol.

I ordered the miso cod and my bf ordered the sushi. My bf liked the sushi just fine. I liked the cod, though it was not as good as nobu's, but it came with hard and cold rice. As a (lazy) Asian, I know what day old rice tastes like and they didn't even have the courtesy of microwaving it. It was hard and ""crusty"" in a way that freshly made rice is not. For a higher end restaurant, especially a sushi restaurant, I expected better. Service was friendly but very slow. Also dishes were introduced in a very rushed way. Just ""this is sushi"" and then done. Like, I know it's sushi? The dessert was lovely, though. Passion fruit sorbet atop of fluffy white chocolate and sesame chocolate.

We were indecisive and couldn't choose between Morimoto or Nobu, but ultimately chose Morimoto because I love me some iron chef (it's true).Whoever designed this place....can I please hazz your numba??? Because literally that was the topic of our conversation (among other things) the entire night. From the backsplash of the bar made of plastic bottles stacked upon another to the room divider in the main room made of (yet again) plastic bottles, to the bathroom stall that completely tripped me out....they clearly know how to decorate the place under a budget while still executing quite a presentation.On to the food....we ordered the sashimi appetizer which was beautifully presented but lacked actual FOOD. We finished that easily. My favorite was the chirashi bowl. It was filled with so much sashimi that I couldn't even finish it---and I finish EVERYTHING mind you. I also ordered the barracuda (meh, pass) and the salmon inure (meh, pass). My boyfriend ordered the surf and tuff (LOVEEEEEE THIS!) complete with hanger steak and hamachi. YUM. As for the drinks, you can't go wrong with the MoriMATCHA if you loveeeeee matcha like me. Or the Morimotini which isn't cloyingly sweet...wasn't sweet at all period. It was perfection. I loved it all.I'd give it a solid 5 stars was it not for our lacking service. Seriously, the bartender was SO ON POINT. The moment we were sat, our waitress completely ruined our experience. She was slow, sluggish almost, and sort of killed our mood. Other than that....come here for amazing food and fantastic drinks---just go straight to the bar :)",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The lunch specials are very affordable (~$30 for a set that comes with soup and salad on the side). The food doesn't look that filling bc it's Japanese style, but don't be fooled!! We got the bulgogi lunch set and the 3-roll sushi set. Loved both, one was just as equally tasty as the other. Really glad that the eel in my sushi was fresh and sweet. For dessert we had the infamous chocolate fireball (trust me, it's not that special once the fire goes out, but the choco is to die for)! Lovely place overall.

We had eaten our way through the city so we ended up ordering a couple of appetizers and a roll. I knew I wanted to get the toro tartare. Then we decided on the hot stone waygu, crispy rock shrimp tempura, and the soft shell crab roll. The toro tartare came out first. It was everything I hoped for and more. The caviar and the various dippers on the side were perfection. The presentation was beautiful. After we finished our tartare, we had a 30 minute wait before our next item came out. Although we had to wait, they brought out a complimentary dish to make up for it. It was a whitefish with shavings of truffle on top. It definitely helped me forget about the wait we had. The crispy rock shrimp tempura was fine, nothing special. It was prepared in two different sauces. I preferred the spicy gochujang. It was served with a home made ranch sauce on the side. The hot stone waygu was delicious. It was so tender and because we cooked it on our own, I could make it exactly the way I like - medium rare.  We ended our meal with the soft shell crab roll. It was one of the best soft shell crab rolls I have had. The crab was flavorful and perfectly crispy. It was a perfect end to our night.The service was great. The food was excellent.

We ordered the sashimi set, which has 10 pics of sashimi (5 types) and the very popular hot stone wagyu where the beef is cooked on your table on a hot river stone! I would also highly recommend their desserts. I tried the Nama tofu. It tastes like a cheese cake, but is made of tofu with coffee and chocolate flavored sauce and green onions on the top that made it look like a savory Asian tofu dish.

The three things that I ate/LOVED was the hot stone wagyu, soft shell crab roll & toro tartare. The flavor and texture of the wagyu was perfect. The soft shell crab roll didn't have imitation crab (almost every restaurant I go to adds that and I don't like it), but it did have masago, avocado & cucumber which I love. I normally don't eat raw fish unless it's fresh and the toro tartare was exactly that! It was so good with the dipping sauces that came with it. I wouldn't say that this restaurant is unreasonably priced, it's about $3-5 more than other places that I've been to for sushi so the quality of everything justifies the price.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

As a (lazy) Asian, I know what day old rice tastes like and they didn't even have the courtesy of microwaving it. It was hard and ""crusty"" in a way that freshly made rice is not. For a higher end restaurant, especially a sushi restaurant, I expected better. Service was friendly but very slow. Also dishes were introduced in a very rushed way.

For dessert we had shiro choko and soba hana. If you do not like the raw wheat taste, soba hana might taste weird to you. As for shiro choko, the sourness of the sorbet and the sweetness of sesame chocolate creates an interesting balance. I would give the overall taste, quality, and presentation of the food 4.5 stars.[Service] We booked in advance for a weekday lunch, but still waited for 5-10 minutes.

I heard great things about Morimoto and wanted to see what all the hype was about. Unfortunately, my experience here was pretty poor.I came here for restaurant week lunch and I think the worst part of the meal was the service. The food we got was decent (nothing too special) - I wound up getting the 10 pc sashimi and the shiro choko dessert - but the service was really poor. First of all, we waited an hour for our sashimi dish which was absolutely unacceptable. We allotted a good amount of time (1.5 hours) for the meal which has been a perfect amount of time for every other restaurant week where there are three courses (this one only has two because the sides come with the main), but we nearly missed a meeting afterwards because of this delay. Nobody really came to check in on us throughout the meal either - I had to ask for water numerous times and check on our food several times as well.If the service were better, I'd probably give Morimoto a 3 or 3.5 because it's definitely not worth the price normally, but the service was extremely subpar so unfortunately I think a 2 star rating is warranted here.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The restaurant is beautiful with its modernized, nautical ambiance in a venue spacious enough where patrons could dine in peace. The staff are delightful, and the food was fresh, creative, and delicious (highlights for me were the chirashi and seared ahi & mizune salad), and they also offer a vegetarian menu, for those of you who don't eat seafood. Morimoto, your food did not disappoint. However, I would have to give major kudos to how amazing the staff were. I came with my family, and we got into a really dramatic argument (we're dysfunctional but love each other; don't worry), with someone leaving the table mid-way through. When she returned, our waiter gave her complimentary serenity tea (!!). At the end of our meal, the manager (I believe) came by to make sure we were doing alright, & offered us a dessert menu. We were indecisive, so he disappeared and shortly returned with complimentary mochi balls. Thank you to the Morimoto team for feeding us incredible food & looking out after us. Especially given how stressed our party was, we genuinely appreciated all the small yet heartwarming gestures.

The inside decoration is pretty good and it was quiet at lunchtime on a weekday as there were just a few people at this time.  Services were very nice. Waiters were polite and ready for your order at any time. We (2 people) ordered a sashimi set and the hot stone wagyu which we can cook the beef by ourselves. There were 10 pieces of sashimi with 2 pics of each type. The meat of the sashimi is very fresh and delicious. The hot stone wagyu is special and the beef tastes good. The only problem is the stone is not hot enough after a while, so we may need to spend a little more time to heat it and the scene is not so amazing. We also order the Nama tofu as our dessert. The taste is very soft, like the combination of cheesecake and tofu, but it tastes more like the former one, although it is made of tofu. With the chocolate sauce at the bottom, the taste of this dessert is perfect. It is impressive because of its Asian ingredients and western flavor.The price of the weekday lunch is not too expensive and it is worthy to have a lunch in weekdays for such fantastic experience and taste!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

First of, the location is right next to Chelsea Market which makes the area busy but definitely puts you in the right mood to experience a good lunch or dinner.Service upon entry was very good with someone checking us in and another taking our coats almost immediately despite being very busy at the time. The area is elegantly decorated with a modern flair with a bright, crystalline theme. We also noticed how the tables are separated with a thick glass divider which helped give a measure of privacy during your meal while still feeling connected to the ambience of the rest of the restaurant. Our server was fast, attentive but not at all intrusive.On to the important stuff though - the food! We ordered the Braised Black Cod, and the Sashimi, with the Wagyu Carpaccio as an appetizer. Finished it off with the Shiro Choko for dessert. The star of the show was definitely the Wagyu Carpaccio. It was extremely tender, very flavorful, beautifully marinated but not overwhelmingly so. Could very easily have finished off another order. Not far behind was the Cod. Nicely cooked, it was soft and had the mouth melting texture you want from seafood. It was extremely good. The sashimi was good and solid as well, with the pieces of salmon and tuna nice and fresh and other accompanying pieces ranging from octopus to mackerel. The dessert rounded out the meal very nicely. After the meal, we all had that nice feeling of being very satisfied but not sickly stuffed.I really enjoyed my time at Morimoto and would love to come back for a full dinner here in the future.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

From the chic interior to friendly service to obviously delicious and well presented food, this is a place to bring someone to impress. For apps, we got the wagyu which was fun to cook on the table, and the bone marrow. GET THE BONE MARROW. Not many reviews mentioned this but it is absolutely delicious. For mains, we got two Maki rolls and the duck. I'm sure any roll at this place will be great so you can't go wrong. The duck was good but a bit awkward to eat with their bread. I think it would be better if they cut the duck and bread into smaller pieces to make them more like sliders so that it's easier to eat. Got the flaming chocolate ball as dessert. This definitely is a crowd pleaser as it ignites into a tall flame that burns blue for a few seconds before it melts the chocolate. The taste however wasn't great as the chocolate tasted low quality and the alcohol used to ignite totally overpowered the dish. Good to get once to see the effect but wouldn't get it again for taste.

With the massive volume necessary to meet demand, it more often means sacrificing quality for the sake of efficiency. Despite that there are also gems that can be found. The entrees were average with the dry-aged burger being the standout option thanks to flavorful and juicy beef patty sandwiched by a sweet nori infused bun with a perfect hint of milk. The desserts were the highlight of the menu and three-and-half of the four stars in this review belongs to the two creative and delicious offerings on the RW17 menu. The first choice, shiro choko, was a spectacular blend of a smooth, white chocolate cream base contrasted with a mildly tart passion fruit yuzu sorbet. The marble meringue wafer was a big hit amongst the millennials of the group, and the giant glass serving bowl was a great touch. The second choice was a light yoghurt parfait, named the azuki hana, glazed with a layer of sake jelly. The blueberry, strawberries, and mochi infused in the jelly gave this beautiful dessert a ""flowery"" presentation.Executive pastry chef Natsume's dessert creations are worth coming for alone and that was probably our biggest takeaway from our RW2017 visit.

I have wanted to come here for quite some time now, however the price point was always intimidating for this poor little church mouse  so when restaurant week finally came around I had to book reservations. The inside of this place is amazing it's big and spacious (two floors) and the interior design is nicely done. It has a nice and elegant design with a modern spin to it, I like it a lot! Our waiter, as well as the rest of the staff, was really nice and very professional, as well as very tentative. Sadly I didn't get his name, so I can't give him a proper shout out, but he was great. Now let's get to the most important part...the bathroom! Haha just kidding. The food here is really good. I ordered the sashimi and my friend got their beef burger. I like that their lunch sets comes with a salad, a couple of small side dishes, and soup. The side dishes were pretty delicious and I thought they were flavored nicely.  I really likedthe dressing on top of the salad, I think it was some type of sesame or ginger flavoring. Also the miso soup wasn't salty and the tofu inside wasn't bland. Hooray!Now getting to the main course...that sashimi was some of the freshest fish that I've ever eaten. It was velvety and not ridiculously chewy, safe for the octopus, which I wasn't the biggest fan of. My friend's burger was pretty good, in my opinion, but she wasn't too impressed by it but she still enjoyed her meal overall, we both did. The desserts were also really good and the design was very pretty. I liked the combination of the white chocolate cream and the passion fruit sorbet. They were definitely a nice balance because passionfruit is a very strong flavor by itself. And the parfait was good as well, very light and not too sweet. Overall food was great!The only thing is because it gets so busy, do expect to wait a bit when it comes to getting your check and getting it back in order sign it, if you're paying with card, but it's not the end of the world.P.s The bathroom is really cool by the way.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Omg). We were able to make reservations the day of at 5:30pm when the restaurant opened. We figured that it would be enough time to have dinner and then go to our Broadway show at 8pm. There is complimentary coat check when you walk in and also a downstairs bar/lounge area. I love the glass (?) bottle wall in the middle of the restaurant and the open kitchen/sushi bar.  What I liked most about Morimoto compared to other Japanese (""$$$$"") restaurants I've been to is there is a wide variety of sushi, sashimi, and hot/cold appetizers and entrees. For starters we ordered the toro tartare and this was probably the best fish tartare that I've ever had. The toro literally melted in my mouth and who knew sour cream would pair so well with toro?! Not to mention the presentation was so pretty. Next, we had the wagyu carpaccio which was also melt-in-your-mouth tender. Although it was good, it didn't blow my mind like the next dish: Grilled eel with foie gras. Holy crap, I had no idea a dish like this existed but I'm so glad that it does - and it's at Morimoto. I love unagi, and paired with foie gras and the lemon and pears on the side, it's truly a luxury. I savored every single bite! The foie gras was also huge - way bigger than the eel and we were struggling to finish it before our next course. I was surprised they offered such a big piece of foie gras. For entrees, we had the surf and turf, which came with hamachi ribbons, wagyu, and a hashbrown - random, but pretty good. I would pass on the surf and turf, the wagyu was a bit overcooked even though we asked for medium rare, and the hamachi was covered in what tasted like guacamole. On the other hand, we ordered the black cod, which was very flavorful. I think Nobu is still my #1 in terms of flavor and softness of the black cod, but Morimoto does it pretty well. I wish there were more options for dessert, but they did give us a complimentary dessert to celebrate our ""monthiversary""; which we finished in less than a minute because we were already cutting it close to our showtime!

The staff was not as attentive as they use to be. It took several attempts to get our waiter's attention and I noticed that when a new table is seated, the tables are wiped with a towel. Is that even sanitary? I ordered similar things this time. Tuna tartar was still good as I last remembered, but the sukiyaki was average. The desserts were disappointing. The highlight of the meal was the rock shrimp appetizer that I ordered. Came in two flavors with dipping sauce. That isn't saying much since the appetizer should not overcome the main entree's. My last visit was last year in August when it was less busy. Perhaps this time around during Valentine's Day they were understaffed? Who knows.

68,5HeSZTymh8AZh6h1vzwxRQ,Caroline K.,4.0 star rating,"I have to write all of this down before I forget.Most importantly, I have wanted to try this restaurant for literally almost a decade.  I remember I first found out about it when I was a wee little college freshman through posh friends who went to expensive art schools and were funded extensively through their trust fund parents, an unfortunate circumstance unbefitting to my own life since I couldn't afford such a dinner.  And then of course add the plethora of amazing NYC restaurants/fine dining/romantic dinners and Morimoto promptly gets placed on the backburner.Fast forward a decade, here I am, baby! I was a little afraid the place would've been played out by now, fearful that the menus would be replaced by some fusion-esque attempt resulting in equal measures of horror and disappointment.  But it wasn't!  Woohoo!The restaurant is beautiful, no doubt, but I've been to so many beautiful posh dining restaurants in NYC that it's just another dime to me at this point.  The atmosphere is a bit douchey if I do say so myself (Meatpacking, I guess) and I overheard people saying how the sushi bar is the prime spot for seating.  Hrm.We did the chef omakase tasting (hey, you only live once) and it was divine.  Absolutely divine.  It's not cheap ($140/pp) but it's worth every single bite.  Seriously, I'm still craving the courses.We also split the oyster with foie gras and uni as an appetizer....MAN.I won't go too much into detail about the 7 courses, but my personal favorites were of course the nigiri set (DUHHHHH), the egg custard served in a steaming glass chock full of uni, dashi and eel (OMG), the wagyu beef with shishito peppers and mushroom served atop a steaming stone slab so that the meat cooks perfectly, the little sample tasting of the toro tartare with creme fraiche and caviar (I need to come back for the full size set for this, this was just pure foodgasm at its finest), and my absolute favorite, the yuzu sorbet as a palate cleanser so we'd have a blank slate for the nigiri.Seriously, what is life?",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

You know it's good when you give a 5 star yelp review while in your uber on the way home. The restaurant is modern, has an open floor plan, and the seating feels private because there's an adequate amount of spaces between each of the tables. We had a booth and it was very cozy with enough space for everyone. Even when the restaurant got busy it didn't get loud. Our waiter was knowledgeable, patient, and equipped enough to guide us through the menu. The food was brought out in a timely & considerate manner. For each course when you finish, your table is cleaned and your utensils are changed. This is a beautiful form of detail displayed by the staff there.We tried the cult favorites for appetizers: The oysters & foie gras, grilled wagyu skewers,  the bone marrow, the toro tartare (pictured) and the rock shrimp tempura. All of the mentioned courses were cooked and flavored perfectly.For my entree I had the surf & turf. First of all the wagyu meat had the texture of BUTTER. It completely just melted in my mouth and was so unbelievable. It came with a side of tuna ribbons which complemented the steak perfectly and came in a delicious avocado sauce. The birthday boy's entree was the sushi platter which came with about 18 pieces altogether. The sashimi tasted like it was caught 5 minutes before it was served. When you eat sushi, the freshness is important and Morimoto absolutely serves up some the freshest fish and seafood I've ever had to date. Sushi lovers: this place is for YOU ! For dessert we had the yuzu flan, the chocolate mousse, and the japanese cheesecake. I could go on and on. Thank you, Morimoto!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Luckily I didn't mind going to Morimoto because the food here is fantastic!Walking into the restaurant on a Saturday night felt like a scene from Sex and the City when the ladies would check out a new restaurant. Yes I know Morimoto isn't new by any means, but that's the atmosphere here. I loved the chill music playing in the background, and the beautiful light display in the center of the restaurant. We were able to grab a drink downstairs before being seated at our table. I liked that we were seated slightly higher up towards the right of the restaurant. Gave us a little more privacy. Our server was amazing. He was friendly and attentive, and also very knowledgeable about the restaurant. DrinksThey have a very extensive drink menu which be were very happy about. We got to try 2 of the specialty cocktails here before dinner and they were great. I loved the White Lily, and my bf's Sukotto was good too. Nice amount of heat to the drink without being over the top. We ordered a carafe of saki with dinner and it was the perfect accompaniment to our meal. FoodMy bf decided to forgo the omakase so we ordered a couple things off the menu. -Toro tartare...There's a reason you see tons of pictures online. That's because its delicious! And that's coming from someone that doesn't usually like sushi. Presentation is A++ too-Rock Shrimp tempura...I liked that it came prepared with 2 different sauces and wasn't heavy on the breading, although I liked the spicy sauce better than the wasabi one-Ramen...incredibly flavorful broth, and not overly salty! Mmmmm-Braised Black Cod....this dish transported me back to Hawaii and one of my favorite dishes I ate there. It wasn't exactly the same, but it was pretty darn close. The flavor is unreal-Duck Duck Duck...My bf wasn't too happy with the sandwich portion, but we both agreed that the roasted duck was awesome. Nice and crispy on the outside.-Eggplant side dish...special side of the evening. We were trying to figure out how it was prepared because it was so good! Tender and seasoned with some delicious toppingI know there are countless restaurants in NYC, but I'd happily come back here in a heartbeat.

She summarized things quite well with very concise wordings.Their seafood options are all very good, although I'd say the tuna tartare was waaay smaller than I have expected (from looking at the other Yelp pictures), I would still recommend it just for its looks/check off since it is very nicely presented.Their WAGYU BEEF CAPRICCIO was amazingly tender and juicy, MUST try. We also ordered their spicy king crab, wagyu on hot stone - where you can cook yourself (8 seconds on each side for medium rare), uni, a lychee cocktail and yuzu cocktail with sake.Last but not least we also tried their Duck Duck Duck, it's sort of like a Peking Duck style.

Chef Morimoto is one of my heroes so anything he is involved in, I will give it a try with all my heart. So writing this review breaks my heart a little bit. Here is what you need to know about Morimoto:1. It's not the best sushi place in Manhattan. If you want a great omakase, there are other places that I would recommend first.2. Reservations are highly necessary at any party size.3. The staff don't really understand that they're talking about which can lead to some miscommunication.4. The toro tartare is the most worth-it dish from the appetizer perspective.5. Overall, the sashimi was not that impressive. The waygu beef was the best part of it, which is saying something.6. The fiery chocolate tart is a unique dessert worth getting.7. Solid cocktails but that doesn't make up for the overall mediocre sushi.If you're going to drop the cash, I would recommend other places.

The Australian wagyu was delicious. I loved the sauce that it came with. Recommend you to try but did not top the list. Toro tartare is good but not one of my favorites. It is a favorite amongst my friends. The hot stone wagyu is on the same page as the toro tartare. The meat is served raw on the side and you cook it on the hot stone.

102,vWgl5edtHyFzBKUFsSoFMQ,Bren W.,5.0 star rating,"My friend and I decided to come to Morimoto for restaurant week, and it was the best decision ever. We got the earliest reservation possible, right when they opened and were able to witness the start of the day serenity. By the time we finished lunch, the restaurant was packed to the brim with many others waiting in line to get in. The food was fantastic. We both got the wagyu burger (who in the world gets a burger in an esteemed Japanese restaurant, right), but it was one of the best decisions ever. The photos may make it look like any old burger, but the toppings and sauce gave it such a wonderful and unique twist that I can still recall the taste as I'm writing the review. We also had sides of chips and miso soup. Our meal was wonderfully wrapped up by one of the most delicious desserts I've ever had too!Our server was so nice and understanding when we took forever to decide what we had wanted to eat, was very lighthearteded when he joked with us about what the reviews on yelp say, and was very helpful with recommendations. During our meal, a manager came to our table (and all other tables too) to ask how our meal was and to thank us for choosing them for restaurant week. This blew my mind because I felt like I was being treated just like any other customer (and not just a restaurant week-er) because I've had experiences in other restaurants where I was treated rudely because I only went for restaurant week.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Granted it was early on a Sunday so when we arrived around 6pm, it was empty. By 7...packed.Yes, Morimoto is super pricey but you pay for the overall experience. The restaurant is sleek and very cook, the fish is incredibly fresh, service is excellent, and the toilet seats are heated...figured I'd throw that in there because it's an awesome perk.Anyway, we ordered the oyster fois gras and beef tartar to start and both were excellent. We also got a few rolls - spicy tuna, salmon, California, and toro. The rolls were awesome except the toro but we were able to swap it for yellowtail jalapeño, a much better choice. We paired it with some sake, obviously, but warming: no hot sake served here, only cold.Also, the cheesecake soufflé is a great dessert choice.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I'll just focus on the decor, service and food.What we had- Toro Tartare - OMG. This was sooooo freakin' good. My friends and I shared everything we ordered, so I didnt have much. I wanted to grab it and run off. Its tuna tartare spread out on a glass flat dish, with condiments. Yum, Yum, Yum. - Tuna Pizza with olives, anchovy aoile, and jalapeño. Until last year I didn't eat raw fish at all. I was missing out!!! You can expect that fish at Morimoto to be of the freshest. The flavors were right on. - Pork Gyoza - Oh you know I can't go anywhere without ordering some sort of dumpling. It was tasty, but I expected more. If I go again, No, when I go again, I'd skip this dish because while its tasty, its too filling, and I'd rather get like my OWN Toro Tartare :). - Tofu Miso Soup - Its a great miso soup, but I'm not sure why I ordered soup. Another thing that filled me up, that was good, but less good than other food I had.- Sushi roll - don't remember which one we had, but the regular roles are just not memorable. Plain sushi, nothing special. Not particularly better than your regular sushi joints.- Duck Duck Duck, the dishes were tasty and delicious. Duck isn't my favorite, it was a friends dish and I tasted it. - Braised Black Cod - food orgasm. This was so good, I was ooh'ing and ah'ing at every bite. The ginger soy reduction was amazing, and did not overpower the taste of the dish. They could have given me 4 of these, and I would have polished off my plate. Even those little tiny beans on the plate  had this interesting sweetness to it.  On to dessert:We ordered the cheesecake, and a white chocolate with passion fruit dessert. The cheesecake was just good, but the other was out of this world. We got the flaming chocolate dessert on the house! That was also incredible, but I do find chocolate to be too much for me after a big meal. They fire it up at the table, and it makes it really exciting. Drinks: I don't know what my drink was called but it was a cayenne infused drink. I love some spiciness in my beverage. Service was amazing. The waiter was attentive. They were always there when needed, but not too intrusive. Impeccable service. Great decor. There are so many decor photos on this page, no need for me to post any.

We had the last lunch appointment (not last patrons in the place). The waiter came over and seemed like he was ready to go before he said hello. Never introduced him self, did not talk about the menu - just came over and asked what do you want to order? In any case we order a roll to start off (I skipped breakfast for this!) and our meals. I know they were closing soon but geese the food came out in 10 mins with the rolls. I got the soft shell crab with noodles and my friend got the black cod. The bus boy came over with the food ""who has this cod?"" and just kind of gave us our food to fend for our selves. I was so wrapped up in talking with my friend I started eating my noodles and complain how bland they are. Quickly realizing there was a broth on the side to pour into the noodles. A place like this, I would think they would pour it in for you at the table side or at least point out everything on your tray when serving, which neither happened.

I had the short rib it was ok at best.. expect to walk out hungry as the portion was small. The meat was literally one slice of short rib the size of half my palm. However, if your food is just ""ok"" at least perfect your service. Our server was rude to the table next to us- granted they were two young girls that might have been a little annoying but it made me uncomfortable to sit there and watch the server treat them the way they were treated- those two girls were shocked by how they were treated as well. I was also served two of the same desserts when I ordered the Soba Hana and the Choko but were given two Choko. I told this to the food runner who brought them out and asked him to take back one since it was incorrect but he refused and said to keep both and he would bring the correct one--- it never happened. Instead I was given my check and rushed out. I just laughed at the situation as I didn't even feel like arguing or bringing it to anyone's attention after witnessing the awkward service next to my table.

I came during restaurant week and ordered the sushi & maki combo. All the side dishes were over-salted and the sushi rice was undercooked and ruined the taste of the raw rice. Sure I came fairly early at 12:30, but that's not a good enough excuse to undercook your sushi rice. I would've rather waited longer for better sushi. I know usually it's the helpers that cook the rice, but it doesn't hurt to taste it before serving it to customers who pay $10-20 for one single nigiri. Also, the maki roll had too many sesame seeds to the point it was overwhelming. The table to my side saw what I was given and asked the waitress if they could change their order to udon noodles instead.... I really wished I got the noodles while I was eating my sushi.Luckily, however, dessert was a lot better. I got a mousse with chocolate and a yuzu sorbet. It would've been better if they gave a smaller scoop of the sorbet because it was much too sour. I picked off only the sides of it to enjoy the dessert. On the other hand, the bathroom is really nice! It has the typical high-tech toilet with warmed seats, and the stall looks amazing! The overall aestetics of the restaurant is well thought-out: the art wall made of filled-water bottles, the multicolored bar, the transparent bar stools, and the japanese-themed table setting (including the chairs). In addition, the music was well-selected, and everything together created a rather pleasant ambience.

During my fourth coming back here, I realized it was probably my last.  Don't get me wrong, the food was amazing, but for it's price point, it is just too expensive for my blood.  The chopped up toro eaten with the six side condiments were amazing.  Who else would have thought to eat raw tuna toro with nori paste, wasabi, sour cream, chives, guacomole, and rice crispies.  The caviar that tops the toro tartare, is amazing as well.  The sushi and uni pasta salad that we got, was also very delicious.  Our bill came out to be about $200 and we were still hungry.  I'm glad I got to experience what it was like but I don't think I'll be coming back.  On a brighter note, the service was impeccable, my water level never reached the bottom of the glass.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Service was amazing and the respect they give to their patron are as close as eating in Japan.My problem lies with the Resturant week menu only. If you are reading this, no need to skip to the end- just avoid this selection of the menu. Choose from their wonderful regular menu and prevent disappointment.Perhaps it was my fault for booking lunch here for the Winter Restaurant Week in hopes for a great tasting menu, and was shocked there was none for the lunch menu. Just a lunch entree, that included a dessert, and some Resturant week inspired cocktails that anyone dining could order.Each lunch entree came with the following:Miso soup- which is same original taste as Japan. Good, but quite standard with a fresh, soft piece of decadent tofu at the bottom. Salad- which was wilted perfect for a soft bite dresses with very good, refreshing ponzu sauce that was sweet to the taste. Simplicity at its best.Raw Green beans- served cold bursting of earthy and fresh flavors. It was a very strong and unadulterated Uncooked flavor that I really loved!Gomaae Pickled Cucumber- very nice sesame and spice with a crisp slice of pickled cucumber Entree- Sushi Combo:Standard proper sushi. Rich was proper, flavorful, and spot on with the texture and hardness. Hamachi (yellowtail)- fresh. Sake (salmon)- fresh and melting in your mouth. Tai (red snapper)- fresh. Seared tuna- fresh and flavorful. Ebi (cooked shrimp)- fresh but very very boring. The Maki was a Tuna roll that was  absolutely amazing! It had a kick of spicy and a earthly blend of flavors that I could not identify. Gari (Ginger) was so nice and the tone of potency was leveled down perfect. Came with fresh wasabi root that was not overwhelming. Entree- 5 Spice Pork Belly:Pork belly taste was a bit different and unexpected. It was a bit too sweet with an extreme ""raw-pork"" flavor. The rice was cooked perfect, yet the tamago was too hard and overcooked. The whole dish felt just mass produced and left a greasy pork-flavored film in the mouth with each bite. It wasn't horrible, however, I guess my expectations were too high for the Iron Chef's Resturant. Verdict: ???Course Dessert: Chocolate Fondant vs Pot De CremeCake was horribly dry and service with a boring scoop of coffee ice cream. Pot de Creme was quite generic, however with a rather nice apricot-Carmel sauce and sesame flake.Verdict: pot de creme On the other hand, the Cocktail was a huge hit! Tokorozawa was a beautiful blend of chamomile infused applejack, pineau de charentes, Fuji apple pervaded honey and demonstrated the epitome of a tasting of the the Chefs skill. The real question iss, who really got this on the menu? There was only a hint of honey with a citrus burst of strong alcohol in each sip. That with the garnish of a charred lemon peal made it easy to drink and wanting more. I only wish it was actually served hot, instead of lukewarm. All in all, everything was fresh with quality ingredient, however, nothing about the food really blew me away.

But the food - oh, goodness, I'm not happy with the food.The oysters were mostly good - a touch of soy & spice, or a zest with ginger, very interesting toppings on the raw bar. Liked it. One oyster was bad, so left it. Mountain plum in the center - don't forget it, it's tasty.The Rock Shrimp Tempura was two styles - the fresh ranch on the side was mostly ignored, but was a simple taste. The spicier version was almost buffalo. The other version was a creamy wasabi aioli. Good, but hard to eat more than a few pieces (too oily). One table downed 2 orders between 3 people!The uni + ikura they were out of. We tried the udon instead, which was ok - a tiny bit of uni, and the noodles were too soft for soba. The ramen soup was a disappointment - the chicken tasted it like it'd been in the soup for far too many hours, and the soup itself was so salty that I could compare it to the chicken noodle from Campbell's. The manager apologized for it and removed it from the bill.Tamago - excellent.The Morimoto chirashi - great fish on top, and a good healthy portion, but the rice underneath was salty. Someone left too much liquid on the fish when preparing and let it drain into the rice? The rice did not taste good.Lastly, a dessert - the chilled cheesecake soufflé was one of the better parts of the meal. Fresh fruit, orange cream cheesecake (light and fluffy), and a drop of blood orange meringue.Overall - service from Matt R and Joel (the manager) was top notch. too bad I couldn't say the same for the food! =( We'll have to give it a shot another time... though probably will skip much of the non-sushi/fish dishes.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Service was meh; it was packed inside and we were squeezed in between a couple of other parties, so it was a little awkward. Decor is modern and the restaurant is spacious for NYC. Definitely a dining experience worth having. After hearing much about the toro tartare, we decided to order it off the restaurant week menu. It's a small serving, so the four of us only had a few bites each. It was incredibly fresh, fun to eat, and the dipping sauces were delectable. I myself am not a huge fan of tuna, so it was fun to order, but I don't feel that I would need to get it again. I ordered the dry aged burger, which is probably the best burger I've ever had. The beef was tender; it almost seemed to melt (maybe that's a weird description but it was amazing). Only complaint is that they seemed to forget the shiitakes on my burger -- very disappointing. The sweet potato chips it came with were yummy, along with the miso soup. I especially loved the salad -- incredible dressing! I also tried the nigiri, which met expectations, fresh and beautiful.For dessert, I ordered the chocolate lava cake which was enjoyable but not memorable.

The sashimi itself was very good, though I may have gotten 9 pieces instead of 10. (2 ea. of four different fish, and 1 pc of shrimp - or does the shrimp count as 2 pcs??) The tuna and salmon were my favorite - very fresh and buttery. However I found a bone in one of the pieces of salmon, which was extremely disappointing for a restaurant with a reputation like Morimoto, even given the RW price reduction. I've gotten sushi and sashimi everywhere - cheap restaurants, expensive restaurants, buffets, in Japan and other countries - and I have never once encountered a bone.I enjoyed the pot de creme. It's essentially like a custard pudding, with a light, refreshing passion fruit flavor, and it's topped with green tea pound cake.Overall the food and service were good and I'm glad I was able to take advantage of RW at Morimoto but I'm not sure if I'd ever return, RW or not.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Don't get me wrong, this restaurant is good- but I just don't think it's enough for my taste buds for the price of the omakase tasting menu. There is 7 courses in total, two fish dishes, one salad, one sushi variety set, a main dish of surf and durf and dessert. My favorite is the first dish with the toro on a plate with caviar and different sauces on the bottom. I thought the other ones were just okay, including the sushi. It tasted just kind of bland to me, not sure why. We also ordered appetizers to share. I had rather high expectation for the ikura with uni, but it came in a jelly like kind of gluey, gooey mixture and I can't be sure it really bought out the extinct tastes of the two main ingredients. I usually love raw food but this mixture just tasted kind of yucky...The oysters with foie gras however was really good! Actually I think the it was the highlight of the meal. The oysters were baked just to the right amount and it was topped with a small piece of foie gras on side which added some depth to the sea, salty flavor of the oysters. The dessert was some kind of manga pudding with ice cream(?) shell outside. Didn't like it that much, was a really too heavy after the main dish of the surf and durf. Something I appreciated is that they brought out a small dish to cleanse the palettes after the heavy main course. It was like a small fruit stick. Oh, the bathroom is pretty. Automatic toilets with Sakura filled reflective glasses in each stall( gives the image of being in the infinity room). Overall, I think I am willing to give this restaurant a second chance. KEEP IN MIND ORDER THE SMALL DISHES, not SUSHI or MAIN. The oysters and the toro appetizers were actually really good, just not the sushi and main course.

I love how there's a tasteful bar downstairs you can grab a drink while waiting for your table (or party in my case hah). One problem I have with the restaurant is that tables are way too close together. Try sitting at the bar if you can. But even so not much privacy offered for parties.Food is pretty damn good though. Some specialties that really stood out and makes me want to go back are:1. Wagyu steak A5 appetizer - amazing melt in your mouth steak! It comes on a hot stone plate so you can cook the meat yourself and is accompanied with a variety of dips. So good.2. Toro tartare - you will appreciate it more if you are a fan of caviar. The first couple times I came here and tried this dish I thought it was mediocre but the last time I really really enjoyed the blend of flavors.3. Cheesecake soufflé - mmm this was delicious. I love Japanese dessert because it's light and not overly sweet. This one paired well with the sorbet and fruit!Other dishes we got:1. Uni foie gras scallop appetizer - very tasty but heavy and buttery. Could only eat one of them2. Wagyu quail egg steak tartare appetizer - my date enjoyed this a lot but I think it cannot compare to the wagyu A5 dish3. Black cod black bean main course - good but I've had better at other Japanese places in the city 4. Sukiyaki - Would get this if you're not trying to sample a lot of different foods because it doesn't stand out but is good on its own5.

I assume that the restaurant ran out of caviar because it did not come with our dish, and when it was brought to the server's attention and back to the kitchen, it returned still w/o caviar. Tasty dish but I wouldn't order again at this price, it's pounded thin and you aren't able to get the full taste from the fatty tuna.udon - three sets of chilled noodles. honestly not much flavor profile to any of the three.

I enjoyed three of the five, one of which was salmon, the other tuna, and the third a white first whose name confounds me at the moment. The fish was the perfect temperature, which brought out the fatty, delicious flavor of the fish. The sides were everything. Miso soup is miso soup, but the mini cucumber pickles, string beans encrusted with nuts, and salad with dark greens and some sort of yuzu, nut and sugar dressing were perfect, no small element fell by the wayside. I tried some of the sushi, which left me uninspired. I've had way better, at a better price point. Tried both desserts on offer, the shiro choko had potential, but the passion fruit yuzu sorbet was way to sour, even mixed with the creme it was unpalatable. The other dessert however, the Azuki Hana, with the sake fruit jelly and yogurt parfait was as tasty as it was pretty- that is to say very. I had two drinks - the sukotto, with its two blended whiskey's had an incredible smokiness, and the morimatcha, which paired everything one thinks of when one thinks Japanese, calpico, sake, and match with vodka and lemon, and was good.

The restaurant has a modern design and decor, with an open kitchen so you can watch chefs prepare cuts of sashimi and other dishes. They have a great selection of wines and sakes here, including a really nice slightly sweet sparkling sake that is excellent served chilled. My favorite dish here was the Spicy King Crab. The presentation  of this dish is great and the taste was amazing. It is well worth the price. I also had a Spicy Tuna maki (roll). This was a disappointment because it really wasn't any better than what you would get at any decent sushi place. For a main dish, I enjoyed the Ishi Yaki Buri Bop, which is a dish where they cook the yellowtail on a hot bowl/stone tableside and it is served over rice and some vegetables. It was very good. Overall, a great restaurant that is worth eating at when you're in New York City, though give yourself a few hours because the service can be a little on the slow side, especially if you have multiple courses which is the way to go here.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Server equally attentive, a bit anxious though to insure that we'd upgraded to appetizers, dissapointed that dessert wasn't wanted. You know the type, a good waiter who has been told to pad the ticket. The food was very good. About right price for premium sushi. Appetizer special of soft shell crab wasn't great.

I won't go into detail on each course suffice it to say, they were all wonderful. Our server Rebecca and wait staff were on top of their game adding to the great experience. The dishes were constructed with the finest ingredients and meticulous technique. I had the wine/sake paring with the meal and each drink nicely complimented the dish with which it was served. The price is not for the faint of heart but it is food art and imho worth the price for the unique visual, flavor and textural experience. The dishes included several types of raw seafood such as toro tartare, abalone, skip jack, shad, trout roe, fatty tuna, also Kobe beef, main lobster and several other delights.

The courses on the tasting menu is chosen by the chef, and the chef chooses what is the freshest available at the restaurant. The whole tasting menu took about 2 hours, make sure you remember that and schedule things accordingly. We also added a bottle of warm sake to go with the tasting. We started off with a cold appetizer, the toro tartare in an ice bath. This has to be my favorite thing from Morimoto! I love the concentrated soy sauce, and the fresh wasabi. You scoop the fresh toro with a tiny spoon they give you. Next was the salad, which was the summer vegetable with dashi-soy beurre cheese fondue. The vegetables are all different and unique, some I have never tasted before, like the little watermelon looking vegetable. Next came the oysters with uni on a bed of salt. Then, the 5 pieces of sushi which consisted of fatty tuna, medium fatty tuna and tuna. Each fresh fish melted in our mouth. Then we had one wagyu beef carpaccio and a spicy king crab plate.

The sushi we had was some of the best I have had in NYC, granted I haven't tried that many places yet. The three stars is for a combination of the food being overpriced for the quality and the poor table service. Our waiter sort of forgot about us at one point and try as I may, I couldn't get his attention. He also was not knowledgeable about the menu, which is something you should expect from a place this upscale. I will note that you should stay away from the house crafted Sake, as they were all off the mark. Their cocktails however were spot on!Another thing to note is that most of the food we got was good, but very salty. My wife even had to skip eating the kakuni because of that. The deserts too were overly sweet and although the fiery chocolate was entertaining, it was wayyy to sweet and didn't have much depth of flavor.I would probably come back during restaurant week's lunch menu as the price would be limited to $29, but the normal menu is just too pricey.

Why the 3 stars.  The drinks were really terrible and I wasn't particularly fond of the dishes.  However, I would come back with friends/bf to try the sushi and sashimi.  ---------------------------------------Coat check is next to the entrance (not mandatory). Be aware that the seats are very low at the bar, so it might be easier to check in your coat.  Seats are nice and wide at the dining area and will be able to support a large winter coat. Service was amazing. There were several waiters assigned to our group.  As soon as  someone left their chair, someone would come by to fold the napkin. Always made sure we had enough water and drinks.  They checked for food allergies before the meal.  They make sure to place the non seafood dishes near the people with seafood allergies and near those who do not eat seafood. Cocktails - I would skip them.  I've had better.White lily cocktail - It looked amazing, but was a disappointment. I love yuzu, but the amount of sugar in the drink overpowered all of the flavors.  I was expecting something light and refreshing.Hydrangea cocktail - same case as the white lily, way too sweet.Sesame blossom cocktail - my friend and I both did not like it.  At first it was good - raspberry flavored, but the aftertaste of the sesame was not good.  It lingered in my month and tasted like cooking oil.  Morimoto ice tea (non alcoholic)- This was very good.  The calpico and crushed blueberries really made this ice tea different then others.  And....it wasn't overloaded with sugar! Appetizers - ehhhCrispy rock shrimp - essentially pebble sized shrimp.  It was ok.  They were lightly seasoned. Wagyu beef tartare - the non seafood lovers really like this.  I personally prefer raw fish to (semi) raw beef.  I just really didn't like the texture of the beef.  The black rice crisp on the other hand was very good.  Appearance wise, it looked like seaweed.Calamari salad - essentially salad placed on top of fried calamari.  Exactly what you would expect it to taste like.  Some of the girls at my table really liked the salad and the light miso salad dressing. Entrée - all cooked entrées.Sea bass - very good and buttery.  A little too much salt for my taste, but everyone else enjoyed it.  Avocado tempura was good.Angry chicken - essentially tempura fried boneless chicken.  This was ok, the chicken wasn't dried out.  The crispy layer was light.  The yogurt sauce complimented the chicken very well. 12oz prime aged New York strip- Sorry I didn't get a better picture as it eaten up quickly.  Anyway this was the favorite of the group.  The steak was still sizzling when it was brought over to the table.  All six sides of the steak was charred to perfection.  It was medium rare, but not overly pink.  Bok Choy and pea shoots stir fried vegetables were okay - a little too much salt.Desserts - was okayCoconut mango blanc-mange (coconut matcha cream, lemon yogurt powder, mango soup - no one really liked this.  I didn't taste any coconut.  The matcha was bitter.  It was such a strange combo with the mango.  It came with a pound cake like bread stick.  There were bits of grapefruit in it, which was weird. Chilled cheesecake soufflé - everyone liked it.  The cheesecake was so light and airy.  It had a bit of lemon fragrant and wasn't overly sweet!  The wine sorbet complimented it very well.  I would totally come back and just order this.Soy latte - this was good.  The perfect bitter drink to cleanse my palette of all of the sugary drinks and salty food.

It is not an understatement when I say that I viewed your menu a month in advance and knew what I would be getting before even arriving to dinner. My party of three started with the toro tartare (but of course), the rock shrimp and a soft shell crab special. It's difficult to pick a favorite, everything was wonderful, but the toro was the first dish I tried and thus my first love. For entrees, the duck, duck, duck, sea bass and surf and turf were selected. I personally had the surf and turf, which consisted of a steak, a potato dish with tuna and yellowtail in an avocado mixture. If you need an example of what the pinnacle of culinary art is, look no further.  Yes, its expensive but it truly is well worth it.

We're huge fans of 15 East and BondSt for this kind of meal but we wanted to try something new. Upon arrival we waited quite a while before our waiter took our drink order. Overall the food was very good. The salad was fantastic. The sashimi appetizer was good but not great.  The Seabass tasted great and was big enough to share. The sushi was just average, good cuts of fish over tasteless rice. The price per piece is the same as Sushi Yasuda or 15 East so coming here for sushi is literally a waste of time. The ramen noodle soup was disappointing - it tasted fine but was very similar to Campbell's chicken noodle soup.   For dessert we had the fiery chocolate tart which was pretty good and was presented nicely. The atmosphere is very nice and overall the food is good, but at this price level there are restaurants that are just better in every way.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We booked the place through open table around 12pm and was seated by the sushi bar. We both tried the 10pc sashimi entree ($29 restaurant week price) -- which came with a chef's selection of fish, a miso soup, a bowl of rice, and a small salad. The salad was refreshing with a bit of citrus-y sauce. The miso soup was pretty good too, with nice chunks of tofu. I thought the sashimi was pretty decent but I was expecting something more fresh and delicious, especially for the infamous Morimoto restaurant. We also tried the Toro Tartare ($30) -- which came with 6 different condiments and soy sauce. This was the highlight of my meal. This was very tasty and is definitely worth trying outside of the restaurant week menu. As far as the dessert -- We tried both the Chocolate Fondant & Pot De Cream. Both delicious in different ways. The chocolate fondant was very moist on the inside, which was great. The Pot De Cream was great with an interesting passionfruit caramel syrup.  The service was pretty decent but what I found kind of odd was the fact that the person who brought out the sashimi didn't explain which fish was which. When I ask the person to find out for me -- the waiter promised to return but never did. PRETTY disappointing especially for a famous sushi bar like Morimoto. But overall, it's definitely worth a try especially during restaurant week lunch.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I have to.My coworkers brought me to lunch and the prices were pretty reasonable for a nice lunch, ranging from $15-$35 ish for a dish (appetizers are each at this price too). Their steaks are available too but much more expensive. It's a Monday so the restaurant was practically empty for lunch. The decor of the place is stunning. I have no words to describe it and the photos don't do it justice. It's worth it to just sit here omg. I was too shy to take photos while with my coworkers, but we ordered the scallop sashimi appetizer, the wagyu tartar, the spicy crab, and the pork gyoza to share. I'm pretty sure they made sure to serve just enough pieces for us. The scallop sashimi is served buried under an assortment of vegetables and roe. The wagyu tartar is served with crackers and a Japanese brioche that perfectly buttery. If I could just eat the brioche for the rest of my life, I would die of happiness. The spicy crab was nothing too special but it was yummy. And to my surprise, the gyoza was very good! It's served upside down with a thin circular layer of dough that connects all of the gyozas. The sauce the dumplings lay in is a mixture of flavors I don't quite know how to explain. So if you're thinking about getting the gyoza but not sure if it will be too plain, don't worry. It's definitely special :) For the main course, my party ordered the lunch set skirt steaks, katsu don, and I had the sushi lunch. My sushi came with 5 pieces of nigiri, one roll, green beans, pickled cucumbers, miso soup, and a small salad. I enjoyed it but it is definitely not the freshest fish I've ever had. And the roll was something quite plain. For the price and lunch experience, I think I would recommend ordering the cooked/hot lunch sets as my sushi lunch was a similar price to the steak or seared fish sets.Next time I want to come for dinner and get more appetizers or maybe I'll treat myself and come for the omakase :3",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We started with scallop carpaccio - really unique and great depth of flavors, toro tartar - toro was great quality but dish itself was plain similar to other restaurants, beef carpaccio - everyone said it was delicious but I don't eat and yu burrata which everyone loved too but I didn't have it was a tofu skin stuff with ricotta and cream in a truffle sauce with grilled sourdough. We got the sea bass as a main this was probably the most delicious fish dish I've ever had - get it!! The miso cod was good too. Others had the duck which was unique and prepared two ways with a variety of sauces and a fried egg. Then we had sushi the spicy yellowtail - favorite so good! Spicy tuna was good, salmon roll and soft shell crab tempura roll. For dessert I had coconut green tea sorbet which was delicious as a lactose free gluten free option! Service: 1 star! I am hoping this was a fluke because I wouldn't expect service like this at a McDonalds. I had to ask the waiter to explain the menu, we had to ask to order, he told us he would come back to follow up on sushi - never did had to ask him again for another menu. Our dishes weren't cleared. We waited 10 minutes before we had to ask a bus boy to clear the plates. It was honestly a joke. They replaced everyone's plates and didn't replace my boyfriends. Had to flag the hostess down to order dessert. Finally we had to say something. The service was horrendously appalling.

I had high expectations going in, and they weren't really met because I've had better quality fish at other Japanese restaurants. This felt more like one of those sushi restaurants to stuff your belly with cheap sushi rolls. Favorites:- Toro Tarare was a beautiful dish and the tuna tasted delicious.- Duck tasted so amazing and the croissant bread was very flakey and buttery. - Green Tea Crepe Cake was so beautiful, soft, and delicious. I'm a huge green tea lover, and this definitely still had the matcha taste to it. I think they could of added a bit more chocolate drizzle to sweeten it up a bit. Ambiance:- I thought morimoto would be a quiet sushi restaurant that was very upscale, however I was very surprised at how lively and loud it was inside. - The restaurant is definitely beautiful and spacious, and they have a cool light wall and automated Japanese toilets. I also liked how sections of the restaurant were separated with glass so that it still felt a bit intimate with your party.

The Morimoto Style Bagna Cauda took a while to get the hang of it (the roasted garlic-anchovy fondue is stronger, i.e., saltier than initially expected, so it's easy to overdo it), but once I did it was fun trying it with the different seafood and vegetables. The Sashimi Combo contained very fresh fish, and the standard variety of them, plus the unique addition of baby shrimp, which tasted light and a little sweet. I tried the baby shrimp for the first time, and I definitely don't want it to be the last - every restaurant should include them as a sashimi special staple.

BUT I have to say the two off menu items, the eel and avocado rolls were to die for - fresh and tender and delicious, and the toro tartare was unlike anything I had ever had - and so incredibly delicate and tasty that I might even consider going back and spending $30 on an appetizer. For entrees, my cousin got the burger (very good), the angry chicken (uninteresting to me), and the miso cod (tender and yummy). All 3 came with miso, salad, pickles, and string beans. My cod entree was a kind of miserly amount, but luckily we had ordered other things too. And it came with beans (3 of them, count 'em), and I thought it was hilarious that they even pointed that out, and mentioned the pickled bell peppers which I kid you not consisted of 3 sim-card sized squares of red, yellow, and orange bell peppers. If you had blinked you'd have missed them. I loved the seating - with these semi translucent panels between tables that made it feel private and loungey, and the service was very friendly.

The duck was SO tender. We both wished we had enough room to finish the dish! The non-alcoholic cocktails: morimoto iced tea and virgin white lily were delicious. The iced tea with the muddled blueberries was very refreshing (we ordered 1 more after finishing), and the white lily was a little too acidic for my dining partner (but I liked it much more than the iced tea).

Many restaurants have been fully booked for the week but I'm lucky enough to book the last table for Morimoto.My friend got the angry bird...i mean angry chicken. First impression, crispy with a little burnt smell. It is better when eaten with the sauce.I actually wanted to get the black cod, but I assumed I will be hungry cause I saw how small its portion was. So instead, I got the dry aged burger, cooked medium rare.  As you can see from the picture, the burger was cooked nicely. What surprised me was the fact that parts of it tasted like foie gras, which was not something you would expect here. Perhaps it's the cheese and the shiitakes combination (not your regular cheese and shiitakes preparation). Pity that it's not as juicy as what I expected. Nonetheless, still a good memorable dish. Burger comes with the chips though it's a little burnt for my liking. Each dishes comes with a set of miso soup, suribachi sesame mixed greens salad, and cucumber pickles. My friend commented one of the dishes tasted like the Indonesian 'gado gado'. For dessert, there's only 2 options. Panna cotta is nice and delicate. Tasted just nice and not too sour. I got the fondant which looked like an inverted cupcake. It's pretty dry so, the orange sherbet and cream was a nice touch.Overall, not too perfect, not too shabby. My friend prefers the angry chicken but I prefer my burger. My previous omakase experience here at Morimoto still prevails, but hey, can't complain for a $25 lunch.

It's a play on Peking duck, which is turned into a croissant duck sandwich. I couldn't taste much foie in the croissant, and the roast duck had none of that crispy yet succulent duck skin that you can only find in Beijing.

I had been to the Morimoto in Philadelphia a couple times and always left impressed with everything. I make sure not to order the same things when I visit, because the menu is so inventive and full of unique dishes. I've done the omakase tastings a couple times, and it never fails to wow me. There are a lot of different types of raw sushi out there, and I can't even begin to describe how well they slice and prepare the various fish and crustaceans here. I considered myself pretty knowledgeable about sushi and sashimi, but my visits to Morimoto proved me dead wrong.The most notable dishes in my mind are the toro tartare and the seafood tobanyaki. The toro tartare already has immense flavor by itself, but with all of the accompanying caviar, sauces and rice cracker crumbles, the flavor and texture profile is amped up even more. Not to mention, it's also a very good-looking dish. The seafood tobanyaki is basically like eating hot pot with all sorts of delicious seafood, in a miso broth. The green tea matcha mille crepe cake is also one of my favorite desserts, ever. I don't have much of a sweet tooth myself, but it's a great mix of rich, sweet but not too sweet, and moist all at the same time.I've yet to actually see Chef Morimoto during any of my visits, but hopefully I'll run into him one of these days.

Our request for extra lemons and extra ginger were handled promptly. We did not have a reservation but because we dined at 5:30 PM it was not a problem. The fish was fresh, flavorable and moistly delicate...just like you would expect it melted in your mouth.  I would definitely go back as they had a huge menu.  I believe we sampled the little neck clams and sushi and yellowtail.  All were perfect!

The dessert appears to be only for restaurant week. We also had a separate spicy salmon roll for an appetizer.Plenty of food. My favorite was the burger which was really tasty. It also came with sweet potato chips which I enjoyed. The sashimi was pretty good. Desserts really stood out which surprised me.

We ordered the rock shrimp which was crunchy and creamy, toro tartare which words don't do justice explaining, and the bagna cauda which was an anchovie fondue, not my favorite but everyone enjoyed it. For our main courses ranked in order of popularity, we had the surf and turf, beef sukiyaki,sea bass, king salmon, ishi yaki buri bop, and seafood 'toban yaki'. All of the dishes were delicious and each had its unique umami flavor. Although I wish the beef sukiyaki had slightly more noodles, those noodles with the soup was yummy. Also you can't go to Morimoto without trying the bathroom. Tried it and loved it. I didn't have to use the toilet but I walked in just to experience the endless mirrors and flush the toilet.

We arrived at 8:00 PM on Friday evening and left around 11:30 PM. During the entire time the restaurant was comfortably full and energetic and showed no signs of slowing down as we left. The energy was great, yet there was not an issue with noise or feeling crowded.The staff were great and extremely knowledgeable. The food came out at a nice pace, the presentation was terrific and the portions were generous. All this at a cost that I though was very reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber. So everything we ordered was terrific, but some of the standouts included: the uni and ikura, the udon trio, the ishi yaki buri bop (yellow tail tuna), brussel sprouts and of course the dessert. Ok so I think that that may be everything that we ordered. As I said it was all terrific!  So if I have to highlight a couple of things it would be: 1- the Uni, served with wonderfully plump caviar in a very tasty broth; 2- the Udon noodles. Definitely the simplest dish that we had, but so tasty. There different types of cold noodles served with a traditional dipping sauce. I know that this sounds a bit boring, but it was really terrific; and 3- the the milk chocolate key-lime pie.

Our waiter was nice. The food is pretty pricey with appetizers in the $20-$40s range. They also offer an omakase for $125/person for 8 courses. My husband and I were considering it but after hearing the options of the 8 courses, we decided to order off the menu. In the end our tab ended up more expensive than if we were both to order the omakase. My husband and I started with the tuna tartare.. I love the presentation! It's like a painting pallet! This cost close to $40...and it wasn't a lot of food. Miso soup was around $10 but it came in a big bowl. We also ordered the Morimoto sashimi which was decent. For main course, we ordered the seafood tobinyaki which was a lot of seafood (crab, lobster, scallop, squid, shrimp on top of a red broth), sashimi pieces (fatty tuna, uni, yellowtail), lobster roll, and grilled asparagus and kamp. They were all delicious. My husband really like the seafood tobinyaki..while I really enjoyed the sushi and asparagus, We ended the night with the seasonal trio sorbet and matcha tiramisu.

The crispy rock shrimp tempura was also very good. The Duck Duck Duck was decent. They gave us their Yosedofu complimentary which was my favorite dish of the evening. In terms of the drinks, the Morimotini was not as good as I had expected and switched to wine after the first glass. For a restaurant of its standing, the service could have been better.

I' m not a sushi connoisseur but I would say my friend and I have a fair amount of knowledge when it comes to raw fish. My friend and I ordered some sushi and sashimi, trying our very best not to go crazy over the menu. I enjoyed my selection of fish but I did not find it outstanding. Fish was fresh but not the finest. I had very high expectations because I was told Chef Morimoto serves some of the finest sushi in NYC. My friend did not enjoy or finish their selection of fish.

Second course:  kingfish sashimi with hot blended oil citrus soy scallion oil (myoga) and ginger paired with saichiken shochu.  Each bite melted in my mouth.Third course omakase with madai butterfish and and mortadella vinagrette oil.  It was served with Chablis which cut through the fish and oil really well.Fourth course, chawanmushi soy dashi custard with dried eel on top, pipette has eel sauce with Wente chardonnay (very rich and smooth).Accidental fifth course, tempura rock shrimp with wasabi aioli, gochujang aioli and house ranch with celery sticks.  It also had a pineapple ginger juice cleanse with a gold leaf for palate cleansing.  It had the right amount of crunch and flavor without being too spicy.Sixth course, big eye golden snapper, chutoro, saba, hamachi and mirugai (giant clam) nigiri with daijinjo sake.Seventh dish, serpentine dish with grilled wagyu beef, Japanese yams and lobster masala and lemon with creme fraiche matched with Etude white wine with violet notes.Eighth course, green tea tiramisu with sour cherry gelato with a sparkling cherry blossom nigori sake.Ninth course, white chocolate matcha green tea mochi.  It was so creamy and the mochi rice skin was tender and chewy.  Excellent!!I loved every bite!!  Definitely would visit here again on my next NYC visit.Even the ambience is very upscale with modern furniture and mood color lighting.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The waiters did not seem to be knowledgeable of their own menu and were not attentive at all to their customers, other than walking around and refilling water, there was no quality check in place to ensure customer satisfaction.Pricing and Quantity - 0/2 StarsPricing is awful. Other than the restaurant week menu, nothing else on the menu was remotely acceptable. The pricing wasn't acceptable due to the quantity of food received for such price. I paid 24$ for a single piece of Fatty Tuna sashimi and 12$ for a single piece of Yellow-Tail. That to me, especially when it's not established on the menu nor by the waiters/waitresses is unacceptable. Quality - 1/2 StarsThe food was overly salted. Their salad was unbearable, for someone such as I with a high tolerance to salt palate, I was literally choking. Their green beans were slightly better but not by much. The miso soup was so awful I had to pass it to my girlfriend to finish, and she had to force it down. We had the sashimi combo and the dry age burger. The burger was awful, it was pretty much a 2x2x2 slab of meat to mess with you, and the sashimi combo was a single roll (6piece) with 4 pieces of sashimi. the sushi rice was terribly undercooked and to counter act the failure to produce proper rice, they added a ton of rice vinegar and it completely downed the taste of the fish. The fish on the other hand wasn't even that great. Paying 24$ for a single piece of fatty tuna and that tuna was nothing special. It was just fresh, that was it. For such a high priced menu (everything was more than 25$ pretty much) you'd expect the quality to be better, NOPE! They spent all their hard earned cash to create a water bottle art wall and a RGB (red green blue) bar downstairs with transparent bar stools and sliding bathroom doors like we're in the future.Total Stars - 1/5Definitely would not recommend to ever visit.

The service was good. The waiter explained everything and obviously recommend the more popular and expensive dishes. I was in the mood for something hot and soupy.

Plain and the noodle was soaking up all the broth.  I guess I should have went to his new restaurant for ramen instead. The bone marrow was sour??? I'm not sure if they put too much favor in it or what it is.  The sushi was just regular,  I could have gotten it for a better price somewhere else. One girl ordered the morimoto style bagna cauda which was really good.  A hint of garlic but not overwhelming.  This was the best dish in my opinion (actually this is an app).

I asked for a private area and booth and I told them I will be celebrating my engagement that night at their restaurant. They placed me at a table that was crammed with other tables and people. It was very noisy (chatter and club music). I felt like I was yelling across the table to talk to my fiancee. We had a wonderful server. She let us move to a booth, which was what I originally requested. We were much more comfortable. I ordered the spicy salmon and shrimp tempura maki. The maki order was just a little better than any small sushi place that I order from Ohio. I also ordered the rock shrimp appetizer and the seafood toban yaki entree, which was pretty good. The lobster in the toban yaki was phenomenal. The worst part is that although the restaurant called me to confirm the seating for my reservation and my idea of having a small surprise desert to celebrate my engagement. They completely forgot both of those! I was very disappointed. We will not be returning.

However, because it was my boyfriend's birthday and we were in the mood for Japanese, I decided to try this place out. It definitely helped seeing how it has such great reviews on Yelp.And, the chef is the Iron Chef guy. Cool!!!!!As soon as I walk in the restaurant, I was instantly amazed by the decor. Everything looks so FANCY AND NICE AND PRETTY!! The host offered me coat check and immediately sat me at my table. Definitely make a reservation for this place - it gets packed. First off, the waiter was extremely attentive. He also had a suprisingly soothing voice, one you would think would suit for narrating a children's book. After I let him know that it was my first time there, he made suggestions on how much food I should get and which sushi I should try.For appetizers, I got the toro tartare (I'd say this is the restaurant's most popular appetizer) and the roasted bone marrow. Both were AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! The toro tartare comes in a very unique ...way..to say it simply. It comes on an ipad looking clear dish (see my photo for reference) on top of a bowl of ice. It also comes with a couple of different ""sauces"" to dip the tartare in (in addition to soy sauce) - some guac thing, fresh wasabi, sour cream, and more (to be honest, I don't know what the other sauces were, but they were really good). The roasted bone marrow was also soooooo delicious. I'm a huge fan of bone marrow, and it comes with freshly toasted bread. The bone marrow is topped with some...circular jelly thing, which I still don't know what it is. Half the time I was eating in Morimoto, I was wondering what I was eating..but in a good way!And the sushi. WOW. I'm used to eating sushi at buffets, but this tops it all. It feels like it literally is melting in your mouth. Everything is so fresh. The restaurant also has exotic sushi - I got the cherry salmon and fire squid. Keep in mind- each PIECE is 7-11 bucks, but it's worth trying a few.My date each got 2 exotic pieces to try, and we shared the chef's selection on the typical sushi - salmon, tuna, eel, etc. This costs about $45-$50. You can either pick sushi or sashimi and can pay more for more sushi. To top it off, we each got a dessert. Each dessert costs about $12. My date got the banana cream puffs (with the waiter's recommendation). HOOOOOOOOOOLY MOLY! I'm usually whatever about cream puffs, but this is no ordinary dish. It comes with ice cream on the side and glazed nuts.....Omg. And plantains. Omg. Omg. My taste buds will never be the same. Also, because I noted to the restaurant that it was my date's birthday, they added a candle and a ""Happy Birthday"" chocolate to the dessert. What a pleasant suprise :)I got the matcha tiramisu. It comes with cherry pieces and ice cream. This was very good too - it was extremely fluffy with a strong, but fitting, cherry taste at random times. Although both desserts were good, if I had to choose one, I'd go with the banana cream puffs.Lastly, GO TO THE BATHROOM!!!!!!  (The downstairs one) It's a very bugging out experience. Each stall has a reflection on a reflection on a reflection..You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it yourself. DON""T FORGET TO CHECK OUT THE BATHROOM!The bill came out to a little over $200 (with tip) for the two of us. It was definitely more than what I'm used to paying for, but it was still an excellent experience.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

As she had already warned me to not have my hopes up too high about it, I wasn't too let down. It fared just to be alright and for the price...definitely a no-go for me again. Everything else that we had was tasteful, but once again nothing extremely out of the ordinary for me to want to say I'd go back to this place for other than the interior design and the presentation of the food.I would come here just to say that I have and try a few things; but I probably wouldn't come back considering the price range and that the food was average.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We opted to sit at the bar so we can maybe interact with the chefs - but I've never seen such emo sushi chefs in my life. I wasn't expecting loud and rambunctious Hibachi chefs throwing scraps for me to catch with my mouth or anything. But maybe a ""HI"" welcome to Morimoto would have suffice? No, they look stern, straight face, it was impossible to even nod at them. So, we ordered the White Lily, which was an amazing cocktail which consisted of yuzu citrus juice and shochu (Japanese beer??). It was damn good. Nice and light. The best experience was the toro tartare. It comes in this huge bowl filled with ice, a small tray of the toro, some spears, and about 6 variety of sauces and a side of sweet soy to dip in. The toro was also garnished with caviar. I was beside myself, it was absolutely delicious. I also ordered the Beef Sukiyaki. I hate to admit that it wasn't the best sukiyaki I've had. I love the par boiled egg to dipped in but the sukiyaki was too sweet and salty. They didn't have enough beef, noodles or vegetables for $38. I expected more with flavors and portions. The bathroom is so cool. I like that it's own individual stall, the wall looks like a never ending hallway... someone can seriously get trippy up in there. The high tech toilet was ridiculous. I know it's TMI, but seriously... when I pressed front, the water came out the back. I was not expecting that.

I added my own spicy sauce: which I would have preferred the chef to do. At any rate the fish was fresh and it really isn't any better than the local neighborhood sushi spot. I rate them 1 for stupidity and 3 for food quality. My first glass of water was warm- the refill was cold.  If I could have a do over I would probably rate it higher, if I could convince them to make the rolls my way without being told no.

I was sadly disappointed. The food was not worth the money. We ordered the shisito peppers (a seasonal special), wagyu beef skewers, and chicken ramen for appetizers. The shisito peppers were underwhelming and not seasoned well. The wagyu skewers were very good, with a nice char taste, and the beef as tender as ever. When a dish is described as ""iron chef chicken noodle soup"" I would expect something pretty spectacular - it was not. It was just super salty broth, noodles, and 3, yes 3, little pieces of chicken. I ordered a sushi roll for my entree and my fiancé ordered the chicken roulade dish. My sushi roll was just a sushi roll, nothing special. The chicken roulade was probably the best dish out of everything; presented nicely with large slices of black truffle scattered throughout the dish. The service overall was not that great. We waited a good 40 min for our main course to come out and our waitress would disappear for 15/20 min at a time throughout the night.

We chose to sit at the sushi bar. While watching the sushi chefs preparing some beautiful looking plates I ordered my usual sushi rolls, tuna and California, so I had something to compare them to. We also ordered goyza as an appetizer. I balked at the $16 price but it was worth every penny. Never had goyza served on a bed of tomato based sauce. It was also served covered by what looked like an edible paper membrane. Don't know what it was but it was the best goyza I have ever tasted.When my order arrived it consisted of a miso soup, a small dish of tuna with seaweed, a salad and pickled cucumbers along with my rolls.The miso soup was the best ever, it had giant pieces of tofu in a broth that is out of this world. I have had the tuna with seaweed and pickled cucumbers before at Micky's Place in Queens and Morimoto's are just as good.The tuna roll was made from giant slices of tuna, some places use chopped tuna but not here. The California roll was made with real crab meat not the artificial stuff that's used everywhere else. Yes, these rolls were also some of the best I ever had.My only disappointment was the $3.00 charge for green tea.

The interior of the restaurant was beautiful, and the service was one of a kind. We got a couple things from the normal lunch menu: wagyu beef tartare, mackerel sushi, and a piece of uni sushi. Our RW courses were: sushi set and angry chicken. The desserts were: mixed berry panna cotta and lava cake with sake sorbet. The tartare was so fresh and delicious. The black sesame crisps on the side was so good. I don't know what kinda magic they're cooking with, but I support it fully.The angry chicken was good, and the portion was HUUUUUUUUUGE. I actually struggled to finish my lunch. My boyfriend's sushi tasted really fresh. The single pieces of sushi were also incredibly fresh as well. A little expensive but worth it. The panna cotta tasted like a standard panna cotta, so you know that's awesome. The cake with the sake sorbet on the other hand.... OUT OF THIS WORLD. I want to constantly be eating that sorbet. I don't even like sake, but the sweet mellow rice flavor made frozen and so delicate is something I'll never stop craving.

I was fortunate to come here on two occasions, because the first time I came here, I got the grilled chicken as my entree. I was a newbie foodie at the time, so ordering poultry at a famous seafood restaurant was a rookie mistake on my end (I mean, it was yummy, but I hate myself for not getting a fish-based dish!).

Our waitress was nice, although we didn't see her as much after we placed our order. The food was surprisingly just A-OK. We got sushi, we didn't get the tasting menu, which I'm sure is amazing and most people will order that. Instead we ordered the spicy salmon, spicy tuna, cucumber roll, sweet gourd roll and a regular tuna maki. As an appetizer we got the edamame, which hands down, was the best I've ever had. They were warm and had flakes of salt on it. Even the soy sauce was amazing! We didn't even finish the edamame and the entrees came out. I got a different sushi roll than what I ordered so they gave it to me for for free and made me a new one. My friend was not a fan of the sweet gourd sushi. We all tried it and we had to agree, it wasn't sweet at all. It literally tasted like a rolled up piece of ginger. I think she was expecting something like a sweet potato?

As expected, the food was unique and interesting but also amazing. We got the omakase, which I believe was 8 courses (2 dessert). One complaint - it's a little annoying that the entire table has to get the omakase or no one can do it. When it's a group of 10 and it's a very expensive choice, that's a tough sell. I'd recommend making sure everyone is in for that before going.For the omakase, it was nice that they asked beforehand if anyone had food concerns. I asked for nothing to be spicy, and they did a good job delivering on that change for all of the meal aside from the sushi (they left the wasabi on it and my eyes were literally watering). Another friend couldn't have any raw fish, so they changed all of the portions to only have cooked food, which was very nice to see they'd edit the entire omakase menu for someone.Favorite dishes: oyster foie gras appetizer, lobster tail and wagyu beef dish, sashimi, salad with quail egg, and this molten chocolate-type cake that was unbelievable.

I think they knew I like it that way- Iron Chef Ramen Soup - This was for SJ who wanted this. We did try the soup base and it was good. The funny thing about this is that the noodles is not Ramen...it's more rice noodle for PHO but without the PHO broth. so it was an interesting mix. At least the broth was good and my husband enjoyed it. That's all that matters. He even said it taste better than my PHO! so good job CHEF- Lobster Katsu Roll - Cabbage, pickled red ginger, Tonkatsu Sauce. My husband loved this one the best and this is definitely out of his element. he usually doesn't eat this type of food. Another great job CHEF- Wagyu Beef Carpaccio - yuzu soy, ginger, sweet garlic AHHHHHHH this is AHHHHHmazing!. this was gone so quick we should have ordered another one of this.  For my sister in law who doesn't like to eat rare food, she even enjoyed it. And to my husband who doesn't eat beef also enjoyed it. The textured of this beef with the sauce turned out great. mouth watering.- Oyster Foie Gras - market oysters, foie gras, uni, teriyaki sauce this is my favorite dish of the night. This is cook so to anyone who doesn't eat raw you can eat this. This came in 3 pieces of oyster and I was only able to eat one...I need another dozen of this to be fulfilled. The uni went very well together. 2nds please- Sea Bass - this came with eggplant and it went well together. I enjoyed the fish but my sister didn't because she said it was sweet...but she also said most sea bass they always make it sweet. If you don't like sweet food, this is not for you. to me the fish was moist with great flavors.

The rice was undercooked and verging on crunchy. The fish was served way too warm. These are 2 very basic things for sushi!! Also, none of my fish was particularly tasty. The maki roll I had was good, but the nigiri was quite flavorless. My squid was very hard to chew and unpleasant.

However, the food is just not quite as high in quality as I suspected. I've dined at Morimoto twice with my bf and I think we've had most of the restaurant's best dishes and more. I'm sad I didn't review this the first time around but I know I've definitely tried the Duck Duck Duck (very yummy and crispy) and the Morimoto sashimi. This time we tried new things:Ramen Soup: Ironically my favorite part of the night. This bowl of soup noodles is big enough to share and we got this because my bf wanted something light. The broth is very good (lots of chicken flavor) and the noodles are cooked to perfection. More soup than noodles, hence Ramen Soup. Scallop Special: This was off-the-menu that night and it's scallops slightly seared with olive oil on the bottom and seasoning on top. Sounded great but I think it could've been better. I'd give this dish a 3.5Toro Tartare: Ahh the one everyone talks about. Don't get me wrong, it was very yummy but perhaps a bit overhyped. It's just tuna tartare (not that much) with a side of condiments you can eat with the tuna. I wouldn't suggest eating it without the condiments or else it'll taste like nothing. Tuna Maki (Sushi): Apparently a new addition to their menu that is a ""big hit"". Meh personally this wasn't impressive at all. Yes you have great fatty tuna on top but the rice wasn't complimentary at all. For the price tag, I assumed it to at least be closer to how other high class sushi restaurants have their rice (room temp and soft). The middle is also just an avocado sushi so I felt like I was eating a not-spicy-tuna roll. Mango (?) Soufflé: Forgot the dessert name but this was my FAVORITE!! It's huge. It comes with the soufflé with a side of wine ice cream and fruit. Ugh. Our meal was relatively light so this definitely filled us. I recommend Morimoto for those who want to impress someone with where they're eating (setting) but I personally recommend Soto (still dreaming about that uni cocktail).",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
312,wtLH3-fQfhIli8YVkHmRTA,Hang T.,4.0 star rating,"The trendiest restaurant I've ever been too. The decor is super nice! I would have my next birthday celebration here if I could. Service was excellent. Tip #1: Make sure you have reservations so you don't get stuck on the long table next to strangers. I could see some people asking to be moved from those seats from our table. Tip #2: Portion sizes are a lot bigger than you might think. Coming into this place, I thought it would probably have high prices for small amounts of food. Wrong! When the food came out, they engulfed our table. The miso soup was humongous and WAY too big for two people, but at least it was good. The shrimp tempura done two ways was also delicious and again too big for two people to finish. Tip #3: Order the Duck Duck Duck! I guess it's one of their most popular dishes. The duck was very tender and not greasy like those you would find at a typical Chinese restaurant. I loved that you had it done a few different ways with a selection of sauces provided. It is messy to eat though as the duck in the sandwich did fall to my plate a few times. Tip #4: Skip the ""A la carte"" sushi. I didn't try their sushi tasting menu. I'm sure it's amazing, but the rolls in the back of the menu were lackluster and boring. Not the best sushi I've had at all. Skip those plates and go with the sushi tasting menu instead if you're in the mood for something fishy.Prices are higher than other places ($20-$30), but you are paying for ambience and a good time, and it is Morimoto.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I am not a huge fan of tuna, but the way it was presented along with the sauces and caviar, complimented each other wonderfully. We then had the uni & ikura, oyster foie gras, miso glazed roasted bone marrow. The oyster foie gras and miso glazed roasted bone marrow were the highlight of our dinner. For our entree we got the duck, duck, duck, which was good overall but because I'm not particularly fond of the idea of croissant and duck paired together, it was my favorite.

Watching all the sushi chefs prepare the rolls/sushimi with such love makes you know that whatever you get is going to be amazing.For drink selection Mark chose an old fashioned and I had a Sesame Blossom - infused vodka, raspberry, ginger..To eat I first ordered a selection from the seasonal sushi bar men - Sweet Baby Shrimp which I had in sushimi form. Honestly at first it looked like I was about to eat baby termites or maggots not fully developed but as soon as I put it in my mouth I was blown away. Absolutely delicious!!! And actually it is sweet. Not in a sugary kind of way but just a sweet seafood selection. Mark opted for the barracuda which was torched.We also had shrimp tempura rolls which were phenomenal. The final order was the Oysters Foie Gras which I loved but, Mark was not a fan of the texture. Personally I love Foie Gras!!

Even baby eel which is something I haven't seen before. At $28 it's still too pricey for lunch though. They make it seem like a deal because of the sides but they aren't good. The salad is just plain leaves - barely even any dressing. Then you get some green beans with peanuts in them - did not like. I was excited for the side of pickles as I love Japanese pickles but these were not. This was more of a Korean side of spicy cucumber that reminded me of kimchee and I don't eat spicy food. The miso soup was blah. So anyway a bit of a rip off but I'd love to try their dinner sometime.

The atmosphere is fun and trendy as expected, and you will see quite a few teeny bopperish people (now I'm showing my age ha). Our waiter was friendly and knowledgable. We indicated we were open to eating everything, except that I do not really like eggplant. The tuna tartare is a standout dish both for taste and presentation. You can scrape down the amount of fish you want to have with several different accompaniments below. You have to see the picture to understand what I mean. There was an interesting dashi broth with seaweed. The play on textures in this particular dish was fun- you had the chewy seaweed and some crunch too. Sashimi dish was fresh, obviously. I liked the Yuzu accent. The entree was a fancy surf and turf with lobster tail and Wagyu Kobe beef. We were really surprised by this- we thought either we would get the lobster or a beef but not both!Dessert was two fold with a little house made Popsicle and then more traditional mochi ice cream.

And right after we got out drinks they told us our table was ready. I mean come on, a drink I get at the bar is just one less I get at the dinner table, they're not fooling anyone. We got the Tartare sampler, spicy crab leg, surf and turf, miso soup, spicy tuna and salmon sushi. The spicy crab leg was the best - it was served in side the crab leg and brought to the table.

We also had the Yosedofu ($18)  (which I didn't think I would like as I'm not a big fan of tofu but this changed my mind) It comes in a covered steaming hot plate which you are not allowed to touch for several minutes. After it settles they prepare the dish with these little mushrooms, fresh wasabi and dashi soy. Wow those flavors exploded in  my mouth.  Really silky and smooth. For dinner I ordered the Seafood toban yaki ($40) which had lobster, king crab, mussel, clam, diver scallops in a red miso sake broth and my date had the braised black cod ($34)  in a ginger soy reduction.

The interior was incredibly classy and huge. It's a very large restaurant too, so less of that cosy intimate feel of some places. I've been to Chelsea market pretty frequently but had no idea Morimoto was hidden so close by! Service was meticulous but not excessive. I ordered the sushi & sashimi set as shown, which comes with desert as well - my friend and I shared the chocolate fondant and the raspberry sorbet desert. My friend loved her black miso cod - it was incredibly flaky and fresh! The sashimi and sushi were great, nothing to complain about, and I loved the salads and the crunch too. But it wasn't that phenomenal that I would come again for it, especially when I can get sushi and sashimi at that quality for a much cheaper price (hello sushi yasaka!).

The oyster foie gras was also decadent - although a little heavy handed on the teriyaki sauce as to mask the full flavor of the oyster or nice chunk of foie gras ontop. The carpaccio was also quite good. We also shared the sushi sampler, which was also a delicious and had a wide variety of fresh fish. Ambiance: dark with modern decor.

We immediately asked to have our table moved.  This was not the type of table that screamed 'celebration'.  They moved us to the middle of the restaurant, with a full view of the sushi bar and beautiful décor.  There, that's better.Our server seemed to take little interest in our request for suggestions.  We ordered three starters to share (including the starter special), the large sushi-sashimi chef's choice selection, and two desserts.  Honestly, I struggle to remember what we ordered, just a couple of weeks ago. Nothing was particularly memorable.  The 'fusion' style dishes (rock shrimp, etc.) are things you could find at any mid-range sushi establishment in NYC (ie: Momoya).  The sushi and sashimi were not the freshest, most adventurous or intriguing selections I have encountered.  I enjoyed my meal at Bond Street about ten times more - the way the fish melted in your mouth - wowza.  I remember that meal, and it was over a year ago!   Our total bill (food, drinks, tax, tip) was a little over $600 for three people, and honestly, I feel robbed.  Happy to pay this much if the food is worth it, but it SOOO wasn't.And as for the bathrooms - yikes.  It looks like these were probably nice about five years ago, and that was probably the last time they were cleaned.  Two stalls were out of toilet paper completely (on a Friday night).  The reflective floral designs are pretty, but dingy and dirty with layers of dust and grime.  The seat does have all those whiz-bangy features, but I was afraid to use them, thinking if they haven't refilled the paper and cleaned the walls, I can't imagine the last time the toilet itself was cleaned.Overall, a big thumbs down.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Topped with a chimichurri and ikura, the bone marrow was tender with a bit of Spanish and Asian influences. It was deliciously savory without being too salty. The grilled sourdough went great with the bone marrow and was perfectly crunchy.+ BRAISED BLACK COD: The miso glaze on the fish was similar to the bone marrow, but the fish literally fell apart when we put our forks in it. I was so impressed by how well this fish was cooked!+ GREEN TEA TIRAMISU: I specifically asked for a special dessert for my boyfriend's birthday, and they added a classy touch to this dessert with a happy birthday chocolate rested on the plate. The tiramisu was unlike any green tea dessert I have ever had. It was topped with matcha powder and a whipped cream/mouse, but as you got further down to the bottom of the bowl, there was a green tea sponge cake with an ice-cream like center.

We started off with their sashimi Appetizer and 10 hours cooked pork belly with congee . Sashimi was visually very appetizing but the fishes were just average. My pork belly was very tender with little bit of fat but it's very sweet for my taste bud I normally finished my food but not that Pork belly .May be that's how it  suppose to be , I am not sure . My waitress recommended me the silver Cod for my main dish and it was sweet also. I just wished it wasn't so sweet. I asked for side of steamed rice to help the sweetness from the fish but it's didn't  help . My friend got Chirashi and it come with miso soup .

For appetizers, we got the Spicy King Crab and Toro Tartare. They were AMAZING. Highly, highly recommend getting either or both. To be honest, I actually didn't think I was going to like the Toro Tartare, but it really surprised me and we ended up practically inhaling it. One thing that I noticed and loved, though very small, was the wasabi. Unlike most Japanese restaurants, it was fresh and authentic. Appetizers get A+s.For entrees, I got the Ishi Yaki Buri Bop and my boyfriend got the Duck, Duck, Duck. We both felt that our dishes were good, but not amazing and rave-worthy. They brought the Ishi Yaki Buri Bop to the table and seared the Yellowtail pieces in front of us by using the heated stone bowl that it came in. The Yellowtail was incredibly soft and tender. The sauce in the buri bop was really good, but overall the dish didn't feel too special or worth $30. The Duck, Duck, Duck was good but would have been better without the croissant and served in the traditional way. The croissant got soggy and was sort of strange to begin with. We also got the Bahn Mi Maki Roll to share, which was the special of the day. It literally tasted like Bahn Mi. Definitely impressive and tasty. Probably my favorite of our entrees. Finally, dessert! We got the Tofu Cheesecake to share, which was really tasty. I'm not exactly sure why it's called Tofu Cheesecake (is it the presentation and texture? or is tofu actually an ingredient?), but it was really, really light and airy. It was good, but I would have liked a stronger cream cheese flavor to it. The sorbet that it came with was pretty good too considering I don't really like sorbets.Other things to note:+ There is coatcheck available+ The bathrooms have bidets with automatic toilet covers and heated toilet seats",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Hands down the worst restaurant experience I've ever had in my life. Came here last night 2/14 for Valentine's Day with my girlfriend. First off, the most important part, THE FOOD. The sushi is nothing special at all. I've been to a few high end sushi restaurants and this doesn't even come close to high end sushi. It was completely average and for the price you're paying, you don't deserve average here. If you want amazing sushi go to Sushi Yasuda. That is on a whole other level than this place. Not as nice of a place but food wise, it is the best sushi in New York.Second, the service. 9PM reservation which I booked 1 month ago. Had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. Sat down at 9:30PM in probably what was the worst table in the restaurant. We were put in a corner where the decor wasn't even close to being ok. It felt like a janitor's closet and mind you, me and my girlfriend are not ugly people. I'm 6'2 and she's 5'10 and models. I had to complain to the hostess to seat us someplace else and he finally obliged and sat us at a good table. Everything seemed good. The decor is beautiful, the table was great now. We ordered the food. Our waiter forgot to tell us that there is WASABI in every piece of sushi. My girlfriend hates Wasabi. This would have been great to know before we ordered and again I've been to high end sushi restaurants in New York before and not one place has done this. Again I had to fight the staff and talked to the manager who took back the sushi and took out the wasabi. They looked at us like we were dimwits who had no idea about good food or service but I take my girlfriend out to the best restaurants in the city and this was by far the worst one I've been too. I spent $200 for sushi that was just average, service that sucked, and an annoying, douchey, loud crowd filled with even more annoying loud music played on the speakers that were probably on the worst 100 list. 1 star is generous.

Comfortable seating if you'd like a table, and with the speciality being sushi, a full bar that you can sit at in order to eat and watch the chefs.Unfortunately, the one item I stopped there for was not available, being only on offer in the evening. Stained glass sushi, you may have seen it on Battle Asparagus on Iron Chef America... I will try it one day!That said, what we did order was amazing, we started with the Toro Tartar, which I had seen on The Best Thing I Ever Ate. Finely minced Toro Tuna, accompanied by several different garnishes to try it with. So good, definitely a must try.The starter was cleared away and our sushi selection was delivered.

We were welcomed by the friendly hostesses in the front where we were led to my requested sushi bar seats. This time though, I did notice a fishy odor as we sat by the bar whereas I did not noticed it the last time around. After a few minutes, it did not bother me anymore.The omakase cost $135 per person and it is really worth it in my opinion for just the experience alone. So much fun! Everything that came out were beautifully presented and our waiter would teach us how to eat each dish. I have never experienced so many different flavors and textures; I felt like a judge on Iron Chef! My favorite was the surf and turf course which consists of wagyu beef and lobster (whoa!) and the seared scallop (scrumptious!). The desserts were all amazing as well. Mm.. Yum. My least favorite were the raw sushis because they were a little boring, but nonetheless fresh and apparently flown in from Japan!About half way through our dinner, we were approached by one of the managers who asked us if we were able to slide a seat down since a couple requested to sit at the bar (we had an empty seat our right, and another to our left). I was ever so slightly turned off because I do not like being disturbed in the middle of my meal but it was really no biggie. We were later presented a complimentary dessert for moving which was very nice of them.We could not help but notice that all the hostesses, waiters, chefs, and managers were all very good looking.

We still enjoyed the entire meal (minus the dessert), but in hindsight, would've ordered a la carte and focus on sashimi and sushi dishes.  We did start off with a fresh and tasty tuna tartar variation that left a lasting impression on me, but besides that I felt the other selections for Omakase didn't wow me.  Back to the dessert - it was an extremely dense, caramel chocolate cake of some sort that couldn't be broken up by a stab of my fork.  I found it too sweet and am not a huge fan of caramel, so I was pretty disappointed.  They did leave us with some fresh mochi balls subsequently, which made up for it somehow, but I still would've liked my dessert to be satisfying.Besides the dessert, I thought our meal was great.  Moreover, all, and I mean ALL the staff were friendly and provided impeccable service.  I'd definitely return again just to try more sashimi.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I've had better.  It started off with the Tuna Tatare which was served in this little tray on an ice bowl.  Not bad, again just a tiny taste.  Then came some sushi salad, which was amazing actually, again, a tiny bit more of that would have been great.  The sea urchin was served in the shell but unfortunately, it was soooo little... like 3 spoons and it was gone..The entree was the wagyu beef and lobster, both amazing.  The beef was very tender.  Overall, the ambience and dining experience was good.  I wouldn't get the omakase next time though.To be honest, I was more impressed with their bathrooms than their food.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Overall, morimoto is for some reason overcompensating...for what, I don't know but it must be due to the pressure of winning a TV competition.Here is a summary: -Tuna tartare: overrated; as someone else reviewed without the condiments it would taste like nothing -Beef carpaccio: THE HIGHLIGHT of the meal. And the most simple. Very good.-Oysters: too rich, overdone. Oysters are great with a mignonette or just lemon juice. No need to add on with foie gras etc. it's really just best at its most simple.-Rock shrimp tempura: the second best dish we had. Crispy and flavorful.-Duck duck duck: overhyped and dry. Not the tender meat duck should be and the croissant was also overrated.-Lobster katsu roll: they were overcompensating with tons of katsu mayo. I couldn't even taste the lobster.

I wouldn't come here again since there are so many other great sushi restaurants in the city.Issues we had:- anything with sauce, was over-sauced and overpowered the actual food itemsFor example:1) Fried Oysters with Foie Gras and Uni - this could have been an amazing dish, but way too much sauce that made it way too sweet ... So much so we started scraping the sauce off... (you can see the extra sauce in my photos and while my single oyster shot looks great, I've had better in Los Angeles for less) 2) Australian Wagyu Beef - We loved the outside crust and the juicy tenderness of this meat, but as I mentioned Morimoto's chef over sauced this and made it WAY too salty! If I reordered this item I would request this medium rare (like we did) and have them hold the sauce... Other items we ordered and my quick thoughts:- Toro Tartare - great presentation and the accompanying flavors/toppings/sauces were unique and fun to eat (although would recommend just holding the tuna plate and scrapping it like that)... Also you must saveur the plum that comes on the side- Sushi - Fatty Tuna (good), Hamachi (good), Uni (decent), unagi (too dry which means over cooked) -- I was expecting ""fantastic"", but as much as I hate to say this given the Morimoto brand, I really think it could have been better!- banana cream puffs - delicious - sake - we ordered the second and third one from the bottom of the list and preferred the third from the bottom (it's also less expensive)Overall, for the price, we were expecting Morimoto's to be better than mediocre.

I went back last week for lunch during restaurant week, and it was great!  Our waitress was very friendly, offereing up recomondations, but wasn't too pushy or annoying at all.  Very nice, really liked her!  I started with the drink she had suggested, white lily.  It was like a martini, but not too strong with a citrus-y taste to it.  Even though the restaurant week menu looked like it would be plenty of food we decided to share a couple appetizers to start.  We got the rock shrimp tempura and it was amazing!  It came two ways, and one way was with a buffalo sauce and it was so good.  It might have given nobu a run for it's money!  We also got the tuna pizza.  It was interesting.  It was sort of like a wonton cracker crust with really fresh tuna on top with tomatos, lettuce, olives, onion, jalapeno and this white sauce that I don't know what it was, but it was good!  For my main I got the cold ramen.  The waitress told me I had made a good choice when I ordered it, and she was right.  It was really good.  The pork belly was good, and the flavor of everything all mixed together was perfect.  Each main dish also came with miso soup, salad, string beans in like a peanut sauce, and pickeled cucumbers, so there was no shortage of food.  Even though I probably didn't need it, I ate all of my dessert.  I got the black sesame profiteroles with strawberry sorbet.  So good!

The restaurant is beautiful! Trendy, modern, all white with a slight 80's feel (is that just me?) that was a nice change from all the modern + dark restaurants that are popular now a days. Music was loud but not obnoxious and there was a cool wall made of (drinking) glasses as a centerpiece.  To start, we had the famed toro tartare and the crispy rock shrimp tempura. The photos of the toro tartare are quite deceiving and it is much smaller in person. It was good but not great. Having been to Nakazawa, the fish just didn't taste as fresh. For $31, I expected better, what can I say. And it's not as fun to eat, kind of difficult actually. The rock shrimp was also good but not great. The portion was large and came with two different types of rock shrimp - one with a spicy kockujang sauce (not spicy) and a wasabi aioli sauce (hint of wasabi) and a ranch dipping sauce. Neither were must/need to order again appetizers in my opinion. For my main course I had the sea bass and it was DELICIOUS! It was everything a sea bass should be- BUTTERY, CREAMY, MELT IN YOUR MOUTH PERFECTION. It was so good my bf wished he ordered it too. I am salivating just thinking about it! The desserts photos on yelp seem to be old- they have changed most of them. We got the warm chocolate coulant, which was delicious! The gianduja (hazelut) ice cream was so good I wish they gave a larger scoop. The bathroom are great as another yelper (Peter D.) has mentioned. Loveee japanese toilets! The back drop was also so pretty I took a picture (lol).Oh and the service was great!! Perfect waiter- there when you need him and didn't linger or talk too much.

I never get sushi here since I don't really see this place as expert in that arena. The decor/ambience is always awesome but I really don't love the tightly spaced 2 seater tables. If you don't get an end seat, forget about having a ""private dinner."" People sitting next to us on both sides asked us questions and chatted for a bit- no complaints, but just saying- need a place to ""talk"" without anyone hearing what you have to say? Forget this place. Anyway, the bathroom is always a trip- love the endless window look. The toro tartare was perfect as it's always been- but go easy on the condiments box. I've seen people get sick after eating that on two different occasions. The scallop was great - sauce was very Asian-fusion. We were planning on going to a second dinner, so we got those two as apps and then had the seafood toban yaki. Comes out steamy on a nabe and it smells like seafood heaven- but eat it fast before it gets cold. Smells a bit fishy if you don't. They could also use a bit less salt- the extreme saltiness was a bit too much for me. I had three drinks by the time the night was over- starting out from the bar downstairs.

I went on a Monday night and had to push back the reservation 20 minutes, but they were super accommodating. When I got to the restaurant the staff was super friendly and also checked our coats. Our waitress was very attentive and I never felt rushed. We first ordered drinks (1 glass of wine + 1 lychee martini) and then checked out the appetizers.To start..Toro tartare (with caviar, sour cream, wasabi, dashi soy) - We ate this first. Not going to lie we were confused on how to eat this (lol) but the server was super friendly and explained the steps of spreading the caviar around the fish and then ""scooping"" the fish and dipping it. Fancy. This dish was so fresh you must order it. It's a little pricey because of the caviar but it's one of the staples at Morimoto.Kakuni (ten hour pork, congee, soy scallion jus) - This pork belly marinates for TEN hours and is so tender. It just pulls apart. I wasn't as big of a fan of the soy scallion but the meat itself was still so delicious. I would still recommend to order this because the taste and texture was just very unique.Crispy rock shrimp tempura (spicy gochujang sauce, wasabi aïoli) - This was the third dish brought out. Ahh rock shrimp is always a favorite dish of mine and this one comes with two dishes each with a different sauce! One was spicy (not that spicy at all though) and one was a wasabi. Both were dipped in a homemade Ranch type dressing. Uhh YUM. Yeah this was the fattening part of our meal but it's such a good dish to share - especially if there's a group of you. There were only 2 of us and we still had plenty of rock shrimp leftover.The meal.. We were pretty full from the apps + drinks that we stuck to ordering two rolls.Eel avocado roll  & Spicy tuna roll - Delicious sushi! These rolls didn't even taste like fish honestly. It was SO fresh. Tasted like a new level of sushi roll. I realize these are pretty basic sushi rolls but sometimes I would rather just eat a normal roll than anything that's fancy and huge.Dessert..Mochi balls - So these aren't actually on the menu, we had to ask for them because apparently they are only offered on one of the ""special"" menus (not sure how to get access to that???). So nice of the waitress though to go into the kitchen and find them for us. You can't eat sushi without mochi balls for dessert!The entire scene of Morimoto is really cool, too. It's very trendy. We made friends with the two girls having dinner next to us - even sang the one happy birthday! Haha! Yeah you sit close to your neighbor diners but it's fine.

399,Upi9IWb2BCYnHQZq2fvKSQ,Z Z.,4.0 star rating,"Came here for a group birthday party with the entire table doing omakase. I was late because the actual restaurant was a bit 'hidden' in that the sign was barely noticeable and the doors hid behind their thick red curtains that I couldn't even see what was behind it to know it was a restaurant.Overall, the ambiance was cozy and the atmosphere was a bit casual in terms of dress code. Service was a bit more hands off, with servers at the table pretty much only when they were bringing out the dishes. We ordered the oyster foie gras to start (separate of the omakase), and it was amazing. There are alot of uni lovers in the world, and I'm not one of them, but I have to say it tasted amazing here. This is a must try.Omakase: This review is a bit belated, so many details are already fading, but there are certain items, good and bad, that I remember very strongly, which I think can help shed some light on dishes worthwhile trying or skipping.- Toro Tartare: This was hands down my favorite dish of the night, followed by the oyster foie gras starter we had. This is another must try at Morimoto. Both presentation and composition was outstanding - the fish was very fresh, but it was definitely the accompanying 6 dipping sauces that made it so memorable and a differentiator from the other toro tartares I've had.- The next few courses were all fish centered, and I don't remember the type of fish that was served, only that they were very fresh and the flavor very simple, but complementary as to not overpower the original fish taste.- Surf & Turf: Lobster and wagyu beef - I was honestly not too impressed with this course mainly due to the wagyu beef. It was overcooked, making it a bit dry and very sinewy. The lobster was a bit too flavorful, which overpowered the 'fresh fish' taste - also felt like a lobster dish you can get at a chinese restaurant with the garlic/scallion sauce.- Chef's seasonal selection of sushi: The fish was fresh, but nothing very memorable. I did get a vegetable piece, which seemed like a bit of a waste. At a renowned japanese dining establishment, I would want to taste all the fish they had, not a piece of cucumber. One member of the table, who for health dietary concerns could not eat too much raw fish was essentially served a vegetable roll for this course. Seems like not much thought/flexibility was put into catering the omakase for occasions such as this. You don't serve someone whose paying $200+ a vegetable roll.- Dessert was okay, not great.Would revisit, but probably not do the omakase again if the quality of dishes we received is 'standard'. Instead, would order a la carte the dishes that we really enjoyed. For a place that's meant to be innovative and trendy in the way they approach japanese cuisine, think they need to work to integrate a bit more innovation into the omakase menu. 4 stars because the best dishes of the night were truly decadent even though the rest could use some work.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Sooo, I feel comfortable giving 4 stars even though I feel my experience was actually barely worth 3. The restaurant is breathtaking. One of the most beautiful places I have ever dined, without a doubt. Bravo to whoever drew that design up.I started my meal with a Sesame Blossom cocktail. It wasn't on the RW menu, but the others looked unappealing; one was a hot toddy and the other had elderflower. Neither are to my taste, so I opted to pay extra for something that appeared more fitting. Sesame infused Grey Goose just sounded too awesome to pass up, but the drink was disappointingly watered down and sour. Blah....Off the RW menu, I ordered the sashimi; chef's choice of 10 pieces with green salad, white rice, and pickled vegetables as the main, and green tea cream puffs to finish. The sashimi was of nice quality, but the pieces were very small, the rice was, well, rice, and the green salad and picked vegetables were nothing to write home about. Dessert was a little better. At least it looked like it was a product of one of the highest acclaimed Japanese chefs in America. This being said, had the the ""citrus salad"" not been included on the plate, the whole thing would have been a one note, matcha mess. :(It was probably a mistake visiting Morimoto for the first time during RW, but frankly, the place is just too darn pricey to go any other time.

Even if a restaurant, which was normally great had an off night, I always let it go. However, the experience I had at Morimoto last night was so terrible that here I am updating the review.I have been to Morimoto several times over the years and have always considered it be one of the best sushi restaurants in NY. That is why last night was so disappointing and frankly shocking.We came last night for Valentine's Day and ordered a bunch of items that we tried before. First, the Miso-glazed Marrow with Roe. The dish came with burnt bread that wasn't even warm. We told the waiter and he asked if they could make it again, but we politely asked that he not bring another order. Despite our request, the waiter came back ten minutes later with another order. His exact words were ""I practically made this order myself."" The bread was still burnt, but warm. The dish itself was poorly prepared. It comes with two bones and they did not even taste the same. The person who glazed it with miso forgot to glaze both. Also the roe they now use has a rigid skin and doesn't taste as good as the one they used previously.The next dish was Seared Scallops. For over $20, we received 2 small scallops that were cut in half. To top it off, they were over-cooked.The third dish was Oysters with Foie Gras. I've never seen less Foie added to a dish in my life. Even after eating it, I still wasn't even sure it was Foie in the first place. I've had this dish many times, and it was always perfect. Whoever was preparing the hot appetizers was clearly messing up every order.At this point, we considered leaving the restaurant and cancelling the rest of the food. But then we said to ourselves, well at least the fish is going to be great. We received the Chef's selection of seasonal sashimi. They were fresh but simply not good, sans one fish. Why the Chef would select this assortment is beyond me. The last dish that was brought were two pieces of salmon sashimi. Salmon is my favorite sashimi by far, and normally Morimoto's salmon is incredible. What arrived last night was beyond unacceptable. Bland and literally dry on the edges. You cannot serve this to customers if you run a sushi restaurant. That's probably why I've never in my life tasted a piece of sushi that was dry on the edges.Overall, I couldn't have been more disappointed. The food they brought out other than the Sashimi selection was shameful. A metric by which a great restaurant should be measured by is consistency and Morimoto came up a mile short.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

In fact, this was the ""go to"" for celebrating important events! ...Until I dined here on Valentine's Day. I hate to write this review but we had an absolutely terrible experience here.I couldn't believe how many things went wrong. It was almost comical... almost.The waiter kept insisting that I explain what is wrong with the food in detail! This makes me feel so awkward! Especially on Valentine's Day! Especially at a communal table!! Over and over he would ask and pry until I'd give in and tell him something.This was quite possibly the most uncomfortable dinner of my life.Here's a breakdown of our extremely uncomfortable and disappointingly unappetizing meal (From my former favorite restaurant):Scallops - OverdoneBone Marrow - Under salted and served with burnt bread (and I know the difference between charred and burnt)Oysters Foie Gras - Disappointing (minuscule piece of Foie and the Oyster tasted off, they also forgot the Uni)Drinks - meh (I ordered the same drink as always and it just wasn't good, also, the first one had something floating in it)We ordered the chef's sampler of special sashimi which had some interesting options we were excited for however only one piece was actually good (and it was indeed very good.We also ordered a couple pieces of Salmon Sashimi (our fav! especially here) unfortunately it was dry and clearly left out a while -- we took one bite and left it on the plate. The Unagi was cold The waiter insisted that we speak with a manager after making me feel as uncomfortable as possible with condescending questions and a plain rude demeanor.The manager apologized, mentioned that we were the only people at the restaurant with a problem (even though the people next to us returned an entree and didn't like the next one...) He offered to take the Sashimi off the bill so we took the offer. I feel like I've lost something tonight. I've come to expect a certain attention to detail, a respect for the ingredient, a pride for the plate that leaves the kitchen. This used to be an immaculate experience for me, one to be savored and remembered until the next celebration... But not anymore (I know, sooo dramatic!

Or go to Nobu instead.Over the past decade and a half we have had the privilege of eating at some of the best sushi restaurants around the world, and this establishment was a profound disappointment. Perhaps my expectations were too high based on my experiences at the other 3 locations of his we've visited, but some of the failings were unacceptable.We only ordered two rolls and they got both of them wrong, the menu is incredibly limited, the ""tofu made at the table"" was very bland and had a ""nasty"" texture, and from the limited tasting of their tuna sushi their rolls are of average quality for 3x the cost. It's worth noting: I didn't realize it at the time that they had broughty my VEGETARIAN wife a TUNA roll instead of the cucumber roll she ordered; I thought it was their attempt at some sort of consolation after I spoke to the manager. Looking back on it now makes me furious.They were also unwilling to discuss customization of the dishes we were interested (my wife has a few food alergies in addition to being vegetarian). The best thing I had was the fois grais, which isn't a good sign for a sushi place. Morimoto's house ginjo sake was also very tasty.The final thing that convinced me I should write a review, however is that my wife and I are quite sure they judged us by our clothing when we came in not wearing a suit jacket or a fancy dress (we were't dressed like schmucks though :P). We made our reservations a few days out and got seated with all the walk-ins, and up against a wall at that. The manager denied that they do such things, but a visual survey of the rest of the establishment shows tall, attractive, sport-coated people in the main areas and the rest of us shunted off into corners. Their loss, though; I was prepared to drop a very large sum of money for a memorable meal, but instead we left early so we could hit up Beyond Sushi before they closed so we could get some decent food.

So, I was excited to go back again after a couple of years, but it didn't quite reach the hype I had created in my memory. We started of our meal with the sushi and sashimi combos (the small size for both). The dishes come with various types of fish so you get to try things you normally wouldn't. Personally I usually only order salmon so it was great trying other types of fish. I LOVED the sashimi: could definitely taste how fresh it was. The sushi set was good as well, but I prefer sashimi over nigiri: it just depends on what you like better. We also got several hot entrees which we found to be a bit disappointing. The Seafood ""Toban Yaki"" was not good. The red miso-sake broth was salty and the lobster, crab, and mussels in the soup didn't taste fresh. We also got the Braised Black Cod which was good, but the portion was TINY. The Duck, Duck, Duck was probably my favorite of the three. The duck was flavorful and the croissant was soft and fluffy. It reminded me a bit of Peking Duck: it even came with the same sauce. It seems like the hot entrees are kind of a hit or miss so I would recommend checking out what others have said first. Dessert was decent. The apple bread pudding was okay: I would have preferred a crisp over pudding but the flavor was good. The mille-crêpe cake is spongier than the Lady M one. It was good, but the highlight of the plate was the hazelnut rocher gelato. I won't go much into the decor of the restaurant, but obviously it is beautiful and lovely.

You can taste the difference, the Japanese waygu beef was buttery and delcious!

It was during the holiday season, but we managed to make last minute reservations and was seated right away. the space is quite large, with multi floors and full bar area downstairs. They have lunch specials but portions are not very big, so we also ordered appetizers. If you come hungry, you may want to add a little something extra. Other than the portion size; you're in for a treat. EVERYTHING is made with delicate detail. We had the toro tartare to start. very unique presentation! unfortunately, it wasn't the tastiest thing I had there but most expensive.to drink, i ordered a cocktail, which was good but my aunt ordered sake and she had a very generous pour on hers. Sake for me next time! To eat, i had the morimoto chirashi, which came with pickles, miso soup with fresh tofu, and a salad with SOMETHING AMAZING INSIDE (no idea what it is, but its a little sweet and powdery). The chirashi is AWESOME enough for me to be super unlady-like and eat 5 orders. the sushi rice is so comforting in an odd way. My mom had the Black Cod and Aunt had the Sea bass. (she inhaled it) and wanted a taco after. (small portions..) Mom was raving about her fish. Definitely a great place for seafood and sake! Will be back! Maybe for dinner next time if someone foots the bill :)price for 3 was about $200. less than i was expecting! but definitely not a cheap lunch..",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

It was so bad I canceled the rest of my orders and asked for the check to minimize my loss. The toro tartare was awful. It tasted very fishy, showing its low quality, yet was $30 for maybe 12 square inches. Even if it tasted amazing it would have been a rip off since not even ichimura would charge that much. But it didn't taste amazing, it was horrifically bad. I didn't even finish it (and it was tiny!)Morimoto's attention to detail and desire to be good is non-existent. As an example, I went to the bathroom and the electronic aspect of the toilet didn't work. Upstairs you can see that they primed a wall but never painted it so its discolored. What does this have to do with anything? It shows that they are happy to charge rip-off prices but have no desire to provide the experience that goes with that. Just complete apathy and why not when they get away with ripping off customers who are unfortunate enough to go to a restaurant 5 years too late than when they should have. They are just running on their reputation trying to price gouge as many unsuspecting people as they can. Simply shameful. For those that care, service was good but when the food is awful and provides the worst value i have ever seen, who cares about the service? I'm going to contact my credit card company and see if I can get a chargeback on some of the money.

The part of the chicken chosen for the recipe was just not right in the first place - OK let's try it with the sauce - things just escalated - that was the end of the chicken. The sauce was all wrong for it, it should have been more delicate, taming maybe, instead it tasted like a fried salsa with a yogurt kick. It was abrasive, it was something not meant for this dish entirely. It felt like I stepped into one restaurant to have the chicken and into another to have the sauce, and both terrible. Miso soup was good, dessert was good (sesame pastry on top of creme) but perhaps in too large of a portion to savor it's delicacy, almost drowning by the time you are finished.

459,1HxkZjuH_mYolZNaagmAZQ,Erin D.,5.0 star rating,"Having just been here for my 4th time, I can honestly say I still can't wait to come back for mori of Morimoto. Whether my little kosher Polish Nana Roza wants to admit it or not, shellfish is my thang, and this Iron Chef has nailed the oyster. Never had better, nor more creative. These half-dozen babies are served three different ways, all equally amazing: soy/jalapeño, ginger citrus, and ceviche. Cocktail sauce and tabasco just seem silly to me now. (I await the day a chef inspires me to stop putting ketchup on my eggs, but I digress...)The sashimi sampler app has been incredibly different every time, and always uniquely, beautifully prepared. It's just as equally a spectacle to the eyes as it is to the taste buds, as are most dishes here. The live scallops are almost too beautiful - more of a display of foam on a massive mountain of ice than anything edible, so I would pass on this one and opt for the life-changing diver scallop dish at Momofuku. For entrees, go Surf n' Turf or Seafood Toban Yaki. The wagyu beef and hamachi of the Surf n' Turf will melt in your mouth, complementing each other perfectly. Not overly filling, but entirely satisfying. The piping hot toban yaki, a Japanese twist on bouillabaisse, is comforting on a cold night. I suggest removing some of the shellfish from the boiling broth so it doesn't overcook - my shrimpies on the bottom of the bowl got pretty tough by the time I got to 'em. (Nana Roza would say it serves me right for eating them, but hey - at least I'm sharing the dish with a nice Jewish boy, Nana!)Lastly, finish it off with the Matcha Tiramisu, and take that spoon straight to the bottom to get down to the green tea goodness that will leave you bowing to the chef. And don't forget to drink... A LOT.... so that you take multiple trips to the coolest restrooms of all time. No spoilers - just go. And don't be afraid to sit down, boys, though you may not be able to get up for awhile.In the words of the great Phil H., Morimoto's ambiance is ""chic Japan meets outer space"".

If you get the chance, I'd definitely choose to sit here over a regular table. Sure, looking at your dinner companion is ok, but watching the sushi chefs work is like a broadway performance!The menu style suited us perfectly, with many waves of small dishes being brought to us until we were stuffed, rather than a typical starter/main ordering.  They were more than happy to take our order in waves as well, meaning there was no risk of over-ordering or going home hungry. We started with a bowl of ramen soup and pork gyoza. The soup was an amazingly simple but delicious broth with perfectly cooked noodles and moist chicken.  It was served in a massive communal bowl, with more than enough for 2 people.  The gyoza are, without exaggerating, the best I've ever had.  I'm still not sure what the weird crispy pancake thing on top of them were, but I don't even care.  Other highlights were the wagyu beef carpaccio, unfathomably tender and draped delicately in a delightful soy and ginger sauce, and the sushi.  We opted for the $45 mixed plate which came with spicy tuna rolls and a selection of 9 pieces of sashimi - some expected (like the salmon and 2 types of tuna), others more interesting (sea eel and kohada(?!)), but all delicious.It wasn't a cheap meal, but equally not expensive and definitely good value.The only thing I dislike about this place is their website.  Check it out, you'll see what I mean.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The fish didn't melt in my mouth as I had experienced from other sushi restaurants I visited on the west coast or in Asia.

465,HEkcpuQNbwRrsiauKyj3zw,Carolina M.,5.0 star rating,"I've been a huge fan of Morimoto since the original Iron Chef. He's a man of few words, but his work is like edible art.My boyfriend made reservations for us here for my birthday and we were definitely impressed by the food and service. Before getting seated, we were given the choice of sitting at a table or at the sushi bar. Sushi bar was definitely the best choice as we got a chance to watch all the chefs work on food. We even had the chef in front of us serve us the sashimi course since we chose to do the tasting. I'm sure the tasting changes on a day-to-day basis, but from what I remember, what made our tasting different was asking for wagyu beef. I think this is an additional $30/person.The food can be playful which is probably a strange way of describing it. The salad course was a mini-fondue dish where you dip various vegetables: yellow carrot, radish, daikon, leaves, etc. There's also the ""famous"" tuna tartare appetizer where chopped up tuna is pressed into a shallow glass tile and you eat it with different condiments (wasabi, creme fraiche, avocado, etc) with a small spade. These were fun to eat.For the wagyu beef entree during our tasting, it was a surf and turf plate: lobster tail flavored with garam masala, and the wagyu beef was served with some kind of caramelized soy sauce. The flavor was definitely strong with the lobster, but I think enjoyed the steak more. I would've preferred a little less sauce to enjoy the beef, but you can still taste how fatty the beef is. While the marbling can't be seen, you could definitely taste it in each bite.My boyfriend and I were also impressed with dessert which came in 3 courses. Typically, I think dessert is 2 courses, but they did something special for me since it was my birthday. First dessert was a sour apple sorbet which tasted a bit like apple pie. Definitely cleansed my palate. The second dessert was like an ice cream bomb: sour cherry syrup, green tea ice cream enveloped in rich creamy ball topped with a sakura (cherry blossom) leaf which was lightly battered and fried. The sakura leaf tasted like one of those snowpea crisps and was a light, crunchy contrast to the ice cream. The last dessert was ""handmade"" mochi. I think it's funny they call it handmade because I thought most mochis were handmade and if it's in a nice restaurant like this, shouldn't it be handmade anyway? I dont think I was that impressed by the mochi since my mom can make it. Service was great. I think the only slight con was not being able to understand all the servers describing the dishes to us. Some servers had accents, but our waitress was super helpful and nice.Oh, and the bathrooms in the restaurant were kinda cool too. Located on the bottom floor, the stalls have remote-control with seat warmers and a bidet. I didn't use it since I still get squeamish at the thought it's a public restroom, but the 3-D walls behind the toilets were kinda trippy. Overall, dinner at Morimoto's was kind of the proverbial cherry on top of my NYC-trip of a sundae.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We were a bit early (before they opened), and they didn't let us in, but did offer to check in our stuff and came outside to get us when they did open. The server came in to check on us a few times during our meal - the perfect amount, and the service was pretty quick.In terms of food, we both got the sashimi lunch set and shared the tuna tartare. Apparently the tuna tartare is Morimoto's signature dish, and it definitely looked like it. I was actually thinking of trying the fatty tuna sashimi, but couldn't decide if I wanted that or not, so the server recommended the tartare. There were interesting toppings that came with the tartare for us to try and I really like the seaweed one, but next time I may just go with the sashimi. I don't think tartares are my thing. The lunch set was pretty good. It came with the amount of food you'd expect - although the green beans were a bit bland, and I wasn't a big fan of that.

Out of all the courses, what stood out most for me: Toro tartare: came on a board with 6 different types of toppings (wasabi, avocado cream, sour cream, seaweed paste, crisps, and chives). It was eaten with a little metal scraper and how it was presented was quite pleasing to the eyesBagna cauda: this was the salad course but served as a fondue of anchovies and soybeans, served along an assortment of vegetables and meats. The fondue was savory and decadent, quite different from the usual cheese fondue.Oyster with fois gras and uni: this was the perfect bite, got the savory of the food gras and sauce, the creaminess of the uni, and the taste of the sea from the oyster.

Of course, since she was 8 or 9 sushi has been her favorite food so of course I knew she would voice this so...Made reservations a week prior, no issues. Got an 1830 Tuesday night. Invited my sister Magdalen and the two kids Rachel and Loren. Place is business smart dress, which I absolutely have no idea what that is. Luckily, the Army dresses you so that morning I went to pay my respects at 9/11 Memorial Park in my uniform and just kept it on and showed up for dinner. Loren and I got there first and went downstairs to the bar and got a couple drinks. I ordered something that was basically a mojito. Was pretty good. the bartender asked me for my reservation name and told me that she'd charge the table for our drinks so that was cool. When Magdalen and Rachel showed up we went to our table. Magdalen immediately commented that she though she was in a restaurant from the movie Blade Runner. I questioned that, considering what the vision of Los Angeles looks like in the movie but she said the place would be found in the Tyrell building. I concurred. Place really does look very cyberpunk-ish and from the near future.When we sat down, Loren asked me about ordering at a sushi place. I told him the ideal is to go omikase and when I open up the menu, the first thing listed in it, is omikase. That is a 1st for me at a sushi restaurant. I'm seriously thinking that I'm actually dead somewhere and this is all a dream. So I tell them this is the way to do it and ask the waiter how many courses as it's a fixed price ($125/person). He tells me 7 courses but you can add the wagyu beef they have for an extra $30/person. I think it was an extra $30. Absolutely, I'm treating my niece so I tell him to throw it in. I'm not going to lie, it's hard to describe every course we had, better if you just look at the pics. We missed taking a pic on one of our courses but you can take a look. Suffice to say, it's all pretty outstanding. If I had a complaint is that 8 courses wasn't enough food so we ended up ordering 2 more plates of sushi. After the sushi, we were full.So what was so amazing that I absolutely have to discuss in detail? The yellowtail was quite possibly the best yellowtail I've ever had. Outstanding. Unlike any other type of yellowtail I've ever had. It almost tasted not from this world. So fresh and it melts in your mouth. What else? Morimoto's has incredibly fresh wasabi. It's really, really good. But even better than this? They have real wasabi. Oh, you didn't know that 98%+ of the wasabi you eat is actually from a horseradish base? Yep, it's ""fake"" wasabi. I have personally only ever found 2 companies that make real wasabi. Morimoto's has got the actual root! I asked and the waiter seemed impressed that I even knew enough to ask. It's an extra $8 for the real thing. You know what? So, completely, worth it. The real thing is so much better than any other wasabi I've ever had. It still has that sting that hits your nose if you eat too much but the taste isn't as sharp as other wasabi which I generally find to be too sharp. You could almost eat real wasabi by itself. I was just amazed. And of course because it was just grated mere moments prior, the freshness! Oh man, this is the way to go. So at the end of the night Morimoto's really doesn't disappoint. The sushi bar btw wasn't full at all. As far as I can tell, you can just roll up to the sushi bar without a reservation and just order food. I could be wrong though, check it. And of course the price is pretty astronomical. For the four of us my bill was a little over $1000 with tip.

However, the location (Meatpacking) definitely adds some hype to this place.The food is made out to be exotic, top of the line, and groundbreaking but the reality is that it is truly not. Does that take away from the fact that this place is great? No.However, the design and decor of the restaurant is phenomenal. Additionally, the bathroom will be a trip to the future.

However our server Todd didn't seem like he had any interest in our table. The restaurant was not busy since our party was seated at 545pm. He seemed bothered by our questions regarding the menu. We were a party of 8 adults (3kids) and our bill came to $650 (gratuity not included). We were planning to order more dushes but decided to finish up and head to Chelsea Market since we were not feeling the service. Food- The table enjoyed the soft shell crab, duck and sushi/sashimi. Kids loved the ramen, gyoza and even the crab. People choose this restaurant mainly for special occasions. When the service is lacking it kills the celebratory mood. The overall experience went from great to okay. We probably won't return since nyc is full of great restaraunts.

They brought the dishes one by one after we were done with the plate. By the end of the meal, 2 hours have passed and we already had begun feeling the fullness of the meal. The food was amazing, they had a multitude of flavors that either coated the palate or cleansed the palate.

I promise my opinion is not bias at all even though he is my favorite iron chef.I was a bit nervous eating here because usually I am not a fan of high end japanese restaurants. The portions are either really small or lacking flavor. Now thank goodness that wasn't the problem here, the problem I had was the service with my table reservations which is why I gave 1 star less.Came on a Thursday night with reservations at 9:15PM. I was a bit late because I took the wrong turn after getting off the subway. Called to let the host know I will be a bit late and due to my surprise she said they can only hold tables for 15 minutes after reservation time. After that they'll have to let my table go and whenever I do arrive, I can then decide if I want to wait or not. Honestly, whenever I know I'm going to be late I will call to let the restaurant know, and as long as I make that courtesy call, the restaurant would let me know that is fine the fact I called to check in. So to me, that was a bit rude they won't even hold my table for another extra 5 minutes. Anyways so we ended up getting there at 9:40PM and yes table is gone, but host said we can get seated at the sushi bar right away. Better than nothing right? I'm glad we got to sit at the sushi bar actually because you can see all the action in the kitchen and everyone was focused and detailed at preparing your food. Our waiter was excellent. I asked for a glass of ice because I like my water cold, and he always refilled it before my ice went out.Morimoto sashimi- I thought this was the layered sashimi that I was so excited for, but when it came out, it wasn't presented that way. Did they change it? Or did I order wrong? Nonetheless it was delicious and fresh! The plate was decorated so beautifully.Spicy salmon roll and yellowtail roll - just the right size rolls, not too big or small. The fishes were fresh and absolutely delicious.Chirashi bowl - now this is the best chirashi bowl I have ever eaten. Period. This bowl is HUGE with massive amounts of fish piled on top. If you are looking to get full off of one dish and want a lot of different kinds of sashimi, get this. You will not regret.Overall I'm so happy I got the chance to dine here. The restaurant is beautiful, hip and very trendy modern.

The dishes we ordered were Morimoto sashimi and zen sai as appetizers, duck and yellow tail rice in hot stone bowl as main courses. The sashimi has about 6 different kinds of fish and each has its own herb and sauce. It is unique yet a bit overwhelming visually as well as taste wise. As for the duck, it was nearly no taste but relied on sauces. The meat was soft enough, the skin appears to be crispy but actually not. The sauce reminds one of Peking Duck. The other entrée is very good but reminds one bibimbap. So they do not show enough creativity. In comparison to another ""En Japanese Brasserie"" that we are very familiar with, Morimoto enjoys higher reputation but to my view food and service is just not as creative, nor as good!To be fair, we probably should have tried their sushi, which is their brand.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

They don't eat as ritually as I do, and despite how much our bill was, we didn't care and left incredibly happy.Be prepared to be overwhelmed with how beautiful the interior and ambiance is. We walked in 20 minutes before our 8:45pm reservations, and was immediately served at coat check. We were directed to the downstairs bar which was absolutely stunning. (See my pictures!) We all had cocktails and watched the bartender make our drinks from fresh juices (not syrup!) and delicious Japanese liquor. He was so nice and informational.We were then seated by a friendly hostess that carried our drinks. My friends noticed that the many chefs are focused and quite when they make their dishes. Great observation. We all ordered the Omasaki; an 8 course meal. It covers everything. Everything. But to be specific, it covers the: 1) Toro tartare, 2) Seared yellowtail sashimi, 3) Bread, vegetables, and lobster with lobster bisque fondue (you originally get beef, but I specifically asked for a pescatarian friendly Omasake*), 4) Seared scallop (probably the biggest scallop you'll ever see), 5) 5 pieces of sushi (sashimi over rice), 6) 4 pieces of lobster (originally 2 pieces of lobster 2-3 pieces of wagu), 7) Green tea sorbet and whipped cream to clear palette, 8) A bed of green tea gelato under fresh whipped cream, raspberry sauce, sugar powdered tempura green tea leaf, and side of a mochi.I don't want to go further than this, because I want you all to just give this place a go.

491,sWetaBr4mYaBgKlMt9fg8g,Margaret F.,3.0 star rating,"I really wanted to give this place four stars to justify the fact that I spent $135 for omakase plus another $65 for a wine pairing, but...I really can't. I've had much better for less money.The first course was probably one of the best as it is their signature dish - the otoro and chuutoro paste with a variety of dips - wasabi, sour cream, nori, avocado purée, and rice crackers. The tuna was delicious and even better with nori.Then...it kinda goes downhill from there. The yellowtail carpaccio tasted like steamed fish, just with a different texture. I was hoping for something more unique for omakase. The anchovy fondue was only good depending on what you dip into it. Meaning anything bland would probably be okay. But otherwise it is way too salty; not sure why they even included ham into it.The scallops were buttery and had a strong smell of burning incense, like in a Buddhist temple. The smell threw me off and I really couldn't focus on the taste. The presentation was nice, though. The sashimi were very fresh, but they included a giant glob of wasabi in the clam that completely overpowered the taste. Disappointing.The Wagyu and grilled Cajun-like lobster saved the meal a little. Juicy and nicely cooked.But then the dessert ruined it. The tiramisu was hidden under a giant pile of whipped cream / marscarpone. The taste of cherry was too strong - I couldn't taste the green tea at all. And then the mochi was underwhelming. Easily forgettable.We also ordered the spicy king crab a la carte. Honestly that was better than most of the omakase menu. The wine pairing was mostly a bunch of Pinot noir and Chardonnay. One rose, a bunch of whites, and one red. Nothing special.Service was good, but I probably won't come back anytime soon. It's a swanky looking restaurant.

Would you like some diver scallop carpaccio with that foam? Lots of foam! But the scallop was tasty and nicely done. The Ishi Yaki (steak seared on Mt. Fuji Lava Stone) was awesome! I am such a sucker for cooking meat at the table on a hot stone. Plus it came with a bunch of sauces and seasonings. It was so fun and tasty! The Ramen soup, is NOT traditional Ramen. It's like a tasty, high end, Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup. Not too many chicken pieces, which was sad! We then got the spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls. They are good. Definitely can tell the fish quality is nice, but nothing too special beyond that. I prefer blue ribbon sushi to this, when comparing the basic tuna and salmon rolls. Of note, the bottom of my water glass completely fell out and water spilled all over me and the table. I have no idea how this happened. It just all of a sudden, the bottom fell off. Never seen anything like it. The server was prompt to clean up the mess, and luckily the damage wasn't too bad. I figured after an incident like this, at a place like this, they would comp a drink or two at the end, or maybe dessert. This never happened. That extra ""umph"" of service, they did not have.

The hostess did mention that Morimoto is at the restaurant frequently, to which where you can find him at the sushi bar concocting his latest creation. Unfortunately, no such siting of him that night.First of all, reservations are strongly suggested. Although we made reservations, we still had to wait a bit. Fortunately, they do have a bar/lounge downstairs so you can get good and liquored up while you wait to be seated. Zen sai -- It seems as though the items in this appetizer changes frequently. We were totally expecting something we were frequently seeing in the Yelp pictures but to our surprise, we got something totally different. I was a little miffed but I kept my mind open to the possibilities. We got 5 little dishes of different types of seafood but our favorite was the crab. The meat fell right off. When does that ever happen?!Spicy Tuna Roll -- We order this roll at every sushi restaurant we go to. The tuna was super dark and it wasn't mashed up with spicy mayo like it usually is. Not sure how he did it but he manged to add a little kick to it.Kanpachi -- My favorite sushi to order! The flesh looked almost fake, as if it were plastic. It was a very pale pink, almost transparent. The fish itself was very soft as if you were chewing on meat that was smoked for days.Sea bass -- Soft, buttery sea bass made with miso and sake kasu. So simple but so amazing. The sake kasu added some flavor to the sea bass, which gave it that sweet taste. Although the tables are rather close, the restaurant itself is so loud your neighbors won't be able to hear anything. The crowd is very lively and at times boisterous but it's all in good times. Our waiter was 110% professional and each time a new dish was brought out we were given a quick rundown on what the dish consisted of.

Were there people actually dipping those overly sauced popcorn shrimp in another coat of sauce? Another example, the side dishes came with the Seabass meal was Korean flavored pickled cucumber, I'd trade it for some authentic Japanese pickled cucumber instead. It's details such as those question the authenticity a little.

Here's what we started with:1. Toro Tartare - despite costing a hefty $31 for appetizer, I gave this a try anyway because it seemed like most Yelpers were raving about it. It was really all about the presentation, which came in a giant bowl of crushed ice, which held up the thin slice of tartare and a small plate of dippings which included wasabi, crème fraiche, avocado, chives, nori seaweed, and rice crisps.   It was delicious and definitely one of my favorites but still, not worth that price. I made sure I scraped every bits and pieces off from this dish. 2. Tuna Pizza - at first bite, I wasn't a fan. But as I ate more of it, it was actually quite tasty.  I think you just need to keep an open mind that this is not your typical Italian pizza. 3. Seared Scallops - three jumbo seared scallops topped with bok choy. I wish I hadn't ordered this because it wasn't like  an out-of-this-world experience. Yes, it was fresh but you can get this at any other seafood restaurant.The main entrée was a bit tricky for me to decide. I wish I had done more research on their entrees before coming here. But I ended up ordering the Crispy Kombu Brined Chicken, which turned out to be my least favorite dish of the night. The portion itself was surprisingly huge. I had to split the chicken with my fiance because it was absolutely a horrendous amount of meat for me (a plus for those meat lovers). But I didn't really enjoy the way they smoked the chicken. The sauce didn't flatter me and in the end, I wish I had ordered seafood instead because the sushi platter that my fiance ordered was super fresh and delicious.   Dessert was the highlight. The apple bread with green tea crumbles  and the tofu cheesecake were like nothing I ever had at any other place. Come here for the experience for the sake of  saying, 'Yes I've eaten at Morimoto' but for the true foodies out there, this place is not worth the money.

I can happily say that the place not only met my expectations but exceeded them. Dining at Morimoto was more than just an opportunity for you to enjoy some beautiful presented and executed foods, it was a total experience. As soon as you walk in you feel like you are under the ocean in a mystical cave. The decor and lighting calm you and set the tone for the food that is to come. While the ambiance was lovely, the star of the show was still the food. My friend and I ordered the Toro Tartare to start and devoured it in seconds. The dish was  so fresh and balanced in flavors that you had to remind yourself you are in public so as not to shove the whole thing in your mouth at one time. For our main entrees we had the Surf and Turf and the Seafood Tobanyaki. The Surf and Turf was executed so beautifully and presented like a piece of art. I've had steak and fish before but it was different at Morimoto because it was so perfectly done. As for the Seafood Tabonyaki, it perfumed our entire table with a lovely scent. It was also very delicious. I can say that Morimoto is really my first experience with fine dining and one I truly enjoyed.

If you're looking for ambience and decor, though, Morimoto is spectacular. The sushi is basically over priced and average. One trip to Sugarfish as comparison will prove that point. Yes, they got the warm rice, but it lacked vinegar and starch. Yes, they have the right fish, but the prep is nothing special. Probably ideal for a big business or birthday dinner, but if you're a foodie and know sushi, go elsewhere.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Never before have coffee beans, cream sauce, and cookie crumbs been married in such a beautiful union. This dessert made my taste buds blossom into dancing flowers, my brain explode with joy and my stomach fall down in gratitude. The rich coffee flavor combined with the creamy, well, cream, leading to the soft cookie crumble is heaven in a glass bowl.And although I usually don't recommend toilet stall photography, I implore you to bring the highest quality camera you have to the bathroom, as it's even more beautiful than the restaurant itself. First you'll stand outside a closed stall for about 10 minutes until you realize that it's been vacant the entire time. Then you'll step inside and be transported to a mystical fairy land with 3-D turquoise walls with pink flowers and a toilet that reclines and warms your butt at the same time. I stood there in awe for about five minutes and took the most artsy bathroom picture I've ever taken in my life.

We had been looking forward to coming here for a while, since we are not from the city.  We started off with a cocktail from the downstairs bar and had fantastic service.  But that all changed Once  we were sat at our table. We did not get greeted for over 20 minutes. Once we did the server walked up and asked us if we knew what we wanted. She didn't even ask for a drink order, nor did she tell specials. Not exactly what you expect for five-star dining. Trying to look past that, we asked a few questions about the menu which she answered in a short fashion and almost seemed like she was annoyed that we were asking questions at all. My husband ordered A tasting menu, and I ordered the vegetarian soba noodles, burrata, tofu and broccoli rabe.  Despite having to order all sides, as a vegetarian it was still a well-rounded meal. It's a good thing I ordered a lot of food though, because my husband portions came out bite-size and he did not have nearly enough to eat. The highlight of my meal was certainly the burrata, and the tofu prepared tableside, that was something I'd never seen before.Unfortunately, after spending over $400, the most memorable part of our meal was the terrible service, so while we enjoyed our food, we will never go back.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

My sister and I decided to come here to celebrate her milestone birthday and felt this would fit the occasion. It's located by the High line (popular and scenic walkway above ground) on the west side. Outside, there were drapes covering the main entrance. Please avoid looking like a fool and not stand around trying to find the entrance and door handle. They are automatic doors. The host and hostess were a bit pretentious and didn't give off that ""hi! Welcome"" feeling. Fake smiles, I saw right through them! Since I was the first to arrive, I asked to be seated first instead of waiting at the bar. Their policy required the complete party to be seated. I looked around the place and it's only a quarter full. Followed by a few ""are you serious"" silent seconds... the hostess said ""but I think we can accommodate you"" and led me to my table. Thankfully, our waitress was a complete sweetheart and super attentive. After taking our drink order, we decided on the omakase tasting menu for $135 pp. They offered an upgrade choice of $30 extra for Japanese wagu beef instead of the Australian wagu (waste of money, stick with the original). Our entrees came out pretty fast. I did wish our servers explain clearly what each of our meals were. They kinda just said it real fast and left. Umm... ok. Overall, the dishes were good, but not great. Some highly mentionables: Tuna tar tar - delicious with all the little spreadsScallop - presentation was so pleasant and the taste was devineFish carpaccio - one of my favorites, really felt like my dad had cooked it.

But i did not like it and thas odd becos i have a huge thing for bone marrows -- ever since i had it at Hunt & Fish.. Another great restaurant btw. But yeah this was too salty), sashimi combo (fresh, assorted sashimi cuts), then we had oh toro sushi pcs and uni pcs.. Uni def stood out for us.. It definitely melted in our mouth. We had the alaskan wagyu ribeye w brussel sprouts on the side. The wagyu ribeye is tender, tasty and comes w a nice sauce to go w it. Overall, everything tasted good--but not like ""OMG great.""

The service was supreme, the staff were polite, and the ambience was comprised of modern decor. Overall the food wasn't bad, but I feel like it was hyped up to be much more than it actually was. The toro tartare was sadly not nearly as exquisite as people had described. All the fish is frozen and then defrosted once it arrives, and it felt as if the quality of the sashimi/sushi was equivalent to that of the discount place I used to eat in college. Ok maybe I'm being a bit extreme with that last statement, but I just expected so much more. The cooked food was actually quite tasty. The wagyu steak was truly medium rare with a crisp outer layer. The last factor of my rating is the pricing. Now I'm generally much more of a hole in the wall type of restaurant eater, but don't mind cutting into my rent money if it's a meal thats worth the extra suffering later.

Well, it just wasn't in the cards: there was tons of available seating but they insisted on offeringus the same poor seating options I heard them offering to the tourist walk ins who came in at the same time as us. The place teams reeks of a past-it's-prime former hot spot and wife and I were clearly at least 5 years too late for a good dining experience. We left after a little back and fort with the management about the poor seats notwithstanding the many empty tables. If I have to work that hard just to negotiate a decent table, especially at Morimoto's price point, I quickly lose my interest so wife and I took our business elsewhere that had much better management, ambience and, I'm guessing here, cuisine as well.

I should have noticed the signs when we could get reservation the day of. So why I would rank it one star1) the menu is not vegetarian friendly 2) don't do the chef tasting not worth it (we are a party of 6 and everyone did it but one of the guest was excluded due to lack of products in their restaurant to accommodate)3) instead of addressing the issue of dietary restriction in a polite way- our guest was treated as if they were an annoyance- the person was spoken in a belittling manner- we were about to walk out due to the attitude but the guest insisted we stay because he felt bad to ruin our dinner experience 4)I was served gluten dessert after telling them I had an allergy to gluten - graham cracker is not gluten free5) this was the topper that made me never want to return- right when the restaurant opened I needed to use the restroom- walked in and a half naked little little girl was in there- I was shocked asked her where her mother was and she just shrugged and stood there terrified. I went to the restroom came out and the little girl was still there but now in a very mature dress and heels. I asked her again if she needed help to find her mom she shock her head was trying to rush to get her heels on. I went up to tell the front desk people because no one was downstairs besides two male bartenders- the lady thanked me but finished her conversation before checking it out. the lady went down and went up with no little girl with her. For the next 15 mins(my view from my seat was of the stairs up from the bathroom level to the restaurant level) i waited but the little girl never came up. So, I got concerned and I had to go down and make sure she was ok and if she was still there I was going to call the police. I went to the restroom again and no one was on the bottom level besides the bartenders and a few servers- the little girl was gone. It made me really uneasy of why was a little girl was getting dressed alone in the restroom and right before we left the bottom floor was closed off for a private party. It was way too strange for me to return. The rudeness of staff especially when the manager tried to fix our dining experience -he did not handle the situation well.

There's 5 bento boxes to choose from and they all come with miso soup, salad, tempura, 3 pieces of spicy tuna roll and 3 pieces of nigri and the ""entree"". It was a great bento box and left me satisfied. I go the waygu beef, I didn't really know how to pass it up. All in all it was good, except for it was room temp-cold-ish and it ran on the salty side with no rice to balance out the salt. The miso soup had fresh tofu, which was awesome.The salad had the best dressing every and wasn't heavily dressed.The vegetable tempura had 4 pieces of deliciousness with an awesome sauce at the bottom.The waygu beef I already mentioned.The spicy tuna was good, lots of tuna.The nigri was awesome.This all came with dessert, which was strawberry panna cotta (awesome!).I'd say for the experience I didn't mind the $25 price tag.

We went through every course, each one beautifully crafted and aesthetically pleasing. Out of the 8 dishes these were my favorite:1) The famous ""tuna tar tar"" - you have fresh tuna on the plate, with an array of 6 dipping sauces that perfectly compliment the tuna. ( I can eat this forever)2) The kobe beef pairing with the Lobster-  I don't think I need to specify how great this is.and the best part of the restaurant, as one yelper stated: is the bathroom!

547,aeJ4PypkvHO8HsuW0JAOjQ,Teresa L.,5.0 star rating,"Two reviews in one: Restaurant week and then the Omakase dining experience.1) RESTAURANT WEEK --- I had my first Morimoto experience when I came here for lunch with two friends. I knew that the food wouldn't be the BEST that Morimoto had to offer, but I was still interested to see what kind of fare we would get. Among the three of us, we got the braised black cod and the wagyu beef. The lunch was served bento box style. Each bento box came with the following: 1) miso soup, which had huge pieces of tofu in it. 2) Salad. 3) 3 pieces of sashimi, 3 pieces of sushi with white ginger. 4) Vegetable tempura (asparagus and scallion) with a cheese based dipping sauce. For $24-ish it was not a bad deal at all. The best part of the meal was the dessert! The Green Tea Panna Cotta was freaking delicious. I think the dessert is what cemented my decision to return for dinner.2) OMAKASE --- I came back a few weeks later for dinner. We decided to go with the Omakase menu, which is an extremely common practice in Japan. Basically in Japan, you pull up a seat and your entire menu is up to the chef. (but in Japan you can pay whatever you think your meal was worth... whereas you can't get away with that here!). The Omakase menu usually goes from lighter to heavier fare. For example, we started with some raw selections and worked our way up to the with surf and turf, finally ending with dessert.In my opinion, the Omakase is TOTALLY worth the price, and if you want the fullest dining experience at Morimoto's you need to get it. It's $125 per person. The chef included items that I would have never thought to order on my own, such as the oyster with foie gras. It was one of my favorite dishes that night. I saw some people ordering Omakase for the entire table... no no! That's just awkward. This is a 7-10 course menu, each plate is going to have small servings. Plus, it doesn't make sense to split a piece of sushi 3 ways!LASTLY, you need to use the bathroom there. Just GO even if you don't have to ""go."" The toilets are badays and are heated!

553,b0x4HrjoB6Mo47G5bJN0rw,Irina D.,5.0 star rating,"Was taken here on a belated birthday dinner by my dad and stepmom earlier tonight.I knew we were going to dinner but had no idea where to. When we arrived at the doors to this restaurants I was confused as I have heard of it before but never thought I would actually be coming here since it is not in my price range. Even the doors to the restaurant let you know you arrived somewhere unique. Once we walked in we were immediately greeted with a smile and asked whether we had a reservation. Once it was confirmed, we were asked whether there was something we wanted to check, since it was raining we checked our umbrellas. The restaurant is large, with a main floor and a smaller floor downstairs. The design is modern and slick yet it does not seem cold. The lights were deemed which gave it a more intimate feel. As some people have pointed out, the bathroom is not to be missed. Inside the stall is an art show on its own and includes a Japanese toilet. We started with the Morimoto Sashimi which is a platter with seared toro, salmon, tuna, hamachi and wild shrimp.I usually do not eat fish besides salmon but I decided that this was the time to make an exception. The pieces are quite small but each one tastes absolutely phenomenal. Two of the fish were covered with caviar: the salmon with red caviar, which was very good but not better than red caviar I previously had, and another covered with black caviar. I never had black caviar before and although it was tiny, it was absolutely delicious. The dressing that the sashimi was sitting on was also memorable, even though I had no idea what it was. Also, there was a piece of fruit on the platter which resembled a raspberry but was nothing like I tasted before. For a main course I had the crispy kombu brined chicken which comes with corn lemongrass puree, nori, cilantro and lemon peel. The corn puree was very very good but the chicken was to die for. I never tasted chicken so soft before, I was almost able to cut pieces of it with my chopsticks. The dressing was unbelievable, I tried to eat as slowly as possible in order to savor the taste of it for as long as I could. I had both my stepmom and dad try it and they both agreed it was excellent. Between the two of them they ordered the ishi yaki buri bop ( yellowtail on rice cooked at the table, really cool to watch) and surf & turf ( wagyu skirt steak & hamachi ribbons, herbed potatoes, crushed citrus & avocado) and they both loved their dishes. For dessert I got the ice cream trio which included chocolate, vanilla and a Japanese flavor whose name I didnt catch. Although vanilla and chocolate are common ice cream flavors, you could tell that the quality of the ice cream was different than in most other places and it was delicious.Our waiter was nice and quite formal, which I guess is expected at a place of this caliber. When he brought the dessert plate, it came with a small dark chocolate on which it said ""happy birthday"" and a candle and wished me a happy birthday. No singing or fake smiles, which is very different than what I am used to. Any time I walked by a staff member I was greeted and smiled at, it really made me feel appreciated.For an hour after the meal was over I felt a natural high so sweet that I was thinking to myself that if I were to die at that point, I would definitely die happy.I would have given this place six stars if I could because no place I have been to so far has impressed me as much.

It's been a while since I dined here and I started to miss the toro tartare. Service is always impeccable. I have always had customized Omakase based on what I had before and what my preference is.

565,vetX-6xh-eeSP8vTGYleNw,Julia H.,3.0 star rating,"Beautiful restaurant, but the food itself was pretty average. FOOD:Toro Tartare ($31)-This was the main reason why I wanted to try this place. I was searching on Yelp for Japanese restaurants in NYC and the presentation of this dish definitely caught my attention. The dish has a very unique presentation where you scrape off the toro tarare with a little shovel-like spoon and you can mix it with a variety of dipping items, which included wasabi, nori paste, rice crackers, chives, avocado puree, and sour crème. The fish was fresh, but overall I thought it was overhyped and overpriced.Grilled Wagyu Beef Skirt Steak ($26): This came with a sweet onion garlic jus, grilled maitake mushrooms, and shishito peppers. The sweet garlic sauce was very flavorful; however, the actual steak itself was average. It was cooked perfectly medium-rare, but there were definitely a few pieces that were too chewy and I had to spit out. The mushrooms and peppers were nothing special. I thought it was a good deal since the lunch set also came with rice, miso soup, side salad, and seasonal pickles, but I would definitely recommend getting a different main entrée if you are thinking of ordering this!Spicy Salmon Roll ($8.25): Chopped Salmon, scallion, & spicy sauce. The fish was very fresh and you definitely get a good amount of salmon in each bite, but it was nothing mind-blowing. Overpriced but I guess it's expected at such a fancy restaurant. AMBIANCE:Beautiful, modern, and sleek. I really liked the décor of the whole restaurant. The bathroom was also very cool. They have Japanese toilets that are heated! The back wall of each stall was pretty trippy as well. It looked like an infinity mirror that had cherry blossoms inside.

The acrylic chopsticks and ombre tables were a nice touch.Service- A definite low point for our group.  We came with a group of 6 and were ready to splurge on a fun dinner.  We asked the server for a suggestions in almost every category and he continued to suggest, in our opinion, very basic options.  Even after telling him we wanted to try something new and exciting he suggested the California roll.  Drinks came out incorrectly  on two different occasions and we had to request them to be fixed.  Throughout the meal we were asking what other tables had ordered because it looked more fun than our choices. Presentation- Highlight of the evening.  Table side pouring of the mushroom soup was nice and aromatic.  Our absolute favorite moment of the evening was the Fiery Chocolate Tart.  The ball of chocolate was engulfed in the flames, but the climax of the presentation was when the flame went out and the chocolate melted into a puddle.  Impactful and memorable food moment! Food- I was expecting a burst of flavor but it was lacking.  We started with the Spicy King Crab, it wasn't spicy at all and was very bland.  The crab was also a little tough and forgettable.  Next we had the Pork Gyoza, a little more flavor here and plating was nice.  The tomato jam and foam were a positive, definitely my favorite appetizer.  The rock shrimp was our next appetizer and it was the most disappointing, it came with a side of ranch dressing and was reminiscent of your local Applebee's.  Chicken Ramen was alright, but was expecting more flavor, was very bland and flat.  The Mushroom soup portion was very small and while beautiful, I personally didn't like the flavor.  The sushi we did order was very fresh and delicious.  The Tuna in the Spicy Tuna roll melted in my mouth.  The California roll was very basic and not a stand out (as we expected) but when there server suggested it we figure we should try it.  The special roll of the evening, topped with yellowtail was a highlight and our favorite roll.  I think it was so great because it was new and innovative.  Would suggest the Chinese broccoli, complex flavors and was an unexpected favorite . Entrees: Angry Chicken- good, nothing extraordinary.  Sea Bass- a definite highlight, cooked to perfection with layers of flavor.  Standout dish.   Dessert was our favorite part of the meal. The Milk Chocolate Key Lime pie was fantastic.  But the best was the Fiery Chocolate Tart- sometimes the table side flame desserts can be gimmicky but this one followed through.  Loved every aspect of this desert, the rich chocolate, the ice cream inside and the chocolate garnishes.  We wanted to lick this plate clean!Overall- Ambiance was a positive but dinner left us desiring more.  Would have left highly disappointed if it wasn't for the killer dessert.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Everything from the lighting to the modern-minimalist feel was great. It wasn't your standard Japanese setting either, very cool and chic.

I had been pretty adventurous all weekend, but decided to really go for it with the chef's tasting menu. I am so pleased we made this decision- as this was one of the better meals that I have had in along time. It was a 6 course tasting menu- and there was not a single bite left on one single course. It is a good amount of food too, it was just that good. I really enjoyed trying different dishes than I would normally order, and really enjoyed the chef sushi selections.

We have both been big fans of Iron Chef America for years, so I knew this place would be a special treat!While it certainly wasn't cheap, this was some of the best food I've ever eaten. Seriously. Our bill came out to be about $89 per person after tax and tip (2 drinks, 2 appetizers, and 2 entrees between us).Drinks: white lily cocktail and the sesame blossom. Delicious! Appetizer 1: wagyu beef tartare. It was heartily seasoned, which I found to be delicious, but my boyfriend found to be a tad but over-powering as he likes to really taste the beef. The quail egg yolk had a very creamy consistency and the chips were great.Appetizer 2: I can't find it on the menu, but it was a fancy fondue with truffle shavings. It came with various bits of seafood, meat, and veggies to dip. We both loved the fondue...it was salty and delicious with a strong truffle flavor.Entree 1: Sea bass with sweet sake kasu, Japanese eggplant, and miso. It actually tasted like lobster, which was insane. So good, rich, and buttery!Entree 2: Duck, duck, duck. This one really took the cake no I highly recommend it. It was a duck sandwich, roast duck, and a duck egg, served with foie gras butter and a red miso sauce. It was so juicy and delicious and crispy and I would eat it again and again and again!!While I can't afford to come here on a regular basis, I would come back for a special occasion. Yum.

I must say the rose wine was amazingly delicious and the sashimi was so worth it. It was fresh, unique way of eating raws. Then continued with the Gyzo which was made in a special way tasted sooo good and flavored. Layered the entrees of skirt steak and the duck duck duck arrived. Before having the entree, my stomach was only a quarter filled. I must say the duck duck duck isn't so much for Asian ppl to try because it's just like the ones you can buy in Chinatown for way less. But on the other hand, the skirt steak was marinated so well that the flavor was different and real good. Tho it's a small portion, but you savor every piece slowly!

We got the chirashi, crunchy yellow tail roll, edamame, and the sashimi appetizer. We also ordered this delicious, sweet sake.The sashimi appetizer is GORGEOUS. The presentation was beautiful and the flavors exquisite. The only downside is that it's not really to share - they only had one of each sashimi so my friend and I could only taste half of the pieces because it's pretty impossible to split the bite-sized portions. We did consider ordering two orders however, so we could both try everything but we ended up being so full that we decided not to.The chirashi bowl was great. I wish the waiter told us what was in it though... There were 10 different types of fish and vegetables in it and we had trouble discerning what was what!The yellow tail roll is to die for. So fresh and it literally melted in my mouth. I would go again just to try their rolls. The cold sake was yummy. The server was very knowledgeable about all the different types of sake and even brought two out so we could try two different ones before we ordered. If you don't know anything about sake, be sure to ask a lot of questions so you can find one that you like. They are very willing to help you figure out which one is the best for you.Overall, great place. Lovely ambiance and friendly service. I had a great time here.

Though I forgot to say no red meat and one of the 8 courses included a piece of wagyu steak which my husband had no problem unloading for me.

585,ma3wztgkpWYgbMYTyS1ecA,Jay G.,5.0 star rating,"Morimoto is one of the better japanese restaurants that I have eaten at in New York City, as well as the Philadelphia area.  First off, it is located in the meat district and stands out with its automatic glass door entrance and the modern interior design.  I have never been to a place like this and decided to take my girlfriend here for dinner on our last night in NYC.  We felt a bit under dressed as many people were dressed full out in what seemed to be their best outfit or one of their best outfits.  Regardless, we ignored this factor as we luckily saw some people who were less properly dressed for the restaurant than us so it wasn't as bad.  The only minor complaint is that we had a reservation but we still had to wait a bit for our table.  We were seated in the room to the right of the entrance at the window seat.The first items we ordered were our drinks in which I decided to try the Morimoto sake flight while my girlfriend had a specialty cocktail.  The sake flight provided three different sakes with different flavors ranging from pear to other fruits.  I enjoyed all three sakes and definitely recommend this to anyone who likes sake.  After this sake flight, I decided to just get a carafe of the best sake in the flight.  My girlfriend enjoyed her cocktail but it was too sweet for my taste.Now, on to the true review.  We decided to order the toro tartare and Morimoto sashimi cold dishes.  The toro tartare was delicious and provided a unique experience as the toro was placed on a sideways rectangular dish and scraped off with spoons.  The morimoto sashimi was good but was just like ordering normal sashimi with some extra toppings such as a jalapeno.For the hot dishes, we tried the rock shrimp tempura, sauteed foie gras and grilled eel, oyster foie gras, and japanese lobster fritters.  The rock shrimp tempura was really good and provided two different sauces which was different from other restaurants we have enjoyed this appetizer.  The two foie gras hot dishes were both very delicious.  My girlfriend even enjoyed both of these and she is not a fan of foie gras like me.  I fell in love with the foie gras and grilled eel as well as the oyster foie gras.  If you are a foie gras fan than you better get over here and try these two appetizers.  The Japanese lobster fritters were pretty good but nothing compared to the foie gras appetizers in my view.As for the sashimi, I went for the kinmedai (golden big eye snapper), aoyagi (orange clam), awabe (abalone), mizudako, and uni (sea urchin).  We also got the eel avocado roll.  All of the sashimi seemed fresh and were very good, some of the best sashimi I have had in a long time.  The uni was some of the freshest I have had in a while also.  The sushi roll was nothing special but was still decently good.  To finish off the meal, we split the tofu cheesecake which was pretty good.  In the end, this restaurant can break your wallet as it ended up costing me a handful.Overall, I definitely recommend Morimoto to anybody who loves foie gras and Japanese food.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Food was average at best, and application of seasonings / dressings seem heavy-handed. Service disappointing. Were seated at 7.45pm and went for the tasting menu. By 9pm, we were only just served our 2nd course (of 7). Toro tartar: Gimmicky, overrated and tasteless, as other reviews have mentioned. I'd prefer a nice slice of fish rather than all minced up and flattened. Sashimi salad: Average. Was swimming in a pool of sauceAmberjack carpaccio: As above. Chawanmushi: At the first bite, we got excited. Perhaps dinner was salvaged? Well, not really. Seems like the chef accidentally added too much salt. Oyster with foie gras and uni: Was drenched in too much teriyaki sauce. Unfortunate, as the dish sounded so promising. (Hence we added it as an order - wasn't part of the omakase) Sushi: Nothing to write home about, but probably the best ( / least disappointing) course we had. We were told it was a ""sushi and sashimi platter"". Well - it was 5 pieces of nigiri. So not sure where the sashimi went.... Surf and Turf: Wagyu was good. And small. And cold. Lobster tail looked impressive but once again heavy handed-ly seasoned. (I.e. intense sodium shock) Dessert: it was actually okay.

I definitely could have gone without anything else, but had to do something extra because hell, I don't go to fancy restaurants all that often.

I totally did not picture it coming out the way it did, but it was good and the various accompaniments and garnishes complemented the toro, plus it was fun mixing everything to make different flavors.Oyster foie gras - With uni on top. Good, but the teriyaki sauce was kind of overpowering so I wasn't able to taste as much as I wanted out of this dish.Rock shrimp - Came out in 2 heaping portions - one with wasabi aioli and the other with this spicy pepper sauce. Both were crispy for having been tossed in the sauces and had a subtle but flavorful taste to them.Surf &Turf - It came with Wagyu filet, bok choy (they had no problem subbing the herbed potatoes that usually come with this), and hamachi ""ribbons"" mixed with avocado and citrus, which they mix tableside. My bf and I both agreed that we loved the hamachi and bok choy but could do without the beef. Of course, if we wanted good meat, we would have gone to a steakhouse.Sea bass - With Japanese eggplant, avocado, miso with a sweet sake glaze. Sooo flaky and delicious! I absolutely loved this dish.

The most important thing to remember is to make sure you get a seat at the sushi bar! This is where all the action happens and the chefs will chat with you if you are friendly to them. To see them work up close is really cool. It's entertainment! Plus, on both occasions the Iron Chef Morimoto himself was holding court there and he came over to speak to us both times. Really nice and warm guy. Was very interested what we thouight of his food, which was terrific by the way.When you pull up to the place the outside is covered with a flowing red drapery across the front.  You can't miss it. Entering the place you are greeted by the front desk staff. Both times our seats were not ready and it would be about 15 minutes to wait, so we went to the downstairs bar/lounge area. Bar area is very clear white with glowing red walls! Futuristic cool. See through poly - plastic type stools, and funky spaceship type feel. Small lounge area to grab a seat and enjoy a cocktail while waiting for your sushi feast to begin.Going back upstairs to get our seats we were also greated by a giant bottle wall. The whole place has this very chic Japan meets outer space vibe to it, which compliments the experience here. It is kind of loud and bustling, probably because of the size and open layout. Personally, I prefer sitting up at the sushi bar area, as the setup of the tables on the floor did not vibe well with me. Dinner here is off the hook! Portions are not huge, but Japanese cuisine is not about huge plates. It's about presentation and fresh flavors so keep that in mind. Crispy rock shrimp tempura, Japanese lobster fritters, ishi yaki buri bop (which they cook in front of you in a hot stone bowl was delish - yellowfin tuna w/rice), fresh maki and sushi were all good. Many choices to choose from. Plus, Morimoto has his own line of sake in all styles and a pretty extensive wine list. Beer of course also. Great stuff to accompany your meal.Had some tasty desserts. Lusted over this chocolate cake with caramel popcorn and corn ice cream that was like a party in my mouth!Seriously, no meal at Morimoto is complete without a trip to the famous bathrooms. Life is not complete until walking into this serene environment, have the lid move up and down on its own, and feel the gratifying warmth of that toilet seat on your butt as you sit down on it. Ahhhhh. All types of controls to play with on this robotic throne.

The salad was  too salty, the pickled cucumbers were good but not great, and the green beans were pretty good but nothing to call home about.The entree I picked was the 5 piece Nigiri with a maki roll. The entrees were really good (thank god). The fish was extremely fresh and I was delighted because after all, good sashimi is what I really came for. The maki roll was a yummy tuna with a light spicy mayo sauce.The desserts were all in all way too sweet, to the point that I could not finish the dessert. The presentation was really beautiful but the sweetness was truly overwhelming and disappointing.Compared to other various restaurant week deals throughout the city, I believe Morimoto was a bit hyped up.

I had their 7-course omakase, which, at Morimoto's, is really more of a set dinner; it doesn't change from day to day, and I wouldn't say all the courses used their freshest ingredients (with true omakase, the courses differ from day to day depending on which ingredients are freshest that day).I enjoyed the food, but surprisingly, the nigiri sushi course was...just ok. Not as bad as supermarket sushi, but it was average sushi. The rice wasn't warm, and the fish was not bad, but not great. I also thought the soy sauce was a bit harsh. One of the courses had a lobster tail, which was nice, but I thought the lobster meat wasn't as juicy as it could have been. I liked the first course, with the tuna and condiments. Also one of the courses was a little non-alcoholic mixed shot -- very good, but a stretch to call it a course. All in all, I think the food was good, but I was disappointed in the sushi, which I would've expected to be excellent yet was just ok.

However, once you step foot into the lobby, you will be captivated by the intriguing decor of billowing ceiling curtains and plush leather seats. My friend and I came for RW lunch. I had the sashimi entree and coffee kuromitsu. The sashimi was very fresh, I would recommend it! The coffee kuromitsu had a very nice coffee flavor and had an interesting mix of textures - creamy and light from the foam, and crunchy and gritty from the coffee beans/crumble. My friend had the pork belly cold ramen, which she really enjoyed, and the black sesame profiteroles, which were very good as well. They were essentially cream puffs with a black sesame filling that was light and subdued - unlike other black sesame desserts where the sesame flavor completely overwhelms you. The one thing that we both agreed would make the dessert tastier is if the cream puffs were served colder (ours were slightly above room temperature).All in all, the food was fantastic, ambience was wonderful, and service was great - save for the minor incident where my friend got splashed in the arm when the waitstaff wiped down the adjacent table with an overly damp towel.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

(7 courses, actually. I don't consider you a course, palate-cleansing ginger drink.) I admit I did find myself wishing we had a greater variety of sushi, but I also understand that the tasting menu wouldn't want to rely too heavily on it. Kudos to our server, who was really helpful and attentive without being pushy or intrusive, AND at one point during the meal, she moved a fork that was placed on my right side to my left because she remembered I was a lefty.

After checking in, we were informed by the host that we had to wait a little because the table before us was lingering. Fine, NBD. Wouldn't be a Chelsea restaurant without a wait. ;-)During that wait time, we talked about the decor, looked over the Morimoto cookbook that was on display, took photos, until we realized that 45 minutes had passed. We were getting a little impatient and the host was kind enough to treat us for drinks for our wait. Could we really be bought by alcohol? The answer is ABSOLUTELY. The boys got beers, while a few of us got this delicious Bulleit Bourbon cherry drink that was sososososooso delicious. Bourbon's the best (next to scotch). Finally, an hour later, and after the host profusely apologized, we were sat. Was this wait ridiculous? Yes, but I noted to my friend that I could not fault the restaurant too much for it because they were so kind to us (even treated us to some appetizers that were brought nearly immediately after we sat because we loved since were absolutely starving) and thoughtful. The appetizer thing - I couldn't think of anything more comforting than being able to eat SOMETHING immediately after sitting down. We were gracious, because probably we would have been really upset had they not gone to all the trouble to make us feel better. As far as food goes, I ordered the surf and turf ($39) that composed of a wagyu skirt steak and hamachi ribbons, herbed potatoes (that were to die for - I couldn't believe potatoes could taste THIS good), crushed citrus & avocado. The hamachi ribbons were prepared tableside (which was cute and quick). I also split the veggie of the day (sunchoke with pesto for $8) with a friend, and it was the perfect combination. My friend Jodi ordered the Sushi plate (the $45 size) and was pleased by all the fresh sushi choices on her plate. Tran ordered the chirashi sushi, which was a HUGE portion of fresh fish. It was $33, probably the least expensive dish, yet came in a gigantic bowl and had about 10-12 things inside. She was absolutely stuffed. My pal Sandra ordered the Duck Duck Duck that contained a duck sandwich, duck egg, and I forget the third component.All in all, the wait sucked but the service was superb and the food mouthwatering.

The wait staff and hostesses were very friendly and we were seated immediately which I liked (I hate when restaurants make you go to the bar and then as soon as you order a drink, your table is magically ready) although they did try to seat us in the area when you first walk in to the left which is like COMPLETELY out of the main dining room and just a weird seating area in general. I felt like saying nuh uh! No one puts baby in the corner! All kidding aside, that is really how I felt.We ordered MANY dishes so I will break it down by what we ate:+ Spicy king crab - A must order. As in, you MUST order this. Did ya hear me?- Tuna pizza - Very bland. I have had this dish at many different restaurants and I can say this is something I would definitely not order again.- Seafood 'to ban yaki' with sweet prawns, scallops, king crab, bok choy,manila clams,oyster mushrooms,citrus butter - Sounds out of this world, right? No. This was also sooooo bland. We even had to tell the restaurant how bland it was. For $37, definitely not worth it. The waiter did take this off of our bill and the manager also stopped by to say she was sorry that we did not enjoy it. I really was surprised at that because usually at the trendy restaurants no one is ever aware there is even a manger working (they never personally stop by tables). Definitely a plus!+ Sushi - We ordered sushi by the piece and they had my favorite; kinmedai. Wooohoooo!+ Milk chocolate key lime pie with chocolate crunch, key lime mousse, frozen raspberry meringue - I actually usually HATE key lime pie. I just never really ever was a fan of this dessert in general. However, when you let your guest choose dessert, you cannot pick what they order. In this case, my friend picked the milk chocolate key lime pie. IT WAS PHENOMENAL. It was one of the best desserts I've ever had in my life. YOU MUST ORDER THIS. Again, did ya hear me? Must must must must!All & all, the food was really mixed. Some dishes I loved, some I really didn't enjoy. It is a nicer step up in terms of trendy restaurants and although I consider this a fusion restaurant, the sushi was pretty good.

617,jZbCRXYDyWtzM7PPiIAzYg,Daniel M.,1.0 star rating,"Sad to say, but this was among the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. Yes, I came in expecting a tourist trap, but this place failed to meet even those low expectations. As for the decor, this place must have looked nice at one time, but honestly it had a delapidated, dirty feel to it.I made my reservation through the NYC restaurant week webpage. I had to take a 5:30 Sunday reservation, but I figured no big deal, I'll get to try the place out for a reasonable cost.We were directed to the bar because our table wasn't ready. Obviously this was a way to troll for us to order drinks because the place was already open, but empty. How could a table not be ready? They sure looked ready. Anyway, I had a scotch and my wife had some kind of lemon coctail which was delicous if not overpriced ($33 for the 2 drinks). As soon as our drinks were served, literally before we even tasted them, we were told our table was ready and brought back upstairs.I asked the waitress about it and she said they did not offer the restaurant week menu for dinner and immediately called over someone who did not identify herself, but I presume was a manager.  Obviously I was not the first person to have experienced this bait and switch.  I did not complain or ask for a manager mind you. Anyway, this odd strident person came to my table and started telling me how the restaurant week menu was only for lunch and grilling me about how I made the reservation. Fine, I'm not happy about this, but it's my wife's birthday and I just want to enjoy my dinner, don't worry about it.Apparently, she was not satisfied, so she came back and started asking me specificially how I clicked through the website when I made the reservation. First, that was 2 weeks ago, do you really expect me to remember in detail? Second, I already told you I just want to have my dinner. I told her I had printed the webpage out and had it in my jacket. She actually took my coat check number and went into my jacket, on her own, and took out the printout.  She came back to the table and insultingly told me I can find ""cost effective"" menu options on their regular menu. No apology, no ""can I get you a drink"", just shut up and pay!Trying not to let this freak ruin my wife's birthday dinner, we order the bagna cauda appetizer.  This is basically some pieces of seafood and vegetable with a fondue style dipping sauce. Neither of us just enjoyed the sauce and we ended up eating the  seafood and vegetables on their own. There were fried shrimp which were very greasy, cold and soggy. Not appetizing at all. I ate a little cherry tomato and it tasted as if it had been cross-contaminated with raw fish. Just nasty.By now we were both skeptical, so instead of ordering entrees, we ordered some maki rolls to share.  My wife ordered fried soft shell crab maki and shrimp tempura maki.  Both were pretty bad primarily because this place apparently cannot fry things without leaving them greasy, cold and soggy.I orderd tuna maki and spicy yellowtail maki. These were basically standard, no complaints, though at twice the price of my local sushi joint (shout out to Sushiyama in Brooklyn).I got up to use the restrooms and another waiter was blocking the aisle. I stopped and waited for him to allow me to pass by, but he just looked at me and then ignored me, leaving me standing there, until I asked him if he could please move in a bit so I could pass by. Just rude. The restroom itself must have been georgous at one time, but is showing its age with a hole in the wall, things falling down and a generally dismal appearance. It had infinity mirrors in the stalls and a fancy toilet.My wife is a big dessert person, so we ordered the creampuffs and the bread pudding.  Of course, nothing was done for her birthday, not even a simple candle or a ""happy birthday"". I'm not expecting TGI Fridays, but it's not unusual to acknowledge a birthday in some way.  Anyway, the creampuffs were fried and, as this place apparently is incapable of frying anything, were nasty and greasy. We each tasted half of one and left the rest. It was just bad. The bread pudding was not terrible, just ok. We managed to get through almost half of it. Truthfully the fresh fruit garnish was the best part. Both desserts came with gelato which was awful. I don't know how you can mess up gelato, but I guess they are making it there and not good at it. Normally I finish off any form of ice cream, but these were also left behind.In the end, we spent $150 for a lousy experience and bad food. It's probably a good thing they didn't honor the restaurant week deal since I probably would have spent a lot more, as I typically do, ordering more drinks, extra appetizers and after dinner drinks. From time to time, we actually enjoy celebrity chef restaurants, knowing they are tourist traps, because they usually are a decent experience with good food, but this place, I'm sorry to say, was horrible.

We got the braised black cod and sushi combo which includes 5pcs of nigri and 1 maki roll. Each combo includes miso soup, salad and seasoned pickles. The miso soup was really strong, the salad was refreshing, I believe it had arugula. All of the sushi was really fresh. The maki roll was okay, I tried some of my friend's black cod, it was alright, I'm not a big fan of cooked fish. As for dessert we got coffee kuromitsu and strawberry shortcake. We both preferred the strawberry short cake. The strawberry short cake was served in a really cute bowl. It was topped with a scoop of sesame ice cream, they used a mix of freeze dry and fresh strawberries. It was really creamy and the crust at the bottom was a nice touch. Great blend of flavors. The coffee kuromitsu was okay, I'm not a big coffee person or a whipped cream person. I liked the texture of the kuromitsu though, it tasted like flan. The coffee bits was a nice touch to the flan. A note on the atmosphere and environment. The interior design here is A+ I love the lighting and the minimalism. The atmosphere is really cozy and refreshing. I recommend checking out the bathroom downstairs. They use japanese toilets but rest assured it's not the one that cleans your arse. Inside the stool is so cool.

There is a big red curtain with Japanese lettering on it with glass doors behind. Once you walk in, you notice the beautiful, clean décor with the white walls, ceiling drapes and glass partitions/walls throughout the dining room. The restaurant is modern looking and keeps the atmosphere classy-casual with its casual dress code. Jackets are not required for men, but keep it clean with a button-down shirt and dress shoes and you'll fit right in. The tables are made out of wood, but there is a glossy look to them to give off a clean, yet contemporary feel. The noise level was pretty average as it wasn't loud, but you could definitely hear people chatting on the low side.As for food, we had the Oyster Foie Gras for an appetizer and the Seafood 'Toban Yaki'  and the Duck, Duck, Duck for entrees. The oyster foie gras came with 3 pieces of raw oysters drowned in teriyaki sauce. The freshness of the oysters were undeniable and the teriyaki sauce added a nice salty kick to it. The Seafood ""Toban Yaki' came with a Half shell lobster, king crab, mussel, clam, diver scallop mixed in red miso-sake broth. Once again, the individual ingredients were so refreshing it was like they just grabbed it right out of the ocean! In addition, there was some greens mixed in for you vegetable lovers. The Duck, Duck, Duck consisted of 3 separate pieces on 1 plate. The 3 pieces were a Foie gras croissant, a roast duck and a soft duck egg with red miso sauce. The Foie gras croissant was very interesting as I'm not a huge fan of Foie gras, but it was so soft and the flavoring on it was excellent. It made me forget I was even eating Foie gras! The duck was very moist, but to be quite honest, I could probably get a duck like this in Chinatown. The soft duck egg was really an afterthought as I thought it just added a nice bright color to the plate, but nonetheless I still enjoyed it because it's food after all.Overall, it's a beautiful, modern, contemporary restaurant. The crowd is very trendy, but not overly conservative-looking. The food is really good, but hard to say if it will blow anyone away. I can see why it's a popular, successful restaurant, however considering who owns it, I came away expecting a bit more with the food.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

They apologized for the wait and started us off with a complimentary appetizer which was the Tuna Pizza (raw tuna, olives, anchovy aioli, jalapeños) and it was very good. We also ordered the Chef Selected Market Oysters (half dozen) which were prepared three ways: two with fish sauce, two with garlic and ginger and two with jalapeños, Toro Tartar (tuna, caviar, sour cream, guacamole, wasabi, dashi soy) and a California Roll all of wich was beautifully presented.

We were a party of 2 and had 3 apps, 1 entree, and 1 dessert all shared. We started with a morimoto sashimi (3.5/5) because pictures from the past made it look amazing (everything was stacked on each other and it seemed to be quite large in size), but the dish we got was separated but we were told beforehand they were redoing the plating. However it seemed like the portion size was drastically reduced as well (maybe the price decreased too from the original, i dunno) but anyway the sashimi itself was pretty good despite the potions being much smaller than I was expecting.Next we had the oyster foie gras (5/5) which was TO DIE FOR. It had uni and some hot sauce  on top and the dish was warm. I never realized how much I prefer warm raw oysters until I had this combo and burst of flavor in my mouth. Seriously the best take on oyster I have EVER had.We also had wagyu beef carpaccio (3.5/5) I thought i was ordering a wagyu beef crostini (stupid/embarrassing mistake) which is what I actually wanted but this was still a decent dish. I did not appreciate the amount of oil they used ( a combination of sesame, olive, and some other light oils) so I dabbed the beef on the side of the dish a few times before eating it. The  beef itself was very tender and strong in flavor. ]Then we got the entree duck duck duck (5/5) as you may have read from other reviews. This duck is amazing, one part is roasted, another looks to be lightly fried and put into a sandwich with really light airy bread, and there was a duck egg dip (along with pork miso dip and hoisin sauce dip). All 3 dips were amazing and I highly recommend you try this entree (shared or not). I know usually the word ""sandwich"" at a classy place such is total hit or miss but in this case, its a direct hit.Finally for dessert we got apple bread pudding (4/5) with green tea crumble, brown butter ice cream. The presentation was gorgeous, and came with a fruit side. Very flavorful, the green tea crumble was interesting, great ice cream.We ordered cinnamon cider and white lily cocktails, both were great (4/5).Also the decor (5/5) of this place as you can see from the photos is top notch, service was very friendly and waiters are extremely knowledgeable about the menu.For what we got, final bill was just over $200 including top and tax, it is a $$$$ yelp place so you are expecting this range.

628,9oFKlZXUDomjO7vfc0YBxQ,Jasmine X.,5.0 star rating,"Probably one of the better meals that I've had in a long, long time. At a hefty price though.I was in New York for a weekend and was looking for a good dinner spot to celebrate a friend's birthday. After scouring through a combination of Zagat articles and Yelp reviews, it seemed like Morimoto was going to be the best choice of a restaurant that would sufficiently blow my mind for the amount of money that I was paying. Luckily enough, I was able to make a reservation for dinner at 6pm on a Saturday on a Thursday. I definitely was not disappointed.My friend and I got the omasake--my first omasake yuuum. 1. Toro Tartar--such an interesting presentation and a lot of fun. It's flattened out and then there are six different seasonings that you scoop up with the tartar. I was particularly fond of the crunchy rice balls and the seaweed condiments. There was also a seaweed like paste, sour cream, avocado, and something that reminded me a bit of a ceviche flavor. Mmmm delicious. 2. Sashimi in hot oil--the hot oil was such an excellent touch to this. Can't remember what kind of sashimi it was but it was topped with mixed greens. I wrapped the mixed greens with my sashimi, lathered it up in the hot oil and it was fantastic. Really interesting touch to sashimi that I've never had before. 3. Fondue with vegetables--the fondue was really beautifully presented and was paired with a variety of vegetables hams, and bread. Fondue was alright--it was cheesy but also had a bit of an Asian flavor to it.4. Assorted Nigiri--yum yum! Excellently sized and fresh. You know that a restaurant knows what they're doing when you pick the sashimi off the rice and see the little ball of wasabi underneath.5. Oyster with uni and foie gras--really interesting take on oyster. The flavor of the oyster was a bit heavy for me but still a delightful dish.6. Mango palate cleansers! yummm. A cute little popsicle7. Wagyu steak and a grilled lobster. Steak was on a delicious bed of yams and was a perfect medium rare sear. Mmmm. Grilled lobster was also perfection and spiced with some Indian curry but still soooo good. They had another sauce to slather onto the lobster. It was two yummy meaty chunks.8. Dessert! Chocolate souffle with blueberry ice cream in a champagne flavored foam?? Excellent. The chocolate in the souffle seeped out perfectly after I had it and the champagne and blueberry ice cream went really well with how hot the souffle was.Really couldn't have asked for a better meal. Throughout the meal, the kitchen got a bit backed up so it took them a little longer to get some of the dishes out. Waiters were extremely kind and attentive to our needs. Since we were celebrating my friend's birthday, they melted a wax candle onto the dessert plate which was a classy, elegant touch. Final bill ended up being hefty, but the quality of the food and the fantastic service was absolutely worth it.

Check out the pictures of those surreal appearance of food. If you couldn't appreciate them, all I can say is that you might not be an artist by heart. What's above and beyond is the fusion with French cuisine: fondue with veggies and sausages, oyster foie gras and uni...Interior decor of Morimoto is futuristic. The lighting fixtures are particularly excellent, but details matter, right? As a a customer and outsider, I hope Morimoto could improve the seating arrangement, as well as lots of details in the decoration, such as brightness in certain area of the dining seating area, and the ugly table counter in women's bathroom.

Good but nothing fancy. 3 different varieties on separate plates along with some broth for dipping. We then shared grilled asparagus with shiitake mushrooms, a spicy yellowtail roll and Uni (sea urchin) sushi. All were very good. Spicy yellowtail wasn't smothered in mayo. It was legit. The Uni was so delicious I can't even find words to properly describe it. Best Uni I've ever had. We had sea bass in miso sauce and a Korean style bowl of rice with yellowtail. Both were good.

634,lHgNf1GVKUogXqZEEqBnMA,Ali M.,5.0 star rating,"IN SHORT: From the food to the setting, Morimoto is one of the most beautiful meals you will ever eat. And yes, you do have to check out the restrooms.THE STORY: Everything about Morimoto is stunning. From the first steps inside what feels like the white, calcified fossil of a whale's ribcage to the wall of glass bottles lining the staircase, and from the sweeping interior space with bright, sexy views of the sushi bar to the bathrooms downstairs, whose warm, mirrored walls are hard to explain on paper, the restaurant itself is a testament to the shiny, elegant interior design than has populated the neighborhood.All of these touches stand as a backdrop , however, to a menu so thoughtfully crafted by the Iron Chef himself. While the $135 Morimoto Omakase tasting menu is a worthwhile indulgence, the long sushi menu and main courses from $29-$39 offer a decadent range of expert options as well. For my most recent visit, I started with the Morimoto Sashimi that featured seared toro, salmon, tuna, hamachi, and wild shrimp in an artful display of quality and texture. One of the best and most exciting main courses offered is the Ishi Yaki Buri Bop, a yellowtail tuna on rice cooked in front of you at your table in a hot stone bowl. The bowl feels massively induglent compared to other, tighter sushi courses, but it is full of delicious surprises like alternating floral and herbaceous notes mixing with the flaky, citrusy fish. The Sea Bass with a sweet sake kasu, Japanese eggplant, and miso is also perfectly cooked and full of nuanced flavor.While the scene at Morimoto on a Friday or Saturday night might evoke more of a swanky club atmosphere less suitable for dinner with parents, there will always be local guests visiting solely for the quality of the Japanese food, and during the week, the space seems perfectly fitting for a special occasion worthy of such a beautiful setting.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I was treated to a omakase at Morimoto for my 24th birthday. Someone must think I'm REALLY special, I'm working on having their mental state evaluated...Made a reservation for two on a weekday evening, it probably wasn't needed seeing that even when we left at 8:30PM there were open tables. We ordered one omakase dinner and then shared a la carte; this is a great idea for any two diners looking for a well rounded experience of Chef Morimoto's food. I found overall that the cooked seafood dishes really shined in comparison to the sushi. Considering the price point I would venture to say the raw fish had me a bit disappointed...with the exception of the fantastic oyster (kumamoto oyster, foie gras, uni in a teriyaki sauce over sea salt). Our meal went something like this: -- Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura in 3 sauces different spicy/savory sauces...This was like a souped up version of any rock shrimp that you've seen on a Japanese menu elsewhere in Manhattan. Crunchy, fiery, fun.-- Toro Tartare in a Bamboo Box with Caviar and 6 Condiments, finished with a Japanese Berry...One of the signature dishes at Morimoto; incredibly fresh with the condiments adding unique flavor profiles to each bite of tuna. Only thing that's a bit upsetting is a smaller size is served with the omakase meal. -- Basic Vegetable Salad...Seemed like a strange choice that would be better off removed from the meal with the price adjusted accordingly. -- Oyster Foie Gras (kumamoto oyster, foie gras, uni in a teriyaki sauce) over Sea Salt. Really fresh--I'm not even an oyster fan and I was beyond impressed with the quality and prep.-- Fresh, Steamed Chicken with Fresh Vegetables...Another bizarre choice for the omakase menu but very tasty in it's simplicity. -- Fluke Carpaccio, Sashimi Sampling, Roll Samples...While I wasn't blow away by any of these, they were a big step up from you local hole-in-the-wall. -- Melon Palette Cleanser...This was a sign that I was in over my head at a restaurant. I am not this fancy. Is this necessary? Probably not. But it was tasty and will make you feel like a fancy rich person? -- Seared Wagyu Beef with Sweet Potatoes coupled with Lobster in a Half-Shell...This was the ULTIMATE surf-and-turf and perhaps my favorite part of the meal. The serving size was plentiful and everything on the plate was fantastically seasoned.-- Chocolate Cake Dessert...Not memorable, but certainly passable. My final assessment on Morimoto, it's a great experience. A bit too trendy for plain folks like us, but it was worth the money for the fun of it. When it comes to experiencing a fresh fish omakase I would stick to a place like Sushi of Gari or Tanoshi Sushi. When adding the element of fresh Japanese dishes, Morimoto's cuisine DOES reign supreme (sorry, had to).",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

In my 10+ years of eating Sushi, I've never enjoyed that particular item in any sushi restaurant anywhere. I've been converted by Morimoto and would bet a lot of money that they have one of, if not THE best Egg Custards in the city. Why the 1 star deduction? The duo of lamb chops entree was just, ok.

Ever since I first started getting into food and blogging it's been on the top of my bucket list of things I must do before I shuffle off this mortal coil.  I was excited, of course, to go to New York since I've never been before, but finally getting to go to Morimoto was the icing on the cake. We started with the Toro tartare.  This slab of beauty is garnished with caviar that you spread throughout and I paired with a dipping sauce and 6 toppings.  You dip it in a lil bit of this and then you top it with a lil bit of that...so delicious!  I was so overwhelmed that I wasn't paying attention to the waiter when he was explaining the different sauces and toppings.  Each topping had different flavor profiles and complimented the toro in different ways ...a definite must try! I wish it was a bigger slab!!!Next we had a ten hour cooked pork belly with congee and soy scallion jus - a modern twist to traditional Kakuni. Sweet and savory melt in your mouth in perfect harmony and just when you think its rich flavors are done, you cut into crispy textures that pull you back in! Loooved it!We then had the crispy rock shrimp tempura.  Erny wanted to order it and I wasn't quite sure why.  With so many unique and interesting items on the menu I was like...shrimp tempura? Really? I was pleasantly suprised by how amazeballs these things were! One was glazed with spicy kochujang sauce that blows hot wings out of the water; the other had wasabi aoli...I was eating these things like butter popcorn topped with crack. So addicting!Erny ordered the Duck Duck Duck for his main entree. It's ingredients say it all...foie gras croissant, roasted duck, a poached duck egg, and 2 dipping sauces. Zomg.  It was very rich and fatty...heaven.I ordered the roasted maine lobster topped with veggies, keffir lime, and green curry sauce. So many incredible flavors yet they didn't take away from the subtle richness of the lobster. My heart melted. *swoon*Erny and I had an incredible meal.  I was smiling the entire time!  I cannot wait to come back and try more things!  Although it ain't cheap, I highly recommended checking it out on your next trip to New York!(Photos courtesy Erny n Me....but mostly Erny.)",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
650,Q8KEm9D4tb42o7MT00DSmA,Sara L.,5.0 star rating,"A much needed review update for Morimoto. Iron Chef Morimoto simply cannot disappoint. Enter through the red curtain entrance of Morimoto and prepare to be allured by the modern and contemporary appeal of the grand interior. Sweeping white ceiling drapes, a crystal barrier in the center, white furniture, wooden tables, provide an exquisite, classy landscape for any dining occasion. As you make your way down the stairs to the lower floor, enter the ultra chic and hip bar, open during the evenings. A fancy venue, but the service here is unpretentious. Contemporary Japanese with Western elements combined, the food here is not what you call authentic Japanese. In any case, the unique fusion style is near flawless. The food goes beyond fantastic and is also simply artistic. Some notable dishes include the Morimoto Sashimi, Waygu Beef, Chilean Sea Bass, Black Cod Miso. They also offer the Morimoto Omakase ($125), which is ""chef's choice"", a true Morimoto dining experience meant to serve an entire table. Regarding the rest of the menu, it's impossible to go wrong with any order. The aforementioned raw appetizer, the Morimoto Sashimi, has become a favorite of mine. It is a combined and layered assortment of thinly, perfectly sliced sashimi with seven sauces served in tiny droppers. Exquisite, a work of art on plate, and a grand starter to your meal; it is a serving of salmon, toro, eel, hamachi, tuna, and eel. For main, the Chilean Sea Bass with grilled, seasonal vegetables has become a preferred dish of mine. Other fish entree, the Black Cod Miso is equally delectable. For those who like beef, the Waygu filet is a wonderful choice, served sizzling hot off an iron plate. It's an extremely juicy, flavorful tender steak with a side of perfectly steamed, seasoned bok choy to accompany. For those who want a preview of Morimoto without breaking the bank, I highly recommend their Restaurant Week pre-fixe $25 lunch special, available Monday through Friday. Without a doubt, Morimoto's pre-fixe is perhaps one of the best ones you'll experience in the city. The special is a choice between two bento boxes, Sea Bass or the Waygu Beef filet. The bento box includes a variety of sushi rolls, salad, vegetable tempura, and miso soup. Lastly, they give you two different options for dessert. Last visit, I had a Black Sesame Panna Cotta, beautifully presented and unique in taste. I had the Sea Bass bento box in my past two Restaurant Week visits, and it has been consistently satisfactory. No formula has ever changed. If considering a non-alcoholic beverage, try the Morimoto Iced Tea, a combination of refreshing iced tea, Calpico, and muddled blueberries.Consistency is key at Morimoto. I've always noticed how the dishes are artfully, cleanly presented, and the food always tastes as good as it looks. I am a huge fan of Morimoto, and this comes from many visits.

Came for lunch restaurant week menu (didn't have to ask for it, it was already included with the regular menu---super plus)Got the cod and friend got the waygu beef. We were surprised how big the waygu beef was--bigger than the fish O.O! The waygu beef came with a lot of different condiments on the side such as sautéed mushroom and a flavorless baby green pepper. Beef was cooked perfectly with a nice seared on the outside. Again, no wow factor, just a perfectly cooked waygu beef, flavored salt & pepper, it's something I can find at a steak restaurant.Fish was a bit disappointing for me and didn't live up to the hype. It's flavored well, cooked perfectly, a tat salty but overall not bad but not amazing. The black things are bean--tasted like a cross of red bean and black bean. The colorful pepper stripes didn't add to anything.Both dishes came with miso soup, salad, seaweed/sweet tofu skin, and pickled cucumbers, and rice.We were here anyways, so why not splurge on their infamous $31 toro tartare? The toro was fresh and the typical regular tasting toro tartare. What was unique about it and that made the bite interesting was the sauce provided. You dip into the soy then into one of the 6 sauces/topping combo. Any way you mix and matched it, it's was a blast of unique flavor in the mouth! FIrst timer- must get! --- I love the wasabi- fresh and a hint of sweetness =) Dessert- got both the coffee panna cotta and the lemon pistachio mouse cake. Both cooked perfectly at the right consistency. Flavor-wise --- Not wow but still very good.We were stuffed by then. I think the dessert did the trick.Another tip, check out the bathroom.

It was a restaurant I wouldn't come back to because it was just mediocre food at a very expensive price. I ordered two entrees, duck & their lobster and neither of them impressed me. I gave it 3 stars, 1 for their amazing decor and the other 2 for their decent food. There was nothing special about it. It was food you can eat anywhere else and it would taste the same.I said I wouldn't be back here again but I came back last Friday because of a girlfriends birthday. Boy am I glad I did because this time around I LOVED the food!!! I definitely ordered the wrong items last time. I started off with their morimoto ice tea and it was lightly sweetened and very refreshing. For appetizers,Oyster Foie Gras -  Oysters with foie gras and uni on top --- I'm use to squeezing lemon juice on my oysters but this one didn't come with lemons. It tasted like the OCEAN! It's a nice combination but I don't think this is for anyone who can't stand the ocean taste. It came with 3 oysters for $21 which is pretty pricey. Sauteed Foie Gras & Grilled Eel -- OH HEAVEN! The pairing of the two is perfection. I'm a big foie gras fan and morimoto definitely made it the best best best! It was like warm butter that melted in your mouth except it was foie gras. I felt like I wanted to order another one! This was  $24 and it was worth every penny.Miso Glazed Bone Marrow -- I don't think i've ever had bad bone marrow but this one was definitely different than the rest. It was Japanese style bone marrow with sake ikura on it mmm yummy. For entree,Ishi Yaki Buri Bop - Yellow tail on rice in a hot stone bowl -- It's like the korean bibimbap except its with raw yellow tail. I did not like this one bit. It was like warm but cold, like half cooked sushi. The flavor was bland. Maybe I needed to put some wasabi and soysauce on it. I barely touched this.Sushi/Sashimi - Eel avocado roll, very fresh and perfectly riped avocado. Definitely an upgrade from the ones you usually eat a sushi restaurantSea urchin Uni - WAAAA MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH ! Super super fresh slimey uni. Loved! I can eat 10 of these. Awabi sashimi - ABALONE for sushi ... what !??! Yeah raw abalone sashimi, a first timer for this one! It was scrumptious!!!! I will be on the search for awabi at jap restaurants from now but I rarely see it on the menu. It was $10 for 1 piece of sashimi but it was definitely worth it.

The hostess offered us a seat at the bar downstairs until our table was ready.At the bar I had a drink consisting of prosecco, st. germain, and something else that I can't remember. But what I do remember is that it was delicious, and that's what counts. Right after I had finished my drink a hostess came down to the bar area to let us know our table was ready. I was impressed with how attentive the staff was.Now, for what you guys really care about. My boyfriend and I split a shrimp tempura appetizer that was amazing. I'm glad we split this because it was way too much for one person.  For an entree we had chirashi sushi, which again was more than enough food for one person.  The sushi was incredibly fresh. Service was great as well, even though the place looked extremely busy.I would go back!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
658,4kHQQ2DP_G1nYTUnl9zNCw,Cuppy E.,4.0 star rating,"I was doing some shopping in the meatpacking district so I decided to go to Morimoto. I've been here at least 6 times before and the food is always excellent. I always stick to the appetizers and hot dishes because I find the sushi/sashimi to be either a hit or a miss. I went to the Philly location last year and I thought their sashimi tasted better than the one here. I ordered the Tuna pizza and the crispy rock shrimp tempura as my appetizers and they were amazing. The rock shrimp are covered in two different sauces and comes with a dipping aioli on the side. The tuna pizza was very good as well although it's a bit messy to eat.For my entree, I ordered the tempura calamari salad and an order of the oyster foie gras. Truth be told, I usually come here only for the oysters. This dish is often imitated but never duplicated. OMG. These oysters are fantastic. If you love uni, oysters and foie gras, then this is the dish for you. It combines the perfect balance of sweet salty creaminess with warm oysters. What's not to love. The salad is huge and it comes with several chunks of calamari and it has a delicious white miso dressing. I ordered two cocktails. The white lily and the morimotini and I found the white lily to be the better of the two. It's sweeter whereas the morimotini tasted like pure vodka and cucumbers. Order it if you prefer your drinks to be on the stronger side.Overall, I would recommend this place as it has something for everyone, even meat eaters. I've had their steaks in the past and they were amazing. They could use a remodeling for the upstairs and the lounge area. Some parts of the restaurant look dingy and bare. The waitstaff were attentive and service was solid.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
659,x3sL7htE8xgWDePwLxx-1Q,Cerca T.,5.0 star rating,"I don't think Morimoto needs glowing review #1964, but I owe it to all you peons, as I sit on my ivory white horse atop Mount Pious. This place is classy and impeccable, the service is as good as you can imagine and the food is really worth the hype. Came here for a company dinner, all 30+ of us served family-style. Here's my comprehensive (yet poetic) review: ::clears throat::Drinks+ White Lily Shirayuri - a grapefruit/yuzu-type cocktail. Refreshing, not too sweet+ Morimoto version of a Negroni - nice and citrusy, delicious! I believe it was called a ""Horoginai?"" something like thatAppetizers+ Chef-Selected Raw Bar - a gorgeous, round platter of Kumamoto oysters, lobster tails and claws and big pieces of crab. Beyond fresh and tender. The oysters were briny, delicious. These platters were devoured.+ Kakuni (10-hour slow roasted pork) - served on a bed of congee and crispy noodle things on top. This pork just melts in your mouth and the soy/scallion jus makes it even better. This ain't your mama's slowcooker pork.+ Tuna Pizza - hyyyuuunnnggghhhhhhh, just give me this all the time. A crispy, thin base, covered in the freshest, brightest tuna that simply melts in your mouth, adorned with sliced tomatoes, olives and jalapeno. Wasabi aoli and micro cilantro on top. I mean, this goes for $19 on the regular menu, and I could just eat 5 of these. Right now. At 10am. (Micro cilantro??? who am I?)+ Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura - I had the privilege of sitting right in front of this thing, and I think I nibbled on it for over an hour. A bunch of wasabi-coated, tempura-battered, heavenly deep-fried rock shrimps and the other, slathered in delectable gochujang (a Korean sriracha, if you will). HEAVEN. This was a play on buffalo wings, cuz it was served with a ranch dipping sauce (lol) with matching celery for dipping (lol). Delicious, crispy, fresh, just really good. A table favorite, for sure.Mains+ Chef's Selected Sushi - we each split 5 assorted pieces of sushi, 1 cucumber roll and 1 yellowtail jalapeno roll (it could have been toro, but not sure). Really nice palate cleanser in between all the bold flavors. The cucumber roll you could skip, but that yellowtail/toro was like butter. Perfectly rolled, the rice wasn't too clumpy or sticky, and the fish was impeccable. Nice hit of spice at the end. Glad I got to try some basics here - they are exactly as good as you'd expect. (I thought I found my amazing sushi in Park Slope and am now ruined forever. Thanks, Morimoto.)+ Braised Black Miso Cod - this was a gorgeous cod filet, seemingly basted forever in a glorious ginger soy reduction. It was caramelized, yet tender and perfectly cooked. Flaked apart just by looking at it. Really superb.+ Prime Aged NY Strip - a solid piece of meat, cooked about medium. As it landed on the table, our server hit it with a splash of onion and garlic jus, which steamed the slices up and gave it a little kick of flavor. It was certainly delicious, but it was just OK compared to everything else. That being said, I've had better steak in many places. (I think NY needs to be medium-rare, max. Too chewy.)+ Sides - Chinese broccoli (my favorite thing ever) and bok choy, both perfectly cooked and mouthwateringly delicious.Dessert+ Green Tea Mille Crepe - light, creamy, heavenly. Not too much matcha flavor, which I was grateful for. At this point, I was ready to roll out of there, so I didn't focus too much on the dessert. But the pieces are big enough to split, for sure. Served with a little ball of Ferrero Rocher gelato and some crispy rice (cute).+ Banana Cream Puffs - some basic cream puffs (yawn), but it had chunks of caramelized bananas on top, with roasted banana gelato. The extra stuff of top was super yummy. Also, there was Cracker Jacks around it - very cool dessert. Had to make room for this one :)Overall, a superb dinner and real great experience. The drinks were strong, the service was great and it was all made better by being surrounded by close friends and coworkers. I recommend this place for any special occasion, certainly an anniversary or the like. Really worth it.Notes: They seriously lack bathrooms in this place. For such a big place, they only have a single restroom upstairs and only 2 more downstairs. That's about it.Also: You can actually get a doggy bag - don't be shy. I have some NY strip and Chinese broccoli waiting for me at home... :)::sigh:: now I return to my mediocre Park Slope sushi and dream of one day returning to Morimoto....",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The waiter described what it was served with - I was like - are you kidding me?  It was one tiny square (when you dice a pepper) of a red, green and yellow pepper.  I mean...why even bother.  No rice, nothing.Do not come here hungry!The halibut with black bean broth was too salty, small, but at least the fish was fresh.Personally I am done spending a lot of $$ on such tiny portions where the food quality isn't at all what it should be for the cost.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

It usually ranged from mostly passable to good which is the only reason I gave two instead of one stars. I used to live around the corner and came here three times before I learned my lesson, gave up and just stuck with Naka Naka. The ambiance is slick and overdone, I think. It's ultra modern and space-loungey and all around trying WAY too hard to be tragically hip and ending up just being tragic. There's something a LOT more douchey about the wait staff who were by and large horrible. I often felt like informing them that I lived around the corner and would be a regular customer were they only to give decent service, but knew it would make no impact. They were snobby, gross, mean, dismissive and often the wait was long. Do yourself a favor and skip this place. If you are in the neighborhood, go to Naka Naka instead.

The downstairs washrooms are a giggle, too!My only complaint: our server was not very accomplished, seemingly hurried for no reason whilst not listening to us, and never around.

The presentation was clever but really, in the end, very disappointing. The amount of tuna in this dish would amount to not even a tablespoon.  But they slather the tuna into a paper thin layer on this chrome platter. Now if the one tablespoon of tuna was off-the-chart tasty, then maybe I would be singing a different song, but this was just ordinary tuna mash.  Not even top quality. I know top quality.  Before coming to Morimoto, my family and I went on a high-end sushi-eating binge at some of the best sushi places. Our trip started in LA and I'm going to give you the names of the sushi joints in LA because they deserve to be mentioned because they make Morimoto seem like an amateur.If you get the chance, visit these sushi places in LA (in this order)1)  Nobu2) Sugarfish3) HaneBack to the review...ROCK SHRIMP TEMPURA--Good, but this is Morimoto.  Expected a lot better than just OK.SPICY TUNA ROLL--Not up to par.  Just like you would get in any regular sushi place. In fact, we had a spicy tuna roll in an airport that beat this one.OMAKASE (Chef's assorted nigiri pieces)--Every one of these paled deeply in comparison to the sushi we had at the previously mentioned sushi restaurants.  The quality just wasn't there.I don't mind paying good $$$ when the quality is there.  But paying bookoo bucks for run-of-the-mill sushi hurts.It was honestly a very surreal experience.  I couldn't believe I was eating average sushi in Morimoto's restaurant.Was it a bad day?  Maybe.  Sushi chef sick?  Who knows.  But for whatever reason, we were all very disappointed.  And if Morimoto sat at that table, eating the food we ate, he would be disappointed too.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We were seated pretty quickly and sat comfortably with the view of the glass bottle back drop and the sushi bar/ kitchen area. I got a ton suggestions and tips from people who've been here (surprisingly, many people have said to skip their sushi...) and instead of going for the omakase menu (as advised and with a leap of faith) we decided to with 4 appetizers, 2 entrees, a dessert and an order of sake (plenty filling for 2...if you walk in hungry)! Appetizers:Toro Tartare - a must try! It's yummy and fun to eat! The whole dish just melts into your mouth.  Zen Sai - an assortment of seasonal Japanese delicacies which included food from the land and the sea (see pics below)! It was again, beautifully assembled and yummyIshi Yaki (hot appetizer)- a beautiful assortment of sauces and dip to go with tender and delicate waygu beef slices, though I thought the dish was pretty and fun to eat, it was not one of my favorites.. Miso glazed roasted bone marrow - Love love love, this dish is a steal compared to the rest of the menu and a must try! Wonderfully cooked and seasoned! Entrees - I was a little less impressed with the entrees after having an assortment of appetizers but still very good...! We got the Ishi Yaki Bury Bop (which tasted duller than the appetizers and was not my favorite nor the best bury bop I've had) and the duck duck duck (was just okay, I was also getting too full at this point) Dessert - Matcha tiramisu, which was good  Overall, we did get to save a little by skipping the omakase and I really enjoyed being here (and as a comparison it was a much better experience than megu...)P.S. this place is conveniently located next to the high line...perfect for walking it off!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

One thing that noticed about Japanese or Asian restaurants is that the restroom are usually interesting. Morimoto has an extremely hard to pull/push door to open but its very cute. The setting is kinda intimate, semi dim lighting and not loud. Now on to the food, We ordered the rock shrimp for apps, which was way better than Buddakan's rock shrimp! Seared scallop (for apps also ), which was soft and well seasoned. Entree, I had the salmon with a side of bok choy, unfortunately my salmon and bok choy was not spectacular or different from any other sushi spot in NYC. My Bf  ordered the Sea bass with a side of asparagus, unfortunately he did not enjoy it, he stated that the sea bass cut was too big, I actually enjoyed his meal.

On to Drinks, a bottle of sake and lychee martini, I'm a fan of lychee martini, I NEED THAT ALL THE TIME IN MY LIFE LOL.

Needless to say, we had a great time here. For appetizers, we had the Toro Tartare, the Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura, and the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio. I felt that the Toro Tartare was my least favorite of the three (not saying that it's bad, just not my favorite) because it was small and the flavor didn't provide any ""wow-factor"". However, the presentation was nice. The Rock Shrimp Tempura was excellent. The tempura didn't feel oily or flaky at all. It was light  and it provided a nice crispy texture to the shrimp. I also greatly enjoyed the carpaccio. It was my first time having Wagyu Beef and I must say, I can see where the hype derives from. It's so tender and it melts in your mouth. For entrees, I had the Sea Bass and she had the Surf and Turf. Out of the two, we both preferred the Sea Bass. The portion was nicely sized, the fish was delicious, and the avocado tempura was incredible. The gf greatly dislikes eggplant, but the eggplant that came with the Sea Bass dish tasted more like plantain than eggplant. Therefore, she actually LIKED it. The Surf and Turf was just ""good"" at best. Beef was lightly charred and tasty, while the hamachi ribbons had a nice kick with the jalapenos in the crushed citrus and avocado sauce it came with. However, it wasn't an awe-inducing dish. So, a little about myself: I am NOT a huge fan of dessert. However, I decided to get the Tofu Cheesecake and she ordered the Chilled Cheesecake Souffle. And... WOW. The Tofu Cheesecake was so light, fluffy, and not overly-sweet. It comes with a few chocolate flakes on top to add a bit of sweetness. The fruits and ice cream adds a nice touch to the dish as well. I tried some of the Chilled Cheesecake and that was amazing as well. I think I would have to say that dessert just may have been my favorite part of the meal!

If it were not for salt, then the chef would literally not know how to cook. I drank an entire bottle of water and two green teas to try to get my mouth to stop tasting salt. But it didn't help. The damage was done. Appetizers:- Tuna Tartar - delicious and great presentation. (sadly, it is absolutely NOTHING when compared to that of Zuma)- Yu-burrata - AMAZING! probably the reason I give this place 2 stars instead of none- Wagyu Beef Carpaccio - extremely salted but very soft- Diver Scallop Ceviche - great presentation and tasteSpicy Tuna Roll - yes, I know, typical... but very goodMain:- Duck Duck Duck - interesting and well made- 20 oz. Australian Wagyu Ribeye with white truffle (extra) - HORRIBLE! More salt than I've ever had on a steak! It was like tasting salted rubber! I don't think I've ever actually sent a steak back, but this one, well, I had no other choice! It was upsetting seeing the white truffles leave my sight, but the steak forced me to consume water and green tea to just fight off the salt. It looked so pretty, yet was such a disappointment!

My sister told the waitress to bring bday cake out to ""the girl who is seated in between the two young men"" but presented the birthday cake to one of the guys at the table!!! My fiancé is allergic to shellfish and TWICE they placed a shellfish dish in front of him and we had to remind them he was allergic. More than twice one of the people in our party was served a good five minutes after everyone else.  We waited 30 minutes in between each dish which is NOT normal for omakase, we were there for hours on hours.  We waited for drinks 25 minutes multiple times.  All of this is so unacceptable for what is supposed to be a top notch restaurant, especially at this price.The food itself was good but our main dish which was surf and turf was served ice cold!

We started with some sashimi and maki.  The salmon and yellowtail sashimi was incredibly fresh.  The lobster kimchi maki was delicious with just enough kick.  The asparagus and soft shell crab maki was also incredible as was the spicy salmon.For my meal, I got the seafood toban yaki.  It's so good that I have not been able to bring myself to get anything else the last few times.  It's loaded with seafood and the red miso broth tastes like lobster bisque but is lighter and not nearly as bad for you!  My wife had the duck, duck, duck which had a delicious duck breast croissant and then the thigh with different sauces.  It was excellent.The dessert this time was stunning though.  Green tea tiramisu.  Insane.  A smooth creamy green tea paste at the bottom, then green tea cake, then sour cherries, topped with a mascarpone cream and green tea crumbles.  Never had a tiramisu like this.  Put even my mom's homemade tiramisu to shame.There's a reason why I come to Morimoto every time I can when am in NYC!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I loved this place because:- the decor is simple, elegant and beautiful- service was spectacular. it's the service you'd expect at a nice, but also hip establishment. - the food was extremely creative. a few highlights:     * The burrata was so delicious (think explosive amazingness (that's what she said) when you cut into it. it's like a molten lava cake except fatty and buttery and tasty cheese comes out. On top: truffle and wasabi. a very unexpected flavor combination that worked so well on the (very) buttered and oiled toasts      * Surf and turf - perfectly cooked wagyu beef served with ""hamachi ribbons"" that are in a guac-like presentation with .. tomatoes! super delish      * oysters... STEAMED (they look raw when you first look at them) with foie gras and umi on top. it's the most blow-your-mind mouthful of ocean, butter, and cream all at once. the oysters were huge.I will admit I was surprised by the mixed crowd. I came here after having cocktails at the Top of the Standard .. and the first thing my boyfriend said was 'why are there SO many kids?!"" I thought this would be an uber hip dinner that was a lotta cocktails (I wasn't too wowed by them) and a see be seen type place.

We started with drinks; she had the Morimoto iced tea, which was interesting (in a good way) and I tried the orange blossom cocktail and it was so good. I can tell how amazing a bartender is by how little I can detect the sting of alcohol in a cocktail (while still getting tipsy) and this drink tasted like sparkling orange juice and I got quite a buzz so kudos to the bartender.For our appetizer, we ordered the toro tartare which was SO good. You can go to youtube and search for ""Best Thing I Ever Ate Toro Tartare"" to see Duff (from ""Ace of Cakes"") describe his experience eating the dish. It was one of the most unique, decadent, amazing dishes I've ever eaten.We tried the wagyu beef bento box and the braised black cod bento box ($25, great deal for the amount of food). The beef and cod were both a bit too salty for our tastes but I loved everything else. I was surprised to see actual sushi being served with the bento (instead of something lame like a California roll) and the salad was vibrant and fresh and topped with what looked and tasted like deep fried orange blossom petals. The bento boxes come with dessert too - panna cotta, which was light, creamy, and yummy.We also ordered a salmon skin roll, which was prepared perfectly.To end our meal, we got the flourless chocolate cake (recommended by our awesome waitress). Because even though the bento boxes came with dessert, we were at Morimoto! Why not go all out? It was served with caramel popcorn and green tea pear sorbet and it was so good.The staff were all really personable and attentive and our waitress was so friendly and nice and we loved her.Lastly, I need to comment on how lovely the bathrooms were.

I think this may be the fanciest place I've ever dined at... but don't quote me on it. Came here after stopping by Chelsea Market and had dinner plans for Morimoto. Just uttering the name as it leaves the tip of my tongue already gives me mind-numbing goosebumps. Came as a party of 4 and upon sitting down I already noticed the partition was clear glass, but later I noticed it frosted over... some kind of voodoo magic to set the ambiance. We started with a liquid form of appetizers known as professionally-crafted cocktails. So cleverly crafted and went down really well. Before I finished my first cocktail, I was already morphing to my alter ego. Our waitress was such a sport. I have a bit of a sailor's mouth on me and she kept her composure and played along. I like that about people, especially when they're working. I visited Morimoto in the summer of 2012 for dinner (aka BANK)... so I'll try to remember what I can by popping a gingko pill. The nitty gritty of what was ordered:~4-6 individually crafted cocktails. The cucumber cocktail is a must try. Very refreshing!-angry chicken ""angry bird""-Maine lobster-omakase/sashimi platter-donburi-seared scallop-2 bottles of Chardonnay -a free bday dessert for me... some kind of ice cream with an edible ""happy birthday"" chocolate bannerAll in all, this is a very unique and special dining experience. If you're trying to win over someone or possibly propose or even a random romantic surprises... this is the place to go above and beyond. It's sure is expensive...

700,7SsGRl4z8rCdvTz-J1n26w,Liv A.,5.0 star rating,"I have been a Chef Masaharu Morimoto fanatic since I was a kid.  I'd watch every episode of the original Iron Chef series even though it was in Japanese and I couldn't understand anything they were saying.  When he came on Iron Chef America, I kept watching.  I always appreciated Chef Morimoto's creative take on innovative Japanese cuisine and the aesthetics on his presentation for each dish.  An ice sculpture with tropical plants serving as a platter for a trio of fish or some new way to eat a deconstructed udon to accentuate the flavor profiles of each of the ingredients....these are examples of how Chef M. always incorporates thought into his craft.  He also uses the concept of umami.  Chef Morimoto is such a personable public figure, you can't help but just fall in love with his enthusiastic, fun personality.Although there is a Morimoto in Napa, I still haven't tried it yet.  When in Manhattan, I took this as the perfect opportunity to try the Morimoto there.  Bf and I headed over to Chelsea for a weekday lunch.  We had a reservation and were seated immediately.  The restaurant was modern and sheik in decor.  It's everything you would expect for a Morimoto establishment..... pleasing to the eye and very welcoming.  The host and wait staff were very professional and provided excellent service.  We even chatted with the waitress a bit and asked about Chef.  She said that he was opening a few other locations so he doesn't frequent the NY one as much these days.  She also shared with us that their staff would watch the Iron Chef America episodes together upstairs when some of their sous chefs from the NY Morimoto were featured.  I thought that was awesome that they had a great comradery among their staff members. Since we were eating our way through Manhattan, bf and I went with a few choices for a light lunch.  Everything on the menu looked amazing but we decided to pick and choose wisely:-Toro tartare:  I saw this Morimoto signature dish many years ago on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate.  I have been wanting to try it since.  Besides, I love toro.  First, the presentation was just incredible.  Second, the innovative way of eating it with spoons of the various condiments not only accentuated all the different flavors but added fun in eating it period.  The little bits of rice crackers gave the toro a nice crunch and texture.  Soooo gooood all around.  Also, the caviar was a nice touch as well. -Wagyu carpaccio: thin slices of wagyu beef seared with hot chili oil....melt in your mouth goodness.  I'm normally not one for beef nor carpaccios (I prefer my beef not to be bloody).  However, this take on the carpaccio was perfect.  It was flavorful and not completely raw so that I could appreciate it much more.  Also presented beautifully as expected.  -$55 Sashimi: chef's choice of fish which included a good assortment of sashimi that was fresh fresh fresh fresh.  The fish had that rainbow tint on it as if it was just plucked out of the sea and served up on the platter.  Each type of fish was grade A and the variation provided nice distinct flavors.  The fish was sweet and just melted in our mouths.  I have no idea how they make the smoked salmon bc it's raw but is infused with a smokey flavor.  Actually, I take that back....I believe I've seen Chef Morimoto make that on Iron Chef before.  Anyway I digress, but I never had anything like it before and it was incredible.  I'm normally not too crazy about the white fishes but everything was exceptional.-Salmon sashimi: again, super fresh and delicious as ever.  Total tab was $150 for our light lunch.  One of the best sushi experiences I've had in a long time.  I was thoroughly pleased.  I can't wait to try the Napa Morimoto now that I'm back in the Bay!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The place was packed, and we were squeezed into seats located in the middle of a long table that seated another 20 or so people. It definitely felt like we were packed in like sardines. Not the fine dining experience I was hoping for. I have to preface this by saying I have had a lot of authentic Japanese food, and this food is just not that inspired and definitely does not deserve the hype. I ordered a salmon roll, the saba, the myoga, and the ishi yaki buri bop, which was our waiter's favorite dish. If you've had korean food before, this is just non-spicy dolsot bibimbop with sweet soy sauce and pieces of cooked yellowtail on top. Definitely not anything exciting. The sushi was of average quality and did not leave me wanting more. One of my friends tried the special New Year's Eve $150 omakase, and she felt the food was underwhelming. The only redeeming dishes that we tried were the desserts. Both the chilled cheesecake and the dessert that came with the omakase meal were excellent.I will also complement the service.

You're given little spatula-spoons to scoop the toro and micro-toppings, eating it nimble by nimble. It's not even bite by bite. It's like centimeter by centimeter. It definitely could have used some carbs to spread on to make eating it less slow/awkward.Chirashi - A surprisingly large portion that comes with an assortment of sashimi. It didn't blow me away though.Surf & Turf - Comes with a nice strip of wagu, slices of hamachi, and a small potato cake.Yellowtail stone bowl - They mix up the contents and sauce in front of you.

So - why 3 stars?  Ding one star for the prices, which are painfully high for what you get.  And ding one star for there being better, especially in this part of town.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

726,BYDGyjPeucvB1RyRC1Y7wQ,Sarah G.,5.0 star rating,"Just scored a last second lunch reservation at Morimoto for restaurant week. Honestly, my expectations were not super high. I'd read some good things about the quality of their sushi, but was also anticipating snooty, pretentious service, and less focus on the quality of food,  as indicated in the ny times review. Well, I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here, both in the food and the service. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, and the food (I ordered the sashimi platter) definitely blew me away. After having sushi in LA last month, my eyes were opened to a whole new standard of freshness I had not yet experienced on the east coast. Today, however, I learned my lesson that this standard does exist in NY, but at a much higher price. However, thanks to restaurant week's $25 lunch prix fixe, I got my fix for a very modest price. On my plate was toro, hamachi, soba (mackerel), fluke (i'm guessing), and salmon. Mackerel can be particularly risky to order in NY, as it can be very pungent when not at its freshest. The mackerel here was outstanding; clean and delicious. Easily the best i've had. Each slice of fish seemed better than the last. The platter also came with a side salad, miso soup, hijiki, and kimchi cucumbers. The salad was dressed with what tasted like a miso citrus vinaigrette with crunchy sesame seeds. The crunchy sesame topping was so good. I would have licked my bowl clean if it were culturally acceptable restaurant behavior! The miso was probably the best i've had, with big chunks of asymmetrical tofu floating about, rather than the tiny diced tofu you generally get. The hijiki was standard but good. The kimchi cucumbers were refreshing and had a nice chili kick. The two desserts they offered were also surprisingly good: one reminiscent of a lemon custard with crushed pistachios and a scoop of ice cream, and the other a layered coffee dessert with this delicious crunchy toasted crumble. But as dessert is not really my thing, i'll skip this is my review.  I really enjoyed my experience here, and between mouthfuls of sashimi was already plotting my next trip back! The atmosphere is also super intimate and sexy. I can't wait to come back on a date and try out some of their cocktails as well!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
727,1McXyYdfnG_MBQdGYv7HPw,Alexander K.,4.0 star rating,"FIrst off, I want to state that this restaurant is beautiful. Even before entering, the exterior is covered in a repetition of tied draped deep-red cloth covering the glass door entrance. The interior itself is very modern with facades of glass with wooden furnishings and soft tones of white/beige all around the restaurant.Anyways, on to the review. My girlfriend and I shared the toro tartare appetizer which our server had suggested; the signature appetizer of the restaurant. Served on a wooden paddle with caviar and six various accoutrements, it was indeed a pleasure on the eyes as well as the palate. The tuna had a rich texture and flavor, and we opted for the accoutrements on the right side of the secondary wooden dish since the creme fraiche and wasabi paste didn't appeal to us too much. Also, the two drinks that we ordered (ginger lemonade and white lilly) were wonderful as well; reminiscent of the non-alcoholic drink pairing we had at Rogue 24 earlier this year.For the entrees I had the lobster with I thought was supposed to be served raw since it was under the ""raw bar"" category, but it came out steamed and chilled. The server later explained that restaurants in NYC are prohibited from serving raw lobster, but nonethless it was satisfying, the lobster was thoughtfully cracked in the right places, the presentation was beautiful, and it was accompanied by 4 different dipping sauces and two different type of delicate fruits which I don't remember the name of. My girlfriend opted for the wagyu beef sandwich, which was crafted well and accompanied by sweet pickles and fried onion rings.Finally we finished off with their inventive interpretation of flourless chocolate cake which was very rich and had a great texture, topped off with caramel popcorn and a delicious serving of green tea ice cream with chopped fruit underneath. All in all it was a solid meal with great presentation, but I would say it lacked the extra ""wow"" factor which makes me unable to give the restaurant a 5 star rating.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Sushi-wise, Morimoto's rice is definitely a lot more seasoned than other sushi joints I went to in the past. It was so seasoned that I found I didn't need any soy sauce at all. After awhile, I thought the rice overwhelmed the fish (especially milder tasting varieties such as tuna). But still very, very good.The fish was extremely fresh and ridiculously delicious. You know you're getting the good cuts here. No fake wasabi here either. The chefs here portion their wasabi accordingly to the richness of the fish.

730,CwMAksh2qSz6igXn1q8Zzw,Mary C.,3.0 star rating,"Morimoto Restaurant, eponymously named after it's creator Masahru Morimoto of Food Network's Food Network's Iron Chef , was near the top of my dining establishment hitlist during a short trip to New York City. Most popular with their Omakase menu, Morimoto also offers an a la cart menu that would please anyone looking for an Asian-fusion dining experience.DECOR: The decor of Morimoto is a confusing work of art. A maze of translucent Plexiglass shapes the room, separating the crowded tables. Scattered throughout this maze is an open kitchen, a pretentious looking bar, and sporadic fixtures providing dim lighting to the room. This place has a esoteric vibe, giving you the impression that this was where it's all happening. You are at the very center of it all and there's no cooler place to be right now, than to be dining at Morimoto'sDRINKS:They have an extensive wine and cocktail list here, and after long deliberation we went with the Selbach Reisling. Sweet, frangrant, and went down like candy. FOOD:Yellowtail Pastrami ($21) - togarashi, gin creme fraiche, and candided oliveThe yellow tail pastrami was an attempt at an adventurous order, as you don't often see the words ""yellowtail"", and ""pastrami"" next to each other. I really had no clue what to expect. I personally wasn't overly amorous of this appetizer. It had a fishy aftertaste, which may be just the nature of yellow tail. A neat concept to serve sashimi fish pastrami style, but it didn't work for me.Hamachi Tartare($25) - osetra caviar, sour cream, wasabi, and dashi-soyThe tartare is served on a flat tray with a dollop of caviar. To consume, you scoop a small spatula full of the fish, and dip it into the accompanying sauces. Almost felt like making a lollipop!Morimoto style Chirashi ($33) - 10-12 different fish and vegetablesThe chirashi is underwhelming at first glance, but as you work your way through it you realize it's a solid bowl of rice and fish. It's filled to the brim with perfectly made sushi rice and bite size cubes of fish of great variety.Duck, Duck, Duck ($32) - foie gras croissant, roast duck, soft duck egg, red miso sauceI ordered the Duck Duck Duck, as a result of successful menu marketing. I admit if it weren't for the name, it might not have ordered it. The dish came on a gigantic plate that literally took up my entire table space. The duck however was delicious! A runny duck egg, crispy skinned duck leg, and a duck breast sandwich. The style of this dish wasn't too far off from Chinese style roasted duck, but the meat was in fact much more juicy and rich.OVERALL THOUGHTS:Considering the location, the amount of food, and the wine that we had, this bill was not outrageous at all. Surprising, since I went in with the impression that it would cost me an arm and a leg. Mind you, not everything was spectacular, but decent enough to have me come back to this socialite haven.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

He doesn't stop at the food level. This Iron Chef gets down to the plumbing level. We are talking about toilets with embedded bidets that will leave your entire backside clean, massaged, and wanting more. This is what makes Morimoto an Iron Chef.  Your mouth and taint will thank you. Incredible...  Food/Drinks==========Took us a minute to get our table, so we had a chance to explore the downstairs bar and drink menu. The Lotus Blossom came highly recommended, made with gin (Bombay), a Japanese citrus liquor called Yuzu (rumor has it this is very hard to find outside of Morimoto's restaurants), and a Japanese soft drink called Calpico. I could down these one after another. Not sure if I'd make it up the stairs back to my table though.Appetizers---------------Once I did make it to my table, I was ready to attack the appetizers. Morimoto Sashimi is a 5x5 - 5 sashimi squares stacked on top of each other, with 5 sauces in tiny squeeze bottles for ultra precision - seared toro, salmon, eel, tuna, and hamachi. Melts in your mouth and the combination so carefully thought out that you should be able to distinguish each layer in the small sashimi square.The steamed scallop is marinated in XO sauce.  Dry scallop sauce on freshly steamed scallops - doesn't take a celebrity judge on Iron Chef to recognize the thought behind this artistic pairing.  This with the sashimi definitely set a level of expectation for the rest of the meal on which the Morimoto's kitchen delivered.Entrees-----------The sea bass - marinated with sweet sake, served with Japanese eggplant, and miso.  Full of flavor and super tender, this sea bass was incredible, just falling off the fork. Nothing more to be said about a beautifully prepared fish like this.Duck, duck, duck - get the f$*k out of here with that evil genius dude.  Duck 3 ways - 1) foie gras croissant (suck it California) - good foie gras is good foie gras. Period.2) roast duck - skin is as good as the meat - crispy goodness. meat is the perfect combination of tender, fat, and chewy.3) soft duck egg - ok I'll go with it.  I appreciate the art form.Dessert-----------I see the words Warm Chocolate Cake and my stomach automagically makes extra room. Can't explain it. Put Morimoto's Iron Chef spin on it and you get it with Japanese dark sugar syrup, rhubarb sauce, a side of ice cream, and some sweet caramel popcorn.  After this dessert, you will want to put on some sneakers and check out the running track along the West Side Highway. Although I didn't meet Morimoto during my visit, this menu iron chef'd the crap out of me. Everyone should experience this place at least once in their life.Also - toilets from the future.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Came here on Christmas eve and I was pretty surprised the restaurant wasn't packed. The restaurant looks pretty swanky inside but the table we had was in a side room and some of the tables were very close together. Decided to get the omakase (DUH). It was $120 a person but very worth it. Course #1: Their infamous toro tartare. The toro was so fresh and I love how it was presented in a little bamboo plate with a variety of accompaniments ranging from guacamole to freshly grated wasabi and seaweed. Course #2: Sashimi of yellowtail. Very fresh fish as usual and came drizzled with a ponzu/soy sauce. Course #3: Very interesting fondue type with anchoives in hot oil dipping sauce. This was probably my least favorite course. They gave very strange things to dip in the hot oil like a tomato or green onionCourse #4: Kumamoto oysters steamed with foie gras, uni (sea urchin), and teriyaki glaze. Normally i'm not a fan of oysters and uni but none of it had any fishy taste. Course #5: sashimi platter of 5 different types of fishes. Course #6: Lobster and Wagyu beef- one of my favorite courses. The lobster was cooked perfectly with a garlic asian taste and the wagyu beef was tender Course #7: Dessert: fig chocolate cake dessert. The chocolate cake was moist and wasn't overly sweet. It taste like those asian chocolate cakes you get. Came with a green tea ice creamOverall service was good. Drinks were always refilled and the food came out in a timely manner.

This is awesome food with amazing presentation, plating, and creativity. My favorite from the omakase was the toro tartare as there were a few different pastes to eat with the tartare. The foie gras oyster was amazing. I really don't know how to explain the flavors I consumed. Seriously one of the best omakase experiences I have had. Yes it will cost you a bit but Iron Chef Morimoto's omakase is something you must experience. I have also had their lunch specials and other food items and everything has been solid but you just have to experience the omakase. Nothing like it.

So we were sent to the bar downstairs to wait for our table. We ordered the Hydrangea, which was their version of a lychee martini. It was delish. We waited about 10 minutes before we were told that our table was ready and they sent a waiter to bring our drinks upstairs. There were 4 of us and we were seated at the long communal table which we were not happy with. But they had no tables available and we were all starving. They had a lot of specials that night that sounded amazing, and even though I wasn't paying or had to worry about budget, I was too shy to order what I really wanted. Either way, we picked a few appetizers to share: Hamachi with jalapeno sashimi, toro tartare, spicy king crab legs, Morimoto sashimi, and their special of the night Alaskan King Salmon sashimi, and baby snapper sashimi. All those items were amazing, absolutely fresh. Morimoto sashimi wasn't what I expected it to be though. My favorite from those was the Hamachi and jalapeno sashimi.For entrees: Surf & Turf (wagyu filet, Hamachi ribbons, and fingerling potatoes). That was my entrée, and it was pretty good. It was really tiny, and I do expect it from a place like this. The beef was amazing. The Hamachi was definitely overpowered by the ""guacamole"". I wish I ordered something else honestly. Sea bass which my friend ordered was amazing. I thought it was the best entrée anyone ordered. There was a yellowtail rice bowl ordered by another person in our party. Not my kinda thing, nor do I think it's worth it to come here for it. My cousin ordered the halibut which wasn't anything special because the steamed fish I make at home tastes exactly like it. Seriously, I should've ordered sushi.For desserts: warm chocolate cake with blood orange sorbet, monkey bread pudding, and sorbet. All was good. There was a smear of truffle honey on the plate of the warm chocolate cake that was sooo amazing. Monkey bread pudding was pretty good too. Overall a great experience.

742,x6dzit_MdMAYJe1QeE2DYQ,Annie C.,2.0 star rating,"It was over priced and over rated. I've eaten in a lot of restaurants around nyc and beyond. The ""japanese wagyu steak"" was very dissapointing, I've had it at different restaurants and it melts in your mouth. The one I had here taste like regular steak that I can get for $30 , or like USA Kobe beef - at best. The toro sashimi was the same situation , it had veins and wasn't what I was expecting as well for the price. The rest of the fish were okay (same quality you can get at any other Japanese restaurant- it was a cut above the all you can eat places though) . The foie gras and eel had good flavor mixed with the Asian pear, but the foie gras it self tasted like the fatty skin of a salmon fish more than foie gras, it didn't have the texture that it usually carries. Those will argue it is the name and the ambience or the service. I will have to say the service was not exceptional, I've been to places that was more polite and caring. For a $70 tip the waiter can at least to pretend to care when he asked for feed back. Instead of asking me how everything was and ended up not being able to handle the truth and became offended and defensive telling me I don't know what I'm talking about because Japanese wagyu beef and Kobe beef are different, (because I told him the steak tasted like USA Kobe beef at best) and made it seem like I've never had fine dining before. So my suggestion is, go just to try it if it's your thing to just say ""been there done that"" but I would not recommend it and take that $$ elsewhere like BOND STREET where the sushi is fresh  and people are nice and clearly love their job.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I'm also a Japan lover so that made it even more important!FOOD/DRINKS - 5 Stars: Here's a run down of what we ordered:Appetizers:- Eel and avocado roll (yelp.com/biz_photos/t1w4…)- Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura (yelp.com/biz_photos/t1w4…)Entrees:- Seafood Toban Yaki (yelp.com/biz_photos/t1w4…) which had king crab, scallops, shrimp, and lobster.- Surf and Turf with yellowtail sashimi, wagyu, and potatoes (yelp.com/biz_photos/t1w4…) Drinks (yelp.com/biz_photos/t1w4…):- White Lily, this was my favorite drink with yuzu and Calpis! If you're a fan of Calpis, this is definitely worth a try... I ordered two of these!- Hydrangea, which is lychee based.This was so much food, but oh so good. The rock shrimp tempura was an amazing way to start the meal. The eel and avocado roll was absolutely fresh.The surf and turf was a good way to get your meat fix as well as some seafood. The sashimi was mixed with avocado. It was my first time eating it this way, but it was absolutely amazing. The Toban Yaki was so good that all that was left was shell. All the broth and every piece of meat was gone! I don't think anything else needs to be said of how good it was.Unfortunately, we were so stuffed we had to skip out on dessert. =/ATMOSPHERE - 5 Stars: This place is very Hollywood/NYC trendy. That might turn people off, but the setting is truly awesome in here. And even down to the restrooms. I literally had to stare at the stall because of the weird illusion... Ok... I know I'm writing about a stall, but you have to see it for yourself. Hahaha.The ambience was nice and it was very loungy and relaxing. We really enjoyed it.SERVICE - 5 Stars: The service here was impeccable. It was perfect from start to finish. Our server was awesome and did a great job. The evening was seamless and the meal had a nice flow.RECOMMENDATION: I recommend this restaurant to EVERYONE.

With the added bonus of this also being an Iron Chef restaurant, I was really excited to get in this place. We made reservations and were a little late - due to crazy traffic - but there were no other patrons waiting and we were seated immediately -'the host staff were impeccable. The problem started when we didn't get to place our drink order for 10 minutes - the tables in the section were all at very different stages - one group was on dessert - one was in the middle of the entree - so it wasn't like the whole section was sat at once - we finally had to ask the waiter's assistant to get our server - she came over and was curt and kept trying to walk away while we were ordering - it was really odd - and that behavior carried through until we got the check - were weren't even asked if we wanted dessert.The food part though was outstanding - everything we ordered from the 3 rolls and the pork gyoza were beautiful in presentation and fantastic in taste - if only the server part of our experience had been better - I would have probably given this spot 5 stars.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
746,GwoVAarqxWLZR2q3Pdjoyg,Louis P.,5.0 star rating,"If 1,300+ rave reviews are not enough to help make up your mind, here comes another. I rarely say a restaurant is perfect in every aspect, but Morimoto proves itself worthy and then some. First thing i must admit is that i am pretty cautious with my money. I wouldn't say cheap, but when we decided we were going to Morimoto and i saw all the Yelp reviews relating to money, my heart might have skipped a few beats. Yes i was scared to spend half of my biweekly paycheck on dinner but i toughened up and we made the trip. My wife, brother in law and sister in law passed through the automatic sliding doors into the coolest place I've been to in a long time. We were 30 minutes early so our coats were checked and we were directed downstairs to the lounge. Empty liquor bottles lined the walls for some real creative decor and the blue lights made you feel like you were in a futuristic club out in space!.We had a couple of cocktails and were escorted to our table. Comfy padded chairs greeted us along with Carlo, who is one of the managers. He introduced himself, thanked us for coming and offered his services for anything we may need during our meal. He then introduced us to Freddy, who would be our waiter for the evening. Freddy told us about some specials and took our drink order, so here's the fun part:We decided to go with a variety of appetizers instead of the very popular tasting menu because my wife and sister in law are inexperienced with sushi. We really went all out with our order and I'm glad we did! We started with the toro tar tar, one spicy tuna roll, rock tempura shrimp with ranch dressing on the side, beef carpaccio and the best app if all, spicy king crab! I don't even know where to begin with these apps, everything was simply perfect! The girls loved the crab the most and my brother in law and I devoured the toro tar tar.Again, all i can say is that every app was made to the highest quality and our pallets were more than pleased! Both Carlo and Freddy were coming back and forth to check up on us, Carlo was answering questions we had about Morimoto that I'm sure he is asked 50 times a day, while Freddy was telling us a little about the spices used in the dishes (especially the spicy king crab), along with some of the stories he has while traveling through Singapore and China. Needless to say we were being treated real well and also getting a first class experience in fine dining. So next we went to the entrees:My brother in law and I went with the line-caught Halibut while the women went with the 'Angry Chicken.' The Halibut, once again, was the best I've ever tasted. It was as fresh as it could possibly be with a black bean glaze on top and it was all sitting in a fine miso broth with a tang that completed the dish to perfection. For dessert, we went all out again! We had a variety of sweets, including monkey bread accompanied by banana chocolate chip ice cream, chocolate cake filled with cream and topped with fruit and popcorn, cheesecake topped with raspberry sorbet along with yogurt and donuts. Once again, WOW! The clear highlight was the monkey bread, which had a syrupy glaze on the outside and an amazing warm yellow cream inside with mini sliced bananas on top! All the food went down with sweet White Lily and Hydrangea cocktails, which complimented the food perfectly. I guess you can say we went with the meal for beginners, we sampled a bunch of the menu but did not delve too deep into the sushi portion. After all was said and done, our combined bill for 4 was a touch over $320 before tip, which wasn't bad at all considering what i was fearing and the fact that we were chowing down at one of the best restaurants in Manhattan! The staff at Morimoto is simply top notch! Carlo the manager paid attention to every detail and made our experience seamless. Freddy the waiter and Cofield the bus boy were quick, kind and intelligent, you really can't ask for anything more. This was only the second time in my life that i had a perfect fine dining experience, with not one bad thing to report. If you are worried about spending too much money, just go in with the mindset that you are about to treat yourself to something better than you can ever imagine. Highest recommendation i could possibly give for a restaurant.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Definitely go for the bento pre fixe lunch special ($25). You get a salad, a meat (wagyu beef, sea bass, or cod), sushi, tempura, and a panna cotta dessert. We also sampled the unagi sushi ($5/piece) and ootoro sushi ($18/piece) as well as the yuzu, lemon, calpico cocktail called white lily ($14). Excellent service, and yes, the most beautiful restaurant I went to in NYC with great restrooms even lol. I really do appreciate the welcoming, warm, and exquisetly gorgeous decor.

Everyone was pleased with the appetizers.Entrees: Duck, Duck, Duck (okay, Peking Duck anyone?). Sea Bass (nom nom). Braised Black Cod (yummy).

The seafood is fresh and seasoned perfectly with a hint of flavor.Desserts: Warm Chocolate Cake, Apple Turban, Sesame Hazelnut Layer Cake and Tofu ""Hot and Cold.""  The Chocolate Cake takes the prize.In my humble opinion, I didn't have an amazing culinary experience but I would go back perhaps to try the Omakase Dinner in the near future.

We were seated downstairs in the lounge area. It was fairly early so nobody was around us until later 7PM. I tried their Bluebell cocktail to start the night. It is amazing. I think every girl should try this. Don't get the Moritini because it tastes like sashimi. We got the Rock Shrimp Tempura as appetizer to share. They brought out two flavors of tempura. One is slightly saltier and closer to Buffalo Wing style and the other is lightly battered fried shrimp and a plate of Ranch dressing. It is definitely very different from your regular shrimp tempura. We also got the Lobster Fritters and again it is very unique and unlike any other fritters I have had. In fact, it is more like a takoyaki ball but with lobster inside. For sushi, we got the spicy tuna roll and eel and avocado rolls. They are both pretty good but honestly I think for the price, it should have been better. The sushi rice was not particularly outstanding. The sashimi platter we got however was very fresh and top quality. I had to leave the party earlier but the overall experience was pleasant and the service was attentive.

I came here again last week for a friend's birthday and it just reminded me of how much I miss this place! It's located in Chelsea on 10th avenue, near Chelsea Market. It's always been easy for me to get reservations to the restaurant because of how large the restaurant is. It has a wonderful ambiance and great service.Things I order time and again:1) Omakase. Obviously the best thing to get especially for first-timers. It will include their signature toro tartare.2) Toro tartare. A must have every time. It's toro tuna tartare flattened in a rectangular plate served with different condiments such as wasabi, green onions, creme fraiche, something that taste like hoisin sauce, and some kind of crunchy crumbs. It's one of the best things I ever ate.3) Seabass. On the healthier lighter side. Sooo fresh and delish.4) Sushi / Oyster. All of their fish is prepared so fresh. The rice they cook is perfection...really makes all the difference...you get a bit of sweetness and vinegar.5) Rock Shrimp appetizer....great to share.6) Their dessert...can't go wrong with anything, but the Green Tea mille crepe cake with rocher ice cream was soooo amazing!!!7) Cocktails - lychee martini....yum.I've always had great service here as expected, which makes this place an easy pick if I'm around the area.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

With all the hype surrounding this place, I expected so much more. Came here for the restaurant week special, so maybe they put less effort Into these than regular priced dishes?? Either way, I was disappointed. The miso black cod, a supposed staple at morimoto, was cold by the time it reached me and extremely bland. The skin was soggy, which is always a turn off for fish. I tried a bit of my friend's Kobe beef and it was salty to the point where you couldn't really taste the beef. We also ordered some salmon avocado rolls, and they were over-loaded with rice, with very lack luster fish.

The whopping total was ~$285 without a tip added.  Again, this place is not for the following types of people:1) the faint of heart2) the animalistic eater3) the recession wallet 4) the ignorant of the meaning of ""Iron Chef"" And 5) the ""presentation doesn't mean anything to me""Come to experience something rare, elegant, and so tasteful, you'll want to take cooking classes.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

He was my idol, and I always cheer him on during the battles. But man, this is the 2nd time he disappoints me.First time was at the Lucky Rice festival in NYC earlier this year. He personally made some lobster on a spoon dish. it was waaay too salty and you can't even taste the lobster at all. What the hell happened to the whole preserving the true ingredient taste that Iron Chefs so highly strives for?And now here at his restaurant. Since we weren't hungry, we only ordered the appetizers. Frankly, the appetizers sounded so much better than the dinner menu.The Tuna Pizza yelp.com/biz_photos/t1w4… It's good, but it's not amazing in any way. Taste kinda like tuna salad you get anywhere else, with mayo.Tuna Tartare yelp.com/biz_photos/t1w4… the whole reason why we were here in the first place. Supposed to be the best thing ever in the restaurant. But did they really use toro? the tuna is not fatty or concentrated in the deep, rich tuna flavor, it's bland! This is probably the least tasty toro I've ever had, and I'm comparing it to places in Miami.Oyster Foie Gras yelp.com/biz_photos/t1w4…I can't taste the oyster, I can't taste the foie gras, I can't taste the uni. I CAN taste the hoisin sauce though, lots and lots of salty hoisin sauce. not sure what the red fruit is in the center, but it's the best tasting thing in the whole dish.Wagyu Beef Carpaccio yelp.com/biz_photos/t1w4… This is actually tasty. nice mixture of seasoning and sesame oil. But I've had real wagyu beef before, and this is not even close. it's too tough to be wagyu and not enough flavor.

769,HC_ro2nM0vMGRahUpSF89g,Jason O.,1.0 star rating,"If I could rate this restaurant zero stars I would based for the awful service on my engagement night. I had called a week in advance to make sure I could get a reservation with Morimoto due to my fiance and I having a great date there in the very beginning of our relationship. The person who answered my call and took the reservation said it would be no problem for a 7:15pm reservation at a specific set of tables. He also said he would let the staff know it was a special night for the engagement. Fast forward to 6/30 when we arrive and our table was not held. We were put in another section and I asked to speak to a Manager, Min, about what happened given I called in advance and was promised. I understand mistakes are made and I'm usually laid back but the indifferent attitude Min showed was unacceptable and unprofessional. She tried to explain that they don't honor reservations because ""It's first come first serve"" which made no sense at all, why take reservations by phone or online? Then she offered my fiance and I free dessert. Free dessert? Really? It's one of the most important night's in my life to date and I wanted the night to be special (it was thankfully) so offering me free sweets isn't going to make things right. It was like she was reading off a script in this monotone voice and did not appear to care at all. She did nothing to resolve the issue in a professional manner.  A more appropriate response would have been to ask us to wait at the bar, perhaps comp a free drink while they sorted out the table seating and then apologize for messing up a special night. Luckily we went straight to Fatty Crab which is our favorite date spot and had a blast, it actually was better than going to a stuffy restaurant like Morimoto versus a small intimate place where our awesome server Colin was genuinely happy for us, he even hugged us goodbye!     Morimoto does have decent food but like other reviewers mention, it is overpriced and caters to the tourist crowds. I will never go back based on the staff and most notably the manager Min, who is either useless or seriously does not care about correcting a mistake the restaurant staff made. Completely unacceptable for a restaurant that charges as much as they do and touts famous chefs, etc...

I don't mind spending that kind of money on a great dining experience but Morimoto fell short in my eyes.The service was okay at best. We got placed at a table away from the main dining area near the kitchen and bathrooms - not exactly ideal. Our server was friendly enough but overly casual and not super attentive (waited too long for more drinks or to have our plates cleared, etc...).We both got the omakase (chef's choice - I believe it was $125/pp) and there were some big hits and definite misses:Really good: Toto Tartare: This was by far my favorite course. Really delicious toro along w/ 5 different accompaniments (wasabi, caviar, etc...) . We found ourselves craving it for days after.Sashimi course - I believe it was yellow tail with a ponzu/soy sauce. Could have eaten a few more plates of that.The dessert - Mango pudding w/ passion fruit sorbet and yogurt power. Nice light and inventive way to end the meal.Sushi course: 5 different types of fish - all very fresh.Meh: The anchovies fondue -   fondue was very, very salty. It came with an assortment of things to dip into it (soshito pepper, raw red pepper, cauliflower, mortadella, etc...). It was a fun idea but the saltiness of the fondue almost killed it for me. Kumamoto oyster with foie gras, uni and terriyaki sauce - I LOVE oysters, foie gras and uni. I was super excited when this came out. The terriyaki sauce was just way too overpowering. Maybe less sauce or a different sauce and I would have loved it. As it was, it was alright but a major letdown. Waygu beef & lobster: Meh. Meat was just okay - I was very underwhelmed, my lobster was undercooked and I wasn't a fan of the spices used.Would I go back? Probably not.

They are either incredibility stuck up, or incredibly aloof. Either way, they do a disservice to their coworkers. The bartenders are friendly, the bus stuff is as well, and our waiter was almost as excited about our visit as we were.Our waiter actually made everything feel a lot less stuffy. He took his time recommending dishes for us and kept checking up on us genuinely caring if we were enjoying everything. My experience at other fancy-shamcy places like this have been that the servers assume everything is perfect, which as we all know isn't always the case.So the food was delicious, creative, but alas, not very memorable. Granted I was there a week ago and took my time to get around writing this review, but I expected myself to remember the flavors in a dish or two. I don't. But that doesn't mean it wasn't worth it. It just means it's delicious fancy food that's worth trying once, for the sake of trying it.  The coolest part of it all though, I embarrassingly must admit, was the toilets.

I have to say this is one of my all time favorite restaurants and I will make sure to dine here again whenever I'm in town. The food was delicious, creative and beautifully presented. Service was outstanding with table side presentations and special attention to my food allergies. The restaurant exterior is very simple and you may even miss it from the street, however inside the decor is very well designed, sleek and modern as you can see from the photos.  You will even have to make a trip to the restroom downstairs. Worth taking a look.  Quite impressive.  I have always admired Chef Morimoto from watching Iron Chef and it was on the top of our list of places we wanted to try. It was a unique dining experience that exceeded my expectations. Toro Tartare is a beautiful and delicious appetizer you have to try and once you've had wagyu on your bibimbap nothing else compares! For the grand finale, dessert, with compliments from the chef. It was a show in itself. Fiery chocolate tart. Yes that's real fire which melts the chocolate. They also gave me the most delicious sorbet trio with such unique and original flavors like strawberry red wine, green tea, and blood orange meringue.  Tomo Arigato Chef Morimoto and staff for helping us celebrate my daughter's birthday.

I heard decent reviews of this place and the whole Iron Chef thing just kind of makes people think this place is good. Well, let me tell you, this place is ridiculously amazing. Even the bathroom is awesome! The restaurant is very modern. Sliding doors, sleek furniture, amazing bar and just an overall clean and sleek look and feel. That alone already started my experience and the food really just sent me over the edge. I am in LOVE with this place and it is seriously worth the splurge. We started with the tofu and the spicy king crab legs. I am not a fan of tofu at all, but this tofu was amazing. The tofu dish was a show: it started with a bowl of liquid and they add some concoction to it and ten minutes later, it became tofu. They top it with mushroom soup and you can add rice crackers to it. When I say I hate tofu, I mean it, but I could eat this for days! The king crab leg was fish roe and spicy mayo mixed together and topped on juicy crab legs. This dish was pricey, but so worth it. I dreamt about it last night it was so good. On to the main dish, I had the sea bass which was a very good sized portion and so juicy and flavorful. I love fish and I love aquagrill, but Morimoto knows how to cook his fish. When I say flavorful, I mean it. Every bite is bursting with all the tastes from the sauce and it really is a party for your mouth. I will say, the table next to us ordered the steak and I was drooling. I really had to control myself from asking them for a piece. For a seafood restaurant, they know how to cook a steak. We finished our meal with the flourless chocolate cake and the red bean doughnuts. The cake was so rich and fudgy and is seriously a chocolate lovers dream. The doughnuts were good, but I liked the frozen yogurt that it came with much more. Of the two desserts, I'd go with the chocolate cake. Our server was a little slow and essentially forgot about us. While I didn't mind the 3 hours meal, it would have been a lot less if he actually paid attention. Minus 1 star for that, but food wise this is a 5 star restaurant. They also do make sure that their customers are happy. The table next to us had their steak cooked wrong and not only did they recook it, the manager came over to apologize and they comped the steak and threw in dessert and a glass of wine. Not a big deal for Morimoto, but they do value their customers happiness. All in all, I would definitely come back here.

Last time I went, the white fish carpaccio was no longer on the appetizer menu but was part of the tasting menu in a smaller portion, which I think is a mistake, cuz it was great in the larger portion. The sushi is also great but once in a while it feels like they need to let the sushi rice warm up to room temperature instead of having it be too cold and stiff, that's my occasional gripe. The steak here is surprisingly amazing! Better than at some steakhouses, and this is a sushi spot so kudos to them.

I came here for NYE's last year with my fiance and it was the best sushi experience I've ever had!  We didn't even have reservations, we just walked in at 11, and were planning to sit at the bar but the hosts found us a terrific seat and were so accomodating!   For NYE, they handed out party hats and beads and little horns for the midnight toast. We weren't planning to go out that night at all but this made our NYE experience so worth it!Starting with food. Their food is incredible. The Iron Chef lives up to his name. Their miso cod is better than Nobu - yes I said it!  Their fish is so fresh, so beautiful, so rich and so delicious! We had the classics: toro tartar, crispy rock shrimp, miso cod, salmon, shrimp tempura roll and some uni sushi. I just knew this was a knockout by how delicious and soft the uni was, and how light and buttery the fishes were. I almost didn't want to list everything because now I'm hungry for it again!  We had a bottle of champagne so I didn't get to try drinks but I saw other people order them and they looked amazing.Ambiance, in one word, is dreamy but modern... the decor is a visual stunner. Morimoto is made to impress and wow. It is clean lines, sparking decor with subtle edgy flourishes.  The pulsating, shimmering blue wall is the focal point for sure. Location wise, it's in the heart of Meatpacking, so be prepared for the Real Housewives crowd.  This is definitely a trendy, be seen type of place, but I also found it so unique and genuinely fun. Service is top notch. Very attentive, polite and knowledgeable about the menu.  Able to give great recommendations, suggest substitutes and explain anything we didn't know. It was NYE's at 12pm, but he was fun and upbeat. We bought him a glass of champagne to toast with us because he was so cool.  I've been to places with great service but everything has been so stilted and formal and rigid. I love places that are sexy and chic but still relaxed - the point is to eat and laugh..stylishly of course.Price - yes it is pricey, but no more so than many other Manhattan hotspots. We spent about $250 I think for 2, with a bottle of champagne. But we also ate a lot. If you come here for a special occasion, it will be worth it. And I saved the best for last..... the toilets. Yes, perhaps the ultimate luxury in Morimoto is when you descend their transparent curving staircase and find yourself in an ultra modern bathroom... and sit your bum on top of state of the art Japanese toilets with heated seats, and a full remote control with that yields you options that you ever imaged existed for a toilet.  I'll leave it at that.  I giggled like a child for 5 minutes straight and upon exiting the toilets, it was apparent I wasn't the only 5 year old there:PMorimoto is a 5 star A to Z establishment, fulfilling all your needs and desires.

Next I got the spicy tuna rolls and he got the shrimp tempura rolls. Both equally delicious. I like that they don't serve low sodium soy sauce either. For entree, we enjoyed the surf and turf, a serving of Wagyu filet seared to perfection accompanied by hamachi ribbons in ""guacamole"" and some herbed potatoes.

It's covered in clear glass bottles and back lit.  It sets the tone for an incredible meal.The other side of the restaurant has 2 or 3 tables grouped together and sectioned off by glass partition.  The glass isn't completely clear.  And it makes it so that you're surrounded by people, but there's enough of a barrier that you can speak softly and be heard by those at your table.There was also a rather large sushi bar in the back of the restaurant. And a bar/lounge on the lower level.The food is to die for! If you go, don't skip the Spicy King Crab Appetizer.

It is truly worthy of Iron Chef Morimoto.......who I actually met during the entree course.Service is unmatched with their attention to detail and client relations. I say client relations because that's what you feel like. You're not some customer that stopped by to grab a quick bite, you are there so that the staff can invest their time and effort into making your experience at this restaurant the best it can be. The hostess not only showed us to our seats but took the time to get to know us before our waiter even came. Then the manager came to introduce himself to us and asked if he could accommodate us even more than we were already. I didn't even try a single bite of food yet and I was already amazed at this place.I decided not to go with omakase menu so that I could choose for myself. So here are the things I chose to eat.I started off with some sushi selections. There are so many but I chose my favorites. Soft Shell Crab Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, and Squid Sashimi. The crab tasted fresh and the outside was not overly fried or oily. The roll was rolled tightly enough so that nothing was falling out, but loose enough so that you could neatly see all the ingredients. The Spicy Tuna was savory and not overly spicy, the fish was chopped into small chunks instead of the usual paste that most sushi places do. The texture of the small chunks really made this roll very palatable as a starter. The squid was fresh and had no signs of being left on the counter or overly stored in the fridge. Next was the tempura calamari salad. When it came out I thought I had they had brought me the wrong dish because it was piled high with succulent calamari. They must have tenderized the calamari before frying it because there wasn't any hint of chewiness or being overcooked. You didn't look at the salad and think ""I wish there was more calamari"", no, you looked at it and said ""damn! that's a lot of a calamari!The Morimoto Sashimi was my favorite. It's a layered wall of hamachi, eel, seared toro and lean tuna. Each section of the wall is topped with a small morsel of something special that enhances the already amazing flavors from the sashimi. If that wasn't amazing enough, you're given 5 pipettes of sauce to mix and match with the sashimi. Fun to eat, great to eat, even better to savor. I ordered the Seafood Tobanyaki, which is a seafood stew. It has lobster, scallops, king crab, mussels.... so divine. The broth is subtle enough so that every piece of seafood flavor shines. Each piece was also cooked to perfection, nothing was overcooked or chewy and they were cleaned and prepared properly.We also had the surf and turf entree. Kobe Beef with Hamachi, served tableside... amazing. The beef was perfectly seared and had great texture. The hamachi was fresh and tasted great with the herbed potatoes.Dessert comprised of Concord Grape Sorbet, Lychee Sorbet, and Green Apple Sorbet.... I wish they opened up a Morimoto's Sorbet Shop. I could eat an entire tub of each. As we were paying, the manager made sure to greet us and make sure the meal went well. Nothing could have made it better. Especially when we got to meet Morimoto himself. Eating at Morimoto's is like a wedding, you're most likely only going to be able to go there once, so might as well go big or go home. Be prepared to spend and you'll never regret what you get for a meal. Some people look at their wedding photos and go ""Awwww..."", I look at my photos from this restaurant and go ""yum. I gotta go back there again"".",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

It is important to mention that this review is based ONLY on the Omakase experience. I had the pleasure of dining at Morimoto from the day they opened and the days when Chef Morimoto was still present most of the time at his restaurant. In fact our first experience was the Omakase and Chef Morimoto attended to us personally (even helped my girlfriend remove her shoes as part of the Omakase ritual). I made the appointment about 30 days prior to our visit and expected to get the usual email confirmation and Omakase form. 2 weeks passed and still no confirmation, so i called again to reconfirm, No reservation was found. No big deal, made a new reservation and within 15 min got my confirmation and Omakase form, which is nothing more than a credit card authorization form. We opted for the $200 pp Omakase and send the cc information per fax as requested. 1 week prior to our dinner reservation i got a call from the restaurant wanting to reconfirm, which i did. 2 days later i got another call from the same guy (johnny) wanting to reconfirm. SO I DID AGAIN. On the day of our reservation (5 hours prior to our reservation) i get another call, from guess who... Johnny, wanting to reconfirm the reservation. At this point i was getting annoyed and reconfirmed yet again, but when he asked me for the Omakase form I had it and told him to go to his fax machine where he would find the form. Sure enough, after now talking to the manager, (Johnny couldn't take the heat) they found the fax, EUREKA!We get to the restaurant and decided to go downstairs to the bar first and have their amazing white Lilly cocktail but checked in at the front and saw johnny, who was not over excited to hear my name on the reservation. We had our drink then were taken to the Omakase table. The whole section was empty but we were sat right by the entrance to the kitchen (what a surprise). It is obvious Johnny had his revenge well planned out..... Now to the Omakase experience, its NOT WORTH IT at all. It used to be a special experience to get the Omakase and i emphasis used to be. We ended up spending a good amount of money on the Omakase and Bottle of Sake but the service and experience was totally not worth it. The food served that evening was at best OK and the service was anything but special or memorable. To the manager and to johnny, you guys should do a better job to honor and protect what Chef Morimoto created. My recommendation: you are much better off sitting at the regular tables and order from the menu. Morimotos food is usually really good and you seldom go wrong.

The rock shrimp appetizer is just an explosion of flavor, and I was a big fan of the tuna ""pizza"" (with olives, anchovy aïoli, and jalapeño) to start. Had a sushi plate to share for 2, and the fish was very well cut. Only slight complaint is that the sushi always contains a bit of wasabi between the fish and the rice, so if you're not careful the wasabi can be dangerous. The lychee cocktail was delightful - aromatic and not too sweet, and not overwhelmingly strong with the alcohol.

The lobster tempura maki roll they had on special was tasty, but the cilantro was a little overpowering.For entrees, the Ishi Yaki 'Buri Bop' was good, but again not extraordinary. They do prepare it in front of you, which is kind of cool, but they are literally just searing pieces of tuna sashimi in front of you. Eh. If I came back, I probably would not order this again.

It took us about an hour to get drinks, and then our food started coming out all wrong and in reverse order, etc etc. We felt ignored and were really disappointed. Anyway, my point is, I brought this to the attention of Tammie, the manager, and she did a fantastic job and salvaged our experience. She made sure we got everything we need, comped our meal entirely, and brought out some extra desert stuff complete with candles when she heard it was my girlfriend's birthday. A lesser restaurant would've just given free desert/drinks and apologized, but they really do hold to a high standard at Morimoto.

They have two great problems: their menu and service.This, in entirety, is how the menu describes the sushi and sashimi combinations they offer:Chef's sushi combination-50/95/[price 3]/[price 4]Chef's sashimi combination-[four different prices]On a separate page, again without any further explanation:Seasonal chef's sushi combination-[price]Seasonal chef's sashimi combination-[another price]Perhaps focussing on sushi for our main course wasn't the best decision (though the sushi choices did take up a large part of the menu). We asked our waiter about the combinations, assuming that without a wordy menu, we'd have to rely on him to find out what to expect. But he couldn't explain the combinations to us accurately in several attempts. We were under the impression after his first explanation that we could combine our favorites from the maki and nigiri list, with different price points allowing more selection. Later we found out there's no choice and no ready estimate of the quantity to expect from the differently priced options. The most helpful comment the waiter could make was that the seasonal selection was more ""about quality"" whereas the chef's selections were ""about quantity.""We ended up ordering sushi a la carte to avoid further confusion. We ordered both maki and nigiri.When we ordered from the nigiri list, the waiter noted our order and confirmed ""two of each?"" We agreed two of each would be sufficient as we wanted variety. Later when our check arrived we realized the menu listed the nigiri per piece, and we were paying $10-12 apiece. In itself, that would hardly bother us-if only the menu was less at fault and not so vague about quantity. And if only the nigiri was exceptional in any way (the rice fell apart too soon for what we were paying.) I don't fault the waiter here-it was our choice not to ask further questions.A few other subtle incidents shape my current opinion: we were offered a choice between seats at the traditional live cooking bar and a proper table. We went for the first option. Since we were early, both legs of the L-shaped bar were mostly unoccupied. We were led to seats on the shorter leg of the bar just beside the point where it bent. The seats looked just fine at first, but we realized after being seated that our view was blocked by the smooth, curved wood which formed the corner of the bar instead of glass. Obviously we could have asked for different seats or just moved-but we didn't know then we were in a cafe.At another point during our meal, I pointed out to our waiter that a fly had somehow shown up in my third, freshly poured glass of sake (I was drinking from a carafe.) I just asked for a fresh glass. I didn't explicitly convey my suspicion that the fly came straight from the carafe. It would've been nice for him to inquire and perhaps bring me back a filled glass instead of an empty one.A smaller and simpler case in point: as we got our coats back, the person who handed them back had an expression on her face that conveyed grave disapproval. I'm not sure whether she was disappointed with the restaurant as well, or the way her day started, or our appearance. She handed both our coats back in a heap to one of us. I do realize I'm being very critical, but it just wasn't indicative of good service, nor the happiest way to greet customers on their way out. After all, we expressed none of our own disappointment to the staff, and did leave a reasonable tip.I hope Morimoto can improve on its menu and service if it hopes to cater to the dining market.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

On this particular visit, my friends and I decided to try Morimoto, which, for sushi and Asian cuisine lovers, as well as iron chef America fans, is a must. The first thing you notice when walking in is just how big this restaurant is. It's quite impressive that they can not only fill the place up, but also bang out such a high standard of food! The service is excellent and everyone from the hostess, to the waiter, to the servers live up the high standard previously mentioned! As usual, I wanted to try everything on the menu, but had to settle for 1 appetizer, 1sushi course, a main and a dessert! I started with some nice 'ginjo' sake, served chilled, the way it's supposed to be!For sushi, I went with 2 sashimi: first was the octopus followed by a special striped jack tuna! Octopus was nothing special, but that tuna might've been the best piece of fish I've ever eaten! I followed that with the seared scallops in XO sauce, topped with crispy onions and bok choy! The scallops were cooked to perfection and the sauce was out of this world... I actually stole my friend's spoon just to make sure I finished the last bit of broth from my plate!For the main course, I shared a 20 ounce wagyu beef rib eye. I had never tried wagyu beef. Although it was just a little tougher than I expected, it was still melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The sear and temperature on it were also perfect. For dessert, I also shared their monki-banana bread. I usually avoid ordering dessert at restaurants, but I would go back to morimoto just for the banana bread! It was THAT good!I'm happy this place was able to live up the the expectations and even surpass them in some instances.

(Honestly, we were so bogged down with work lately, we didn't think to make reservations anywhere until the week before... And these days, reservations in nyc need to be made exactly one month before, 28 days before... It's really become such a hassle!) I was just wary of going to go to  Morimoto since I haven't been eating any sashimi or sushi after suffering terribly from food poisoning from bad sushi a couple years ago in Atlantis. And, that coupled with seeing parasites at work... That people got from eating sushi.... So without knowing what I should get and just half excited about the meal, we arrived at the restaurant. But all I kept seeing on my last minute yelp reviews was Omakase... The host was extremely friendly and our head waitress was sweet. However, the table we were sitting at was not even a foot away from the table next to us. We were uncomfortable and we can sense that the other party was quite uncomfortable too since we can hear everything any one person said. Then, the first food server of the Omakase just threw us off. He brought out the first dish and my husband and I were just really impressed by the presentation and again, we could barely hear him since the table next to us was talking about the lady's lobster dish... I assume that the server greeted us but since we didn't respond, he very rudely says, ""I'm doing fine! Thanks for asking!"" And storms off... My husband, myself and the couple next to us all sat there with our mouths open at his obnoxious behavior. But, that was really easily forgotten since the rest of the service was really nice and the omakase was truly wonderful. Thank you, fellow helpers! I really have nothing bad to say about it, I really want to go have it again. We'll probably go again sometime for the king crab and maybe the Omakase again.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Despite the early arrival, the service was great; our server was extremely helpful with regards to choosing dishes and drinks. We started with some whitefish carpaccio and rock shrimp tempura, both of which were pretty good. For our main dishes, we had the ishi yaki buri bop, which was my favorite dish of the meal. The fried rice went really well with the yellowtail, which was very fresh. We also had the duck, duck, duck, which was pretty good, along with some uni and tori roll. In general, the food was fairly fresh and tasty, but only the yellowtail bibimbap was something that really stood out to me. For dessert, we had the 5-year aged sake (tastes more like whiskey than sake) and the warm chocolate cake with blood orange sorbet and truffle honey. The blood orange sorbet was nice, but I found the cake to be a bit dry and the truffle honey pairing a bit puzzling.The ambiance is pretty swanky, and it's probably a cool place to bring people from out of town for a good meal with great service.

For example, we never hear of the rare salmon (oh-torro?) and Japanese Beef that were delicasies. Sorry I dont remember the exact names. You can blame the cocktails for that.We started off with a few sushi rolls - spicy salmon and eel avocado roll. We followed that with the Crispy Shrimp Tempura. Our Entrees were the Duck Breast and the Austrailian Waygu Filet. Both were amazing. Last but not least, we enjoyed the Chocolate Cake with Caramel Popcorn and Coconut Sorbet. Ive been to a lot of GOOD restaurants across the country, but its safe to say that this is easily one of the BEST restaurants period. Service was stellar, food was out of this world.

I was disappointed but we had waited a while so clearly there was no other table. In the area we sat had maybe 4 tables include ours, two of the groups looked like tourists group, so didn't dress like I thought we supposed to. Maybe female hostess put us that table because when I talked to her, I didn't understand some of the things she said? She didn't like foreigners?I don't know, but was sad that I didn't really enjoy atmosphere. My husband told male hostess that this was for our anniversary dinner and we checked coats, so they saw how we dressed. If I was the hostess, I would never give that table for anniversary dinner couple.In addition, the whole area was so cold!!! Anyway, all food we ordered was delicious. We had beef carpaccio and crispy shrimp for appetizer. My husband got grilled chicken, I had duck for main. We shared tiramisu for dessert. My favourite was beef carpaccio, amazing!!! For drink, my husband had beer. I had cocktail Hydrangea and it was very tasty.Overall, delicious food and drink, but we didn't enjoy atomosphere at all for my anniversary date night.Maybe I should've let my husband make reservation or talked hostes then she could give us better table...?  We don't like complain , so we said nothing.

We arrived exactly on time for our reservation, yet we had to wait 15 minutes while others came in and were seated immediately. Nobody explained why or spoke to us about it, so we were a little confused. I was feeling a little reluctant and we hadn't even sat down yet.COCKTAILS ($14 each): My husband ordered the Morimotini (wasabi infused vodka, sake, cucumbers) and it was very delicious. I ordered the Camellia but I am pretty sure they gave me the wrong drink - it supposedly had cranberry, elderflower and sake, but when it came out, it was BRIGHT red (like Kool-Aid) and I could not taste any of those ingredients. It actually tasted exactly like Hawaiian punch.  I sent it back, the manager came over to help me choose another drink, and the Camellia was never added to the bill. My second drink was much better.MEAL: We went with the 7-course Omakase tasting menu. It was quite tasty, although the portions were TINY and for the price ($125) I would have expected a little more. We have done tasting menus at many high-end restaurants, including Per Se, and I think the Morimoto Omakase would have been better priced at $90 or $100 a person. Granted, it did include wagyue beef, lobster, sushi and foie gras, but... definitely not worth $125. Tip not included, unlike other restaurants' tasting menus. Seating was a little weird (bench on one side and chairs on the other) because you are SUPER close to other couples. I heard the whole conversation of the couple next to me. I'd want something a little more cozy instead of being crammed in like sardines. Overall, nice night. A little more money than I think it was worth, but good food.

We also ordered the Toro Tartare which was really lovely taste-wise although extremely pricy. It was a little strange to have with the selection of guac, sour cream, soy sauce, etc. For dessert my friends got me a matcha tiramisu was lovely, the texture of the ice cream was divine combined with the elements of a tiramisu dessert. We also ordered the tofu cheesecake to try something new. I can definitely vouch for all of my friends when we all agreed that it was a strange experience.

I took my girlfriend there for her birthday hoping she go insane considering she is a die hard Japanese food fan. When we first stepped in the first thing we noticed was the decorum: This place is beautiful and well put together with subtle nuances that really contribute to the overall outstanding ambiance of the restaurant. Once we're seated we were greeted by our waiter who was a nice lady but I felt kept pressuring us to buy the more expensive items on the menu. We ultimately went with two Surf and Turf's for main courses, spicy salmon roll, spicy tuna roll, and a California roll, and for an appetizer the Morimoto sashimi. The first thing to land in front of us was disappointment: 6 pieces of sashimi for $28. This was so egregiously overpriced the succeeding day I was expecting to see gold when I used the bathroom. But hey don't get me wrong they were really good and very well presented but for the price, I feel as if I could've gotten a better bang for my buck. Then our sushi and entrées came. Now for all those who are planning to go there the surf and turf is a dish composed of herbed potatoes and a skirt steak of the infamous wagyu beef. Wagyu is supposed to be this otherworldly experience that will transform your taste buds to a new dimension that is only composed of rainbows and happiness. These expectations, however, did not come to fruition. Instead I was served a medium-rear piece of flavorless meat that was not in the slightest bit juicy or tender. I have the hinting suspicion that they didn't even season the damn thing. I have enjoyed better pieces of meat from longhorn steakhouse than this place. It was a lackluster dish with albeit really good potatoes. Now on to the sushi! Being die hard sushi addicts, my girlfriend and I have made it our life goal to try every sushi joint in NYC. So needless to say we have at least some experience with sushi. The sushi at this place was pretty good but not mind blowing. I have had better and more flavorful sushi than this place. But it was pretty good, the salmon was smooth and tuna fatty with the California roll being decent as well.

For God sakes, you pay a pretty high amount for below average quality sushi by the piece. If you are here for the sushi alone, you can easily find better in the city. Even if you are a roll person (Crunchy, California, Eel avocado, etc), there is definitely much better quality rolls a block away. For their entrees, I haven't had anything that has any sort of WOW factor to it. This is a definite trendy, pretty and place to be seen kind of restaurant, but should not be a place for major foodies. And I totally cringe my teeth when I think of value of the sushi (I don't even cringe this much over $500/person Masa). Now for the good and reason why I don't give this place two stars - It really is an awesome place to hang with friends and have drinks. I've been here many many times over my last 3 years here in New York and many of these times, some members of my party don't eat at all and instead opt for drinks. We spend time enjoying the restaurant's incredible drink selection and dessert. Service is OK - hit or miss. Sushi for the most part is way overpriced and below average quality. But you are in a pretty place with a cool vibe. Would recommend if you are about to go out nearby or want a cool vibe with great drinks. Would not recommend if you are looking for a great sushi spot in the city.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
871,XYhe2a1QBF_hXLKvhBLPuw,Tony T.,3.0 star rating,"Had a few appetizers and entrees along with sushi this time. The beef carpaccio had sesame & hot oil. The beef a little overcooked but tasty. The oyster foie gras had beautiful plating and tasted decadent. The foie gras was seared perfectly, and the oyster warm but not fully cooked. The uni that came with it was not cooked and very fresh. If I could get only one appetizer at Morimoto it would be the spicy king crab, which has sweet crabmeat and spicy sauce on top.For sushi we got eel, which was smoked and well cooked. The ikura was salty & briny. The specials were sockeye salmon, white eel, and red snapper. The sockeye salmon was lean and the white eel was a little bony and tasted like eel but different than the regular smoked eel that I am used to. The tai (red snapper) was a little tougher than I thought it would be but it was still a very tasty white fish. We got some rolls and the softshell crab roll had perfectly cooked crab but the asparagus was not a necessary addition to the roll. The spicy tuna roll  was good but there was nothing special about it. The salmon skin roll had crunchy skin but I would have liked more skin. The otoro was perfect and it melted in my mouth. This is always my favorite pieceof sushi/sashimi.For the entrees we tried wagyu beef bibimbap. The beef was fatty and melted in my mouth similar to the otoro. The rice was good but a few more vegetables would be nice in the dish. The duck duck duck had three different preparations of duck. Each piece of duck had crunchy skin, and all three sauces served with the duck were good. There was no gamey taste at all to the duck. They tried to do a take on Peking duck but bread was too soggy to make it successful.Overall this is an impressive place to bring out of town guests and the fish is always fresh.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

They were pretty reasonable for that type of restaurant. Huge plus :)as for the food, It was good. I have the cod with the black edamame. I wouldn't say it was AMAZING, but It was good. maybe I didn't order the right thing? I am asian and use to a lot of the flavors he uses in his food, it could also be that.I had an orange martini (forgot the name)..but I didn't like it.I would visit here again tho, its one of the places I would go back to several times to try everything on the menu.Don't get me wrong though, although the food was good.

By no means was this Morimoto bad, but for the high prices here I expected more.Food:Fresh ingredients and dishes are presented nicely in general. Omakase is available, although we opted for the regular menu this time. Highlights included the Morimoto sashimi, and the ishi yuri buri bop which is prepared tableside in a hot stone bowl. All the dishes we ordered were certainly good, The desserts also failed to meet my expectations; the menu had a high proportion of Western desserts. Our waiter informed us of a ""monkey bread"" dessert special which I opted for; it ended up being overly sweet and way too large for a dessert portion.Service:For a restaurant of this caliber, I felt that Morimoto fell short. Service just wasn't attentive enough, and on several occasions we had to ask for refills of water/tea, or for finished plates to be cleared. Our waiter also felt it necessary to continually come to our table to ask how everything was after each dish was presented - not a huge deal, but by the time we had finished with appetizers and gotten to the main dishes, it seemed a bit overbearing. The sushi bar left out a bit of our sashimi order, but when we pointed out the error to our waiter they promptly brought out what was missing. Setting/ambience:The restaurant is decorated in a trendy and somewhat minimalistic way; dim colored lighting, a folded-cloth-style ceiling, and Japanese toilets all make for a cool vibe. Unfortunately, the section we were seated in was fairly cramped, understandably so since it was a Saturday night. Overall, although I enjoyed the food, the subpar service and lack of anything truly memorable means I most likely will not be returning here.

We ordered the burger and the black cod, which came with some sides of miso soup, salad and pickled vegetables which were all pretty standard tasting. The cod was cooked very well, very moist, and the sauce on it was delicious. We also got some maki rolls, which were very good as well, the fish was super fresh and high quality, and even the wasabi was good. We got both of the desserts offered, profiteroles and a coffee sort of custard with ice cream. The custard was a pretty sizable portion and definitely curbed any sugar craving I had beforehand!

The wait staff was amazing, very courteous and knowledgeable.The specialty drinks were refreshing and strong as well as rather tasty. The only problem is that took some time to get to the table, as did the subsequent drinks. The food was simply fantastic. They do have a tasting menu for a very reasonable $132, but we ordered off the menu as some of our party was on a diet and they recommend everyone at the table get the chef's menu. The tuna tartar appetizer was amazing, the rock shrimp were pretty good, but they were just shrimp. The bone marrow appetizer was very tasty.As for the entrees, I got the duck duck duck which was very satisfying, basically roast duck, duck confit and duck egg,I love duck eggs. The sushi there was out of this world, and the fish dishes were scrumptious. You can't go wrong ordering anything here, But what else would you expect from Iron Chef Japanese!

883,kXCqZwnoDS8ekCOLIfWgig,Oshun A.,5.0 star rating,"My fiance & I have our subjectively high standards for food, as I am a seasoned cook and he is a health enthusiast. We're also very selective when it comes to what we drop a good bit of money on. Morimotos NYC was an experience I won't forget.We decided to introduce ourselves to his cooking style by ordering the eight course Morimoto Omakase, served alongside some very good sakes and mineral water. This was meant to be a tasting menu & an example of the best the restaurant has to offer.First off, please understand this is not an ""Asian Restaurant"". It's a fusion restaurant. Although Morimoto was trained in sushi and traditional Kaiseki cuisine, he has been influenced by Western dishes in the U.S., and has let this influence his creations. So if you're looking for something that will satisfy a strict Asian palette, this probably isn't going to be your cup of tea. We started out with a very delicate, conservative portion of Otoro Tartare. The Otoro (belly of the bluefin tuna, containing enough fat to melt in your mouth) came with several miniature condiment samples, including crème fraîche, nori paste, chives, wasabi, rice crackers and avacado paste. It indeed melted in my mouth and left me ready for more. The Fluke Sashimi deserves its own review..This was the most wonderfully cut and seasoned sashimi I've ever had, and I believe I had an orgasm in my mouth. The essence of this is so complex, and the flavors blend together like magic. Afterwards came my seared Kampache Sashimi Salad, which is a mild kampachi fish over microgreens with a light apple vinegrette. It was delicious, but it does't hold a candle to the Fluke Sashimi.We then tasted a dish that resembled a fondue, with individual dipping ceramic bowls over warming candles full of an anchovy sauce. My tongue went straight back to a heavenly dimension in space.. the salad before seemed to have cleaned my palette and prepared me for this. Afterwards came a dish that was both interesting and appealed to more than one sense. It was a sample of seafood served in a shell over a bed of sweetgrass, with incense burning underneath. Yes, there was burning sweetgrass inside the bowl! It was amazing, and I felt like I was sitting in a forest floor while I had my dinner. They then brought us plates of Nigiri Sushi, which was quite impressive. And I've had some very good sushi. There was a taste of squid, in which the texture was perfect in comparison to what I've had in the past. Our next course was lobster and a piece of Wagyu steak wrapped around sweet potatoes. This was the tastiest steak I've ever had in my life. Lobster was even great, even though I'm not a big fan of lobster. (generally too ""sweet"" of a meat for me)We then enjoyed three samples of desserts. The first was an impressive pickled watermelon over frozen, watermelon puree with a dash of yogurt. Healthy, non fattening, and absolutely delicious. The second desert was a green tea tiramisu covered in mascarpone mousse with cherry blossom flavors peeking throughout, and our third was a small pastry ball I didn't recognize. This wasn't my favorite, although it was still very edible. My favorite of the desserts had to be the watermelon one, simply because it was both amazing to the taste and the most unique and healthy dessert I'd ever tried. The sake was wonderful as well, but that is an entirely different review. Overall, this was an incredible dining experience complete with a well trained staff and bathrooms you could live in. Yes, the bathroom experience was unique as well. I encountered heated toilet seats, a bidet with multiple settings, automatically raising seat covers and an infinity mirror in the background with cherry blossoms that made me feel like I was relieving myself on some kind of lucid dream plane. And the Morimoto Omakase is designed to be just enough food to fill up a human quite perfectly.

I was actually on the search for a nice Japanese restaurant to celebrate an early Valentine's and a late anniversary. (Better late than never, but never late is better)We actually arrived 25 minutes past our reservation time but we had been seated fairly quickly despite losing the reservation. I haven't heard much about this restaurant before I found it but I decided to give it a shot. It was a bit crowded upon arrival, but that's expected in NYC at 12am. AMBIANCE:I must say, this is THE fanciest Japanese restaurant I have ever set foot in. Sliding glass doors, dimmed lights, beautiful settings. It made my eating experience so much better - perfect for a romantic night out. The top floor is gigantic. At the backside you can see the Chefs grilling/wrapping away. There is also a wall by the staircase leading to the lower floor that is compiled of glass cups/bottles, very creative. Downstairs includes a bar (also the waiting area once you check in) and more seating. Cellular service is weak down here, fyi. I only had one tiny issue with Morimoto, which may be more or less severe for others - the restrooms. Although the restrooms' decor was unique, including the Jap-tech heated toilets which meticulously clean and dry your bottom, I can't say the restrooms were as clean as you'd expect from a place like this. The men's restroom in particular had dirty and wet floors in the stalls, which reminded me of a restroom in a KTV lounge 4 hours into the night. Restrooms being plural because my SO saw some vomit in the stall of the ladies'. But hey, this isn't enough to take a star off this review - it's not like I took my dinner to the restroom! (Maybe I did.. post-processing)SERVICE:One word, three letters - WOW. Once we arrived and checked in to our reservation, we were offered coat check (don't worry, it's free). Since we had to wait a few minutes for our table, we were told to wait downstairs by the bar and help ourselves to some of their delicious cocktails. Instead of a flashing beeper, text or call, the waiter/waitress would come downstairs and find us! Once we were seated, Alex (the waiter) offered us drinks and explained the menu. They were very observant about our water, refilling it without us ever asking or waiting. The food was served in a timely manner and it seems that Morimoto has a large employee count. Each plate brought to our table was brought by a different server and thoroughly described.FOOD:Ah, the moment you have been waiting for. You've been dying to know how my taste buds reacted. We both ordered the Omakase ($135) and I also ordered the Rock Shrimp Tempura and Half Dozen Oysters appetizers (thanks to the Yelpers for recommending these). I won't waste your time by describing every single course because it'll just make you salivate. Plus this review is already too long. Omakase: (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR FIRST TIMERS)- small portions, but it will fill you up- delicious (currently daydreaming about the toro tartare)- sashimi was 100% fresh- taste was very authentic and satisfying - even smelled amazing - in reference to the seared scallop on a bed of rosemary- dessert was amazing, though the yogurt/black sesame mochi may not be favorable by some since the yogurt was a bit sour. But I L-O-V-E-D it.Half Dozen Oysters:- 3 different seasonings- as fresh as the Fresh Prince of Bel Air- no ""fishy"" taste whatsoever- just slurp awayYamamomo fruit:- this small, red fruit appeared in some of the courses, a sweet fruit (careful, has a pit)Cocktails:- ordered the Elderflower (champagne with a yamamomo in it) which was okay.- also ordered the Hydrangea (forgot the details of the contents) which was very tasty, have a few of these and you'll find yourself wobbling home!COST:This is the only advice I will give - DON'T THINK ABOUT IT. Go in there and remember that this is Morimoto, the house of the Iron Chef! This won't be your typical night out. Your wallet may shrink a bit, but hey, it's so worth it!

896,m_1QgEWdcEIY4D-CrWzDMA,The Sushi Legend ..,4.0 star rating,"Morimoto is prototypical New York; trendy, packed, loud, but above all else, good. In fact, it's actually phenomenal, which I was shocked to find myself saying. Usually when a place has so much hype for sushi, it's because it appeals to the lowest common denominator with great maki rolls with ""americanized"" ingredients. Certainly Morimoto has it's fair share of spicy sauces, but it also has incredibly fresh and unique sushi that still manages to appeal to even the snobbiest of sushi connoisseurs. The Food is incredibly unique. Take the Toro Tartar (pictured right) for example - it comes finely chopped on a slab with ""caviar"" on top. While the accompanying sauces and garnishes aren't for me, the tartar certainly is; the colour is as you'd expect with Toro, and the taste is outstanding. If you've heard of Morimoto before, you've certainly heard about this appetizer - and it lives up to the hype. In addition to the sashimi platter, I also did my usual and ordered a piece of nigiri that I had never tried. In this case, the lucky option was ""Sayori"", or Japanese Needle Fish. Tasted a little chewier than Iwashi (Sardine), which looks similar), but certainly worth it, minus the weird stares that I usually get when I order one piece of something no one at the table has ever heard of.Often times at these touristy restaurants, the food tends to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Usually at sushi restaurants, that means the fancy/cool fish doesn't appear on the menu, but Morimoto bucks that trend; there's plenty of options for both the snob and the rookie. The Atmopshere  is great,  buoyed by excellent service, awesome decor and very high ceilings. We had multiple family members order drinks and deserts over the phone for my date's birthday; all were delivered to the table on time, without a problem.

We went a little overboard and ordered 7 appetizers, 5 entrees, and 5 desserts.The appetizers:- Toro Tartare - excellent, but overhyped- 1 lb Lobster from the raw bar- excellent, I LOVED it- Seared Scallops- perfectly done. I don't really like scallops but I liked this dish- Wagyu beef carpaccio - my favorite of the bunch- crispy rock shrimp tempura- good, but nothing special, also kind of heavy- oyster foie gras- YUMMY. gave the wagyu a run for its money- sauteed foie gras and grilled eel - really good, but the oyster foie gras was betterThe entrees:- Duck Duck Duck - awesome, but the duck was a little hard to cut (too much fat/bone)- Braised black cod - good, but not as amazing as the waitress made it out to be- toban yaki - very yummy, lots of different kinds of seafood in a curry type broth- eel avocado roll - standard- sashimi: uni, hamachi, saba, aji, and sake - so fresh and delicious. I usually don't like uni but have to admit this uni was pretty good.The desserts:- chilled cheesecake souffle - YUM- apple bread pudding - Pretty good! Came with a lot of diced fruit on the side- warm chocolate cake - Very good, even though I don't like chocolate flavored things- mori-monkey bread - Barely touched it, was super cute though- tofu cheesecake - Good, a little flavorless, but came with a powdered matcha dip that made it specialI also have to make a special note of the White Lily mocktail- easily the most delicious mocktail I've had all year. We also each ordered a pot of tea at the end and all really liked our own- I got the cool mint and enjoyed it thoroughly.I think it would've been cheaper if we did omakase for everyone but I am glad we went a la carte and tried everything we wanted to, instead of leaving it up to the chef.I definitely recommend Morimoto if you want a perfect evening. Our waitress was awesome (all of the people working there were great), service was speedy and attentive, the ambiance is great, and the lighting is rather flattering ;) The setup of the restaurant also makes it a great place to go on dates because the layout gives each table sufficient privacy and intimacy.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

For example, the toro tartare, the wasabi, chives, seaweed, avocado puree, rice cracker looks like a rainbow. When you mix it together and eat it together with the tartare, it adds so much texture in the mouth! As for the oyster foie gras, the uni and foie gras makes the oyster takes so rich. How interesting it does not take away the taste of the oyster but add more depth to it! LOVE IT!!

Now flavor was exceptional on a few of our dishes and those deserve the 5 star limit (congee). The rating is just over all and because of the other lackluster meals. We had the duck and this is where the joy and hunger died. The white meat was tough, dry and flavorless. I was shocked but powered through dunking it in all the sauces. The breast was what I think the entire meal was suppose to taste like; heaven. The other lackluster meal was mine and my partners sashimi/sushi. I suppose because I love the cook due to Iron Chef and all the hype on yelp we expected mind blowing orgasim inducing food. What we got was a tease and although it got things started it fell short on the promise. All the meals were shared aside from the raw food and sadly we had a bit of upset stomachs later in the night.

I would give the food 8/10 and the service 10/10. We were 20 min late for our reservation and yet they kindly accommodated us. The tuna tartare course was cool and tasty. I was not a big fan of the miso fondue dish. I loved the scallop. I wish there was a sashimi course as part of Omakase. My favorite course by far was the lobster and wagyu beef.

Each bento box came with a small salad, miso soup, assorted pickled veggies, a bowl of rice, and an entree. You could pick your entree from a list that included: fish, beef, maki, sashimi, etc. I chose the (cooked) fish while my friend chose the beef. Both were absolutely delicious. The fish was cooked to perfection and very moist. However, it did get pretty salty by the end -- I couldn't quite finish it :( The miso soup was so yummy! For dessert, I chose to have the coffee/chocolate over the pistachio ice cream dessert. The dessert was so so good. I would definitely recommend the coffee/chocolate one (although I can't exactly remember what it was called haha). As far as atmosphere, when we entered, the wind was blowing pretty hard, so the red curtains were being sucked into the sliding door hahaha. It made me laugh because the door kept trying to close but there were these stupid curtains stuck in the way.

We walked up to an unmarked building and based on the red curtains in draped in a signature Japanese style, we knew it was Morimoto. The restaurant is very chic and modern and service was great. My only grip with this place is that our table was small and we ordered lots of food, so it got really tight. My bf ordered the following for us: Appetizers:Toro tartareOyster foie grasMorimoto SashimiEntree:Ramen SoupSeafood Toban YakiWhole roasted lobsterDessert:Tofu hot and coldCan't complain about much, except for the fact that we were so full our stomachs hurt. The dishes were pieces of art and I can't get over the presentation. The toro tartare was a palette of extremely fresh toro and assorted sauces. The food was so delicate and fresh it melts in literally your mouth. The ramen was very simple and at first glance, I thought, ""That's it?"" But don't be fooled by the simple clear broth and noodles. There was something about that broth that was unlike any other. No need for spices and garnishes, it was perfect the way it was. The noodles were amazing. Yes, it's an expensive restaurant, but worth the try if you've never been. Definitely get the desserts! It compliments your meal and it's yummy.

Let that settle in for a second. The restaurant is aesthetically beautiful; I love all the white and glass look. Feels very modern. The wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly as well. What also stood out was that the portions were normal sizes unlike a lot of fancy Japanese restaurants I've been to where the flavors are good, but you leave hungry.My best friend was visiting from DC, and we decided to go on a whim with a 10PM reservation on a Sunday. The place still felt happening. The food was fantastic, the perfect blend of east meets west. We ordered several appetizers to share and our own entrees. The oyster foie gras and dobin mushi were two amazing highlights for me. Now I have to go back and do the ""morimoto omakase"" aka chef's tasting menu, hopefully with a boyfriend.

915,cHCo0_gLW1OzenuTPNY2uQ,Marina C.,3.0 star rating,"3 stars and I'm being quite generous.I love Morimoto, but I was completely underwhelmed by his entrees. We had dinner there on New Years Eve, it was packed, we were seated right away with reservations.The decor was minimalistic, very modern. Loved it. For appetizers, we had the toro tartare, it was great combined with the various condiments given, however, by itself, it didn't seem that ""fresh"". Who really minces toro anyway? I'm glad I tried it.. (Morimoto made something very similar to this on an Iron Chef America episode.) Does it live up to the hype? yes and no. Do I love guacamole, sour cream, those little rice crackers? yes, yes and yes. Would it taste great paired with almost anything.. YES!  See my point?We also had the tuna pizza which was a nice surprise, all the ingredients worked beautifully. Simple, but very nicely done. The last appetizer was the kakuni which was just okay. The pork belly was stringy and it was so salty, there wasn't enough congee to dilute the amount of sweet and savory sauce that was on top. Sad to say, it was probably the worse pork belly we've ever had, and when is pork belly ever bad?During our appetizers, the lady to my left ordered the ramen soup - which is NOT a true ramen by any means, it's chicken consommé with noodles. The only reason I noticed, was the intense chicken broth smell that wafted in my direction. $15 is insane for something anyone can make at home. Our entrees were very disappointing, but I had a feeling it would before dining. Nothing really stood out to me, so I settled on the chef combination sushi, Although the fish was fresh, it lacked something.. I don't even think I was that full, but I couldn't finish it. It was somewhat bland and boring.  I'd rather get sushi at Yasuda's. L had the Surf and Turf. It was australian wagyu so it didn't have the fat or flavor Kobe beef has. I thought it was bland, L thought it had too much pepper. Why did I suggest ordering the Duck, Duck, Duck entree after both disappointing dishes? So I didn't have to waste a second visit to taste this popular dish which receives such fantastic reviews on Yelp...Seriously?!! It was horrible, I had a bite of each component. The best part of the dish was the croissant and even that was a total let down because once paired with the duck, it was completely soft and limp. The duck leg was dry and the sauces that came with it was too overpowering. Even the slightest dab of sauce was too much. Even the worse Peking duck from a Chinese BBQ shop beats Morimoto's duck.I had three drinks, the Hydrangea, Snapdragon and an Orange Blossom. Had I been slightly intoxicated, perhaps the food would've tasted better. The drinks were good, not great. Nobu's are much better.2 stars - Service was wonderful, especially on a busy holiday. I loved how all the staff worked together, from the busboys to the the managers. The hostesses were very friendly.1 star - Come for the futuristic decor, lovely atmosphere and a few drinks, don't stay for dinner. This is the second Morimoto location I've dined at and probably my last. You're simply paying for the name, the food is not Iron Chef worthy.

The toro tartare was good enough, but the flavor mix that came with it did not really hit home.

There was a lot of fish, but quality should come first......coming from an iron chef restaurant.......I didn't even finish the bowl, which said something....especially since I was paying for a nice meal(this never happens).The chopsticks looked cool and the bathroom toilet was bidet styled, but I really would have preferred simplistic style with quality in the food.

The heavenly taste reminisced in here, with some nostalgia, made me almost forget to mention the burger was served in a set of the previously cited salads and pickle, with the sweet potato chips substituting the steamed rice.    Two desserts made it to the table to perfect the meal (as if the meal had not reached the highest of perfection at that point, already!).  One of the desserts was a coffee infused chocolate mousse with roasted sesame seeds  (and some chopped coffee beans), and a light caramel sauce.  It was very refreshing, indeed.  The other dessert was a lemon tart with a side of pistachio ice cream, and sparkled with roughly chopped pistachios.  Although I am not really into lemon tarts, I must confess the taste was inviting, and the ice cream was very rich in flavor.  The addition of fresh pistachios did take the whole platter to another level, admittedly.That particular afternoon infused happiness and culinary satisfaction to my taste palate.  It was such a whole experience on so many levels: service, design, atmosphere, taste and presentation.  The company of the Iron Chief (as in the courses enjoyed that were created by him) was worth every dollar spent.  It was everything.  And therefore, I am going back soon, but this time my location will be at table number 35 to soak in all the design of the dining room from a wide angle, while watching people in the breaks I will have between my bites (and I assure you those breaks are truly short at Morimoto since every bite invites the next, promptly!).  (Review of Morimoto Lunch Visit on Wednesday, March 5th, 2014)",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The cocktails are pricey at $14 apiece, but they're both refreshing and strong.  My hydrangea had touches of lychee.Service was attentive, but not overbearing, although our elderly male waiter somehow morphed into a twenty-something, skinny girl by the time we ordered dessert.  That's never happened before... not that this caused a hitch in service.Oh, and the flowers suspended in the clear back wall of each bathroom stall mesmerized me.  ...There's a sentence I never thought I would write.  If my bathroom was like that, I'd hang out in there all the time, kthxbye!And if you're lucky enough, you may just see the Iron Chef himself floating around.  After we checked in with the hostess, we spotted an Asian man just hanging out by the staircase and stared at him, checking out his side profile for a few minutes (""is that Morimoto?""  ""maybe it's some other Asian guy.""  ""it kind of looks like him..."") before I just walked up to him and asked him if he was Iron Chef Morimoto.  And with the straighest face ever, he looked at me and told me he was his twin brother.  Good one, Iron Chef.  Morimoto was friendly and hailed a waiter over so we could snap a photo with him.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Rice was hard, the quality of the fish did not match the price point, all of the sashimi tastes the same-tasteless (how long have they been left in the fridge?). Also steer away from the ramen soup, the ramen is just flat white noodle(never seen that kind of ramen noodle), the soup tastes artificial, is too salty and greasy and the portion is ridiculously small.

I had the black cod (thanks to yelp recommendations!) and it was amazing! The only place I've had a dish like this was in Japan when I was younger, so I was definitely brought back to my childhood! This is a great restaurant week deal because usually a meal here is over $100. For $25 we got a plate of soup, salad, entree and dessert (which was okay). For entrees, my friends got the ribs and the burger, and they enjoyed both. For dessert, I'd say the cream puffs were the winner. The other dessert just had too much whipped cream. A tip- check out the bathrooms in the basement! They are incredible! The reason it's not 5 stars is because I do not think my entree would have been worth paying $25+ alone.. So I would not want to come back when it's full price. Also, the rice was a little to dry, which is not really ok at a five star Japanese restaurant.

BUT, I think that some of the dishes were highly overrated and not worth the price tag.Toro tartare - the dish that everyone RAVES about -- I thought it was completely overrated. Yes, the presentation was nice.. but if you think about it, it's just like negitoro (minus the negi -- green onion -- part), on a wooden block. The dipping ""sauce"" was just soba dipping sauce, I think. The 5 types of sauces? Everyday household stuff, like rice crackers, seaweed paste (the kind that I grew up eating on rice.. they sell them in jars, CHEAP, at any Japanese market!), guacamole, sour cream... come on. Not special. Is that really worth $31? Is the caviar even necessary?However, their baked oyster with uni and seared foie gras, doused in teriyaki sauce, was AWESOME. It was so good that I had to order a second plate. I can't say no to foie..The kakuni (stewed pork belly) appetizer? Also awesome. Melt-in-your-mouth pork, with SO much flavor!My black cod with a ginger-soy reduction was great! It was flavorful, and the fish was nice and tender. However.. it's a very simple dish to make. Is it really worth the price tag? Then again, even Nobu's miso-glazed cod is also uber-easy to make, so I guess it's standard at these Japanese fusion restaurants.The sea bass was.. well.. not as good. The fish itself was amazing - a nice, thick slab of bass, super moist and flaky. However, the flavoring just paled in comparison to the cod, because it was a lot more subtle.Dessert - Tofu ""hot and cold"" - A tofu cheesecake, along with a tofu souffle. Both were amazing... If I could eat these every day, I could totally be a vegetarian. 'Nuff said.So why not 5 stars? Yea, the price tag. A lot of these dishes were very cheap to make...

Unless the food was insanely cheap or insanely expensive, I didn't factor price into my review***So the apocryphal story goes that Atlanta pharmacist John Pemberton was trying to create a headache cure when, mixing chemicals haphazardly, he stumbled upon the formula for Coca-Cola. I mention it because most of the time, experimenting with known, well established ingredients fails miserably. But sometimes, just sometimes, it works.Morimoto is one of those times. This was the very first place we visited upon arriving in NY. It set the bar high. Had I reviewed it immediately afterwards, I would have given it five stars. Time (and eating at a multitude of other world-class restaurants) has a funny way of putting things into perspective though.The decor is upscale, neat, and functional. Save for a wall of back-lit glass bottles, it's surprisingly sparse. Overhead, there appears to be a draped cloth roof, though I suspect it's cleverly disguised corrugated metal. Oh, and check out the bathrooms. Aside from having an infinity mirror arrangement, the toilets also have remotes. Yes, seriously.The food was good, though overall the theme seemed to be ""cleverly executed twists on traditional dishes."" Does that count as culinary originality? You be the judge. We shared the toro tartare (Morimoto's signature dish) as an appetizer, the tuna was gorgeous and seemed to melt in your mouth. Eating it was unwieldy, as you're suppose to scrape the tuna with miniature ice-scrapers, then dip it into the piped sauces provided. Half the fun is in the inventive presentation, half the fun is laughing as your fellow diners try to eat it.I had a wagyu bento box, which I thought was reasonably priced (for NY) at $21. Everything in the box was top-notch, though nothing compelled me to come salivating back for more. The wagyu portion was a bit small at 3 or 4 slices. Though I appreciate the nod to Japanese authenticity (where beef protein is a small portion of the diet), the Texan in me demands.more.beef!Wifey ordered the angry chicken, another Morimoto stalwart. Again, perfectly cooked, flavorful yet slightly spicy. Honestly, perhaps the spice was a bit too subtle. Very good, but it lacked that ""WOW"" moment...which was pretty much the theme of the entire meal. Morimoto is worth a visit, and certainly worth the money, but much like watching Morimoto on Iron Chef, it never generates that jump-out-of-your-seat excitement that a few other restaurants in NY create.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
965,uMXTRNIR2yoCiFa5zLCJEQ,Annabel A.,4.0 star rating,"Came here with my fiancee on a Saturday night. The restaurant is right next to Chelsea market. A bit hard to find in the dark - we had walked right into Chelsea market not realizing it is actually located outside the market behind a large draped japanese curtain. Modern - very CLEAN looking decor. But not too trendy like many of the meatpacking restaurants. We got a tad-bit snooty vibe from the front of house lady which almost ruined my experience because she snapped at us for being 7 min late (it was a rainy night and traffic was bad!). Thank goodness our actual waitress was such a sweet japanese lady, this salvaged my YELP review despite the snooty waitress giving us a shaft table in the corner because ""you are so late we had to give up your table!"". Of course we had to try the omakase tasting menu since other Yelpers had been raving about it. It was pretty spectacular - although I really wished the portions were slightly larger. I am completely aware the idea is to have an adventurous meal of tiny tasting portions...but I did leave feeling like I could have eaten a slice of pizza. The nice thing about Morimoto's omakase menu is that they give you a good variety so you don't feel like you're just eating sashimi and more sashimi. Each of the 8 dishes was unique and left me thinking ""WOW this is new!"" whenever our waitress served us a dish. A particular standout for me was the yellow tail. I wish I could describe to you the flavours that entered my mouth but all I can remember was how rich, smooth and heavenly that dish tasted. The surf and turf was pretty awesome end to the meal as well (and the largest of the tiny servings hooray!). Not to mention, they give you TWO desserts. A couple of Yelpers had highlighted that the bathrooms had Japanese-like toilets with all the funky gadgets - so i made it a point to make an intentional trip to the ladies' room just to check out the fuss. I did not see anything special. It was a regular clean toilet with just a cool automatic sliding door. Would I return? Probably yes - it's a good place to bring an out of town guest. But my tip for hungry foodies is that it wouldn't hurt to grab a cocktail and some pre-dinner bites before the meal so your stomach will leave fully satisfied! =)",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I chose the latter because the person I was treating lives 30 seconds from M Wells and loves anything Japanese inspired. (It was his birthday and he's only been in the country for a few months. I figured it'd be somewhere fun to take him.)Tuna pizza, divine. Rock shrimp tempura, my God. My cocktail was delish. He opted for sushi and sashimi, and while it was no different than any other great sushi place, that's my fault for letting him do it. The service was great, our waitress was so friendly and attentive.We sat next to a couple's table that was up against the wall. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw something crawling up the wall and I spilled my cocktail all over the woman next to me. (Sorry again!) The man sitting next to it grabbed it with his napkin and said, ""I think I just got a free meal."" I sort of agreed but not so much; two omakase dinners aren't gonna be given away for free. The manager came over, swept up my mess, and asked if I wanted another drink. I said no because I was a little miffed about the bug.Anyway, at the end of our meals, the guy showed the bug to the waitress, who freaked. She immediately got the manager who came over, grabbed the napkin, and took it away. He comes back, tells the table, I'm sorry, but it happens. It's not a roach, it's a stink bug, and it just happens. Would you like a round of drinks or a free dessert? (After they had tons of both.) He asked the same of our table but at that point, I was over it.What bothered me was the manager's very nonchalant attitude about the ""stink bug"".I know how the game works. I spent a few miserable years as a server in my undergrad years. The owner was a family member, so I know how freebies are handled. Pretend to be a tad sincere, raise your eyebrows, nod your head. Simple. The manager should have been more accommodating of the table next to mine. I understand WHY you'd offer things they've already had enough of, but it was just too obvious. They declined. And for that, I took that free cocktail even though I didn't want it.The worst part of it all is that I'd probably go back, for just the friggin appetizers because they were so amazing, although I'd have to be pretty desperate.

We've walked by it several times, and are left with the mystery of what it's like inside. We walked in and were greeted by a very friendly hostess, who checked our coats. We were brought to our table, as the hostess walked away she wished me a ""Happy Birthday."" We had a view of the entire restaurant. I sat facing the sushi bar, where you can see most part of the kitchen. First off, my boyfriend and I have gone to tons and tons of sushi restaurants. Yet, we only have a handful that we keep on the roster. I guess we could be considered ""sushi snobs.""Our waitress came right over to us, asking which water we preferred. She was very nice, and totally patient, when we took a few minutes deciding what to drink. We each got a glass of wine. And started to plan out the food.This is what we ordered:Toro Tartare- Definitely must try if you come here! The presentation is awesome, and so vibrant. The toro is extremely fresh tasting, and the rows of add-on's make it fun to eat. I also was a big fan of whatever kind of sauce came with it.Bay Scallop Special- Not sure what they called this, it was one of the specials. We didn't realize that she had said bay scallops, which we usually don't like. However, these were delicious. They were in a brown butter sauce with shaved beet and carrot.  Decent portion, and enjoyable :)Green Salad- We asked to split this one, after the waitress informed us that it was huge. She was right, for $10 you get a very large salad. It was simple micro greens, with a tasty dressing.Salmon Avocado Roll: We got this as an appetizer along with an order of salmon sashimi. Seriously, the simplest roll but SO GOOD. The freshness of the salmon is unbelievable, the roll was plump and melt in your mouth. I want one right now just thinking about it.My boyfriend got the ""Duck, Duck, Duck"" which he generously let me sample each of the components. The duck sandwich was probably my favorite of them all. The sauces that came with it were really great and complimented the entree. The duck was perfectly cooked. I got the ""Chef's Combination Sushi"" it is 10 pieces of sushi and one roll. I told the waitress that I don't like eel and I lean more towards salmon and tuna. That was no problem at all. I had a selection of salmon, tuna, toro, fluke, etc. as well as an egg custard. I had never tried that before, and I loved it! The roll was spicy salmon (perfect!). I literally enjoyed every piece, nothing tasted off. I loved how they put a tiny amount of wasabi on each piece as well.By the way edamame is not on the menu, but they have it...we ordered it with our meals.When it came to dessert, they really did it up for my birthday. My boyfriend told them when he made the reservation. I ordered the flour less chocolate cake, and he got the bread pudding.

Croissant was buttery and wonderful but there was just too much meat in it. Prices were reasonable too. Why not 5 stars then? Service. Waitress completely ignored out table. No one came to take orders or pick up the check for at least 15 minutes.

We started out with the tuna toro. This was at best an interesting presentation that went wayyyyyy to far.  While it was kind of fun to eat that was the case before the flavors hit out tongues.  Fun because there was ice cold fish that you pick up with small shovels and add a variety of crunchy elements to was a fun adventure. Less fun was the actual flavors. Fish was very fresh but chopped up and The weird thing is that many of those crunchy elements tasted like tiny fish cereal.For the meal I ordered the ishi yaki buri bop which was by far the highlight of our meal and my boyfriend had an assortment of sushi. The sushi had so many seeds on the outside of the roll, it might as well had been an everything bagel.  I mean come on Iron Chef we would like to taste the fish in our sushi please, especially with how fresh we assumed it was.Back to the ishi yaki buri bop which on its own would be the only reason for us to go back. They cooked and prepared this yellowtail dish at the table which was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  A must have if you decide to go.Also the bathrooms are pretty cool but you have to go to understand.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The noise level is fairly low so I'd imagine every table can have their own engaging conversations.The food, however, was not phenomenal like some other heavy-hitter restaurants on the west side. It's probably not fair of me to expect Masaharu Morimoto himself to be preparing my dinner, but I didn't find the meal to be that special. The toro tartare and wagyu beef carpaccio are quite good, but they would end up being the highlight of your meal. The yosedofu is a great for the table, because they bring a pot to your table and prepare fresh tofu right in front of you as you wait for ten minutes.The braised black cod is a nice dinner option, and so is the duck, duck, duck. I personally enjoyed the surf & turf, which is wagyu with hamachi. The meats are prepared pretty well, and I do enjoy the complements to each dish as well.For the price range, though, there are some better options in the area, and certainly in New York. For example Buddakan just next door is quite a bit cheaper and offers some interesting fusion dishes. Nonetheless, Morimoto is definitely worth a visit if you live in New York and have yet to try it.

Subtle and delicate at times and creative and complex at others, the omakase will charm you, thrill you, and pamper you from delectable beginning (toro tartare) to sweet end (tofu cheesecake).3. The Oyster Foie Gras.Ok, I know I already listed the food as #2 but the Oyster Foie Gras is worth mentioning as its own reason. Oh Morimoto, you sir, are a genius. Steamed oyster + foie gras + uni = one amazingly perfect bite! yelp.com/biz_photos/t1w4…4. The eye candy. The omakase is a feast for the eyes as much as it is a feast for the tummy. The presentation of each course was gorgeous, like little works of art to match the sleek and modern interior of the restaurant. yelp.com/biz_photos/t1w4…5. The bathroom. O M G, the bathroom! Let the fancy schmancy Japanese toilet beckon you into a stall with its sensor lid.

Moist, tender & juicy.The tempura calamari salad was pretty good. The pieces of calamari were large & juicy. Although the outside was crunchy, it was a soft crunchy... I wasn't used to that type of tempura but the different texture was still pretty good. I have to figure out what's in their seasoning!Seafood 'toban yaki' was a little bit too overcooked for my taste but then again I think it's because the seafood was sitting in a steamed broth until the moment I ate it.My boyfriend ordered the duck. & let me tell you, the duck is AMAZING. the skin was crisp, not dry & the meat was tenderly cooked to perfection. A must get if you like meat :) Great twist on the typical Peking duck.As for dessert? I was in love w/ the tofu 'hot & cold'. There's just so many different textures & flavors for soy... The dessert was light, yet so rich in flavor. My boyfriend got the strawberry cheesecake.I was impressed w/ the presentation of all the dishes as well.I love the decor of this place.

Each course was prepared with freshest ingredient, very flavorful and very pleasing to the eyes. Our favorites are Fluke Carpaccio with Vinaigrette Dressing and Mushroom, Vegetable Medley with Anchovies White Soy Sauce and Oyster with Uni and Foei Gras. Our least favorite was the Sushi - It was pretty average, both the ingredient and the way of preparation were pretty ordinary. Just not something you would have expect from a world-renown Iron Chef I guess.

I got the sea bass and it was drowning in oil, so much so that I had to scrape it off my fish with a fork. Icky! The eggplant that my fish sat on was soggy and gross.

Miso soup was well done, not too salty as miso soup can easily be. Tempura stuff was tasty, and the accompanying sauce was interesting. Sashimi and roll were fresh and delicious. I liked that he and I received different pieces with our boxes.We also ordered two pieces of hamachi, and it was pretty damn good.We had a choice of chocolate cake or panna cotta for dessert, and we both opted for the cake. Molten chocolate cake with orange sorbet. I'm not used to having dessert with lunch, but I'm glad it came with my meal! I nearly licked the plate clean.Service was OK.

Ambiance is extremely loud but its fancy and pretty nice so i was excited hoping the food would match. We ordered a la carte as I know what we like and dont want to waste my appetite on other fillers.To me its unusual for each order of sashimi or sushi to be only 1 piece, so with the pricing of each order to be extremely pricey, i was hoping they were worth it, But they werent. For sushi we went with 4 x Oh Toro Sashimi ($18 each), 2 x Chu Toro Sashimi ($15 each), 4 x Salmon Sashimi ($5 each), 2 x Uni Sashimi ($12 each), 1 x Uni Sushi ($12), and a Spicy Salmon Maki ($8.25).Oh Toro for $18 each wasnt worth it at all. It was decent, not the best ive ever had, but just okay at best. I was hoping it would be similar to the best toro that i have had in asia, but it was far from it.Chu Toro for $15 each seemed like a waste too, if youre thinking about getting the Chu Toro, you might as well spend the extra $3 to get the Oh Toro. It seemed like it was just regular tuna, nothing special at all and way over priced.Salmon Sashimi was pretty good, pricey per piece, but worth it at a fancy restaurant like this. Uni for $12 each was different and the most expensive that ive ever had. they were small strips and they looked pretty neat. I was excited to try it, but then realized that i didnt like it at all. We eat Uni Sashimi about 3-4 times a week and after trying this we were definitely disappointed. It seemed like it would go well with rice so we made another order as a sushi. It was better with rice, but still disappointing overall.We ordered the Spicy Salmon Maki after we ate all the sashimi. I would have to say it was probably the best Spicy Salmon that ive ever had.After trying their Sushi/Sashimi and being disappointed overall, we decided to try other things on the menu. Went with the Market Oysters and were not disappointed. There were 6 of them and were prep'ed 3 different ways. Each one was a complete different flavor and they were all delicious.At this point the GF was getting full but i was still not satisfied. Looked thru the menu again and decided on the Surf and Turf ($39). It took forever to get and it looked very nice, however i was disappointed in how small the portion was. It was an interesting dish, tasted alright, but just very small like the size of an appetizer.Total was around $300 and it that was unsatisfying. i went and grabbed 2 slices of pizza afterwards and was finally happy. Its sad that a restaurant like this with such a great name can have such average and below average food. Oh, and service was pretty bad. Hostesses were great but everyone else, servers, food runners, and sushi chefs weren't polite, just seemed like they hated life, just didnt care, and wanted to go home.To sum it up, Over Rated, Over Priced, and Disappointing.

After this experience, hamachi is my favorite sashimi. I'll never forget the moment I put this in my mouth!Morimoto is so creative.  Everything looks as good as it tastes and vice versa.  The colors and plating is always perfect and you can see he really pays attention to every detail.

Yes, it may seem expensive for the tiny bit of food you get, but, o.m.g, the tartare was melting in my mouth and the condiments made it harmonious bliss. Another dish I must rave about is the sea bass - the fish was cooked to smooth perfection. The accompanying sushi and black sesame panna cotta dessert with the bento box also made for a very delicious meal.

1034,U5DI3aboZDQ8uVTNgIyfvg,Nala L.,5.0 star rating,"Amazing.  I put this restaurant in my top ten in the world.  I hope Houston gets one very soon! First things first, drinks on deck please! I ordered the Camelia which was a drink with saki and watermelon and was great.  The watermelon was light and refreshing, not overpowering.  My sister ordered the cherry blossom(seasonal drink) and it was delicious especially if you are a fan of whisky sours.  My mom ordered the hydrangea and it was quite refreshing.  Overall great drinks, but little alcohol in the drinks except maybe for the cherry blossom.We ordered the Crispy Rock Shrimp tempura, the Spicy King Crab, and the California Roll to start out our food experience and all of them were amazing.  I can't stop thinking about the Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura!  Wow.  This is not what you expect to get with tempura, it is a million times better.  The shrimp has a light tempura and is covered in a light delicious sauce.  There are two flavors, I believe it was spicy something and wasabi.  The presentation mimics buffalo wings with ranch to dip and celery sticks. Each flavor gives a different tone and leaves your tongue yearning for the next one.  The Spicy King crab was perfectly cooked and perfectly flavored, it wasn't too buttery or greasy and it fell off the shell with a quick twist of your chopsticks.  The California roll was also delicious but the other two are things you must order. We almost wanted to do just appetizers because the appetizers were so amazing, but we knew the entrees must be just as special.  I ordered the Ishi Yaki Buri Bop, which was a take on the traditional Korean bibimbop but with yellow tail and a Japanese sauce.  It is cooked in front of you at your table in a hot ceramic bowl.  It was just amazing.  Bibimbop is my favorite Korean dish and this was a new way to love it.  I wanted to lick the bowl.I was told that dessert was necessary, no convincing needed here.  I ordered the cheesecake souffle.  OMG.  I wanted to eat more.  It was amazing, it was a light and airy cheesecake with red wine sorbet and green tea crumbles.  The red wine sorbet perfectly complimented the richness of the cheesecake.  The green tea crumbles were delicious and added to the cheesecake as well.  Wow, everyone needs this dessert in their life.  I will be back next time I land in a city with a Morimoto.  I highly recommend you experience this delicacy.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Mind you, this may affect my review :)I have been to the one in Philly with my ex and we did the omakase there. The waiter there was exceptional and knew everything inside out. It was the first time I felt like he truly deserved every cent of the tip I gave him.At this place, my date and I sat at the bar. Which by the way should be the experience to go for if you want to see how they plate the dishes! :)I have about two cocktails here. The one with the blueberry and another one with orange and ginger. Both excellent choices except they are girly drinks.I got spoiled here. My date ordered tons of things in which I was shocked I was able to devour. Toro Tartare: OMG. It is different than the one in Philly in that it comes with an array of different things you can dip it into. There is wasabi (creamest and mildest version I've ever had), sour cream, mini crackers, chives etc. It came with a light soy base. I wish I can have this everyday :)2 pieces of the King Salmon sashimi and 2 baby octopus.. DELISH! Love their wasabi here btw.. so fresh!Whitefish Carpaccio: DIVINE!! I highly recommend this. It was so interesting. The dressing on it made each slice of fish melt down your throat. Words cannot describe the silky texture this has. I am so happy I got to try this :)Tuna Pizza: When It first came out, I was like eh.. looks so plain. How deceiving. It's awesome! I love the jalapenos twist and olives on it. It was drizzled with some white sauce which I couldn't decipher what it is but love the creamy texture!Tempura Calamari Salad: Eh. very fried and lacked in flavor. Aside from the argula greens.. it was not worth ordering a second time around.  Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura: On the house for me apparently. Hm. Interesting. It wasn't really anything to rave about but looked pretty. I didn't find it memorable unfortunately other than the fact that it was crispy. $98 sushi boat: This is amazing. Everything was fresh and they have raw scallops which most places do not do because it is hard to keep it fresh for more than a few minutes. They are also generous with their slices and I love how I hate mackerel raw.. but this one was pleasant!Dessert: Cream cheese cake with fresh fruit and sorbet: This is amazing. Sorry. Keep using amazing because I am profound for words when I try these things.BTW. I would have given this 4 stars but the service and the decor is impeccable.

1047,7nOhTshZFNnG09602qJwxg,Victor P.,5.0 star rating,"Long time viewer, first time taster of any food network star. I was lucky enough to stop by here to try the cuisine of iron chef Morimoto. The moment I set foot into this restaurant, I got an ambiance of fine dining. The decor was very modern and the lighting was dim with many illuminating pastel colored lights. A total transformation from it's outside appearance. I was immediately greeted and seated (for lunch) by the hostess and attended by our waiter. He let us know of their specialties, including the restaurant week specials and answered all of our questions regarding the menu. Top notch service.I ordered the braised black cod bento box for restaurant week and my cousin the wagyu beef bento box. The food came fairly quickly as it wasn't very crowded within the restaurant. The presentation was beautiful as the food came in a gorgeous bento box set. The food looks wonderful as you can see the attention to detail they had put in it. I felt bad I was going to jab my chopsticks into it, but my appetite helped me get over it. The bento box had 5 components: a salad, tempura veggies, miso soup, regular and maki sushi, and the main dish. The salad was alright. I'm not much of a salad person so my input may be inferior to most. It was lightly dressed if at all and had some crunchy scallion garnish on top. It gave a nice texture but I felt it lacked a little something. The tempura veggies were delicious. I ate half of it before I realized there was a cheese based sauce on the bottom of the bowl. The tempura was crunchy while the veggie itself was soft yet firm. The cheese sauce was light and did not overpower the tempura veggies. Greatness. The miso soup was good. The soup tasted as miso soup should be and didn't have me reaching for my water. The freshly made tofu was delicious as well. The sushi was excellent! So fresh! It had 3 spicy tuna maki rolls, 2 snapper nigiri sushi and a salmon sushi. The maki rolls were delicious. Spicy tuna, special sauce, some scallions, nori, rice, and sesame seeds. Very simple and it works wonderfully. They put the right amount of sauce in the roll to allow the flavor of the tuna to shine along with it. The nigiri sushi was amazing! I usually stay away from this and sashimi but man does Morimoto know what he's doing. The fish was extremely fresh. A little goes a long way in terms of soy sauce and wasabi. The salmon nigiri sushi in particular had me giggling like a school girl. There was wasabi placed between the salmon sashimi and rice. It was the perfect amount. Huge amount of tongue tingle with none of the nose burn. Ecstasy stimulating both taste and touch.Last but most definitely not the least, the braised black cod. Simply stunning. Slightly sweet and salty. The cod was succulent and moist. The flavor was outstanding. It was impossible for me to wolf it down. I took that fish apart piece by piece like it was the last piece of food left on earth. Heaven. I also tried some of my cousins wagyu beef. It was pretty chewy, and dare I say dry? The seasoning didn't wow me, didn't taste much different from any other beef from an asian restaurant. Good thing I got the cod! Sorry Morimoto. I also got a surprise desert! A panna cotta using green tea, honey, and coconut with fresh berries on top. What a way to end this meal! You can taste every component of the panna cotta and the berries give that much needed tang. Not too sweet. Just perfect. Great meal, great service, great times. Thanks chef Morimoto! Wish I coulda seen you in your element and not on a TV screen. PS. Check out the restroom.

They also managed to make the worst old fashioned I have literally ever tasted.  Our waiter at the table was super sweet though. 2. The decor is tacky, and this place kind of seems somewhere you come to be seen. The crowd was half tourists and half over-dressed poorly dressed girls getting ready to hit the meatpacking clubs.. Idk. 3. The tofu burrata was so strange. If you are a vegan craving cheese, maybe it's awesome. Otherwise, it's kind of bizarre to have toasted bread and fake cheese in a soy soup at a japanese restaurant.4. Get sake. 5. The fish is very fresh, have some sushi.6.

Yes, the restaurant is beautiful (check out the bathrooms!) and yes, it's cool when Chef Morimoto makes the rounds and indulges his sycophants with a photo and conversation. BUT unless you're trying to impress an out-of-towner and thus, the scene is more important than the food, I wouldn't bother. The flavor is hit-and-miss, so if you've got the money, get the omakase since you're bound to get some dishes you'll enjoy. I wouldn't have bothered adding yet another review to Yelp but my last dining experience certainly warranted one. I've ordered the sushi here a number of times and it's always decent, but on my last visit the fish was old and something tasted off with the ikura (salmon roe eggs). Even more disturbing was the wasted, unattractive suit who was yelling belligerently at our waitress and was accompanied by what were undoubtedly Russian PROSTITUTES. Grateful for me and my dining companions normal, decent behavior, our waitress thanked us at the end of the meal by SHAKING OUR HANDS. I guess I appreciate the sentiment but I'm sorry, that totally crossed a line. Anyways, I guess you can expect such bizarreness in the meatpacking district (which I therefore avoid as much as possible) but if you want real Japanese food, there are SO many other amazing places to hit up in Manhattan.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
1055,6m3NJCUHS9MTJKYhxeMNLQ,Hanna C.,4.0 star rating,"This place reeks of creativity without foregoing flavor.  I had the toro tartare and the crispy rock shrimp tempura and was not disappointed by either dish.  The toro tartare truly is a star dish.  It was presented in a thin clear window pane looking vessel standing in a bowl of crushed ice.  The bottom of the vessel held 6 different accompaniments to eat with the toro tartare that you were to scrape off with a mini snow shovel-looking utensil.  The quality was amazing and  the dish was visually appealing and appetite-quenching as well.  After I showed my bf the picture, he went back another day to try it himself.  I also wanted something a little heavier so I ordered the rock shrimp tempura.  It was served with celery and two creamy dipping sauces.  One was a gochujang (Korean spice red bean paste) cream sauce and the other was a wasabi cream sauce.  The gochujang sauce was great.  It had just enough heat to linger on the tongue.  I loved it to dip the celery as well.  The tempura shrimp were crispy and didn't taste greasy at all.  The two dishes together were such a satisfying snack.The only downfall to Morimoto was the sporadic service.  I sat downstairs at the bar (which was empty) and wasn't offered a menu until I was already halfway done with my beer.  I had told the bartender I was there to eat, but something must have gotten lost in translation when the other bartender came on.  There were a couple employees just speaking Portuguese behind the bar and it seemed as if I was nonexistent.  It wasn't until I spoke to the female bartender in Portuguese that she started actually attending to me.  She was great after that, but it sucks to wave someone down when you are the only client sitting there.  I would still eat there again because the food was delicious and the menu so intriguing.  I will just have to hope the service is more present the next time I drop in.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I went to Morimoto during Restaurant Week in NYC.  So, shouldn't the restaurant be trying to impress me during this time--that is, impress me enough so I'd want to return?  Well, Morimoto certainly failed the test here.  Me and 3 other guests ordered the featured Restaurant Week lunch Bento Box.  The presentation was excellent as I guessed it would be, but the serving size was only enough for a small child. I was displeased that I spent $24 and was still hungry.  You see, I work out about 2 hours a day and do a ton of walking, so it takes alot to fill me up.  I looked around at other tables of fellow diners who didn't order from the Restaurant Week menu and was appalled at what Morimoto was trying to pass off to me as ""lunch""--every other table had huge portions of Japanese cuisine--while me and my guests were served 1 piece of meat-- yep, the beef Bento Box featured just 1 piece of teriyaki about the size of a 50 cent piece and about as thin as a credit card. Sure, they threw in a minimal salad composed of a few blandly seasoned greens, and a couple of pieces of a California roll (which tasted like just about any other California roll I've tried), and a couple of pieces of tempura vegetables... but, again, not nearly enough food to serve to a reasonably-sized adult. THE ATMOSPHEREMorimoto's interior is lovely, and the decor is modern and simple. I like how they have divided their dining room up so that the dining experience seems more intimate.THE FINAL VERDICTI guess the jury's still out for me. I was really burned during this last visit, so maybe if friends convince me to go back, I'll give it another try. Not sure if it's worth my time yet or not.

There's the main floor where the tables and the sushi bar is, and a downstairs where the bar/lounge is. Since I made reservations a little too late for a Friday at 7PM, there was only availability for downstairs. It was a nice cozy area downstairs. Very pretty place. We sat at a high table and there weren't many people downstairs so we had our privacy. And we took plenty of pictures.For drinks, we both ordered the lychee drink and that was amazing! I love getting lychee drinks wherever I go because I love lychee!For appetizer, we ordered the Rock Shrimp Tempura that comes with a a wasabi sauce and a sauce that reminds me of sweet & sour. So the two types of shrimp comes on two separate plates along with a side of ranch sauce. Both flavors were awesome. Ranch dressing drowns out the flavors a little so there's no need for it.As my entree, I ordered the Duck Duck Duck that comes with duck breast and duck leg and a duck egg. There was a sandwich to it. It all became very filling and I was stuffed! The duck was savoring and a little fatty of course considering it is duck after all.My friend got the lobster. She said it was good as well.For dessert, we ordered the Warm Flourless Chocolate Cake that came with caramel popcorn, and sorbet. The cake was very rich in chocolate. That's not really my thing. But the sorbet was really good.In total, the bill came out to $160 with tax and tip, so about $80 a person. It is a pricey place, but definitely worth it since the food is amazing!And of course to end the night, we had to check out the bathroom in the lounge area like everyone said! The bathroom was very pretty with the layers of mirrors and flowers/leaves hanging in them. The toilet was the style of toilet they have in Japan where you can have water sprayed on your butt to clean it...lol. Never had the courage to experience that in Japan or here, but if you're brave enough, go for it! :)Also, Morimoto is right under the High Line Park so it was a nice night to take a walk and to let all the food digest because we were definitely full afterwards!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The menu seems endless and we wanted to try everything.  We decided on the Morimoto omakase, 8 course tasting menu designed to allow you to experience the essence of Morimoto's cuisine.  I started with the White Lily cocktail and love it.  The food took its time, and that was good since I was totally enjoying my $14 drink.First was tuna tartar, beautifully presented and very different from what we had from other places, this came in a rectangle wood tray (like color paint).  It was quite interesting to find out that this item was 1st featured on Iron Chef Show and now on his menu.Second was fluke sashimi with roasted hot oil. Hot oil totally gives the plate its highlight.Third is the sear salmon with micro green. Salmon was cook half raw, and it made it enjoyable.Ordered the 2nd White Lily cocktail, but this time; it tasted too sweet for the courses. We added sake.Fourth was AMAZING! The combinations of foie gras, raw oyster and of course (my fav) uni just melt in my mouth. I can have this everyday.. Perfect dish!! Did I say another round of that plz?Fifth was variety kind of sushi, the fish slices were bit thin so that could be improve, as we'll here because for the love of 'raw fish'. So I like some more than other but everything was very fresh.  We sat close to the sushi bar area, so I got to see the Sushi Chef created our dish, he was quite concentrated; and the 'folding' of sushi to create the shape was continuously the same amount of turns. Very interesting and good learning for me.Sixth & Seventh came in one, kobe beef and shiny lobster. For $60 extra, they would replace kobe from Japan instead of American Kobe beef. We had pix taken of the Japanese kobe beef when our waiter brought it out to show us about the marbles and it was hugh piece.  I wanted one to take home. lolEighth was the desert, peach sorbet pair with sweet bread.Overall, the service was excellent, and he got tip well, we also received a signed Moromoto menu.

No one really asked how my knee was but I guess that's beside the point. Omakase was a 7 dish meal. Everything was amazing. Party in my mouth!! Fish tasted fresh. Morimoto is truly a genius when it comes to flavors, presentation, and creativity. Call me a freak but I judge a restaurant by their restrooms as well and his restroom by far is the BEST looking restroom I've ever seen.

My boyfriend and I shared the following: -Rock Shrimp Tempura -Toro Tartare-Spicy Yellowtail maki roll-Braised Black Cod -Sea Bass-Monkey Bread-White Lily Cocktail The rock shrimp was delicious. It was served with two different sauces plus a homemade ranch sauce and cucumbers for dipping. It was a generous appetizer portion. The toro tartare had a beautiful presentation and I loved the idea that it was an interactive appetizer and you could create your own flavors depending on what sauce you dipped your tuna in. I thought the tuna was an extremely thin layer and was hoping for more tuna since it was a $30 appetizer. The sushi felt fresh and was good but wasn't different than any other good sushi spot. Both the sea bass and black cod melted in your mouth. They were both equally delicious but felt the sea bass was a bigger portion simply since the sea bass is a meatier fish. The sea bass came with an avocado tempura that was tasty.The black cod came with a few black beans that were sweet and delicious. If you like sweeter sauces, definitely go for the cod. The monkey bread was served with a banana brioche, homemade caramel sauce, and a banana chocolate chip ice cream. I don't even like monkey bread but it was tasty.The white lily cocktail is their signature cocktail and it tasted like lemonade- so light! I loved it. Everything at Morimoto was beautifully presented and the service was impeccable. I highly recommend trying it out but be warned that it is pricey.PS- The bathroom is one of the coolest bathrooms I've ever seen in NYC.

1074,lKrt4POulTFFtU9STIfgQQ,Jenny W.,4.0 star rating,"Excellent service and food, although for a price.All of my friends decided to get the 7 course omakase except me. It's nice because not the entire table has to order the tasting menu, and my friends were nice enough to let me taste a bit of each one.In general, I thought the tasting menu was a neat experience to try once, but at $125, I wouldn't go back and order it again. One of the courses was just slices of several different vegetables that you dipped into a warm sauce, and another was a single oyster. Rather than getting all 7 courses, if I were to go back, I'd just get the 2-3 the courses I liked. Which were:Surf and turf (amazing lobster)Sushi (really fresh)The toro tartare seemed overhyped to me - barely any toro for an extremely high price.I ordered my own choices from the menu which were:ishi yaki buri bop - This was a really fun dish. They cooked the fish on the hot stone bowl right in front of me, and the person cooked the fish just perfectly so that it was tender and melted in my mouth - somewhere between sashimi and fully cooked fish. I love bibimbap, so obviously loved the buri bop, although my one gripe was that I didn't really like the spices (can't handle spicy foods at all).Tofu Cheescake - My FAVORITE thing from the meal. Get this to share because it's a sizeable dessert with two parts. The tofu cheescake was delicious and light and not overpoweringly sweet the way many desserts often are. Plus I LOVED the azuki cream, which was again airy and sweet, and it paired perfectly with the slightly bitter green tea ice cream. You must try this! It will revolutionize the way you see tofu.All in all, a pricy meal if you go omakase, but can definitely be made more reasonable if you just order specific items off the menu (which I recommend as the way to go).

I remember talking about visiting the restaurant a few years back with a couple of friends, but our plans never worked out. SO! when the 2011 Restaurant Week list came out, I knew this was going to be my chance to get affordable (and good) Japanese food......ok, and mayyybe get a chance to meet the Iron Chef himself. The interior of the restaurant is really chic and modern - suitable for young professionals, students, as well as the elderly crowd. Since it was restaurant week, the place was (no doubt) bustling with people. Prior to our food, I ordered a non-alcoholic coconut drink topped with basil. Highly recommended for anyone who loves coconut!Even though we wanted to take advantage of the restaurant week prices, we couldn't help but look through the menu at other available options. As an extra side, we ordered the Tuna Tartare which was cleverly presented and super delicious! The sauces were laid out nicely on a rectangle wooden tray which included: fresh wasabi, sour cream, seaweed puree, chopped up green onions, avocado, and little rice cracker balls. We certainly attracted a lot of wandering eyes when this dish came out. The tuna itself was very fresh and light. I really liked the combo of rice cracker balls and seaweed puree with the tuna. The lunch prix fixe they offered came in an oversized bento box. We ordered the waygu and black cod bento box set. The set came with miso soup, fresh salad, fried tempura w/ some sort of creamy sauce, and sushi/sashimi. Unfortunately, the portions were a little tiny (I'll admit that I can eat more than the average girl, but believe me when I say the portions were definitely on the smaller side). I felt bad for the big hungry man across from us. Poor dude. The waygu beef was a little too salty, ordinary, and again...too small of a portion. The black cod on the other hand was great - with just the right touch of sweetness.The dessert served was a Green Tea Coconut Panna Cotta with berries on top. Taste was good, but nothing spectacular. The service was great considering our waitress had many tables to juggle due to restaurant week. Judging by the Tuna Tartare off the restaurant's original menu (not restaurant week menu), I would come back here again to try their other mouthwatering dishes!Overall: 3.8/5",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

For sushi, she recommended the chu-toro over the oh-toro, and we also got the scallop. In addition, I ordered a spicy tuna handroll. The sushi was really good.We then had the wagyu beef carpaccio, which was decent although non-conventional. For starters, the beef was half cooked on one side, and the slices were not so traditionally thin. However, the sauce was pretty good.For main, my friend ordered the sea bass, and we both agreed it was one of the best sea bass we have had in the city. I had the seafood toban yaki, a huge stew dish that comes with rice. The broth was good, but the seafood inside was a bit overcooked.

I've been wanting to go for at least RW but I could never make it since they only offered it for lunch. So, my bf and I went to Morimoto to celebrate our three year anniversary. The dinner was everything I've expected (except for the rain.........and Morimoto not being present during our visit). I did wish however that we were seated on the main floor but we had an intimate dinner with the view of the restaurant.  The first floor had a clean and sparkly atmosphere while the basement had more of a up beat/nightlight feeling. The bathroom was absolutely beautiful - very Zen like, I could stay there forever.Started off with a lychee martini - I forgot the name. I was a little upset that it was nothing special but a friend already had warned me so shame on me.

Don't get me wrong, it was good but I can't remember the sauces. I liked the presentation over the actual dish.Toro tartar - I wish I had this for myself. I never thought toro went well with crème fraiche!

Oops, I'm sorry?""  The other customer and I exchanged glances and laughed after the second time, but this really shouldn't happen at these prices; we all like the illusion that our food is pristine and untouched, particularly sushi, so seeing it bounce off the next table over is somewhat unsettling.   Bathrooms were cool - I did like the Japanese toilets, and the decor was very serene.   Our discussion when we were leaving was ""I hate to say meh, but meh.   If we had eaten near home the table would have been better placed, the service would have been way better and the food would have been the same.   And we would have saved probably $90.""   Sad to say, not really worth the hype.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

For $22 you'd expect at least a decent tasting sake, but this one was harsh and difficult to drink.4 Stars - Toro Tartare - I love interactive food.  It doesn't disappoint in terms of flavor palettes, the choice between the many sauces including wasabi, seaweed paste, rice cracker, dashi-soy, sour cream, etc..  lends way to a really fun and interesting starter.  It's much smaller in person than it looks in the pictures, but I'm not surprised since it IS toro and there's also caviar on it.  I could've eaten that all day.4 Stars - Foie Gras Oysters - Oh my my my.  This was my favorite dish by far.  The explosion of flavor isn't comparable.  My 3 favorite things in one bite, what more could I ask for?  The only negative was that there was too my teri sauce.. I would've preferred something less sweet.  Flipside, I loved the berry palette cleanser, which was sweet and refreshing.3 Stars - Chef's Selection Sushi - Nothing too special, just assorted nigiri of chef's selection fish.3 Stars - Chef's Selection Sashimi - Again, nothing too noteworthy except for the maguro, which in my opinion was the best I've ever had.  Normally maguro (tuna) is pretty tasteless but in this case, it was surprisingly very flavorful.4 Stars - Flourless Chocolate Cake - Very unique dessert.  It was a lava type choco cake accompanied by a pear sorbet and caramel popcorn, grapes, pomegranate, flowers, and other fruits.  It looked like an array of opposing flavors but once I tried it, it went very well together.5 Stars Service - Service was impeccable.  I would have preferred a more private table since we were seated within touching distance of the parties next to us, but otherwise, our server and the bussers were great.Probably won't be back since there were so many other great places to try in NYC, but I would say my overall experience was a good one.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I personally liked the hydangea and and white lily.the food: Australian wagyu rib eye was one of the best steaks i've had. very tender and wonderful flavor. definitely not cheap, but if you aren't hungry---definitely can share this one. this was the dish that urge me to come back the second time!I also had the sea bass here and it was also very delicious. the duck was also very good. if you get a chance--get the braised pork belly as an appetizer--it's very delicious!definitely recommend this place for any special occasion or just because!!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

However, the chimichurri sauce was too spicy for my wife and the grilled sourdough was left on a grill far too long. It felt like eating charcoal.(entree) Duck duck duck (-0.5)- Wife loved it so much she almost didn't want to share it; duck was perfect and perfectly cooked egg was delicious.. I had a bite of the croissant stuffed with duck and the croissant was soggy. It was either sitting out so long the duck steamed the croissant, or the duck was not allowed to rest long enough before plating..(entree) Ishi yaki buri bop - This was so good, yellowtail is cooked on outside and raw on inside, with savory vegetables on a bed of rice.

After spending my own $100+ on an a la carte selection I can now verify this place is worth the price and a must try for fans of new school Japanese food. My recommendations include scallop congee with pork belly, oyster with foie gras and the surf and turf. Extra points from me because they serve their own brand of morimoto beer made by rouge ales of Oregon. The soba beer was an interesting twist on Amber wheat ale and I might go back just to try the morimoto hazelnut ale. Love the look and feel of the room with open kitchen and comfy seating; service was excellent the first time and decent the second.

My dining partner from Tokyo was disappointed at how the quality of food has diminished significantly since last year. Service was brisk at best, rude at times.- Toro Tartare: Icy. + Fois Gras Chawan Mushi: Two things I love in one cup. Creamy, rich, yellow.- Pork Gyoza: Surprisingly large. Obviously added for diners who want to play it safe.+ Yosedofu: Fresh tofu is always amazing.- Ramen Soup: Broth was standard, noodles felt pre-packaged.+ Braised Black Cod: Great sweet fish, not overcooked at all.+ Baba au Rhume: Mont Blanc's hot older brother. A must for chestnut lovers.+ Tofu Hot and Cold: Not too rich or heavy with just enough sweetness.AMBIENCE- Table: I wish they would tell me when I'm going to sit next to a complete stranger at a communal table. Not only do I not play well with others, this isn't breakfast at  Le Pain Quotidienne where I'm perfectly happy to nibble my croissant and watch ""Mad Men"" in blissful ignorance of some producer sitting next to me on his Bluetooth headset for the entirety of my meal/episode.+ Bathroom: Best part of the entire restaurant, no exaggeration.

Our main waiter made an extremely rude comment when we tried to ask him something as he was walking past us. Those who described the dishes didn't bother to articulate and just muttered something indistinguishable under their breath and scurried off.The food was not worth the price tag. Our underwhelming toro tartare was $30. The presentation is indeed unique but after that, there's pretty much nothing else to the dish. We also got the spicy king crab ... Worst decision ever. For $36, we got crab with spicy mayo... Fresh? Maybe a step above cafeteria boxed sushi. Thus, we spent over $60 on disappointing appetizers with the smallest portions (this is coming from someone who rarely clears her plates and is in no means saying quantity trumps quality... The quality here is just subpar.) Finally, the saving grace was the black cod which was soft and dressed in a delicious teriyaki sauce which was slightly too salty but the highlight of our lunch. Lastly, we had an incoherent apple bread dessert with ice cream on the side and a fun mousse and green tea crumbs. Decor was trendy and chic as expected but the bathrooms are nothing to wow about.Considering this was a highly anticipated restaurant for us, we could not leave more disappointed. However, Morimoto's fame will guarantee this restaurant many diners, but there are countless Japanese restaurants in New York City that serve the same, if not better quality food and definitely provide better service and lower prices.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Indulge in Morimoto, then get chicken & rice for the next couple days. One of the best sashimi I've tasted. Highlight: Omakase (menu tasting for $120+ per person)Course No.1: Toro tartare. Not your typical fat slab of tuna or what you'd imagine ""fatty"" tuna to look like. But this thin sheet of toro is impressive. The creativity and unique combination of sauces are intriguing.Course No. 2: Sashimi. Raw fish is the bread and butter of this Japanese restaurant as it should be. But they probably have good bread and butter too.Course #3: Salad with Hot Anchovies Sauce. Nice idea. Fishy. Course #4: Uni + Kumamoto Oyster. Perfect.  Course #5: Sashimi. Back to the basics.Course #6: Wangyu beef + crab + lobster. I wish I had a bowl of rice to chomp this course down with. The spices and powerful taste on this course made the Omakase very memorable. Course #7: Dessert. Is this place a dessert specialist house? Good finish!* I wouldn't order the ramen. Sure its hand-made noodles.

Hard place to find with no address; look for sliding doors with red cloth over them and japanese lettering.  No sign I could see from the street.  Make sure you have an address and you will be fine.We were tourists walking around the city for the day so we were a bit underdressed in jeans.  No one made us feel bad and the service was excellent across the board.  Everyone working in the restaurant was friendly and professional. Server made some excellent recommendations.  She recommended the toro tartare (28$) which I am sad we did not get (according to reviews here on yelp) and she recommended the cod (23$).  We ordered the morimoto sashimi (28$) which was good but a little steep price wise.  It was 6 little square stacks of 5 thinly sliced sashimi pieces (5 different fish).  It was tasty with the different sauces.  The cod absolutely won me over.  Delicious sauce, great toppings (shaved ginger) and had some type of pickled vegetable and black beans on the side which went great with the fish.  Fish melted in your mouth.  I didn't ever think COD could do that!  We also had a 40$ sushi combination, the sushi was just good, the spicy tuna roll that came with it was really good though.We were a little hungry after splitting those dishes and wound up getting 2 desserts.  Apple turban (12$) was very good with fresh apple slices, chopped pineapple underneath, and delicious cinnamon ice cream.  We also had the flourless chocolate cake (12$) which was hit and miss.  The cake had apple slices in it and rhubarb ice cream.  I did not like the rhubarb ice cream at all.  Apple slices were stuck inside the the top of the cake pieces but was not a good mix together.  Cake itself was amazing but very only 4 small pieces of it.  If they could do a huge piece of this cake without all the other extra crap I would get it again and again and again.As for atmosphere it gets no better.  This place was extremely well designed.  You will be ooo and awwwing the entire time.  Make sure you check out the bathrooms, they are works of the art as is the glass wall in the middle of the restaurant.  This was better than the Guggenheim.  You will not be disappointed here.To make it a great date check out the elevated highline park (entrance is only a couple blocks away).  Park has great views of the city and was built on an abandoned subway track (above street level).  Truly a unique night for us.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I never mind shelling out a whole lot of money for a really good or fancy meal but for the amount I spent at Morimoto's wasn't really worth it.I took two friends here for a late night dinner and for appetizers we ordered the  Toro Tartare, Steamed Scallops, Foie Gras Chawan Mushi. The Toro Tartare was okay, I honestly wasn't sure exactly what was so special about it. Steamed Scallops were good and was cooked just right. The Foie Gras Chawan Mushi was.... interesting, I honestly wasn't sure what I thought about this dish. It was interesting, and tasted decent but there was something about the texture/feel in my mouth that I wasn't a fan of. As for our entrees we ordered the Spicy Salmon Roll, Salmon Skin Role, the Wagyu Beef Roll, and the Chirashi Bowl. All the rolls were okay, nothing special or out of the ordinary but for the most part the fish tasted pretty fresh. The Wagyu Beef Roll was a little bit plain in my opinion but was really tender and pretty good. The Chirashi Bowl came out and although it was beautiful and had a whole lot of chunks of fish, the fish didn't really taste all that fresh. I honestly couldn't finish the bowl (and this bowl was split between 3 people and we were still unable to finish it).

We dined there last night and while I was def. blown away by the food and the unique  bathroom door, the ambiance and the place itself was a little let down. In terns of decor nothing much to rave about. So if you are looking for a fancy place look elsewhere. To get over the bathroom mystery, the door slides and to lock it from inside, there is a switch on the wall. You flip the switch which locks and unlocks the door. The bathroom is all white, very zen like and that's abt it! There the mystery is over!Now for the food: The Toro Tartare was excellent. Not only did it taste fresh and delicious, the presentation was superb. The Japanese Lobster fritters were delicious but unlike fritters these were not crispy or crunchy. In fact they were almost like soft, doughy balls filled with lobster. Delicious nonetheless. The 2 sushi rolls  - Shrimp tempura roll and the soft shell crab roll we had were excellent. The fish were super fresh, had the right amount of rice and it was nothing short of delicious. The braised black cod was excellent. Loved the presentation! It does get a tad bit salty because of all that ginger soy-reduction, but the fish just melts away in your mouthThe crispy Kombu brined chicken was delicious. The skin was extremely crispy, the chicken juicy. It's a pretty big portion size and quite filling.For desert we tried the warm chocolate cake with orange-sake sherbet. They added a nice candle and a happy b'day engraved chocolate piece to the dish. That was a nice touch! In terms of the taste, the cake was ok and I didn't care too much for the sherbet.

I was so impressed by how fresh their menu was in itself to begin with, but their more-than attentive service made my experiences there even better....not to mention the ambiance. We had the miso glazed bone marrow and fresh oysters as appetizers. Both were unexpectedly unique...adding twists to well known appetizer items.Main course consisted of sushi/sashimi combos. The fish literally melts in your mouth. It's that fresh and high in quality.We were full from the food already, but our server surprised us with a well decorated yogurt mixed with berries for dessert. It had ""Happy Anniversary"" written in chocolate...and it literally made my gf cry. We were touched by their simple and genuine attention to detail.

We walked out too full for dessert, but quite pleased with the experience.  The only down side was the fish and rice dish that we ordered (it was just mediocre), but that might be more to what the dish was, than the way it was prepared... so we didn't let it take away from the evening.Great staff, very nice people there - held our reservation for a bit longer than normal to help us out of our traffic jam issues!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

It was featured on FOODNETWORK: THE BEST THING I EVER ATE. As Duff from Aces of Cakes said during the show, who in his right mind would take Fatty Toro and mince it all up??!!! Are you serious?! Chef Morimoto does! I mean DELICIOUS!!! The side garnishes really make this dish so fun and innovative! From the Raw Bar:-Spicy King Crab : Delicious; the spicy cream sauce was a perfect match with the sweetness of the king crab.-Kumamoto Oysters: LOVE this as well; it was presented laying delicately on top of a huge bowl of ice.  Served perfectly chilled. Definitely a different texture compared to the oysters we have here in NOLA.We really don't like all the sauces and creams that most sushi rolls are done these days.  Nothing fancy..nothing fried..not covered all in mayo cream sauce.  We just like simplicity...just to taste the fish itself.  So we decided to go with the Chef's combination of sashimis and sushi.-Chef's Combinaton: of sushi, sushi rolls, and sashimi.  there's a 30, 50, 75, and up options.  I believe we picked the $50 option.  It was excellent.  Fish was very fresh.  Wouldn't expect anything less here.For an entree:1.) Ishi Yaki Bop: OMG. This was awesome! The Ishi Bop was prepared right at the table.  The rice was served in a HOT stone bowl.  There were pieces of that burned crisp rice you get when you cook rice over a flame WHICH I ABSOLUTELY LOVED!!! I use to scrap all the crunchy burnt rice when my grandmother use to cook her rice over open fire.  This dish definitely brought a very fond childhood memory for me.I cannot remember what we had for dessert for the life of me.  But overall Morimoto is a MUST TRY!

Considering this is a very pricey place with a lot of recognition.  The best way to describe my reaction to this place is this smiley face  : | Obviously it can't be disgusting, its Morimoto.  But at the same time it wasn't good either.  The food is what I want to focus on because all the money in the world can create a beautiful restaurant and a fabulous staff.  The problem that I had with the food was that it was masked with flowers and cool plating and fancy things.  Close your eyes and eat their food next time and you'll realize that its just mediocre.  I love a beautiful dish, don't get me wrong, but only if its as equally as beautiful, chomped up in my mouth as well.  The most disappointing thing however, was something so basic, the rice.  Honestly, I've had better plain white rice at the local $6.95 General Tso take out restaurant.  It was dry, hard.... just terrible.  I am 100% positive that if Morimoto himself were to try this rice that I had he would shake his head.  Maybe it was a bad night? But the sushi rice was like that as well and honestly a bad night is a bad excuse for any Japanese restaurant, their rice should always be good.  I've skimmed through a lot of these reviews and yes, this place is stunning, yes you feel like a million bucks, yes the bathroom turns urinating into a whole new experience but focus people!

Booked through open table weeks in advance since we were visiting from California. A friend recommended this place because she had tried the one in Philly. But this one is the one... the Iron Chef Morimoto himself was there the night we booked.Atmosphere: Fantastic design, from the curtain ceilings to the light piece in the middle, to the slide door restrooms. Very modern and simple. Nice lighting for a romantic night or a close dinner with family/friends.Service: Friendly staff that was more than informative and knowledgeable. I believe it was the GM that came out to greet us and asked if we needed anything else on top. After each course, the table was touched up and ready for the next.Food: I tried the Omikase (chef's tasting) which was highly recommended from the Yelp reviews. This was a 7 course, starting off with toro tartare, then a sashmi carpaccio, followed by oyster with foie gras and uni, an anchovies fondue with veggies, then a nigri plate, main course was a lobster in curry with a sourcream lime sauce?, and wagyu beef on top of sweet potatoes. Desert with mango mousse with passion fruit puree. I normally skip deserts but this one got me wanting more. Each course was made with perfection and came with a drink or a japanese fruit to help clean the taste for the next.I am for sure coming back next time, maybe ordering individually to try the other selections.

For lunch, I am a fan of the eel/foie gras bop (especially on a wintery day). They also do a ramen that is pretty great. The chirashi is a great lunch as well.They do the regular sushi/sashimi offerings and always have seasonal options. Of course, there are popular rolls as well.The sushi is good, but I don't go out of my way for it.The space is pretty awesome and they have a bar downstairs that is often the perfect after work spot if you can get there on a non-busy night.Oh, their wine list is great. A number of Champagnes and sushi-friendly white wines.My big complaint? Those plastic chopsticks. Yes, they look cool, but only when they are new. Some are looking scuffed.

1158,EvMs5C_l-zBehjUGHJawkw,Noa B.,4.0 star rating,"The reason I found Morimoto was due to the constant mentions of the omakase. Since my boyfriend loves sushi and seafood, I figured I would take him here for his birthday. First off, the first thing we noticed was the beautiful decor. It was not too crowded when we went (7:30) but then again the restaurant is very large. My boyfriend ordered the Omakase ($135) and I ordered separate dishes. To start, we both got drinks. I can not remember the names but mine was supposed to be some spicy - tequila based drink and my boyfriend got a drink with the number 88 in it (I think it was with bourbon). His second drink was the morimoto martini which I hated but then again I don't like vodka. My boyfriend was not a huge fan of it either. To start, he got the Toro Tartare which, at the time, he said was the best thing he has ever eaten (though that changed throughout the meal). I had the green salad ($10) which was really large surprisingly and had a very delicious dressing (I also held off on the bonito flakes). Next he got sashimi of either fluke or flounder (pretty sure it was flounder) and then he claimed THAT was by far the best thing he ate. My next course was the home made tofu ($16) which they made vegan by serving it along side a mushroom sauce with crispy rice. I felt the sauce was good but could have been better. The texture of the fresh tofu was very appealing though so I enjoyed it regardless. This dish was also very large and could definitely be eaten as a main course. The next dish from the Omakase was a type of fondue that I am pretty sure is made from fish. Following the fondue was a scallion dish with black truffles  served over a fire with some kind of leaf/grass surrounding. The next courses were sushi dishes. From the Omakase was a selection of fish (5 of them) with yellow tail, salmon, tuna, and a couple of others. My dish was a vegetable sushi containing pickled sweet gourd. It really looked like fish but didn't taste like it. I really enjoyed it. At this point I was stuffed and done but my boyfriend had another dish. This one was a surf and turf containing wagyu beef and lobster. He really raved about the wagyu beef. After the food we got some kind of a sorbet-brandy palette cleanser. I think it was grapefruit and mint but I'm not sure. For the Omakase dessert, there were two dishes. The first was green tea ice cream which they served with a small chocolate block with ""happy birthday"" written on it. He said it was delicious. The last item to be served from the Omakase was a white chocolate mochi topped with a gold flake. Overall, from what I was told about the Omakase dishes, they were all amazing, especially the flounder sashimi and the wagyu beef. As for the non pre-fix menu items, it was good but I wouldn't say it was the best thing I had ever eaten.

Also, I am a big fan of Iron Chef so dining at the famous guy's place was a dream of mine.My table opted for the tasting menu. Lets start with a positive note- the mango custard dessert was tasty. The toro tartare was good because of the accompaniments it came with but I didn't think the quality of the fish itself was that great. The sushi was good, but again, I've had fresher fish. I was really looking forward to the oyster/foie gras/uni combo. But alas, I was heavily disappointed when a giant grilled oyster (not sure the type, but definitely NOT kumamoto) came out with a shriveled up piece of foie that could have been a rotten raisin. Furthermore, I'm almost certain this is the dish that gave me food poisoning. I didn't have anything else to eat or drink that night but I woke up at 2AM dashing for the toilet before I puked on the sheets. I threw up for the next 6 hours straight. I was immobilized and unable to keep food down for the next week.In addition to the horrible aftermath of my dinner, the meal itself took almost 3 hours. Not because we were taking our time, or because there were so many dishes. There was an issue with the kitchen that delayed our food. I appreciate that the manager came around to apologize since we hadnt even complained. But for such a famed restaurant, get your act together! This was obviously a very off night for Morimotos. I dont know what happened or if my dish was intentionally tampered with, but it was totally unacceptable.Morimotos was on the list of must try places this year in NY. I am a bit heartbroken since I had such high expectations but actually had the worst restaurant experience here. I wish I had the great experience that everyone seems to tell me about.

The rock shrimp tempura was quite tasty. The batter was light and delicate and the sauce on the wasabi aioli was delicious. The oyster foiegras was a very interesting combination. The oyster was a bit fishy for my taste though, but nonetheless delicious. The yosetofu was a very interesting concept, and the one thing I believe I enjoyed the most. Made tableside, the silken tofu was soft and gentle in flavor. Quite the delicacy. The sushi was quite a disappointment, however. The $45 sushi combination came with a tuna roll and 7-8 nigiri. The sushi rice on the roll seemed hard, old, and flavorless. The nigri was better, with one particular piece of fish tasting particularly more fishy than the rest (I don't remember which one it was). Personally, I prefer Washington D.C's Kaz Sushi Bistro.Drinks: Drinks were delicious. I ordered the Tokonatsu and White Lily. Both were extremely delicious. Overall: I would rate this a 3.8. I really wanted to say yes, but my palate said eh... I  had really high hopes for this place given all its reviews.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

OK i get it...we are coming in pretty late at night and the staff is tired. But that is no excuse for the poor service that we got. Right when we walked in, the hostess told us our table was still not ready...then just left it at that. we were left standing there for a good 5 minutes until one of my friends pointed out that there was a bar downstairs so we should go wait there. Then to make it worse when our table was finally ready..we went upstairs and looked around and saw that the whole restaurant was pretty much empty..why did we have to wait then??Throughout dinner our drinks were not refilled, when asked for details to our dish...waiters did not know. we got no attention whatsoever throughout dinner.------Food: (ehh..overrated)All my friends and i got different appetizers to try...Beef carpaccio--OMFG..so amazing. it was melt in my mouth amazing. The best dish of the night. it was lightly drizzled with sweet garlic and soy ginger..the flavors were just right and you get that yummy wagu beef taste.Lamb carpaccio: another story...it was bland and unmemorableToro Tartare: this is suppose to be their ""famous"" appetizer. It was average. I thought the mashed up tuna was silky and very fresh. the compliments that the tuna came with were all great pairs to bring out the flavor for the dish..however i just didnt think it lived up to the hypeShrimp Tempura: it was very good, it was light fried and the wasabi and spicy sauce were seasoned perfectly. --Entree i got the main course for sushi/sashimi --average. I wont be judgmental about this because the raw fish were all fresh and besides that you cant really get that fancy with sashimi.However, i did get the sea urchin..and it was terrible. This was my first time trying sea urchin so I just thought this was how its suppose to taste like..but went to a few other sushi places afterwards and it did not have that weird chemical taste. not up to its hype.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The menu, to my amusement, featured Peking Duck and other dishes ""in disguise""...I was angry they had that on the menu!  Ok I wasn't angry, but the entire time I would read something on the menu with a interesting name, and when the dish came I would have to hold my laughter back.  I ordered the Lobster, which may wow some Western Palettes because of the ""unique"" seasoning, but to any self respecting Chinese / Middle Eastern / Indian / Turkish person this seasoning is just cumin and should only be paired with gamey meat like lamb, NEVER seafood unless it's cooked over a charcoal grill but sparingly! It was basically a stir fried lobster with massive amount of cumin on it.  what the heck???  My nose and mouth felt violated.  I am a lobster lover, and have never turned down lobster... but it was so overwhelming  I could not finish it... HOWEVER, it was not all bad.  The boyfriend ordered the wagyu steak and it was VERY good. It was perfectly cooked, this was the only thing that made our trip into NYC worth it, and the only thing that will bring us back.Although the majority of the dishes on the menu are just average, and just slight modifications of foods you can get anywhere else with many Chinese influences, ""what you don't know can't hurt right?""  Unless you are talking about your wallet, since our dinner (2 entrees, 3 appetizers) for 2 cost about $350 before tax and tips",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Thus, it is expected to be and actually is pretty amazing.However, I have been to the Philadelphia location as well and although both restaurants have a captivating ambience, I liked the decor of the Philadelphia location a tad bit more. The menu for each location is different as well. However, I do not prefer one over the other and think they both offer a great selection. The seafood is fresh and well-prepared as expected. Now let's fast forward to my personal favorite, dessert. The chilled cheesecake soufflé was impeccable, especially the green tea powder, which to my surprise ended up being my favorite part. It was not only visually alluring but a very light and lovely dessert that I highly recommend. Why four stars instead of five? The location is kind of odd, not only is it in the middle of nowhere New York (I didn't even know that was possible until this restaurant), but even when you are right in front of it, you cannot tell that there is a restaurant behind the awkwardly placed red curtains. Secondly, the tables are too close for comfort. We were seated in between two couples, all the girls on one side and the guys were on the other. It could have easily been mistaken for speed dating, you could hear the entirety of each others conversations. All in all, despite these minor flaws.

Staff is top notch, personable, knowledgeable and attentive. I couldn't help but think the chefs behind the counter had to be cream of the crop - ""so where do you work?"" ""Oh, I'm a chef at Morimoto, you know, in the Meatpacking District?"". Yeah, me thinks they know what they're doing.On to the menu. Now this is where I was a bit thrown off, appetizers are pricier than the rolls ($20-$30 compared to $7-$12), even some of the (side?) salads were pricier, running about $10. My friend recommended I get the rock shrimp tempura appetizer. OMG, so glad she did (considering they were PHENOMENAL and I never would have implied I wanted a $20 app). For dinner I had the shrimp tempura roll (wow, yum, served warm!) and the yellowtail tuna roll (exquisite, not at all chewy or fishy, virtually melts in your mouth) with a small sake (served cold, on ice no less, and will set you back$22). For dessert my friend ordered the chocolate lava cake, I ordered the vicherin (grapefruit sorbet atop an avocado puree, adorned with orange meringue wafers), oh yeah, tastes like happy. Since they also knew it was my birthday, they also brought a sorbet trio served on a plate of ice, both sorbet dishes were served with birthday candles and little chocolate sticks plaqued with Happy birthday on them.From start to finish, it was quite the culinary experience, one that I was fortunate enough to do at least once and thoroughly enjoyed (though my opinion would probably be slightly different if I was the one paying the bill!)*Fun/weird tip - Ladies restrooms have bidets",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

She told me that she's heard great feedback from the regulars who bring their Japanese business partners, and I can see why! The chirashi the restaurant serves is unlike any I've seen. Presentation-wise, the array of fresh sashimi- from the yellow tail, the mackerel, the octopus, (etc.; 10-12 different fish and vegetables) that is sprinkled with salmon roe- is uniquely cut into bite sizes and layered in a mix on a bed of perfectly cooked sushi rice. The dish was fun to look at and to eat, and I was perfectly happy with the recommendation.To drink, I ordered their Tiger's Eye cocktail (rye, ginger liquor, plum sake, and bitters). It tasted great and I definitely recommend this if any of you like the mentioned ingredients. It was very hot outside that day and this also served as an awesome refresher.

1178,fez7rugVeg_PDDawGfByaw,Alexandra K.,4.0 star rating,"Morimoto was the third and final restaurant in the extended celebratory dinners for my boyfriend's birthday.  He had previously dined at Morimoto in Philadelphia and was eager to try the New York outpost.  The décor is inventive and whimsical, as with most Starr restaurants, but still maintains a sense of modern elegance.  We opted for a white wine to start and the omakase plus an order of rock shrimp tempura.   Food: There were ups and downs in the 7-course tasting menu.  Our least favorite dish was the oyster with uni and foie gras and a teriyaki glaze.  Perhaps it was the monotonous textures of the ingredients or the goopy, sweet glaze which did not complement the rich base components, but we were both turned off by it.  The toro tartare and the sushi course were both good but not amazing.  My boyfriend recalled he felt every piece of fish at the Philadelphia location was perfect, however, here the selection and texture left something to be desired.  The sashimi course, anchovy dip, and main course were all fantastic.  The anchovy dip was the surprise of the night.  It's rich, garlicky flavor and unique presentation were stellar.  The main course of wagyu and lobster was solidly done but although the lobster was cooked to perfection, I felt they could have been slightly more inventive with the seasoning.  We were accidentally served an order of the beef carpaccio which was excellent.  The rock shrimp tempura is a reliable order from many high-end Japanese restaurants and Morimoto's did not disappoint.  It is served with two sauces (a wasabi and a spicy mayo type) and a ranch dipping sauce.   We decided to forgo the ranch in favor of more of the other sauces which I would definitely recommend.  Dessert was a mango soup that was a refreshing and light way to end the meal.Overall we were pleased with our dinner, however, I think we would have been slightly disappointed (and my boyfriend hungry) if we had not added the carpaccio and rock shrimp tempura.  Service was attentive and informative with the food descriptions.  Also, the seating is pretty close together for such a large restaurant so be prepared to hear the conversations next to you loud and clear.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The fish is fresh here, so order rolls and sushi nigiri.  All the appetizers are fun, small portions.

Wow walking into Morimoto, I was astound by how beautiful the restaurant is. Everything was so simple but at the same time it also felt so grand. I came here for my best friend's birthday and we were set on getting the omakase because we wanted the FULL experience. If it is your first time coming here, DO THE OMAKASE! It let us tried almost everything we wanted to, from the tuna tartare, to the oyster with foie gras, to sushi, and the surf and turf. I think they change the surf and turk around occasionally by making the lobster differently. I was a little say that the omakase did not come with the shrimp tempura or the duck duck duck, but thats the reason i came back a second time :) So the second time i came to Morimoto, I didn't do the omakase because I felt ordering a la carte can let me try stuff I didn't get when i did the Omakase. So i ordered the crispy rock shrimp tempura. It was one of the most flavorful shrimp tempura I have ever eaten!!!!!! OMG it just melted in my mouth and boy was I happy. We also got the tuna pizza which was a nice twist to having just plain tuna sashimi. It had a nice crunch and the mayo added just the right amount of flavor without being overbearing. For entree, I got the duck duck duck, my sister got the surf and turf, and my mom got the seafood toban yaki. I LOVE THE DUCK DUCK DUCK!!!!! I mean, who doesn't like to eat duck right? welll this duck was DELICIOUS! The croissant it came with was super buttery and flakey, and the duck was tender without being gamey at all. I could not stop eating it cause it was SO good. My sister loved her surf and turf, and like i previously mentioned, it was different from when I had the omakase. Her lobstered was broiled this time which made it more flavorful. My mom really like the toban yaki, but to me it was a tad fishy.

From the first course to the seventh, it was truly a memorable experience. Between the excellent combos of flavors to the melt-in-your-mouth wagyu beef to the excellent service, this is one restaurant that I highly HIGHLY recommend!! It'll knock your socks off repeatedly until your so full and satisfied, that you won't even know what to do w/ yourself afterwards. Seriously...Only con I have (which was a big one) was that they have 2 small rooms at the very front of the restaurant that, if you sit in them, you're totally separated from the beauty of the restaurant's space. We were originally sat in the smaller of the 2 and I couldn't even bare it. I felt like I was stuck in a concrete box. If you can, do not sit there. Sitting in the main area is sooo much better! Other than that, GO! You'll definitely leave happy. :)***If you need suggestions, here's what I suggest:1) Toro Tartare - it looks like a shuffleboard w/ smashed tuna and all these different colorful accompaniments. it was ordered by many and loved by me :)2) rock shrimp tempura - i didn't have it but apparently almost everyone else in the restaurant did. to me that means it must be good3) wagyu beef - the waiter wasn't kidding when he said it was the best steak he ever had! sometimes i didn't know if i was eating steak or better. it was just that good!!3) omakase - expensive but if you have the money, you'll never feel the same way about food again!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I like to sit at sushi bars and enjoy the interactions with the experts- they should be in a position to share their knowledge, opinions on product and personalities- some warm some not. It's a huge part of the experience. No way here, there's no reason even having a bar to sit at. It's as though there is a steel curtain between the chefs and those sitting at the ""bar.""The sake selection is egotistical at best. There is only one label on the three sake types- all Marimoto. Really? Nothing like a little variety to spice up dinner. Quite literally a buzz kill. The saving grace was the fish. The o toro, uni and ikura were first class and greedily consumed.

It wasn't a ton of food, so we ordered some additional rolls, which were surprisingly affordable at ~$8 each. I would've probably been happier just ordering rolls in place of the bento.

And it was sincerely an gastronomical epiphany. Despite the slew of negative reviews, I sincerely loved each and every dish the chef put on our table. Because we love the Iron Chef, we decided to go with the Omakase Dinner. ""Why not go all out?"" we thought. If you're a foodie like us and have some money to spare, you should definitely get the Omakase. The beginning course was the highly rated Toro Tartare, and personally, I LOVED it. Sincerely, if you thought this was ""too"" fishy, then you probably don't know good seafood. The Toro Tartare was lush as it was delicious, and the extra crunch you get from rice cracker balls heightens the textures in your mouth. The next course is Kampachi Sashimi with Shiitake, and it was really yummy. The shiitake was meaty, the sauce was delicate, and the sashimi was heavenly. I may have to stop there because Chef Morimoto constantly updates the Omakase Dinner, and it may be a difference experience for you as it was for me. Personally, I was so happy I chose this dinner option because you get to taste the variety and skill that makes the Iron Chef. He's a very talented man.Also, this is probably the best place I've ever eaten sushi at. As a LA girl, I'm an ardent lover of sushi, and the fresh wasabi Morimoto used definitely brought the sushi to a whole new level. During dinner, he also gave us a shot of ginger ale, which helped cleaned our palates. It was yummy, and helped us enjoy each course with a fresh tongue!Btw, we also ordered Morimoto's freshly brewed beers, the hazel and dark ones. They were GOOD. I'm a lover of good, malty beer, and the dark one was definitely one of the best I've tasted.I hope my review was helpful!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

1208,SaDY0XID4zqLpa3ncexg5A,Eddie C.,5.0 star rating,"Awesome. Great food, good service, nice setting. I'd definitely come back. For those that ever watch Iron Chef and you drool thinking about eating that food, well, Morimoto's is the place to experience it. I ordered the 10-course omakase (3 more courses than the ""regular"" version). The waiter was very helpful describing each dish and answering questions. The slight nit I have on the service was that I would've wanted roughly 20-30% less time between courses. Overall our 10-course omakase was about 3 hours from the time we sat down. Others were out in about 2 hours.Here's how it broke down in chronology for the food with a 1-5 scoring, 5 being the highest. Note: all food was good at least, I'm grading on a curve. The worst dish, which was still delicious, gets a 1.(3) Toro tartar with a sampling of sauces: wasabi, seaweed, avocado, rice cracker, sour cream, chives, and soy. This is probably their most popular appetizer, and it certainly was tasty. The rice crackers were strong for the delicate flavor, so use sparingly. I also knock it down one rating because it was a bit challenging to eat between dipping the toro and the awkward triangular spoon.(5) Seared fluke with scallions, some sauce. I don't know what the sauce was, but it was delicious. Oily, creamy, slightly salty, but not overpowering for the seared fish. The light scallion was also a nice touch.(4) Sashimi. Very tasty; the octopus (tako) and abalone in particular were great. The tako was a part of the octopus that wasn't easily identifiable (not a tentacle). Toro was tasty of course.(1) Salad with anchovy dip. The dip was tasty, but the dipping options weren't very inspiring. They were cute, though. Baby radish, the smallest cucumber ever (looks like a tiny watermelon), bread, and a couple others... I would've been content with more basic veggies (spinach?) and using the dip as a dressing. Or just more of the cucumber and radish.(2) Oyster with foie gras and uni, covered in teriyaki sauce. Honestly, this dish would've been AMAZING if each ingredient were served separately and the dressing used sparingly. I asked, and they suggested I eat them all together. I got a rush of fois gras and teriyaki sauce, with an aftertaste of uni followed by a bit of oyster. Three flavor-rich ingredients that were dominated by one, and the sauce overpowered all of it. Great idea, weak execution.(2) Rabbit loin and sausage, in some sort of mashed vegetable. I thought I heard him say ramps? It didn't taste like it, though. More like a sweet potato, but that wasn't right either. I didn't care for the sweet and salty combo, and I'm not usually a huge sweet and savory fan anyway, but in this case I would've wanted to taste the smokiness of the rabbit sausage which was masked in the sweet mashed paste. Also, I felt the potentially delicious yet delicate rabbit loin was lost in the flavors of the sauce and sausage. I would recommend separating the flavors a bit.(3) Sushi. Good not great. I don't know how to differentiate good from great, honestly. I'll say that I really liked the mackerel with the horseradish. Toro (I never know if it's otoro, chutoro) excellent as always. Sushi rice wasn't overly moist or dry. Personally I favor 5-10% more moisture, but I don't know what's ""right"".(5) Grilled crab. So simple! Grilled yet succulent. No dried out crab, here! And the grilled flavor really carried through. They also covered it in a yuzu butter. The only disappointing part was that we got this baby lime to squeeze over the crab, but it was good for maybe 2 mL of juice. I guess that's good to prevent overenthusiastic lemon squeezers.(4) Surf and turf. This was wagyu beef over yam, and lobster in a garam masala with lemon creme fraiche. Wagyu beef is lost on me. I couldn't differentiate it from a medium rare kalbi. Yam was delicious; in fact, if they could pull off slightly more caramelization without overcooking - amazing. Lobster was succulent and tasty, and the extra flavoring was a nice touch.(5) Dessert 1: mango pudding with passion fruit dressing, green tea ice cream, cocoa biscotti, yogurt crumbs, and a few goji berries. AMAZING. This is the dessert in the regular omakase. It's delicious. Sweet but not overbearingly so. The passion fruit tartness helps balance the overall sweetness.(4 for souffle, 2 for doughnut+ice cream. Poached peach in ice cream gets a 4) Dessert 2: waaay too much. A cheesecake souffle topped with raspberry ice cream, a side of green tea crumbles and fruit (including a lychee you should absolutely eat first because it's sweetness is lost if you take a bite of any of the souffle), along with some fruit sauces on the side. They also (1) had a sugary covered doughnut filled with red bean paste that you were supposed to dip in a peach soft serve with poached peaches, that also had some fruit tapioca (boba). This second part was too sweet; I had to chase the doughnut with ice cream, if you can believe it. Poached peach - awesome.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

No omakase for us.  I did my usual chirashi and the rest of the table did rolls.  Sashimi for my dish was very fresh and it was very good but just not amazing enough to return for or to pay $32 for.  It also came with miso soup but this was given to me with no spoon.  I didnt pay much attention to it but by the time they realized my soup had grown cold.  They also got one of our orders mixed up and had an extra order of one roll (super salty salmon skin) ant forgot the other.  They corrected this at no charge but having it fixed was a pain.  Waiter had the orders/people mixed up and didnt understand the problem at first.All in all, we left unimpressed and i doubt we'll be back.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The entrance is cloaked by a veil of red curtains that you need to maneuver to get into the restaurant.  We checked in and were seated right away.  Since opentable announced that it was ""dressy"", both hubby and I were dressed to the nines.  However, we were a little put off by the folks in the sweats and t shirts sitting next to us.  We sat in a very ideal spot that had a great view of the kitchen as well as the layout of the dining room.  I have to tell you, the interior is absolutely breathtaking.  Cool, chic, serene, white and very zen.As soon as we sat down, we were instantly greeted by the attentive, though not intrusive waiters.  I absolutely loved ours.  They were extremely friendly -- one bore some sick ass tats that he showed us.  Very cool.Anyhoo...down to the food.  We decided to go with 1 cold and 1 hot app, and the rest in sushi.  We started with the wagyu beef carpaccio ...it was a step above religious experience.  Holy Shiznit...it was good!  I wish it had been served on a mobius strip of a plate.  It was ridiculous.  The second app were the lobster fritters..which were not only generous in size, but beautifully presented.  Our sushi order consisted of the usual suspects, tamago, spicy tuna, spicy yellowtail, eel avocado, and soft shell crab.  Delicious all around.  The standout of the platter was the spicy tuna.  It wasn't the typical tuna tartar that normally makes up a roll, but rather larger pieces of it enclosed in rice and seawood.  Gorgeous!For desserts, I ordered the chocolate mousse -- outstanding!  Hubby had the chocolate cake with corn ice cream and caramel popcorn.  Delightful!After dinner, we headed downstairs for some drinks.  The lounge is sexy and gorgeous.  They also serve the same sushi and appz as the main dining room, so go there if you're in a pinch!Now...the best part of our entire experience.....ready?  Drum roll please.The toilets...yes, the sick ass awe inspiring toilets.  I was startled by how beautiful the stalls were for one, but then my tush was greeted with warmth as I sat down.  As I looked over, it had ""options"" for cleaning different zones -- use your imagination.  It was so fabulous that I had to sneak in with my SLR and capture the pictures...it was that cool.A+ all the way!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The presentation was simply ahh-mazing. Every detail of each item placed on the dish was done with such delicacy and art. Taste wise - I was envious of my bf chomping down on the raw version of whatever I was eating but nonetheless, most everything was quite up to par (minus the surf and turf portion which I wasn't too impressed with). Decor wise: Chic. Modern. Serene. Note to my future hubby - please design my bathroom like the one in Morimoto. I didn't care much for the seating either...the tables were MUCH too close together and arranged in a way where I felt like I should just stand up and say, ""hey everyone, look at me!""

Our server must have overheard my bf saying something about my birthday (which wasn't for another couple months) because when I looked up, there was a candle and special birthday dessert placed in front of me.

The boyfriend got the Angry Chicken for his entree. The serving size was huge, even better, the white meant was moist and flavorful. I ordered the braised black cod. It was perfectly cooked and yummy flaky goodness. We also shared the soft shell crab roll, but don't expect it to be like the spider roll you get from normal restaurants. Down side, it fell apart very easily. We were so stuffed but being fatties, ordered dessert anyway.

The waiter paired our meals nicely with a a cocktail and beer (forget the names but one I think was a lily something and the beer was Morimoto's).For dinner I had the Chirashi, best I have ever had. It was full of big chunks of fish and for the first time in my life I was actually full from it. We also got a few of the basic rolls such as spicy tuna and salmon, both good. The experience itself was amazing as well, even the bathrooms and toilets in them.  I also met and took a picture with Chef Morimoto, who was extremely friendly and accommodating.

While the beautiful modern decor of this place cannot be denied, and the presentation of the food was quite nice, the food itself was hit or miss, and the service was noticeably amateurish at best.Hits: I started off with the tokonatsu (coconut, shiso, lime) non-alcoholic cocktail, which was tasty and refreshing. This was followed up with the beef carpaccio appetizer which was prepared quite well. The beef was cut nice and thin and had excellent flavor.Misses: Bento lunch, which included salad, miso soup, tempura, nigiri, spicy tuna roll, and black miso cod. Sounds like a lot of food, but the portion sizes were small for each of the aforementioned items. The nigiri were the smallest I've ever had, and the fish was very ""meh."" The black miso cod was full of bones, which made eating it rather annoying and hard to enjoy. Additionally we ordered the rock shrimp tempura, and this was by far the biggest miss of the day. First of all, the staff forgot about it, so it came at the end after the rest of our meal had already come out. But worse than that, it was slathered in mayo, over battered, and under fried, which gave it a VERY unappetizing texture and taste. Those that know me know that I can eat like a beast and will almost always finish everything that comes out. However, this rock shrimp tempura was so disappointing we left the majority of it uneaten, and of course nobody wanted to take it to go. It was something unworthy of Panda Express, let alone an establishment like Morimoto.The front desk receptionist was friendly and professional, but the rest of the staff left me unimpressed.

My first visit involved ordering the Omakase, which I recommend for a Morimoto virgin. It provides a variety of the restaurant's most popular dishes for sampling. My subsequent visits involved ordering a la carte. My girlfriend and I found this to be a great experience given that we were not in the mood for some of the Omakase items. The Toro Tartare is a must, as is the Seafood Toban Yaki, both of which are to die for. The service at Morimoto is impeccable, with an incredibly attentive and polite wait staff willing to make your experience memorable. Dishes were on time, and while we were stuck waiting on a dish for an extended period, we were apologized to by a staff member who went out of his way to make sure it did not negatively impact our dining experience.My girlfriend and I are definitely coming back again soon.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I came back a few months later for the omakase, which I would HIGHLY recommend if you can spare the $$$. The toro tartare is absolutely amazing and definitely one of my favorite dishes (like ever). I don't think you can go wrong with any dish, as I enjoyed all of them. However, I think the duck duck duck is a bit over hyped (but still deriricous!). The decor is very modern, bright, and chic, which reflects both their food and drinks.

I don't even really eat seafood but I knew it would be a delicious meal here so I manned up and took my boyfriend for lunch. We both had the bento boxes and ordered a bottle of wine - the cocktail list did look great though. Alan had the black cod and I the wagyu beef. The presentation was terrific, each part of the meal with the paired sauces all in perfect little containers in the bento box. The bento box came with miso soup, salad, tempura veggies, sushi and panna cotta for dessert. The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was the miso soup as it had tofu in it and what can I say - not for me. The tempura was crispy and creamy - amazingly tasty. The dressing on the salad was fresh and bright. I also ate my very first sushi... and sashimi. Impressed? Yes I was of myself for sure haha The sushi was good - I was expecting it to be entirely different - I definitely prefer the sushi to sashimi. I can't believeee I didn't tell you about the wagyu yet - I think I could eat it every day, all day. Cooked perfectly, it was melt in your mouth.

I think there is nothing that can beat it so I was curious to see whether Morimoto can beat Taisho on this one. Interestingly, there are two types of shrimp tempura in one dish: one with wasabi mayo and other with spicy mayo. I guess they are different from rock shrimp tempura in Taisho because in Taisho, it is just with original Japanese mayo. They were good, the sauce was interesting and delicious, the tempura batter was also light and crispy but somehow I like rock shrimp tempura in Taisho better. I am sorry Morimoto.It had been a long time since I had fried duck so I was totally estatic when this ""Duck duck duck"" plate came to my table. Why is it called ""Duck duck duck""? Well.. it is because there are 3 different duck dishes in this plate: foie gras croissant, roast duck and soft duck egg. Sounds so good huh? Thankfully, this one was so good! I love the roast duck. Crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside. Nom nom nom. The croissant was also good even though I could not taste any foei gras in it. Weird... I know..

For baby brother's graduation gift, decided to take him. A phenomenal experience and the restaurant lived up to our childhood dreams. We went with the omakase and the sake pairings. Out of our dishes, I would say my favorites include the toro tartare, oyster, sushi, and mango mousse. A multitude of garnishes accompanied the toro tartare and I loved mixing them all together to create this complex creation of flavor and texture. The oyster was topped with uni and seared foie gras, pure decadence in one bite. The oh-toro sushi was amazing. Fatty, fresh, flavorful, melted away seamlessly. The mango mousse was a refreshing finish. Topped with passion fruit and mysterious powders and garnishes (whatever, tasted delicious so I'm not going to question it), each bite was a different flavor profile. Favorite sake pairings were the plum sake that came with the oyster and Morimoto's special pumpkin sake that came with his take on the traditional surf and turf (lobster with wagyu beef and Japanese sweet potatoes, tasty but not my favorite). At first sip, the plum sake could be likened to a dessert wine, very sweet and almost syrupy. When paired with the overwhelmingly flavorful oyster, foie gras, uni combo, the sake and dish mellowed one another out. The pumpkin sake was smoky and rich, a powerful balance to the surf and turf dish. I really enjoyed the progression of the dishes. Started with the light toro tartare and the meal ended with the heavier lobster and wagyu beef. I think omakases are traditionally structured like so, from light to heavy.

The seared scallops were the most buttery I've ever had, and I've had MANY scallops in my life. As my first ever experience with wagyu steak, the surf & turf was perfect (my boyfriend doesn't even like steak, and he loved it). The non-alcoholic drinks ($7 each) were amazing. The dessert, a passion fruit cake, was almost too beautiful to eat -- but it tasted even better than it looked. I will say that morimoto's strength lies in its cooked meats more than its raw fish, from my experience - the chirashi sushi bowl was great, but given how spectacular the other dishes were, it was less memorable.

1257,Y8NX5_mdHq5wQkLuVnD00g,Christine V.,3.0 star rating,"In a nutshell: the appetizers here are pretty tasty, but the entrees are only ok. Best way to go is cocktails + a bunch of appetizers (but may be costly to go this route)Appetizers:Oyster foie gras (4.5 stars):  Very rich..combination of seared foie gras, uni, and oyster in a light, teriyaki sauce.  If you like the above, you will love this appetizer. Morimoto sashimi (3.5 stars): Fresh, but I prefer my sashimi piece by piece, instead of a ""sandwich"" of various fish stacked on eachother.  Comes with 5 different sauces to dip.  Very fusion tasting.Spider roll (3.5 stars): Typical soft-shell crab roll.  Can't go wrong with simple rolls.  Entrees:Surf & turf (3 stars): Even though we ordered the steak medium-rare, it tasted more like medium or even medium-well.  Not too juicy or tender.  Also comes with potatoes..very plain. The ""surf"" part was yellowtail sashimi i believe mixed in an avocado/guacamole like sauce.  Just an ok -dish... i wouldn't recommend it.  Codfish (4 stars):  Very buttery fish...well prepared (although I've had better) and it comes with a few asian black beans on the side (4 beans)...which tasted almost like a dessert...very sweet.  Unique features:The bathroom has the most high-tech toilet i have ever seen.  As soon as u open the door, the seat cover automatically lifts up.  There is also this panel on the side for all sorts of cleansing options.  The decor is also very neat with an infinity mirror right in the bathroom stall.  Definitely take a look, even if you don't need to use the bathroom",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

MMMMM... oh-toro!!   This is the first thing I think of when I hear morimoto restaurant mentioned and sometimes it's the first thing I think of when I wake up in the morning.

Do you love sushi?  Sashimi?  You do?  Well, then you should DEFINITELY try the most fantastilicious sashimi ever.  Oh-toro.  It's fatty tuna.  When you eat it, it's like eating a slice of heaven.  It's so soft and so fresh that it melts in your mouth and slides down your throat smoothly and delicately.  Not a sushi or sashimi fan?  Well, I'd say try this stuff anyway because it's so good... but if you're allergic to it DO NOT TRY IT.  Tasty, delicious sashimi is no reason to sacrifice your life.

Okay, well if you REALLY aren't into sushi or sashimi Morimoto does offer a wide variety of other delicious dishes.  And his Asian fusion creations are so innovative and creative that I doubt you'd be unable to find a dish that you'd love.  I would definitely recommend the Rock Shrimp Tempura which comes w/ a wasabi aioli and spicy type aioli.  (Side note: When the restaurant first opened they had a buffalo sauce aioli but then I wrote in the comment card that they should change it to the aioli in the Philly restaurant and THEY DID! O_O)

Basically, the food and drinks are great, the service is fantastic- all of the staff is so friendly and accomodating, they go the extra mile to make your experience wonderful.  The decor is wonderful!  It's sleek, modern and simple... and the bottle wall is gorgeous.  PLUS they have phenomenal bathrooms.  I mean like WOW.  You didn't think bathrooms could be that amazing?  Well, sit down on these magical toilets (which have heated seats) and you will see a remote on the side that will wash and dry your butt in a serene setting.

I love this restaurant through and through but my major gripe is that I feel it's overpriced, but I suppose you're not just paying for fantastic service and food, you're paying for the name of Mr. Masaharu Morimoto (who you will find behind the sushi bar or floating around amongst the tables- he's been there all three times I've gone).

If you'd like to try the restaurant but find it to be too stressful on your wallet, just go in and ask to sit at the bar and order a drink (try the White Lily as a cocktail!  It's delicious! [ I think it's $12]) and maybe even share an appetizer.

I definitely recommend going here to try the food.. and if you're not a crazy food lover like myself, definitely go to try the magical toilets. ;D",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

On the pricier side, but Morimoto is outstanding in its interior design (merging modern design with nature elements), service, and food. I was here last night with a couple of girlfriends to catch up over dinner. I waited for them downstairs at the bar, which looked like a slab of ice with imprints of leaves inside. Gorgeous. I had the morimotini while I waited, which was lovely and strong.Looking around as we were seated, I loved how smaller areas were sectioned off by semi-transparent glass panels so it felt private despite the fact that other tables were seated right around you. Great ambiance and the service was great. Water was never empty, and the waiters gave good recommendations on food.The three of us split a bunch of appetizers and a main dish:Tuna pizza - I was a little wary of this when I read the description, but I really liked it. The anchovy aioli was delicious.Wagyu beef carpaccio - Wish there had been more of this. Beef was of excellent quality, loved the flavor of the yuzu with sweet garlic. Sauce was great. YUM!Morimoto sashimi - Surprisingly, this was my least favorite dish. I found a couple of the sashimi pieces to be less flavorful than other sushi places I've been to. That being said, I bet the omakase features some great, fresh sashimi vs this regular menu item.Oyster foie gras - I think this could have been amazing if they had not been as heavy-handed with the teriyaki sauce. The sauce overwhelmed the delicate flavor of uni and oyster. A dab would have been sufficient (with some extra sauce on the side for those who absolutely need it).Ishi Yaki Buri Bop - It's like Korean bibimbop! But with yellowtail. It was fun to watch. The crispy rice with the slightly cooked yellowtail was great texture-wise. Flavors were spot on. Super filling - we couldn't finish this.All in all, a great meal.

When the server would bring a new course in Philadelphia, they would take their time to describe every element of the course, what we should be looking for with flavor and taste.

Very trendy and comfortable chairs. Each table is set far apart and divided by glass walls that made it look like cubicles. I guess it's a good thing if you want privacy.Some of my favorite dishes were the Toro tartare. You use a little metal scraper to get some of the tuna and you can pair with different toppings like wasabi, sour cream, and chives. Each topping gave a different savory experience to the tuna.Raw oyster with fois gras and uni in teriyaki reduction. Waiter recommended to finish in one bite, but I wanted to savor this dish. Ate each one individually and it was an explosion of flavor. Not overly salty and all the food just complements each other. The main entree was the surf and turf which included the grilled waygu beef and lobster with lemon creme fraiche. You can upgrade to Kobe beef but we were fine with the Wagyu beef.

Be sure to check out the bathrooms with the sliding doors and semi-hidden dryer. Sushi was fresh and delicious, but alas, the bento box only comes with 6 pieces. Miso soup was good- not too salty. The tempura veggies were the most unusual- they came in a creamy cheese flavored dip that tasted good, but was somewhat unnecessary. The grilled wagyu beef was thinly sliced, tender, and sauced just the right amount. The black cod with miso was soft, sweet, and had none of that unpleasant fishy flavor. The meal was finished with a delightful coconut and fruit panna cotta. Would I come back? Absolutely! Food came promptly and service was spot on.

Sweet, refreshing and palate cleansing at the same time.  Again, love at first sip! The 1st appetizer to arrive was the Toro Tartare with Caviar accompanied by Fresh Wasabi, Sour Cream, Chives, Avocado and Rice Cracker Bubbles.  This was an amazing starter!   The tuna was smooth and creamy and each of the condiments brought a certain element and matched so well in terms of flavor profile!  The creamd seawood was so~~ sweet and almost like a jam, the sour cream was fresh, the cispy crackers provided texture.  Appetizer #2 was the Hirame(Fluke) in Hot Oil.  Thinly sliced sheets of fluke atop each other with a hot yuzu infused oil poured over it.  It gives sashimi a whole different meaning to have it warm like this!  The fluke's flavor was much enhanced by the oil, and the warmth actually gives you a sense of hominess and is satusfying to the stomach!  I really loved this one, too! The salad course came in the form of Sockeye Salmon underneath a Baby Arugula and Thinly Sliced Apples and Dill Foam.  The saltiness of the salmon was balanced well with the crisp of the apple.  This whole dish was light and summery and definitely made me want more!  Next up was the Oyster Foie Gras.  I have never ever had oyster like this!  It was light and fluffy with just a hint of oystery essence, melting in your mouth with every small bite!  The reduction sauce it was sitting in was incredibly sweet and literally made me want to lick every single drop off the plate!!  The main entree was the Surf & Turf: Wagyu Beef and Chunky Sweet Potato Bites & Garam Masala Lobster with Creme Fraiche.  Seriously, this dish blew my mind!!!     The Omakase at Morimoto was completely worth it!!  A total food experience that could not and should not be passed up!  If I lived in NYC I would not even hesitate to come by for a lunch or save up for another Omakase dinner!!  Thanks a million, Morimoto, for this one of a kind experince!  The food, the interior design, and the service are impeccable and the best I've ever had!  Basically all through the meal I not only was able to appreciate the food, but I felt like I was being treated like a princess!  They don't call him the Iron Chef for nothing, that's for sure!!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I was a little skeptical at first but when it came out it looked and tasted amazing! It's a thin crust type of pizza with tuna sashimi layered on top and covered with tomatoes, olives, scallons and a mayo sauce.  Light and tasty...I could have eaten a few of those by myself :) I chose the beef  bento box as my main course. The bento box included a salad, miso soup, tempura vegetables, a few pieces of sushi and the marinated beef. Everything was good- the sushi was fresh and the beef was juicy and delicious. I liked the salad the least...the greens were a bit bitter for my taste.  OMG the dessert...berries panna cotta.  it came in a shot glass and had fresh raspberries and blueberries on top.

Our experience was top notch from start to finish.We sampled several dishes and they were as follows:Toro tartare - ""Wowee!"" as my friend Toki from Dethklok would say. This was fabulous. You are served finely chopped, really almost a purée of Toro on a serving board and spatulas to scrap and dip into the caviar, aioli and wasabi delights.Lamb carpaccio - so not what I was expecting. Tasty servings with yuzu and infused oil. Sooo good.Crispy rock shrimp tempura - this is an old Nobu fave of mine. However there were two flavors, one being wasabi. Well played Morimoto, well played.Kakuni Pork - served on a bed bed if congee, which I love. Pork was flavorful and very tender.Lobster fritters - yay to my Japanese soul brother for these little gems.Roasted ocean trout with turnip miso truffle and prosciutto - yum. Just a huge sound of yum eminating from me while dining on this.Yes, our meal was expensive but it was well worth it. We had a lovely 3 hour meal and the staff were accomdating and friendly.Tonight made me think of my first expererience at Matsuhisa back in 1990.

We did the Chef's tasting menu for $125 a person (not including drinks) but it was totally worth it. They also completely accommodate both gluten and shellfish allergies. I did miss out on wagyu beef because it came with lobster but the rest of my dishes were amazing. Check out below to see what we ate!The first item was a tuna tartar with wasabi, sour cream, seaweed paste, chives, avocado and rich cracker dipping sauces. You used a little scraper tool to scrap off some of the tuna, dip it in soy sauce and then dip it in one of the six tasting sauces. Very simple but very delicious and obviously an awesome presentation.Next was suzuki white fish with aioli, ginger, garlic, mushrooms and olive oil which was probably the tastiest thing on the menu other than my yellowtail fried rice. The sauce was so thick texture-wise, yet light taste-wise. I don't like mushrooms and still loved this dish.The first warm dish was Bana Cota (Anchovies, Garlic, Chives, Lemon and Olive Oil) with mortadella peppers, tomato, radish, pancetta and crostini for dipping. The presentation of this was amazing too and the bana cota just bubbled away inside the candle. It had been made in such perfect proportions that the anchovies weren't overwhelming at all.Due to my shellfish allergy the next plate was a simple smoked salmon ravioli with sweet yam broth. Everyone else got an oyster. This dish felt like a replacement and wasn't anything special.The sushi plate consisting of toro, barracuda, smelt, yellowtail and mackerel was some of the best fish I've ever had. The toro literally melted - I didn't even have to chew. DELICIOUS.My main dish was yellowtail fried rice which is what I had instead of the wagyu beef and lobster tail. At first I was bummed that I was missing out on the wagyu until I started eating this. It tasted similar to bibimbap but not spicy. They bring it to your table with the fish piled on top of the rice mixture and then mix it in front of you. Smelled amazing. Tasted even more amazing. Slipped straight into a food coma after this dish.The final plate was dessert which was a pot de creme with Okinawa dark sugar, passionfruit caramel and sweet soybeans encrusted in sugar. It was good but not necessarily my favorite. I'm not a big pot de creme fan but it was a good mixture of flavors. Not too rich.Overall an amazing experience and I would definitely go back although I probably wouldn't pay to do the chef's menu again.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Good thing one of my friends knew how to navigate the Meatpacking District, otherwise I probably would have gotten lost a few times on my way there (I have no sense of direction). When we got inside, I was awed by the decor - clean, chic, and modern, with a touch of whimsy: the beautiful glass ""wall"" in the middle made of what looked to be stacked bottles and alternating soft blue and green lights, the fabric on the ceiling folded to look like a ""tin roof,"" and of course, the bathroom - a sort of shadow box with falling leaves, and a mirror behind it to make it appear as though the leaves were stretching out into eternity. LOVED. IT.The food was no disappointment, either: crab cake croquettes that were crispy but not greasy, beef gyudon with sweet onions and a hint of ginger, and the panna cotta - creamy and light, but not too sweet. I also ordered a drink called the ""white lily"" - soju, yuzu juice, calpico, and lemon juice. Couldn't taste the alcohol at all, and it had a hint of grapefruit - even though no grapefruit was in the drink! And best of all, the price fixe menu was $24.07, which is a total steal.

Based on that, I had high expectations for Morimoto NYC, and it did not disappoint. Walking in, I immediately noticed that this one is bigger than the one in Philly, however, I was more impressed with the decor of the Philly one. As we entered, my fiance grabbed my arm and frantically yelled, ""its him!"". I had not idea what she was talking about, and just assumed she meant one of the friends we were meeting there (to which here reaction would have been quite odd), when low and behold, there stood Chef Morimoto himself! By the time I realized it was him, he was already walking away, and my fiance was to star-struck to say anything, but this is not the end of that story...We came here to celebrate a friends birthday, and had a rather large party. We were all seated downstairs, which was more of the bar/lounge area of the place. One thing that ticked me off a little was the chairs we got...we were seated an elevated ""bar"" like table, and the chairs had almost NO back support to them. This made things a little uncomfortable at first, but as the night went on we all got used to it.For dinner I ordered the ""Duck, Duck, Duck"", which is a medley of duck cooked three different ways. One version was actually a duck egg cooked easy over, another was a delicious and crispy roast duck, and finally, a sort of duck liver sandwich served on this butter soft croissant. Each version had its own accompanying sauce, but for the most part none was needed because everything was so good (especially the roast duck)!Once we told our friend Morimoto was actually there, she of course had to meet him. We told the waiter it was her birthday, and so he was able to convince the Iron Chef to come say hello and wish her a happy birthday (which was a bit awkward because he speaks almost no English but still really cool). We even got to take some pictures with him!

The entree was one strip of marinated sesamed beef about 6 inches, and mine was about 3 inches long. Though the entree was small, i nibbled on it to savour the taste. It was so yummy!! No rice came with my fish so I ate the sushi rice separately. The raw fish was extremely fresh, the freshest that I've ever had so far. It was so soft, it just melted in my mouth. Also, it was very shiny and brightly colored. We also got the infamous tuna tartare. It looked bigger in the pictures I've googled. But it was definitely worth the price and size. Because i took tiny tiny bites yet again to savour the tuna and the 6 dippings. I dipped my tuna in all 6 of the dippings. SUPER!!!Also got the beef curry bread. Its just 2 fried japanese bread things. For the price i thought it was not worth it, but my fiance LOVED it so I guess it was worth it. I'm not into fried foods.LOVED THE BATHROOM!

Ended up pretty pricey as we also ordered the cocktails. Total of $345 plus tips. Our waitress was nice as the BF does not like raw food and she was able to make adjustments for the meals. 1st up was the tuna tar tar laid out on a wooden board. There were 6 sauces for you to dip your tuna into. I just mix the sauces together. Presentation was nice as the tuna was sitting on top of a bowl filled with ice. Substitution was the fried calamari. 2nd up was a special type of fish, forgot what it was called but it was delicious topped with some soy sauce. 3rd up was the Fondue, wasn't that awesome. Sauce was on top of a candle to make sure that it was hot enough for us to dip into. It was too salty.4th up was the oyster. It was delicious. It tasted like heaven to me. Fat enough that it melts inside your mouth. That is when you know it's fresh. 5th up was the sushi. ok.6th up was the lobster tail and a slice of steak with curry sauce on top. Tasted kind of weird.

We started with some sushi and got the spicy tuna and California roll. That was probably the best sushi I've had and it was a perfect start. We moved on to some hot dishes and got the always reliable tempura rock shrimp and the delectable spicy king crab. The shrimp had both wasabi and spicy kochujan sauce. It was a little heavy and light on the shrimp. I prefer the preparation of this one at Nobu. The crab on the other hand, is stellar. It is a must have of two huge king crab legs with a spicy little sauce and tons of meat. It's easily my favorite thing here. We split the Sea Bass entree which was great.

It wouldn't be a visit to Morimoto without sampling some more sushi so we also split a spicy salmon roll with the meal.I do not know what the hype about Wagyu beef is, but it is supposedly so high bred and expensive that they could only afford a .33 oz slice per bento. It was definitely better than regular hibachi meat, but I felt the Kobe steak was more flavorful and filling. The blackened cod was really the one that stole the show. Soft and tender, the cod was saturated in teriyaki sauce, but it didn't over power the flavor of the fish. The sashimi was beyond fresh, and each piece was masterfully cut and served with the perfect portion of white rice underneath. Likewise, the tuna roll pieces and the spicy salmon roll was exceptional, with the sushi focusing on the subtle flavors of the fish itself, rather than smothering it in spicy mayo or filler. Miso soup and greens were almost standard fare, with the only difference being the gigantically generous chunk of tofu in the miso.

The sushi and cut rolls were meh. In fact, I've had better a number of other places. I realize that there's only so much you can do with an eel avocado or spicy tuna roll but I expect more when I'm here. Service is fantastic. A good experience, but won't return.

My camera (and palette) were so overwhelmed - i a FABulous way - that it could barely contain itself. Plate after plate - tartar.. oysters.. sashimi.. palette cleaner.. grilled lobster.. prepared perfectly and just.. off the hook. We even got some face time with Iron Chef himself. The ambience was cool and sleek - with an interesting bar in the lower level. The service was very attentive but not overbearing. We were constantly entertained by the chefs as they worked; having been fortunate to have been seated at the sushi bar. They were all flawlessly skilled and visibly passionate.After the omakase, we actually continued our splurge and ordered a bunch of rolls suggested by the sushi chefs behind the bar. At the end of it all, our wallets were definitely emptier.. but it was definitely worth it; and definitely not a disappointment - Just a lot of fun.

Right next to the High Line, you can take a stroll before/after dinner,  get a nice view of the water, and a not so nice view of New Jersey. The restaurant itself isn't designed like a run of the mill Japanese restaurant. From its red drapery outside the door to the water bottle wall, this place has character.Before dinner, you know for a fact that you want to take a trip to the bar downstairs. The prices are pretty standard for a restaurant bar, unless you want to try all the crazy Japanese beers that they also carry. I forgot which one I ordered, but it ended up being a whopping $28.As far as dinner goes, I've tried the omakase. At $125 a person, it's really not a bad idea, but if you're a frequent diner, then go order ala-carte. As far as what you absolutely HAVE to get, the toro tartare is at the top of the list. At $31, it is one of the pricier appetizers, but damn it's worth it. With sides of caviar, sour cream, wasabi, and dash, this dish is legit. The other dishes that are awesome are:- Whitefish Carpaccio ($16)- Oyster Foie Gras ($21)- Kakuni ($16)- Ramen Soup ($15)- Duck Duck Duck ($32)Like I said, you can't go wrong with Morimoto.

The lobster fritters were 5 (how do they arrive at these numbers since people usually come in as 2, 3, or 4 people - so you can't evenly distribute) balls of a waffle mix with ginger and lobster.  Truly good.  Then we had the angry chicken - which was delicious but very Indian in flavoring - not Japanese at all.  It's basically chicken and jalapenos in a curry sauce.  The other main dishes we had were the Morimoto Ramen - which had a fantastic delicate chicken broth.  The noodles were good, but so thin you HAD to use a fork and not chopsticks to get them out of the bowl.  Trust me, we're experts with chopsticks.  And finally the roasted whole lobster in masala seasoning with a lemon fraiche dip.  It was good, but unfortunately the lobster was a tad undercooked.  The kind of rookie mistake you expect in Hell's Kitchen, not Morimoto's kitchen.  Not at these extravagant prices.  Still, it was an experience, and even my son loved the soup in the Ramen.  Which is saying a lot - as he'd rather eat Goldfish crackers than a Peter Luger's steak.If you are a fan of Morimoto's you know you have to go at least once.  The menu could be a little more expansive for non sushi eaters.  I think the place does cater to sushi eaters, while most of his cooking on the Iron Chef show was more fusion cooked Japanese dishes.  I would like to experience more of that.  But all in all, I had a very memorable, fun time.  If you are going to take a Japanese girl out for a first date and want to get laid, this is probably a sure thing. ;-p",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

My date didn't really drink sake, even though this tasted very mild like a +4, so I did what any fine gentleman would do - drink the entire bottle myself. We started with the waygu beef carpaccio to share then a couple of rolls for the main course and nothing was off from any of the dishes. It's difficult to mess up sushi so in that regard it's hard to say this was the best sushi I've ever had, but it's definitely very good. We ordered a main course as well, the angry chicken and it was very good. The spiced chicken jus was amazing. I think that's what separates Morimoto from other Japanese restaurants, it's main courses. I kinda wish I had ordered more of that instead of rolls... I guess I'll have to come back here very soon!

We still had to wait til 10:30 to be seated, but whatever the cocktails downstairs made up for it.  We ordered the hydrainga, white lily, and camellia. Worth $14 each, not sure but I see myself coming in just to head to the bar. They were yummy.After being seated things went bad. We were ""greeted"" by our waiter who didn't bother introducing himself, so I can't even tell you his name, or even looking at us when he rudely asked us what kind of water we wanted and walked off with his nose in the air. But whatever, he came back and again we dealt with his ""I don't care"" pretentious attitude but we gave our orders.  At this point I need to point out that the three of us each ordered a cocktail, ordered 3 appetizers, and 3 entrees. In no way were we being cheap or looked like a mess.  So when he didn't even read us the specials, spent all his time smoozing his other two tables, and left our water glasses without water for over 20 minutes while walking by us a few times and not even bothering to bat an eyelash at us, we had an issue. I apologize to the poor waiter who we randomly flagged down to ask to speak to your manager.I simply just wanted a new waiter, but the manager Patrick went far above that and sincerely apologized and vowed to make sure the rest of the night went well.We had ordered the tuna tartare, Morimoto sashimi, and spicy king crab as appetizers. The tartare is a lot tinier in person but the six different dips were perfect. I highly recommend it to everyone. Also ordered some uni and it was delicious.As an entree I ordered the duck duck duck. I loved the sauces that came with the duck, the duck was cooked perfectly, and the croissant was pleasantly surprising. They also don't skimp on how much food they give you on your entree plates. The desserts were perfect with some green tea. Ordred the apple bread pudding and the hold and cold tofu.  The bread pudding was good but the tofu cheesecake stole the show. I absolutely loved it.Thank you for a great night to everyone who we came across Friday night, except to our first waiter of course. But all of you made this a meal to remember and I'm ready to come back soon!This was also an early birthday meal and the other ones I'll have for the rest of the week will definitely not compare.

1362,yTLsdwqWg6wTdrvlagdHaQ,Mai E.,3.0 star rating,"Sushi is my favorite food, i could everyday! So, I was definitely excited about trying out Morimoto. Considering he is a Iron Chef, I was sure that the food would be excellent. 1. Reservations were easy to make ( about 10 days in advance). We arrived about 15 minutes early  and when we checked  the hostess kindly invited us to enjoy the bar informing us that someone would come get us when the table was ready ""closer to our reservation time"". The bar staff was friendly and provided us with a lounge menu.. which is a shorter version of the full menu. 10 minutes after 9pm ( our reservation time) we went back upstairs since no one had come  to get us yet. We waited until about 9:15-9:20ish and then we were sat. 2. The seating was intimate. There were a few small tables along the edges, and then big long tables, where parties were separated by an empty seat between them.3. Our server approached us, never told us his name or anything. He just asked what kind of water we wanted, and gave us the wine menu. We ordered Miso Soup and the Udon noodle trio as appetizers. Both dishes were excellent. The miso soup was filled with a ton of tender tofu. Its the definitely the best i;ve ever had. They bring you a huge full size bowl, fit to share with a few people or have  a lot left over! The Udon noodle combo came with a plate of condiments and sesame sauce(?). It's served cold . ( the server told us this when ordering)4.The menu has different Japanese  meals, but we ordered 4 maki sushi rolls.(names might not be exact) Shrimp Tempura Roll, BBQ eel roll, Soft Shell Crab roll, and California roll. I requested that they add fish roe to the California roll, and the server was happy to make that happen. 5. We waited a little over a half hour for the sushi to arrive.  They were all coated with sesame seeds, which i didn't really like. We sat there with empty water glasses.  Our server didn't check on us one time through the dinner. I wanted a pepsi, but couldn't get his attention even as he walked by constantly. Bus boys were clearing plates from all the tables as dinner was going on. They were efficient and polite. After we finished our meal, ( about 7 minutes later) our server finally checked on us.. he didn't ask how the meal was, simply just asked if we wanted dessert. After we declined, he brought us the check, and then finally filled our water glasses. He lingered around the table, waiting for me to pay the check. The second closed the book, he picked up the check and said thank you. He was so quick to take the money, and could hang around the table waiting for me to pay, but he could ask even once if we needed anything or how the meal was. 6. In conclusion, The sushi tasted really fresh, the staff with exception of my waiter , seemed nice . The service really lacked. I was offended by how he carried himself.  The decor is beautiful, and the ambiance is relaxing. I would definitely suggest trying out Morimoto, because the food excellent. Just try not to get the server we got. I would give it 3 1/2 stars if possible.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

For the first course we had toro tartare. It was pretty fresh with many different side flavors. The wasabi was not too strong. The next dish was fluke carpaccio. It was fresh and flavorful but a little bit too oily. Next was a vegetable medley with anchovies white soy sauce. It was a warm sauce which actually was pretty tasty. Next we had oyster uni foie gras. I thought the oyster was a bit fishy. The sauce was good and the foie gras was fantastic however you couldn't really taste the uni though. The sushi dish was very fresh. The rice breaks apart in your mouth but keeps its shape with the fish. I liked the tuna and the red snapper. The other ones were okay. Then came intermission. It was a homemade ginger ale. It was alright.  Now onto the main course which was surf and turf. It was cooked very nicely very tender and juicy. I loved the sauce and the bean sprouts sucked up all the juice. Yummy! For the dessert, we had Okinawa sugar purée with sweet potato. I thought it had too much alcohol in the reduction but otherwise pretty good. After the several times that I've been here, I believe that Morimoto is overpriced for their food.

They used  spotted glass panels do divide up the dining room.  This gave a sense of intimacy while allowing the light and the vibe of the restaurant to flow through.  This kind of attention to detail is the differentiator here.  On top of all this, I saw Morimoto himself walk out of the kitchen to wash some vegis.  It may have been for show, but it is comforting to know that he is actually involved in the creation of the food in some way rather than just slapping his name on the door (as with many of the celebrity chef places you go to).  Four stars for a really great experience.  I would need to see the innovation across more of the menu to justify the astronomical prices to give it the 5 star treatment.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Food is divine, fish is incredibly fresh and in the grand scheme of things it is a great value for your money. Some of my favorite dishes here include:1) toro tartate - comes on a board with fixings on the side including wasabi, caviar, sour cream, crunchies etc. It is melt in your mouth amazing and I crave it often. 2) tuna pizza - my absolute favorite! it is thinly sliced tuna on top of a toasted tortilla topped with spicy mayo and jalapenos. Such a simple dish but it hits the spot every time. 3) Rock shrimp tempora - comes in two dishes with about 15-20 shrimp each (decent size) and it has two flavors: buffalo and wasabi. I prefer the buffalo... its a matter of taste really but the shrimp is fresh and perfectly crisped in the tempora batter.... yum! 4) Sushi - again... fish is amazingly fresh. They serve classic, no frills rolls but they taste way better than your regular tuna roll. My favorite is the king crab and avocado roll. Their roll prices are incredibly low most range in the $7-12 per roll. I think that for the quality of fish this is an incredible steal.  Overall... this is one of my favorite go to places for a night out.

It made it worse knowing my bf was being bent over on the price totally ridiculous! 270 for two appetizers, a small plate of sashimi, a roll and medium grade saki. besides, I know my sushi. I really do. I grew up on it. the server suggested we start with a lox pizza with kalamatas.... what really? then duck fois gras. that was good had creativity and spirit. I then ordered a small sashimi platter to start, planning on having much more  - the medium fatty tuna was good but it was all downhill from there. I told the waiter I do not eat octopus and do not care for salmon. Both were on the platter with 3 other options. a 55$ platter with 2/5's inedible? I hushed about the salmon and ate the oily farmed fish, but the octopus, I will not eat (like it, just on my ""don't consume"" list). I mentioned this (again) to the waiter and they brought something from the ""tasting menu"" we were delighted! Until it arrived soaked in a heavy, low quality oil.even my amiable bf was conscious of the fish swimming in a vat of oil.  Over all, it was just a terribly uninspired menu and service and for the price, totally ludicrous. Yellowtail seemed too chewy and still partially frozen, whitefish tasteless. He did not eat either and I did just to be polite.

You definitely pay for the experience here, but it is, for the most part, worth it.The Morimoto Omakase is a must for at least for one person at your table. It isn't cheap at $125, but it gives an amazing cross section of Morimoto's menu. I'd like to point out that the Wagyu/Lobster dish that came along with this puts the $55 Wagyu dish at Gyu-Kaku to shame. Gyu-Kaku can learn a thing or two about how not to destroy such high-end meat with salt and pepper. Girlfriend raved about the Toro Tartare. She rarely raves about anything Japanese or me here in the states.My date and I also ordered the Seared Scallops, Yosedofu, Ramen Soup, and Line Caught Halibut. Seared Scallops were perfectly cooked -- not stiff and rubbery, but the Bok Choy had some sand in it. That was a bit disappointing, but it's a good thing to chew slow on veggies that may have sand or grit. You don't want a dent in your teeth and wallet at the end of the night. I told the waitress and she offered me replacement Bok Choy and I said no thanks. I asked her if I can get the whole dish again and she said no and then we laughed like Fake White People. If you don't know what fake white people laugh like, I recommend you watch the Samuel Jackson Beer sketch by Dave Chappelle.Yosedofu was just a soy liquid mixture which they add something to and over time, it solidifies in a pot. Cool presentation I guess. It tasted pretty much like tofu. Good tofu that was silky and served warm.Ramen soup was about $15 bucks and I'll tell you, I'd rather pay that much for ramen at Ippudo for much more. It tasted ok though it was on the saltier side. The ramen soup or ""iron chef"" chicken noodle soup came in a big bowl which they split between me and my ball and chain. They fit everything from the big bowl in precisely 2 rice/soup sized bowls. I had to ask them if that was it...yup. True story bro. The chicken and noodles were not exactly overflowing in each bowl to say the least.  -_____-Loved my Line caught halibut dish with black bean sauce.

I didn't have much time to deliberate the multitude of Japanese places that offered Omakase in NY, but when an old episode of Iron Chef came on, I realized the choice was easy, Morimoto was the right choice.When I called to make reservations, they were quite friendly and professional. However when it came to the discussion of Omakase I had to laugh: they offered the $125 8 course omakase and the more ""specialized"" 10 course for $250. Good LORD! Thats a lot of doughAfter a month of waiting we finally arrived here to celebrate my mom's b-day. I booked for an 8:30pm spot and was surprised to find this place PACKED with people. Then again its New York, there are people everywhere. Our waiter was nice enough to sit us to the more quiet place by the kitchen. It was a nice scene, having  to watch everyone in the kitchen move around and prepare meals. They looked so classy and neat:)Our 8 course meal was a great experience. One of my favourites was their tuna tartare, which had several sauces for dip and even had rice crackers. I loved their surf and turf, which was lobster with wagyu beef. I was fascinated with wagyu beef and ordered their tartare on the side. It lived up to the hype of price and taste, but to be honest, a good cut of Alberta beef can serve as a good rival.Their take on the mango pudding dessert was amazing.Overall it was an pleasant experience with a staff that was very warm and accommodating.

The food was ok, but didn't blow me away either. Unfortunately, my feelings on the decor/ambiance are probably skewed by the fact we were seated in a corner area of about 6 tables off to the left when you first walk in. I know it may sound like I'm being picky, but it makes you feel disconnected from everything else. The downstairs bar was a decent scene, and everyone who waited on us were polite & friendly. As for the food, it's not that it wasn't good. It was, but just not great. I'd definitely go back soon, however to try some of the other dishes. Appetizers: Oysters w/ Foie Gras: --I've never had oysters served w/ foie gras, but I enjoyed the dish very much. The sauce was a little salty, and thick, but otherwise I thought it was delicious. Steamed Scallops: -- Perfectly cooked. I wanted to pick up the bowl & drink the broth Spicy King Crab: -- Great flavor, but a little too salty Gyoza: -- My least favorite. Bland, and tasted like what you would find in any random Japanese restaurant. Main Course: Ishi Yaki Bop: --This dish is cooked at your table in a stone bowl. The presentation was great, and the rice caramelizing with the sauce is really delicious. Black Cod: --Every place seems to have a version of this dish, but this one was particularly good. Sea Bass: --Cooked perfectly, but I wasn't a big fan of the flavors. Very mild, and almost bland. I personally would have liked more of a contrast of flavors. Dessert: Tofu Hot & Cold: --I thought this dessert was terrible. The consistency of the cheesecake was off, and it tasted pretty bland.

The seabass literally melted in my mouth.  The vegetables weren't soggy at all.  My boyfriend had the rice in the stone pot with yellowtail (forgot the name of the dish), but it was so fun!  A waiter came over and made the dish right in front of us!   Everything was so delicious.  Next, we had sushi - but I felt this was not as great as the entree or appetizer.  Our dessert was the flourless chocolate cake.   I felt the cake was satisfying to end the meal.  We also ordered a rose wine to finish.  I had such a wonderful experience at Morimoto.  All the food was on par and the service was attentive.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Great beer, similar to that of a high end ""Blue Moon.""The selection of foods was more than scrumptious. As appetizers, we ordered:1) Toro Tartare - Amazing in every sense of the word, loved the four different types sauces that came as complements...with the avocado being my favorite.2) Tuna PIzza - Surprisingly very tasty! Who would have thought tuna could be put so well together as a pizza? Well, Morimoto definitely has that figured out!3) Yellowtail Pastrami - My girlfriend's favorite type of sushi, and going to Katz Deli a day prior definitely put us in the mood for the sushi/cold cut combo. Absolutely delish.4) Beef Curry Bread - Definitely did not disappoint, came out as the last appetizer and a great way to finish off our apps!...the sauce inside this bread was melt in your mouth.At this point, we were not yet full, but definitely getting there. As entrees we had ordered:Sea Bass - So tasty and the fish was divine. It came in a miso, as wel as with a Japanese eggplant.

Setting aside my personal bias, I feel I can still say Morimoto is a seafood fantasia.The champion of the evening was the chirashi. Imagine a giant bowl of Korean bibimbap, except with fish in place of nearly all of the vegetables. It's an enormous bowl of sticky sushi rice with sweet sauce, black sesame and ""10-12 different fish and vegetables."" Octopus, my mortal enemy, became my sweet and chewy friend.The zen sai was also an adventure -- five different ""Japanese antipasti,"" including a salty, fried whole mackrel that required a momentary suspension of my spoiled, suburban, 5-year-old self to down whole. The other half of me that loves salty fish won that battle. The smoky bamboo shoots were a complete surprise. The wagyu beef carpaccio was tangy perfection. To top it all off, we sampled half of the cocktail menu, and all were unique, strong, and tasty. For the indecisive, I recommend the sake flight. You might not like one of the three, but you will not be disappointed.Our server was extremely friendly and attentive, and was very knowledgeable about not just the menu, but the food, its history, and the menu concept. On a busy Friday night, everyone onhand had some kind of interaction with our table to ensure we were welcome, whether it be to seat us, keep our glasses full, or clear our plates.Overall, the value-for-dollar in this beautiful location with this expertly-prepared fresh food satisfied not only our tummies, but our wallets, too.

Omg the dish looks SO beautiful that you feel bad eating it!I also love the sushi, the freshness of the fish that you can't really find in New York often. I love the black cod miso too.

But it isn't as expensive as many tasting menus these days, so I wasn't upset. Plus, the food they chose for the tasting menu was all REALLY great, so I was happy. They start you off with a full portion of the Toro Tartare!

The food is worth all this. I had the Aji sashimi- amazing light mackerel flavor, expertly sliced, and I love that they have REAL wasabi, whose light peppery floral notes I look forward to. With the sashimi I also had the salmon skin roll with kaiware (daikon sprouts). As a sushi chef, this was hands down THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD. The combination of the subtly flavored aji with the smokey crunchy bold flavor of the roll was perfect. For entrees my boyfriend got the angry chicken, and I had the toban yaki, which is basically a seafood hot pot with the most velvety delicious broth (lobster clam mussel ginger?

I opted for the Grilled Wagyu Beef which came with (1) miso soup, (2) salad, (3) veggie tempura, (4) sushi platter and (5) raspberry panna cotta with fresh berries.Grilled Wagyu Beef was all right. Nicely marinated. I think it could do with better grilling to give it a slightly crispy exterior.Miso soup was really good. Silken tofu was used!Salad was BAH. Definitely an ornamental dish to add more bulk to the otherwise parse-looking bento box.Veggie tempura. The cheesy sauce was very delicious and in surplus relative to the 3 small pieces of tempura served.Sushi platter. Saviour of the bento box. Tuna uramaki, quoting my friend, which 'instantly melts in your mouth'. Sashimi - very fresh and fantastic!Raspberry panna cotta - good. But I could not figure out how it fit in this Japanese bento box.Being a macaroon-fanatic, I ordered the Morimoto Macaroons - 6 different flavours - green tea with wasabe, black sesame, coffee, eggplant (oh gosh, insanely good), raspberry chocolate w wasabe and yuzu! The macaroons were good for a place which does not specialise in sweets, or french desserts. Decently priced too.I do not think the Prix Fixe menu is highly representative of the restaurant's actual cuisine standard. Unfortunately, the bento box had failed to marvel me and I am unlikely to be back here for the full-fledged Morimoto dining experience.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The sea bass was surprisingly huge which was a big plus since it's my favorite fish. I excepted it to be oily since sea bass is petty oily but it sat pretty heavily in my stomach after I went through half of the fish. The light battered and fried avocado slices were unexpectedly the best part of the dish. The miso soup and the seaweed side dish were pretty good as well. I would be up to coming back for an affordable lunch set again! I think I spent almost $35 on lunch after tax and tip for my $25 lunch box.

What more can you ask for?This is the 2nd time I have frequented Morimoto NY (sans his Grace, Masaharu Morimoto, unfortunately!) Went with a few friends back in 2010 and was pleasantly surprised with the accomodating staff, amazing service, and excellent food. We got the toro tartare, duck duck duck (to die for!), lobster dish, and of course, several rolls! The dessert was beautiful to look at...but all I can remember is the tobacco stick, which was...interesting, to say the least. But I will say that it did complement the rest of the dessert.Went there again on New Years Day with reservations. My boyfriend and I ordered the Omakase chef's tasting menu, which was a fabulous choice since we couldn't decide what to order. We again had our own famouse toro tartare, which was fabulous, since the Philly location does not offer this. The 2nd course was probably my favorite dish of the night which was a beautifully plated yellowtail carpaccio. Seasoned perfectly and such a delicate flavor! Then there was a sort of fondue with a mushroom dipping sauce. Probably my least favorite dish but only because it really just felt like a few pieces of vegetables, albeit presented beautifully. The next several courses were an oyster with foie gras, a sushi sampler dish, a palette cleansing housemade ginger ale, and a lobster & wagyu beef dish with creme fraiche. Finally, the dessert! Wow. I'm generally not a fan of flan, but this was just an incredible explosion of flavors with passion fruit being the highlight! I'm not sure if this is a dessert featured on their regular menu, but it should be!!Last note, visit the bathroom. And often. It's probably borderline obsessive of me, but I have a fascination with beautifully decked out bathrooms in restaurants and the one at Morimoto is one of my favorites. I really can just stand there for a few minutes playing with the buttons on the high-end toilets and still give Morimoto 5 stars. Have a few drinks, visit the bathroom, and go nuts!

1425,I9wXJVePzQfKVm5U_jJexA,Mike A.,4.0 star rating,"My wife and I dined here for the first time this past Saturday night, as it was on our list of must-try, celebrity chef restaurants. The cuisine did NOT disappoint.I threw my wife a curveball right off the bat when I went against our supposed plan of foregoing dual main courses and instead sharing one of the chef's sushi and sashimi combination platters. I sprung my intent to order the Duck Duck Duck entree as we decided on the Oyster Foie Gras and Toro Tartare appetizers. This sent our entire order into a tizzy. Do we now order a sashimi appetizer to get our fill of raw fish? Do we add on a la carte maki rolls later? WHO'S TO SAY WE'RE WRONG ANYWAY? My wife, tormented by indecision in the face of a maddeningly delicious-sounding menu, asked the waiter a few questions and for suggestions and finally made an educated choice: the Ishi Yaki Buri Bop.And yes, we added the Morimoto Sashimi appetizer.Each appetizer arrived only as we finished the prior one, and all 3 were epic in taste, creativity and quality. The Oysters Foie Gras were large and plump, the foie gras rich and buttery, the uni on top complimenting the bite perfectly. The teriyaki sauce drizzled over them was salty and amazing. The sashimi platter was a bit on the small side, but the one portion of rare A5 Wagyu beef it included INSTANTLY made the dish worth the excess shekels. The entire platter and garnish, including flowers, was edible. One bite of yellowfish I took included a tiny flower that kicked me with a zesty lemon that I wasn't expecting. The wife couldn't believe everything was edible and delicious. The Toro Tartare was everything it has been extensively made out to be- fatty, delicious, melt-in-your-mouth tuna belly with a dash of caviar served with6 condiments that compliment it in different ways. My favorite combo was a toro-avocado-sour cream-chives-crispy corn pellets. My wife couldn't let go of her toro-wasabi-seaweed paste combo. Both amazing.Bring on dinner!Duck Duck Duck was better than I imagined it would be. The roasted leg was plump and juicy, perfectly cooked to medium rare, with crispy skin and a layer of fat just beneath. The foie gras crossaint with duck breast was a rather large, impressively large sandwich and the over-easy duck egg was perfectly made, begging to have its yolky goodness released all over my plate. The table prep of my wife's Buri Bop was EASILY the highlight of the meal, as it is served in a scalding hot stone bowl, and the yellowtail slices are placed along the edge of the bowl to sear as the server expertly mixes the rice, kimchi and sauce as it cooks, finally breaking an egg yolk into the fold and mixing for the last time. The yellowtail slices are then placed back on the mixture to be enjoyed... I felt thoroughly unimportant after seeing this prep, FYI. Both dishes were heaven. Pure heavenly goodness. I wanted to lick my plate and suck on duck bones afterward. But that would've been inappropriate.Room for dessert? WHY NOT?Feeling like we never wanted to leave, I ordered the apple bread pudding and my wife the Mori Monkey Bread. This course put us over the top. We canceled movie plans and went straight back to the hotel to rest afterward. I had nothing left to offer the night... The pudding was rich and dense, the brown butter ice cream was perfectly sweet, the green tea crumbles were delicious. The fresh fruit side was super cold and fresh. It all went together beautifully. The bite of monkey bread and bananas that my wife gave me was sweet, dense, heavy... Ridiculously good. We'd love to go back just to have a completely different meal. The loss of one star was because our table was off to the side of reception and by a frosted window being slapped by a banner in the heavy winds, with no view of the beautiful interior or what was happening in the center of it all.That is all.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The service: rushed; the ambiance: tables were too closely packed to even be able to not eavesdrop on your neighbor's conversation; the decor was cheap modern (water bottles and lighting accents does not enhance one's experience).But the food, oh the food. The tuna tartare had a interesting presentation, but portioned enough maybe for an infant, the fondue was overly salty and disjoined, the fois gras uni oyster was ostentatious without needing to be, sushi was forgetful, and wagyu beef and lobster was really quite exquisite.To have achieved greatness as Morimoto has, it was quite disappointing to see his namesake not live up to the well-deserved expectation.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
1427,WT8ZSMgXTfxhserS0oYNsg,Alex W.,4.0 star rating,"Winter 2012 Restaurant Week finally rolled around and I wanted to take Morimoto for a spin. I was perplexed as to why they didn't publicize its lunch menu as it did last year but I learned the hard truth when I walked in for lunch today. It seemed like they always had a prix fixe lunch menu since it was already preprinted onto the front page of its regular lunch menu. This doubled as their restaurant week menu which are three bento box options:1 - Wagyu Beef2 - Black Cod3 - Vegetarian Bento BoxEach of the bento boxes come with tofu miso soup, 3 pieces of tempura with a layer of Gonzalo cheese dipping on the bottom, a bowl of mixed green salad, 3 pieces of spicy tuna taken from a Makizushi type of sushi roll, 3 pieces of nigiri (White tuna, tuna, and I can't remember the last piece but I think it was salmon) and then a bowl of the above mentioned entree of your choice. I do wish the cheese dipping came separate from the tempura because it just wasn't expected from the Japanese vibe on the bento box. I also wasn't much of a fan of it and tried to wipe the dipping sauce off my tempura before consuming it.The actual entree portion for the wagyu beef was actually just a few slices (like 3) but the bowl of cod had a good number of pieces (like 8) No one in my party got the vegetarian option.In hindsight, I shouldn't have been attracted by the celebrity name of the restaurant and should have skipped over this place for restaurant week. The restaurant week menu really didn't hold anything unique to the Morimoto name, except for the fact you're sitting in one of his chairs eating in his restaurant. Instead, I should have saved the money from today's lunch and come back for an actual morimoto styled dinner. Needless to say, I can't turn back time, but as a tip for those who walk out not completely full, you can get some food from Chelsea Market right next door.

Hiding? :(Secondly, this is my 400th review. I saved it for something special: Morimoto'sThirdly, I have to say Morimoto's isn't that close to a metro stop. We still had to walk after getting off at 8th Av. Don't do it in heels. Here's the front of Morimoto's: static.px.yelp.com/bphot…Stairs leading downstairs: static.px.yelp.com/bphot…We arrived about 15 mins after our reservation time and we were asked to go downstairs to the bar area to wait. We sat at the bar and ordered two drinks: one was a lychee martini (forget the name) and the other was called 'SnapDragon.' For $14 a drink, it better be F-ing TASTY! And sure enough, it was. I enjoyed both drinks. We were shortly escorted to our first booth. The lighting was dim, I felt cramped, and I couldn't enjoy the full effect of being in Morimoto's restaurant static.px.yelp.com/bphot…. We quickly spotted an open table in the middle of the restaurant and asked if we could move there. Wish granted! Our server, Delilah was seriously THE BOMB. She deserved over a 20% tip!! She explained everything as if she had tasted them all before. She gave us her suggestions and gave us an honest answer about all the dishes. She was spot on about giving us napkins, new plates, refills, etc. The one thing she was backed up on was not giving us our utensils when our main dish came out. She came by and apologized. I told her it was alright but she said she wanted to acknowledge that she was behind in serving us. I have to say she was the most courteous server I've ever experienced. Here's what we had, in order! And we skipped out on Omakase because it was $120.00 a person. Maybe next time! :)TORO TARTARE static.px.yelp.com/bphot…This plate gets the best presentation award for the night! The toro was sitting in a bowl of ice accompanied by 6 different dipping sauces: wasabi, sour cream, nori paste (seaweed), chives, guac, and Japanese crackers. The dish was adorned with a small scoop of caviar, a purple orchid and a small green peach. We didn't know what the small green ball was at first and when the bus boys came by to take it, he told us that the green ball was a Japanese peach and that we should eat it. We surely did. But the toro tartare was soft, butter, and so good. My rec. is a spoon full of the toro, nori paste, chives, and the Japanese crackers. SOFT SHELL CRAB MAKI static.px.yelp.com/bphot…I have to admit this has probably got to be the best tasting soft shell crab maki I've had. You can actually taste the crab unlike most other rolls where the flavor of the rice and sauce mask the soft shell crab. SPICY HAMACHI MAKI static.px.yelp.com/bphot…The hamachi melted in my mouth! I was definitely a fan. The spicy sauce wasn't too spicy so for those who fear it, I wouldn't be fearful of this dish.SURF & TURF static.px.yelp.com/bphot…Kobe Filets & Hamachi Ribbons. I have to add that this was probably the worst presentation that Morimoto's had. Anyway, the potatoes it came with were so delicious. Every bite bursted in your mouth (that's what she said)!! The kobe beef was juicy and cooked well -- but I wish it had some sort of steak sauce to go with it. The hamachi was mixed with this sauce and avocados, which goes well by itself, or with a spoonful of rice. With a spoonful of rice, the hamachi and avos turn into maki!SEAFOOD TOBANYAKI static.px.yelp.com/bphot…Half shell lobster, king crab, mussel, clam, diver scallop in a red miso sake broth. The miso sake broth was TO DIE FOR. The BF loves miso soup and he really enjoyed this dish. He compared it to an Italian Cioppino but instead this would be a Japanese Cioppino. The seafood that was incorporated in this dish was fresh. You could definitely taste it. Our server recommended us to have this with a bowl of rice, and she definitely made a good suggestion. WARM CHOC CAKE + POPCORN ICE CREAM static.px.yelp.com/bphot…Wait what? POPCORN ICE CREAM? This was sweet and salty at the same time and it definitely had a weird kick to it. The warm chocolate cake reminded me of a lava cake minus the choc goodness that would flow out from a lava cake. This dessert was good, but definitely was not the star of the night. I really enjoyed dinner and we spent about 2.5 hours dining. Not to mention a fight we witnessed inside!! I love fine dining especially when it comes with impeccable service and delicious food.

And the hype def lived up to what we expected of Morimoto. All the pictures on yelp gave me a really good idea to how the restaurant was. Especially all the raves about the bathroom. I was a bit intrigued by the heavy sliding door to the bathroom, but the individual bathroom stall has a large glass/mirror wall that reflected off each other to give it an infinity ombre dimensioned back wall in the stall. The entrance to the restaurant was unique and well thought out. It completely fits into the chelsea/high line neighborhood. The glass bottle wall is a great center piece of the restaurant. The ceiling looks like waves or water and gives the large room dimension. Though I'm not crazy about the worn dirty chairs and tables, the chopsticks were super. Meaning, they were so unique- they are rounded on the top, with a spiral stick ending up with a pointy square bottom end. Me and boy got the bento box lunches-code & waygu beef. We also tried the toro tartare, ginger lemonade and morimoto ice tea. The drinks are as they were described on the menu. The lemonade with a good addicting kick of ginger and the ice tea with muddle blueberry and capico. We love our capico! The toro tartare was small. It was very pretty look at and really well presented, but for the $31 I would say try a different appetizer. However, since I never can caviar, I guess it would be well worth the price. Tartare is in a small clear rectangular tray with a teaspoon of caviar which you are suppose to spread out. On the side is a little cup of fish sauce? To be honest, I am not sure. I had a lot of trouble keeping my tartare on the spoon as I dipped it in the sauce. It was too deep and my tartare kept dropping into the cup! Of the six different sauces wasabi and rice crunchies were my favorite. There was a review that said Morimoto is the only one who makes real wasabi. No joke, you can def taste the difference in quality of wasabi. The hot-clearing-my-nasal-path sensation is twice as strong and quickly went away. The paste is less soft and more beaded and disperses easily in soy sauce. The bento boxes had 6 items - the cod or wagyu beef, chef selected sushi, sushi roll, veggie tempura, tofu miso soup & mixed green salad with a vinaigrette. The waiter comes by and tells you exactly what everything is, which is impressive and very informative. The chef selected sushi were the same in our bento boxes, but were different from the next table. The table are very close to each other, so you can def hear the next party's conversation. They say the fish is fresh from tokyo everyday, which was impressive to hear of but didn't taste any different from Kotobuki. We loved the fresh salad and the veggie tempura with a cheese sauce on the bottom. And the cod...was to die for. So juicy and soft. The wagyu beef was tender and full of flavor. We ended our lunch with the chocolate cake and black sesame panna cotta. All the black sesame lovers out there, you have to try this because it takes black sesame to another level. It was topped with sake whipped cream. So different! And the chocolate cake was so GOOD! The soft cake paired with the chocolate lava and sorbet was excellent!

I was looking forward to it for weeks and we finally went today.The food was mediocre. My wagyu rib eye was definitely not spectacular (btw, I'm a rib-eye aficionado). Marbling was below expectations compared to other non-Japanese wagyu cuts but barely above USDA Prime grade. I've had more tender rib-eye in other steak-houses than this ""wagyu"" at Morimoto's. I requested it rare but what I got was medium.  Unfortunately, I also allowed a sauce to be poured over the steak. It was extremely salty from the first bite. It was salty throughout but did not want to make a big deal in front of my girlfriend.  I just kept drinking water to wash the salt down.  The waiter was not being attentive with our table so I often ran out of water.  He was much more attentive of the wealthy-looking couple siting at the table right next to us.  Furthermore, the rib-eye came out pre-cut even after I specifically told the waiter I did NOT want it pre-cut.  Once again, I did not want to make a scene in front of my girlfriend.We also got the Morimoto sashimi. I was disappointed here as well. Each fish was sliced extremely thin and layered on each other. I understand that in upscale restaurants, portions are going to be small.  This dish, however, had thin slices of typical sashimi that you would find in any sushi restaurant.  The result was bite-size sashimi that lacked both texture and distinct flavor.  The toppings and 5 sauces were interesting. (btw, this dish looks much bigger in pictures than in real life.I also ordered cognac on the rocks, but what I got was room temperature cognac without ice.My girlfriend had duck duck duck, and I think it was nicely done. I wasn't too fond of the sauces but the duck egg was a more than adequate dipping sauce. The duck was crispy on the outside and very juicy on the inside.  She also ordered a foie gras custard and it was delicious. It was the best thing I had all night. It was similar I beef bone marrow but richer in favor and texture.  I've never had foie gras before and this custard got me hooked.We also ordered dessert, but since I'm not a fan of deserts, I'm not going to review them. My gf loved them though.Overall, I had high expectations for a restaurant owned by an Iron Chef.  My overall experience here fell well below my expectation based on service and the two dishes I ordered.  This restaurant lost three stars due to poor service, inability to take my very simple orders properly, and just poorly executed ""wagyu"" rib-eye dish.  I'm giving it two stars because the foie gras custard was really good and because my girlfriend had a positive experience here.  Morimoto's restaurant is always busy, i get it, but there was no reason for service to be this bad.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We couldn't enjoy our dessert because we had to be at a jazz concert that began at 10pm, which we ended up being late to anyway due to the slloooowww service we received. Shame on you Morimoto! When one makes a reservation for 7pm, they should not leave at 10:15 without enjoying their dessert!!!!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Living in SF we have great places to eat, but I had a slight fascination with the iron chef aspect of this place. The food is really tasty- some items more fantastic than others. I really wanted to be impressed with the ahi in the stone bowl- but it ended up being overcooked ahi that wasn't rare at all.

1440,0zVDRH6dMRMn-cL40cDi_g,C M.,5.0 star rating,"Review Update...8 Course Omakase...  $120.00Here's the list of items served on the Omakase...Chu Toro Tartar: The tasting menu started off with a Toro Tartar. The presentation of the Tuna was in a finally mashed, almost in the form of crushed bananas served to an infant. The tuna was then spread out on a wood tray that measured 3"" x 2"" x .25"", The Chu Toro was accompanied by a variety of dips (ie: Caviar, Scallions, etc...). Overall, I found the Chu Toro to be delectable. Although the texture presentation took away from the ability to chew and savor the texture of the actual Chu Toro, the taste in its own right was classic and clean. Unlike that of basic Maguro, the Chu Toro provided a bit of fatty substance which truly emphasizes the true nature of Chu Toro.Stripped Bass w/ Scallion Garnish topped with Hot Oil, Ponzu and Soy Sauce. The second dish of the Omakase presented a base of 5 pieces of Stripped Bass sashimi which was then layered with micro greens, topped off with Hot Oil, Ponzu, and Soy Sauce. The dish reminds me of the basic Tilapia dish at my house where the same application would apply only the Tilapia would be steamed (thus cooking thoroughly) prior to the application of the Scallions, Soy Sauce, and Hot Oil. What Morimoto manages to portray with this dish is that the subtle texture of the Stripped Bass is greatly enhanced by the Oil and the Soy Sauce. The extra micro green garnishes that are present on the dish gives an earthly and clean appeal, which greatly paves way to the nature texture of the Stripped Bass.Yellowtail Cerviche: Comparable to the previous Stripped Bass dish, the Yellowtail Cerviche tasting is by far the best item of the entire Omakase menu. The dish, although simple but invigorating, is presented with a base of 4 slices of Yellowtail Sashimi, then covered with a buttery miso tasting sauce. With each of the four bites, the palates begin to enhance through the smooth and buttery taste that's greatly harnessed by the fatty nature of the Yellowtail and the buttery base of the miso sauce.Sea Oyster over Sea Salt: The dish is as mentioned. A single piece of Oyster lays on a bed of Sea Salt. The Oyster is medium sized (about .5 ounces, or a single bite). The presentation of the dish as a base of Sea Salt which is then layed over by the Oyster (with shell intact, but open). The taste of the Oyster is from the oyster sauce and diced scallions that top off this dish. The single bite of the Oyster gives its consumer a fresh oyster taste that is greatly enhanced by both the sauce and the scallions.Macaroon w/ Green Tea Dip: A single peace of Macaroon lays in the middle of two contraptions used to make the Green Tea. The application of this dish starts with its diner picking up the tea pot, pouring hot water into a small cup containing powder that forms the base of the green tea. The tea is then prepared and is then wisked onto the Macaroon. The dish is nothing to really comment about, the Macaroon did not present any spectacular flavors that needs to be emphasized, not does the Green Tea additive give this dish any appeal. If anything, I would've been better off with a Spicy Tuna Roll...Sushi: 6 pieces of sushi forms the base of this portion of the Omakase. The 6 pieces consisted of Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Stripped Bass, Eel, and Chu Toro. I'll leave any description of this dish except that each individual piece was fresh and clean. Once again, nothing extremely fancy.Half Lobster Accompanied by Sear Wagyu Beef &amp; Sweet Potatoes: As described a Lobster is split in half down the middle and served with all exteriors in place. The lobster was seared with a basic butter sauce and a spicy seasoning. The texture of the Lobster was perfect, giving the Lobster a tender and moist base while allowing the succulent meat of the lobster to stand out. The second half of this entree was the Seared Wagyu Beef over Japanese Sweet Potatoes. I'd have to say, Wagyu is best served raw. The equally distributed marbling that's present in Wagyu allows for consumers to obtain an equal balance of fat and protein with each bite. Wagyu on this particular occasion was considered ""lightly seared"". If there was an option to have Wagyu dropped on my lap without it being cooked, I would've gladly asked for it. Red Bean Cake w/ Hazelnut Ice Cream (Dessert): The description says it all. The only comment I need make regarding this dessert is that the Red Bean Cake presented a fluffy texture that's common with perfectly baked cakes. The red bean in the cake was still ripe and maintained it's structure through cooking.I'd have to say, I was not overly impressed with this particular Omakase menu. The food left me under whelmed, as the portions were dismal. Of the 8 dishes served, I would have to say that only 2 of them truly stood out (the Chu Toro Tartar and the Yellowtail Cerviche). The remaining 6 dishes failed to live up to the reputation of a Morimoto Omakase.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
1441,zpfvT1HIBC8tF5SvZVw05w,Priscilla S.,4.0 star rating,"I have to admit, I had high hopes like many people who want to try Morimoto's famous food. I visited New York City for break and wanted to try out different foodie places. My friend wanted to show me Morimoto's because he had been there twice already, so I figured it was a good idea. I made reservations for Morimoto's on a Monday evening because I figured it wouldn't be too busy or crowded for a nice quiet dinner. I checked the website. It was pretty innovative. I can already tell it's a very dressy place.When we arrived, we were seated at a petite table inbetween two couples. A little snug because it was a bit awkward trying to get to my seat. The ambiance is very nice - very contemporary. But the lighting is too dim for my taste. I could barely see the table in front of me. I kind of wished we sat at the sushi bar. I was actually interested in the sushi. But my friend says he's known for his dishes. So I opted for the Morimoto Sashimi appetizer and he ordered the Lobster Fritters. I loved the fritters! They were piping hot and soft, they reminded me of Japanese takoyaki (octopus fritters). The Morimoto Sashimi presentation was cute. It's very petite. It almost looks too cute to eat. There were also a bunch of little pipet sauces to go along with the sashimi. I tried them with it, but I felt since there were already topped garnishes on the sashimi, the sauces didn't really enhance the flavors. They were a nice colorful touch though. They were also paired with a berry and wasabi. The wasabi was surprisingly sweet and not very intense, which was not bad.We ordered our entrees later. The server was helpful when I asked what fish dish she'd recommend. She also introduced a new special entree that had grilled pork and fried pork belly served. It sounded interesting, so my friend ordered it (despite him not a fan of pork, but it was something different from what he was going to order - which was the Deep Sea, he ordered last visit). After much debate from wanting to order nigiri and sushi rolls, I decided on the sea trout dish. Both dishes were $30 each. When the dishes arrived, they looked beautiful! The presentation was simple and elegant. My trout was cooked perfectly and very buttery. I have to admit, I almost got a little sick on how fatty it tasted. It was good, but too much. I had the perfect amount just to myself. I tried the pork belly too, and it too was very fatty - it melted in my mouth. Overall, I got stuffed and didn't opt for dessert. Even though I noticed the couple next to us ordered a full course meal with the dessert that looked amazing! But I couldn't stomach the dessert, unfortunately.I have to mention the bathroom toilets are cool. It was my first experience with the innovative robot toilet. I need one in my own home.The total bill came to about $113 for two people. My friend had an iced tea, we shared two appetizers, and two entrees. I thought it was not bad price for a big name especially in NYC, but still expensive for my wallet. I think I'd come back to try the sushi. I thought that for the price and quality, the food was good, but not incredibly innovative. The dishes we ordered to me were simple, tasteful, but not as I expected. Because it was by an Iron Chef, I imagined his dishes to be out of this world. This experience was good and I can say now that I've at least tried it once.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

My party arrived on time and we were told to wait downstairs at the bar because our table 'was not quite ready'. The host said he would get us but after 20 minutes of waiting we got antsy and two of us went back upstairs to inquire. The host then made the mistake of thinking it was a party of 2 instead of 5. When he was corrected we were seated. The whole area was actually empty. After reading other reviewer's experiences regarding the service at Morimoto, I've come to the conclusion that Morimoto leads you to the bar first in order to get customers to spend more money. Do not be fooled!We decided to skip the omakase and went for appetizers, sushi and entrees instead. Our waiter misheard shrimp tempura roll for the rock shrimp appetizer. We took it anyway and it was a blessing in disguise. It was awesome. I definitely recommend it as a must for the table. The foie gras chawan mushi was really good. It had a tofu like texture but is really an egg custard. The house smoked ravioli was a miss. For entrees, everyone loved their dish. Fish was a big hit (sea bass and braised black cod). The portion was actually big. The wagyu filet got glowing reviews. I looked at it and it was a very small portion of beef. It came with a side of boiled fingerling potatoes and a citrus avocado salad. I call it guacamole. The sushi was really good. Very fresh and of generous proportions (soft shell crab roll and shrimp tempura roll). To round out the meal we also got the market fresh vegetable of the day: roasted brussel sprouts.At each course, we got a new waiter. I don't know if that was intentional but they never told us they were switching over. We didn't even know who to talk to if we needed something. When we were served our main meal we had about six people come over but they had no idea who ordered what. They had looks of confusion as well as we. I was really excited and determined about dessert. We chose the chocolate mousse, apple turban, and raspberry cheesecake. We were hugely disappointed in the lack of flavor and presentation. I know Asian desserts are less sweet but these were just bland and odd in combination. The cheesecake was deconstructed and tasted like fluff. The ice cream on top of the mousse had melted and it was delivered looking like a pool. The apple turban was less turban and more like sliced apples on a plate. Way to go pastry chef! When our new waitress came over to ask how we liked it, there was a long awkward silence pause. After two spoonfuls, we were disinterested and didn't have the heart to tell her. She picked up fast and offered to give us something else but we were too turned off to even want anything else from Morimoto.Morimoto was a huge disappointment for us. The food was decent but the atmosphere, décor, and service was really not our style. The interior design had my cousin repeating over and over, ""Who is this designer?"" in a bad way. Yes, the seats, ceiling, and room dividers looked cheap. The communal dining tables are terrible. If you've ever complained about small restaurants and squishy tables, don't even bother with Morimoto. There was not even space to get into your seat as everything kisses each other. Your neighbors will be in your business and vice versa and the seats are reminiscent of pleather and 80's.If you want a see and be seen type of place and not break the bank, you can get that here. For us, we were expecting something a little quieter and more refined. Morimoto is a plummeted shooting Starr which banks on the Iron Chef franchise.

That's why I was at Morimoto.Morimoto deserves 5 stars. But there's a catch. Do not attempt to save money by ordering the lunch bento. Instead, pay what you must pay in order to truly enjoy the offerings of chef Morimoto.My lunch began with the chef's $40 assorted sashimi plate as a shared appetizer. It was SO WONDERFUL. The tuna was a mesmerizing bright red color, a pigment of such intensity and that seldomly graces a sashimi plate. (I typically see a pinker variety of tuna). The fatty salmon had excellent texture, the raw scallop was delicately paired with lime, the octopus was perfectly chewy, and the other fish like the fluke and yellowtail were delightful. My eating partner, normally a ""stuff as much food as possible into the mouth"" who shovels and breathes his food in took a bite of the salmon, closed his eyes for just a brief moment, and slowly swallowed. Amazing.His 12 oz. prime steak, uni, and toro sushi came shortly thereafter. All according to him were spot on. The prime steak, which I eyed jealously, looked tender and juicy with the perfect amount of pinkness.I had the black cod bento, not actually for the purpose of saving money, but moreso because I wanted a variety of small dishes. The miso soup and salad were not particularly remarkable, although that was expected. The tempura was what I really craved, although the portions were much smaller than I had anticipated. One potato, one green bean, and one green onion. Bah! For dipping is a blue cheese sauce (nearly the death of me because I can't stand blue cheese), although for someone else, that may be quite an interesting pairing. The black cod was delicious, with tiny bits of asian mushroom (not shitake, although I couldn't make out the variety) and black bean. Complex flavors swirled in my mouth, but for only a few seconds. The portion was teency weency! There were pieces of sushi that came with my bento as well, which paled tremendously compared to the sashimi that came before it. The fish was not nearly as fresh, the color and texture indicating its sub par quality.Lastly came the panna cotta dessert as part of my bento, which was perfectly portioned - a sweet little something something to end a meal. It was delicately made and very enjoyable.Quick notes: the service was professional, and the atmosphere was not overly stuffy.

Watching Iron Chef Morimoto on food network and all the hype behind him had me ecstatic to visit his restaurant. After a great day in the city with my girlfriend, we headed over to Morimoto. We  arrived a little early for our reservation but was seated promptly, which was great. The waiter was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu and helping us make a few decisions on what to eat. My girlfriend and I decided on the Toro Tartar which was served very nicely, the presentation was incredible. It tasted delicious and the dippings were so good, I would definitely recommend this to anyone going here. We also ordered a spicy tuna roll which I know is very simple roll and you can't get a simple roll and be too judgmental but being that I have been to a ton of Japanese restaurants and think I have a pretty good taste for sushi, I regrettably say I was disappointed. It was good and fresh but not the best I've had and didn't blow me away like I had hoped it would, it just tasted like a roll I could get anywhere. Next for our main course, after a lot of positive reviews and the love both my girlfriend and I have for duck, we both went with the duck, duck, duck. The dish was served in two parts, the foie gras croissant which was awesome and the roast duck which was very disappointing. The croissant was so delicious and I wish it were bigger and the whole dish, the roast duck I found to be a little flavorless and just bleh. By the end of our meal I was very very disappointed and didn't want to try dessert because we didn't want to be further disappointed. The decor is very modern and inviting but the one thing I hated was the way it was set up. For the prices they charge I do not want to be on top of my neighbors and have to move the table over to get up and sit down from the table (I am an average build). The tables were just so on top of each other that I found it hard to have a conversation without becoming distracted by the conversations around us.This is the second iron chef restaurant that I've gone to that I was extremely disappointed by after all the hype.

But with someone as world renowned as Chef Morimoto, I came in with high expectations, and was expecting to be blown away. While $120 for omakaze is pretty reasonable, I was unimpressed by Morimoto's tasting menu (with a few exceptions...) I was waiting to be blown away by japanese technique and innovative dishes that would knock my socks off. While the quality of food was excellent, I was underwhelmed with what was being featured in the omakase. Truthfully, it seemed as if Morimoto was dumbing it down for us Americans and showcased Americanized versions of Japanese classics. (and some dishes were simply not Japanese at all)I will say that the first course of toro DID blow me away. It came beautifully presented on a mini washboard looking contraption, different accoutrement, and beautiful beautiful fresh toro. This was the perfect start to the meal, but it raised the bar for the rest of the meal....and the rest of the meal was good, but not memorable.  I would say that I would come back for a la carte menu items, but not the omakase. That way I can choose on my own and venture into Morimoto's little world. I would definitely try it again, but not the omakase.

Looking at it from outside I was damn sure I was at the wrong place, until I noticed the Hiragana that read """" on the curtains. Once you step inside you're amazed by the contrast of two sides of the door. The lady at the front was real nice and she led us to our table without wait, which made me happy since I was having dinner with a business partner. We ended up ordering many dishes, and a nice Junmai type sake to go with them. I strongly urge people to try the appetizers and explore more unknown dishes instead of jumping straight to nigiri, rolls or sashimi. Japanese cuisine is more than that you know.Well I can say that their bathrooms are equally entertaining especially when you walk down the stairs towards the bar then to the bathrooms. It reminds me of the W Hotel in Seoul or Setai on 5th Avenue, where they have this ultra modern and sleek look.Overall, it's a good place to dine with friends and large groups since it gets a little loud during the peak time. For business dinners, only bring people you know well enough, because most likely you will be tipsy thanks to the alcohol after an hour ..",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
1461,OjeO-DlGwmLGOe5z3-vfWw,Marielle S.,5.0 star rating,"Went here yesterday for lunch with friends. Prior to going, I perused the lunch menu and was a little nervous that I would walk away from the meal still hungry and a lot more broke. (Thinking of a certain meal I had with my fiance at an authentic Japanese restaurant where I was still so hungry that we got pizza afterwards) I'm glad to say that no such thing happened here! And I was sharing all the food with two other people! First, I liked the decor both outside and inside. Upon walking in, you notice the playful variation on noren (curtains)-- commonly found in front of the entrance for things like shops, izakayas, etc. Charming nod to Morimoto's heritage. The inside was a little on the dimly lit side and was modern, minimalist, sleek, and functional. (Seats that don't awkwardly scrape the floor to announce that you're either going to sit down or get up) I felt like the focus of the decor was to showcase the open kitchen in the back of the restaurant and I enjoyed that. It lends a sense of pride in and respect for the food they are making. Any place serving sushi really should have a sushi counter. And this is random but I notice people mention how cool the bathrooms are. If you've never seen a Japanese toilet, you will be mindblown. (I was when I first encountered them in Japan). That said, I like that they put this cool looking wall panel of what looks to be cherry blossom in a mirror.. looks like it goes on forever. O_o;Service was generally good. The food came out quickly which was a nice plus. However, our waiter was a little pushy. I opened the check just to glance quickly at it while eating dessert and then closed it-- the next thing we knew he was reaching for it. None of us had finished eating dessert at that point so my friends hadn't yet looked at the bill. On that note, I won't totally knock him because we only ordered one bento box for entire table to share. We got the fruit panna cotta last and he brought over two extra ones so we didn't have to split the dessert among the 3 of us. ^.^Good variety on the menu in terms of food and drink. We all ordered different non alcoholic drinks. My one friend had the ginger lemonade (house-made ginger syrup, lemon, thyme), the other the virgin white lily (calpico, yuzu juice, lemon juice), and I had the tokonatsu (coconut, shiso, lime). I didn't try the other drinks, but mine was refreshing and delicious.The food was excellent. I know you must be thinking, for the price it better be-- every single bite of food I had that day was. For the bento box, I was expecting a salad drenched in orange ginger dressing with a side of california roll. To my delight, the bento box had pieces of yellowfin tuna roll and sashimi. The miso soup was rich in flavor with decent sized blocks of silken tofu. The tempura was crisp, the coating had a nice salt to it, and I liked variety of vegetables used (one was asparagus). The tempura was sitting on top of a delicate blue cheese sauce. The salad was deliciously dressed in yuzu juice and topped with just enough fried, crispy onion. The cod came with bok choy and eggplant. The panna cotta came in a fairly big bowl. Yogurt crumbles and fruit slices (grape, kiwi, strawberry) on a bed of creamy mango mousse. The bento box portion wise is definitely more than enough food for one person and at $25 for all that, worth it in my opinion. We also ordered a regular salmon roll, eel avocado roll, shiso maki (pickled plum and shiso leaf which is like a subtle mint leaf) and I suggested the hotate (scallop) since it's one of my favorites. Again, every bite from start to finish of the meal was worth it. Came out to about $28 person (without tip) since we shared all of it and we all left full.Would definitely come back!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Very elegant and very simple! From what I remember high ceilings and simple modern settings.Service was good  our waitress was very knowledgeable and was on point!FOOOOOD!!! AmazingAppetizer Tuna Pizza - This was good but I've had better Japanese infused Pizza but it did tease my palette with the texture and spicy kickCalamari Tempura Salad - A yummy salad with great texture and the dressing was very light and not over powering the salad was large enough to feed 4 people!Spicy King Crab - If you like the Spicy Mussels they serve at the other Japanese restraurnat you will love this!! One of my fav dishes Tempura Shrimp Thing done 2 ways - This actually reminded me of Walnut prawns with a wasabi kick!! Was good but probably wouldn't order this againEntreesSea Bass -  Was biggest stand out.  It just melts in your mouth.  AmazingSurf and Turf - PASS I've had better steak and this just couldn't stand up to the Sea Bass or The Black CodBlack Cod - was also very good - probably the best miso cod I've hadMorimoto I will be visiting again once I'm in town!!

I am typically not a fan of 'modern' super white walls and space aged design, but somehow this gargantuan, scene of a restaurant pulls it off and makes it acceptable.(And yes, it *is* a scene!  Dress code for men: Button down long sleeve shirts, jeans, ""hip"" shoes.  Dress code for women: Patterned but unobtrusive simple dresses. - Just an observation ;)We did *not* get the Omakase but we did (thanks to reading yelp reviews) get the Tuna Tartar - and what fun!!! The presentation of it is so fun! (Much to my friend's dismay. Any unusual seeming food really disturbs him).  And yes, I think it's great when food can be fun!The 'go withs' for the tar tar were just fabulous - the fresh wasabi! the roe (I adore thee) - and amazing guacamole!The eel and avocado roll melts in your mouth, and is a must-order if you're going the roll route.On the other hand, the spicy yellowtail roll, while fresh, was not very spicy at all - and I asked for jalapenos to come in it, though they were entirely pointless and may as well have been bell peppers!  So sad.The california roll was my friend's doing and unfortunate as even the crab meat, and ultimately the entire roll, was bland. The Chocolate ganache with accompanying sesame seed ice cream was nothing short of amazing.And yes, the toilets were interesting (we do have to note the bathrooms when reviewing Morimoto!) and I was in love with the flowers behind them in the walls.  I really hope to go back here with my sis sometime, and will attack more of the appetizers, and try the oysters with foie gras for sure (because, really, how could I not?)",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

However, my boyfriends chicken was undercooked and raw!  We were worried because this is dangerous. He noticed after two bites and sent it back. We waited at the table for 25 minutes mid-dinner. I stopped eating because I didn't want to eat before my date! We expressed our frustration and they gave us a tuna tar tar pizza while we waited. Once the chicken finally came out we weren't even hungry anymore. It was just a completely ruined dinner. We took everything to go and left without eating!The wait staff AND management were very understanding and apologetic. They covered our dinner which we were relieved about and invited us back for another try if we were interested. We would go back because of how they handled the situation.

Glad I did as the place was packed!We were a little early so the hostess informed us we could wait in the bar area downstairs until our table was ready. The bar area is small but has a nice intimate feel to it and the bartenders were friendly and attentive. We tried a glass of the rose champagne which was good. Not too sweet or tart, just refreshing. We ended up having to wait longer than our reservation time for our table and were pretty hungry so decided to split the Ramen Soup (""iron chef"" chicken noodle soup) while still at the bar. Let me tell you, this was the best chicken noodle soup I have tasted. I could really taste the chicken in the broth and the noodles were so good. Only downside was that there were maybe only 3-4 pieces of chicken - more broth & noodles in the dish. My second drink choice was a glass of Chianti which went perfectly with the rest of our meal.We were finally seated at our table and the manager handled the delay beautifully. We were brought out complimentary appetizers (a sashimi salad & another sashimi plate). Both were excellent! I wish I could remember what type of fish the sashimi plate was - the cooks spiced it up and it was so good. I didn't see it on the menu so assume it was a chef's ""in the moment"" creation.We decided to get the chef's sashimi platter to share - for two people the $80 one is the best option so you don't feel you are shorted sashimi for the price. The waiter accommodated our request that we not get any beef or octopus in our sashimi - all we really cared for was the fish!!After this we decided to try the whole roasted lobster as a test to me since I usually don't like it. The verdict? It was alright - very lightly done with garam masala but still enjoyable for us to share. The other main entrée we were tempted to try was the Angry Chicken but knew we wouldn't have room for dessert!Finally dessert - not a huge selection on the menu but what caught our eye was the Chocolate Macadamia Nut Bar. This was so yum!! The dish even had some thin slices of dried pineapple which gave a little sourness to the dessert (offsetting all the sugar). Definitely glad we opted for dessert.I definitely will go back when I am in town again to sample some of the other dishes!!

The Ishi Yaki Buri Bop is a yellowtail mix with rice dish, they cook this dish at your table and it was quite entertaining as well as good.

To be honest, I expect most chefs out of Food Network to be a total fluke, but then again he's only featured on that one show. Admittedly, I've never ordered any sort of sushi at Morimoto's, which is pretty much a crime, but whatever. On my first visit, I had the rock shrimp, and the ""Duck Duck Duck"". The rock shrimp was pretty solid, but it's not something that I would order again there. The duck dish was very enjoyable though. The fat between the skin and meat was completely rendered out, leaving some perfectly crispy skin, and super tender meat. I do have a small complaint however. The duck is extremely rich. I love rich food, but this birdie sunk into my stomach like a rock. It tasted great, but leaves an odd feeling in your gut. Basically, it's a very heavy entree. On other occasions I've tried the angry chicken and their molten chocolate cake. The chicken was nothing to write home about. In fact, it was a tad bland. As for the cake, it's was . . . . . relatively good, but no longer on the menu.Let's face it though, this is Morimoto's. The sushi is probably their claim to fame. Perhaps on my next visit, that would be my food of choice.Additional notes*The staff was very attentive and friendly. They even accommodated my mistake of booking a table on the wrong week. Hilarity!

Poor choice on my part.Salmon entree. Whaaat a disappointment. I forget what the description on the menu said exactly but the dish most definitely did not live up to it. I just remember it mentioning grilled proscuitto & I was sold.

I don't know how to descibe it but it's like smushed hamachi on this wooden harp or something and you get a mini paddle to first scrape some of the fish off and then dip it into one of three dishes of crunchy...balls. I don't know. One of them was masago, I know that.Rock shrimp. Good dipping sauce! You get three diff kinds. I like choices.Didn't have any dessert, like I says, I don't eat sweets. The specialty cocktails were unmemorable cept for the fact that they were tiny.  The drinks took up just over half the martini glass, which I thought was sneaky bc obv they cost like 18 bucks. Stick with a glass of wine or champagne, which is what we did. Anyway, we ate & drank a lot and the bill was over $400.

Skip down to the bottom where it says ""Food."" if that's what you care about.)I had the pleasure of eating lunch here with three lovely ladies, all of whom returned from the bathroom raving. Despite not having to do any business, I had to see this for myself. (I would like to note that it has a sliding door; I pushed and pulled and then waited outside an unoccupied bathroom for longer than I'd care to admit.)Now, I once had a friend call me ""fancy,"" because I insisted he close the door while he ""took the Browns to the Super Bowl."" (Yes, he IS from Texas, how did you know?) But he didn't even know what [bathroom] fancy was, because he's never been to Morimoto.My friends, this is a bathroom unlike any other. The stalls (although calling them such does not do them justice) are magical; you are instantly transported to a peaceful forest, with birds chirping encouragingly. The seat will lower as you walk in, as if it was waiting for you, and only you, to arrive. It will be pleasantly warm when you sit down.There is a panel of buttons on your right. If you press said buttons...let's just say you will experience delights you had previously known only in college, when you got drunk with that girl from St. Louis and things got out of hand. You will most likely giggle.You will not want to get up. I know, because I didn't. I came into Morimoto last Thursday, and I'm still sitting on this toilet, writing this review. My legs are starting to cramp. I don't know if it's day or night, and I'm getting all my news here: yelp.com/topic/new-york-… Please contact my family, and let them know that I'm all right.***Food.For starters, skip the mixed green salad. It was beautiful, but nothing special. Go for the miso soup. If it tasted half as good as it's otherworldly aroma, it is the best...around! Nothing's going to keep it down.The sushi was perfect. With sublime confidence, the waiter encouraged us to order anything we've had anywhere, assuring us that theirs will be better. And he was right. The fish was fresh and plentiful, rolled expertly with the ideal amount of rice. The wasabi melted away into the soy sauce, but both were completely unnecessary because the fish is perfect on its own.The black cod was light and fresh and flavorful. The beef gyudon that I got to try was also very nice, but if you have the choice, the black cod is certainly the winner. I also saw a sashimi salad that looked better than any sashimi salad has ever looked. Ever. It's certainly pricey, but if you have the means, I highly recommend it.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I will say it was a tad bit on the salty side...chugged tons of water afterwards but will definitely be coming back and maybe asking them to go easy on the salt...Advice on splitting bills--which actually applies to any restaurant. If you split a bill and there is a suggested gratuity amount at the bottom of your receipt, it applies to the ENTIRE bill and NOT your portion. Something to keep in mind.

I forget the name, but it was beautifully laid out.  All in all, it was a great dining experience, esp on such a special occasion :)  But I have to admit I am a bigger fan of smaller, more modest establishments.  This place was too ""modernized"" and ""Americanized"" for me.  I would suggest Sasabune on UES for those looking for a more authentic sushi experience.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

For appetizers we had the toro tartare. Very unique and interactive way to eat sushi. The toro came on a wooden palate that we had to scoop off with metal scrapper-like utensils. We could pair the toro caviar mixture with different condiments as well. We also had the whitefish carpaccio which was very delicate, clean, and light. The japanese lobster fritters were good, but not spectacular. For main course my boyfriend ordered the 16oz wagyu NY and I had the sea bass. Both were very good, cooked perfectly....but  these dishes would not be the reason I will be coming back to Morimoto. We also ordered a platter of sashimi that came so late after our main dishes that we were already pretty full. But when they finally brought the food to us we found they were nigiri and not sashimi. We sent the platter back and what returned were generous cuts of fish! I don't know if this is their normal serving portions ( I hope!) but they were soo fresh and delicious! After dinner we ordered desserts, and the manager came to apologize for the sashimi mistake and comped both our desserts! The desserts were fabulous!!! And such a surprise and perfect ending to our amazing meal! My experience with restaurants have usually been....if they are great with the dinner course they are usually weak in the dessert or vice versa.

It was however rather tasteless and have had tastier tartar at lower end places...Duck Duck Duck: I always find myself drawn to duck dishes for some reason and this looked very exciting with three types of it. This is a big plate I couldn't finish it. The croissant part of it tastes exactly like Chinese pork buns (example Momofuku ones) except the bread is croissant and it's duck instead of pork. The fois gras duck leg was delicious and the egg was good but not to-die-for.Wagyu beef carpaccio: Nice wagyu but overly drenched in ginger, salt, vinegar, and cilantro. Summer peach raspberry pudding: Served up in a cup like a tiramisu with cake part on the bottom (would rather have had it all pudding without the spongy stuff). The wine gelee and sorbet that comes with it is nice and refreshing.Cocktail list is short but sweet and the drinks have lovely names like white lily and hydrangea.  One of the cocktails only appears on the dessert menu and has vanilla vodka with apricot and simple syrup and this is priced almost double of the other cocktails for some inexplicable reason... it wasn't as tasty as it sounded either... Service was flawless; the waitress knew every single dish down to the smallest  detail, professionalism to the extreme.

The sushi was fresh and perfectly seasoned also.Most other dishes were average and completely forgettable.And then there was the vegetable fondue. 3 pieces of stale-looking/tasting vegetable in a super salty garlic sauce. Something that I could whip up at home in 5 minutes myself using the stale veggies we have in the fridge.Toban Yaki consisted not so fresh seafood that was grossly overcooked and over salted.The pièce de résistance was the iron chef ramen. It looked like someone took several bites out of it. Soup was campbells chicken broth. The 2 pieces of chicken in the bowl had fork marks in them (WTH??), and the ramen noodles were NOT ramen noodles at all. It were leftover pasta. The decor is very trendy (as in trying too hard to be fashionable) and the service was nice but not as professional as we would have expected for the price point.I really struggled as to what rating to give this restaurant. Considering the price tag of $300 without drinks, I really wanted to give this place a 1 star. However, since there were some enjoyable dishes in there, Morimoto gets 2 stars.

It included uni, sea urchin, which is something I generally avoid whenever I'm in a Japanese restaurant. I never liked the taste of it, it's always too fishy for me and I hate the texture. But the uni sashimi at Morimoto was actually good. I don't know how he managed to make uni good, but he's Morimoto so I guess that makes sense. The Tuna Tartar- recommended by our waiter, who is really nice and super patient as my family doesn't speak very much English so I had to translate what he said to them and translate what my family wanted to say to him, which took a long time. The tuna tartar was really nice, you scrape the tuna up and scrape some side sauce on it and the flavor was just wonderful. It's also kinda fun to eat this dish.The Morimoto Sashimi- I originally saw a picture of this on yelp and I didn't know what it was, I only knew that it looks amazing and that I was going to order it when I go to Morimoto. So I described what I saw to the waiter: It's colorful, looks like little blocks, and has salmon on the first layer, and he knew what I was talking about. It came with little squeezing things with 5 different dipping sauce. It's aesthetically appealing and it melts in your mouth. It's sooo good. We also got this deep fried dish that the waiter recommended but that wasn't the best thing. It was sweet and sour, kinda like sweet and sour chicken but I think it was shrimp. The California Roll+The Soft Shell Crab Roll- average-good.but the DESERTS were AMAZING!!!I forgot the name of this one but it's some caramel ice cream/caramel/nuts, beautiful presentation.Warm Chocolate Cake! with caramel popcorn, japanese dark sugar syrup, rhubarab sauce, and sweet corn ice cream with tons of fresh berries!!- Really sweet but really good. The Sorbet Trio was also really good. minus the basil lime flavor. That one was kind of gross.

Fresh tuna and the sauce drizzled on top cemented the taste. The soft crab roll and spicy tuna roll were the best I've had; both recommendations of our waitress and I see why. The bento box gave me a little taste of heaven. The black cod was to die for, absolutely phenomenal. The salad was not my favorite but the miso soup, sushi and tempura were great....

1527,0_eFWhswRsGaLsOYYBFbrg,Paula M.,2.0 star rating,"We sat down for a no-holds-barred, splurge of a meal. All four of us ordered omakase (chef's choice). In addition, we ordered the black cod to come out with the main course.For drinks, we ordered the Morimotini, White Lily, Hydrangea and an Asahi. The Morimotini said it had wasabi infused vodka, but it just tasted like cucumber vodka. I couldn't taste wasabi at all. The White Lily and Hydrangea were both delicious. The Hydrangea is a super fruity drink and a good option for those who don't like to taste the alcohol.It's hard not to be swayed by the decor and vibe of the restaurant. Very unique use of space. The street level bathroom is standard, but from what I hear, the downstairs bathroom is where you need to go. We were seated on street level close to the sushi bar so we could watch at least six chefs/cooks working non-stop.First course - toro tatare. This is a signature dish and has become a staple of the omakase menu. It comes with a seasoned soy sauce and five dipping options - wasabi, sour cream, kelp paste, avocado paste and Japanese crackers. I can see why this is a popular dish. This definitely set the bar for the courses to come.Second course - lightly seared sashimi of skip jack tuna. It was served with shimeji mushrooms and shiso. This was a pleasant second course and showed a delicate hand.Third course - assortment of vegetables, tempura liver and anchovy miso paste with a drizzle of olive oil. The plating out-shined the food. The miso paste was served in what looked like a scented oil burner. It seemed like a common veggies and dip snack disguised as a fancy dish.Fourth course - Oyster and foie gras with teriyaki jus. A nice hearty one bite dish. A bit overkill on the teriyaki sauce.Fifth course - Assorted nigiri, including chu toro, amber jack, hotate, and cherry trout. All fishes were tasty, but there was a lack of consistency. It seemed each of us got a generous helping of wasabi under at least one of the fishes, but it was under a different fish for each of us!Palette cleanser - homemade ginger ale. Probably one of the better homemade ginger ales I've tasted. A nice treat.Black cod - the cod was perfectly cooked, delicate and flaky. However, the sauce on it was too strong and it killed any natural flavor from the fish.Sixth course - wagyu beef with sweet potato sticks and lobster tail with garam masala. This was the obvious ""main course"" but it was such a let down. The beef was fine, but didn't have much flavor. The sweet potato sticks were super oily. The lobster tail was caked with the garam masala that you didn't taste anything but that spice. The tail was also cooked so much it was dry and tough.Seventh course - tofu cheesecake with apricot (I think) sorbet and sauce and a sesame puff pastry. The cheesecake was very good, even alone without any fruit flavor.I had such high expectations for this place. But the meal as a whole was a disappointment. There were only a few highs and a lot of low points. As an omakase meal, I expect to be wowed with good food, quality over quantity, but it seemed to be a lot of flash with little substance. My recommendation is to order a la carte from the more popular dishes and share with everyone at your table.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

You would think after spending $700.00 for slim people,  you would not be hungry, I was satisfied, but in no way was I full.  The toro tartare was approx 1-2 tablespoons spread super thin on a 3x3 plate with condiments. It was delicious even my mother, who would never ear raw fish loved it but in no way worth the price. My duagters BF loved the Duck Duck Duck, and the Oysters Foie Gras. The Waygu filet was dry and hay-like to me, and the sauce was crazy salty, not at all up to the hype. Still it was a treat to taste the food of an Iron Chef, and it was a special occasion so considering the atmosphere and service we left very pleased. But by no means was this the best meal I ever had. They do not require jacket, nor tie and my daughters BF wore sneakers (albeit they were Prada, but they were still sneakers)  which they did not comment on.

I think that apart from the presentation, the toro tartare is a bit overrated. The tuna pizza was surprisingly good. Tasty and refreshing. For our main dish we had the duck, duck, duck which was pretty good. We also had braised black cod, very tasty. And of course the 20 oz. australian wagyu rib eye. It came in a sizzling plate and the onion and garlic jus was amazing.

If they got that one minor, yet important detail correct it would have been a 5 star experience. Details is what separates the best from the rest, Morimoto! :(1st tasting: Toro tartar was delicious - very fresh and came with little scoops of the following - finely sliced chives, sour cream, wasabi, some sort of soy paste, and crispy rice-ish pellets along with a yummy dipping sauce. This was really good and gave my pallet a little bit of a tease.2nd tasting: Thinly sliced fluke with these tiny mushrooms - this was good too, the sesame oil sauce gave it some saltiness that complimented the fish.3rd tasting: A very pungent oyster foie gras with uni on top. Wasn't a huge fan but I like how it complimented the 2nd tasting.4th tasting: Some sort of anchovy-fishy thick sauce that came with little veggies and a piece of bread. Essentially it was fondue. Fun to eat, after a few bites I thought it was too much sauce.- pallet cleanser was this gingerale with lemon and real ginger drink - very zesty and the perfect 'mouthwash'! -5th tasting: I'm so sad to say that the sushi was no good. The actual sushi was good (5 types, which I forgot) but the rice was a fail. It was hard and didn't melt in my mouth like Yasuda's.6th tasting: The 'surf and turf' - it's basically galbi with sweet potato glazed in honey. The lobster was seasoned with cajun spices. I'm glad this was there, otherwise I would have left hungry.7th tasting: Delicious dessert of some sort, I wish I could point out what it was.

Me being a fan of Morimoto on Iron Chef and all. :D First and foremost, praise must be given to the staff! Everyone was very friendly, attentive, and helpful! And they deserve a shout out and a big thank you! :) The bartender was on point and made a lovely well balanced Cinnamon Cider cocktail. I then had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc with my meal which was incredible! I really picked up on those floral notes. For our meal we had the crispy rock shrimp tempura (hot appetizer) was one of the best things I've eaten in a while. it's a whimsical dish that seems to gain its inspiration from hot wings with blue cheese dip but undoubtedly this is far far far better than that and not nearly as spicy but bursting with flavor instead. the famed toro tartar was lovely and fun to eat just how i imagined. the $45 sushi platter was nice as well. the spicy tuna roll was a bit too spicy for me though; I'm used to a more mild version. I absolutely LOVED that the sushi had a bit of wasabi underneath the fish which saved me the trouble of doing it myself! for entrees my boyfriend had the 20oz Australian Wagyu Rib Eye which I tried and loved! it was cooked perfectly and practically melted like butter in my mouth. I had the Seafood Toban Yaki which was very flavorful and is a surprisingly large dish! The red miso-sake broth was really delicious and complimented the grade A seafood very well. But again it was a bit too fulfilling and spicy for me so i'll try something else next time. Also I'm not a fan of fussing with shells at a nice restaurant lol and unfortunately I was too full for dessert lol. :/ Will return for sure though!

""I will never, ever let work impede on my quality of life.""""Taxis are wasteful.""""I will never, ever smoke cigarettes.""""I hate the Meatpacking District.""I was fumbling for a cigarette as I paid the cabbie, scowling, because I got held up at work and was late for dinner. The High Line was slumbering overhead and saucy Del Posto was sulking across 10th Avenue, when glass doors and red curtains parted, and principle, Parliaments, and prejudices all fell away as I was admitted into a glimmering, lavish dream sequence of a future perfect. I spotted my assigned patron god to this elysian paradise seated at the bar. He turned to greet me -I saw that he'd assumed the snappy form of Chun L. in business formal- as beautiful women floated by to take my coat, pour me water, smile. He led me up to an airy, gleaming dining room where a partition made of the silver-green souls of screenwriters-turned-bond-traders seemed to undulate under a light that was at once soft and bright.My patron god (his body is his temple) genially allowed me a seat with a view of the open kitchen. From here, I observed an effortlessly smart-seeming patronage at the height of their powers: young, rich, elegant, charming, hopeful. No jostling elbows, or spilled food or drink, or outdoor voices. Instead: spacious, gracious laughter, repartee, mild celebration.  I sipped chenin blanc, while we ordered a smorgasbord of giant appetizers to serve as our meal - rock shrimp tempura, Iron Chef ramen, ten-hour-pork over congee, foie gras oysters, and a trio of maki rolls (which, in light of the feast that preceded it, went a little neglected). The oysters (blanched, and served with seared foie gras and a dollop of uni) was the culinary carnation of an orgasm. Food tastes like orgasms here! The rest was tasty and beautiful, if not nearly so special. Following dinner, I ordered several delicious, calpico-sweetened, yuzu-infused cocktails at the bar downstairs - which was clean and gleaming - heaven's afterparty. It soon came time to be spit back out into the grimy, burnt-black world outside Morimoto. When the angel at the entrance handed me my coat, and asked if I'd had a nice evening.

I ate here literally a couple hours after arriving in NYC (my very first visit there, yay!) with my boyfriend and my sister.We ordered:- Rock shrimp tempura: ABSOLUTELY DIVINE. It's light, crisp, and the sauces were super tasty. Probably my favorite part of the meal.- Sea Bass (my dish): Meh. I should've gone with something ""safer"" like the braised black cod so that I wouldn't be disappointed. I dunno, the bass wasn't seasoned enough and I wasn't too impressed with the avocado tempura or japanese eggplant. Small portion, too.- Duck, duck duck (boyfriend's dish): Delicious! Perfectly roasted on a buttery croissant. The bf was happy with his choice!- Roasted ocean trout (sister's dish): Also delicious! The trout was flaky and it came on a bed on what tasted like mashed potatoes but 5x better than mashed potatoes. Maybe it was the truffle they added to it. Very flavorful.- Our dessert was this rose infused mascarpone cheesecake mousse thing with hibiscus gelees and tiny basil madeleines. Yes it was good and it was cool to experience the different layers of flavors... but at the same time, too much going on I think!Overall I was happy I got to eat here, but I don't know if I'll visit again. =X Maybe to try some different dishes?

1560,AG2z5iviQuUTmcJQrrMqRQ,Feroz H.,5.0 star rating,"OK, Please remember this place is 4 dollar signs. I went here for my friends birthday party. We had a group of 9 people. We had a few of the cocktails before we got seated. The cocktail menu is small as expected but has a great selection that you probably wont find at another restaurant or bar, which is unique. The appetizers we got were toro tartare. I'm not really sure what it was supposed to be like, but it had a very nice presentation. The dish itself was very small. My friend and I were confused as how to eat it, but we managed and it was rather bland in my opinion.  We also got the lobster fritters which tasted really good. Again the portions were a decent size. After appetizers, we had our main course. The prices vary depending on which entree you chose. I got a rib eye since i love steak. It was seasoned very well and the size, again, was a decent portion, not really big, but not really small. The staff was very attentive to our table even though the place was very busy. my glass of water was full all the time and if i ran low on a cocktail someone was there to receive another order, which is nice to see. After dinner, we got dessert of course since it had a nice menu. Plus, I couldn't pass up tofu cheesecake, which was amazing. I had the trio of tofu cheesecake, tofu souffle, and maple ice cream with maple syrup, again, a decent amount, and enjoyed it. Overall, I had expected the restaurant to be very expensive and the portions to be very small. I had a really good experience here and would definitely recommend all of my friends to come here.

1561,SYLbblR1BLLcFECk0w2QqQ,Steve W.,4.0 star rating,"We went to Morimoto on New Year's Eve this past year (12/31/09) and really enjoyed ourselves. We arrived at 7:45 for our 8:15 dinner and figured we'd just go down to the bar but instead, our table was ready and we were seated immediately. Had a great view of the open-air kitchen as well as the glass-bottle wall. Really a beautiful contemporary design throughout the entire restaurant. We had decided to go with the omakase since we had never been to the restaurant before. I'm writing this review almost a month after the meal so forgive my light descriptions as I unfortunately don't remember every single detail.  We did order a bottle of cold, unfiltered sake which was also delicious. On top of that, the waiter came around with a complimentary glass of champagne. Nice touch, if a bit expected.New Year's Eve Omakase:1) Morimoto Bagel: House baked bagel with yellowtail pastrami and a green aioli. For a bunch of jews, this was an unexpected way to start out our evening and helped to get us into the mood for the rest of the evening. The bagel was probably the size of a lenders or so and soft and doughy. Pastrami'd yellowtail was delicious and a nice twist.2) Toro Tartare: Simply put, outstanding. I won't go into much detail on this one because everyone on this site has something to say about it. All I will say is that I found a new taste with every bite and never a dull one.3) Salad course: Red Snapper with light yuzu sauce and micro-greens. The 2-3 bites of fish were cooked perfectly. Nothing too exciting here but tasty none-the-less.4) Beef Wagyu: 5 silver-dollar size pieces of Beef Wagyu topped with hot oils, scallions and an Asian sauce I wish I could describe. Meat was extremely succulent and flavorful despite being not that big. Could have eaten just 20-30 pieces of this as my meal and been fat-tastically satisfied. If you come to Morimoto (or Nobu or any similar place for that matter), try the wagyu. So delicious.5) One piece of bigeye tuna sushi with beef consume: This one was a bit of a head scratch-er at first as I didn't really see how the tuna and beef consume were supposed to go together. The piece of sushi was a part of a roll that was put together in the shape of a square, with cube cut cucumbers in each corner, a diamond of the tuna in the middle, half inch long pieces of cucumber coming out of the diamond and rice filled the rest. Beautiful presentation no doubt, wish I had taken a picture of it. But the taste wasn't really anything to write home about.  I tried dipping it into the beef broth as the server suggested but that didn't really help. The only real miss of the night for me.6) Crab Ravioli: Solid if unspectacular. What you expect from a ravioli filled with crab. 7) Half-Lobster with Lemon Yogurt/whipped cream: Cajun-spiced (didn't see that one coming did you) half lobster came with body and one large claw of the lobster. Meat was tender and succulent. I don't know if it was a yogurt or a whipped cream, but it was heavier than a whipped cream and lighter than a yogurt. Either way, delicious. A nice departure from the lemon wedge squeeze with just enough lemon taste as to not offend. 8) Quarter-inch tall, half-inch wide, 6 inch long piece of Cheesecake, topped with 4 strawberries with raspberry sorbet and strawberry pop rocks on the side: Think of the cheesecake as the size of a ruler topped with strawberries, best way to describe it.  Sorbet was bursting with flavor. And when you ate the pop rocks with the strawberry and cheesecake and sorbet all together it was almost like drinking strawberry champagne as the pop rocks gave off that effervescent feel to it. Delicious all the way through. Even after 7 courses prior we still both ate our entire portions here. One thing to note is while you're there, definitely check out the bathrooms after a few drinks. Trust.  You'll stand in the stall laughing to yourself for at least 2.5 minutes. Another thing I wanted to point out to people that have written reviews already regarding the prices. It's expensive.  There is no question that this restaurant is overpriced and not for those looking for a cheap/quick meal. You're paying as much for the food as you are for the name on the menu. However, in my opinion, the price is always secondary to the flavor. You got to a restaurant to have an experience and to eat some (hopefully) delicious food. To that end, there is no question that what you pay for is what you get. Delicious food prepared elegantly in a setting that will wow even the most chilled of hearts.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Ok, now, the food. I was so utterly disappointed with my ""Kobe Beef Lunchbox""!  I felt deceived when my order arrived, I was like, ""where's my kobe beef??"" If anyone had seen it, I doubt he'll think it's ""Kobe Beef lunchbox"", because the beef itself was served almost like a side dish hiding in the shadow of tempura and sushi taking majority of the bento box space(check out the picture I uploaded)!  Isnt' Kobe Beef supposed to be the main thing?? Otherwise it should simply be called ""combination lunchbox""! Sushi and tempura were fabulous, 5 stars. However, Kobe Beef dish was incredibly mediocre that I was not only disappointed, but I felt ANGRY! They completely distroyed the quality and the flavor of Kobe Beef by cooking in overwhelmingly strong flavor soy-sauce based sauce that they might as well use any type of beef! Worse yet, they sliced it so thinly that I couldn't even tell if it's authentic Kobe beef or not. It was so pointless to use Kobe Beef for such mediocre flavor dish, what a waste!! It should have been served as beef tataki to preserve its quality. I hope you are reading this, Mr Morimoto!!!! If you are the ""Iron Chef"", how could you possibly serve such an uninspired and unremarkable Kobe beef?? This is so unacceptable! I would've overlooked it if it was cheaper and was made by someone unknown, or maybe he underestimated the gastronomic intelligence of fancy anorexic Meat Packing District people, he probably thought he could get away with it....NOT!!  Anyways, the moral of the story: Don't believe the hype.

The first time I took my boyfriend here for his 23rd birthday dinner; the second time we went for NYE 2009. As a side note, I love the semicircle entrance shape of this place with its red curtains arranged across it. Very unique for a NYC restaurant!For the boy's birthday, I had written it into my reservation just as a note that it was his special day and they were sooooo nice when we arrived saying ""Oh it's the birthday boy! Happy birthday!"" They even gave him a special dessert at the end for free that said happy birthday on it in chocolate sauce. Totally did not expect that kind of hospitality from them which was such a lovely touch to our evening. We both ordered the Omakase which we enjoyed for the most part very much. I think our least favorite dish was the main entree (which consisted of a spicy lobster cut in half that came with cream on the side... spice was wayyy too overpowering) but all the appetizers leading up to it were phenomenal. We started off with this tuna tartar that had been smoothed onto a small wooden board planted in a bed of ice with a wooden spoon planted next to it. Uh ok, I've never eaten tartar like this before. Easily one of the best (and most creative) dishes of the evening. Another dish that stood out in my mind was the marinated tilefish sashimi. Dayyyyuuummm did that make my tastebuds sing! There was a full on Italian opera going on in mouth. The sushi course was alright... it didn't meet up to my salmon expectations (I have very high standards for salmon) but the toro was incredible. Also tried the kanpachi as this is also a big favorite of mine but I found it to be a little chewy. This meal also led me to discover my favorite dessert champagne in the entire world, Moscata d'Asti! It's crisp, fruity and it's Italian. I think I may have to serve this bubbly at my eventual goomba wedding!For NYE we came here specifically to try the fugu since Morimoto was one of the few places in the states that serves blowfish.... at least legally. We were glad that Morimoto did not require the NYE special omakase for the night when we made our reservations. I hate it when places do that... It's like no, I don't feel like being forced to pay over $200 for your special 7 course NYE meal, thanks. Props to them for that. Also, Morimoto himself was there chatting with patrons and drinking some bubbly. That was cool. I wish I had taken a picture with him... also wish I had taken a picture inside the restaurant (it's huge) and its famously beautiful downstairs bathrooms... oh well, c'est la vie. We ordered the Fugu platter (it had been flown in from Japan the day before apparently) which consisted of some sashimi cuts, skin and ""Kentucky Fried Fugu"" pieces. I thought the sashimi left a little to be desired but the skin and KFF were both excellent. One day I will have fresh off the boat fugu sashimi served to me in Japan!! It will happen!!

1580,cx2eSh9J4plPXTWn-KOg7g,Howard C.,4.0 star rating,"I came to Morimoto as a little splurge on my birthday. While waiting for my party to arrive, I was escorted downstairs to their bar/lounge area. While waiting downstairs, you are overwhelmed by this pretentious need to purchase a drink as soon as possible. Careful of not being the standout, I ordered 2 drinks; one of which was a little alcohol heavy and pretty uneventful, while the other provided an unimaginable experience. The latter, which Morimoto terms the ""white lilly"" is a sweet concoction that would instantly send alcoholics back into rehab. But I came to Morimoto for their food and not their drinks.As we made our way upstairs, the more refined and minimalistic decor of the restaurant always reminded me that I was not at my local sushi-bar and just plainly ordering a California roll would give me some disdainful glares. However, not intimidated, I decided to look over their extensive menu. Since I am not a big seafood eater (actually I do not eat seafood at all), I chose not to go with the omakase and opted to pick my own meal.Toro Tartare - Excellent, Excellent, Excellent.. and once more.. Excellent! Truly a different experience from your every day dining. The toro is minced very finely a placed in a wooden slab. It is paired with caviar and a dish with 6 different sauces/condiments over ice. Morimoto Sashimi - The server presented the Sashimi, still boxed in its wooden cage. He then went on to reveal the layers of the sashimi: seared toro, salmon, hamachi, tuna and eel. Each piece of the sashimi also comes with its own topping and is served with 5 pipettes containing 5 different sauces. Udon - This dish was unappealing and I probably would have been better not ordering it. It contains 3 different chilled udons, served with fresh grated ginger, wasabi, scallions, seasame, shiso in basically a soba sauce. Maybe it was because I didn't eat it immediately, but the soba noodles were all stuck together, which gave it a very unappetizing feeling. Again, the sauce and noodles were a little disappointing and nothing unique.Wagyu Sushi - After learning that the sushi pricing was per piece and not the usual per two, I went on to order 4 orders of the Wagyu Sushi at $8/piece. And my God, I was definitely sent to heaven. Each strip of wagyu was perfectly seasoned and seared; the rice which accompanied each slice was also perfectly cooked and had that exact sushi rice taste, which brought out the flavor of the wagyu. This was definitely one of the best dishes I have ever experienced in my life.Morimoto Imperial Pilsner - a hidden gem within all the delectable dishes was the beer at Morimoto. Although, I also tried the Hazelnut Ale, the Pilsner was by far superior. Each Pilsner (unlike the Ale) is served in a beautiful ceramic bottle (which you can keep) and its own glass. The beer itself had a smooth crisp clean taste, that I now expect in all my beers.Tofu ""Hot and Cold"" - A soy maple ice cream which was a perfect pairing to the warm soy bean souffle. The souffle had a grand texture and the ice cream definitely accentuated the soy taste in the dish. And third, the dish is served with a tofu cheesecake, which was silky smooth (like tofu) and a flavor that was not overly sweet with a subtle touch of soy. Overall, Morimoto was a spectacular restaurant that I would definitely recommend and hope to visit again. Each dish is served and perfectly explained iron-chef style table side. I would've gave it 5 stars if Morimoto himself were there, but it didn't really hit that 5 star spot since I already had a high expectation entering.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The first thing that struck me was the ambiance. I was impressed by the sheer size of their venue and I loved their decor, which was simple yet trendy and refined. The wait staff were quite friendly and attentive to our needs too.As for the food, I must admit that I was a bit disappointed, partly because I had super-high expectations of this place after watching hours of Iron Chef and partly because I'm a hardcore fan of authentic Japanese food. That being said, you should be aware that Morimoto's food is quite Americanized. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's just that I wasn't quite aware of how Americanized this place was supposed to be before I visited.Nevertheless, our dining experience at Morimoto was quite satisfying overall. First, we ordered the famous crispy rock shrimp tempura, which was my favorite dish of the day. It is served with two kinds of small shrimp tempuras: one is marinated with wasabi-mayo sauce, and the other with spicy pepper paste. They were absolutely delicious! The tempura is super crispy and both sauces go very well with it. For the main dish, we ordered assorted sushi, black cod and seafood toban yaki. The sushi was really fresh and it melted in my mouth. I had low expectations of their sushi since it's not a sushi specialty place, but I was pleasantly surprised by its quality. It might not be as good as the sushi from 15 east or Sushi Azabu, but it was still worth the price. The black cod was my favorite entree. It was perfectly cooked and the miso sauce was delicious. The tobanyaki was my least favorite, because while the seafood was fresh and delicious, the sauce had too much of a buttery taste.Overall, I recommend Morimoto to all of you who want a fine dining experience complete with delicious food that are moderately priced, attentive service and great ambiance.

Next time however, I would like to try to tuna tartar. Also, between the sea bass and the salmon, it is definitely hard to decide. If you are looking for something heavy and creamy then go with the sea bass, if not, then I guess the salmon. We ended our meal with three flavors of sorbet, guava, basil lime, and raspberry wasabi. The most interesting one was the raspberry wasabi. The sweetness from the raspberry somehow complements the wasabi taste very well. It was a very pleasant surprise because it was mild and not over powering. On the other hand, the basil lime was very strong. After the first bite, any bite after is like a kick in the face.

And they did.For restaurant week they offered a bento box meal with salad, miso soup, nigiri and maki rolls, vegetable tempura and the main item which was either wygu beef, black cod or a vegetable. The tempura was so light you cant believe it. My black cod was perfectly cooked and delicious. This was great. However... I ended up ordering more dishes because their menu compels you to. I have never seen lamb carpaccio on a menu but Morimoto's got it and it was fantastic. Our group had both the lamb and beef carpaccio and the herbs, salt and oil on both made them really something to remember.We were there with another restauranteur and spent a lot of time admiring the beautiful kitchen and sushi bar.

Gorgeous decor, great service, wonderful flavors, artful plate presentations...but did not achieve a 5-star rating because of the following:1. The sushi was absolutely non-descript, tasteless, and boring. This is not what I expect from a restaurant of an Iron Chef. It's a little scary when the most enjoyable part of the sushi is the pickled ginger. :(2. We were still hungry after the dinner. All though we were served about 10 courses, each were miniscule. My husband and I are not obese, but we're also not size 0's. We certainly did not expect to have to eat sandwiches and Mac 'n Cheese, after dinner, to be full. :(This is a lovely place to have a dinner. Just don't be surprised if you have to still eat a 2nd dinner after leaving the restaurant. As others have said, don't bother with the sushi. :(If you're there for dinner, ask for Juan.

The entrance may be grand with flowing red curtains (think Moulin Rouge theater curtains with a Japanese flair) but there is no large type overhead saying ""Morimoto's."" You have to look off to the left side of the entrance, several inches above the ground to see the chef's name in red logotype. You enter the automatic sliding doors like boarding the Enterprise and are welcomed by young, model-looking greeters by the desk. Beautiful men and women make me feel very uneasy because I feel like I'm in Gattaca and I feel unclean and of poor breed. I'm sure they're looking at me with their ""You're not worthy of Uma Thurman"" gaze.""Hello sir, do you have a reservation with us?"" asked by an Armani-model/maitre d.""Yes, I do.""""Party of three sir? Very good. You are the first to arrive so you are welcome to have a drink at our bar which is located below, just down these stairs. We'll direct your friends downstairs when they arrive."" A lovely hostess, who might as well of been Adriana Lima's younger sister, showed me the stairs to the electric blue-lit glass bar. I was amazed by the bar itself, completely made of glass or lucite or some clear s*** with floating leaves etched inside the solid block.I knew that with my suit, I needed a martini (damnit Casino Royale! I hate when awesome movies influence my life decisions!) so I ordered a Morimotini. As you can guess everything here has been Morimotified up the a** so please refrain from smirking when I make some Morimotisms in the next couple paragraphs. Anyway, the Morimotini is a mixture of wasabi-infused vodka and sake. How badass is that? Well as martinis go it was pretty good. Worth the $14? Probably not, but hey. When in Rome...Once my friends arrived we were ready for gastronomic battle. The super upbeat Asian waitress was very eager to answer any of our questions and described the variety of awesome shit on the menu. The three of us ended up choosing the ""Morimoto Omakase,"" which was the chef's choice of seven course tastings, allowing you to experience a wide array of flavors.The night started with a tuna tartar, presented on a small plank of wood with caviar, creme fraiche, wasabi, dashi-soy, chives, guacomole, and tiny crackers. It was interesting because you have to use this chisel-shaped spoon to scrape the tuna off the board. It was a strange experience thinking of carpentry and painting skills while eating tuna, but hey it tasted good.Next up was a whitefish carpaccio with cherry tomatoes and a soy sauce-infused olive oil. What? Soy sauce-infused olive oil? Can I just buy that s*** in a bottle and pour it into my gullet?! I want more!Third course was yellowtail medallions in salsa and greens. Crunchy, sea salty skin was the epic win of this dish.Fourth course was...ahem, let me put on my distinguished, snooty British-voice: ""Oyster foie gras. A delightful dish consisting of top of the line market oyster, foie gras, uni and a refined teriyaki sauce."" Did anybody else get a food boner after reading that?Fifth dish was a series of chef selected sushi, which was a combination of tuna, red snapper, mackerel, bass, and eel. Is that a lime slice garnish on that piece of fish? Is red snapper the Coronas of Japanese sushi?Sixth dish was a refresher to cleanse the palate. This shot was a fruity, frothy, spicy concoction. Think of cranberry juice, brandy, and peppers mixed in together. It was like a shot of Christmas.Seventh dish was the main course: surf and turf. This was a gorgeous spicy half lobster and a side of flank steak. Lobster has to be the least sexy meal to have. I felt like Daryl Hannah in that lobster eating scene in Splash. ""She's really hungry"" as Tom Hanks would say while I devoured the crustacean like a Mori-mo-fo.And finally the last dish, the 8th course of the meal: dessert. This consisted of a powdered sugar cake with a mango sorbet and caramelized apples. There was this ridiculous marshmallow smear coating at the bottom of the plate which was impossible to scrape and add to the sorbet. Maybe it was there for show? Maybe you were only supposed to get subtle hints of marshmallow? And thus concluded our evening at Morimoto's. The chipper waitress handed us our check which ended up being about $500 then with a 20% tip, the night pretty much rounded to about $200 each person.It was the Taco Bell dollar menu from here on out.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We were a bit apprehensive since we were not sure about the gaminess of the lamb but our server reassured us of it ... we also had a spicy yellowtail roll and this time did a better job with the chopsticks :)For entrees we went with the signature angry chicken with spicy chicken jus .. we ordered some extra jus since we felt the chicken was on the drier side .. We also went with the sea bass with sweet sake kasu, japanese eggplant, miso but we were disappointed with the cloying sweetness of this dish ... For dessert we had the Crème de Chocolate, Caramel Almonds, Caramel Apricot Sauce, Almond Foam, Praline, and Caramel Ice Cream. It certainly was not the most memorable dessert we've ever tasted but good nonetheless ...The best part of the experience was the futuristic toilet downstairs which took me by surprise .. piece of art!!! wish all the food lived upto its hype as well ..",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We ordered some appetizers and main courses to share. Toro Tartare, Tuna Pizza and Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura the best!For the main course, Surf & Turf (spectacular!) and the duck, duck and duck (amazing!).Great place for a romantic dinner or for to go with a group of friends.Ah! Almost forget! The best cocktail that I ever have: the highland (or highlander). It is a combination of Tequila Reposado, Sauvignon Blanc, Lemon and Japanese Pepper. Just ask for it! You will never forget it.To finish, warm chocolate cake. It is a combination of flour less chocolate cake, green tea-pear ice cream.

How interactive! So good as it melts in your mouth.Tuna pizza, a must! This was excellent and so fresh.We had some kind of lobster ravioli and that was divine.For main dishes, we had duck, duck, duck.  Wow, this was one of my favorite meals,  Love the fattiness and this too melts in your mouth with each taste. The egg adds to a nice dipping sauce for the croissantIshi yaki bop is similar to bibimbap, its cooked table side and if you are lucky the guy is totally hot.. the yellowtail tuna is cooked right in the extremely hot stone bowl and compliments the rice with the spicy seaweed flavor excellently.The trout was soo flaky and awesome.We also ordered a sushi/sashimi combo plate and it was all so fresh and delicious.We got the surf and turf and it was good but the dish didn't really stand out as the other plates did.We were all full but we HAD to order dessert.  We ordered the mascapone strawberry cheesecake which was Morimoto's interpretation.  It was fabulous! The berries were fresh and the best cheesecake ever.  We also order the hot and cold tofu which came with maple ice cream and soufflé. It was very good when mixed all the ingredients together.The décor is very elegant yet simple.  We spent close to 700 and that included tip.  But it was all worth it.  I need to come here again and soon.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

1607,-YInLc8wibXjo_wIz9HDtg,Wendy Y.,2.0 star rating,"First of all, I want to clarify that I'm Asian (Chinese) and I went with my brother and Chinese friend. We are all used to Asian food (tasty but not overly salty). By no means, we don't like bland food - the right combination is the art of food. :)I was really excited about going to Morimoto's (celebrity chef and I'm a fan of the Food Network) and wanted to try Morimoto's restaurant. I've read the reviews and thought it was for me and my friends. I've read one Yelper mentioned that Morimoto's Iced Tea was great (which I agreed & was the best part of my meal). We ordered the Tempura Shrimp, Claim Miso Soups, Ramen Soup (Chicken Noodle Soup), Seafood 'toban yaki', a Trout dish (I can't quite remember the name), wagyu beef sashimi. We were recommended by the waitress the Tempura Shrimp (which she raves that it was delicious). My friend and I thought it was over breaded. The soups was so SALTY! The clam was big in the Clam Miso Soup but you couldn't really taste the sweetness of the clam. My brother snuck some water into his ramen soup and he said that had tone down the salt! We were both not very impress by our meals. My friend's seafood 'to ban yaki' looked ok. It had shrimp with the heads (which we generally love), half of a lobster, some crab legs, scallops. I thought the crab leg was okay but I think if you're wanting to be wow by the seafood, you may have better luck with a restaurant that is by the waterfront that knows how to cook their seafood. The trout dish was a sear dish. It was too fishy for me.You're probably wondering why I ordered the fish dish when I didn't care for the fishy taste. But I've had fish dishes that are not so overpowering in their fish taste. The trout reminded me of Salmon. I took a couple bites of it and was done. My friend told me to eat a couple more bites (which I did) to avoid being rude. LOL. But I didn't like it. And I did feel bad. I hate to waste food and waste money. This may also be just me but I wasn't too impress by our waitress. She was nice but I felt that she was somewhat snotty (lack of a better word). We're in our late 20s (my brother is in his early 20s) so maybe, she didn't think she was going to get tip well? My friend thought the same but my brother did not. The manager made his presence at our table (approved the professionalism there).  It's definitely a classy restaurant (love the decor and the bathroom). I gave one star for the food and one star for the decor. When the waitress asked if we want dessert, we kindly declined (I didn't want to spent any more money on food that I would be disappointed at). I don't mind spending money on excellent food. But our food was not excellent. Hindsight is 20/20. If you asked me if I would go back, I would not.  If I didn't go, I would always wonder how good Morimoto's restaurant is. Oh well. Now that I've went, I know that it's nothing to rave about. I really wished that I would have loved this place. :-( And really - all people is different so I wish better luck to you and you visit!To give you an idea of what I've had to give you a gage of my taste: I thought Mesa Grill was okay - would give it a 3 star, Cactus Club Cafe (food was okay but love the atmosphere - almost reminds me of Morimoto).  Love Love Love seafood in Sai Kung.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Terrific ambiance and energy. Unfortunately, after taking my sake order, my waitress disappeared for nearly 20 minutes and I had to flag another waitress to order dinner. She suggested the ""pizza"" appetizer, which was delightful. There was a mix up in my order and I received a tuna roll instead of a spicy tuna roll, so I sent it back.  More unfortunately, the original waitress came by, plate in hand, and informed me that I was mistaken and that it was indeed a spicy tuna roll, and offered to bring me a ramekin of spicy mayo. Morimoto is too high end a restaurant to first not acknowledge a simple error, and then offer ""do it yourself sushi"" as a remedy.  I requested a spicy tuna roll.  The second waitress returned with the plate and, having actually looked at the roll, acknowledged that it was not a spicy tuna roll.  As it turned out, the second waitress was actually the manager, Minkyong Choi. As before, her customer service was impeccable, and she ended up comping the roll (an unnecessary but appreciated gesture). Just an aside, the spicy tuna roll was wonderful. Had Ms. Choi been my actual waitress, my rating would have been a 5. Without her, it would have been a 2.

I think they need to step up their game a little bit. While the food was good, I just found the overall experience to be slightly meh- the decor, tired (reminded me of Asia de Cuba; kinda '90s), the music, cheesy (Outkast's ""Hey Ya""), and the food, tasty but uninspired. Highlights of the meal included friendly service in the lounge for a pre-dinner drink, a reasonably priced wine list, the octopus carpaccio, and the expertly cooked steak on the surf and turf.  No complaints about any of the dishes, but I did expect a little more ingenuity. It's nice that they still offer old standbys like the crispy rock shrimp, but for an Iron Chef, I want to be wowed. I did think the yellowtail bibimbap prepared tableside was pretty cool, though.

My favorite appetizers: rock shrimp tempura (in 2 different sauces: wasabi and korean spiced) and the beef carpaccio (it melts in your mouth good). Still the best entree on the menu is the buri bop. It's a work of art how the waiter cooks the hamachi on the stone bowl and mixes the raw egg yolk into the rice. It looks so beautiful!My favorite experience is the way the staff treats each customer. The manager, James, came by again and brought complimentary wine to my table as I was celebrating my bf's bday. At the end of the meal, we also received a complimentary bday dessert. How sweettttt!

I'd recommend starting with a drink at the downstairs bar for sure. Must have:- Tuna Tartar- Spider- Dynamite rolls- Morimoto sashimi- Five-layer towers of sashimi (which comes with colorful sauces in tiny squeeze tubes that are easily discarded for fresh wasabi)Don't forget to check out their innovative bathroom downstairs.

As for this restaurant, I really wanted to like it... I really did, as I am a bit bias and give full support to other Nihionjin (Japanese ppl) in the US.  So I chose Morimoto's to take some of my business clients for lunch.  They did not have much experience eating Japanese food so they ended up ordering what I did, which was the Chirashi-don (Chirashi rice bowl).  The Chirashi was definitely ""elaborate"", with LOTS of fish, but it wasn't done with much class.  Similar to many other things in Japanese culture, ""less is more.""  (For those who want to understand that better, watch Jiro Dreams of Sushi)  After having a OK experience eating the Chirashi, the experience three four hours later was NOT OK!  My clients, and myself all had a bad case of food poisoning.  Thereafter, my clients were running to the bathroom during the meetings we had.  I was starting to fever, and nausea was taking over my concentration.  Eventually, I had to cancel the rest of my meetings to go home.  Upon getting home, I decided to call Morimoto to let them know that the fish they were using had gone bad.  I just wanted to make sure that they do not serve the same fish to other customers.  I really did not want to put in a formal complaint.  Upon speaking to the Manager, to my surprise, he told me that he could not do anything, nor look into the situation unless I put in a formal complaint.  REALLY?!?  As a Manager, is it not your duty to go to the chef to check on the fish you are serving!I am not sure how many others got food poisoning from Morimoto that day.  I would say three people (including myself) eating the Chirashi and getting food poisoning is enough probability to at least do an investigation.  According to the Manager, his exact words were, ""I am sorry you're not feeling well, but we are unable to look into the situation unless there is a formal complaint.""  Did I put a formal complaint on the restaurant?  The answer is ""no"" since I am not looking to shut the place down.  I am sure the kitchens are clean, and the restaurant follows the health and food regulation codes.  All I wanted to do was to just let them know that they had a fish that had gone bad.  To be fair, I really thought I would be helping them by making the phone call despite my state of being at the time.  I am not sure whether it's Masaharu Morimoto's lack of training on his employees, but the Manager should have looked into the situation.  Maybe it's time Morimoto spends a bit more time at his restaurants to check for quality/service rather than making his debut in Hollywood on Hawaii Five-O.

I came here really dressed up and ready to try and enjoy their famous Morimoto omakase.  Let's just say, it was just a fun eat. It was disappointing. The presentation was very unique, with all sorts of dishes yet foreign to my taste buds coming out one after another. As for the taste? I don't know if anything was worth remembering. In fact, I don't even recall what it tasted like even by looking at the pictures I took. Also, for a formal restaurant, the table set-up could have been better given its spacious interior.  It looks like a set-up of a Buffet-style restaurant-  the tables are too close together and spread randomly throughout the restaurant, providing no privacy for a couple. I think my table was stuck near the stairs next to the sushi bar.  Random.Anyway, this place is something you should try at least once given that it IS the famous Morimoto's restaurant.  I don't know if I'll ever return though, since good Japanese restaurants are of abundance in Manhattan.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Served in a tray with little mini paddles to scoop up, and complemented with six different condiments, along with soy sauce.  And of course, caviar.  Next, we had the oyster foie gras.  I mean, what could be more heavenly than to marry two of my most favorite things on earth, right?  And to top it with uni and teriyaki sauce, clever.  Now, the oyster was very fresh and the foie gras was great.  I could have done with a little less teriyaki, which seemed to overpower the oyster and foie gras.  And finally, lobster fritters.  We figured, lobster?  Fritter?  Done.  This dish however was sent in late as they took longer to prepare.  Honestly, my least favorite.  Yes there was lobster.  Yes, it was ok.  But just ok for Morimoto won't cut it.Ok...main course time.  I got the so called ""duck duck duck"".  Very crispy duck, with a serving of leg, cutlets on top of a croissant, complimented with three sauces.  It was very good.  Now, although I do like my duck crispy, it was a bit dry.  My brother ordered the surf and turf, which came with Wagyu beef (medium, but looked more like medium rare) with a hamachi ribbon salad.  The beef was amazingly tender (but how could it not be for kobe beef) and very tasty.  By that time, I was stuffed.  Now you wonder, why three stars?  Well, although the dishes were good, they were not spectacular.  I felt they were a bit overly done, and I primarily focus on the taste of the dishes.  Again, I am not a sucker for ambiance most of the time.  But if that were the case, I would have given them a five star rating.  Very clean and modern.  Perfect lighting for a private dinner either for a date or with friends and family.Would I go back?  Absolutely.  there are many other dishes I want to try.  Maybe next time I would be more inclined to give them a higher rating!  Let's see what else is in store la prochaine fois!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I've always wanted to dine at Morimoto since I am a huge fan of the Iron Chef. However, after a less than satisfactory experience at Nobu, I had my doubts. Nonetheless, after reading several negative reviews on Yelp, I decided that I wanted to come to a verdict on my own.Toro tartare: plating was gorgeous; however, the dish itself is completely overrated to say the least. The only reason it's accompanied by the plethora of sauces is so you can't taste how mediocre and bland the toro is. If you enjoy paying $35 in order to play with your food, then by all means go for it. Wagyu beef bento box : Besides the nigiri sushi,everything including the wagyu beef were placed in white ceramic bowls, which made it very difficult to cut the the beef. The beef was tasty but was it really ""wagyu""....i seriously doubt it. Nigiri sushi and miso soup were standard, while the veggie tempura were overly greasy and the salad was nothing but a mess of wilted greens and fried onions. The only highlight of the bento box was the dessert, Mandarin Panna Cotta. The fresh berries and tangy syrup really balanced out the creaminess of the panna cotta.My own verdict: Heated toilet seats are totally not worth $45.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Mediocre food at super high prices. I knew the prices were high, but I assumed the food would be much better...and it was just good, but not great. I decided to split a few dishes with my boyfriend, while my parents and sister + her boyfriend ordered other things, so we could all try a bit of everything! Started with the Toro Tartar, which other Yelpers rave about, was tasty, but the portion was so small--and for 30 bucks!?! I thought it was outrageous. It wasn't like it was anything sooo special, anyway. Then, had the Beef Carpaccio, which was also nothing special. It was good, but again, not anything remarkable. For our main course, we had the Ishi Yaki Bop, which they cook in front of you. It was very tasty.  A bowl of rice, with vegetables, like mushrooms, and then an egg mixed in with Yellowtail. It was very good... my boyfriend and I liked it very much. However, I've ordered a very similar dish at Korean restaurants and it's been just as good-perhaps tastier,even...and less expensive. My mother ordered the Duck Duck Duck, which I sampled, and also thought was simply run of the mill. My sister had a ramen noodle soup, which I did not try, but she said it was quite good. My father had a fish dish, which he also said was very good. The service was decent-nothing outstanding-but nothing terrible. The 6 of us agreed that you pay for the beautiful decor at this chic & trendy Meatpicking district hideaway...You pay for the name Morimoto...not the food...The food is sub-par. Go to Japan to eat---I promise you, the food's much better at any hole in the wall you'll find down a Tokyo or Osaka alley than this overpriced superficial crap.  If only Morimoto had actually cooked everything, then perhaps, it would have been a different story........... hands down, THE MOST EXCITING AND AWESOME PART OF THIS RESTAURANT WAS THE BATHROOM--because they have high tech, Japanese style toilets like the ones all across Japan that I miss terribly!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Usually I am accustomed to the usually cheap and fast service of Japanese joints around the Saint Marks Areas, so I decided to try out the higher end of the spectrum of Japanese cuisine. No better a time than Restaurant Week!I brought a date and made reservations for lunch at Morimoto's, located in the Meatpacking District near the Chelsea Market (also a good place to take your date to walk around afterwards.) They let people in at 12 noon at the dot, and check your reservation and seat you to a table. The place by far is probably one of the best decorated and beautiful restaurants I have seen in NYC. So, this is a great place to take a date to for a good first impression. The service was top notch and always catered to your needs. But, lets move on the food!Other the than pre-fixed restaurant menu, I ordered the signature appetizer that Morimoto's is famous for, the Toro Taretare. They take the best and fattiest part of the tuna and ground it up and you can dip in various arrangement of sauces, while served on a nicely decorated bowl of ice. If one thing Morimoto does well, it is their presentation. For $28, you definitely get goddamn high quality tuna and this dish is it! It is a must if you want to get the full experience from this place. Next to the entrees.Me and my date had bento boxes, one Wagyu beef and Braised Black Cod. The Bento boxes come with a nice arugula salad , miso soup, vegetable tempura w/ a nice mayo-based sauce, Sushi/ sashimi platter, and a small portion of the ordered entree. It was a nice variety of Japanese dishes in a box, for the affordable price of $25 since its Restaurant week. I must say the sushi definitely stuck out the most of the box, and the wagyu beef was very juicy especially with the provided sauce. The cod was also very juicy and crisp, and so soft that you can cut it with a spoon. Overall, this was an amazing fine dining experience for me and my date. For dessert, we had a nice fresh fruit panna cotta, which was the cherry on top essentially for the meal. The bill came out to be about $95 including tax and tip, which is not bad considering how much it would be on a regular day.

The recent dinner I had totally made up for it. The wait staff was friendly and the decor was nice, although the communal tables were too tightly packed - getting in and out was a bit annoying. I had gotten the omakase, which, while pricey, was excellent. It's seven small dishes, but filling (to me anyway). The Morimoto iced tea was great - very citrusy and sweet, and very aromatic.The steamed oyster with foie gras and uni was one of the best dishes. I was a bit skeptical, as I don't usually like my oysters cooked, but it was delicious. The other was the surf and turf - lobster in a spicy seasoning and a piece of Wagyu beef. Both were perfectly cooked and tasted amazing - especially the Wagyu. Because I love lobster, I ate that one first (in case I got full and wasn't able to finish the dish). But then I had the Wagyu, and it just blew my mind.There was fluke in sesame oil (and other things), which were also good. As was the first dish, which was tuna tartar and accompanied by several sauces - wasabi, seaweed paste, rice balls, scallons, creme fresh, and a red miso paste. There was also a miso fondue and vege dip, which was good but not amazing.There was of course, the usual sushi pieces, which I can't remember, and a tofu cheesecake dessert.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Australian wagyu was cooked beautifully as I requested it between rare and medium rare.  They sliced and served it rare on a  sizzling plate and soon after it reached to the desired temperature I wanted.  The rest of my party thought it was underseasoned but I thought it was perfect because I enjoy the natural flavors of beef.  Last but not least, the whole roasted Lobster.  This is a MUST HAVE.  Beautifully cooked lobster roasted in a garam masala rub (did wish it was a bit spicier) but what tied it together was the ""lemon creme fraiche.""  I told the waitress that I could put that creme fraiche on my shoe and eat it.  It was sweet, a little bit of tang, light and airy....perfect complement to the perfect lobster.  However, if you are a true foodie, pairing w. the meat was not even the best.  I asked her for a teaspoon so I could scoop out the yummy particles of lobster brain as it was decadent, creamy and amazing w. the creme fraiche.For desserts, we share the below, again in descending order:Chilled cheesecake souffle:  strawberry red-wine sorbet, green tea lemon powderWarm flourless chocolate cake: caramel popcorn and rice crispies, sesame caramel sauceApple bread pudding: green tea crumble, brown butter ice cream.All were so good but I like the lightness and refreshing flavors of the cheesecake souffle thanks to the strawberry red wine sorbet and dabs of some citrus gelee on the plate.  The other two were not as memorable, not in a bad way.  What I love most about this place is that I actually want to try everything on the menu.  Most places I go, I order everything that interests me and usually it's 4-5 items.  But this time, we ordered so much and there's still at least 1/2 of the menu I still want to try.  Need to go back NOW",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The food presentation was unique and the restaurant itself is pretty cool - especially the downstairs bathroom, which I'll get to later.We started out with a cocktail, of course - I ordered the white lily which was a milky white, refreshingly delicious drink.We began with the toro tartare - at first I thought it was just a bowl of garnishes to eat with the rest of our dishes lol. Turns out the little wood board that was stuck sideways in the bowl of crushed ice was the toro, and the tray of garnishes - including wasabi, avocado, seaweed sauce (sounds gross but it was good), sour cream, chives and little crunchy things - made the rest of the ""tartare"". IT WAS DELICIOUS.Next we ordered the crispy rock shrimp. These are amazing.. but VERY RICH. We couldn't eat more than 2-3 pieces. The dipping sauce was also delicious.The sushi was awesome.. especially the waygu sushi.Finally, we got the braised black cod with the miso reduction. To  tell you the truth it was too much. I'm not a fan of rich fish like butter fish, etc and after the rock shrimp, it was just wayyy too much. On  the way out we went downstairs to check out the bathrooms we had heard so much about. Loved it! Euro style toilets that automatically open... and the back wall of the stall is a floor to ceiling mirror with endless cherry blossoms reflecting. Too cute :)All in all though it was an awesome meal and we would definitely go back.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The toro was divine and the caviar added even more decadence. I enjoyed all of the accoutements with the toro: wasabi, creme fraiche, nori paste, chives,avocado and rice crackers. It was fun to play and discover surprising flavor combinations. The lobster fritters were more of a pancake consistency as delicate as the shellfish.

Also, I've been watching Iron Chef for years and told myself that one day I would try Morimoto's food. When I finally got a chance to go to New York, I made my reservations for Morimoto. I got all dressed up because I knew it was a fancy, expensive fine dining restaurant. My friend and I were a bit late for our reservation because our cab driver couldn't find it! But the hostess was really nice and had our table waiting for us. The restaurant is beautiful! Clean, white modern decor with a few colorful fluorescent looking lights. My friend and I ordered a few dishes, the tofu with lobster and mushrooms, tuna sashimi salad, Morimoto sashimi, spicy tuna roll and salmon roll. We also ordered 2 sake shots and 2 cocktails. The sake shots were $16 each!!! It was quite tasty but definitely not worth $16!The tuna sashimi salad was ok, the tuna was very fresh but the sauce was nothing special. My Morimoto sashimi plate was very pretty and had 5 layers of different fish. It came with 5 different sauces in syringe looking like things. I was very disappointed in this dish. At $28 I expected it to be mind very delicious. It was eh. It was pretty to look at but it wasn't very good and the sauces weren't good either. The rolls were decent but expensive. The only thing that I really enjoyed was the fresh tofu that they stir and make at your table. The mushroom, lobster sauce that comes with it was really delicious as well.

The fish was perfectly cooked and flavors were curious, but welcome.The fresh miso soup was served with a single slab of soft tofu.The vegetable tempura consisted of baby leek and other Asian vegetables in a light lemon cream sauce.

The tuna pizza is impeccable -- it resembles a real pizza but is made with thin slices of tuna on some sort of crunchy surface with cherry tomatoes and arugula. Seems odd at first, but trust me it's amazing.The vegetable tempura is delicious. They use a really yummy assortment of veggies i.e. avocado and some flavorful green bell peppers that look spicy but aren't.As far as drinks, their lychee martini is to die for (if you like cocktails of the sweet genre). I would likely go back there just for that :) I didn't try the sake, but those that I was with said it was definitely worth the splurge.Overall great experience.

First of all, the decor is nice, the bathrooms are beautiful and the dining is an experience. I've tried a ton of things on the menu but here's what sticks out:Ramen, Iron Chef Chicken Soup:  Simple ingredients. Really good, but also, really salty.  Keep your water glass close by.Calamari Salad.  The best thing EVER.  We ordered another plate of it as we were eating our first one.  It's THAT good.  Huge chunks of battered calamari, under a towering pile of mixed greens with the lightest dressing.  Mmmmmm!!Tuna Pizza:  sounds gross, but it's actually really good.  They sprinkle jalepenos which is a really good touch.  Adds kick.Toro Tartare:  eh.  It's alright.  I think it's a little too much work for such little bite.  If you want to play with your food, order it, if you're hungry, don't.Morimoto Sashimi:  This is also one of those ""work for it"" dishes, but there's more to chew on.  And really, you're just squeezing some colorful sauces out of cute little pipettes.  Yosedofu:  Tableside made tofu.  Really fun to watch, and fun to eat.  They give you a lobster sauce and soysauce to compliment it.  Good stuff.Black Cod:  Tasty fish but not as satisfying as the buribop!Ishi Yaki Buribop! So delicious. You must order this.  The servers put on a production when they bring it to your table.  They sear the fish along the sides of the stone pot while they mix everything else up, then neatly pile the seared fish back on to the center of the bowl.  YUM!Chilean Sea Bass:  Don't get it.  It's bland and boring.Sushi Menu:  I've had better sushi at much cheaper places, so to me, it's not worth ordering any sushi here.  It's not exceptionally iron chef-y, so no need to waste time on this page of the menu.All in all, Morimotos is awesome.  Try it!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The different sauces were interesting but anything more than the wasabi took away from the delicate taste of the tartar.  Tuna pizza was outta this world! Highly recommended!  The light lemon brings the herb and sweet flavors to life over a healthy bed of tuna.  Kampachi Carpaccio, reminds me of traditional Chinese steamed fish.  Soy and chives with a kick.  The fresh fish makes this dish great.  Chefs choice sashimi, super fresh and a great value to boot.  You just cant go wrong with this dish.  Spiced Spiny Lobster with Yuzu Crème Fraiche, the lobster was cooked to perfect done-ness.  Unfortunately like all the cooked dishes it was a bit over seasoned.   Fukumitsuya morimoto junmai daiginjo Sake, highly recommended.  Subtle and sweet. The Bad:Rock shrimp was over salted and over sauced.  Feels like a popcorn shrimp dish ordered off a child's menu.  The inconsistency with size means you get some pieces that are almost all batter.  Nobu does this dish better.  The sushi platter, rice was just a bit on the undercooked side and the vinegar was a bit overwhelming.  This did not play well with thin slice of fish on top.  Skip this and go for Sashimi.  Oyster with uni was the biggest let down.  Drenched in oyster like sauce seemingly to cover up the off taste of the oyster.  The eh:Spiced Spiny Lobster with Yuzu Crème Fraiche, the lobster was cooked to perfect done-ness.  Unfortunately like all the cooked dishes it was a bit over seasoned.   Seared wagu beef was also cooked perfectly, but the sauce was a little too much store bought teryaki.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

He claimed their fish is always fresh and certain fish are naturally ""fishier"". He offered to get me some other sashimi but at that point I was turned off their fish.

1704,5SqnSImFpM666M_qcbijWQ,Stephanie C.,4.0 star rating,"So thanks to NYC Restaurant Week, I was able to visit one of the most expensive/famous Japanese restaurants in NYC with my med student budget. For $25, they really have a lot more food than a lot of the other restaurant week participants (which was quite surprising).They only offer lunch special for restaurant week, which was completely fine with me. As long as I could step inside and be able to taste a dish (without breaking my bank) then I was satisfied :D  Anyway, aside from sounding like a complete obsessive stalker/admirer of Morimoto, the food was undoubtedly good......but not life-changing. It could be due to the menu selection for restaurant week (I mean, of course they're not going to give you their best dishes for $25). They did have a great variety tho - soup, salad, tempura, sushi/sashimi, and whichever main course you choose (I chose the wagyu beef). I would have to say.. the best was probably the Miso soup and the tempura. The stock was amazing, you can taste all the fish, ingredients, and time spent making it. And I think that is probably the hardest to master considering ALL Japanese restaurants offer Miso soup. It shows a lot about a restaurant when you can really taste how much work went into such a simple dish. The tempura was different where it didn't have the usual Tentsuyu sauce, but it had a creamy, cheesy, Westernized sauce. That sauce went surprisingly well with the tempura! I was just scooping the sauce out to eat even after I finished the tempura..I REALLY loved the design of the place. So elegant and modern! Good spacing and you feel like you have very good privacy wherever you sit. I liked how the place had a very clean feeling to it. And the BATHROOM! Wow.. those Japanese toilets.. I definitely spent some time playing with the buttons there :D hahahaWhen I can actually afford to try the Morimoto Omakase that's $120 a person, I'm sure the missing star will find its place.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

My friend and I got here around 8 PM and I told the waitress that we are only here for the appetizer. She  seated us right away and didn't tell us to move to the bar ! ( some restaurant would tell their customer to move to the bar if the only thing he or she is ordering is an appetizer, so I doubled checked with her before we sat down).  Not only  was the modern design inside the restaurant attracted my but the bathroom was very clean as well!Food: the only thing we ordered here was the TOROTARTARE.  The TORO TARTARE was in a paste form and served packed in a very special bamboo tray and topped with CAVIAR! The TORO Tartare came with another dish of dipping sauce which is consisted of : Wasabi paste, Avacado Paste, Nori Paste, Tiny Crunchy Senbei, light mayo, and chopped chives.  The whole plate of appetizer also came with a soy sauce for dipping but I didn't like it since I thought the 6 different sauce that came with the tartare was enough.  There is really no particular way of dipping the sauce, the waiter told us to do it however we like.  Those sauce pairs perfectly with the fatty toro tartare and the caviar brings this dish to a whole another level!.  The quality of the fish is so superb but because we only wanted to try this dish, I did not intend to stay there for their sashimi which received quiet a lot of reviews. According to my friend this restaurant is more Americanized and the dish was tailored to people who enjoy Asian fusion dishes. Overall the quality of the food is great but if you are looking for something more Authentic you should pick another sushi restaurant! What made this trip worth it was that my friend and I saw MORIMOTO at the restaurant and got a chance to take a pic with him!

Now that I'm a struggling designer I thought lets give it a go nearly a decade later during Restaurant Week. Unfortunately when we turned up for dinner our waiter informed us that they only do a special at lunch and they offer the lunch Bento box all year around so it's bullshit anyway. Okay so we hunkered down for dinner next to a lovely couple visiting NYC for 24hours. We got to know them quite intimately since our tables were practically on top of each other the spacing was so cramped. The Tadao Ando designed space holds up pretty well, at least the concrete columns do. The undulating ribbon ceiling is starting to fray around the edges. The walls are pretty, pretty filthy and dusty that is and there is a wall made of plastic bottles. I've heard a lot about the bathroom, it is extravagant and so over spec'd it only seems useful if your going taking a shit. I imagine they hope their food is of a quality high enough that their patrons aren't running to take a dump during their meals. Who goes to Morimoto to take a shit?  The toilet is more imaginative than the menu which is tired and boring. When you come with an Australian and they see an Aussie Wagyu Steak for nearly $100 and piss themselves laughing you realise why they have such a fancy bidet. We ordered the Surf & Turf and the recommended Braised Cod. The food was cooked well but the dishes are disappointing especially below quality, presence and imagination for the price. The minuscule bite size amount of steak was typical, mushy mix of avocado and sashimi and lilliputian potatoes. The sauce for the braised cod was too sickly sweet as was the super sweet cocktail which tasted like what we call ""lolly"" (candy) water. Our waiter was above average but you would have to be given how much they have to overcompensate for.

I showed up promptly at 5:30 for my reservation.  The hostess seemed surprised when I said it was table for one. As the staff were just ending the pre-opening meeting, I was asked to wait a few minutes. A group of 5 women walked, and they were immediately seated. I waited for someone to come get me, but after a few minutes of waiting, I walked up and asked to be seated.  At this point the hostess appeared confused about where to seat me, I told her I can sit at the sushi bar as I planned to order mainly sushi. As I sat in my corner seat near the back service area, I watched them walk by without looking at me for a full 10 minutes. Other guests were seated and their water glasses filled. Yet no one stopped by me to offer a drink or water! Finally I had to stop one of the servers walking by who got another person to come by with water and take my order.  The Morimoto sashimi plate was very good, nice presentation and tasted wonderful, though potions were tiny. The server informed me that one of the piece of fish was wrapped in shiso, also known as Japanese cilantro! REALLY????  Shiso is from the perilla family and is no way related to cilantro. When I questioned the server he replied quite haughtily that it is a fact. I know my Japanese food and was not impress with this incorrect information and the attitude of the server. The oysters with uni and foie gras, swimming in quite a bit of sauce that tasted like Chinese Oyster sauce. Not impressed!  The last portion of the meal consists of a salmon skin roll ( very good), scallop sandwich between sliced cucumber and one piece of hirame.  I was surprise at that solo piece pf fish ($5!!)  The scallops were fresh and plump. My bill came to $85!  Not impressed at all. For that I expected better quality food.  As for the server, he never came back to check on me.  The young man that cleared my plate and fill my water glass was the only pleasant interaction i had the entire evening.  I left a tip only because of his service and nice smiles, and sincere inquires about my meal. As I was walking out, I said good night to the hostess, I was almost out the door before she responded with a cool ""Bye"".  I am sorry but I will not recommend this place or return.

We chose to wait and headed downstairs to the amazing bathroom. So clean and the toilets were awesome....My only complaint would be that the stairs are tricky to navigate in heels! We ordered a glass of rose and a hydrangea (I definitely recommend both!!!).Yes the food is very expensive but it's worth it. Amazing quality. The meal took a long time; we left at about 11:20. But to be fair we ordered a lot of food. I would have preferred the service to be a little faster but it was not horribly slow. We just ordered three different courses.Also the waiters are ALL good looking. Every man and woman who works there is above average. Just another bonus.Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant. We ended up paying 240 for the two of us which is very expensive. But if you're going to go to an expensive sushi restaurant, go here!Also the rock shrimp tempura is amazing.

Maritess Z., David S. all proposed we go out for some pizza or cheap fast food afterwards. the 4 stars are dedicated to the ultra-sleek and beautiful decor. absolutely stunning and minimalistic at the same time. exquisite- indeed! the bathrooms are spotless and so beautiful. i would build my own bathroom just like this one. even when you step inside the stalls (see picture) you enter another realm of tranquility and beauty. oh yeah, the bidet is nice, too. ha!i walked in and dodged the rain all morning, fought an 1 hour worth of traffic on the freeway, and for what?!?! we ended up eating a FEAST for under $10 at Manna's Kitchen in Union Square. haha.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We tried the omakase (chef's selection) with sake pairing. The dinner course started off really strong with the tuna toro with assorted condiments, sashimi (you can add shaved truffles at extra cost) and salad (a very inventive anchovy dip with sprigs of seasonal vegetables). Less impressive, however, were the sushi (the fish didn't have the desired lusciousness) and the entree of grilled wagyu and lobster (a rather ordinary surf and turf that was neither Japanese nor fusion). The sake pairing, however, was excellent and really accentuated the flavors of the ingredients in the dinner. I wasn't as impressed with the morimotini.

1740,tUHHVlrD-aflXrWiJIIYAA,Marc T.,3.0 star rating,"Prior to taking a late stroll on the High Line so that we could watch the sun set, the gf and I wanted to eat at this place. I put in reservations a few weeks early, at the advice of all my friends and family. Besides, who DOESN'T want to eat at an original Iron Chef's restaurant, let alone out in New York?!?!? Note that this is an old review, but I never drafted it/posted it until now.The restaurant is very aesthetically pleasing. I really liked the colors and the decor of this restaurant. Going from what was recommended by family and friends, we ordered the following: Morimoto Sashimi, Kobe Beef Carpacio, Seabass and Seafood Toban Yaki.Morimoto Sashimi - Amazing. Toro, salmon, eel, tuna and hamachi thinly sliced and layered on top of each other! The sauces they came with were also spectacular. We peeled off each layer and tried each of the different sauces. It was hard to distinguish which was best, because the fish flavors were so delicate, while the sauces added that extra sweetness or spice when needed. I especially liked the japanese plum that came with it.Kobe Beef Carpacio - Amazing as well. I could not stop eating this, and probably should have ordered this over my order (Toban Yaki). The balance of this dish was well executed, with the yuzu soy, ginger and garlic creating this savory sweet sauce that I just wanted to drink or pour over some sushi rice. This is a must order.Seabass over Tempura - This was pretty good. The tempura was absolutely perfect and nicely crisp, despite being under the seabass. The seabass itself was cooked perfectly and tasted great. However, I felt that the appetizers overshadowed the main course.Seafood Toban Yaki - My friend called this Poseidon Jizz as it has almost every shell fish found in the world inside the dish. To me, it was almost like Japanese Ciopino. I thought it tasted OK. There was crab, lobster, mussels, clams and scallops. The sauce was good, but yet again the appetizers were so good, that I was left thinking about them.For dessert, we got a menu special: Soft Chocolate Ganache, White Sesame Ice Cream w Black Sesame. Holy crap... this was amazing.... the Sesame Ice Cream was so ridiculously good, that I wish they sold it in pints. That mixed with the Chocolate Ganache, which was very rich and velvety, is seriously a culinary orgasm. I felt my eyes roll back and hair stand on end eating this dessert. I wish this was on the menu permanently.I would give this place at least 4 stars, but it gets 3 because compared to the dessert and the appetizers, the main dishes that we tried were forgettable, not because they weren't good, but moreso because the appetizers and desserts were so out of this world, it made me forget that I ate dinner. Next time I come here, (or head to the one in Napa which is closer to me), I'll probably stick with multiple appetizers!Also they have the craziest toilets outside of Europe!

If I wasn't a foodie before, the hours and hours of FN I viewed (in conjunction with my glowingly distinct palate) made me a bonafide one. With Iron Chef as one of my and my brother's favorite show and Morimoto being his fave Iron Chef, again, no brainer that we were going to hit up Morimoto! Pack packed meal schedule during this trip, but we managed to fit in Morimoto for lunch on Monday. Right off, I have to say, I love the ambiance. A lot of glass, sleek birchwood and blacks. The place settings complete with the little chopstick rester and clear plastic chopsticks. Service was exceptional. Our server had a fun French accent and full of charm, explained the menu with great detail, and offered great suggestions. On to the food... We decided against the 3 course prix fix menu which was a deal, but for the price we could order sashimi and a la carte or bento box.  I ordered the beef gyudon bowl which comes with soup, and a mixed green salad with kobosu vinaigrette. Plenty plenty of food. The soup and salad (refreshing citrus flavor) were exceptional, and decent sized portions. The beef gyudon was delish, but admittedly, nothing I haven't had before, and I might even dare say that the sauce was a bit too sweet. What I did enjoy was the sashimi. I'm not super adventurous when it comes to raw fish, but the salmon and tuna were phenomenal. Perfect sized, and literally melted in my mouth. All said, they were quite pricey, and orders were one piece versus the two or three other restaurants offer. My brother ordered the black cod bento box that includes soup, salad, tempura and sushi (a nice mix of nigiri and spicy tuna rolls). Everything was quite enjoyable. Tempura was lightly coated and not overly greasy. By far the best valued meal on the menu. On to the bathroom...yes, the bathroom deserves a brief description of praise too. Separate washrooms for men and women--a plus! Super clean, I used the restroom twice because it was a trek to our next destination, and who knows when I'd encounter a bathroom this clean in NYC! Sliding aluminum doors, simple and clean colored surfaces, and a water spraying, warm seated toilet! Need I say more?! Would definitely recommend Morimoto, and envision that I'd go back for the sashimi, overall chic ambiance and bathroom alone!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Sure, you have to pay through your nose for the Omakase dinner, but then you can see the Iron Chef and dine in an elegantly designed setting.I enjoyed the Rock Shrimp Tempura - the serving was huge, but I was slightly more partial towards the fried shrimp in Wasabi aioli over the shrimp in Korean red pepper sauce. Even the entree, Angry chicken was substantial and had a fiery touch to it. Well recommended for those not trying Sushi. (I decided to defer Sushi for another opportunity).The main reason for going to Morimoto was to see if the accolade of best new dessert in the city was well deserved. If I were finicky (and I am) the Tofu cheesecake was excellent, but mainly a result of the contrasting flavors of the accompaniments. I alternated a long while between portion combinations and decided that the best one was to have the chiffon like cheesecake with the candied ginger (to give it bite) and then follow it with the dipping sauce (maple syrup with coffee).  Simply Amazing! (Mind you, the thin chocolate shavings on top of the white chiffon didn't add anything to the flavor)Also endearing was the Chocolate Hazelnut cake dessert with excellent texture variations between wafer and mousse.

We had the tasting menu, which was very diverse, but didn't have a flow I expect from tasting menus. I'm not a sushi aficionado, but I didn't think the sushi was particularly special - at higher end places there isn't dipping in soy, usually it's applied for you. The cooked oyster was also just ok - very over seasoned. Which is a bit of theme - heavy on soy, terriyaki and other sauces that obscured the real fish or meat flavor. I was a bit taken by the $30 upgrade on the $125 meal for the beef.

1770,jhC7XCUiTdAqw8HAhs5OuQ,Jessica F.,3.0 star rating,"Eh.  That's it.  The restaurant was beautifully done, the restrooms alone are worth an admission fee, but the food at lunch during restaurant week was definitely on autopilot.  As other diners have mentioned, the menu for a prix-fixe lunch during restaurant week is pretty basic.  Peter ordered the chef's sushi lunch, which came with a miso soup and salad.  I ordered the black cod bento box lunch for $27, which was the same as the prix-fixe except it had a few pieces of tempura and the portions of the salad, soup and cod were smaller.  It was very adequate.  For dessert we tried the tofu ""cheesecake"" which had a fluffy interesting texture, and was garnished with crystalized ginger and lime zest, but also came with a maple syrup sauce that was far too overpowering for the dessert.This is Morimoto.  I have seen him on television working miracles with tuna and flying fish roe and there was zero magic on my plate.  I have had equal bento lunches, both in taste and presentation, in any corner sushi place, and that is a damn shock and a damn shame.Service could not have been nicer or better, with special thanks to the waiter who told me that the cool chopsticks I wanted to steal were made by Tampopo, so I could leave with my head up.  The restaurant decor is really chic and stunning, the Japanese toilets with numerous cleansing and...um...massaging...options, were intensely amusing.  Even if you don't have to, you know, go...you should go.  The lounge downstairs where the toilets are gets five stars for glam factor.  If you mention you're a fan you can get an autographed menu.   The best thing we had was the spicy tuna roll on both our plates.  The miso soup was salty.  Overall, completely underwhelming.  We will come back for dinner, because I think that in anticipation of Restaurant Week, they undershot their menu in order to be able to accomodate the crowds, which really worked against them.  Truly unimpressive in every way.  Good, not great.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
1771,09LB_bCkaYMiWobchmnPMw,Fiddos J.,1.0 star rating,"My second experience here has convinced me this place is a typical NYC restaurant - ridiculously expensive, over-hyped, and very very mediocre food - confusing trendiness and hipness for quality. In short, full of sound and fury signifying nothing. I went back here, expectantly, after being convinced that the last time I did not partake of the right aspects of this place. And I persuaded a group of friends to come along - promising them a great sushi experience.  That is the last time anybody puts any faith in my recommendations .... :-/So - this time we ordered the toro tartare, the whitefish carpaccio, the yosedofu, the sushi platter, and a couple of desserts.  I can't say that the food was bad - it was good. But it was definitely not exceptional.  And it was super-definitely not worth $400 .... The sushi was pretty much like the sushi at any decent restaurant - and the flavors of other items were what you'd expect from a run-of-the-mill Japanese place.You could have had the same underwhelming food anywhere else for less than 1/2 that price - and not have to put up with the tacky hipness of this place. And that's the problem - the absurd price to value ratio. Which is a very NYC thing, no doubt.

1773,boNYqPQSttWPuZlAsWxy0Q,Ashley J.,3.0 star rating,"Hands down the most beautiful restaurant I've been to. The decor is very modern and chic and the open kitchen is a great touch as well. I ate dinner here with my mother and ordered 3 dishes (two entrees and an appetizer) and it cost me $150. I came with my expectations high, and left with my stomach full and wallet empty.The 3 things we ordered were the toro tartare, the black cod braised in miso, and the surf and turf.The toro tartare: presentation was a home run! The fish was very fresh but I just didn't like it that much. I've had better toro. The black cod braised in miso: I found the presentation to be rather funny. A medium filet of black cod along with 4 black beans and 3 pinky nail sized slices of pepper. The cod was perfectly cooked, very moist, and also a little too salty for my taste.Surf & Turf: It came with a variety of potatoes, hamachi ribbons, and a wagyu steak. I'm going to start off with the bad things about this. Potatoes were coated with a kind of butter infused with some sort of herb but it literally tasted like I sprayed some of my  perfume on each potato before I put it in my mouth. GROSS. The hamachi ribbons were great slices of fresh fish. Delicate, soft, and melt in your mouth. But the avocado/yuzu/tomato salad under it makes me want to punch a wall. When the waiter mixed it for me, I wanted to cry because it went from sweet fresh fish to Hamachi gone Mexican. IT TASTED LIKE GUACAMOLE FISH. Of all people, I would've thought that Morimoto would've appreciated the freshness of the fish rather than pair it with overwhelmingly strong flavors. WHY MORIMOTO WHY. But the one thing I can say that I loved about the surf and turf was the wagyu steak. Oh my delicious. That piece of meat was so tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked. Each bite of steak was soft, melt in your mouth, and a little buttery. YES FINALLY A WINNER. The service was subpar. Not very attentive and a little too pushy. I know what I want so stop suggesting things I do not wish to order.Overall, I really really really wanted to love Morimoto because I've adored him for years.

We also had the sashimi appetizer..just a heads up for the sashimi appetizer, their quiet small but each comes with a different 'topping'..of course my favorite was with the caviar (yumm!!) We both actually enjoyed the sashimi much more than the toro (i know I'm going to get a lot of flack for this as it seems EVERYONE raves about the toro)..We also enjoyed the rock shrimp tempura..My boyfriend loved this one the best as he found both flavors to be very tasty!We then were deciding what to do next..sushi? more appetizers? entree? two entrees?

It is beautifully constructed and they serve wonderful trendy drinks so the atmosphere is great.The apps range from ok to really good (loved the foie gras chawan mushi and the toro tartare but the rock shrimp tempura was totally over rated as it was  kind of greasy and gloopy with all that sauce).Without specific detail, The cooked dishes tend to be really good.Now the not so good :The sushi is good but now well below par for a place this well renowned, but I guess that's what ultimately happens when you sell your name out to the cookie cutter process (although I think that sushi at Nobu is still very good although simple and traditional).The fish quality was good as always but many (4) items were unavailable. Also,  the sushi on this nite visibly and tastefully  lacked the hands of a sushi master.  The pieces of fish were so thin that they were the same temp as the luke warm sushi rice by the time they arrived.  Also, when the fish is that thin,  it gets over powered by the rice (unless we're talking about fluke or other fish that are intended to be sliced thin).  I know my sushi ;)    I have to say that the live octopus sushi was probably the best bite i had.The sushi bar itself is constructed in a way that  one will have absolutely no interaction with the chef that makes your food (which IMHO is a mistake).  Having risen up the ranks while working over at Nobu,  I don't think morimoto wanted anyone to rise up from within his restaurant.  Plus I'm sure it's hard to find so many chefs with personalities to man all those restaurants.  The result is a sushi bar experience that lacks any interaction or intimacy.  You can see the chefs working but they're too far to advise you or even hand you your food without getting up and really reaching far (which they don't do).  So imagine going to a really good sushi bar and and talking to the waiter, ONLY,  never the chef.  Why bother?Now back to some more good:The desserts are really really good.  I think they're better than the sushi.  I've been here numerous times and who ever does the desserts knows what they are doing.  On this night we had the TOFU Hot & Cold.  Very nice.  Definitely save some room.Overall,  if atmosphere in a Japanese restaurant is what you're looking for then this place will do quite nicely.  However,  if you're in the need for really high end sushi with a true master chef's fingerprint on your experience,  perhaps think about heading over to Sushi of Gari of Sushi Seki.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Walking in was a little confusing- the front of the restaurant has these billowing curtains, but then you walk in and the deco is very modern and sleek. One weird thing is that there is no bar area visible when you walk in, so you have to walk downstairs to the bar. I went downstairs and had a cocktail while waiting for my friends, and then we were all seated upstairs once we had all arrived. Everything we ordered was great and I highly recommend going with a group of people and sharing. We ordered the foie gras chawan mushi, black cod miso, angry chicken, the yellowtail buri bap, and five or six sushi rolls. The chawan mushi was like nothing I had had before, and it was delicious. The cod and the chicken were perfectly cooked and really flavorful. The sushi rolls were made with some of the freshest fish I've ever had.

Over all I could say I was disappointed having had omakase in Kyoto and feeling immensely satisfied. This was lacking. Besides having an array of beautiful plates, sauces, extra filler things on top of fish it just seemed like I was getting a show instead of getting food. I had every dish explained to me and still couldn't understand the purpose of the flavors and their components.

1783,4ZpCAQ2Ti_XiMB_jvvn17g,Allison J.,4.0 star rating,"Okay... so I'm biased. I used to work here. But here's a great opportunity for me to tell people what my favorite dishes and what I generally think of the restaurant.

First off, there is a Morimoto in Philly and that's where ""Iron Chef"" Morimoto has his first namesake restaurant. I hear it's smaller and less trendy but still visually impressive and good food.

Cocktails: Try the White Lily. It's made with sudachi shocho, calpico and yuzu juice. Have you had a Louisiana satsuma fruit? Well, this is it, in a martini glass. I also like  the Autumn Leaf. If you like chai lattes, you'll like this.

Apps: Tried and true and therefore not very adventurous- go with the Rock Shrimp Tempura. You get 3oz of deep fried rock shrimp in Morimoto's buffalo sauce and another 3oz of fried shrimp in a wasabi aioli. 

Pretty presentation, go with the Zen Sai. It's a Japanese antipasto plate. You get salmon sushi wrapped in bamboo leaf, mackerel wrapped in cedar wood, duck meatballs, califlower flan with lobster meat and lobster consomme, and a small bowl of sesame dofu.

Toro tartare is also very pretty though not much food. So it's not a great one to share. You get 7 condiments to go with the toro ranging from nori paste to avocado puree.

Oysters foie gras is fantastic. You get 3 oysters topped with uni and foie with a little terriyaki reduction. It's all served over aromatic salt and spices so the dish smells lovely.

The lamb carpaccio is a small portion by the ginger scallion dressing with raw meat is so freakin' delicious that you'll savor every little bite! Also the foie gras chowan mushi is fabulous. Small, but rich and creamy with just a little thinly sliced duck meat to top it off.

Entrees: People seem to order to buri bop a lot but it's not my favorite. I find that it's prepared at the table with too much sauce and the dish just doesn't do it for me. Instead, I prefer the ""Iron Chef"" chicken noodle soup the pork kakuni (which is really an appetizer) and the Wagyu ribeye. Honestly, I'm an appetizer person. I love to try little bits of everything so entrees are less appealing to me. Too much commitment to one dish!

The decor is beautiful though a bit cold for my taste. I like eating in places where I feel very comfortable and cozy. This is a place you come to when you're feeling swanky and showy. Like, you're here to be seen and cause a scene. It's definitely NOT the neighborhood-y restaurant that I adore so much as the behemoth establishment you and your friends get together to go and splurge. You'll most likely do some celebrity spotting when you come in and there's definitely a buzz about the place that makes it fun. 

If you're out to impress a client or you have a date that likes the sparkly, good life, this is a great place to check out.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I shared the Wagyu and Black Cod with a friend.  The Wagyu was nothing exceptional.  The Black Cod is comparable to what one can cook at home.  As for the other items in the box, there was a salad with fried shallot flakes, tempura (with scallion and oyster mushroom), nigiri (maguro, hamachi, & salmon), and miso shiru.  The sushi pieces were smallish, but were the best items in the box. I'm sure if one orders off the regular menu, the meal would be great.  After this meal, I am not motivated to return.  The waiter was trying to explain that since RW is now two weeks, two times a year, restaurants have had to scale back on their RW offerings since they lose a lot of money then.  If that's the case, how come other restos like Maialino, Alto, The Modern, and Gramercy Tavern can get it right?",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

This was my third experience dining here and this time we brought some out-of-towners and first-timers with us. We were also celebrating two birthdays that evening as well. The service was top-notch and always very efficient with clearing away dishes. Every dish was beautifully presented, as is expected with Morimoto's high level of culinary artistry. Two of our friends got the Omakase, which is the 8-course chef's special dining experience, while the rest of us ordered a la carte items off the regular menu. My boyfriend and I got the Rock Shrimp Tempura, which come glazed in two different sauces, one is a chili-buffalo type sauce and the other is a wasabi cream sauce. I still cannot decide which one is my favorite! We also ordered the Kakuni, which is the pork belly, and probably one of the best I've ever had. For entrees we got the Surf and Turf, and an order of the Sashimi for two. I'm getting sleepy just thinking about it. For dessert, we had the Apple Turban, and if you like Apple pie as much as I do, this is the dessert for you. It's Apple everything! My boyfriend had the Strawberry Pistachio Cheesecake, which was a lot more strawberry than pistachio cheesecake. It was still pretty delicious though. Oddly enough, it came with a small helping of pop rocks? He was pretty excited about that :) One of my friends is allergic to avocados and lactose intolerant and was catered to very well in terms of alternatives. Aside from a small glitch at the end of the night with a missing order of port wine, the evening went smoothly and was a top-notch experience!

The shrimp and sauces were tasty, but extremely greasy. Our server was great.  She was very knowledgeable and friendly. I got the Seafood Tobanyaki and he got the Wagyu Strip steak.  Both were good and flavorful, but unfortunately, we were both unable to finish our meals between the sweating, nausea and dizziness.We didn't manage to get dessert because our faces were turning gray and we needed to get home before we both fainted.Morimoto, sorry we didn't get to fully enjoy you, but I would like to return one day, because I did like what I tried.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We had a great waiter who was very knowledgeable about the food and was super attentive to our table.  The only nitpicky thing issue I had was at the end of the evening when we were given our bill, it felt like we were being rushed to provide our cards and so they could clear off the table.  It was almost 11pm on a Tuesday night - I can't imagine that you had a party that needed our table of 4 to be emptied that quick that you needed to rush out people. Food: 3. The food was good.  And if I were at any of the other restaurants in the city that aren't as 'acclaimed' as Morimoto, I would likely give the food a 3.5-4.  However, with great name comes great expectation.  And while everything we ordered was tasty, it seemed that we were more excited when we read about it on the menu.  I'd come back here for the rock shrimp and the tuna pizza and the virgin drinks we had, but I don't foresee coming back here for dinner.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I actually ordered something else first and it was kind of bad. I informed the waitress that then she replaced my drink with white lilly, which was so good.  We ordered one hot app and one cold app. The tartar with cavier and all those japanese dip was soooo good! seriously, tartar was so smooth and light..gosshh I still want some more!  For hot app, we had spicy king crab. It was also good. Spicy and tasty. However I felt that it's just a tiny bit salty though. We, 2 ladies, didn't try any main dishes because we wanted to keep it light. Instead, we had shrimp tempura maki, which wasn't that special. I was debating to myself I should give this place 4 or 5 stars. I feel like it's more like 4.5 stars. We had such a fantastic experience for dinner but dessert wasn't that impressive. The coconut panna cotta was good but chocolate cake was bad. We thought that they could have done better. The cake was too dry and bitter. However, hot green tea i had with dessert was so light and smooth. I love it.It is a place to go if you want good food.

The addition of the lemon creme fraiche was a smart and inventive replacement to traditional clarified butter as well as a nice accompaniment the robust flavor of the garam masala.  Small bites of roasted vegetables (beets, cauliflower, carrots) were delicious as well.  We also had the most amazing brussels sprouts I've ever had!!  I am not kidding!  I could've eaten 5 pounds of these suckers, slightly charred, a little savory, a little sweet...if only they were served this tasty as I child I might have enjoyed them then.  dessert:  hot and cold tofu was absolutely decadent.  A small serving each of soy milk souffle, tofu cheesecake, and maple ice cream with maple syrup!

1822,1tMioShOidn7xuKx4SC2-g,Shuo Y.,2.0 star rating,"I've loved Morimoto ever since I first started watching Iron Chef years ago.  I  Ioved watching those old battles with Bobby Flay and he was always my favorite iron chef.  Which is why I was a bit hesitant to go to his restaurant in NYC; I had heard mixed things about it, and I didn't want to ruin what ever concept I had in my head about him.After a friend went and recommended it, I couldn't hold back anymore, especially after she mentioned that the dinner crowd was a slightly awkward mix of normal people and really old men with younger women - it sounded like a good opportunity to people watch and try out the food, so Felicia and I decided to try it out.The restaurant is a lot of fun - the dining room is creatively laid out, and a feast to the eyes, and you get a sense of energy walking into the large space that is youthful and vibrant, a very different feel from most high end dining rooms.I was really excited to try the fugu, which to this day I still associate with the episode of the Simpson's where Homer eats it and supposed only has a few hours left to live.  Sadly, after eating it, I think it's more of a ""hey look at me I can eat a really poisonous fish"" thing than a ""this is actually very tasty"" thing.  I had heard that chefs in Japan who are skilled can leave a little bit of poison on the fish such that it tingles your lips, but there was none of that (maybe that's a good thing).  The fugu came out in two varieties, fried and sashimi, along with some sauce on the side and both were fairly bland.Fortunately the main courses were bright and exciting.  Felicia and I both ordered seafood - the seafood toban yaki for her and the lobster for me.  Both were good and I thought the tobn yaki was an especially good value given the size of the dish.  The flavors were strong and forceful, which I liked, but ultimately nothing spectacular.Ultimately we both had a really good time, but for the money, I think there are too many other places I would rather go to that would have been more special.  Maybe I should reserve judgment until I come back and try to omakase, but my gut tells me I can do better elsewhere.  The stand out quality of Morimoto's was the atmosphere as it was refreshing to go to a place that felt so vibrant for once.  I'd recommend Morimoto's to Iron Chef fans who want to see what's up, but if you are looking for sublime seafood I would say your dollar is better spent elsewhere.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I will see if he can come by...""I was excited beyond belief.  The man himself was available!Our first course came.  Toro tartare.  The best toro tartare I have ever had in my life.  Presented beautifully, as was Morimoto's style.  While I was gazing in awe at my plate, Morimoto heads straight for our table.  My jaw dropped and eyes widened... hubby looked at me like I was losing it and then turned around.He shook our hands and said a pleasant hello and took a picture with us.  He is much less intimidating in person, with a gentle mannerism, which I had expected.  He was rumored to be an extremely nice person and from our brief exchange, he was all that and more.  (Thank you for making my night Morimoto-san!)After that, I could barely wipe the grin off my face to enjoy the rest of my meal.In our omakase, there was foie gras, raw oyster, sushi, some kind of carpaccio, lobster and wagyu.  There might have been something else I missed but each dish was presented beautifully.  However, there was definitely lacking in the taste department for some things (ie: the wagyu wasn't to my liking and some of the sushi pieces were too chewy).When dessert came around, they also present us with a small platter with Happy Anniversary scrawled on it (I'd like to think that HE did it himself... hehehe)All in all, a worthwhile experience for our $330+ meal.  Would come here again, but maybe not for omakase anymore.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I did enjoy the toro appetizer and the surf and turf but both portions were way too small. Nothing left me wanting to compliment the chef. The portions were very small and it felt like they cut down to maximize profits. It felt like the whole restaurant has become a high end food factory for wealthy tourists. My husband and I are attorneys who love to eat well and don't mind spending in restaurants. We love all things Japanese but this fell flat. Bottom line, it was $700 for four people and it wasn't worth it. I may have felt better if it was $500 but I'm not even sure. I won't go back.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
1831,iVUV68UL2L4Z7CYtoHFNIA,Kelly O.,4.0 star rating,"I tried Morimoto in Tokyo and became obsessed with their toro tuna tartare. When I came to NYC this time I decided that making a pit stop here to have his toro would be essential. The sliding door entrance is very cool and as you enter you are greeted with a very clean and modern interior. We were seated in a room to the left which was a bit crowded but as we were only staying for a round of appetizers it was fine. Had I stayed for an entire meal I would have probably felt uncomfortable. We decided on three starters: the tuna tartare, the rock shrimp tempura, and the curry beef bread. The tuna tartare is still one of the best things I have ever eaten. Do yourself a favor and if you are anywhere near a Morimoto have the tuna tartare. The rock shrimp was nothing special and tasted very much like every other rock shrimp I have ever had. And finally the curry bread was delicious. It had the true japanese curry flavors in a soft and fried bread. It is comfort food. Maybe one day Morimoto will come to Miami and I can have my toro tartare fix more often.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Beautiful furniture, and beautiful lighting. The food though on the other hand is just mediocre. I had the ramen soup which was a little overly oily especially for it being $20 for the bowl. The sea bass was a little over cooked, but the sauce it was in was delicious. The brussel sprouts was my favorite part of the meal, absolutely delicious. I wouldn't have wanted the brussel sprouts any other way, and I still crave for them til this day! The sushi was okay, I've had way better back home in Minnesota. The food is pricey for what you get, but the experience is worth it. The restrooms are what blew my mind. Heated toilet seats, buttons on the side of the stalls for adjusting the toilet to the way you want it, tropical fish tanks behind each toilet.The service was very on point too.

Hey, we're in NY for food and company so this all works out. EVERYTHING was good!! My only thing is that the hamachi that was cooked was good, but I enjoyed it more uncooked as sashimi.The sea bass and trout were soooo good cooked. The sea bass was very smooth, too. And the veggies they cooked with the fish were tasty tasty.We had the fugu AKA blowfish, which is one of the few places in NY licensed to prepare and serve it. It was a $70 dish, well an appetizer for us, but it was almost one of those once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, and hey, we're still alive!How can I forget that sashimi. The fish lay on a bed of ice, which kept it cold, and it all tasted so fresh. Need...to...find...good...sashimi...in Bay Area.

Anyway, the Nobu connection had me sold.As I do when I am at Kai (which feeds along the same Nobu umbilical cord), I ordered mostly sushi. The avocado-cucumber one tasted marvellously better than it would at any Jap dig, owing perhaps to the interior design and lighting. The shiso one with plum sauce was great as well, and tasted faintly of cumin. I'm not lying! I had this tofu dish where they let the soy liquid coagulate like taho, to eat with a veganized sauce made with mushroom (supposed to be lobster). They made a mistake at first, but our server was too pretty to reprimand sternly.Rob had the tasting menu, which I can't really describe in detail. But he was delighted. The opener was some kind of beautiful mashed up raw fish with a plethora of condiments artfully arranged. Worth mentioning was that one of them things on the side were little rice cracker pellets that resembled fish food but tasted snacky and great. Intriguing! As I awaited my boyfriend (who had gone to the restroom) to ask his permission to eat the fruit on the shaved ice, the waiter engaged me in a conversation about it and later came back with one more just for me. I saved the seeds. I hope to grow them. Please pray for me.Halfway within his menu, my boyfriend posited the theory that restaurants serve you all these things that gas your stomach up, so that halfway done you're fooled into thinking that you're full-- but how can you possibly be with all such tiny servings? He is on to something.In all it was wonderful, especially my boyfriend's dessert, which was some kind of bean cake with apricot compote and sorbet, and green tea drizzles. Damn that was wonderful.The bathrooms are quite exceptional to the point of being absurd. It seems like being in a Japanese Alice in Wonderland sideward-falling mirror-hole with a cherry tree to console you of your vertigo. In all it has a beautiful effect. And so when you enter the cubicle (it seems hardly even right to call it that), the toilet seat opens on its own like a flower blooming in a Discovery Channel fast-forward sequence. And as you sit, unreasonably trusting, as always, the hygiene of pricey restaurants, and your soul will chuckle as you realize that the toilet seat is heated. Long live Japan and its vibrant patent office!The bill was pricey, but hey, you only live once. I would do it again. We were both satisfied and we thus both recommend you go. Try to sit by the sushi bar to watch them put things together. You can ask them things (for instance, one of the chefs says he eats at Babbo during his off days, obviously trying to keep Iron Chef ratings up), and they're pretty funny.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Not being a native New Yorker I experienced major sticker shock when I saw the prices on this menu. But once I ate my first Morimoto morsel, I knew it was worth every penny. My group and I ordered almost at least half of the menu. I would highly recommend the lobster fritters and the tempura rock shrimp. The rock shrimp is served with this delicious dill/ranch dip, I wish I would have kept it for the rest of my meal to dip everything in. If I had to choose one thing that was my favorite it would be the sashimi salad. I have never had more deliciously seared and seasoned tuna and it was served with a Caesar like salad, not the usual soy sauced based green mixture. For sushi, you cannot go wrong. I loved the shrimp tempura, spider crab, California roll, and most of the the BBQ-ed eel roll. The BBQ on the eel gave it a different texture and unique taste.

One piece contained a giant bone along with tiny pieces of bones. I understand that fishes have bone but in a sashimi at morimoto's? I expected more. Manager came by and basically was like you know how it is. It's fish so it's normal. I mean he treated us to an extra piece but we didn't really want to eat it after that experience. Strike one.  We decided to order a bottle of sake from the menu. When the sake came, it was 300 ml instead of 500 ml. My father noticed because it appeared a lot smaller. The waiter came and said that was as advertised on the menu. We checked it again and it was not the case which probably means a lot of people have been ripped off before. Strike two. As for strike three, waiter forgot to put in an order for one of our appetizers and served the birthday candle to the wrong person. All in all I was pretty disappointed in morimoto's.

I had to write this review though as a warning for others who might go there for lunch. There are many things to order at Morimoto that will assure you a delicious lunch. Ramen is NOT one of them. Since I've had almost everything on the menu, I thought I'd try something new and see how the ramen was. Morimoto is known for being a stickler for quality so I though it would at least be decent. Negative, Ghost Rider. This dish is not worthy of this restaurant. They should take it off the menu. The broth was not flavorful, but salty & oily. It tasted like an msg laden broth out of a can. The noodles were shockingly all stuck together. And they were dry rice noodles. Like the kind you make pad thai with. It was one of the worst lunches I've ever had.

We had a party of 6 so we started off with some appetizers. We got some Chu-Toro sashimi, morimoto sashimi, and crispy rock shrimp tempura. The sashimi dishes were top notch and the shrimp tempura was different but really awesome. For our entrees, the two birthday people both ordered the omakase. I ordered the black cod with a side of bok choy. I woldnt say the black cod was the best I have ever had... but it was really good. There was too much sauce so the sweetness of the sauce overwhelmed the taste of the fish. I had to eat the fish with rice so the rice would negate some of the sweetness from their sauce. The texture of the fish was near perfect and the side of bok choy complimented my fish perfectly. I had a few bites from the omakase courses and I just have  say that they were amazing. Next time I am in town and I am at Morimoto's, I will definitely order that.

The only asians there were management and the ones working the sushi bar. Uh oh...I went here for my birthday and naturally, had very high expectations coming in. Lets face it, Iron Chef Morimoto's restaurant should be what legends are made out of right? WRONG. This place was clearly catering to a ""western"" palette. Japanese food is all about simplicity and light complementing flavors. This meal was far from it. It had it's highlights, but the only thing which blew us away was the ginger ale.We had ordered omakase style and the menu came as follows:Toro Tartare with Osetra CaviarSeasoned Fluke w/ micro greens + cherry tomatoesSockeye Salmon w/ greens + apple vinegaretteLobster Ravioli5 pieces sushi House Ginger Ale""Flash Grilled"" Kobe slice on candied Mountain yams Half lobster w/ side of citrus creme frechePumpkin souffle topped with ginger ice cream, candied asian pear w/ ginger marshmallows.   Omakase consists of tiny dishes which highlight's the chef's ability to take your mouth on a flavor adventure. This was simply an extended appetizer with a main course and a truly medeocre desert. The Toro Tartare with Osetra Caviar was rather tasty, but to grind toro into a paste is such a terrible waste. The side condiments were semi fresh wasabi, citrus creme freche (tasted like sour cream), nori paste, avocado mash, and rice balls. an odd combo but it was a decent way to start.Seasoned Fluke w/ micro greens + cherry tomatoes were rather tasty. no complaints here. Sockeye Salmon w/ greens + apple vinegarette was odd. The salmon was very well prepared, but it was sitting in a sauce which tasted like pink mayonnaise. The apple vinegarette dressing clashed with the mayo like sauce and the sea salted skin clashed with everything else on the plate. Fail. Lobster Ravioli in a yam broth dressed with the freshest ikura i've ever tasted. Unfortunately, that's where the food flavors ended and the bad ones began. The skin of the ravioli was chewy and the lobster tasted like a salt lick. i tried to wash the lobster down with the light broth, but my efforts were fruitless. Fail.5 pieces sushi -  Yummy Toro. Again. (in Omakase, repeats are like a dj playing the same song twice. No bueno). The other pieces, snapper/eel/mackerel were tasty but nothing spectacular. I was expecting Iron Chef. I got local cook. The fish was above average quality.Shot of House Ginger Ale - Starts clean and fresh, ends sharp. Best part of the meal. ""Flash Grilled"" Kobe slice on candied Mountain yams  - Tasted like kbbq. A waste of kobe beef. Half lobster w/ side of citrus creme freche - overly seasoned, tasted too strong. The seasoning killed the lobster flavor, parts were way over cooked, and the creme freche tasted like sour cream. Fail.Pumpkin souffle topped with ginger ice cream, candied asian pear w/ ginger marshmallows.   It was cute, but unimpressive. it was a sad attempt at wrapping up the meal. For the two of us, the bill came out to be about 340. They even charged us 8 dollars for some rather unimpressive cheap tea. Service was spectacular, as was presentation. It was impecably clean, except for a lone fly buzzing around. That kind of grossed me out. I wouldn't pay those prices for somewhere which should be a spectacular dining experience.Suffice to say, I have lost a lot of faith in food network.

Interesting pairing with cheeseSushi: light and perfectly glutinous, good ratio of rice to fishCod: soft and tender, enough glaze to satisfyThe waiter was surprisingly inattentive, and neglected to bring us our order of green tea.

It was very open, modern, and clean.  From the outside, you'd never expect it, as you can pass by and not even notice it is a restaurant.   I did find the food to be kind of pricey, especially the sushi.   At first we thought the sushi was priced for 2 pieces, but it was priced per each.   Gasp to our surprise, but we ordered anyways.    Though the services overall was good, our waiter could not really explain the dishes. I could give a better interpretation of them reading off the menu than he could.   Though I did like the sushi we ordered, my entree of the surf & turf (Kobe beef and hamachi ribbons) was disappointing. Mainly, it was the Kobe beef, as I did not find to be fatty enough, to melt in my mouth. The hamachi ribbons was good though, mostly due to the avocado mixed into it.   My friends dish of the seafood itoban yaki was excellent though.  There was so much flavor in the broth, which accented the seafood.One cool note is the toilets, as they have the Japanese toilets.

Scrape, dip, garnish, eat, and repeat.  Definitely get it if you haven't tried it.  The oysters, on the other hand, were something I would order again and again and again.

Everything was so fresh tasting.  The tomago tasted like pound cake.  My favorite of the bunch was the fatty tuna.

And yes, I really did get bonchon afterwards. 7 or 8 unimpressive courses... the first course (toro tartare) showed promise, but I think presentation was 80% of the appeal. Most of the plates were raw seafood plates, and the rest were HEAVILY seasoned with teriyaki sauce or soy sauce not unlike what you can purchase at the Chinatown supermarkets. BORING. The dessert was another huge letdown... some sort of chocolate mousse thing on top of some more chocolate. I thought it was way too sweet and again, unimaginative. Granted, it was really fresh seafood. But if all I wanted were fresh sushi I would not need to patronize an Iron Chef restaurant, where creative and innovative recipes should be the sell. I did appreciate the fact that they let us keep our reservation even though we were a good 30 minutes late. The service after we sat down, though, was mediocre at best.

I know I had fluke, I think red snapper, a certain kind of mackerel and another piece I forget. The waiter had told me they were out of mackerel but one of the sushi chefs (I think the only American guy there) told me he had one piece for me and sliced one on the spot for me which wasn't put on my bill. (That was greatly appreciated) The fish tasted really fresh and delicious.The sashimi served as an appetizer for me. For an entree I had the ""Duck! Duck! Duck!"" Fair portion and delicious. The duck sauce was pretty outstanding, also.I wound up sitting next to a really nice couple from Montreal. We talked about hockey and food and had a pleasant conversation. It was the woman's birthday and they had a chocolate lava cake at the end of their meal which was at the same time I was contemplating my desert. They gave me a pieces of their desert and it was excellent. A memorable experience.The staff was friendly. The waiter was knowledgeable and attentive. The decor was beautiful.

Not a good look when your on a hot date.Advice #2: don't have the ""deer-in-the-headlights"" look in your face when you recieve the bill....you cheap bastard.Advice #3: Stop trying to get quick glances at the hot piece of ass man-ning the doors.

The oysters were so delicious and so was the toro tartare especially with all the sauces. We also ordered many things and overall very good.

The best dish in the bento box was the sushi. It was so fresh and delightful with a touch of wasabi. The spicy The cod was ok - it didn't taste extraordinarily special but it was tasty. The fish was perfectly cooked but the sauce was a little overpowering. It was more like something my mother would make at home. (That being said, my mother is an amazing cook.)  Everything else was good too. If I were to rate the bento box alone, I would give it something between a 3 and 4. What really blew us away (like Judy L said) were the desserts. It started with the panna cotta that came with our restaurant week meal. This was a delicious and light green tea panna cotta. Then, due to an earlier incident at our table, the manager comp'd our table with two desserts: apple bread pudding and a cheesecake with raspberry sorbet. These were to die for. I don't know how I will ever enjoy future desserts to come in my life after this experience. The desserts were so amazing, our one male friend at the table didn't dare take a bite as the three of us ladies devoured the desserts in seconds. The cheesecake was light and fluffy - almost airy. Not too sweet and still flavorful. The apple bread pudding came with the green tea crumble that made the dish just mind blowing. I'm not sure how you get the tartness and sweetness in an apple to taste so subtle not do I understand how you can make a crumble taste not at all like clumps of sugar and butter, but all of this and more were fully accomplished. It wasn't remotely close to what I would expect from an apple dessert (I was kind of expecting more like a super sweet pie). It was like a light but creamy pudding. Honestly, my dessert descriptions really don't do these desserts justice. You have to go in and try it out for yourself. MAKE LOTS AND LOTS OF ROOM FOR DESSERT. In fact, even if you don't have room (like us), just order it and it will disappear. All in all, the service was great. We had a few issues arise from our experience and the manager resolved them each gracefully. If he hadn't, I would probably be complaining about each incidents in this review rather than raving about the desserts.

Foie Gras Chawan Mushi: I was never a fan of foie gras until I ate it here. Similar to the French version of foie gras but with a modern Asian twist.  Ishi Yaki Buri Bop: The yellowfish arrived raw in a steaming stone bowl.  The waiter mixes the contents of the bowl in front of your eyes so the fish cooks right in front of you.  Perfect for something warm on a cold day.  Tajima Wagyu Filet: Melts in your mouth. To rival the best steakhouses.  Chilean Sea Bass: The sea bass was expertly cooked; the edges are slightly crisped and the flakes literally slide off the filet.  Not too moist or saucy.  The flavor was not overwhelmingly sweet as sea bass sometimes is.  Small portion for large stomachs.  Surf and Turf:  Very small portions.  The few slices of wagyu beef were delicious (see above). Lots of avocado - you may want to avoid this if you are not a fan of avocados.  Large collection of sake and waitstaff are knowledgeable enough to provide recommendations.  The Morimoto daijino sake was one of the best chilled sakes I've ever had; it's a little bit drier than most sakes. The other mixed drinks were pretty good as well.  Average for two people was around $350.Five stars if Morimoto was the chef on those nights.,Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I'm happy to be on vacay in one of the biggest foodie towns. We .love. Iron Chef, so we took our NYC resident friend and hopped over to Meat Packing District. Even though we were late for our reservations (darn subway), we were seated pretty quickly. Decor was beautiful, white-based, classy w/ lots of glass. The place held true to it's J-roots, which I expected from Morimoto. Also, proportions were fairly big, especially for this type of restaurant and for Japanese cuisine, which is normally centered on many smaller plates. Very nice. We had:Raw Bar Lobster- Nice, tender, Maine lobster chunks. The sauces were very tasty, they were stand alone good.Tofu Miso - Hugest bowl of life. Bigger than my head! I didn't expect that... Nice fresh tofu, soft and deliciousChirashi Sushi Bowl- Octopus, salmon, roe.. a mountain of fish on a bowl of rice w/ a small miso on the side. Spicy Tuna Maki Roll- The tuna was not chopped up as we traditionally partake it, but the tuna was extremely freshSea Bass Entree- Large piece of fish over tempura avocado. The fish was light and buttery and the tempura avocado was delish. Everything fried is better.Angry Chicken Entree- SO good!!! It had a Japanese-curry flavor and was served over fingerling potatoes, chiles and a chicken jus with a side of mehkrab noodles. The noodles (puffy rice noodles) were salted, and had a good texture in contrast with the tender, juciness of the chicken. Chix was not dry at all and had an awesome taste.White Lily Drink- OMG so delicious. I normally don't really drink the girly drinks, but this one w/ sochu, yuzu and calpico was SO amazing. It was NOT candy sweet, had the right amount of citrus to balance. Finished w/ a lemon twist & lemon peel garnishStrawberry Pistachio Cheesecake w/ Sorbet- Japanese style cheesecake (read: not sweet, not a huge portion) with a very pistachio, nutty flavor served with several sliced strawbs on top. The berry sorbet was VERY berry, a little tart. Served with a side of pink poprocks (can you get any cooler?)Overall, the atmosphere was fun, classy, but not stuck-up. The service was awesome, friendly, and informative. But the best part of all? The restrooms. That's right. Located in the bar area downstairs, they are hidden as they should be. But once you enter a stall, you will find a mirrored wall with glass cherry blossoms appearing to lead down a long corridor (an illusion I suppose!).

1908,S0vnc-AIquEryWlZBLBCBQ,Nich T.,4.0 star rating,"Masaharu Morimoto has been an inspiration for my learning and growth in the kitchen.  I was very excited to finally experience his playful fusion of Japanese ingredients and his love for other Asian and European flavors.  I felt I could best experience his passion and approach to food by ordering an assortment of hot and cold appetizers and a few main dishes.  Toro Tartare and Hamachi Tartare - We ordered both, and I enjoyed the hamachi more.  Beautifully presented on a wooden plank with caviar, the tartare is to be eaten with your preference of wasabi, nori paste, avocado cream, chives, creme fraiche, and rice crackers.Tuna Pizza - One of our favorite appetizers, you can see Morimoto's lighthearted approach to food.  Delicately thin and topped with anchovy aioli, jalapeno, olive, and maguro.Ramen Soup - A big bowl of thin, somen-like noodles with a golden consomme.  Don't expect Japanese ramen, this is Morimoto's take on chicken noodle soup.Spicy King Crab - This was not as spicy as expected with the tobanjian aioli.  Similar to a baked dynamite topping, I didn't enjoy it as much as the others.Kakuni - Kakuni is a popular stewed pork belly dish in the izakayas of Japan.  The ridiculously tender pork combined with the wonderful congee was one of my favorites of the night.Japanese Lobster Fritters - Fried balls of lobster fun, not great but not bad.Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura - Another appetizer that was fun to eat, but I felt it was a little over sauced with the kochujan sauce and the wasabi aioli.Ishiyaki Buri Bop - The rice had delicious slices of hamachi and was cooked at our table.  I wish they had used a real stone pot since the rice didn't get cooked to the crispy layer of goodness that it was intended to be.Surf and Turf - Wagyu filet & hamachi ribbons, herbed potatoes, crushed citrus & avocado prepared tableside.  I had a small sample and it was just ok for me...the wagyu label can sometimes sound better than its flavor.If you're an Iron Chef fan, I'd recommend going a la carte and sampling as much as you can from the regular menu instead of the sushi menu.   I know sushi is a big part of Morimoto's restaurant, but unless he is personally preparing it at the bar, I'd rather enjoy the wonderful choices of his other menu items.  Omakase is an option, but ordering a la carte will give you the freedom to choose and offers bigger portions as well.   We had a wonderful dinner here with great service...now, I hope to one day visit his new restaurant in Napa.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

One complaint: the bathroom sinks were so luxurious I didn't know how to operate them. Anyway the food here is fantastic,I had the fois gras mussels and toro tartare for the appetizer.the fois gras mussels were absolutely explosive in flavor and oddly the mixture of duck liver and mussels were extremely well paired and complimentary whilst bound together by the great teriyaki glaze. the toro tartare was presented great! however, while it was good, it didn't really indicate to me that it was actually TORO I was eating, and not just typical red tuna.Next I had the duck, duck, duck and the surf and turf:The duck duck duck was really tasty, crisp, and tender. I've had good ducks in various Chinese places I've been but this kind of duck really spoke to the kind of quality you were paying for. The fois gras croissant might actually have been my favorite part of the dish; never had something like that before. Surf and turf was decent, more expensive than the duck duck duck but not as impressive. although the wagyu beef was definitely top notch but wasn't mind blowing in the same way the duck was. The turf part of the dish was rather forgettable; it was some fish on a salad, nothing crazy.  As for dessert, 2 things: 1) totally try the tofu cheesecake.2) don't get tea. it was on par with tea I've had at various dim sum joints. but, if you insist let it brew for awhile (i like it strong)awesome dining experiencevery frightening check",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
1912,ehJY6Xe1MN1Ti5Zd7tIr1g,Siemny C.,5.0 star rating,"Morimoto is more than just a restaurant. It's a culinary experience that will tap into all five senses: Sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste.They say you eat with your eyes first. (Not quite sure who ""they"" are, but you know what I mean.) Morimoto's is all about presentation. The food is beautiful, like artwork. And you can be sure my friends and I devoured each and every one of his pieces.We started with half a dozen oysters, each one sauced and ready to go! There was a soy jalapeno sauce, a ginger sauce and a third one I can't seem to recall. Anyway, let me tell you... I am obsessed with oysters. An oyster fiend. Oysters are my crack. I could have eaten two dozen on my own. They were big and oh so delicious. I'm not one to moan and groan with every bite of my food, but I did with these oysters. I even tried to eat them as slowly as I could, so I could savor the flavor and make them last as long as possible. But sadly, they came to an end. It allowed more food to be brought out, but honestly, the oysters were so good, nothing could compare after that. Don't get me wrong. Everything else was good. But it was as if we peaked too soon.Next, we had the hamachi tartare. This is where Morimoto's exquisite presentation becomes evident. The hamachi has been turned into somewhat of a mushy paste and served in a shallow wood box. It is presented on a bed of ice, along with another box filled with several colorful sauces and toppings, for lack of a better word. The only sauces I remember specifically are the wasabi, eel sauce and the miniscule rice balls. In fact, you're so mesmerized by the colors and beauty of the dish, you almost don't want to spoil it by digging in. The hamachi was fresh and tasty, but this dish seemed to be more about delighting in the experience of being able to play with your food, mixing and matching the different sauces and accompaniments with the fish. We also had the Morimoto sashimi. Another gorgeous dish, brought alive with the vibrant colors of fish and tiny squeezable test tubes filled with more sauces. Little pieces of salmon, hamachi, tuna and eel are layered on top of one another and arranged in little squares. Again, this is another fun, interactive dish. The tuna pizza was tasty, with a good amount of spice. We also had the rock shrimp, which is a must have for one of my friends. The rock shrimp is breaded and comes coated with a wasabi sauce and another spicy sauce, along with homemade ranch, which has a strong dill flavor. Being a sushi and sashimi fan, I don't think I would have ordered the rock shrimp on my own, but I did enjoy that the breading was very crispy, and the shrimp not overcooked. In fact, this was our last dish of the evening, and it sat there for awhile because we were so full. I appreciated that the shrimp's breading never lost its crispiness as it cooled down, despite being coated in sauce.Even though we were pretty stuffed, we wanted to try dessert. We ordered the apple turban, at the waiter's suggestion. It's a cinnamon ice cream dish, with very thin slices of baked apple, and some type of cinnamon swirl wafer. The apple slices were perfectly cooked and it was covered in a delicious, buttery sweet sauce.But Morimoto's isn't just about the food. In fact, the experience continues down in the restrooms. They're Japanese toilets, and you can choose your pleasure. Your seat too cold? Just press a button and heat it up. Not into wiping yourself? Well, you can spray either the front or back, and even control the water pressure at the same time. There's a drying feature as well! I literally giggled outloud when I first sprayed myself. That's all I'm gonna say about that. I wish I lived in New York so I could go to Morimoto's again and try more of the sushi and hot entrees on the menu. Based on this one experience, I feel like I've had sushi that is probably just as good in LA. No doubt the fish we ate that night was fresh and flavorful, but it seemed the emphasis was more on the beautiful presentation and playfulness of the dishes. But it's the overall experience, from the gorgeous space of the restaurant, to the hypnotizing plating, attentive but not overbearing service, down to the restrooms  that makes this place deserving of a five star rating.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

""Foie gras was good and oysters were very fresh""  The next thing I know, the waitress keeps on coming back to me and keeps on telling me that they don't have this and that in stock. What I got very upset about is that they didn't let me order omakase which literally stands for ""I'll leave it to you"" and out of the whole sashimi order they brought me only whatever you can find in any other sushi place for much less money like uni, tuna, etc.  I understand that this is not a sushi place but Japanese cuisine includes a lot of seafood.  I understand that the waitress had nothing to do with it so I ordered duck.  She explained to me that its ""valentines day"", they are busy and that's the reason they are out of stock of so many items.  Really?  Valentine's day is not the reason you are out of so many items, since your restaurant is always busy and this is not your first year in operation during Valentines day.  The reason is simple.  You haven't ordered enough in stock because of poor management.  And holidays don't have anything to do with it.  So at the the place where each table pays hundreds of dollars for a simple dinner this is inexcusable.  My local sushi joint has much bigger selection of raw food than whatever I experienced at this so called ""Fine Japanese cuisine"".  So take your menu, rip it in four parts, take one part of it and start handing it out to people to really show them what you have to offer that day.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Presentation is perhaps the biggest difference between Morimoto and a host of other high-end Japanese restaurants.

Beyond aesthetics, however, I think that the food disappoints. Lamb Carpaccio is flavorless, Rock Shrimp Tempura doesn't impress in either of the two Morimoto interpretations (""Buffalo"" has a General Tsao's Chicken type of flavor; ""Wasabi"" is unintentionally subtle), Sushi, an easy benchmark, doesn't measure up to the Yasudas, Garis, or even the Nobus of New York.

I'm going home!"" And as she walks out, she takes $178.43 out of your wallet and slams the door.Yeah that pretty much sums it up. Morimoto is one of the coolest looking restaurants I've ever been to -- the exterior is a huge arc-shaped entryway with bright red curtains that just scream out: ""I'm the Iron Chef, bitch!"" Walking into it, you see a huge wall made of glass bottles that are lit in way where you feel like you're in a P. Diddy music video. Even the bathrooms were awesome -- if you go, you gotta check out the stalls. Morimoto definitely had the best of the best design this place.The food all looked incredible and most of it really was. I went with a friend and we shared an 8-course Omakase tasting dinner and also ordered the ""Duck, Duck, Duck"" entree, the Morimoto Sashimi platter, and a Soft-shell Crab Roll. The Omakase included: (1) Toro tartare, (2) Yellowtail carpaccio, (3) Sushi platter (5 different kinds of sushi), (4) Oyster w/ foie gras & uni, (5) Lightly-seared salmon salad, (6) Lobster, (7) Wagyu kobe beef slices, & (8) some muffin-like dessert with some fruit sorbet. Of all of these, my favorite was definitely the seared salmon. Probably the best piece of raw salmon I've ever had. Everything else was great, but there were a few misses in there.The sashimi platter is awesome. 5 different types of sashimi stacked on top of each other and cut like sushi rolls, so you eat all 5 types of fish in each bite. They also give you 4 different eye droppers with different sauces that you can dip your sashimi into. Really awesome idea, really damn good sashimi. The soft-shell crab roll was incredible as well.Now we all know Morimoto is fat. And now I know why: the ""Duck, Duck, Duck"". This entree is one of the most delicious and, at the same time, life-threatening dishes I've ever had. It's basically a plate of: (1) roasted duck confit, (2) a duck egg sunny-side up, and (3) a huge croissant filled with roasted duck, cucumbers, foie gras spread, and plum sauce. This duck croissant sandwich was INCREDIBLE, but the butter and fat fill up your mouth like you're eating Gushers. I was torn with a mixed emotion of gastrorgasmic joy and sadness that I'm going to leave the restaurant with man boobs.Anyways, Morimoto is amazing with their appearance, plating (you'll see some of the coolest plating ever, especially with the toro tartare and the Morimoto sashimi platter), and service. Most of the sushi was great, but definitely not the best I've ever had -- which is a little disappointing because this was definitely pretty expensive sushi.I left the restaurant with the feeling that I had an awesome experience, with some incredible highlights, but never really achieving that state of ""Wow"". And at the moment when you're almost at that point, the waiter brings you the check. Our bill came out to $178.43 per person after tip. You know it's not a great sign when you start making justifications like: ""Meh, I'm only in NYC so often"" or ""Oh, you only live once."" I wish I had said: ""Only $178.43?! That was so worth it!"" But I didn't.As I slowly walked away from the restaurant, I could hear a faint sound of Iron Chef Morimoto himself saying: ""I ain't a ho!""",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The bathroom by the bar was entertaining, because there were no door knobs so watching people do their pee dance while trying to open the door was pretty darn funny.The food was amazing. I felt like I was sitting at the judging table of Iron Chef. All the dishes we ordered offered so many different textures, and flavors. The presentation of each dish was as beautiful as a work of art. I went with a group of 6 and allowed the waiter to choose the dishes for us. Each dish that came out was interactive, visually intriguing and creative. An example of an interactive dish was the tuna tartar in which the tuna had to be scraped off a wooden block, then put on a cracker, and squeeze different sauces out of a pipette. The tuna pizza was also very creative.I would have given Morimoto 5 stars but we sat at the big long table that seated probably about 20 people with no real dividers. So we were sitting next to strangers and the waiter initially was confused about who was with which party and got the orders all mixed up. In the end the waiter did a fine job. Our group was both satisfied and satiated. The other down side of sitting so close to strangers was that the pack of cougars sitting next to me who were talking about male enhancement drugs, boobs, and how her 15 year old child texted her to see where she was and if she was coming home that night.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Not only is it delicious but also extremely filling. I am not left hungry for more like many of the other omakase s in the city... However yesterday was the first time EVER ordering from the menu... I have to say i was greatly disappointed with the food. The quality of food and the taste was nothing special. Tasted like any average japanese restaurant at 1/2 the price. i ordered the Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura - nothing special hereKakuni ten hour pork. congee, soy-scallion jus - holy f'in crap this was good!Ishi Yaki Buri Bop yellowtail on rice cooked at your table in a hot stone bowl - this was only ok... not that great... i thik with the hot stone bowl the rice continues to cook and burn... so my rice was extremely hard and crunchy. I also ordered the 150 dollar thing of sushi which was a mix of everything. I also didnt find this too special... but the omakase is so much better. Im not sure why but i also feel like the quality of sushi tastes much better too.. it might be mental... but im not sure. last night i was extremely disappointedbottom line is if i was rating the omakase on its own perfect 5the menu items (which should be better since there is more thought placed into menu items) is a 1 or 2... averaging out to a overall.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

For an appetizer, I had the octopus which was seasoned to perfection paired with a nice salad. The romaine lettuce leaves were large, and so it made for some difficulty eating this dish with chopsticks, but if you cut the leaves, then the problem is erased. For my main course, I had a 12 oz NY strip grilled to a Medium rare perfection. The teriyaki sauce that they give is a nice compliment to the meat, but you don't even need it to savor every single bite. And the hot/cold tofu cheesecake was amazing. I don't think I stopped smiling during my entire meal.The waitress that served me and my gf was very helpful with discerning the various terms on the menu and the staff in general were cordial in making the entire dining experience one to remember.

They had been there for New Years Eve and were raving about it. They were very right. Overall comments: Every dish was as much for the eyes as for the pallet. It became obvious that from the design of the restaurant to the flatware and the food, every part of this experience was very well considered. This was a meal to savor and enjoy with as many senses as you could invite. Ordering a few things and sharing is a great way to go and they won't discourage that. Appetizers: White Fish Carpaccio: The White Fish was arrayed toward the bottom of the plate and payed nicely with the warm oil. Toro Tartare: I had seen Chef Morimoto present a similar dish on television and was anxious to try this. You use a flat tool to work out a square of the tuna and then combine it with one of four flavors on a small side dish. The toro pairs beautifully with all accompaniments and each one brings out a different characteristic of the toro. Tuna Pizza: This was an ""engagement gift"" from our server. A crisp won ton shell covered in tuna with an anchovy aioli and what had to be the mildest jalapeno pepper I've ever tasted. The velvety tuna along with the smooth aioli were a nice textural juxtaposition to the won ton and the slight kick from the pepper was just enough of a spicy addition. Kakuni: Japanese Bacon make Japanese Homer very happy. This pork belly fell apart under the weight of your spoon and was served in a scallion congee that balanced the saltiness in the pork with more mild and airy flavors. House Smoked Salmon Ravioli: Leave it to Italians to get raviolis at Morimoto. These are wonderful raviolis, though. The sweetness in the yams and salmon is set off nicely by the fish roe and the yuzu gelee brings it all together nicely. Dinner: 12 oz. Waygu fillet: Served at a perfect medium rare, this cut fell apart nicely with only a little prodding from the knife and fork. It was beef after all. When beef is prepared this well, there isn't much to say but, yum. Braised black cod: Moist and flaky in a ginger soy reduction that set the served the fish well without overpowering it. Line caught halibut: The medium of the three fishes. The black bean sauce and ginger were perfect accents. Sea Bass: My personal favorite. This resilient fish yielded graciously to the prodding of my fork. It was served in a sweet sake sauce with Japanese eggplant, lightly fried. Of all the flavor/texture combinations from that night, this one has stayed with me most indelibly. It was the pinnacle of my night at Morimoto. The design of the restaurant is ingenious. The cocktails were delicious. The house staff was gracious. Our server was patient and insightful. The night was more than memorable.

From the atmosphere at the restaurant (dimly light, modern, elegant and special) to the service and the food....it was an amazing experience. An evening full of wonderous suprises delivered to our table, one after the next :)Here's a breakdown on the courses:1. Tuna Toro Tartare--oh my gosh. This course was delightful. Smooth, silky tuna with an assortment of delicate dipping sauces. Perfect way to start the meal, and left me craving more.2. Eel Salad--Very, very thinly sliced eel with delcate greens and a light seasame- flavored sauce. Mild, fresh flavors and textures.3.Anchovy fondue--Wow, this dish was extremely flavorful. A pot of ceamy anchovy sause with an assortment of dippables. Very playful and unexpected dish in the lineup. I loved it.4. Salmon--One delicious bite of perfectly seared salmon. A bit crispy on the outside, buttery and tender on the inside.5. Homemade Ginger Ale-- A little palate cleanser before the main course.6. 5 pieces of sushi- easily the freshest sushi I have ever had. Simple, delicious.7. Lobster & Wagu Beef--Wow. I usually find lobster tough, no matter how its prepared. Well, Morimoto's lobster was magical. I dont know what his secret is but this lobster was tender and fell apart in my mouth. The beef was the best I've ever tasted (and I dont say this lightly). Buttery and tender, I didn't want this dish to end.8. I forget what this desert was called! But it was long cake-like brownies with two different kinds of sorbet, and covered with a sprinking of caramel popcorn.

We did a little research before hand and weighed the cost of Omakase versus ala carte and decided that we could do better of the menu. Yeah we missed the creative mid courses but we had more food in three courses and some seasonal sushi than we could handle. Everything , including presentation, was amazing. The sushi was fresh, the seasonal varieties a break from the usual, the pipes filled with creative oils/sauces were fun and the entrees masterfully prepared. If there was a disappointment it was in the Duck Three ways. The least special part of the meal by far, but for what it was, it was perfectly executed. Never felt rushed, service was attentive but not obtrusive.

It was near an emergency exit door and security kept coming in and out of it - it was January on a windy night with a wind chill in the NEGATIVES. Because the door kept opening, we (very politely, considering the situation) requested to have our coats brought back to us from the coat check. They brought us the coats, but kept letting security come in out of the emergency exit door. We all ordered soup (which was good!) just to warm us up a bit. Yes. It was that bad. In the restaurant's defense: we did not have reservations. We came in for drinks at the bar downstairs and decided to grab a bite to eat in the dining room upstairs. I believe it's because of the lack-of-reservations that we were given the less-desirable table by the exit. Also, if we weren't freezing and our waiter wasn't having a bad day, we  would have had a MUCH different experience. The food might have even tasted better if we were happy... or at least warm...

Let's just say... they clean you with water ""strategically"" and you can control the temperature. It even airs it off after! THAT'S service. And if your date is gone for a while, now you know why. It wasn't that piece of seaweed in your teeth (I could be wrong).As for the other type of service, waiters and waitresses are enthusiastic and get you amped up to eat some of this famous man's food! As our waitress suggested, I tried the Morimoto Ice Tea. If you put your name on it, it better be damn good. It certainly was. Although the lunch menu is missing a few of the dinner dishes, the Foie Gras and Unagi Bop made up for that, as well as the Chirashi. For $28, you receive two hefty pieces of seared foie gras, scattered unagi pieces, a sauce on the side, as well as a small plate of spices and herbs to adjust the sauce to your liking. That's what I liked most about this restaurant. Morimoto makes food fun. As for the Chirashi dish, how good can a simple rice and assortment of seafood get? REALLY good, that's how much. Half of the bowl was covered in various fish and roe. Even though you pay double the normal price, you receive more than double the quality. The sushi rice was refreshing and full of flavor, but not overwhelming at all.Just a note: If you are trying to kill time before/after your reservation, it's right next to The Chelsea Market. I'd go before you eat so you can look at food and make yourself even more hungry.

WOW.  I mean it's pork belly so already hard to go wrong, but the congee was made using pork stock and yeah, so much delicious pork-ness I couldnt stop eating. After the appetizers we were already full and I could've left happy.  But of course we had to try the entrees so we got the duck served three ways and the sea bass.  The sea bass was in a miso sauce and was very good.  But after a bite of the duck I thought I was in heaven.  The duck itself was cooked perfectly and they served it with a foie gras croissant that was absolutely THE BEST!  For dessert we had raspberry tiramisu with peach gelatin.  The tiramisu was good, but the peach gelatin was soooooo good!  As I write this my girlfriend is remembering how good the congee was and says that she could eat it for the rest of her life.  In conclusion, Morimoto's was the best meal of my life.  Hands down, no contest!  Definitely go if you have the chance but beware: all future meals will be compared with Morimotos and it might be hard to enjoy food as much.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The people were very friendly and polite, though I am always bothered by the dishes being served with English names before the Japanese ones are given. Sometimes, I understand what the Japanese name means more than the English translation.  The bathrooms are magical.  I have NEVER said this about a bathroom before, but they have TOTO toilets. They are warmed, and have water jets and air drying.  Please, find a reason to use the bathroom!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Plus the Toto style Japanese toilet seats....  The bathrooms are located on the lower floor where the bar is, can be a bit hard to find. -- for regular omakase: $150 each, my friend decided to get the $300 version and wine pairing (I don't drink though).  The dinner took over 4 hours and cost over $800..

The decor is fabulously modern, and I loved the walls of water bottles, which turned something mundane into something beautiful and exotic. I tried the oyster with foies gras and uni, and the morimoto sashimi, since those are the signature dishes. Perhaps I'm too much of a purist but I felt like when you take that many ingredients and throw them together in one dish the distinct and wonderful flavor of each individual item is lost. When I are the first piece of oyster I couldn't taste the uni at all, it was overpowered by the sauce. So I ate the rest piece by piece and the oyster, foies gras, and uni were sublime on their own. They didn't need the heavy-handed eel sauce. The same was true of the sashimi. Why stack salmon, eel, mushroom, yellow, etc together? The flavors are not enhanced by eating them together. I also ordered a few sushi pieces a la carte, and they were all very fresh and tasty. I think my boyfriend had better luck with his dishes, beef carpaccio and the duck.

The bartenders know everything and treat you great (as you will be their biggest tip of the evening). But they really are terrific and friendly people.Cool atmosphere. Cool bathrooms. Really good mixed drinks which are especially good if you are sitting and chatting with the bartender who is making your drink in front of you.Just order what they suggest, but heavy on the appetizers.

Anyway, my friends and I were pleasantly surprised by our dinner experience at Morimoto. Yes, I purposely use the phrase ""dinner experience"" because thats exactly what it is, you take your time here, you savor the flavors, and you soak in the ambiance.  As for the food, we got the famous toro tartare (colorful! tasty! 6 different flavors to dip your tartare in!), duck duck duck, lobster with red miso, and a few rolls. For dessert we had an interesting concoction made from tobacco, popcorn, creme, and caramel? Every dish was beautifully prepared, tasted fantastic, and we were given a brief summary on each by our lovely hostess who was extremely knowledgeable about the food.

I even asked her if I could have some time to look at it, and she still kept muttering different items to drink. I really just wanted to be left alone.... Which was hard, because we were seated so close to the next table, we might as well have been a part of their party.  It was pretty awkward, considering we were spending $120/person, the space would have been nice.I would say, for the price, it wasn't worth it.  The portions were small, there were only around 6 courses, and it's the first time I've had an omakase, and not been full or satisfied afterwards.I love Morimoto as a chef, and I'd love to cook with him and for him one day, but what they've done with his restaurant (since it's obvious he isn't apart of it, but just capitalizing off of it) is a shame because I know he can do better.Food did taste good, overall.Not really the kind of dining you'd do if you want privacy.It's definitely casual, but casual where you don't mind spending way too much for good sushi.Nobu was better.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Food was mostly good, Our group was a mix in terms of sushi expertise, so the very nice waitress picked a good combination for us to share. Toro Tartar is interesting, but kind of bland, Scallop special with pea shoot was excellent, Uni sushi was very fresh and tasty, steamed chicken was horrible, well, just like rubber, whitefish capaccio is ok (but I only remember the greens), roast pork with Chinese congee is a very tasty combo, grilled cod was wonderful, highlight of the meal, We also had a few sushi rolls, not bad, but nothing to write home aboutDessert was very pretty. Interesting combination of flavor. I don't quite like wasabi raspberry sorbet flavor though. Chocolate cake with popcorn topping is so good, we left no crumb behind.

Then,Morimoto is for you!I went here to celebrate a friend's birthday. Just finished eating as a matter of fact! First off, yes, it's expensive but it is worth the price only if you don't concentrate on ordering only Sushi.To drink:Mornimoto's 5 year aged Sake - pretty good. Honestly, I haven't had that many Sake's in my life but this has been the best. But for $70 it had better be. I felt it was worth it.For starters: Spicy Tuna Roll - very good, but I have had similar quality elsewhere for cheaper.Wagyu Beef Tartar - wow, simply wow. But prepare to see the smallest plate in the entire place. It is tiny. But it is Wagyu beef and that's what you're paying for.Some Egg Custard with Foie Gras - I looooved this but my girlfriend didn't like it at all. If ""Foie Gras Creme Brulee"" sounds good to you, order it. You will love it.Entree:Something Ocean Trout - Fish that felt like butter. And i don't mean it was covered in butter, it was just perfectly cooked and tasted very good.Surf and Turf - Got my Wagyu beef rare (I ordered it that way) and it was very good. There was some salad with seafood and that was just terrific.Desserts:Warm Chocolate Cake with Popcorn Ice cream - the cake is what you would expect but we got it because of the Popcorn Ice cream and it didn't dissapoint. It's weird to be eating ice cream that tastes like popcorn, but it's a good weird. Very delicious. But savor it, it is tiny.Coconut Panacatta - Best part of the meal for me. I am a huge fan of Passion Fruit and this dessert was a must get for me. One of the bowls will have the actual coconut panacatta topped with a thin layer of passion fruit jelly. Simply amazing. The other bowl is passion fruit noodles (seriously) with Basil ice cream. i kid you not. It sounds weird. Your brain will be confused but it is just fun to eat.Service was excellent. Total for everything was (with 16% tip) $275. It was worth every penny. Definately going back. Did i mentioned WE MET MORIMOTO HIMSELF and took pictures? Oh yeah!Pros: Morimoto was there.

The beef was prepared with a teriyaki glaze that masked the quality of the beef but at least the bento box came complete with a silken tofu miso soup and salad.The ambiance is nice, gorgeous new age decor that exuded a sense of classy professionalism.  The restroom was impressively equipped with Japanese 'equipment' but that was about the most Japanese the place got. I would classify this restaurant as more fusion than Japanese.I glanced at the drinks list, pretty impressive albeit slightly overpriced. The Morimoto tea was deliciously infused with tea. I think I would have enjoyed the regular menu more than the consolidated prefixed menu offered during restaurant week.

1993,XI0uF1bRkmkldCcFK-8MLg,Jul K.,3.0 star rating,"I was surprised on my birthday by my (totally awesome) husband for an Omakase for two at Morimoto's, his with the sake pairing.We started with the toro tartar which was great, but we had to wait approximately 45 mins for the 2nd course, which in our book is completely unacceptable for a meal that's over $100 per person (more so for an iron chef restaurant!)Following the toro tartar came several uninspired dishes that I can't even remember - one of the few that I do was a scallops dish. I was hoping for larger scallops, but instead received several tiny ones which was disappointing (the sauce, however, was pretty good).Also, if I'm paying for an omakase I would expect to be getting my money's worth.  So naturally when I was served a fondue dipping sauce with a handful of raw veggies I was in disbelief. I thought, hey maybe it's surprisingly delicious - let's give it a try. However, what I got was exactly what I saw.  And to top it off the fondue sauce was thick, salty and plain gross. The only dish that really impressed me was the Oyster Foie Gras. Now THAT  was the quality of food I was expecting the entire menu to be like. Too bad it was 1 tiny bite that disappeared into my mouth at the blink of my husband's eye!As for the decor - I loved it - very trendy, but I must say to pay all that money at a nice restaurant I need a little more space. I hate to feel like I'm being sandwiched between 2 couples in a corner when all I'm trying to do is have a nice and memorable night out in town. Overall, very disappointing experience, and will likely NEVER go back. If you must, go with the a la carte - my husband recommends the Ishiyaki Buribap? and their rock shrimp tempura.

The miso, salad, and vegetable sushi are nothing special either. So boo to the food, I though Morimoto had more skill then this. If you can't cook vegetarian food don't even bother putting anything on the menu, it makes you look like an amateur.

1997,X6oUnzNhKS8eaBx4UKbfIQ,Cherylynn N.,5.0 star rating,"5 STARS--POSSIBLY ONE OF THE BEST MEALS I'VE EVER HAD! I love Iron Chef Morimoto even before he was on the U.S. version of Iron Chef, so I was super excited to try his restaurant during my NYC trip in April. I had the Omakase (Chef's 8 course tasting menu): 1. Toro Tartar: YUMMY! I loved the presentation: toro was presented like one of those mini zen gardens. It was slabbed on a piece of wood. Then condiments like small crunchy rice balls, seaweed, and wasabi were rolled up and placed on another piece of wood. Then, there was a something similar to a rake, so you can take some condiment and some toro. The toro was BUTTERY and the condiments added a great texture contrast. 2. Hamachi Sashimi with Ginger Chili: Oh-my! I love Hamachi and I love spicy foods; so this was the perfect combo! 3. Seared Kampachi w/ Mango Chutney: I normally like my fish 100% Raw! However, the slightly seared Kampachi added a layer of smokiness to the buttery fish--yummy! And, the mango chutney added just an extra flavor of sweetness and citrus which balanced everything out. 4. Assorted Nigiri (8): I can't recall all of the different types of fish, but I can say the quality of ALL of them was superb--very fresh and buttery! 5. Oyster with Uni and Foie Gras: OMG!!! Ok, so I LOVE uni and foie gras. But together???? Absolute HEAVEN! The flavor combos are indescribable: buttery, rich, salty, sweet. 6. Melon Palate Cleanser: Honeydew slushy with a cream fraiche--very refreshing! 7. Kobe Steak and Grilled Lobster: the kobe was perfectly cooked to a med. rare and was very TENDER; no need for a knife. The lobster was seasoned with a curry spice. I thought it would be overpowering, but it wasn't. It added a great kick to the sweet succulent lobster. 8. Pumpkin Souffle w/ Chestnut Ice Cream: My least fav of all the dishes. The souffle was more of a sponge cake and didn't really go well with the ice cream. The tasting menu was $120 which was worth EVERY PENNY considering the quality and the amount of food you receive. SERVICE: All the you would expect for a foo foo restaurant. Staff was attentive, explained all dishes, but of course was a bit pretentious. AMBIANCE: Decor was very shee shee--it's NYC after all! I loved the sushi bar--it was at least 20-25 feet long and all the fish laid out looked fresh from the sea. It wasn't too loud, so it was very easy to hold a convo w/o raising your voice.

There's not a single thing that disappointed here - everything from the special bonito appetizer (silky smooth fish), the surf and turf platter (beef and pieces of raw fish), the cod, and the tofu cheesecake trio dessert - it was all incredible, and also very artfully presented. The cocktails are also very inventive, and they certainly do not rip you off as they are quite strong!The bonito appetizer and the tofu cheesecake were my favorite things here, along with the miso marinated cod entree. A lot of people are wary of tofu, but in this cheesecake, it gives the cake a lightness that cheesecake definitely needs. This is the lightest cheesecake you will ever eat, and it is perfectly sweetened. The bonito appetizer was probably the best piece of raw fish I'd had in my life. My friend and I wanted to get the blowfish, but unfortunately it was out of season, so instead we got this. We have no regrets ordering that. The cod was pretty spectacular - perfectly marinated with the most amazing flavor. I don't think cooked fish could get better than that.On a side note, the bathroom is very cool. I love the toilets! One bad thing that happened was that they mixed up our orders - we'd actually ordered the duck duck duck entree instead of the cod, but the cod was so good when it came out that we decided to forget asking for the duck.

I really wanted to stay forever curious and intrigued at what delights maybe hiding through those large doors. ::sighs:: The space is beautiful and I do appreciate the fact that they will try to find you a seat if your a walk in. We were seated in less then 10 minutes at the sushi bar. They make you take off your shoes to enjoy a more authentic experience, and I wasn't complaining at the heat lamps under the table. For decor and ambiance Morimoto is definitely a 5 star restaurant hands down.

Strip away everything though and what you have left is the food and that is why they lose a star. We started with the Crispy Rock Tempura. The shrimp is heavily covered in batter and I will say at first taste I was blown away. It was really good! So I experimented with the spicy kochujan sauce, then the wasabi anoli.......and great.......at first. Like all things that are REALLY good at first (As I have so harshly learned in my life) they tend to become really really shitty really really quickly. The taste becomes overwhelming after 3 or 4 pieces and I just felt sick of the taste, sick of the texture, and sick overall. Sushi is awesome but I  wanted to see what this Iron Chef is made of so I opted to chose a dish instead. With a name like Ishi Yuri Buri Bop and a description that tells me they are going to cook my yellow tail right at my seat - you'd think this would be one ultra fun cool dish. DISH FAIL- Basically the waiter brought over a very hot bowl and then proceeded to press strips of Yellow tail to it until it's cooked. Ok the presentation is a bit dull but the flavor is even duller! Basically rice and barely cooked yellow tail- nothing really mind blowing at all......and definitely not ""orgasmic"" to quote the guy I'm dating. His sushi was fresh which anyone ingesting uncooked food can appreciate but again nothing to do cartwheels over. Perhaps I chose the wrong dish, or I expected too much from Morimoto.

The reservation was made 3 days ago so it wasn't incredibly hard to make; however, the table wasn't quite ready when we arrived so we waited about 15 min at the bar downstairs. Four of us ordered an appetizer, two main courses, plus one ""morimoto omakase"" (chef's choice). They allowed us to order just one tasting menu, so that's pretty nice. For appetizer we had the ""tuna pizza."" I thought it was a very interesting dish, and I liked it. I wish there could be more ""tuna"" though, but it's just me. We had ""sea bass"" and ""ishi yaki buri bop"" for the main courses. The sea bass was really tender and well-seasoned. The ishi yaki buri bop is just like Korean bim bip bap where you mix meat, vegetable, and rice together with special sauce. The raw fishes were heated and cooked against the hot stone bowl. Personally I like the sauce and semi-cooked sashimi :DNow let's talk about the morimoto omakase. The portion was definitely not for 4 people, but oh well, we just want to ""taste"" it.toro tartare: the presentation was really cool. It differs from the usual tartare that you actually mix your own toro meat and all the garnishes. sashimi salad: more like...sashimi and a couple leaves; not too impressed.fluke slices: same as above. I think it's so-so.oyster foie gras: didn't get to taste this one (as it was shared among 4 of us) but it did look delicious!sushi set: I had the tuna and ikura (salmon roe) nigiri.

I stuck with K1 and tonics, but did venture at the end of the meal to try a flight of Morimoto sake. Pretty intense. Definitely a great place to try, even if you cant afford the $130 tasting menu every night.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Morimoto was one of them and I was quite happy with the choice.I started with the house salad which was a pretty standard dish, nothing to rave or complain about. The entree, sea bass, was the one that blew me away. The fish was perfectly cooked, very tender and well seasoned.  The portion was just right. I hate it when restaurants give you tapa sized dishes as an entree. I was very satisfied with the sea bass that I'd say it was indeed the best sea bass I'd ever had in a Japanese restaurant.For the dessert I had some fruity sorbet. It was refreshing and decent. I took off one star because they charged me $8 for hot green tea, which was usually free in Japanese restaurants. The waiter asked me what I'd like to drink when I settled down at my table. I said hot green tea like I always did in Japanese restaurants. He didn't mention a word about the price. I assumed it was free and IT WASN'T. It was a pricy $8 cup of tea!!Despite that stupid tea, my experience at Morimoto was quite delightful. 4 stars!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

2022,NSV7-ZJMu6bTg276R25k1Q,Red J.,3.0 star rating,"Went and did the chef's omakese and I was fairly disappointed by it.  The food provided was great however at a japanese restaurant, I was really hoping for more of a concentration on sushi and sashimi... but that wasn't what I got.  When I asked our waitress about the chef's omakese she explained that we would be getting an appetizer, sashimi, sushi, intermezzo, main entree (which was a surf and turf), and dessert.  Sounds great right?  Sounds like a lotta food right? WRONG.  I really enjoyed our appetizer which was the toro tartare, it was delicious.  Then came our ""sashimi,"" when I think of the sashimi dish, I was expecting a little plate of maybe 4 different fish.  Instead we got seared fluke and scallop.  Naturally I was a bit disappointed.  But the food itself was never bad, the fish was fresh and very tasty.  There was also an oyster with foie gras and uni.  I really would have enjoyed this dish if the oyster was raw and the uni was left unseared.  Other than that, I normally don't enjoy foie gras, I liked it in this dish.  The sushi was next and while each of the 5 pieces they provided was yummy, especially barracuda, I was hoping for more sushi.  Before our entree came out, our waitress noticed that I preferred sushi and sashimi as opposed to the surf and turf so she asked if I wanted to stick to raw food for my entree.  I was incredibly surprised that she gave me this option and, of course, jumped at the chance.  But when my ""raw"" dish came out, I WAS GREATLY DISAPPOINTED.  I was expected another sushi course or some sashimi... I got hamachi with rice in a hot stone bowl, the hamachi was then seared by the hot stone bowl by the waiter...  had i known this was going to be my ""raw"" course I totally would have stuck with the surf and turf.  This was a total RIP!  The bf's turf was pretty awesome though.  The wagyu steak was simply delicious!  And while my rice and seared hamachi was yummy, it definitely wasn't worth it to replace the surf and turf.  The tofu cheesecake for dessert was excellent!  NOW was my meal worth the $120 (excluding tax and tip, and it was $120 per person not total)  NO!  Did I think bf's meal with the surf and turf was worth it?  ehh.... not really but more so than mine.  I was really hoping for a sushi and sashimi focus especially for the amount of money I was shelling out and it was what we got at all.  It kind of makes me even more irritated because I asked our waitress prior to ordering about the focus of the chef's omakese because to me it seemed like the sushi and sashimi was more of an appetizer to the entree which was the focus of the tasting.  She said the only thing that's really cooked is the lobster and steak and the rest was mainly raw dishes... which was half true.  Aside from my 5 pieces of sushi and the appetizer, everything else was essentially cooked or were prepared in a way that was not like traditional sushi/sashimi.So my advice for people like me who want more of a sushi/sashimi fish focus, get the chef's combination sushi/sashimi choices, you'd probably be more content!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

As our server told us, it would be a wonderful introduction to Morimoto. Our server Deliah was great, explained everything, checked on us often, chatty but not in an annoying way. However my only service complaint was that a number of times our food came before the wine, which is annoying if you're trying to do the pairing. But I digress, onto the food. The first course was tuna belly, amazing presentation and very tasty. Next up was oyster and foie gras, this was my least favorite dish. I found the sauce very sugary sweet and I am not a fan of foie gras anyway. Third was the salad dish micro greens with flounder, very light and fresh. Fourth was the sushi course, snapper, baracuda, hawaiian white fish, and tuna belly. Very nice presentation again and great sushi. Fifth was the surf and turf, lobster with a creme fraiche and wagyu beef with yams. This was spectacular, words can't describe. The beef was melt in your mouth good, the yams were tasty as well. The lobster is spicy but the creme fraiche cools it nicely. Last was desert, carmel, chocolate ganache over a cookie. Very nice desert. I wish I could remember all the wine pairings, there was at least one sake. You have to go to the bathroom! This is very funny. Multifunctional toilet that is heated! Hysterical, I made friends with a women in the bathroom over how amazing it is!Overall, really good experience. Good food, good service.

2031,A-Y6PSCEu7Qz1oxwIfCmvw,eLLe D.,4.0 star rating,"So. Made it out here yesterday, thurs evening, around 9:15 ish, after drinks. Been meaning to stop by for a while, but rarely make it to 10th ave. Restaurant week was the extra push that finally sent us. Turns out they weren't participating in the restaurant week for dinner, only lunch. Womp. Anyway, arrive without reservations, party of 2. Place was full, 30 min wait for seating. Went dwnstr to have more drinks as we wait. Bar was packed too. Older crowd with expense accounts, fresh from work still talking about what happened in the office. DRINKS:Friend had some dragon drink with bacardi rum, mint, lime, and raspberry. Basically a raspberry mojito. It was fine i guess, but we hate mint and mojitios. I always try to go for sake when im dining japanese but my stomach wasnt in the mood for games. I went for a glass of their Rose since I wasnt feeling daring after our previous cocktails at Raines Law Room, just wanted to eat. Rose was fine. BATHROOM:While down there I had to rush to the bathroom, then i realized oh yea, THE bathroom that everyone talks about, lets see what this is about... So. I didnt like that i had to pull a huge sliding door to get in. Not very sanitary. Once i relieved myself i was able to take it in a bit. Theres three stalls. The infinity mirror with the cherry blossoms is indeed nice. Now, the toilet. I went from stall to stall trying to figure how to work this thing. Finally was able to flush. As for the rest, none of the buttons were working for me. The strip of buttons actually fell off in one of the stalls. I grew confused and my legs grew tired of squating. Then randomly in the last stall, a surprising stream of warm water hits me where the sun dont shine, and I dont know how i felt about it. Things got messy before i could decide. Long story short, the bathroom is a bit overrated, and the toilets are unenjoyable unless you pause to read the manual before hand, and you are ok with sitting on public toilets. Not I. Nice try tho.SEATING:Pleasant man from the entrance came to get us 9:45 sharp, and escorted us to our table. I hated it. We were in a corner with a wall in my face. If we're paying non-restaurant week prices, Im gonna need a lil atmosphere guys. Communicated this immediately to our super cool waiter. He arranged for a seat change in 15 mins. We began our appetizer and they switched us over asap. The new table was still not the best, but better. I had a decent view of everything and the chefs preparing food. I want to sit on the floor next time, they have seats surrounded by glass. Looks nice. Overall decor was white, silver, glass, and wood. Jazzy music.DINNER:Our waiter had made some strong recommendations from the menu. We went with the shrimp rock tempura appetizer, would choose entrees later once we switched tables. It was freaking deLISHous. Then again, we were kind of ravenous. Twas a rectangle plate with three sections, 2 filed with the shrimp tempura glazed in 2 different sauces, the last had a dipping sauce for it with a few pieces of celery. We were almost going to order a second.Once we switched tables, we got a different waiter, not as gnarley as our first, but still fine. For entrees he went w/ the angry chicken, i went w/ the black cod. These entrees come solely as described, no sides, so we ordered the white rise side and the market vegetable side as per the waiters high recommendation. I also ordered a california roll for the hell of it, to ensure that i was stuffed. The waiter recommended the roll come out before the entrees, and i agreed. But it didnt. It came at the end. and that kind of bothered me since i devoured my cod so quickly and didnt get to really enjoy it as i would have if i had the roll to slow me down. Anyway, my black cod was nice, in a sweet glaze, kind of like a teriyaki, really soft, couldnt eat it with the chopsticks had to use a fork cause it kept falling apart. Good stuff. The market vegetables turned out to be just corn on the cob with seasonings. I dont really like corn, especially on the cob, it just difficult and not worth the trouble. Will just go for the chinese brocoli next time. The 4th and only other side option was bok choy. Wish they at least had a  fried rice option, sheesh. My friends Angry chicken was ok. Just chicken with a sort of tangy aftertaste. I wouldnt order it, but its an op for those who dont eat seafood, like my friend. The roll was nicely sized, a lil bigger than usual. Real crab meat, not the imitation. Fresh & clean seafood. To finish off i had one more glass of Rose and the flourless chocolate cake to share. Was ok. The cream and crispies taste good together. Also came with a scoop of peach sorbet. all very interesting, but no need to do it again. I was stuffed and bursting at seems. Bill was sizeable, but doable - To me.

Our server dropped off our menus and water and then we didn't see her for another 7 minutes or so. We took our time reading the menu, we wanted to make sure we had the best dining experience. We ordered the lamb carpaccio and sea eel sashimi for appetizers. I ordered the whole roasted lobster ""epice"" and my boyfriend ordered the surf and turf for entrees. The lamb carpaccio was good. I wouldn't order it again though. Didn't blow me away. My boyfriend tried the eel and he loved the whole bite. The surf and turf was also good and if you order it, ask for the filet rare. Medium rare left the filet too dry. The star of that dish though was not the surf or the turf but rather the potatoes. The potatoes seemed as if they were sautéed with cinnamon butter.

Almost a week later it's all I can think about.  The lobster fritters were a big hit, with the less adventurous eaters at the table and the amateur foodies.  The smoked salmon ravioli was fishier than we had hoped but the salad with tuna flakes was a stunner.  The sashimi appetizer with its tubes of sauce is served as little layered cubes of fish and in order to really swoon over it, we ate each piece separately, salivating over every last bite.  I tried the black cod, steak, chicken and Chilean sea bass for the main course and can say hands down, the Chilean sea bass is the best I've ever had.  The steak was tender, juicy and full of flavor, again pandering to the most inexperienced palettes and the most eager palettes all at once.  The chicken was delicious but had a significant kick to it.  The black cod was very good and the person next to me preferred that above the sea bass, but to me there was no contest. The lychee martinis were satisfying and sweet but nothing prepared me for the dessert.  I only wish I had more room in my belly!  Flourless chocolate cake with caramel covered popcorn?  Amazing.  I'm just counting the moments until I can return to you, Morimoto, please keep a self-cleaning, heated toilet seat warm for me!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The clean, fresh feeling in Morimoto is an excellent compliment to the fish and delicate Japanese dishes. Seated at our table of four for lunch, I appreciated the glass dividers between the tables which created a sense of exposed privacy. Our waiter was incredibly quick with water and advice. Though it was restaurant week he encouraged us to try to bento boxes since they were a better bang for your buck. I love the honesty there. For $24 I ordered the black cod bento box, one of the discounted sakes and our table shared the spicy tuna and uni avocado rolls. Starting with the sake, cool and perfectly sweet - well chosen by the restaurant. Both rolls were incredible and though they were pretty common maki options, I really had never tried a better version of either roll. The bento box included:- miso soup: the tofu was filmy and soft, fragrance was drool-worthy- salad: didn't really try it, nothing special- a soft-shell crab maki roll accompanied by tuna, shrimp, and salmon nigiri - teriyaki black cod with a few sweet red beans: omg...yum- vegetable and shrimp tempura: again, I actually felt like it was the best version of tempura I've ever had. Not greasy and perfect crunch. One drawback was the mayo-like sauce at the bottom...reminded me of...something else. Finally, I have to give the bathrooms some well-deserved attention.

One issue came up, though, when my friend complained that the seaweed on her hand roll was chewey, not crisp, as it should be.  She's Japanese living in Asia, so she would be a good judge of what is good seaweed.  They got her a new roll, but unfortunately, the server kept bringing up the issue throughout the rest of the meal.  He said that the head chef is looking at her from behind the door, that they have something for her now, asking if everything was all right to the point of being annoying.. very unprofessional service for such a nice place.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Yes, blowfish!  I frequent the ""Blowfish Restaurant"" in SF, and they don't even have blowfish!  They serve it ""4 ways"" here...hahaha...I guess this is an Asian thing.  Anyhow, served: Sashimi the body, Shread the skin, Deep fry the fins, Soak the bones in Hot Sake.   Wow, wow, wow, wow.  It's a must try.  And contrary to popular belief, you DO NOT need to sign a release of liability....hahaha.Saga and Rice in Stone Pot - So dish after dish, I was impressed and didn't think the next would top the prior...but indeed this one did.  Saga, apparently is only served in one restaurant in the US, and that's at Morimotos.  Stuff melts in your mouth.  We stared at each other, speechless.  Orgy in your mouth...yes.Tri Color Sorbet - Perfectly flavored, even the ""I don't want dessert, I don't want dessert"" person loved it.The damage: a little over $300  - Not bad at all!!Did I mention decor was awesome...and so is the cleaning toilet...LOL.  Yes, I'm devirginized.  I tried the water spraying, pulsating toilet....",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

2049,kM2gKDlSZk7LCZBCAGIElQ,Christine W.,5.0 star rating,"This has become my most favorite sushi and japanese restaurant I have ever been to. I visited during Restaurant Week for lunch, however also ordered regular menu items. Usually RW specials do not compare and are not the most representative of the actual restaurant, this is the case for Morimoto as well. The RW menu consisted of a small bite-sized appetizer, bento box and a berry panna cotta. These items were still good, but did not blow my socks off. For the Bento Box, you got your usual citrus-ginger salad, tempura, miso soup, assorted sushi and sashimi and a choice of black cod, kalbi beef (and something else that I can't remember at the moment). I considered this my filler foods to make me full in addition to the small tastes of the featured items reviewed below. I also ordered the Morimoto Iced Tea which was very light and refreshing (little to no sweet but had fresh fruit infused flavor).The experience from start to finish was amazing. As you walk in, you can't help but be amazed with the clean, open and modern look. Though seemingly minimalistic, it has a lot of fine details. Everything is white and each table is separated with glass walls to ensure a little bit of privacy between each party. The chairs were quite heavy, I had trouble moving them but it just showed that Morimoto didn't try to go cheap even with the little details of his decor. The side walls looked like white curtains but were solid fiber glass and the entire interior was lit with halogen spot lights. And last but not least... Coolest thing... clear chopsticks! Going on to the bathrooms, they were another experience in itself. The backdrop of each stall had an optical illusion of a 3D tunnel of (hibiscus?) flowers that looked like it just went on and on. The toilets were the japanese style ones that had bidet functions and automatic seat warmers. The entire wait staff was very hospitable and extremely knowledgable about the food, ingredients and the restaurant itself. It makes you wonder if Morimoto has some kind of boot camp or intense training for his entire staff across all of his restaurants.Must have appetizers include Toro Tartare and Foie Gras Oysters. They were absolutely divine and just the thought of these items have me salivating as I am writing this review. The Toro Tartare had an amazing presentation with the tartare itself spread onto a wooden plank and erected diagonally on a bed of ice. While resting horizontally on the side is a palate of dips neatly organized on a rectangular mini-tray consisting of various dipping pastes: wasabi, seaweed, sour cream, avocado, chives and rice crunchies. Small metal flat spoons were used to eat the tartare. This was quite the experience in one appetizer.The Foie Gras Oysters had the deliciousness of fresh oysters with a kick of umami from the sauce and foie gras. Another great must-have Sensory experience.Just to throw in a little more food to make sure we were full, we ordered the spicy tuna and spider rolls. These aren't anything special and are items you can find at any sushi place. I must say however, the spicy tuna roll here was the best I have ever had. There was something about the freshness of the fish (emitted absolutely no fishiness and had a clean finish with no unpleasant linger aromatic notes) along with an extra sumthin-sumthin that put almost a bit of smokiness in the flavor of the salmon. I wasn't sure exactly what it was but it made the roll stand out from the rest of the other spicy tuna rolls i've had before. In terms of price, it really wasn't any different from your typical sushi restaurant. I think the spicy salmon roll was something like $8 and the spider roll under $15 (I may be wrong on these numbers but they were definitely very inexpensive). If you're in the mood for a couple simple rolls, I would say it would be more worth it to scrap any other sushi and just go to Morimoto.i would love to come back next time for an omakase meal. For everyone else visiting or in NYC... or even in any of the other cities Morimoto has tapped into, this place is worth the visit. Very highly recommended!And i have to add... 100x better than Nobu... :X",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I went to this restaurant with a bunch of my friends. 9 people.Since we' were a big group, I could taste different menus. However, the dinner was totally wastful.Spending my time and a lot of money, for something so average or lower than average, is not good, at all.First of all, the interior design was cool, but not impressive. We sat at the table downstairs. I know that place is for drink, but the chairs are so uncomfortable. I felt like I'm about to fall at the chair.  Service was just ok, but they totally forogot my drink. And I could get it when everyone almost finished their foods and drinks.Detail things, like utensils and food cordinations, I think they are trying to be fancy, but seriously not fancy at all. Their clear milky chopsticks are cute, but doesn't look expensive and they are too light. We ordered Morimoto beer, and they sereved it with their own bottle and wine glass. The bottle was cute, but I'm sure that they could've got some fancy and cute beer cup, instead of wine glass. It just looks like they're 'TRYING' to be fancy.The most important thing, food!!! Honestly, the foods were not bad, but not good. They are either so average, or 'Memorable' because it was extremely salty.  Too much teriyaki flavor for oyster dish w/ uni and foie gras. I tryied to taste those lovely ingrdients, but they totally lost their flavor.The rests are not memorable. Only sashimi was good.My main dish was trout and it was too salty. Servers kept filling up my water glass, but I was so thirsty on my way back home. Even rolls that my friend ordered was salty too.About drinks. I didn't taste all of them, but nothing special about Morimoto beer which was 34 dollars per bottle. I love infused vodka, so I ordered Morimojito cocktail which I got at the end, was just like waterdown vodka. They said Wasabi infused vodka and some sake, but it's just like a cucumber shochu that I had in Ktown. We might've chosen wrong menus, but these kind of restaurant should not have bad menus.

The creativity was all there - flavor, ingredients and presentation-wise.Ok, so yes, a Morimoto Omakase experience for three people costs a little more than a 16GB iPad 2 - but trust me when I say... it's worth it. We started our meal with a White Lily Cocktail made with Calpico and Meyer lemons. It was light, lovely and brought me back to my childhood. I was obsessed with Calpico back then. We were also served a Toro Tartare with osetra caviar, fresh wasabi, avocado cream, nori paste and a small furry Japanese plum that is rarely seen in the U.S. Next came the Warm Tilefish Carpaccio with hot oil and mushrooms then the Anchovy & Garlic fondue with veggies.The aromatic plate was really special - It had an oyster, uni and a perfectly seared piece of foie gras in a teriyaki sauce, sitting on a bed of sea salt, star anise, cinnamon, and Szechuan peppercorns. It was sensory overload (in a good way) - it smelled great, tasted amazing and I loved all the silky rich textures.Chef's sushi plate came next. The mackerel with spicy onions was the best. This was also where they gave us an intermezzo of homemade gingerale with lime that cleansed our palate before the main course.The Surf and Turf was our main entree - Wagyu on Caramelized Sweet Potatoes and curried Spiny Lobster with Yuzu Crème Fraiche. I devoured every last bit of this and had to fight the urge to lick the lobster shells clean. Completely out of this world.

At the prices they charge, things should be perfect. I've been to a decent amount of places that *do* charge the prices they charge, and the experience *was* perfect. Instead, I was surprised to receive the smallest cuts of fish I've ever seen actually served. I'd have opted for some sort of ""we'll actually give you more than a scrap of fish"" upcharge, but there didn't seem to be one available. The result was a sort of ""Where's Waldo"", but with tiny pieces of fish instead of Waldo and your mouth instead of the board. It's hard to actually taste the sushi under such circumstances. I ordered two waves of nigiri, about 10 pieces total, and the seared scallop appetizer (which, to be fair, was amazing and decently proportioned), and left very disappointed and vaguely hungry.I didn't have any of their other dishes, so I can't speak to those. For all I know, they're great. Also, to be fair, I haven't had any particularly good sushi here on the east coast, so maybe it's just a common theme.I was going to put this down as 2 stars, but the service was good, so 3 it is.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Gorgeous hostesses- checkInsanely beautiful interior decorating- checkCelebrity awareness or frequency- checkHype- checkCarefully crafted food too pretty to eat- checkOverall, a wonderful meal. I think this could have been a disappointing meal if not for the fact that I cheated a bit. A good friend of mine has been serving here for some time  so I texted her and asked her for the restaurant's best dishes (objectively speaking.)....And I am really glad I did or else I think Morimoto would have received fewer stars.We started off with the Toro Tartare. Toro is the less frequented fatty tuna generally found in higher quality Japanese restaurants. Usually more expensive, Toro is definitely worth the price.This one was a work of art. Literally.Instead of chunks of Tartare as per the norm, Morimoto's comes pressed into a wooden board and served in a huge glass bowl of shaved ice. There is another small board with different mousse garnishes (a wasabi, an avocado, a teriyaki-type paste, and a creme fraiche).They came with tiny spoons perfect for ensuring that you properly scoop that ""one-lick"" portion each and every time.Honestly speaking, the Toro was a little lost in the garnishes and I didn't get the same oomph that I usually get from a good tartare. Unfortunately the beauty in this was only skin deep and I'd preferred to have kept this on as art.  With that being said our entrees were very good. We shared the  Duck,Duck,Duck. and Surf and Turf.A wonderful crispy and juicy roast duck accompanied by a duck croissant with foie gras and tender pieces of duck. The portions were good and although the croissant was less than impressive (very little/non-existent foie gras and didn't love the cucumbers) the red miso sauces and HUGE raw duck egg yolk (which you had to pop and mix with the duck sauces were innovative and definitely lent some major flavor points to the croissantwich.The Surf and Turf was great. Tender filets of beef and an incredible raw hamachi with avocado and fingerling potatoes. The ingredients were fresh and the presentation was clean.Dessert was great. We had the Tofu ""Hot & Cold"". A wonderful trio of soy milk souffle (light, whipped air), tofu cheesecake (creamy but not heavy) and maple ice cream. Solid, melt-in-your-mouth goodness.A few things I really liked- the service was good. Efficient and very well timed. The beautiful glass walls and lounge area downstairs. I like how Morimoto is divided into intimate and celebratory areas. The upstairs is very loud, festive and great for popping champagne and fresh sushi. Downstairs is darker, trendy and perfect for a little intimate necking. Also, their bathrooms are pretty amazing. The reflective glass walls make you feel like you are peeing in some kind of never ending Autumn forest and the toilets are smarter than some people I know. They can do just about anything you want them to, short of changing your outfit and curling your hair.Also, on my way up from the magical land of Morimoto toilets, I ran into Mr. Morimoto himself in all his Iron Chef glory. That was pretty awesome. One weird thing. Does this place not have full-sized bottles of wine/champagne? We got a bottle but it was SO tiny. Barely big enough for a full glass. We thought maybe it was just the bottle we got but saw others with miniature bottles as well! Definitely not worth the money for a bottle at this place.

Great trendy location. Gorgeous sprawling interior with unique artsy installations. The food speaks for itself and whatever it says it speaks volumes.

I was seated with husband all the way on the right of the restaurant, up a few steps against the wall of banquets and upon turning around I noticed that it was quite dusty behind me. That was immediately a turnoff, for a restaurant to earn this kind of status and not have someone pay attention to something such as dusting is ludicrous to me. The layer of dust looks like it's been sitting there for at least a few months. Maybe I was looking for something to be pissed off about, but that was the last thing I expected to see.

When we got to the end of the Hi Line it ended into Chelsea Market (which she also wanted to visit). As we walked into the man entrance of the Chelsea Market I saw that there was a doorway of a restaurant next to the Chelsea Market entrance. When I read the name I was pleasantly surprised that it was Morimoto's NYC. Earlier on the vacation we had randomly waled by Mario Battali's Babbo on Waverly Place street and I wanted to eat there but the wife was in a pissy ass mood and said no. So after touring Chelsea Market we walked into Morimoto's at 6pm and I asked for a table of 4, the hostess asked if I had a reservation and I said no. The only thing available was downstairs in the bar area which was perfect for us since my 13 yr old son and 80 yr old mom tend to talk quite loud at times.. For appetizer we split Seared Scallops(cooked just right,not overdone), Calamari Salad (wonderful miso ginger dressing), and the fried Rock shrimp appetizer(which came with Wasabi and Gojuchang Aioli dipping sauces, they also brought some ranch when the waitress heard some of us were spicy food adverse). For entrees we shared 3 entrees the Sea Bass, Black Cod, and Yellowtail Buri Bop while my son ordered 2 Eel Maki and 2 Maguro Tuna Maki. The Sea Bass had flavor permeated thruout while the Cod was fresh as can be. I had the Morimoto Sashimi at his Philly location a few yrs back and compared it to the 5 star sushi/sashimi at Noble Fish (Japanese Grocery) here in Michigan and found it not to be not noticebly any better. Sampling a few pieces of my sons sushi confirmed my decision not to order sushi this time. I also ordered a $22 bottle of Morimoto's Black Obi Soba Ale made by Rogue Ales (Rogue Shakespeare Stout is one of my favs). It looked like a stout but was much lighter and was smooth and had deep rich flavors. Dessert was Matcha Tiramisu and Assorted Seasonal Sorbets.  Oh they also had the coolest toilets, the women's had one of those high tech bidets like the ones in the Japanese airports where I like to sit and have warm jet of water clean my butt after a long flight.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I had the tasting menu, my date had sushi and of course, picked off my plate(s).  The $165 bottle of Sake was the best I have ever had...and I fancy myself a wine connoisseur (Sake IS wine, instead of grapes they use rice and the production process is more like beer than wine).  It tasted just as it was described by our VERY knowledgeable server.Even though we sat down 45 minutes late (It is New York), I still recommend this place to anyone and everyone.  Oh yea, we also saw ""Vince"" from the HBO show Entourage.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Love how the restaurant is hidden behind a piece of red fabric blocking the entrance and upon stepping through the curtain, you enter Morimoto. The inside has a very modern decor and the ambiance was classy but casual. We decided to go with the toro tartare,  mixed green salad, oyster foie gras and miso coups for appetizers, and for entrées got the seafood 'toban yaki' and the ishi yaki buri bop. The toro tartare is definitely a must get with its unique taste and the beautiful presentation. Be sure to try every sauce as they give the tartare a very different flavor.  The mixed green was HUGE, and the waiter should have warned us that the portions were too much if we just wanted to munch on some leaves.  Then came the oyster foie gras, an absolute must get. Definitely a highlight for me when I realized that an oyster could be given such a memorable taste combined with foie gras and uni. However  I would suggest  eating the oysters with a little less teriyaki sauce as it was a little on the salty side. The seafood toban yaki  was good but not exactly memorable, and was the ishi yaki buri bop. However I did like how they prepared the buri bop and cooked the raw yellowtail on the side of the stone bowl. For dessert we got apple bread pudding at the waiter's recommendation.  The bread pudding was warm and fluffly and I enjoyed it immensely. However I was a little disappointed by the sour berries on the side. Also as it was valentines day, it would have been nice to receive some complimentary dessert. Would recommend Morimoto over Nobu or Megu if you're in the mood for some Japanese fusion food.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

2085,8uyoWSisuncOWEUOFnNINQ,Jonathan J.,5.0 star rating,"I am in the mind frame that there are preconceived notions as to what is expected when visiting a place with such a renowned ""Celebrity Chef"", .aka. Iron Chef Master and it can either go one of two ways. The first is that this place can astound and flirt with each one of your senses, making your eating experience one that will be unforgettable. The other is that its ambiance, clientele and interesting menu could possibly turn off patrons by its quirkiness and overall creativity. I am in the former boat, I found my experience at Morimoto beyond incredible, it fired on all pistons and tempted me like the goddess vixen Aphrodite herself!It's hard to know where to begin with this review, simply because walking into Morimoto you are dazzled by the ambiance, the thrill of being in the presence of the end-product of a Master Chef who knows exactly how to execute the perfect Japanese meal, i'll do my best in convening each aspect of the meal -Drinks -I started off with the Moritmotini; a delicate blend of wasabi infused vodka, cucumber and ginger. The cocktail was clean, crisp and delicate. The wasabi infused vodka was extremely smooth and the coolness of the cucumber allowed your palate to cleanse itself at the end. Their selection of sake is superb and the one that came to the table (forgot the name) was crisp, smooth and hinted of sweet ginger and rice.Starters -Toro tartare: Ingenious, simplistic and delicious. This dish managed to play off of numerous textures and flavors. The combination of the crunchy pieces and the various sauces and the extremely fresh tuna. This dish pleased on different levels.Tuna Pizza: One of the smartest dishes I've ever consumed in a Japanese restaurant. What better way to introduce a delicacy such as raw fish to an ever-hesitant American consumer. Not to say that I was blown away with the dish itself, as I found it to be a bit underwhelming, I thought that the idea behind the dish was superb.Oyster Foie Gras: I saved the best for last... I can't even put into words how fantastical this dish was. It punched me in the face, knocked me off of my seat and stepped on my foodie gonads. It was thought provoking, tongue tantalizing and sexy. Each layer of flavor was upfront and hit your palate like a parade of tasty goodness. I would've preferred a little less teriyaki sauce, as it did take away from the flavor of the foie gras/oyster combo, but all in all, it was a perfect bite.Sushi / Raw Bar -Chef's Raw Combination: Basically a raw tower with crab, lobster, oysters and scallops. Everything is beyond fresh and served in an extremely intricate display. My favorite were the oysters, they were slurpingly delightful and had that amazingly fresh straight-from-the-ocean flavor. I was enamored to say the least. The scallop was also a highlight, great texture and amazing flavor.Sushi/Sashimi (Chef's Combo) - WOW. That's all I can say! I remember having a piece of tuna, that was cut perfectly, just enough fat and meaty enough to satisfy the palate. The tuna was so tender it melted in my mouth. Phenomenal... just flat out incredible. The caviar was fresh and almost seemed mildly sweet and not like the normal salty type. I don't even think I need to mention how tasty and mouthwatering the eel was.... I actually don't think I need to say anything more about how incredibly fresh and clean the sushi was.Ambiance -Considering the location, Morimoto has done it right. Instead of going the traditional Japanese-style sushi house (Matsuri anyone?). Morimoto opted for the stylish, swanky and dare I say it warped and pretentious yet welcoming decor that one would expect from a Iron Chef and master culinarian. If their purpose was to shock, delight and awe.. let's just say Mission Accomplished. Loved the chairs, the lighting, the intricate bathroom operations, and the lit-up bottles lining the wall.Overall, Morimoto is not so much a restaurant as it is an experience. One that is supposed to take you away from your everyday mundane existence and into the future, taking traditional Japanese food and flipping it on its ass. Morimoto takes no prisoners and executes your taste buds with an audacity that is rightfully so. I already cannot wait for my next tour of duty at Morimoto where it will delight and bewilder my stomach once again.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Very good! The oyster with foie gras was all about the sauce.  Not worth the money although tasty.  I ended getting the sashimi salad thinking it will be a variety of fish but it was just tuna tartare. Our friend got the surf and turf and it was tiny! the fingerling potatoes had no flavor (just boiled?) but the steak was all sorts of juicy goodness!  It was good but it wasn't top chef quality or worth the money in my eyes.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Our reservations were for 10:15p and we had no problems getting seated on a Friday night.  The environment is totally like a club in Vegas.  The centerpiece in the middle of the restaurant is beautiful, and it extends from the entrance level to lower level. The entire space is super hip, super elegant.We started out with a couple of drinks. I got the Lychee martini, I think and it was perfectly balanced, not too sweet nor to alcoholy. We got the omakase, and most of the dishes were good.  Started off with the toro tartare, it was fresh and I liked the mix n' match the sauce to your liking kinda deal. Second dish was the whitefish carpaccio, sooo simple yet so elegant and tasty, loved this dish.  Third  was a heated miso  fondue thingy-  really salty but came out in a cool looking pot that kept the fondue warm using a tea light.  Fourth dish was the oyster and foie gras with teriyaki sauce.  It was good but a little too sweet.  Fifth was a sushi sampler. Super fresh fish, and very delicious.  A palate cleanser, then off to the sixth course, which was the lobster tail and waygu beef.  Both cooked perfectly, but I was not a fan of the lobster. It was spiced with way too much garam masala, and destroyed the simplicity and natural sweetness of the lobster, making it way too spicy and smokey. The waygu beef though, that was melty in your mouth. Sooo good.  Desserts were kinda blah. I think we had green tea ice cream with some kinda dry spiced cake and passionfruit sorbet. Kinda boring.  Next time we come back we'd probably skip the omakase and just do a la carte. So once you're done with dinner, go downstairs.

I came for lunch rather than dinner so I could try more for a slightly less price. Instead of going for the bento (a standard for those that want to ""try it all"" at a reasonable price), we ordered based on what we generally like (so we could have a basis for critique) and yelp reviews. We started with the 10oz bottle of ginjo sake, morimoto ice tea, toro tartare, and spicy king crab. My bf LOVED the presentation and experience of the tuna tartare. Of the ""condiments"", I enjoyed the seaweed paste & rice balls. I really liked the meaty king crab, & my bf liked the spicy sauce so much that he was sucking on the shells. My bf guzzled the calpico/ice tea concoction. The ginjo was smooth & subtle. For our entrees, we shared the soft shell crab maki & katsu sandwich. The roll was very balanced and had a clean, not overtly fried, taste. I'm glad they didn't garnish it with tobiko. The sandwich came on uncrusted white bread and a little slaw. It was light & not abrasive but crunchy. It came with a couple onion rings that were sprinkled with way too much salt for my liking. The sweet cucumbers are super yum! We willingly forced ourselves to have the tofu dessert trio, which is amaaaaazing. Overall, the food & experience met our every expectations.

We also had the crispy rock shrimp tempura, which was decent. I rather preferred the wasabi sauce. The seafood toban yaki and the ishi yaki buri bop were both quite good. My friend's addicted to the soup of the toban dish. Everything was very well cooked and tasty, and the presentation, including the ishi yaki, which is cooked at your table, is wonderful. Like I said, I enjoyed my experience, but probably won't come back here. I've had equally good food elsewhere for less money. I do have to say though, I love the decoration and especially the huge kitchen. You get to smell all kinds of yummy things!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I ordered a seafood in broth dish and they definitely didn't cheap out on the seafood. It had lobster, king crab, shrimp, scallops, mussels, and more.The only thing I didn't COMPLETELY enjoy was the dessert. It was fine, don't get me wrong. I ordered the cheesecake of the day which ended up tasting more like a health cheesecake (sugar, butter, carb-free type) which is probably better for me :P but I was definitely expecting more of a carb-rific adventure with that one.Overall, AMAZING restaurant!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We each got different entrees off the RW menu - sashimi salad, sea bass and angry chicken. All were fantastic.  They didn't skimp on the portions or the flavors for the lower priced menu.

A real fun and interactive presentation as long as no one double dips.  I like my tartar to have body and tang.  This one tasted too fishy and mushy and not enough acid.  Sashimi appetizer:  Layers of sashimi pressed into a rectangular bar with sauces served in squeeze droppers.  The presentation was wonderful.  Taste? Meh.Rock Shrimp Tempura:  A nice crunchy tempura coating, but the shrimp itself was underseasoned.  Could have used a little salt prior to the batter step.  Ranch dressing as a dipping sauce?  Odd.Calamari Salad:  This was delicious, calamari was perfectly fried and not chewy.  Shallots and the dressing on the greens rounded it out nicelyRamen:  The noodle looked like a flat mandarin noodle straight from the package, not a fresh noodle the way ramen is supposed to be.  The broth was a little too salty, but the chicken flavor was good and the portion was plentiful. Seabass main entree:  A nice cut of fish, a touch overcooked, but still moist and flavorful.  The dashi broth and the miso eggplant was delicious (although the eggplant didn't look very elegant).  It came with tempura'd avocado sitting in the dashi broth and some tomato which I thought was odd to pair with the seabass and eggplant.  A decent portion, but the serving plate was way oversized.We had to wait what felt like an hour just for the entrees (the manager later came out to apologize and promised that it was an atypical night and it would never happen again which was really nice).  So they comp'd us some desserts.  The desserts were not very remarkable tho, I have to say, although presentation was beautiful.  They were trying to balance east meets west (aka black sesame and chocolate ganache?) but the flavors didn't work for me.I was fortunate enough to have met Morimoto before, and will say that he seems like a very nice man, humble and funny.  I think he should stick to simplicity and freshness instead of getting caught up with the fancy stuff and he will go a long way.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

2121,fZOeXTW3d6oiZgyr6B3cMg,Drake R.,5.0 star rating,"Morimoto is a feast for all the senses. I went here for the first time on 1/22/10 to celebrate my birthday with my GF. We arrived at 7:10 for our 7:30 reservation and were seated promptly. By just looking around the restaurant, you can tell you're in for an excellent experience. The decoration is modern chic; artistic without being pretentious. There is a large glass bottle wall in the middle of the restaurant that serves as a sort of centerpiece. The kitchen is open glass so, if you're close enough, you can watch the chefs prepare your meal. If you venture downstairs, you will find a few more tables with a fully stocked bar. We started our course with 2 appetizers to share. The first was the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio. The dish was thinly sliced Wagyu beef that was served with hot oil and a yuzu sauce (yuzu is a Japanese citrus fruit). The beef melted in your mouth and was nothing short of perfectly tender. The yuzu sauce added a nice acidity and the hot oil didn't overwhelm the delicate flavor of the beef. Unfortunately, I felt that the dish had a bit too much salt that took away from the natural beauty of the Wagyu beef. The next appetizer was the Tuna Pizza. This was actually my favorite dish of the evening. It is a thin flour tortilla that is baked so that it is crispy. It is layered with thinly sliced, sashimi-style, sushi grade tuna served raw. Upon the tuna you will find diced black olives and halved cherry tomatoes. To finish it off, it is drizzled with a garlic aioli sauce. The textures of everything was like a symphony in my mouth. The buttery texture of the tuna mixed with the crunch of the tortilla and the crisp bite of the tomato made for a wonderful culinary experience. The garlic aioli was nicely seasoned and didn't detract from the overall freshness of the dish. For my main course, I had the Seafood Toban Yaki. This was a combination of scallops, shrimp, lobster, crab, and mussels in a dark broth. The seafood was cook perfectly (with the slight exception of the mussels which were a bit rubbery) and all were seasoned properly. The broth added a ton of flavor to each element of seafood and was subtle enough to be drank as a soup if desired. My GF got 2 appetizers as her entree which consisted of the Spicy Crab and the Pork Gyoza. The Spicy Crab was excellent. They didn't skimp on the amount of crab that was delivered and each piece was as fresh as one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. The spicy sauce had a nice kick and melded nicely with the freshness of the crab. The Pork Gyoza was nice as well, though I didn't feel it was something that couldn't be found elsewhere. This was actually the only dish that I tried that evening that I thought could have been more inventive or unique. Don't get me wrong; it was very tasty, but I just felt it was missing something to really make it pop. For dessert, we shared a piece of the Sesame Hazelnut Layer Cake. This was a thrill for the taste buds and something that you will assuredly not find in many other restaurants. It was a Hazelnut sponge cake that was layered with white chocolate, green tea chocolate, and sesame seeds. It was topped with a mandarin-plum sake sorbet which was amazing. The dish, as a whole, was utterly unique and complex enough to entertain your palate till the last bite. Overall, our service was top notch and we were never left with an empty water glass or an empty drink. The waiter, while attentive, was not overbearing and stopped by at appropriate times to check up on us. I would highly recommend Morimoto to anyone who enjoys Japanese cuisine and is looking for a unique take on an otherwise traditional cuisine. On the other hand, don't go unless you're wallet is willing to take a bit of a bruising. After all was said and done, our dinner for two amounted to about $225 including tax and tip.

As I had no chance to dine at your restaurant, I tried out your recipes instead - lobster and foie gras balls,eggplant shigiyaki and your gorgeous pork kakuni with scallop porridge; all this time dreaming that one day, one day, I'd dine at your restaurant and taste your food for real.The day came but the experience was bitter sweet.  Your artful dishes inspired joy.  The portions were way beyond what is usually expected in a Japanese restaurant.  Your appetizers of toro tartare, crispy rock shrimp tempura, kobe beef carpaccio, pork kakuni, yose dofu , fois gras chawan mushi were brilliant - I wished your server could have mentioned the portion sizes and cautioned against ordering too much.  Would it have been too much to ask?  He could have gently mentioned or made a suggestion - I would have found it helpful and tempered my enthusiasm and leave space enough to order dessert.  Alas it was not to be - he did not seem to care about us and was acting like nothing more than an order taker at a fast food restaurant.Your entrees were truly inspiring but for the Duck Duck Duck dish which was essentially ""chinese roasted duck"" with 3 different sauces (one of which was not even sauce- since it was a whole duck's egg) and where was the fois gras?!  For shame - it was more a smear of fois gras on the croissant like butter on bread- a gross misrepresentation of your menu ""fois gras croissant"".I was most excited about your yose dofu having read and re-read the pages of your cookbook and studying pictures of you preparing it.  You write about drawing your customers into the process - wowing them by transforming steaming hot soymilk into silky tofu in 10 minutes right in front of their eyes!  Well I was not wowed at all - thanks to our server who was less than enthusiastic about the process.  He came with the claypot of soymilk added in the nigari and told us very blah-blahly that we should not peek - he'd be back in 10 mins.  Well, we left the pot alone - and stared at it waiting for him to come back.  He did not come back at all.  Whatever.  A server of Indian decent finally comes but he had such a thick Indian accent that it just marred the whole zen ""tofu"" experience I had dreamt of sooo sooo often.  His service was also clumsy which did nothing to enhance the experience - he ended up dishing out only one bowl and left abruptly even though there were other bowls to fill for the rest of the table.  Sigh.  The amount that was being charged was surely not for the food only but the service and sadly, Morimoto-san we got very little service or any of the promised drama.  I had to avoid thinking that I could get the same quality hot fresh homemade dofu for a dollar a quart in Chinatown instead of paying $16 at your restaurant.  Sigh and double sigh.Most of the night, your servers were milling around congregating in corners and talking amongst themselves.  Much as I love your food, I am sad to say, I am very unimpressed with the dining experience.  I wished I did not dine at your restaurant and left it a dream - at least there would be something to look forward to.p/s I hated the bottle wall.Yours truly, A Fan.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The gyoza were delicious, with bacon foam, so strange. We got these cute little fried balls. No clue what was in them but they were so flavorful, I could have eaten a plate of them. Every plate (except the fried balls) was described in detail by our waitstaff (truly Iron Chef style). We got to try fugu (poisonous fish). There was some kind of egg custard soup that, in it's simplicity, was just so good..My entrée was the surf and turf.  The raw yellow tail was overly salty, but the Kobe beef made up for it. Now that was the best beef I have ever had. It cut like butter and had a crispy, spicy outside. It was cooked to perfection. Next time I go (y'know, once I become rich), Ill definitely fork over the $100 so I could have even more Kobe beef (I got the surf and turf only because it was significantly cheaper).My dessert was an apple something or another..

Found myslef at the sushi bar sitting next to a sweedish model and another hot girl. Thats NYC for ya.Place is hard to find. I dont mean the location because its correct and how can you get lost with Google and mapquest in a grid street network like NYC. I mean lost from finding the place from the outside. I saw Japaneses writing and thought is this it? Funny how some of the best restaurants in the world do not need advertise their name or make it obvious they are there. If its that good people will find the place.Giving props to Iron Chef Morimoto I ordered the Omakase. I wanted to see what he had to offer. The Chef was at the restaurant when I was there and stood overlooking the sushi bar from an adjacent uprise. Kinda cool.The first item out was a little bit of ahi tartar. Came out looking like a painters ink pad. The dob of ink that was too resemble black ink was fish roe/caviar. Yummy. The final dish was a ""spicy lobster"". The lobster wasn't really spicy tho. At least to me. Im Mexican. Of course, there is no Mexican's in NYC. lol. Very good tho. I recommended it to the model next to me. It was spicy to her. It came with a lemon dipping cream that evened it out tho. Great combo.Of course all the sushi I had was amazing. Perfect cuts that melt in your mouth. Check out the restrooms while here. I was a bit tipsy and didn't know wether to wipe my behind or press a button to have the ol H20 do it for me. I was tempted to press the button but pictured myself going back to the sushi bar all wet and having to flirt with the model looking like I pissed myself. I dropped about $200 for myself.

I think this is the only way to do it at Morimoto. If you want great sushi there are plenty of  better places to go:I say this because the restaurant has been around for a few years and is really more of a tourist trap than anything else now. The second time I came (and probably my last), I saw a huge huge fat woman in a red starter jacket rocking a fanny pack clogging up the otherwise spacious entrance. What a way to start off dinner.Anyway, the Omakase is not to be missed. It is a fantastic show. Each course is presented in a creative way; huge bowls of shaved ice with intricately laid out pieces of otoro, to seared fish on wooden planks, and the food keeps coming and keeps surprising in its presentation. It's a food fun experience.I took a girl here on a first date once, which turned out to be a mistake. I quickly realized the service, spectacle of food, and the massive space was too intimidating for her. Don't get me wrong, I still had a great time.

If you want top-notch service without paying obscene amount of money at Morimoto, come for a weekday lunch. Planning to have a stayvacation, my mom took this week off, hoping to recharge her battery, yet last week's tornado swept us off our feet...quite literally. Our background is destroyed, we lost electricity for well over 48+ hours (I had to buy bags of ice to save my frozen goods), the devastation of road travelling (waiting for the bus for an hour, and I eventually felt ill after all these stressful events. The start of the week made me even more apprehensive.  So, I did what any irresponsible worker would do...I skipped work to have lunch with mom. Actually, we both needed a break and deserved some pampering, so what's better than a Japanese restaurant, where hospitality is of utmost importance? Being a Monday lunchtime, the dining area was mostly empty, with a few filled up tables.  The most affordable lunch option is to order the bento.  From the look of the presentation, it didn't seem like a lot of food (no bowl of rice with your entree), but the freshness of the sushi and sashimi does satisfy your protein needs.  My mom tasted the wagyu beef.  It was very savory and made her want to down a bowl of rice to sop up the extra sauce.  The tofu, miso soup was authentic and definitely not the fake package flavor.  However, the salad dressing was too acidic and if you don't like blue cheese, be sure to inform your waitstaff because the tempura was rested on a pool of cheesy bechamel sauce (that was not described on the menu).  I ordered a la carte. I loved their green salad.  Extremely fresh and it even included mizuna and other Japanese greens.  I asked for added avocado and the waitress complied...with no extra charge! Even though I didn't order the bento set, I still received a panna cotta lychee dessert in a shot glass.  Nice touch.  I understand that it's a seafood restaurant, so begin a vegetarian, there was not a lot of options for me (I was hoping to see fresh tofu appetizer, more salad varieties or zaru soba of sort.  Not all vegetarians rely on tempura and miso soup you know.)With that said, we savored the serenity that was much needed.  If you're a pescetarian, I would definitely recommend you coming here as my mom said the tuna literally melted in her mouth and she's rarely this descriptive with her words.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I eat Japanese in the city about 1-2 times per week and I was rather disappointed.  This is definitely above average and I would usually say 3.5-4 stars for the food but I need to say meh and 3 stars given the hoopla around the rep.  However, I totally LOVED the tofu cooked right at your table and sakes selection was awesome but watch the wallet on ordering your faves.2. Service - I had a reservation and mentioned that I wanted to be seated NEXT TO, not ACROSS FROM my husband of now 10 years.  The sushi bar, a table where we can sit together, etc.  Instead, we were taken to a row of tiny tables for 2 where I couldn't hear him over the loud, annoying bankers around us spending more bailout money.  Finally, I asked to be moved.  In a very cool attitude, I was told no, nothing.  There were so many empty tables!  I stood my ground and said that we'll wait.  Then, told in a hushed whisper, ""well, the MAN himself is here today, so you know....""  Okay, okay, his esteemed presence has chosen to be there, I'm eternally grateful, but can I get a seat next to my husband.  FINALLY, got the table I wanted and was informed that we were extraordinarily lucky and that that through a little crack in the window there, over the heads of the people in front of us, I might actually, yes, gulp, get a glimpse of the iron chef himself.    WOW, serves me right for going to a celeb chef restaurant, what was I thinking?   3. Ambiance - yes, very cool decor, however the vibe is actually mostly tourists and bankers.  Some people celebrating something (yes, ok, including me, so that would certainly not make me contribute to the coolness factor, I'm out on my anniversary, do you want to be in the same restaurant as me?)",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I have to say, as a visitor of NY... I fell in love with the dining experience of NY with this resteraunt.I'm Japanese, so I'm suppose to be critical of authentic Japanese resteraunts but even as a native (Japanese that is...) I loved the food here!For appetizers, go for the toro tartar. It's a very fusion dish but comes with REAL wasabi (not the pasty kind), seaweed paste and 4 other condiments. It's definitely not the most authentic Japanese dish, but definitely an unique one.The waiter recommended Hamachi seared Bibimba was absolutely mouth watering. The hamachi is seared in front of you with the hot clay pot! The only down fall of the menu was that the individual nigiri sushi only came with 1 piece! A traditional nigiri comes with two!

We had tuna pizza ($18), chirashi don (32), chef's sashimi assortment (35), and tofu hot and cold dessert (12). The tuna pizza was good, it was something different. I loved the sushi rice in chirashi don and there was definitely quite plenty of sashimi on top. The sashimi assortment was not that impressive, but the quality of fish was decent. The tofu hot and cold dessert came with maple ice cream, tofu souffle, and tofu cheesecake - my fave was to cheesecake - it was subtle yet very flavorful. The service was okay. They were nice but I didn't find impressive. Also the fact that there was a fly flying around our table was also a bit disappointing, but it's okay because the warm toilet seat in the bathroom made up for it, haha.

2181,Q-CsOGqOQ89rWKa_bxcExw,sherry w.,3.0 star rating,"The first thing to note is, this restaurant is expensive. I dined at lunch and still spent way more than I anticipated. I began with a coconut milk drink that was incredibly refreshing. I like that it tasted like fresh coconut without gritty ground coconut meat that a lot of drinks tend to have. For about $7, the drink did not disappoint. Then for the first appetizer was the toro tartare with ground toro on a wood plate and cavier spread on top. Also came with a plate of dipping sauces/condiments which included wasabe, sour cream, fish sauce, chives, avocado and rice balls. It was good but I thought that instead of ground toro, it would actually be a flat piece of toro so I was a bit disappointed. The price was about $20-$25 and I don't remember specifics. Next was the lamb carpaccio with a ginger garlic topping and chives. I was surprised that raw lamb didn't have any of the gamey taste that lamb normally does but the ginger garlic spread on top was too overpowering that it was difficult to taste the lamb. Next and final appetizer was the waygu beef carpaccio in a soy sauce based citrus sauce. The beef was really tender and the sauce balanced the flavor really well, it was probably my favorite appetizer and it was about $20. Then we got the waygu beef bento box with miso soup, salad, veggie tempura, three pieces of sushi which were red snapper, salmon and squid, three spicy tuna rolls and the waygu beef. The beef was my favorite thing in the box, it was really tender and I love the balance of savory and sweet in the soy sauce based teriyaki sauce that the beef came with. The bento box was about $25. Last was a tofu cheesecake with coffee syrup as apart of the bento box. It didn't taste like tofu at all but a light cheesy flavor accompanied by sweet coffee syrup that wasn't overpowering. I loved the texture, it was really soft and just kind of melted in my mouth. Overall, I enjoyed the food but it was way too expensive for me. I would recommend it for the experience but don't expect to spend anything less than $30 and that's pushing it.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Tuna Tartare, Tuna Pizza, Rock Shrimp Tempura, Spicy King Crab, Udon, Buribop, Chef's Choice Sushi Dinner and there may have been some sort of roll ordered.  Obviously the Tuna Tartare is a hit, and it lived up to the hype.  I've never seen Tuna Tartare so finely chopped, and it was more like a tuna paste.  The condiments at the bottom were perfect to make different types of bites, and the presentation was top notch.  Tuna Pizza was a hit at the table.  The Anchovy aioli was so good.  I thought the crust could have been just a little bit better, but overall it was a beautiful dish.  The other dishes that really stood out to me were the Spicy King Crab and Buribop.  Now onto where my focus was...Omikase:Tuna Tartare -  See above.Vegetable Fondue w/ Anchovy Garlic Sauce -  The least memorable dish of the night.  I did think the sauce and presentation of it was nice, but this was just OK.  Not bad, just OK.Harami Sashimi -  A+ Several thinly sliced delectable pieces of fluke with a subtle yet totally delicious sauce drizzled over.  Oyster, Uni, & Foie Gras w/ Teriyaki Sauce -  Combining these three ingredients are the things dreams are made of.  I was a little worried about some people saying the teriyaki was too over powering, but I must disagree.  The sauce did not over power the other flavors to me, just added a delightful touch this orgasm of flavor combinations.  One large bit of heaven.Nigiri Selection (Chu Toro, Red Snapper, White Snapper, Amber Jack, and Topneck Clam) -  Each piece was so fresh and satisfying, I only wish I had 1 more of each piece.  The quality of the fish was excellent.  Not too much rice and a perfect size mouthful of fish.Surf & Turf (Wagyu Beef & Lobster) -   My beef was cooked perfectly,  lobster was good, and the lemon creme fraiche made it fantastic. Solid.Apple Turban - I had been chatting with out waitress a bit, and she told me about the dessert they were serving that night, and how it wasn't her favorite, and that if I like she would let me choose any of the other desserts.  I took her advice and opted for the Apple Turban instead.  It was very good and the glass of port I had to wash it down (which the waitress upgraded), made it the perfect close to an outstanding meal.We ordered 2 $50 bottles of wine, a few cocktails (Morimotini was great, even though I'm not the biggest Vodka guy), on top of all our food, and got out of there at like $650+/-, tip included.  Truthfully i thought we had racked up a bigger bill.  I had an idea of what we were going to pay, and I was prepared.  While the menu is pricey, thats just the type of restaurant that this is, and I will say that the food really lived up to the hype.  We all left every satisfied.  i hope to come back one day.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
2184,fY4gxY4O_nYef0jAt1K2wg,Zoe P.,5.0 star rating,"You gotta love the Iron Chef.After going last year to Morimoto in Philadelphia for my birthday dinner, I decided to replicate the experience in NYC, this time with my parents. Compared to the Philadelphia one, I think I prefer the New York location. Although the food quality is equally excellent (as I will describe momentarilly), I had a slightly more pleasant dining experience overall.The interior is great - a cream color dominates the room from the undulating ceiling to the comfy chairs, and a warm lighting lends a more intimate feel to the overall large dining area. The bar/lounge downstairs is darker and filled with blue tones, and (I have to say it) the bathrooms are gorgeous! Not only are the toilets similar to the stereotypical crazy electronic Japanese kind (it vibrates?!), but the wall behind them has, like, suspended flowers/petals/something really really pretty behind glass.Our waiter was very nice and helpful, answering all of my parents questions (I already knew that I wanted to share the sushi/sashimi omakase as our entree) as they contemplated the appetizers. They finally chose to try the Yose Dofu, which was fresh tofu prepared tableside with two sauces: lobster ankake, and dashi soy with fresh wasabi. May I add that the wasabi is REAL wasabi and therefore MUCH spicier than the generic one. The tofu really is made tableside - someone from the kitchen came out with a steaming bowl of...something, poured some other liquid into it, stirred and explained that it needed 20 minutes to set before we could eat it. It was a little weird, but let me tell you, once we tried it I knew that THAT was how real tofu was supposed to taste. Delicious with a soft, creamy texture, and that lobster sauce was damn good!The sushi/sashimi was beautiful (one roll looked like a checkerboard design!) and incredibly fresh and delicious as always. There was this one piece of itty bitty shrimp that tasted like lavender, it was so good! As always, the yellowtail and scallion roll blows my taste buds away, as did every fish there, to be honest, but I can't for the life of me remember all the types - it was so much!Since it was my birthday, I had the perfect excuse to gorge myself into oblivion, and therefore was the only one to have dessert, trying the Caramel Cinnamon Chiboust, which has an apple confit atop some thin cake-like bottom and topped with a huge cloud of cotton candy, with sakura miso caramel and vanilla bean ice cream. The cotton candy was delicious, the apple/cake thing tasted slightly off by I still enjoyed it, and well, damn fine ice cream! I was so stuffed afterwards, I quite literally walked from the restaurant (10th Ave and 15th St) to Madison Ave and 51st where my feet finally gave out just to burn off all that food. It was wonderful! My one complaint is, despite the different decor/architecture of the NYC joint, it still gets very loud inside, though not as loud as the one in Philly.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We went into the Chelsea market looking for it but it's actually behind two red curtains. We weren't able to get table reservations last minute but ended up sitting at the sushi bar which was pretty neat to watch everyone work. The atmosphere overall is very trendy and lounge like. Music was louder downstairs, upstairs was more like a restaurant. They didn't have any speciality rolls, only the very basic rolls (tuna, california, salmon). We had the spicy tuna roll and it wasn't anything spectacular but good enough. I had the surf and turf and my boyfriend had the angry chicken. My surf and turf was wagyu beef and tuna with avocado. One of the chefs came to the table and prepared my tuna and avocado which turned out to be sort of like tuna and guacamole. It was really good, like nothing I have tried before. The steak was a little tougher than other cuts of wagyu beef I had before but still good in flavor. I tasted my boyfriend's chicken and it was definately ""angry"", spicy, very good.

The interior is swanky, the waitstaff are friendly, and the decor is oh-so-very chic.Upon entering the automatic sliding doors, you're greeted by the host(ess), and led to the downstairs bar if your entire party hasn't yet arrived. The downstairs bar feels a little bit like you're in the arctic - the ice-like barstools and clear bartop are nice touches. And the wall completely made up of water bottles - well, now, that's you gotta see for yourself.The bathroom is also downstairs along with the bar/lounge, and you have to slide the door open to enter. In each stall there is a remote control next to the toilet - needless to say, I had to press every button. I won't tell you what buttons are on the remote, I'll leave that to the imagination, or to your future dining experience at Morimoto.For dinner I ordered a miso soup (delicious!!!!!!) with huge chunks of soft tofu and a really tasty broth, and the Ishi Yaki Buri Bop -- yellowtail on rice which is cooked in front of you in the hot stone bowl in which it is served. The fish is left half-seared, half-cooked, and it couldn't have been better. It was extremely delicious and my mouth is watering just thinking about it now.For dessert, my party of 4 decided to split the Caramel Cinnamon Chiboust (Japanese version of apple pie a la mode) and the sesame ganache dessert (I can't remember the exact name of it). The ganache dessert was the winner - hands down! It was like a grown-up version of a peanut butter cup.

The fish is good.  That's what matters.  I would be happy to come here and eat nothing but nigiri.  We sat at sushi bar, ordered cheapest ($35) sushi set and some rolls (latter not my choice).  Sushi set was actually a great value, although the maki was a sort of spicy inside-out tuna roll.  (""Spicy"" was atypical though: it was not mayo-and-red-pepper, but some kind of black? pepper applied like a rub.)  Nigiri was fresh, cut small (as I prefer), and expertly prepared.  Good value at any restaurant, but especially in high-rent meatpacking.  Rolls are typical upscale americanized rolls, like softshell crab.  I don't care enough to comment.  Negitoro maki (a real Japanese roll) was fresh, but done in inside-out style (fail!) and just didn't blow me away as it should have.  Toro appeared to be really fatty though.  Taste was good but perhaps toooo finely minced.4.  Chefs were all Japanese, and one near us handed us our sushi with a smile.  Great.  Some of their assistants were dorky white guys who clearly thought they were very cool to be working the sushi bar at morimoto.  Well...good for them, but they will never be true sushi chefs cuz they don't even know japanese.  But good for them.  Staff are generically attractive non-Japanese people, and polite.5.  The neta in the case looked fairly high-quality, but not stunningly so.  Ushiwakamaru's case is more appealing.6. Tea was great, but of a lighter variety -- and then the bill comes and they charged us $8 each for it!!!! Absurd!!!  there was no warning in advance of the charge -- we just asked for tea.  Bad trick.7.

We sat at the sushi bar and I was mesmorized by the skill of the sushi chefs.  Their knife skills are top notch and the way they prepare the sushi is like nothing I've ever seen.  They took such care in their job, as did the servers and everyone on the floor.  It was the perfect lunch in the city.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Classy and sophisticated.The service was amazing. We sat in the omakase section, but were able to order off the regular menu. Our server was so polite and patient, answering all of our questions patiently and thoroughly. We started the meal with:Lamb carpaccio-- WOW, melt in your mouthWagyu beef carpaccio-- holy cow! Tuna pizza-- how is it possible for this to taste so good?For the main course:One friend had the duck duck duck, which I was lucky enough to snag a taste of. Tender, succulent, cooked perfectly. My other friend and I shared a sushi chef combo. Every single thing on the plate was interesting, delicious, fresh, beautiful and well thought out. Even the omelet was flavorful and delicious. Those normally taste like yellow rubber gloves. Not these. My husband had the Ishi Yaki Buri Bop, which is Morimoto's take on a Korean bibimbap. A hot bowl with rice, veg and an egg with slices of fish that you cook with the heat from the bowl. The rice at the bottom becomes crispy giving you different textures to enjoy. I appreciate a restaurant that can highlight the flavor of rice.Needless to say I love Morimoto and hope to dine there each time I visit NY.

I somewhat quickly decided on Morimoto as I had wanted to try the NY branch but had not been overly impressed with the Philadelphia original. A trip a few years ago for a dinner that surprisingly seemed a bit uninspired.The restaurant is quite beautiful in a refrained Japanese sort of way, multi-leveled, light wood tones, and modern lighting structure at the center. The large room was nearly empty for a Monday lunch and the serving staff were very attentive to the handful of customers. We started with a tuna pizza that essentially was a tuna carpaccio on a baked pastry base with pepper, olive, onion, tomato and a mild spicy mayo dressing over top. This was inventive and more fun then it had any right to be. We moved on to some sushi of eel and avocado maki and sea urchin / uni with quail egg.  These were expertly prepared and the rice was well seasoned. The last item was the sea bass severed in a flavorful but not overpowering broth with avocado tempura.The whole experience left me wanting more and though the price was a bit over what I would expect, I definitely see myself going back for a full dinner.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

My party and I tried 2 of their rolls that I can't remember the names of, but who cares, they both weren't that great for me to remember the names. We also tried a cooked sea bass dish, and that was decent. The portions were small  that's why I was still hungry, but I didn't want to stay and spend my money on below decent food.

Nice clear panels between pairs of tables really cuts down on noise but the seating is still roomy.Service: Knowledgeable and friendly staff. Our waitress was so intent on giving us a full description of the Australian crab that we didn't have the heart to interrupt her to let her know we were Aussies. Our request to share two entrees between 3 of us didn't get the pained or snooty look it does in some places. In fact there was no air of pretentiousness that you can often get in high end restaurants. You will definitely be made to feel at home.Food: Okay, so after thinking about this for quite a while I can safely say this was the best meal of my life. Completely flawless in all respects from the drinks onwards. We tried the chirashi which at $32 was a bargain and something I'd go back for in a heartbeat. It is basically a deconstructed bowl of nigiri sushi but this doesn't do it justice. There was loads of different fish and roe and perfect seasoning which made this the most exquisite single dish I've ever had. I also tried two kinds of nigiri sushi (shad and live squid) which were terrific but a word to the wise - the pricing is per piece not for two pieces which is the standard at most places. Next we had the ""duck, duck, duck"" and halibut entrees. Both were excellent, but I felt the duck was a little heavy for the most part while the halibut was a lighter fare with a delicious broth.Price: Okay, so probably a one-off for most people, but definitely worth it. The chirashi would be more than enough to fill anyone and as a single dish is quite affordable.Other: This may sound crass but a visit to their restroom provides a unique sit-down experience.

2233,_KRphzrvgZ8C6-gJI0iMBQ,Bora K.,5.0 star rating,"What a very happy birthday meal I had here.I have watched Masaharu Morimoto since his days on the original Iron Chef show that aired in Japan and I continue to watch him on Iron Chef America (even though I think the show is sort of silly compared to its Japanese counterpart).I've always had a tiny bit of a crush on him (although I have to admit that ponytail/glasses/goatee combo he's been sporting lately isn't his best look) and also always hankered after a taste of his food. A birthday dinner here was a great opportunity for me to experience it.The decor is gorgeous. The huge light structure in the middle of the restaurant, the clear bar stools downstairs at the bar, the clean lines, the high folded ceiling.. and the bathroom. I love fancy bathrooms. And out of every restaurant bathroom I have ever been to in my life, the bathroom at Morimoto is the best. The toilets have bidets installed on them and although I was somewhat startled by the heated toilet seat, it was nice to think there was so much thought put into such details. The wall behind the toilet is glass and mirrors with suspended cherry blossoms and the illusion of going on endlessly...The service is courteous and timely. My water glass was always filled,empty dishes were taken away promptly, and our server was always nearby if we needed anything. The sparkling sake is wonderful. Please try it.The toro tartare was delicious and the presentation was beautiful. The toro tartare comes in a square bamboo box with a small bowl of ponzu dipping sauce and another box with different condiments to dip the tartare into. I believe there were tiny rice crackers, avocado, black seaweed, sour cream, and wasabi. I liked the combination of sour cream and wasabi the best. Unexpected and so refreshing. I could've licked the entire condiment box clean but the server took away the dish before I could. Sad... I'm not one for ordering maki at Japanese restaurants but I was craving soft shell crab so I ordered a soft shell crab roll and a spicy hamachi roll. Although the sushi was tasty, I did think that the sesame seeds encrusting the rice sort of overpowered the taste of the fish. But aside from that, the sushi was good and the soft shell crab having just been fried, was warm and crispy.For our main courses, I had the Halibut and the Black Cod.  My halibut was cooked to meltingly tender perfection. It was smeared on top with fermented black bean paste and had a salad of scallions and cilantro on top. It was sitting in a pool of broth with a few drops of chili oil. The flavors were more Chinese than Japanese but I enjoyed it all the same. The black cod was coated in sweet miso and was also very tender. I think I preferred the halibut to the black cod simply because black cod is too rich for me. I liked the little side garnish of sweet Japanese black beans. The pickled skin of bell peppers not so much.A birthday dessert had been pre-ordered and they came out with a lovely plate that had a lit candle, 3 tiny desserts, and 'Happy Birthday' scrawled across the plate in chocolate. The 3 desserts were a red bean macaroon, a square of tofu cheesecake, and a chocolate fruit tart. I also had the Earl Grey creme brulee and let me tell you... so good! It was topped with an orange sorbet, spring roll wrapper tuille, and candied orange peel and I wanted to.. well I don't know exactly what I wanted to do but it was so good I almost felt tears coming to my eyes.I always say that good food will leave you speechless but apparently that's not quite right since this review has turned out to be quite wordy.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We ordered the toro tartare, oyster foie gras, beef curry bread and a few rolls to start. For our entrees we ordered Sea Bass, Angry Chicken, Seafood 'Toban Yaki', Buri Bop (recommended by the waitress) and the ramen soup for my 7 year old nephew (also recommended by the waitress). The appetizers were ok. We read a lot of reviews saying that the toro tartare's a must but we didn't think it was that great and we're big sushi/sashimi lovers. It was interesting at best. They make the buri bop sound cool but it's nothing more than Korean dol sot bi bim bap. The ramen soup that chef morimoto supposedly eats all the time according to the waitress was extremely oily and bland. The toban yaki was probably the best thing we ordered. My angry chicken was bloody... When I called the waitress over she tried telling me it was fully cooked but did offer to let me change my order. I ordered the halibut and although the fish was cooked very well the dish itself was extremely oily and tasted strongly of sesame oil. No matter how well the fish was cooked i couldn't get over the strong sesame oil flavor that made me feel like i was drinking a bottle of sesame oil. Also, once I received my halibut the wait staff stopped coming to our table. They went to the table next to ours but not ours. We sat there for about 10 minutes after we were done and my brother-in-law raised his hand but the waitress looked at him and just walked away.

They were soooooooooooooo good... Super fresh, and super good... Peek foto! The presentation was quite nice, having the hibiscus in the middle, and a peachy tasting fig in the middle to cleanse the palate... Now, that's art! They came with 3 different types, but I must say, from spicy, ginger scallion, and the ceviche - the ceviche one was the best. You get 6 pieces, but try getting the 12 because 1/2 a dz was tease...Onto the foodies:-Unagi and foie gras bop $26 - prepared like those Korean bibimbop (fried rice) but in those stone type kinda bowls, but not really...Mixed in with a side of miso soup (a bit bland but jesus! They sure ain't cheap with their tofu! It was humongo! Peek foto!) and mixed greens w/ kabusu vinaigrette... the tofu melted right in your mouth and it was soo good. The vinaigrette - again, a bit bland but just ask for an extra on the side and just dip/pour as you please. It must be me, as a Korean, who always needs an extra punch of that spiciness/flavor... As an unagi and a foie gras whore, I'm thinking, o dang~ foie gras and unagi huh? But really, It's not as bad as you think... basically, its just unagi throughout and just a teeny weeny piece of foie gras. Literally the size of those Andes Mt Mint Chocolate... so $26 - not worth it... -Beef gyudon- $18 : Picture an upscale version of Yoshinoya's beef bowl ... It was super sweet, and the fried egg that was on the top was super cute ... Ordering this alone can cause you to have the runs, unless you decide to order something with it... -Ramen soup $14: This was super good... Like the miso, the ramen was a bit bland, but the chicken and the soup was sooo good... It left a clean after taste.. the chicken was super tender, noodles cooked well ... I would order this again in a heartbeat!-Roasted Blk cod $24: came out bento style ... As a black cod lover, it's quite disappointing because it was sucha small ass piece, but if you do end up getting the bento style lunch, you get a choice of sushi, tempura, miso, salad and more, like any typical bento lunch. I suggest you getting some other dish because you can get all the goodies cheaper and just as good someplace else. Not worth it. PASS.-Soft shell crab $12.. The sushi has got to go. Not fresh and not exciting enough to indulge yourself for more. I can never get enough of sushi, but this was pretty sorry...   =( o dang, and this is a Japanese place? -We ending up sharing 2 bottles of still water, coming out to be $8/bottle.*~*~*the restrooms were ok, not dirty, but smelly, but that's a given, and that's not Morimoto's fault.Servers were appropriate, helpful and easygoing -- full of smiles. Food was above average -- ""delicious"" wouldn't be the word for it ... more like, tasty... when in doubt, when looking for authenticity, Morimoto is not a place to be. This place is more of a place where you would like to be ""seen..."" which is so not my scene/style. In other words, it's very LA... an LA place placed in the heart of New York. Perhaps, I'll return in a few for a martini or a drink, but give me a few minutes about the food.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The Tuna Tartare was fantastic - it was the first time that I've tried Toro and it was everything I imagined it to be. I stopped using the dips after a few spoons because I wanted to enjoy the true taste of the Toro. However, the seaweed and wasabi dips were lovely compliments. The Red Snapper and Seasonal Salmon sashimi were incredible - full of unique flavor and texture. The pieces were delicate and far from the chewy slices you find at sushi buffets. The Uni was interesting...it was also my first time trying Uni. It tasted like the sea, with a bit of a sweetness. The Beef Carpaccio was our favorite dish. Thin slices of tender beef, slightly cooked in the hot oil that had been drizzled over the top. We finished with the Trout, which was. of course, perfectly cooked. It tasted like a light salmon and the black truffle oil made a lasting impression. The turnip puree had a little too much butter, which I thought overpowered the trout. I ate it separately :). I think there should have been a bit more crispy proschuitto as well. Service was impeccable and attentive - I really wish I remembered our server's name.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Overall I would visit this place again but definitely check reviews about which dish is worth ordering. My favorite was Tuna Pizza and the Spicy King Crab. The sushi combo for $90 was just not worth it. Most of the sushi in the combo tasted just so so. I guess next time I would be better of ordering individual maki rolls.

WOW... The tempura is covered with two different sauces and both of them are out of the world. Highly recommend this for anyone and everyone who makes it to morimotoEntrée:- Sashimi chef's combinations: Again a winner in every sense. The fish was the freshest I have had ever. It comes with an assortment of fish and caviar. Fish cuts include tuna, fatty tuna, salmon, yellow tail etc.- Sushi Rolls: We tried quite a few rolls - California, spicy tuna, spicy salmon, salmon skin, eel avocado roll.

As this was my first visit, I found the menu choices to be bewildering and decided to go with the Omakase tasting menu. I will order a la carte at my next visit. We started with toro tartare box with multiple sauces underneath. One scrapes the tartare from the box with a very interesting small metal utensil. A fish carpaccio with mushrooms followed. Then came a vegetable dish with a carrot and cauliflower which were to be dipped into a sauce presented in a heated cup. Excellent oyster with soy sauce, uni, and foie gras was next. Six selected pieces of sushi were then beautifully presented. The palate cleanser was a housemade ginger ale that was slightly ""stronger"" than expected, but I enjoyed the surprise. The surf and turf dish consisted of a delicious square piece of Kobe beef added to a crab leg. A poppy seed pastry was added to coffee creme dessert.

Morimoto is like high-end clothes shopping.  In the end, do the clothes I buy at Hugo Boss make me look better than the clothes that I buy at the Gap?  No, probably not.  Do I enjoy shopping at Hugo Buss much more, and having an attentive staff cater to my every whim while laughing at the riffraff outside?  Hells yes.Rock on, Morimoto.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Followed by sushi with perfectly cooked sushi rice.  Surf and turf lobster and steak was goooood.

The decor is beautiful, designed by super famous architect Tadao Ando. The food is perfectly presented. I didn't try any of the appetizers, but if they are anything like the entrees, I'll bet they were delicious!

I'm always hesitant to order fish when I go out to restaurants, because in my opinion, its so easy to screw up. They can come out too dry, too crunchy, too flavorless. But Morimoto's made it perfectly juicy and tender. The flavors were really good. The cod is probably the best. 

I'm usually not a ""citrus"" person when it comes to desserts, but the elderberry creme brulee was absolutely to die for. It had citrus accents, but the flavors blended so well together, oh my god...

So let's talk about what makes Morimoto's memorable (or not):- The service was remarkably accessible, and I felt like I was a normal human being here. -The decor is very chic, and I'd definitely come back to visit the bar, especially since it is not far from home (although the location has much to be desired, being located under a dark passageway and amidst much scaffolding). Considering the contrast between the outside and the inside, you'll feel you've been transported to an alien alternate universe. Interesting bathrooms with the highest tech Japanese toilets (at least in America). Still can't say I like the idea of a bathroom attendant. - Good Asian fused food, but not necessarily the best. The black cod, in my opinion, was better at Nobu; the angry crab doesn't beat davidburke&donatella's angry lobster. But all delicious no less, and you will go home generally happy. Also, don't waste stomach space on sushi - it's no better here and not worth it over the other dishes (as with most high end Japanese places).- I didn't pay, but I'm sure it's understood that it will be $$$$.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I've been here a few times and the last experience overfilled the greatness cup - and I just can't hold it in anymore.Came here with a date on a Saturday night at 9PM, with no reservations to see if we can get a table. We weren't really counting on it, because the place was packed, with people waiting outside. The very friendly hostess says 'No problem'! Awesome. They gave us no estimate but said it wouldn't be too long - and asked us to wait at the bar area, which is cool looking.We got martinis and my date promptly spilled the whole thing on the bar. The bartender was really nice about it and didn't look in the least bit annoyed. A bus boy appeared out of thin air and cleaned up the mess while another martini was being made.Just as this is happening  guess who sits down right next to us? Taylor Hicks of American Idol fame. Granted, not exactly a celebrity but an entertaining sighting nonetheless. We were seated before we were half way through with our drinks - so about 15 minutes on a really busy night. We also managed to get an amazing table with a good amount of privacy.For some reason they weren't doing omakase, which confused us, but our waiter offered to put together a tasting menu promising us we will sample the best of the best. We went for it. Just as our first delicious course arrived we saw T.H. getting seated. Everyone gets equal treatment here- I really liked that!The food was amazing.

If you stick to sushi and avoid appetizers and drinks, it might be worth the high cost. Specifically, the salmon sushi and sashimi were the best I have ever had in my life. The sushi and sashimi were very good, and so were the artisan sorbets. Nothing else seemed to be worth the hefty price tag. The lobster fritter appetizer was entirely unimpressive, especially given the $12 price tag and the fact that there was best case scenario only an ounce of lobster in them. The alcohol was good, but nothing special and also very costly.

The banana mousse was light and airy served with a crispy macaroon and passion fruit sauce.  I can't vouch for the sushi but I highly recommend visiting Morimoto's for their cooked dishes.  The combinations of flavors complement each other well, producing fantastic end results that are unique and delicious.  It is indeed a splurge but one worth the money.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Before I go into the food, I must say the ambiance and decor of the restaurant is really nice.  They have a wall next to the stairs that is completely made out of crystal lights.  Our table was the closest one to it so it was nice to take pictures by it.  The outside of the bathroom door looks like a closet door which was weird but the inside was kinda cool.  Check my pics.  Anyhow here is what was in the 8 course tasting menu that I had:1. Toro Tartare (mediocre)2. Kampachi Yellowtail with other assorted sashimi (pretty good)3. Seared Salmon (ok)4. Duck Foie Gras (good because all it is is basically fat)5. Assorted sushi including Toro and Barracuda (the toro in this dish was the best by FAR. it was perfect and completely thawed. just wish they gave more of it)6. Matcha Green Tea and red bean filled Macaroon (how good can green tea get?)7. Split Roasted Lobster with Garam Masala and a slice of Kobe Beef (this was better than average)8. Souffle and Vanilla bean ice cream over red bean (better than average)The dishes were all pretty tasty but I must say I probably wouldn't order it again.  It was great being able to taste all the different dishes but the chef could have had more of an assortment.  Not that I don't like sashimi and sushi but I'm sure there were some other items on the menu he could have thrown in there and I probably would have preferred.  One more thing, we also ordered a plate of Fugu before the Omakase and it was decent, mostly because the Ponzu sauce was YUM.  The consistency of the Fugu was just ok but the Ponzu sauce was right on. Service was good as expected for this type of restaurant.  Waiters were constanty checking to see if everyone had finished their course so that they can clear the dish and get ready for the next dish.

The exterior is understated but inside is a different world. It's beautiful and modern with open spaces that are separated by clear glass panes or with sparking dividers. The furniture is contemporary and white is the predominant color. One might think the lighting would be harsh but it glows softly, as if by candlelight. There are stairs just beyond the entrance to a basement below with a sleek bar and comfy seats for lounging.The menu is much more diverse than the one in Philly. As always my friends and I ordered a bunch of small plates for sharing:Wagyu carpaccio with microgreens- I needed to try one item that I had in Philly, as a benchmark for comparison. The portions are definitely more generous in Philly, but taste and quality were fantastic and the presentation was beautiful. I don't remember if the price reflects the quantity.Toro tartare with a gorgeous rainbow of accoutrements incliding wasabi, creame fraiche, caviar and a soy based sauce. The different condiments were fun to try and they changed the flavor experience of the tartare. Most creative toro tartare I've had.Braised black cod is always a great dish and this fish was so luxuriously silky soft it nearly dissolved on contact. Outstanding, and I generally prefer seared for that sweet caramelized skin.Morimoto sashimi- this looks like a mini sashimi terrine and is another aesthetic and gustatory triumph. There are layers of different fish sashimi including toro, salmon, tuna, hamachi and eel. It's sliced into six bite sized portions and each is topped with a different garnish.Unfortunately the sashimi wasn't good at all. It was quite shocking for a high class Japenese restaurant with an Iron Chef at the helm. Another Morimoto restaurant where the hot dishes outshine the sashimi.

We shared the tartare apetizer (subtle, sophisticated), the sushis (excellent though nothing original there), the scallops apetizer (spicy and sour, really good), and the spicy crab apetizer (lots of meat and excellent)The other reason why I give only 4 stars is the white wall on our side covered with big black traces of sauce and fat...

This place has unbelievable decor -- really outstanding looking (the scale of which you would expect to find in LA, not NYC).  2. The service was very impressive.  3. The bathroom.  I'm serious.  First of all, they have heated toilets (HEATED TOILETS!?).  The kind you find in Japan that also offer ""drying"" and douching services.  But there is just something about sitting down on a heated toilet seat that you gotta love.  The toilet stalls are also rather strange in that they have this weird plexiglas background that makes you feel like either you are in the woods, or there is someone standing on the either side watching you pee.  Either way, definitely an experience.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I got the cucumber roll, and it was good but nothing more special than veggie sushi anywhere else.My dining companions (all non-vegetarians) were blown away by their meals. The dishes were truly works of art. My boyfriend's appetizer was gorgeous and delicious according to him. My brother said that his fish entree was the best he'd ever had. Since I can't speak much to the food at this place, I will say that the decor and atmosphere is worth a visit. The tables are sectioned off by glass walls, lending a bit of privacy from nearby diners but not making you feel closed-off. And, seriously, if you don't use the bathrooms, you are missing out. They have this crazy mirrored wall behind the toilet that has an infinity cherry blossom type tree thing going.

Our waiter was even better, she was sooo damn helpful. Briefly telling us about the menu and her faves; her sincerity and warmness was awesome.We had the:* rock shrimp tempura - very good; warm chunks of tempura shrimp marinated in two different sauces: a wasabi & spicy _?_ sauce, similar to buffalo wing sauce (it did come with a side of ranch, lol)* miso clam soup - MMMmm, saturated the liquor inside of me, got me feeling all warm and fuzzy in a different way * calamari salad - OMG I loved it, so good especially with a salad. The calamari was nicely done with a thin coat of crispiness, and the greens was fresh, and tasty because of the white miso dressing.* rib-eye - very good; more rare than what my bf wanted but it was fine, the accompanied sauce was so savory that I kept dabbing into it* sea bass - not buttery soft like I anticipated but it was very satisfying nonetheless, two nice fullfilling pieces with eggplant in miso* chocolate pecan brownie - not bad, the brownie broke apart easily but the expresso ice cream was rich - I scooped it all off my bf's dessert and topped it on mine* earl gray creme brulee - with orange sorbet, I slid the sorbet to the side for the expresso. Not that the sorbet was bad, my creamy dessert went better with the expresso ice cream.What an incredible experience my fives senses had.

The food, unfortunately, didn't match the quality of the decoration/architecture. We ordered the omakase along with several other dishes. The tuna tartar has the most beautiful presentation and has many types of sauce to accompany the tartar. The ceviche fell flat and contained too much oil. Smoked salmon was poorly paired with yogurt and spinach. The biggest dissapointment was the oyster with foie gras. The addition of 8 cubic cm of teriyaki sauce ruined our ability to enjoy the oyster and foie gras pairing. I can go on and on with the other entrees but there's a common theme: The food could have been better with less oil or less sauce.The service is extremely poor. Our server didn't care about our requests and we ended up being helped by the manager to get green tea or cocktail orders.To sum up, if you were to spend money, Nobu would have been a better choice.

2296,AsshXmcmq-oWwzSGoiB2bA,Emilio G.,3.0 star rating,"Tired from walking up and down Rockefeller and Chinatown we arrive at the Morimoto entrance. I stop and question my girlfriend, ""this is the place? I guess so."" Covering the entrance are reddish-orange drapes as if they were concealing a masterpiece of art. We see people inside and as we get closer, the glass sliding doors open. I immediately feel like I'm in some sort of futuristic movie, and another set of glass sliding doors open up. We are half an hour early for our reservation but the hostess quickly takes our coats and takes us to our seats. As we walk to our table and I glance around the restaurant. The decor is definitely a new-age type fusion and everything about it from the chairs to the exit signs screams, ""I'm new, hip and stylish."" The restaurant was dimly lit with some orange, red and blue soft lighting scattered throughout. The walls and ceiling where white and the separating glass had a foggy white tint. The tables were pine as well as the chairs, which were kind of boxy. The padding on the chairs was also white and very comfortable, almost as if it was at some sort of hookah bar or Amsterdam coffee shop.  Without even a chance to catch my breath (keep in mind we had walked several hours before arriving) our server Freddie approached us and offered us something to drink other than water, as he filled our glasses. I asked him to give us a little time and went to wash my hands in the rest room. The door to the restroom slid open using a single handle bar and located on the wall was the lock button. By pressing the button the door would lock and an occupied sign would be lit from the outside. The restrooms were super clean and looked like something out of the Jetsons. You had to slide the door to go in, and to lock the door you pressed a button that lit up. Freddie was really friendly and always eager to help answer any questions we may have. He recommended a pear-flavored sake called Ginjo, which we decided to order. He brought it out in a dark stone looking ceramic bucket filled with ice. The sake container was glass that looked like a cross between a beaker and a piece of bamboo. The sake was very smooth, and we were both very pleased. Now having some time to take in the whole restaurant I notice that the music was a tad bit too loud. Playing through the speakers was lounge/trip hop/down tempo style music, giving a cool relax feeling. The atmosphere of the restaurant gave a sense of serenity and tranquility to customers, servers, and even to the maître d. Still undecided on what to eat Freddie recommend to us the Chef's choice, a 7 coarse dinner. I told him we had to think about it for a while. The menu was relatively clear, simple, and most likely type up that same day. I was a little lost trying to look through it since the spacing between the texts was small. I mentioned we had a jazz performance to catch at 9pm and he said we'd have plenty of time, and that if we felt like eating quickly he would bring out the dishes faster. We decided to go with the 7 coarse dinner. Without letting my sake cup get to low he kindly refilled it without intruding too much. The first course was quickly brought out and Freddie began explaining the contents of our artfully designed dish. It was a tuna tartar spread over a centimeter deep 4x3 inch box. In the center of the dish was a quarter size dab of caviar with the bottom of the box containing a rainbow of dark colors and flavors (wasabi paste, sour-cream, seaweed paste, chopped chives, avocado paste, and crunchy rice balls). Freddie then proceeded to explain how to eat the dish. He said to take the little scrapper and scoop the tuna with a little bit of the caviar and dip it in the sauce, then play with the different flavors. The next 6 course where presented to us in a similar fashion. A couple of times I had to ask the server or food runner to repeat the explanation since I wasn't able to hear over the music. The second dish contained a thinly sliced white fish with mushrooms; slivers of beets and pea shoot leaves. The third was a fondue style dish with a bread tasting, duck sausage ball, baby carrot, fennel, grape tomato, mini bell pepper and radish. The dipping sauce was sesame oil with a miso paste. The candle keeping the sauce warm was a little too close in my opinion and made the oil too hot. The fourth dish was a baked oyster with froi gras and uni drizzled with oyster sauce, this was my girlfriend's favorite dish. The fifth dish was a traditional sushi platter with 4 different types of fish and piece of raw squid. Following the sushi was a nice, light, refreshing house made ginger ale, which they said was our intermission. Our sixth course was a play on the American surf and turf. A delicious grilled piece of lobster trail, which would have been twice as good had they lightened up on the spices, and a flash grilled piece of Kobe beef with some glazed sweet potatoes. ...ran out of space, my Gastronomy paper was longer than i thought, LOL.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I kept saying ""I'm SOO sorry, but I have to change our reservation again!""  They were completely professional and made the changes without being rude.  Our party got bigger, then smaller and then bigger again. I was impressed that they were not snooty and annoyed at me because I called 3-4 times on the day of the dinner!When we sat down, we noticed that our table was right next to the front doors and every time it opened, we'd get a burst of cold air.  My girlfriend and I were sitting at the very edge, so when it got to be unbearable, we asked if we could move.  The manager was more than sweet and she moved us down without making a fuss.  Nice!Our food came out in a timely manner and it was pretty delicious! I started with the rock shrimp appetizer and a couple others got this lobster/crab appetizer. Both were delicious!  When our dishes came out, a very apologetic waiter came to my hubs and said that his filet came out too overcooked so that they are cooking it again at the moment.  That was surprising to me because they cared so much on making it exactly the way he had requested.  So instead of being annoyed for his food not coming out on time, my hubs picked on our plates and was fine knowing that it was on its way to be made perfect.When his filet came out, the waiter apologized again.  The filet was DELICIOUS. Worth the wait. Melted like butter in your mouth.  Also, my friend's black cod was amazing!! Everyone should definitely get that as their first dish----I highly recommend it!!Let me tell you the best part of the night... We got to meet THE Iron Chef!! We saw him greeting other tables and wondered if he'd come by ours.  A waiter told us a couple times that he would come by our table so we got really nervous and wondered if he'd take a picture with us.He came by and shook every single one of our hands with a big smile. When we asked to take a picture, he said ""Sure!"" He made us all say ""Sushi!"" to the camera.  My friend, who is a crazy huge fan of his, really wanted a 1-1 picture with him and he was totally for it. He even made bunny ears in the picture!

But I expected to be wowed by the food, and it didn't happen. The prix fixe menu for restaurant week included one entree among three (sushi selection, braised black cod, and ""angry chicken""), and came with a salad and miso soup. We got all three to share:- The sushi was very good, but not otherworldly as I expected.- The cod was definitely the better of the three dishes. It was very tasty (great sauce), but also really tiny. A side of rice or vegetables (even small) would have been great (it came with, literally, four Japanese black beans... and I really mean four). - The chicken was tasty but, again, not extraordinary. It came in a spicy curry(?) sauce and with crispy noodles. Good but not worth the price. I'm sure other items on the menu would have been more impressive, but given the high prices I won't be going back any time soon. My cocktail (called hydrangea) was great.

I'm writing this now because I didn't have a yelp account then.]Most people know Morimoto as iron chef japan from the original as well as the current iron chef show. I'm sure I'm not the only one who drooled like a starving puppy while watching him cook incredible dishes in only an hour! ""I must go to his restaurant.""Seeing how I would have to sell a kidney to afford his food, I patiently waited for restaurant week and immediately made a reservation once the opportunity arose. The interior of Morimoto is definitely different than most places I've been to - it's very.. cold and aggressive. I like it!I wish the food was as good as the interior however.. For my prix fixe lunch I had a tuna salad as an appetizer, black cod with dashi sauce for my entree, and a mango panna cotta for dessert. We also ordered an eel and avocado roll to share. ... Seriously? What is this? I could find better food in my school's cafeteria. (If my cafeteria served cod with miso. You know what I mean)I'm neutral about the salad because it's a starter salad. Whatever.  I'm very dissapointed about the entree though. On paper, cod with a dashi sauce sounded delicious! When it came out, I was surprised at how big the piece of fish is considering cod is an expensive fish. Under it was avocado tempura and roasted red bell pepper. The sauce was poured on top of everything. Since nothing was really heavily seasoned in this dish, I expected the sauce to really shine. This gloopy sauce was basically a mild dashi broth thickened with cornstarch. COME ON. It  was not a very flavorful meal. The avocado tempura was interesting though - I've never had it before. It wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be.The eel/avocado roll, for this kind of place and the price, was disappointing. It wasn't bad but I could get this same or even better quality in my local sushi restaurant. Fail.Then came dessert. The clouds parted and rays of golden sunshine shone on my grey table. The rays of sunshine being mango panna cotta! It was served with a tiny biscuit and had a layer of mango puree. It also had a subtle taste of coconut in the custard which paired very nicely with the tropical mango flavor. It wasn't too sweet but not bland either. Just right. Service was good too, nothing amazing or terrible enough to write anything significant about it.So Morimoto, I give you one star because you look cool and have kickass bathrooms.

2313,X8tB-jInVGNCUTp7oi5QWA,Sarah W.,2.0 star rating,"Dear Mr. Masaharu Morimoto,Just want to make sure if I was indeed in your restaurant some weeks ago. Your automatic sliding door struck me with an impression that I might have been overdosed with Umami(savoriness). Please do not take me wrong way. I meant  that I was so pickled in the universal Umami pool. In the worst implication - MSG. I was not at all impressed and it took me long time to even start writing about because I loved you and still love you. You are a Iron Chef ""America"".  Well said, I guess you are now Americanized. The place was filled with Americans not Japanese(?). That only says a million words. The decor was glamorous in white but, made me realize that plastics do not last - remember 70's? 80's? they were once so fabulous but, what do you see now? At least, natural decor gets better with age and resonates history. But, do please know that the enterence was grande and thumbs up, some walls and the ceilings were notable for the architecture. Warm and cozy high-tech(?) bidet bathroom. However, the table settings look like one of cheap laminates...and scratched.  The proximity between the tables are so close that we feel like we are not dining alone. The tables were so small and even paying $120 each person we were sit at a tiny sized table next to the wall feeling like we are in a starbucks.  The wait staffs could not even see my face unless I turn my whole body b/c they have to stand between the tables, their knees hitting our table. What does that mean? the next table must have a look of their behind.  Enuff is said.....The food. We had the tasting menu shared and a braised cod. The first course, tuna tartare pate spread in a bamboo case was a brilliant idea. The presentation, the accompanied dipping sauces are superb. But, that was the high point of the night and everything went downhill since. The thin fluke sashima was overpowered by the Yuzu oil & the smashed ginger sauce. I have seen this sauce for some liver sashima in a japanese Yakitori place. The powerful sauce to cover the strong gaminess of livers but this fluke, I found it unnecessary. The oyster and uni in Hoisin/oyster sauce, I detest this dish completely. The real ingredients were totally lost in the concentrated MSG sauce. mehhhh. Is this Japanese? The charcoal smoked sushis were nothing special. The grilled Kobe beef was salty and chewy. It seems like the marinating sauce was too salty/concentrated to begin with.. I do marinate Korean BBQ making the sauce from scratch so I know why this happened. It came with syrup coated fried sweet potato wedges to balance the saltiness but wasn't successful. The sweet potato dish is very common in Asia but mostly as dessert. I like it but not with the beef. Next, the Lobster, I felt that the lobster was wasted. The marination in the red pepper sauce completely shrunk the tender meat. That's why we don't use lobster in our seafood casserole. Also the sauce tasted like the dry powder comes with one of Korean instant noodles. This might have worked with Crabs instead.. seriously.  At last, after all, I wanted to love the braised Black Cod but this wasn't the Miso grilled which he cooked so heavenly in Nobu. Again, it tasted Teriyakied and the cod was a OK.I did like the dessert until we see the check. The waitress said that we get a desert as a part of the Omasake tasting menu but we can choose different one. We did choose a different one but she brought both out not replacing it. How difficult for her to ask us and make sure what we want to order before she zoomed to the kitchen? Un-refined service. So we had 6 course that were so called ""micro"" sized as per my friend. and overfed with two deserts which was quite italian for some reason. So again, let's study the night at the Morimoto. The french pate with japanese dipping sauces, Chinese teriyaki oyster & Uni, Overly chewy Kobe beef (this tasted like korean dish called Neo-Bi-Ani - failed), Korean Ramen seasoned Lobster and Italian biscuit and Gelatos. Am I too underating? Maybe..... but do we want to come back? Nah... Once was enough.. We are going to Omen. Or maybe going to Kenka where Morimoto loves.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

2318,pGyY42QiNRHvZ-ZN4LEvEw,Laura A.,2.0 star rating,"I'm in pain; in pain for the idol's fall and in pain for the amazing dinner that I could have enjoy at Omen, Perry Street (Marea? Jean Georges? probably) with the $120 that I spent at Morimoto. The restaurant is huge and beautiful. Glass inspiration, white colors, 2 floors. The main dining room at the street level is divided in 2 for the stairs that drive you down to the bar area where there is also tables to grab some food.  I was surprise seeing so much life inside; it was pack, lot of workers running around, DJ type music, a little loud tho, and sexy ambiance like a nightlife venue. The service was very good, even being that busy, although the bar was kind of crazy and I have the impression of disorganization over there. Sake and wine are clearly the principal at Morimoto, the selection for both is wide; they have also signature cocktails that it was demanded for me being in this ambiance. I choose White Lili which is a premium Shochu based drink with citrus scents: a little sweet , a little bitter and quite strong. I loved it even not being as sophisticated as the ones that you get in speakeasies, but that I actually told to Kenta, one of the Pegu's mixologist where we went after Morimoto. I wish to know Pegu's version for White Lili. My friend order a Lychee cocktail which wasn't as good. it was too much sweet too much bitter and it didn't combine very well. Once we were seated in our table I could see that there were not Asians customers. Being 2 people we order Braised Black Cod with ginger-soy reduction and the Morimoto Omasake, a chef's choice multi-course tasting menu consisting in 5 appetizer-size dishes and a main course. The presentation was beautiful for all the dishes and sharing the Omasake and another main entree was more than enough. The Omasake change depending of the chef and a different server introduce each dish. The servers and food exhibition started with Tuna Tartar along 6 different dipping sauces. I really like it. It was well done, ground meat version instead chopped as is served in many Italian restaurants, almost like a paste. Except one, I loved all the sauces. Next we got Whitefish Sashimi which was ok. Nothing impressive but coming with a sauce that I didn't like. Next course was good and impressive. I'll skip the fact that was also a little overdressed. It was a smoked fish that looked like meat actually; it melted in my mouth at the first moment. Raw inside, smoked outside.. I saw a flash of Iron Chef in this one. Next one was Oyster Foie Gras: market oysters, foie gras, uni and teriyaki sauce. I liked the texture and kind of enjoy the dressing, a mix of salty and sweet but a little too much again. The flash ceased very fast tho, and the Fashion show was followed for a mediocre 5 pieces of sushi, each one with a different fish including eel and scallop, but that wasn't impressive either the rice or the fish. The main course of the Omasake menu was Half lobster w/ side of citrus creme and Grilled Kobe slice on candied Mountain yams. I liked the lobster. It was grilled, juicy and tasty. The beef was good. I'm not a meat eater so can't be accurate but I know that the sauce killed the flavor. Too much dressing. The Braised Black Cod with ginger-soy reduction was ok. The piece was fresh but not juicy, it didn't melt and again overdressed, this time with an extra-sweet soy sauce. It gets the 4th position for Black cod in my rank, after Omen, Perry St and En Japanese Brasserie and its a rank with only 4 competitors so far... so the last one and being you the Iron Chef.  At least The Homemade Ginger Ale as transition between dishes, was really good. I loved it. But to summarize, the dinner was an exhibition of soy sauce more or less salty and/or sweet with stuff swimming on it. Sad and painful. As I said before  ""... there were not Asians .."" guess why.  I'm glad to say that I enjoyed the desserts. The one from the Omasake menu was Pumpkin souffle topped with ginger ice cream, candied Asian pear with ginger marshmallows. Really good. And the ginger marshmallows was interesting and original. Iron chef-ish. We also order the Tofu 'hot and cold' : soy milk soufflé, tofu cheesecake and maple ice cream. The ice cream was ok for me. But the cheesecake and the souffle was amazing. While I'm writing this I'm watching the Iron Chef Thanksgiving battle where you are Cora's partner against the others Iron Chefs. Lets say that the show keeps you maybe too busy to focus in your business . Lets say that. I'll still be your fan at the TV show since you always impress me, actually you are cooking in the battle this Lobster stew, Yakitori samples (Ducke skewers in 4 ways) and Tandoori Turkey that I wish I could try; but for Morimoto the restaurant, just give me the White Lilli recipe and then we can say goodbye each other.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I would put this place on the-bring-someone-you-want-to-impress-list not only because of the design but also because it's always packed. A lot of things reminded me of Nobu - which isn't surprising... We ordered the following apps: Hamachi tartar - a little too avant garde for me, I get that the Japanese are all about the packaging - but it seemed kinda overkill Rock shrimp tempura - I pretty much like anything fried, but this is exactly what you'd get at Nobu - definitely yummy Pork gyoza - eh, it's dumplings, solid...but I wouldn't say a must Steamed scallop - This was very good, scallops were light & broth was yummy, prepared well & a v. pretty dish Entrees - there was special - hamachi in a bi bim bop stone bowl - I didn't even get to try a bite, I looked over & my cousin's plate was empty - so in wolfing down factor, it must be pretty good Surf & turf - I didn't get to try the surf portion, again, when I looked over, that was gone - but the kobe was excellent Duck - this was a great dish, not what I'd expect for a Japanese restaurant but it was well prepared, flavorful & not greasy, which is huge because duck is a very fatty fowl & the croissant was yum-my! I ordered the chirashi - which I thought was ok - I think it was very traditional - b/c there was a lot of freaking mackerel in it. Personally, I'm not a mackerel sushi person...so be warned it's (ironically) a fishier dish than what I'm used to / expected - but the fish was fresh - so I'm sure people will scoff at my take on it & enjoy this dish - esp if they are more die hard than I am. The sushi platter ($35 portion) looked standard - my friend said it was very fresh (which is v. important when getting sushi) Rose sparkly by the glass - a fav! Chocolate melty cake (I know that's not the correct name but I know you know what I'm talking about) was good - w/caramel popcorn (which oddly, was my favorite part of the dish) Service was excellent, efficient, friendly - overall a very enjoyable meal with great ambience.With the food above & 2 glasses of sparkly, 4 grey goose & sodas & 2 sapporos - with tip total was $450 **Side note, I checked opentable for a reservation and there was nothing listed online but when I called in, I was able to get a reservation for 6 people, (although only 5 showed.)

Since it was our first time there, we decided to go with the Omakase - where you pay a set price, and the chef customizes a tasting menu to, well, his choice. We had the minimum, which was $200 each. Out of *pure* curiosity we asked about the 'maximum' - the chef told us there isn't a set maximum, although the highest he's seen during the few months they've been open was $1000 a person. I think that's insane, even by New York standards. I think we had 10 courses. I lost count. I just know that each course was amazing. A few stood out in my mind:1. One plate was all sashimi - i've never had such fresh fish. What's more, you're given a wasabi root and a file so you can make your own wasabi. super cool.2. rare mushroom soup - these mushrooms are shipped every few days from a part of Japan. it is cooked in this soup inside a small teapot; youo pour the soup into a cup to drink, and then eat the mushroom from the teapot. Overall - great experience. The waitress told me I was the first girl to finish all 10 courses. heck yea!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

They don't want you forgetting that you're eating in a fancy restaurant. Some nice Japanese touches in the bathroom. We didn't see the chef, but he's supposedly around 6 days a week.But I've never rated any restaurant on it's design or space. My rating is for the food.The ahi tuna pizza had the perfect flavor profile. The ingredients are ones you've had, but the combination is amazing.Kobe beef carpaccio was a little sweet, but still delicious.Kumamoto oysters topped with foie gras and sea urchin. Three strong flavors that I thought would clash, but I was wrong. Morimoto is right about all three.The sea bass was nice, but had a hard time following the other dishes since it's flavors were comparatively muted.Unexpected, but the dessert was almost the highlight. Pineapple bread pudding bore no resemblance to anything Japanese, but it was perfectly executed. ""Tastes like Hawaii"", my date said.

2342,CVmIivYTEvHhigmzhN36Xg,Denis K.,5.0 star rating,"**S.P.E.C.T.A.C.U.L.A.R.**Morimoto, the eponymous restaurant of the famous Iron Chef, is located in the same building as Chelsea Market. The interior has a super modern, but classy look. Cement pillars are offset with curvy peach curtains seeping out dim lighting. A glass bottle bottom wall surrounds the central staircase that leads down into the bar area. The bathrooms are downstairs. I made two trips down there. Once to wash my hands. The second because the birthday girl told me to check out the crazy looking loos and backwall. I admit, Morimoto has quite the bathroom. But, who cares about the bathroom if the food is not delectable. Never fear, Morimoto is the type of culinary experience where you can walk in with high expectations and still walk out amazed. Starter was toro tartare. It came in a little wooden box sitting in a bowl of ice and it's own scooping utensil - a type I've never seen before. The toro brought along two friends, a ponzu dipping and an another box full of flavor strips (wasabi, avocado etc). The server was kind enough to explain to us the a good way to enjoy the dish. Soft shell crab roll. This was a first for me. I'm not sure if I've had soft shell crab before, in roll form or otherwise. Crispy and soft at the same time. The crab was good.  I ate it all. Halibut and Black Cod. Both were very good and very pleasing dishes. I like fish with rich flesh so the cod was the winner for me. Artistically presented and beautifully crafted, the halibut and cod were very tasty and filling in all the right spots. Thinking back on these two dishes, I realized one thing. I need to go buy Morimoto's cookbook.. I washed everything down with sparking sake. A word on the sparkling sake. What a shame. A shame that I've never even heard of sparkling sake before Morimoto. I've been missing out and if you have too, the sake is a must. Dessert. Earl Grey Creme Brulee. Does that rhymn? Was that on purpose or a happy coincidence? Good good good. The birthday twist. I had called the birthday dinner ahead, so the service brought out a special birthday dessert plate. A candle. A chocolate Happy Birthday. A red bean macaroon. A tofu cheesecake. A chocolate fruit tart. One very happy birthday girl. The smile said it all. We had a wonderful time at Morimoto. The food was super superb. Really a notch above the rest. The service is prompt, courteous, and informative. We wanted for nothing at Morimoto. review 1/20/2008I.M.Y.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Must haves: 1) Toro tartare - Extremely crisp and refreshing appetizer served with caviar and an assortment of sauces. Got to love the mountain berry pallet cleanser 2) Sea bass - Sweet, salty, with a texture that just melts in your mouth Can live without: 1) Uni - Did not taste very fresh. They stated that it was flown in from California, but the texture was very gooey and not firm. 2) Kobe beef carpaccio - Tasted like your typical carpaccio. Nothing special. For some reason, I like the Morimoto's in Philadelphia better. It has a very similar decor, but the food is a little more edgy and fresh there.

Also super expensive and small portions, kind of like a hot stripper without implants who costs you a arm and leg and leaves u slightly satisfied.. 15 dollar cocktails, super fresh sushi and a fish entrees the meant for someone with a appetite to match that of a tea cup chihuahua. Be prepared to wait for your table and ""forced"" or rather asked to wait at the downstairs bar for your table to be ready. My table was sandwiched between two couples and be prepared to try your best to understand what your date is saying due to the fact of the annoying conversations people are having next to you. The table to right, featured a 23 year chubby broad dining with her wealthy father errr boyfriend, there conversations weird and it wasnt until she was bombed off sakai that it looked like they were having a good time. The table to my right featured a jerry springer look alike who clearly was forced to drag out his old hag wife here for a trendy anniversary dinner. Thank god they were quiet and quickly left once my date and i showed up. Seriously this is a good spot to take your dime piece or trophy girlfriend. I used this as my trump card, shows the chick you dont mind spending some coin on her and if shes not from Manhattan and isnt a foodie she will be blown away by this place. The waitstaff here is friendly, always looking to run up the bill and refill your water 50 times over the course of a hour and a half. Spealong of bills be prepared to spend close to 100 per person, if not more depending on how much you decide to drink. Not sure I'd come back here unless it was for a client dinner where there paying the tab or if I happen to one day get dragged here by a random bimbo who demands we dine here. The Seabass was very good, super fresh and perfectly cooked, only downside it was smaller than two rolls of quarters and featured a cold side of Avocado tempura. Dessert was a nice yet oreo sized brownie, perfect for the diet conscious horrible for fat over indulging animals like myself. Sushi was top notch, not only was it super fresh but you could tell this place gets the highest quality fish that is available.

2350,FcI0d51It1vrnSlBMbwLWA,Maggie A.,4.0 star rating,"Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto's restaurant, creatively named...Morimoto, is a solid dinner/drink spot.  Often forgotten, due to its age and and off the radar location, each dish is executed with thoughtful consideration to presentation, service and style.Morimoto's 12,000 square foot space, complete with draping white fabric ceilings, translucent glass bottle walls and an ultra mod bar downstairs, will make you feel far removed from the townhouse style restaurants that seem to be taking over lower Manhattan. Think the 'Jetsons go to Japan...'Be sure to make reservations in advance (2-3 weeks) if you're wanting to come during prime dinner hours.  The serving staff is a mix of Chelsea's finest (i.e. good looking gay men that likely dance or model during the day) and are well versed in exotic ingredients and cooking techniques.I consider this place great for inventive cocktails and, albeit pricey, dinner.  I usually get the Lotus Blossom drink with Bombay Sapphire, Yuzu and Calpico or the Morimoto Martini with Morimoto Junmai Sake, Smirnoff Vodka and Japanese Cucumber Slices ($14 each) - have two and you'll miraculously be speaking Japanese.  I also order either a mix of appetizers and entrees to share or the Omakase, which means ""chef's choice"" and includes a multi-course tasting menu designed by the kitchen ($120+ per person).  Unlike Omakease's that I have had at other restaurants, Morimoto's seems expensive for what you end up eating (other than the Toro Tartare) so I would recommend ordering a la carte.  Try the Octopus Carpaccio with Hot Oil and Mitsuba Leaf ($16) and my ultimate favorte, the Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura with Spicy 'Kochujan' Sauce and Wasabi Aïoli ($16).  I also like the Ishi Yaki Buri Bop as an entree, which includes Yellowtail on rice, cooked at your table in a hot stone bowl ($26).Forget the food and drinks... make sure to go to the bathroom and try out the TOTO Toilets.  trust. me.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Only to realize that this artistic ""rising sun"" is welcoming you into what might be one of the top 10 meals you encounter in New York. I know being a critic is easy and almost more interesting to read, but this restaurant didn't leave much to be critical of, quite honestly. We walked in met by a completely friendly host, who offered either an early seating or a drink at the bar. Of course we opted to belly up first and have one at the bar underneath the restaurant which was done beautifully with a contemporary flair.  After polishing off a specially-made twist on a shiso leaf ""mojito,"" soju-based I believe, we were ready to eat.Of course we had to go with the omakase dinner. There were really too many highlights to write about, so all I can promise is that every course escalated in both its flavors and surprises.From a sharkskin tray packed with ""toro tartare"" served with various types of sea salts, rice crackers, caviar to add both texture and flavor to each bite (one of the most unique serving techniques I've seen) to a miso broth gelee with a hint of wasabi and an accompanying roasted teriyaki foie gras oyster; every base was covered. Textures. Innovations. Unique serving techniques. Flavors. By the time the final course of 4 oz. of Wagyu beef accompanied by 1/2 of a spiny tailed, Indian-spiced lobster arrived we were grinning from ear to ear. Not to mention I skipped over telling all of you good folks about the sashimi plate with five sauces and a braised cod that was to die for. Now I will say, that for a menu with over 23 different desserts (we were eyeing a few from surrounding tables) that we probably didn't get the primo of the picks. Ours was a sweet potato souffle (in its own little custom steamer) with a quenelle of ginger ice-cream and azuki beans. not my fav but who's complaining?In the end, if you love food, then you should love Morimotos. Because honestly lose the clubby interior design, lose the bad-ass bathrooms (yes...as everyone has noted they are pretty sweet), lose the Iron Chef stigma, lose the prime Chelsea real estate and give me a slab of pine, a chair, me in flip-flops and cargo shorts and Moriomoto's omakase cuisine is still to die for.

I had terrible reception in that building so I had to run outside to use my cellphone and 7 times out of 10 I'd bump into Morimoto during one of his many cigarette breaks. At one point, I noticed he had lost considerable weight and complimented him. He smiled and bowed then patted his belly saying he just recently went on a diet. But I digress.We went here as a treat for a cousin who was visiting for a few days. We all decided to splurge and, as if our bank accounts could handle it, we went ahead and ordered Omakase for our entire table. Japanese for something along the lines of ""It's up to you,"" Omakase for us meant a multi-course meal (around 8 dishes with an amuse bouche thrown in here and there as well as desserts - yes, plural) that brought us to the borderline of taste bud heaven and foodie coma. Seriously, how can you lose with an opening that featured toro tartare and osetra caviar? Although, the most memorable part of the meal, we would have to say, was the lobster roasted in garam masala. Holy sweet Jesus and all that is good and righteous in the world. Pure insanity.The service was also impeccable. The server helped us choose a good sake to complement our upcoming barrage of flavors and whenever the dishes came, they were brought by an army of food runners to ensure that everyone got a plate at the same exact time. Meanwhile, our server would recite in great detail what each dish was composed of.

The bar downstairs is quite cool.  I'm not a fan of the Miami Vice aquamarine glass, but the space is nice, a combo  of low seats for private conversation, and barspace.  A great place to meet for a drink or go for the omakase seating.  Their separate styles of seating is interesting without seeming to ghettoize anyone in some netherworld of seating.  They had 12 sushi chefs working behind the bar, and it all looked efficient, featuring kohada and aji.  The kohada was firm and clean, but I wouldn't say the fish was particularly superb compared to other spots, although you could easily do worse and pay more.   They only take reservations up to 1 month in advance.  A place appropriate for your friends, a date or your family.   It has a cool, modern vibe, not too dark.  I would like to return for the omakase seating.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

But as a person who used to work at various sushi restaurants, I know too well how restaurants work: the more popular restaurants are, the fresher their ingredients are. Morimoto proves my theory. Especially for sushi, freshness is more important than anything else. The recession proof restaurant Morimoto can serve the freshest sushi is because it sells a lot so quickly that it can keep getting fresh fish directly from Tsukiji every other day. It's that simple. If you try their uni, you know what I mean.

The oyster foie gras was good, but too small.  It did make sense for the portions to be small though considering there were 8 courses, we were both pretty full by the end. I'm not a dessert guy, but the dessert bento box was definitely one of the highlights.If I was giving a rating just for food, I would have probably just given Morimoto 3 stars.  BUT, the place is amazing, just check out the pics in their website.  Morimoto totally delivers on the NYC experience, an experience that you just can't get anywhere else.  They have a wide selection of alcohol, which is always a plus for me =D  I have no idea what ""aged sake"" means, but there are a few sake & plum wine inspired cocktails that are definitely worth trying.  One more tip, after dinner, walk a 1/2 block up to this bar called The Park for a drink or two, very cool Asian theme bar with plenty of outdoor seating.(to be continued...)",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

2398,rvgEfXhRCOtrM0yW0SkEqw,Sarah L.,5.0 star rating,"Let me just start off by saying I am prone to judging restaurants by the quality of their bathrooms - so that alone should indicate that Morimoto is off the charts. It took me a good 3 minutes to figure out how to even open the door (let me save you the future embarrassment - SLIDE, don't push!) as it was basically a nondescript wall with a long handle on the side. After I managed to figure out the contraption and glanced around quickly to make sure no one had witnessed my ineptitude (which of course they did), I stepped inside what I could only deduce to be.. The Twilight Zone. Yup, you heard (er, read) me. I just compared a public lavatory to an alternate universe.  I freaked out about 3 times after I got into the stall - once for the automatic toilet lid, once for that trippy flower background that made me think somebody was going to peep through the glass, and the last when I realized the seat was heated (though it didn't take me long, I have a very sensitive nervous system. For those with the same, BE WARNED. It's pretty sweet after you get used to the initial shock though, and then you just think, 'This is brilliant WHY IS THIS NOT IN MY HOUSE RIGHT NOW?')Alright, moving on. What else? Oh right, the food. OK. So. Um, yeah. Everything sucked. HA! Kidding. Of course I'm kidding. We're talking about the freaking Iron Chef here, not those other watchamacallits flailing around with their pots and pans and heaps of fatty goodness on TV (Paula Deen, lookin' at you). I was with 9 other girls for my sister's bachelorette party so our shrill, overenthusiastic waitress took this opportunity to congratulate her profusely and then INSIST that she MUST try the white lily cocktail because it is TO DIE FOR. In fact, why not widely grin in everyone else's face and coerce them into getting it too? Oh, what's that? You don't drink? Well lucky for you, she's got a virgin available too and it tastes JUST AS DELICIOUS! Imagine that. Props to the lady for probably bringing in about 2/3 of Morimoto's business just from the intimidation of her nonstop chatter alone. To her credit, the cocktail was actually ah-mazing - it tasted like a pina colada with a few lemony drops to offset some of the sweetness. We got the tartare, kobe beef carpaccio, and the spicy king crab for appetizers and I must take this time to describe to you the utter ridiculousness that is Morimoto's toro tartare. Never mind that I had no idea (and still don't) what those two words meant - just know that it is like a soft blanket in your mouth. The caviar really just melts all at once and the way it's presented with the six different sauces and the delicate little scooping utensil is so distinct and lovely and unlike any dish I've ever seen or tasted that it definitely left a fond, lasting memory. My sister really liked the beef; I don't really remember it but the crab was also quite good with its warm spicy flavor, though it was a bit of a hassle to try to suck all the meat out without losing a few dignity points.Onto the main course: I ordered the roasted ocean trout, which looks very similar to salmon upon first glance but it's not, so - again saving you trouble - don't ask if it is! I think she gets that a lot because before I even finished my question, she promptly replied (with a beaming smile), ""It looks like salmon but it's trout, I promise."" Well whatever it was, I thoroughly enjoyed it and cleaned up every last bit on my plate. If Morimoto is known for anything, it's its surprising creativity - the texture of the soft, smooth trout with the subtle crispiness of the prosciutto and a dollop of miso sauce to top it off made for an interesting, slightly buttery but not too heavy result. All the components blended nicely and it left me feeling nice and satisfied but not nauseatingly full. DESSERT TIME! We got the tofu hot & cold (cheesecake and souffle were grade A's), chocolate ganache (not as tasty as expected), and the summer peach raspberry pudding, which was PERFECTION IN A BOWL. The light, creamy pudding paired with the sorbet was a refreshing combination and the little piece of gelatin reminded me of all the jello I ate in middle school, so it gets another boost for nostalgia too. It was, overall, a delightful confection and totally fit for a late-night summer treat. So that about sums up my first, and probably last dining experience at Morimoto. My taste buds had a blast, and the swanky interior with its wall of lighted bottles/glass was a visual feast as well and made for a nice background throughout my shameless photo-snapping. Though I will never again be able to afford such a meal, maybe it's best we end things this way with the initial magic still intact.

Unfortunately, we found out that the lunch menu differs from the dinner menu (specifically, the Duck Duck Duck is not available during lunch), but we went around that. I ordered the prix fixe of miso soup, sashimi salad, and dessert. It wasn't terribly priced for $30 before tax&tip. The miso soup was the norm (though a much larger bowl). The sashimi salad was edge-seared tuna on salad. It wasn't a huge portion, but perfect for lunch (and left me room to sample other places I wanted to try in Chelsea Market). Dessert was a delicious and light panna cotta... perfect end to a well-portioned lunch.I wish I'd gotten to try dinner here, as I think it would've been a totally different experience. Also, please note that this place is NOT a Japanese restaurant as some people were quick to criticize--it is fusion, which allows for artistic license.Design of the place is interesting and classy.The weird post-modern music is kind of annoying after a while, though it's probably drowned out when the place is busy at dinner (there was barely anyone there at lunch). Oh, and other notes about the decor: also the front door is covered up by red cloth... we would've missed it if we didn't know it was there.

Before coming, I was afraid I would dislike any snobby vibe I would get eating here, but the service we received was excellent. We all ordered the pre-fixed three course lunch bento with braised black cod, which I think might be offered year-round. To really experience the menu though, my friends and I ordered the tuna pizza and the raw oysters. The tuna pizza was creative and delicious, and so were the oysters, with a selection of 3 unique topping sauces. Our bento boxes were very chic, and gave us a chance to sample a little bit of everything. The braised black cod was melt in my mouth delicious. The bento box also came with some plain-looking salmon and tuna sushi. I thought it was plain-looking but it was NOT plain-tasting. Usually, I don't enjoy tuna sushi very much. I find it edible and can have a few pieces at other restaurants, but never usually find it as satisfying as salmon. The tuna sushi here just tasted damn good.

I wore jeans and a polo shirt. I first tried Toro Tartare to test the yelp hype. I didn't know what to expect except that it's supposed to be EPIC; it wasn't. It was this tiny paste of tuna spread thin on a wooden board size of an iPhone with 4-5 garnishes to eat with: guacamole, wasabi, sea weed, etc. Not filling or especially tasty. I would not get this again even if it were half its price. Surprisingly, despite the poor comments on sushi and rolls, the wagyu sushi i tried was phenomenal. It was ridiculously expensive (~$8 for a single sushi), but it resonated well with my image of an upper-end restaurant. The spicy tuna rolls were excellent as well. For my beverage, I tried morimojito (which wasn't on the menu); i don't really know mojitos well, but I didn't like this one. We ordered few other things and at the end paid around 200 dollars. In retro-respect, I enjoyed my experience getting the pizza at Luzzo's ($20) more. My recommendation: do make reservation but don't worry about semi-formal rule. Don't just get the entree blindly because it is praised on this site. If you're going to this restaurant to experience the ""iron-chef"" cooking, you will probably be disappointed.

Yes, we were fortunate enough, or should i say THAT I was lucky to have a boyfriend that had a $300 gift certificate to STARR restaurants from his client during the holidays.But I have to say that even though this meal was free...I would definitely go back and spend the money because it was goooood!First off, the host was great....Somehow he knew that it was our first time eating there probably because of my sheer happiness of finally getting to eat at an IRON CHEF restaurant.  I was excited.  He mentioned casually that he would try to get the chef to see us during our meal.  It did not even cross my mind that Morimoto himself would see us, I saw that there were a dozen chef in the see through kitchen.  But, it was HIM!! He came and said hello as we were finishing our dessert.For appetizer we ordered the Tuna Pizza.  It was delicious. The aoili on top was nice and creamy and went well with the blue fin tuna.The Kakuni was frikkin' orgasmic.  I mean seriously, you can't go wrong with slow roasted pork in a sweet soy scallion jus, the bed of congee was a nice balance to the salty and sweet.We also ordered the tempura calamari salad....also great.  The calamari was cooked perfectly.Needless to say, we were pretty stuffed by the time the entrees came along.  The portions are not tiny little things, mind you.  They give you a decent amount of food, not like other restaurants you go to and you pay a ridiculous amount of money and get a spoonful portion which i hate.Then came the best part of my meal.  I salivate just thinking about how perfect it was.  I had the black cod.  Not sure i remember how it was cooked but it was perfect ....it melted in your mouth and the glaze was simply delish and perfect.  My fiance (bf at the time) ordered the halibut with black bean sauce.  He loved it. But i thought it was a lil salty for my taste.For dessert, we had the warm chocolate cake with whisky caramel and tobacco creme and popcorn ice cream.  It was interesting.  I loved the popcorn ice cream.  Our waitress actually told us that they actually pop the popcorn and make the ice cream there fresh.  Service was impecabble.  Food was outstanding.   I dream of my return to Morimoto. -=D",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
2428,JbQ60L7ZNU6pRYe640NsOA,S Y.,2.0 star rating,"This review is about the Vegetarian menu (or lack thereof) only.Morimoto being my favorite Iron Chef, I couldn't wait to actually try his food on a recent Monday night at 8:30 in NYC.  I'm beating a fast retreat back to nobu (where I've previously had a fantastic vegetarian omakase tasting menu).My friend went for the Omakase tasting menu (reported that 5 of 7 courses were amazing, the 6th (the Waygu beef + lobster) was good but not to the level of the other courses and the dessert course, was the same.First bad sign for me, the server says ""no way that the kitchen could come up with a vegetarian omakase"".  Unbelievable.  This is Chef Morimoto and NYC and it's Japanese cuisine, for goodness sake.  Second, the server then recommends ordering 4 courses to keep pace with the omakase menu.   Which didn't really work because 1) the food at our table came out at all different times, i.e., rarely were we eating at the same time; 2) the portions for my ""regular"" dishes (vs. the omakase portions) were ""normal"" and therefore, I was stuffed by the second course (in retrospect, not a surprise since most people normally have 2 courses + dessert) and I basically felt like I was advised to order more food than necessary.Here's the breakdown.  First course was kappa maki and avocado maki - unremarkable.  Second course was Soba noodles.  Noodles were good but I've had better in SF, and it was funny to be instructed on ""how"" to eat them.  Third course was the Yuzu Dofu, which is made at the table.  Good, but served with the lobster sauce, which seemed strange since I had asked for the vegetarian omakase.  Fourth Course was the Bop (like a Dol Sot bi-bim-bop, but without all of the vegetables and the chili sauce).  This dish was actually very good.  Wish I'd gone with this one to the exclusion of the other dishes.  Also, by this point, had filled up on the rather uninspiring courses 1-3 so could not finish the Bop.In closing?  Go for the omakase tasting menu but leave your vegetarian loved ones at home.  Service and inflexibility of the kitchen leaves impression that they are catering to tourists with little knowledge re Asian food (i.e., the instructions given re how to eat soba noodles) and the kitchen is operating per a set protocol, i.e., they lack the talent or confidence to improvise.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Dont get me wrong there was nothing per say ""wrong"" with the service it was just blah, a blah waiter, blah table (sandwitched in between two other sets of couples - super dissapointing for such a huge place) and blah atmosphere (loud, obnoxious and anything but romantic).  The food was okay, it wasnt bad by any means but for the price it was NOTHING special. Also, yelpers, kindly STOP mislabeling pictures of food, people odrer and then find out its not what they thought it would be.  I ordered the Morimoto sashimi, expecting these nice layers of fish (as indicated by some Yelpers) and instead got a teeny tiny little plate with 5 TEENY TINY pieces of fish for $28! I could have taken regular sized sashimi or sushi for less than that!!! The torro tar tar is good, but not $31 good, and the waguy beef carpacio is also good but how much raw beef can you really eat?  The sushi that I had (spicy tuna, spicy yellow tail and soft shell crab roll) were good, and worth the price of $8 and $12 (thats really how much sushi costs in any basic restaurant now a days anyway so that was the only part of the mean that was not overpriced).  Finally perhaps the least delicious dish and sadly the most expensive one was my husband's waguy beef ribeye ($70) he said it was flavorless and was not cooked to his specifications (he asked for medium and got rare).  Oh and the ""sauteed vegetables"" side dish he got consisted of mushrooms and corn, wtf? If you want to over dress and go have overpriced drinks/dinner with your other trust fund friends by all means this is the place for you, for those of us working for our money I suggest spending it else where (like I dunno do down the street to Alexander McQueen and buy one of those $300 scull scarfs, they will cost less than dinner for two at Morimoto's and will last a lot longer!!!).",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I mean come on, toilets that clean the front and the back and also dry you? Perfecto.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The food, though, is why you come. Here, you should take the time to try something that seems outrageous. It seems to me, from my numerous meals here, that the more wild the concept, the better the execution.This is the guy from Iron Chef, remember. Tuna carpaccio pizza? Goooooood. Tuna tartare with a large assortment of condiments (including caviar and mayo. yes. caviar. and mayo.) arranged like a painter's palette? Gooooood. Asian-style bouillabaisse with Korean hot paste? Goooooood. And a sizeable lobster (no wait, it was a langoustine, so it was a French lobster) in the middle.Chicken ramen? For 14 bucks? Uh, not 14 bucks good. Sushi? Very well made, exceptionally well made, really, but I've had better elsewhere.Don't come to Morimoto's thinking it's just a Japanese place. Order wildly, and you don't leave disappointed.Or better yet, order the omakase (tasting menu) if you have the wherewithall, and let Mr. Morimoto pick for you. I've never gone wrong with omakase, and he might even wander by and ask in his fobby english how things are. Very nice guy.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The open, multi-tiered seating areas, the open kitchen, lower level bar, subtle traditional and modern entrance, the ceiling, and last but not least the chairs. All excellent. Having said that, we were a table of 8 and they sat us in a annex to the main room which is not as impressive and on the night the A/C was not working well and this annex was a little warm. I'm not letting the A/C problems reflect on the review because our complaints about it were handled in the most professional and courteous manner.The service in general is good but more casual than I expected. I didn't expect it to match Le Bernadin but it was definitely more casual than The Modern all of which of of the same sort of price range.The food was good and some dishes were excellent. The Kobe Carpacio was excellent, lobster fritters were very very good. As a main I had the Bass in a Miso sauce which was perfectly cooked and very very tasty. I also tasted the Bilimbab (sp?) which was lovely.. especially the rice. The Duck was also very tasty.We also had a Sushi course between appetizers and mains. I'm no expert on Sushi and haven't tried the best places in NY. I think the best I've tried was at Jewel Bako and I don't think Morimoto came close. Out of the sampler I think I went sushi gooey over 2-3 pieces out of a total of about 8-10 different pieces.We were given complimentary deserts (see A/C issue). One was a fruit tart/crumble (not sure what the Americans call this). The tart reminded me of the French pastries and was lovely but a little heavy on a warm night. The second desert was a coconut macaroon and ice cream and chocolate and was excellent. The presentation of all dishes was exceptional and when they arrived at the table looked like they should have been in a magazine.The drinks were great.

Even better, he made one of our sushi courses! Usually when you eat at celebrity chef's restaurant, the food isn't as good as you're hoping it'll be. At Morimoto's, the food is definately in honor of being an Iron Chef's restaurant (unlike another Iron Chef's restaurant I've been to).

In any event, first of all, service gets a full 5 Stars. From meet/greet to taking my order, serving, explaining (yes, some of the dishes came with server-delivered how tos) and assistance in deciding what to eat, the people who work there are brilliant.  The ambience was decent but way too loud and rowdy. And you don't really get the option of having a table all to yourself as party of 1, you're not even asked, which was fine, I understand the place was full, but I do wish they'd kept the music volumes lower so people wouldn't need to ""yell"" and thus, manage the noise pollution.  Now to the food. I have to agree with another reviewer who said the appetisers and sides are the main stars.  That is very true. I started with a Clam Miso Soup which was completely forgettable. Granted the molluscs were very fresh and the broth, light, but I was expecting something wow. Next, I had the Kakuni - AMAZING. Morimoto's take on the traditional Cantonese brekker of congee with braised pork belly was delicious, particularly with those light tendrils of crispy fried Sweet Spud. For my entree, I chose Duck Duck Duck and was terribly, terribly disappointed. It was crispy duck, it was tasty duck, it was moist duck but I could've gotten all that from any decent Asian eatery. And the foie gras mousse was practically nonexistent. I felt very let down. And then dessert arrived, and the sun shone again. Apple Bread Pudding. Such simple, innocent words for the most incredible sugar trip, ever. The pudding itself was a masterpiece of apple with pineapple, light and fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside. The Green Tea crumble provided just that right amount of bitterness to counter the pudding while the creme fraiche was sufficiently laced with brandy to make me feel happy :) the finishing touches of Mango Sorbet as well as a platter of fresh fruits completed the experience.  In all, I paid under $90 for all four items plus sparkling water and several glasses of Coke.  Price-wise, I'm not quibbling.  Quality-wise, I really did expect much better, I expected to be doubled up with culinary bliss after each course but that wasn't the case. That said, I'll be going back tomorrow to try a fish or lobster dish, let's see how that works out :) sidenote: everything is a tad on the salty side here.  Be forewarned.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The service was proably one of my best service ever. They wait hand over backward for you. The menu look outrages and I wanted to try everything but I decided on the 8 course tastering menu for $120. It made more sense because everything on the menu look pretty expensive and figure order all over the menu will just add up the same way. Our cockails drink was pretty good. The first course was tina tartar and it was pretty amazing and I asked our waiter that I saw him making it on one of the Iron Chef show and the waiter told me yes he 1st made it on the show and afterward he putted on his menu. The 2nd course was fluke sashimi w.roast hot oil and green. The hot oil made this dish come alive. The 3 course is the sear salmon w.micro green. It was so and so, I just like the half raw part. The 4 course was my favorite, raw oyster, uni and foie gras and it was amazingly good., The weird combination just melt in your mouth and I will try making this dish when i get a chance. The 5 course was 6 different types of sashimi, it was good as the nobu stand. The 6 and 7 course come together. It was kobe beef and shiny lobster. For another $60 buck you can add the real kobe beef from japan so I had to do it hehebut on friend plate i just got the American Kobe beef so i can see and taste the different. Mine Kobe Beef was delicious. It was alot better then the american one. The lobster was a little over cook. The final plate was the desert, it was a peach sorbet and some types of a sweet bread and it was pretty good. Our waiter Nick was so great and awesome, he did more then he had to. We wanted to take a picture of the Japanese Kobe beef so he took it out from the kitchen so we pose w.the hugh chuck of kobe beef and he gave me a sign moromoto menu.

2456,IUzTf6bXNQ8jaZk5F_ylZQ,M H.,5.0 star rating,"Morimoto is one of those places that maintains a working balance between tradition Japanese and fusion fare.  For traditionalists, the sashimi is the freshest I've had in a long time- cut to ideal sizes/slices according to the type of fish it is to maximize on taste, and served at the perfect cold temperature. For fusion people, there are things like the tartar, the oysters and fois gras, and many items on their cooked list. The calamari salad is heavenly as well.  Unfortunately, almost every time I go there, I end up leaving no room for dessert. There is the price tag. What one pays for is a happy, memorable dining experience with no glitches in service, great presentation, excellent food, and unhurried eating (dine later, after 9 for a true feel of the place).  The decor is trendy and modern, but not in an intimidating or cold way.  However, the acoustics are not great here; on a busy night, you may have to speak louder to carry a conversation over the noise of others.

This was one of the best decisions I made concerning dining in the city. The service was impeccable. Our beverages were never empty, and every dish was fully described by whoever was serving it. The manager was even topping off my beer! It became a game to see if he could keep up. The food was some of the freshest tasting I have ever had. The Toro Tartar is outstanding. I wish I could have that for lunch every day, forever. There were four different price options for the sashimi platters, and I figured that they would be a little skimpy, considering the caliber of the place, and my usual sashimi experiences elsewhere, so I opted for the $75 platter. The 'plate', which was actually a huge bowl filled with ice, came out, and I was blown away! There were at least 10-12 different varieties of fish/seafood(including my request for some of the special cuts of the night), totaling 30-36 pieces of fish! I have been to hundreds of sushi joints, and never gotten more value for my money. The bowl was presented beautifully. We sat at the bar, so we could see it being made. There was this white kid putting our plate together, and I could see that he took great pride in what he was doing. I have only seen that dedication to presentation once before. I was more than impressed by his knife skills. Over the course of the evening, I realized that he was the only one making sashimi orders, even though there were many older chefs working there. If other kitchen staff weren't busy, they would watch this guy work. It was a treat to watch him do his thing.So for our entrees, my girl and I shared a surf and turf combo of Wagyu Beef and Yellowtail strips mixed in an avacado, cilantro, lime, tomato mix. Her cousin had the marinated Wagyu Filet. I found the fish to be very bright and refreshing. The beef from our meal I found a tad overdone and slightly tough. I had a taste of the filet, and it was perfect. It had a subtle teriyaki flavor, was ultra tender, and melted in my mouth.The decor here is cool, all the way down to the bathrooms. They are downstairs, so not good if you are handicapped. Not sure if they have an elevator. Probably my only negative, was the bartender downstairs gave me a bit of the 'I'm way too cool to talk to you', when I asked for directions to the bathroom. Other than that, the manager sported me a beer(which is ridiculously overpriced-not surprising considering it comes from Rogue Brewing), and all of the servers and chefs were great.

2471,fq8bQY8N74DUzawTKAZL5Q,Kevin C.,3.0 star rating,"Morimoto. Mr. Iron Chef Japan. Expectations, expectations, expectations. Sometimes, I'm not sure whether to expect the worst then get the best out of it or expect what should be expected and hope to get blown away by the great experience. Morimoto NYC was one of the restaurants I've longed for while I was planning my trip to New York from L.A, (one above Caracas). Sushi, ramen, udon, takoyaki, chawan mushi, okonomiyaki, ryokan washoku, I've had it all. Ok maybe not all, but with these experiences under my belt, I still don't know any better. After I've arrived in front of the restaurant, I was absolutely thrilled.  I couldn't wait any longer to get in, to dine and to experience what Iron Chef Japan was all about. My date and I were dressed in business casual attire for this occasion this Sunday evening. With $$$$ on yelp and a Morimoto label on it, we anticipated this restaurant to provide a high end dining experience.The restaurant itself was modern and well decorated. It certainly didn't feel like a traditional Japanese restaurant. There are two floors, top floor for dining and bottom floor, a bar. The waiters were all dressed in black. The overall environment felt like a scene. It wasn't as classy or as high end as we've anticipated. Some people were in shorts and t-shirts, some were well dressed.  It was a mixed crowd. At this point, I was somewhat skeptical. I asked myself whether this restaurant is all about the food, or all about the experience. In the end, we are in America, as opposed to Japan.We ordered Maine lobster, Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, duck duck duck and a few from sushi bar.From the sushi bar, we ordered raw octopus, uni, ika and another piece I can't quite remember at the moment. Uni was for myself, the rest were for my date. ""No wasabi for her, please.""The first dish that arrived was the Wagyu beef. It looked magnificent. It was generously garnished. Dressed with soy sauce, chives, clinatro and a few more herbs. The beef quality was heaven. It was tender. It was slightly cooked with hot oil. It was fantastic, fresh, clean, but it was also over flavored. With good beef, simple is best.  Keep in mind that wagyu is somewhat of a delicacy. Whether, the wagyu is lean or well marbled, you want to experience it at its best (Don't get me started with Wagyu marbled beef burger, that's a shame for some restaurants to carry). It was not to die for.Then came our lobster. It was a disappointment. From Raw Bar, I expected to be raw. Lobster sashimi. A total delicacy. But not this time, it was a well steamed whole lobster, served on an artsy bowl filled with ice to keep it plumped. It was also funny when the lobster arrived. I can clearly remember what Tony (Anthony Bourdain) said in his book, Kitchen Confidential) about seafood on a Sunday. But I fear not, after all, we are dining in Morimoto. Japanese cuisine on a pedestal. In NYC. The lobster itself was al dente. Still somewhat plump. It was easy and convenient to eat, pre-cracked. It was ergonomic in many ways. The meat can be retrieved out of the shell easily. The meat was not overcooked. It felt just right. The lobster came with a number of sauces. Minced garlic with chives, cocktail tomato sauce, ponzu and another one that wasn't worthy to remember. The body, the claw, the tail and the brain were nicely done. It was great, but again, it wasn't to die for. But I'd have it again, maybe.Then came the duck duck duck and the nigiri sushi. We were told that the sushi came in two per order, but that was not the case. One piece per order it is. We also ordered our nigiri wasabi free, but it was embedded with wasabi. I had the over price uni and it was not the best I've ever had. $8 for that one piece. It was somewhat fresh, it was not to die for. Again, it was overprice for that quality. We complained to the waiter and he offered a redo of the order but we declined after seeing what was served. Additionally, the restaurant comped us a dessert with the mistake it had done with the order of our nigiris.Then there was the duck duck duck. It was fatty, it was nicely done, it was delicious. The duck egg was rich, big and beautiful. The croissant was crispy and buttery, though I didn't taste too much of foie gras in it. The duck was succulent, tender and its skin was crispy. It was served with plum sauce. It was a decent dish, it was not bad at all. Though, I wouldn't go to morimoto just to have that dish because I know for a fact that the Chinese can serve the duck much better.The washroom earned the restaurant an extra star. I've never experience the traditional Japanese butt washing, auto-lid, ass warming toilet in the U.S. The toilet was clean,  beautiful and hi-tech.

I do however must highlight the Tuna Pizza, it was tasty and different from what you would find on a Japanese restaurant menu. The sushi rolls were average and the Toro Tartare lacked flavor and it took us a while to figure out how it was supposed to be eaten. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of trying new things but this is just a hyped up dish with a nice colorful presentation.

2484,nkPTW6uXEJPvAnWRA08Jyg,Heather S.,3.0 star rating,"I ate at Morimoto's this past Saturday night for the second time in the last 2 years. The first time I had gone was for NYC Restaurant Week in the summer of '07. That time I went with my gut reaction and stuck to the sushi which was splendid. Worth every penny? No, but still first class.On Saturday I was there to celebrate my best friends 24th birthday with her sister and a girlfriend of ours. We arrived a little early for our 6:45 reservation and our coats were check and we were seated immediately by the friendly hosts. My first complaint about this place began here though. They stuck us in this little section and put us in the corner. Maneuvering in and out of our seats were quite the challenge. This annoyed me.Our seemingly new waiter brought us our menus, bragged to us about some overpriced cocktail, and then disappeared. When he returned we had decided on a bottle of white wine and several appetizers. We ordered the Tuna Pizza, the Rock Shrimp Tempura, and the Ramen Soup. All were excellent. The second thing that annoyed me occurred when our waited reappeared with our bottle of pinot grigio. He carded us. I'm not talking about he had to because his manager was standing over his back.  This was the VERY first time I have ever been carded at a 4+ star establishment in my 23 years of existence. Normally I wouldn't be annoyed but this really kind of pissed me off. Reaffirmed that I was eating in a chain restaurant. It probably wouldn't have bothered me so much if he cared to card us when we ordered, but he did not. Oh well... I'm over it... sort of. Ha.For some reason it wasn't until after we finished our appetizers that our waiter decided to take our dinner order. We wound up eating our appetizers on an overcrowded table filled with menus. (Obviously this was annoyance #3.)I went with the Surf and Turf. Wagyu beef (rare) and hamachi ribbons prepared at your table. I expected ALOT from this choice. Truthfully though, it was merely good. I didn't think the wagyu beef filet was anything to write home about...and if I know anything, its steak. The hamachi ribbons were nothing like what I had been expecting. The put pieces of hamachi (yellowtail sashimi) atop a bed of guacamole. The prepared at your table was the most pointless thing I have ever experienced. Not only was it extremely awkward because I was sitting in crammed corner, but I still don't understand the need for anyone to squeeze a little syringe filled with a citrus soy mixture on my fish and then mix the guac and fish together. Did I like the dish? Yes. Will I ever spend $40 to have it again...? NO. Will I steal Mr. Morimotos recipe and replicate it in my kitchen on a special occasion in the futue? YES. For dessert I split the special they had... But only because the description included pop rocks. That's right...pop rocks. I was super excited about this dessert and I never eat dessert. Total disappointment. :-(.Overall I give my 2nd experience at Morimoto's a 3 out of 5. My first experience was definitely a 4 of 5.The service was mediocre, where we sat was absurd. In all truth my favorite part of the evening was the awesome toilets that clean your butt (and the front!). Ha, ha.

When last we met, she and I had gone to the Rainbow Room for dinner and dancing...an absolutely marvelous evening that might never be repeated, as the NY landmark has closed its doors indefinitely. (a tragedy that should never have been allowed!) Needless to say I had a lot to live up to in planning this reunion and I wanted to celebrate with style, so I made reservations at the super stylish, super yummy sushi house called Morimoto.Downtown, under the old High Line on 10th Avenue, we arrived by towncar just in time for our 10pm reservations...pausing for a moment to reapply and confirm purrfection. Tracy and I finished up and our darling driver Kenny helped us out and sent us on our way through the largest traditional Japanese Noren curtain ever created. As luck would have it, Mr. Masaharu Morimoto was there to greet us. He was friendly, humble and welcomed us in with sincerity. It's refreshing to know that the Iron Chef hasn't let ""celebrity"" go to his head.The young hostess told us our table would be ready in 10 minutes and escorted us downstairs to the sexy-cool lounge area. It was packed with New Yorkers and tourists alike... and while maneuvering my way through the attractive crowd, I noticed that everyone was drinking the same martini. I asked the sassy bartender what the cloudy concoction was and she informed me of the famous White Lily...mmmm two please! You can't come to Morimoto's without ordering one of these...Gal's orders. ;)After about 20 minutes and two White Lily's later, we began to get concerned that they had forgotten us...seems impossible, I know...but all the same, Tracy and I decided to check with the manager. A tall, handsome Asian man told us it would be just a few more minutes and apologized for the wait. Time for a quick trip to the ladies room! The design of the bathroom was stunning...however on this particular Saturday night, the cleaning crew had not been doing their job. The stalls were dirty and the floor was so wet that I actually feared for my Louboutin's safety and placed some very expensive linen napkins on the floor. (a full-time bathroom attendant would cure this problem, but I have to say...I've never seen it like this before) Just as I was about to shut the stall door, a group of girls came rushing into the room, one of them was crying. A tall, young blonde was trying to speak through angry tears, ""He broke up with me on a text message!""Oh Nurse...I just couldn't help myself so I did what any good woman would do. I came out of the stall and explained to the young lady that this is cause for celebration, not tears! He did her a favor and she should never take his calls again...because the little bastard will call, they always do. After a short pep talk, we all had a good laugh and the troupe of girls emerged from the ladies room feeling empowered and ready to take on Manhattan!Tracy and I sat down at the community style table and a plate with Blue Fin Tuna Pizza came within minutes...a gift to make up for the wait. A little bit of yummy, and all is forgiven! We also ordered the artful Toro Tartare, a few pieces of melt in your mouth Toro Sushi, sweet and mellow Tamago, the Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura and of course, KEN ""The Sword"" Sake. (my favorite!) If that's not getting you HOT then listen to this! Across the room... a bachelorette party was in full swing...no cheesy crowns or flashing ""bride"" buttons...nothing tacky like that! No, they wanted nothing but class..and whats classier than twelve grown women laughing wildly and posing for photographs with a ""Burt Reynolds"" Blowup doll...Oh yeah! Burt Reynolds in the flesh.....or in the plastic... is there really a difference? I kid... our table loved it! In fact we bonded over the experience.

All of these design aspects invoke an overall calming, almost zen like feeling; embrace you as you walk in the door. take a deep breathe and let it all out.... yeah just like that.... And that's just in the first few minutes. If a restaurant can invoke such a feeling just by the design, you can only imagine how the food is gonna make you feel. So i made 530 reservation on opentable.com. We got there are quarter past 5 and this place was dead. We went downstairs to the bar area. We took a look at a drink list and ended up with some crazy exotic cocktails. I can't even begin to describe what was in these libations but shoooooot. they were very good. White Lilly and maybe a snapdragon were they're names. The hostess comes and grabs us, and shows us to our table. yeah we really didn't need to see a menu, we were obviously getting the Chef's tasting menu. I think there was a total of 6 courses, Both of us eat just about anything that lives in the ocean, so we were down for putting our Culinary future in the hands of the sushi gods (big smile). The first course that came out was tar tar of TORO. Benny likathe TORO and yes TORO completely deserves to be written in CAPS cause it freggin rocks. This dish was obviously awesome. It was sprinkled with some caviar, and then had some soy, for dipping as well as 6 condiments for the mixing, they were some wasabi, sour cream, avocado puree, soy paste, and a few others that escape me at the moment. The next course was a carpaccio of Tile fish. This was my first experience with Tile fish and it will be hard to beat. Lightly dressed with soy and ginger, this dish left me with no desires. I was completely satisfied. After the Tile fish we were served an oyster course. At the bottom of the bowl was teriyaki reduction, then a cooked oyster which was topped with sea urchin and on top of that was some foie gras. The sauce was soo rich but didn't overpower the natural flavors of the oyster, sea urchin and most importantly the foie gras. Next up was a selection of nigiri. There was a semi fatty tuna, barracuda, golden eye snapper, shrimp, and a few others. The golden eye was amazing.... Like downright amazing. In the famous words of Linda Richmond, it was like butta. Then there was an intermezzo. It was a shooter filled honey dew puree topped with some coconut milk and sage foam. we were instructed to sip not shoot this. Yeah, it was definitely meant to be savored. After the intermezzo, then came the main entree. It was surf in turf. HMMM... it was a small Maine lobster cut in half and heavily seasoned with some Indian spice, real nice flavor. So you didn't get a ton of lobster meat. Opposite of the lobsta was a piece of wagyu beef. This was atop some Japanese potatoes in a puddle of au jus. SOOO freggin good. Now i know why wagyu beef is soo spendy. To conclude our chefs tasting, was some chestnut flavored ice cream and a pumpkin souffle. It was ehh, not my favorite desert. One other noteworthy aspect of Morimoto was the bathroom stalls. It was kind of like stepping into Alice and wonderland for one hot minute. Damn Alice, those mushrooms were strong! Sure they have urinals and I only had to pee, but i went into the stall cause it was soo effing cool. It was like staring into space and time... trippy. All in all this was an amazing meal.  Unless you're an ultra baller, this is strictly a special occassion kind of place.  Great atmosphere and delicious food and trippy bathrooms, what more could you ask for?",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I had been to the one in Philly too prior to this visit and still the verdict's so-so.Spouse and I brought my cousin from out of state here for a nice pre-wedding celebratory dinner. Hostess was nice, but as expected, stiff and perfunctory in her mannerisms, probably because we looked young and penniless.We were seated quickly (had reservations) and waiter was prompt and friendly. We had the Yosedofu which was nice and creamy (as before in Philly) and although simple, it was nicely complemented by the shoyu-ginger-wasabi sauce on the side. I think I had some grilled or baked salmon entree that's no longer on the menu (this visit was back in '09) which was rather dry and clearly forgettable (seeing as how I don't remember the name of the dish). Spouse had the Black Miso Cod which was cooked to perfection, soft and flaky (I'm reporting here). However, by the nth mouthful, the salt began to kick in and I was told that it was decreasing marginal utility towards the end.Cousin had the Chilean Sea Bass I think ( I could be wrong- it was a thick fish fillet that came in a bowl, rather than a plate) and again, it was cooked to flaky, sweet perfection. Her's was a tad salty too, but nevertheless, distinct enough to remember.Overall, I think the entrees had good and different flavors (except mine) but I wouldn't go so far as to say that the flavors were unique or out of this world.We asked for the yummy Cherry Blossom ice cream that spouse and I had in Philly, but it wasn't available that season. We had their dessert du jour which was some apple martini ice cream thing that the spouse, cousin (and I?) found very yummy.Maybe I've just got cheapo taste but overall I don't really remember all the flavors (except my cousin's fish dish which was pretty good). I would recommend having fish there though (not the baked or grilled kind) because they really know how to cook their fish without over or under- doing it.The bill was close to $200 for 3 people and I think we ate 3 entrees, 1 app and 1 dessert, but it's Morimoto, so that's par for the course.Would only probably go there for a special occasion or to bring someone from out of town there for the experience, but I wouldn't go there because of the food (a bit paradoxical I know... but hey, I am the queen of cheap....)Plus: attentive waitstaff.

The tasting menu clearly is a great experience. 7, courses ranging in size from one bite (an oyster) to several (a few pieces of sashimi) to surf and turf. Nearly all of the courses were good, some outstanding, but for some reason a couple just seemed lacking. I'll pick on the Oyster- It was simply an Oyster- which I understand is a delicacy to some, but I hard a hard time getting excite about, where was the creativity that was so very present in the Tuna tartare dish (best presentation of the night for sure) or the Surf and Turf?The service was spot an on and attentive. Also, there's a bar downstairs, and if you haven't seen it- its absolutely insane. Impeccably dressed women and business men types talking loudly and blocking access to the restrooms (and of course ignoring you as you say excuse me, but being indignant if you try to push through) Yeah, it was a scene, but that seems to be a weekend thing.

The food was good, Morimoto himself was in the house (at the sushi bar wearing khaki shorts and sneakers) and the service was impeccable.My friends and I went with the omakase chef's tasting menu. If you don't like seafood, then you shouldn't eat here period. The first course was mashed toro in a striking presentation: a 4x2"" bamboo box with about 1/2"" of depth; 2/3 of the box was the toro while the last 1/3 was filled with ""stripes"" of different toppings: fresh wasabe, creme fraiche, an intense nori paste, chives, avocado, and tiny rice ball crackers.Morimoto seems to favor sweetness in his dishes as reflected in the sauces served with his kobe beef with sweet potato dish and his salmon with terriyaki. Seafood courses included a lobster halved, cooked with garam masala (a bit odd) and served with a light lemon creme fraiche on the side, and a selection of nigiri. I enjoyed his raw octopus/scallop/clam salad as the octopus was the perfect consistency and the dressing was light with delicate flavors (shoyu and some kind of vinegar and oil among others). The last was a large cooked oyster with a bit of cooked uni and seared foie gras. All the ingredients were quite fresh, but the final dessert course left something to be desired: a redbean cake with peach sorbet topped with a lavender sugar garnish and apricots and asuki beans on the side. I love Asian desserts as a whole, but this one was unremarkable.The venue itself is very modernly trendy: some striking whitewashed wood boards along the seating areas, glass-like flooring and stairways, dim lighting except for the sushi bar. Reservations don't really seem to be necessary on weeknights as the restaurant wasn't at capacity the entire time we were there.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Everyone recommended the omakase as the first dining experience at Morimoto but decided to order individual dishes since the whole table didn't want omakase. The toro tartare and the oyster foie gras were excellent choices. Very rich and tasty. The favors were immediately noticed after each bite. The clam miso soup was a bit on the salty side and not similar to the traditional miso base as you would find in Japanese sushi bars/restaurants. Chef's sushi combo at $40 was enough for 2 people, which included nigiri tuna, salmon, hamachi, eel, shrimp, and included spicy tuna roll. The spicy king crab legs was a bit rich on the spice sauce but the crab meat portion was generous. The wagyu beef carpaccio was disappointing. It wasn't spectacular and anticipated too much hype especially for such a delicate item such as wagyu beef. I guess I was expecting too much on the traditional side.

I had the White Lily, which is not the sort of thing I would normally get (I am a bourbon/rocks kind of girl---bless my soul and my liver) but it was so light and refreshing. He got the Morimotini- against my advice. Not the drink for either of us, it was a wasabi-infused martini. I don't know what he expected though.We started with a spicy tuna roll, just because we wanted to see the difference. It was of course the best ever. The tuna was of an incredible quality. Next we had the Lobster Beignets (not sure what they were called, but that's what they were). They were good, but the sauce underneath definitely carried them.I had the Duck, Duck, Duck, which was perfectly cooked. The thigh had a perfect five-spice powder coating, and the breast was succulent. The accompanying sauces (a hoisin-type and a saltier miso-based) were unnecessary, as was the fried duck egg. The bf had the Black Cod, which was perfectly cooked, but had a slightly overpowering smokiness. Not sure if it came from the tomato confit or the tempura, or the cooking method. The broth it was served in was irresistible. He had wine, and I had the sake flight, which was perfect and prevented me from developing a case of my date's tipsiness, which led to an impromptu chorus of Happy Birthday when the waiter brought out our Caramel Creme, with a candle and an artful message on the edge of the plate. The dessert was creamy and light, although it was marred by slabs of chocolate that just didn't belong. All in all, it was an elegant and romantic meal.

The fish was extremely fresh and meaty. The rice was seasoned just right and the sweet egg cut the saltiness of the dish perfectly.  I can't get over how fresh the fish was! It was one of the best meals I've ever had and the best part was I couldn't finish it! It was equivalent to more than 20 sushi pieces at least. For a restaurant of this caliber, you'd expect that they would give you portions that aren't exactly the most filling, but this was seriously a lot of food. I can't say the same about the $120 Omakase Dinner which my friend had. It was just okay.  The dishes that were presented weren't mind blowing in anyway. The only exception was the toro tartare which was amazing though may be a bit fishy for some people.  I recommend getting the full version of that. Maybe the Omakase is better in the summer?

However, since I love him so much I decided to spoil him and take him to the infamous Iron Chef Morimoto's restaurant. Luckily I had landed a 6:45 reservation the night before. I made sure to indicate that it was my fiance's birthday so I expected to get better seats and birthday decoration on the desserts. After hearing and seeing great reviews from my friends and fellow yelpers, the expectation for Morimoto was very high. The food was definitely good but I cannot say that about the service and accomadations for special occasions.Highlights:Spicy king Crab (this was absolutely delicious and the portion was rather large too)Foie Gras Mushi ( Duck breast) (Very rich)This was just okay:Smoked Salmon RavioliToro Tartar ( This was a very popular item. I noticed alot of people ordered this. Lobster Entree ( The presentation was too ordinary and it tasted okay not great)Did not like:Soft Shell Crab roll ( Too oily and big. Had to cut it in half to put in my mouth)California Roll ( Could not taste the crab meat at all)Hmmm.... My overall review of Morimoto is 3.5 Stars but since there isn't that option I would say it is closer to 4. I give the food 4 stars and the service and atmosphere a 3. Apparently, Morimoto is recession proof because the place was packed! I was upset that they did not prepare the dessert for my fiance's birthday with the birthday decorations when I specifically asked them to on the reservation and I had called them the day of the reservation. I was disappointed when they brought out the ""naked"" dessert we had ordered. I called the waitress over as I was walking to the restroom to tell her about it. She said not to worry that they would send over something of which they did but later BILLED me for it. I thought that was a little shady. Another negative aspect was that if I didn't check the bill I wouldn't have noticed they almost accidentally charged us for a half bottle of Riesling that they did not have.I would advise people that haven't been here before to just expect good food but not good service at this restaurant.

So unbelievably good.... So good.  Enough for two people appetizer or for one meal.  I got the, dare I say it, ramen noodle soup for an appetizer.  Yes, I went Morimotos and got ramen noodle soup:). The chicken, noodles, and broth were perfection.  I loved it and it was again, enough for two.  As a matter of fact they bring a large bowl of soup and two small bowls to share.  For dinner I got the yellowtail buri bop which is cooked at the table in a stone bowl.  It was so, so, so delicious.  My husband ate it also and he loved it.  I got a cocktail, Hydrangea, and it was sweet and tasty.  The only complaint was the lobster fritters, not a complaint really, just wasn't too impressed, not very flavorful.  The meal was around $170 not including tip (my husband got 4 sushi and six rolls I believe, the yellowtail buri bop, calamari salad, ramen soup, cocktail, lobster fritters).  I didn't try it but the rock shrimp looked amazing. I would come to NY just for Morimotos.

2538,160JZ0ROgfyX3qFXjYC_Pw,Patrick D.,2.0 star rating,We drove to NYC specifically to go to the restaurant and I was highly disappointed. I could not believe one of my favorite Iron Chef's owns the restaurant. To start our server was very snobby. She was a better salesperson then a server. I got the sampler feast that they have for $120 and it was by far the worst thing I could have done. I gave the restaurant two stars because at least the TORO TARTAR is out of this world. Other than the Toro the other dishes were practically not edible. Everything was so bland and lacked any personality. They had a very under dressed fennel salad. Some sushi rolls came out and they were tiny and practically all rice. I thought Morimoto was the king of sushi. I bet he would have never served sushi like that to anyone yet his chefs are. The main coarse was their version of a surf and turf. I asked for the steak to be cooked medium rare and I was told it came with a half 2 pound lobster . When the main dish arrived the steak was as thin as a slice of roast beef and it was so small when they seared it on both sides it came out well done. The lobster was definately not half of even a one pound lobster to start out with. The only thing left was the tail and they blackened the lobster. The tail was like eating rubber. I am from New England originally and it was by far the worst lobster I have ever ate. The Server never asked me how anything was and runners kept bringing out the food. As soon as the last plate came out someone brought out are check not asking if we wanted anything else.  The server basically thought we were insane for not enjoying the meal and pretty much thought we didn't know anything about food. After spending $120 on my meal alone I went to the closest pizza stand and bought a dollar slice of pizza and was far happier. I could have saved $119. I keep on telling myself maybe I just went there on an off night but it will be hard for me to go back when there are so many better restaurants in NYC,Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

My mom had the prix fixe lunch: green salad (really good citrus dressing), sea bass (YUM!), and coconut panna cotta. I had a spicy salmon roll, spicy tuna roll, miso soup, and summer pudding.

Delicious, fried just enough and not dry by any means.  Nothing to complain about there.  For the entree, I ordered the cod ""fishwich"" and my friend had the beef gyu-don.  I'll start with the gyu-don. The portion was HUGE and it smelled great, but its nothing special. It doesn't have anything that sets itself apart from some of the other beef donburis I've had. Still, it was good and you couldn't go wrong with the large portion.  My cod fishwich was just a fish sandwich served with tartar sauce on the side.  The fishwich was tiny in comparison to the donburi.  It would've have been better if it was a slightly larger portion.  The sandwich itself was again, nothing special.  Without the tartar sauce, it lacked flavor.  The tartar sauce however was a bit too creamy, but it did save the fishwich and made it a bit more flavorful.  The panna cotta dessert was great.  I usually find white chocolate to be too sweet for me, but the white chocolate here was surprisingly balanced.  I enjoyed the panna cotta very much and it along with the crab croquettes were the highlight of the meal.The service was also a bit lackluster.  Granted we went at around 1pm so it was a busy lunch hour, but even so, the server wasn't around as often as I would have expected from a higher end restaurant such as Morimoto.On a high note, the bathroom is quite nice. Definitely something to check out while dining here.  Overall, I feel Morimoto is over-hyped.  Would I come back for a dinner experience?

After dinner, my friend informed me that Opentable reservations don't get the best seats so next time I'll call instead because we were put in a side area of the restaurant that was not as aesthetically pleasing as the rest of it. In fact when we came in we went downstairs to the bar to wait for our friend and I could have stayed there over the table we were given. Much cooler at the bar. Very romantic sexy vibe down there and you can order items off the menu. Not the full menu but rolls and other delicious foodstuffs. Our server was well informed and helpful with the menu, but the runners brought the wrong thing to our table twice. Not sure if it was a first day on the job kind of thing or if there is normally a lot of confusion as to which table ordered what, but we had a great time and will definitely be going back!

I felt like I was paying for the decor similar to when you go to Rainforest Cafe or Planet Hollywood (back in the day).  What prompted me to go here was that it was adjacent to my work and I thought I'd give it a try. I had the Ishi Yaki Buri Bop. Never have I been so disgusted by the melody of the flavors. I learned to hate yellowtail that day and the menu was very deceiving. This entree came with garnished seaweed (or at least what was supposed to be a garnish) and was pumped with MSG. Bad, bad, bad. The Morimoto Sashimi appetizer wasn't as bad since it required no cooking, but I would highly suggest not going here unless you're a naive tourist willing to spend 50+ for an entree not worth your time.

The room is draped in what looks like white cloth though it is fiberglass or something like it. The colors are neutral and the design is spare, setting the scene for great and beautifully presented food.  Our server,  Ronald was excellent and after he suggested the Omikase , which is not inexpensive, we decided to try it.  It was very worthwhile if you are willing to try almost anything.  The meal began with a toro in a paste eaten with a small spackel. Trust me, it is better than it sounds! Next was fluke in a sauce with pea shoots and a bit of micro greens. They had to take my plate before I licked it.  There was a dipping sauce of garlicky anchovies and diakon and other veggies to dip. An oyster foie gras and Uni dish followed and then a dish of five excellent pieces of sushi.last was their version of surf and turf, a small lobster claw and tail with butter and spices and waygu beef over Japanese yams,  this was a very rich dish.  Dessert was not up to par and not worth mentioning but all the other flavors and tastes were wonderful.Open your wallet and your mouth wide and enjoy.  This time it was worth it!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

By far, the Chefs Choice of 7 courses exceeds any tasting menu experience I have EVER encountered. It's not only the taste, but the detail in presentation that makes the whole dining experience a work of art. Truly our meal couldn't get any better, but seeing Chef Morimoto at a table across the way and the husband saying:  ""That's not him, that guy has been sitting at a regular table for awhile. Why would he be sitting at a table eating? My son's hilarious response "" He could sit where ever he wants, he own the place!!!!""

2589,Jgxf9AF6ky8aHDAEh79fJQ,Lisa D.,5.0 star rating,The first time I went to Morimoto was for my birthday (June) a few years ago. I had the Omakase tasting menu and fell in love. The second time (July) the I went I had a different tasting menu and was still amazed. The next time (August) I went back to having the original tasting menu. So after pay WAY too much for 3 months in a row (BUT SO WORTH IT!) we decided to wait a bit before going again. The next time we went (maybe a year later) we went for lunch after a day of shopping in Chelsea Market. Instead of the tasting menu I tried the tuna pizza which is a paper thin crust covered in thinly sliced tuna covered with fresh jalepeno slices on each slice with micro greens and a drizzle of wasabi aioli. TO DIE FOR and ultimately one of my favorite appetizers there. For lunch I tried one of the rice bowls and enjoyed it very much. I think we also did some sushi at that point and were not disappointed. We have since gone there many other times and ordered a la carte for dinner. My husband is in love with their tuna tartare and won't share it! I am in love with the tuna pizza and will always order it. We recently tried the rock shrip tempura and were amazed by the wonderful flavors it had. Finally my favorite entree is the lobster. I eat every last bit of it and suck each of the legs. The spice they put on it is just the right heat and the lemon creme fresh that comes with it cools you down. My husband loves getting their steak. He enjoys the waygu very much. Every time we go there the desserts are different. The one that I had most recently was a chocolate pudding with praline and other crispy things. It was delicious.I LOVE going to Morimoto and will continue to go there for special occasions and any other time for that matter!,Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
2590,oYyqBOUA7XufHBrjh8gDWQ,George C.,5.0 star rating,"I think it's worth breaking down just how much i love Chef Morimoto. I'm quick to admit how formative he was in my evolution of eating, understanding, and embracing of Japanese cuisine via Iron Chef. Okay fine, I'm kind of obsessed.I've been to both the Philly restaurant (review TBA) and more recently, the jaw-dropping NYC one as well. I went on a Monday night with the gf, and while I didn't have a problem getting a reservation only a day prior, that shit was still pretty packed for a Monday night. The decor is absolutely top notch, with tables on multiple levels of floor, and with a stunning downstairs bar that's refined and modern. The waitress we had was super knowledgeable about the various dishes as well as certain kinds of (adventurous) fish---I knew we were about to drop a few hundred dollars, so she was definitely at the level I expected.When I went to the Philly Morimoto, everyone told me it was all about the Omakase (chef's choice, pre set here) and I'm not necessarily disagreeing with that... but at the NYC Morimoto, we opted to not be limited by that and order a bunch of stuff from the menu. And let me tell you... BEST DECISION EVER.  On the real--the more adventurous you are with what you order here, the bigger the payoff.My highlights:-- Toro Tartare - Kind of obvious, right?  Well sure until you see the INSANITY of the presentation on this. A beautiful box filled with elegantly shaved ice shows up, and on top of that is a smaller box filled with luscious, delicate toro in tartare. The coolest part though was that it came with an assortment of compliments---caviar, creme friache, fresh wasabi, seaweed paste, some weird kind of soy sauce, etc, all taking your bite down a different path. Genius.-- Lamb Carpaccio -  I mean honestly, if I'm ever going to eat raw lamb, or any kind of red meat that's RAW, it's only going to be from a recipe coming from the mind of Morimoto. And boy am I glad that I did. My girlfriend described the flavor of this as ""sour cream & onion chips"" and while that's not entirely inaccurate, the flavor isn't over-powering and you can still get accustomed to the natural flavor of the lamb itself.  I'm personally not a big ""lamb guy"" but, would always make an exception for this. The texture was out of control---super elegant and highly recommended. -- Kakuni - aka some cut of pork that tastes like butter, sitting in a pool of thick rice porridge (called ""congee"") and peppered with a scallion soy sauce. This was the dish that made me, quite literally, drool on the menu when I saw it, and our waitress proceeded to tell us it was her favorite item on the menu. The pork itself already explodes with flavor, but the brilliant part of this dish is the more you break up the mean, the more it absorbs the flavor of the porridge in each successive bite. Conversely, the porridge itself picks up little pieces of pork as well as the natural juices from the meat... making it enjoyable on its own too. Goddamn.-- Yellowtail Pastrami - The kind of dish I remember Morimoto making on Iron Chef and always fantasizing being about to one day try. 100% unique, and 100% exploding with flavor. There's not really ""pastrami"" here, but the dish does have pastrami that is cured with an amazing japanese 7 spice called togarashi, and it gives the yellowtail a salty, dried flavor that, while still a sashimi based dish, gives it an aura of real pastrami. Bravo!-- Tofu Dessert aka Tofu ""Hot & Cold - I was beyond stuffed at this point, but I still wanted to order every dessert on the menu though. I went with the one I had read the most about, and it was a perfect end to an incredible journey of a meal. A trio that includes a Soy Milk Souffle, Maple Ice Cream, and Tofu Cheesecake. The cheesecake was somehow both rich and light, and coupled with the other two, the total experience was transcendent. Couple other things to note. Drinking isn't cheap here---if you're used to ordering a ""house sake"" or a couple beers, get ready to buck up and drop some more $$. If you want sake, you have to get a big bottle... i think the Nigori sake we got was $60, and that was one of the cheaper ones. Was delicious though. Also, the beer prices are generally for regular sized bottles of beer, not larger ones, which was another surprise. Although really, all this is relatively a moot point---you shouldn't be going to this restaurant on a budget if you want to have the best possible experience. It's better to just save up and go at a later point to really take that shit all the way.And one last thing---the bathroom is off the chain. They have a futuristic toilet + bidet combination that you'll want to play with weather you need to drop one or not. The remote has a variety of settings for the bidet too... shit was nuts.Oh, and did I mention the night I went... Morimoto himself was THERE greeting people?!?!?!  Now THAT, is truly a dream come true.

Since its such a HUGE place with 2 floors i just could not understand why they had to have tables almost on top of each other, i felt like i was back at Yuka.The waiter was very nice, knowledeble about the food, and especially the Saki, which was very nice, he gave us a brief education on the different types.I had the Black Cod bento box.  It was quite expensive at $24.  At that price i was expecting it to be amazing.  It was quite good, but not worth the price.  The Cod itself was the smallest piece of fish i have ever been served, really way to small, must have been 2 or 3 ounces.  That said, it was excellent and if i had a bigger portion this review might have been 4 stars.  The miso soup was decent, not what i expected, and was ALL scallions.  The sushi was good thu not memorable, we has a yellowtail roll with mayo (??), and a few peices of tuna, salmon and either fluke or maybe red snapper.  All good, but not worth it, again its a trend.  The tempura itself was excelent, the shrimp was great, squid was intresting (and chewy), eggplant was a nice addition, but on the bottom of the plate was some kinda chease sauce.  Not sure who thought it was smart to dip heavy oily fried food in a thick cheese sauce (Morimoto's i assume!), but i did not like this.  I missed the light vinegar sauce usually served.  The bento box did not come with rice either, which i could have used.  I also ordered a salmon roll which was not very good at all, small and not particularly good fish.  As another reviewer noted, i too left here fealing hungry, and after a $100 lunch, including sake, i should NOT have left hungry.  The other bento box had the kobe beef, excellent dish and a nice size portion, that's certainly my recommendation if you are going there for lunch.  We also waited a long time for our food, and the nosy people next to us who arrived 15 minutes latter had thier food 10 minutes before we did.  Not very organizes.  We also waited a while for the check, nice waiter but may have had to many tables to wait.Overall, disappointing.  Go here if money is not an option, i am sure the $120 Omakase dinner is incredible, just not for me!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The outside had orange fabric hanging, and the name of the restaurant was on the glass in grey, somewhat hard to spot being that it wasn't large either. Inside i was greet and seated near the sushi bar. The decor of the place showed that Mr Iron Chef dropped major $$$ on the place. He seems to like glass and a lot of it. The wall on  stairs down into the bar area was covered in what seemed like glass bottles. There were sectioned off booths with glass if you will.We sat right at the sushi bar in the corner. The staff working there was very friendly offering to take pictures, and chatting it up with customers. Though there was an incident where one chef was screaming at another. It was an open kitchen, and everyone could clearly see into it, however when you're that open, raising your voice to yell or downgrade someone makes the restaurant look somewhat bad. I think it is safe to assume that patrons don't want to see what happens behind the closed doors of a kitchen, and if you have to discipline someone please make note we can all hear you.I ordered the kobe bento box for lunch not on restaurant week. My friend ordered the angry chicken. that came with miso soup, salad and that's about it. I ordered a shooting star sakatini. Very strong, for $12. My bento box came with a seafood soup and clams. it was light and not too salty. The sushi was good, but not as hyped up as i had expected. The salad was fresh and light. The kobe beef was tender but a tad too salty. My friend's soup and salad was very good. He never likes miso soup but he loved it. His entree the angry chicken was very spicy. He wasn't expecting it to be so spicey but he said it was damn good.Splurging we had dessert, a pecan carmel brownie, plated perfectly and lovely, and very tastey, the brownei was still warm, the ice cream melted perfectly into it. We were full and satisifed at the end of the meal, but it was a bit pricey for lunch. I had expected the sushi to be so much more, perhaps it was too hyped up, and maybe I was expecting Morimoto to perpare it. Alas, it is a good restaurant, for the person with that extra buck to spend on sushi.and yes he has the super awesome super cool japanese toilet in the bathrooms downstairs, the ones with the heated seats that vibrate, fan and splash ur butt, in a good way. course they disabled all the buttons so i couldn't play with it all.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

They are professional, attentive, nice and all restaurants should learn from them.I planned a birthday dinner there this past weekend on a busy Saturday evening for a party of 8. We were seated promptly and the location of our table turned out to be excellent. I was worried about being seated downstairs in the lounge area, but the seclusion worked out to our advantage. Our server realized that everyone I was with was underage. He genuinely apologized for not being able to serve drinks to the birthday girl (who only turned 20) and guests so he gave us 4 free appetizers: tuna pizza, mozzarella ball things, something that tasted like sweet and sour shrimp, and lastly something similar to the sweet and sour shrimp but in a different sauce.I ordered the angry chicken and switched half way with my friend for her cod. The rest of my party ordered sushi rolls and maki rolls. I do have to mention that the food was just okay. I mean it was better than okay, but I really expected a lot more from such a notable chef!! All in all, the ambiance was great, the decor is absolutely amazing, the bathrooms are really cool as everyone says it is, the food presentation is really a wow factor and it really wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be. Although we got free appetizers, the average price per person was $40-$45 (but remember we didn't order drinks either).",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Everything from the food, drinks and service down to the insane toilet features was phenomenal !!! My husband and friend had the Omakase for $120 each, a 9 course meal that the chef leaves to his mood and sends out in stages. Worth every penny!! It was divine!! I ordered a bunch of sushi everything from Spicy tuna maki to Tai sushi. It was wonderful, very fresh and decent portions, a little on the pricy side but hey he's Morimoto, when would we be able to do this again?? Our other friend ordered the black cod and the duck, duck , duck. The cod was wonderful. We had a couple of carfe's of sake, a few morimotini's and several white lilies, a fabulous drink that goes down like a refreshing cloudy citrus martini and leaves you giggling hours later.

2613,pKA94qM-DNtXTM-uRHC5zw,Lindsay F.,3.0 star rating,"For her first night in town, the only requirements that Lauren had for dinner on Friday were: Japanese cuisine served in a grand, modern and theatrical space.  Having never been to Morimoto before, I assumed that this restaurant would fit all of her specifications (with the added bonus being that Morimoto is the brainchild of the Iron Chef himself, Masaharu Morimoto).Lauren and I arrived at Morimoto 30 minutes prior to our 8:45pm reservation.  We were told that we could grab a cocktail in the bar downstairs, and a hostess would come find us when our table was ready.  The restaurant/bar is a large, bi-level space with an interior that emphasizes how attractive and serene that the use of concrete, Lucite and creamy whimsical shears can be.As the clock struck 8:45pm, Lauren and I were whisked to our table.  We began our meal with Morimoto's signature drink, the White Lily, made with vodka and a Japanese lemon soda.  Instead of ordering entrees or the omakase, we chose to share an assortment of small plates:* Kobe beef Carpaccio* Spicy king crab broiled on the half shell* Hamachi sashimi (yellowtail)* Pork gyoza* Beef curry breadI rarely order beef over tuna Carpaccio, but Lauren insisted that we must.  The Kobe beef was thinly sliced and arrived in a shallow pool of yuzu soy, hot oil and finely chopped mitsuba leaf.  Every ingredient intertwined perfectly together, creating a symphony of flavor in my mouth.When the spicy king crab arrived, I was surprised by its physically enormous size and Morimoto's generous portion.  I was also pleased to find that the kitchen had, in fact, taken the dirty work out of a potentially disastrous chore: Indeed, the crustacean was served on the half shell, thus making crab meat removal a breeze.  The exposed flesh was painted with a spicy mayonnaise, broiled to perfection, and finished with tiny caviar pearls.        While the hamachi (yellowtail) was fresh and of high quality, I found that it served more as a palate cleanser between more flavorful dishes.When the pork gyoza arrived, I had to ask our server if he had made a mistake and served us the wrong dish.  I was mystified by the paper-thin, golden crust that enveloped the top of the entire serving of dumplings.  Upon ""crust"" removal, I was even more shocked to find that the gyozas were floating atop a bed of marinara sauce.  Honestly, if this combination is considered haute fusion, I'm not a fan.  While the dumplings were OK, I just couldn't get past the pool of bright red spaghetti sauce. I wasn't quite sure what to expect when we ordered the beef curry bread.  Perhaps it was a curried meatball inside of a Chinese bun.  Or maybe curried beef was served atop sliced baguette.  Wrong and wrong.  A plate arrived with 2 golden panko-crusted spheres that were the size of mini Nerf footballs.  ""How in the hell are we supposed to eat this?"" Lauren asked.  We decided to delicately halve each piece and split the dish in to four manageable servings.  The beef curry bread reminded me of an empanada, only with much more filling and a less doughy, crispier exterior.  Upon realization that we had each dropped $100 on our meal, our playful cocktail buzz immediately wore off.  The couple seated next to us had chosen the chef's omakase which, for $120 per person, seemed to be the best deal in the house.  All in all, Lauren and I enjoyed a nice meal, excellent cocktails and an outstanding atmosphere.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

2615,nxHds_GMGN1zWnPBcBOJnQ,Cristofer P.,5.0 star rating,"My last meal in NYC so I wanted it to be memorable and Morimoto's was able to deliver on all my expectations.First of all, I must disclose that I'm a fan of Iron Chef America, and I couldn't wait to eat at the restaurant that bore the chef's name.Like his style of food presentation, the space was simple, elegant, and absolutely beautiful, which is in stark contrast to the unassuming neighborhood. Maybe it was because I'd come here for lunch, but the place was pretty empty.Their lunch menu offers a choice of 3 pre-fixe options for $25: the Morimoto's Sushi Selection, a braised black cod, and the angry chicken. Since this was primarily a sushi restaurant, that's what I got. The meal started off with a house salad (the usual baby greens topped with what looked like some sort of cereal and a little bit too much kabosu vinaigrette) and a bowl of miso soup. Almost immediately after I'd finished my salad, the sushi chef (he looked like he was no older than 25) in front of me presented me with my plate of sushi: 6 pieces of nigiri (i think it was tuna, salmon, silver whiting, red snapper, unagi, and shrimp) and either 6 or 8 pieces of a spicy tuna roll. I also added oh-toro (fatty tuna) which they only give you 1 piece at the market price of $12. All the fish was fresh and melt in your mouth delicious. The unagi (eel) which I've never been that big a fan of, was quite possibly the best I've ever had. And the wasabi was fresh! (I'd expect nothing less). The only gripes I had were with the rice on the nigiri, which kept falling apart, and there was a tiny bit too much wasabi already between the rice and fish, causing the wasabi to get dangerously close to overpowering the taste on some of them.For dessert (which isn't included in the pre-fixe), I decided to buck the familiar for something a little more adventurous and I went with the Tofu Hot & Cold, a selection of tofu cheesecake with maple dipping/pouring syrup, a soy milk souffle, and finally, maple syrup ice cream. The cheesecake was unbelievably soft and fluffy, and I wouldn't have even known it was made of tofu is nobody had told me. The souffle was in contrast warm, and not bad, but a little egg-y. The ice cream was a nice way to end the meal.All in all, I liked this place a lot, and I wish I could check it out during dinner time. Definitely toss it on your list of must-eat at places in NYC.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Definitely check out the bathrooms as they are gorgeous! The bar is a clear plastic with leaves embedded in them that gives a real depth to the the surface. We would have stayed if our vodka-sodas didn't cost $16/glass. All the dishes that were swept by us not only looked great made me salivate even though I had just finished dinner. I'm definitely looking forward to my return for food. I gave it 4-stars because the Iron Chef himself was at the top of the stairs when we were leaving. He thanked us for visiting.

We got and awesome table.  Let me break down the dishes we had. Sorry if names aren't accurate. AppetizersWyagu beef tartare- creamy and tasty. flavors were perfect and not overwhelming. only thing to know about this dish is that it is small and expensive. Spicy king crab-OMG. loved it. not too spicy, meat was tender and cooked perfect. WowRocky shrimp tempura- one plate was spicy and the other was wasabi flavored. both was really tasty. wasabi flavor was perfect and not super strong. Entree:Wyagu filet mignon- perfectly cooked with tasty teriyaki sauce. juicy and tasty. Seafood toban yaki- lobster was tender, mussels was tasty and scallop was awesome Dessertforgot name, think its the Apple turnable. its really small but the slices of apple are cooked perfectly and the ice cream is really good. kinda expensive for the size u get but is still really tasty. The only thing we didn't care for was the side of mushrooms. It was bland and didn't have any spectacular flovoring to it. We had the sake with peach flavoring and it was sweet and smooth. We also had the rupert dry rose champagne. That was really good and sweet. Really expensive. We got the half bottle which was 85 bucks alone. Overall, the service was great, food was delicious and were brought out at the right time, drinks were great and we left satisfied with all of our food.

First of all, Chef Morimoto is actually there, in the kitchen. Imagine that. A celebrity chef who actually spends time in his restaurant. I saw him myself, so it's actually true.Secondly, the sushi is so fresh, it's like they caught it minutes before serving it to you. The mozarella sashimi appetizer sounds weird, but try it -- you won't regre it. It's the oddest combo since Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher, yet totally works. The duck duck duck -- amazing. So succulent. So juicy. I am drooling as I type this. The service is spectacular. I can't eat tuna, due to its high mercury levels, and told my server to leave that off my omakase. He brought me tuna by accident. Instead of merely apologizing, he then brought out an entire platter of their finest sashimi -- on the house -- by way of making nice for his mistake. Mario Batali could learn from Morimoto. His tacky, skanky, nasty Del Posto is right across the street, and has the same price points as Morimoto. But where Batali (or whoever the hell works in his kitchens these days) serves you overcooked, tired pasta and tasteless halibut, Morimoto seems to still take pride in giving his packed house the best fish this side of Sasabune.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

We ordered the spicy crab leg appetizer, chirashi bowl, toro nigiri ,and wagyu beef nigiri. All were delicious except for one piece of the wagyu beef nigiri, which may have been cut wrong? My friend described it as roast beef. That's not what I would want to hear for the price I'm paying for that piece of meat. The crab legs are a MUST!!! I can eat that for an entree. The sashimi cuts are also delicious! I would definitely want to go back and give the hot entrees a try as well! Overall, the food was great! Morimoto's beer was awesome (though steep)!

2648,woBhwBRQJ8JxJcSMCNSitQ,J H.,4.0 star rating,"Omakase all the way. This place was off the proverbial hook. Although it officially weighs in as the most expensive meals my girlfriend an I have ever eaten, it was definitely one of the best and here's why:  The place is beautiful. Clean, modern and spacious for a NYC restaurant. The staff was incredibly helpful and courteous. My girlfriend eats fish, but not land animal meat and they didn't flinch at all when we asked if the omakase menu for the evening could be presented that way for her. Here's the breakdown of what we ate:1) Tuna tartare served with six different toppings including fresh wasabe (awesome)2) Yellowtail sashimi w/ shitake mushroom servered in some sort of sesame oil concoction. Delicious.3) Oyster w/ foie gras - This was the largest oyster I've ever seen. It was also an awesome explosion of flavor. (Her's came without the foie gras)4) Seared something or other fish with delicious aioli and fried vegetable chips5) Sushi Course 5 pieces of exceptionally awesome sushi. Was the best tuna I've ever had6) Lobster course! Yes! I've always wanted a meal with a lobster course! 1/2 a Lobster baked with delicious indian tasting spcies. Very juicy. We felt a little bad sucking on lobster legs at such a fancy  place, but if they wanted us to be neat about it, they would have taken the meat out for us.7) Green Tea & Macaroon. Palate cleansing, macaroon a little too sweet for me.8) Kobe beef w/ sweet potatoes - amazing. This dish reminded me of an awesome sweet pot roast, but instead of a big hunk of cheap tough meat, we were presented with thin succulent barely rare cuts of kobe beef.  Awesome. They subbed in another fish for my girlfriend.9) Some crazy sweet potato cake w/ red bean foam (which I am usually not into, but was awesome) and coconut sorbet. It was OK - by that time I was stuffed to the gills so it was a nice to have a light dessert.Other things of note:- Morimoto was there hanging out by the door overseeing the operation. Seemed very friendly and engaged in the operation of the restaurant.- Japanese bathroom technology is so far advanced when compared to normal US standards.- We each had a Morimotini (wasabi infused!) and a carafe of Junmai sake which was delicious. The second carafe was probably unnecessary, but it was a special occasion.In the immortal words of Ferris Bueller:""It is so choice.

I started with their miso soup which was good but it only had 1 tiny scoop of fresh tofu that you had to dig for. Then I tried their sashimi salad which was disgusting- It was tuna crusted with sesame and nori. It sounded so good but was so salty and strong flavored that it was almost inedible. I also think they made this tuna the night before and put it in the refrigerator. The dessert was good. It was a white chocolate panacotta which was light and airy. Lastly, the service was really not good and definitely not what you'd expect at any decent restaurant.

Went for lunch looking to have the omakase, unfortunately, it is only served at dinner. Settled for the chirashi which was a lil different. I'll get to that in a moment. I actually started the meal with the highly recommended toro tartare, which was every bit as good as everyone claims to be. For my main, the chirashi was a medium bowl filled with assorted sashimi. What made it different was that they were cut into small cubes instead of the large slices I'm accustomed to. Took a lil getting used to, but in fact, I think it was more filling than the traditional slices, so the different take actually worked for me. You may have to work a little harder (more bites) but the end result is fairly satisfying (more filling).

The first time we went to Morimoto's we did the omakase.  While it was good, it did not offer the variety of Nobu or Bond Street, and it hit a sour note with an overly sweet kobe beef and sweet potato selection.  The second time we went we decided to just order sushi.  What a mistake.  We ordered the $100  ""Chef's Selection Platter"" which was  mostly made up of ho-hum items like cooked shrimp, egg, flabby eel, clam, and inedible squid. (yes the salmon, tuna, toro, and yellowtail were good, but just a bit above lesser neighborhood places.)   We also ordered the Fugu (Blowfish) which was a 50/50 disappointment.  The thinly sliced fish was tasteless and could very well have been fluke.  The skin is prepared three ways, which is two ways too many.  It has the texture of rubber bands and just about no flavor either.  However, there was one type of skin that was very good and the deep fried bones had an excellent flavor that was a nice break from the mediocrity of the overall meal.In addition, the service had fallen way off since our 1st visit last May.  Examples:  They do not leave the sake at the table and several times we had to ask for a refill of our glasses (water, too) which never happens when we are at 5 star restaurants.  Our sushi took quite a while to come out, and when it did we did not have the wasabi, ginger, and soy to eat it with; even with an apparent army of wait staff, no one seemed to know who nor how to get the items to our table.  Lastly , when they offered us after dinner drinks to make up for the service mistakes, even that got screwed up and took until we were half way through dessert to show up.Overall: take your money and head on over to Sasabune on the UES.  The fish is the best , the service is excellent, and after 5 visits we have never been unhappy!",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

After several drinks, the hostess escorted us back upstairs and sat us to our table. For a Sunday night, it was really crowded and the everyone was having a great time. We ordered the following dishes: toro tartare (awesome presentation and interesting concept, a must try), tuna pizza (heard it was popular, but just ok), crispy rock shrimp tempura (we had to get something fried from this menu, it was tasty), Oyster Foie Gras (can't get any better than this, a pearl of a find), Chef's Combination $100 (damn a lot of good sushi!!!), and for dessert Apple Turban (good, nothing spectacular), and Tofu Hot and Cold (this is a must try, it was excellent and taste very light). I would give this place a 5 star, but our Chef's Combination took quite a long time. Actually, long enough for our party of three to be the last ones to close the place down.

So, based on photos that I saw of the Morimoto Sashimi, the dish looked wonderful and the portion seemed large. According to the pictures, the sashimi looked like it had the width of about 1""+ and about 1""+ in height. Don't get fooled by the pictures!!! When my Morimoto Sashimi came, it was SUPER DUPER TINY!! I cannot explain how tiny it was and especially with a whooping price of $28, you would expect more than this. Also, maybe I didnt finish reading all the reviews for this restaurant but based on the recent reviews, no one mentioned anything about their green teas. You would think that green teas in all Japanese restaurants would be complimentary. NO, you're WRONG! At least not at Morimoto's. Me and my husband didn't know that there was a charge for green tea, so when we sat down, I ordered green tea as a starter drink before we browse through the menu. They bought out 2 teapots of green tea and I thought that was neat. When I got the bill, thats when I was shocked to see that we were charged $8 for 1 teapot of green tea, so in total, we were charged $16 for 2 teapots of green tea. Can you say ridiculous? There was no charge at Nobu for their green tea and I believe Nobu is more upscale than Morimoto. We also ordered non-alcoholic drinks because we didn't know that they charge for green tea. So to sum it up, we paid $30 total just for drinks and they werent even alcoholic drinks.These are just basically my only complaints. The food was decent and service was good. Tables are really close to each other and the area where we were sitting at, which was in a corner, it literally feels like we were dining with the 2 tables on the opposite ends of our table.  I was hoping that Morimoto would be better than Nobu, but its not.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

I asked about flour and mushrooms in my dishes because I have allergy. I was told they are not in my dishes. My husband started getting his tasting menu while I waited watching him eat. Finally I was told that the yosedofu takes about fifteen minutes to set. At about 11:20 it finally came out and I was told sorry the first one didn't set so now just wait another 10 minutes for this one. I asked manager what was going on and he started bringing me complimentary dishes to hold me over. I had miso soup, disgusting crab and a lobster that was raw. Mind you I  am 35 weeks pregnant. Finally at 11:45 the other manager comes and says all these problems are because I cant have flour and mushrooms.

Starting with the otoro was actually phenomenal, and at the time I felt the place was living up to my expectations, but this was all soon to change. Service was attentive, yet spotty. Also I experienced one of the worst server errors i Have ever seen.  During my less than fufilling meal a server ( not mine ) removed my bottle of sake from the ice bucket it was in and placed it in a shared ice bucket with the table behind us. she did not tell me she was doing this, and it appeared as if she was pouring my sake for another table. when i questioned my server about this she apologized, but did nothing to make up for it. Calamari salad was so-so, my favorite dish aside from the otoro.  The pork gyoza was served in an interesting manner, with a puff pastry shell but I did not enjoy them.  Worst dish of the night went to the house smoked salmon ravioli. Strange gelatinous texture on the ravioli made me not want to have another bite. Also some foam was on the ravioli but was not done properly, it was a watery mess.  The surf and turf claimed to have a wagyu filet, and it clearly was not.

I actually didn't have any expectations, knowing nothing about it, so I was very impressed from the moment I walked in. I am very into the decor and the interior of restaurants and this one lived up to my standards one-hundred percent. Modern, white, a very fresh feeling, none of that eat-in-the-dark modernity bs. I know the restaurant is pricey but I think it is definitely worth a try, and plus, I found it to be cheaper than Nobu (I don't know if that is a given and I hope I am not offending anybody by comparing Morimoto to Nobu!). My boyfriend ordered the Kobe steak, which was to die for, and Oysters, which were okay, but that might be because it was my first time trying oysters. The sashimi I ordered was very good, and so was the spicy tuna roll. I can't remember what else we ordered, sorry, it was a year ago, but I came out full and very satisfied! We had a couple of drinks each and I don't think we ordered a bottle of wine because the check was only 230$. The waitress was really nice, maybe too nice and too pretty in fact.... No but seriously, this place is awesome, I looooove it, I just wish I could afford a meal there on a regular basis.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The Morimoto bar/lounge is one of my favorites in the city after only one visit.  Absolutely stellar, stellar cocktails.  One of my favorite cocktail ingredients is ginger and I will always sample one if it's on the list.  Sadly, I don't remember the name (I will update this review next time I go) but Morimoto has the best ginger cocktail in this city that I've found.  It was basically a concotion with a little juice, lots of alcohol and lots of ginger but the overall result is delicious and balanced.  The feel at the bar BEFORE dinner, is very cool.. quiet, chic and not overdone.  I saw Bobby Flay eating his dinner and drinking cocktails at the bar after I was finished with dinner and visiting that jaw-dropping ladies room.  It's always good when chefs like the mixologist below the kitchen too.",Morimoto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

They eventually gave us a table next to the wall on the side, with no view or ambience of any kind as it was near the exit. Then the poor service started. The waitress seemed to be in a rush, and after giving menus disappeared for 10-15 minutes. We ordered the sake, appetizers, main course, desert. Everything seemed to take 20-30 minutes to come. We ended up leaving around 11:30.  To me the wait and the poor service seemed like a torture, but by then the alcohol had kicked in and the spicy king crab was on the table. It was really good! Everything else from there was what you would expect from a decent sushi restaurant; nothing super special. I guess what ruined it for me was the poor seating for us and the poor service; food was what you would expect if you are paying that much, with the exception of spicy king crab which was exceptional.
