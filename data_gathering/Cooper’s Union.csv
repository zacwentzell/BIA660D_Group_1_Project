Clean, fun, tasty.We tried a number of apps from the mac and cheese balls to the pretzels and everything was fresh and delicious. Mac and cheese balls stood out by far they were absolutely delicious. The Mac sliders were medium rare cooked perfectly and they were great! We played some shuffle board to pass the day and couldn't have had more fun.

6,WUhSkcmpwe-KFsXCQZ8n6g,H H.,4.0 star rating,"Super cool ""speakeasy"" in Hoboken.  Went there once a while back while exploring, and ended up doing dinner and drinks.  This review is for that experience! Pro's:  covert entrance (you can find it in the alley on the cobblestone street where the back entrances to the carriage houses used to be!), decent food (some stuff is full on Irish inspired like the Shepard's pie!), decent drink selection (beer, wine, cocktails-tap and draft available for beer), games (shuffle board, darts), and a unique vibe with good service.Con's:  I can't really think of any-just a word of caution-the front entrance is right next to the Hoboken police station, so keep it in check when leaving after a few drinks!  Other than that, the menu is somewhat limited (think Irish pub bar fare).Swing by for a pint-enter through the back-you won't regret it!",Cooper’s Union,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

Headed into Hoboken with a few friends to meet my brother for some good old fashion day drinking. It's a necessity when the winter chill breaks and gives way to a day like we had today. We popped around to some of our normal spots and then my buddy said he wanted to play pool or shuffleboard. I knew of some Hoboken bars with pool tables, but none with shuffleboard tables. I jumped online and the first result was Cooper's. It was a stones throw away so we headed on over. It was early but there were still a handful of patrons at the front bar. I was immediately struck by how clean and well organized the location was. The bartender greeted us with a smile and immediately suggested some of their house shot specials ""red dragons"". We slurped them down (not bad, fireball with some other nice flavor notes) and commenced with our shuffleboard tournament. Great little table and we had it all to our selfs for an hour or 2. The beers were flowing and soon the hunger took hold of all of us. My brother grabbed a menu and threw in an order for the group. I was not expecting much, just some regular drunk bar eats to sop up our beer filled bellys...we were all pleasantly surprised when the food came out how damn good it all was. (Sliders, pretzel, nachos, and the amazing mac and cheese balls). I could go on forever about how much we all enjoyed this bar, but I'll end with this. I now have a new go to spot and can't wait to get back out to Hoboken next weekend to play some shuffleboard and eat some damn good bar food!",Cooper’s Union,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

12,UtEmtJm0q-8tUQOMGnfi4g,Tom L.,4.0 star rating,"More low key place tucked away a bit away from wicked wolf, black bear, and the rest of the college bars, which is perfect for the old man in me. A bit small, but if you have a larger group try to make your way to the back where there's a back room. Only downside is I think there's only one or two bathrooms and...it's still Hoboken so getting here on the weekends is still a hassle.

I came here once on Saturday and hated my time here - music blasting, super dark, could barely hear the person I was trying to talk to - so was really pleasantly surprised when I came again on a Wednesday and the whole vibe was different. Bar had a good crowd going (not so empty that I felt like I was stepping into a serial killer's den, not so crowded that I'm stepping on toes) and seemed to be filled with regulars. Drinks were surprisingly decent - I had a pisco sour - and the shuffleboard was free! Also ordered some fries to share, and they hit the spot.

She angrily and most definitely hastily shook up a concoction that tasted like pure Vodka. Oh wait, that's because when she made our drinks she poured 3/4 of a glass of ice, half a glass of vodka and a dash of coke. No straw and no napkin, she yelled the cost to my friend and stormed off with his card leaving our drinks where she made them. No, she did not hand us our drinks. She did not ask if  we needed anything else. She instead, whipped it (the nae nae song reference) to her I suppose regulars.For a $14 dollar Long Island Tea, this (mind my language) tasted like shit.

Once inside, the atmosphere reveals itself as a balance of intimate but entertaining, with two separate bars and numerous TVs playing many sports games.We went on a Wednesday, a day where the restaurants offers a deal that the meal is 50% off if you write about your experience on a comment card and like their Facebook page or Twitter account. We ordered three specialty cocktails, all well-balanced with unique tastes. We also ordered a hot buffalo chicken dip as an appetizer which everyone enjoyed.The best part was the dinner and unexpected dessert. I ordered the macaroni and cheese with bacon, which was creamy and filled with sharp flavors. When we were about to ask for the bill, our attentive waitress brought over a dessert tray, on the house!

Met here for lunch with my buddy. Was looking for something close to work, quick and decent. Yelp lead me to here. Most reviewed we're based on the cocktails and nightlife but I also saw whispers of decent foods so I figured ""why not?"".When we walked in they had just opened for lunch about 30min ago. It was pretty empty. Just the bartender and a customer at the bar. She told us to sit where we like and came to greet us shortly after. She was sweet. We got our drinks and she told us about the lunch special of half sandwich & half salad/soup/homemade chips for $5! Crazy right? Well surprisingly we both decided on the lunch special. Half cheesesteak with chips. She tells us they actually don't have the chips right now. So ooook we'll take fries. She goes to put the order in and comes back out to inform is that they only have enough steak prepped for 1 of our sandwiches. Soooo you're telling me you only have enough steak prepped for a half of a steak sandwich. You have got to be kidding me. Not the bartender/waitresses fault and she was very apologetic. My friend takes the L and decides on the meatball sandwich. Both our food was mediocre. I had trouble figuring out how to rate it.

Thanks to so many positive reviews, I became convinced I had to stop here...and I was right.First of all, this is pretty much a straight-up bar. Well, bars actually; one in the front and one in the back with only a couple of high-top tables in between. Not a ton of room between those brick walls, but I arrived early in the afternoon and snagged a good seat. Plenty of flat screens, each one showing a different football game.Now, on to the drinks. I'm not usually a cocktail person, preferring craft beers most of the time, but I decided to venture out a bit and try the Coopers Union Cocktail. It's the first thing on the drink menu and consists of Irish whiskey, elderflower liqueur and a 'flamed orange zest.' Molly the bartender said it was a popular drink and I can see why. Very smooth and great for sipping. I made the mistake of eventually ordering a different drink, which I really didn't enjoy as much. My dislike must've shown because Molly soon replaced it with another glass of my original order without me even asking. A bartender who pays attention to detail = Awesome! Eventually, the place started filling up, with all stools occupied and little standing room for the mostly 20-30s crowd. Before heading out, I decided to try their buffalo wings, which were breaded, crispy and just the right temperature.Like I said before, I loved it here.

So if I may, a list - the ten things you need to know about Coopers.1. On Sundays, during the NFL season (go Pats!) they offer an all day beer and wings special - $13 dollars for two pitchers of any shitty light beer of your choosing (bud lite,  coors lite et. al.) and a pound of wings. All. Day.2. These wings are EPIC. I stopped being a vegetarian for these wings.3. This deserves repeating. I started eating meat again so I could eat THESE wings.4.They have the NFL ticket and a ton of TV's and are nice enough to both post which games will be on which TV ahead of time AND switch them around if it doesn't inconvenience any other patrons.5. The cocktail game is on point. The classics are great, the seasonal cocktails on the menu are great, and if Paddy is working, whatever he wants to make you (and let him serve you whatever he wants to make you) will be delicious.6. They make their own fireball. It's way better than fireball.7. Tots. Several variety of tots, in fact. The best are the pototchos and not just because I like saying the silly name.8. There's a shuffleboard table! I've never played, but hey it's there! 9.For some reason, the upstairs bathrooms are ALWAYS broken - i.e. won't flush. Use the one's downstairs (behind the ""bookcase."")10. There's a fireplace in the back corner with a large TV. You should sit here if you can snag it (but not on Sundays, because I'll be sitting there with my friends.)This is really a great addition to the Hoboken bar scene. Minus one star for the prices which can be prohibitive if you go anytime other than during the NFL deal (or if your friends aren't besties with the bartenders, natch.)

The bar seemed to be filled with locals carving pumpkins getting ready for the upcoming Halloween weekend! Without any hesitation the bartender said ""pick a pumpkin & I'll pick a drink for you."" The first drink she made had tarragon, pomegranate & ginger beer - quite possibly one of the most delicious cocktails I've ever had the pleasure of consuming. One of the owners, Paddy, came out & was chatting with everyone - he was very personable; really went out of his way to say hello to each person and connect with them. When he was talking to me I mentioned I had not had dinner & he insisted on bringing out something for me to snack on. The meatball sliders, not a choice I would have normally made, were really lovely. The presentation was nice while maintaining the homemade flavour I expect with meatballs. From that teaser I can't wait to go back & really give the menu a proper go.In the time it took me to carve my pumpkin I had the pleasure of trying three of the drinks on the top-notch cocktail menu. All of them were truly the design & creation of mixology professionals; something that is a breeze of fresh air among Hoboken's Miller Lite Bucket & Bud Light Pitcher drinks specials. I cannot wait to return here. I felt warm & welcomed the moment I walked in. The food that I had was great & the drinks were spectacular.

Luckily, management thought ahead and placed a very small typed note where the door used to be, stating that the entrance was on 1st and Court Street. It seemed a bit weird to have the main entrance in an alleyway, but I guess it serves two purposes: 1) to prevent a ton of noise / rambunctiousness from gracing the delicate ears of Hoboken's finest at 230am every Fri and Sat (the police station is next door), and 2) to confuse the hell out of the out-of-towners. No cover, and an amiable bouncer ushered us right in.InsideThe bar itself reminded me a lot of Buskers Bar and Grill on 1st street. It's more of a mellow, neighborhood style place rather than a cushy lounge or frat scene. They had music playing, which was unfortunately way too loud for the type of scene that the bar attracted. A couple of people played table shuffleboard in the back, while the buddy and I sat at the bar, watched a game on TV and just chilledTheir beer selection seemed pretty impressive at first glance; unfortunately, the taps weren't labeled (save for the Guinness tap), and there wasn't a beer list to be found. When we finally got someone to tell us the beer list, we were disappointed to see that they were mostly domestic (coors lt, bud lt, blue moon, etc.). However, they did have Yuengling on tap, and even better, they had one of my favorite Euro beers - Czechvar - on tap as well ($6 for a glass). ScoreOverallThis bar has more character than McCarthy's did, and it's a welcome change of pace bar from the usual Washington St fare. I honestly pictured this place would be something else due to the alleyway entrance, but I left here pleased, and would consider coming backPros:welcome change to the usual ""Hoboken style"" barCzechvar on tapCons:slightly confusing to get to if you've never been(non dance) music way too loud",Cooper’s Union,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

98,kaiswl2eLnS94HblvU8XeQ,Brian B.,4.0 star rating,"EDITORS NOTE: I am penning this review while hung over from last nights Yelp! Elite event at Cooper's Union... First, you may ask, why four stars and not five? I'll list my two ""cons"" here and leave the glowing remainder to follow. Keep in mind, these may not be cons to everyone, and are simply my opinions. To start, the music was just a bit too loud for my taste. I enjoy being able to speak with the people around me, not shout and constantly say ""What was that?"". (Music selection was good however, rare these days with all the terrible pop that exists.) Second, and this is pretty ""nit-picky"", but the bar stools at the first bar (yes, they have two bars!) shouldn't be there during large events or busy times. It becomes difficult for people to get by, and that's basically the main entrance way. (Also, only one bathroom?!...)Now the good stuff, and there's plenty of it.  The staff was awesome! (Shout out to Molly! What What?!) Not only was the staff excellent, but the general layout of the bar was perfect for the space. (aside from those damn bar stools) Again, I reiterate, TWO BARS! They have an old school shuffle board table that proves to be more difficult than you would think and plenty of high tops for socializing on your feet. (which I prefer to sitting)I didn't have a chance to sample the food (all meat and no veggies make Brian a dull boy) but from what others were saying, it was great. With that being said, if you're a vegetarian like me, check the menu before planning to eat dinner here. Overall, this place is a solid 4 stars and if I find myself downtown (it's so close to the PATH it's awesome) I'll certainly pop in to have myself one of their incredibly unique and delicious cocktails.

Also, expect the warmth of bouncers, bartenders and even the owner (usually onsite) to greet you and remember your face, name and drink(s) of choice. This is also a sleeper spot for Sunday Funday during football season, when they offer some of the best drink specials around...and questionably the Top 5 best wings in all of Hoboken.

We ended up here for a post-happy hour drink on a Friday and were pleasantly surprised by the clean well-run establishment with decent decor and a hint of a United Kingdom vibe. The bonus? They have Strongbow cider on tap - the only place in Hoboken I've found! There is one odd idiosyncrasy, which is why it always probably looked dark and uninviting from Hudson street, at a certain point in the night (10pm, perhaps?) You can't come and go from the entrance on Hudson Street and have to instead use the ""back door"" on Court Street. I definitely wasn't expecting that.

It holds onto the solid foundations of a meeting place to enjoy with great cocktails and great friends (and even meeting new ones!) Few things to touch on..DECOR - cozy meets chic. I have a soft spot for mason jars, so the fact that they are on all the tables with candles is a plus. The space is narrow but they've done a fantastic job of keeping a great flow. String lights line the ceiling - giving a mature, romantic feel. COCKTAILS - Delish. I was unsure of what to get - so the bartender asked what flavors i liked - sweet vs fresh vs savory etc and i absolutely adored the Tarragon and Pomegranate Mule. This past time I had a delightful new martini called a Morimoto (spelling?? my apologies!). It was super fresh and a perfect new summertime drink!STAFF - I have yet to meet an unfriendly staff member - they're all very knowledgeable and willing to help meet your individual taste.  It's also nice that they introduce themselves - makes it very inviting.

We confront her about it and she tries to make it seem as if she was doing us a favor because gold shots are so much better and wouldnt back down to that ...Which in reality was her robbing us trying to make our tab bigger because that is not what we ordered.I thought that was it and kind of was just like whatever because I was tired and t was not worth the argument. That was not it... I put my tab on my card and gave a cash tip. I then notice that when the charge gets posted to my bank account she WROTE IN AND ADDED HER OWN TIP TO MY CARD in addition to the cash tip I gave her. Not only is that illegal but it is not right.
