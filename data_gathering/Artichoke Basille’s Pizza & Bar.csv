The pizza selection was relatively wide but let me preface by saying the true wow factor came at the end.For 5 people we thought one large pizza and a make your own combo (3 slices) would suffice, so we ordered a combination the vodka and the crab pizza. Largely to or surprise, slices here are of thicker and wider measure than most places I have been to in New York. Albeit thick, the crust was still crispy, making it easy for us to chew.Of the kinds, I personally liked crab pizza the most. Artichoke uses imitation crab along with some massarella cheese. The pizza was warm enough that the cheese was melting off of it while we indulged. At the end of the day, the biggest surprise came when we weren't able to finish all the slices and still only paid about $10 a person including tax and tips. This is by far the most cost effective meal we've had in New York!",Artichoke Basille’s Pizza & Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

3,DKWFQXfRfsavwzd-Oyd35A,Andrea R.,3.0 star rating,"Pizza and New York are among the most iconic couples in the world. Can you really imagine one without the other? Pizza can be an affordable go-to eat in NYC, and there are no shortage of places claiming to have the best slice. Artichoke's came at the recommendation of a friend who had visited one of their locations on a past visit to NY, and claimed to really love their pizza. I was apprehensive when I heard they were somewhat of a chain, because there are so many other local, family-owned joints that deserve some love.We popped in around 3 on a rainy Sunday, and while there were many other patrons, it was far from busy. The hostess, a young girl, sat us immediately. She wasn't particularly welcoming or friendly, but I would chalk it up to her maturity level. In a bit of time crunch, we ordered the signature Artichoke pie. With a price tag of $34 for the standard pie size, I was more than happy to have two friends to share the cost. The big pie of 8 large slices came to the table within 10-15 minutes. The pizza was aesthetically very mouth-watering, and it smelled amazing.Imagine the creamiest artichoke dip topped with a thick layer of melty cheese. The pizza was very rich and creamy, and I had a hard time pacing myself. Unfortunately, the crust was very crunchy and borderline hard to eat. If you're a slice folder like myself, this pizza is not cooperative. I even tried cutting the pizza with a fork and knife, and it was too hard to break through without some serious muscle and mess. Overall, the flavors of the toppings were very good, but the crust ALMOST ruined the whole thing. The atmosphere is that of a hometown pub, nostalgic memorabilia lining the walls. Some of the picture frames could use a good dusting. The table service was average at best. Our waitress was another young girl with lacking people skills, likely just an issue of maturity. The large, creamy pizza was more than enough for us three girls. We were hungry, but the signature pizza was so rich with dairy that my stomach was a little upset for the remainder of the day. We each had two slices, leaving two for leftovers. I do think, even for New York, that $34 is a bit outrageous for one pizza. I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to come back here again. It was good, but I wasn't wowed, and there are just too many other places to try in NY. #pizzasnob",Artichoke Basille’s Pizza & Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

You can do to-go orders by the slice or a pie or you can dine in at this location. They even have outdoor seating at this location. There are multiple artichoke pizzas and they're all really good. To me you would pick your spot based on what part of the city you're at. Definitely worth a try for those visiting or people local who just haven't given it a shot yet.

19,6x_dxdOU1RJ4N64Z4SlOLA,Edward M.,3.0 star rating,"Much like the old saying about too much of a good thing, Artichoke Basille's seems to throw too many artichokes and cheese on their slice and call it a day. As a fan of both cheese and artichokes separately, I had figured they would go well together, especially after stumbling into the pizzeria on a cold and rainy afternoon, starving for lunch at 4PM. Shivering and dripping wet, I ordered a artichoke slice and did a double take at the price - $6 for a slice! After drying off by the heat of the oven, my slice was ready. While the first few bites were very good, everything from there was a struggle. Not content to throw normal cheese on the slice, Artichokes also includes a heavy cream sauce on top of a thick chewy dough. The cheese and dough created something overbearing in my mouth, making each bite seem harder than the next. As I reached the end of the slice, the cream sauce had overpowered my senses, and caused me to leave the crust with a good bite or two left on it - a pizza rarity for me. Similar to my discontent with dollar store pizzerias, there is little improvement that needs to happen with Pizza. $2-3 bucks a slice, regular cheese, good tomato sauce, and a nice greasy sheen are all that I need to enjoy",Artichoke Basille’s Pizza & Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

You can do to-go orders by the slice or a pie or you can dine in at this location. They even have outdoor seating at this location. There are multiple artichoke pizzas and they're all really good. To me you would pick your spot based on what part of the city you're at. Definitely worth a try for those visiting or people local who just haven't given it a shot yet.

39,6x_dxdOU1RJ4N64Z4SlOLA,Edward M.,3.0 star rating,"Much like the old saying about too much of a good thing, Artichoke Basille's seems to throw too many artichokes and cheese on their slice and call it a day. As a fan of both cheese and artichokes separately, I had figured they would go well together, especially after stumbling into the pizzeria on a cold and rainy afternoon, starving for lunch at 4PM. Shivering and dripping wet, I ordered a artichoke slice and did a double take at the price - $6 for a slice! After drying off by the heat of the oven, my slice was ready. While the first few bites were very good, everything from there was a struggle. Not content to throw normal cheese on the slice, Artichokes also includes a heavy cream sauce on top of a thick chewy dough. The cheese and dough created something overbearing in my mouth, making each bite seem harder than the next. As I reached the end of the slice, the cream sauce had overpowered my senses, and caused me to leave the crust with a good bite or two left on it - a pizza rarity for me. Similar to my discontent with dollar store pizzerias, there is little improvement that needs to happen with Pizza. $2-3 bucks a slice, regular cheese, good tomato sauce, and a nice greasy sheen are all that I need to enjoy",Artichoke Basille’s Pizza & Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

If you're not familiar with Artichoke Basille's pizza well you've been warned that eating anything more than one slice might just be overkill. The slices here are huge but not obnoxiously big. Their dough is different from what you'd get from most other pizzerias in that it resembles more of bread type consistency which is necessary to hold whatever sauce is on it. I usually go with their classic artichoke slice which reminds me of artichoke dip on top of a pizza with a nice amount of mootz..Its heavy, keeps my belly full, and is a bit pricey for a slice but you get what you pay for 10x.That's all there is to really say about Artichoke Basille's.

42,pgJI-DvhU1D-b_pO7chaHg,Cindy Z.,5.0 star rating,"Best pizza ever --hands down! I needed my slice of pizza being in New York and this place was on the top of my list. It was between lunch and dinner when I stopped by here, so I really wasn't hungry. My intentions was to simply get one slice just to try. Silly me didn't realize that they sell it by slice on the side where it's to-go. Instead, I ended up getting seated at the bar and ordering from the menu. So I'd highly suggest saving yourself tipping and having to ordering a whole pizza, go to the ""to-go"" section and grab your pizza to enjoy on the High Line instead. Since I was forced to order from the menu, I opted for the 17th Street Sampler ($17).It was a blessing in disguise to have to order 3 huge slices of pizza when I only wanted one. Because of this, I was able to try three types of pizza and I did not regret a single one. I tried the artichoke, crab, and white pizza. All of them were so incredibly cheesy, filled with toppings, and so delicious! If it came down to it, I honestly couldn't choose between the artichoke and crab. They were both so creamy and cheesy, which is so filling but you just can't stop eating it.I only took a bite out of each slice of pizza and then took the rest to-go in a pizza box. I ended up carrying this box of pizza with me to a restaurant for dinner, to a rooftop bar lounge where I coat-checked the pizza, walked 2 miles with my luggage in one hand and pizza box in another, and even brought it as my carry-on back to SF. I would not let go of this pizza.There has only been one other pizza that I loved so much before in Berkeley years ago. The funniest story was that my friend that brought me to the pizza spot in Berkeley finally helped me realized it was the exact same place I had this amazing pizza before --Artichoke Basille's Pizza.

When I asked for more basil the guy came with a side dish of basil leaves like I was supposed to garnish it myself. It wasn't my favorite but the Spinach & Artichoke hands down the best one. Then Staten Island came close second but the onions ruined it for me. If you are in town I recommend you check out this pizza place!

I'd opt directly for the takeout, because the security staff immediately jumps into ""all of our customers are drunk"" mode. By this, I mean the bouncer at the door assumes you are completely incompetent of acting like a civilized human being and even if you completely sober, their attitude does detract from the experience. Not to mention, you are also hungry (and probably drunk), so those two things do not combine well in and of themselves.Otherwise, it's a larger than average Artichoke with ample seating and waiter service with booths and a full bar. The food is always good and it's a good spot to eat with friends during the daytime, as well. Our bar hostess was super sweet and we enjoyed a pie of the classic Artichoke. The takeout area has smaller tables you can stand on to eat if you don't want to wait outside for an actual table.I would be careful late at night because loitering and sometimes even fights do occur outside, mainly because of the drunk crowd.

This particular location is different in that it has a sit-down area in addition to the typical take out. If you want to get a quick slice, you can go to the take out area which has some standing tables. Just know that the artichoke pizza, especially, is a bit messy so it's kind of hard to eat on the go. The slice is also a lot bigger than your typical slice (as can be seen by the multiple plates used in my photo).The Artichoke Pizza is unique in that it has no tomato sauce but instead contains huge amounts of cheese as well as an alfredo-type sauce that is likely made out of heavy, butter, and cream cheese. The closest thing it resembles in my mind is ranch dressing. The pizza also has spinach and artichokes, so it's basically like eating artichoke dip on bread.If you're sensitive when it comes to dairy, this is certainly not the pizza for you and they have various other slices as well if that is the case.The cleanliness of this restaurant is a bit questionable and my doubts were confirmed by the ""Rating Pending"" sign.

The staff was friendly and prompt. The decor was pretty cool, artichoke cans in the wall, pictures of celebrities, etc. Although, it was a bit dusty in there, especially the vent above the door.The food wasn't great. The pizza was slightly burnt. Some people enjoy that flavor, I don't. The burnt flavor really took first place which should have been the creamy sauce which is what I was looking forward to. Plus, I prefer a chewy slice of pizza, not really crispy. I'm not sure why everyone is obsessing over the pizza since it was literally just spinach artichoke dip on a pizza. Bland dip at that; we needed to put garlic powder and cheese on it to taste better. The dough was very thick. I think it would have tasted better on a slightly thinner crust so the sauce wouldn't soak into the bread as much. I would definitely try the original store on 14th st one day if I'm back in the area, but I wouldn't make a special trip out there for it.

This pizza is phenomenal. Creamy and crunchy.  I walked the high line and then came down the stairs and ended my little day trip with a slice of this. Fantastic.I also tried the margherita pizza which has olive oil, plum tomato, fresh basil and a blend of cheeses. This was good, but not as great as the original Artichoke Pizza.  Both of these are about $5 each. It isn't bad for how filling each slice is. They really pile on the cream and the cheese. I also had the white slice which wasnt anything out of this world.  The artichoke slice is the only thing  worth specifically  coming here for. There  is a cheaper alternative to not have to spend $30 every trip here. This shop has a little section where people get slices to go rather than buying a whole pie. From this area, I saw families that did buy whole pies throw out most of their $30 pie...There's a bar here. Yes, people do day drink here. There's also a restroom in this restaurant that patrons can use. Make sure you lock the door. You may think the door is shut, but MAKE SURE YOU LOCK IT. I had my door opened on me while I was using the restroom. Do not make the same mistake. I will definitely be back this summer for more! Overall, this is a good place for pizza.

While the crab pizza was unique, the others were nothing too special. Overall, all the slices were a little too salty for us and the crust and bottom of some slices were pretty burnt. Each slice averaged about $6, which was pretty pricey in our opinion. To be fair, my family is somewhat biased because we usually always go to Bleecker Street Pizza on 7th Ave, which has a nonna maria slice that is SO good and their prices are more reasonable with $2-$4 per slice.

Came in with a friend at 3am on (1/16/18)and we decided to order a pepperoni pie. The guy took my card when it came time to pay and mumbled the price that I would be charged. Now, I know that they are on the pricier side, but I looked at their price sign next to the oven, above the register and it said $5 a slice and $34 a pie, so I figured it would be $34. I got the receipt and I got charged $48 for a pepperoni pie... When I got home the next day I decided to call other artichoke locations and they ALL told me a pie is $34, after trying to get in touch with this location for a week with their phone lines being busy, I called again today (1/20/18) and when one of the guys picked up I told him that I got charged $48 for a pie and to my surprise he seemed in disbelief. He told me he would get the manager on the phone and once he did, I explained what happened. The manager then put me on hold and came back with the most BIZZARE answer I have ever heard ""AFTER A CERTAIN TIME (he didn't say what time) PRICES INCREASE along with the size of the pies? and that they start charging by the amount of slices in the pie?my pie had 8 normal sized slices so how did that come out to $48 when a slice is $5 ....Like I previously said it wasn't my first time here, the pie we received was a regular size 8 slice pie that he took from the back because it was already made and he just put pepperoni on it from a bucket. NOWHERE ONLINE OR IN THE STORE DOES IT SAY THAT""prices increase after a certain time along with the SIZE OF THE PIE"" that it the most bull**t excuse I have ever heard. The dishonesty that was coming out of his mouth was ridiculous. He then tried to offer me a ""discounted meal"" the next time I come in. LOL. They think they could run their business using PRICE GOUGING just because they are right next to Avenue and 1Oak and people won't notice what they're doing with their prices when they come in after a night of partying.They should realize that not every single person that walks in there is intoxicated :). Last time I checked PRICE GOUGING is illegal in the state of NY! Even when I called the other locations no one ever said that prices increase after ""a certain time because the ""pies get bigger"".

It looks like lots of tables around us also got the box salad - looked good but we had two people and the three slices of pizza were more than enough for us!!

I know this is weird to pick up on, but the A/C was on BLAST and it wasn't hot outside at all - so my friend and I were freezing our butts off and that it makes hard for me to enjoy my food.

115,uahv2JrbGij7Sniwen0oHQ,Anna L.,4.0 star rating,"My wanting to try the artichoke pizza drew us here. We walked about 2 miles in pretty blustery conditions from Times Square to Chelsea for this pizza. Why did we not take the subway? The only answer I can come up with is stupid tourists and first time in NYC at least for a very long time! Anyway, the place was really cute and cozy. We were immediately welcomed and sat at a nice table in the corner. Our server was super friendly and shared her opinions on which pizzas were the ""must haves"".My husband is usually a staunch pepperoni fan, but we agreed on the 17th Street Sampler; three huge slices for $17. We chose artichoke, vodka (the two recommended pies) and pepperoni (for my husband, of course). We also ordered a bottle of wine as we planned to stay awhile and warm up after the hike out here. We were pleasantly surprised to find a bottle of Brunello for a reasonable price at this casual stop. Let me start by saying the pizza slices/wedges are huge - the sampler is a great value if you want to try a variety of pies. Each wedge was cut in two making sharing exceptionally easy. Of the three, the pepperoni was my least favorite. The artichoke was creamy deliciousness with chunks of artichoke hearts covered in cheese. The crust was crispy and not as thick as the slice of vodka. The vodka slice was actually a huge square of thicker (think Sicilian) crust with loads of creamy tomato vodka sauce, tons of mozzarella and a crispy, cheesy thick edge. I loved both the artichoke and vodka pizzas! There was so much flavor in these slices. In comparison, the pepperoni was bland. While my husband loved the artichoke, he was not as fond of the vodka.  While I don't think this is the quintessential NYC pizza experience my husband was looking for, we had a most enjoyable lunch. I would definitely return for a slice of the artichoke or vodka, but next time I might take the subway. At least we were still warm from the wine - it snowed on our walk back to Times Square!",Artichoke Basille’s Pizza & Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

We ordered 4 different pies that all came out at different times. The servers weren't attentive and often forgetful. They were standing around talking and on their phones. I've had the crab at a BK location and it did not taste the same. I'm unclear if they've changed the recipe, but this crab slice was drowning in sauce, limited cheese and crab. The crab was also sprinkled on top. At the other location, the crab was underneath the cheese and it was amazing. The artichoke slice was too thick for me. The dough was huge unlike how I've had it previously. I'm wondering if this location was off, or they've changed things up a bit. I hope it's just this location because I was craving this pizza and was disappointed in these two pies. I'd recommend the vodka or Margarita slices.

I definitely understand the hype after trying it for the first time.Artichoke Pizza is pretty different from many pizza stores around NYC. 1) This place has artichoke as a pizza topping. I feel like the artichoke blended well together and for someone who might not like it, you don't really taste the artichoke (at least for me). 2) The slices are pretty big! It's not your typical slice. One slice can definitely fill your appetite.3) Very thick creamy sauce with lots of cheese It's very heavy to eat in terms of the sauce and the cheese (makes it extra filling). If it's fresh out of the oven like my slice, it's almost looks like clam chowder soup on your slice. Very messy to eat.

I want it to taste like the original. And for the prices and the name, it should be perfect every time. Sadly, this place was totally disappointing. PASS. Save your money. Since they opened other locations, it has not been the same. In fact it's been getting worse. The pizza at the artichoke in queens was dry one day and then tasted completely different (goat or sheep milk cheese - blech!) another time. This location was a disappointing as well. The crust was not the thick crunchy sturdy crust. As soon as it arrived it looked like bread dough. Not pizza dough. And barely any artichokes or taste. Basically it was like eating fresh bread topped w/ mozzarella cheese. It was doughy (so not cooked enough) and bland. For $34 ($37 w/ tax) for an Artichoke pie, this is unacceptable. This pizza should be perfect every time. Our guest from out own town was not impressed and we were embarrassed after how much we went on and on about how good it was.

We had wanted to eat in Chelsea Market, but because of overwhelming crowds, we opted for a sit-down restaurant instead. Lucky for us we only had to wait about a minute before being seated. That was not the case for the five groups of people that came in after us, though. It seems like depending on when you get here you can be seated very easily or not be able to get a table for 25 minutes.The thing that stuck out most for me here was the terrible service. First, our waiter forgot our waters. Then when he brought my sister and me our drinks he had to ask my husband what it was that he ordered in the first place, because he forgot.The bad service didn't stop at the drinks, though. We asked for 3 slices of pizza and an order of meatballs, and when he brought us our pizza only 2/3 slices were what we ordered. He let us keep the wrong slice (thanks??) and then took FOREVER to bring the right replacement slice. By the time we finished everything in front of us he had still not brought out the order of meatballs. By that point, we all were full and ready to go, so we were just hoping that he'd bring the check. Of course when we saw him approach our table again he had the damn meatballs in hand, so we ended up only eating half of what was brought since we were all so full from the food that we had digested.So, the service sucked. How was the food, you ask? It was OK. It wasn't typical NY pizza, as it was a lot thicker than I was expecting it to be. It tasted totally fine, but for ~ $5.50 a slice I would have expected something monumental. The cherry on top of the mediocre cake was when I went to the bathroom and had to hold my breath because it smelled like a fish had just taken a giant dump in there. Bleh!I think that your evaluation of this place will depend A LOT on what time of day you come here and how high the waiters are when they serve you.",Artichoke Basille’s Pizza & Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

Slices are rather large and a sure meal in itself.  I had ""the Staten Island"" which was something like onions meatballs and ricotta.  It was satisfying.  My friend chose the artichoke Pizza which was very thick in cheese and he felt sick afterwards.  This is NYC style pizza, not traditional Italian.The other slice choices on my visit were crab, meatball, pepperoni, and margherita.   A slim choice but I found something I liked.Counter service and table service are separate here but we sat on the patio outside anyway and ate, with the kind reminder from the hostess that if anyone wanted to sit there we'd have to give up the table. The patio is pretty nice, right near the Meatpacking District for a cheap meal on the go.Pizza - 3.5.  Good enough nyc street pizza Atmosphere - faux pub like, good downtown patio                   In the end, this place is and feels like a                    a chain.   Service - slow but friendly",Artichoke Basille’s Pizza & Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

I was having bad luck until I stumbled upon Artichoke while in Greenwich Village one day. I decided to order a slice of their well known artichoke pizza, and $5 later I had found my new soul mate. The pizza has a really thick crust, which is not common for a ""New York style"" pizza. It's topped with a cream sauce, cheese, spinach, and artichoke hearts. It tastes kind of like spinach artichoke dip on a pizza. Other great types are their margarita pizza, Sicilian pizza, and crab pizza. The inside has a few chairs but it's mostly a takeout restaurant. One helpful tip I've learned is that their slices are SO MUCH better than their whole pies. When you order an entire pizza the crust tends to be too soft/soggy, but one slice gives it some extra time while they heat it up in the oven and it's crispy and perfect.

Although the wait was about 1 hour on a Saturday night. Food: yummmmm and so filling. One slice is enough in my opinion. We got the classic spinach artichoke pie which they are famous for and was not disappointed. Perfect crust- none of that pizza falling apart in your hand nonsense. The crust was well baked and could handle the heavy sauce and toppings. It wasn't too oily and was perfectly fresh when we got it. Price: the entire pie is $32 and we split it so ended up being about $5 a person. Talk about a steal!!

It's probably the best drunk food when you had a couple too many drinks at The Park. With that being said, please know that this is a review NOT on the food, but on the quality of service.I get it. It's a pizza shop, and they probably have thousands of tourists that come in day in and day out. I also am aware that it's New York, and efficiency is basically the lifestyle here- TRUST ME I get it.I stopped in last Saturday to grab a quick slice, and for whatever reason, the guy manning the register/serving the ""to go"" line pizzas, was NOT having it. He was cutting pizzas so aggressively that by the time I got out, I had crust crumbs in my hair and in my ankle booties. It took him probably 8 minutes (yes, I timed him) to take our order, then another 13 to get us our pizzas. I have never in my experience of grabbing pizza here had to wait for more than 5 minutes. The line was almost out the door, and my booties were collecting crumbs to the point I had to take my shoe off outside to empty it. The food here is great, sit down service is great, and I will never discourage anyone from grabbing a slice here. HOWEVER, that one particular employee needs a SERIOUS reality check.

The crab slice that I got had probably 3 pieces of crab meat on it. If you look at other people's pictures, the slices are filled to the rim with crab and toppings. I am SO outraged. I swear they gave us all the slices they should've thrown away but decided to make a few bucks off of them anyways. Service was crazy slow.

The atmosphere of the place is very trendy and I was fairly surprised that it wasn't overwhelming busy considering it was around 5 on a Saturday. Our entire party wasn't there yet so we asked a hostess if we could just put our name down with them so we could be seated when everyone got there but she said no. No explanation but a flat out no.. (Which is why a star was removed, because honestly.. It was pretty rude). So we asked another girl if we could have a table even though we were waiting for another 2 people.. She was so much nicer and sat us. Anyway, we ordered a Moscow mule, a Southern mule, a Street sampler (a crab slice, a white slice, and Staten Island slice), and an Artichoke pie for our party of six. The Moscow mule was super refreshing especially with it being so hot outside! The white slice was a little too cheesy for me since it's just a blend of cheeses with no sauce. The Staten Island was pretty good with its meatballs. The crab slice was definitely my favorite! The crab meat pieces were meaty and it didn't taste too fishy and the sauce wasn't too heavy. The artichoke pizza was also very good, the sauce was creamy and I can see it being a little too heavy if you have too many slices but one or two?

The pizza here is pricey, but there is a deal where you can choose 3 different slices of pizza for $19. The slices are big, so it's basically like you're paying $19 for a med-large pie, but I was disappointed with the flavors and quality. We got the margherita pizza, which I liked best out of the three. Not too saucy, but good tomato topping. The artichoke pizza was creamy, but it wasn't awesome like I was hoping. Kind of bland, and the artichoke pieces were very small. The crab pizza was creamy as well, so it was overwhelming to have both types. It tasted very much like canned crab almost. I had such high expectations for Artichoke Basille's. I liked watching the bar, and hustle and bustle of the place, and our server was nice and joked with us. The beer menu was unique, and my bf and I were happy to be able to make happy hour for unique NY local drafts. I got the alphabet city beer, which was light and paired well with the thick, bready pizza. The pacman pizza chalk drawings, and sesame street dumpster outside are cool art to watch out for.

We did have to wait about 7 minutes for a table. The to-go line was ridiculously long. Our service was outstanding and we didn't have to wait too long for our 3 pizzas. Everything was freshly made to order. A little pricey for pizza ($5 a slice) but it's worth it. The quality of the pizza and the location is great.

Standing table space is pretty limited as is their dining areas, but you only get to sit and eat if you get a wedge or a whole pizza pie -- slices are all to go or eaten at the standing tables.

Here's our story:Myself and 2 friends arrived around 4am to grab some pizza after playing a gig. We waited outside for about 15-20minutes, and then bouncer let us in and cut off the line for the evening right as we walked into the restaurant. We then waited patiently for another 20-25 minutes to hear that they are out of pizza. However, some guy in front of us offered them $100 to make him a pizza to go... and they did it!!  We were quite upset and let them know that this was ridiculous, asking them why they let us into the restaurant to increase their prices last minute because they wanted to head home for the night. 2 sentences into the conversation, the bouncers approach us, ask us if we'd like to pay extra or ""get the F out"" like we are in a nightclub... and then physically start pushing us out the door.We immediately went to the cops down the street because of how they got physical with us. The cops listened to what we had to say and then approached the restaurant to investigate. **SIDE NOTE: One of my crew was a female and the bouncers still got physical** The lead bouncer runs out immediately, not because we got pushed out, but because we were talking to the police: ""Jared Paul - jared.paul@artichokepizz…"" - according to his business card, handed us 2 business cards and said we can have 20% off for a future time at the restaurant, but they are closing and the cooks want to go home. At that point, we shook our heads and walked away.I used to visit artichoke pizza on the east side all of the time.

Be noted that you can only buy pizzas in whole circular units in the seated section, whereas you can buy both slices and whole pizzas in the take-out section but have to eat it standing on the sidewalk outside.

He asks us what we want, and we told him 3 spinach/artichoke pizzas. We didn't even have to wait in the line, or wait for our food, since it came out immediately. I pay for our food, and he takes our box of pizza, asks them to cut the slices in half, and grabs us a table. FULL SERVICE VIP!The hip-hop/club music was poppin', we got a table, and we were eating the fat half slices all while dancing in our seats. This was the best VIP pizza club in all of NY!

Having tried Lombardi's the day before (which doesn't really compare), I genuinely liked the food here. Artichoke pizza resembles cream of broccoli soup on a pizza crust. The crab pizza was lovely as well,with a crab sauce base and crab toppings. CONS- FOOD: Pass on the Sicilian pizza. It resembles a tomato paste explosion on crust. Way too tomatoey for my taste. - W/R: Two bathroom stalls is unbecoming for the amount of people you serve. Shame on you! - SERVICE: Absolutely lacking. When my friends and I tried to order our individual slices, our waiter basically spat in our faces and said that we couldn't. Unbeknownst to us, we had to order a platter of 3 different slices ($17) as part of our sitting in a booth. If we wanted to order separately (individual slices are $5/each), we had to sit in the take out area. Just tell us, you rouge. Don't give us attitude. We ended up going for the $17 option with nothing short of a sour experience. If you do give Artichoke a try, get take out and sit on their high chairs.

It was interesting to have to literally step over drunk people in order to get inside.The size is definitely one of the main selling points for Artichoke.

I can't blame these two (or maybe, who knows) as security at our building's freight elevator is notoriously difficult.  My opinion is the pizza is meh, the only one that stood out and was good is the artichoke pizza.  The rest - meat, pepperoni and a margharita type I could have done without.Fast forward to a few days later...I need to call to get a copy of the receipt.  Again a repeat of the week prior, trying to get SOMEONE TO ANSWER THE PHONE.  I shoot them a tweet, nothing.  I shoot them an email, nothing.So lets just say none of us here will be ordering from Artichoke Basille's again.",Artichoke Basille’s Pizza & Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

A friend was visiting and we were looking for a lunch spot near the High Line. Initially, thought about eating at Chelsea Market but when we saw Artichoke Basille's, we decided to give it a shot. We got there around 12:30 and were easily able to find a table outside; about 30 minutes later, they were all full (this was on a Saturday). Still, the crowds weren't too crazy and it looked like you could definitely get a table without a wait (or at least a long one).A bunch of the pizzas sounded good and they have this awesome thing called the 17th street sampler where you can pick 3 and they give you a wedge of each of them. This was more than enough for the 2 of us; we actually ended up taking about 1/3 of it to go. So, this should be enough for 2 very hungry people and possibly even 3 people (though for 3 people, you might want to get an appetizer as well). We picked the Artichoke, Sicillian, and White pizzas:-Artichoke:  my favorite, although it is pretty rich (think spinach artichoke dip on a pretty thick crust) and I am not sure I would be able to eat more than 1 slice of this- Sicillian: pretty good but a little hard to eat as it has a ton of tomato sauce and not that much cheese- White: The cheese on this was a lot sharper than most other white pizzas (which are usually milder due to more mozzarella and ricotta; this one seemed to have a lot of reggiano on it also).  This was ok; I found it a little one note and I usually am a huge fan of white pizzas. I would go 3 1/2 stars here if I could, but with so many pizza places in the city that I like more, I went with 3.  I definitely did like  the option of trying multiple types of pizza, and they have a nice beer and wine list (the beer list is better than the wine).

The first time, my friends and I were about to go to the Whitney and wanted to grab some food before. We saw this place and decided to try it out. At the time, I was not aware of the hype, and the fact that this was such a famous restaurant. The decor was cute, and we were singing along to the throwback tunes they were playing. We decided to order the namesake slice, one each. Our first impressions? ""Wow, these are huge."" It's basically two big slices combined into one, so make sure you're hungry before you come here (or just order less). They were a little pricy for a typical New York slice, but given the size, it does make sense. The thing with the artichoke slice is that it's loaded with extremely cheesy and creamy sauce, and is super filling. My friends loved it, but I wasn't the biggest fan. It tasted good at first, but that heavy, dense sauce got old after a few bites. I found myself only eating half a slice, and I struggled to even finish that slice. Now don't get me wrong - I love cheesy, creamy stuff as much as the next guy (mac and cheese has to be one of my favorite foods), but still - there was just something about this pizza that I was not a fan of. When I later discovered the hype it has, I was extremely surprised. Also, this place has extremely thick, hard crusts (something that others seem to like), but as a typical New Yorker, I love my slices thin. I do suppose that they are made this way in order to support all the toppings and sauce on top, but I often felt myself not really enjoying the hard crust.  I would have given this place less stars, but my second visit saved my thoughts on it. I came here with family after walking down the High Line, feeling pretty hungry. After my experience with the artichoke slice from my first visit, I decided to order the vodka slice. Penna alla vodka is one of my favorite pasta dishes, so I thought this would be a safe choice. And it was! I loved this slice. Albeit it was just a regular pizza slice with vodka sauce on it, it was absolutely delicious, and even though it was still creamy, the fresh, tomato flavor that the artichoke slice, slathered with cheese, obviously lacks, made it far more digestible and easier to eat. It was still filling, but in the good way, not the dense way that gets kind of old that the first slice was. Maybe I was just hungry from all the walking, but I scarfed this  slice down much faster than I did the first. People do seem to love the artichoke slice according to other reviews, so to each their own, but I wasn't a big fan. However, the vodka slice was very good, and if I return, I would definitely order that again, or try something new on the menu too.",Artichoke Basille’s Pizza & Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

We asked if we could have extra sauce for the pie and the curt response was ""we don't do that, it's pre-made"". Wow pre-made pie for 32 dollars. When the pizza was ready we asked if we could have sauce on the side and the curt response again was ""we don't do that"". So we paid and on our way out we overheard the man behind the counter complain to the waitress ""oh my god these people"". I will never go back to this place or recommend it to any of my friends.

Bought a groupon deal to this place. $24 for a whole pie and 2 drinks. Quite a popular pizzeria. This place was full. We waited about 10 minutes for a table. Once we were seated, we pretty much knew what we wanted. Got our beers. Since this place is known for its artichoke pizza (hence the name of the place) that's what we got.The artichoke pizza- artichoke hearts, spinach, cream sauce, mozzeralla & Pecorino Romano cheese. The pizza was of huge portions. The table next to us said good luck finishing that. There is really no good way of eating it. It's kind of a messy pizza. Forget the fork and knife, just dig in.The most popular pizza, but it was alright pizza to me. Pizza was cooked nicely. I barely tasted the artichoke and spinach. It was mostly cream and cheese I tasted. You're good after 2 slices. 3 slices is pushing it. Be amazing if you can eat 4 slices. If you had a group of 3 then you can finish a whole artichoke pie. The 2 of us couldn't  finish it. Service was quite on the spot. Our waiter knew we were using a groupon deal. Went straight for the phone without even asking. Artichoke pie was $32 + 2 beers. Probably over $40 right there. Since we had a groupon deal. Our bill was $1.49.

We were unaware that it was $6 a slice and she also organized the check in a very odd way, but the total was the same, which we were still unaware of at this point. So we ask her, and this bitch has the audacity to literally count each slice and then add it up. She did it like deadass six times. She went around the table, asked us how many slices we ate, and then added it up and showed us on the receipt. Are we in kindergarten bitch? I think the fuck not. So we're about to sucker punch a bitch at this point because she was rude as fuck. So we pay the fucking bill and she gives us our receipts back which we need to ultimately sign and return to her, but she doesn't give us a pen.

I am very liberal with my low star reviews, and I feel the only star this review deserves is for our waitress.I came with the BF while near the Chelsea area craving pizza. Originally, I had wanted to get Lombardi's, but BF insisted Artichokes was really good and wanted to try this location. We went in and saw that there was table service, which was great. We honestly should have gotten a self service seat in the back. Our waitress got us water and forgot about our ginger ale until reminding her later. We ordered the sampler which looked like a pretty good deal to try different slices, but it is basically 3 slices of reheated $5 pizza for $17. We also ordered the stuffed artichoke appetizer.It was not a full house and not very busy, but we did not expect all to wait nearly 30 minutes for the artichoke. When it came, we were starving and it was burned beyond recognition. I wish I had a gotten a picture but it was charred like there was no tomorrow. We attempted to eat it and it was extremely salty and unchewable. There was no way we could even eat it. We told our waitress and she attempted to explain that you were supposed to chew the tips and not really eat it, but how can you even chew burned rubber? We returned it to the kitchen, which the waitress hesitated trying to explain that this is how it is usually. She offered to replace it with another appetizer and we picked garlic sticks, which we never even saw the light of at our table. I highly believe that if you serve a dish your restaurant is named after, it better at least be edible.We waited another 10 minutes for pizza. Waiting 30 minutes for slices of pizza? This better be fresher than Will Smith in Bel Air. We ordered Sicilian, artichoke and white. The first one we tried was the Sicilian which was disgusting. Again the crust and bottom was charred and burned black! There was way too much tomato sauce that was extreme sweet and soggy that it was all you tasted. The basil was burned so badly that we didn't realize it. Is this even pizza?The artichoke was the house specialty. I had high expectations for this since it was the famous slice the place is named after. It was the only slice that didn't have a burned crust. The artichoke dip as a topping concept was nasty. It was not cheesy and feels like someone had taken a half warm artichoke soup and put it on pizza. Yes it was like having one of those soupy bread bowls from Pizza Hut. Talk about major fail. Imagine eating this with your hands, it would probably spill all over the place. The consistency? Undercooked egg white swimming around spinach with non existent artichoke and cheese or flavor. It just tasted heavy and nasty. I felt sick to my stomach and couldn't even eat this so called ""pizza."" I would highly rename this watery artichoke soup on bread. The white was the only edible one. It was very dry, a sign that it's been sitting for a long time and put in the for oven too long. There was not enough ricotta and it was in desperate need of some oil and herbs and flavor. The bottom of the crust was also burned and I could not eat it and only scrapped off the top. This really made me think about the terrible consistency this place has. How were two pizzas burned and one still watery? I was extremely disappointed, especially with the hype surrounding the place. My expectations for Italian food are very high because the flavors are so simple yet the key is to use fresh ingredients and use the right techniques to make it the right way. Artichoke was a huge let down. The waitress was so embarrassed of the kitchen she did not even dare check on on us because she knew the pizza was disgusting. She did however take off the nasty burned stuffed artichoke from our check and I pray no one will ever order it. Whoever calls this good pizza probably has never had a slice of 99 cent Two Bros, which is astronomically better than Artichokes. I will never come back to this location. So over priced to pay 17 dollars for 2 slices and a square of ""pizza.""

It reminds me of spinach artichoke dip topped on a pizza crust instead of chips. Nothing too fancy but definitely good when it's fresh! Dining In:While the weather was chilly, we decided to ""dine in"". Dine in means full service and whole pizza only. My boyfriend and I decided to share a small pizza and beer. Our server didn't mention how big the beer cups were. Although I would highly recommend ordering their beer, it was served in a 40oz cup. She gave us two!! We barely managed to finish 4 slices plus our drinks... Not a good way to end the night.Dislike1. The Dine-in rule need to go and here's why.  -Eating a slice of pizza doesn't take more than 10min.  -You can always put a courtesy sign/time reminder for customers when it gets busy. That's keeps the restaurant circulating. -You can get more tips. -Doesn't it feel wrong to send your customers out for not ordering a whole pizza?!  -Dine in tables are usually empty not because they don't have enough people to eat up to 6 slices. Most people dont want to share one flavor. We all have different tastes. -It's not about the price 2. I would really love it if their pizza wasn't all dough. It really fills you up! I also expected more cheese. Like melted, stringy, and overflowing... But it's not. Sad!3. For dine-in, our pizza wasn't fresh out the oven.

We came here in the afternoon after walking around the High Line on a Saturday. We were told there was going to be a 15 minute wait that ended up being more like 30. We agreed to sit outside even though it was a little chilly (to my Californian standards) and I think that was where we went wrong. My previous visits to Artichoke was to their East Village location, where we sat indoors and ordered a full, fresh pie -- you know, the kind where the sauce is still bubbling as they bring it out. However, here, we ordered 4 slices of the artichoke pizza and 4 slices of other toppings (who cares what those were, I came here for the artichoke). I'm not sure if it was because of the cold weather or because we didn't order a whole pizza, but I was disappointed to find that the pizza was already lukewarm. It was still delicious, nevertheless! How they pack so much flavor onto a slice a of pizza, I'll never know. But it just wasn't satisfying as I hoped it would be. Sadly, my mozzarella was chewy by the end of the meal.Service was meh; also probably because we were sitting outside. We got halfway into our pizza before they brought out water that we asked for at the beginning. We didn't really get checked up on that often.Note - they cut a slice of Costco-sized pizza in half, so once slice looks like twice slices. We were like O.O when we ordered 8 slices and ended up with 16. My friend, who was unable to make it to the restaurant, had a slice of our reheated leftovers and was blown away.

With a break in the weather, we arrived at the restaurant hungry and found a well decorated restaurant with a busy vibe. We were amazed at the line of people who were at the carry out door waiting for a slice to go.     Seated relatively quickly for the lunch time rush, our waiter got us started. With his suggestions in hand, we ordered a salad to share and the three slice selection of some of the best selections. Are we glad we did! The salad was excellent, more than enough for two people to share and full of quality ingredients in generous quantities. The pizza selections were served hot and full of the unique flavor that the brothers are famous for.

Immediately, my friend wasn't a fan of the ""hipster"" mason jars for beer and the tiny wine glasses, but that could be because we all have slight drinking problems.That aside, we had the artichoke pizza (naturally) and the meatball (I think). The crust on the artichoke was like a biscuit...surprisingly good and crunchy and buttery and flakey. Seriously biscuity (re: fatty) like. It was good and held up to the glopping mess that the artichoke (dip) was on top. Actually, it all maybe would have been a bit more successful as an artichoke dip with biscuit like tortillas. In any case, the artichoke topping wasn't bad. Very creamy, less artichokey, but not bad. It was VERY rich though.The second pizza, meatball I think, was the lesser of the two. The crust was nice, thin, crunchy, but the topping was just a little less than bland. The sauce tasted fresh, but it was very sparingly seasoned, and you could barely make out anything from the meatballs. Nothing to write home about, and could have gotten a better slice anywhere....it WAS fresh and hot though. Not impressed...we ordered 2 pies and ate all the artichoke and had 4 slices left of the meatball...All in all, I'm glad I went, but I probably wouldn't go again.

The artichoke and cheese melted together nicely and it was creamy and very flavorful. I love adding a bit more red chili pepper flakes and garlic for an extra kick and to balance out the heaviness of the pizza. Though it is heavy, just ask for a cup of water and continue enjoying! The crust is also crunchy and they seem to have perfected the crust to pizza ratio. I normally don't eat the last bits of crust on normal pizza but I like dipping the end bits in the artichoke and cheese that is on my plate.This location is different in that they have a sit down place in the same area.

If you're a tomato sauce kinda person, go for the margarita, vodka(square slice) or a Staten Island slice. The Staten Island would have been better with more mozzarella cheese to give it a balance. There was too much ricotta and sauce going on. The meatball on it was good though. If you like your pizza creamy, like pasta, then go for the artichoke. I thought it was a little too heavy for my taste. It was also so huge that my friend ""felt his arteries getting clogged"" from one slice. It didn't taste like there was enough cheese. It was interesting to try, but I wouldn't eat an entire slice by itself. My favorite was the crab slice. They had just the right amount of sauce and cheese. They also used real crab meat and the pizza wasn't too heavy like the artichoke pizza. Every slice no matter what topping it has are all $5, tax included.

We ordered a large artichoke pizza pie but the waitperson informed us there were no artichoke pies! He then told us it would be an hour if we wanted an entire pie. We agreed to wait but then he returned and said it would be one and a half to two hours for the pie but we could get a couple of slices! We wound up taking the slices and getting something else, but after our food arrived,  the same waiter brought the guests seated next to us an artichoke pie. I'm not sure why the waitperson was dishonest, we weren't  rude or demanding. We just wanted an artichoke pie. My brother still tipped him generously even after we discovered he lied about getting an artichoke pie. We went to Artichoke Pizza for their signature dish but we were told it wasn't available.  The waitperson's dishonesty was confusing and unfortunate.

I've taken friends and family there and you'd think that since a quick slice is what the franchise is known for that they'd have more available seating for that. They have this large space of a restaurant that is always empty when I go, because they have a 3 slice minimum, but they won't allow the one slice clients to use that space. One of my friends told me about his experience. He was disabled and needed a seat and they still wouldn't let him sit in the restaurant without a 3 slice minimum. That's for one star deduction though.The second star deduction is due to the unsanitary preparation standards. During my last visit with my sister, while waiting for our pizza we noticed that one of the guys was constantly on his cell phone. He would alternate between texting and then picking up a handful of cheese and spreading it on pizza. He did this throughout the entire time that we were there. He placed his phone under a desk fan each time. He wasn't wearing gloves which wouldn't be a problem if he hadn't been constantly contaminating the food by touching his germ-ridden phone.

On paper everything looks promising: they accept credit card, offers seating for groups, is located near some of the most popular attractions of west Manhattan and is the largest one. So what gives?It comes down to the pizza. It's good, but the West and East Village locations seem far superior. I've had a few decent renditions of their Sicilian style but that's about where it ends. The spinach artichoke has been more soupy than substantial and the crab pizza seem a bit flimsy and don't hold together too well. While the other pies are still hearty and heavy, the crusts are tough and they've somehow dipped along the Artichoke tastiness scale. While I would normally attribute most of the issues to bad luck, I've been here too many times to note otherwise.But beyond the pizza gripes, there is a greater issue: the crowds. The weekend waits can be beyond an hour if not more. A little mix of tourists and quite a few families, I'm not always big on dining in if I don't have to. The bigger the group it seems, will result in longer the wait. I'm just waiting for them to start adopting a C-Town approach of letting strangers share tables.On a positive note, the location is pretty ideal.

Had heard a lot about this place and their artichoke pizza, so we decided to get a pie for the table. It took a half hour to get served our one pizza pie, and the entire thing was burned. We requested that we get another pie given the first one was burned, and although we had already waited so long, we were willing to wait to get another pie because the first one was THAT burned and inedible. (Like you could chip your tooth on the crust status). Our waitress was very sweet about it and obliged. Another 20 minutes later, our replacement pizza came. Needless to say, we were very disappointed with our experience given the obviously long wait time (and the restaurant barely had any people in it that night) and the fact that such a well-known establishment would allow burned pizza to be served. Commenting on the pizza itself, it was mediocre, overpriced, and I wouldn't return.",Artichoke Basille’s Pizza & Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

And I mean really, really bad. We got seated quickly after checking in with the hostess. A couple of other tables got seated maybe 5-10 mins after us and got served waters and beer before we had even been greeted by our server. When we finally got her attention we ordered 2 waters and a coke. She took so long getting those that we finally had to ask her again, because we assumed she had forgotten. She used this moment to berate us for being impatient...keep in mind it had been a good 10 minutes since we ordered them. I couldn't believe how rude she was.From that point on we knew we were in for it. We got our pizza ordered when she brought the drinks, but anything else we needed (refills, condiments, the check) had to be done by anyone we could flag down. That wasn't easy, either. The people sitting in our area were complaining also, and when I got up to use the restroom I heard a customer in another area complaining that no one had helped them either. I like to think of myself as a pretty patient and understanding person, but this place actually had me enraged. Good pizza, though! The only downside to the actual pizza is that you can't order a normal amount of food for one person when you are sitting at a table. In a perfect world my husband and I would have gotten 2 slices each (the slices are massive), but they force you to get 3 slices each or a whole pizza. It is nearly impossible to finish that amount of food. We were visiting from out of state, so it isn't as though we were keen on hauling leftovers around town and then back to our hotel.",Artichoke Basille’s Pizza & Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"
496,ZDvOHVw_j_0zSfAcOLq5Zw,Stephanie F.,1.0 star rating,"Wow!!! was I disappointed by this location of Artichoke. There has to be a reason why the East Village location has a strong 4 star rating with over two thousand reviews while this one can barely scrape 3 stars with just 500 reviews - and I found out why.I was having a stroll along the High Line when my boyfriend and I ducked in here for a slice o pizza. The last time I was at this location was over two years ago and the Vodka slice blew me away! I've since been to the other Artichoke locations and continued to love love love the Vodka slice. So I was back where I fell in love but something didn't add up for me.The vodka slice was just straight up NASTY! The crust on the bottom had soaked up so much oil somehow that there was literally half an inch of oil soaked bread with my slice. Then it was thrown into the oven again and became so rock hard that I could've chipped a tooth biting into it. It was so unappetizing I just threw it out. My boyfriend ordered a regular artichoke slice and even that was gross! It was beyond soggy and limp. The cream sauce was half solidified and half mush - it was really confusing and gave it the grossest texture. Clearly we were eating some old, nasty pizza that hadn't been properly stored overnight. To top it off, I tried to use my Yelp Check In deal for a free beer just to fill my belly and salvage the trip. I mean, free beer can pretty much make up for a lot of things but the bartender/counter-guy had no clue what the check in deal was and acted as if they were doing me a huge favor by giving me the beer. Here's a tip- don't offer Check In deals if you don't plan on telling your staff about them. I waited 20 mins for them to scratch their heads before I gave up. It was just a disappointing meal.

I mean, I know pizza is great and as delicious as they are, they are not calorie shy or diet friendly, but if you ever get a chance to come in and try their signature pizza, for which they have named their shop, you must not hesitate.Their artichoke pizza is the bomb! Yes, you heard me, the BOMB!! I have yet to try any pizza that is so friggin good as this was! (open to other pizza place suggestions) the artichoke pizza is very seasoned, very cheesy, and is served fresh from the oven, not like other pizza places that have them staring at people all day and get reheated. The creamy cheese basically runs into your mouth and the artichoke plays such a perfect blend (plus, it's artichoke, so kind of tricks you to think you are eating some what healthy)! This pizza was the most delicious thick slice of pizza I have ever had, and now I dream of this pizza every day (ok not really, but if anyone ever asks for pizza I know exactly where I would recommend them to go!).Definitely looking forward to come here and try a different slice... and get another artichoke slice! The pie was around $32 for a Medium sized pie (based on what other pizza places call medium). Each slice by itself is $5. So if you are with a big group of friends, getting a pie is about $4 per person. If not, come alone and give your taste buds something to thank you for the rest of your!!I normally say a pizza shop is not a good first date type place, this one isn't the exception, but the pizza is so darn good, you should stop here after your first date night and a few drinks.

Yes, I had high hopes here, as many a native had told this new New Yorker that Artichoke is a city institution. But man, this place was disappointing. The pizza had a monotonous taste to it. I had the eponymous artichoke pizza, and really it just tasted like a heavy mess. The artichoke didn't pack in a punch at all, and neither did the mozzarella. All I tasted was cream. This slice could have definitely used basil, garlic, something to make it interesting!The bottom crust was firm enough to hold the massive layer of artichoke sauce above, but it had none of the defining smokiness associated with New York pizza. Rather than spending $5 for a massive slice that was cut in half, how about charging $2.50 for one of those slices? I'd rather not overpay for a lackluster slice. Artichoke was also really confusing as to where to order; you need to find a waitress to ask you (there is no hostess to welcome you). Sit at the booth and you can order a full pie of artichoke for $32. Go to the bar and you can order a slice. Service was mediocre. Even though when I was at the bar things were not all that hectic (I was there on a Thursday at 8pm), the waitress took her time in taking my request for the bill.

We were seated right away, but only because we were a party of 2, there were people there waiting for larger tables.Our ""host"" (who also waited on us) seemed extremely grumpy. Maybe he was just having an off-day, or was overwhelmed by how busy it was, but we were totally turned off by his attitude. I mentioned I had the Living Social deal, & he immediately asked what beers we wanted. I barely had my jacket off. I said we'd need a minute. When he came back, we gave our beer orders, and he said ""And the pizza?"" rather impatiently. Once again, I told him we'd need a few minutes. Not ones to let a sour mood ruin our time, my friend & I had a wonderful time. And one of the other waiters who came by a few times was SUPER nice. Kept checking in with us to see if we were okay. The pizza: excellent. We ordered the Artichoke Pizza (when in Rome ... ) and liked it a lot. It wasn't like your traditional pizza, much thicker than the slices we're used to, but still very good. Be warned: this is a lot of food. Even if it doesn't look like a lot, I think it's thicker and very dense. Cons: the waiter / host. And the fact that people are morons and stand outside the restaurant on a 50 degree day with the door open. I understand that there was a line, but ... in or out, people!!! It could help if the restaurant would install one of those vestibule thingies outside the main door for the colder months. Or if people were just more considerate. Anyway, because of these people, there was almost a constant stream of cold air coming in while they stood with the door propped open. Sit towards the back if you want to avoid this. Of course, if it's this busy like this you might not have a choice. Catch 22. Finally, I always like to comment on how restaurants handle group deals. Artichoke's did great.

Pizzas: Artichoke was tasty albeit heavy due to the cream, crab was flavorful/had lots of crab pieces, and didn't get to try their margherita because by the time I finished the first two wedge slices I was full! But my boyfriend said the margherita was flavorful so I'll take his word for it, and you can too, if you want. Be warned though, the pizzas will make you really thirsty... seems like the sodium content may be pretty high. Meatballs: HUGE. And meaty, saucy, & cheesy. I think the sauce could have used a little more flavor or seasoning, but it was still good nevertheless. Overall, if you're craving specialty pizza and just finished a nice workout/walk on the High Line, you should try out the pizza here.

The dough is very bready and is thicker than the typical NYC slice. The crusts were like eating a huge breadstick. So if you like deep dish or thicker crust pizzas then you will love it. Even though I'm normally a thin crust fan I enjoyed it but I don't know if I am dying to go back. The pies, though expensive, are huge.

We ordered the stuffed artichoke which was actually very good but before we were able to get through the appetizer the pizza came out. I would suggest staggering a little more. The pizza itself was just okay. One of the members of our party said something like ""the sauce is what you'd expect for pasta"". Just a little sweet.

The Vodka Sicilian was out of this world! They totally nailed the flavors in the tangy, garlicky sauce, and did not skimp on cheese. Luckily, I was able to nab a corner slice and the crust was PERFECT. Crunchy, thin, and airy, I did not need to use the utensils provided (I'm a New Yorker after all, you should be ashamed of yourself if you do). One of the very few times in my life I actually remained quiet for more than five minutes.I was a bit disappointed in the Artichoke pie as it wasn't really hot enough, and I'm like an old lady with food temp.

Though, I do have fond memories as an early mid-20's something getting drunk along 2nd avenue or in the E. Village and ending up waiting in line for a slice of that incredibly heavy thick slab of Artichoke pizza in the middle of the night years upon years ago. Haven't been back in a long time. Anna, Steph, and I were at an open gin event just before Christmas and we could find nothing that was still open at around 10pm and wandered into this ole place. I'm glad I got to try the larger restaurant finally. A place with seats! I'm not 22 eating my slice and falling asleep on the subway any longer. Hooray.Walking in they have near the bar area the leg lamp from 'A Christmas Story'. Already, I love it and the picture of the Kennedy's looming over our table. I made the mistake of ordering a Bengali Tiger beer. Decently priced beer. Not over the top. I've had Artichoke a million times before so convinced the others to try something I haven't from here: The Meatball Parm and on the other half a White Pie. The Meatball Parm was way better. The tomato sauce was sweet and tantalizingly good. I burned my tongue pretty bad on it. White Pie was decent but once it started cooling down it just tasted like cheese pizza without much flavor and not enough ricotta piled on it. I think the one thing I've never loved about Artichoke is how thick the crust is. It's like a solid chunk of thick cut crust, weighed down with sauce and cheese and meats. It works best with the artichokes because it all gets sopped up into that thick cut crusty dough. But other pizzas. . . . not so sure.

I'm familiar to the East Side location, but was overjoyed to find their second (and much larger) location! Had to be the typical First Timer and ordered the large Artichoke Pizza. There were three of us, but enough food for 5. The pizza is a-typical for New York as it is very puffy, but light. The crust is crispy enough, but still soft enough to break easily. The cheese was so delectible, gooey and rich that after two slices I was cashed (lactose allergy doesn't help). The artichoke was definitely the forefront of the bite though, despite the copious amounts of cheese. We passed on the artichoke beer, but mostly becuase our waiter told us it was really sweet and we weren't in the mood. As we were getting ready to leave, the manager came and sat down with us for a while to chat and ask about our experience.

I gave this place THREE tries, which is completely unheard of by NYC standards. My first experience was when my sister was visiting from Chicago last August 2014. I told her about great pizza blah blah blah, open late, etc etc. We walk all the way from 23rd and 7th, around 11pm, and it's closed!!! On a Friday night.Second experience was a few weeks ago, ordered the meatball parm pizza. I could barely eat it because it was so hard and nearly completely burnt. I had to throw away all of the crust and about 1/4 of the slice in from the crust. I didn't bother complaining because I didn't want to wait for another pizza I was so hungry. Fool me once shame on you.Third experience, I thought adding a note to my delivery would help. I made sure to tell them not to burn my pizza. It arrived, box completely crushed and soggy on one end from who knows what kind of water kicked up from the delivery guy's bike. I open it to find the pizza is almost burnt underneath  and soupy on top! I had to broil it so that the top could match the bottom. I also ordered a tomato and mozzarella salad. It was literally just tomatoes - sliced and horrible quality (like the pale pink kind you get from cheap fast food places, even McDonalds gives better tomatoes), and huge chunks of mozzarella cheese without any seasoning or explanation of how such a thing could even be put on a menu as a salad. I seasoned it myself and made my own balsamic dressing to go with it. After I did the rest of the cooking that Artichoke B.S. failed to do before arriving at my apartment, I ate it all because again, I was hungry.For $32 a pizza and $11 a salad...

Unfortunately for ABP, this isn't one of them. That's not to say that the slice wasn't good. However, it wasn't everything that I thought it would be.

The pepperoni pie had a sugary sauce that almost tasted like a Ragu :(. I think even yuppies would notice that the sauce didnt say very traditional italian at all. It was just soo sweet and sugary. The crust itself was doughy on the pie as well. Overall not worth waiting the 45mins we did for a seat.

It just didn't quite do it for me. Way too doughy and after eating I felt as bloated as Donald Trumps ego. The other pizza was decent but not worth the price at $5/slice. A little much if you ask me. Next the service. It took 55 mins for 3 slices of pizza on a Thursday night at 9:30. The restaurant was nearly empty and there wasn't a high demand. But let me tell you, it simply took forever to get a slice. The waitress didn't seemed concerned with the unnecessarily long wait. And to top it off she forgot half of our order.

Upon entering, service was slow, and the place was relatively hopping. However, when a sign says, ""Please Wait To Be Seated"" with no hostess and you need to walk to the bar three minutes later to ask the bartender where a seat is, that does not bode well.Mariko, my dear pizza-craving friend, insisted upon the artichoke pie. Top and center on the menu, boasting artichoke, spinach, cheese, white creamy sauce on a thick crust...at $30 for a large pie?! Eeep! Then, I thought, ""Well...leftovers..."", so, I obliged, once again. It was cute: she was so nervous! She was worried that I would not like it! As we both discussed how we get really bummed when we insist food is good to friends but they don't like it, our pie came out, almost as large as our small two-person table. There it was, in all of its bubbling glory.First Bite: Mariko had the pleasure of seeing my O Face.Second Bite: My eyes were rolling into the back of my head from the pleasure of the white cream, artichoke, and spinach swirling in my mouth.Third Bite: I started to note how thick the crust was. Doughy, thick, and wonderful.Fourth Bite: WOW. Mariko wasn't kidding. This pizza is LEGIT.Eighth Bite: *phew* Heavy, but I'll be able to manage a second slice, surely.Tenth BIte: OH GOD. MY STOMACH. SO GOOD. MUST. FINISH...Eleventh Bite: Ooooh...so many leftovers...too much...oh my goodness...10:04 a.m. the next morning: I WANT MORE PIZZA.The pizza? Yes, suburb! Mariko did not steer me wrong. It's like they slathered a pizza crust with artichoke dip. Hot DAMN.My only qualms were strictly in terms of service and price: I'm sorry. $30 for that large pie is ludicrous. The service was hit or miss. As I said, the hostess never appeared when we arrived. We had to ask the bartender where we could sit. Our waitress was nice, but slow. Our pizza took a while to arrive, which wouldn't have been a problem...if not for the fact that people around us that arrived after us were getting their pies BEFORE us. It also took a while to get our change back. It was near capacity, but not crowded.

The Meatballs here are better than the meatballs from The Meatball Shop. They were very flavorful. Each meatball is packed with garlic and the marinara sauce was perfect; chunky but not overly sweet. One order came with six meatballs and a generous scoop of ricotta cheese. These were to die for. The pies here are $30 each. That's a lot to ask for a pizza.

Would have preferred to just get 2 slices so I could try a couple flavors and not have a whole wedge but according to other reviews and their website I did not see slices being offered. Show up to get my pizza and they have slice options...ughhhh...ask if there is any way I could do that instead. They won't. Lame. So I head back to my hotel with my wedge and salad (for 1 that can easily feed 4). Pizza wedge is huge. Had 6 ""thin"" slices but while thin they are very heavy. I can eat a lot and I only had 2 slices with some salad before I had to stop. The pizza is not really pizza, it's more of a slice of dough with a lot of artichoke dip on top...Don't get me wrong, I love artichoke dip, but when I order pizza and when I come to NYC and want some New York pizza this is not what I am envisioning. The salad was not quite salad either it was some veggies with chunks of cheese on top...I can't believe I am saying this but enough with the cheese. To further upset me the box that my pizza wedge came in said that they have a Berkeley, CA location. Damn...guess I was totally jipped out of my NY pizza experience. Next time I will definitely be trying another pizza joint. One with actual tomato sauce and cheese on the pizza. Not dip!!Still I have to give them 3 stars because had I not such high expectations it was a good slice of artichoke dip ""pizza"".",Artichoke Basille’s Pizza & Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

We barged in anyway because we thought that was just so rude of him. As we were walking in the line to order, he kept talking smack and yelling at us and saying its ""state law"" to pass this line..keep in mind when we entered there were three people in line. So as my job, who works with Government stuff, I asked and said what law is this. He stuttered and looked me in the face pointed at me told me ""Shut your mouth."" I was in SHOCK, like is this how you treat customers here? I looked at him and said excuse me? And surely enough, he said it again only more aggressive, ""Shut your f****** mouth."" My jaw completely dropped and I immediately asked for the manager. And he was trying to act tough and smart with me.

The artichoke slice was creamy, yet there weren't enough artichoke chunks. :( The crab pizza was creamy and tasted almost like clam chowder. It had a good amount of crab meat. However, after a few bites, I got tired of the taste. My favorite was the vodka sicilian slice. The crust is twice baked as compared to the other pizzas. It was rich and flavorful from the vodka cream sauce. On the bright side, all three slices did have a good crunch to the crusts.

662,r24XtUtPccNiLBXMtiWPfA,Michael W.,3.0 star rating,"When you want a slice of pizza and do not give a damn about calories or how spiteful your stomach will be, then by all means, come to Artichoke Basille's. Located right in the heart of the Meatpacking District and next to the High Line is where you'll find this pizzeria. Now Artichoke Basille's is famous for, you guessed it, their artichoke pizza. Drunken NYU students and clubbers from near and far like to frequent this establishment late at night, and I can admit that I have been one of those people. Nonetheless, I have actually been here during the daytime sober, so that my opinion wouldn't be based on my drunken hunger rage.Anyhow, I came back here one afternoon after a workout at Equinox across the street. Probably not the best post workout food, but what the hell, it's right there. Artichoke Basille's is divided into two areas: dine-in and take-out/pizza by the slice. I wasn't about to sit down and eat a whole pizza pie, so I made my way to the express area. A slice of pizza will run you $5. I decided to go with their classic artichoke of course. The guy took my cash, heated up my slice, and in a matter of minutes, I was ready to rock. When you get your slice, you'll realize that this thing is pretty huge. No matter why drunkards love this place so much. Anyhow, there are two ways of eating this messy slice. You can opt for the old fashioned way, or use a fork and knife. I prefer just to go with the flow and eat it like a regular slice, but beware, this pizza can get messy. The pizza itself is topped with like an inch thick cream mixed in with artichoke bits. Eating this slice without making a complete mess is an art form in itself. Thankfully, the bread itself is much thicker than your typical thin slice. That way, it can actually hold all the stuff that's going on top of your slice. Taste-wise, it's actually not too bad when you have your initial couple bites. After a while though, you'll start to feel that heaviness in your stomach. I usually can eat quite a bit, but after 1 slice of artichoke pizza, I'm pretty stuffed. How people can manage to eat a whole pie boggles my mind.Artichoke Basille's is something that you have to try sometime during your stay in NYC. There's not many places that are known for artichoke pizza, for better or for worse. Just make sure to be either incredibly hungry, or else, just stick to one slice.",Artichoke Basille’s Pizza & Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

Super cold, didn't smile once. Ur the face of the restaurant U can atleast pretend to act personable and friendly. We got just slices which took over 10 minutes to come. Mind you, the slices are already made sitting out they just have to heat them. They got to the table and the artichoke was steaming hot but the Staten Island I ordered was luke warm but still somehow overheated and dry? Made no sense. However walking out I did see people with whole artichoke pies that looked hot and yummy so maybe I would suggest u get a whole pizza instead of slices.

Really hard. But I assure you, the 1 star rating is merited for this particular location.A while back, I came in on a weeknight as part of a group of three to dine in. It was a full house and we were at the top of the waitlist, given an estimated seating time of approximately 15 minutes. An hour later and we were still on call. Not only was the hostess inattentive to our party and unapologetic about giving us a dismally wrong waiting estimate, but she was also overly aggressive and rude when we checked in again regarding a table. As I happen to assistant manage a restaurant that turns many more tables in a night than this location and am often called upon to host, I have to say that I am empathetic and understanding toward anyone else in the service industry, but this woman was awful.When we were finally seated, our waitress was kind, but was equally inattentive and brought our order out practically 45 minutes after she had taken it down. Whether that is on the cooks or her is beyond me, but as a restaurant, you cannot expect guests to wait two hours before eating - it's ludicrous.The food, as good as it was, could in no way make up for the terrible experience my friends and I had here. I absolutely hate leaving no tip, but it would have been in bad conscience to have left one after such service (or lack thereof). I would not recommend this place to anyone and frequently go out of my way to avoid it when in the area.I happened to visit recently with a friend picking up a takeout order, only to find that the same hostess is still in the employ of the company.

We nabbed 3 stools at the bar and had a choice of either Pabst or Coors draft - we went with the draft. I am not a huge beer drinker at all but the Coors was nice and refreshing. Our pizza came out promptly after, a nice large Artichoke pie. The first slice was doughy and creamy - pretty satisfying after not having Artichoke for a long time. The second slice was definitely way too much for my stomach to handle as it began to make strange gurgling noises to warn me that a trip to the bathroom was soon to follow if I finished the slice. After 1.5 slices and 3/4 of the beer, I was stuffed...unhappily stuffed. Definitely shoulda just stuck to 1 slice because that ish is creamy overload!I ended up taking 2 slices home to the boify who also complained of the creaminess after consuming them.

The slices are large and SO GOODThe waitresses here are nice. One messed up our order and let us keep an extra 1/3 of a pie.Yes there are bouncers here - it is full of people making bad decisions.

No exceptions.The massive booths here are pretty awesome, and last time we had like 8 of us all sitting comfortably (granted half were tiny Asian girls, myself not included, since it was The Park, after all). I always point and laugh at all the fools waiting those crazy long lines for the East Village location that I live so close to, with no places to sit. And every dumbass crowds around the entrance of the West Village location, making it a battle just to push through.There's few things as satisfying as biting into a cheese-smoothered, one-inch-thich, size-of-two-of-your-faces, artichoke pizzas after a night of dancing too long in excruciating heels, and taking way too much advantage of your friend's bottle service. But I've never escaped without developing second degree burns on the roof of my mouth afterwards. Forewarning - blow on your pizza to cool faster! And patience really is a virtue!!Oh well. Whatever doesn't kill ya makes ya stronger, right? Also, this review is literally based on the artichoke pizza itself. Because, like, what else would you order besides the eponymous option?

After we spoke to a waitress there, she explained that wasn't actually a rule and helped us order a pie. Really nice girl.Eventually our tables did merge, but the same waitress told us we had to get rid of our pizza box before sitting down or else the other patrons might throw a shit fit. So weird.

And after eating two mammoth artichoke slices I can see why they look the way they do. Portion size aside, there's lots of good craftsmanship on display. The bottom gets very crisp and charred. The crust stays airy and not soggy, as so often happens with thick slices. They serve it extremely hot. All that said, the signature flavor combination isn't as pleasing to my palate as the better traditional pizzas, the best of all being Di Fara. Artichokes are pretty bland on their own. Here they're smothered in a mild, slightly garlicky bechamel sauce. It reminds me of hot artichoke dip I've had - as an appetizer, and generally shared. But a lot of thick white bread topped with a lot of thick white cream sauce is a bit heavy and monotonous for one person's lunch; I didn't eat dinner.

I told him that I was going to review the place honestly.  I also told him that I thought the Artichoke pizza was a tad bit too salty,  That did not stop me from eating two slices though.  TWO slices is a heck of a feat when you see how big that pizza pie is.  We ended up taking practically the whole pie home.  I had leftovers for days & it was juat as good thanks to my pizza stone.I tried the angry orchard beer for the first time.  I don't know what I was thinking because I don't like apple cider, champagne, or beer.  Angry orchard is a combination of all 3 so I hated it.  However, I would recommend trying it if you like any of those things stated above.I would definitely go back to try other pizzas.  Great service.

Here is why -We ordered the Sicilian pizza (which my husband loves) - we were told there would be at least twenty minute wait on that. Fair enough, they warned us ahead of time - we appreciated that. While waiting for that, we decided to order their famous stuffed artichoke. BIG Mistake - according to my husband, it felt like trying to swallow needles.  The artichoke was not edible at all, it was so hard to chew and forget about swallowing. We took few bites and left the rest. Next our pizza came - looked great! But once we started eating it, we noticed that it was burned for the most part. Their crust was SO hard that we weren't able to eat it. Normally, we love having the crust of any pizza, because that's what we like. Their crust on the other hand was so hard to eat. I was afraid it would crack my tooth, if I tried too hard. We barely finished three slices (two of us) as we were starving, we didn't even take the rest to go (we normally pack leftovers as we hate wasting food). But this was definitely not worth it. We did complain to our server about both the artichoke and the pizza and the manager was kind enough to take the artichoke off our bill and they gave us three slices of their famous artichoke slice. In short, service there was great but food was way overpriced and definitely not worth the $$$!

The artichoke pizza was basically cheesy artichoke dip pizza, but I had absolutely no problem with that. The crust was really interesting, almost flakey like a biscuit, but I liked it. The main thing here is that the portions are gigantic and really rich and filling. My friend and I shared my three slices (each slice is cut in half, so you really get six slices) and then were too full to even start his plate.

The original location has been my salvation on many a late night, in fact I was actually back there just a few weeks ago and it is still fantabulosous, but this location is absolutely awful.Our experience started out with a trip to the bar while we waited for a table. Including our rumps, the bar stools were filled, but I definitely wouldn't classify the bar tender as ""busy."" Yet, she found it appropriate to ignore us for a good 5 minutes or more, doing nothing of consequence. Perhaps it was because we were ladies or perhaps it was because she hasn't had anything to eat for a few weeks and was starting to lose her vision and didn't even see us. You'd think that the she would be attentive to those waiting for tables for the sake of getting additional tips, but what do I know?When the rest of our party arrived and when our table was made available, the abominable service continued. The waiter didn't seem that bad to start off, taking drink orders, etc. We went for an Artichoke pie ($28) and 2 quarter-pies ($12 each)... for those of you keeping track, we paid $52 for pizza for 7 people. Yeah. So we put in our food order and we waited.... And we waited... and a table of 6 dudes came in and sat near us... and we waited some more... and the table of 6 dudes got their artichoke pizza BEFORE we got ours!! At this point, we'd been waiting for over an hour. Everyone had finished their drinks and we were still without our pie. Where was our waiter? Who the heck knows! I think the staff could tell we were a bit perturbed and we ended up getting our pizza 15 minutes later. Every other artichoke pie we saw was oooey-gooey and ours wasn't. In fact, it was barely lukewarm, no melty cheese, nothing. So where the crap was our pizza when it was hot? I am so irritated that I staked my reputation on this place and that it was so terrible. On top of all of that garbage, they had the audacity to put a 20% tip on the bill! Are you kidding me?!

Kids got restless as we waited about 20 mins for the breadsticks and meatballs, but it was well worth the wait. The ""breadsticks"" was basically a whole pizza crust brushed with olive oil and topped with fresh garlic and grated cheese, scored into strips and served with a crock of fresh bubbling marinara. AWESOME. The meatballs followed and were A+++. Six baseball-sized meatballs in a large crock with dollops of ricotta in more of the awesome marinara. The meatballs were very flavorful and fresh-tasting. We quickly realized that we ordered WAY too much food. I had 1 and a 1/2 meatballs and maybe one full ""breadstick"" and I was almost full. The pizza arrived shortly after and was good but not great. The margarita pie was my and my wife's favorite (the kids didn't eat the pizza they were too busy with the meatballs and breadsticks), the Staten Island was ok - lots of mushy red onions under the cheeses and meatballs - eh. Very heavy too considering what was already on the table. The crab pizza was good but not great too - looked and tasted like canned/imitation crab which is just gross, VERY garlicky and rich with the ""crabmeat"" mixed with a cream sauce and more cheese.

781,-TDNECcns5_IdNfUw08aeA,Larry L.,5.0 star rating,"No matter how much I claim to be a true New Yorker, the city never ceases to surprise me with its plethora of hidden gems and ""must-eat"" restaurants. There are always places that one of my friends claims to be worth searching for, places that will amaze me with their unique signatures, places that are so consistently reliable in their delivery you will never be embarrassed to recommend.It's beyond safe to say Artichoke is one of these places.Artichoke is one of those places I constantly hear about from friends but never got the time to actually visit. I remember passing by the original Artichoke on my way to play basketball in Stuy Town; the line was always 20-30 deep each time and I wasn't about to stuff myself before running some full court games. Now I wish I did because if there was anything that could distract me from basketball, it would be the artichoke slice. I stumbled upon Chelsea's Artichoke after a night of heavy partying and drinking at the Park, which is nicely situated right around the corner. My friend, Donghao B., suggested grabbing a slice at the new establishment. I questioned the practicality since, as far as drunk food is concerned, I'm more accustomed to the lamb swarma from Mamoud's, budaejigae from Pocha32 or the mixed with white sauce and a little bit of hot sauce from the Famous Halal guys at 53rd and 6th. He led me around the corner to the slice window of Artichoke and with a mere five people on line, I was determined to complete my first purchase. I waited patiently until I was met by the bouncer... You know there is some serious demand for the goods when a slice window at a pizzeria employs a bouncer that could be working next door at 1Oak.As I was joined by my friend, Juliet C., I shelled out $15 for three slices, a premium to what's familiar but nothing outrageous given the size of a slice and its contents. I took my two slices* and walked around the corner with my friend. We plopped ourselves down on the bench and proceeded to enjoy our heaven-sent goods. To be honest, heaven-sent might be an understatement and this isn't even one of those moments where I embellish my memories. It was literally the best slice of pizza I have ever had.Allow me to go into more detail of the initial slice. The slices are huge and IMPOSSIBLE to hold with a New York grip (i.e. folded and stuffed sideways into your mouth). A rough analogy for the slice would liken it to a carefully crafted piece of art. The first bite sends a burst of creamy explosion at your taste buds. Imagine a rich and hearty cream of artichoke soup held together delicately on top of pizza dough by cheese ready to be punctured and devoured. Excuse my language, but when asked what my initial impression/description was I said - ""It's like a 69...because it was an orgasm in my mouth."" As Donghao, Juliet and I parked our butts on the nearby bench, we steadily ate ourselves into a trance with me munching on my slice and feeding Juliet intermittently. Simply put, it was one of the best drunk food adventures of my life and now I only have memories urging me to go back. I can't attest to the sit down menu or the restaurant during a day time, but with a clutch slice window ready to serve any club-goers late night appetite with delicious artichoke pizza, there really is no reason why this isn't a 5 star. Much appreciation to the owners and hope they spawn more offspring in different locations in the years to come.*There's a resell value to the pizza. I had bought three slices, but only ended up with two - why you ask? Well while I was leaving the window, a fellow club-go'er had asked to buy a slice from me at a premium of $8. With my entrepreneurial spirit and Juliet as my banker, I wasn't the type to turn down a quick little ROI.

While the kelvin slushies were a welcome drink in comparison to the heavy slice for $10 - it left us wanting something a bit more substantial. Like free water. I opted for the alcoholic versions and they were more a less a miss. The strawberry lemonade option tasted more like a virgin strawberry lemonade than a spiked strawberry lemonade. I even asked the waitress if it had alcohol in it just in case. The second option (don't really remember) had a heavier taste of tequila but that actually didn't even make it taste any better. I was not a fan of the wait staff either. They didn't come by to fill up our water - and generally left us to our own devices. Sometimes it's a plus/minus I guess. Would I come back to this location?

808,3yENVqru1TiVfPtSF4poEQ,John W.,5.0 star rating,"Forget the artichoke for a second.  It's a tasty hook, for sure, but it's just a hook.  The key, as Alton Brown would point out, to quality pizza is the CRUST.  AB's crust is FLAWLESS....to such a degree, I actually took a picture of it all by itself.  This is perfectly-cooked pizza--thick without being ""chewy"", thin without being ""crispy"".  The crust is perfectly-designed, and turns each slice into a tasty little canoe of flavor--the thickness is satisfying, while at the same time not overwhelming to the point where you need a knife and fork.  By all means, do try to eat this pizza with your hands--when you heft a slice, you'll give your wrists a tiny bit of exercise to eliminate at least 1% of the guilt, and you'll just feel so good about having such a chunk of deliciousness completely under your personal control.The signature artichoke pizza is a cheesy, creamy masterpiece (pro tip: make sure you have some leftover slices cause the flavors mesh even better the next day).  Also loved the crab pizza.  So happy that they offer you pizza in ""wedges"" if you don't want to get a whole pie (two wedges is more than enough pizza for two HUNGRY people, and could arguably feed three); this makes flavor experimentation and mixing & matching much easier.  You certainly pay more for pizza here than practically anywhere else, but there is simply not a detail that is skimped, or a corner that is cut.  This stuff is YUMMY with a capital Y.",Artichoke Basille’s Pizza & Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

I told the guy at the counter: ""Mate, I'm paying 5 dolars for that pizza, would you give me a bigger slice?"" I was agressive. The guy answers me words for words: ""Well you better go to Mac Donald.""Now, when a company dares to make people pay 5 dolars for a product that cost 20 cents to make, please train your staff to be something else than stupid monkeys.I took the slice, dropped it on my friend slice and said: ""Look, there is this much of my 5 dolars missing"". The guy did not give a fuck.I gave him the 5 dolars, took another plate, exploded the slice between the two plates and threw it on this jerk at the counter, which was a sort of lesson of hospitality. Then I walked out and felt bad...for giving him the 5 dolars, of course.I walked two blocks and found the same slices for 1 dolar, but I was not hungry anymore.So if you shit gold, please, feel free to have a 5 dolars pizza.

We ordered 2 pies; the bill was $90. Where is the money in between? Ok, tip and gratuity was included. That still doesn't add up. I called them. A ""manager"" responded with the reason is because late night prices are HIGHER. What is that?! What food establishment changes the prices to unbeknownst customers? He told me that the pies were $35 each at some point in the past, and the registers are still generating higher prices. What kind of bs answer is that? If it's in the past, why hasn't anything been changed? And if your menu says one thing, why is the bill another?The ""manager"" took down my CC info and told me he can issue the $10 difference back to my card. it has been over 7 business days, and though they were quick to charge the overpriced bill that immediate Sunday, they have not refunded my account even after 1.5 weeks on the phone with them.Terrible food, overhyped, and a scam restaurant!

The topping is super creamy and flavorful.  The crust is really thick but essential to stand up to the toppings.  I've heard great things about the crab pizza as well. My big complaint about Artichoke is I think the employees are some dudes with some serious tudes. I was there for lunch on a Friday around 1:30.  The restaurant was not crowded but the staff had most certainly woken up on the wrong side of the bed.  Everything we asked for (like a cup of water for example ) seemed like a huge deal. The atmosphere is nice.  You order in the back by the counter which seems a little out of place. You can also order at the bar. Personally I prefer the other Artichoke even though there is basically no seating because I find the staff much more pleasant and the system of ordering is clearer.  Word of warning,  the stools are really challenging to sit on.  Lets just say the building is sloped because I could not stay on my stool without consistently falling off.

The pizza here is decent; for me, however, I'm not a big fan of heavy pizza. Its similar to a Chicago pizza except its a thinner dough but more ingredients on top. The artichoke pizza is like a spinach cream poured on top of a pizza dough. Thick, creamy, and heavy. We got the meatball parm pizza, which had more flavor and was lighter and had big chunks of meatball in it. We used a groupon for Artichoke: 4 beers and 1 pizza ($58 dollar value) for only $19 price which was a great deal. The restaurant itself is great - had a brooklyn feel to it (casual and laid back).

I've always wanted to try it because I've heard good things, and I finally got my chance last night when I was craving pizza after a night of drinking. Artichoke has excellent real estate as they are located next door to two busy and popular nightspots. The line was long since the overflow of people from the nightspots heads over to Artichoke to satisfy their drunk munchies or continue drinking since Artichoke has a bar as well ... or both.The wait was 5-10 minutes mainly because drunk people are slow, and also because Artichoke was baking fresh pies. I ordered an artichoke slice since that's what they're known for after all. It was a thick huge slice that required two paper plates to support. Each slice is $5, and I guess it's worth it considering how big it is.This is NOT classic New York style pizza. The crust is thick and is a few inches deep with dough. The entire slice tasted like a spoonful of creamy chowder and was very cheesy. Normally, everything tastes amazing when you're drunk, but I was not impressed by this artichoke slice. I actually much prefer the creamy spinach pizza at Abitino's. Since the slice was ginormous, I needed to get a box to take my leftovers home. I didn't want to wait in long for an insane period of time just for a simple box. I started to wait in line because a lot of people were crowded around the cashier, and I couldn't peep over them to ask, so I asked the guys behind the counter who were just standing idly if they had a box, and they pointed at the cashier. You seriously can't walk over to the cashier and just give it to me? It takes 5 seconds, and you're not busy doing anything else! When the group left the counter, I pounced on the opportunity to ask for a box, but the cashier was too busy flirting/fighting with the drunk girls and ignoring that anyone was in line behind them. It took way too long for something that honestly should've taken 5 seconds.Not impressed by their namesake pizza, but I did think that their other flavors were intriguing and was interested in trying them. I just wish that the crust wasn't so thick, and the people who worked here were more efficient.",Artichoke Basille’s Pizza & Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

I had heard of the legend of the artichoke pizza a few years ago and visited the original in the East Village and was absolutely amazed. I was in heaven after waiting for close to an hour for my slice, savoring each bite of pizza that tasted like spinach and artichoke dip. I couldn't believe what they had created. It was pure genius. Fast forward 2 years later to the Chelsea location and what a disappointment. My fond memories were robbed in one big swoop. We ordered 2 pizza wedges, one third of a pizza for only $12 each. One of course was the namesake artichoke and the other, the white. Both were a soupy, sloppy mess. So greasy and oily and unappetizing. Made it difficult to eat. Needed a stack of napkins. If this was my first time I would never go back. I love pizza, but they somehow managed to turn it into a disaster. I hope it was an off night, but I suspect they haven't adopted well to managing now 3 locations. The seating is tight and the tables are situated almost as if you were on a ship that was tilted to the right side. Cramped dining experience. They have a decent beer selection. They gave us a sample of their Artichoke beer which is flavored with artichoke. Sounds nasty, but wasn't as bad as you would think. Not sure I could drink a whole pint of one though. The 3 stars are favorable because of my first life changing experience at the original on 14th. I will have to go back to that one for reassurance that they haven't screwed up such a masterpiece.

I'll check on it for you.  The pizza came 5min later.  The manager on duty came by to ask if the pizza was worth the wait.  I'm not sure that was such a good idea; it almost felt like he was digging into us, but we decided to take it as a good gesture.  Both of us were more than happy to have been eating anything at that point, but the pie was not worth the wait.Most of the time when something goes wrong at a restaurant, it is most definitely not the server's fault.  They don't control the quality of the food, the don't control what it tastes like, all they can do is take your order, try to be attentive, and bring you your food.  It's not fair to them for frustrations to be piled upon them.  This is not one of those instances though.  If the vodka pie truly does take 45min to make, that's a pertinent detail I think any diner ordering the pie would like to know.  I'm just a hungry patron; my expertise is not in the cooking time of pizza pies.  I have to rely on my waitress to keep me informed of things that could sway me one way or the other.  That was not done here.Both my friend and I kept our cool and didn't make a fuss.  We left a 20% tip, which I felt was generous and undeserved, but considering we won't be returning I see it as a parting gift.Lessons learned:1- If you go to this Artichoke (because I've had good experiences at the others) make sure you do not go while you're hungry.2- Be prepared to pay top dollar for good pizza (not great pizza.)",Artichoke Basille’s Pizza & Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

In the end, our party of 3 was unable to choke down this hulking monstrosity of creamy dense deliciousness. Each slice was a thick piece of rich buttery cream sauce, mozzarella and pecorino romano cheese riddled with tender artichoke hearts and spinach. Every sumptuous bite filled you with smooth velvety goodness as slick oil runs down your chin. Some people look at the puddles of fatty  grease on the surface of their plate with disdain, I however see these pools of succulent pizza juices as gluttonous opportunity. I have no qualms dipping my pizza crust in the delicious fatty oil. This sinfully unwholesome meal is particularly excellent when washed down with a cold draft of Guinness.

Even with the Groupon I would not recommend coming here. Mind you we are a group in our mid twenties to early thirties and respectful; we were not loud or rude to warrant such poor service so just keep this in mind.Our group of five showed up around 8:30 and the place was jammed. We were told a half hour for a table however it took 40 minutes. If you are in a group of more than two people you shoud NOT come here; they only have about two tables that seem to sit more than two people. They don't even hold any two person tables to push them together if you have a group larger than two. A few groups of two people jumped us in line as we were held for one of these larger tables. I assume they want you to go to the bar and spend money there on their very expensive beer list. $5 for a pbr in a can is unacceptable. But there was no room there either as some people resorted to eating at the bar due to the issues with the tables.We finally sat and were left at the table for fifteen minutes before someone came to give us menu's. We were in the booth at the end and I was on a chair out in the aisle. The chair seat was busted through so it felt like I was sitting on a bucket the whole while. Our waiter was very friendly; it wasn't his fault as the short hostess should have been experienced enough to give menu's when she seats people. I don't even know why they keep her here as she seems like she brings only confusion to an already crowded and difficult situation in this restaurant. The organization in this place is non existant. When we informed our waiter we had a groupon he was very friendly and said it was no problem that only PBR and bud light were Groupon Beers. We ordered garlic sticks and the crab pie, four $5 PBR's (ouch) and a sam seasonal for our fifth person. No food arrived at our table for another 40 minutes! Were they expecting us to pound our $5 PBS to pump up our tab? One would think they would be rushing to turn the table as we saw the whole while the next party of more than 2 people was waiting for our table. Sorry next group.The garlic sticks were plain and flavorless, no garlic, they were plain bread sticks with a pan of sauce which was also flavorless. Do they not know how to use herbs? If all you know as sauce is RAGU then you may think this is what sauce should taste like but take it from me... this ain't sauce baby!. The crab pie came out very soon after the appetizer (bad coordination for food timing) it was ""okay"". Some at our table liked it but I don't consider it real NY pizza. After the long wait the pie was only warm. My slice seemed a bit cold. The couple next to us spilled their pizza as the small stands they sit the pizza tray on isn't big enough to stabilize the tray. Half way into our pie we also tipped our pizza for the same reason. How many times does this have to happen before management buys the proper stands? are they not afraid someone could burn themselves on hot sauce... oh wait maybe that's why the pies are not served hot. :PAll in all this was on of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. Poor organization, very expensive prices for what you get, and generally not an enjoyable time.

Now I was told it was ""Soupy"" by my friend, and I'm gonna be honest, ""Soupy"" doesn't sound right to me, but boy was I wrong. It was a thick, and large slice of pizza that had to be served on two plates!

We went here after going to Chelsea Market and was a great rescue for us from the rain onslaught.I don't know why, but it didn't fully occur to me just how huge an 18"" pizza was until it was in front of me. Holy crap. But let me start from the beginning.We were starving, so once we got inside we ordered a bottle of sauvignon blanc, and we also got garlic sticks. Being starving and that we were three people, we also ordered the artichoke pizza.Wow.So obviously we got the garlic sticks before the pizza, and we totally snarfed it. The wine was also great. But there was something just special about the tomato sauce that was served with the garlic sticks - I think all of us were just using the garlic sticks to take as much sauce as possible. But then the pizza arrived, and I realized how unwise it was for us to order both.Because my boyfriend is a champ, he managed to eat four freaking pieces of that pizza. My friend and I only managed one and a half before calling it quits. But that artichoke pizza is the richest and most ridiculous pizza I think I've ever tasted. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious. But between all the cream, cheese, artichokes, and very thick crust, it was like I could actually feel my arteries slowly clogging with each bite.

Hostess took our name while we waited at the bar. Forgot about us, never called us. Realized there were suddenly lots of empty tables and asked again to be seated. Hostess/waitress sullenly led us to a table. Only perked up slightly when one of my tablemates feebly flirted with her. She asked us three times if we had settled our bar tab. We had. Asked if we wanted more drinks, we didn't. Did not take our order. Disappeared. Had to ask for cutlery and plates when the food arrived. Asked for black pepper for the salad. Was told they didn't have any. My quizzical expression encouraged a friendly bus person to go and seek out this rare and coveted restaurant condiment and I was finally rewarded with a small, ketchup-sized paper cup of ground black pepper. Now, on to the $30 pizzas. Crusts of pizza way over done. Not chewy, not ""foldable"" (as another reviewer commented). Sicilian pie: same over baked crust, school cafeteria, sugary tomato sauce, minuscule amount of cheese. In short, bad. Artichoke pie: Too much creamy stuff! ""Rich,"" but not in a good way. I felt like I was lapping up Campbell's Cream of Whatever soup poured over a few artichokes, again, on the overdone crust.

By the way, the artichoke beer is good after the first surprising sip.Since a member of our party was lactose intolerant, the house special artichoke pizza -- essentially, spinach artichoke dip on a crust piled high with cheese -- seemed like a bad idea. The table next to us had ordered the crab pizza -- crab dip on a crust piled high with cheese -- and that looked a little rich and gloopy for our tastes. We settled on the meatball pizza. It was tasty but with the crust dripping with butter and the pound of cheese covering the pizza, we were only able to eat a slice each before feeling uncomfortably full. At $30 a pizza, Artichoke is way more expensive than a normal delivery pizza place and slightly more expensive than other sit down pizza joints.

969,wsm7tIbcxn9Qq3_OfUKJPA,Briana M.,1.0 star rating,"Disgusting. Disgusting. I had heard their artichoke pizza was delicious, akin to artichoke spinach dip on a pie. I like that dip, so why wouldn't I like that pizza? What I was presented was enough to make me feel sick. For the first time in my life, I did not finish a slice of pizza. This is unbelievably, especially given the fact that it was about 3:30 am and I was completely obliterated. I found the slice to be APPALLING. It was like somebody dumped fatty, greasy flavorless sludge on my pizza. I wanted to puke. The only saving grace of the meal was the marinara that accompanied my bread sticks. I tried to remedy the situation by dipping the nasty pizza into the tangy sauce, but it didn't help. I'm seriously gagging here. I have to stop writing/thinking about this abomination. I might sound dramatic, but seriously. I can eat anything when wasted. This is BAD.",Artichoke Basille’s Pizza & Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

The breadsticks came with this huge thing of warm sauce that tasted fresh. I was really pleased with the quantity of breadsticks and sauce.The pizza was really cheesy and gooey in all the right ways. I thought I would hate it because I don't really ""get"" artichokes...they don't have enough of a taste for me, but I LOVED this pizza. It was definitely overpriced though, for 2/3 of it costing $15. But it was still worth every penny because it was mouthwateringly delicious and I'm craving it as I type this review.",Artichoke Basille’s Pizza & Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

You can't come here and not have the Artichoke slice (I've been here like 15 times and seem to always get it). These pizzas are worth your money since the slices are huge and DELICIOUS. Anyone giving this place a bad review is crazy, just saying.. They also have a full bar which is always a plus!

The artichoke slice was not gooy, or rich. It was also pretty thick on the dough. What gives???Stick with the one on 14th street if possible. but DONT go to the one on mcdougal.

977,OHaP002-G6t9bbFmeJYXig,Nick W.,2.0 star rating,"The only thing ""good"" about my visit to Artichoke Pizza was that we went on Good Friday. The guy in the back slinging slices was a jerk.. Annoyed at our presence on this quiet afternoon. The $5 slice of pizza sat in my stomach like a cinder block. I really was hoping that this would be my new favorite pizza place, but with service like this, who would come back? Lucky for them they are off the high line, so they can give crappy service and sell overpriced pizza to the mass of tourists that will inevitably come their way. With this steady stream of unsuspecting victims constantly pouring in, I am guessing they will continue to treat their customers like they are one-time visitors.Several hours later, everyone in my party regretted eating there. I know I felt like sticking a couple fingers down my throat. We planned on going out that night, but then no one wanted to leave the house because we all felt so gross.",Artichoke Basille’s Pizza & Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"
