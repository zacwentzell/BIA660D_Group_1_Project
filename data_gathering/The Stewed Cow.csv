1,XZIAEE2ZN6yxESKzXiZRqQ,Auggie L.,3.0 star rating,"Went for Hudson Restaurant Week DinnerFood - 5/5. Steak tacos had flavor with lots of crunch coming from the cabbage. Brisket was tender and went well with the crispy tater tot hash and juicy Texas greens. The plating was pretty questionable though as everything was piled on top of each other on a small plate. It also could've used some more BBQ sauce. Warm cookie dough was rich and sweet with the ice cream adding that creamy goodness.Service - 1/5. Slow. Very, very slow. I must have waited 30 minutes between courses. I try my best to be patient but this was too much and it didn't help that no one explained why there was such a delay for the food.Value - 3/5. The food is good and a three course dinner for $20 is a great deal.

Happy hour to be exact. Its small, dark, but beautiful inside. The decor is themed and perfect for what seems to be a southern/texas/bourbon bar. A real nice perk is the fact that they had happy hour until about 9 pm! sweet!. this included half off drafts, wine glasses and about 5 different half off apps. This is not the best place for the non-meat eaters. The must gets are the veggie burger slider for sure. for $4, youll get a perfectly grilled mini veggie burger. the bun is so cute, along with the lil burger itself. unlike other veggie burgers, it doesnt fall apart at all & it tastes great! the sauce on top was refreshing and i loved the touch of corn that was in the patte itself. Next to that, if you like chicken get the chicken quesadilla. this really filled me up. its messy so beware!. the buffalo calamari was a nice , unique attempt but didnt have much flavor in my book. what did have flavor was that cajun mayo. i need the recipe for that---throw this stuff on anything my friends!beer selection wasnt too impressive to be honest, they really only had one that caught my eye. service was great, and overall, i enjoyed my time here.",The Stewed Cow,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

The drinks did take a while to come to us, which I'm not sure why since there really weren't that many people there. The sangrias could've been mixed better and virtually no fruit but they were OK. We both had steak and eggs, very good but portions were a tad small. Also, not sure why everyone was raving about the pastry basket-we were given two small cold pieces cornbread and two pieces of some cake? lol I could've went without.

This bar isn't on our typical route (it's not by all the hustle and bustle) but it's worth going out of your way for. When we sat down at the bar, the sweet bartender immediately brought us menus and took our drink orders. I personally don't love scotch or whiskey so I ordered an Angry Orchard, which came in a homey mason jar. We went to the bar at about 6:30 on a Monday so it was prime happy hour, which meant certain apps were half off. I ended up getting the spinach dip (half off) and the honey-glazed salmon and my boyfriend got the chili (also half off). I've never been so impressed with pub food before. The salmon was perfectly cooked and lathered in a sweet honey sauce, accompanied by a sweet potato mash and Brussels sprouts. The spinach dip wasn't overwhelmed by cheese at all and was huge for the price--it could've been a meal in itself!

Now, onto the entrees: I had the road kill platter - brisket, bacon, scrambled eggs on 'biscuits.' The only thing was, it wasn't a real biscuit, it was what seemed to be a slider bun. That being said, it was still great because it was heavily toasted. My bf had the cowboy sandwich. You really can't go wrong with a sandwich made with texas toast. Dem fries tho, THE BEST EVER!

It's great to have a staff that actually can recommend the right spirit for the flavors you enjoy.In addition we had the Texas Barn Burger and wings both were great and I like can't feel my face spicy and that's really the first time I've had a burger on the border of that.

Nothing really too special except for the prohibition pig cocktail (bacon bourbon, apple liquor, lemon juice) I had which was very interesting. My friend an I ordered as an appetizer the spicy pimento crab dip. I love crab dip..but this crab dip was hmm very different. It was really thin/liquidy. It should be a little more thick, it was hard to scoop up. The flavor was there though, just not the consistency. It was served with pita chips which I guessed were homemade, and they were hard as a rock, could chip a tooth with those things haha. As my entree I ordered the southwestern burger (topped with cheddar, avocado, Chipotle lime vinegrette ) it was very tasty. I chose a side of tater tots, your pretty average frozen tots, not homemade. As my first drink I had a beer, the Brooklyn sorachie ace saison. I was feeling the flavor but sadly it might have been to carbonated and hoppy for me, it gave me heartburn and the only bloat gas I must have burped a hundred times haha, but as far as that beer they can't help it, they didn't make it. So after a couple of hours and I finally felt better , then ordered my cocktail. The prohibition pig as I stated above. It has a smokey bacon flavor to it at first but when I stirred it well then I could taste the apple liquor. The place seemed to be busy and packed for a couple of hours and then it emptied out pretty quickly around midnight..it was strange. The DJ plays random music, I don't know maybe it's just me but I'm not a fan of hip hop, and then the going back and forth from that to country music was odd.

The drinks are pretty good - especially the manmosa, which had vodka and is stronger than the mimosa. Yum. Definitely would recommend. The food is alright, nothing special. It's cool they have brunch - it's nice if you live nearby, but I wouldn't make the trek here just for the food if I didn't live close. If you're looking for the boozy brunch experience, you can probably find places more worth your money in NYC, just a short train ride away.

If you're really trying to booze up your brunch, just order a few more manmosas or a bunch of the beers they have on draft :)Night: They have a mechanical bull. Pretty sure it's the only place in Hoboken you can find one of these. It's pretty fun if you're in the mood for a more adventurous sort of night. Despite the bull, The Stewed Cow has a pretty low key, chill vibe.

No dessert.Everything was fine, came out hot, tasted as described above. The only thing was that they were pretty strict about the happy hour time (started at 7p) and made us wait until then in order to get the deals.

The place itself wasn't too crowded and they played Top 40 music (I was pretty drunk, don't take my word on what music they played). Their saving grace has to be the mechanical bull. That was SO FUN, especially when you're drunk. It was my first time riding it and it was tough. And I was in a dress. I should've opted out, but I've always wanted to ride a bull, so what the hell? Plus, I was drunk. In a dress? Not a problem.Overall, fun place, but I don't think I'll be back here any time soon.

I alternate between the cowboy sandwich (sausage, egg, and cheese with a jalapeno ranch sauce between Texas toast slices) and the skirt steak sandwich (juicy skirt steak cooked to your liking *medium rare*, egg, cheese, crispy onion straws, and spicy mayo). I substitute cheddar cheese on both sandwiches. They are both extremely delicious and filling.Last time I was there, they had changed their fries though, which was a big disappointment to me. I used to love their big steak fries, and now they have seasoned curly fries. Which, I know, most people probably prefer - but not me.

Each time has had a varying experience, some good, some still crap.I will say this, the food is pretty decent, the burgers are good and the skirt steak sandwich is excellent. And they have finally seemed to master what an ""over hard"" egg means. I still wouldn't come back here for brunch however. It just was so bad the first time and not worth the money when there are many options in town. The burgers are all decent, the turkey burger was ok. Again, the brunch...skip it. The steak fries are generic but tasty. The service is spotty, usually the bar is your best bet before 9pm, it's usually slower and the bartenders are attentive. Each time we've had table service the waitresses have this ""I hate my job/boyfriend/school/life attitude and it's usually just really bad. The couple times we've eaten outside the service has been excellent, maybe the fresh air makes it better? One time I was there with a couple people and we were drinking at a table and the manager (the bald guy always in a plaid shirt), asked us to leave so he can have the table for people. Dude, we're spending money, now we are going to stop spending money. He did buy us a round of drinks because I think he realized that was a horribly stupid move that was. I didn't go back for awhile after that. The happy hour specials are ho-hum with half off beers usually and some kinda bourbon special. No specials on Sundays...so don't come here to watch a game. Yuenglings and Coors Light on a regular night are $5, that's just ridiculous for a small bar waaay downtown away from everything else. Sorry kids, wouldn't come here for several drinks...have you tasted coors light? You know it's not worth 5 bucks right? It is still a bro bar on a Friday/Saturday night. That isn't going to change until they get rid of the bull, which if anyone watches Bar Rescue each seat is work 10k a year, that bull takes up precious real estate.

I came on a Sunday around 1pm and the place was pretty crowded, but not unbearable. She said there would be a wait for 2 and that we could wait at the bar, which I thought was odd as there was a 4 top table available right next to the bar...but then she came back and said we could sit. I started off with their Shipyard on tap, which was awesome. It tasted like a delicious winter stout. The menu itself was rather limited, which was disappointing. They had french toast, omelets, chicken or beef empanadas, burgers, a few other items and a make your salad option where you you can pick a lettuce, fruit, nuts, cheese, and salad dressing. They did however, also have a $20 bunch deal where you pick one food option, and it comes with 2 mimosas (or other breakfast related cocktails) and some muffins for the table. We didn't do that. I had a spinach salad with strawberries, walnuts, blue cheese & grilled chicken in balsamic dressing, which tasted a lot like straight balsamic vinegar, but hey, it was probably healthy. He forgot my blue cheese the first time around, so I asked him to bring some over, which he did. Decent service overall. My salad was okay, nothing special. Kinda wish they had a lunch/dinner menu available when we arrived. Oh well. Moving on, they give you a basket of muffins and breads and some kind of creamy sauce that you can put on the muffins, instead of butter. Interesting. After my Shipyard, I decided to drive the waiter crazy and asked him to give me two different samples of beers, and I would just order one of them. The one beer I had was excellent, it tasted like a Lager aged in Bourbon barrels or something similar. Delish. They have an excellent selection of whiskeys, ryes and bottled beer, as well as a fun selection of craft beers and it's awesome to watch football here as they have a ton of tvs. I have been here when people were riding the bull too, which is always fun on a Friday or Saturday night. I like the place a lot more than Gaslight, it's new, fun and reminds me of being in Texas. They had promo girls there on the Sunday I went giving out free shots of Jim Beam, super nice girls.

The space is long and narrow, so watch out for congestion in the front. The tv's kind of kill the ambience on a Saturday night but I can see how they're necessary during games. The boys had some beers they seemed happy with (not just Bud lites) and I had two separate drinks with club soda that tasted like tonic.

Just don't, unless you want to contemplate shooting yourself in the face or having an appetizer. The nachos were well...Let me say, not nachos. They were potato chips with cheese whiz. Who on God's green earth has ever eaten nachos made of potato chips? Bad cooks, that's who. And cheese whiz? Only Philadelphians with a hankering for a cheesesteak put cheese whiz on anything. Oh, and people in soup kitchens. And not only that, there was no salsa, I think I literally counted one scallion on the plate, and the brisket was budget. Self respect is not something this chef has.Now for the wings. What can I say? If one could imagine the most basic, baseless crud on earth it wouldn't begin to define these wings. Basically someone found the most measly wings from premie hatchlings and deep fried them for less than 30 seconds, after which they decided it would be an insatiably good idea to pour Aunt Jamima pancake syrup all over them.I wish I could say that was it, but I've run out of time and patience.

I appreciate that on a busy football day they accommodated the large group I was with as it trickled in randomly. But the service blew. It was over an hour before we flagged somebody down to actually order our entrees, and we couldn't have the other brunchy accoutrements until we did that. Additionally, a server spilled my water all over me - luckily not much of it got on my iPhone - and all I got was a ton of napkins and a hasty apology.

Often we bring our young daughter along as well (they recently got high chairs that work at bar tables and they're awesome).That being said, this is *by far* our favorite bar in town. A nice, rotating selection of craft beers. Really tasty bar food that's good for a snack or for a full-on dinner (I think we've tried all of the appetizers at this point and I can't recall one we didn't enjoy). Easily the best happy hour I'm aware of (half-off beer/wine weekdays from 5-8pm I believe). A great music selection that's not played at a stupid loud volume.

128,egnNuORhWl3cB0oRhVKPlQ,Jennifer R.,3.0 star rating,"We came here tonight with a few friends to take my boyfriend out for a birthday dinner. I always like Gaslight, although I felt like the food was going downhill towards the end, so I was excited to see what the new place had in store. It's definitely...a bar. I know that seems obvious, but I did feel like the previous establishment had a bit more of a restaurant feel, especially with the spacious dining area in the back. That's been replaced by the bull, so there's really not much space for dining. We arrived around 8ish on a Sunday, and it was actually quite packed and LOUD! I was a little turned off at first, but it did empty out a little as the night went on. Definitely not the kind of place to enjoy a quiet meal; also not the most comfortable.The food is actually pretty good. The menu and drink selections certainly reflect the theme, and it's decently priced, although some of the specialty drinks may cost more than you're used to. We got quite a sampling betweens our apps and entrees: cheesy tots, buffalo calamari, wings, burgers, steak sandwiches, salads, and the short rib entree. No complaints about the food, and we were all satisfied. The kitchen closed at 9 on Sunday (not sure if this is every night) and a crowd started rolling in around 9:30, presumably for the bull. I wouldn't make this a regular stop, but it's a nice alternative to typical Hoboken bar food.",The Stewed Cow,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

131,F-gC4l0oWu1CT5h8Ynzq9w,R. F.,4.0 star rating,"Besides the fact that I live super close by, one thing keeps me coming back to this bar and makes me want to give it one more star. No, it's not the modern country music, the mechanical bull, or the lack of seating on weekends. Whiskey. You would be hard pressed to find a better selection outside of Bourbon county. Over the past couple months, it's become a much more chill place, and I was super happy to geek out with one of the managers about the whiskeys and bourbons they had in stock and the ones that were coming soon. They have a little ways to go in terms of forming their identity as a great whiskey bar versus being a popular NJ d**che-haven like a lot of other cool bars in Hoboken, but I've got my hopes!update: Weekday nights are the way to go here if you're coming for the whiskey selection.

The meals are very filling especially since they give you a little bowl of oatmeal and some pastries  before your meal. Everything is very yummy.

134,FLsECwL1OxZuwxPS7yQsgg,Sean I.,4.0 star rating,"I was out here for a few drinks and a bite to eat on a Saturday night. I will give everything about the bar a thumbs up. Good beer & whisky selection was the first thing to grab my attention. One of the problems with bars in Hoboken is that some haven't gotten past the idea that you need more than 5 beers on tap (Coors/Bud Light, Guinness, Blue Moon, Stella & Yuengling are the ""standards"" you see in every bar). They have quite a few drafts and bottled beers and get that extra 'star' from me because of that.I tried the grilled chicken club sandwich off the menu. It came on a roll, and was quite good actually. They serve thick steak fries - not my personal favorite, but have to say they were pretty tasty. My friend had a salad, and loved that she could pick & choose what to put over her greens.Downside is the size, it can get very cramped on a busy night, the bar is long and there simply isn't a lot of room to maneuver. Loses a star because of that.Yes, the 'elephant in the room' is the mechanical bull. Its in the corner/back of the bar and certainly is unique - but honestly the bar can easily get rid of the bull. It really is more of a funny extra, but to me the bar would be best served to get rid of it and add more seating. The Stewed Cow has good food, a good bar selection and is a very much welcome addition to the neighborhood considering what was there before it.",The Stewed Cow,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

So it was crowded and I'm sure all the workers were exhausted.There weren't any tables available, and when we inquired about a table, we were told it would be from 15 minutes to some indeterminate time for a table. Luckily, I kept my eyes open and jumped on one when it opened up ten minutes later.I had the Mule Kicker (tasty) and the Stewed Punch (even tastier), and I modified the club sandwich to be a BLT. I really enjoyed the roll, and the sandwich was good. The menu says that it comes with fried potatoes, but apparently all the potatoes had been served for the evening, so it ended up coming (unannounced) with a salad that was overly dressed.My boyfriend loves traditional sazeracs and was thrilled to see one offered in Hoboken. They put their own spin on the Rosie the Heifer Sazerac, which he enjoyed. He thought the Better With Bacon Burger was in the Top 5 Burgers of Hoboken (Brass Rail, O'Neills, Zack's, Pourhouse).The service wasn't quite there yet, but given the day and the newness of the restaurant, I'm willing to give it a pass.

139,AruZ5DLvCHVHdXSd4PZBHw,Krista G.,3.0 star rating,"I've been to The Stewed Cow twice since its opening earlier this month.  The first time was for dinner on Sunday evening during their opening weekend.  They have an interesting cocktail selection, and it was nice to see that my friend's wine was happy hour-priced even on Sunday.  Everyone enjoyed their food (friends both had burgers, I had the short rib sandwich).  It was obvious that there were still some service kinks to work out, however - for example, my friend asked for the Tavern (potato) Chips with her burger, and a confused food runner brought her a basket of tortilla chips.  They also had a problem with one of the printers in their kitchen, so it took quite some time for our food to arrive.  But I feel like you have to expect some bumps in the road when a place first opens, so I knew I would give this place a second chance.I returned for Sunday brunch about 2 weeks later, and again really enjoyed the food.  Like its predecessor, Gaslight, The Stewed Cow offers a prix-fixe brunch for $20 which includes 2 brunch cocktails and a small basket of pastries.  The pastries were kind of bleh - they looked like someone had dumped some leftover Entenmann's danish and muffins in a basket.  But both the steak and eggs and the ""bacon and eggs"" entrees were delicious.  The ""bacon"" was actually pork belly, which was tasty and unusual to see on a brunch menu.Service at brunch was improved - we actually had the same waitress that I had the first night, and although she still seemed a little green, she was pleasant and attentive and our food came out much quicker this time.The atmosphere is pretty laid back, even when it's crowded - and it seems to cater to an older crowd, which is nice when you've decided that places like Green Rock, McSwiggan's and the like have permanently found their way onto your Murtaugh list.I'll be coming back to this place...especially to try their cranberry white whiskey.",The Stewed Cow,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

143,bCbC32krFjAS98FU70DMqg,Leslie B.,3.0 star rating,"Been waiting anxiously to see what would be occupying the old Gaslight and was pleasantly surprised to see a Whiskey Bar...a differrent theme that is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. The three stars is for the growing pains that the bar / restaurant is still going through (they opened last Friday so they need time to get into the rhythm).  For a Monday night it was a good crowd and there were many just stopping in out of curiosity.   We had a seat right near the Host who is chatty but not overbearing.  He did mention the music and that they were still tweaking the playlist....going for classic rock, southern rock, country vibe.  He mentioned the DJ that  Ashley L. and S B. mentioned and that it was a huge mistake and once their obligation this weekend to him is done, it's DONE!!  So fear not...Snooki and the Situation will not be frequenting the Stewed Cow.Onto the food, very good but again, the servers and the kitchen need to get into a groove.   We started with the Buffalo Calamari.  Delicious.  The calamari is definitely fresh not frozen, not chewy.  The breading is your typical pub breading for calamari, not to heavy though, not all breading and no fish.   The amount of buffalo sauce was spot on as was the sprinkle of crumbled blue cheese.   The portion of the appy was more than enough for 2 and with their special on Monday of 1/2 price apps from 7pm - Close, it's a steal.   Which is good if you are meeting a few friends for drinks and want to have a bite...you can split something and it will help to offset the cost of your premium drinks.   When our calamari was brought to our table our waitress came by for dinner order, she never mentioned the specials (if any) or the Stew of the Day.  Our main meal was fish tacos and the seared Ahi Tuna (an odd choice for this place as it's definitely a man menu with Beef, Beef, Beef).  Heading out on vacation in a few days and trying to make 'healthy' choices...lol (you'll find later in the review that this is all negated wth dessert!).   Both our entrees were good and although my meal tasted great it didn't fully didn't fully match the description on the menu.  Needless to say, still tasty and I cleaned my plate. Onto dessert....we went with the Warm Cookie Dough and Vanilla Ice Cream.    The waitress described this as different than what you would think.  A scoop of ice cream with the warmed dough on top (basically it dough brought to a safe temp but still gooey and ooey)....it also takes about 20 minutes to prepare.  What came out was a partially cooked cookie in a skillet (which is piping hot and burned myself on twice) with a scoop of either choc chip ice cream or cookie dough ice cream.  Again...an orgasm inducing delicious treat but not what is described on the menu. I will definitely be back, these are definite issues that are opening up pangs and can be fixed.   My recommendations are have the chef prepare everything on the menu for the staff so they can see how it should be prepared and they can taste it so when a customer asks about something they have the knowledge.   Also, please have the over exuberant bus boy clear dishes all at once, if I'm still eating you should be clearing plates from the others around me.  As for the mechanical bull, use it for the next 8 months or so to attract the crowds, then get rid of it to make more space for tables...you're gonna need it.",The Stewed Cow,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

This took the place of Gaslight, my beloved Sunday brunch spot during football season, so I wanted to give it a try in preparation for checking it out once fall hits. The decor is pretty cute, very western-styled with rope-railings and a saloon-like atmosphere. Wasn't too crowded, which I like a lot and there were plenty of TV screens inside (which makes for a great brunch option come football season!)My friend and I each had burgers. I can't recall which my friend had, but it was spicy and he ate it with gusto. I had the Southwestern burger which was topped with a generous amount of avocado and cheese (and that chipotle lime vinagrette was pretty tasty too!). Both came with a healthy serving of steak fries which were nice and crispy. Both burgers were humongous and cooked to order, so no complaints!They have a pretty fair selection of beers on draft and the Old' Smokey's Margarita was pretty good too if you're into sweet margaritas. Probably the only complaint I have is that sitting outdoors, service can be a little slow. But I chalk it up more towards that they need to hit their stride. I'll have to come back during brunch another time. But at this rate, this may be acceptable enough to replace my traditional Gaslight Sunday football spot. :)",The Stewed Cow,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

The food is just okay, it's pretty standard for a bar. The service is a little rusty, but that's to be expected with new staff. Nice variety of beers, not your standard Bud Light selection.

A little off the beaten path in Hoboken, this bar has a much calmer atmosphere than the typical Hoboken bar and is very popular with the locals. There were even several strollers parked inside during happy hour which is always a good sign in Hoboken. The libation menu features a huge bourbon list, a good draught beer selection, and some delicious cocktails that will help you work up the courage to ride the mechanical bull in the back. Even so, it is far from a raucous crowd here, even on a Friday at 11:30pm. I tried the bacon flavored ""pork chops and appleasuce"", probably my favorite drink of the night, then the Mule Kicker, but with tequila instead of gin, then the chocolate infused Cocoa old fashioned, which was tasty, but very heavy. I also had the bacon, bleu, and hot sauce burger which was incredible. The meat was excellently seasoned, rare for bars in the area and the toppings mixed very well together. The fries were also very tasty. I also stole one of our friends' bourbon wings which was very tasty and cooked well and nice and crispy.

We went around 7pm last Friday for dinner. We walked in and asked the hostess if we could sit outside. She said she'd check but before she could a different hostess/waitress stopped her and said their was no more empty tables and we'd have to wait unless we wanted to sit inside. So instead of waiting, we sat inside next to a window where I could see an empty table outside!  When I turned around to request the table outside, the couple that walked in behind us ended sitting there. I knew they didn't have a reservation since they also walked in and told the hostess they were a party of 2. I was super annoyed! The right thing they should of done was offered the table to us even after we were seated inside. We sat there for 2 minutes when I saw a different couple that was seated outside leave. I got up to tell the hostess/manager/waitress that seated us I wanted to sit outside. She said she'd go clean it promptly before seating us there. She decided to trot around the restaurant taking orders, bringing out food, chatting with other employees, everything but clean that table or tell someone else to clean it for us. After giving her 8 minutes, I decided I'd get up and do it myself. When she saw us exiting, she ran over and cleaned it quickly.

Aside from the terrible name, I'm always happy to hear about a bar that isn't located on 1st or by the Path and the fact they play country music makes it all that better. Finally went here on a Thursday night with a few people and, unfortunately, left largely disappointed.First off, the country music they play is so low you can barely hear it over the noise of the crowd, making it largely pointless. Combine that with the super dull looking decor and there was nothing that made the place stand out.The food was just bar food, nothing more, nothing less. The most bizarre thing is the mechanical bull in the back. It takes up a huge chunk of real estate and largely sits unused. They had it up and running toward the end of the night but I didn't see one person ride it nor did the DJ try and talk it up. Seems like the owners threw it in thinking it would be like New Orleans but  largely don't know what to do with it. The whiskey/bourbon list was more impressive then most but, just a pet peeve, I hate when bars line up their liquor bottles on shelves behind the bars and only keep it like 50% stocked. There is nothing worse then sitting at a bar and starring at dead space and empty bottles.Would I complain about going back? No. The place was clean, the bartenders were friendly, the happy hour specials aren't bad and the place is located far enough in Hoboken that it is more a locals crowd then most.  Would I purposely go out of my way to have a drink here?

When I heard a Bourbon Bar with a mechanical bull I thought ok well that's different. I finally got to check it out yesterday. For a Wednesday night it appeared pretty busy however I don't know if it was actually busy or the lack of seating just gave the illusion it was a packed house. The front of the house has limited table seating and the bar has stools which in my opinion they could have bent the budget a bit and upgraded. The back room is basically just the bull room and bathroom area. The bulls a great novelty but I doubt Monday -  Thursday its seeing much action.  This place could definitely use some more seating. The staff was very friendly and manager was accommodating when we couldn't get a table he found us at the bar to seat us. The menu seems pretty standard. We ordered quesadillas & chicken sandwiches which were both good, no complaints with our meal. Our server was pleasant but he was in a bit of a rush to close out our tabs which would annoy me in any case. All in all it seems this place has a few kinks to work out. I don't hate it but not my first choice. I'd go back if for nothing else but to ride the bull of course.",The Stewed Cow,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"
