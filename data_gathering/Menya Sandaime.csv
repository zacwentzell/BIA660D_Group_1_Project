I recommend coming early and avoid the rush because the line becomes long and so does the wait!When you first walk in you will realize its not a regular sit down ramen restaurant. You basically walk to the back counter to order your food then find seating after you get your food. They also have a little counter with rayu ( spicy oil) and shichimi togarashi ( Japanese chili powder mix ). After you eat there is a little station where you leave your tray ( which usually a worker will help you).They have a variety of ramen, rice bowls, few appetizers and Vegetarian versions of some of their dishes. If you like Asian soft drinks they have calpico and few other popular drinks. Want something non sugared? Go for the yummy ito en geeen teas. It has no sugar at all and lots of tea flavor.My Co workers got the Tonkatsu Ramen, gyudon and the yaki ramen vegetarian version while I got the Shoyu Ramen.My coworkers with the Gyudon and Tonkatsu got their food fairly quickly and thought it was great. Very flavorful and filling.My shoyu ramen was also delicious as well. It was very flavorful, topped off with half and egg, 2 slightly grilled pork belly, and lots of spinach and bamboo shoots. My Coworker who got the vegetarian version of the seafood sautéed ramen would beg to differ with his experience. His took three times as long to get, and he did not look like he enjoyed it. He threw away half of his food :(  however that said, he also is much pickier and doesn't like random things.  ( ex : doesn't like chipotle but loves Chick-fil-A, hates Popeyes) This place is good.

Anyway, big menu across the back area and a glimpse into the kitchen.They have a free water station to the right of the counter and pickup area.Ramen:- Miso ramen included a portion of stir-fry vegetables that dwarfed the noodles and soup - for a while there I was eating nothing but those vegetables. The depth of the bowl was pretty good. The miso flavor, however, was far too light. I suspected diluted by all that vegetable on top.- The spicy ramen was interesting, a spicy that didn't turn the soup base red, but was pretty intense none-the-less; go with small (one pepper) if you haven't tried it before. Unfortunately, the size of the food was less than half (minimal vegetables).On both ramens, the pork was too lean and dry, overcooked, didn't fall apart in the mouth (much of it was already shredded), and too heavy on both smoke + burned pieces instead of savory pork. The soy sauce used was too heavy, and the pork reduced what would have been okay ramen to pretty much a bowl of overcooked meat ramen, something you would've expected out of a college dorm kitchen, not a restaurant like Menya.I'm disappointed, and I'll give them another shot later after they work out their opening kinks, but they really need to work on balance between dishes and also work on the balance between events.",Menya Sandaime,4.0 star rating,$$,Ramen

I had Tonkatsu Ramen, the soup is on the lighter side, could be little more flavory. But overall I like it. However, the Gyoza is very soft and not as crispy as I wanted. We also ordered the Gyuton and we loved it !So overall worth the try. And hope they can add more items to their menu after their grand opening.",Menya Sandaime,4.0 star rating,$$,Ramen

It turns out it's a fast food version of Ramen. I'm not giving this a 2-Star because of the setup but because of the food. The Ramen is just not very tasty. I'm a Ramen fanatic and this place just doesn't cut it. The broth is lacking flavor, the noodles although is ok, it's just not up to par as the other location. The staff is friendly but I'm here for the Ramen more than the service. Also, it's not a BYOB place so don't think that it is just because they don't serve alcohol.",Menya Sandaime,4.0 star rating,$$,Ramen

I am very impressed with the interior design and the detail that went into it. The menu is slightly different to the fort lee location which I liked for a change.

I highly recommend!",Menya Sandaime,4.0 star rating,$$,Ramen
50,-DyBwBRGhSK50_eh0zm98A,Agnes S.,2.0 star rating,Broth was disappointing - lacked flavor and tasted like instant noodle broth. Noodles were also more like spaghetti than ramen noodles. Pork belly needed more seasoning too. We were a party of four and no one was thrilled with their noodle bowls.  I had high hopes to have a good noodle shop near work so I hope this place can improve.

53,l1p3wgTtX4V2WUntSiqpyQ,Vic Z.,4.0 star rating,"Big Fan of Ramen, both me and my sons. So whenever we find a new spot it's a must we try it. I work near here and when I saw them building it over this past summer I have to admit, I was a bit excited. So far I've only tried the Tonkatsu Ramen regular and spicy. Both have justified my excitement. Noodles are the perfect texture, broth is perfect flavor , and the add ins are all top of the line. Sprouts, pork belly, and the marinated egg. I'll save the Butchering of the Japanese names for these ingredients. I will not there should be an option for extra broth or noodles. Is that a deal breaker absolutely not. This Ramen spot also has other items on the menu if your not into the soup, but why goto a Ramen spot and not have the ramen. My opinion is if your in Jersey City near the Newport Path train stop & it lunch , this is your spot.",Menya Sandaime,4.0 star rating,$$,Ramen

I like that they have variety of menu - ramens, appetizers and rice bowls. We ordered Tonkotsu ramen, Karakuchi ramen and Gyoza. The Tonkotsu ramen is good - good texture of the noodle. The pork is not too fatty. The broth is also good, but could be a bit thicker. For Karakuchi ramen, I hope they would use chili paste instead of chili powder for spiciness..  For me it's not the same. Chili paste will give a softer spiciness... For Gyoza, I would like the meat inside to be less fatty. Other than that everything is great. Staff have good service mind. I'll definitely go back!!",Menya Sandaime,4.0 star rating,$$,Ramen
56,GjK1LUj9F4wyYvesbO0nog,Ryan L.,3.0 star rating,"Noodles are really good. I believe they make them on premises. The broth unfortunately is a bit lacking.  Very watery and not thick like a good ramen base soup. The spicy is a single spice flavor. It could use a little more flavor from extra garlic, sesame seed oil and kelp. The seafood based broth just tastes like a concentrated dashi. Not what I would expect for soup.",Menya Sandaime,4.0 star rating,$$,Ramen

Noodles were tender but still had a little bite, pork was very ""porky"" and not fatty and the broth was flavorful but not overpowering in the Tonkotsu.

63,EIB-pc17pA59DfnwJIVz2Q,Nicolas I.,2.0 star rating,I was curious about this place so I decided to go there for lunch this week. First the restaurant looks great. It is brand new so everything is shiny and the restaurant is crowded but not that much. The prices are fair with around $11 for a regular ramen. The food is pretty low quality. The pork in my ramen was not very good and in a small quantity. I had to get extra pork ($3) to have something decent. however it was tasty and I only waited 5mins to get my plate. Now something that REALLY annoyed me is that there is a lady literally yelling all order numbers when there are ready. It is ok for the first 2 or 3 but it started to get really annoying after 5mins. Eez ! Seriously invest on a monitor to display orders when there are ready!!!,Menya Sandaime,4.0 star rating,$$,Ramen
64,7zpa2efM1xzxpfCXBbdDwg,John C.,1.0 star rating,"Update: Changing my review from 5 to 1 star. Not feeling so good about this place anymore. Not sure what happened. Maybe the boss was not there. The last time I ate here the noodles were very mushy and the gyozas were an oily, soggy mess. Don't get the gyozas or make sure they thoroughly cook it; they seemed raw to me. Plus the staff there cannot seem to keep track of the bowls they put out. I had to make two trips because we ordered 2 bowls of ramen plus some sides. When I went to pick up the second bowl they accused me of trying to steal it. WTF?  Best ramen in Jersey City! Not saying much I know. But I'm giving it 5 stars anyway because there is nothing better in the area. If you've been to the Fort Lee location, the food is pretty much the same. So far, I've had the Black Ramen and Tsukemen. Both are solid although portions were on the small side. I would suggested picking up a side of gyoza or a rice bowl if you're hungry. This place is ever so slightly better than Ani Ramen (which is also very good), but Menya does not serve alcohol and has far fewer options on the menu.
