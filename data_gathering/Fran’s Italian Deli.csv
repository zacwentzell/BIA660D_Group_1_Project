Hoboken has all the amazing Fresh Mozz spots, and Fran's probably makes it creamier and fresher than even the closest contestants (Fiore and Andrea). And the bottom line is that the best sandwich at the best deli in the best deli town in the world - is the Godfather, here.Anyway, I'll be fran-k. The following information is top secret. Don't tell anyone how you frand out about it.See, there's a secret. The best Italian delis in the world are not in New York City. They are not in your hometown of whateversville, Missouri. They are not in Italy or France (although there's some damn good sh** over there). Forget Long Island. Sorry Chicago. Nope. The best Italian delis in the world are in Hoboken and Jersey City. Yes, it's true. Don't ask me why, they just are.One day, they Fran out of Fresh Mozz. It was a statewide day of mourning. Or was it a statewide morning of mourning. I forget.There are a dozen spots in Ho-broken and nearby Jurbs (Jersey Burbs), all vying for the title of the world's best Italian Deli, and in the end it really comes down to the ""big 5"" (although I'm still exploring and finding new ones). I can't decide which of the 5 is best, and people I've taken to them have differing opinions. Although one thing we all agree on is: if the other 4 didn't exist, then the one remaining would be the best in the world. That's how good these 5 are.Vito's, M & P Biancamano, Fran's, Andrea Salumeria, and Fiore. I've been going between the 5 as my fave for the longest time, but if I had a gun to my head and I had to pick one: I'd take Fran's.I'm definitely a Franboy. Or frangirl, on weekends (tosses hair).The selling point of all 5 (and all good delis in this area) is that they have Fresh Mozzarella. It's literally fresh, like, still gooey, warm, squidy, just made, and absolute heaven. Their imported meats are the best of the best. Their breads and seasonings, incomparable. You can't get any better than these sandwiches. Come and try for yourself. They have ruined all Italian delis everywhere for me, forever. For a traditional Italian sandwich, nothing will ever compare to Hoboken.It's absolutely Fran-tastic.I'd recommend putting oil, roasted red peppers, and whatever else you feel like on there too. But the stars of the show: the prosciutto and the fresh mozz - are the vital elements. At Fran's it's called ""The Godfather"", imaginatively.

16,-IulESTI4w9z7CSKxZ_nGA,Imran M.,2.0 star rating,"Let me start out by saying that the food is really good, but today, I wouldn't have known because it never showed up. I placed an order on GrubHub around 9:15am. They are usually really quick, which I appreciate. Today though, the estimated delivery time came and went...so I called up to see what was going on. The restaurant claimed with 100% certainty that they delivered the food, and called the phone number on the order, having left the food outside the door. The problem is, the food wasn't outside my door, and the phone never rang. The delivery address and number on the order were correct. Maybe they fat-fingered the address and phone number on the order slip when they transcribed it from GrubHub? Maybe the delivery person got lost but didn't realize it? In any case, a mistake was made, and it needed to be fixed. The restaurant refused to send the order again or refund the order, so GrubHub stepped in and refunded it instead. I will never EVER order from here again. They seemed so certain that they hadn't made a mistake, and that *I* was the one at fault. If I made a mistake, I'll own up to it...but I didn't. I double checked the info on the order in GrubHub, and it was correct. My buzzer never rang, and i have no missed calls on my phone. They claimed that some woman answered the phone. CLEARLY a wrong number....I'm a man! This was ABSOLUTELY a mistake on their part, but they seem unwilling to admit it, and make it right. That's a terrible way to run a business...treating your customers like they're trying to rip you off, and ripping them off in the process. It's disgusting, and I don't need to take this abuse. Especially in Hoboken, where there are a bunch of options. I'm done with these guys.TL;DR - The food is REALLY good, but if they mix up your delivery, they won't admit to it, and they certainly won't make it up to you.

Now while that's just part of the vibe, it's authentic, just like their food. While not all of their subs are to my taste, the ones that are, they've perfected!  I love their mozzarella/mutz. The vegetarian sub with balsamic, pesto and red onion is my usual go to.  As well, they have the best egg sandwiches West of the Hudson to say the least!  Just a note, if you're not native to the tri-state area, you may not know that you can request you egg to be over-easy, or fried, or scalded, amongst other choices.  Fran's has perfected each different egg type that I have ordered - including a perfectly melted joy of cheese on top of my either bacon, egg and cheese or sausage, egg and cheese.I LOVE the fact that Fran's is still holding on strong, and remaining authentic to the true meaning of an Italian deli.  I can't wait to broaden my horizons, but I have loved everything I've ordered that I'm scared too since I only have one stomach :)",Fran’s Italian Deli,4.5 star rating,$,"Delis,, Italian,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

In any case, a mistake was made, and it needed to be fixed. The restaurant refused to send the order again or refund the order, so GrubHub stepped in and refunded it instead. I will never EVER order from here again. They seemed so certain that they hadn't made a mistake, and that *I* was the one at fault. If I made a mistake, I'll own up to it...but I didn't. I double checked the info on the order in GrubHub, and it was correct. My buzzer never rang, and i have no missed calls on my phone. They claimed that some woman answered the phone. CLEARLY a wrong number....I'm a man! This was ABSOLUTELY a mistake on their part, but they seem unwilling to admit it, and make it right. That's a terrible way to run a business...treating your customers like they're trying to rip you off, and ripping them off in the process. It's disgusting, and I don't need to take this abuse. Especially in Hoboken, where there are a bunch of options. I'm done with these guys.TL;DR - The food is REALLY good, but if they mix up your delivery, they won't admit to it, and they certainly won't make it up to you.

Now while that's just part of the vibe, it's authentic, just like their food. While not all of their subs are to my taste, the ones that are, they've perfected!  I love their mozzarella/mutz. The vegetarian sub with balsamic, pesto and red onion is my usual go to.  As well, they have the best egg sandwiches West of the Hudson to say the least!  Just a note, if you're not native to the tri-state area, you may not know that you can request you egg to be over-easy, or fried, or scalded, amongst other choices.  Fran's has perfected each different egg type that I have ordered - including a perfectly melted joy of cheese on top of my either bacon, egg and cheese or sausage, egg and cheese.I LOVE the fact that Fran's is still holding on strong, and remaining authentic to the true meaning of an Italian deli.  I can't wait to broaden my horizons, but I have loved everything I've ordered that I'm scared too since I only have one stomach :)",Fran’s Italian Deli,4.5 star rating,$,"Delis,, Italian,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Aside from the food here is the rundown for the other criteria one should judge any mom and pop deli:- Credit cards: YES which is rare for a small mom and pop place - Hours: Opens and closes very early (around 4pm) like all good old school mom and pop places who cater to locals- Ambiance: Plenty of dingy seating inside.

But today, I couldn't shake my sandwich craving, so a quick Yelp search brought me to Fran's Italian Deli.Online ordering? Check.Walking distance? Check.No ""long line"" warnings? Check.Soft bread option? BIG CHECK.Balsamic vinegar (alone) as a condiment option? SOLD.My sandwich was ready by the time I walked to the deli (about 10 mins). ""I just wrapped this up!"" the woman behind the counter said with a smile as she handed it to me. First impression? For a little over $7, this sandwich was as long as my forearm! And it only got better when I sat down to eat.A soft hero (!!!) surrounding a core of fresh, delicious, perfect roast beef inside a generous ring of provolone. Shredded lettuce, fresh tomatoes, and a non-overwhelming amount of onions. PERFECTION. I probably could have gone for a little more balsamic on the sandwich, and if I had eaten in-house (in-deli?), I would have asked for more. I couldn't finish the whole thing, but I gave it the old college (grad school?) try. My friends were a little jealous when they saw my sandwich, and I told them about this awesome new deli I found on Hudson Street. You've got some fans, Fran!So all in all, I was greatly impressed.

It was almost this crazily confusing sensation where the first bite of mutz was taking me to another place but, then I would bite on this cold, hard breaded chicken and was like back on earth, sitting on my couch in Jersey City. The bread wasn't crispy either, soaked up all the sauce. Not in a bad way, but, not all together a good way.I'm not shunning Fran's for life you see, just not quick to order that parm again. But, definitely a sandwich that mutz again. Yes to the mutz, no to the chicken.*** I did order delivery, so take out may be a different story when you can eat it fresh outta the hands of who made it.

I walked over to pick it up and was greeted with more sincerity in wanted to make up for my bad experience. She even remembered that I forgot chips from the last time I ordered and told me to make sure I got them this time.I left already writing a 4 star review in my head...cause I mean damn...where else do you get service like that?!I got back to my desk, held my breath, and opened the paper wrapping my sammie... ::cue the heavenly serenade:: ...the sandwich already looked a million times better than my last experience. Then I bit into it and it was the yummy mozzy deliciousness I had first grown to love from Fran's! Needless to say, I'm glad I gave them another shot. They definitely made it worth my while!

One is Fiore Deli and the place is mondo good and I""ll review Fiore in a bit, and M & P Biancamano, yet to be visited.But this about Fran's. And the thing I was happy about besides the food was this:A Friendly crew. I mean friendly. Impressive...helpful too!Our first time there, we asked about the ""mutz"" and they told us how they serve it and they were VERY kind to throw in some bread at my behest (the place was closing and getting rid of the day-old was a no-brainer).  Seeing their kindness, I bought even MORE mutz and more bread. I mean, Hey! If you find people that take care of you, well, you take care of them, right?Now at $10/Pound for the mozz/mutz, you don't get TOO crazy but we walked away with another pound (three in total) and the bought bread to go with the gifted bread that made toasted points w/olive oil with the mutz that evening as well as sandwiches the next day. Fiore Deli is good for what it does, in fact, the best. See my review of them. But the mutz edge goes to Fran's where the salt/moisture (slightly more salt, slightly less moisture) suits us best.We'll be hitting up M & P Biancamano soon!

You really can't go wrong here. The mozzarella is amazing, but everything I've tried has been great. My favorites are probably the paisano panini (mozzarella, tomato, basil) and the pesto hero (chicken, pesto, roasted red peppers, mozzarella). The salads are pretty good too, if you're looking for a lighter option. So far, this is my favorite eatery in Hoboken.Tips: I don't advise the paisano panini if you're having the food delivered.

I'll start with the service. The people that work here are very nice and attentive. They have free water on Mondays and free chips on Wednesdays, and after three or four trips to Fran's, they'll already remember your name. It's very mom-and-pop and old-fashioned in that sense, and I really appreciate it.As for the food, very fresh ingredients. The mutz is great, very tender. A model Italian sub shop. Everything I've had from here has been good. It's not the best sub shop I've ever been to though. That designation still goes to Mr. Sub in Union. Mr. Sub may not have toppings like avocado and chipotle mayo, but it's the best example of a regular ol' sub I've ever had. Fran's excels though at Italian subs with ingredients like roasted peppers, pesto, and mutz.

97,GimZBQcwm0X0ppFn8si0-w,Josh V.,3.0 star rating,"The food here is pretty good. The mutz is excellent. The chicken parm is a big, gooey mess.The problem is actually going here. It's not a pleasant place to sit and eat, because it gets super busy and crowded, and people waiting for their food take up all the space. The food takes awhile to come out, so you can plan to wait for awhile. The ordering process is basically chaos, which is a pet peeve of mine. Where do you order, and from whom? When do you pay? It's not clear and not consistent. Sometimes they take your name and shout it when your order is ready, sometimes they don't and just shout out the order. Hopefully no one else ordered the same thing you did!I once tried ordering online to forgo all this craziness and to save time, but when I did that they didn't start making my order until I showed up and asked for it, so it didn't help much at all.The hours are also very limited. They're open for breakfast and lunch during the week, and that's it. Apparently they're open on Saturdays, though I've never noticed.I prefer Luca Brasi's, but Fran's is much closer.

I literally felt like I was eating a cigarette that had been smoked. It was so bad I couldn't finish it and now I'm nauseous. To top it off, it took nearly two hours to get to me, and when I called, whoever answered was rude. I get it you're busy, actually no I don't get it, but okay, you're busy, but that's a blessing, not something you should be rude to customers about who are making you busy and hence profitable. Ugh.

I was always kind of bummed that I had yet to find an amazing bagel place in Hoboken to get my Bacon, Egg, & Cheese on an everything bagel.  None of the places I've tried so far hit the spot.  Then one morning I decided to order a bacon, egg, and cheese from Fran's Deli on a bagel. Fran (I think it was her) called me right after putting in my order and said that they were out of bagels this morning because they had a large crowd.  She said, ""Would you like it on a hero instead?"" and I asked her if the hero's were good.  She said ""We've got the best bread in town"".  I agreed.  The bread is soft but a little crispy on the outside just how I like it and the flavor is great.  The eggs were cooked perfectly- very fresh and not overdone. Bacon & cheese just made it better.  The second time I ordered the sandwich, I got extra cheese which was just ridiculous (in a good way).I did get a chance to try a bagel from here- and it was surprisingly very good. I am really picky about my bagels, but Fran's plain bagel toasted with cream cheese hit the spot. I've definitely had better bagels in my lifetime but I have to say this was my favorite bagel so far in Hoboken!For lunch one time I ordered the Chicken Pesto sandwich with breaded chicken.  It was great and the mutz was so fresh and yummy.  The second time I ordered it, they didn't put enough pesto on it so it wasn't as flavorful as the first time. The portion is great though if you are really hungry and the food is fresh & great quality.  However- it is only open until 3:00pm on weekdays which kind of bums me out if I want something for dinner.Overall- I AM A FAN, FRAN! :)",Fran’s Italian Deli,4.5 star rating,$,"Delis,, Italian,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

She donated brunch and dinner comprised of eggplant parmesean, chicken parmesean, and pasta as well as bread and utensils. The food was much appreciated. Other places might have a little better mutz, but I would give 5 stars to the deli sandwiches and the heart and soul behind the business. Thanks Fran you are amazing!",Fran’s Italian Deli,4.5 star rating,$,"Delis,, Italian,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I was impressed with it as I kept eating 3 inch servings over the course of a boozey all day Kentucky Derby party. My friends live right across the street so I recently went right to the source. None of the featured sandwiches on the board jumped at me, so I decided to create my own. The gal behind the counter made a few suggestions and I walked out with my heavy brown bag anxious to rip it open.  Inside: A perfect flour-y Italian roll, cappy ham, hard salami, fresh mozz, and banana peppers.

There will be plenty of times when you will be busy doing papers or it will be rainy and you don't want to go anywhere, but that is when delivery will be your best friend. I don't know how many of you out there use a Facebook app called Food Frenzy by Campusfood.com, but if you haven't then you have been missing out on free money, and who doesn't like free money! You play a tile game and earn free money towards anything you order with no catch, other than minimum price restrictions. If you've played then I am sure you have seen plenty of familiar names on the list for delivery to Stevens, which is why I wanted to try something new with Fran's Italian Deli.Located far down on Hudson St, Fran's is open from 11:00 am until 3:15pm most days. A typical Italian Deli, with average lunchtime prices, I wanted to see if there was anything in particular that would set this place apart in a proud Italian community. Instead of rating the ambiance, I decided to test their delivery speed. Even with my large order, they were able to deliver to Stevens with no problem in about 40 minutes. They had called about 10 minutes after I placed an order to just clarify one item, which I appreciated since there have been a few times when I've gotten the wrong thing from an online order. The food was still warm when it arrived, which was also another pleasant surprise.As expected of an Italian deli, the majority of the menu was different sandwiches, heroes, and paninis. I wanted to get a good feel of what they had to offer so I decided to order a few different sandwiches. The first item that caught my eye was ""the Pesto,"" which was a chicken hero with some roasted roasted red peppers and mutz. I fell in love with this sandwich at a deli near my friend's house, but Fran's had too little pesto and some tough chicken. I tried a toasted Panini of eggplant and fresh mutz, which was surprisingly delicious. I also tried one of their specialty heroes, the ""Good Fella,"" which was buffalo, pepper jack cheese, blue cheese dressing, tomatoes and onions. It's odd balance of flavors wasn't what I was expecting, and it's lack of spice was upsetting. Their chicken parm, which was my favorite sandwich, proved that the simple combination of chicken, fresh mutz, and marinara sauce is all you really need. The mutz was so good, that I decided to order an extra pound of it, and enjoyed every ounce. While I know that I am playing right into Campusfood's Marketing Department's hands, I don't care, and neither should you! Free money is always a good thing, and I can see myself making many orders especially with senior design days coming around in the future. Fran's may not have blown me away, but it can offer a nice change of pace from the usual places that we all at Stevens go to. They sure know how to use their guns by including their delicious fresh mutz in many of their sandwiches. So if you've won some money, why not give it a shot?
