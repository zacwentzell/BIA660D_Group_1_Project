Food came out wrong for one of us, and instead of them fixing it on they're own they awkwardly brought it out saying ""ummm, they didn't put the sauce on the side but do you still want it?"" Obviously we do not. Then in the middle of our meal the tall man asked us to move to a different table since a bigger party was coming... ridiculous, we did not move. Maybe your severs shouldn't sit a party of three in a larger table. To ask us to get up in the middle of our meals is insane. And then to top it all off, upon leaving the tall man chased us outside with one of our empty iced coffee cups which we brought in from another store. He gave it to me and said ""take your trash this isn't from out store"" I grabbed it and retuned back into the store and slammed it down on the table. He then grabbed it and ran outside after us again and threw it into a garbage while mumbling under his breath. Yes we came in with iced coffee from a different place, but we sat at this restaurant and ordered food ate and we're paying customers. It was one piece of trash.I live around the block from this place and will not be retuning. Maybe they should learn a thing or two about customer service and manners.

They have a seating area out in front, very small and very cute for a spring or summer afternoon to enjoy the sun. The feel is dainty and elegant - a place you'd go to for afternoon tea and crumpets - but in an imperfect, more relaxed sort of way.Now on to the important stuff....Service review comes first because it was that bad. We came to this place on a weekend afternoon for a light brunch, and when we arrived here, they asked us if it would be okay if the three of us were seated at a table for two. That's fine, we said. So we were brought to the outside seating area to a small table with two seats. My friend stood...and stood...and stood as we waited for a third seat to be brought for us. It wasn't. We asked one of the wait staff for another seat, and she seemed confused. And then we asked another staff member for another seat - also seemed confused. The whole situation got so awkward after after a while with my friend standing there as other tables were served and eating, wait staff walking past without noticing... Almost funny (almost).When we were finally all seated (after a ridiculously long time), we waited and waited for someone to come and take our order. And waited and waited to get our food. You get the gist.As for the food, I ordered the Eggs Benedict Mushroom with Ham. It wasn't anything special - maybe because it was cold when I got it.

If you offer a Groupon, it's for MARKETING purposes. Don't then drive away customers who use it and make them not want to come back.  I actually enjoyed my first visit to La Bouche for lunch a few months ago, the food was pretty good and our French waitress with a pixie cut was really nice and sweet. So I was happy to see a $22 Groupon for 2 drinks ($10 value), 2 sandwiches or salad ($26 value), 1 dessert ($8 value). We go there today, show them the Groupon, the new waiter has no idea what it is, so needs to go behind the counter to ask the owner, fine. So we order an espresso drink and a caramel latte, he has to go ask the owner, comes back and tells us we can only get plain coffee or tea. I tell him the Groupon says up to $10 for 2 drinks which we were well within with our original order, he goes asks the owner, gets the okay.  My affogato espresso drink comes first which is pretty good. Then my bf's caramel latte comes 10 MINUTES later and it's just a regular caramel coffee. He just goes whatever and takes it anyway. Then I order a salmon eggs benedict and he orders a panini, now a more experienced waitress has taken over, goes to ask the owner, comes back and tells him he can only get a sandwich with the Groupon. The paninis are the same price as the sandwiches! Most of the paninis are actually even cheaper. Whatever, he gets the chicken sandwich instead of the chicken panini.  Both are pretty good.Then my boyfriend tries to get a regular coffee refill, they say he can't with the groupon, even though they originally gave him caramel coffee instead of the caramel latte he ordered. Whatever. THEN, we get the brownie with vanilla ice cream for dessert which was $6 on the menu.  She brings out a brownie WITHOUT ice cream and says the Groupon doesn't allow for ice cream, even though the Groupon says dessert is up to an $8 value.  FREAKING RIDICULOUS!!One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Also this is a tiny 8 table place, there were 3 wait staff, and all of them were scrambling and seemed confused. Terribly managed, most likely the owner's fault. Won't be coming back to say the least. I gave 2 stars because the food itself wasn't bad. However the service and how they handled this Groupon situation was so appalling they really only deserve 1 star.  Damn shame because before we came today I was wondering why they only had 3 stars on yelp and was telling my bf how I was going to give them 5 stars to help out their average.

My waitress was very sweet, though not super attentive; particularly given the small amount of people (just 2, including me). I ordered the lemonade & chicken panini (with no olives) and waited what I thought was way too long for the lemonade. I watched the waitress do all kinds of things behind the counter while I waited, looking directly into the fridge at the carafe of lemonade. Then she finally finished her activities and brought me the lemonade; it was delicious! It tasted fresh and a little more sour and sweet than most lemonade...which I love. I was initially very excited when I received my panini (which also took awhile). It looked and smelled delicious. My first bite was so satisfying! Chicken, tomato, stringy mozzarella and yummy pesto. I felt I had made the right lunch choice! Then I took my 2nd bite...where's the chicken?! I, then, inspected the sandwich, only to find 3 or 4 more chunks of chicken sprinkled throughout. Color me disappointed. The second half was the same. Also noted: the tomato was cut a little too thick and there was way too much of it.

Their take on Lyonnaise potatoes is a particular standout.However, dining here does require some patience. Be prepared to sit in cramped quarters, with a mostly understaffed kitchen and waitstaff. This is not exactly a quick meal. Also, most dishes come with a meager collection of greens that serves more as a garnish than an actual side salad.

Based on food alone, I'd give them 3 stars for sure.  I've had both times the egg on croissant sandwich - the eggs are fluffy and well prepared and the dish is solid.  The Monte Cristo sandwich is also particularly good.  Coffee and coffee drinks are really good as well.  Much better breakfast/brunch options than ChocOPain which is just across the street.The bad: The atmosphere isn't great.  It's a cute idea with mix and match furniture, lots of toile and a very French feel.  Unfortunately, the whole place just needs like it needs to be renovated.  It's really dingy with peeling paint and ceiling cracks, and it just doesn't feel as clean as I'd really like either - but I think that's more due to age than anything. A warning, it fills up quick, as there are only about 5 or 6 tables inside.The ugly: The service here has been just awful both times I've been.  I don't know how these people can continue to stay employed here, they have absolutely no interest in the customers or their jobs.  They will come over, take your order, and dump your food in front of you.  Not one bit more.  This past time, the girl working there was playing a game on her iPhone the whole time we were there - making everyone listen to the music and sound effects from the app.  Neither she, nor the other guy there, ever asked how everything was, or offered us refills on coffee, we had to practically assault them to get our check. They weren't even busy - there were only 3 parties in the restaurant.  There was just no excuse for that level of inattention. This place has maybe the worst service I've experienced in a sit down restaurant.So...that's the run down.  Good food, awful service, but such potential!",La Bouche Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"French,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Sandwiches"

It's charming, I like the rustic French country decor, and the staff is friendly. I love French crepes and looked forward to a very basic mushroom, ham and cheese crepe. The two Creperies in town both use the sweet batter for their savory crepes, which I find disconcerting , but they are basically fast food establishments and don't bill themselves as a French cafe.When the crepe came out and I saw that it too, appeared to be made out of white flour, and not buckwheat, I was disappointed. However, first taste lowered the bar even further! The crepe was too doughy, and fluffy, and tasted like it was made of Bisquick!  Nearly as bad was that the mushrooms were clearly canned, and still cold as if they were thrown into the crepe straight from the can!  There was virtually no flavor to the crepe. Crepes and Things has the consistency correct, and other than not using buckwheat flour, is far better, and three or four dollars cheaper.Sadly, I have no desire to give Le Cafe Bouche a second chance .",La Bouche Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"French,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Sandwiches"

But, I think I'm finally done with that. The food isn't the problem - it's the service. It's terrible, On multiple occasions, I have waited far too long for my food - or worse, have gotten my food and had to wait 10+ minutes for whomever I've been with to get theirs, with no explanation or apology from the server. No sense of urgency whatsoever. The other issue is how small the place is - which might be fine if there were great service - that small cafe cordiality we all love - but, instead, it's just cramped. Also, their setup makes it seem like you could just walk in and order a coffee to go, but it's always awkward. The servers have to wedge by you to get from the kitchen to the tables, and the diners to get from their tables to the bathroom.

I had a hunch that got confirmed as soon as I took the first bite of my food. No matter how cute the place is, the food really breaks it. FOOD - Eggs benedict mushroom with bacon: The eggs laid atop spinach, mushrooms, bacon (you also have a choice of ham), and brioche buns, with salad and fried potatoes on the side. While I liked that they tried to make the meal healthier by adding greens (and I actually really like spinach), the spinach made the buns and bacon pretty soggy. Not only that, but my plate was not warm; it was room temperature, as if the dish had been sitting out for a while. At least the eggs were cooked well, but I ended up just eating them alone. - Oven baked spicy tomato with eggs (forgot exact name): Was tasty, but nothing too special. The waitress pointed out that she really likes this dish though.DRINKS - While the food needs improvement, the mocha was great! It was more chocolate than expresso heavy--just how I like it. It basically tastes like hot chocolate, with a hint of expresso. Sadly, they don't do pretty designs on your hot drinks. - The orange juice tasted just like Tropicana. I doubt it was fresh-squeezed, which is something that I really like having at brunch. - FYI: I saw a sign that said BYOB, in case you are interested in alcoholic brunches.ATMOSPHEREI repeat: a-dore-a-ble. There are a lot of sofa seating with colorful seat cushions. Definitely a place to go to with girlfriends. If you bring a party, they will set up a nice spot in the window corner for your group.

That being said, it appears that their are only two or three staff members (we only saw two but they could be stashing someone else away). The decor is busy and frenetic but with clear choices regarding style. Location and space wise, this is perfect and the sounds of jazz really being a strong pulse to the room. The better half opted for a bowl of Lentil soup and a Miss Piggy Panini for myself. Second thing, be aware of your ingredients. If you serve bread crumbs with an item and know that the guest can not consume dairy be knowledgeable of the contents of said breadcrumbs. Now all of ghis being said, we both eventually enjoyed our meals. The prosciutto on my panini could have been much thinner but I am biased due to my salumeria past ... as for the lentil soup, delicious.

It can get loud, so headphones are a good idea if you're coming in to get some work done.",La Bouche Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"French,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Sandwiches"

Paid $8 for an egg sandwich on whole wheat toast.  Unfortunately, I went here because only they and Anthony David's were open and I live downtown.  The sandwich was really crappy and I can only suppose they gouged the sandwich price since nobody would consistently pay that price for the low quality product.  Will never go here again.  Walking 8 blocks for breakfast tomorrow...",La Bouche Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"French,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Sandwiches"

140,k-COHEioFou3YgNyhiIpiw,Malasa J.,2.0 star rating,"I came to this cafe looking for a quaint place to have brunch with my girl friends. I live uptown and had passed the place a couple times and checked out the menu before. I was really impressed by the menu-- there were all the classic breakfast items like eggs, omelets and Belgian waffles-- they even had sweet and savory crepes. I was excited for what seemed like a European-style menu (I mean it was called La Bouche, we felt like we were going to a delicious French place).'We were disappointed to say the least.  The food just...wasn't good. I have made simple omelets at home that were light years better than their omelet's. It's an omelet for cryin' out loud,  it's not that hard.  Two of us had omelets-- I ordered a mushroom and cheese (with egg whites) which I asked for with spinach. I got a mixed vegetable omelet with no cheese and it was not made of egg whites.  That's fine-- there's nothing bad about a mixed veggie omelets.  Except for the fact that the omelet looked more like terrible, grey scrambled eggs in the shape of an omelet.  Fine again-- looks can be deceiving.  So I ate it. It tasted really bad. It just tasted like very poorly done eggs (almost under cooked), and there was no seasoning (like they forgot salt and pepper). I tried to finish it but physically could not (neither did my friends).My friends ordered a Chorizo and cheese omelet (sounds awesome right??) and sausage crepes.  The eggs were the same as mine, strangely scrambled, and the color was neon orange. We were all very confused.  The crepes seemed like they would be the winner, but they looked like they were made by someone who had never seen a crepe before in their life.  And validated by the friend who had them-- they were nothing special and extremely greasy--Just like the sides of potato we all had that were extremely bland!BOTTOM LINE: The menu looks like it would be great place to have a leisurely brunch, but it's not! I never write reviews, but I felt I had to share this since the disparity from what I expected for downtown Hoboken, and what I actually had were so incredibly disparate. I could think of giving it 3 stars I GUESS, since the food didn't have dead insects or something in it, but that would be generous. Not only that they got my order wrong and the service was, EH. Don't support terrible food that has a front of being good because of --just make some eggs at home or go to a diner.",La Bouche Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"French,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Sandwiches"

144,FOACqJ-xGyNOLeEOcGRtMw,Jenna W.,4.0 star rating,"Automatic 5 stars -  because this place shares a name with one of the greatest one-hit-wonders of all time. Deducted a star for service - I thought everything was generally pretty slow. Also deducted a star because my panini had only a little bit of meat/cheese/spinach on it. I was hoping for a bit more. It tasted good, but it was a bit weak for a panini. I did, however, try my friend's iced hot chocolate - AMAZING! It was my first taste of this chocolatey goodness and I absolutely love it now. Adding one star back on for cute decor and comfy seating. Great local spot for breakfast - stick to eggs or something like that.",La Bouche Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"French,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Sandwiches"
145,eq5NroaO1nSpTwJ1BksVMw,Emily T.,2.0 star rating,"I WANTED to love this place.. but in retrospect, just ok. Frankly, the food was somewhat unmemorable and service was quite poor. Or maybe the service was poor enough to make the food unmemorable. At any rate, it seemed like the server was blatantly ignoring us at some points; they double-charged my card and weren't prompt to fix it. Maybe it was an off-day.For someone in visiting, I don't know that this is the place to go. For anyone in the area, its a nice change to some of the more standard brunch options. Maybe they'll sort their service issues as time goes on. I'll be curious to see how they end up doing through the year as outdoor seating closes out.",La Bouche Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"French,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Sandwiches"

The turkey meat wasn't your standard deli-sliced turkey--it was think cut and probably cooked there. In any case it was delicious. The flavors worked really well together. I also had a cup of coffee and it was very good.What I like so much about this place is that it's different from the standard Hoboken fare. It's the kind of place that you can go to by yourself and read a paper. The decor is cute and comfortable. And the food (omelettes, crepes, etc.) is exactly what you want it to be--well priced, interesting,  simple, yet creative.This is a perfect place to meet friends for brunch. Please go here!

152,bG_OdPxsai7tfKMWJIDjiA,Tate E.,2.0 star rating,"My wife and I spent the weekend in Hoboken, and read the reviews so decided on breakfast here.  Very small and cozy place, made us feel very comfortable.  There were about 5-6 workers behind the counter, not really sure what they were all doing, but only one waitress, who seemed overwhelmed.  She could have used a hand from somebody else, but none of her coworkers jumped in.  It took about 10 minutes to even take our order, coffee and omelets for each of us.She delivered some sliced bread with dipping oil while we waited.  Coffee was delivered after a bit, and it was fine.  Then the omelets showed up another ten minutes later.  My coffee was done, and she did not even stop long enough to ask if I wanted a refill.  Now this place is small enough that you can almost shake hands from your table with just about everybody else in the place.  But with that, nobody was checking on the customers.  The waitress had to do everything, including cleaning the tables.The omelets looked like they were made from quail eggs, not chicken eggs.  This was the smallest omelet either of us has ever seen, and it only had some greens on the plate, no potatoes or anything else.  They tasted fine but we had to ask for more bread just to make it a more filling meal.  That was the last attention we had from the waitress.  I even had to go up to the counter to ask for our check.Leaving still hungry, and both of us needed another cup for coffee, we went up to Washington and stopped at the German bakery around 5th or 6th.  Had GREAT coffee, and Something else to eat.So, LaBouche is ok for cozy conversation, but that is really all I would recommend here.",La Bouche Cafe,3.5 star rating,$$,"French,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Sandwiches"
