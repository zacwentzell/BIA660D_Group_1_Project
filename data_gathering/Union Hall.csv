It's a nice ambiance with a very trendy feel. On a Saturday afternoon, it was very crowded and everyone had their signature BIG drink in a mason jar. I highly recommend the U.H. Brunch Punch - it was an amazing mix of alcohols and juices, and it definitely did the job. We were all feeling it!The $24 brunch prix-fixe is a STEAL - you get your choice of 4 small dishes with the BIG drink, and the food was good portioned and high quality. I love the tastings idea - the whole table shared all of the dishes and thought every single one was fantastic. I will absolutely be back here - highly recommend for brunch!",Union Hall,3.5 star rating,$$,Gastropubs

Then, we decided to order a bunch of small plates for the table. We realized afterwards that we had ordered too much for three of us but I'm glad we got to try a bunch of different plates. We had the French onion soup Mac and cheese bites (absolutely delicious, especially with the dipping sauce), the cauliflower fried rice (loved this!), two of the sliders (both good), the calamari, French fries, and the oven roasted tomato flatbread. The only thing we didn't like was the flatbread, which tasted like a frozen pizza at best. However, everything else was amazing! Francis was our server and he was very attentive.

Beef tartare was refreshing with the special sauce adding a nice hint of sweetness and creamy texture. Cauliflower ""fried rice"" was very interesting in that the texture really did mimic fried rice. However, being all vegetable there was a lot of excess liquid; a little too wet for a proper stir fry. The chimichurri hanger steak was also a treat for texture lovers as the crispy onions, seared steak and soft roasted vegetables made for a great combination. Steak was cooked to the desired medium rare. A nice sauce would have been nicer than the compound butter and the brioche at the bottom seemed unnecessary.

9,GRY2acZtI5q4P1KdCWhcUQ,Dave F.,4.0 star rating,"Randomly found myself here on a Saturday for some college football, beer, and brunch. Let's start off my saying this place has some of the best deals for drinks in Hoboken for brunch. $1 beer mugs, $2 mimosa / Bloody Mary's. Most dishes around +/- $10, which is also excellent for Hoboken, and eve more so on the waterfront. What surprised me here was how good and interesting the food was, while still being really cheap as well. The chicken and waffle are basically chicken in a waffle made in the shape of a corn dog with a maple dipping sauce. I loved this. The bacon and egg flatbread with truffle was equally awesome, with thick diced bacon and a nice truffle flavor. Even the salad was excellent. Considering the amount of food we ordered and drinks we had, the bill for 4 adults and 2 children with a lot of food and a lot of drink came well under $100, including tax and tip. This place is one of the best deals in Hoboken, and actually has quality, interesting food. I'm adding this to the regular rotation.",Union Hall,3.5 star rating,$$,Gastropubs

The space is large with a cool indoor bar and then ample patio seating. We must've gotten there right when they were opening, no hostess around to seat us. Stood a bit awkwardly for a few and some that looked like a manager told us to sit wherever. We grabbed a spot out front. Our server was friendly, but was soft spoken and mumbled his words. So was hard to understand some of the specials he told us about. He also explained the concept of the place, essentially tapas style and everything Is suggested to share. We ordered drinks and apps. For food we had the cauliflower fried rice, the hot chicken, and French onion mac n cheese bites. Chicken was disappointing. More like some type of chicken nugget with no heat served in a waffle cone bowl. Definitely recommend the cauliflower fried rice. But, also felt like it was something I could replicate at home.

There is a Sunday brunch special: $24 for 4course and unfinishable mega ""ball jar"" of normal brunch alcohol niceties which looked awesome at other tables but we chose to go a la carte with salmon toast, avocado toast, burgers, flatbread and lobster rolls.    Toasts were great, burgers were messy but very good.    Over all food was above average but noise and service takes the marks down.Food: 7 Decor: 5 (stadium noise hurts) Service: 5 Would I return again: 63pct.",Union Hall,3.5 star rating,$$,Gastropubs

Luckily a group just left so we didn't have to wait too long for a table.Everything here is served tapas style so it's good to come with a group so you can try a bunch of different stuff. We had a group of 4 people and the waitress suggested we order 5 dishes to share. We ordered the cinnamon roll pancakes, avocado toast, smoked salmon toast, pigs & peach flatbread, and 2 orders of chicken & waffle dogs (as recommended by the waitress).Cinnamon roll pancakes - they were..okay...Avocado Toast - only came with 1 toast so was kind of hard to share with 4 peopleSmoked Salmon Toast - same as avocado toast (also the bread they used was kind of hard and made it difficult to cut and share)Pigs & Peach flatbread - the flatbread was REALLY hardChicken & Waffle dogs - the waffle was AMAZING (smelled good, tasted good) but the ""chicken"" part of it... not so much... it didn't even look or taste like chicken... odd..I also ordered the fresh pressed juice - small glass but tasted extra healthy!",Union Hall,3.5 star rating,$$,Gastropubs

We ordered a spread of appetizers and while I didn't taste them all, I highly recommend the meat/cheese board, French friends and hummus.

Good views of the city.Not so good - the food was generally pretty meh.  Gnocchi consistency was off, pork belly was dry.  Wings were pretty solid but only got 2 for like 12 bucks... Speaking of prices, 8 dollar beers generally.. not epically high but they need to get their shit together if they want to charge that.So kind of a mixed bag the first time out.  I'll try it again but no need for a special trip.",Union Hall,3.5 star rating,$$,Gastropubs

Let's start off my saying this place has some of the best deals for drinks in Hoboken for brunch. $1 beer mugs, $2 mimosa / Bloody Mary's. Most dishes around +/- $10, which is also excellent for Hoboken, and eve more so on the waterfront. What surprised me here was how good and interesting the food was, while still being really cheap as well. The chicken and waffle are basically chicken in a waffle made in the shape of a corn dog with a maple dipping sauce. I loved this. The bacon and egg flatbread with truffle was equally awesome, with thick diced bacon and a nice truffle flavor. Even the salad was excellent. Considering the amount of food we ordered and drinks we had, the bill for 4 adults and 2 children with a lot of food and a lot of drink came well under $100, including tax and tip. This place is one of the best deals in Hoboken, and actually has quality, interesting food. I'm adding this to the regular rotation.",Union Hall,3.5 star rating,$$,Gastropubs

The space is large with a cool indoor bar and then ample patio seating. We must've gotten there right when they were opening, no hostess around to seat us. Stood a bit awkwardly for a few and some that looked like a manager told us to sit wherever. We grabbed a spot out front. Our server was friendly, but was soft spoken and mumbled his words. So was hard to understand some of the specials he told us about. He also explained the concept of the place, essentially tapas style and everything Is suggested to share. We ordered drinks and apps. For food we had the cauliflower fried rice, the hot chicken, and French onion mac n cheese bites. Chicken was disappointing. More like some type of chicken nugget with no heat served in a waffle cone bowl. Definitely recommend the cauliflower fried rice. But, also felt like it was something I could replicate at home.

We ordered the cinnamon roll pancakes, avocado toast, smoked salmon toast, pigs & peach flatbread, and 2 orders of chicken & waffle dogs (as recommended by the waitress).Cinnamon roll pancakes - they were..okay...Avocado Toast - only came with 1 toast so was kind of hard to share with 4 peopleSmoked Salmon Toast - same as avocado toast (also the bread they used was kind of hard and made it difficult to cut and share)Pigs & Peach flatbread - the flatbread was REALLY hardChicken & Waffle dogs - the waffle was AMAZING (smelled good, tasted good) but the ""chicken"" part of it... not so much... it didn't even look or taste like chicken... odd..I also ordered the fresh pressed juice - small glass but tasted extra healthy!",Union Hall,3.5 star rating,$$,Gastropubs

Good views of the city.Not so good - the food was generally pretty meh.  Gnocchi consistency was off, pork belly was dry.  Wings were pretty solid but only got 2 for like 12 bucks...

If I didn't think it would be weird if I went back again tonight after just being here last night I would be there in a second . They have a great happy hour and each day of the week they have different specials after the happy hour ends which is awesome. I'm a wine snob. I always like to try a restaurants house wine because it says a lot about them. It's easy to find a good expensive wine. It's hard to find a good wine with a good price--and their house Pinot Grigio was SO good! (Also try their wine punches mmmm). And I digress...onto ambience and food. First: our waiter Chris was awesome. Super friendly and sociable. Willing to take the time to explain the idea of the restaurant and give us some suggestions. We too pretty much all his suggestions and they were soooo good! This restaurant is a small plate/sharing type spot which I love so if you aren't into that this isn't your place. I highly recommended the cheese board, Olives, oysters ($1 during happy hour), Brussels sprout Caesar salad, French onion mac and cheese bites (but you need to drizzle the French onion reduction on top/dip them in it- delish and a big part of the dish), the gnocchi and mutz (not up to par with a good Italian restaurant gnocchi but still good), and last but not least (and my personal FAV) the peach and pig flatbread...drooling just thinking about it . Was too full to try and dessert but I will most definitely be back and i will be trying plenty of them!! Honestly they just opened 2 weeks ago and I can't believe how great everything last night was. My only suggestion: let dogs find outside! I mean they kind of do. The dogs have to be on the outside of the fence which is fine. But they said it was because they served food but hey the ainsworth and house of que both let the dogs inside the outdoor eating area so not sure if that's an actual rule!

If I were still in my 20's, then this place would be perfect for getting your buzz on before hopping onto the Path Train and heading into the Manhattan. I will say that the club/lounge vibe was kind of cool. The music was a loud mix of today's tunes and late 90s/early 00s hits. The drinks were pretty standard.

Lobster bun was dry and didn't taste fresh, bread was a little stale. Breakfast taco was decent. Eggs Benedict were actually over seasoned for such a small plate. Worst of all was the avocado toast - didn't even finish it. Bread was so stale and soggy it couldn't be cut with the knife on the table. Not only was the toast stale but the avocado was bland and topped with like 6 tomatoes minimal salt and pepper. Seemingly easy dishes they failed miserably at getting right.

I also primarily handle PR for restaurant openings in the city. I finally made it into Union Hall, excited to check out the newest spot on the waterfront. My initial thought was disappointment. The restaurant was empty for a Wednesday, but they were so short-staffed it was still a 15-20 minute way for one of the many seats available. I understand that they can't sit you 'just anywhere' because you need to be waited on and lack of staff will make that difficult -- so we sat at the bar for quicker service.Ordered a 902, excited to see a local beer on tap, but it took another 15 minutes to get a pint that wasn't mostly foam. The bartender was kind enough to offer me the drink for free, knowing the long wait, but when I finally received the beer it was flat. We ordered the below and my notes are next to each:- Veggie Gyro Sliders - lacked flavor and the patty was so small it was only in the last bite. - Lobster slider - where was the lobster? It was mostly celery with a hint of lobster, and actually tasted more like a tuna sandwich than lobster. Also the bun wasn't seasoned at all... maybe a quick brush of butter would have helped? - Grilled Octopus - the only good thing we ate, but not enough octopus for the price. It came with two pieces on a bed of cucumber salad. The dish itself needed more acid - maybe some lemon? But the two pieces were uneven so if sharing this with someone, one would get a nice large piece and another would get a toothpick sized piece. - Cauliflower Fried Rice - my guests enjoyed this dish, but all i tasted was soy sauce. It was one-note without any other flavors... just soy sauce. All soy sauce. I'd rather make something better at home.- French fries - for $6 you'd think you would get a nice big pile of french fries. What we received was a tiny basket filled with stick fries, similar to McDonald's small size fry. It was a bit upsetting to see such a tiny little serving of that style fry for so much money.Overall the staff was VERY kind and efficient, but the food itself was severely lacking flavor. I won't be returning.",Union Hall,3.5 star rating,$$,Gastropubs
75,C5z3ZVj8wAxxr7xsIO0rcA,Jessica M.,2.0 star rating,"I've visited Union Hall once before my dining experience tonight. My time spent previously at the bar was mediocre although the bartender was pleasant and friendly. My evening was spent with my brother and parents. We all ordered a variation of items from the menu including some of the waiter's suggestions, which frankly should have been kept to himself. The waiter may have been new and the service was terrible. We only received one refill of the water vase before having to track him down and ask for more. All of the waitstaff that night we're very cold and there was no greeting upon entry nor exit of our meal.While the menu read appetizing (I'm biased because it's very pork belly based) food was not worth the trip. Very overpriced for the quality of our meal. I would not return for food but the atmosphere is pleasant enough to return for drinks for a nice cool evening by the water.",Union Hall,3.5 star rating,$$,Gastropubs
76,PxCSXjAbU9vzD7XailqEww,Victoria P.,3.0 star rating,"I really wanted to love this place.... but it needs a lot of improvement. I don't think they were quite ready to open yet.1) could use more experienced waitstaff - waiter did not understand the beer we were trying to order2) had to wait 15 minutes for a table even though the inside was empty and there were open tables on the patio3) food could be improved. It wasn't bad but I'm not craving anything enough to come back On the positive though, the space looks amazing and the waitstaff was very friendly. If they want to survive in a trendy, fast paced city like Hoboken though, a lot of improvements need to be made.",Union Hall,3.5 star rating,$$,Gastropubs

The food was good, I Loved the mixed slider trio appetizer. But I have to say, the service was SLOW. So slow that it took 2 1/2 hours for our whole meal (apps, dinner & dessert). I think that's a bit too long, but I think it's because it was their opening week. Hope they work out the kinks by my next visit! This restaurant definitely has potential.",Union Hall,3.5 star rating,$$,Gastropubs

From the brussel sprouts salad, to the flat bread to the ice water without ice cubes I was let down by the quality of the food. The waiter was nice but things took a long while to show up. We also had to change tables because the AC air through the vents was so strong it was very uncomfortable to eat in those conditions.

We were pleasantly surprise in the quality of the dishes and the great service and staff. The prices match perfect with the quantity and quality of food!

My two friends and I ordered the chicken meetballs, cauliflower rice, the kale Brussels Caesar salad, and a tomato flatbread . Everything was delicious and came out really quickly. It's tapas style so the portions were small and meant to be shared. We got all of that plus 3 cocktails for only $75. Our waiter was so friendly and helpful too, he could tell my friend didn't like her drink and immediately fetched another- no questions asked.

Lots of food options for all different palates. Service was fantastic too! As far as Hoboken restaurants go, it's a keeper!! We had the Brussels sprout salad, truffle bacon egg and cheese flat bread, hot chicken and waffles and the onion soup mac and cheese bites. For desert we had the churro sundae and milk shake of the day :) Everything was hot, fresh and great quality! I was skeptical about another bar type place in Hobo (b/c let's be honest that's the last thing that hoboken needs) but this was totally different! Great price too! Often with small plate type places you leave hungry and feel like you spent a ton. Will def go back!",Union Hall,3.5 star rating,$$,Gastropubs

We also had to remind our waitress for food items and drinks several times. Even though we had a reservation for 7pm, we were still told that we would have to wait because there were people on the list ahead of us. It wasn't a problem since we were sitting at some bar stools, but I'd be hesitant to come on the weekend.

97,TUncyHbIm1l-22YP6M7B-g,Samantha G.,3.0 star rating,"Came in for small plates a few weeks ago. Nice makeover from the old Trinity spot.  Food and drinks were good to average. Service was a somewhat slow for such a quiet hour(seemed like an after dinner lull at least on the floor, bartenders/servers chatting with a specific group or customer for a good chunk of time, etc). I heard the owner/manager fools around w some of the female staff so maybe that's part of it but I figured that sort of thing happens in the food/bar industry all the time.  There's a good draft and wine list. Food wise we split octopus(mostly fine, a couple killed and rubbery pieces), French onion soup Mac and cheese bites(good, would be even better in the winter!), and a flatbread breakfast sort of pizza(decent).",Union Hall,3.5 star rating,$$,Gastropubs
98,-h9jBwfnp3tA8RF_CQulXg,K R.,3.0 star rating,"Had never been and tried for Restaurant Week. Was on the more crowded side for a Thursday but to be expected. Everyone was nice but it felt like they were missing some key processes. We ordered the complementary wine pairings (4 glasses - one for each course) plus a drink, initially, to have while waiting for food. The order came as follows (party of 4): 3 of us received pairings #1, 1 of us received initial drink #1, 1 of us received pairing #2, all of us received apps, 3 of us received pairing #2 and poor person receives initial drink and pairing #1, first course came out for all and one order was off, we started ordering drinks ad hoc because pairings were so unreliable and some of us had three in front of us while others were finishing off a single 3oz pour. One entre was wrong, one entre ordered medium well came rare, one dessert came out wrong, 3 meals they took our silverware while clearing so we couldn't eat next course. I came for the company, which was great, and it was such a sweet location with a view that I'd consider going again, but probably not for a while. Not the typical Restaurant Week experience you expect as I've been going for 6+ years to new spots and always feel like restaurants use the time to promote signature dishes and great service and this fell a bit flat. Regarding food, was OK. Not bad (once orders were straightened out), but definitely not so great its worth having botched orders show up out of order.",Union Hall,3.5 star rating,$$,Gastropubs
