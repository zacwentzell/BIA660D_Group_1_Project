I agree that it can be hit or a miss if you're getting anything other than a croissant or pastry. Mornings are pretty rushed and the two ladies behind the counter try their best to meet the barrage of mommy groups, out and about professionals and everyone else in between. Still nothing can come close to their chocolate tart, chocolate croissant and almond croissant. The upstairs can be a refuge in the afternoons if you manage to snag a spot. I like that they are very family friendly and have space for babies to crawl and a bunch of toys to keep them occupied. #winningOther pluses: clean restrooms, free WiFi and water jugs aplenty.

I am often in Hoboken so i tried several of their products . Some are ok some are really not my taste but it depends from the day. Sometimes the stuff is overcooked or burn out example at times baguettes are well done sometimes they give you overcooked baguettes. Same happens with croissants and brioche. Often their brioches are overcooked and so hard outside and dry inside I can't eat them! Everybody knows they should feel soft and fragrant with a buttery texture. Check pictures of this small brioche. they should really check their oven. I am a frequent buyer at Lafayette Cafe/Boulud/Recolte/Kayser/F.Payard and Balthazar and many others. The place is chaos on weekends and the price is high respect to location.

I was able to narrow it down to four pastries and as an added bonus, if you spend $10 or more, you get a free drink!I got the classic name-sake Chocopain ($3.15), Apple Petit Kouign ($3.20), Mini boule au chocolat, and another one that isn't listed on the menu but I will include in my pictures. For my free drink, I chose a Café au lait which was perfect for a chilly day (well, chilly for this Southern California girl). I've eaten three out of the four and my favorite was the apple petit kouign. I really wish I bought more than one but it was a last-minute decision to push me over the edge of $10. The disappointment was the boule. I think because it was out in the open air, it got very tough and difficult to eat.

I stopped in on my way to the local Pinot's Palette in adorable Hoboken... I needed a quick lunch and something warm to drink to get me through the evening and had been food-dreaming about this place since I'd strolled past the day before.  The cases were filled with delectables including, croissants, kuoign amann, baguettes, sandwiches and quiches.  Hot coffee drinks and teas covered their drink menu.  I opted for a slice of the quiche lorraine and was ever so glad I did... They warmed the slice up for me and the very kind and friendly woman with the sweet French accent who took my order brought it to me when ready.  It literally melted in my mouth.  Heaven. Pure cream, egg, cheese, ham heaven... I also got myself a couple of ham & cheese croissants to take for the following day, as I expected to be snowed into my hotel  She assured me they would be open despite the weather, but alas, I was not staying in walking distance from the shop (my waistline is probably grateful for that too!) and had to bis adieu... The croissants were also as amazing as expected, flaky and loaded full of rich baked buttery goodness, and left me wondering if I'll ever get to visit my new-found bakery love in the future... If so, I will certainly tell her ""Amour de ma vie...Toi et moi, ça ne changera pas""...",Choc O Pain,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bakeries,, Coffee, &, Tea,, French"

It's a great place to work, as they offer free wifi and plenty of outlets.

Need to get to Choc o Pain prior to 1pm on Saturdays if I have any chance of successfully getting what I actually set out to get in the first place (such as, for example, the pastry after which the bakery is named, a chocopain). In my experience, the store sells out of most of its popular menu items fairly early in the day, at least on weekends. Today, I ordered the Croissant jambon emmental and a chocopain, but both were sold out, so I wound up getting the Baguette jambon beurre emmental and an almond chocopain. While I was disappointed that my first choices were unavailable (which has been the case previously as well) I cannot at all say that I was disappointed with the food that I ended up with - this place has fantastic food, bread, and baked goods/pastries, which is probably why they sell out of everything so early in the day. To date, I have thoroughly enjoyed everything I have tried there, but I only wish that they made more of everything so that it would be possible to try more!

They had smells that would seep into the apartment and also played loud music at odd hours. My friends are extremely reasonable people and tried to work with the business to amend this. However, it did not pan out. They have thankfully since moved out of Hoboken (for other reasons...not because of this place, to be fair).I obviously have very limited power in this situation, but am hoping that the owners will read this review and think about how to build better relationships with future tenants.

Check. We ordered a couple of hot chocolates, figuring these had to be good given the cafe's namesake. Fail. I'm not sure what happened, but the first sip produced such a bitter taste in my mouth, literally. I gave it a second swig, thinking maybe it was just the foam. Still bitter. I don't mind my dark chocolate to be a little strong, this was just a combination of bitter and lack of flavor, if that makes sense. I threw it out after that second swig, too worried to go back and ask for another one because one of the kids was in pre meltdown mode. On the recommendation of one of the workers, I also tried a chocolate short bread pastry. She told me it was chewy, which I don't mind.

Gave me many recommendations, and even asked if I need water while I was studying! 3) prices here are just a little expensive, but I think it's worth it for the quality of the food/the experience you get here.

I just believe that they have to have a strong objective and succeed at meeting it. And what this coffee shop/bakery does, it does well. The second you walk in, you are transported from Jersey to Paris. It's not ""Hey, this place is trying to be like a French bakery!"" It's more like, ""Wait, how did I get to Paris? What's going on? Did I Apparate here?"" My friend, who studied abroad in Paris for a semester, immediately began freaking out. Everything from the writing on the walls to the cute little baguette sandwiches just oozes with authenticity. But it's not just the aesthetics that rock. Cripes. For lunch, I picked one of the simplest things: the egg sandwich with spinach and ricotta on 6-grain sandwich bread. It sounded slightly dull, but the other sandwich options contained massive quantities of bread that I knew would over-fill me. However, I got the surprise of my life from my humble sandwich; it was incredibly flavorful. The bread was astounding (so nutty and fresh), and fillings were perfectly seasoned to enhance the flavors of the ingredients, which sounds odd considering neither eggs, ricotta, NOR spinach are naturally that flavorful. And the coffee. Hands down one of the best soy lattes I've ever had. I ended up ordering a second one, which is not something I typically do.

After asking the server what she recommended and getting ""everything!"" (thanks, Unhelpful Ulga), I decided to just bite the bullet and try a few things: a croissant, a banana sourdough, and, of course, the chocopain.The croissant was decidedly good. The layers perfectly filled with butter and cooked to that delightful border between chewy and crisp. The banana sourdough was pretty good as well, but that bread was tough. Like seriously.

The best part is, if you want sweetness you have all the choices staring at you from the glass cases --- drool... BUT, if you want savory, there is also the Ham and Cheese Croissant, which I highly recommend.

This bread is very close to the best Italian bread I ever had-by the legendary Zito's in Greenwich Village (it was open around 70 years but closed over a decade ago). I am certainly not a French bakery expert, but everyone knows the French set the bar very high on quality. This place has so many customers speaking French, I often close my eyes and pretend I'm in Paris. A tiny bit of Paris in Hoboken. But that's what I've grown to love about Hoboken.

195,MJ7Ea7mxtslLN0-fW2Y19w,Kathy O.,1.0 star rating,"I've gone to this Choc O Pain in Hoboken for years--it's pleasant enough. Not amazing, as the food tends to be on the bland side--even the desserts. Or the  desserts are over-baked and this is a  pricey cafe. Frankly, it's a bit over-rated simply because there is no other similar establishment. That is why I have gone there all these years -out of convenience. Also the owner is so nice--and it's a shame. I am never going back there again. Last week I bought a quiche slice for breakfast, and decided to also buy their egg and ricotta sandwich for lunch. I rush to grab the 12PM- 126 bus to Port Authority to catch an upstate NY bus commute for 2 hours, and thought it would be nice to get lunch beforehand to take on 2-hour bus. I could see the sandwich had no dressing--(remember I said the food tends to be bland,) and so, I asked for mayo on the side. I spent 5 MINUTES arguing with a server about mayo!  First she said-they ""don't have those little packets."" I was peeved-- I knew I was not in McDonald's. I said patiently--""Yes, I know, but you can put it in a small container. Then she said ""We don't have those containers!"" Then she said, ""We don't have mayo.""  I said. ""I can't believe this."" I explained the sandwich was without dressing looked pretty dry. I said ""I will pay for it.""  I pulled out a dollar. She said ""I would not even know what to charge you."" finally she said --let me see what I can do. She went in the backI explained to the cashier -that ""I was relieved that the server was going to bring mayo for my sandwich because she had said initially -that they had none.""  The cashier acted as if she was really sorry.  ""I am so sorry,""  the cashier sighed--shaking her head sadly, -""She's right. We don't have mayo. We have a vinaigrette.""  But the server was walking towards me with a tiny container of mayo! I said ""Sure--you do --she's bringing it!""  The cashier disappeared after the server with the mayo and the server reappeared but with oil and vinegar.   The mayo was gone.  I was so upset--all this dishonesty---and fuss ---and lying over a  TEASPOON OF MAYO------I grabbed the sandwich so as not to be late for work..  I immediately called on my cell -to speak to the owner who was not there. I complained--""Why did the cashier TAKE AWAY the mayo? I have come here for years.""  ""Okay next time you come---we'll give it to you.""  was the response.  Another lie?   I said--""I am right here. I can take it now."" 20 minutes after originally asking for mayo--I finally got it. But I could still hear a male in the kitchen saying ""Tell her there isn't any."" The irony was -I wound up getting stomach cramps  over the quiche--I guess it was too rich? And 2 hours later, the oil and vinegar spilled over the sandwich--- I never got to use the mayo, and the bread part was surprisingly like an Italian-like bread.  Without it--the sandwich was just awful---just think of unseasoned fried  underdone egg white and unseasoned ricotta--and their combined similar textures--on bread. Bland as hell.  Ordinarily I would go back and buy the bread and vinaigrette--But the dishonesty--and wasted time over a stupid teaspoon of mayo to perk up a sandwich-that I was willing to pay for. That left a bad taste. And the cashier actually taking away the mayo after lying and saying there was none. And after I waited for it. I'd been a customer for  almost a decade. Thy charged me 54 cents for the mayo..NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN.

My first visit here, I managed to spend around $70 for a bag of goodies.The staff is very nice, accommodating. Even if it's packed, they don't try to push you out the door.  Since it was my first visit, I had asked what each item had (if the little sign didn't specify) and the staff answered all of my questions.The cutest part: the packaging! For the tarts and the quiche, they used these cute little cardboard boxes if you're planning on doing take-out. I'm a sucker for packaging so if I had to choose, I'd go back on just the tiny boxes alone.Now to the best part: their quiche Lorraine! OMG to die for! They give you a thick, generous slice for the price. Once heated up, it just MELTS in your mouth. The crust was thick and flaky, YUM! The pieces of ham and veggies inside are thick, hearty and generous. It will fill you up!The good part: their apple tarts. the crust was thick and not sickeningly sweet like the grocery store-made tarts and pies. It was the perfect balance to the thin baked apple slices in the middle. I enjoyed picking off the thin pieces one by one, just to enjoy the tart a little while longer. MMM! Soft and delicious; perfectly baked and moist. Not dry in the least bit.The so-so: choc o pain. it's name-sake. you'd think it would be the best thing you've ever laid your eyes on. eh... it was EH... Just your basic pastry bread with a line of (dark/bittersweet) chocolate baked in the middle. It tastes okay heated up... JUST okay.The ""stay away from:"" the almond croissant. the first bite was good but as I went on, the filling inside was just too gooey and mushy for me to actually enjoy. I felt like I was eating wet bread dipped in almond sugar-water.. But the outside was so flaky and delicious. So I just picked off that part and threw the rest away. The ABSOLUTE NO-NO: their spicy tuna roasted sandwich. 2 THICK slabs of HARD bread over a spoon of tuna and a TON of spice. Complete waste of $10.

Only two times in my life I've thrown coffee out. I ordered a cappuccino and let's count the ways they mess up:- foaming the milk before pulling the shot of espresso - ringing me up after pulling the shot and letting the foamed milk just sit there upward of a minute to become un-foamed - no purging of steam before or after foaming the milk. So, there is no way to know if any residual milk is inside the steam wand and how old it is - didn't wipe the steam wand after foaming. Recommended practice if you want to see how long it takes milk to curdle to heated metal.- pouring a cappuccino into a 16-oz cup, double the size of a proper cappuccino. This excess was filled with rancid milk. They even offered a 'larger' size so you could have more shitty milk if you wanted to test your body's immune system.I gave this place a second chance after avoiding it for months and I'm never coming back. If you enjoy coffee avoid at all costs!With that said, the stroller bearing mothers of Hoboken inside are always smiling, so I assume that at very least the sweets are good if that's your thing.",Choc O Pain,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bakeries,, Coffee, &, Tea,, French"

They were a generous size.We couldn't leave without trying a chocolate croissant, and I'm so happy with did! It wasn't overly buttery. A little on the small side, but what we ate was well worth it.It was a little on the pricy side.

I will remind people that this is a French bakery so, while you will find filling meal options, if you want a big, meaty sandwich then I'd recommend going elsewhere. For me however they hit all the marks: * Independently owned and community oriented: The owner (short brown hair) is genuinely French, friendly & will remember you. In fact after going in only a couple of times I think most of the staff knows my face (and they do have a pretty steady stream of people in and out throughout the day)... They usually have a poster or two advertising something around town (garden tour, farmer's market, etc).* The food is great: all made in-house, the bread is AMAZING, all of the pastries and sandwiches are all very good (although, like another reviewer wrote, the chock au pain is just so-so). Be sure to check out the Roasted Veggie w/goat cheese & walnut spread and the fruit tart or just grab an iced coffee & croissant. * Great County/Parisian Ambiance: Complete an upstairs and outdoor seating. If you have kids go upstairs. There is a play area and lots of comfy seating. One thing I though was cool was child gate that you can pull across the steps so you don't have to worry about your little one going for an unwanted tumble. Having an area for kids upstairs also means that downstairs is kept nice and calm for the rest of us. There is even a smallish  (8 person) community table that is nice to site at. * Free WiFi: Haven't taken much advantage of this yet but I've seen other people on their computers.Whenever I'm having a bad day I come here and it cheers me up!",Choc O Pain,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bakeries,, Coffee, &, Tea,, French"

Amen. The Cons:*Toddler area upstairs is FILTHY AS FUCK (I am 100% sure they have never cleaned it since they opened 2 years ago- germ-a-phobe NIGHTMARE*Hmmm, they know it is a BABY/TODDLER play area upstairs yet have lots of unprotected electric outlets that toddlers continue to probe with random objects.

Seriously, get a grip. *The staff is snotty (just like the other reviews say, I am backing them up, the staff seriously need an attitude adjustment). I was thinking, since I have been to France several times and found the French to be very arrogant and snotty, perhaps the owner tells the staff ""I want this place to be authentic.

While most things are really top notch, especially the galettes I will say that there were several times that the pain au raisin was mushy when it should have been crisp and several occasions where the almond croissants were so hard, they bordered on stale. When it comes to these two items specifically, I head to Red Lion on 14th and Bloomfield. They don't bake but they do bring most things in from Balthazar Bakery and every bite of their pastry will crackle with goodness.",Choc O Pain,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bakeries,, Coffee, &, Tea,, French"
238,5TdJ9zg6_zw7OZ-leieFyQ,Ray J.,1.0 star rating,"A very sad example of pour management with a lot of attitude and the unfortunate fact of having to pay $10 for a sandwich that spills all over you because the bread its too tick and the barrista's have no clue on how to cut it or warm it up. There is a plentiful of potential in both location Hoboken and Jersey city. but the owner has done nothing of hiring underpaid employees without a single tiny bit of training. Attitude behind the bar is a must for them. they wont even smile as a courtesy. and the Credit card minimum charge of $10 in a metropolitan area is an absolute minus. many times i try to take my clients to the space and eat, there is no even service for the table, actually there is a note on every table seat, asking you to clean after yourself. Not even Starbucks does it. Serving pre-made food, specially for a daily operation is bad bad business. it lacks on quality even if it taste good. does not matter to the Metro clientele that would like not to pay $7 for a slice of Quiche or $4 for a croissant. You are not a NYC operation and you are not required to charge that much money for a steamy tong burned cappuccino. I found a friend of mine training the staff behind the bar a while back, and I ask if there was room for improvement, the answer was a shake head for a sign of discouragement. If you go in either location, often, at any time of the day, some of the items are out of stock. not sure why, since they don't really do that much business. The PLUS about these locations are - the decor. very provencal, nice setting but, it lacks on ALL the other details and attention to customer service it does not matter at all. its like driving a ferrari without wheels on it.its a Shame, a big shame, toke me 9 visits mix at both location to finally decide to say something publicly, and I hope this message gets to the owner point to take some serious action on this matter.",Choc O Pain,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bakeries,, Coffee, &, Tea,, French"

It used to be my daily stopping place when i lived in Hoboken just by Choc O Pain and after moving into NYC I very badly miss the place. The best time to get the best stuff at about 8-10 am. The croissants are very very flaky buttery and yum. The chocolate almond croissant to me is their star, fantastic almond paste, tastes true to almond and exceedingly delish. I have tried almost all french bakeries in NYC in search of a substitute and well there has been none yet forcing me to have to take the path train to get my fav choc almond croissant. Clemence i guess has managed to get the best croissants made near NYC, not trying to make an over statement here. The hot chocolate they make is also fantastic i must say. The banana bread is YUM too, something that is unique to them. Financiers sometimes come out too dry but they are more or less ok. The olive bread can be a winner with the right things on the table too. And one should take a trip to Choc O Pain during epiphany for their Galette des Rois. How I wish it  was epiphany all year long! With Patrick - the head baker at Choc O Pain, jenna (now at jersey city), michelle, and the others its a wonderful place to eat. Hard to find and negatives but somehow la'colombe does not rate as the best coffee and that can be bettered.
