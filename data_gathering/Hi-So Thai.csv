Went here on a Tuesday night and It was pretty empty, maybe 4 others inside otherwise had the place to ourselves. Ordered Tom Kha Shrimp soup (about $6) and It was delicious.

Otherwise it was delicious.Entrees ordered were Drunken noodles with chicken (about $12) and Massaman curry with chicken (about $12).The drunken noodles with chicken was a delicious dish and definitely recommended. A little spicy too which I love. The Massaman curry chicken was delicious with the curry sauce but only negative thing was potatoes that they added to the dish were under cooked.

Tofu curry was great with a hint of some spice, but the rest.... Tom Yam soup was like a veggie stew with touch of ketchup like flavor(eww), nothing like authentic Tom Yum. Drunken noodle was too mushy, and spring roll had absolutely no flavor even with their original source which was tasted like some sort of duck sauce, hmm...?  The worst part was that the service we received. When we first walked in to the place, the owner-like man was on the phone and told us to sit anywhere. The place was empty with only one couple in a spacious big room. So we grabbed a four-seat table near the window, and after we sat down, the owner-like guy came to us and said ""more coming?"" We said ""no, just us"" and he goes ""wow."" So I was like ""excuse me?"" and he goes again ""wow"" and gave us a sarcastic mean look.  He was the only staff besides a chef so he took our order and brought food but throughout our stay he never asked ""how is everything"" or said ""thank you."" On top of that, in the middle of his taking our order he went to take care of other to-go-customers and took phone calls twice...and food came out pretty slow. Wish we didn't have to leave tip but we are just not the type of people... though for sure we'd never go back there.",Hi-So Thai,4.0 star rating,$$,Thai

My best friend was coming into town and she was in the mood for Thai food. I've been to a few places in Hoboken but nothing that I would want to go back for. Parking can be tricky but we found a spot  right around the corner from the restaurant. We made the two minute walk in 7 degree weather and I already knew I wanted something hot. The place was empty when we got there but filled up by 7. The place is spacious, dim lighting, and it had nice decor. I had the Tom Yum shrimp soup-lemongrass broth with thai spices. It was perfect for the cold weather. It was a big bowl for the price ($4.95). It  only had 2 shrimps but they were delicious.  We also had steamed chicken dumplings which were so tasty along with the spicy soy dip. Finally, what i came for - Pad Thai Chicken & Shrimp ( I added shrimp- $1.00 more) - egg, bean sprout, peanut scallion all for just $10.95 and it was a lot. It was delicious, great flavors, and I finished it all. I'm not sure how...there was a lot. I made my friend take hers to go but really it was for me. She was raving about her plate which was the Pad Thai chicken & beef. For those who want something more spicy, they have plenty of options...next time I will try the Yellow curry with shrimp. So the food was great but the service was even better. We were attended to even after the place filled up. The waiter was super friendly. As previous reviews mentioned this place is CASH only. It says it in big letters on the door incase you forget.",Hi-So Thai,4.0 star rating,$$,Thai

But the drunker noodles were so delicious, 3 out of 4 of us ordered them and loved our food. My one friend ordered the coconut green curry- which was good too. But not as good as the drunken noodles!

Parking was easily found behind the restaurant. We had lunch on Sunday and the place was empty save for another couple. Tried:- Tom yum soup. Good. Slightly sweet. Big, plump shrimp with lots of veggies (the clean kind, not the kind you avoid eating from Asian restaurants).- Papaya salad. Also very good. The portion is pretty good so I took the rest home. It gets very watery so drain first!- Massaman curry. Also good. Not sure if it comes with rice but we had ordered a side of sticky rice to eat separately and had to order a rice for this.- Pad see ewe. Had the beef. It was very good and as someone else mentioned, had a bit of char which I think is necessary. Service was great. I will definitely be coming back and will be testing out their delivery one of these days. The interior is decorated and spacious. You do see a lot of cars whizzing by due to their location.

Dim lighting, cute decor, wide windows, big tables, etc. Actually, the tables were really big, so you felt far away from the person you're sitting across, but it wasn't a big deal. This would be great for groups or if you get appetizers so you don't have to do an awkward plate shuffle when your other dishes come out. I went at 6:30 on a Saturday, though, and the place was EMPTY. It was me and one other party there. I thought that was odd, but anyway...The service was mediocre. The waitress was very nice, but it probably took her about 15 to 20 minutes to take our order after we sat down. Very odd especially because we were the only ones in there... Also they didn't give straws with our glasses of water.The food came out VERY quickly. This may be a personal thing, but I like when there's a little bit of a wait for the food to come out. For me, it builds a sense of anticipation and that extra bit of hunger that makes your food taste better. Our food came out in about 5 minutes, so there was little of that anticipation to build, but again, that's just me.Food was delicious! I got the drunken noodles. Great presentation, decent portion size, just the right amount of spicy. It came out hot, the veggies were cooked to perfection, chicken was yummy, and the noodles had a great texture. In the end, I would go here again if I was craving Thai food, but if someone suggested another place I wouldn't fight to go back here (but if someone suggested here I wouldn't be mad).

Yelp reviewers please read:  It's fine to leave stars for good service, and while I was not dining in, I can't speak to the service... But the food I received can best be described as stale, tough, and drenched in cheap corn oil.  I placed my order at 6pm, so here, there is no reason for a lack of freshness or for a soaked-quality.  I don't want to hurt someone's struggling business, but the truth is, unless Yelp reviewers have standards, and give accurate reviews, the app becomes useless, and poor quality food/service has no motivation to improve.  Why not rate a place as ""great service, poor quality food"" or as ""needs help, has potential"" if we need to protect the feelings of struggling owners maybe cutting corners.  But please take a different approach than to praise inedible refuse... Call it what it is and find another outlet for placating their hurt feelings... Maybe send flowers and a list of improvements they could make... but let Yelp live and have value.  I'm visiting Hoboken and I need a reliable resource for good food here.  Many highly-rated places have some very terrible reviews and it doesn't make sense.  I have to read pages and pages to learn and decide, instead of being able to see the stars and get some idea.",Hi-So Thai,4.0 star rating,$$,Thai

All of the noodles were on the bottom and the shrimp and vegetables basically they threw right on the top... i want to say that the noodles were like 95% of the dish which gives the appearance that you're getting a lot but you're actually getting a little... i mean yes its a noodle dish i get it, but i sorta would like all the vegetables and the shrimp to be mixed in so you get a lil noodle, vegetable and shrimp with each bite... and give me more vegetables and a bit more shrimp... the noodle which is essentially high glycemic index and wont really keep me full... so anyways.. i'm not coming back here.",Hi-So Thai,4.0 star rating,$$,Thai

Pad Thai A+ (PERFECT amount of sweet and spicy) I just put a little bit more spice but I'm from Pakistan we like stuff spicy (even Pizza and Omelet)Red Curry with Shrimp- Another A+ SO GOOD! Tom Yum Soup and Noodle Tofu soup were both good--- Tom Yum as usual is very sour and spicy so my mother, sister and I (all of different spice levels) agreed to mix the noodle broth soup with Tom Yum for amazing concoction. Don't recommend that to everyone folks, but it works out well if you're with family!  We also had fresh coconut juice, with actual shaved coconut chunks in it, and a Thai Iced Tea (i've had better/creamier, so not my fav). I was tempted to give it five stars, but remembered the service was VERY slow. She was nice, just alone with three-four tables to manage.... I will DEFINITELYYYY be back.

As expected, parking was easy to find, though we had to park on a side street around the back of the restaurant.Hungry and with our bottle of chardonnay in hand, we walked into a completely empty restaurant. We hesitated for a moment, wondering why the heck a place would be so empty at prime dining hour on a Saturday night.The waiter seemed friendly enough, but he brought us wine glasses without a corkscrew. We sat there for a few minutes, staring at our unopened bottle of wine and wondering if we had made a terrible, terrible mistake. A private Thai dinner seemed too good to be true. We ordered a shredded green papaya salad to share. The portion was huge for a salad, and I really enjoyed the sweet tang of the dressing. For entrees, I ordered tofu pad see ew, and my boyfriend ordered shrimp pad thai (his measuring stick for judging any Thai restaurant). I appreciated the fact that the waiter double-checked with me about having egg in my dish, since I ordered it with tofu.We loved our food. The portions were just right for our hungry bellies. My boyfriend said the pad thai was even more flavorful than his favorite pad thai. I really liked my pad see ew, and I would absolutely order it again. Why doesn't anymore come here?! It's awesome!When we were finished eating, another couple entered the restaurant, confused. ""Is this place open?"" They asked. Soon after, a group of three young women arrived.

The spring greens salad was very tasty and not the simple ""side salad"" I expected. The dressing put it over the top for me. I also had the massaman curry with chicken. It was well flavored and the chicken was tended - not dry. Good job!  It didn't come with rice, so I ordered sticky rice and it paired well. The curry was closer to a broth than creamy. I'm used to creamy, but really enjoyed this. Desert was a coconut custard which was good. Will definitely come back to try more.",Hi-So Thai,4.0 star rating,$$,Thai

However, if you like to keep it consistent, the gentlemen I presume to be the owner will typically remember your favorite dish. Because he is typically the only one there around lunch, ordering can get backed up on a busy day.

We generally order from the place called five star thai in Union City which is delicious! Unfortunately, due to the weather they were closed so out of desperation I decide to go to Hi-so. Biggest mistake! I ordered drunken noodles for lunch but unfortunately they were so bland. My fiancé made the mistake of saying  not spicy which normally gives it a little kick but at hi so means tasting bland. And to top it off I think I got overcharged. No big deal it was only a buck but I hate when people try and trick others into paying more. I ordered the lunch special which was 8.95 and the Thai iced tea which was 3.50. There's no way for that mathematically add up to 14.40 with tax. I will never go there again!!!!",Hi-So Thai,4.0 star rating,$$,Thai

First off, the place is cash only which sucks when ordering take out. Secondly the food took OVER AND HOUR AND A HALF TO BE DELIVERED. I called 3 times and was told the driver was stuck in traffic. Being that I live less than a mile away I found that hard to believe.When the food did finally come, it was FREEZING cold. We had to microwave everything we ordered. I am not sure if doing this zapped all the flavor out of the food or not, but it tasted awful. The classic noodles with peanut sauce where one big brick of noodles with watered-down peanut butter on top, and the pad see ew was mostly all bok choy with a few shrimp. The chicken dumplings were more like ravioli with ground chicken inside.Like I said, I was really surprised just how bad it was after reading all of these great reviews.

I got the green papaya salad, and Penang curry with tofu. SO delicious. The salad had great seasoning with just a bit of kick. It was so crunchy and healthy and FRESH. The curry was also a little spicy, but not too bad at all. I ate every last piece of it and then soaked my rice in the sauce and ate all of that too. It was that good. I had to fight my dad over that sauce. The kaffir lime really shined through the dish.The rest of the family got the beef salad appetizer and loved it. Apparently it was really spicy and delicious. We also got the whole snapper and although it looked like it was very dry and overcooked, it was not. I heard my aunt mutter about how moist and juicy it was and it was promptly devoured. We also got the Pad-See-Ew with chicken (the flat noodles were awesome) and for dessert, pumpkin custard and banana spring rolls. They pumpkin seemed to be preferred over the spring rolls, but again, all was consumed.The only disappointment, and only because everything else was amazing, was the peanut curry.
