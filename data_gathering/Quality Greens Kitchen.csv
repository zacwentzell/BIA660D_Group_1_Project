For a short period I actually worked AND lived in Hoboken and lunch was always a struggle - good salads were often overpriced and not at all what I was used to having had access to Chop't, Sweetgreen, and Just Salad in the city.I thought about giving 4 stars because despite having 10+ people working at any one time, as the only person in the store I will sometimes wait over 10 minutes before I can even place my order, but I think it's worth it. I've learned to order ahead for pickup using GrubHub on my walk from the PATH home.My go to - salmon market plate w/ brown rice, roasted sweet potato, and maple sriracha brussels (I now have found a hack to make this at home - soOoOo delish) + side tzatziki and sriracha.",Quality Greens Kitchen,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Salad,, Gluten-Free"

Felt like good, fresh and healthy options were lacking on Washington St. and I was pleasantly surprised to see this Dig Inn-type fast casual spot open up. The inside is very spacious and immaculate with ample seating for in-store dining. They're open seven days a week and do delivery via Seamless, and market themselves on their ""craft salads, quality meats and creative vegetable dishes."" If those are their key messages, then they're hitting all of them! They also are very vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free friendly to all my health bunnies out there. Also, they serve Chloe's soft serve fruit ice cream!! They have an array of salad options from SIGNATURE SALADS ranging from $8.99 to $13.50, and CUSTOM SALADS, which start at a base price of $7. Notably, there is a CHEF'S PLATE, which I ordered, and it is most similar to a Dig Inn-style platter. It includes a protein and two sides - I ordered the wild sushi-grade SALMON ($13.50) which came with a delicious tzatziki sauce, as well as a HALF AVOCADO and MAPLE-SRIRACHA BRUSSELS SPROUTS. The Brussels sprouts were unique and delicious, sweet with a little bit of a kick, but not too spicy. I also ordered a side of the MAC & CHEESE, which was tasty and creamy - loved the combination of the bechamel, cheddar, swiss and parm cheeses. My whole meal came out to about a little less than $15, which is pretty pricey for lunch, but the quality and taste of the food made it worth it.Everyone working had a great attitude and was very responsive to all the questions I had. Even though I do wish it was a little cheaper, I highly recommend this spot and will be returning.",Quality Greens Kitchen,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Salad,, Gluten-Free"

I rarely review any business, positively or negatively, but wanted to share some great customer service. I placed an online order with them but never received it. They actually reached out to verify whether I had received my order because they weren't sure it had been delivered. It hadn't, so they apologized and sent it out for free even though I had already been refunded by Seamless. This was without me even asking and I'm also not a frequent orderer from there since I had only ordered once before. I was a bit hangry when they called but the owner seemed really committed to ""making it right"" even after I told him I had zero plans to leave a negative online review. Oh and the food is legit delicious. Historically I have stopped after work at SweetGreen to pick up a salad, but Quality Inn's salmon is tastier than sg's trout + it's on my way home. I'm going to split my business from now on. The prices are in line with what I have paid at Dig Inn and sweetgreen. It is expensive to order but that's the case in Hoboken as a whole and has nothing to do with this restaurant in particular. I find that the serving sizes on the salads at Quality Greens to be very generous and can be split over two meals (for me).

3,1JDxaio4xWG1sa71GJKHsw,Evan M.,4.0 star rating,"Finally had a chance to check out this new Hoboken spot.  Quality Greens Kitchen offers lunch and dinner, from salads to full meal plates.The restaurant is very large with lofted ceilings. There are about 30 tables comfortably spaced. Seriously, they could have squeezed in another twenty tables, so if you go on the off hours, it's about as relaxed a casual dining set up as you'll get.  It's a cafeteria line set up and you can see everything going on in the kitchen. The offerings are basically two categories. First, salads that start at $7 with a wide variety of included toppings and extra-cost options. The other, a Chef's Plate consisting of a protein, rice or quinoa, and two sides and starts at $11.50.  I went for the Chef's plate with salmon ($13.50), brown rice, brussel sprouts, and mac&cheese (I know, cheater!).  The salmon was a modest portion, about 1/4 lb, skin-on filet that was cooked nicely. I'm glad I got the tztaziki on the side because I didn't care for it. The brussel sprouts were excellent, roasted and charred with a splash of sweet and spice. The mac & cheese was good but needed a little salt and pepper to pick it up.  The brown rice was cooked perfect. The lemon juice soda for $2.50, well, I know it's a healthy place, but honestly a Diet Coke would have been just fine. About $17 for everything.I have to also mention the nice staff, efficient and courteous.  I'd say I had a good first visit, 3 1/2-4 stars and I look forward to trying a few different dishes and updating the review.",Quality Greens Kitchen,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Salad,, Gluten-Free"

The food quality is great, the staff are super nice and it's really healthy. I've only been a couple of times but my boyfriend goes a lot more. He mentioned that once while he was waiting for more salmon they overcooked their newest batch (which we have all done before) and apologized and asked if he wanted to wait for another batch or get something else. I've definitely been to restaurants where they'll just serve you the overcooked salmon so this is a sign of how much they believe in quality.

Also the salmon plate for under $15 seemed like a great price to me as I don't normally eat fish due to the cost. So I got the salmon chef plate which comes with rice and as my two sides I got sweet potatoes and zucchini. Everything was SO good especially salmon and sweet potatoes. I'm spoiled by my moms salmon cooking with the crispy skin but she's not cooking for the masses. Anyways very happy and can't wait to try other options!

Pick a grilled protein (Steak, Salmon, Tofu, Chicken) and then pick amongst two of their really flavorful sides. Personal favorites include the Sriracha Brussel Sprouts and Curry Cauliflower. You also get a choice if you want it over rice and Quinoa. I've now been there twice in the same week because I found myself enjoying it that much. I've tried both the Salmon (get the tzatziki on top) and the Steak (with the horseradish sauce on the side)  and both times I've been both full and pleasantly surprised on how flavorful everything is. It's a little on the more pricey side, expect it to be around $15-$20 per person with a drink but it's a really good meal.

I tried salad both time I was here.I ordered one of their signature salad, umami crunch. When I got home( I ordered to go) realized they forgot the edamame. Overall it's still good, love the chicken and the wonton strips.You can build your own salad, but plus with the protein and the crunch price can added way up. Really wish that they can added quinoa without charge extra ( sweetgreen spoiled me, I know), here it's extra $1.50Service could be faster, but since they just opened, I think its acceptableWill be back in the day that I'm too tired too cook , their chef plate looks promisingAnd another thing, really don't like their packaging, two times I order to go, they both spilled, hope they fixed/change this lid container in the future",Quality Greens Kitchen,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Salad,, Gluten-Free"

When I saw this place was opening I was excited as it is similar to Mulberry & Vine by my office in TriBeCa. Also the salmon plate for under $15 seemed like a great price to me as I don't normally eat fish due to the cost. So I got the salmon chef plate which comes with rice and as my two sides I got sweet potatoes and zucchini. Everything was SO good especially salmon and sweet potatoes. I'm spoiled by my moms salmon cooking with the crispy skin but she's not cooking for the masses. Anyways very happy and can't wait to try other options!

At first I thought, ""Another salad place, okay"" But then I discovered their Chef's Plates. Pick a grilled protein (Steak, Salmon, Tofu, Chicken) and then pick amongst two of their really flavorful sides. Personal favorites include the Sriracha Brussel Sprouts and Curry Cauliflower. You also get a choice if you want it over rice and Quinoa. I've now been there twice in the same week because I found myself enjoying it that much. I've tried both the Salmon (get the tzatziki on top) and the Steak (with the horseradish sauce on the side)  and both times I've been both full and pleasantly surprised on how flavorful everything is. It's a little on the more pricey side, expect it to be around $15-$20 per person with a drink but it's a really good meal.

However, each time we have ordered from here, something was left out of our salads. When you're starving and recieve your delivery that you have been so ready for, only to find that its missing an item, its not likely you feel like waiting another 20+ mins for your last ingredient. This time (tonight) my wife ordered the goat cheese salad with a side of chicken. There were only 3 pieces of chicken, which I understand when restaurants are stingy with the avocado, but chicken???? There also was no goat cheese (the main attraction, i.e Goat Cheese Salad). Is the food tasty? Yes. Are the people nice when we have called in the past? Yes. But unfortunately it seems that we can't rely on them to deliver our meal completed.

We were just looking for a small snack before meeting some folks for dinner, and didn't know what to expect.Felt welcomed instantly, Veronica greeted us and made us feel right at home and instantly found ourselves chatting about very important topics such as sriracha sauce.Since we said it was our first time here she went over the menu for us. It turned out that not only were we new to the restaurant, but that the restaurant was in fact new to Hoboken, and had only been open one or two weeks. Despite this, the food was fantastic and we found them to be extremely organized and helpful, including during peak hours. (This trip was during an off hour, but I ate there again this week in the middle of the lunch rush, and it was equally fantastic).We were very impressed as many of the features of higher-end dining yet at a build-your-own salad / chef's bowl style restaurant, where you order at the counter. Despite a casual restaurant's vibe, we were able to sample one of the chef's sides since we were indecisive, and Veronica gave us a sample of their specialty smoked sriracha sauce which she highly recommended.What we ordered:""Rosemary Roasted Chicken"" Chef's Plate, which includes choice of brown rice or quinoa plus two sides.  The most obvious aspect of the more ""gourmet"" side of this restaurant, was where were the proteins? After plating our sides, normally there is a big bowl of each protein option to add on top of our order, but we did not see any such thing. Instead, the rosemary roasted chicken is grilled chicken breast sliced to order, leaving it super tender and juicy instead of drying out like at other restaurants. This may not be obvious at first glance, but you will taste the difference. At another restaurant during peak hours the quality difference is less pronounced since they are constantly making a fresh batch to keep up with the orders, but get there at an off hour it will have been sitting out for hours! The difference is well worth it and I think this is a great improvement that the Quality Greens folks have come up with.For our two sides, we first sampled the Sauteed Squash Medley and Macaroni and Cheese, both of which were perfectly seasoned and complete on their own. We settled on the Maple-Sriracha Brussels Sprouts, were grilled and slightly charred with a sweet and slightly spicy sauce that was very flavorful, and the Roasted Sweet Potatoes, were roasted till soft and had paprika and a sweet sauce, though did not taste overly sweetened.Compared to the overall high prices in this area, we got a generous portion of chicken, plus a grain, plus two sides for just $11.50. Good value!Note: their sriracha sauce is not your classic sriracha you are used to, but I highly recommended it! It is made in-house and has the added hint of maple syrup, along with a slight smoky flavor.I think there are a few small areas to be improved, which I will write in an update for my second visit, but overall 5 stars.
