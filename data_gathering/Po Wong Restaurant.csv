0,FYFmHgtLBe-FSiTnarITEg,Kelle C.,5.0 star rating,"Updating and upgrading, because it seems absurd and kind of embarrassing to only award 3 stars to a place I come to this often. The service is consistently kind and quick, the food is always fresh and good quality, and the prices are more than reasonable. Po Wong still has the absolute best wonton soup in the area, with flavorful broth, tons of noodles, and huge strips of roasted porn. They do it right here. If you've ever gone to a ""hood"" Chinese Food spot that gives you two undercooked wontons in a quart of greasy water, prepare to have your mind blown. The chicken wings are plump and juicy, always cooked perfectly. The Pu Pu platter is a great deal - everything cooked well and in generous portions considering the price. Recently started ordering delivery and pleased that the delivery guys are quick and it's packaged well. I hope Po Wong stays around a long time.",Po Wong Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

2,TFrqPrmeJ_oymMyH3z9aJA,Liz B.,1.0 star rating,"We are visiting from out of town and craving Chinese food, picked this place based on reviews. First off, we were hoping for delivery, woman didn't know address so we opted just to pick it up. When we got there the service was awful. We ordered soup, which we noticed was not in the bag, politely asked for it and she responded ""Nope, you should have ordered it earlier"" Also, yelp says they take credit cards, not true, this is cash only per same rude lady. She also yelled at my husband when he asked what kind of soda they had. Husband ordered beef and mushroom, it was bland and basically just gravy.I ordered sesame chicken, thinking you can never go wrong there, it was chewy but did have some flavor.Needless to say we ended up eating leftovers and still craving Chinese food. Wouldn't recommend this place",Po Wong Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

4,6ZNybmZfmN1y2UU1nePbIA,Salem S.,5.0 star rating,"Totally cute family owned Chinese food - the food was presented beautifully, and everything was made fresh. The restaurant itself is like a flashback to the 90s - the wood panel walls, the placemats, the chairs - it was weirdly so nostalgic and soothing lol. All in all, a great authentic Chinese restaurant!Oh I love the fact the kids have their computers on the side.",Po Wong Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

6,Vka5QJym3dTaoGla8P_RXg,Adrianna N.,2.0 star rating,This was the only Chinese restaurant with mostly good reviews so I decided to give it a try. I definitely had better in this Neighborhood and this was the worst one. The chicken wings are not crispy and not to much flavor. The beef and broccoli is really soggy. The only thing that was good was the vegetable soup.,Po Wong Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese
7,0BiK2p77RuWuuw1wpaNOlg,Karen S.,5.0 star rating,This place is amazing I've been ordering and eating here since grade school. I grew up in union city and I would say I've been eating here since I was 9 years old. I'm very close with the family who owns this place. They are great people and the chef of this place is amazing. The food you get here is not your mediocre yellow fried rice Chinese food. This place has the BEST fried rice I've ever had . I recommend their pu pu platter for party of 4 . They have lots of choices to pick from. I recently moved to jersey city and they delivered here but I haven't seen their menu in a while and I went all over Google looking for a menu lol and never found it. So for my fellow YELPers I've taken pictures of their menu and I'm gonna post them here for you .   please order from here give them a chance. You won't regret it. PS They only take cash.,Po Wong Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

9,YTxE3krGPrMoakvJuvkxyQ,Juju J.,2.0 star rating,"This is the first time I ordered from them and food are bland. My order was beef w/broccoli, fried chicken wings, chicken lo mein and hot and sour soup. All of it was bland. The reason for the 2 stars are the yummy unbreaded chicken wings, well cooked lo mein and food was still hot after waiting an hour for the delivery. The Cons: Beside lack of flavors...-Broccoli was way over cook to point of mush. I didn't even need to chew. Beef was ok. 1/4 of the container was filled w/sauce. Too much sauce compared to food.-Hot and sour was neither spicy[hot] or sour. It was extremely runny. Almost like someone just pour water into the container with some soy sauce.-Chicken Lo mein was flavorlessThe Pro:-Food still hot after waiting an hour for the delivery-Lo mein was el dente-flavorful umbreaded fried chicken wingsLast, the deliver guy couldn't figure out how to use the intercom. Our intercom is search by name and not by #. He claimed he couldn't figured out how to use it even thought the instruction was right next to intercom. And i was giving him instructing over the phone. I gave up and my husband went downstairs from our 3rd floor apt to fetch our dinner. Without saying this is our first and only time that we will be ordering from them. Time to search for another Chinese restaurant.",Po Wong Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

13,NPFn3HB6vQVLwoW4LNcwXw,Ipsita D.,2.0 star rating,"I usually don't order food in my neighborhood, especially Chinese food, since it is almost always terrible here. I thought maybe this place would be different based on the reviews. Nope--at least not what I tried. Got the roast pork egg foo young (never had that before so can't really compare) as a combo so it came with pork fried rice & egg roll. It was drowned in gravy (leaked through to the bag) & the pork in the fried rice was just chewy bits of nothing. The usual bad greasy Chinese fare with little taste. Threw a third of it away. At least it was cheap--less than $7. They only take cash though. Maybe their other stuff is better but don't know if I'd bother to try the place again. Should stick to dining in NYC!",Po Wong Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

16,QMI6nScsKlQit0HxH3TgHQ,Giuseppe A.,5.0 star rating,"I have to agree with first post, the spare ribs(boneless) are awesome, also order fried dumplings which are also amazing. They actually have booths in the resturant which i like!  I order here 3-4 times a month and the food is always perfectly cooked and the service is excellent. You can also ask for special requests like teriyaki(cut up and not on the stick) with white rice which is not on the menu is also one other faviorite. I would recommend this resturant to everyone!",Po Wong Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese
