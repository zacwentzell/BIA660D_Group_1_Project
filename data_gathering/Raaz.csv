0,9OsWIEDz9oPKimxfL8H2-w,Max F.,5.0 star rating,"Those of you whose best friend lives in another city know the struggle of missing them and not really being able to actually see them for a while. That's my current relationship with Raaz.When I lived in Jersey City, I could--and often did--walk to Raaz in 25 minutes tops. I was living with my dad, who could only infrequently walk more than 10 minutes without encountering severe joint pain, and we would do this walk together, maybe on the PATH one way to spare him, but certainly walking the other way. It is so, so worth it, although I say this as someone who never footed the bill. Life before getting a job was weird.You come in and you're seated by a very kind host, who quickly gets you a couple of glasses of water and asks what drinks you might want. You order an Indian beer and browse the menu's expansive list of meal options, including many vegetarian ones (I believe there are vegan options too, but I'm not sure), while eating the complimentary bread-like appetizer (not a naan, you've forgotten the proper term). Assuming you're not a vegetarian like myself, you struggle with which option to order. Assuming you're like me in every other way, you eventually order something with paneer. You make sure to get the garlic naan, very specifically the garlic naan; your meal comes with rice and is going to be bigger than you anticipate, even if you've been here before. After short enough of a time that you're not yet impatient but long enough that you know you're not eating at a fast food restaurant, your meal comes, and you're exactly the right amount of famished to dive right in. That beer didn't fill you up? Here's exactly the right amount of food, spice, sweetness, nutrition (okay, maybe too many carbs), and just general amazingness to, uh, fuck you the fuck up.It doesn't end, though. You thought you were getting away with dessert? Not always. Sometimes, the kind and wonderful owners and their waiters will bring you dessert on the house. It's those really sweet and sticky dough balls that are sitting in like a little super low puddle of utter sweetness, and it's going to complete you. Raaz has completed you. You leave and walk home for 25 minutes to burn off some of the excess carbs. You plop down on the couch and wake up 10 hours later wondering where you were last night. You taste a bit of the little sweet dough balls still on your breath and you're transported right back. This is paradise.",Raaz,3.5 star rating,$$,Indian
1,DJLtG3oRWGHVGTu5O39vqg,Neil R.,2.0 star rating,"This review is for the Buffet specifically.  Long story short, not good.  Poor quality food but also many of the dishes were not hot or even warm. Sadly, the best part was the gulab jamun and ice cream. It is surprising to me when buffets are not at least average as it's the best advertising for having a full meal at another time, which should be worth more to the restaurant.  The saag didn't have much flavor, chennas were not warm, and aloo gobi was average.Anyways, was hoping for better experience.",Raaz,3.5 star rating,$$,Indian
2,ttve4vHPDtrnlaYRfMXhSQ,Shelley X.,3.0 star rating,"If you're looking for the best Indian food, this isn't your place. However, if you are looking for a quick and decent place to grab dinner or lunch, I would recommend you give this place a try. I have been here for dinner or for weekend lunch buffet before, and every time it has been a great experience. My favorite has been its buffet...Great selections and great price.FOOD: While the presentation of the dishes here aren't great, the foods here have been flavorful and tasty. For dinner, you can order whatever you want. My favorites are Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala. They served in small bowls. If you like nans, you have to order them separately, but you can do assorted to try various types. For buffet, it's a large selection of soup, chicken, veggies and beans dishes, but only two dessert selections. ENVIRONMENT: It's for sure a small place. The lighting here isn't good; I feel like everyone is eating in the dark... it also has a strange monitor near the bar that plays random music videos...SERVICE: The waiters here were great, but the front desk host needed some serious professional trainings. She basically pointed the direction of our table, and we have to walk ourselves over to the table and hope that it was the right one.... At least help walk the guests to the table!DINNING RECOMMENDATION: If you are not picky on getting the specific food, I would recommend you go during its weekend lunch buffet (12:30 - 3:30pm). Very decently priced, a good spot for a lazy morning.",Raaz,3.5 star rating,$$,Indian

Not amazing but a good fix to restaurant indian food if you know what i mean.The gravy is heavy - paneer makhni or paneer kali mirch - but not as heavy as  most restaurants.The bhindi was very oily...like soaked in oil - so would not recommend that.Naan gets to chewy - when ordered home - but it wasn't as bad as normal restaurants.So in all - i would order from here if i wasn't interested in trying a new place - which is rarely the case.,Raaz,3.5 star rating,$$,Indian
9,G5aeHmHjGw4_1a9YV2D97g,Tony J.,3.0 star rating,"Came here a few times. Most recently I came here with a friend and we started off with vegetarian samosas. They were crispy and flavorful, and came with the standard mint and tamarind chutneys.We then shared the dhaba murgh and baingan patiala, with naan on the side. The dhaba murgh curry went very well with the naan, and the chicken was tender and moist. For something advertised as spicy, it could probably be a bit spicier. The baingan patiala was very fragrant, a perfect vegetarian dish.The food is 4 stars but taking off half a star for speed of service. The place was pretty empty when we went but it still took a long time for food to come out of the kitchen.

We entered and were rudely welcomed by the person informing us the kitchen closes in 10 mins. I mean we understand we were late but you can be a bit polite in communicating. As for the food we had Mushroom mutter and some Chicken dish i do not remember and    nothing met my satisfaction. The gravy was tangy and i felt as if it was made in tomato sauce. Just as were hungry and late we literally gulped our food. I am neither a chef nor a big foodie to judge the food but I do need a decent meal.Well the decor was nice but does that really matter ? I would not visit this place again and if in future am late again i would settle for some pizza.,Raaz,3.5 star rating,$$,Indian
17,uu7u1Y46iN-HmakQyXJ-dw,Vikram R.,2.0 star rating,Raaz is located just opposite to Newport path train station. We went there for the lunch buffet on a working day.

Allow me to highlight a couple of my faves (while trying not to copy and paste the entire menu)Gulab jamun -- Very light dough balls with a pancake flavor bathed in a light syrupy rose sauce. These are the best I've ever had.Butter Chicken -- Tender and delicious. I loved the soft texture of the meat and how fresh it was.

I went there for dinner last night. The server was a child who was nice but confused. There was a lady server too and was super distracted with one table. Both servers did not attend to us for a long time - say over half hour. We were seated with the menus and no one came to get our order. We made hand gestures to the lady server indicating we were ready to order. She noticed us and approached our table 5 times but got distracted with her favourite table. So we just sat there drinking water. Of course we don't have all evening to devote to Raaz so we left after sitting there for over 30 min without being served. We ate nothing. When we walked out and the owner said bye and thanked us lol. He was busy talking to another man the entire time and didn't notice that we ate nothing and that our order was not even placed. I'm not Indian and I wanted to try Indian food. I was not impressed at all. I think the owner and severs are new. They were very confused, disorganized, and unprofessional. I would recommend the owner and his staff to be trained on how to run a business and properly treat clients. There's an awesome Indian restaurant in Manhattan called Tamarind.

They delivered within time and the food is still hot.  I think the price is okay for dinner. But if I pay this price for lunch, I would definitely not coming because there is an Indian lunch buffet does charge less than what I paid for dinner and more variety choice in which I can try.   They do not have a deliver fee which is good.  So Saag Chicken comes with rice.  The only complaint is the dish is too salty.  It would be great if they could add less salt even other dishes.  Other than that, I like the favor and very filling.  Gulab Jamun desert is great same taste as other Indian restaurant.",Raaz,3.5 star rating,$$,Indian

The restaurant is relatively small but pretty nicely decorated, I think if we gotten the booth table around the corners the experience would have been even better. I thought the tables were little too closely placed but doesn't really hurt the experience.The food were mostly pretty good in my experience, the naan was freshly made and very popular that might have to end up waiting for fresh batch to come out. They have a clear window to see into the kitchen and you can see they make the naan fresh. I thought their chicken dishes were pretty decent and the chili fish was only average.The desserts were another highlight of the meal though, the milk/cheese ball were really good although a bit too sweet for my taste but with side of water or milk it works out perfect. The rice pudding was really good as well.I personally would definitely recommend this place if you like to give Indian food a try.

I would say that was a very good value.We ordered the Crispy Cauliflower, as that seems to be recommended by a lot of people.  This could have been a really good dish, but the battered, fried cauliflower became soggy and doughy when drenched in the sauce.  I thought they should have served the sauce on the side to keep the cauliflower crispy.We also ordered the lamb Roganjosh and Saag Chicken.  We really enjoyed both of these dishes, although there was nothing terribly special about them.All-in-all, I would say Raaz was 3 & 1/2 stars, and I struggled whether to give it 3 or 4.  I went with 4 because the service was outstanding.  I will definitely give it another try.",Raaz,3.5 star rating,$$,Indian

BIG BIG NO ....  Reviewed on 06/14/2015----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It's sunny sunday afternoon & being starved after long shopping session, i decided to eat at Indian cuisine as my tongue was craving too - for Punjabi food ;)  Unfortunately i landed at Raaz, i was by surprised to being forced routed to Buffet by default. After long plea with rude manager (he was acting as the restro was his ancestral inheritance), i was permitted for ALA CARTE, but warned to get the food after 20min which we (me & wife) agreed upon.Being veg we ordered Paneer Kali Mirch and tandoori Naan at start to taste the food and waited for 35min to recieve the order (it was intentionally delayed to 35min as we rejected the money minting buffet proposal).Next surprise - Paneer Kali Mirchi was green curry (imagine green curry Punjabi cuisine) thinner then gujrati dal with bits & pieces of paneer with tasteless masala's (I can say if you guys have roamed in Indian Railways, you might have tasted better taste food).We complained to manager (he could not speak English so debated by ) but after 10min of Hindi debate, he finally surrendered and asked me to choose a replacement.To win the insane war, he got me paneer kadhai which was next surprise - a half cooked vegetable bowl rinsed in tomato ketchup - termed as gravy saag.Again a long debate with foolish manager, & finally my wife lost her patience & we impulsively left the food as-is, donated 32$ to their charity (sorry but didn't pay any TIP as the rude manager was my waiter).My review might seem harsh but considering the quality & taste of food to amount i paid was insanely nightmare & i can say i have never been cheated in US on food quality /taste like this ever.Drove to nearest Indian street to R***i & had satisfactory food.My rating for quality + taste of food is rating is -10 & rude manager is -100Next time if i am starving in Newport mall, i would be more happy to feast even on subway.Or rather drive to Indian street and eat a DOSA or just have tea in worst case.This place is still making bread because of  - 1) Indian community in newport who are not aware of Indian street and lazy to drive or harsh winter climate 2) Indian people starving to death during lunch in nearby banks (JP etc)3) People who haven't tasted actual Indian food in India!!!

He gave me a funny eye when I ordered the lassi martini and didn't say anything when I said I wanted to try it. Of course I didn't like it too much. He was so generous as to offer me several other replacement options. I opted for a mango mojito instead and it was good. I didn't like how the mint was way too muddled and I had to spit it out every sip. Overall: Service was really good. Very polite and attentive. Inside and outside seating was a plus. Food was tasty.

When it comes to Indian food there are not many options in this area.We went during the lunch time and tried the lunch buffet. This place was a complete disappointment when it came to food. They did had the usual buffet fair on display, but food lacked flavour. I tried the Pakoras(deep fried veggies), Dal makhani(Lentils), Bhindi masala(Indian style okra), Aloo Mutter(Peas and potatoes) with rice and naan.To start with the Pakoras were way too salty, dal makhani had no flavour- it didn't even taste like the usual dal makhani. Bhindi masala just had way too much oil and no spices(way too bland) and the aloo mutter were sweet. So bascially all the veggie enterees sucked. Also noticed that they make thier naan and kept on the buffet table instead of making fresh when one sits down which resulted in naan being cold. The only thing i liked was the dessert(Kheer), apart from that this place was a complete let down. With tip I wasted my $16 bucks on this crappy food.Take my advice if craving Indian, go to the food court in the Newport mall.

85,8UwZi3BwC74MJrUS24iP0w,Adam D.,4.0 star rating,"I really, really like this place.  Went here around 6:30 on a Saturday night and we were only the second table there, however the crowd picked up by the time we left around 8:00.Overall, a great experience.  As for the food, we started off with the crispy lasooni gobi (fried cauliflower), which had awesome flavor and spice.  Highly recommended. For dinner, we ordered the kadai chicken and the dal gosht (lamb served with lentils).  Both dishes were excellent, but they were served in a bowl and the chunks of chicken and lamb were not exactly bite size.  I suppose this was okay since the entree was served with a side of basmati rice, which came to the rescue in toning down the level of spice in the entrees.  That said, our waiter asked us while taking our order whether we wanted our entrees mild, medium, medium-spicy or spicy.  I went with medium spicy on the kadai chicken, which should be sufficient for the average pallet.  They also run a long happy hour special every day so it was nice to get a $2 discount on the $10, 22 oz bottle of Taj Mahal.As for service, our waiter was very friendly, patient and knowledgeable of the menu.  He recommended the cauliflower appetizer as well as the dal gosht.  At the end of the service, he brought us over comment cards with the bill.  At first, I wasn't sure what to think of this since one of the questions asked us to rate the service (obviously the waiter would be able to see the rating if he/she wanted to and discard the comment cards that rated the service poorly).  On the other hand, the comment card asked for the customer's feedback on what the restaurant does well and what it could do better.  Once I saw those questions, I thought the comment card was a good idea from a management/ownership standpoint because to me, the card demonstrates a willingness to accept criticism, learn from the customers and adapt accordingly.So, what did I not like about the place? The menu is huge, so much that I would say it's overwhelming.  They're trying to do too much, which made me question the freshness of ingredients, especially when I walked in at 6:30 on a Saturday night and there was only one other table in the restaurant.  I'm also skeptical of restaurants who put pictures of their food in the menu, but this place was able to get away with it.  Lastly (and this is a very minor point), I wish there were more art work.  The ambience is really nice and I like the way their booths are set up, but once you get in the booth you're sitting next to a plain brown wall.Overall, I really want to give this place five stars, but I think it needs to do a couple of things before I can make that leap.  If Raaz sized down the chunks of meat in its entrees, improved the ambience and downsized its menu, I would say this place is 'as good as it gets.'",Raaz,3.5 star rating,$$,Indian

I went with the lamb rogan josh. It arrived on a huge plate with individual bowls of lamb, rice, chutney and saag. I made a uge mess of it and it was excellent. It's always difficult to get the spice level right. I want some flavor and heat, but not enough that mylips burn for a week. I said ""medium"" and this was probably closer to ""mild"" but I'm always worried that if I say ""hot"" then I might end up with something inedible that melts my face off. Oh well.While I ate, I enjoyed watching the TV that was tuned to a Bollywood music video channel. Man, those guys can dance!I skipped dessert but I did have an Indian beer with my meal. They had Kingfisher, which I've had before. This time, I chose Taj Mahal and it was very similar.I'll be back.",Raaz,3.5 star rating,$$,Indian

104,nWrFsTtVM5TYnG1icTgN3w,York M.,4.0 star rating,"I rated this 4 stars based on the Lamb Vindaloo alone. The great thing is that this place has a Buffet at lunch time which allows everyone to try a lot of their dishes. This also great for newbies not familiar with Indian food a try.  The dishes are not as spice filled as real deal places like those in Edison but are serviceable. They are definitely better than bland Indian stands in the Newport Mall and the cafeteria in the tower next door. Bad thing about the buffet is that chicken dishes they use white meat and over time it gets really dry.  I understand white meat is maybe more authentic and higher quality, but it is terrible in buffets.  Well, let me the get to the Lamb Vindaloo. Oh my Roshan Gosht (sp?)!! I am Spicy Food Lover and I always order the Lamb Vindaloo.  I don't bother ordering anything else because nothing on the menu compares to it.  I have tried Lamb Vindaloo at every Indian Restaurant but nothing compares.  The sauce is flavorful and not just overpowering heat.  It is not too rich or greasy, just a perfect balance of spice and heat.  The amount of lamb is also perfect.  Oh the joy! It helped me many a day forget my crappy job next door. I would give it 5 stars if Lamb Vindaloo was the only dish. I was in VindaLove!",Raaz,3.5 star rating,$$,Indian

We returned the next night for dinner, however, and I was blown away.I've been an off-and-on vegetarian the last few months, and so i ordered a veggie dish, and it was absolutely amazing. Flavorful, well prepared, and cooked 'medium' spicy like i ordered. I tasted everyone else's at my table, and theres was just as good.

114,spwMPtqs8nzw7mzOPdEt9Q,Tania R.,3.0 star rating,"We drove to this restaurant from NYC on a whim upon hearing about its' large portions and delectable food. Upon arriving, we found that the restaurant was located in a clean and beautiful part of Jersey City, right across the street from the river. The interior of the restaurant is dimly lit and beautiful, with Bollywood music videos from 2001 playing on the flat screen TV that was perched on the wall. Being a person who can't help but sway to music that I am familiar with, I began dancing in my booth to the Indian music, much to my non-South Asian boyfriend's amusement.On the food itself: All I can say is, it's nothing special. In fact, at the prices that the entrees were labeled as, I'd say it was even mediocre at best. I've tried many types of Indian restaurants, and there have been plenty with much more delicious food at a more inexpensive price. I had the chicken vindaloo, which is always a favorite of mine, but it was just okay at Raaz. The mango lassi, on the other hand, is worth praising--it was thick and sweet and just the right taste. The garlic naan is also worth ordering.I wasn't feeling our waiter--he was nice enough, but seemed too eager to get us to order more menu items, and had an air of impatience towards the end of our dining, as if he wanted to rush us out. By the way, the portions are average and in no way oversized. I was mildly disappointed considering I had come bearing an empty stomach and a huge appetite.A helpful tip: if you park in the garage right by the restaurant, make sure you get a parking voucher from Raaz, otherwise you will have to pay.

The most irritating thing was the check. The Manager brought the check and he had himself manually added 20% tip on his own even when we had a bad service experience. It was a forced tip.

The first best place we have had delicious Indian food was at the restaurant called Rupali in Hiroshima, Japan (Happy went to that trip)! Raaz has really great chefs, the food taste proves it all.

Despite reducing sugars in general, I would eat jamun here for sure. :)Being a neatness freak, I check a lot of thing which makes it diffcult for me honestly like a place.

It's more modern and trendy. This is definitely a place where you can go for a special occasion, business lunch, or even a casual night out with friends and family. It's not uptight at all, nor by any means is it ghetto or lacking in the service and quality department.If anything, Raaz offers great Indian food, Indo-Chinese cuisine, and familial hospitality. When I dine at Raaz, I don't really feel like I'm eating out at a restaurant. I feel like I'm dining at home. The guy who owns Raaz is super nice and gracious. He welcomes all diners with a smile and will remember you each time you return.Whether I've had chicken or lamb kebabs, Bhindi Masala, or one of the chicken dishes, I've enjoyed it all. The platters come with rice and salad. It's a full meal and if you want, round it out with a side of roti.Raaz is kind of pricey. It could easily average out to $20 a head with drinks but it's worth it. Dining at Raaz is comfortable, clean, tasty, and filling.",Raaz,3.5 star rating,$$,Indian

I wish they would have just told me that they were closing shortly instead of getting the cold shoulder. Well thanks for serving me, I was pretty hungry at the moment. The owner or manager perhaps took up my check at the end of the meal. he was friendly my take on it is that he was happy to see some business come in, now he just needs to get that message down to his staff.Here's a hint, if you don't want people to come in, lock the door.",Raaz,3.5 star rating,$$,Indian

It's essentially Tikka Masala but with honey or some other secret amazing spice. The only reason I don't order it every time is that there's no way its healthy at all. My fiance always orders it though so I usually steal some of the sauce. Over the years I've tried many of the vegetarian dishes and most have been very good. I especially like the Palak Paneer. Though a word of warning- if you ask for it spicy they really deliver on that!

We were immediately seated in a window booth and cozied up next to each other on one side. Oh, love! Our waiter was very much in favor of us trying the buffet. ""Perhaps you would like the buffet! Are you sure you don't want the buffet? The buffet is full of splendor and goodness!""Nevertheless we resisted as neither of us wanted to go back to the conference with that much curry in our tummies. I ordered a ""moderately"" spicy lamb vindaloo dish instead - oh was it good! Big pieces of tender lamb swimming in hot red sauce. It made my head sweat but I couldn't stop eating it! Boux ordered an interesting dish - potatoes with cottage cheese in a creamy tomato based sauce. Double yum-tastic too.

As one of the only Indian restaurants in downtown Jersey City, I've been dragged here a few times,  and enjoyed many a mediocre dish, ranging from the vegetable biryani to paneer makhani to the spicy reshmi kebabs. The Reshmi Kebabs really turned my stomach, and I have a stomach of steel - felt lousy for a couple of days. Despite having no desire to go back, friends visiting insisted on going for chaat and chai. We sit down, wait a good 10-15 minutes for the surly waiters to show up and acknowledge we are there (It is VERY busy with two WHOLE customers sitting inside, so I can image the staff of 7-8 is on edge - I understand). I hate chaat with a passion so opt for the blandest thing I can find - a Tandoori chicken salad. Maybe about half an hour later, they manage to serve the complex meal of chaat and chai (definitely from some budget tea bag and tasteless). I sit there, waiting around, as my friends start eating. A good 15 minutes later, someone has the kindness to come outside and check on us. We ask about the Tandoori Chicken salad, to which he replies ""Oh, that item is not available, would you like to order something else?"" I've seen some bad service, but it takes special attitude to not even inform me that my order wasn't available for 45 minutes. That was the end of the exchange. No attempt to offer a free entree, comp us for something else, or anything. Manager standing right outside chilling, he cared about as little as the waiter.

On a recent evening i decided to go have an early dinner at this place. I placed an order for a samosa chaat and an assorted tandoor for the starters. When the samosa chaat came, it was missing yoghurt in it which was clearly mentioned in the description of the dish. I made the waiter come and check it herself and she got us some yogurt on the side. I was absolutely fine with that as it's not much of a problem to mix it yourself. It tasted as expected like most of the other Indian restaurants serving this dish. Following that the assorted tandoor dish arrived with barely any of the listed assorted items in it. In fact the item clearly mentioned potatoes in it and it was missing potatoes in it. I'm a big foodie and this was a big disappointment that even the second dish wasn't served as mentioned on the menu. I had the waiter call the manager and ask him to find me the items listed in the menu and even he was helpless. So please BEWARE and next time make sure you ask your server what all is included in your dish and ask if all items will be included like they say.
