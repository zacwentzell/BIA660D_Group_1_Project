1,tt1vLgAP5UpRXAKJLT2KWg,Alec K.,3.0 star rating,"Decent bubble tea chain and the oldest bubble tea location in Hoboken. The price, quality, and variety are basically average for bubble tea. Of their offered ""snacks"" I've had a few and they are much better then what you'd expect from a place that specializes in beverages. I still come back here from time to time and will continue to do so in the future. Their atmosphere is fine, and their business hours start quite late for a caffeinated beverage store. Sound decent? They are. But the reason they deserve three stars is that there is much lacking there that other bubble tea places offer. Prices could be improved, hours could be earlier, they could have a greater selection (there are some bubble tea staples that they are missing), service could be faster (takes ages if there is even a short line). Also their almond bubble tea is foul tasting. Anyhow I still go here from time to time for their bubble tea and for some snacks, if you must have bubble tea and can't be bothered to go far from the PATH, Vivis is a good option.",Vivi Bubble Tea,3.5 star rating,$,"Ramen,, Bubble, Tea,, Taiwanese"

Think of it as the milk after you're done eating a bowl of cereal (especially Trix). It's awesome.Don't forget to ask to add tapioca to your slush - (and note that these options are also available in non-slush, so you can choose the iced version, which I hate because after it waters down, it tastes mildly gross). I want to try their ramen, but that's a big gluten no-no. It certainly looks good!My only issue with Vivi is that they don't post their calorie count (it should be a range, to account for the different sugar levels). Every large chain restaurant is required to post calorie data, but I guess Vivi hasn't met that definition of a large frachise just yet. It does, however, sell food (popcorn chicken and ramen), so after they've met that minimum number to be considered a large frachise establishment, if they haven't already, I'll be expecting to know how much caloric waste I've consumed on a particular day.",Vivi Bubble Tea,3.5 star rating,$,"Ramen,, Bubble, Tea,, Taiwanese"

The edamame was fine (how do you mess this up though, really...) the takoyaki was OK, but the ramen just did not deliver. I asked for mine to be less salty but it was still WAY oversalted, and not nearly as good as the other ramen joints in NYC. Maybe I set myself up for failure getting ramen at a bubble tea place, but still. Very disappointed by the food here. The restaurant itself is very cute, and I was hoping it could become a regular lunch spot, but the food is not good enough to permit a repeat visit.

The ramen here tastes like someone soaked their socks in water and served it to us.  I was extremely embarrassed that the person with me also had to experience this nasty food.  It was almost insulting that someone can serve you food like that and expect to take your money.  I am not sure how this place is still in business. There are a 1000 ramen places better than this in New York and New Jersey, and anyone who has ever had ramen anywhere else will know that ramen here is of poor quality. Didn't even bother trying the bubble tea because the ramen was so disgusting. If your bubble tea is any good, stick to that and take the ramen off your menu, please.

The prices are a bit high (with tax etc a pork ramen bowl came to about $14) and with a $4 delivery fee it's not always ideal. However, I like this place so much that I ordered it for lunch and dinner yesterday (I was home sick and this was the best cure) and the second time I just took the bus downtown and back to avoid the delivery fee...with a cold.

This is the first time I've seen a Vivi with rice bowls and ramen so I decided to give it a try for lunch. Not many places offer ramen to go so I was interested to see how this was going to taste. There was a big lunch crowd around 12:30PM eating in and a bunch of people near the back waiting for their take-out. Drinks were made near the cashier and came out a lot quicker than the food. They do offer pre-orders so I'll do that next time. Luckily there was a couch in the back with cute macaron plushies so my co-workers and I waited there for our food! We were given a pint container of the soup and a bowl with our order. I got the Vivi Shoyu which included 3 thick slices of chicken char siu, julienned seaweed, wood ear mushrooms, half an egg, curly ramen noodles, roasted seaweed, and topped with a lot of scallions!

I had a strong feeling that my order will not be right since the cashier was the grumpy, snob and irritating cashier. Then I was right!!! All they want is money. They don't care if they give you your right order or not, all they care is money!!! So disappointed!!! They tried to argue at me because she said I ordered MILK TEA instead of MANGO TEA that I always get. I SAID MANGO TEA TWICE then she asked you want BLACK TEA? So I THOUGHT THEY CAN DO THAT SINCE I PREFER BLACK TEA MORE THAN GREEN. THEN THEY GAVE MILK TEA WHICK I REALLY WOULDNT DRINK BECAUSE I ALWAYS GET AN UPSET STOMACH AND A HEADACHE WITH THAT.

I have had the Vivi Shoyu and the Tonkatsu Miso (pictured).The ease of parking on Washington, ordering at the counter, and seating myself at any table makes for a quick, but fulfilling ramen meal. I am always served quickly; I've finished a whole bowl while only paying 30 minutes for street parking. The broth is full of flavor and the meat has always been tender, melt-in-your-mouth savory. The portions are great (and I eat a lot!) I did order extra noodles once and felt extremely full, so the bowl itself is just right. The price is good and definitely beats the $16 bowls for less portion in the city.-1 star for the decor. The place is bright, pink & white, and just gives off a cutesy/cheesy vibe. Not an ideal romantic date night. Seems to cater to a younger crowd, as I see school kids stopping by for bubble tea. Personally not my style, but it is definitely unique.

The pork chasiu rice bowl was good, but if you're looking for something authentic tasting, this isn't it. The pork is a lot more reminiscent of Americanized barbecue meat rather than real Chasiu. The taste went well with the dish though, which also had seaweed flakes, half an egg, corn, spinach, and mayo. The mayo was a nice touch - giving it a nice and creamy consistency - and the dish was quite tasty.The popcorn chicken was also really good - your typical Asian fried chicken. We got the salt and pepper seasoning, which was simple but delicious. I'm not a fan of Takoyaki in general, but my boyfriend enjoyed it. My bubble tea was good, although not as yogurt/Yakult-y as I had imagined it would be. The bubbles had a nice sweet honey like flavor, which was nice, but they were sticking together a lot, making it difficult to drink/eat.The service - oh my gosh, so mind-numbingly slow. We ordered our food and drink at the counter and found a seat to eat in. We waited an HOUR for our food. Even my drink took 20 minutes to be ready. It was ridiculous. They were busy and were very backed up, which was understandable, but even after we went up to ask about our order twice, they didn't really seem to be hustling. It appeared to me that they were understaffed in terms of the staff cooking and serving the food, and the people making the drinks just seemed slow (and probably understaffed too...although it doesn't look like there would be much more space behind the counter for more people back there...) Who knows. In general, we were not happy with the service. At all.As for the look and feel of the place, I'm not really a fan of the cutesy theme. It's pink, and I like pink, but it's too pink.I do like the wall of green though - one of their walls is covered in shelves of greenery. Fake plants, but still a nice and refreshing for the eyes.They have a small outdoor seating area up front, which is nice, but it doesn't seem like the wait staff comes around to pick up after the customers and clean up tables frequently, so the tables aren't always clean/cleared.The inside of Vivi is small and can get pretty cramped depending on how busy it is.

I've been several times and each time it's less fulfilling than the time before that.  For starters the bubbles are mushy, good bubbles are essential to the bubble tea experience. They need to have the right chewiness and the right sugar level. Ive ordered several drinks and have asked for a variety of sugar levels and still feel each drink is too sweet and not enough tea.  Its like drinking sugar water lightly flavored with tea.The decor could use some work, the bright florescent lights make you feel like you're walking into a dingy gas station. And where the food comes out is inconveniently placed far away from the drink counter. Where if you're standing when they blend your drink you can't hear anything being called out.The service is mediocre at best, I've gone when it's super busy and also when it's empty and no matter what, they can't seem to keep track of who ordered what.",Vivi Bubble Tea,3.5 star rating,$,"Ramen,, Bubble, Tea,, Taiwanese"

While there's a 20-dollar minimum, I didn't mind because I can order a tea for me, a tea for Le Man, some ramen and even a rice bowl if I felt really hungry.  All their products keep well in the refrigerator and I can enjoy Vivi's treats all day.  Plus, their delivery person (lady with medium length blonde locs) is super nice and professional.  I'm certainly addicted and will continue to enjoy my Vivi fix in Jersey!",Vivi Bubble Tea,3.5 star rating,$,"Ramen,, Bubble, Tea,, Taiwanese"

Since it is a chain, it would be expected to have some standard in drink production, but every milk tea based drink I've had here was still powdery and next to flavorless. I keep trying to see if it depends on who made the drinks but after trying a few times they all seemed to use too much non dairy creamer, and not mixing it well. They offer various foods too but if they can't even make a simple black milk tea taste good, I doubt the food will be executed as just. I'll give this place one thing though. And that would have to be their inviting interior and overall cleanliness. Great staff, and everyone is super friendly. In the end, having clean facilities and great staff can only take you so far. I look forward to when they can produce a better product. I really want to like the spot, but the milk tea based drinks are just disappointing.",Vivi Bubble Tea,3.5 star rating,$,"Ramen,, Bubble, Tea,, Taiwanese"

This Taiwan pearl milk tea has expanded itself onto 20 locations and mainly can be found in New York, so the fact that it's blessed itself onto Hoboken, it makes Jersey pretty lucky. Vivi has an extensive tea selection along with macaroons, slush, milk teas, Taiwan snacks and most of it's consumers are repetitive due to the fact that you can't really find that many almond milk tea with royal jelly and aloe. If you haven't been to this place then I heavily recommend it and keep trying out different teas/ toppings until you find the one that appeals to you the most. Recommended paid dues goes out to the orange kiss refreshing jelly drink, along with japanese matcha milk tea with boba, or taro with royal jelly. Honestly the recommendations are endless so I suggest sneak peaking their menu before a selection is chosen: vivibubbletea.com/produc…Boba tea rules and if you haven't tried it yet then what are you waiting for?

I would definitely go back for the bubble tea and treats. I also got the popcorn chicken and thought it would be delicious but it was not that tasteful and the chicken was very rubbery. I actually was not feeling well after eating it. I will let go and come to terms that maybe bubble tea places just make good bubble tea haha.,Vivi Bubble Tea,3.5 star rating,$,"Ramen,, Bubble, Tea,, Taiwanese"

I enjoy Babos in downtown jersey city much better. I had high hopes for this place because they offer pudding, something most places do not, but the drink was still horrible.

The broth didn't have the depth that I'm used to, the noodles were overcooked (I also wasn't offered a choice - thin or thick) and the pork was charred and tasted like it was cooked on a burnt flat grill (and had that kerosene taste). Not good. Didn't have the bubble tea so can't comment on that.

169,Zkz9Ee8Ex5tWHK5IiqkoLQ,Albert L.,5.0 star rating,Been here over 20 times (lost count really) for the ViVi Shoyu. Smooth broth (not as milky as tonkatsu with miso which I prefer). Ask for mild or regular spice for some real flare! The Shoyu here also comes with a lot more toppings than totto or ramen-ya's (famous ramen spots in the city). Bubble tea is good too but the real gem here is the Shoyu.Almost forgot to mention they actually offer ramen to go and separate the broth so it doesn't soak into the food. Worth noting since no other ramen store offers this and I prefer a quiet place to eat at times.The franchise ViVis is not related to the ramen. I don't recommend the ramen from ViVi chains in the city.,Vivi Bubble Tea,3.5 star rating,$,"Ramen,, Bubble, Tea,, Taiwanese"
