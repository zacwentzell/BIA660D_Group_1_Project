Since becoming vegan, I've discovered vegetable sushi and I knew I needed to come here. After seeing this place on BuzzFeed, I was so excited to come and see what all the hype was about.My Dad and I decided to order a few dishes and share everything. We ordered the Coconut Curry soup, The Badge Dumplings, La Fiesta Roll, Spicy Mang Roll and Sweet Tree Roll.Everything. Was. Incredible. The coconut curry soup was delicious and had succulent asparagus inside. The Badge dumplings were bursting with flavor and had an awesome Ponzu sauce. The La Fiesta Roll had great zesty flavor and was paired with tomato guajillo sauce. The Sweet Tree Roll was very light with the sweet potato inside.

The cashier had to keep stopping to pack/bag orders, which left people in line waiting to place an order. 2) I wish they had more protein options, especially for the sushi rolls. The veggies are great, but when you're vegan/veg you still need protein and often tofu just doesn't cut it.",Beyond Sushi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Sushi, Bars,, Vegan,, Kosher"

As many times as I've seen my favorite social media stars snap pics of this place and rave about how amazing it is, I was quite skeptical about vegan sushi. Most of the time I knew vegan sushi to only have avocado, carrot, sweet potato, or cucumber, but that was it!This small stop tucked away in one of the Chelsea Market hallways looked so hippie and green when you pop your head into the door. There's a shelf that sells the dry version of its classic rice and grain blend and on the other side is a fridge aisle with juices, sweet potato brownies (WHUT?!), raw desserts and more. In front is where you can actually watch the chefs in action rolling everything up so the orders are made freshly!Anyways, I get the cashier's recommendation--Sunny Side--and wait for my roll. The roll is made of black rice, braised fennel, avocado, sundried tomatoes and butternut squash = quite an unlikely combination in sushi, but I like all of these ingredients, so why not? It came with an almond pesto which would sub as the mayo served in most sushi bars. I take a photo because it's GORGEOUS and eat one whole with some pesto, letting the flavors just burst inside my mouth. The nuttiness of the black rice along with the juice from the tomatoes, softness from the avocado, creaminess pesto and sweetness from the squash, are a medley of health. I could DEFINITELY see why Beyond Sushi is raved about so much!Now this goes to say that you shouldn't take your typical sushi fanatic here in a heartbeat. If you have a tongue with a knack for more wholesome, cleaner, fresher foods, then this is much better for you. However, this is also a really fun way to incorporate more vegetables and plant-based foods into your diet while maintaining the flavors and colors that you seek in sushi, so definitely check it out sometime if you visit Chelsea Market (which is like Disneyland in itself!).",Beyond Sushi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Sushi, Bars,, Vegan,, Kosher"

90,qBwKQXa-CP2rBYwb652AOg,Amy B.,5.0 star rating,"If you would have told me earlier this week that I would be choosing vegan sushi over all the other delicious protein options in Chelsea Market, I would have taken a lobster claw from Lobster Place and pinched off your nose. In fact, when I first walked past Beyond Sushi on my first day here (here for a week on business), I laughed to myself, ""Vegan Sushi?! New York is so stupid"". Then, a couple days later as I was perusing through Yelp at reviews on Chelsea Market, I stumbled upon this page with the great ratings and decided to try it. I'm a self proclaimed sushi assassin, so why not try a different kind? Here's what I had during my two separate visits: Mighty Mushroom: great earthy flavors and tons of umami. I was apprehensive about the tofu, but it wasn't even noticable texture or flavor wise because the mushrooms were so meaty. the alfalfa sprouts gave a pleasurable texture contrast and brightness to the mushrooms. This was my favorite roll. The shitake teriyaki sauce that comes with this is SO good that I found myself sucking on the tube afterwards like it was a pacifier. Super professional, i know. Spicy Mango: This is owned by many favorite roll of Beyond Sushi- and it was good, but not my favorite. In case you are wondering-- the top part did not taste to be too mango-y... it's seems like a mix of finely minced carrot, mango, and cucumber. The middle are match sticks of cucumber and daikon that are a great companion for soft minced topping. Had a bit of chili flavor to it, but I wouldn't call it spicy by any means. Pickle Me: I'm a big fan of daikon, and crunchy textures are very important to me, so I really liked this roll. Â The thicker cut match sticks with the creamy avocado topping paired for a great bite. I didn't care for the carrot ginger sauce (it was a little too sweet for me), but that's fine-- it comes in a little tube that you can choose to squirt on or not! Spicy Shroom Wrap: This was my favorite thing I ate! The spicy cashew sauce had just enough heat and savoryness to bring life to the buckwheat noodles. The combination of the enoki and portabello mushroom provided a depth of flavor that was surprising! adding in the crunch and fire of the pickled ginger, this wrap was a flavor bomb. Enoki Individual piece: Simple, perfection. Just rice and enoki mushrooms. Seaweed Individual piece: I've always been a fan of seaweed salad, but pairing it with rice and thick strip of nori really brought it to a different level of flavor. I wish I would have came here earlier in the week Â - lunch specials are quite affordable (considering it's Chelsea Market) and the customer service and speed in which these little art exhibits are made to order is impeccable and makes it a all around pleasure to come here.

I first saw Beyond Sushi while walking through Chelsea Market a few weeks ago, and believe me, it didn't look appetizing at all. Purple/black rice? Alfalfa? Veggies? Ughhh, no thanks. But I was curious so I Yelp'd it, and there it was with 4.5 stars.... at apparently their first location in Union Square. I was admittedly astonished and knew I had to give it a try. For you people who are thinking ""what the eff, who would do such a thing to sushi?,"" Beyond Sushi is an establishment owned by a contestant from FOX's Hell's Kitchen, Chef Guy Vaknin.My guess is I'm not the only person who doesn't believe vegan sushi could taste good because when I went into the little area (located past the waterfall right in front of Lobster Place and is take out only, no sit down), they had a plate of a sample roll of the Spicy Mang. When I took a bite, my mind was blown. Seriously. It was a pleasant surprise. It made me question everything in life. Then I composed myself, took a look at the menu and ordered a combo 2, which consists of 2 rolls and 2 individual pieces (you can pick whatever you want, all for $13.50). I picked:Spicy Mang - really liked this roll. It's made with black rice, avocado, mango, cucumber, and spicy veggies on top and comes with a toasted cayenne sauce.Mighty Mushroom - very mushroom-y which my bf really liked, but I was iffy. It was good, but I guess I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms, though I would totally get it again if I had a craving for them. I did like the sauce it came with though. This roll is made with six grain rice, enoki, tofu, shiitake, and arugula and comes with a shiitake teriyaki sauce.June piece of the month - roasted eggplant seasoned with sumac and a roasted tomato sauce infused with garlic and thyme. The pieces were heaven and the sauce paired beautifully with the eggplant.I also bought the Nutty Buddy wrap ($5 for small, $8.50 for regular; note: get the regular, sooo worth it), which was an explosion of flavors. It's made with soba (buckwheat noodles), cashews, carrots, cilantro, jalapeno peanut butter, avocado, tofu, and romaine and comes with a sweet soy mirin sauce. It really tasted like a regular summer roll, but without the shrimp or beef. Dare I say, it might have even tasted better! And the cool part is with all of the rolls and wraps, you get to pour as little or as much of the sauces as you want - they come in these cute tiny squeeze tubes.Of course I couldn't finish a meal without dessert, so I also got a cookie. I don't remember what it's called or made out of, but it was super moist and yummy. It might have been black sesame coconut something cookie? I love black sesame but hate coconut flakes and yet, I can't find fault with this one.If this wasn't enough, they also gave me a rewards punch card to earn a free drink, wrap, roll, or combo. Great.

Along with One Lucky Duck, and a handful of other new additions it was GREAT to have access to them all in one place without having to run around the city. A One stop-Vegan Dream.

120,K_y180_Uie0SBDOQTMPCoQ,Wing L.,4.0 star rating,"Beyond Sushi was started by Guy Vaknin, a former contestant of the TV show, Hell's Kitchen. Â This place is a vegan interpretation of what sushi should be beyond boring cucumber rolls as done by someone with culinary training.I am not a vegan but I do like to experience food in all its spectrum. The beautiful photos of the sushi alone was enough to convince me to give this place a shot. There are currently two locations for Beyond Sushi, Union Square and the one in Chelsea Market. Â This small spot within Chelsea is their newer location.As with the better sushi restaurants out there, this vegan spot makes your sushi rolls of wraps when requested, instead of premade and sitting around getting cold and drying out like places that serves fast food sushi. Â Each one is hand rolled and takes a bit of waiting after ordering.With my inability to decide on what to get, I decided on getting their combo deals to try different things. Combo 2, which was what I selected, comes with 2 rolls and 2 individual pieces of your choosing. Â Since it's $6.65 per roll and $1.15 per piece, at $13.78, it's like getting the two single pieces for free.A lot of reviewers mentioned the Spicy Mang Roll so I had to try that, then I added Mighty Mushroom Roll, a Seaweed and a Roasted Eggplant Caviar as the individual pieces to complete the combo.The Spicy Mang was good, with a slight mango flavor and barely perceptible heat. But... I give the nod to the Mighty Mushroom as the superior piece which is infused with a strong mushroom flavor.I was told the seaweed piece was one of the favorites and as much as I liked it, I couldn't help but think this is the least exciting of the collection, easily made at home with rice, wrapped in nori, then topped with seaweed salad and marin sauce.The Roasted Eggplant Caviar is more playful. Rice, wrapped in nori, topped with fish roe looking roasted eggplants. It hints of a citrus note. This was a piece of the month and not found on the regular menu.Since I ordered to go, the box came with two plastic test tube looking items each filled with a creamy paste inside. One orange, one grey brown. Â I was very confused about what this was so I had to call up Beyond Sushi to find out. Â These are the sauces that they usually place on top of the sushi rolls if you are eating in. Â For take outs, they didn't want the sauce to make the sushi too mushy over time so they placed it in the tubes. Â What a great idea. More places should do this. The tube placed right in front of each roll corresponds to the sushi it pairs to.The price in my opinion is a bit high considering there are no seafood pieces in there, but that is the reality for a lot of vegan food. Â Although I love my raw fish and prefer to eat traditional sushi if I could choose, I would not hesitate to eat here again if I were asked to go.

Â Simple flavors but perfectly balanced.Individual Pieces--these are really really adorable:Mango -- The mango was pale and kind of firm. Â Juicy, fresh, ripe mango would have made a world of difference here, considering it's just mango, rice, and a dab of sauce.Snow Pea -- Â It did what it said it would! Â Snow pea, rice, tiny bit of sauce. Â The crunch/bitterness of the snow pea lends itself to simple fresh preparation like this. Â I'd get it again.Cucumber/Mint Lemonade and Watermelon Lemonade were okay but a little diluted because they keep their drinks in a fridge close to the seating area instead of pouring them fresh over ice.
