I hoped he would check with the manager to confirm this charge, but he did not. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger medium, but when I received the burger it was completely well done. I was starving by then so I ate it anyway. However, the burger did not have much flavor to it and it was falling apart in my hands as the bun was extremely soggy. The fries I could tell were frozen and were overcooked, I compared it to McDonald's fries. My fiancé ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with cheese fries and a tomato soup, but the fries did not have any cheese and they were cold.

My wife likes the meatloaf sandwich, which does not appeal to me as much but kudos for serving the drippings as gravy.Desserts include the aforementioned donuts and also some shakes. When I ordered the black and white shake, we split it amongst the two of us. Our waiter actually brought out two small cups to help us distribute the goods.

There's check in offer to try the chocolates. We got a few and none really stood out. My friends who got donuts for dessert gave those much higher reviews.This place isn't dirt cheap, but it's not pricy. The food is your typical range.

Immediately greeted with a smile and a seat. Every employee checks on you, not just your server! The pricing on point! By that I mean I had an entire breakfast for under $10! My food was served VERY quickly! Hot and delicious. I've never even experienced hashbrowns to this caliber. Like soft slices of chewy delicious potato hash. They offer hot sauce (every diner should ok). And Vegetarian options! I was able to sub the ham for tofu in my omelette. (seems simple but not so easy to come by). The decor is like stepping into a time machine into a classic era without smart phones or Pokemon go, an era when you at you enjoyed without interruption!. It isn't over cluttered like most classic diners. It utilizes simplicity in refurbished booths, chairs and bars with 50/60s accents. It's simply beautiful, down to the classic subway tile. Most importantly it feels clean.  If your looking for a classic experience, here is your Spot. If I lived here this would be my regular Sunday morning hang. OH!

Donuts are mostly cake donuts, and are generous and sweet without being overly so. Fish and Chips were surprisingly good.Lows included a waiter who came over every few seconds to ask if we were ready to eat and then disappeared. The Reuben sand which was a sad version of a NY staple. We ordered the Nutella coffee milkshake which had been lauded by many. It was full of chunks of ice and streaks of Nutela as if they had mixed it for five seconds or less.

The owners (who happen to be lovely people) must've made some adjustments based on client feedback and now this place is hitting it's stride. Breakfast menu has a lot of great, healthy options (the tofu veggie scramble is awesome) and the omelettes are a thing of beauty. How does the chef get the eggs so thin and crepe like... Without ever overcooking them? Magic, I tells ya. The corned beef hash is homemade AND you can get a side for 2 dollars! Call me Sally and slap me twice. The donuts. I can't speak. I would make a raft on the cinnamon sugar donut and float away in the Caribbean Sea and never look back upon when I didn't know the donuts at the Schack. (Yes it is even ripe for catchy nicknames - Schnack attack anyone?) The lunch options are also pretty snazzy. The Rueben and tomato soup are two standouts, but really I don't think you can go wrong.

It's not as cheesy as say, Johnny Rockets.  It's a diner, in a way and serves basically diner food but a lot fewer options.  I have only been for breakfast. The service can be pretty slow, the first time we went it took forever just to get greeted and get a cup of coffee, we actually almost left but the waitress came up at the moment we were about to go. The breakfast was ok, just breakfast. The corned beef hash i will say is excellent, everything else is standard. The donuts, they are pretty good. Nothing out of this world but they are definitely a step up from Dunkin or a chain donut. I will give them that, they are reasonably priced.This last time I went in to grab a couple breakfast sandwiches to go. There is where they lose some stars and why I teetered on a 2 star rating. I sat at the counter and ordered a pork roll egg and cheese and a bacon egg and cheese to go. The 2 sandwiches took about 25 minutes to come out...yeah. Not to mention these 2 sandwiches were $6.50 a piece, WAY over priced they are about $3 too much. I would never order this here again. My pork roll egg and cheese had the eggs done wrong (i asked for scrambled, got over medium (I HATE runny eggs), the rolls were really stale, obviously past their due date. The cheese on mine had piled off the sandwich and onto the paper. It was just all around awful.

We ordered a side of shredded cheese; when it didn't arrive and we asked about it, was when we were first asked what kind of cheese we'd like.

I was just there during weekend brunch, and there is not enough room for the staff to handle the volume. I checked to see how they could improve their system, but I realized they would either need a super professional waitstaff or more space in the back. Their entire operation gets spilled out into the restaurant area.That in and of itself isn't a problem However, I think it's the source of all the other problems. The  space issue makes the waitstaff overwhelmed and underattentive (at least behind the counter). The food is alright. Their prices? Not so much. I ordered a $7.50 breakfast item. I then added hash browns and an egg cream. The result was a $15 check -- after taxes.

We left with full stomachs and a renewed sense of happiness for this close breakfast spot.Decor & Staff: Both remained identical to our previous visit (which is a good thing!).Food: This time we were smart and we phoned ahead to make sure they had Eggzels (they did, finally!). We're glad we did because they are delicious and well worth a visit. They are not too expensive either. The only downside is that they ran out of the ones with bacon (bummer!). We also each had a donut we was a very enjoyable experience as well. Also I stuck w/ water only this time as it appears that their drink prices per volume remain unchanged.I feel like I am beating a dead horse here but, really, the Eggzel single-handedly turned this into a positive rating.

I had walked by a few times and never noticed it until a friend suggested it for breakfast. Growing up in Jersey, I'm a huge fan of diners so I was eager to test out their food.The menu is quite smaller than a regular diner menu, but has all the staples: omelets, tuna melt, burgers, and desserts. I ordered a western omelette, which came with toast, fries, and a coffee. My friend ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup (which of course when our meals arrived, I got food envy over). I was impressed with the size of my order and very happy that it wasn't an enormous entree that took 3/4 of the plate, unlike most brunch spots in town.Service was perfect. Everyone we came across was friendly, helpful, refilled drinks without being asked, and completely relaxed (""I'll leave your bill here but please feel free to hang out as long as you'd like!"").Ambience was adorable, including the uniforms. I love the 50's diner look, it's so different from the rest of Hoboken brunch places.I was completely blown away when I had to pay. $6 for coffee, omelet, and fries?! Unheard of!

It took almost 10 minutes to take our order even though the place was not busy.  We were about to leave when the server finally came over. The food was just average. We both got the burgers. The burger itself looked and tasted like it was pre-made with zero seasoning. The best part about it was the bun. The fries did not seem like they were fresh cut and appeared to be pre-made as well.  There is a chance there to make really good, freshly made burger and fries. This missed the mark completely.

He always looked preoccupied making drinks.Although the owner/ manager and even the hostess seem attentive and know what they're doing, I found the servers to be inexperienced and just lame.And although the idea of passing out donut samples is great, the actual donuts weren't in my opinion- they were super dry and I couldn't even finish my bite-sized sample.  Milkshakes weren't good either.",Schnackenberg’s Luncheonette,3.5 star rating,$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Donuts,, Diners"

I wish I had taken a picture.  I was also still hungry when I left - I had to go home and make myself a second lunch.My husband ordered the burger.  It was also not good.  First, it didn't come with fries. Second, it was completely unappetizing  as well - a fast food type patty, it also tasted frozen and was cooked all the way through to eliminate any trace of pink.  Why would I go out  for that?  I could get better and cheaper at 5Guys.  Or way better and restaurant quality at any other restaurant in Hoboken.Sadly, I cannot see how this restaurant can hope to survive unless they fix their food quality issues.  It was crowded now, but I can't see people going back.",Schnackenberg’s Luncheonette,3.5 star rating,$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Donuts,, Diners"

Done excellently and cleanly, the third I had a delicious Breakfast burrito (although they gave me some else's order that had avocado which was fantastic).The weaknesses lie in the service and I'm not really sure what's going on there. Are they hiring too many inexperience servers, are they not training them correctly or do they not just have enough people working (on bustling Sunday brunch time, I didn't see any bus boys/girls). The third time is when they service was incredibly slow and half-minded and un engaged. While I appreciate the free donut holes they hostesses pass out, I rather your servers clear the tables promptly, provide ample table settings. I really hope this downslide doesn't continue because I do think they make delicious luncheonette food.

Ordered milkshakes, cakes, ice cream, coffee. 5 desserts. Fine. Then we waited. And waited. There was no one else in the place. Maybe a party of two outside. 2 young servers plus someone else behind the counter. Translation: plenty of staff, almost zero customers.One person's dessert came. We waited. Then several minutes later two more desserts came. Several minutes after that, the last 2 desserts finally arrived.At least ten minutes elapsed from the first dessert served to the last, which might not sound like much but when the first person is trying to decide whether to go ahead and eat his melting ice cream while everyone else sits there awkwardly, all while the whole group is looking at the employees and wondering what on earth they're doing, it's an eternity. It was uncomfortably awkward and frankly bizarre that they couldn't serve 5 desserts at one time.  Shrugged it off. Maybe it's part of the fake-1950s charm.  The desserts were fine. Cheesecake good, coconut cake dry, ice cream good. Eventually we left. 1.5 blocks away we realize my niece left her dinner leftovers there. We went back and found the first server outside casually wiping off one of the many open tables (there was only one table occupied).  We asked whether they found our doggie bag.  He told us to go inside and ask someone else (um, really? Shouldn't you hop to it and go inside and find out?).  We went inside and walked to our table to find the other server fully sitting down at our table engrossed in reading the map that we had inadvertently left behind.The table was partway cleared.  We asked him about our doggie bag.  He looked at us like we were speaking another language and mumbled something about the table being cleared.  Oddly vague reply, since he served us and was now sitting at our table, so we asked if he was the one who'd done the table-clearing.  He said yes.  We said again, ""Did you find our doggie bag?"".  He looked at us blankly and said maybe it was cleared.  I asked him to look in the bus bucket to grab it out, as we could only assume he'd placed it into that.  He stood up and looked toward the kitchen but didn't take a step toward it, and said he couldn't.  Evidently, that meant the case was closed.That was it.  No apology.  No nothing.  I couldn't believe it.  I spent years working in restaurants and if someone left a doggie bag that you discover while clearing the table, you run after them to give it to them, and if for some reason they have vanished from the street (which we definitely did not do), you set it aside in case they come back.  Ironically, the leftovers were from a not-inexpensive dinner at one of the owners' other restaurants, where we'd dined just prior to going to Schnackenberg's for dessert.  The moral of this story isn't about us not getting our leftovers.  It's that there are too many good restaurants with decent service to waste our time and money on a place that is being run like Romper Room.  Way too many strikes to count on this one--I will never set foot in this place again.",Schnackenberg’s Luncheonette,3.5 star rating,$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Donuts,, Diners"

I was looking for a reasonably priced burger, and this exceeded my expectations. Service was friendly and fast. This is a great place to go for breakfast or lunch with a friend --cannot really accommodate large groups due to size but it is very cute inside.

The waiter never put our order in , & he was clueless.  Fast forward to the beginning of December.  After a 4 month hiatus, my children asked me to go & I reluctantly said yes.  I am glad that I did.  The service staff was quick, efficient, & attentive.  The food was good, the service was good, & my children & I were happy. It is January 2nd, and I am here again.  Amazingly, the service is even better.  The food came out quickly, and the service staff made sure we were good repeatedly.  It turns out that a new manager (Crystal) was hired several months ago ( I believe sometime in October or November), and she has been working hard with the staff.  I am glad things have improved and my family and I will keep going back.",Schnackenberg’s Luncheonette,3.5 star rating,$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Donuts,, Diners"
179,TGDdZE73fRAWsMhWoGrgjQ,c j.,3.0 star rating,"I'd give two and a half stars, but the extra half star is for potential! Just a few tweaks and this place could be so good. Service was sparse and slow but friendly and I could tell they were trying, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on that. Substitutions were made without asking us--that's a decision that should be left up to the patron. At least give us the option to change our meal if you've run out of something. Portions are small and presentation a bit sloppy. And please do something better with the spuds--hand cut  fries, crispy hash browns or even tater tots would be far superior to soggy food service fries. All that said...our meal was decent, and I will return and try some other dishes. I'm a fan of their other restaurants and I'm hoping they'll step it up just a bit so I'll want to go back again and again.",Schnackenberg’s Luncheonette,3.5 star rating,$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Donuts,, Diners"

The only positive thing I can say is it's cheap. I had the chicken salad sandwich. Chicken salad was God only knows how old and put on bad white bread with slices of plastic wrapped American cheese. Also ordered a egg cream which was the worst I've ever had. Girlfriend ordered french toast of which she only took a few bites before tapping out. Not very fulfilling meal, went out for lunch again after leaving. We paid, left and will never return.The place would have great potential is only someone cared.

Holy shit - this place is so bad. As much as I wanted to like it for its wanna-be charm and old school roots, it was absolutely terrible. It smelled funny, crap was all over the counter and seats - looked like a messy, dirty house. Got a milkshake which was alright. Also ordered a hot dog which was mushy and on stale bread. Ugh.

186,h5s6PQk_L1VT77zgfzwUJg,Alex Y.,4.0 star rating,"Let's be real: This place is effin' adorable, and for where it's located (Uptown Hoboken) and what it's really selling (charm + chic/updated diner food), prices should not be the reason anyone gives this place a seriously negative review. Period. I didn't find the menu limited, though I understand that if you're expecting the 5-page menu you get at most diners, you'd be shocked that -gasp- there's a single page menu. Onion rings and fries were tasty and the milk shakes were AMAZING (and no one should be scared by the price because it's practically two shakes for the price with the added cup.) Mac and cheese was delicious to me and unappetizing to my friend. To each their own. It's super melted, and I'm pretty sure they use white cheddar (there are crunchy breadcrumbs on top, too.) If you like mom's cinderblock american cheese mac&cheese, you probably won't like it. Overall, no major problems with Schnack, and what I had was delicious. Service was great, and our server was very attentive. Schnack is totally my kinda joint, and though it's a bit of a trek from my house, I will be coming back for their burgers and breakfast items!",Schnackenberg’s Luncheonette,3.5 star rating,$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Donuts,, Diners"

I don't typically eat potato chips but since they were made in house I gave them a shot. They were real good.I think the magic here though is the sweets. Milkshakes, egg creams, doughnuts & pastries, chocolates all made in house. I went with a classic glazed cake doughnut and it was heavenly. Not overly sweet like most doughnuts. The look and vibe of the place is old school soda shop. Very cool.I will stop here again when I'm in town.",Schnackenberg’s Luncheonette,3.5 star rating,$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Donuts,, Diners"
191,euqWEzrQSfJOvZpcX_ByDw,Marla M.,1.0 star rating,Fourth try at Schnackenberg's and disappointed every time.  Had the cheeseburger and omelet today for lunch.  The burger seemed steamed-no crunch on the exterior from hitting the grates on a grill.  The burger was commercially formed and one inch smaller that the well toasted bun.  The extra $1.50 charge for a slice of cheddar cheese for the cheeseburger is EXCESSIVE.  The homemade kettle chips mentioned in NJ Magazine review (August 2014) were no where in sight.  The ham and cheese omelet was in a pool of unidentifiable liquid (oil?) and was ordinary.  The fries were good. We didn't expect great service in a luncheonette but a slight interest in our satisfaction might be a nice touch!,Schnackenberg’s Luncheonette,3.5 star rating,$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Donuts,, Diners"

My husband ordered a burger medium rare, and I ordered a spinach and goat cheese omelette. After waiting a ridiculous amount of time for food that should take probably 10-15 minutes at best (and the table of 4 that arrived more than 10 minutes after us received their food sooner) our food finally arrives and...both orders are wrong. My omelette had tomatoes instead of spinach and my husband's burger came out completely well done. These are two big mistakes and we believe the food would have probably been tasty had they got the orders right although the fries your typical McDonalds fare of which I ate only a handful. I would have expected at least one meal removed from the bill as a courtesy following an extremely long wait and two wrong orders, but instead we were given two donuts and told the 'kitchen must have been backed up and made mistakes'...There are at least 40 surrounding restaurants on Washington St that don't make mistakes during a brunch time that wasn't overly busy, so needless to say we won't be back.",Schnackenberg’s Luncheonette,3.5 star rating,$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Donuts,, Diners"
194,BQHmbrU049-lfBywi53_0w,Cristin C.,5.0 star rating,"Good grief, some of these reviews are hilarious.  I think that the people who are posting negative reviews are missing the point.  Schnackie's is an institution in Hoboken, the type of place that doesn't exist anymore because of franchises and high rents.  The same family has owned and run it since 1931.  This is a true Mom and Pop joint, and the food is true Mom and Pop joint food.  Consider it like eating at your grandmother's house.  Would you get sniffy about your grandmother using ""plastic-wrapped American cheese"" or Wonder bread?  No, you wouldn't, because that would make you a big jerk.  Schnackie's doesn't serve up artisanal New York cheddar on sfilatino bread.  That's why it's awesome.  Come in, take a seat, order a chocolate malt (best I've ever had) and talk to your neighbors.  THAT'S what makes Schnackenberg's great.  That and the Easter candy, which has been an institution in my family since my dad was a kid.  Haters can eat at Johnny Rockets, the sanitized franchise version of the Schnackie's style soda fountains that used to grace every town in the US.",Schnackenberg’s Luncheonette,3.5 star rating,$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Donuts,, Diners"

I consider myself a great cook and I am part of a group of friends that include chef's, sommeliers and professionals in the food industry. So when it comes to judging good food I believe I have earn some of the authority to do so. I have been in Hoboken for a long time and I regreat not taking the time before to go to this place, two weeks ago I decided to give it a try, as I agree with some of the reviews here, the place could use and its in much need of care but, what can you demand of a lady who is nearly 80 years old? I loved the experience, (I promise I will get to the food in a minute) In times of globalization and Franchises that have made almost every town in U.S.A look the same, to get the opportunity  of experience  a place like  Schnacknbergs (specially in Hoboken) is a gift. I wish this place would be preserved by he Town of Hoboken.Now let me get to the food I ordered the ""boken burguer"" and I have to say It was one of the best burguers I have eaten in town and I will definnetly come back again and bring all my friends along for the experience.",Schnackenberg’s Luncheonette,3.5 star rating,$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Donuts,, Diners"
