Whether you're looking for some legit Malaysian food in NJ or interested in something steamed and healthy, Satay provides.I really enjoy their Hainanese Chicken Rice dish that comes with the tastiest ginger chicken broth flavored rice this side of the Hudson. I also love the roti canai appetizer and prawn mee noodle soup. The desserts are good too! Every time I dine in, I try something new and am yet to be disappointed.When I'm feeling super healthy, I always order one of the steamed meat and vegetable dishes from the menu. I love their steamed chicken with mixed vegetables and ordering a curry or other sauce for occasional dipping. One of these steamed dishes comes with rice noodles, which are also really good. Other restaurants in Hoboken and jersey city deliver steamed chicken and vegetables, but I find that Satay's steamed dishes are the best quality out of the many that I have tried.",Satay Malaysian Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,"Malaysian,, Chinese,, Asian, Fusion"

No thank you nothing. I stand by the door to get my jacket. The cashier asked the waitress, did they leave the tips? She went by the table and check and she told him yeah they left the tips.  BAD Service. Don't offer for discount with cash when you don't honor it.

I normally like to order a few appetizers with people and share. Roti Canai and Satay Tofu are two of my favorites. In general, I feel like a lot of the main dishes are quite oily whether it meat, noodle, etc... but that is just the style of cooking I'm pretty sure. The menu is a little too long for my liking, but everything on it is delicious! Most of the time I usually order Ice Kacang for Dessert, and enjoy the first few spoonfuls, but then it starts melting rather quickly and the flavors just get..... weird.

That soup was pungent, sour, spicy, salty, and a little sweet (everything a good tom yum should be) with a small bit of baby corn, a scallop or two, a couple of small shrimp, and a strip of surimi.

Three of us ordered online from the office and walked over 15 minutes later to find everything ready to go when we arrived. Online ordering is 10% off which made an already inexpensive lunch even better.Food was delicious - Curry soup had some mild spice and nice flavor. I asked for extra heat on my Mango Shrimp and was not disappointed. Seemed very fresh. The Hainanese rice was tasty. I'd give 5 stars if there were more Malaysian dishes on the lunch menu; seemed heavy on Chinese and Thai that I can get elsewhere- maybe I'll just need to come back for dinner to try some of the Malaysian entrees!,Satay Malaysian Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,"Malaysian,, Chinese,, Asian, Fusion"

The outer shell was dry and hard to cut with the knife let alone chew. The filling was a mystery, the only identifiable item being a small portion of crisp lettuce. I was advised they'd been steamed, I advised they'd not!The main dish was sizeable but in essence it was a mix of some tender but mostly very tough beef with a rich dark curry sauce poured over it. The beef had not been cooked in the sauce which in itself was gritty from the curry powder. The dish was nothing at all like any Rendang I'd ever been served up.The indifference of the staff when I voiced my view, both at the table and when i settled the bill was shocking.

I know effort when I taste it and I work in customer service, so I absolutely understand what is (or is not in this case) proper etiquette. I ordered delivery: 2 pad thai's with curry soup, as well as a coconut water. The food tasted like it was right out of a box you can find in the freezer aisle, next to the generic brand microwavable dinners. Although the food arrived in a timely matter, the noodles were soggy and the soup was unbelievably salty. It felt like I unscrewed a salt shaker and poured its content straight into my mouth- Bam Margera style. The coconut drink was never delivered with the rest of my food. When I called the restaurant to inquire about what happened, the employee actually yelled at me, telling me that I did not ascertain that I wanted the beverage and that there was absolutely no way she could have missed my order. There was no empathy, nor was there any attempt at rectifying the situation when I was clearly charged for the item. I was bewildered... not because I was losing five dollars, but because she was adamant that I was wrong... when in this case, I wasn't. It's sad. At the least, I thought our people were supposed to stick together. If you are hungry for good authentic cuisine, take the drive to Green Papaya in Hackensack. I promise it's worth the trip to be treated like a decent human being.

The rice is came with was very basic. It didn't tasted like how Hainanese chicken rice should - it tasted plain. The mee goreng was probably the best out of the bunch. Even though it was takeout, the noodles weren't soggy or anything. It was a little weird that it came with potatoes (or maybe the dish is supposed to have potatoes and I've been eating it wrong my whole life) but I would definitely order this again.

Where else can you get a choice of four soups, four different rice plus your entree for about $7? The restaurant is always packed during lunch on weekdays. In the summer they have sidewalk tables.Satay also offers an extensive Chinese menu. However, since I can get Chinese just about anywhere, I usually stick with the Malaysian dishes. It is the depth and flavor of their sauces that increase Satay's stars. I've had relatives visiting from California that say this is the best restaurant on their trip, and mostly due to the sauces. For the lunch specials, try something other than plain white rice and go for the Coconut rice or Hainanese rice. Both are aromatic and tasty. My favorite lunch specials are the Curry Chicken with Potato, Shrimp with Lemongrass, Dried Curry Shrimp and a fresh fish (usually grouper). The fish dish is the only one which I think the sauce is too sweet. The other dishes are spicy. They also have a number of vegetarian dishes, and good rice noodle and chow fun dishes that you can ask to spice up even more.The dinner menu is large and has many of my Malaysian favorites such as Kambing Rendang-Lamb with a thick, spicy coconut curry sauce; Ayam Hainanese-Steamed chicken; Ugang chili-Shrimp in red curry paste. Don't forget the Rorti Canai which comes with a great yellow curry chicken dipping sauce. So wonderful as an appetizer!The restaurant is BYOB which is one of the best things about dining in Hoboken.

I feel  like you get a mix between Thai and Indian - freshness from veggies and fruits but also rich savory curries and meats. Things I have tried are the Roti Canai, the Satay beef and chicken, Ayam Kelapa, Itik Tenngganu (duck). ALL of them are delicious, but I would say the Ayam Kelapa and the Itik Tenngganu are my favorite. If you're a fan of duck, you HAVE to get the Itik. The duck is tender and perfectly cooked with a curry sauce that is to die for. Great place!",Satay Malaysian Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,"Malaysian,, Chinese,, Asian, Fusion"

Good: Both for Dine-in and take-out.  Today for lunch husband and I saw the sign for 5% off and paid in cash. Now on to food.  ""Rendang"" is one of the signature curries in Malaysian Cuisine and this place serves pretty good Rendang-based dishes. Husband ALWAYS gets the chicken rendang. I know it must get boring for a lot of people getting the same thing, but my husband somehow never gets tired and orders the same thing. He has been in JC for almost 9 years and has tried a few things from here, but always goes back to getting Chicken Rendang. Service is always prompt and efficient.For me I have tried several dishes here. My favs include:- The Green Curry chicken (Chicken Hijau sans eggplant)- Lamb in Lemongrass (""Cheng-Mai"" sauce)- Curry Mixed Vegetables (in ""Rendang"" Sauce. this sauce has MSG)- Curry Soup (Vegetarian)- Soft Shell Crab dishes (Both in Rendang and Cheng-Mai Sauce)- Roti Canai (Appetizer)- Ginger Rice (among the other rice options served with the main entrees)Other dishes that have underwhelmed me:- Chilli Chicken (has lots of MSG in it, i believe) - Basil Chicken or Tofu- Lychee based drinks (I know the Lychees are from a can, hence my dislike)I have got delivery from this place a few times and have had no issues. Bad: I haven't had a bad experience at Satay so far. The restrooms are ok. The place is a tad small for large groups, but I have seen groups of at least 6-8 together, so I think it is doable to have more than 5 people seated together.Ugly: None.

I also asked what the Hainanese rice was and she just said ""rice"" and when I pressed further she said there was ginger in it. I thought I'd try the Hainanese chicken and the tomyum lunch specials. When I got home the rice was plopped on top of the entree for both dishes and when i moved the rice around I realized that there was a very smalllll portion of tomyum and about 3/4 rice. The Hainanese chicken was just steamed chicken on the bone with skin and wing tips. There was barely any meat, mostly joints, and what meat there was had no flavor at all.

We were a little indecisive about what fish we wanted, and the waitress was pretty helpful. We started with the yelp approved Roti Canai. I think this one was slightly overhyped... it comes with a super thin, light, airy, yet still crispy and chewey bread (wrap is more accurate actually), and a curry sauce with some chicken and potatoes in it. And when I say some I mean 2 pieces of chicken, and 1 piece of potato. Don't get me wrong... flavors were really spot on, but I kinda was thinking ""if you are going to put meat and potatoes in it, then do it, don't make it seem like an after thought."" Either way, for under $5, I would get it again with the expectation you are ordering it for the bread and sauce. Moved on to the Chow Kueb Teow noodle dish. The best way to describ this is an order of pad thai and an order of lo mein get drunk, walk into a seafood store, and do naughty things... this is what you get 9 months later. Rich noodles with some big shrimp, and tender squid (which has an excellent presentation - scored all along the outside gives it a great shape and texture). Totally recommend this.Finally, for the grand finale, we ordered the #91 (kampung ikan), which was the fried red snapper in a coconut curry. Oh man. Fan-freaking-tastic. Super flaky and moist fish and in incredibly rich sauce deep in curry flavors. Excellent yellow curry, to say the least. And check out the picture of this beast. Overall, I found the service to be totally fine, and the food to be really just excellent all around (just don't expect much meat in the Roti Canai!). Total for the Roti Canai, the noodles, and the whole fish (which was $26 by itself) came to $42 before tip. Absolute bargain for the amount of and quality of food you get here.

The Ayam Pandan chicken was dry with little flavor. The dipping sauce came on the side it was orange with a chili flake in it, but too sweet for the dry fried chicken. Also, I tried the Ayam Kelapa and it was drenched in sauce that had an unpleasant consistency.  You can get your white rice in a flavor instead of plain: choice of ginger white rice was also underwhelming.

GTFO. no, we don't want appetizers, for the fourth time. no, we don't want bubble tea, for the third time. no, we don't want dessert, for the SIXTH TIME. I want the green curry dish, I want it with chicken, I don't want it with some other meat or base, and I don't want coconut rice.2) not to hover over customers. dude was checking on us every two minutes and asking us about the food. at first it was funny, like he was our spirit guide or something providing assistance on a quest...but on the hundredth time, it was annoying as hell. 3) NEVER, EVER tell customers what to tip. our Best Malaysian Friend told us to just round it all to $80 and make it $20 a person. excuse me? for your annoyingly rude behavior that would make even a French person cringe? I deliberately made sure we left him $79.I hadn't been to Satay in a while, and I was hoping it would be as good as I recall.

While everything I've tried on the Malaysian menu has been excellent, the Ayam Trengganu (Hot) is one of the best dishes I've ever had.

Encased in this liquid gold (I save the leftover sauce to season my boring grilled chicken) is a healthy portion of eggplant, basil, tomato, chicken, and other veggies. Your rice options include coconut which goes perfectly with the dish.Note - Many of the Malaysian dishes are spicy, so if you are the type who shies from Indian or Thai in favor of bland, over salted, and greasy fare, stick with your local Chinese restaurant.ServiceDelivery in Hoboken is fast and the restaurant's servers are polite and attentive.",Satay Malaysian Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,"Malaysian,, Chinese,, Asian, Fusion"

Having picked out this place, my expectations for the quality of the seasoning, and the quality of the meat were high (pretty much every other review gave this place a 4-5 rating). However, upon having ordered the Walnut Shrimp, and tasted other plates at my table (poulty, pork, and lamb variety), I can infer from this eclectic sample that this place does not deserve the 4-5 star ratings it was getting.

Still.. something the 1st generation appreciates more than I.- me:  the soft shell crab with Chaing Mai style (idk why that's there as Chiang Mai is in Thailand but ok.. they also call out their Tom Yum so maybe this is a mixture of Thai and Malay?).  Unfortunately, this was not the best because the Chiang Mai is a thick curry that drowned the crispiness of the soft shell crab. I also prefer the crab to be overall more substantive, crispy and juicy.  My fault thought. I should have had the crispy chili sauce.. (give you four choices: tropical, chiang mail, chili pepper and salt and pepper)-mom: the chicken with ""dry curry""- a mixture of power and spices. I am unsure what this chicken dish was called, sadly but the curry was very dark, flavorful, oily (so beware if that's a thing), and tender.. tons of dark meat.  -Dad: the Siam shrimp- sweet and sour shrimp with a bit of corn starch going on. This is as most would say.. ""sweet and sour blah blah blah."" Not a fan of that combo. but that doesn't mean the dish wasn't good. All dishes are big portion and they came with your pick of rice- white, coconut and brown.  Coconut rice was a nice treat even tho it's bad for you. Since we got the higher end dinner dishes, it wasn't cheap- $60 was the total so it was some $20 an entree.  Service is good- fast, polite and informative.  They give you free tea (like in Chinese places- at least they do for Asian folk.. and per usual, we didn't get water. HA!).  The space itself is quite small.. only a few tables. So I wouldn't recommend bringing a large crew here.i would come back to try the more staple dishes Malaysia has to offer: stir fry noodles like Indian Mee Goreng and, noodle soups like Asam Laska, etc.",Satay Malaysian Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,"Malaysian,, Chinese,, Asian, Fusion"

I am allergic.""  He responds, ""No, no peanuts.""  Disaster averted for appetizer course...Then when it comes to order entree, we order soft shell crabs and mee goreng noodles (which on the menu does NOT say peanuts is an ingredient) to share family style.  I presume that since we just had a conversation about peanuts 4 minutes prior while ordering appetizer, I wouldn't have to have the same conversation again when ordering entrees.  When the dishes arrive, I see that the noodles are completely covered in crushed peanuts.  I reiterate to him that I cannot eat peanuts due to severe peanut allergy so can you please give us another order without peanuts?  The waiter responds ""You didn't specify no peanuts with this dish so just eat around the peanuts.""  EAT AROUND THE PEANUTS?  Does he realize he basically is telling me to have a severe allergic reaction in his restaurant and possibly die?  I couldn't believe my ears since every single restaurant I've had this occur at throughout the world has always been very quick to give me a completely new dish without peanuts.  He started arguing with me that even though I told him I was allergic to peanuts during the Roti Canai ordering, that wasn't specified for the entree and therefore I should just eat around it.  Again.  Even after I told him I'd possibly die from eating a single trace of peanut.  The guy basically told me I should risk death in his restaurant.  Ummm, no thanks.I was ready to walk out of the restaurant but my husband, ever the pacifist, just told me he would eat the noodles and I'd eat the entire soft shell crab order.  I was unhappy but complied because it was late and it was freezing outside.Needless to say, I will not be back to a restaurant that does not understand food allergy or respect the customer enough to honor their health concerns.  I'd seriously suggest anyone with a nut allergy to stay away from this restaurant.",Satay Malaysian Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,"Malaysian,, Chinese,, Asian, Fusion"

There was a seitan ""veggie chicken nugget"" thing in brown sauce with mixed vegetables that was awesome, and then it disappeared or was moved from the lunch specials to one of the other two menus (there are too many menus at Satay). So I started getting the tofu and veggie pad Thai. It's unique among the pad Thais I've had. The tofu is crunchy on the outside, deep fried, and the overall dish is a dark chestnut color from the rich tamarind base, which combines sweetness with a kind of nuttiness. Bean sprouts, peanuts, and crunchy fried onions decorate the top. The sauce can be modified for spiciness and any ingredient can be added or removed at your request: eggs, bean sprouts, basil, etc. I always ask for a side of sambal. Their prices are generous as well. The lunch portion costs about $7.50 and includes a cup of soup, but the portions are large enough for the dinner menu. The staff is always friendly and accommodating. Satay is my go-to lunch spot in Hoboken. Their hidden gem is the currie soup. Not the entree portion, which is loaded with potatoes and overly complex; the simple tofu, cabbage, onion soup that's served with lunch, just before the main course. I have a friend who's tried to buy pints of it to go. I get the sense that Satay sees their stripped down currie soup as an economy version or filler.

I must say that this is one of the best snack/meals in town for under $5. For those who don't know - Roti Canai (pronounced ""chanai,"" not ""kanai"") is a type of flatbread found in Malaysia. It is known as roti prata in Southern Malaysia and Singapore, and is similar to the Indian Kerala porotta. Basically a very thin flat bread tortilla pancake.The side dish that comes with it has potato and tender chicken in a green sauce. The sauce is tasty and has a little heat to it, which is nice. I recommend this to anyone who likes Indian food or curry. MMMMmmm can't wait till I order it again. They have another version that comes pre-stuffed with goodness.Also tried the Singapore noodles, which were like Mei Fun (rice noddles). since I'm such a spice nut I also tried the Chili Chicken (not to be confused with the Chicken with Chili sauce). The Noodles tasted good, but the shrimps in the dish were not cleaned properly, since you could see the black vein in the tail. I passed over them instead of taking a chance with anything that might have been frozen. Not a bad dish. Would most likely ask them to replace the shrimp with chicken or tofu if I ordered it again. The Chili Chicken seemed like their take on Kung Pow. Juicy white meat chunks fried and tossed with some onions, garlic, and chili paste. Enjoyed this dish, but could have used some veggies to go along with the protein. I plan on trying this place again and ordering some new stuff I've never had before. Update to follow.

That caught my attention.So I looked at the reviews and My Yelp friend Jeff M  from Jersey gave it 5 stars too! yelp.com/user_details?us…The crowd was mixed not a Williamsburg type of crowd. It was a group of sophisticated diners. They were ethnically mixed. Asians, Africans (from Africa) Mexicans, Indian/Pakistanis, an ethnically diverse crowd. If I walked in and saw all white bread of America maybe with their ""hot"" Asian girlfriends I would not be impressed.  But the food is good so that is why it draws all kinds of people.First of all I am allergic to shell fish so I couldn't order what Jeff suggested. We first ordered Roti Canai as an appetizer. Coconut rice to go with everything. Then 3 entrees. Each Entree was a flavor explosion! The first was an egg tofu dish. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To…Really unique and not only delicious but of high quality unlike the trash heap in Elmhurst. Malaysia Grill in Manhattan is one of my favorite restaurants in the 5 boros. yelp.com/biz/malaysia-gr…They are getting bombed by fake reviews but I gave it 5 stars as it compares to all of the other Malaysian restaurants in the 5 boros. yelp.com/biz/malaysia-gr…My hubby asked which I liked better we couldn't decide. We had different things. Both are really good! I only compare the same cuisines. For example if I gave a rare cuisine 5 stars it doesn't mean I think it is better than all of the other restaurants I have ever been to but it means the best of that cuisine. This at lest ties with Malaysia Grill.We had a grouper dish with Coconut curry. It was unique and addictive! Finally we had the duck with Plum sauce simple and delicious!If you think the Malaysian trash hole in Elmhurst is good, go there! Save this for discriminating diners!

Server was very rushed and short, which we're used to in restaurants that are very authentic. They're running a business and it's a different culture, understandable.

I ordered the Ayam Tropical aka Mango Chicken. The lime ""broth"" was VERY sweet/sour and I wish it had a bit more of a heavy spice to it or even a little less of the lime broth, but the red onion cut through the dish perfectly and I paired it with the coconut rice which was a nice mellow choice. The chicken was cooked beautifully and I had plenty to take home with me for lunch the next day.My boyfriend ordered the Masak Nenas with chicken. It came IN half a pineapple.

I have a bit more faith in people, but it took a bit of arguing with my parents, while the waitress just stood there and watched us.Sam: Why would we take it home?  What will we do with it?Dad: Someone in our house will eat it.Sam: But I'm the only one in our family who isn't vegetarian.Mom: We'll give it to someone.Sam: Who?Mom: We'll give it to him (referring to my boyfriend)Sam: He's on a plane back to Chicago tonight.Mom:  He can take it on the plane.Sam: Soup?  Seafood Soup on a plane?Mom: Why not?Sam's boyfriend: Uh. . . Sam: Okay.  That's enough from everyone.I had to put my foot down - the waitress seemed unhappy about it - frankly, I expected a bit more from NJ-NYC area - most places around here are happy to take your food back and fix it if they screw up, especially since all they really had to do was take out the egg noodles and put in rice noodles, which is what - like twenty cents?  But she did take it out and bring me the right dish, with some prodding, and repeated, gentle statements from me saying ""I'm sorry, but it's just not what I ordered.""  Sort of sucks that they put us in the position of having to ask so many times, though.The dish was all right - the shrimp wasn't deveined, which grossed me out, but I recognize that deveined shrimp is a personal preference and not traditional for many ethnic foods.    But it was perfectly seasoned, and very light.The rest of my party raved about their food - a little bit of sampling from me, and I had to agree with them.  My dad got the eggplant in bean sauce - very, very fatty and greasy, but pretty damn delicious.  My mother got a steamed tofu and veggie dish with no rice, and my boyfriend got something similar with chicken. I truly think they take guesses about the customers and season appropriately - my bf's dish was WAY less spicy than my mothers, which was the right choice.  At the end, we ordered bubble tea - my bf and I both ordered the almond milk tea, and the waitress insisted that we order one, and I could taste it and order another if I wanted.  Seemed weird, but she was right - I tasted his and it was too much sugar, and I asked for mine with half the sugar. My parents were happy with their ""malaysian milk coffee.""Overall, excellent experience - if it weren't for the misunderstanding, it would be a solid five stars just for pleasing my parents and boyfriend in the same meal, which I'd imagine to be goddamned impossible.",Satay Malaysian Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,"Malaysian,, Chinese,, Asian, Fusion"

The entrees on their menu range from Malaysian to Thai to Chinese so their name is a bit misleading. I stay away from the Chinese food because that's not what I go here for.I love roti canai and theirs is great - the roti has a good balance of softness on the inside and crispiness on the outside and the curry dipping sauce is tasty. I've been to other restaurants that serve smaller and/or subpar roti for the same price. This is probably the reason their roti canai is so highly recommended by others.They have a bunch of lunch specials for about $6-7 and come with a choice of soup and a choice of rice. However, I usually order entrees to share with others in my group. I like their pad thai but I order the chow kueh teow as an alternative. In the past I've ordered and liked the prawn mee, Malaysian pork chop, kangkung, and bubble teas.It's a modest space but I've never had to wait for a table.

I guess she was checking if there was still something in the container. I don't remember them being this rude during my countless visits prior to that day.

My dining companion got a meat and fried rice dish that came wrapped in a lotus leaf, which he devoured with gusto. We both got bubble teas, which were fantastic. Satay sort of seemed like it wasn't sure what kind of restaurant it wanted to be. The decor was that of a nice restaurant, but the pictures of food on the wall and the cramped tables made me feel like I was in a grab-and-go Asian restaurant.

And my memory tells me that their dishes are kind of heavy on the taste.For appetizers, we had Roti Canai (Indian Pancake served with curry chicken) and Ayan Pandan, which is deep fried chicken wrapped in screwpine pandan leaves. It's very tender and tasty.For entrees, we ordered most of the dishes from the chef special list to share. Aromatic Coconut Shrimp: good taste at beginning but getting saltier as you eat on.Clay Pot Noodles Soup: just okay.Curry Grouper: just okay.Terengganu Duck: very tender duck, interesting combination.Seafood Taro Nest: the sauce is too salty.Overall, not as spicy as we would like but much more salty than we can handle.",Satay Malaysian Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,"Malaysian,, Chinese,, Asian, Fusion"

Yes, there are much better Malaysian restaurants out there and the space is tight, but its Hoboken, which is hardly the culinary mecca of the world or going to become one anytime soon. The Roti Kanai was nice - I've had better and the chicken curry is hardly memorable, but then again, no one goes out to eat based on a superior Roti Kanai.We had two entrees: The much-touted Nasi Bamboo and the Ayam Basil. I was a fan of the Nasi Bamboo - sure, its basically fried rice with bits of chicken and a couple of cooked in shrimp, but it hits the spot (3.5/5). As for the Ayam Basil, a chicken dish with basil and ginger, I requested some satay sauce on the side because it was otherwise insipid (1.5/5). The bubble tea was pretty comparable to what I've had at other places. Service was super-fast and the prices are circa $10 for entrees ($15 for the ""specials""). That taken into consideration, I'd go back to Satay, but stick to what yelp users recommend (Mostly the Nasi dishes).

Not being Malaysian, I can't vouch for its authenticity but I think Pan-Asian Malaysian is a better description for Satay. (But then again Malaysian culture in itself is very Pan-Asian, with Chinese, Indian, and other SE Asian influences in addition to native Malaysian culture.)Before anything else, make sure you start with the Roti Canai, one of the best appetizers in the world, basically a type of Indian bread that you dip in heavenly curry sauce w/ a chunk of beef or chicken for flavor. Now you can proceed ...I love the little twists Satay has on otherwise common Asian-American fastfood dishes such as Pad Thai and General Tso's Chicken. The twist here is that both have an atypical tangy, salty flavor that I love. The great thing about them is that you can either try these familiar dishes or be more adventurous.The second option, the more adventurous route, is really why I love this place. First, there's their Nasi Lotus which is Fried Rice wrapped in lotus leaf, always a surefire winner. Or you can try the Kang Kong Belachan, my ultimate favorite. Kang kong is a SE Asian vegetable, really crunchy and grows easily which is why it's popular in my native Philippines. This dish is cooked w/ yummy, spicy, and salty shrimp paste. Another unusual (for the U.S. at least) dish is Chicken w/ Bittermelon, aka bitter gourd. For moderately experimental diners, explore their slightly different (fried) rice dishes esp. the Nasi Lemak, my 2nd favorite Nasi dish. Their mango chicken is another one you may want to try, a little more mainstream but good, nonetheless.For dessert and sweets, I like their peanut pancake the most and I make it a ritual to order their kiwi smoothie. Their bubble tea is good but I've had better, worth a try though if you've never had it before. I also frequent 2 other Malaysian places, both in Manhattan, mostly for the kang kong, strangely absent in Filipino restos, but I keep coming back because they're good. The same can be said for Satay which is my standby Malaysian restaurant in NJ.

I figured that they wouldn't have much flavoring going on so i asked specifically to add garlic and they did which made the dish 10x better than had it been without the garlic. we also tried the roti canai which was a good spice level but was very watery in comparison to most others i've had. the dish itself was nice but of course a bit pricey. we were disappointed that they had hainese chicken on their lunch menu but did not have it on the dinner menu. we were also quite disturbed at one point when a flying cockroach made its way around the tables but the workers quickly spotted it and killed that. but still it was the size of a pinky/ring finger!!",Satay Malaysian Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,"Malaysian,, Chinese,, Asian, Fusion"

The curry soup that I ordered had depths of flavor that I would have never imagined. It was fabulous. I would go back if everything else hadn't been so WRONG. Now let's get to the bad. My friend and I made the mistake of ordering the fried shrimp dumplings. Unfortunately, I failed to look down at the first dumpling that I ate. My friend on her second dumpling noticed that the shrimp had not been deveined. We cut another in half and sure enough that hadn't been deveined either. We told the waitress we didn't want them and that they hadn't been cleaned. Her response was that the shirmp are too small to remove the vein. Onto the entrees, my entree was tasty my friends however was a chicken dish that was stringy and texturaly bizzare. When we received the bill, what do you know, the full price for the appetizer was listed. After complaining to another waitress, $3 was removed from the bill. We were told the full value could not be removed because we ate 3 of the dumplings. I cook quite frequently and the shrimp were large enough to remove the veins.In conclusion, if you want great soup, enjoy eating the intestinal tract of shrimp and like the taste of grit in your mouth as well as subpar service,  Satay is the place for you.",Satay Malaysian Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,"Malaysian,, Chinese,, Asian, Fusion"

The curry wasn't quite as spicy as I would've liked, but it was a little sweet and still very tasty. Wish there was more eggplant because it was cooked well :) The one bowl of rice that comes with the curry definitely isn't enough, though. They need to work on the proportions a bit.

We were walking around Hoboken and saw to our surprise that the place had a lunch special, very affordable! Four of us ate for $25! And the food was pretty great! The noodles were fresh (although a tad oily), and the curries were fresh, light, and extremely flavorful. The parothha (Malayasian bread) and chicken curry, which we ordered as an appetizer, was very good.  The only disappointment was the seaweed soup, which smelt too fishy to be palatable. Not sure if the seaweed was old or the soup was bad. We left that. The only reason I would not give this place 5 stars is because the wait staff can be a little short. We couldn't really understand the waitress at all, and she, we think, couldn't understand us.

They have about 2 dozen lunch specials for about $6-$7 per entree, and include choice of rice (try the ginger or coconut rice) and choice of soup.Stopped by for a very late lunch. They were kind enough to serve me the lunch special menu. Usually I 'll get something with chicken or shrimp. Since I had such an amazing time recently at Pukk, I decided to try the Eggplant with Black Bean sauce, with the ginger rice and the curry soup. And I also order a almond milk bubble tea (a favorite).The curry soup was delish, as was the rice, but I could not eat the eggplant. Black bean sauce is a favorite of mine, but I don't like it here. Today, it  didn't seem fresh, and I started getting nauseated after just a couple bites. I knew instantly that I would not be able to eat another bite let alone finish it. I can't remember that happening before; I can usually eat anything. The server came over to inquire about the food, and immediately without hesitation offered to replace the dish. I accepted graciously. I can't remember sending a dish back, at least not since that incident at Spago's of Beverly Hills. I'll have to yelp that one sometime.The replacement I ordered was the Pad Thai with Chicken. It's not their best dish, but  I have a soft spot for Pad Thai. Today the Pad Thai was so fresh and yummy. I gobbled it down quickly. I also got a lychee green bubble tea (another fav).I find their bubble teas extremely sweet, but apparently people really like them that way. The success of Starbuck's fancy drinks is proof of that fact.  I would prefer my drinks less sweet, but they are so delicious and so addictive. Ask for less sugar, if you also prefer your drinks less sweet. Also good is the Malaysian Milk Tea, but they have over a dozen different milk or green bubble teas, so pick your favorite.They have fresh coconuts. You must drink the fresh coconut, if you've never had it. You get to drink coconut juice through a straw right from the fruit with a hole punched into it. Way cool. I love scraping out and eating the fresh coconut flesh, after drinking the juice.I was afraid that today's unfortunate incident was going to severely affect their rating. However, the response was so quick and accommodating. Satay has built up a lot of points with me over the years, and i've never had any problems. That history must count for something.

Appetizer: Penang Lobak (like a Chinese pu-pu platter), Deep fried pork mix wrapped in Yuba (Bean curd skin), fried tofu and shrimp pancake, served with Hoisin sauce and some sambal chili sauce.  (It was okay, but I've definitely had better)2. Main dishes:Nasi Lemak with Beef Rendang.  Coconut milk rice with achar (pickled vegetables),  hard boiled eggs, cucumber slices, sambal (spicy sauce)and Beef Rendang (beef cooked in coconut milk and spices for several hours).  The dish was good overall, just a few comments in that the beef could be more tender.Shrimp Char kway teow.  Fried flat noodles with prawns (dark sweet soy sauce, eggs, bean sprouts, chili and chives).  Asked for it to be spicy and that is what we got.  Very good. (Meaning, not soggy, dry and a bit charred/burnt)3. Drink:  Iced Coffee (Very good, a bit on the rich side though)Verdict:  3.5 Stars (Between A-OK and Yay I'm a Fan.)The ambiance was nice, service was very good.The quality of service rounds up the rating closer to 4 stars.",Satay Malaysian Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,"Malaysian,, Chinese,, Asian, Fusion"

The service varies from decently attentive to forgetful, and once deliberate avoidance (they once had dropped my husband's plate of food after they brought mine out, so every server was playing ""stay out of sight"" of our table while they rushed to make his dish again - no explanation to us at all, so I sat there for about 20 mins while my food got cold... waiting for his dish to come out. Found out the reason for the delay afterwards since his noodles were undercooked (definitely one of the worse experiences).The (Roti Canai) indian pancake here is one of my favorites. The pancake comes out light and fluffy and there is always plenty of curry sauce to dip with. Only thing is that each dipping dish only comes with one or two pieces of solid food (sometimes chicken, sometimes potato), but I have no complaints since the appetizer is only around 3 dollars and is fun to share.The beef chow fun here is not too oily, has pieces of real beef, and has both a decent flavor and texture.  It's more expensive than what I'm used to paying at a cart ($13 instead of $7) but I can't really fault the price given that it's at a sit down restaurant.I liked the Tulang Api (Fried spare ribs with Malaysian BBQ sauce) and you get a good portion too for $14.The fried rice is really nothing special. I have also tried a few of their flavored fried rices (coconut, pineapple, etc), and have generally found them dry and lacking in flavor. The other dishes are not very memorable.

It comes with sliced pieces of curried beef, sauteed eggplant, baby corn in a yummy curry sauce. I usually order it with the ginger rice, it helps to cool down the curry a bit. Chris usually gets the Sizziling Beef which is thinly sliced sauteed beef in a black bean pepper sauce.

Aromatic Coconut Shrimp - jumbo shrimps with crispy egg thread in coconut aroma and curry leaves. == I had two shrimps. That was it. Because the egg and coconut aroma was good enough for me. The taste is just something different. Distinctively ethnic Asian. It is fried and very greasy. I love it.2. Lamb with Lemon Grass - sauteed sliced lamb in spicy curry leaves with bell peppers and lemongrass. == It was not even spicy, at least not for me. Maybe because I have already developed a higher tolerance for spiciness.The servings were big enough for 3 people to share. I had to force myself to stop eating and just promise that i will come back soon - probably next week.We ended the meal with an Ice Kachang.

406,lGYogdBkyhJQG_ab8zMoRA,Jocelyn C.,4.0 star rating,"Was really excited to see this in Hoboken. The ambience is really great, and staff are very friendly. I came here with a friend for a dinner, and ordered the roti canai as starters. It tasted pretty good (how i know? I am malaysian myself). However things went a lil downhill after that. We ordered chicken rendang and char kuey teow (something similar to drunken noodle) . The chicken rendang was a let down because that is NOT how chicken rendang supposed to look/taste like. I think they took an instant curry packet paste and mix it in with the chicken...the char kuey teow was pretty good. We ordered shaved ice for dessert and I felt like I was only eating ice with condensed milk and rose water on it. The grassjelly and other ingredients are so few that it is not worth ordering this if I come here again. Yes, I will definitely patronize this place again because their lunch special is $6.50 only. I would have given this place a 3-star, had not been the friendliness of the staff there.",Satay Malaysian Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,"Malaysian,, Chinese,, Asian, Fusion"

On a not-so-crowded Saturday night (8pm on Sept. 10), we entered Satay and stood in the front of the restaurant for several minutes waiting to be seated. The servers passed by us several times and looked at us like we were aliens and just as I was disgusted by the blatant expression of racism, the owner asks us ""Can I help you?' as if we were misfits. At this point I wanted to leave, but my boyfriend wanted to say so we did. We finally were seated in the fairly-empty restaurant and once again waited for a while for a server to finally come to the table though they walked by constantly. It was a very uncomfortable experience. We finally ordered and the food was pretty good but the service was still lackluster. The manager came over to the table to ask how the food was (I suppose to make up for the lame service) but it still wasn't enough to make me want to go back to that restaurant again though the food was promising.",Satay Malaysian Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,"Malaysian,, Chinese,, Asian, Fusion"

410,L_irXuiKCd92JvKbM_hWrA,betty e.,5.0 star rating,"I've gone here a couple of times but last night, I had the dish that earns this place 5 stars! It was the Butternut Squash curry, under the weirdly named section ""Fruit Specials"". Yes, their Pad Thai and their Pad See You (that's what I call it) is good, but for a change, I wanted curry. I like my curry dishes with a hearty amount of vegetables and this dish was brimming with squash, eggplant and okra. My add-on was chicken. And it was served with coconut rice, which tasted a bit like rice cooked in chicken stock. This dish is perfect for a cold winter day. The curry is a yellow curry which could have been a little spicier but hey, I was happy to be able to eat mouthfuls without stopping for water. My bf had the Kueh Teow Noodle Soup. The soup was good but tasted like a Chinese noodle soup. There was too much liquid and not enough Thai/Malaysian spice. This time my bf loved my dish, usually it's the other way around. For the appetizer, we had the Poh Piah, a cooked spring roll. I could have had 3 orders of that and made it my meal, they were so good. We closed with Mango Sticky Rice. Considering mangos are off season, I was surprised to see it as a special. I thought it was kind of small but then it is a dessert. And I was introduced to coconut jam! Gotta try if if you haven't. I can eat the jam like pudding. :)",Satay Malaysian Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,"Malaysian,, Chinese,, Asian, Fusion"

Soft shell crab is hit-and-miss. Coconut curry ribs has always been good. When offered what type of rice to go with your entree, avoid coconut rice at all costs. I generally stick to plain or ginger rice.  The conclusion is depending on what you order on the menu, this could be a really good restaurant, or a very average one.",Satay Malaysian Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$$,"Malaysian,, Chinese,, Asian, Fusion"

They try to make their food authentic though I find they use way too much oil and the richness of flavor is quite lacking. This is understandable for a cheap and fast restaurant though. The dine-in experience is quite ok, but their service is quite poor when taking orders over the phone for delivery or takeout (it's still a 100% hit rate for bad service after all this time). They speak like the customer is begging them for a favor and wasting their time - they are extremely curt, distant, do not greet or thank, and speak in rude tone. They also didn't apologise when they got my order grossly wrong once.That said, I consider this place cheap, fast food (for lunch) and will continue giving them my business.
