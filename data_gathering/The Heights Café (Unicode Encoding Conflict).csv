0,ay5KighJOQrr-3V1CgsOYg,Ethan C.,5.0 star rating,"This place has gone through a few iterations over the two years I lived next to it. My Italian contractor used to rave about their espresso. However, in past versions, it felt like an insulated group of regulars, and I was hesitant to go in. However, with this latest re-branding, they are a warm and inviting place (I'm sure they were before too, I just didn't know!). The espresso is still great, and the pastries are wonderful.  In particular, their empanadas are the absolute best in the Heights, and they experiment a little with them.  This morning I had my usual Bacon & Egg, and also tried their new Prosciutto and Mozzarella, both were fantastic.  Also a fan of their Beef & Sweet Plantain one.  Grabbing quick breakfast now on my way to work has become part of my daily routine here and I can't believe I lived next to this place for so long and missed out!  A great locally owned business that everyone should support!",The Heights Café,4.5 star rating,,"Cafes,, Coffee, &, Tea,, Desserts"
1,D_iNx74a5u3PYT1A5OkYdg,Omni V.,4.0 star rating,This place deserved a good spot on Central Avenue.  It is tucked on Franklin's with low visibility.  The pastries are fresh and flakey.   The coffee is brewed to perfection with no after taste.   The kale and cheese empanadas are on the savory and delicious side.  Highly recommend this place.  I go back every time I am near.,The Heights Café,4.5 star rating,,"Cafes,, Coffee, &, Tea,, Desserts"

I cant wait to walk by there daily and either regret not buying something or walk in and try something new.",The Heights Café,4.5 star rating,,"Cafes,, Coffee, &, Tea,, Desserts"
