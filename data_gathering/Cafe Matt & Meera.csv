Service was attentive and our server was very helpful. For example, when my son wasn't sure whether he wanted to have the freshly squeezed watermelon juice, the server was kind enough to bring us a sample. My son didn't like it but my wife did!We started with the Naanchos which is an Indian take on traditional nachos. Just replace salsa and sour cream with tamarind and mint sauce and you get the picture. I was having second thoughts when the dish came to the table but it actually tasted great! We also had a plate of the tandoori chicken wings which were phenomenal. They were tender and flavorful and upon asking, the server confirmed that they had been marinaded for 3 days. These are a must try if you like tandoori wings!We were feeling a little full at this point so the four of us (2 kids and 2 adults) decided to share the Kashmiri lamb with rice, garlic naan and paratha. The naan was just how we like it, soft and tender rather than the crispy and burnt fare you sometimes get at other establishments. The paratha was decent, nothing out of the ordinary. The lamb however was sublime. The curry was thick with a slight kick whereas the lamb itself was tender and broke easily when attacked with a piece of naan. Dessert was a mixed bag. We had Gulab Jamun Creme Brulee and the Hyderbadi Bread Pudding. The former was fantastic whereas the latter was not to our taste.In conclusion, if you're hankering for good quality Indian food, this place should be near the top of your list!",Cafe Matt & Meera,4.0 star rating,$$,"Indian,, Tapas/Small, Plates"

The cauliflower looked delicious but didn't have any distinctive taste other than tomatoes. Definitely best of the food though amongst what we ordered. The mint paneer tikka didn't get the memo that it was meant to be minty. That tasted of nothing but paneer and the chutney was bland and tasteless too. The grilled vegetables accompanying this were too oily to try. The kofta gravy again tasted only of tomatoes (reminded me of ketchup) and the naan bread wasn't warm and didn't seem too fresh. The kofta itself was dry inside and was basically a ball of fried vegetables. There's supposed to be melting cheese inside. The water was terrible.

My fellow desis can probably relate that Indian restaurants seldom reach your expectations and you leave feeling guilty that you wasted your time, money, and your calories on something that mom could've made 100x better at home. Even restaurants that have amazing reviews, I end up being so disappointed in. Seriously... why is it SO DAMN HARD to find good Indian food?! That being said, Cafe Matt & Meera knocked my socks off! The boyfriend, puppy, and I came here last Saturday evening after seeing the reviews on Yelp. Like I mentioned, I typically don't like going out to eat Indian, but looking at their unique menu, the foodie in me had to give it a shot. We all thoroughly enjoyed our outdoor dining experience. I've honestly been raving it to my family and friends since! Here's a lil break down for ya: - Food - delicious!!!! The paneer makhani is hands down the best Punjabi shaak I've had for as long as I can remember. - Menu - it took everything in me not to order half the menu... There is legit something for everyone! Ranging from your classics to fusions.

For $9 you can choose from 6!entrees, a soup, rice & naan and two sweets. Of the 6 entrees, 3 are chicken and the other 3 vegetarian dishes. My favorite of them all is Tal Tadka (lentil) and very much enjoyed the vermicelli dessert (basically a rice pudding). I would have liked some garlic naan (only plain ones are available) and lamb, but I suppose you can't ask for too much for just $9. Server brought water swiftly after I sat down and they refilled the food promptly. Ambience is nice too.

The idea to blend Indian and American food is brilliant. I quickly took note of the affable service. Once seated, we immediately received a water pitcher infused with lemon. Our drinks came out quickly thereafter. I had mango lassi which was standard, and my boyfriend had pineapple juice. Both drinks were served in cute little mason jars. Unfortunately, his pineapple juice tasted a bit diluted from the ice. We ordered naanchos with lamb ($9), the butter chicken and red chilli pizza ($9), and a chicken tikka kati roll ($8). The naanchos are a bowl of crispy naan chips with masala cheese, chutney, and other toppings such as onions and peppers. This dish was really good, but next time I wouldn't add the meat. While the naanchos were warm and nicely coated with cheese and yummy goodness, the lamb was cold. I really wish it was at least room temperature. The butter chicken and red chilli pizza was solid. Note that it's not actual butter chicken on the pizza, but tandoori chicken. The sauce has a hint of butter masala. My boyfriend and I both wished that it had more sauce. We also would have liked more of a soft buttery naan for the base, as the pizza has a very thin crust; though I understand that it may be hard to pull off while creating a pizza. My favorite dish that we ordered was the chicken tikka kati roll. One kati roll split between two will start to fill you up. To explain in American terms, it was the size of a burrito. It was filled with chicken tikka and was nice and spicy! All of the flavor surrounded by a soft roti was delicious. Again, my boyfriend would have liked some more butter, but I was happy to leave without feeling like I needed to unbutton my pants.

When I asked her if the pakora was traditional or more like onion bhaji, she said traditional (it was actually bhaji and she was obviously guessing).The food: The onion bhaji tasted OK but was dry and crumbly. The chicken Thali looked nice but was tasteless and bad. All I ended up eating was the small serving of rice and yellow dhal. Everything else was too appalling. My friend ordered the butter chicken and what he got was rubbery chicken in a kind of Indian tomato soup. The closest thing it kind of tasted like would be a jalfrezi. But it was inedible.

Also, they've recently changed the menu & ruined what I considered their signature dish which was called ""Lasooni Ghobi""--it was a delicious & unique spicy fried cauliflower with a tomato sauce but they changed the batter & sauce and are now calling it ""Genral Tso's"" which is awful! Not to mention a better frozen version can be purchased at Trader Joe's. The former cauliflower dish was basically the only reason I kept going there & tolerating the frustration and aggravation of senselessly bad service; and they now offer even fewer vegetarian & vegan options so there's really nothing there for me anymore.

We started with Masala chips, which was nothing but potato chips with some masala on top and chutney by the side. We expected it to be warm and crisp but it came out to be exactly opposite - cold and soft. Then we ordered 2 other small plate dishes, Avocado Sev Puri and Quinoa Tikki Chat. Both tasted extremely good, but what disappointed us was their portion size. Lastly we ordered a main course dish, Mint Paneer Tikka. This was the worst Paneer tikka I ever had. The dish had 5 pieces of mildly marinated and lightly grilled Paneer, a small portion of raw mango salad, a small portion of rice and some raita. Taste wise and portion size wise equally disappointing.",Cafe Matt & Meera,4.0 star rating,$$,"Indian,, Tapas/Small, Plates"

I had the water, which is a step above the rest.  My group of four went through three pitchers, which was infused with fruit. Lemon, lime and mint.  I really appreciate this touch of detail that came at no cost.",Cafe Matt & Meera,4.0 star rating,$$,"Indian,, Tapas/Small, Plates"

It used to be a great place to catch up on indian fusion food. But over the past few months the quality has been going down a lot. I hate to say this, but seems like they no longer care for their customer's satisfaction and quality control has simply gone missing. My most recent experience with them was one of the worst delivery experiences EVER with any restaurant in JC area. I ordered nanchos, breads and curry. The nanchos were completely soggy upon delivery and had bare minimal salsa dressing, etc with it. The breads were totally uncooked and cold. I called up the restaurant to complain and they had no resolution and seemed like they didn't even want to make an effort.

I loved the sauce - savory, tangy, with a bit of a kick.Chicken Tikka Dosa - Not a traditional dosa that you might get in an authentic place in Jersey City or in the city, but still very good. My friend loved the mint sauce that came with it. I think she finished the whole thing.Grilled salmon salad - good but not the top dish at this restaurant. We really just wanted to veggies to balance out the meal. Instead, we really should have ordered another small plate, or one of the man course dishes.Atmosphere - small cafe style place.

He produces a type of cuisine that a fusion between American/Latin and Indian, which honestly is pretty hard to do well, but Matt & Meera makes it look easy. When we catered an event, guests would randomly ask me, ""wow, where'd you get this food?! It's awesome!""

The lassi had the right taste, but the consistency could be thicker. The masala chai came out without milk which was odd to me. In India that tea has milk in it already. I have not seen it served black. The drinks made me worry a bit, but luckily the food came thru.The chips were great. On the spicy side with mint chutney. The dosas were good. It is the closest a gluten free person can get to crepe. It was made well. The lamb was ground meat with red onions.

103,bkSIgqXIpEaDshS4DfQj2g,Sahil S.,3.0 star rating,"I came here on a recommendation from a friend. As a fan of Indian fusion, I had to try this restaurant's take on it.The ambiance seemed more functional than anything, bereft of any decorations or Indian motifs. The table itself felt like it was made from the same material as park benches. There wasn't a maitre d so we kind of wandered around aimlessly until someone caught our eye. They sat us on one of the high chairs in the middle of the room, despite our reservations. Then they realized there was an open booth in the corner and relocated us. I think having a dedicated host would avoid such disorganization.Finally we settled in and had to wait a little while until the server arrived. I overheard the couple next to us complaining about slow service as well. My friend and I ordered naanchos, guacamole bhel puri, and their chicken tikka kati roll.Naanchos (4/5) - Fusion with a punny name - I had to try it. The naan chips were very crispy, although they just as well could have been pita chips and I wouldn't know the difference. It's hard to mess up nachos, and this was definitely my favorite part of the meal. The hot and sweet chutneys were a great combination with the Mexican elements of the nachos, and in the end we had a yummy fusion soup to scoop up.Bhel puri (3/5) - These weren't bad, but I wonder why they chose to fill the puris with guacamole of all things. Traditional bhel puris are filled with a spicy, sinus clearing mint juice, and the guac captured none of that rich flavor I love. It just came out bland in comparison.Chicken kati roll (2/5) - In terms of portions, this was definitely the best bang for the buck. But the sweet sriracha sauce they used fell far short of the mark. It just didn't pair well with the tikka masala at all, and we didn't end up finishing it.Conclusion: Fusion is always a game of risk, and I wonder if these guys really thought through the flavors they were combining from Mexican and Indian cuisines. A lot of it seemed like fusion for the sake of fusion.",Cafe Matt & Meera,4.0 star rating,$$,"Indian,, Tapas/Small, Plates"

We ordered the Butter Chicken & Red Chilli Naan Pizza ($8), which was good. It was smaller than I expected though. I also thought the crust would taste more...naan-like, chewier and a little thicker. Instead, it was thin and crispy. We still really enjoyed it though - very tasty. One thing that could have made it better maybe is if they used smaller pieces of chicken (in greater quantity), or maybe dark meat. For our entrees, we had the Basil Chicken Tikka and the Old Delhi Butter Chicken. The butter chicken was delicious - the sauce was great, very rich and tasty. Went great with the rice and the chicken. The basil chicken tikka wasn't what I expected - it was a bit drier than I had hoped it would be. I also have never had basil chicken tikka, so I didn't know what to expect - I thought it would be more like your typical Chicken Tikka Masala, but it's not. Not their fault, and it was still not bad, but the Old Delhi Butter Chicken was WAY better and definitely more bang for your buck (the Basil Chicken Tikka was only a few pieces of chicken).Service: Service was pretty slow. Our appetizer came out at a somewhat reasonable time, but it felt like foreverrrr before our entrees came out. It was strange too because not one, but TWO other tables who got there after us received their food first... We had to ask when our food would be coming. When it finally came, the waiter asked us if we wanted some naan, which I thought he may have been offering since the food took so long and he didn't mention any extra cost - nope, it cost an $4 that we saw on the bill later.

The staff was also very friendly and always willing to get us anything we needed. I will say that the food seemed to take a while to come out, and our chicken wings were cold (but still delicious!) so improvements in these areas would be welcomed.Food/Drink: First off, it's BYOB - can't go wrong there. We did have a Watermelon Juice (pretty good) and a tea (just fine) to start, in addition to our waters (which had lemon and basil in it! YES!). We started with Chicken Samosa (very good), Grilled Chicken Wings spicy (cold, but VERY good!) and Meera's Chicken Tikka Masala Kebab (yummy).

Update to previous review:1) Among all dishes I've tried, these are my favorite - a) Cornish Hen - essentially tandoori chickb) Lamb Roganjoshc) MAngo Saladd) Naan Pizza2) Least Favourite: Dal Tadka - they've started adding too much garlic to it. 3) The service has turned progressively bad because there is always confusion among the waiters as to who is serving which table. I was asked about my starters, drinks and main courses three different times by two waiters . 4) Suggestion to Owner: Please stick with your innovative style and refresh the menu. We have tried almost everything on it by now. Also, make the seating a little more comfortable - the chairs are very hard.Old Review: After having eaten at the various Indian restaurants in New York like Junoon, Tamarind, Bukhara and Dhaba etc etc. I can tell you with confidence that this place has better food than most and a great serving style. Their combos of Tandoori Naan, Kebabs and Daal are to die for. It's a limited menu but each item is prepared to perfection. The tandoori chicken and the Dal tadka are the best I've had in the Greater NY area- when I say best I mean authentic flavours and lots of Indian masala chutzpah. Casual and relaxed place playing awesome music with BYOB option. I was with friends from Paris who were finding it difficult to explain something at which point the extremely cute server started speaking with them in French. The only disappointing part for me was the fact that they shut down at 10 pm and last order is 9 30pm. Also there's no alcohol so be sure to carry your own poison.

We got the naanchos (nachos with naan instead of chips), the Huevos rancheros, and the blueberry pancakes. The naanchos were good, the Huevos rancheros were ok, and the blueberry pancakes were delicious. They were served with fresh fruit, whipped cream and mascarpone chocolate cream on top. I would definitely recommend them. I liked the water that they put down because it had mint and lime in it. It's a byob so we brought champagne but they don't sell orange juice so we had mimosas with pineapple juice. That was just as good. Overall it was a nice experience.

We used to love this place for its taste and service but regretfully both have gone down terribly. The ladies washroom doesn't get locked from inside and there was no signboard saying that!! Ordered Paneer Makhani which actually tasted as if taken from the readymade Paneer Makhani packet, the paneer was stale and hard. Then was forced to order something else so ordered Dal Tadka which was Dal without the Tadka! The place was crowded (which is so surprising, may be cause there is no other Indian place in Hoboken) and the staff was unable to manage. We had 3 different people taking our various ordered and they seemed so utterly confused. An American couple next to our table barged out after waiting to be served water and drinks for 20 mins!Overall pathetic food, horrible service and such shameful fact of not having a lock in the bathroom!!

I am teetering on upping this review to the bright lights of 5 stars but, I've decided to maintain 4 until I come back for dinner. *** (See star updated notes below). So, I heart Matt & Meera. I've experienced their food at a few Yelp events this year (yay) but, was able to hop over here for their brunch on Sunday. Well, let's start with the scene. From the doggie water bowl out front for pups, to the perfect detailed inside that is oh so warm and inviting, this place is a great casual spot for a meal. Don't expect a ""scene"" or a super hipster bar or greasy spoon joint. It's casual. BYOB makes it even more affordable. The service has always been perfect, friendly and on point.I'll keep this review to the brunch as their main menu is quite delicious but, I've yet to come in for a sit down (though I will!). Their brunch menu is reminiscent of a Mexican spot with huevos rancheros, tortas, steak & eggs, pancakes etc... Great. Love. Yet, there are some Indian influences. The coffees came out right away. Now, literally my man and I had a discussion and I suggested grabbing coffees on the way: ""Places like Matt & Meera won't have delicious, fresh, strong coffee."" I lost and we got coffee at M&M. It was fresh, strong and tasty. I was surprised. I was overjoyed. I love a great cup o' joe and this was a solid start.I went with the chicken tikka breakfast torta. The torta was perfect and at $8-$9 I think was fairly priced. The bread, the fresh jalapenos, beans, avocado. OMG thinking about it takes me back to each bite that I relished. However, I hated that I chose chicken tikka. It was just too much friggin' flavor. My tastebuds couldn't handle it and therefore the chicken aspect wasn't my favorite. They gave you the option of steak, and a few other choices, which I would highly suggest the steak unless you really want to go taste crazy. My man ordered the steak and eggs and at $12 this was a steal. The meat consisted of huge cuts of perfectly marinated and cooked hanger steak and the eggs were perfectly scrambled with a super fresh salsa and somewhat mushy breakfast potatoes on the side. Wow. Just wow. It was so great, casual and inexpensive.I really do love Matt & Meera. I look forward to my next dining experience!*** Just kidding, I upped it to five.

Taste very similar to the Indian papri chat. DEfinitely among the best offerings2. Paneer and Vegetable dosa - Very bland. Comes with 2 chutneys. The red chutney tastes just like ketchup. Avoidable. No curry (Sambhar).3. Masala Dosa - Pretty decent. Like usual dosa. No sambhar though4. Paneer and vegetable Kathi roll - Delicious. Similar filing as dosa but with some more herbs and spices5. Mint Yogurt Paneer Tikka - Super expensive. For 14$ you get dry paneer tikka with some rice and yogurt. Not impressive. Salad was good.6. Vegan Burger - Pretty average. Tasted/smelled like something non-vegetarian7. Crispy Masala Fries - Potato chips. Nothing extraordinary. Skip.8. Cassatta Icecream - Amazing. One of the best things on the menu. Do try.They split the bill on max of 3 cards. Overall a decent place to visit.,Cafe Matt & Meera,4.0 star rating,$$,"Indian,, Tapas/Small, Plates"

There was no wait and the place was pretty empty, but it had just opened a few months prior, so perhaps the word is not out on the street yet.  We split the potato and peas samosas for an appetizer and then the cornish hen and fennel lamb chops for an entree. Everything was delicious. The lamb was cooked perfectly and was tender as can be. The hen, served whole, had great flavor and was surprisingly not dry. That's pretty hard to do. Bravo, Matt & Meera.

Definitely not your traditional Indian menu but you can easily please that palate with plenty of things on there. We opted for the vegetable samosas and the potato masala dosa. My husbands samosa was actually a bit cold in the middle which was a bummer. Mine was fine and the chutney was delicious but almost like a salsa. The Dosa came out and was smaller than the type of dosa you would be used to if you were to go to some place in say, Jersey City. That being said, it was still delicious and packed with lots of potatoes and lentils and yum.

170,LK6ULrD9Vh-YMwUFb8WHPA,Andrea L.,5.0 star rating,"My boyfriend and I have been enjoying Matt & Meera's since they opened and it has become our favorite Hoboken restaurant for several reasons. First, the owner and wait staff are amazing - always friendly and accommodating - whether we come in just the 2 of us or with a larger group of friends or family. Second, the Food is wonderful!  We have our favorite dishes of course - grilled tofu salad, lentil dal, naan pizza, Fish tikka ( a delicious grilled Salmon), Murg Tikka, and mint paneer tikka. I love that they have many vegetarian options on the menu, all of which are delicious. While we love Indian food, my parents are not familiar with Indian cuisine but Matt and Meera's fushion cooking style really appealed to them and now when they come to visit us they always want to go to Matt and Meera or ask me to bring some dishes to them!  It is also wonderful that the restaurant is BYO so we can bring our favorite wine, champagne or beer with us, which we always do. In all, after living in Hoboken for over 7 years we feel so fortunate to have found Matt and Meera's as we know we are always going to have a great meal whenever we step through their door.

Very cute ambience and they are changing up their menu to include more classic Indian dishes but the problem is their attempt at fusion misses the mark completely. We had dosa which was burnt, not crispy enough, and the potatoes inside were bland. Also had the lasoori cauliflower which was mediocre at best. Finally finished off w the chicken Kati roll and side mango salad both of which were disappointing due to lack of flavor and average ingredients being used.

After about 5 mins when I realized that he isn't coming back to tell me whether he is bringing me food or not, I went up to speak to the manager only to request my food, the same server walked past me and laughed in my face and then when I told the manager ""do you see this? He's being so rude!"" The server walked up to me again and grunted in my face! Just to keep my calm I didn't address him directly (which now I think I should've) I told the manager, ""wow I only asked for my food, this is how your server is going to treat a customer??"" And all the manager said was ""I'm sorry I'll talk to him."" I felt so embarrassed my husband and I literally had to get up and leave.

As for food it was good except the seabass I ordered was not fresh. It made really fishy smell as soon as they put the plate on the table. It's just something I can just suck it at eat it. It was disgusting. So becareful order the seafood there. When I brought the dish back I felt they weren't too surprised about it which makes me think they are aware of it and still tried to serve the dish. Also I said don't make me new dish of you don't have fresh fish I will order chicken they agreed in a second. Thou they apologized didn't order anything for the inconvinience like a drink or a desert or something.

While most of the menu consists of typical brunch foods, there are about 3-4 items on the brunch menu that are a mix of Indian and Western flavors. We got all of those semi-Indian items because honestly, I can make a lot of the standard brunch fare at home -- I've never understood the appeal of going out for brunch/breakfast and getting pancakes. I tried all 3 varieties of the Indian tacos. The chicken and veggie were my favorite! We also tried the Guac Sev Puri and Quinoa Tikki Chaat -- the portions were a little small on those but the presentation was amazing and loved the flavor. Definitely not standard brunch fare!I brought my 2 and 4 year olds here and the wait staff was so nice to them. Very kid friendly.This is a great place to go if you want something different from your typical mediocre Hoboken cuisine. I hadn't tried Matt and Meera yet because I usually don't like ""fusion"" restaurants but I'm guessing they have to take the fusion angle because much of the Hoboken population doesn't seem to be too adventurous, food-wise.

I do wish there was a spicier sauce for the Dosa though, but the one red sauce was very pleasant. The waitstaff was attentive and the manager kept checking up on up and was very welcoming. My biggest complaint is that I wish they were open for lunch. I would really go there almost everyday because it's close to campus. I also was a little surprised to find that they served Indian food. I've been walking by the place for 2 years and really only heard of people eating burgers and hot wings there; hot wings were advertised for awhile.

It's seems like they are going for a rustic feel, but all the elements are off. My two friends and I were seated within 10 minutes, and our waiter was very attentive. When we sat down, we were given cups that couldn't hold more than 4 ounces of water at a time. When we ordered our food, the two appetizers came out at the same time. So far, everything was fine. When the main courses came out, one of our friends received their food over 20 minutes before the rest of us. By the time we ate, the food was room temperature. I ordered a sandwich, which came with maybe 10 fries and four ketchup packets. I felt like I was at McDonald's, but not getting the McDonald's price.

The other woman was lovely and I made a comment that I was sorry she was stuck with us. I almost made it clear to all three servers that I had heard what she said. While our server worked both the kitchen and took care of us, the other two sat around, complaining about how hot it was outside and flirting with each other. Unacceptable.

My husband & I went there for dinner last weekend. We had a LivingSocial voucher which required reservations. We didn't have any issues in redeeming the voucher; no surprises when we received the final bill.We had the crispy prawns for starters. It was delicious with the right amount of crispiness. The chutneys that came along with the dish were also good, especially the tomato chutney. For the main course- we had the Fennel Lamb Chops and the Tandoori Cornish Hen. The tandoori hen was so good. I usually skip full tandoori chicken for  kababs, but this one was just so delicious. The lamp chops were great as well. Both dishes were accompanied by rice, salad and raita(yoghurt dip). I missed having some sort of curry to have with the rice. That's one thing you need to keep in mind when you come to Matt & Meera; that it's not the traditional Indian food. You will get all the deliciousness of flavors of Indian cuisine without the overly spicy or heavy sauces. I felt the portions were a bit small, but I take that as an incentive to try more of their small plates/appetizers. For dessert, we had the Pistachio & Chocolate Crunch - which was ice cream with crunchy caramel coating. It was good, but we should have skipped it to try more of their delicious food.Service was ok which is why I am taking away one star. The food took a long time to come out, which was understandable since it was cooked in the tandoori style which takes time. But it would have been nice if someone came to our table and mentioned something about the delay. We had to catch the server's eye to get the menu again after our meal to order dessert.The decor's lovely, but I wish they would space the tables at a little bit more distance.

We returned a couple of items to add some spices and get back. They added it but still was not great. Second the service. Wasn't sure who the waiter on our table was. Everytime a different person would come to get our order or bring our order. I saw them bringing orders to other tables and they weren't sure which table it was for. Complete mis managed.

Each table has a flower dyed purple and a carafe of ice water with lemon. I actually love when places just give you a carafe or pitcher of ice water so you don't have to keep asking for refills. I drink A LOT of water so this is a plus for me. Someone would bring us a new carafe of water as needed.  For apps we had the Traditional Masala Dosa - $7 - A long crape like roll with potato and peas inside.We also split Potato and Pea Samosas - $5 - 2 baseball size pastries deep fried and filled with potato and peas.  Both were very good. For dinner I had Murg Tikka $12. It was great! I asked for a spicy dish and it was the perfect level of spiciness for me, which is pretty darn spicy.  My husband had the Fennel Lamb Chops $15 - He loved it.  3 lamb chops where the meat was almost falling off the bone.  The flavor was light but full.  Not too spicy but flavorful. Both came with rice and a delicious spring salad.I ordered dessert Pistachio & Chocolate Crunch - $6- because they didn't have any authentic Indian desserts. It seemed like a pre-made ice cream dessert-- something already frozen in its cup and ready to serve.  It was ice cream layered in a tall plastic cup but the ice cream was so frozen it was difficult to eat.  Not very flavorful- not good ice cream.

I know they were going to have a dinner menu, but didn't expect things to change as they have.As a vegetarian with vegan tendencies, there are maybe 2 options for me, and one of them is a burger.  I don't eat anything that's touched meat so I wouldn't think of ordering a vegan burger. Which means the only thing there is for me is a kati roll...and well, ok, naan and naanchos if I want to go there.  Cheese and yogurt, no thank you.I used to get a salad that was great with the most amazing dressing--sweet, sour and spicy--all at the same time.  All of the special sauces and dressings that my husband and I loved are no longer available--apparently it was too much labor and they had to make sauces all day long.We have a test for restaurants---my husband's stomach. And if he doesn't get sick, it means we're going back.  With Matt & Meera's original menu, my husband got the tikka kabobs which resulted in 14 visits (according to my check ins here on YELP).  Unfortunately, with the change of menu something else accompanied it as my husband got sick from the murg tikka.We bought a deal from Amazon which says we have to make a reservation; I've read quite a bit about YELPers' experience with the coupon.  If anyone wants to buy it from me, I'm happy to sell it.  If no one wants it, we're going to have to spend $40 on kati rolls, naan, ginger ale & Diet Coke.",Cafe Matt & Meera,4.0 star rating,$$,"Indian,, Tapas/Small, Plates"

Girls were working on a business plan at the table next to us, and another table was lazing the holiday away with a prolonged lunch. It was open, airy, and bright - I had a comfy seat along the banquette and there was a long high top with stools for seating in the the middle.My sister in law, Bald One, baby bump, and I were having a lazy holiday of our own, and we had already had a snack at Mamoun's, so we decided to share a few things and just have a few bites. Matt & Meera is the perfect place to do such a grazing - although we will have to return for a full-on meal at some point!We had: the butternut squash soup - full bodied (but not heavy) and laced with Indian spices; the samosas, complete with somewhat fusiony sauces; and the potato Kati roll- my first time having a Kati roll and I loved it!!!!  The Kati roll had potatoes, peas, onions, and spices inside and the most pliable, soft roti dough on the outside.

If I went back, this would be the only item I would order. 4) Crispy shrimp - Tasted like the frozen shrimp that you get in the store wrapped in an extra layer of vermicelli and deep fried to make it crispy. 5) Lamb Dosa - The dosa was quite good and so was the lamb. We used a half-off amazon coupon, if I paid full price, I wouldve been really disappointed! To top it off, when we asked for some of the food to go, they actually put the lamb dosa and the pizza in the same brown paper bag w/o any foil!

They initially told us the kitchen closed already (despite it saying they are open until 9, apparently the kitchen closes earlier especially on Sunday) but the manager was super nice and let us eat anyways and asked the cook to stay. He was really nice, did not make us feel rushed at all, and made the experience great despite us being the only people there. We ordered the lamb naan pizza (amazing, I loved the green chutney on it), paneer and mint naan pizza (also delicious), and the butter chicken naan pizza (good but the other 2 are better). We also ordered the murg tikka kebab which they recommended; I found it a tad bit spicy but my brother and his fiancee (who happens to be named Meera!) both found it amazing. When I came here previously, I had also tried the naanchos which are excellent as well as the mixed berry shake and mango lassi. The service was a little less prompt that time (it was mid afternoon and the restaurant was empty that time also). While the menu here isn't huge, everything I have tried has been very tasty and I look forward to coming back and trying more things including their brunch menu. The must order items in my opinion are the lamb naan pizza, naanchos, and if you can handle a bit of spice, the murg kebab.

We raved about this place so much and took some friends from NYC to sample their wonderful cuisine and were left embarrassed by the lack of service and lacklustre taste of the apps/ small plates. This was our fifth visit (twice for lunch & thrice for dinner) and by now the wait staff all looked pretty familiar (three in all). But somehow each one of them was having an off-day? I don't know. Two of them were serving us in rotation and it was taking them forever to get us silverware, extra green chutney and anything else we requested.  They paid absolutely zero attention...  and around 9.30 pm, one of them decided to take out the trash right in front of our eyes and walked right through the restaurant with the trash bag (without wearing any gloves or anything) and left it out on the kerb. Okay then! We get the message, even though the place was still packed. Quite honestly, I don't want to see anyone taking out the trash in a place I'm entertaining friends and trying to enjoy my meal. It can wait! Also they seemed in a huge rush to close the place down. When I was in the middle of my meal, one of the servers tried to take my plate away...there was three-fourths of my main course still on the plate! Our newbie guest looked on in amazement at what was going on and said - WTH?Now the food...we ordered  Lamb Samosas, Crispy Prawns, Meera's Tikka Masala Kebab & Butter Chicken & Red Chili Naan Pizza. The crispy prawn was good, but everything else was strictly okay, underseasoned and unappetizing. The samosas were distinctly stale - seemed reheated for our benefit. The Tikka Masala kebab, which in the past has been excellent, was underseasoned & had zero taste and seemed to be glazed with tomato ketchup.  Meh! The Naan Pizza (Butter Chicken & Red Chili) had pieces of some kind of chicken tikka  that didn't resemble butter chicken from miles and there was no red chilli. The crust was completely under-done and limp (it's supposed to be crisp). So disappointing. All this prompted us to to ask our server with dread, ""has the chef changed?"". He looked at us regretfully and said ""not really"" but didn't do anything to rectify the lacklustre pizza lookalike. Zilch. So zero marks for not even trying to appease your regular patrons here. From the main course the Saffron tikka kabab was the saviour - it was fresh & well done. All in all, came out feeling very underwhelmed and disappointed.

Fusion implies dishes that combine elements from different cuisines. This place is not exactly that. Sure, there are a couple of fusion-ish dishes, but for the most part it's like two different menus printed on the same page; one Indian and one non-Indian. Which I love!!!I live in the city but work a couple of blocks away from this place in Hoboken. Come here often for lunch or an early dinner. As an Indian with a diverse carnivorous palate but also the occasional nostalgic craving, Matt & Meera is perfect! Whether I am craving some divinely crisp masala dosas, perfectly cooked steak&eggs, kati rolls, or french toast, the same menu has it all. The decor is simple but tasteful, the service is attentive, and the food is superb!I have a special place in my heart for their Tandoori Cornish Hen.

Its Indian, its American, Actually it's just a nice mix of innovation with the use of spices and ingredients. The décor moderate yet uber rustic hip. I adore the slabs of reclaimed wood used here. Especially at the funky colored wired bar stools. Hari Nayek, probably the nicest chef/ owner I have ever met. The man just knows how to speak to people and treat them like people.  Hari and his staff   recognize me as soon as I walk in. I left my phone there during a Yelp event (long story).  They treat you like family. I order the same thing each time, they said, ""no you're not getting Kathi roll again are you?"" Switch it up! Today a Kati roll is any filling rolled up in an Indian roll is considered a Kati roll. I went with the staff suggestion. Tandoori Cornish Hen, marinated in yogurt and mild spices. $18.00 for the whole, or 12.00 for the half.  It was so tender and with the right amount of spices.  Did I mention its BYOB Matt & Meera has shaped to become my favorite restaurant in Hobo.

I asked her to please get some because we had none either. We ordered saag paneer--pretty straight forward, sautéed cauliflower, kale pakora, garlic naan. The saag paneer was gross and soupy, the cauliflower was battered and fried and tasted like General Tso's chicken, but in a bad way. It was not Indian at all.

The menu is very interesting and makes you want to try everything. However, after our second visit we figured that this interesting menu doesn't translate to great food. The blend of spices in the food is very disproportionate. For example, their appetizer dish ""nanchos"" were super tangy and sour, enough to dominate any other flavor. The underlying bread wasn't anything like a naan (as explained in the menu).  For main course we ordered the lamb dosa and lamb burger. Our excitement went away when these two dishes had no flavor, the meat was overdone and the dosa crepe was soggy. Maybe the food is more Americanized than I thought, but for someone with indian roots I wasn't impressed.Service: The reason I gave 3 stars instead of 2, is because of the great service. The staff is super nice and experienced. Food was delivered well under 10 minutes. I talked to the Manager for some time and he seemed very welcoming and receptive to our suggestions.

When I arrived at 6:30 I walked in and asked if I could sit anywhere outside they said sure and a waitress would be out to take my order. After waiting 15 minutes with no sign of a waitress I called and asked that they send one out as we were getting hungry and did not even have menus. I would have walked in, but there was a baby carriage blocking the way. This might seem silly, but the restaurant was virtually empty with maybe 1 couple inside and 2 tables waiting without  even menus outside. So we finally get menus and placed our order.  The waitress was sweet and picked up on the fact we were ordering all veggie dishes and pointed out that one of them had eggs in it and she would have them removed for us. Kudos to her for that. We ordered a whole bunch of stuff as we had $40 to spend and the dishes are all in the $5-$7 range. The first dish came out on its own the Vietnamese rolls and it was healthy and delicious with a kick as* wasabi sauce. Then came the veggie samoas, shrimp and noodles. The samoas were hands down the best I have had in Hoboken.  The noodles did not have a serving spoon and it was too much food for the 2 of us to eat quickly so we asked for a  lid and a spoon and were accommodated. I would expect the noodles to come with a serving spoon it seems a bit careless that it was missing and we needed to ask, but alas they were cooked to perfection a little spicy not too oily really great.We also had a potato kati roll and the spinach and mushroom naan pizza. Everything we had was delicious and served on cute plates with yummy sauces. I would have given this place 5 stars had the service been quicker when we sat and had the food come out less at a time. Lastly I tried the vanilla grapefruit tea it was yummy and served on a cute plate with lemons and sugar etc, but the water was too cold. It tasted good, but I prefer my tea much hotter.My friend and I both have plenty of leftovers for a meal tomorrow which we are excited to eat . Overall a nice night can't beat the delicious food, cute atmosphere, reasonable prices  and BYOB for a good night out. I will definitely be back and highly suggest you give it a try.

When they asked my name, they looked around at all the empty tables only to find they had IN FACT, not reserved one. They then decided the best solution was to forget about us, that perhaps we would go away and their mistake of forgetting to reserve our table would go unnoticed. We had to remind two other host/waiters that we were waiting for our reserved table, who then proceeded to look once again at all the name cards, as if my name would magically appear. Finally! There seemed to be a stirring, perhaps?,Just perhaps, we thought, 'we can finally sit down.' But no, in fact what they had decided was the best solution to accommodate us, was to kick out another couple who seemed to be on the verge of a possible anticipated Valentines Day engagement and the host went on to tell us that we would  soon be seated! I immediately decided this was a horrible solution, I demanded that they seat us by the window at once at an empty table reserved for Meagan, who would not show up until an hour later. 30 minutes after we walked in, we were seated, but still neglected for food orders and water...fast forward...in retrospect, we did not get our food at the same time, when it did come out, the orders were completely wrong, and we had to hunt down waiters, hostesses, cooks, really anyone we could find that had a pulse, to let them know we were still in fact: ALIVE AND HUNGRY BY THE WINDOW. When the food did appear, we found it quite agreeable, hence the two star review.",Cafe Matt & Meera,4.0 star rating,$$,"Indian,, Tapas/Small, Plates"

I'm not the biggest fan of ""fusion"". I think it waters down whatever cuisine it attempts to meld and makes for weak eating. And I guess M&M is following to my rule.  If there is one thing they kept in Indian food, it is the spice- POW!  But they attempt to meld Indian-esque flavors with american staples (nachos, wings, calamari). I guess an interesting idea, and every plate looked wonderful, but the flavors were disappointing.Spicy Chicken Tikka Naan roll was flavorless except for onions and hotness, Naan-chos were great- Get those! Wings were ok, nothing special. Calamari was ok, nothing special. Singapore noodles were ok, pretty flavorless too. I can see where the idea is there, but it was just missing something. And that something was made up for with looooots of spicy peppers.I suppose if I could taste almost anything else than spicy it would've been better, but all I tasted was spiiiiiiiiiiiiciness.

We also had the samosa trio but sadly only one out of three was good (potato), the other two (veggie and lamb) were a bit dried out and lacked flavor. However, we did really enjoy the mushroom and mint personal pizza. Again, due to being out too long the pizza felt a little chewy.

322,7J8sA92FfiMhnYqZPWsNCw,Am K.,2.0 star rating,"Went here over the weekend with family and came out disappointed by the average food and PATHETIC service. About the service:1. We went into the super empty restaurant with a sleeping baby in a car seat and requested that I put the car seat on the bench. I was told that I would have to put it (so the baby) on the floor as the table next to where they wanted us to sit was reserved. I told them that I didnt want to put my baby and the seat on the floor and would pick it up when the party at the next table came in. They took first 10 mins to understand this and kept pushing me me to put the car seat on the floor. 10 mins arguing with the customer when retaurant was EMPTY! 2. The moment we sat down the server told us that the credit card machine was broken and if we were still ok to stay. My mom asked me why they seemed so keen on driving us away.3. They forgot some items of our order and had to be reminded a lot of times to bring food out. The two servers who were present did seem to care at all about asking us how the food was or everything was going ok. One of the servers preferred sitting right in front of us and checking his smart phone for extended periods than checking how we were doing. We had to continuously try and get their attention to get water, more food, pretty much everything. Our experience was not a one off - There were 2 ladies eating a couple of tables next to us and one lady was given wrong food. When she pointed it out, it was taken away without much apologies and poor woman sat in front of her friend watching her eat her main course while she waited for hers for a long time.About the food: I am Indian so I know indian food. Following are my thoughts on what we ordered:1. lasooni gobhi: Too sweet and ketchupy. No lasoon (garlic) flavor atall. Blah!2. Aloo paratha: No spice, no flavor, no nothing. I make better aloo paratha at home. Complete waste of money. 3. Chicken tikka tacos: Unbelievably tasteless and dry. The chicken had no indian flavor that it claimed to have. Avoid!4. avocado shevpuri: it was one of the tiny bit better dishes. but nothing stellar. 5. Chicken Reshmi kebab: The flavor was good but my chicken was uncooked and pink 6. Tandoori Cornish hen: This was the dish which was v v good and hence the second star in my rating. The spice and the marinade was just perfect and the chicken was cooked perfectly and tender. All in all, given the less than average service and subpar food, I will not recommend this just for the cornish hen.

She has not really eaten Indian food before, and the last Indian place we went was not great, so she picked at the rice for a bit, then went all out into her chicken, which she and roommate 2 said was SO GOOD.I got the vegetable and paneer kati roll, which was excellent. My usual Kati Roll/Roti roll go to place is Roti Roll in NYC, but this was excellent! It was an average burrito sized roll, cut into two pieces stuff to the brim with well cooked paneer and vegetables plus various sauces that made my mouth water even before I ate it. Every single bite was delicious! I highly encourage everyone to get this.Matt & Meera is a great place to go to. As an Indian place, just by itself, I've eaten better, which is why for now, I'll give it four stars, however, next time I go, I will definitely be getting something more fusiony!",Cafe Matt & Meera,4.0 star rating,$$,"Indian,, Tapas/Small, Plates"

350,SgsvTJYy6-HkS5tx13ZBZQ,Cayley A.,2.0 star rating,"I have been to Matt & Meera twice. The first time: It was the first or second week of opening, and based on the pleasant Hoboken 411 review I decided to check it out with my fiance. I like Indian food and was very interested in experiencing Indian fusion. We decided to get takeout and ordered the spiced chicken Kati rolls, butter chicken Naan Pizza,  and an order of the Naan Chos (lamb). The Naan Chos and the Kati rolls were made quickly, but the Naan Pizza took so long to make that our Naan Chos and Kati rolls got soggy. We waited about 30 minutes for our order to be complete. The owners/managers of the new restaurant were sitting about 10 feet from where we were waiting and not one of them came up and apologized for the slow service or made an effort to ask if we lived in town, or make small talk. When we got home we sampled the food with some neighbors and while it was flavorful, the amount of time it took to make the food, and the lack of customer service made me feel that I had many other alternatives in Hoboken. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing. The second time: I went last weekend on Sunday for brunch with three other people. They had this 50% off promotion going on, and I was curious what the brunch menu was like, and also, realizing that the first time I went Matt & Meera had only been open for a short time I was willing to see if they had worked out their issues. When we walked in we were told we could sit out front and someone would come and take our order. We were given a pitcher of water that had mint and lemon in it, and it was quite refreshing. It then took another 20 minutes for someone to come and take our order. I almost got up to ask because I thought we had been forgotten outside. Looking at the menu, I found some of the descriptions didn't quite explain what we might get, but when you see crepe or sandwich you can at least picture what might show up after you order. I split one lamb South Indian Dorsa, and one lamb Torta. One person's meal came out 15 minutes before 2 other meals came out, and then my meal came out 5 minutes after the other two. Ultimately, my group got 2 sandwiches and 2 crepes. You would think the kitchen could manage making those all at once, but obviously, that was too much. The first person's meal would have been cold had they waited for the other meals to come, and everyone was halfway done with their's by the time I got mine. It was just poorly run. We had to ask what happened to the other orders. The lamb South Indian Dorsa was by far the best thing we ordered, but it was hard to keep it together. The flavor was there and I enjoyed the spicy tomato chutney. I then switched plates and tried the lamb Torta. I have to say the bread was some of the stalest bread I have ever eaten. When biting into the bread the contents of the sandwich spilled out the sides. There wasn't too much flavor besides the jalapeno and few pieces of lamb. Ultimately, for 50% the bill came to about  $4.00 a person which for what we got, and the service we had, I don't mind. I am a stickler for customer service, and the quality of the food is not worth the frustrating experiences I've had there. I tried not to judge the first time I went, but the second time, I just found the experience ever more lack-luster that I won't be back. There are SO many other places in Hoboken that are far tastier, better priced, and greet you with a smile every time; Mamoun's is a great example of that.",Cafe Matt & Meera,4.0 star rating,$$,"Indian,, Tapas/Small, Plates"

I went for dinner w/ the lady; made reservation using opentable [note: you cannot make a reservation for the same day after 7 pm using the website]. I was seated promptly - chose the outside seating area. The restaurant is on a busy street so you will constantly hear traffic but it really did not bother. This a BYOB place and they brought out an ice bucket for our wine. I started with the samosas (highly recommend). They were not greasy at all and very crisp. They come with a red and green chutney; red is more sweet than it should be. After that we ordered the masala potato kathi roll - delicious. Probably the best I've had in a while. Our final dish was the Mint Paneer Tikka. It looked great but was a bit bland for my taste. I would have liked it to be a bit more spicy. The service felt slow at the beginning but got better as our meal progressed.

Food quality and tastes always differ between having the food brought 'fresh' to the table and carrying it home in plastic containers.That all said... for two people, we ordered the Naan-chos to split and our own dosa (one chicken, one paneer/vegetable). The naan-chos were really average, and seemed like a confused dish. The naan chips were pretty good and crispy, but pretty much tasted like plain naan. The toppings were a cacophony of items - there were jalapenos, nacho cheese, assorted Indian sauces, sour cream perhaps? I understand that this restaurant tries to present itself as Indian fusion(-ish), but Mexican/Indian didn't work for this one. I wouldn't try it again.The dosa were only slightly better. I know, I know... getting dosa take-out sort of loses everything (but remember, my review understands this!). That said, regardless of the way it is ordered, I would expect the same amount of filling - there was barely any paneer/vegetable in mine, and the chicken eater reported back essentially the same. Again, not a whole lot of flavor to it, and is not enough food to count as an entree if you are average/above average levels of hungry.Takeaway - I would probably not do take-out from Matt & Meera again, but would definitely be willing to try them again as a sit-down. BYOB always is a plus (as they are), and they had some interesting pizzas that could be worth a shot.

If you go for brunch, definitely get the watermelon feta salad and the omelet. Best omelet i've ever had! For dinner or lunch we often get one of the Kati Rolls (its basically an indian version of a wrap) or a Dosa (crepe with some kind of filling), which are fabulous.

389,PugEGLZi4Al3FfV5OGj5wg,Monica S.,5.0 star rating,"We ended up at this place at around 8pm on a Saturday night because we skimmed over yelp and the word BYOB jumped out at us. We stopped reading right there and headed over, so we didn't know what to expect. The ambience was intimate and warm, and the décor was casual but trendy with exposed brick walls and a doggy water bowl out front. Most Indian places are either too greasy spoon or pretty stuffy, but this place was perfectly modern casual. We were kind of put off when we first got in because the host/server asked us if we had a reservation (we didn't) and then looked around the half empty room as if it would be a burden to seat us. He finally told us that he could squeeze us in. We had brought a HUGE bottle of wine to drink with dinner, so we were planning on being at the restaurant for a while. We ended up staying until closing and the restaurant never filled up, so we both thought the host's hesitance to seat us was very strange.Thankfully, after the initial weirdness from the host, everything was smooth sailing. Our server immediately brought over wine glasses once we plunked our giant bottle of wine down on the table, and there was no corkage fee! He also brought over a pitcher of water with fresh mint leaves and lemon slices in it, which was a really nice touch.The prices here are awesome! Since we were planning on being there for a long time, we decided that we would start with a bunch of small plates and then get entrees if needed. We ordered the:Potatoes and peas samosas- these were nothing special, just the kind of samosas you can buy at the store with the thick crust.  I prefer samosas with thin covering, so I was kind of disappointed. Also, instead of a tamarind chutney, these came with a tomato chutney which was not goodButter chicken naan pizza- I really liked this. We asked for them to put pickled onions on it, which provided a nice contrast. My boyfriend was not as impressed, but he was also looking for something to taste more like pizza. It might be better if these were renamed flatbreads to avoid confusionLamb kebab kati roll- this was really really really good. The lamb was nicely seasoned and really juicy, and it tasted really good with the green chutney that came with itMasala dosa- the dosa was soft and the potato filling was good.naan- nothing to say about this. Regular naan...Chocolate crunch- this was a vanilla and pistachio ice cream dessert with a crunchy chocolatey coating. I thought it was good, but my boyfriend loved it. He said it tasted like a cookie from an Italian bakery in ice cream formThe food was overall good Indian fusion and our service was great, but what makes this restaurant 5 star worthy is the price and the fact that it was BYOB. Our entire meal ended up costing only 35 dollars which was great considering we got six plates for the two of us.",Cafe Matt & Meera,4.0 star rating,$$,"Indian,, Tapas/Small, Plates"

There's been one go to place for Indian food in Hoboken for a while and when a friend suggested this Cafe, I was skeptical. Then, I read reviews online at Yelp, and got the nanchos, recommended by almost everyone on Yelp as a must have here, which were a delight. Sure, there could have been a bigger portion, but all the flavors worked so well together, you really didn't need to have more to feel satisfied. We actually shared one portion between three of us and we weren't full for our main courses, which was a good thing. We ordered the Basil Chicken Tikka, which was seasoned and cooked so well, we were all saying yum...yum,delicious!, after 2 minutes. Our waiter had suggested the Jumbo shrimp tikka and though only 5 jumbo shrimp came on the dish, we were surprisingly satisfied with the salad and dipping sauces that went with it and they were all so flavorful, that we were satisfied without being too full. I hate that too full feeling anyway. Next, we had chocolate cake, also delicious and for my friends birthday they put a candle on top. Perfect. The chef actually wrote a book about his cooking that was next to our table and i could actually try to recreate some of these flavorful dishes at home. Great!

The restaurant was empty but the decor was nice, and the staff- very friendly....The food, sadly, was abysmal. We were so optimistic, and got the chicken and it was RAW inside. They exchanged it for a lamb meatball appetizer that was lukewarm and tasted, frankly... disgusting... and the tepid marinara sauce they put over it was strangely acidic. I was also served a chicken tikka sandwich that was shredded and textured like canned tuna-fish....and tasted like what I imagine catfood would be like...ugh.We did let the hostess know out findings, and suggested that they take a hard look at replacing the cook. (Perhaps we got the B-team that day.)  I felt really nauseous soon afterwards, so I won't be going back again.

399,rwlOJ5xiTNRXxWND7zx4_g,Sean K.,5.0 star rating,"After reading about this place on Hoboken 411, my girlfriend and I finally went last night to check it out.  We walked down with a bottle of sauvignon blanc (it's BYO!), and sat inside since it was hot out (there is outdoor seating available).We walked up to the counter to order, and for our first time went with the naan chips with dipping sauces, the tandoori chicken wings with spicy sauce, the fried calamari, and the veggie spring rolls.  It was difficult to order just these 4 as I literally looked at everything on the menu and said ""I could eat that too!"".  Less than $24 and about 10-15 minutes later, our food was served.  We were brought wine glasses, an ice bucket for our wine, and silverware.  There is also a self serve lemon/mint water stand by the counter. Not only was everything we ate good, it was so good we were plotting our next visit back as we ate.  Everything was served as food we know and love, with a cool eastern fusion added.  The tandoori wings were unreal, and probably my favorite plate (I found out they had yogurt and mint).  The naan chips were crisp and delicious, and addictive!  They came served with an out of this world mint dipping sauce as well as a spicy chutney.  The spring rolls, which my girlfriend loved, were very fresh and had a good clear rice wrap around them.  The calamari was also very good, slightly well done, also with the spicy chutney.  The owner, a gentleman named Prashant, was very amiable and went from table to table introducing himself as well as asking for honest feedback.  I told him everything was fantastic, and he came back to us later with a complimentary tapioca rice cake with some different spices on it.  I normally hate tapioca, but somehow this just turned out right, much like everything else we had eaten before it.  I truly hope Matt and Meera makes it for the long run; it is a nice diverse touch to Hoboken.  As much as I love pizza and falafel, we could use a little variety, and M&M delivers!  Not to mention the owner is a great guy who is committed to keeping margins low (Nothing on menu is over $9), and wants to make his customers happy.  I cannot recommend this place enough, whether alone, with a date, or with a group of friends-Matt and Meera delivers on all facets, and I will be back many times over!",Cafe Matt & Meera,4.0 star rating,$$,"Indian,, Tapas/Small, Plates"

I have never been disappointed with anything I have chosen from the menu- but if I had to pick a few favorites, it would be the naan-chos (what a great idea!), the fennel lamb chops (softest and most delicious meat ever!), the quinoa burger, the butter chicken or the lamb and pickled onions pizza, the shrimp salad  and the kati rolls. They also run season specials and have a nice brunch menu. The decor is rustic and casual and the best thing is it is BYOB! No more paying $$$ for a $ glass of wine.

402,UJXYrR28E2wJDw6JvMbpYA,Davendra B.,5.0 star rating,"Went with my girlfriend last night and we were both pleasantly surprised with Matt & Meera.  The first thing you'd notice is the ambiance and decor.  It is tastefully decorated, employing a ""simpler-is-better"" approaching on their design theme.  Open seating, walk-up counter and a see-through window to the kitchen helps promote the airiness inside the restaurant.  And as expected, if you open a restaurant on Washington Street, you have to have outdoor seating, and Matt & Meera delivers.  Secondly, you'll notice the friendly wait staff who work here.  They were very accommodating and explained questions that either of us had.  If they didn't know the answer, they went to the back and got it for us.  Thirdly, and most importantly, the food.  Some of their dishes are listed as sharing portions, but they are a bit smaller than that.  Though they are also priced in the $5-7 range, so it isn't a shock at all.  3 dishes for two people should be enough, and the wait staff is more than happy to take additional orders if you need.  Also, for $1, you can get a mini tub of their dipping sauces, ranging in heat and complexity, so definitely consider this when ordering to compliment your meal.  We got the following dishes:- Chicken Tikka Pizza ($7): naan coal cooked bread with the tikka sauce, covered with white chicken breast and mozzarella cheese, and  topped slightly with red pepper flakes.  Was expecting a crispy base, but since it was made with naan it was pliable.  A lot of cheese and the sauce was tasty, though lacked the kick I was hoping for.-Spicy Chicken Kati Roll ($6): Is it sacrilegious to say that this kati roll is better than those off of Macdougal street?  Upon my first bite, I looked at my girlfriend and said ""Finally, a kati roll that I don't need to be drunk to enjoy!""  Not wrapped in a oil-soaked paratha like those from other stores, Matt & Meera's paratha is soft yet full of flavor.  Each kati roll comes with an egg between the paratha and the protein filling, which cuts some of the spices, but gives each bite a chewy and sponge-like feel.  The spicy white chicken breast was also bursting with spices and taste, while the fresh red onions provided a crunchy substance and additional flavor.  -Matt's Calamari ($6): Not your traditional battered bar calamari, each piece has a bread crumb/ panko coating style to it, and is then deep fried.  And instead of typical marinara sauce, you get a little tub of their tomato mustard chutney dipping sauce.  You actually taste the freshness of the calamari itself, and the sauce really brings out the flavor of the breadcrumbs.  If the prawns taste as good as their calamari, then I can understand why it is one of their best sellers.Lastly, they are BYOB and do not charge a corking fee, an essential for Hoboken restaurants without a liquor license.  They provide mini buckets with ice for beers, and can give you a bucket for white wine if you request for it.  There is a liquor store less than a block away on 7th and Washington, so definitely make a pit stop before hand.  As potential patrons to Matt & Meera, one thing you should keep in mind is that they are modifying American/ Italian classics by adding an Indian spin to it.  They are not offering traditional Indian food, but fusion dishes ranging in flavors and spices.  From their wings infused with Indian masalas and lamb burgers with visible fennel seeds, you can not only taste, but see, the hard work the chefs put into making their meals different from something you have experienced before.  If you are expecting a traditional pizza or burger, go to a traditional pizza or burger joint.  But if you and your pallet are open to new flavors and exotic spices, then Matt & Meera delivers one of the best dinner options to go to in Hoboken.",Cafe Matt & Meera,4.0 star rating,$$,"Indian,, Tapas/Small, Plates"

It was early in their business hours on a really hot weekday afternoon so my girlfriend and I were the only customers there. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The menu looks small, but tight and focused. I tasted their spring rolls with tofu, the naan-chos side and the side salad that comes with the sandwiches, the potato masala sandwich and the chicken tikka masala sandwich. All the flavors were lovely. All the ingredients appeared to be fresh and lively. For the spring rolls, the portion is a bit small for my taste and I didn't care for the tofu as the bulk of the filling.  I did really enjoy the dressing that went with the rolls.The sandwiches were a bit dense and heavy so I would recommend the side salad as the option to go along with one as opposed to the chips. The mint in the dressing was really refreshing, and I tend not to care for mint in most of the applications I've experienced, regarding the use of mint. I'm excited to try more of their stuff. In the portion/pricing game, it leans a teeny tiny bit towards the pricy but the quality and flavors tip the scale into wanting me to visit again.A side note for me, and perhaps an important note to many, the dining space is comfortable and welcoming.",Cafe Matt & Meera,4.0 star rating,$$,"Indian,, Tapas/Small, Plates"
