1,LcWOq7p7Mhtv9hIlDrhy9A,Mel T.,3.0 star rating,"I've definitely had better pizza elsewhere in Hoboken. We ordered the Marchetto pizza (pepperoni, meatballs, sausage, peppers, onions, mushrooms, olives & eggplant). It was kind of soggy but I think it was because there were too many ingredients on it. We also ordered the seafood pasta in some type of white wine sauce. They give a good amount of seafood, which includes clams, mussels, shrimp, and squid.I'd come back to try some appetizers, and perhaps a simpler pizza.Tip - avoid the corner table by the window if you can - it's right and uncomfortable to dine at. Also, it's BYOB.",Margherita’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian,, Seafood"

3,HJNS5cVIPdoptBc_j2_oxQ,Maria S.,3.0 star rating,Poor experience at Margherita's in Hoboken! I have been here before and enjoyed it but tonight was such a disappointment. The (most popular) Margherita pie was thick and heavy BUT the service was even worse. Sat down for dinner at 9pm and the entire meal was totally rushed! The staff continued to clear our table as we were still eating. They took our wine glasses away too as we were trying to enjoy a nice glass of wine over a conversation after dinner. Here's the icing on the cake- at 11pm they turned all of the lights on in the restaurant alluding that all of the customers should leave so they can finish up and go home. Very disappointing.,Margherita’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian,, Seafood"

Please note this is a BYOB and on the weekends it can be very busy! I love Margherita's because everything is homemade and has a very comfortable feel inside. If the weather permits, try to sit outside and enjoy a bottle of wine. I am always skeptical of sitting outside because the service generally is lacking, but at this establishment that is not true. They will continuously check up on you and make sure you are ok. The food quality is good and the portion sizes are large. I would highly recommend Margherita's looking for good food with a warm and friendly environment. I would rate Margherita's as follows: Food is 4 Stars, Price is 3.5 Stars, Service is 5 Stars and Atmosphere is 4 Stars.

10,xDYiNmKTDNL8RULdtvFoOQ,Ali W.,4.0 star rating,"My friend's and I were looking for some good Italian food in Hoboken, and after some searching on Yelp we all ended up here. We were a party of 10 and made a reservation, but we were about 7 minutes late because the parking in the area is terrible. They called me not once, but twice saying if we're not there they will give our table away, which was a bit rude. It's a business though and they're trying to make money, so I understand. I finally got here and they were packed, and for a good reason. We started out with some complimentary bruschetta. Everyone ordered their entrees, and we all ended up getting a pasta dish. Surprisingly no-one got pizza, but when I saw the servers with the pizza I thought it looked amazing. Gotta come back and give their pizza a try. As for the pasta dishes, I got the penne vodka with shrimp. My friends got shrimp Alfredo, chicken Alfredo, and penne vodka with chicken. the pasta was cooked perfectly. The vodka sauce itself was really delicious and flavorful. Shrimp was cooked perfectly and the portions were very generous. I finished every last bite cause it was so good. My friend who got the chicken Alfredo pasta ate before coming out with us, and he still finished every last bite. He's a small guy and doesn't eat much, but he really enjoyed that pasta. Overall, everyone enjoyed their entrees. We got a chocolate fudge cake for dessert with a candle on it for the birthday boy, and it was really good. Service was quick and friendly. My water-cup was consistently being filled. In addition to that the servers worked really well as a team. I was impressed by the good service because every single seat in the restaurant was filled. Only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I've had better pasta, even though this was amazing. It fell a bit short from another restaurant so I didn't want to rate both places 5 stars.

16,b0x4HrjoB6Mo47G5bJN0rw,Irina D.,4.0 star rating,"Every time a new restaurant opens in Hoboken, there is a very good chance that it is going to be serving Italian cuisine. Due to Hoboken's history, it is overloaded with Italian establishments, ranging from delis to somewhat fancy restaurants. While I do like Italian food quite a bit (and prior to discovering different cuisines it was my go-to), I have been reluctant to frequent too many of Hoboken's Italian restaurants. My boyfriend, on the other hand, is a big fan of Italian food and he's the one who brought me here several times.I have come here on a date with the bf, as well as with larger groups ranging from 4-10 people. What is consistently true is that if it's a weekend evening (not in the summer), there is going to be a wait. They have taken our number previously and called us when a table was available and we never had to wait for longer than half an hour. During off peak hours you might get a table right away.The service ranges depending on who you get but it is always at least decent, and the hostesses are nice. The restaurant itself is pretty causal, homey and somewhat inviting. It isn't very large but regardless of where I sat, I was pretty comfortable. The prices here are definitely reasonable considering the portions and quality.What I like about Italian restaurants is there are usually a good amount of meatless options, that is true of Margherita's as well. I most often order the Penne Arrabiatta (Fresh, homemade penne pasta, marinara sauce, hot cherry peppers, onions, basil, garlic & olive oil), which isn't actually spicy but I enjoy it nonetheless. I recently ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo which I have been eyeing for a while and found it to be even more delicious that my usual ""safe"" order. I have once ordered Mozzarella sticks due to an odd craving and they were just ok. The boyfriend usually sticks to their Penne Vodka (Fresh, homemade penne pasta in a light tomato cream sauce with capers, shallots & a hint of vodka, add chicken) or Chicken Parmiagana (Lightly breaded chicken breasts, topped with our fresh, homemade mozzarella, served with a side of linguine with marinara sauce) and he swears by both.While my not so secret wish is for Hoboken to diversify its food options a good amount, I would still like for Margherita's to stay because it is consistently good.",Margherita’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian,, Seafood"

18,6es_04FrajEYVhuFv4Xpgw,Kristina P.,3.0 star rating,"For god's sake, when will Yelp add the half star option? Margherita's deserves a 3.5. I've been wanting to come here for like 3 years, pretty much ever since I moved to Hoboken. Last night was THE night and I was pumped. I left feeling a bit underwhelmed. The restaurant itself is cute and quaint but small and cramped when it's busy. We were seated against the wall; I was in the wall bench and my boyfriend was in the chair. We had plenty of space to start but as the restaurant started to fill up it wasn't very comfortable. By the end of the meal, my puffy winter jacket was on my lap and the waitresses had bumped into my boyfriend several times because there wasn't any space for them to walk through the aisle. We ordered a mixed greens salad to start; I got the penne vodka with chicken and he got a personal buffalo chicken pizza. As far as buffalo chicken pizzas go, this one leaves a lot to be desired. You're better off with Napoli's. The penne vodka, however, was delicious and the portion size was - *Trump voice* - UUUUGE! I ate until I was stuffed and then still had enough for lunch the next day. Margherita's is one of the few Italian places in Hoboken that does homemade pasta and it did not disappoint. It was fresh, perfectly cooked and didn't get grossly soggy by the next day like others usually do. Conclusion: come here for the pasta, not the pizza, and come early if you'd like to actually relax",Margherita’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian,, Seafood"

I most often order the Penne Arrabiatta (Fresh, homemade penne pasta, marinara sauce, hot cherry peppers, onions, basil, garlic & olive oil), which isn't actually spicy but I enjoy it nonetheless. I recently ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo which I have been eyeing for a while and found it to be even more delicious that my usual ""safe"" order. I have once ordered Mozzarella sticks due to an odd craving and they were just ok. The boyfriend usually sticks to their Penne Vodka (Fresh, homemade penne pasta in a light tomato cream sauce with capers, shallots & a hint of vodka, add chicken) or Chicken Parmiagana (Lightly breaded chicken breasts, topped with our fresh, homemade mozzarella, served with a side of linguine with marinara sauce) and he swears by both.While my not so secret wish is for Hoboken to diversify its food options a good amount, I would still like for Margherita's to stay because it is consistently good.",Margherita’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian,, Seafood"

Although I did not eat any of the pastas with sauces, I did have the arugula salad with red peppers, mozzarella and salmon and I almost licked the plate.

I've been wanting to come here for like 3 years, pretty much ever since I moved to Hoboken. Last night was THE night and I was pumped. I left feeling a bit underwhelmed. The restaurant itself is cute and quaint but small and cramped when it's busy. We were seated against the wall; I was in the wall bench and my boyfriend was in the chair. We had plenty of space to start but as the restaurant started to fill up it wasn't very comfortable. By the end of the meal, my puffy winter jacket was on my lap and the waitresses had bumped into my boyfriend several times because there wasn't any space for them to walk through the aisle. We ordered a mixed greens salad to start; I got the penne vodka with chicken and he got a personal buffalo chicken pizza. As far as buffalo chicken pizzas go, this one leaves a lot to be desired. You're better off with Napoli's. The penne vodka, however, was delicious and the portion size was - *Trump voice* - UUUUGE! I ate until I was stuffed and then still had enough for lunch the next day. Margherita's is one of the few Italian places in Hoboken that does homemade pasta and it did not disappoint. It was fresh, perfectly cooked and didn't get grossly soggy by the next day like others usually do. Conclusion: come here for the pasta, not the pizza, and come early if you'd like to actually relax",Margherita’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian,, Seafood"

I'm a picky veal eater and asked the waiter if it was good and warned him I would send it back if it was tough. Well, he said it was fresh and good and he was right.

Get this!- gnocchi special: sausage, broccoli rabe, and homemade gnocchi in...a soup? of white wine and garlic. This dish confused me. I did not expect the dish to come out in a deep dish to hold the soup and was underwhelmed by the gnocchi. Sausage and broccoli rabe were better though.

I'm blown away, and as a frequent customer, I'm disappointed, but less of a wait for me.This is just one of those places that you have to go to once a month because it's THAT good. Why you ask?1) Everything here is homemade, from the pastas to the pizzas. 2) Free bruschetta for the table3) B.Y.O4) Cheap!5) Homey/Cozy feelIt gets crowded here, and they don't take reservations which is annoying, but they have fast service so table turnover is fairly quick. However, you definitely can just sit there and drink as many bottles of wine that you brought and they won't kick you out. The place is small, but they squeeze people in and it's tight. They can seat anywhere from 30-40 people inside is my guess and when the weather is nice they have outdoor seating. The specials change weekly, which is great, but some of the best dishes are on the permanent menu. The penne a la vodka is unreal, as is the seafood pasta dish (for those who like seafood). The chicken parm is also amazing. In my opinion, get a pasta dish here over pizza. You can taste the homemade goodness. If you order a chicken dish that comes with veggies or potatoes - swap for pasta, you're more than allowed.  I miss this place the most of all since I left Hoboken and whenever I come back to visit, I make it a point to come here. **Note: 2 credit cards max per table, so bring cash**",Margherita’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian,, Seafood"

86,mzGgk_y_3juq-aY08vmp6w,Bjorn P.,3.0 star rating,Came to Margherita on a Sunday night. Parking as always is a pain in this area - even with a Hoboken permit. Anyway - the restaurant is a good average size and BYO. The staff is friendly and there was a good mix of people inside - including some Stevens college kids. We ordered a small sausage and hot pepper pizza to share. It's pretty basic pizza - a thicker cheesier crust. The cheese was loaded on it and pretty tasty however I can't say there was anything that stood out about the pizza. The pastas looked good - and huge and we didn't have desert. Not sure I will be back but that's more out of convenience and location then the food. That said for two people we spent 20 dollars and got bruschetta (on the house) and hot bread for no extra cost.,Margherita’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian,, Seafood"

It was our go-to date night spot since the prices are reasonable, the food is great and BYOB is awesome! Since then, I've gone back with girlfriends a few times and almost every year for my birthday with my family (we cheated one year with O'Nieals when I started eating meat again.)The bruschetta is out of this world delicious AND complimentary (score!) My go-to order is Julia's pizza which is inanely delicious with fresh veggies and pesto (and available with whole wheat crust if you're pretending to be ""healthy,"" while still eating pizza.) I've also tried some of the pasta dishes and highly recommend anything with Vodka sauce. My dad has ordered (and I've tried) both the Chicken and Shrimp Francese (his fave) and that was awesome as well! The portions are generous and everything is super fresh.As others have mentioned, they don't take reservations and there is usually a wait. But there is a great dive bar next door and they're happy to take your number and call your cellphone when your table is available. The last time I was there (for my birthday last year) a table wound up opening up almost immediately despite expecting a 30+ minute wait and they were kind enough to hold the table while we finished the drinks we;d ordered at the bar.I'm surprised about many of the 1 and 2 star reviews. It seems like a lot of them are for delivery, but I've personally never had a problem. I've ordered pizzas (the large cheese pizza from here is so good and such a good deal at $14!) and pasta dishes on numerous occasions and they arrive freshly prepared, hot, fairly to largely portioned and always within an hour. I wouldn't recommend ordering the bruschetta for delivery, however, because it's just not as good as the complimentary stuff at the restaurant :).",Margherita’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian,, Seafood"

I guess what I never noticed was that no one was eating pizza...Being in the mood for pizza tonight my fiancee and I decided to try out Margaritas. It was quiet evening as was snowing so service was swift and on point from the moment we walked in. The appetizers of mussels fra diavlo and Ceaser dressing were really good and we were just getting started. The bruschetta for the table to start was also a welcome and tasty surprise. The pizza. Oh the pizza. So bad for so many reasons I had trouble explaining to my server why it was so bad. To start you would expect a place with Pizzeria in the name would make a half decent pie. Not the case. After the first bite I couldn't help but look around and  notice we were the only ones eating pizza in a pizzeria.   We had Margaritas Pizza, (not to be cofused with a margarita style pizza), which is fresh tomato, mozzarella and prosciutto with no sauce. The pizza was a dry flavorless piece of cardboard that made me wish for one of those pizzas I used to get for lunch in public school. Cheese...dry and burned to crisp. Prosciutto...maybe it was maybe it wasn't. It was so overcooked it was unrecognizable. I may bring myself to return to Margaritas Pizzeria one day bit it won't be for the pizza. I suggest some re-branding for this establishment. Don't make pizza if your hearts not in it.

I had been many times when I lived in Hoboken, but stopped coming once I moved. Anyway, a friend of mine suggested we check it out one Saturday night as we were all in the mood for some heavy Italian food on a freezing cold night. We arrived around 7:30pm and I was surprised to see there were actually tables available (the place is almost always packed). We were told a 30 minute wait so we gave our cell phone number and walked out. Upon walking out, they called us and said a table was ready. Awesome! Upon immediately sitting we were given tasty toasted bread with homemade bruschetta dusted with olive oil and freshly baked bread. I asked for a side of olive oil, which was excellent. They have a ton of nightly specials which all looked delicious, so we proceeded to order food like we were going to the electric chair. We started with the mozzarella salad (a staple on the menu). Three huge pieces of fresh mozzarella which were super creamy and out of this world on top of arugula salad with a thick balsamic dressing. Delicious. Then we ordered two appetizer specials: jalapeno poppers and clams stuffed with crab meat with some cheese on top. The jalapeno poppers were tasty, breaded and fried, very cheese and served with marinara sauce and the clams (I believe there were 5) had fresh crab meat in them and were excellent. For dinner I went with the lobster ravioli, which came in a creamy pesto sauce. Interesting pairing for the lobster ravioli, I liked it. The ravioli was very tasty, huge pieces of lobster, yum. Overall service was very good. Our food came out fairly quickly and the place is so small that you never have an issue locating your server if you need anything. Because the place is so crowded, it tends to be a bit loud, but overall I like this place, very relaxed atmosphere and the food is always delicious!",Margherita’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian,, Seafood"

The last time we were there we brought wine the same gentleman from above said ""let me take that, you worry about enjoying your meal and I'll worry about this."" That one statement and taking our wine I think was spectacular and a rarity in a lot of joints.The food is pretty darn good. The bruschetta they give you complimentary to start is excellent and plentiful and the bread is also warm and delicious. The pasta, sauces, meats are all excellent. I had the chicken rollatini special and it was fantastic! My wife got fettuccine Alfredo which was also pretty good, not the best but pretty good.I love old school, local Italian joints it reminds me of my grandmother and I love me some nostalgia while I eat...minus getting whacked with a spoon.

Just a typical pizza you can get at any pizzeria. The mozzarella sticks were the prefrozen kind you make at home. Ive never had worst mozzarella sticks. Thats how you can tell this place isnt really italian. The salad was gross. They charged me an extra $1 to get olives on my salad. Which i wouldnt mind if they were kalamata olives. They gave me the HUGE black olives that come out of a can. ANother indicator that this is not a real italian restaurant.The dressing on the salad was horrible. The worst balsamic vinigrette ive ever had in my life. My salad also had slivers of zuccini in it. Who the fuck puts zuccini in a salad. Our waiter Samuel was amazing.

The service is fast and polite, but also kind of smothering, especially the busboys trying to clear something as soon as you put your fork down.Maybe I've caught them on off nights or with the B team, but consider this tough love!

I've been here for their pizza and pasta, and both specialties are awesome. My latest visit to this fine establishment was yesterday afternoon (11/02) to celebrate my move to Hoboken. I was with my boyfriend and my sister, and we were all starving and worn out from the stress of packing, unpacking, etc. We ordered fried calamari and Spinedi (sic?) for appetizers, which were delicious. The Spinedi was fried mozzarella with capers, served with their homemade tomato sauce. NOM NOM. For our main entrees, I had rigatoni with meat sauce, my boyfriend had meatball parmigiana, and my sister had pasta with sautéed broccoli. I almost finished my dish, but I wanted to save room for dessert. The pasta was al dente, and the bits of meat were tender and added a nice texture to the sauce. My boyfriend's meatballs were also flavorful and complemented nicely by the cheese in his dish. For dessert we ordered the chocolate mousse cake. I loved it, but my boyfriend thought the cake-to-mousse ratio was heavily in favor of cake. Pshaw. More dessert for me! We ended up taking the calamari, Spinedi, and the meatball parmigiana home. I just reheated it and finished the leftovers now--still delicious. You've earned yourself a loyal paying customer, Margherita's.",Margherita’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian,, Seafood"
137,9rtB8m2H_R4vWhphJJU3LA,Pete B.,1.0 star rating,"When I first moved into Hoboken, I heard this place had great Italian food. As such I figured I would give it a shot. I ordered a chicken parm meal for delivery one night. Can't go wrong with that right? Delivery time was right on point and when it arrived, I was extremely optimistic. Unfortunately, I could not have been more disappointed. The entire dish had literally congealed. To provide a better description, when I first stuck my fork into the side of pasta, the fork literally got stuck. When I attempted to remove it, the entire helping of pasta came out with it along with 1 of the two chicken cutlets that were in the container. I was so confused. At first, I thought maybe the meal was frozen; however, it was hot. After trying to pick through it for a few minutes, I chalked it up to a loss and threw it out. Fast forward three years later, I knew I had to give this place another shot. Every time I walk by the place is always bustling and it always smells good. They even grow their own herbs right outside on 8th street during the summer. Despite my best intentions, I was disappointed yet again. The entire meal was congealed. I couldn't figure it out. The pasta had literally hardened into a giant dough ball and the chicken was stuck to it. Even when I tried to microwave the meal, it was no use. Like I said, I have to think that this place has good food. The place is always crowded whenever I walk by, which is why it is somewhat conflicting for me to leave such a scathing review. My only conclusion is that their to-go food is pre packed and frozen or there is another Margheritas in town that I am accidentally ordering from.

140,J4olV7tGz2e2iHxGAZTm6Q,Sara S.,5.0 star rating,"One of my favorite Hoboken BYOB locals. It's been consistently good over the years. I generally order the chicken parm and end up taking at least half home for one or two more meals. The chicken cutlet is always tasty and that Vito's mutz can't be best. Speaking of mutz, the spedini is quite a treat as an appetizer. The cavatelli and broccoli is also very good, but doesn't deliver that well and arrives a bit watery for me. In the restaurant it is much better. I'm not a fan of the pesto because it is cream based, but I guess people like it. My husband always orders the penne with vodka sauce and chicken.  I don't love that it contains capers, but I think you can ask them to leave them out. If I have to say anything bad - it would be that the delivery can take quite a long time and the bread that comes with is not very good. If you go in the winter, the place is so small that you can end up sitting near (or almost in front of) the door and when it people are going in and out, you get blasted with cold air. They should get a heavy curtain or fix that somehow. I've had dinner with my coat on once or twice, but I keep going back because I really do like the food.

They often run great specials so be sure to ask. The fried calamari can be really good too, but sometimes they undercook it so be sure to ask for it crispy. Pizza is just ok at best...you definitely can do much better in Hoboken. As I said this is great Italian food! Great interesting dishes with lots of flavor. The only issue I ever have with Margs is consistency. If they're real busy then they can get sloppy you can occasionally get a bad meal ...ie something under or over cooked.

I am not sure why. Maybe when I was younger the prices (which now seem extremely reasonable and worth it) were too very much for my little allowance, or it felt too much like a couples retreat or family dining. But now, I am obsessed.My boyfriend and I go all the time, especially when we are in a foodie pickle. Hoboken has a lot of great restaurants, don't get me wrong, and it is deffo fun to try out new places and see new things. But sometimes, you just want what you know. And we know Margheritas. The food is pretty much always consistent, though sometimes portion sizes differ slightly, and sauces can be mildly different or thinner. But all in all, you are headed for a good Italian meal when walking into the door of the restaurant.Currently I am stuck on the lobster ravioli drowned in a creamy pesto sauce. I am deffo a sucker for pesto, especially creamy pesto (which is hard to find). And these large stuffed pastas, drenched in the perfect combination of salt, basil and cream and oil, really hits the spot. There are only maybe five or six ravioli, but I get full every single time. The pasta tastes so fresh and feels handmade, with just the right amount of lobster and cheese to create the perfect ratio. The pesto is also delicious, smooth and subtle, though sometimes there is a bit too much sauce. My boyfriend seems to be permanently stuck on the chicken parm, which is the biggest portion I really see throughout the various Italian restaurants in the area. The plate is huge, heaping with perhaps slightly overcooked spaghetti, and large pieces of breaded chicken breasts, smothered in mozzarella cheese. He actually gets full. It is not the dainty amounts that you sometimes see and pay more for.The desserts are also always a plus. Please please please try the crème brulee cheesecake if it is on the dessert chalkboard when you are there. There is something about it that screams both cheesecake and crème brulee. Maybe it is the bruleed sugar on top of the cheesecake that is toasted to a perfect brown, but sometimes I think it is actually the cheesecake that is different than others, less tart and cutting. The staff is generally friendly, buzzing around and taking orders, bringing out bread or bruschetta, and the manager always seems to be around. Sometimes there is a wait, depending on the time or day, but the place never seems empty, which I think is a good sign. The prices are so right and my belly is always full when I leave.

I started coming here in 2005, with a friend who lives in NJ. Seven years later, we still meet here to confab, gossip, and drink a whole lot of (BYOB) wine.I always order the same thing. It's become such a running joke between my friend and I--we always think that we'll try something new, but I always get rigatoni pesto with sundried tomatoes, and she always gets something with shrimp. We always split garlic bread with mozzerella. And everything on the menu looks awesome, but it's like, why eff with tradition? But my dish is good, there's always enough to bring home leftovers, which I never do, because I invariably end up leaving my bag of leftovers on a random bar stool. Sorry. We also always bring Little Penguin wine, which we always purchase at the Sparrow wine store. And then, we walk up Washington to put our names in, and more often than not, head over to the 8th Street Tavern (cash only) for a beer. I feel like I'm giving some sort of operating manual instructions, but honestly, this is like, my ideal girl's night out in Hoboken.Stuff to know:--Sometimes there's a wait, but the electronic buzzer has a range that'll bring you to the 8th street tavern. Head there, have a drink, keep in mind it's cash only.--Complimentary bruschetta=really effin' good--Tables are close together so make sure you check around you before you start bitching about a coworker--it's happened a few times that I've run into people I know there.--After, you can stumble down Washington for more drinks. It's our little tradition to go to Mikie Squared after (why? the name doesn't make sense, the drinks are average at best, and it's nothing special, but it's just what we do) then mosey back to the PATH station.",Margherita’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian,, Seafood"

We wanted to check this place out specifically because it's a BYOB and were very happy there.

Had the mussels with a marinara based sauce, the spedini, and mozzarella sticks for appetizers, then got some pastas and pizzas for the main courses. Service was great especially considering how large/obnoxiously loud of a group we were. Only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the prosciutto pizza really didn't have enough prosciutto at all (only a few small pieces) but otherwise this place was a home run.

Washington Street is a surprising mecca for Italian Food! I reference of course the scandal created with Grimaldi's and the one place on Earth I know I can find a satisfying vodka sauce. Walk by, get your name on the list, and you'll have time to go buy a bottle of something before you're seated.Margherita's is a charming place with comfortable seating and literally the Best Penne Vodka in the known universe (the use of capers paired with a heavy creme - hard to pin down, impossible to replicate). Absolutely great for lunch with a group (check for specials), or for a dinner date. Salads are fresh and filling. Pizza is crisp and has flavorful ingredients (nothing is passed over). M's is worth the walk up Washington, to be certain.Not to harp on this penne vodka thing, but you gotta try it. Whenever my fiance and I order penne vodka anywhere else, we both take a bite, look at each other, and acknowledge that Margherita's is better. If this place is full up and won't seat you sooner than an hour from now, the closest substitute is actually at Maxwell's on 11th, believe it or not. We used to offer to babysit our nephew just to have an excuse to come uptown. BYOB (wine shop about a block North is perfect) and also BYO huge carbo-loading appetite of Italian descent!

BYO, uncorked for you if you bring wine. There's fresh bruschetta to snack on initially, then bread, and the fresh, homemade pastas and pizza.  Willing to substitute various meats for the missing sausage (see below). Service isn't bad, a small place, two waitstaff cover the room, basically. Nice chilled shrimp (8) on the shrimp cocktail (with an interesting orange version of cocktail sauce).The bad - it's crowded, and a tight, no-holds barred dive to the back of the room to get to the serving station where you can put your name down (they need a host station up front!) makes for poor logistics when it comes to walking around. Forget about large groups bigger than 6... you'll be hard-pressed to find space here for that. The bruschetta was watery, as was the fettuccine alfredo (in a soup, almost, of watery creamy sauce). No ice for the white wine we brought... hm.Neutral... lobster ravioli with pesto wasn't bad, and they were out of sausage (otherwise would've gotten then gnocchi special with sausage).Overall, not a bad place to grab a quick meal, although I have other favorite Italian places in the area.",Margherita’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian,, Seafood"

They didn't have any brunchy egg dishes on the menu, so we all got pasta and pizza. My pepperoni pizza was pretty good, but the tomato sauce was a little too chunky for my liking. I appreciated that it had small fresh tomatoes in it, but that's not my jam. The real standout dish was my mom's linguine with clams. She assured me it was fresh pasta, and it was served in a creamy sauce. This dish was garlicky and so flavorful. Definitely the stand out on the table. It was pretty empty for 1pm on a Sunday, so they had one waiter for the whole place. That made the service a little bit spotty, but not horrible. Would I go back?

They told us we had to leave at the end of our meal because they had other people waiting. With Pleasure lady!The food was mediocre at best. I had a pasta special and it was greasy and swimming in butter. The vodka rigatoni tasted like it was marinara sauce tossed with a little cheese.

Really the only thing i can complain about (and its kind of a big deal) is how the waitstaff forces everyone to eat at lightning speed.

Correct me if I'm wrong but don't Italians like a nice leisurely meal? Just saying... I am an ex-service industry person so I would never in my life be rude to waitstaff.

If you are interested in this dish it is not served in a  red sauce, but rather a creamy herb-like sauce.  I didn't want to give up on this place because of the great reviews and the location, so I went back again and ordered a chicken Caesar salad. While the grilled chicken was juicy, it was thrown on top of a bed of lettuce, which lacked everything that makes up a Caesar..no parmesan cheese or quality dressing. The salad dressing tasted like a cross between Ranch and Caesar store dressing. Disappointed to have paid what I did for it. The service was extremely slow, and the owner (I think) checked to see if everything was ok. I didn't complain. The credit card machine was not working when it was time to pay. Having no cash, I walked to the nearest ATM and paid a $2.00 fee. When I got back to the table, I thought they would at least take off my soda or something...nothing.  I understand some things are out of our control, but paying extra was not fair to me, the customer.Maybe this place should just stick to their pizza, which apparently they seem to be known for.

Gross.  My step-son ordered pizza that can only be described as jaw-droppingly bad considering the competition in Hoboken from other pizza options; It truly resembled a pre-assembled frozen pizza in taste and crust quality.  The best dish was the pedestrian pasta special I ordered.  Honestly, we were shocked at the quality of the food.Maybe we had an off night, and we'll probably give it another try based on reputation, but two stars is all I can give it for now, and that may be generous.  I know the other Yelpers reviewing this place must know good Italian food since we're all familiar with the Hoboken area and all of the great options, so I am scratching my head over this.",Margherita’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian,, Seafood"
