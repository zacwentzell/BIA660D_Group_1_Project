You can taste the time that was put into cooking the cured beef. It's salty and deeply savory but perfect in conjunction with the Cuban sweet potato and rice. It was one of the best meals I've had. This meal was featured when Guy Fieri came to the restaurant too. The restaurant is a BYOB too, which is nice.My sister ordered the pollo al Ajillo con Espinaca. It was a pretty large portion, but the garlic sauce was delicious mixed with the rice and beans. Definitely order the plantains as a side order- they were delicious!Overall, this is a wonderfully authentic Cuban restaurant in the heart of Hoboken.

I've been meaning to go for awhile, and finally got the chance to a few weeks ago for lunch. The place is not fancy or anything, but a good lunch spot or quick dinner. My boyfriend and I split the CHURRASCO CON CHIMICHURRI (Marinated grilled skirt steak topped with chopped raw onion, served with an Argentinean style steak sauce) and the EL CUBANO sandwich. The sandwich was pretty small, but put together really well. The steak was so delicious, and the sauce was to die for. I really liked the onions that came with the dish. I usually don't like beans period, but I ate all of the beans that came as a side dish. You get two sides with an entree -- I got the beans and the rice. The rice was also spot-on. Rice + the sauce that came with the steak = magical. They have daily specials which all looks pretty great -- will have to check the place again soon!",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

This is a short walk from the path / ferry and can easily be missed on washington street with all the other restaurants but this is the one you want to go to and there is some out door seating.When you walk in here it gives off that old school dinner vibe with a long bar almost the entire length of the restaurant and a few four person tables. We sat at the bar and when going over the menu everything looked amazing. The waitress was really friendly and helped us figure out what we would like best. With this being a Cuban restaurant I obviously had to go with the Cubano sandwhich which is Pulled pork, ham, swiss cheese, pickle with garlic mojo and every bite was more delicious than the next. The pulled pork and ham was juicy and full of flavor and that sanwhich was pressed to perfection. We also got the Pollo al Ajillo con Espinaca - Boneless chicken breast in garlic sauce served with sautéed spinach this was a ton of food and the that garlic sauce on the chicken gave it such a delicious flavor.

11,2glsi4d0P3jwZUozZCPz5A,Penelope H.,4.0 star rating,"I've been coming to the downtown La Isla location for the past two years. As an individual who recently turned pescetarian, I have to admit that the one thing beckoning me back to life of a carnivore (aside from lamb, c'mon, I'm half Greek) is the thought of an El Cubano at La Isla. The warm layers of pork, ham, and melted swiss cheese with pickles and garlic mojo on crispy, pressed bread is the kind of stuff that haunts your dreams. As my fellow yelpers have mentioned, the serving size is generous, and half a slice with a side of yuca frita or tostones/platanos maduros is enough to leave you satisfied. One of the reasons I love the downtown location as opposed to uptown is the ambiance. The borderline cramped, yet intimate quarters, bar seating throughout, low lighting, and demeanor of the waitstaff really brings me back to all of the summers I spent in Costa Rica with my relatives for months on end. It feels like home. And yes, home was loud. While dining at La Isla, you'll find loud music, waiters and waitresses yelling orders across the restaurant in their characteristic ""¡No!"" shirts, and strong Cuban coffee that will have you yelling in joy too. La Isla really is a gem; you'll find authentic Cuban cuisine reminiscent of home cooked meals, as well as interesting, creative dishes. Breakfast is served Monday 7am-11am, and Saturday 7am-12pm. Sunday Brunch is from 10am to 3:45pm. One of my favorites is La Isla Huevos Rancheros: the spicy tomato sauce packs a punch and the fried tortilla shell is always crispy. With a side of black beans and rice, this meal will leave you stuffed. Both the white rice and arroz con gandules (yellow rice with pigeon peas) are delicious and I recommend that you sample both. And of course, you have to try Omar's Stuffed French Toast. Don't know what it is? The menu describes it as ""egg bread filled with strawberry/guava cream cheese, dipped in cinnamon batter and coated with corn flakes and almonds"". It's not too sweet, is pleasantly crispy, and is definitely satisfying. They also have daily specials throughout the week served with a choice of two sides (rice, beans, yuca, maduro). I recommend the lechon asado, aka roasted pork. It's served on monday, wednesday, saturday and sunday (5pm-9pm). While this dish is sometimes hit or miss, when it's drenched in sauce, you know you're in for a treat. Once or twice I've come and it was a little too dry for my liking, but that was because I came close to closing. Just be careful because they sometimes run out of their specials around half way through dinner time. I also recommend the camarones enchilado, cazuelita de camarones y chorizo al ajillo, churrasco con chimichurri, and seared salmon. When ordering delivery, don't get bistek de palomilla or bistek empanizado because the meat is very tough and dry, though I've yet to try either of these dishes at their restaurant. As for shakes, the batidos and morir sonando don't live up to my expectations. In Costa Rica, my abuela makes batidos with lots of fresh fruit, milk, ice, and condensed milk, lending itself to a much more natural, smooth, creamy, and refreshing drink. My favorite is a papaya batido. However, at la isla, you'll find the fruit is frozen in the frige behind the counter, and you're drink is predominantly granulated sugar; as such, you lose the natural flavor of the fruit and are overwhelmed with pure sugar. All in all, definitely give the downtown La Isla location a try. Rather than risking it with a batido, remember it BYO and that they have AMAZING coffee.",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

We ordered in last time, so for those who are considering delivery, rest assured, they do a good job at packaging and come within the time frame stated. I'll first start out by saying we ordered far too much food - that's what happens when Shonnie misses one of her 8 full-course meals of the day. We started out with the La Isla Salad - fresh avocado and veggies: perfect start to a wonderfully filling dinner. For entrees, we ordered: * Pollo al Ajillo con Espinaca - the chicken was a bit on the dry side, despite swimming in the garlic sauce. The sautéed spinach was likewise drowning in the sauce, but I thoroughly enjoyed the buttery garlicky sauce - I added some rice into the mix, which did the trick of evening out the watery plate. * Bistek de Pollo - this was less impressive in flavoring. The caramelized onions resting on a bed of chicken breast was a nice touch, but the chicken was a bit tough on this plate, too. The plantains and side veggies were well seasoned and cooked. Both the white and yellow rice were tasty, but the yellow rice was heavily salty, so I'll stay away from that one next time. Overall, however, I was thoroughly satisfied with the meal. Not having The Cuban be the only Cuban dinner option in the area is awesome.",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

We're Puerto Rican and know what flavor is about and we love Cuban food. I decided to order the black bean paste that comes with plantain chips. The bean paste was very flavorful but should have been served warm instead of being served out of the refrigerator. The flavor was there, but the cold paste was not something would prefer. If I could give a suggestion, I would use little biscuits instead of the plantain chips, but overall pretty good. For dinner, I ordered the churrasco. It was Juicy and the chimmy sauce was on point. Steak was lightly charred on the top and cooked to perfection within. My cut of steak was on the thick side, but my husband's was just right. The yuca fries were by far the best I have ever had, here in the U.S. and in PR. Seriously, I would highly recommend it. The black beans were amazing that came with the rice. My husband is allergic to beans, but he said it was well worth the pain he was going to feel later. We didn't try the coffee due to the fact that we were stuffed, but about 20 people came in just for their coffee before they headed home from work. The only sort of negative thing was this one woman behind the counter. She was rude to other workers and some people that came in. She said some snippy things in Spanish and another female behind the counter made sure she took all the customers to keep her away. She even convinced a new local person to become a regular to drink their coffee. They need to get rid of that cancer in he restaurant before it does damage.The great:  Black beans, yuca fries, black bean paste (if it was warm).The good: churrasco The not so great: priceThe bad: the slightly large rude lady behind the counter",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

I even had to yell (because my normal volume wasn't enough apparently) across the bar to grab someone's attention one time I was there after waiting for five minutes at the front. I'm honestly not even sure if they have a separate host/hostess position.When dining in, it was difficult to grab the attention of our waiter and we were knocked into a few times.The two stars are for the pollo asado.

My second and most recent visit, I thoroughly enjoyed La Papa as my breakfast. It was amazing. You can't come here expecting quite a healthy meal but you WILL be satisfied! The meat in this dish is so juicy and eggs were cooked just right. I think the star of this dish was the sauce. I can't recall what it's called but it's some type of salsa, it is bonkers!! Also they serve a side of complimentary bread with your breakfasts - it's a bit crunchy and super soft inside and they add just a touch of butter. So. Good. Note to newcomers - regular coffee will always come with milk unless you specially request black! They're cubancino is slightly sweetened regular coffee with cinnamon - also very good!

We prefer the Downtown location to the uptown one because somehow the food is better, even though the ambiance at the uptown location is much nicer. The downtown location is fashioned after an old dinner and can be a little cramped at times. We personally like it as it gives out a homier feel. We usually order the Ropa Vieja with rice, beans and plantains, or the bistec de palomilla over onions. The tostones are incredible but be sure to ask them with garlic and butter on the side as it can be a little greasy if you don't.

Minutes after we were seated and settled, there wasn't an open table in the house (save for a few counter spots). We perused the menu, ordered some velvety smooth coffee, asked for some suggestions, and we were on our way to brunchful bliss.La Isla Egg Sandwich - bacon, tomato, avocado, and red onion on multigrain toast. It was a simple sandwich but it packed a ton of flavor. Avocado makes everything a bit more sexy, no? Chorizo Omelet - complete with several different blends of cheese and some of the tastiest homefries this homegirl has ever had. Omar's Stuffed French Toast - Omar, I don't know you but you must be a flippin' genius for creating this masterpiece. Made with egg bread, stuffed with guava cream cheese, dipped in a cinnamon batter, and coated in corn flakes and almonds. This thing was crunchtastic. We took the second piece home and we polished it off the minute we walked in the door. What would it take to get my workplace cafeteria to make this dish on the regular?Cozy, unpretentious, and delish. Now I see why La Isla is a Yelp favorite.

It is not our regular salsa with tomatoes. They have a daily special menu which is great. The price is a little cheaper but taste great.

We started with three appetizers: Empanada de Pollo (a crescent pastry filled with a lot of chicken), Papa Rellena (Fried potato stuffed with ground beef), and Croqueta de Jamon (Croquet filled with a homemade ham filling). I was most impressed with the Papa Rellena. My entrée was Salmon Negro (Charred Salmon served on a bed of watercress with fried plantains topped with avocado purée). The avocado purée was one of the best guacamole that I've tried and the fish was cooked to perfection. I really liked how there was very little seasoning to the fish itself.

The name sounded vaguely like a place that would serve such a dish, so we decided to try our luck. We got here ~5 minutes before they opened on a Sunday, and were the second group in line. Within 10 minutes of being seated, the entire restaurant had filled up - tables and bar. The space is small, so either come early (like we had the luck to do) or be prepared to wait. We had no idea that this restaurant had been featured on TV, but the many posters on the wall and shout outs on the menu tipped us off soon enough. The food was good, but not mind-blowing. Papa rellena is exactly as good as you'd expect a ball of deep fried mash potato stuffed with ground beef to be (that is, very good). Chicken soup was serviceable, but I think my expectations for it were too high after having some amazing versions of the dish in Peru. Ropa vieja had a nice depth of flavor, but the meat did indeed have the texture of old clothes. Yellow rice and beans on the side greatly benefited from the addition of the green hot sauce (super spicy, be warned!). Vegetable empanada was okay, but I tend to really enjoy anything in a baked shell. We finished the meal with tres leches, which was a bit soggier than I usually like it, but the addition of rum and meringue added a nice twist to the dish.BYOB, so no drinks on the menu.Service was friendly and on top of things.

We headed to La Isla on the Sunday before Labor Day a little after 11 a.m., with backup brunch places in mind because of Yelp reviews that stated how crowded this spot can get. Luckily for us, there was zero wait, and we picked a table inside, immediately ordering the cafe con leche (skim for me). We picked the sweet spot of arrival time, because not even 30 minutes later, the restaurant, which is small to begin with, was PACKED. The coffee was delicious - so creamy and fresh that you don't need sugar, and will feel a little fuller after drinking one. BF ordered the famous stuffed French toast... and a side of bacon, while I settled on pancakes... and home fries. We definitely overdid it, and probably could have split that delicious French toast, stuffed with cream cheese and strawberry, drizzled in guava (that was battered with a corn flake/nut combo). It was incredible, but I could literally have about two bites of it (despite wanting more) in fear that I wouldn't be able to finish my three massive blueberry pancakes (spoiler alert, it didn't matter because I couldn't finish anyway). The food was phenomenal, and the service was also attentive and warm, without being invasive. Food arrived quickly, the staff was fast to refill glasses, ask if we wanted more coffee (yes), and drop the check at an appropriate time.

One sandwich, a side of plantains and a bottle of sangria is the perfect brunch for two, and most importantly will leave room for some post-meal flan. It's a damn near perfect sandwich- crispy bread stuffed with sweet pickles and thick layers of ham, pork and swiss. Instead of mustard La Isla's condiment of choice is a garlic mojo spread, it's bursting with flavor and really makes the sandwich come alive. I've only ever ordered the El Cubano but I'll have to come in during dinner and try some of my favorite Cuban entrees like arroz con pollo or skirt steak in a chimmichurri sauce.

I am not normally a breakfast/sweets person but this was out of this world. It came with two pieces and I was only able to eat one which left me with a nice after dinner treat.  The woman who took my order was very prompt and came to take my order as soon as I walked in.I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone and I can't wait to bring my family here next time they come to visit!",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

When my friend and I experienced the lunchtime munchies, I did a quick Yelp search for nearby eateries and this spot came up. Luckily, I didn't need to convince her of anything, and within five minutes, we were seated at La Isla.The Camarones Encendido + Yellow Rice and Fries sides = Jumbo shrimp sautéed in olive oil, garlic, onion, peppers, and olives. Was it delicious? Oh my, yes. Was the rice fluffy and yellow and everything my little yellow rice-loving heart desires? Many times yes. I actually think I might have had a foodgasm blackout for a couple of minutes there, as there are some missing frames every time I try to recall the scene of our meal. Oh well. Worth it.The Cuban Sandwich is as scrumptious as you would expect for a Cuban spot.

Took a risk and went there on a Saturday night, but the wait was probably only about 15-20 minutes with 4 parties ahead of us. We snagged two seats at the bar because we noticed there was a quicker turnover versus the tables (limited seating!)Started with the papas rellenas and they stood up to the hype. GET THEM. The sauce it came with was smoky, spicy, and perfect, I ended up using it for my main meal too. My bf and I got the Cuban sandwich and the steak sandwich to split. I enjoyed both, but the cuban was the best I've ever had. They didn't come with sides so we had a side of yuca fries and sweet plantains. The yuca fries came with some sort of crushed garlic topping and it was freaking heavenly. I was highly impressed with this spot, my expectations were not too high given the overhype and publicity it got via Diners, drive-ins, and dives. I was very wrong..

SURPRISE CHICKEN!Everything is just so deliciously seasoned (salty just the way I like it) and so tender and soft.Highly recommend.  I know they have two locations, but from what I gauged the uptown location is more up-scale-y and has more of that nice table setting and tiled floor look whereas the downtown location is more of a smaller location that's more your local corner restaurant.Just a tip, if you're going during a high traffic time, make sure you write your name and party size down.  Right when you walk in there's a clipboard to your left.  There's no hostess and when it gets packed and busy, the staff is all over the place.  To be honest, you're not going here for their service and to be treated like a princess.  You're coming here for some good authentic Cuban food.  If you want service and more classy decor, try the uptown location.",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

99,mjoPd2xa8BCsKus5bnca0A,Gabriela L.,4.0 star rating,"One of my go-to spots for a hearty Cuban meal that wont break the bank. I don't mind waiting, and almost always there is a wait considering there are only about 5/6 tables and 15 bar stools. Once you are seated, the waiters are pretty quick getting your order in and the kitchen is pretty efficient when it comes to getting your food out. If its appropriate, get a Cuban latte. If you're walking by and want a snack, get an empanada. Brunch? Try El Balsero or Churrasco. The meat is always super flavorful, well seasoned and cooked perfectly. Gotta get the rice, beans and sweet plantains on the side to round it all out. I have seen the French Toast and heard raves about it, so if you're into a sweet breakfast, thats definitely right up your alley. Lunchtime? Go for the Cuban. It's really damn good and the garlic mojo is even better. Dinner? EVERYTHING. You just really can't go wrong with this place. My ONLY qualm, and this goes back to how quickly everything is brought out, is that some sides and popular appetizers aren't piping hot. This is a personal pet peeve, since I prefer burning my tongue over eating luke warm food. I haven't yet tried the uptown location, however it has a full bar and excepts reservations.

Not sure why this dish is so 'famous' here.The other Cuban basics are... fine. Decent ropa vieja, good tostones, perfectly acceptable yuca. Don't order their churrasco though - it's dry and extremely fatty - a 4/10 at best when you can get a 9/10 version of it at any of the other Cuban places I mentioned above.Staff is usually nice, but the wait is long sometimes since the place is small.

When I first moved to Hoboken, my stepmom who is Cuban, highly recommended La Isla for its authentic Cuban food. Probably one of the only times I will say she was absolutely right... the food will not let you down - the portions are a pretty good size and will definitely fill you up. My boyfriend loved the breaded steak (El Bistek Empanizado) and I'm a huge fan of the chicken empanadas - the yellow rice and beans are a must for a side dish. The reason I only gave 4 stars is because the one time I physically ate at the restaurant, the service was comically horrible. We brought a bottle of white wine - first we asked for a bucket of ice to keep it chilled and they said they ""don't do that"" (hm???) - then we asked to have the bottle opened and a server literally threw a bottle opener down on the table for us to do it ourselves. Given that it is a ""hole in the wall"" type place I hontestly wasn't too surprised by the quality of the service, but since then I've only ordered delivery/pick-up. Not the place to go if you're looking for a nice sit down dinner (with remotely quality service).All in all, I HIGHLY recommend the food, but would suggest ordering in/picking up :) I still have to give the new location on 11th and Washington a try!

FOOD: With the sandwiches and entrees available, I do not think you can go wrong here. I think their sandwich options are good and authentic, so it can be a grab and go for the people in a rush. I got a Picadillo (Cubano, por supuesto) that's a hash of deliciousness going on it. With ground meat, vegetables, cumin, all those great spices, it's mighty tasty. I got black rice (your other choices are white and yellow) and beans to go with. The black rice is delicious with beans and meat in it as well, it's quite filling and tasty, and the beans themselves were very tasty. SERVICE: Pretty standard but attentive!

Sadly, it was to no avail.  As kismet would have it, some nights are meant to remain just a memory.  I should have seen this coming--the bill for four came to just under $50.  We spent a few extra minutes attempting to empty the contents of our wine bottle, which greatly displeased Victor, our waiter.   Victor requested we make space for the patrons-in-waiting.  But, amigo, surely, there's more time; we loitered by the door for 25 minutes before getting a table.  It wasn't meant to be.  People want this table, pronto--an hour was plenty of time.  Get out.

130,WIYRnrwFiE4C8ubiXGt6LQ,Ben W.,4.0 star rating,"Cuban food in Hoboken? Ño!Friday night brought us to an event in Hoboken and we were starving by the end of it. We walked down Washington St, our attention drawn to every crowded restaurant. We eventually found ourselves at La Isla and the four star rating sealed the deal.There's a list at the front to put your name onto, and luckily when we inquired about the wait time, two seats at the bar opened, so we jumped on that.The menu is huge, offering an assortment of entrees and sandwiches. We also noticed that they were featured on ""Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives."" We opted for Ceviche de Camarones, Tasajo con Boniato, made popular by the show, and El Cubano sandwich. It was at this time we noticed La Isla is a BYO (with no corking fee!), so the bf went to grab a bottle of white.The ceviche came out pretty quickly. Presentation was great and the plantain chips were perfect; so crispy, tasty, and not oily. The ceviche wasn't the best though. It was more on the sweet end and the flavors didn't have too much depth. I would however take another plate of plantain chips haha.The entree and sandwich came out next. The Cubano was probably my favorite. First off, it was so neat looking, carefully pressed to the point where the bread was a smooth, tan plane. The pickle brought all the meats together into a hot, gooey bite. The small detail of the Cuban newspaper clipping on the bottom was a nice touch. The tasajo was tasty, but like the ceviche, a little too sweet for my taste. Not to be crude, but the meat tasted like it was marinated in a sugary soda. I did appreciate the variety of textures though. It had something crunch on top (still don't know what it was, deep-fried potato strings?) on top, hearty sweet potatoes in the middle, shredded beef, and rice to bring it all together. Each bite was difference and despite the flavors, was an enjoyable dish to chew.For dessert, we split a Tres Leches cake. Once again, presentation was beautiful. The torched marshmallow on top and fruit accents made it almost too pretty to eat. Not to sound like a hypocrite, but the cake was really really sweet and I loved it. The creaminess of the marshmallow, tartness of the fruit, and the cake made for a great finish to the meal.Service was great. We did need to ask for a few things (water, wine glasses), but it was always promptly brought out. One of the servers behind the counter had so much sass, but in a good way. She kept us entertained throughout.I've only been to Hoboken three times ever, but this makes the short list of tasty places in the neighborhood! I will, however, need to sample a different part of the menu.",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

If you don't mind eating in a small space and want to just enjoy quality food then this is a great spot to go ...

135,H5b6Mjh46j7DiCYGOnjfWQ,Juan T.,1.0 star rating,"In not sure why are people giving this place 4 and 5 stars. Its mediocre at best. Let's begin. Showed up on Feb 4h around 9 pm with a group of 5. Well 5 can't be seated so one had to leave. Now is 4 and we get seated.  We get 2 menus for 4 people and 2 sets of forks for 4 people.  We were like, WTF are we supposed to share the utensils. We flagged the waiter and he promptly resolved the issue. Placed our orders and the appetizer came first. We got the yucca or casava frita and it was the best thing we had from this rest. I personally ordered the Moro's y cristianos with pork chunks. : The fried pork chunks were not bad but lacked seasoning. It was just a piece of fried pork. I had to add hot sauce to it, to make it better. The rice was so grainy and tasted like came out of one of those frozen meals. I was supper disappointed since I love Moro. The others ordered el Cuban sandwich which was dry. I mean the girl had to put so much ketchup, yes ketchup to make it moist since there was no other sauce. The others ran into the same situation with the pork. It was just dry.Not sure if the chef was there or maybe on vacation but I think he needs to visit the place and try the food. Just having pictures with Bobby flay and Guy Fieri does not make it rock solid food. Get back to basics man, Cuban food is supposed to taste like home cooked meals and not like boxed/frozen crap. Maybe it was his day off but 4 meals and all had the same problem? Old pork? Frozen too long? Don't know but I know its fixable.",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

140,WYRjQbb6rGLo6vyBSIuhIA,Will C.,5.0 star rating,"Beyond the expectations!  I've been wanting to visit the restaurant ever since I saw it on an episode of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  It is definitely as good as advertised!  It's located on busy Washington St in downtown Hoboken, so you know parking is a crapshoot.  We came for a Tuesday lunch so we got lucky to find a parking place within a half mile of the location.The restaurant is small and also provides outdoor seating.  The small space is maximized with varied size tables and counter seating so navigating within is tight, especially during the busy lunch rush.  The clean and quaint character exudes the qualities expected from a small family owned restaurant, delicious homemade food with friendly service.We settled on outside seating and started our lunch with their revered Papa Rellena (mashed potato stuffed with ground beef, breaded and fried) with Salsa Ranchera.  Every bit as good as advertised, and then some!  The outside was fried perfectly golden brown.  When I opened the crispy crunchy crust I arrived at a lusciously creamy mashed potato center, that was stuffed with perfectly seasoned moist tender ground beef.  The accompamying salsa ranchera complimented it wonderfully with a smoky spicy finish.  Definite crowd pleaser!Next up was the Arroz con Pollo.  Again I brought high expectations to this dish and again I was pleasantly rewarded.  It was served with the chicken submerged a ring of golden rice adorned with roasted red pepper slices and freckled with vivid bright green peas.  The golden rice was delicously tender almost to the point of being creamy.  The chicken was remarkably seasoned, very tender and still moist.  The dish struck a harmony of deep well balanced flavors and delivered a wonderful experience.  If I had to pick nits, I would prefer the chicken to be boneless although I know traditionally it is not.  I highly recommend this restaurant for both its delicious food and family like service.  I can't wait to return and experience more of their dishes.",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

Since it was on diners, driveins, and dives, I also tried the tasajo con boniato - it was pretty good but was kind of cold when I got it.

I have never been so full (I don't get full), both times I've been to the eatery.The first time we shared the platano asado, a riot of flavors, and a solo croqueta de jamon, filled with ham and fried crisp on the outside. My lunch special masitas de puerco came with super sweet maduros and perfect soupy black beans. Lime brightened the tender fatty pork pieces. My boyfriend had one of the set meals, tasajo con boniato; the spiciness of the braised dry-cured meat went perfectly with the sweet creaminess of the dark potatoes and the crunch of the fried onions and yellow rice tied it all together. Dessert was mind-blowing. Their tres leches is to die for.This second time, we started with the tamale, which did not have all the flavor I associate with La Isla, but it was still good. Once again, I got the pork pieces, which is now an entrée item, not a lunch special, so it was especially huge. My boyfriend got one of the Friday lunch specials: the beef stew. He got his hearty saucy stew with black beans and salty white rice. The meat was tender and well seasoned.Again, we were stuffed. So stuffed we chose not to get dessert (whaaat?!).

For the meal I got the stuffed chicken with ham, Swiss, and pickles special. It was fantastic. My boyfriend got the churrasco con chimichurri. He liked it but the steak was a little chewy.

The cafe con leche is spot on, strong, smooth, just enough milk and like the bread, also comforting, plus a great value. Their yellow rice is perhaps the best I have had anywhere, especially delicious with their moist and flavorful oxtail stew they serve on Thursdays (come for lunch as they may sell out, it's that good).

As a Hoboken native, my breakfast usually consists of coffee and an amazing Jersey bagel on the weekends. But to go to La Isla, you need to get up early, to wait on line, outside, to get a table. The place is tiny and there is usually a wait, especially on the weekends so my friend and I did just that. Was it worth it?! You have NO IDEA. To start, the Cuban coffee was amazing. It was the real deal and worth the wait outside in itself. When it came to choosing my breakfast choice, here is where I got intimidated. I hate breakfast and normally go for fruit or something bland. So after minutes of sweating and perusing the menu, I chose their famous stuffed french toast which was on the throw-down with Bobby Flay. I thought, I like french toast, and Bobby Flay is my fav, so what could go wrong? Well, I was pleasantly surprised and in love. The Cuban flare on this french toast was to die for.  It was your typical french toast with a touch guava and strawberries mixed into a heavenly morning treat...not to mention La Isla beat Bobby Flay in the throw-down.

It's two doors down from a beer & wine store, which is perfect because La Isla is a BYO. They don't seat you until your entire party is present, which was annoying, especially since it was a Tuesday evening and the restaurant was much closer to empty than it was full. I had the masitas de puerco, which consisted of fried chunks of pork with raw red onion on top. The meat was a tad chewy and didn't seem to be marinated at all, but my sides of yuca and black beans added some flavor that the meat lacked. My friends seemed to enjoy their meals more--a salad with shrimp, and smoked salmon on a black bean/rice cake with guacamole on top.

The eats - muy bueno.  I ordered the maduro, spinach & queso blanco omelette, [served with home fries and toast -  $9.00] Screw your diet and get the CUBAN BREAD instead of regular, boring 'healthy' bread. 9. About their famous stuffed french toast - This did not live up to the hype. While the guava stuffing was delicious, the bread itself was entirely too hard, akin to pie crust. 10.

It is usually packed on the weekends for their guava french toast featured on the Food Network but I prefer salty so I prefer lunch on the weekdays to avoid a wait. My favorite lunch special is their oxtail special. It is hard to a place who makes fall off the bone but still intact oxtails. For those don't know oxtails are just beef on the bone. Think of a short rib but more tender when cooked properly as they do here. They also make a killer cubano sandwich (ham, Swiss and roast pork panini), cuban coffee (dark roast with steamed milk) and what I call a ""potato ball"" (huge softball-sized orbs of mashed potato with a Latin-flavored ground beef center that is flash fried till crunchy that can be a meal by itself).You'll pay twice what you pay 10 minutes away in North Bergen's Little Cuba but eating here saves me the trip and to be honest it's cleaner.

Judging by how breakfast, I would come here for any meal: lunch, brunch, or dinner.  I had the famous Omar's French Stuffed French Toast- which was won a Bobby Flay Throw Down (La Isla has also been featured on Guy Fier's Diners, Dive in and Dives among a thousand of other press mentions).  It's truly a tasty, inventive, dish.  It surprises you too- if you don't usually dig sweet for breakfast (and I don't), trust me, you'll like this french toast because it's not overly sweet.  It's actually more tart- 3 fluffy pieces of fried egg bread, stuffed with strawberries and cream cheese, crusted in almond and corn flakes, doused in guava sauce that is more tart than sugary.  It's a steal for $9- I felt so sick after almost eating all of it, but I wanted to lick my plate. My friend got the huevos rancheros, $12 which was a lot of food.  Poached eggs in a basket of black beans, delectable spicy tomato sauce, all in a fresh tortilla, and a generous side of white rice (you can opt for yellow).  We split a side of Spanish chorizo, which refreshingly, was not just a mass produced link of red sausage.  It was homemade, char grilled, smokey AND fatty at the same time.  They give you 4 half for $3.50.My friend and I each ordered a Cuban Latte which was STRONG and awesome.  A big, hot mug of cafe con lots of leche.Service was fast (a little too fast and rushed..given they put my plate down on top of my silverware x_x).    Definitely worth returning.",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

Fact, I ordered delivery for Omar's stuff toast which everything recommended on Yelp! However, the lady (who has a bit accent) who talked to me was really patient and nice!! She told me that they only delivery for lunch! But I asked her if it could possible for me to get the stuffed toast with my other order of lunch. She asked me to hold on a second, quickly she turned back and asked me whether I would mind the toast would not be warm when the food get delivered to me. I said yes and got my stuffed toast a bit warm when I got them！ I ordered Omar's stuffed toast and roast chicken (thigh) with plantain and yellow rice (which the lady recommended me), and French fries. The Omar's stuffed toast is not amazing but pretty good! The filling inside the sandwich is perfectly sweetened! I wouldn't feel heavy when I finished a whole piece of stuffed toast. But 1 piece of it is very filling to me tho! The roast chicken is good, too! The yellow rice is not strongly flavoured (good thing) n not bland as all. However, in general all dishes I had here so far are not strongly flavoured by spices or sauces. The rice and chicken could have a bit stronger flavoured. Other than that, they are all good :)) I can taste the really food from here! Not too strong, but not to light! Like home food, tasted Just right!",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

I wasn't fortunate enough to sit on a table so service was a little lacking. The hot chocolate was nice and refreshing with a lot of whipped cream. Now most people are aware that Bobby Flay is infamous for tasting Omar's french toast but I have to say if you're not a fan of sweet foods like myself you will not enjoy this. It's definitely not your traditional soft french toast , instead filled with strawberries, guava & covered in frosted flakes and almonds. I would recommend it as a dessert item not a breakfast item. The El basero was delicious, moist and made the wait well worth it, I was given a very large portion for $14.

Anyhow, we sat at the table near the entrance and a couple of guys arrived after us were turned away. It was kind of noisy due to the loud music. My spinach salad was great. The combination of mango, blue cheese, and avocado has some unique flavor. One thing they can improve is to use fresh spinach instead of the one from jumbo bag, so the rotten leaves can be spotted and be taken out. My wife's Pan con Lechon sandwich was in average. The beef has deli taste; the bread was left outside for too long and was bone dry. We did have difficulties to communicate with waiters due to language issue as they all speak Spanish. We took a takeout menu and explained to Him that I would need it for writing review.

The papa rellena was the most memorable and unique dish. The other two were forgettable. For entrees, we ordered the chicken with spinach and chorizo pot roast. The chicken with the cream sauce was great, the sauce was not too heavy but provides the right amount of creamy strength to make the chicken tasty. The chorizo dish was slightly dry.

It's a diner, and a small one. Seating is tight. The place was bustling at 8 on a Friday. Our server, Yosenia, was deep in the weeds, but never took it out on us, quick with a smile and very friendly.We got the papa rellena to start. Think grape fruit sized, tater tot consistency outside, shepherds pie inside. The mashed potato filling was buttery and creamy. Could have had more ground beef at the center. The best part was the salsa ranchero that came with it, smoky with heat that snuck up on you. Get the salsa! Good but I probably wouldn't order again because everything else was better and the portions are massive here. Need to save real estate in the belly.Entrees were pollo al ajillo with arroz con gandules and tostones as the sides and churrasco with spinach and French fries for the sides. My chicken was slammin'. The chicken itself was at least a pound of flesh covered in garlic and herbs over a bed of perfectly sautéed spinach, not overcooked, swimming in a tangy white garlic sauce that I would drink out of a mug. Oh. So. Amazing. Tostones were pretty good but I was kind of wishing i'd gotten the maduros instead when they came walking by. Will do next time. The yellow rice with pigeon peas was tasty, but I only had room for a few bites.  My man's churrasco was okay. Also a huge portion and the chimichurri that came on the side was dee-lish. The fries are very cute shoestring fries that were super crispy.Though I had no room left, I insisted on tres leches. Their version is unique in that in comes in a ramekin and is covered in meringue. The sponge was denser than I'm accustomed to, and this version was less sweet than some others I've had. My sweet tooth is on steroids, so not my exact preference, but I still devoured every morsel. Those without a strong sweet tooth will probably love this version of the dessert. I saw a key lime pie walk by after I ordered. That looked incredible with a massively thick graham cracker crust. I def have to try that next time.I also am dying to try the soups, salmon entree, and arroz con pollo based on what I saw.This is one of those instances in which not every thing was 5 star, but the overall experience was great and there are so many things I want to go back for that they get the nod.

The restaurant is on the small side and as expected, relatively crowded when we entered. After a few moments however, we were promptly notified by the personable employees that the wait time wouldn't be more than a few minutes and thankfully we were seated shortly thereafter. After devouring the famous Papa Rellena appetizer to start and the succulent daily special (Fricasse de Pollo) a few minutes afterwards, any further words will only fail to do this place justice.

But it was the best experience with cuban food we had in jersey. We first started with the Ceviche as an appetizer and it was just bomb.com. Very good and very fruity with a slight tangy taste. I have no other words to describe it other than  you can not pass on this one.  The Choripan was definitely an authentic cuban sandwich and it wasn't over or under cooked but just right, with the right amount of crisp. Now the desserts alone should receive a separate rating because the restaurant can operate as a dessert bar alone with their Coconut Mango Cheesecake and Tres Leches. I'm not a big fan of Coconut, Mango  or cheesecake but they somehow managed to satisfy my tastebuds with all three as a combo and I have to say I can't complain and they did a pretty damn good job of it. Tres Leches was definitely on the sweeter side, but then again it is tres leches. No other words than you be the judge.

We couldn't wait to try everything based on all the reviews but after we waited an hour and a half for our food, we slowly started to wonder. The food came out luke warm and was lacking something, can't put my finger on it. I guess the quality reminded me of a high end diner and I love diners but just not what we were expecting. The sangria was the worst I've ever had, tasted like cheap fruit juice, no alcohol, no fruit. Service was horrendous but will chalk that up to just opening. The restaurant itself felt institutional, and was so beyond loud that the 4 of us stopped talking bc we were screaming. They even addressed that they have a sound issue.

It probably has only 6 tables that seat 4 or 5, some bar seats, and 4 outside tables. But I really think that's what cuban food is all about, homey, nothing fancy and cozy. You'll hear awesome spanish music in the background but it's not too loud so that's a plus, nice decor, a bunch of pictures everywhere on the walls and a little flower in the table all the time. I always try to make it there for lunch, lunch food is always better than dinner food at La Isla, plus it's much cheaper. The arroz con pollo is awesome! Almost as good as my friend's mom's. Honestly, restaurants can't beat a spanish mom's food but La Isla was pretty close. They fry their maduros soooo well. I love it. Slightly crisp on the outside and wonderfully sweet on the inside. Their arroz con gandules is sooo flavorful too. They give you huge portions and I come out stuffed but I always try my best to clean off my plate. I've never even had their dessert before. Compared to other restaurants in hoboken, this is pretty cheap. Around 20-30 bucks for huge lunch for 2 people (if you order drinks) or 30-40 for dinner (excluding wine). Awesome homey food, but I really do encourage you to have their lunch before you try their dinner though. Their dinner specials really aren't as special. Oh and their cuban sandwiches are amazing!  I want to try their stuffed french toast one day, rumor has it is that they're amazing. If you don't think this place is good for a date, you should reconsider. It's such a comfortable and non-stuffy environment that you end up talking so much over some really great food.

The way they dip the French toast with cornflakes and almonds makes it so different from other stuffed French toasts. The toast itself has such a fabulous combination of subtle flavors that really come together. It's crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside.

When I called and asked them to deliver me a new one (I live 2 blocks away). I was rejected.OK, ill pick it up. So I went to go pick it up and the owner/manager was there and took a bite of my flan right in front of me and confirmed it was spoiled! I asked them ""do you make it fresh?"" he said yes on the phone but in person the guy told me it was the only flan they sold that day. So, don't come here expecting fresh food. Also, dont expect them to believe you when you tell them food is spoiled. The only way to prove it is if they take a bite of your food. I was EXPECTING a refund, free dessert or something...what did I get? nothing? He gave me the tres leches dessert; which I really don't like but agreed to take.

Brunch/breakfast here is always really busy, but worth the wait. For brunch, we tried the famous stuffed french toast (amazing), the huevos rancheros (pretty good), the churrasco and black beans (amazing), and the chorizo omelette (pretty good). Sister's boyfriend tried their cuban latte which he said was pretty damn good as well. For dinner, we've tried the cuban (huge, tasty sandwich for only $8), ceviche, tostones (favorite), tasajo con boniato (not worth the hype on ddd, but still good. meat was too salty. the sweet potatoes were the best part), churrasco con chimichurri (solid - nice and tender), and the frozen key lime pie (amazing).

It's great that no matter which location you choose, the food is the same, so it just depends what type of atmosphere you want. I personally enjoy this location better because it is BYOB. I've been here where I was sat right away and I've also had times where I had to wait about 30 minutes. The food is always impressive...they have truly authentic Cuban cuisine and never make you feel rushed when you are finishing your drinks!

I went for the pan con bistec, a grilled steak sandwich with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and crispy potato sticks. good quality meat, fresh veggies, and the potato sticks added a nice crunch to it. a good analogy is those french fry sticks you can buy at random bodegas and delis for like 50 cents (remember when they were just a quarter?), but these were made fresh. sandwich was pretty huge too! man, I was filled.price was cheap - we each threw in 11 bucks and were set. service was really fast. lunchtime is probably their peak time, and they handle it quite well.they have daily specials as well. roast chicken, grilled fish, stew, and more.this is definitely worth the wait time! hopefully the disgustingly high rent prices of Washington Street don't torpedo this restaurant's future!",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

Just a short trip on the PATH train, however, yielded a couple great things - a wonderful, unique view of Manhattan and a delicious Cuban lunch. La Isla is a tiny lunch counter with a handful of four-top tables. We had a group of five so four of us took a table and one sat adjacent at the counter. We were not headed for this place, but rather stumbled on it by virtue of Yelp.We tried numerous dishes all of which had a delicious home-cooked flavor. It's as if a kind family opened their kitchen to serve you the same wonderful food they're having. The chicken was succulent and beautiful with a nice, roasted flavor. The plantains were delicious. One of the kids tried a signature dish which is a mashed potato ball filled with meat and he loved it. The real standout was ""Tasajo"" which is a braised beef dish but the starting product is a cured meat. This was served over yellow rice with beans and Cuban sweet potatoes. Really delicious. We did not know, but the chef here, Omar has been featured on a few television shows including Bobby Flay's Throwdown in which he bested Bobby and on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. We also didn't realize that he was sitting right next to us while on a break from the kitchen.

So delicious and filling, you won't even want to look at more food for the rest of the day! Hueveos rancheros here were a healthy portion of rice and black beans, crispy tortilla, and two perfected poached eggs. I am especially picky about my beans, but La Isla's were perfect, not over/undercooked or salty, not too saucy either. Whatever combination of flavors they had going on really worked. The spicy tomato sauce topping off the dish was the best added kick. My friend enjoyed the famous stuffed french toast, filled with guava and crusted with corn flakes. I was skeptical by the combo, but I found it very tasty. The guava cream cheese seemed to cut down on the sweetness and added a savory note which I liked.

Otherwise the exterior gets hard as a rock)MUST GET: the orange juice with milk. DELICIOUS. Tastes like a creamsicle. I would order this again and again.

Convinced my boyfriend to come have a nice ""hole in the wall"" dinner. Ummmm I was disappointed to say the least , our waiter didn't feel like he wanted to be there, and when we asked for recommendation he just read us the menu. I ordered the grilled chicken with spinach and cream sauce, my honey ordered vaca frita. We ordered and it was out in no more than 5 min. My chicken tasted burnt! Not grilled I couldn't taste the sauce or anything because of burnt flavor was overpowering. The vaca frita is very thin, so if it's not made fresh you can see and taste it. It was hard and dry! When the waiter asked about our food i was very honest, his response was you should of told me right away so I could have said something. I wanted to say "" welllllllllll if you ever came to check on us, I would have told your miserable ass!"" They took the chicken off our bill, so I threw them a bone and gave them one star. The price did not match the portions, and I didn't get the real Cuban feel I got years ago. If you want real good cheap Cuban food go to Rumba Cubana or Gran Via in Union City.

329,ZH9bUesNTBbzkYDgMBLRAA,Jordan M.,5.0 star rating,"La Isla has been written up countless times so I don't need to expand too much. I live in Hoboken for the last eight years, and I've ordered from la Isla  probably several hundred times, almost 1/2x per week. For breakfast, you can't go wrong with a simple scrambled eggs and toast with the Cuban coffee they serve.  everything is always served perfectly right.  My favorite, on occasion, is Omar's French toast, stuffed with a guava cream cheese filling that is to die for, with layers of strawberry and crusted with cornflake on the outside. You need to experience it to understand it, and unlike other places that do a similar entrée, the cream cheese guava jelly feelings does not overpower the dish.  I will usually get this, eat one of the slices, save the next for a snack or dessert later on. Just throw it in the toaster for one cycle and it's just as good as when you eat it fresh.For lunch I would have to recommend the cubano sandwich - although I must admit, once in a while it is exceptionally good when the bread is lightly toasted but fluffy inside, and the pulled pork is nice and juicy, but often times this sandwich isn't perfect when delivered, which is a shame because it really is exceptional when at its best.  Even when it's not on top of its game, it's still a great sandwich, and I usually use some of the hot sauce in the packets that they give you for a little extra kick.For lunch and dinner, I would recommend starters, the chicken empanadas, which are filled with pulled chicken but chunks as well, lightly toasted on the outside, really good, the croquet de jamon is good for a few bites each, and ice little mixture of some kind of ham and bread filling lightly fried on the outside, nice and tasty but not too heavy or too much.Dinner is pretty much throw a dart against the menu and you are good to go.  Their old meets are great, I usually go with the pulled pork, my favorite entrée special is the Ropa VIeja, which is April flank steak in a red sauce, it's really good, buttery soft, and Foursides I usually get white rice with Maduros, with a small red beans on the side as well.  Your entrée will come with a choice of two sides, but I like to add the third. This dinner will always last me at least two meals, sometimes three if I'm not starving. The leftovers are great, I usually throw everything together in a bowl, throw it in the microwave, and the flavors all complement each other so well.The mango cheesecake that they have for dessert is on another level, I actually have to force myself to go a month without ordering it because it got out of hand.  I love cheesecake and this mango cheesecake is one of the best ever.  Also, your coffee is some of the best in town, dark roast with a strong flavor, highly caffeinated, and they will serve it with milk Cuban style if you don't specify otherwise.Honestly, there is only one complaint I could ever serve against this restaurant, and that is the young man who mostly answers the phone to take phone orders. I always cringe when he picks up because he is rude and makes it awkward, especially since I order so often and he knows that, and I am always overly polite, you would think that he would be a little bit more polite.  whenever the women answer the phone, I am so relieved, which is weird because why should I feel uncomfortable when placing a phone delivery order, but he honestly makes it that weird, like he is annoyed having to take your food order.  it's not the biggest deal obviously, but since they are such nice people that own it, all of the people are so nice that work there, it's a very nice family vibe that you get there, so you would think that he would also keep that going as he is the face of the company to anybody who calls the place their order.  obviously not enough to stop me from ordering twice a week, that would be great if he could maybe chipper up a little bit lol, he should be enthusiastic about selling what I consider to be the best cooked food in town.",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

It's super small inside, so lineups and wait times can be long, but it's definitely worth it.I started with the beef empanada, which came out within minutes and was hot and fresh. It was so expertly seasoned that you could easily enjoy it with no hot sauce or salsa - in fact, even though I tried it with the green hot sauce (yowza!) I ate most of it naked, because the flavor was just too good to mess with.As an entree I got the Churrasco con Chimichurri, medium rare, and to my surprise, it actually came out medium rare! Not only was it cooked to perfection, but it was seasoned beautifully and the green sauce on the side? USE IT. For the love of all things holy, use it! Smother that meat in delicious green sauce and put it in your mouth. There. I said it. On the side I got black beans (a little sloppy, more wet than beany) and fried green plantains, which were garlicky and all kinds of delicious.Service was fast without being unfriendly and we didn't feel hurried to finish, even though the place has very few tables and people were waiting at the door.

It appears that there is no end to this city's surprises because the breakfast here makes this one of best spots around.I've been here several times over the years and I usually steer more towards the more traditional Cuban dishes but I didn't know what to expect when I tried their version of french toast. Apparently it was featured on the Food Network's Throwdown with Bobby Flay. They call it Omar's stuffed french toast. All I know is that is was delicious. Two pieces of powdered French toast dipped in cinnamon batter, coated with corn flakes, almonds, and stuffed with strawberries and guava cream cheese. Everything was a happy blend of satisfying goodness.I've also had the omelettes here as well. You get your choice of three fillings. I usually go with chorizo, manchego cheese, and onions. A side of platanos maduros provides a great compliment to it. The home fries here are amazing too. They don't phone it in like a lot of places do with home fries.  Another tasty thing to try here are their specialty beverages they call batidos. It's their version of  a shake made with milk and ice. Being half PR, I tend to love anything made with coconut. The coconut batido is here is fantastic. I think you lose your latin restaurant license if you don't make a good cafe con leche. Of course, it goes without saying that they do a pretty good one here. The only wish I have for this place is to expand their menu a bit. The amount of items listed aren't very many. I guess it's not really hurting their business because I'm told that this place gets pretty packed during the day and especially on weekends. Be prepared for an hour wait at times. Luckily, I didn't run into that problem because I came in on a weekday morning and it opens really early. I came in around 7am and had the place all to myself.

The restaurant opened it's doors 2 min early to allow a line of 15 diners in. It was much appreciated as the limited seating was gobbled up and the smell of fried eggs and Cuban lattes filled the air. My girlfriend and I were fortunate enough to get prime seating at the counter top, where we were immediately waited on by the ""Noboken"" shirt wearing staff. From, host, waitress and bus boy everyone was super friendly and patient as we phonetically figured our way through each order. I opted for the Choripan(a delicious chorizo sandwich with caramelized onions and potato hash) while my girlfriend had the delectable El balsero (pulled beef, rice and beans with two poached eggs). Each dish tasted as good as it's presentation. The fresh soft Cuban bread really made the experience of my breakfast sandwich, while my girlfriend, full and satisfied, resisted the urge to take her meal home for fear of eating it all day long. The quality and taste of this outing demands atleast one follow up visit to try out The Bobby Flay Throw Down dish; stuffed French toast. From what I could see in the 45 min we were there, it's insanely populate, as expected and looks delicious. Combined with great pricing, this literal hole in the wall is worth the time and energy for some great Cuban food. I look forward to getting back to La Isla and recommend all those with a sense of culinary adventure or a healthy appreciation for honest Cuban short order. And don't forget to take a overstuffed beef empanada to go.",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

The breast and wing where full of herby and garlicky flavor but it was dry. It comes with grilled garlicky onions on top and 2 sides. I had it with black beans and yucca. The beans are awesome full of flavor, the yucca is boiled and with chopped garlic on top, it was pretty tasty but I was picturing fried yucca as it doesn't specify on the menu. The white rice is just plain no spices, oil or flavor, but I like that because it combined well with everything else. I took a star away because my food was cold and they had to rewarm it and that took long.

We sat at the bar and observed the activity as we ate (I've been here about three times and it doesn't matter when you go, it's always busy). I don't know what they do to their bread, but I love the consistency of it: crisp on the outside and mealy on the inside.We almost finished our sandwiches, but alas, our appetites failed us.

It's so cute and colorfully-painted inside, and has a casual and calm atmosphere.We've been twice in the last week - so that should tell you how much we like it. First time we went, we had the papa relleno (before realizing it was the signature dish). I want to go back to have just one of these, because a fried ball of diced meat and mashed potatoes sounds like a full meal to me. And would therefore allow me to not feel bad about finishing it.The chicken with garlic sauce is beyond amazing. I could pour that sauce on my cereal in the morning, that's how yummy it is. The grilled chicken comes on spinach and even my greens-avoiding boyfriend was all over it. Like we fought over who got the last of the sauced-up spinach. The second time we came was during the lunch rush and we got a cubano (and another papa relleno). It was good but we wished we'd gotten an entree instead after our garlic chicken bliss.The service is attentive and welcoming, the food is great, and the ambiance is perfect.

For the main course we both got Cuban sandwiches.  These things were huge.  Considering we were trying everything on the menu, we should have split one.  It definitely was enough.  And for dessert (that's right, dessert) we tried these empanadas with stuffed with fruit and cheese.  Similar to the French toast, but still pretty awesome.  Top all that off with a cafe con leche, and the whole experience was complete.  I understand that this place can get a little crazy, but I would say it was worth the wait.",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

The influx of yuppies has definitely hurt this place; they now think they can serve below average food for well above average prices. I suggest the Cuban which has a MUCH BETTER ATMOSPHERE and great customer service for the same price as this outdated cafeteria-style hole-in-the-wall.Not to mention, they run out of food ALL THE TIME - seriously - that's how they run the business.Anyway, I digress, if you're looking for the authentic feel, go just about anywhere else in Union City or North Bergen.",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

One of my favorite restaurants anywhere, and I am an Italian gourmet cook, a hardcore ""foodie"" and a big wine collector. At 12th and Maxwell Lane, this is simply great Cuban food with a hip bar scene and excellent service. The crowd is a mix of young and older. In a market over served by Italian and steak restaurants, this is simply a great find. The new uptown space is airy and bright with a Cuban flair and a lively, fun crowd. They have kept the casual feel of the downtown La Isla (which is still going strong) upfront but have created a much more upscale dining area in the back. Go, order the garlic chicken (over the top) or anything else for that matter. It's all great at a reasonable price. Finally Omar, the chef, has been featured on the Food Network twice, and the owners are simply the best. Worth the boat trip from Manhattan as it is a short walk from the 14th St. NY Waterway ferry.

405,NEqV756CKvuxuaLC2W_GbA,Tiffany G.,1.0 star rating,"I've been to La Isla Restaurant quite a few times and although the food was good as always, I must say that I was a bit disappointed in the service. I went there for lunch one afternoon and although the restaurant was not packed, I couldn't help but feel rushed by my waiter. Now, I'm not one of those people who sits down and takes forever to eat so there was no reason for him to rush me. That was one reason I am giving it only one star. The second is because I was in Hoboken last night with some friends and wanted them to try the relleno de papas. Well, we had a hard time finding parking but when finally did we went straight to La Isla. We did not want to sit down and eat, we simply wanted a couple of relleno de papas. Well, we walked in at 9:48pm (they close at 10) and the heavy-set lady behind the counter rudely told us that they were closed. She didn't even bother to ask if she could help us with anything. She should not have assumed that we wanted a meal or to sit down and eat. What about if we simply wanted to purchase a bottle of water or dessert to go? We did not appreciate her being so rude and short with us. I am very big on good customer service and I've recommended La Isla to many people. I highly doubt that I will go back to this restaurant. The food is good but it's not so good that it's worth dealing with rude people.

Although I am not well versed in Cuban cuisine, I've eaten at several locally recommended Cuban food spots across the nation, and appreciate making this Hoboken recommendation. The Pan con Bistec has become my comfort food when I do not want to cook. The thin cut steak is lightly marinated with black pepper. This allows the pickled vegetables and chili to shine thought and create a hearty tasting sandwich. My friend had me try the Papa Rellena, which is now my favorite large snack.

408,Co9cm0AfhOJowbToDYIyhA,Stephanie C.,5.0 star rating,Wow who knew there was such a great Cuban restaurant in Hoboken! And one that was on Throwndown with Bobby Flay. We came here for brunch on a nice Sunday afternoon and we only waited 10 minutes. Of course we ordered the Stuffed French Toast that was on the show and it was amazing! The outside was crispy with toasted almonds and the inside was filled with fresh strawberries and cream. I recommend that you share this because it's two pieces and can be overwhelming if you have both slices yourself. We also got the steak with eggs and rice and beans. The eggs were nothing special but the steak was nice and juicy and went really well with the lime and beans.I'm kicking myself because we forgot to try the flan.,La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

We thought it was a perfect night to sit outside. Big mistake. A man who appeared to be homeless and drunk began harassing us and everyone sitting outside at La Isla. When none of the guests gave into his requests for money and his maniacal staring at the guests did not work, the man began to get irritated and starting yelling expletives (such as ""suck my d***!"") in front of the children and the rest of the guests sitting outside. What did the staff at La Isla do in response? Absolutely nothing. They just stared out the window at the man harassing all of their guests. We actually had to get up and go inside in the middle of our meal to get away from the harassment. When I asked a member of the La Isla staff to speak with a manager, he pointed at our waiter who was obviously not the manager. They did not do anything to accomodate us - in fact, they made us stand there uncomfortably for 15 minutes while they ran our credit card. The whole time, they continued to watch the man harass their guests through the window. This place is very poorly run and they do not care about repeat business. The food was average at best.",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

When we came in it was empty but during the hour or so we were there it quickly filled up. And I can see why. We split a chicken empanada to start - we weren't starving but wanted a little something to nibble on - and it was pretty perfect. It was not oily, the crust was fried lightly. And the filling was fresh and just enough spice. As always Byob is pretty clutch especially when the pricing is a little high. But we definitely got our money's worth. I had the go to triple D featured Tasajo Con Boniato. It was a great size portion and the flavors gelled together nicely.  I was nervous that it would be cliche and dated but it was delicious and I'm glad I ordered it.

It's hard to find that creamy consistency that is specific to Cuban flan - not the ubiquitous tofu-like Spanish counterpart, but the one here is spot on. Entrees aren't the cheapest for what is a very casual restaurant atmosphere, however the portions are HUGE and more than make up for that. You can easily get 1-2 additional lunches out of one portion, especially if you get a rice as one of your two sides.

Items #4 & 5  - Shakes...One guava (no milk), one banana (with milk).  Both were good but banana shakes remind me of baby food so I'm not a huge fan regardless of how good and the guava one was a tiny bit too sweet for my taste.  The wait time wasn't bad for two but the service was weird.  Our order came out at all different times...First french toast, then omelette a few minutes later.  Then a few more minutes later the banana shake.  Fast forward five minutes more later and the ham croquette followed two minutes later by the guava shake.  No rhyme or reason to how/when they bring out food and drink.  I quickly forgot about that, though, once I actually tasted the food.  For a bill of $32 with tip, it was a perfect brunch!",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

At the age of 4 I became hooked on guava, avocados and all things Cuban. Those early, amazing food memories were so strong that 30 years in Massachusetts did nothing to dim them. When I was an undergrad I took a couple of Cuban cooking courses in Harvard Sq. So while not Cuban by blood, I'm pretty well-versed and very much in love with this cuisine. And I love love love La Isla. This tiny kitchen turns out some amazingly big, bright flavors. The decor is kitschy, which works perfectly. There's a long counter with swivel stools that runs the length of the place (perfect if dining alone, or if you just don't want to wait for a table). There are only a few tables, inside and out. Expect a wait on the weekends for their delicious brunch. The iced Cuban latte is really good. There are a couple of things I have to order every time: The Shrimp ceviche w/plantains (technically an appetizer, but honestly big enough to have for a light lunch) and the guava shake, which is delicious. You can get the fruit shakes with or without milk. I find the guava is best just with fruit and ice (the banana shake is really good w/milk). Their pressed sandwiches are tasty too. Try the Choripan: Chorizo, carmelized onions, potato sticks on Cuban bread. La Isla's stuffed french toast was featured on the Food Network's Throwdown with Bobby Flay.

When they invited me to join in on their adventure to Hoboken, I thought WHY NOT?It was a Sunday morning around 10:30am. We had a party of 8 and had to be seated separately in groups of 4. Claustrophobes BE WARE! this place is TINY. The staff move at lightning sped. If they come to your table and you're not ready, they move on. There were plates and plates of amazingness coming from the kitchen and I had a hard time deciding. Our group decided to try one order of the french toast and split a few sandwiches. We also caught the empanadas and got a few of those too! I started my morning like any other with a huge mug of their cafe con leche. Strong coffee with hot foamy milk. A touch of sugar and I'm home! Delicious. The empanadas were huge and at $3.50 a pop, i expect them to be. They were filled to capacity but the beef empanadas were much better than the chicken- because the chicken was DRY.I ordered a Media Noche which is shredded roast pork, drenched in Mojo, pickles, ham on sweet bread pressed in the plancha... or the panini press. The french toast was quite a sight. two thick slices of bread dredged in sweet egg mixture and then pressed into corn flakes and griddled. the innards are stuffed with cream cheese and guava and the whole thing is drizzled with guava and dusted with powdered sugar. It was delicious but far too rich to be enjoyed alone. I ate 1/4 of it and it was the perfect amount to taste... a whole order to myself and I would be in a diabetic coma. The service was quick. But this place is small. Beware if you: -hate crowds-tight spaces-have a big butt-have friends with big butts. Just saying.",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

With a gigantic cup of coffee, hardly anything better to start off a lazy weekend.If you're in the mood for a spicy start, go for the Huevos Rancheros. The spicy tomato sauce has a beautifully orchestrated kick to it. Eggs were poached well (could've been better according to my girlfriend).I've also tried some of their regular menu items - shrimp in spicy tomato sauce (this tastes different from the one in the huevos rancheros), the roast pork and the chicken in garlic sauce were all uniformly excellent. The pork especially, with no sauce, still managed to be flavorful in all kinds of delicious ways.The place is small and can mean some wait times, but walk around and gaze the hundreds of people lining up for the Cake Boss' shop right across and come back for the amazing food!",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

The potato ball was ok..sitting under a warm lamp. Entrees- Codfish and the Tasajo. The Cod..tho wasn't bad, had nothing CUBAN about it.The tostones came out rock hard like a crispy frisbee. The white rice(on both dishes) was undercooked-hard, fried yuca way too fried, and Tasajo was supposed to come with sweet potato but didn't. The only thing that saved my meal was the cured beef and the maduros(how can u mess that up) Btw whatever was shredded on top of my beef was Stale.

This is a no-nonsense jewel that exemplifies what an awesome place Hoboken is for ethnic and diverse cuisine. There is hype associated with La Isla due to their feature on ""diners, drive-ins, and dives"" and subsequent endorsement by Guy Fieri, so it is a popular spot for visitors, but it is also a very homey spot that locals flock to 24/7. The staff are on their game and know the food they're serving well, so you can ask them if you're feeling at a loss with the menu. My personal go-to's are their great empanadas (both chicken and beef), papas rellenos (glorious deep fried balls of potato stuffed with ground beef), and killer tamales. For entrees, their chicken stew is a really tasty homestyle dish, and you can't go wrong with anything in their specials.

Kinda elegant presentation with a taste that instantly brings a smile to your face.Churrasco a Caballo con Arroz y Frijoles Negros (Steak & Eggs) - This is a skirt steak served with eggs, rice and black beans. I chose to have my eggs poached and served with yellow rice. Not a bad dish, but my eggs were lacking flavor and I would prefer a different cut of steak. I still would suggest it if you're in the mood to make the AM power move that is Steak & Eggs b/c I have learned that most places leave you regretful after ordering Steak & Eggs and this one did not (I was pleased).El Balsero - (*Sunday Brunch only*) This was truly amazing; two eggs (poached) over shredded flank steak, rice and black beans. The flavor of the meat was insane and I loved how everything blended together after breaking the yoke of the eggs (I'm a BIG combination eater). I was very pleased with this dish and did not like it when my friend kept trying to eat it.My friend also had bacon, avocado and scallion omelette (Tortilla de Tocineta, Aguacate y Cebolline) and was very pleased.All in all - The BEST place to get breakfast in HobokenAll portions are sized just right to leave you satisfied but not full",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

And what I heard is that they ofter run out by around noon.  So come early.It was a mission, we got there just at 10am, found parking in a jiffy (beauty of being up early).  But the place was already packed for their first seating.  We were first on the waiting list.  Tips: make sure you put your name down on the wait list immediately.  We only waited 30 minutes.  And with their cafe con leche, it didn't seem to be 30 minutes.Got the bar seating, and saw rows of french toast from other tables.  I have to admit I was a bit skeptical at that point, afraid that it has become too much of a hype and mass production.Moment of truth, the french toast didn't disappoint.  The strawberry cream cheese filling was super creamy and sweet, the cereal crust adds a nice crunch and the guava syrup was a great substitute from the regular maple syrup.  Thank you for maintaining your quality.  The other item we got was the breakfast sandwich, omelet + avocado + bacon + red onions.  Simple and light, just how I like my breakfast.I will definitely miss you La Isla.",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

When you walk past it, you may not think much of it, but trust me, it's worth a visit! My favorite dish from here is the Pollo a la Ajillo con Espinaca. This HUGE piece of chicken is so tasty and I absolutely love the garlic sauce it is served in. Their boiled yuca and black beans are my favorite sides. I would also recommend the Ropa Vieja and Tasajo Con Boniato for entrees.Why not 5 stars, as I would usually give to one of my absolute favorite restaurants? Well, we finally tried their famous brunch today. My boyfriend got the stuffed French toast and loved it. I got the la papa and was very disappointed. The ""melted Swiss cheese"" on top was like a hard, tough plastic. I honestly didn't even know it was cheese at first.

497,Axw9FwbTQpRxQ1R7kQ6-1w,Dan B.,5.0 star rating,"Fantastic breakfast/brunch. A number of omelette options (chorizo/onion/cheese, plantain/spinach/cheese (A+), create your own), French toast (back to this in a second), and pancakes make sure that everyone's tastes will be met. The menu isn't large, but what it lacks in quantity it more than makes up in terms of quality, as selecting among all of the options is not an easy task.In my trips to La Isla, I have had the first two omelettes that I mentioned above, as well as Omar's Stuffed French Toast. The French toast deserves the capital letter s - it was featured on Food Network for good reason. It is probably over 1,000 calories, but they're all worth it, and you get your monies (figuratively and literally) worth. The omelettes are served with flavorful homefries - not crispy, but not limp/mushy - and toast. The offerings are all under $10, so like I said above, you'll do fine by your wallet with whatever you choose.If you said ""I'd like a coffee,"" you will get a large cup of espresso roast w/ streamed milk - at first I was not sure that I would be OK with this interpretation, but after trying it, I am totally on board. Pretty sweet, and extremely rich, and a nice complement to the meal regardless of what you choose.The restaurant itself is rather small/narrow, so dining here when outdoor seating is not an option can lead to a bit of a wait. The only other drawback is that there is usually only 1 or MAYBE 2 members of the waitstaff serving the patrons that are seated at tables (there is a diner bar as well). This can lead to a bit of a wait in between the time that you sit/order/get your food. If possible, I would order everything at once when the waiter/waitress arrives to ensure that you'll get your meal on a timely basis. This isn't a major drawback - and isn't always the case - so no need to dock an absolutely delicious restaurant on this.",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

My mail meal was the shrimp in the wine sauce called, Camarones al Ajillo- It was great!! Super flavourful and the shrimp were not over cooked nor baby size... perfect amount of food.

Again this is a personal review- I am not a person who minds a crowded small joint which this is, I don't get offended by rude waitresses which this place can have at times.

But you should expect something that will hit that sweet spot in your gut somewhere between delicious and stopping your heart. From beans to brunch, Castro to Coke, every option on the menu is to be appreciated. I went in search of a Cuban sandwich. I found it. It was delicious. I ate at the crowded counter at elbow's touch with my confused but delighted parents. I enjoyed every bite for every minute of the consumption process. What followed on the path were my fried plantains, my Cubano coffee and water. It was one of the best Cuban sandwiches I've had in NYC. The coffee was also pretty good, but not particularly distinguished beyond not being as bad as typical diner coffee. While not as difficult to get into as Cuba itself, there's going to be a bit of a wait especially on those weekends. Once you're seated the service is surprisingly swift, at least at the counter. I think it's somewhat unfortunate that the slothful brunching crowd dwells a little too long in the space but yet is still curiously cranky about the lengthy wait for a table. Oh, you tourists!

We ordered the cuban sandwich and an amazing cereal-crusted french toast that was stuffed with guava cream cheese and strawberries. Even though it was very crowded, the service was impeccable and as far as prices go, this is one of the most affordable restaurants in Hoboken.

It was incredibly decadent and very pastry like! My friend and I chose to split this (since it was more like a dessert than a breakfast!) and we also split the egg sandwich (scrambled eggs, avocado, fresh tomato, onions and bacon). You cannot go wrong here! We each also got an iced coffee that was delicious, and came in to-go containers that we got to walk around town with since we didn't finish them during breakfast.  Only reason La Isla stays 4 stars is the service. We had to get our own silverware when the food was brought out, and our waters were never refilled. LOVE the food though. Highly recommending for any time of day!4/11/11:YUM! I normally eat Cuban at Cuban Pete's in Montclair, and La Isla gives them a run for their money!! My cousin and I managed to get the last 2 seats in the house on Saturday night for dinner and we were starving. Lucky for us, their portions were huge and the flavor was in your FACE!I got the shrimp in garlic white wine sauce with yellow rice and pigeon peas, and a side of double fried plantains and it was absolutely excellent! There was not one grain of rice left on my plate, and then I started picking at my cousins delicious shredded beef over white rice and beans. I think I could live off their rice and beans. Absolutely wonderful!I can't wait to go back and try the stuffed french toast I hear so much about! Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that they couldn't keep up with how fast I was drinking water, and it was chilly because the door was kept open (and we were the very first table so we were a little cold).",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

This one was bland with no depth I had to add salt to the Bacalao just to get some of the flavor out if it. I don't remember when was the last time I had to add salt to a salty fish like Cod. The rice this time was plain but cooked well. I also had to add some salt and let me say I am not a salt person. It was just missing in my meal this time around. I would give this experience a 3 but being that I have been coming for some time now and have enjoy the food in the past, I am going with a 4.  This place is a BYOB but this time around we just went to one of the many local places for a beer after.

551,C1OpmrRVVelZbA8objhvhw,Jared C.,3.0 star rating,"La Isla just has a good feel to it. The vibe is right on, with friendly staff and good music. I'm not the biggest fan of Washington Avenue in Hoboken, but this is welcome respite.Another charm (read: perk for cheapsters) is that they serve no alcohol, but let you bring in whatever you like from outside. Grab a six-pack and take a seat somewhere in the restaurant that is divided between tables on one side (mostly seating only 2) and the long bar with stools on the other.The ceviche de camarones ($8.50) tempted me off the appetizer list, but was ultimately a little dull. The onion-cilantro-lime mixture was not heavy enough on the lime or something, and the shrimps were a little chewy for my liking.The sandwiches are well-priced, but downright boring unfortunately. I have said this before, but a Cuban sandwich is not rocket science, and is either good of bad. The Cubano here ($6.50) is the latter. No sauce, no pickle taste, thoroughly dry. Also dry is the choripan ($6), which comes with rubbery chorizo and a bed of little crisps which actually provide most of the taste.The entrees section of the menu is possibly trying to shine too brightly, or maybe it is just my general distaste for all things fancy. The pechuga rellena ($17) is certainly interesting, but doesn't live up to it's artful design and price, which would also put it out of reach for this blog's purposes.Hmmm.... I have not said much that is nice here. But I leave the restaurant very happy, and that is key.

She had the special, braised beef topped with onions and served with rice and black beans, I had the tasajo con boniato (sp?) - braised shredded beef served with rice and cuban sweet potato. Both dishes were authentic and delicious. I had a mere bite of hers, but the beef has a nice char broiled crunch and a great flavor. My dish was the definition of complete - separately the components were good but the sum of the parts made one fantastic bite. The beef in my dish was a bit salty (and I love me some salt) and the cuban sweet potato was REALLY starchy, but together on a fork with rice and some black beans was one of the best bites of Latino food I have ever had.  The service was quick, attentive enough and friendly and the place is BYOB, you cant beat that.

Brunch: Stuffed French toast is OK.  I've had better.  Both times I've had it, the crust was too chewy and not as crispy as what I wanted it to be.  The sauce was good, but after a couple of bites, the whole thing was really too sweet. Others in my group got the skirt steak and it was ""just ok""- kind of bland.  We left feeling slightly used and full from mediocrity.   Dinner: On a whim, we came here for v-day, hoping that the restaurant could redeem itself.  I  made the mistake of ordering their valentine's day special 0 filet mignon, mashed potatoes, and grilled shimp.  MY MISTAKE to order something that outside of the Cuban specialty.  I should have known better.  (still don't know what I was thinking!) Everything was unseasoned, the mashed potatoes tasted like soap, the shrimp smelled ""fishy"", and the steak was severely undercooked.  I actually spit out my food into my napkin.  It was that bad. I ended up sharing my husband's entree- the garlic chicken.  The chicken was a little dry, but the sauce was pretty good.  It was buttery and garlic-y.  It comes second to the beef dishes that we've ordered here in the past.   Sorry La Isla.  I want to like you, but I can't get that taste of the soapy mashed potatoes or undercooked meat out of my mind.  Even your famous french toast can't make up for the horrible Valentine's Day dinner  I experienced.",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

This $7 sandwich is perfectly portioned and practically melts in your mouth. I like La Isla's menu for its range of pricing - you can always order sandwiches at dinner if you're not feeling a full-blown entree.Other perks: the drink options. This is a BYO, so you can always bring along your favorite bottle. And if you are a coffee fan, the cafe con leche is (dare I say it?) the best coffee in Hoboken.

I fully recognize the place looks kind of dumpy when you first enter the door, but do not be deterred. Actually, while we are still at the door, make sure you SIGN IN for a table. The last time I was there some people tried to sit down before us that had not signed in...any how, the wait staff regulated, which was much appreciated (line cutters drive me insane).The first time I was here I had the garlic shrimp dish with the rice/beans combo and the plaintains. Delicious, though I think if I were to get the shrimp again, I would opt for the tomato-based version (I like things a little spicier). One of my dining mates on my first trip to La Isla got the broiled yucca as a side...I tried it, and I was hooked. It is my ""go to"" side now. It's heartier than a potato, and definitely way more delicious.I've since sampled their empanadas, which are delicious as well (beef was far tastier than the chicken). Their cuban sandwich was the first I'd ever had, and while it normally wouldn't be my thing, it was straight up awesome.Service isn't super warm, but they're very efficient (I once ordered lunch with a friend and no joke, we got our food in about 1.5 minutes...granted, we got sandwiches, which they may have been making in mass quantities). While I appreciate a friendly waiter/waitress, I go to dinner to enjoy the company of those I go with, not to make friends with my server. Thus, I can't really complain about the service here.Basically, in a nutshell, ignore the lack of ambience (hell, bring a couple bottles of wine - it's BYOB - and then the cramped setup/lack of decor won't matter anyway) and go to La Isla to enjoy an affordably priced flavor adventure.",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

We got here at about 9:45 on a Saturday morning and only had to wait about 20 minutes.It took everything I had to order the french toast. Sure it looked delicious, sure it tasted amazing but everything else looked equally impressive. The french toast itself was absolutely decadent. Crispy on the outside with a strawberry/guava cream cheese filling, this is what stuffed french toast should be. I also concur with what others have said about the cafe con leche, it's cheap and delicioso. What I really wanted to order though was the Huevos Rancheros (estilo cubano). A poached egg nestled in a tostada shell covered in ranchero sauce and surrounded by black beans, this dish looked great. It was also what most of the locals were ordering so I'm sure it's fantastic.Unfortunately (and fortunately) I had to get the stuffed french toast.

I've tried the beef stew, the roasted chicken and the shredded flank steak. I've liked them all. The meats are juicy and succulent and the rice and beans are very flavorful. The ambiance is nice: it is a small cozy place. A little like a dinner where you can sit at the bar or in one of five tables. Always crowded and busy and rarely a long wait.

I have been walking by this dingy looking diner for over 10 years and never gave it a second glance.

This dish must have 10,000 calories in it. Yes, it is DELISH but it's hard to ignore the fact it is stuffed with strawberry and guava cream cheese and it crunches as if it was deep fat fried, then topped with a dark red sauce and powdered sugar. I probably don't need to eat again for another week.If you sit at the counter, service is very fast and attentive. Freshly squeezed OJ, their version of cappuccino (coffee with whipped cream squirted on top) and they do serve free water on the house. The menu looks super yummy so I will going back to try other, healthier dishes someday soon.Very narrow place so they have a sign ""no strollers allowed due to space restrictions"" so in other words, not really a place to bring your kiddies unless they can sit up on their own at a table without a booster chair (didn't see any of those, not that I need one)",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

The little chunks of avocado balanced out the sharp pungency of the blue cheese which complimented to sweetness of the juicy, ripe mango. It was also the perfect size to share between two people. For our main course we went with the Croqueta Preperada which we, once again, shared. The bread was flaky and buttery, and the pickles added a sweet, tartness to the ham and cheese. I didn't really notice the mayo, but maybe that's a good thing! Lastly, since it was a day of epic cheating, we finished with one of my all time favorite desserts: Tres. Leches. Cake.

The price was decent. And, the staff was decent. It could have been better if the food wasn't cold and stuffed french toast was made fresh.I ordered Ropa Vieja - Shredded Flank Steak (lunch special menu) for my dinner. Had Maduros (fried yellow plantains) and Moro (mixed black beans and rice). The steak was tasty, Maduros was yummy and Moro was decent. A couple of things I was disappointed with my dish. Moro was lukewarm (Is that expected? I usually have like my food hot). Shredded Flank Steak was cold. Overall, the dish needed some heat temperature wise.My friend had Churrasco con Chimichurri with Tostones con Mojo (twice fried green plantains with garlic sauce) and Pure de Malanga (taro root puree). The steak was perfectly made. I think it was lack seasoning. I had better Chimichurri sauce. I don't think it had enough seasoning or flavor. Victor's Cafe 52 in NYC had better sauce but the steak was terrible. Taro root puree was interesting. I tasted a LOT of butter. First time having Maduros I think. All I can say is interesting. There was no taste. It tasted very insipid. I think Maduros was meant to be eaten with a dish that's saucy.My friend and I shared the stuff french toast. It was yummy and good. I think it would have been better if it was made fresh. Nevertheless, we finished it up.The staff was ok. We were there before the crowd. The place reminded me of a hole in a wall like. There are bar stools and counter and nice tables in the restaurant. There are outside seating too. In all, I wasn't impressed with the place. It was a turn off to get cold food.

Their batidos (fruit milk shakes!) are tasty, and the bread that comes at the start of your meal is warm, buttered, and delicious. Their service is what took off the extra star.  Rather surly woman who failed to bring me my water FOUR TIMES after I asked, failed to bring us an extra bread basket, and barely cracked any friendliness toward our table for the entire meal. I asked how Cuban lattes are different from regular lattes, and she just stared at me like I was stupid and just said ""it's Cuban."" Well... okay then I'll pass.

The place looked packed so I asked how long the wait was for 3. Instead of answering the question, I was directed towards a sign in sheet.  Our party was fourth in line so we decided to wait at the bar and start our wine (La Isla is BYOB). The staff wasn't very attentive as we had to ask for glasses and a bottle opener, and find our own menus.  We waited for roughly a half hour before we were seated outside.  For apps, we ordered a chicken empanada, a stuffed plantain, and a fried bacon/potato hash ball.  The stuffed plantain was my favorite.  The plantain was cooked well and stuffed with ground beef and topped with cheese.  Nice balance of sweet and savory.  For our entrees, I ordered the churrasco (skirt steak) con chimichurri sauce.  The steak was cooked perfect medium rare and retained most of the juices.  You choose 2 sides with an entree so I ordered the fried yucca and yellow rice.  The yucca had a nice light fry batter but I found the yucca to be a little dry. The yellow rice had nice flavor but was slightly undercooked.  My 2 friends very much enjoyed their entrees as well.  One ordered a chicken dish that was in a garlic sauce with spinach.  The chicken was very tender. My other friend ordered a steak topped with caramelized onions.  Note that the entree portions are very generous-none of us could finish.As for table service, that was not very different from our experience at the bar.  We had to get up to get our own condiments, and borrowed the wine opener from the table next to us. Overall, the food was good and I would go back; I still need to try their brunch.  Had the staff been more attentive to our needs, this would have been a 4 star review.",La Isla Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

In between running around the tables, she would stop (and spent ample time) talking to the table in front of us which was clearly close friends/family of the restaurant. Her priority was to handle her friends first rather than paying customers. When we were waiting for change from our bill - it took at least 20 minutes to get it because she was so wrapped up in her friends' conversations and the restaurant was under staffed.

The soup was salty, and the steak sandwich had a peppery taste to it. I asked for no onions and got onions. The steak was rubbery. Maybe an off day, all these glowing reviews. Hoping this was a one time thing, I went back for dinner. Super crowded, but it was a Saturday. If you don't mind, you can sit at the counter. We did. All Spanish staff, but speak English. Food was good, but not great. I cook Spanish food and eat out a lot at Spanish restaurants. So I know when I get OLD tostones (fried green plantains) and I did. I mean see through, oil soaked right through. Their black rice was very good, steak with onions just ok, no flavor. IMO a typical Cuban menu, typical ""Spanish"" cooking styles. Since I mentioned my tostones were not good, I got a free dessert when I ordered it to go. Rice pudding...I love rice pudding like my abuelita used to make, but no dice.

So uncalled for.I lived in Hoboken for years and was regularly in there for cafe con leche (almost every day), lunch, and brunch. They know me in there. Yet, they ignore me. And others I know as well. Matters not whether you're a white boy, a Puerto Rican girl, or anyting in between. A few of the waitresses have this tunnel-vision thing going on. It can be mid-afternoon with only a couple of patrons in there. You walk in to the counter to place an order for a cafe con leche to go--the usual. They walk and look right past you repeatedly, seemingly busy with things. Hey, I don't expect special treatment, but the impression I and others get is that they really don't need the business and don't give a damn. It's not even like they see you, acknowledge you, and ask for a minute. I'd have no problem with that. They simply don't see you at all...they ignore you. I've been completely ignored for 5 minutes or longer when it was slow in there before they've taken my order for a small coffee to go. Ridiculous. I walk out of there half the time feeling like a chump; never again.And when you eventually do order, don't even THINK of asking for anything particular. I don't enjoy pickles, so when I've ordered their croqueta preparada sandwich (which is, for the record, quite good--but is made with pickle slices), I've always requested it without pickles. Half the time, they humored me. I mean really, what does it take to put one together without pickles? Other times, when I returned to my office with it, I then found out that it had pickles (and pickle juice soaking into the bread, so removing the pickles didn't remove the pickle flavor).Recently, I was there with my wife and we were splitting the sandwich along with some appetizers. I ordered it ""without pickles, please"" and made a ""no"" hand gesture. My wife, in Spanish, added, ""Sans pepinillos, por favor""; that's English, Spanish, and hand gestures. Sure enough, the waitress (the surliest one there, of course--her name begins with an M) brings it...with pickles. We called her back to the table and my wife explained calmly and nicely, in Spanish, that we asked for it without them, that I didn't like pickles. Her response? ""I thought he wanted pickles."" I had to order a different sandwich, one that didn't have pickles in it. No apology whatsoever, no ""Let me bring you another one,"" no nothing. What the hell IS that? Not customer service, that's for sure. Not even the response from an intelligent human being. It was a simple, clear request, and was utterly ignored. We've been in there so many times and always tipped well, but it made NO difference. For what it was worth, the tostones (we'd ordered them a thousand times previously) were sopping with oil and greasy as hell, as if the oil wasn't hot enough and they just absorbed it all; totally inedible. No tip this time.They'll never see my money again, and I'm not alone in this.Why have a service-oriented business when service means nothing to you? They're resting on their name/history here, and it's a real shame, as the food's edible enough. Screw 'em. If you want really excellent Latino cuisine in Hoboken, head to Zafra (Willow Avenue) or The Cuban (fairly new, on Washington Street).

After a long wait to get served and another long wait to get our food, we finally received what we ordered. I had cold eggs, cold beans and very greasy potatoes that made me feel like puking.

I would have been a fan of this place if the price point is more in line with my perception of how basic the food served really is, and if the service was better.The place is really small, so it is usually full. Recently, they managed to get some outside space, which increases their space by a third during the summer time. I find the service here to be surly at times. I have stood at the counter waiting for someone to give me eye contact for about 10 minutes so I could order a takeout. I left when no one bothered to help me even when I started to take out cash in my hand (like at a bar!).

The crowded seating may not be for everyone, but I'm sure once you taste the food, all claustrophobic thoughts will escape you. La Isla is one of those places you go and you eat everything you can fit in your stomach and then some! If you try anything while at La Isla try Omar's Stuffed French Toast which was featured on Throwdown with Bobby Flay. The sweetness of the guava/strawberry cream cheese, the crunch of the almonds and the softness of the pullman style egg bread is out of this world. Hands down the best french toast I have ever had! My favorite drink is definitely the Morir Sonando. It may not be the healthiest, but this brunch isn't for those watching their weight! The El Balsero obviously leans more to the Cuban cuisine than the french toast. The El Balsero is an excellent choice with just a little bit of hot sauce. Some advice is to get there early as there is always a line for brunch.
