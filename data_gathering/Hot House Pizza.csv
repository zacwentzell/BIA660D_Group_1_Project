John (who I sincerely hope is not the owner and/or manager as he claimed) was rude, exhibited terrible business practices, and was generally just horrible. We ordered the Monroe Pie ($20.00) with extra mozzarella ($2.00) and extra prosciutto on the right half ($4 00). With tax, delivery fee, and the extra toppings, the order ended up being $34.67. We got a dough-y pizza without extra cheese, with three pieces of prosciutto, and soggy arugula-- picture attached. They must have misunderstood that we wanted EXTRA cheese and EXTRA prosciutto and instead gave us 9 quarter-sized pieces of mozzarella and 3 pieces of prosciutto on half of the pie. When I called and asked for them to remake it or refund us, I spoke with John who quite literally yelled at me. He said that he ""Is not clairvoyant and could not tell that we ordered extra."" I asked him to look at the price of the pie and see that it was $20.00 and then $6.00 extra for toppings. He said he saw that but it didn't say extra so we were out of luck. We could call Grubhub. We called, they gave us a refund on our toppings, my boyfriend ate a piece, said that it was gross, we threw it out, and we ate elsewhere.

For $3 a slice I promise that you will not be disappointed.Hot House offers the cutest back door area that feels like you're walking into someone's secret garden.  Set up with a nice amount of tables this can be your weekday escape.  We all have those days or even weekend nights where we want to go out for drinks but aren't in the mood to make plans or get all dolled up.  Problem solved! Take a walk down 2nd St. with a few friends, stop for some wine/beer, and head over to Hot House and park yourself right in the back area.  I know this will be one of my low key evening spots this Spring/Summer.",Hot House Pizza,3.5 star rating,$,Pizza

Cheese slices ate $3 - Perfectly thin crust with a really thin layer of crisp that turns to nice tender dough when u get thru it. Sauce is great cheese is really great. Very happy. Also got the monroe- arugula and prosciutto- $12 for a small. Very good as well. I was super hesitant about the pre made slices - after walking by so many places downtown with their dry slices sitting out all day. I was VERY pleasantly surprised. After being thrown back in the oven for the perfect amount of time (time enough to make it hot but not too hot and not burnt). Tasted incredibly fresh.
