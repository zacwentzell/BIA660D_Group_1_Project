Just be careful that they do not speak much English, it honestly depends who is working that day. I walked in early morning on a weekend and it was absolutely packed!!! I literally just ordered take out so it was not a problem but WOW insane.So we ordered a few things for just the two of us to try out the restaurant. Great chicken leg with rice and beans, side ordered of chicharron, pulled pork, and chicken noodle soup. Overall food is the expected quality and price of these types of Latin American restaurants. This place is great for breakfast and some fast casual type of food, but this is definitely pay for what you get. Its great prices but its not Michelin star hahaha, still though for a few bucks you can definitely have a good meal. I would definitely stop in again if I was in the area but I would not make a huge effort to visit this establishment.

I've tried a good portion of their menu and everything has been great. Their dishes come with rice (white or yellow and sometimes black) and beans (red or black) with a couple plantains.

I was in Jersey City today and was craving some Chicharron (fried pork skin). I found this place on Yelp and decided to get some take out from here. It's probably for the best that it isn't closer to me because I'd be here every single day...Prices are soooo cheap, I thought it would reflect on the quality of food there, but absolutely not. The Chicharron was on point, super crispy. I normally go to Noches de Columbia by me for that and it costs me a good $6 per order. It was about $3 here. I then got a papaya shake (about $3 as well), a fish filet and pork entree (both about $7), and 4 empanadas ($1.25 each). My total came out to a whopping $25. Whaaaaat?! That would've easily costed me double at another restaurant. On top of that, portions were generous and food was delicious. Can't complain about the service either. They were quite busy running around with the people dining in and people sitting at the counter. I don't speak any Spanish so I ended up just pointing out a bunch of the things I wanted on the menu, probably slowing them down a bit lol.

We find the plantains to be very bland (they might have forgotten to season it).  It was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. - Pollo Asado: GINORMOUS quarter dark meat chicken.  In the picture, it looks like you are getting half a chicken but in reality it is a jumbo chicken leg.  I thought it was turkey leg for a minute because it was so big.  - Filet of Fish: This dish came out a bit cold and not crispy.  It's almost as if someone forgot about this dish and left it sitting out for too long before serving it.  Luckily I was so full from the apps that I ended packing most of it to go anyways.  This was the only disappointing dish.  We couldn't finish most of the chicken and fish dishes because we were so full from the apps.  Definitely great value for the food you get.  All in all, our bill was $28 because we also ordered 2 desserts to go.",Rumba’s Cafe,4.5 star rating,$,Cuban

My favorite: Breakfast; two eggs, home fries, cuban buttered warm bread, bacon or sausage, coffee and orange juice, under $4. A large 2 lbs styrofoam container of freshly made chicken vegetable noodle soup to go for $4.50. A grilled fillet of fish with salad, a dinner plate, for under $8.

The menu is made so each day has different dishes. In addition, it has a breakfast (til noon) menu, a la carte section and sandwiches that's served everyday. I got the pollo asado with black rice and a side of tostones. The chicken was so tender and flavorful! This is a must try. I have my whole family a piece to try and they loved it as well. The black rice was good too. Def pick it over white rice. The tostones were crispy and light. I probably could have used a sauce to dip it in (like mayoketchup). My brother order the churrasco and he also said it was super tender and good. It came on a hot plate and it was sizzling! My parents ordered the chicken sandwich and Cuban sandwich. Which they both enjoyed the previous visit so they had it again. And to top it off...the prices are awesomely cheap! For all that (and a side of fries) it came out to be $30 (excluding tip)! Who can beat that?! I'll definitely be coming back! PS Parking lot is small and not much street parking so heads up on that.

This is the place to go if you're extremely hangry like I was when I strolled in on a rainy Thursday afternoon. My husband and I picked this quaint restaurant based on the good reviews. We walked in during the lunch rush, but there were plenty of empty tables as it seem most people were ordering to-go. The set-up of the restaurant is a bit confusing; we didn't know whether to order at the counter or to wait to be served. We decided to just pick a table and soon after were handed menus. Everything is so inexpensive we could've ordered the entire menu twice! I went with the ropa vieja and tostones with natural orange juice while my hubs ordered a cubano with a mango batido. We also got beef empanadas as an appetizer. The meal was just want I needed to cure my hunger pangs! I pretty much inhaled the food. The tostones were gigantic and oh so tasty. The sauce on the ropa vieja was perfect for dipping my tostones. All of this food cost $19.20 (like what?!)For the food I will give it another shot, but the service was disappointing to say the least. Our waitress was cordial, however she blatantly ignored us after taking our order. She never once checked up to ask how we were enjoying our meal. There were two couples who arrived after us yet were able to leave before us somehow. It took about 20 minutes after consuming our food and me waving the waitress down to get our check. If I were of a different character I could've and should've walked out without paying because of the outright rudeness. To sum up, the food is great and the prices even better. Perhaps I shouldn't complain about the service given the fact that the prices are so low. Then again, it shouldn't cost anything for basic hospitality. Should you try this place out? Absolutely! Hopefully you have a more pleasant experience than me. Buen provecho!",Rumba’s Cafe,4.5 star rating,$,Cuban

I have no idea how they turn a profit with prices like this.I've been going to Rumba's for years (even before their renovation). They offer delicious food and drinks at incredible prices. I prefer ordering their daily specials because you get more bang for your buck (like roasted pork with rice and beans for $5.95). Even when you order from the a la carte menu, you rarely go over $10. Their chicken noodle soup is dirt cheap at $2.25. You can taste it's healing effects!Their breakfasts are seriously delicious. Love the Cuban toast with butter! Can't beat their breakfasts for well under $5!They also have amazing batidos (shakes) that can be made with either milk or water. I personally prefer my batidos with water. You'd think it would thin the drink out but it's still thick and creamy! Perfect if you're lactose intolerant. Their coffee ain't too shabby either, especially if you like it on the stronger side.Although they have several tables, the restaurant is best for groups of 4 or less. Otherwise, you'll need to move some tables around to accommodate your group. They also have a counter, which is perfect for a really quick bite! The atmosphere is comfy, and casual like a diner - a Cuban diner!Parking is available in the back - fits maybe 6 or 7 cars. Street parking is available too!

I would come back on a different day to try their daily options. I hear the breakfast is particularly good so it's worth a shot.I got the baby churrasco and it was simple, cooked & seasoned well but it had nothing memorable to me. And I'd have to say the same for the grilled chicken dish I tasted as well. Maybe I'm not big on Spanish Food and just don't realize it yet, we'll see. The service the night I came was so-so. Our food came out in a decent timeframe, the place had customers but it wasn't packed and there were visibly plenty of servers standing around. However, our main entress came out first without the sides of rice and then we had to ask for lime. Our waitress seemingly forgot and went on to talk to her coworkers and otherwise move onto other things. We ended up having to get up and ask again before our food got cold.Otherwise, like I said, I'd come back again. 3.5 for food, 3 for service.",Rumba’s Cafe,4.5 star rating,$,Cuban

The only excuse is that I fall into a food coma after every visit because I can't get enough of their delicious food. I desperately miss living in walking distance of this place, so anytime i'm in the Heights I snag a few empanadas and a papa rellena for old time sake. I noticed that they started adding lime slices to the already generous portions of chicharron which takes it to the next level. The cubanos and media noche are inexpensive and filling. The daily specials can't be beat and everyone has a favorite. The spare ribs sell out on Sundays, get there early or prepare a second choice. I like that the beans and rice are packed separately for takeout orders, soggy rice makes me cranky. Service is not overly effusive but it is fast and efficient.

It is 5-star food, probably not (depending on your standards) but it's darn good Cuban-fusion comfort food. A heaping plate of rice and beans, tostones (fried plantains) or maduros (ripe and sweet plantains) with chicharron de pollo (fried chicken pieces) will not only give you the ITIS but will make you feel oh-so-good in a way only Latin comfort food can make you feel.

Parking lot out back as well. They offer two menus: daily specials and an a la carte menu. I haven't tried their specials although they do look great.  I always get the bistec empazado (breaded steak) extremely delicious.

I ordered the breaded chicken & got my leftovers for lunch packed and it lasted as dinner and even breakfast the next day. Mango, papaya, vanilla and strawberry shakes taste amazing! Be sure to try a shake! Or, get freshly squeezed orange juice for a lighter feel. Leche flan, cheesecake and tres leches are to die for. The menu given is pretty on point in regards to pricing.

I stopped by to pick up some food about a week back, but I was blown away by the quality and the cheap prices that Rumba's Cafe has to offer. I was oddly craving empanadas and came across this gem on yelp. People were raving about their food, and so I had to try it. Priced at $1 an empanada, you're not gonna find a cheaper price. The quality of the empanda was spot-on. The crunch of the exterior of the empanada was excellently paired with the soft and flavorful insides of the beef empanada. My boyfriend and I also got the pork skins, and papa rellena to go. Everything is so cheap here that it's worth the gamble.

This place is always busy and the customers end up coming back for more. I think that Rumba's strength is the variety of food being prepared.  It changes every  single day. So the dynamic of this place is that you have lunch specials that change everyday. Keep your stomach guessing!Up to this point my favorite is the garbanzo soup. Filling and delicious. I wish they had this every day on the menu. The beef stew with potatoes is also really good. It comes with white rice or yellow rice and black beans. It will keep you full for a long time. If you are into healthy stuff, they have freshly squeezed OJ and a pretty good selection of smoothies. The service is hustling and bustling. The energy seen at this place is contagious.

Rumba cafe has some promising fierce cafe con leche (the type that has you functioning like an awakened sharp production ready genius.)

The best way to describe this coffee is like a perfect functioning fix for your tired brain. In conclusion, the staff are extremely attentive and helpful. Don't search anywhere else for coffee if you are in the JC area. Even a small cup of jolt here is lethally potent.

But as we were about to do a drive by for other eateries, I saw this across the street and immediately Yelped it which sealed the deal. And I also recall that it was highly recommended by a friend.This is not a fancy schmancy establishment. You come in, take a seat and someone will eventually bring you a paper placemat and a menu. The menu wasn't extensive, which is what we like! Made it easier to choose, especially with our hungry bellies. Since it was Viernes (menu was divided based on the day of the week), I had the Filete de Pescado  (filet of fish) with white rice and black beans and a side of maduros. I got it breaded (the other choice was grilled) and it was huge! This filet was practically hanging off the side of the plate. It wasn't very flavorful though--could've probably used a spray of lemon--but it was good nevertheless. I loved the yucca that came with it! That was flavorful. My friend had the Bacalao con patatas which I didn't get to taste but it looked good and she enjoyed it. And we both enjoyed the mango shake.We had planned to order a slice of tres leches but there was no more belly room for the both of us. And I almost ordered a couple of Cuban Tamales once I saw it on the menu, but I slapped my gluttony in the face with regret and asked for the check. All in all, service was satisfactory---she didn't just left us to our own devices after we got our food. The food was delicious, and most importantly: cheap! If I had a third thumb, I'd give it three thumbs up! I just loved these local mom and pop restaurants that's been popping up around Jersey City lately.

154,pVtky9giWrP0WN0SHn3m0Q,Alexa T.,5.0 star rating,"I first tried Rumba's Cafe in high school when my friend introduced me to Cuban food. I recently re-discovered them, and I've been going every week since. It's just so good!They have a rotating menu that varies day to day so make sure to check the website (I use Foursquare - so outdated I know, but they have the menu) to see what they're offering. Note: roasted chicken is not available everyday! But when it is available, make sure to try it! It is delicious, and the price tag is even better! $4.25 will get you rice, beans, a HUGE piece of chicken (thigh and leg), and maduros. The chicken is juicy and perfectly seasoned. Sometimes, it's a tad oily, but that's what makes it good, I guess.My absolute favorite meal they offer is the Pork Chops (available Wednesday and Saturdays). These are AMAZING. You can order it a la carte throughout the week, but on these particular days they serve them with BBQ sauce. HEAVEN! Make sure to get it with the yellow rice. Sometimes, I go on both days and have it twice a week. This only costs me $6.00 and my boyfriend and I always share since the portions are huge. YESSSS to cheap date nights!My favorite thing to get on the menu though is the yellow rice (not available everyday) with the papa rellena. The potato ball is like a fried mashed potato with seasoned beef in the middle. It is the best thing ever, and I love it from here. AND it's only $1.00. If it wasn't so bad for me, I'd eat this everyday.I'm also a fan of their guava and cheese empanadas. Usually, these are made to order, so you'll have to wait. But it's so worth it.Onto breakfast! They have a variety of cheap breakfast items. I usually get the combo that comes with two eggs (I always ask for over easy), ham (I love the ham from here, slightly sweet but yet still salty), bread with butter, and home fries. Oh, and you get orange juice AND coffee. The orange juice tastes like Tang, but oh well, it's good. The coffee though is the best. I love cafe con leche! This is only $3.25 and will keep you full until lunch.Their mango shakes are a steal at $2.00.Their tiramisu is pretty good too.The service is good, but can be spotty at times. There has been 3 occasions where they've forgotten to put in our order though. We ordered a la carte (which we already expected to wait for anyway), but we had to wait an additional 20 minutes on top of the 25 it takes to prepare the food since they forgot to punch it in. They were apologetic though, so that made it better. Most of the time though, it's great, especially since my boyfriend and I don't speak Spanish. They're always accommodating and willing to answer any questions we have.

It's so cheap and the food is delicious!-------------------QUICK TIPS!*Menu rotates daily. Make sure to check out their specials!*Small parking lot in back.*$10 credit card minimum.

It is also byob so a great place to grab  yummy food and drink at a great price . I love the fact that it is byob because most restaurants make their money on the alcohol being they jack up the prices on the drinks to make money . You def get a lot for your buck . I believe the steak dinner I usually get use to be 7$ . And it comes with 2 sides . They also remodeled so it looks beautiful inside !  They raised their prices like a 1$ more but I can't complain.

I must say, the atmosphere is truly cuban (which I love). From the fun decor to the pretty colors and decorations, this place really has it going on. Could use more tables and chairs though... they're soooo popular, thereby causing the place to fill up really quickly. Their money would be well-spent if they expanded their property or even moved to a bigger location all together.   Just a heads-up so you won't be surprised: If you stay there to eat and have leftovers that you want to take home with you, then you WILL BE CHARGED for a box. I went there 2 weeks ago with some relatives and we were charged 25 cents per box (we needed 3). Some restaurants do that and Rumba's is one of them. Not complaining, just letting you know.    Oh and if you speak Spanish, you'll especially love it because the waitresses don't understand much English but even if you don't speak Spanish, it's cool because they do their best to understand you.

My boyfriend and I first went here on a semi-busy Saturday afternoon. While the staff seated us quickly, it took quite a while for our server to even offer us water or provide the menu. It took even longer for her to come back to take our orders, and when she did, she kept on starting conversations with other customers midway through our sentences! I was in the middle of telling her what I wanted when she looked up from her little notebook and began talking to regulars seated across from us. We did not feel catered to at all. We also tried to ask for condiments and sides, but it took 3 waitresses to figure out that we wanted sour cream. Google translate sadly didn't help. The food, however, was enjoyable. We had the chicken chicharonnes and pork asado, both pretty tasty and filling servings. We've had better, but for the price, we can't complain.They also offer queso frito! It's fried cheese and it's not on the menu, but a Nicaraguan friend advised us to get them there (along with sour cream), and we were pleasantly surprised. I believe we paid less than $20 for two entrees and 3 appetizers/sides, top-notch for authentic Cuban food that good. Overall, I probably won't be coming back to eat there. My Nicaraguan friend had only warm, home-y, lovely things to say about this place; not the case if you're not Hispanic. Be warned, my non-Spanish speaking friends!

But I was pleasantly surprised to see that the place was very clean and had quite a few tables. They even had high chairs available.We came here on a Sat morning. Beware -- there's street cleaning on the opposite side of Central Ave from 9-10am if you're coming here for Sat morning breakfast (or breakfast any morning for that matter).The prices here are unreal. I'm not sure how they stay in business while charging so little. The entire bill for 2 families of 4 was $37, including tax! Nuts.Okay, so the food -- it was excellent. There are four different breakfast plates you can get with various options, ranging from $3.25 to $5. And a breakfast plate itself is plenty of food for one person. Yes, that's right. You can get a full meal (including coffee and juice) for no more than $5. We got one with mashed plantains/sausage and another with french fries/bacon. We also got a side order of tamales and stuffed cassava. The breakfast plates are pretty straight forward -- not sure what was ""Cuban"" about them. :) But the side orders were really tasty, especially the stuffed cassava.

Personally, I also love their Cuban style chicken soup, but if you get it, don't be surprised if you find the following: pieces of corn still on the cob, chicken bones, spaghetti noodles, and yucca. Campbell's it is not, but it's damn tasty.No, it's not the best Cuban food I've ever had, but it is certainly up there and it's  less than $10 for a colossal amount of food.

189,xF0_a88357C7H8J0MYvICQ,Daisy G.,4.0 star rating,"Ohhh Rumba, a landmark in JC heights. This is a location you come for the authentically delicious Cuban food. I'll start with the ambiance: cozy, colorful, vibrant decorations and lively music. Sometimes the music is too loud and I have to shout when conversing with my family. It could also be the fact that the noise echoes so when the place is packed and there are simultaneous conversations around you, its difficult to hear the person sitting in front of you. If you're looking for spectacular service, this isn't the place... But thats ok. However, if you come as often as I do (about 2 times a month) you will be warmly welcomed with smiles. Lately i've seen a turnover with their staff so the treatment hasn't been as glamorous. I heard the owner opened a second restaurant and took his best staff there but I haven't confirmed.  Ok so now the food, the reason I come here! Let me just start with saying that the place is extremely affordable, prices cant get any better and the portions are HUUGGGEEE.  I can only speak on two of their dishes which are the chilindron de chivo (goat stew) and chuletas de bbq (bbq pork chops), see pics uploaded. Yes I've been going here for the last couple of years and have only tried these two don't judge me but they're so yummy... The only caveat is they're only served on Saturday. Both are absolutely delicious and leaves you wanting for more... Regardless of feeling stuffed. The chilindron is nice and juicy and tender. It loses credibility in my book when theres a lot of fat on the meat which does happen from time to time here. The sauce has the perfect amount of kick to it. The chops are sweet and delicious. The pigeon pea rice is oh so yummy with red beans on the side. If I finish my entire plate I always have leftover beans and best believe I take them home... Cant let them go to waste! Ohhh lets not forget the mamey mikkshake... SOOO GOOD! I had their fried fish a long time ago and was extremely dissatisfied. Never ordered it again. My biggest issue with the place is there isn't consistency with the food. If I came for the first time on a poor quality day I wouldn't return. Fortunately i know this. Although i get upset every time i get a watery chilindron and vow not to return, the day comes where i crave it again and walk in the restaurant praying for the best.

This discrepancy is that it is cheaper to eat there than picking up food. I have picked up food twice and the price is different than when I am eating there/menu price. The cons of eating there is that the waitresses always seem to forget a part of your order. I think that is understandable because I cannot see myself in a waitressing job since I am forgetful. The food is delicious and I wish my social anxiety didn't get in the way of going there. Also, my English boyfriend approves of Rumba's and cannot wait to come to the US and eat there again! Recently, I went there and the prices seem to have gone up, I think still cheap for two people eating there.",Rumba’s Cafe,4.5 star rating,$,Cuban

201,Yar_yCnaeJsJmkysHVc_iA,Channing T.,5.0 star rating,This place gets a 5 just because of the cost we paid 16 dollars for 4 empanadas and two dinners. And to top it off the food is so good. We had the pernil and the roasted pork. I haven't been so happy for cuban food in a very long time. Whatever they put in the black beans is the top reason you should visit. They are so favorful! This is our new place in Jersey. Thanks Yelp!,Rumba’s Cafe,4.5 star rating,$,Cuban

203,8wYusem8EQJjehBuObvMjg,Jessica L.,5.0 star rating,"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! My boyfriend and I come here ALL the time. They have cheap, quality eats that keep the locals coming back again and again. For $12, you can get a full meal for 2 people WITH leftovers. This place gets really packed pretty quick though so I would recommend getting your food to go. Their menu changes daily but is on a set schedule so you can know what they'll have on any given day. They also have appetizers/small eats, drinks/smoothies/coffee, and a la carte dishes available daily. My FAVORITE dish here is their baby skirt steak with onions and comes with rice, beans, and plantains (almost all their dishes come with rice, beans, and plantains). For only $9 [THEIR MOST EXPENSIVE DISH!] you get a juicy, tender, flavorful steak with more than enough rice and beans to fill you up. Their pork chops and sandwiches are also great choices that never disappoint. Rumba's also offers breakfast - for about $3-4 you get eggs, toast, bacon, orange juice, AND coffee. This place is great for people on a budget. There have been a few things here that weren't my cup of tea (their tripe soup, mango smoothie, fish) but the dishes that really hit the nail on the head and their unbeatable prices keeps Rumba's at the top of my list.",Rumba’s Cafe,4.5 star rating,$,Cuban

205,Zb4c8sWdwFPf0r9YuKQQsw,Shanen L.,3.0 star rating,"My boyfriend and I came here about an hour before closing on a weekday. I was craving Cuban food and was really excited to try this place after I found it on Yelp and read all the rave reviews. We both just ordered Cuban sandwiches, chorizo and some papa rellena. The prices at this place are awesome, and it's a nice little neighborhood spot. All the food tasted good, except that we were both missing pickles in our Cubans. I find the sandwich a little lacking without them. While the food was quick, tasty enough (really liked the papa rellena), and most definitely easy on the wallet (cash-only BTW), I've tasted better Cuban sandwiches, and we both had pretty bad stomach aches the rest of the night. I was trying to decide between 2/3 stars....3 because the prices were fantastic and food wasn't bad, but 2 because of how my stomach felt afterward. I keep wanting to go back and try again, but I'm not sure if I will yet. If I do, I'll be sure to update the review.",Rumba’s Cafe,4.5 star rating,$,Cuban

Give everything a try and finish it off with a coffee and flan.   The baby churasco, their grilled chicken and their ropa vieja are amazing.  I also like their pargo frito.  All plates come with rice and bean and yuca or plantains.  Their yuca is always tender and melts at the sight of your fork.

This place gets extremely packed in the morning, and I feel like the food is just rushed out the kitchen and has been lacking quality lately. The yuppies seem to love Rumba's but I recommend for some real Cuban food dig deeper into Union City.
