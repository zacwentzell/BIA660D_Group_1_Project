I finally made it for lunch. We ordered the famous pollo asado (rotisserie chicken) and lomo saltado (sautéed steak) The food was delicious. Fresh and very tasty. The green sauce was outstanding! One of the best I've ever had. Portions were well sized. Our server was super nice as well. A plus - They have diet Inca Kola! The only downside was that they were out of 1/2 chicken when we went and it was 45 min wait. The price for 1/2 chicken and 2 sides is 10.75. So we had to get a quarter chicken although we wanted 1/2. And pay for an additional side. 6.75 + 3.50. So for same money we got way less chicken. Everything else was great! I can't wait to go back.,El Gordo,4.5 star rating,$$,"Peruvian,, Seafood"

So we ordered the Papas, she came back and said they were out of that as well.  We ended up getting a potato dish that was supposed to be boiled potatoes with 3 different sauces.  It ended up coming smothered in a yellow sauce but was really yummy -- just not as described on the menu.I ordered the Tilapia a la Plancha, my boyfriend ordered the beef stew.  The waitress complimented his decision on the beef stew.A few minutes later she came back asking my boyfriend if trout was okay because they were out of tilapia (I ordered the tilapia).  My boyfriend said yeah, trout was fine.  It came out as a completely different dish.  We ordered the tilapia dish specifically because it was grilled.  The fish that came out was deep fried.  After looking at the menu, what we got was actually the Trucha (we ordered the Tilapia a la Plancha).  The sides and everything were different too.Though we didn't get exactly what we wanted, the things we did get were soooo good!  The waitress was really nice and the place was very clean and vibrant.  I'd go back and recommend it!",El Gordo,4.5 star rating,$$,"Peruvian,, Seafood"

But I ate what was delivered anyway. I thought I was ordering some sort of chicken casserole and green muscle ceviche is what I got. It was insane. Large mussels topped with diced fresh pineapples, purple onion and various picante like vegetables. It was so good even my friend's toddler was begging for more. I could not tell what we ended up actually ordering, but there were 3 entrees, a couple of sides, the ceviche and sweet plantains and a desert we took all the way back to Brooklyn to share with our friends. I can't imagine that there is anything NOT delightful served here.",El Gordo,4.5 star rating,$$,"Peruvian,, Seafood"

59,hsBtzZW9xJ4hBr9ZyhDGBw,Oscarina D.,1.0 star rating,"The food is good and if this was solely on the food then I would give this place 4 stars but a business should be reviewed on all aspects of the customers experience. My experiences here were a solid 1 or 2 star. A few of us went to dine in and the service was ok. It was four of us and when the food came three of us got our entree and the other person had to wait 15 MINUTES! until their food came out.  Mind you no one apologized for the delay. They think this is normal! That is unacceptable. I was not the only one complaining about this, other customers were as well. This establishment needs a lesson or two on customer service and proper etiquette. Their service is not consistent and I honestly won't recommend going here. There are other establishment worth your time and money.I definitely won't be coming back and will be spreading the word to others.",El Gordo,4.5 star rating,$$,"Peruvian,, Seafood"
