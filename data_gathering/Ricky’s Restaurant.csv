3,vO555Uv8nSiSqzqTsgGmNg,J A.,5.0 star rating,We loved the tender pork and chicken (clearly slow cooked to awesomeness) with rice and beans. Real-deal Latin-Carribean. Very friendly staff and feels like a local warm family-owned place. A must-try in the heights. The prices are spot on. Definitely returning.,Ricky’s Restaurant,4.5 star rating,$,"Latin, American"

A one-man shop, this little hole in the wall the only show in town for a cheap delicious lunch. I usually get the roast pork with red beans and rice for $4. Seriously. I've also had the roast chicken legs (which are great)  and the beef empenadas (which are good, but not great). Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",Ricky’s Restaurant,4.5 star rating,$,"Latin, American"
