On the contrary..this place was so horrendous that it has forced me to WARN others. I arrived here at 12:25pm. I figured I could grab something quick at a sushi joint as they are usually pretty fast with service. I ordered BEEF TERIYAKI. It got to be 12:55, still no food, which was completely okay since I understand it's lunch and gets busy. I kindly asked for my food to-go as I was in a rush to get to work. I pay, LEAVE A TIP, and rush out the door.When I go to unpack my food I realize that what I received was something I DID NOT ORDER! It looked and smelled disgusting. I had no idea what it was. When I got a minute, I ran back down to the restaurant (meanwhile I'm also 6 months preggo!!). I go in and I say ""excuse me I was in earlier and my order is incorrect"" the man looks at me puzzled. I go ""I ordered beef teriyaki and I'm not sure what this is"" he then thinks it's in his best interest to berate me in his establishment where others are eating! ""YOU ORDERED DICED BEEF!!!!"" Yelling at me. I go ""No I ordered beef teriyaki"" he then goes ""diced beef, beef teriyaki big difference!!"" UH YEAH YOU THINK?!!!!!! He keeps repeating himself and at this point we are both yelling at each other and I needed to get back to my job! He offers NOTHING, not to correct my order (DON'T YOU THINK THE CUSTOMER KNOWS WHAT THEY ORDERED?!!!!?), not to refund me for the dog food they pawned off on me, not an apology for yelling at me and publicly embarrassing me...NOT A THING!!!!

I ordered off grubhub and my food came one hour after the estimated arrival time. I understand that sometimes restaurants get busy or streets have traffic, but I called Ubu and was concerned when the own restaurant was shocked that my food had not arrived. They had no idea where the delivery person was and instead blamed it on the delivery company they used. I had to call a second time, again no explanation and it was the delivery company's fault. When my food finally came an hour later, there was an item missing and I called Ubu requesting a refund due to this and due to the restaurant having no idea where my food was for the past hour. Instead of siding with the customer, the restaurant yelled at me on the phone when I requested a refund, denied items being missing, and then hung up on me. I had to call grubhub in order to get my refund back and was told by the grubhub representative that the restaurant did not give her an easy time. The restaurant also denied using a delivery company and apparently they had their own delivery guy. Their stories do not even match up.

The spicy lobster roll tasted fresh as well, however, the rice was mushy, not like regular sushi rice at all. The most disappointing, however, was the special Dream 2 roll. The spicy tuna on top did not taste fresh and has a dull red color (also confirm it wasn't the freshest). We didn't finish all the pieces because we didn't want to risk getting sick (we didn't, thankfully).

I'm pretty sure I've never a ""good"" or ""bad"" shumai. I think everyone gets them from the same place. That udon doe... It may have been the most flavorless broth I've ever tasted. The only ""taste"" I got from it was from the oil that also happened to be clearly visible. The meat inside--zero flavor. The broccoli and string beans (really weird in a soup)--zero flavor. I was highly disappointed. Perhaps I will go back and try their sushi, since that's what most reviews are about. Though when it comes to bad reviews, I'm usually a 1 and done.

First...the salads were literally nothing but lettuce and a container of ginger dressing.  No tomato, no cucumber, no carrot.  Just brown lettuce.  We ordered the Oyako-don rice bowl.  It's supposed to come with grilled chicken, stir-fried vegetables, egg, and brown sauce over rice.  I opened the container and it was ground up, rubbery, dry chicken over white rice and nothing else.  Not one single vegetable.  I took a picture and added it to yelp as proof.  I was shocked at how carelessly it was prepared.  We ordered miso soup that came with almost no tofu and no seaweed.  The tuna roll we ordered had almost no fish inside it, and was very loosely rolled so it was falling apart.  Between the carelessness, length of time we waited, and overall poor quality of the food..i wont be eating at Ubu again.",Ubu,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sushi, Bars,, Japanese"

Sometimes I want sushi on a Monday...And I order it.  After a string of Robongi orders, I decided to re-try Ubu, expecting their dinner service to maybe beat out the lunch I had there.  No dice.  The salmon was brown-ish at the edges. Yep, it was so old and bad that it was discolored.  It went in the garbage.  Edamame was slightly frozen but dry but I ate it since I figured that was the only thing on my dinner plate that likely wouldn't get me sick. I figured right but dang, was I still hungry. Not exactly sure what's going on here at Ubu but I would rather order from one of those Chinese/Japanese/Thai/Malaysian/etc places I can't stand than risk a repeat of last night.",Ubu,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sushi, Bars,, Japanese"

Good deals for combos. no lunch specials but the same menu all day. We were able to substitute different sushi rolls in our combos.

The UGLY GIRL roll is the best and I always get it on the side of my meal. They make sushi right in front of you and always bring you piping hot tea, but you have to request it first. The ladies are very nice and accommodating to the point where you feel like you're in a fine dining place. The miso soup is from a dry-powder pouch and isn't that great nor is the salad.

71,oe59oGm_Z0vskCKWkdqHWw,Beth G.,1.0 star rating,"I ordered sushi from Ubu on a Sunday night. I eat sushi on a regular basis and had high hopes for this place. Boy was I disappointed!After I placed the order, I patiently waited a whopping hour and 15 minutes before breaking down and calling back. Whoever answered the phone told me that there was a lot of traffic in Hoboken and their delivery person had left 20 minutes ago. ...I only live a few streets away from Ubu, I don't think ANYTHING takes 20 minutes to get to! Food finally arrived- I asked the delivery guy if it had been a busy night. He responded with ""No, it's actually been kind of slow tonight"". Figures.I had ordered a sushi combo for myself and a sashimi combo for my boyfriend, both of which come with soup and salad. The ""soup"" was a joke, not even 1/4 of the plastic container was filled. All of my sushi rolls had the tiniest sliver of fish in them- all I could taste was rice and seaweed. My boyfriend's dinner was supposed to come with rice on the side which they forgot- at that point I was too annoyed to bother calling back and dealing with them again.Even though the sushi was not expensive, I would much rather pay a little more money and get something that was of decent quality and actually included the sushi I paid for. I will definitely never be going back.",Ubu,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sushi, Bars,, Japanese"
72,bOpcrSXRQivA4pDSWzWPlA,Dayna A.,2.0 star rating,"I came here for the first time a few months ago for a quick relaxed solo lunch. The service was good enough, the food is sufficient and the lunch menu isn't a bad deal (notice the luke warmth). Maybe that time I wasn't really paying attention, too busy reading the New Yorkers stacked by the window. I came back the week after the tsunami in Japan, receiving nasty rushed yet disinterested service (wacky combination, I know). She acted as if a solo diner was too much of a bother, maybe the ring wasn't high enough. Somehow I inextricably tied those two things together---bad service and tragedy. Blame it on my vivid imagination, but I pictured the hostess/waitress/owner sobbing behind closed curtains waiting by the phone for a call from the shoreline that would never actually come. I took rachmones on her (a form of pity for all the kids who didn't grow up with a tough NY Jewish grandmother).  Yep, call me crazy. I really hoped she would pull through the sadness--- even if it was all a machination. Stupidly, and blindly optimistic, I've come back 2-3 times since to the same service. Always curt, always the bum's rush and she gives me a look that's a mixture of dislike and confusion. I think she's just plain mean. Tragedy doesn't make you mean--- and if it does, I won't be patronizing out the storm.",Ubu,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sushi, Bars,, Japanese"

I got an avocado roll, which was awesome, and there was a salad and miso soup, which were okay (the salad dressing was crusty, I couldn't use it). But then, I opened my ""beef teriyaki"" and was absolutely horrified to find that it was just minute steaks (IE philly cheesesteak meat) with onions, and a side of rice, sprinkled with sesame seeds.

The four-person table next to us had their entrees (each ordered their own plate, not sharing) delivered 10-15 minutes apart. When we got our food, we really liked it, but were still really disappointed by the wait. I've also ordered takeout and had the same issue. They said 10 minutes, I gave them 20, the place was nearly empty and my 2 rolls were still not ready. Went home to wait and was back 10 minutes later and still waited another 10 minutes.
