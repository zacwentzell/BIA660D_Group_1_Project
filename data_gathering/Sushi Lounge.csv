But this place gets a poor review because the SERVICE SUCKS! The first time I brought my wall street friend to this place. Needless to say,  these kind of new yorkers don't like time wasted or poor service. INTOLERANT is an understatement! Long story short, after 16 minutes of no one coming up to even take our order, not even a glass of water,  we left WITHOUT eating! The guy has places to be, & nj already sucks because sushi place has servers giggling by the bar & playing on their phones, yet we were waiting for our orders to be taken.The second time, I came with another friend, same story.  The girl servers are immature & probaby don't really care for this job or the customers.  The girls were busy on their phones in customers' plain view & were chatting & laughing by the bar, WHILE SERVICE HAD NOT BEEN RENDERED. Again, we were waiting for someone to even get our order & when someone did,  it was another bout of waiting for the food to be served. Additionally, no one checked whether we needed anything once they brought our OVERDELAYED orders to the table. My friends & I will not be coming back. There are sushi places well deserving of our business. Advice for management: FIRE YOUR INEPT GIRLS/SERVERS and hire people who are serious about their work!

When I walked in, I was greeted by a very friendly hostess & was told to wait a few minutes for the order to be prepared. While I waited, I scoped out the place & noted that it had a very nice intimate vibe to it. Definitely the kind of place you'd come to when you're looking to have a good conversation with friends/family.

5,AdIL-10Cl4rqQs6OpHlBSQ,Alina M.,3.0 star rating,"As of this visit, I have officially been to all three of the Sushi Lounge locations. Overall, I've always liked their food and it's probably slightly above average as far as sushi goes.I made a reservation for four people several weeks in advance to come here for Hudson Restaurant Week. Unfortunately, there was a little bit of a miscommunication/confusion with the other couple and they ended up coming slightly late. The host gave us such an attitude about it, which I certainly did not appreciate. I understand that they were busy and that it's restaurant week, but there were several empty tables from what I could see and there's no reason to treat customers that way.Anyways, moving on to the food. While waiting for the other couple, we ordered the Peppered Tuna appetizer and two carafes of Sake Bella. The tuna was yummy and had a bit of a kick to it with the sauce.The restaurant week menu offered four courses. To start, I had steamed veggie dumplings. The veggies were very flavorful and crunchy, not overcooked at all. This was followed by miso soup, which I think is pretty standard everywhere so no need to comment on that. For the entree, I had a spicy salmon roll and a specialty White Hot roll. The spicy salmon had thick chunks of salmon with spicy sauce, and wasn't the traditional tempura mix which was cool. The White Hot roll was a little too salty for my taste. Dessert was tempura green tea ice cream. Yum!The place itself is super loud and they have a DJ on weekend nights. Personally, I don't think I would want to come here on a double date because you can't even have a normal conversation. I hate having to scream across the table.Overall, a decent experience but I doubt I'll be back here willingly.

We decided to leave as we were both starving and needed food.

I ordered 2 rolls and shumai, through seamless.  My order was $45 and change. There was an error with seamless.  I must have entered the phone number in wrong, idk.  but the delivery never happened.  I called the restaurant and asked them to resend the order (delivery is 2 blocks away).  Being that the order is sushi, I asked that they remake the rolls. Stacey, the manager, gets on the phone and says ""I am going to refund your order, I don't feel comfortable with remaking the rolls since we tried to deliver and you weren't there.""  I politely respond and say, lets save the hassle, you can keep the money, just send the order. Stacey says, no, I'm going to refund the order.  And I say, ""OK, I'll just order them again, whats the difference?""  Stacey's response was ""it has to do with food cost.""  Let me tell you something about food cost Stacey.  It does not cost anywhere near $45 to make 2 sushi rolls and shumai.  You are costing your restaurant MORE MONEY by refunding my $45 than making the sushi rolls again for me.  By you refunding my money, means you lose the sale AND you lose the cost of the rolls you now threw out.  I feel sorry for them. I can't even comprehend how someone like this treats customers.  It makes zero sense.  Very poor management.  They lost a customer, over nothing more than an incompetent manager.  There are plenty of places in Hoboken that make sushi, save yourself the aggravation.",Sushi Lounge,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sushi, Bars"

Once over a year ago and the second time was a couple of weeks ago. Terrible effin sushi. We ordered two bottles of wine so the rest of the night is a bit hazy but I do recall one damn thing: I AM NOT COMING BACK. The food is whack. WHACK I TELL YA. Generally, rolls are easy because they just mash up the fish with a bit of sauce, which takes away any fishy odor... I really couldn't tell what I was eating. The service was whatever. Nothing memorable. The bathroom is quite a trip downstairs. I think Sushi Lounge has solidified Hoboken's fate of having non-authentic pathetic rolls.

I have tried some of their entrees although the Pad Thai and Chicken Teriyaki aren't something I would order again.

Hands down my favorite roll and of course the very unoriginal chocolate lava cake (which restaurant doesn't offer one nowadays) but definitely order it here it's delicious!

The atmosphere felt so cozy - it was a cold Thursday night so the low lights were especially nice (Not too dark at all, unlike some other places where you can't even see the menu).The best part: the chocolate-flavored warm sake! I would go just for this again! This was the Hot Tootsie sake that was a mix of sake with creme de cocoa and grand yarnier (orange-flavor drink). I usually just drink dri ks for the occasion, but I secretly prefer drinking sweeter drinks. If you like sweeter drinks, this is for you! And it was the perfect cold weather drink! I see myself ordering this in the summer too : )My friend and I were debating whether to grab an appetizer, so we went for the cheapest and ordered the shrimp/crab shumai: they were delicious and came with a lot of great dipping sauce, however, the only downside however was that there were only 6 pieces for $6. It was the cheapest though.The sushi selection is great! I love unique, delicious sushi rolls, and this was the perfect list! I ordered the Doubleday roll, which was white tuna, avocado, mango, tuna, spicy salmon, with chopped jalapeño pieces...let me tell you: extremely unique and delicious! My friend ordered one of the specials king crab-based sushi roll with avocado and 2 other kinds of sashimi included as well, and this was actually also really outstanding/satisfying.Lastly, the waitress was extremely nice and attentive! I really felt the great service from her! Thanks for being so friendly : )Overal, would definitely recommend to visit this place as a sushi-must or drinks must.

We like to try a bit of everything and have ordered most of the items on the menu. Our favorites are always the rolls and they are made well and quickly.Service is usually average, nothing exceptional but everyone gets the job done so I can't complain. The decor is nice, since we come in the afternoons, it tends to be more on the quiet side- not sure how busy it gets for dinner. My only complaint is when the DJ comes on, it gets really loud with cheesy music and does not create a comfortable atmosphere. Hence another plus to come in for Happy Hour.

A lot of places in Hoboken have that annoying $2-$3 charge for delivery. Delivery sometimes takes a long time but kinda to be expected. The restaurant itself is kinda small, I prefer the upstairs level. They do offer a decent amount of outside seating as well. Their happy hour deal is pretty sick but keep in mind that it ends at 6:30 (they should extend it to 7 in my opinion). Select appetizers, specialty rolls and wine are all half priced. You really cant go wrong and get a lot for your money. The Totowa Roll has to be my favorite specialty roll they offer but I've tried many and have never been disappointed.

Words cannot describe this dessert. Try it for yourself.  4. A special roll may leave your wallet feeling empty but it won't fill you up. I definitely recommend getting two rolls and maybe an appetizer.   5.

When the server asked for our ids...we werent sure if our id from venezuela was acceptable??? Those who had id drank.

Now we later showed the manager and server his id. He was of age after all.Hey i understand...you have to lay down the law.  Sometimes customers are a pain. My problem was as she walked away she called me a dickface, and then kept complaining out loud to someone i couldn't see ""i mean who goes out without an id etc..."" verbatim not her exact words.

But, it totally hit the spot on a cold day, the chicken was crunchy, the broth salty, with a few noodles at the bottom. I went with the Tokyo roll and it was solid. Not a lot of rice (SCORE) but the roll was filled with loads of cukes and less fish, I do wish it was the other way around.This place doesn't scream authentic at all but, seems like a solid spot for lunch though reflecting back not a lot on the menu rang out to me but, I'd definitely recommend for their killer lunch deals!",Sushi Lounge,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sushi, Bars"

Closer to Chinese food.Boyfriend got combo tempura (you get to pick 2 from shrimp, chicken, or vegetables). Tempura looked kinda weird and super flakey, but tasted more or less alright.A little overpriced too?

95,79nlr0aO9rc6yQp_FXgpaw,Ken L.,1.0 star rating,"From out of town, just moved to the area, and my friend took me here because he said the food was good (the place he said was better was much further away). We walk in and are sat in the bar area at a table, which is fine, except we sat right next to a speaker that was BLARING music from the in-house DJ. I am a DJ myself, and will play my own music so loud it's obnoxious, but the music was so loud in the restaurant, we literally had to yell across the table to each other, and still couldn't hear. There were times the music was actually lowered by the DJ and I got excited thinking he realized it was too loud, but it was only so HE could talk to the staff, then cranked it back up to oblivion again! The waitress comes over and we ordered the house sake and a couple Sapporo beers. My intention is to do a sake bomb with my friends as it's the beginning of our night, and we are at a sushi bar, in the bar, in what seems like a fun late night spot for young professionals. When the drinks finally come, I tell the couple I am with we are doing Sake bombs, and they are both very introverted and were hesitant to do it, but I convinced them with the old ""come on, you only live once."" We set the Sake bombs up, give the table one hit so the sake shots fall into the glasses, it worked like a charm. I notice everything at a bar, as I've been a bartender for 10 years at establishments from high volume clubs to upscale corporate restaurants, and I all of sudden see the manager, some greasy looking unshaved unprofessionally dressed guy, start yelling at a random server to take away all our glasses, and saying stuff like ""these fucking 12 year olds are so fucking immature!"" Keep in mind he is yelling this in a full restaurant, but it's so loud, luckily my friends who already don't want to draw attention to themselves can't hear or see it because they are facing me, not this asshole. I could see the server was nervous over the situation, and I don't blame her, but we then sat there with no glasses and full sake and beers for a good 15 minutes before I had to ask for new ones. My friends none the wiser were just confused, like why did she take our glasses? Maybe they do that here? I kept my mouth shut about the situation to not make my friends feel as uncomfortable as I felt, but it was hostile enough that if I was by myself, I would've just paid for the sake and left. After this issue, the food was over priced and half portioned to what I expected. My friends girlfriend was very disappointed with her Berry Martini, which just tasted like shitty vodka and Razzmatazz liquor, for $14. I drank it for her, because she refused, but it was gross. Server was sweet and cute, but never asked how anything was, just stood on the other side of the room with her arms folded. As I said before, I'm in the industry, so we left a 20% tip on our $130 check (which if I left after the sake, the restaurant would not have made), but nothing about this place made we want to come back. In fact, my experience was so bad, I decided to write a lengthy review on Yelp, FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER! If Sake Bombs at your establishment are so frowned upon, don't make the ambiance of the restaurant a hip Sushi Lounge that draws in young professionals. My friend owns his own business with over 150+weekly clients, his girlfriend works with autistic children at a local school, and I am seasoned head bartender and bar trainer, we are all far from immature 12 years olds, and I'll make sure all my ""immature 12 year old"" friends never ever go back to this place.

The Ugly:The $8/$9 house wine pour is pathetic (your glass literally arrives less than half full) and when I inquired was told that it was an industry standard pour of 4oz!-wrong.  Even if that's correct, the perceived value will cause me not to return.  The contemporary, hip atmosphere is more like a bar than a restaurant and can be loud, thus the name ""Sushi Lounge"".  Not a good first date spot (dark, loud) but a visually appealing decor overall.",Sushi Lounge,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sushi, Bars"

Now getting to the food, we each grabbed one of the Portobello Sliders, which had been Asian-ized throughout by the addition of miso paste.  The mushrooms had been marinaded in miso and balsamic before being grilled and topped with miso mayo, micro greens, cherry tomato and cucumber.  The small slider bun was on the sweeter side, which was a good compliment to the tangy miso.  I also ordered the Godzilla Roll, a hefty mix of tuna, salmon, yellowtail and mango, wrapped with white fish and drizzled with spicy mayonnaise.  My friend had the Totowa Roll, which included spicy tuna, shrimp, avocado and tempura flakes, wrapped in soy paper and topped with both salmon and spicy mayonnaise .  I sampled a piece and found it much more bland than my Godzilla version, which had the sweet inclusion of the mango.  Lastly, we shared the Angry Dragon Roll, which also included mango, as well as fresh king crab and asparagus, topped with eel and avocado, served with a jalapeno mango sauce.  The spicy, savory, and tart sauce really packed a wallop that kept the meal interesting.  Overall, the fish was very fresh, but the rice was overcooked, mushy, and fell apart easily.Sushi Lounge was a good alternative for Japanese cuisine in Hoboken, and I would certainly return.  I just felt like the execution and tradition would be better experienced at a place like Robongi.",Sushi Lounge,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sushi, Bars"

HOWEVER, just like the reviewer below, I bit into a LARGE bone/piece of cartilage in one of my sushi pieces. I am talking a semi-thick needle-y one at least an INCH long. I am glad I realized this in time. Had that bone been in my husband's food, we'd have ended up in the ER because he inhales everything with lightening speed. I really should have complained but I feel so awkward doing so. The waitress was very nice and I didn't want to spoil the night. Now though the service and environment were very good, I have never, in 20 years of eating sushi, encountered a bone of any size, much less this big. If this had been a tiny shard of bone maybe it wouldn't have been a big deal - but this was just plain dangerous and disappointing. I do hope the management takes note and remedies this problem, as I would love to return and I think the chefs are otherwise very adept.",Sushi Lounge,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sushi, Bars"

Started out strong with the Hot Crunch Roll. It was served with some greens and a ginger-garlic miso sauce that really went well with the rolls. For an entree my better half chose the Red Hot combo (Red Hot roll and spicy tuna roll) and I countered with the East to West combo (Totowa roll and California roll).

We loved that they offered Sangria with whiskey .. the spanish-irish twist just screamed sushi bar. Our waitress was quite the character but took really good care of us. We kicked off the meal with what has become one of my fave's compliments of miser Louis R himself ... hunks of octopus, the perfect bite size marinated in lemon and vinegar sitting patiently waiting in a cucumber cup to get devoured. Amazing, can't go wrong here. Another starter, simple yet delicious the seaweed salad. Housed. Since I've gone paleo and training for a fitness comp, white rice is just outta the picture ... no bueno for this waistline. So sashimi it was. 32 chefs selection ... CRUSHEEEEEEEEED. Our waitress made her best attempt to tell us which fish was which but failed ... not like I even remembered anyway, my eyes were on the prize aka protein.

Yes there are lots of fusion dishes and much to choose from but the fish is excellent.If you don't like ""spicy mayo"" like me, just ask your server to let the sushi chef know, and you will get tasty red chili sauce instead - warning - it's spicier than the mayo stuff. SOLID dishes my hubby and I come for over and over are: Yellow tail in yuzu jalapeno, duck crepes, edamame risotto, rock shrimp (sans mayo sub for gyoza sauce), freshly made gyozas (not store bought!), sashimi is excellent, chilean sea bass roll, optimistic roll, birds of paradise - the list goes on and on.

I will say the tables are very close together - I was afraid of elbowing the neighbors to my left and right on the banquet. We ordered edamame, miso soup, a kaiso salad, and a vegetable roll to share. Everything was great and came promptly to the table. We also ordered two bottles of hot sake, which was amazing! I had never had hot sake before, and it was delicious. I forgot to ask the server what brand it was, but I do know that it was their house hot sake. Yum! I recommend a bottle or two on a cold winter evening. The vibe is cool without trying to be too hip. The music is great - a bit loud at times, but it's part of the whole lounge scene of the restaurant.

There were plates of sushi ready for delivery sitting not too far from the leaky ceiling and I would suppose it would be hard for a plate of food to catch a drop or two as it is being moved.Now the REAL kicker... The sushi chefs were right in front of us. I witness one of them take a plate of cooked food, I.e. shrimp tempura, soft shell crabs, etc. that he was waking for to finish some rolls. As he was transferring it to the counter in front of him to finish preparing, one of the shrimp tempuras fell to the ground. The chef bent over, picked it up, held it below the counter for a minute so that no one would see him directly transport the shrimp back to the plate, and then non chalantly, PUT IT BACK ON THE PLATE AND CONTINUE TO MAKE A ROLL WITH IT!I made sure it wasn't my plate, but needless to say, I had a hard time enjoying my meal when it came.

Then when she brought it, the tea was lukewarm and obviously not fresh, so I told her.

I'll only be able to enjoy you for 2 more months before I move to 'the city where the heat is on'! Honestly, my husband and I both agree---best Sushi we've EVER had. We had dinner outside on the patio area on Friday night. We had a quick view of the inside decor, which is really nice! The service was OK... at first our waitress was really attentive but towards the end of our meal she came less and less... and we had to wait what felt like forever until she came to give us the check. But you know what? I'm willing to overlook that... because the Sushi here is bangin'! We shared three rolls... The Bird of Paradise, The Alaskan, and The Optimistic. They were all AMAZING. The sushi is fresh, fresh, fresh. The sauces they give with the Optimistic roll were really delicious. We also had a dessert... the Maui Nachos, which were different...

I am totally game for loud music and crazy lights late at night but at 6:30pm on a Friday after a long day of work I'd prefer to be able to talk to the person across from me. The waitress wasn't attentive and seemed annoyed when we flagged her down to get water/drinks after 15 minutes at our table without help. Undecided on whether I'll go back or not :(",Sushi Lounge,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sushi, Bars"
287,hAPXvWk66fTE3TfyPnG74A,Dolores R.,4.0 star rating,"The best sushi I've had in Hoboken (or New Jersey for that matter) yet. There are some inventive rolls here with non-traditional ingredients like mango (some people consider this a sacriledge; I've embraced the trend of fruit in my sushi and damn it!, I like it), as well as the traditional hand rolls. The sushi is always fresh and well presented. Other menu items like tempura, bento boxes, and udon are standard: not bad, but nothing to write home about either.Sushi Lounge has an ambiance that's less sushi spot and more cocktail lounge. It's dark and slightly clubby, with a slate/grey color theme. The sushi bar also doubles as a bar bar and there are specials most nights of the week (I like Martini Thursdays, where cocktails are 2-for-1). The bartender is actually pretty good, so I always have a cocktail when I'm here, and the wine list is pretty good for NJ, with a variety of reds and whites sold by the glass.On weekends a DJ spins at a small, elevated booth. During the week, the playlist runs the gamut from acid jazz to chilled out house music. When in Hoboken and desiring something a bit more like what you'd find in NYC, Sushi Lounge is a good bet.",Sushi Lounge,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sushi, Bars"

I got 4 special rolls, all of which tasted like nothing.  Extremely disappointing and a waste of money!  Do not waste your time at this place!",Sushi Lounge,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sushi, Bars"

293,R4ubPY5OnXrDY_D2-GEISA,Lindsay B.,3.0 star rating,"Food was good. Music was too loud. Not sure you need a DJ playing for the later dinner crowd. As for the service, our waitress, Leslie, never checked back after our food was delivered, could only attend to one tables needs at a time and was too busy talking to customers sitting at the bar for half the time we were there. Getting the check took a solid twenty minutes after our table was cleared of our empty plates.
