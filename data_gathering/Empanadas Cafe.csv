1,vwHfUuIMCAmSoYmRDfDBIQ,Selena Y.,3.0 star rating,"Not bad but not amazing empanadas either. I was attracted by the ""buy 2 empanadas get 1 coffee free special"" going on, which seemed like a decent deal for a ~$7 snack. Unfortunately the empanadas fell short for me, mostly due to their temperatures. I tried 4 of the empanadas (Buenos Aires, Hoboken, Spicy Chicken, and Spicy Beef), and all of them were just briefly warmed. In fact, the center of my Spicy Chicken empanada was still a little cold! I know that some of these empanadas can be made hours before serving, but I'd expect the restaurant to at least heat them back up enough so that they'd taste as ""fresh out of the oven"" as possible.Despite the temperature, the flavors were there and I was impressed with the variety of empanadas to choose from. Out of my four I liked the Spicy Beef filling the best, but as a warning, it was VERY spicy and had more chili peppers in it than expected. If you enjoy spicy though, the Spicy Beef with some added house hot sauce is for you.",Empanadas Cafe,4.5 star rating,$,"Empanadas,, Cafes"

The venue is small, (a few tables inside) but there is also outdoor seating. You can definitely taste the heart, soul and effort used to produce each empanada and it's authenticity. I went ahead and ordered based off the popular empanadas within the past 6 months which were on the menu board (beef, chorizo, chicken and spicy chicken.) Each empanada was cooked perfectly and pipping hot when I got them. What's also great about this place is that they don't skimp out on their portion sizes. Each empanada was roughly the size of my palm! All empanadas that I ordered were delicious, but the two that really stood out to me were the beef and chorizo. The beef was juicy and succulent, (doused with oil in a good way) while you could really taste the nice smoky flavoring of the chorizo. Overall, I really enjoyed my first experience here.

I can stand it in a california roll, however, I don't want to pay an up charge for a cheap filler. The texture was also meh and didn't compliment the flakiness of the crust. Speaking of the crust and deliciousness all together, the chicken empanada was ""slap yo momma"" good. It tasted as if the filling were slow cooked all day. The marriage of warm spices, sweet onion and subtle peppers made my senses sing. Absolutely fabulous and worth the wait. Though the empanadas are premade, you still have to wait 10 minutes (the woman told me 6) for them to be reheated through. I will definitely come again and try possibly the dessert empanada or another protein filled one.",Empanadas Cafe,4.5 star rating,$,"Empanadas,, Cafes"

We tried a few: spicy chicken, spicy chorizo, cuban, crab, spinach, buenos aires, rice and beans, guava, and dulce de leche with bananas. I have a few favorites but overall they were all good. Presentation was very nice and they stamp the empanadas with the name of flavor so you don't have to guess which type you are going to eat. There is nothing worse than ordering a few different kinds of empanadas and then not being able to know which one is what. All the empanadas were served warm. We were able to meet the owner, who is originally from Argentina. He gave us some samples of the sauces they also sale at this establishment: chimmichurri and spicy sauce. Both were delicious so we decided to get a couple of jars to go.

I decided to try this place on a whim after dinner hoping for a good dessert empanada but was pretty disappointed. The vibe inside is cozy but a little stuffy, better ventilation is needed. There is a nice array of empanadas in their window displace. The staff could be a bit more inviting, kind of looked like they didn't want to be there and gave me a vibe that I was bothering them when I ordered. I went with the guave & cream cheese and banana and dulce del leche. It was heated in a makeshift toaster, that really didnt heat my food up. Anyways, there empanadas are a bit different than your typical ones, they are baked. The shell they use are amazing, super crispy but the fullings was cold and basic. There wasn't really anything special about them for the price I paid. I'm used to empanadas from a small Dominician joint for 1$ that is delicious. Paid 11$ for 3 empanadas..

The prices are fair, averaging about $3 each, but you could wolf down quite a few if you're super hungry.  You order at the counter (very nice people, by the way, props), and a few minutes later the empanadas are brought to your table, steamy hot, served on a wooden cutting board with zesty homemade chimichurri sauce and a tangy hot sauce.  The cafe itself is petite, maybe seating about 10-12 inside, perhaps more outside with weather permitting.

I'm glad they stuck to baked empanadas which is the original Argentinian style. The people running the show are very friendly and love to describe each empanada so you can have some background info to make the best choice.Another things that stands out is the red spicy sauce. It is addictive and no extra charge. Finally I know they get their pastries from Las Chicas, a respectable bake shop in NJ.

I'm glad I did too cause it was seriously delicious! The hot sauce is HOTTTT and sooooo tasty! Yes I had a couple hiccups in my visit but the flavor was there!

What makes it for me is the home made hot sauce (I've bought a jar of it, I'm terrible) and the kick to their spicy chicken. But I wouldn't recommend the chorizo, and as someone who is Spanish, I can't bring myself to try a philly cheese steak one for instance. It's a good snack or something to hold you over for later, and it's nice touch that they serve it on a cutting board, but I think their stuffings for their savory empanadas are a little lacking. As for the sweet, the dulce de leches and guava and cheese are both delicious.Either way, check this place out.

The empanada is an ancient food. The restaurant is clean, with elegant and simple decor, and very warm and hospitable service. The dipping sauces are the bomb. Next time, I will buy some for home. The coffee is very delicious, strong, and smooth. Really a perfect dining experience.  And although I enjoy fried empanadas, the Argentinian baked ones are very special and less heavy.

She didn't want to deal with the traffic, and suggested Hoboken instead. I agreed, but was thinking of the parking. Anyway, we decided to meet at a sushi place (I'll comment on that later). After we left the sushi place, we decided to take a walk. There was a crepe shop, bakeries, and some other  enticing venues. We just wanted something to take home and eat the following day. After a lot of walking around, we stumbled on the Empenadas Cafe. There were plenty of empenadas to choose from. I chose three: spicy chicken, spicy chorizo, and the Buenos Aires. My friend got a Philly cheesesteak (this is important. Lol.) and two other empanadas. We walked a little longer, stopped by a geletaria, and then we went our separate ways. I had an hour and a half more driving to do to get home.When I got home, I didn't really want to go to sleep, even though it was kind of late, so I turned on the tv and I did the worst thing possible. I decided to take a little bite out of one of the empanadas. Big mistake! It was delicious and I ended up eating the whole thing. It took a lot of will power for me not to grab another one. I've traveled to a few countries (Argentina being one of them), and I tend to like meat pies like bridies from Scotland, Haitian patties, media Luna's from Argentina, etc. this was definitely in the ""well played, sir"" category. It was so good that I kept on eating even after I started to suspect the empanada contained beef (I try to avoid beef, especially ground beef). I found out the next day that my friend gave me the wrong bag. She had ordered the Philly Cheesesteak empanada (remember earlier when I said this was important?). The Cafe is small, but cozy. You will find people who frequent the joint sitting and peacefully eating empenadas, talking, and having a good time. The place isn't fancy, but it's functional. Im heading up to Boston tomorrow. On the way back, I may just pass through Hoboken.By the way, the next day my brother and my 6 year old niece ate one of my empanadas. Who can say no to her? She's so cute.

They don't have online ordering as of this post so you'll have to take the old fashion approach and call in. I ordered the beef, chorizo and corn empanadas. The beef empanadas were not as delicious as imagined. The meat itself in the beef empanada wasn't bad but the egg included inside the empanada was lacking. I respect the attempt to add to what we expect a traditional empanada to be like but I think it could have done with out. The corn empanada was actually packed with vegetables. For the vegan this one is a win. The corn empanadas from other establishments were usually cream of corn but this one didn't seem to be of that variety. Definitely a must try if you're looking for a meat alternative. Last but, not least there's the chorizo. Well done. This was by far the better of the three empanadas.
