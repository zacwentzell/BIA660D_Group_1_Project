Reservation:*I suggest calling at least a week and a half in advance for a reservation on the weekend.* I called on a Wednesday for a Saturday evening reservation and they had ONLY 1 slot left (way later time than preferred). The party before us was running late so they had to push back our reservation but Tutta Pesca was nice enough to call to let us know so we wouldn't have to wait around!Ambience: Very cozy! We were seated on the second floor dining room (the first floor is the fish market) and was told the third level dining room only holds 14 people.Food:A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. The fish is FRESH. All of the dishes we got were filled with tons of flavor! I loved their Pan Seared Large Scallops Over Fresh Crunchy Garlic Bread appetizer. The sauce was to die for. My family also really enjoyed the ceviche off the specials menu. For entrees we got: Pan Seared Salmon In a Miso Glaze, Octopus, Shrimp, Scallops and Calamari Over Black Squid Ink Linguini Pasta, and a red snapper and orecchiette entree off their specials menu.

7,5aZX8bTiD0k9vR60SG588Q,Alison C.,3.0 star rating,"3.5-starsI had stopped into Tutta Pesca's curbside market shortly after they had opened, and had subsequently heard rave reviews about the cozy restaurant located on the two floors about the shop.  I finally had the chance to make it there for dinner last night.  I was running late when I went to meet my brother and cousins, and apparently, they had been warned by the manager that they typically only hold tables for two hours, but that they would graciously grant us extra time that evening.    I was taken right up to their table, and the server gave me about 2 minutes to get settled before approaching to ask if we were ready to order.  We mentioned that I had just arrived and needed more time.  Apparently, he had tried to take their order several times before I had got there, and he also asked another two times after until we finally agreed.  While our server was very nice, he was certainly persistent...well, when trying to collect our order and payment at least.  When we needed him most - to refill our white wine glasses from the bottle chilling across the tiny room - he had to be summoned. In addition to the regular menu, there was a lengthy list of specials.  My brother and I decided to share the Beet Salad special to start.  The delicious red and golden beets were topped with lightly dressed mixed greens, goat cheese, and toasted, shaved almonds.  The fresh ingredients and robust vinaigrette elevated this traditional salad over others I had tried in the past.  In addition to the beets, I ordered the Simply Grilled Wild Salmon as my entrée.  The substantial filet had an excellent crispy skin and was perfectly salted and seasoned.  However, it had been a bit overcooked, leaving it slightly dry in the center.  The fish was served with my choice of sauce, for which I selected the Champagne variety on the side.  Dipping each forkful into the creamy, white sauce definitely helped add flavor.  I also had to choose my potato preparation, and I had selected the roasted version over mashed or fried.  These speared potato slices were so crusty that they really seemed as if they were just thick fries, rather than the roasted chunks I had pictured.  The accompanying Vegetables du Jour were a tasty blend of spaghetti squash, zucchini, and carrot ribbons that were intertwined into a neat little mound.  Another awkward moment to mention was when we were approached by the server to tell my brother that his requested Halibut special was unavailable.  Apparently, another table had already snatched up the final piece, leaving my brother to replace the fish in his preparation with salmon.  A few minutes after he revised had his order, the server had reappeared to say that he had been mistaken and that my brother was the lucky one who had actually received the remaining filet.  He was thrilled, though later told me that his piece had also been flavorful, but overcooked.  In addition, he was also shocked by the extra crunchy potatoes.In the end, we found the food to be flavorful, but that it could have been better executed, especially given a cost of over $30 for most of the main dishes.  The service also needed to be streamlined.  However, the fish was obviously of a high-quality and very well-presented.  I would definitely like to give the restaurant another shot, but would cross my fingers for better service to bring my rating up from 3.5-stars.",Tutta Pesca,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Italian"

(It was about 10 degrees out, so that wasn't an option either.)Once we got up to the dining area though, I was pleasantly surprised. The space is really intimate and cozy.  I liked it - a great place for a date night.We ordered the calamari for appetizer and for dinner, I had a Halibut special with spinach and potatoes and my husband had another fish special - I can't remember what.  The fish was clearly fresh and it was good, but it wasn't as upscale as I expected it to be.  It was more of a Bonefish Grill experience than a fine dining experience -- if that makes sense.  It was good, it just wasn't what I expected.I will say that it's the kind of place that, on a whim I could see myself feeling like seafood and maybe stopping in.  But, for as difficult as it is to get a reservation, and as expensive as it was, it didn't quite live up to expectation.",Tutta Pesca,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Italian"

I was excited to check out this place after reading good reviews from yelp. But I am disappointed in restaurant's policy and/or management's policy.We, three people, wanted to try some appetizers so decided to order two entrees and one or two appetizers.When we order server said if we share entrees we need to pay sharing fee $10. We asked if we order more appetizers they can waive the fee. The server asked to manager and said NO. We have to order three entrees.This place is pricy and 2 appetizers (average one appetizer: $15-$20) combined are more expensive than entrees. We were so disappointed for no flexibility and attitude of the management. The server explained because they are a small restaurant they made this policy. We ended up order 3 entrees ""2 a whole branzino, and 1 red snapper"" and dessert later. Their food is good especially fish and atmosphere is cozy.

Not to brag (honestly) but I've traveled the world, Italy three times and I must tell you the food was OFF THE CHARTS!!!!!  Super particular about my pasta with clam sauce and theirs KILLED IT!! Just the right amount of an olive /garlic sauce with an delicious twist of added prosciutto which as we know... makes everything just a little bit better! My cousin had the scallops with risotto, her ""go to"" dish and said it was the best she has EVER had!  Etiquette says a lady always leaves something on her plate but we were had  difficulty!

If you are looking for a reservation and the only time left is 9PM-10PM, take it! We have been here three times now and it already feels like home. Not only is the food and atmosphere top notch, but so is the staff. Every time we come here, they make us feel like we've known them for years. Although every staff member is great, Fernando is out go-to guy! If you're a Hobokenite and you haven't given this gem a chance, you're REALLY missing out. And if you do go, some of our favorites to order are the Stuffed Shrimp Wrapped in Prosciutto, Grilled Octopus, the Sesame Crusted Tuna, Squid Ink Pasta, and of course Zuppa di Pesca. Although these are all standard items on the menu, DO NOT look over their specials as they have some really great ones! Last weekends' Lobster special (photo here) was out of this world!

Their dishes tend to vary with the availability with the fish, and if they run out, you won't be able to order it, which also attests to the freshness of the fish they cook. We ordered the stuffed shrimp and the calamari as starters, both of which were quite fresh and well-prepared, particularly the former. For my entree, I ordered the salmon and penne, and the fish was very fresh and came with a hefty portion of pasta in a nicely flavored sauce. We neglected to bring our own bottle, but they give you a menu and phone number of a local winery that delivers very affordable wine within 15 minutes of your order, which is extremely useful.

In addition to the regular menu, there was a lengthy list of specials.  My brother and I decided to share the Beet Salad special to start.  The delicious red and golden beets were topped with lightly dressed mixed greens, goat cheese, and toasted, shaved almonds.  The fresh ingredients and robust vinaigrette elevated this traditional salad over others I had tried in the past.  In addition to the beets, I ordered the Simply Grilled Wild Salmon as my entrée.  The substantial filet had an excellent crispy skin and was perfectly salted and seasoned.  However, it had been a bit overcooked, leaving it slightly dry in the center.  The fish was served with my choice of sauce, for which I selected the Champagne variety on the side.  Dipping each forkful into the creamy, white sauce definitely helped add flavor.  I also had to choose my potato preparation, and I had selected the roasted version over mashed or fried.  These speared potato slices were so crusty that they really seemed as if they were just thick fries, rather than the roasted chunks I had pictured.  The accompanying Vegetables du Jour were a tasty blend of spaghetti squash, zucchini, and carrot ribbons that were intertwined into a neat little mound.  Another awkward moment to mention was when we were approached by the server to tell my brother that his requested Halibut special was unavailable.  Apparently, another table had already snatched up the final piece, leaving my brother to replace the fish in his preparation with salmon.  A few minutes after he revised had his order, the server had reappeared to say that he had been mistaken and that my brother was the lucky one who had actually received the remaining filet.  He was thrilled, though later told me that his piece had also been flavorful, but overcooked.  In addition, he was also shocked by the extra crunchy potatoes.In the end, we found the food to be flavorful, but that it could have been better executed, especially given a cost of over $30 for most of the main dishes.  The service also needed to be streamlined.  However, the fish was obviously of a high-quality and very well-presented.  I would definitely like to give the restaurant another shot, but would cross my fingers for better service to bring my rating up from 3.5-stars.",Tutta Pesca,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Italian"

(It was about 10 degrees out, so that wasn't an option either.)Once we got up to the dining area though, I was pleasantly surprised. The space is really intimate and cozy.  I liked it - a great place for a date night.We ordered the calamari for appetizer and for dinner, I had a Halibut special with spinach and potatoes and my husband had another fish special - I can't remember what.  The fish was clearly fresh and it was good, but it wasn't as upscale as I expected it to be.  It was more of a Bonefish Grill experience than a fine dining experience -- if that makes sense.  It was good, it just wasn't what I expected.I will say that it's the kind of place that, on a whim I could see myself feeling like seafood and maybe stopping in.  But, for as difficult as it is to get a reservation, and as expensive as it was, it didn't quite live up to expectation.",Tutta Pesca,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Italian"

I was excited to check out this place after reading good reviews from yelp. But I am disappointed in restaurant's policy and/or management's policy.We, three people, wanted to try some appetizers so decided to order two entrees and one or two appetizers.When we order server said if we share entrees we need to pay sharing fee $10. We asked if we order more appetizers they can waive the fee. The server asked to manager and said NO. We have to order three entrees.This place is pricy and 2 appetizers (average one appetizer: $15-$20) combined are more expensive than entrees. We were so disappointed for no flexibility and attitude of the management. The server explained because they are a small restaurant they made this policy.

And if you do go, some of our favorites to order are the Stuffed Shrimp Wrapped in Prosciutto, Grilled Octopus, the Sesame Crusted Tuna, Squid Ink Pasta, and of course Zuppa di Pesca.

Their dishes tend to vary with the availability with the fish, and if they run out, you won't be able to order it, which also attests to the freshness of the fish they cook. We ordered the stuffed shrimp and the calamari as starters, both of which were quite fresh and well-prepared, particularly the former. For my entree, I ordered the salmon and penne, and the fish was very fresh and came with a hefty portion of pasta in a nicely flavored sauce. We neglected to bring our own bottle, but they give you a menu and phone number of a local winery that delivers very affordable wine within 15 minutes of your order, which is extremely useful.

This is a (proudly) small restaurant, but the cordial service and tasteful decor help create an ambiance such that you feel cozy, not cramped. The food is second to none it its class; fresh ingredients and a menu that combines both classic and innovative dishes, with generous entree sizes more than justifying the $30-40 average price point. To find seafood of comparable quality and execution, you would likely have to pay more for less at a high end Manhattan restaurant. Even still, I think Tutta Pesca is peerless taken as a whole. When you factor in BYOB, it's actually quite a value.I have only been here once so far, and don't want to disparage any other reviews based on my relatively limited experience. That being said, some of the (very few) sub-4 star ratings for this restaurant acknowledge the merits of the food while taking issue with management policies (e.g., the well advertised policy of not sharing plates given the small size of the restaurant). I find these criticisms baseless and the management courteous. For example, we were called ahead of time to advise that our seating time may be delayed--it was not delayed after all, and we still received a complimentary dessert.

I'm sure it's better for dinner and also great as a fish market, but the lunch items were all really quite bland and uninteresting. I ate a quite unremarkable shrimp po boy sandwich, and my companions had eggs benedict and a lobster roll, both also unremarkable. All in all, the lunch menu seems to feature lots of bread, lots of batter...I'm guessing the rave reviews come from Jerseyfolk who love both of those things. I'm more about getting the ratio between bread and fillings correct, and nailing the seasoning/flavor. So I have no choice but to rate down the brunch menu.Service was *excellent* and atmosphere was lovely, once they turned the music volume down.

The dining room was fairly small but I managed to get a table pretty quick when I went for lunch on Saturday. I recommend starting off with the Oysters and Shrimp Cocktail. They were both fresh and the oysters were clean. For my entrée, I went with the Crab Cake Burger which was an awesome option.

The menu is slightly pricey, but easily justified. I'd much rather pay $25-$30 per plate for something I can't do myself than $15 for some run of the mill BS.Most importantly, this place cares. Mike and Nicole greet every guest with enthusiasm and kindness. This is a cozy spot, and they act like they are welcoming you into their home.

They also take reservations, which is huge.Con's:  because they're a specialty restaurant, there menu isn't very extensive (straightforward seafood and sides), so if you're with a picky eater, or you're not sure if you want seafood-this place isn't for you.  Also, although they take reservations, it's tough to get one (especially with limited hours), so make sure you call ahead.Best seafood in town-bring a bottle of white and make the trip!",Tutta Pesca,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Italian"

The only semi negative comment is the serving sizes for octopus and crab were not the best we've seen. Entrees: my sea food far diavolo was maybe the best I've ever had!

It was a large portion, but not so much that I couldn't finish all the seafood (couldn't finish all the risotto though!). My boyfriend had one of the broiled fish specials. It was perfectly cooked with a delicious sauce, I think made of white wine, garlic, artichokes and capers. Overall a very nice meal and even though we were sitting outside we were well tended to. Another plus side - they are byob, but if you don't have time to get a bottle they have a local liquor store that delivers to them. The restaurant provides a suggested wine list, but when I called and told them what size and kind of wine, the salesperson immediately gave me a couple suggestions with the price.

We have friends who have had two great experiences here so I have no doubt that its possible - just didn't happen for me.We had an early reservation, 6:30pm, place was empty when we got there. We had one initial server and she was lovely but was quickly replaced by a different guy. Second server was enthusiastic but unfortunately, that only goes so far. We brought a bottle of wine, which the first server chilled for us. I ended up refilling our glasses throughout dinner though because no one bothered. Maybe that's what they mean when its BYOB but the restaurants I've been to actually pour it for you.When my tuna came - it was ice cold. Like, I put my fingers on top of it and there was zero warmth to it. In addition, they got the wrong sides. When it was finally returned to me, it still wasn't cooked properly but I was starving. At that point, the restaurant was packed and our server was swamped. (Sidenote: He wore no belt and we could see his underwear all night. This was slightly unappetizing to boot.) Dessert - the homemade cheesecake - took forever, especially considering it was literally in a little refrigerator five feet away, and they super skimped on the berry topping. Price-wise, since we brought our own wine, it was fine. We'll give it another shot because my husband's meal was ok.

Everyone around me had received their appetizers, their dinner & frankly finished dinner before we had even received ours. I do have to admit, the appetizer came out pretty quickly. Unfortunately, we weren't expecting the hour and 15 minute wait for food so we didn't plan accordingly and had to take our food to go. Now when you're paying over $100 for food, you certainly don't want to take it to go and have to reheat it. So overall, that delay really put a damper on our first experience at this place.

63,LbY8IK8AVJ3u-sCX8xgbfw,Lisa T.,4.0 star rating,"Came here mid February on a Saturday night. My husband and I have been waiting to go here and finally we were able to get a reservation. My husband for an appetizer had the lobster bisque which he loved. We shared the Zuppa di Mussels. The Fra Diavolo Sauce was quite tasty in this dish. For the main course I had the Zuppa Di Pesca. It was a HUGE portion! It came over linguini,  but also had an option over spinach as well. The quality of the fish was great, the sauce was not that flavorful though.It was a nice meal, but unfortunately if your a party of 2, you only get 90 minutes to eat. Understandably, it is a small restaurant, but even as my husband was trying to finish his wine, the waiter was asking us to leave (about 3 minutes over our 90 minute allotment). Thankfully we did not order dessert, as I don't think we would have even had ample time to finish dessert itself and truly enjoy it. It seems like they stack many reservations as possible, but being such a small place, they should try to think of the customers they are serving instead of the influx of jamming as many people in there on one evening.",Tutta Pesca,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Italian"

It's now my favorite restaurant in Hoboken (and this is coming from someone who has lived in Hoboken for over 20 years, and has eaten at pretty much every restaurant in town.)The space is on the small side but that's not really a negative.  It's actually quite cozy and with not a ton of tables the attention to the guests is excellent. In fact the service was superb. Abby was our waitress, and although she made it clear up front that she was new and might not know everything about the menu - she was super friendly and attentive and went above and beyond to find out more info when we asked some tough questions.  We also got a chance to meet the owners Nicole and Michael, both were very energetic and eager to engage customers to ask for feedback and to make sure we enjoyed our meal and experience. The food was delicious and very fresh, we had a bunch of clams and oysters to start, and then moved into Halibut and Black Sea bass as the main courses.

This is huge because anyone can make Italian food but it really takes some effort to make something a knockout.It's an intimate environment. Cons: Our reservation was for one time and we didn't get sat until an hour or more later.

The dining room which seats 22 ppl had 12 ppl including ourselves seated. Our waitress was very polite and helpful and spent close to 15 minutes going over the menu. We then spent another 5 minutes reviewing the extensive menu. After putting our appetizer and entree orders in at 5:25 we got our apps at 5:40, at 6 we rcvd our entrees. At 6:20 we were told we had 10 min left to eat our entrees as they needed our table for another party. After spending $100 we were told to get up and leave. We told our waitress to relay to management that we were disappointed and they basically said too bad we told them about the time limit, which they did not. This service is unacceptable. I do not recommend coming here if you want to feel welcome and enjoy your meal. I don't understand how they can implement a 90 minute dining window when 40 minutes of that is just waiting for food to arrive. You can do better tutta pesca, try better, be better, stop misleading customers and saying you alerted them to the time window when you do not and your wait staff confirms this.

Probably my favorite restaurant in Hoboken?  We went last night for the first time and I cannot wait to go back.    We started with the baked clams and the Tutta Pesca Salad.  That salad was just PERFECT (kale with mangos and almonds)... sweet and crunchy but not too sweet and not drenched in dressing!  Oh and baked clams were also great. We then moved on to the main course and we had the pan seared red snapper with garlic mashed potatoes.  YUMMM and we also got the jumbo scallop rissoto with asparagus..

81,6CqQkARaty3Rtwr73a3Qxg,Azy B.,5.0 star rating,"I came to Tutta Pesce, an Italian Seafood restaurant, with a large group of 14 people as a celebratory dinner. I had a great experience here!The restaurant opened 2-3 weeks ago (with a soft launch maybe 6 weeks ago). They were very buttoned up, especially since we were the first large party they had.The service was exquisite--the owner stopped by a few times during the meal to ensure everything was running smoothly (but was unobtrusive). Our waitress, Kim, really was great. She had great recommendations, fantastic banter, and was a total pro. Even the busboys/other servers were on top of their game.The organizer for our party had worked with the owner prior to set a 5-course menu, so I got to sample a few different things:We started with a multigrain salad and sesame seed dressing (with quinoa, kale, nuts, onion, pineapple, etc). I personally hate kale, but the sesame dressing perfectly balanced the bitterness of it. I would come back here again just for this salad! Also, the dressing is homemade.Next, we had the Caribbean salad - which was a delicious, creamy soup with some seafood in it, and roasted potato. We had a course of fried calamari (perfect!), stuffed crab and shrimps (a little salty for me, but texture and flavors were fresh and great), and steamed mussels in a tomato sauce. The mussels are HUGE and wild caught, according to the owner.Next, we had a risotto course with seafood (mussels, calamari). Very good. Risotto was done well, not too creamy, and the seafood is really just outstanding here.For our main course, we had a choice of salmon, striped bass, mahi mahi, or tuna (all grilled). I had the salmon with roasted potatoes and was served with a champagne sauce on the side. (They offered us our choice of 4 sauces for each of the fish, and all were served on the side). Finally, they ended our meal with a variety plate of Italian cookies. Few things to note:* This was a BYOB * I thought this was great for a group, though 14 was too big for the room we were in - we were split into two tables.* They were very accommodating to allergies and special requests. A couple of people at our table were either vegetarian (they were served with a pasta/veggie dish instead), and non-fish eaters were offered a steak. We also had a nut allergy in the group.* Definitely try the multigrain salad with sesame dressing, and the Caribbean soup. Those were outstanding!",Tutta Pesca,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Italian"

They come with a bit of sauce on the plate that really compliments them. For entrees, we did the corvina (a South American fish that I was unfamiliar with) and the red snapper. Really loved the corvina it was a white very meaty fish that came in a caper and artichoke heart sauce. To finish, we had the creme brûlée and panna cotta. Both were delicious but if I had to choose I'd get the creme brûlée again.Our server Kim, was very nice and ran us through the specials in an efficient but friendly and knowledgable way.

It is BYOB, but if you come prepared with your own wine it can be fun! The mussels were enormous on my plate and the sauces were tasty. We were told there are only two cooks in the kitchen and they must receive the entire order at once- the only downside if you are anything like me if you are adventurous and want to shop the menu you can't order the appetizers while you read & decide what you want for dinner.... because the decisions are endless!

I must say, it way out did my expectations and the quality and freshness of the seafood and food in general is absolutely superlative. We ordered the seafood salad made fresh daily which was a large portion and lightly and perfectly dressed and accentuated without overwhelming the fresh seafood. The fried flounder sandwich with fries was among the best I ever had. Every part of that sandwich (fish, breading, lettuce, tomato, bread) was delicious. The fries are double fried (truly French fashion), crispy and delicious. The New England fish chowder looked delicious. I didn't partake, however my husband loved it. The interior was outfitted to resemble Hoboken 50 years ago and I love the decor, ceilings, iron, exposed brick, and natural light. I will be enjoying many more meals here.

97,xKlZpQZoNGECUipYjIAnwQ,C S.,4.0 star rating,"Great addition to the neighborhood. Very nice staff and owner, who told me that all the seafood is wild-caught.  Selection is wide and fresh and pricing is very reasonable at the fish market at ground level. Lunch is a decent deal too. I've only had take out once and it was very good, if a little short on the delicious grilled calamari.  On the other hand, dinner at the restaurant upstairs was disappointing based primarily on the food. The place had a nice atmosphere, tasteful decor and great service, even on a busy evening. Although I'm not sure why our server needed to read all the dozen+ specials off the specials menu word for word. Isn't that why you printed a specials menu? Also way too many items on the main menu IMHO, which is in addition to the already extensive specials menu. It feels like a disconnect with the rest of the place. Portions are larger than they need to be. If you're going for sophisticated, which I'm assuming you are based on the rest of my experience, less would go a lot further than more. As for the food, while the raw seafood it starts with is excellent, accompanying items don't meet the same quality.  For example, my partner had one of the specials which incorporated artichokes of the canned variety that stood out like a sore thumb. The risotto special reminded me of something I might make at home with whatever was left in my pantry. This is not to say it was bad, it was just kind of uninspired and didn't complement the main star of the dish - the grilled jumbo shrimp, which was unfortunately overcooked. They were so kind to try to remedy this, but even the second batch was overcooked and I didn't have the heart to tell them.With the exception of Anthony David's and Amanda's, Hoboken is sorely lacking in sophisticated seafood dining unless you want mediocre surf'n'turf or okay sushi.  Obviously, taste is very subjective, especially according to most of the reviews here. I'm willing to pay for well-executed dishes but I don't feel like Tutta Pesca is there yet considering their prices are comparable to those of the places I mentioned.  I get the sense that they're trying to cover all bases and it is possible to be successful this way.  But I think the most outstanding restaurants know how to focus and refine.",Tutta Pesca,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Italian"

Real simple, no renovation, no pretentiousness. The servers were welcoming and took time explaining items on the menu. They acted like it really mattered that you ordered food you'd be happy with. The oysters were so fresh and succulent. The fried calamari was tender and not greasy. The grilled lobster tails with a scampi sauce were so delicious I wanted to go back the next day. If they weren't closed on Sundays, I may have.  The garlic potatoes and lightly steamed julienned veggies were great. But the tour de force was the creme brulee, better thanany bakery in Paris, no kidding. I was amazed that the server said the cheesecake, baked by the owner's sister, was the best dessert on the menu. How it could beat the creme brulee, I couldn't fathom.

It was easily the freshest fish you will find in the area. From service and decor to the food, everything was impeccable.  I had the pleasure of my mother courting me for a dinner at this fine establishment.  Just an FYI, my mother absolutely hates everything about fish especially the smell, but to her surprise, she had never been so satisfied in her life.  The whole dinner she kept repeating 'can't smell a thing, it must be fresh'.   She did not have a seafood dish, but they have other delicious options for the non-seafood eaters out there.

Dining room is very small, second floor, so you can't get in without a reservation. The size is a plus it gives the time to properly prepare all the dishes we had. We met the entire family owners and they all have the energy and enthusiasm to make this your go to seafood restaurant. And boy do they know their fish!!! The father is in the wholesale fish business for many years and he knew the local fishmongers in Hoboken from 30 years ago. I'm not a food critic so by me telling you the food was great is obviously my opinion, but it was. They told us the menu is evolving they're only open 7 weeks. The specials are in season caught and all menu items are fresh nothing frozen from Acme. It's a BYOB but they have an arrangement with a local liquor store to deliver in if you forget to bring your own.   Give it a try you won't be disappointed.

We've been waiting for it to open for a long time since most of what we have in Hoboken is pizzerias and bars. The food was excellent. We tried crab legs, oysters, swordfish with sambuca sauce and creme brulee. Everything was incredibly fresh (crucial at a seafood place, right?). We met the owner, Mike, who has great relationships with distributors and allows him to have really fresh seafood. It's also BYOB and if you forget to brink alcohol, the restaurant will help you call a liquor store that delivers to TP. Service was excellent too.

122,ksymHToS0Ks8JpwNeXvDHw,Irene S.,2.0 star rating,"My husband and I ate dinner there last night.  Our server seemed pleasant at first. He recommended the grilled octopus appetizer but wouldn't put our order in for it until we decided on our main courses too which we thought kind of odd, especially since we were having a late dinner and it was near closing time. I would think they would want to get started on the app as soon as possible, but no big deal. The grilled octopus was indeed delicious and I would maybe come back just for that. For my dinner, I ordered the Zuppa di Pesca over linguine. The linguine was nice but the lobster, shrimp and clams were so over cooked and so chewy, I was having trouble enjoying my dish. When he came around and asked how everything was, I let him know and he did not offer anything to make it right. I'm not even sure if he let anyone know. It was a $38 dish that was so over cooked and I wasn't offered an alternative or even a cup of coffee on the house. He simply suggested that we write about it on the comment cards they have and that they really appreciate the feedback!! I was a server for years and was in shock by the service and lack of care. We paid our whole bill and left dissatisfied. Bottom line, it's a cute place with potential for good food but horrible customer service.",Tutta Pesca,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Italian"
123,59k1B241KJL9UarMHgAa4g,Meg O.,5.0 star rating,"I had the privilege to stop by last night during one of the restaurant's soft opening evenings with a few friends.  The restaurant is very small, on the second floor above Tutta Pesca's fish market, with little marble tables and a wall of coathooks with little shawls that are apparently for you to borrow if you get chilly--cute.The food was excellent-- between the five of us we had the some great apps--mixed seafood ceviche, scallops with fried basil, baked clams oreganata, oysters Rockefeller and mussels in red sauce--all cooked perfectly.  We are little piggies.  For my main, I had the salmon with Cajun sauce (which was a hearty slightly spicy red sauce), which was cooked well and came with spiralized veggies (it was supposed to come with potatoes but I doubled up on the veggies).  Another one of my fellow diners got swordfish with the same sauce.  The others at the table got a salmon and rigatoni dish with vodka sauce, a mixed seafood pasta with red sauce and linguini, and a creole soup which was a broth soup with a ton of mixed seafood.  We also got a bonus because they accidentally also cooked us an asparagus, clams and shrimp pasta with a light cream sauce and rigatoni which was a great bonus.  Each of them was super tasty (after we dug in like the animals that we are, we thought, hmmm, maybe we should take pictures...but trust, it was good), and, something I am always conscious of, nothing was overseasoned or oversalted which I appreciate as a sign of a quality food and cooking.  We ended our meal by splitting a slice of cheesecake, which is made by an older lady in Hoboken woman who has a knack for whipping up creamy desserts.  I'm not a huge cheesecake fan but it was pretty on point. The servers were attentive and polite, though clearly a tad nervous and still getting their grounding around the dining room and each other and figuring out the rhythm of service.  We met the owner and his wife who were both really nice and wanted candid feedback about the experience-- you can tell they want this to be a great restaurant and congrats, they are on their way!  Only downside is I'm not sure when I'll get to come back because I'm sure it'll be packed for a long time to come :)",Tutta Pesca,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Italian"
124,s0b7ZuuqbzW_rmEfdW55kA,Katie K.,5.0 star rating,"Phenomenal restaurant from ambience to food to service...it's a superb establishment. The menu is revised daily and you are advised that items will sell out throughout the evening. For first dibs, book a 5pm reservation. All of their seafood is fresh and they operate a seafood market on the main floor-restaurant occupies the second and third floors. The third floor is a party room that seats 14 with a private balcony where you can dine privately. We ordered all specials, so likely these dishes aren't served daily, but I recommend the prosciutto-wrapped shrimp stuffed with crab meat, soft shell crab (waiter recommends crispy) and the pan-seared Black Sea bass. Our server, John, was excellent and gave us the restaurant's family history and even a tour of the restaurant. Also, they sell and serve their family olive oil from Italy which is delicious. It is bring your own, but if you don't come with wine in tow, they have a menu from which you can have a bottle of wine delivered as long as you pay the liquor store with a credit card. Also, we were greeted by the owner when we arrived which really made our visit feel like we were entering a family-owned upscale restaurant.

Usually we try to get there a little later in the evening because if you get there too early they do ask you to leave to free up the table.

We actually started out with two different servers, both unsure of who should be covering our table. They ultimately worked this out in front of us (awkward). There were several mix ups with our food.  We were incorrectly served clams when we had ordered mussels as an appetizer. In any other situation this would not be an issue, mistakes happen. However, we didn't realize this at first because we didn't have plates to eat as we were told the restaurant ""ran out"" and that they were being cleaned. This is first time we have ever experienced or heard of a restaurant running out of plates. Additionally, the thought of plates being washed and then immediately used for our food is something we didn't want to think about. After waiting for plates for 10-15 minutes, we noticed the appetizer was incorrect, then we waited longer for our server to return so we could alert them of the mistake. After a few more minutes we were told the entrees we had ordered were already being cooked and it was too late to correct the appetizer - We just went without. My husband was also served the wrong side with his entree. Also, my husband kept getting phone calls from the restaurant durning the meal... very weird. It didn't seem like management cared much about our dinner experience. They sent the server to apologize on their behalf and took a small % off our bill. We were surprised that the management couldn't take a few minutes to speak to us directly and sent the server to convey their personal feelings about all the mishaps. By the end of the meal we couldn't wait to get out of there.",Tutta Pesca,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Italian"

Up the black painted industrial metal steps.  I liked that.  I didn't feel that the place looked worn or just basic.  The decor was great.  We had a nice table by the front window on the 2nd floor dining area.  Upstairs there was a private party.  I think that was the problem.Unfortunately there were a few of the entitled type sitting at a table against the wall.  Two boys about 3yrs of age that had no idea what indoor voice was.  This is not the restaurants problem. However, this is NOT a place for children that are too young to control their hyperactive outbursts. IT's not cute and really ruined the ambiance. My date's food was good. STuffed lobster.  We both had lobster bisque which was truly sublime.  Smooth, creamy, with hint of sweet and no so darned hot you hurt for 3 days later. Excellent.  The fried calmari was ok....not the best...but certainly not the worst.Unfortunately, along with the screaming twins, the music was pumping like a rock concert!  I had to ask my date repeatedly to repeat herself.  And even then I missed every 3rd or 4th word.  AT some point I thought a bunch of people had cleared out as I was feeling relief.  Looked around and there was still a full room.  The difference.  WE no longer needed to scream to talk.  Someone finally turned down the music.Now...the bummer, I had the well recommended Zuppa Di Pesca.  Amazing everyone told.Ummm...no.  unless you like to bounce your shrimp, lobster and crab on the floor in place of a bouncing ball.  It was seriously badly over cooked.  My waiter asked how things were and I said, sadly, the lobster is over cooked.  He truly look devastated.  But he said nothing. IT was awkward, so I turned away and set out to eat my meal. I was going to ask for a replacement but it took a very long time to get our meals.  Then even longer just to get shell crackers.  My date asked for them 3 times. So I left it go as I was tight on time. After I started eating more....I found the shrimp very tough and flavorless, the crab was tough and no flavor.  I've never had tough crab! And the lobster?  I could have been eating those old school erasers.  It was that bad.  Finally, is the tomato sauce really supposed to be poured all over everything?  Ever tried eating lobster and crab covered in red sauce with your hands?  Which, by the way, was wonderful, but, I feel, should only be on the pasta.  I did like the clams, mussels, and shallots.  And I'm not one to like mussels.I'm guessing that the upstairs party messed things up for the staff.  Everyone seemed overwhelmed. Maybe big parties like that could pre-order?Still, with all that said, we plan to go back at lunch and try something less likely to be ruined with overcooking.  OH, and please, turn down the music. It really doesn't work to move people out faster.  Your 90 min. time limit does!And, maybe, you can give my date something on the house.  The meal was expensive and she was treating!",Tutta Pesca,4.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, Italian"

It is family owned and the food, service, and atmosphere are amazing. It's a great place to celebrate a birthday or anniversary (though not with a big group-- they only have like 10 tables)--it's classy, intimate, and is perfect for a special evening. They bring out delicious bread from a local bakery to start and our waiter even offered us more to dip in the leftover sauce from our appetizers since it was so delish. We got the prosciutto wrapped stuffed shrimp and steamed clams to start and then had seafood risotto dishes as our main course. Their scallops are amazing!
