And we could not be happier!We had a group of 45 guests, and were able to reserve the back dining room. Everything about this restaurant is 5 stars. The decor was immaculate. Our food choices were loved by all (french onion burger and avocado toast eggs benedict were the biggest hits). Everything ran smoothly and without a hitch.However, the star of the day was our Event Director, Anne Marie. From the very beginning conversations, to the last minute changes, Anne Marie blew us away. She was meticulous, down to the most minute details.

We walked in and it was a low lit romantic feel the bar was crowed bar the bartender directed us to to hidden seats on the far left side . Mmmm that was perfectly fine being that the diner room was packed because it was a Friday night around 7 o clock I believe . Anyway we settled in and my eye was drawn to a few cocktails that I tried and absolutely loved. The bartender told us that the special was an bacon wrapped filet of some sort and I was sold . My date got the seafood ravioli that was delicious  and we shared calamari for an app to start . Oh so when our meals came out we only mid way done with our calamari and the food runner did not hear us say we wanted it wrapped . The next time he past by us we mention the calamari , of course without making it a big deal and he apologized . Fast forward to the end of our meal while we took down our last sips of round three of cocktails ;the food runner came around and dropped off fresh calamari already packed up to go lol . I thought that was such a kind gesture that was deeply appreciated . It should no chance for my late night munchies lol Long story short I really enjoyed this place , decor and service I'll be back ....",Grand Vin,4.0 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian,, Cocktail, Bars"

I mean, it wasn't awful, but we were expecting something in the same level than the Antique Bakery. Ambience was very cool and the wine list also very nice... but food and service... :(I ordered the Fig and Brie burger, the menu said it came with brioche bun. When the burger arrived it had regular bun, I asked the server, that didn't even know what a brioche was, she went to the kitchen and came back with a roll, saying that they were out of brioche but she could change to the roll... nope. Not even close... by their reaction I asked myself if they ever had brioche before... (at that point she actually looked at me with a ""what are you complaining about? I'm offering you a different bread and you said no."" face)Secondly, it was supposed to be a short rib brisket burger, so I was expecting a couple of slices of yummy, slow cooked brisket. It was actually a regular patty. In this case, I'm not sure if I didn't get the description (like the patty was made of short rib) or if they were out of short rib as well. I didn't ask. I decided to go with ""that was my mistake, I misunderstood the description"".

Food!The one thing I didn't like.. there was not a lot of vegetarian options on the menu. It's 2017 come on! So drinks I got the Frose and my boyfriend got some kind of rose wine! The Frose was kind of expensive I was surprised! So here's the thing for the pasta it comes in half $12 or whole bowls $20. We were getting 2 kinds so of course we wanted half. I asked if there was vegetarian options she said they could do a pasta with veggies and a spicy marinara. Which sounded good to me. Nice that they accomdated me! The waitress never asked if we wanted to half or whole and left quickly so I guessed or hopped it was the half. We didn't find out till we got the check it was the $20 one.

They have different drink specials every night so on this night we got a wine flight, which there were about five different set selections you could choose from, depending on your wine preference. I chose the bold and spicy, and there was not one glass that I didn't like of the three. We started off with the calamari, which, while calamari is pretty standard, had a bit of Cajun spice. It wasn't soggy at all, which can be an issue sometimes with fried calamari. I ordered the daily special of grilled Branzino with asparagus. So good, and such a large portion--it had two pieces of fish and about eight pieces of asparagus and by the end I was stuffed.

12,GRY2acZtI5q4P1KdCWhcUQ,Dave F.,3.0 star rating,"A freshly renovated space; the owners did a really nice job of upgrading a dive bar into a wine bar with a nice ambiance. Came here for an early dinner and while it was mostly empty when we arrived, is was mostly full by the time we left. We partook in some of the happy hour specials, $5 tap wine and $1 oysters, both of which were good. We opted for small plates all around and got a decent mix. Steamed artichoke - never had a steamed artichoke before. It's an interesting experience scraping the flesh off of the leaves. Not sure how to eat it? As your waitress for advice on how to manage it. The artichoke is pleasantly soaked in a rich, beef broth and a garlic aioli to dip. Burrata with Prosciutto - a good dish. The burrata is less melty than I would have liked, but still good. Veal Meatballs with Ricotta - the classic combination of meatballs and ricotta always works. Another good dish. Capellini - this was the most surprising dish of the night. I ended up enjoying it more than I expected to, with a flavorful meat sauce with peas and Prosciutto with a little bit of cream. Total for 4 glasses of wine, the food, and 2 cocktails came to about $150 including tax and tip, making it one of the more expensive places in Hoboken. The food was all good, but nothing outstanding or overly memorable.

Looking at the menu, I knew it would be a good fit for us.While it is not necessarily centrally located to much in Hoboken, the 126 bus from the city got us right near it with a short walk from the stop. It was easily recognizable and was really inviting looking! Very nice decor and cute lights on the outside.Once seated, our waitress was amazing. She was so hands on and helpful in explaining parts of the menu - especially the wine list. We were deciding between bottles, and she suggested we get a carafe of wine to split. It ended up being way more than a bottle of wine in terms of volume and way less in terms of price. So helpful! We split a bunch of things for our meal - the gnocchi, a cheese plate, and the meatballs. We left FULL. The food was really solid and very enjoyable. There was plenty for us two with those three things to share. I would definitely recommend Grand Vin for honestly any occasion in Hoboken.

18,mTrXfM4209GtIFrFiEsP5Q,Victoria X.,3.0 star rating,"Walked past this place plenty of times and was always intrigued by what it looked like on the inside. Finally made plans with a friend and had the chance to dine here one Friday evening. They don't take reservations on weekends so I decided to come at around 9pm to snag a table, hoping the wait wouldn't be long since it's post-dinner rush. Nope, I was wrong. My friends and I waited almost an hour minutes outside since inside was way too packed; good thing it was a mild winter night so standing outside wasn't too intense. What confused me was the time quotes provided by the hostess. First she told me 15 minutes as a party was wrapping up their dinner so I said great, we'll wait outside. After 15 minutes I went back to check and she said it'll be another 15-20 minutes as the party is wrapping up their dinner. After 15-20 minutes I go back and she said another 10-15 minutes because they are setting up out table now. I didn't know it takes 10-15 minutes in order to set up a table. At that point my friends and I were so hungry. We had ample amount of time to look over the menu and ordered as soon as we sat down. Overall the service here is good/standard, and food here is good, and well prepared, but I had to dock two stars for the initial confusion - had the hostess conveyed a better wait time to me I would not be as annoyed as I was that night. I understand as a business you don't want to lose a walk-in customer but quoting a 15 minute wait time that turned nearly into an hour wait time is unacceptable. Perhaps better front staff training is needed in order to ensure business/customer transparency.",Grand Vin,4.0 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian,, Cocktail, Bars"

Looking at the menu, I knew it would be a good fit for us.While it is not necessarily centrally located to much in Hoboken, the 126 bus from the city got us right near it with a short walk from the stop. It was easily recognizable and was really inviting looking! Very nice decor and cute lights on the outside.Once seated, our waitress was amazing. She was so hands on and helpful in explaining parts of the menu - especially the wine list. We were deciding between bottles, and she suggested we get a carafe of wine to split. It ended up being way more than a bottle of wine in terms of volume and way less in terms of price. So helpful! We split a bunch of things for our meal - the gnocchi, a cheese plate, and the meatballs. We left FULL. The food was really solid and very enjoyable. There was plenty for us two with those three things to share. I would definitely recommend Grand Vin for honestly any occasion in Hoboken.

Finally made plans with a friend and had the chance to dine here one Friday evening. They don't take reservations on weekends so I decided to come at around 9pm to snag a table, hoping the wait wouldn't be long since it's post-dinner rush. Nope, I was wrong. My friends and I waited almost an hour minutes outside since inside was way too packed; good thing it was a mild winter night so standing outside wasn't too intense. What confused me was the time quotes provided by the hostess. First she told me 15 minutes as a party was wrapping up their dinner so I said great, we'll wait outside. After 15 minutes I went back to check and she said it'll be another 15-20 minutes as the party is wrapping up their dinner. After 15-20 minutes I go back and she said another 10-15 minutes because they are setting up out table now. I didn't know it takes 10-15 minutes in order to set up a table. At that point my friends and I were so hungry. We had ample amount of time to look over the menu and ordered as soon as we sat down. Overall the service here is good/standard, and food here is good, and well prepared, but I had to dock two stars for the initial confusion - had the hostess conveyed a better wait time to me I would not be as annoyed as I was that night. I understand as a business you don't want to lose a walk-in customer but quoting a 15 minute wait time that turned nearly into an hour wait time is unacceptable. Perhaps better front staff training is needed in order to ensure business/customer transparency.",Grand Vin,4.0 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian,, Cocktail, Bars"

I am so in love with Grand Vin. Halifax is always our go-to place for happy hour, but I am so, so excited to have stumbled upon this place (thanks to Yelp!) We were here for farewell drinks for a work friend, and had a lovely evening.We started out with a bottle of red from Oregon and $1 oysters. The bread here is so good! The oysters weren't the best I've had but then we got the fra diavola pasta special with lobster and clams and we were licking our plates clean. The veal special was OK but the bone marrow was reallyyy good. Crostini was also decent, but I wish we had it with the oysters rather than our entrees. Overall, the food did not disappoint. Towards the end of our meal, our waiter informed us that we had to give up our table for another party who was doing the wine tasting dinner. This was a bit unpleasant but we did walk-in just for happy hour, and we were fine to move. The owner, Dan, went above and beyond to accommodate us and gave us another bottle on the house... plus some shots. Then the live music started, and what started as happy hour at 530pm ended in dinner and wine until 9.Overall, highly highly recommended for happy hour or dinner. What a lovely place!

We had an amazing, long, not-rushed meal, with great drinks, awesome service in a chill environment.The longer: we came here as a walk-in at around 6PM for an early working dinner. We started with wine (extensive wine list and some wine on tap), and my other coworker had a champagne cocktail that she loved. We basically ordered one of everything (we shared a bunch of apps). The complimentary bread is warm and served with a basil olive oil that's super yummy. My favorites: the meat & cheese plate (cheeses especially were SO good), the meatballs, the shrimp oreganata, and the eggplant. The star of the show for me, though, might be the unreal peanut butter cake. What I could live without: the caramel lava cake was okay - the ice cream was good and the center of the cake was good, but the actual cake had a weird texture (spongey flan). The autumn crostinis were cool and seasonal, but we had enough bread with the meat & cheese and the complimentary bread. We so appreciated the ability to sit and eat and chat without being rushed. Our waitress was great, and the bill was really reasonable for 5 apps, 2 desserts & 6 drinks.They have $1 happy hour and wine discounts.

The kale and butternut squash salad came out pretty skimpy and plain. They could have definitely jazzed it up more. There were probably like 4-5 cubes of squash and 2 pecans.. at least throw a little more on there! The waiter also didn't know what vegan meant. I asked if the vinaigrette was vegan and he said he didn't know so he was just gonna put it on the side. Did not offer to find out or offer any alternatives.There is bread served complimentary with olive oil. However the food took FOREVER to come out. Waited at least an hour.

Although he wasn't playing loudly, the space is VERY LOUD for a wine bar. Can you please do something about the noise level?As for the food, the Stuffed Chicken was very tasty although the plate looked like 2 lumps of white on a white plate. The dish needs some green if only for presentation purposes. The Capellini with peas, mushrooms, and prosciutto was excellent. I would have liked another slice of prosciutto but I'd order that dish again in an instant. Didn't know whether we needed to order bread or not. We didn't get any.As befitting their name, the wine list is a very good list for Hoboken, with a wide variety of wine and not just the obvious choices. Well done!

The eggplant parm and veal meatballs are two of my favorite dishes in all of Hoboken. The decor is so well thought out- the rustic wooden panels with lots of greenery, white lights and cute little knickknacks is so different than anywhere else in Hoboken. It's what you would expect from the city or Brooklyn, but fortunately we are lucky to have Grand Vin in Hoboken! Also they have Frose´- enough said.My fiancé and I had our rehearsal dinner here on a Friday night a few weeks ago. I cannot say enough about Anne Marie who coordinated the event for us and thought of every special touch! We only had about 30 people attending and didn't think to bring any decorations or anything, so Anne Marie took care of all the details from fresh flowers on the tables to personalized menus and cute touches. Our guests had never been to Grand Vin before and they raved about the food and how nice the space was. I originally checked out Grand Vin because I know Dan Grey, the owner, so I was curious to see the place and excited to support his new restaurant. He really went above and beyond and works hard to make this a successful restaurant. My fiancé and I discussed a few options for our rehearsal dinner, but my thoughts kept returning to Grand Vin, and I am so glad we settled on it. Dan helped out to make our dinner even more special, and thanks to him and Anne Marie, we had the perfect night!

Everything we tried was spot on - loved the apps teensy bit more than the mains though. The soft shell crab (a special) was crusty, crispy, fresh and perfectly pan fried. I had steamed artichoke for the first time - initially I struggled a bit to find the fleshy portion on the leaves, but once I got the hang, it was fun! The garlic aioli proved to be an excellent creamy companion. The husband got the California Rockfish with broccoli rabe for his main and I got a small portion of the vegetarian pasta in garlic butter sauce. The fish was delicious... the pasta was made fresh and packed with veggies, but they skimped on the sauce so I wasn't too thrilled.

I tried coming for dinner opening weekend, but it was a 2 hour wait!  I came for drinks this past weekend around 10pm and the place was filled with people.  So the atmosphere was a little louder than you'd expect from a ""wine bar.""  The décor is to die for - wired cabinets holding the liquor; gallery wall with art and cool looking mirrors; awesome walls in the bathrooms made of wine crates; a room with ivy and strung lights; etc.  So crazy to think that the guys from GREENROCK put THIS place together.  Completely different in a good way.  On to the drinks: There is wine on tap and Prosecco on tap!  They also have wines not on tap -- the wine selection isn't VERY large as you might expect from a ""wine bar"" but it seems the sommelier really tried finding good options for each varietal offered.  Not everything is available by the glass, but I'm sure everyone can find something they like.  There is a notable list of other spirits too and a couple of house cocktails as well.  There are also brines - beer and wine mixes, which I'm intrigued to try next time around. Come for date night; come for girls night; take your parents when they visit;  come celebrate and engagement or birthday. It's an any occasion type of place. Also, there was live music!  A guy on a guitar that was playing just the right songs for the type of evening I wanted.  And he ended his set with Chicken Fried and Wagon Wheel --- always winners in my book!",Grand Vin,4.0 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian,, Cocktail, Bars"

There is a large bar menu and a decent size food menu. The restaurant is very loud and the first time I went I had good service second time was not as great. Food I've tried/reviews:AppetizersCrab Guacamole: Excellent. A unique spin on traditional guacamole. Had a lot of crab pieces in it. It's a very savory app and big enough to share.Burrata: Very good. Nice presentation, decent for sharing, comes with capicola, prosciutto, tomatoes, olives. Can't go wrong with some fresh burrata so I recommend this appetizer.Entrees:Rigatoni with bacon, chicken, prosciutto, creamy mascarpone cheese sauce: I ordered the full size which was a very large portion. It's a very creamy and heavy dish so just be prepared. Good wintertime dish because of the creamy sauce. Very salty because of the prosciutto. Shrimp with spinach, mozzarella, prosciutto, white wine sauce, broccoli: Decent dish, the shrimps were salty because of the prosciutto and sauce. The broccoli on the side was alright but I think they can come up with a better side for the dish. Maybe like a sautéed broccoli rabe in garlic and oil. Definitely recommend if you're not interested in a meat dish. Dessert:Chipwich: Excellent. Reasonably priced. Two cookies with ice cream in between - doesn't get much better than that!Gran Fin is a good date spot or for an evening out with friends. Definitely make a reservation because it gets very crowded in there.

I'm 5'10"", so not short, and I had to really stretch to get up on the bench and grab onto the very wobbly table to steady myself, this table is a hazard and could use with a step or something from the floor as to not knock over the flower vase. So we ordered 2 glasses of wine and that came to ~ $30, it was a nice Pinot noir, but nothing to write home about and the pours were so small that it felt like quite a rip off. We wanted to order some food, it was about 8:30pm and both the bartender and the server told us that the kitchen was slammed and we'd be better off not ordering food (new restaurant, still working out the kinks). This was disappointing, but we appreciated their honesty. The menu is massive, perhaps too massive and all of the food that did go by us seemed quite heavy on the sauce though, so this may have been for the best in the end. We ordered dessert instead, a red velvet cake and a chocolate cake. Both were basically inedible, cold and were left mostly untouched. I think that they both came from a box or some thing, no way could something so tasteless be made in-house. The space is pretty, I love the strings of lights, the location is super convenient and the servers are helpful and lovely, but the prices and desserts, meh. I'll give them some time to sort their kitchen woes and wine prices out and then try again in a couple of months.

When we got there the place was half empty so I couldn't figure out why the reservations weren't open online.

It took 10 minutes to get seated (no help was around). 15 minutes after that just to meet our waiter and order drinks. And one friend who ordered coffee didn't get his cup until 30 mins after (they said they were brewing some but it doesn't take that long to make coffee). The food was Great however! Sangria was delicious and my pear salad was everything I hoped it was. My friends all liked their meals too.. the pulled pork hash was a hit with us all (we like to share).

I won't fault them for being strict on their champagne pours but maybe they should consider smaller flutes so that a well proportioned cocktail doesn't look so measly? The bartender also took forever to make the drinks and then they would bring them over one by one... for a table of 7. So count on at least 20min for a round of drinks to be made and brought to you.I ordered the Pulled Pork Hash. The pork itself was quite tasty, but there were no visible peppers and onions and I only had 3 little bite-sized chunks of potatoes. How is that hash? The serving of pork was big - so big I took some to go - but I would have preferred a well constructed meal instead of a heap of just pork. My friends had a few variations of the eggs Benedict and really liked them. We will likely return and give this place another shot because we now know how to order drinks the right way and I'll stay away from poorly interpreted menu items because the dinner menu looks great.",Grand Vin,4.0 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian,, Cocktail, Bars"

The service and the atmosphere was great. We got the Burrata appetizer which was a special for the evening and it was amazing. It was so good I wanted to order another. I definitely recommend getting this platter if it is one of the specials.My entree however was below average which is why I am only giving 3 stars. I ordered the capellini with mushrooms, peas, in a meat sauce with a touch of cream. This dish was so salty, way too salty for my taste. There was also no meat in the meat sauce, I think I found 1 tiny piece.

I could have just eaten that as an entree.  Service was a little slow but this is expected from a new restaurant working out its kinks.I came back for a wine tasting event with a friend.  It was well worth the $35 price tag considering the appetizers passed around (calamari included!) and the wine offered. However, the servers disappeared well before the event was supposed to end.All in all, I am thrilled to have a quality Italian restaurant wine/bar in Midtown Hoboken (truly where the best Hoboken restaurants are located) I would return for a special date night or dinner with the girls.  This place gets packed so make reservations or come on weeknights.",Grand Vin,4.0 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian,, Cocktail, Bars"

The main reason was because our waitress was trying to upsell like I've never seen before. It felt like she was a foot-in-the-door vacuum salesperson who made us feel uncomfortable by saying ""no, no, we are okay"" over and over. The first upsell was absolutely absurd. We ordered a $42.00 bottle of Pinot Noir and she recommended a different bottle instead. Okay, fair game, I get it- I then see that the bottle she recommends is $118.00...!! I can understand an upsell from $42 to like $51 but to even recommend a bottle that is $80.00 MORE than the one I ordered is absolutely terrible service/waitressing. As someone who was a server for many years, this is unacceptable.We went in for a bottle of wine and a couple of appetizers, and even after saying that, were read the entire entree menu. We then were told that two appetizers we ordered seemed like not enough and asked if we want to order more. Saying ""no, no, we're okay"" over and over starts ruining the vibe- not to mention is annoying/gives a feeling of guilt. Once we were nearing the end of the meal, our waitress asked us ""Are you going to want dessert or do you want the check?"" Again- making us feel rushed/guilty for ""wasting"" her time- even though it was a Wednesday and the place wasn't packed to the brim or anything/ not to mention the $90.00 check.

I called several days later and asked to speak to the manager and he hasn't returned my call so I'll leave my comments here. It was Tuesday night, we had a reservation for 5 people at 6:30. No issue there. We ordered wine and some appetizers and a few mins after, ordered our entrees. We waited well over an hour for our entrees after having our apps. We began to wonder if they'd forgotten to put in our order. The waiter disappeared for a while and we had to seek him out.Someone else delivered our entrees. Three of us ordered the filet special and while it was cooked as ordered there was no mention of the gravy on the steak. I again had to seek out the server. I asked him if the gravy had wheat in it and he checked with the kitchen and returned and said there was no wheat. I knew better but after waiting for so long I was ready to eat and get home. Who knows when I would have next received my steak had I sent it back. It was terrible salty brown liquid and it did contain wheat. I've been sick for days. Thanks for that.

The wine was great I had a really nice Malbec and my mom had a light and crisp Pino Grigio. I usually hate white wine but I did like that Pino. Unlike most wine bars the food portions were large. Most people that go to wine bars know that food is not the priority, it's more looked at as wine snacks. But at this place that is not the case. I had gnocchi and was stuffed, and trust me I was hungry, I might be small but I can eat. I grew up in an Italian house and this was light and airy gnocchi that was some of the best I have ever enjoyed. My mom had the halibut, I think it was a special and it was cooked beautifully. The server we had, Ariel I think her name was....sorry if that's wrong. Was attentive, friendly and just all around wonderful, she also was knowledgable on the me ur and wine selection. Even in a newly opened place they seem to be getting everything together quickly. All in all I think this will be a Hoboken gem. I think the prices were fair for the quality provided. The environment is warm and welcoming and I look forward to having many more positive experiences here! I will say one appetizer I wish they had was a cheese plate.

Also we ordered 3-4 carafes of wine in addition to food so it's not like we were just sitting around at an empty table. One thing I would like to note is that the guacamole (first course) comes with just a few chips, not enough to finish the guacamole. So we kindly asked for more chips, however the waiter responded as if it was a ridiculous request. Also we were charged for more chips which I felt was petty for a restaurant with such high caliber. Lastly we were a table of four for the dining portion. Two friends joined us for the last half hour as we were wrapping up and didn't eat. When the bill came gratuity was automatically added as we were technically a ""table of 6"".

Unfortunately, Grand Vin could be better.The menu is limited, and in my opinion, overpriced.The outdoor seating looks nice, but the sidewalk is absolutely filthy, making it unappealing. They really should take more care to hose down the area like they do in the city. I've also been there with folks smoking in the outdoor seating area, which I thought was not allowed in sidewalk cafes.Giving it 2 stars for opening in midtown. Could definitely be better if they took efforts to clean up the outside, and having more moderate priced options.",Grand Vin,4.0 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian,, Cocktail, Bars"

The $9 summer salad with goat cheese was tiny with barely any cheese. It should have been bigger and heartier for the price. Also got the baked eggplant appetizer. Again, 2 small pieces of eggplant for $12?? So salty I couldn't even eat it. My husband's dish, stuffed chicken. Again, small and nothing special. Also in a very salty gravy. (FYI, I love salt and put it on pancakes and it was still too salty for me). We ended dinner with an overly sweet chipwich dipped in fake chocolate with fake chocolate drizzle for dessert. This restaurant is pretending to be something it's not. If you want to pay a lot of money for food, make it worthwhile and go to Anthony David's.

When you walk in you feel like you're entering a wine cellar. The strung lights, ivy & wood finishings make for beautiful decor. The wine crate wall paneling is a nice touch as well. All of the servers seem to be pretty knowledgeable of the extensive wines selections which is always helpful. I've dined here for dinner and now they offer brunch. I came for dinner when the restaurant first opened. We ordered the steamed artichoke to start and the salmon off the regular menu in addition to the bronzino off the specials. Everything was very good. Both fish dishes were a bit light being that they only came with sauteed squash so I'd suggest ordering a side. They had a full house on a Saturday night with live entertainment . Service was a little rocky but to be expected with a new place and new staff. I came back this weekend for the new brunch menu and it was awesome! I had the crab cake benedict... Poached eggs, jumbo lump crab cake, topped with hollandaise & thick cut bacon, served with home fries. It was ridiculously good.

We only had 2 menus and asked for another two, to which she snarkily replied ""two isn't enough?"" and then never came back with more! it just felt like she didn't want to be there or have anything to do with us. She poured us wine and then never came back to refill them and when she did begrudgingly check in on us her attitude was very apparent. Luckily we were next to where they kept the communal water ice bucket which are wine was added to, so we ended up serving ourselves. Additionally we ordered a brussell sprouts dish in a cast iron skillet as one of the appetizers. The dish was dropped on our table with no words exchanged. I reached over to grab the dish and immediately burned my hand. Just little things like that marred the experience for us. The food was fine, dry salads, I had the pasta seafood special which I found to be bland, but my girlfriend loved her short rib dish.

Their wine selection is robust and--in Hoboken--only paralleled by Bin 14. This place is much larger, but certainly swanky and intimate enough for a date. The food menu is highly focused on some exceptional, elevated Italian favorites. You won't leave hungry, but try to save room for dessert.

169,mcOSnYem5wNbRx0aoYu8ag,Edward B.,3.0 star rating,We dined with a group of 6 last evening. We are all very experienced diners. The overall service was fair at best and very loud. The food was very good and we sampled a solid variety of starters of artichokes and calamari. The entrees were short ribs/strip steak/sea bass/cappelini and chicken and everyone enjoyed.  The issues and reason for 3 stars along with reasons that will preclude an imminent return are:  It was wine down wends. The only offerings were 2 white wines. What restaurant would not have a red wine choice is puzzling especially since several of us only drink red wine. We ordered truffle fries and we were asked would you like before or with entrée and we indicated with entrée. To our surprise they arrived 15 minutes prior by the runner. It was hard to find waitress but she was difficult to corral. Finally after enjoying the meals we  were excited to enjoy the  chipwich and flourless chocolate cake for desert only to be told they were sold out. We were disappointed especially since 90% of dining room was in midst of dinner and we were early ones to sit. It just seems like these were never available. I don't recall menu stating 20% gratuity for 6 people but will inquire because honestly overall experience did not warrant.

My date and I split the tuna tartar (special), veal meatballs, and baked eggplant for appetizers, then we split the NY strip and Hoboken Shrimp for entrees. All were fantastic! The steak was honestly cooked perfectly (medium rare), and the shrimp were so flavorful I am already planning my next trip back for more. The wine list is really impressive with different types of wine and prices, so it feels like there is something for everyone. They have wine on tap which I wanted to try, but will save for next time.

The interior is nice, good decor and vibe. However, the menu is fairly limited and overpriced. They do a good job on some dishes and others leave you quite underwhelmed. In general, the pastas are a safe choice (although $20 for rigatoni in a watery cream sauce is pricey). Steer clear of the Branzino with grilled vegetables. The dish comes with two thin filets (albeit nicely seasoned) and FIVE thin overcooked zucchini rounds. I had to ration each round into small bites to try and make it last through the meal -- no luck. There were no other sides on the plate, just the empty space staring back. The meal was $26. Same story with the Spiedino appetizer. GV's take on fried mozzarella. Be prepared to receive nothing more than a small grilled cheese sandwich battered and fried, served with a side of salty anchovy sauce. This dish was $12 for two pieces of white bread with melted cheese.

I came back tonight and was beyond disappointed and frustrated in every aspect of my experience. There are way too many issues to even list but the main one I need to say is that this place needs to figure out its identity. Is it a dive bar or it is a classy restaurant? The menu claims 'you don't have to go to Manhattan to get the Manhattan experience' but what I experienced was an utter disaster. We paid for appetizers at the bar that never came, even after waiting an hour and a half. We tried really hard to give this place the benefit of the doubt because of our first experience but this time we couldn't wait to leave. Long story short: you may pay Manhattan prices but don't expect Manhattan experience.",Grand Vin,4.0 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian,, Cocktail, Bars"

But it was a nice place, all people very friendly, waiter was quick an seemed to appreciate our party. Beer menu was great.  We had some apps that were good. Kept alll the glasses filled , which i guess was a good thing, but not sure if they were just trying to increase the bill. We ordered Jack Daniels shots which seemed a little watered down, but gave us a whole round on the house. My girl got a jack an ginger and seemed the same way so id stick with beer an or wine. Over all if i lived closer id go back , food that other people ordered looked great an there was no short of people coming in an out and they had some live music as well. Again i know i seemed a little critical but id go back or recommend it",Grand Vin,4.0 star rating,$$,"Wine, Bars,, Italian,, Cocktail, Bars"
