I live near the original location of The Shepherd & The Knucklehead which is a great local bar for craft beer and drinks. The Hoboken location also creates the same atmosphere and has great craft beer selections. However, this location also has a more ""party"" vibe and music as the night progressed. It absolutely has more open space for dancing potential and a small stage like area with dart boards on the side.We were able to do an open bar special for $35 which included beer and wine or $40 for beer, wine, and single-mix liquor drinks.

The draft list is legit with an impressive number of local NJ brews. Represented breweries included Magnify, Carton, Brix City, Kane, Firestone Walker, Victory, Wet Ticket.

If you're looking to watch a New York team in a great atmosphere, you will enjoy this spot. The food is typical pub food - sliders, wings, french fries. Everything is decent - nothing special but definitely pretty good. The drinks are also a good price - I was slightly annoyed when three different cocktails/ciders were unavailable, but there's always a large enough drink menu to find something. On game days, be prepared to be there for awhile. The service is incredibly slow with the crowds, which makes sense but is worth noting. Definitely do not go here for a quick bite to eat.

It was disappointing because after a few bites we were left with a bowl full of chips and no meat. I will say the pork tasted really flavorful but again.. portions were so disappointing! I also had the veggie burger which was really dry, hard, and bland. The only good thing about it was the aioli and the fries it came with.

It smells like old drinks and the tables are sticky. If you don't mind that, they actually have some pretty good drink/food specials - especially on a Thursday night, when you can get $15 pitchers of margaritas, and build your own tacos for $2-$3.The tacos aren't anything to write home about. Definitely not great tacos, but they're pretty good for $2-$3. Chicken, and chorizo are $2 each, and steak, ahi tuna, are $3 each. It's nice that you get to choose your own toppings (lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream) and your choice of a few sauces, which comes on the side. The pitcher of margarita is a tad sweet and seems watered down, but we deffo started feeling something after one. They'll def sneak up on you.Service was a bit lacking and it wasn't even that busy. It took a while to get our tacos. Another couple sat probably 20 minutes after us and got their tacos at around the same time.

Just last night, what ended up being a $50 bill originally came to me and my boyfriend as over $100 because the waitress forgot to take off the Happy Hour specials and forgot to change the price of our beers from $9 to $2. This wouldn't be a problem if this were the first time it has happened, but this has happened EVERY TIME we've come here, and I suspect the owners just think people won't say anything--but I'm not one of those people. Fifty dollars is a lot of money, and if you advertise Happy Hour specials, be prepared to take those out of the bill.As for the food, I've never had a bad dining experience here, and I'm an especially big fan of the veggie burger and the mac and cheese (which I once got for free from a secret Happy Hour menu!). The beer selection here is always diverse and there's always something for everyone, plus the prices are reasonable (~$8 for a pint).

Tried a few drinks including the original Moscow Mule, the Santa Mule, and the one that comes in a giant golden coconut.

It's a little better than Smokin' Barrel, but the same layout and pretty much same decor. Both times we have been it's empty, very empty, which is concerning. On Football Sunday's it's obviously packed, the bros come out in full force on Sundays. Other times it's pretty quiet. It just reminds me of a suburban chain restaurant (which technically, I guess they are).They do have an excellent selection of beers, and besides Cork City this is it in Hoboken for solid craft beer choices. I do enjoy that, however the service staff doesn't seem to know much about the beer at all. So you are on your own there. I haven't sat at the bar, so hopefully the bartenders are more knowledgeable. Servers are very friendly but fairly absent.The menu has pictures of food on it, I expect that from diners and Applebees, not a place like this. I've gotten the sliders, buffalo wings and the wife has had the chicken wrap and grilled chicken sliders. The food was just meh. It looks good, it sounds good but it's just average. The only thing that stands out are the fries, they are very good. The buffalo wings were puny and the thai sauce was very bland, the buffalo was OK. The grilled chicken sliders were super dry. The burger sliders were just ok as well.

It's a little better than Smokin' Barrel, but the same layout and pretty much same decor. Both times we have been it's empty, very empty, which is concerning. On Football Sunday's it's obviously packed, the bros come out in full force on Sundays. Other times it's pretty quiet. It just reminds me of a suburban chain restaurant (which technically, I guess they are).They do have an excellent selection of beers, and besides Cork City this is it in Hoboken for solid craft beer choices. I do enjoy that, however the service staff doesn't seem to know much about the beer at all. So you are on your own there. I haven't sat at the bar, so hopefully the bartenders are more knowledgeable. Servers are very friendly but fairly absent.The menu has pictures of food on it, I expect that from diners and Applebees, not a place like this. I've gotten the sliders, buffalo wings and the wife has had the chicken wrap and grilled chicken sliders. The food was just meh. It looks good, it sounds good but it's just average. The only thing that stands out are the fries, they are very good. The buffalo wings were puny and the thai sauce was very bland, the buffalo was OK. The grilled chicken sliders were super dry. The burger sliders were just ok as well.

I love and highly recommend their buffalo burger. Coming alone for a drink and a meal is great, but the Shep is a lot of fun with friends. Bring a deck of cards or play darts on the wall.

And why shouldn't we love this place? Food is exceptional and they have literally 90+ craft beers on tap. The interesting thing is that whenever you mention the place to anyone, they start raving.It was with this expectation that we headed to Hoboken to try their new location and, as above stars indicate, it's also exceptional. Tipping the hat a bit closer to sports bar, the beer selection, food and especially the service could not possibly be better.This is how businesses grow. Create an awesome environment, stock it with good people and watch things happen. With The Shepherd & The Knucklehead, as long as they continue to follow this formula they should be able to keep opening new locations and winning over new customers. I honestly can't think of a better match then them and the great city of Hoboken. In a place with a virtual plethora of drinking/eating establishments IMO they reign supreme.When selecting 5 Stars, Yelp reminds you that you're rating them as good as it gets.

42,164xKMi0dLmwu2mC__XmnQ,Briana C.,4.0 star rating,Came here on a Monday. Staff was helpful and informative. We ordered a pitcher of sangria (red) which I would def order again. An order of regular buffalo wings (which during happy hour were 75 cents) and the giant pretzel with cup of cheese. For entrees we had the burger and the Mediterranean salad with chicken. Everything came out as expected. Service was fast and efficient. The only downfall and reasons for only 4/stars was that for a Monday night the  was atmosphere was dead. There was even a yankee game on and besides my table and one other table there were only five people at the bar. When we walked in it did smell like they just moped which is a good thing but then again I rather smell food when I walk into a place to eat not cleaning supplies. It's also kinda off the main strip which could be a downfall if trying to bar hop at night. But I would def recommend coming here for happy hour or dinner with friends.

The service on the other hand isn't the same quality as the one in Haledon but that can always be worked on and there's always an adjustment/settling in period to be considered with a new business.

Considering this isn't their first location, I'm being extra generous.I live in Weehawken right across the bridge so I was hoping to finally having a local craft beer bar in walking distance. Now, I'm thinking probably not.1) I came here on a football Sunday but for some reason they hired a DJ to play during the commercials of the early Giant game but leave when they were playing music instead of game sound during the later afternoon games. Huh?2) Menu notes ""VIP Hoboken residents coming soon!"" Guess they don't care about my business and think there's going to be tons of tourists coming besides it being nowhere near the PATH.3) It's week 2 and I saw many taps finished without being replaced. Extra worse considering they don't sell bottles.4) It's a craft beer bar but sizes are based on pricing rather than ABV (even though they aren't advertising ""all beers $7 or less"" or whatever it is).5) It's craft a beer bar but no good descriptions or RBV/BA ratings.6) It's a craft beer bar but bartenders don't seem to be well trained on what to recommend when a person asks for a Bud/Coors and told they are out.7) Week 2 and they were already running out of specials on NFL game night so much that by the late game they just had to say they had no specials because they ran out of cans.8) What bar, no matter what they're specialty, has no Jack Daniels?9) I tried the poutine tacos and they were pretty bad. No gravy and no cheese curds.

I hate when craft beer bars stock mostly double IPAs and neglect the many other styles people enjoy. Also, their happy hour (M-F $2 off beers, 3-7pm) puts a lot of these special beers within the same price range as a Miller or Yuengling here in Hoboken. We only had appetizers, but we devoured them. Everyone from the owner to the wait staff made us feel welcome, even with a baby in tow. Haven't posted on Yelp before, but I felt compelled to do so because we had such a great experience.
