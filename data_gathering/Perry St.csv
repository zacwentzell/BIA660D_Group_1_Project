The tomato soup was so good and might be the best I've ever had in a restaurant! Creamy and great texture to mix in with the bread.Pan Seared Black Sea Bass & Roasted Crescent Duck: I am not too into sea bass so that part was just okay not to my liking but the duck was tender and had great flavor!Molten Chocolate Cake & Caramel Apple Panna Cotta: The caramel was okay too damn sweet tho.

The restaurant setting is crisp and nice, right next to the water on Hudson. Service was attentive like I would expect from a Jean Georges restaurant; however, timing was initially a bit off. I ordered a cocktail and my friend ordered a glass of wine, and both came out after we had finished our bread, amuse bouche, and appetizer. It was like the initial start of our meal was too rushed, and they wanted our table. But after the entree, timing was okay. In terms of food quality, very delicious. We started with a complimentary taste of potato soup with black truffle - so insanely amazing! :) bread and butter was very average, not served warm. For my first course, I chose the salmon sashimi and my friend got the tomato soup. She enjoyed her soup, and I really liked my sashimi. Great portion size and very fresh. For our mains, we both got the delicious duck that included breast and confit. Served with bok choy. Finally for dessert, we both chose the chocolate molten cake with caramel ice cream. Tasty for sure but not particularly unique. Overall for $42+ drink, tax, & tip definitely worth it. Non-restaurant week, I don't know if I'd necessarily come back. Not because I was disappointed in my experience, but I've just been wow-ed more in the past for similar pricing of what the regular menu is.

Last, but certainly not least, we almost licked our dessert plates clean of the molten chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream and banana cake with brulee'd bananas and passion fruit sorbet. Everything was portioned superbly and so delectable, it only lead you to wanting more. Frankly, I would've paid the prix fixe price for any one of the 3 courses if it were enough to fill me up.

We were both around the area at the perfect time so we were hungry to try a restaurant during restaurant week. I'm glad she picked Perry St.I felt so underdressed when I arrived, because I had plans to eat somewhere else and workout afterwards. I did not expect a restaurant to be where it was. I legit thought of an actual restaurant on a cute West Village street. We were seated quickly, and scanned through the menu.So the food.....IT WAS SO AMAZING AND SO BALANCED!!!!! I started off with the Tuna Taretare, and WOW the flavors were on point. It was such a good balance between the salt and the fish that it was simply amazing. The sauce just made the texture of the tuna stand out, where it was savory and amazing. I was blown away.My main dish was the flatiron steak, and normally the cut for that piece of steak is really cheap, and is extremely hard to get right because of the texture of the meat. They knocked it out of the ball park. The texture was a perfect medium rare, with the charr on the outside which was a nice smoke taste. The steak just melted in my mouth. It was amazing, and I cannot say enough, that it's amazing, and so balanced!!!So for dessert, I had the Molten Chocolate Cake. I really don't have a sweet tooth at all, and I was so afraid that it was going to be overpowering in the sweet department. I was con'd into picking that dish, thanks to my friend. Let me tell you....IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT SUPER SWEET, which was a huge relief. It was, I'm going to say it again AMAZING AND BALANCED! It was lightly sweet, and the Salted Caramel Ice Cream pairing was so perfect because the ice cream was not sweet at all! It helped balance out the semi sweetness of the cake, where you were more in tuned with the texture of the cake, and he hot and cold of the ice cream and the cake.

The ambiance was quite nice - dimly lit with candles for the most part. Their Bellini was good - had lycee and raspberry in it. For appetizers we got Brussels sprouts salad, octopus and calamari. They were all pretty average. For entree they highly advised me to get their fried chicken. I would say that it wasn't even cooked well. Oh also - they didn't warn that it was going to be spicy and I have low spice tolerance which didn't help. For dessert I got the carrot cake and again, nothing special.

13,oKO2W_wX6JZtjfOOa0fhBg,Kevin C.,5.0 star rating,"Had a wonderful restaurant week lunch here at Perry St. The location of the restaurant is amazing - right at the water. It is a bit of a walk from the closet train station so make sure you account for the 10-15 minute walk. The restaurant itself is stunning - it's very clean, modern, and sharp. I love it! The music was very upbeat- not too sure how to describe it but it made me excited to eat.I opted for one of the cocktails, the Strawberry Royale. It was a tad bit too sweet for me, but it was very beautiful (I feel like the lemon peel coulda been a little neater). It was quite pricey at $16 so I'm not sure if I would recommend it.There is complimentary sour dough bread which was pretty nice. No butter knife so I just ripped up the bread and smeared it on the butter. I love free carbs so...I started with the shaved salmon appetizer which was amazing! The salmon sashimi was very fresh and tasty, and the accompaniments were so unique but great. I LOVED the addition of the chilled tapioca. I normally only eat tapioca in my Asian desserts, but having it in a savory dish was such a nice surprise - amazing texture. I think the red pepper was a tad bit too strong. The like coconut broth was great. Overall a very strong dish with beautiful presentation. For the entree I got the pan seared pork loin. The pork loin was perfectly cool, super juicy, and very flavorful. As someone who normally does not like squash, this was quite nice. The squash was nicely seasoned and not too soft or wet. The cherry mole was great and added another dimension of flavor to the dish.For the dessert I got the vanilla pan a cotta. The panna cotta was very smooth and perfectly sweet. I normally don't like desserts that are overly sweet, but it was balanced nicely by the tartness of the fruits.Overall a very pleasant experience. The restaurant is very nice. It has a super casual feel. I went at 11:45 AM and even when I finished the restaurant was not too busy. I don't think it's a must try during restaurant week because their regular lunch tasting menu is only a few dollars more but has much more options!",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

The water views and dim lighting made the ambiance very elegant and intimate.  I would highly recommend this place for date night! I noticed there were a few large round tables near the entrance so I think this place would be great for larger groups as well.Four dishes I would highly advise my fellow yelpers to try would be the White Asparagus, Perry St. Fried Chicken, Rice cracker crusted tuna, and their house made burrata.  Towards the end of our meal, the staff was nice enough to serve dessert with a candle and a Happy Birthday message on it.

Then again, I moved to New York 6 months ago. I haven't tried *THAT* many places.The interior design is also a killer to me. White furniture, minimal deco and glass doors all around. I'm a sucker for modern design. So I could stay there for breakfast, lunch and dinner if no budget limit.Since St Georges is great at dessert but salty entrees in general, I chose brunch to test the water. It caught me off guard how beautiful they could make their dishes, including the tastes. That Belgian Waffle is most definitely the BEST Belgian waffle I've ever had. It had enough crisp and enough soft. Adding on it was maple syrup and wonderfully roasted and caramelized walnuts. If I were alone there, I would've ordered a second one. They also got banana split pretty right. One layer of caramel on top of half banana, making the dish a little sweet, but not overly cheap sweet. The fruit sorbet was as strong as the fruit, but I couldn't remember the fruit.All in all, a fantastic restaurant for brunch.

The ambiance was quite nice - dimly lit with candles for the most part. Their Bellini was good - had lycee and raspberry in it. For appetizers we got Brussels sprouts salad, octopus and calamari. They were all pretty average. For entree they highly advised me to get their fried chicken. I would say that it wasn't even cooked well. Oh also - they didn't warn that it was going to be spicy and I have low spice tolerance which didn't help. For dessert I got the carrot cake and again, nothing special.

33,oKO2W_wX6JZtjfOOa0fhBg,Kevin C.,5.0 star rating,"Had a wonderful restaurant week lunch here at Perry St. The location of the restaurant is amazing - right at the water. It is a bit of a walk from the closet train station so make sure you account for the 10-15 minute walk. The restaurant itself is stunning - it's very clean, modern, and sharp. I love it! The music was very upbeat- not too sure how to describe it but it made me excited to eat.I opted for one of the cocktails, the Strawberry Royale. It was a tad bit too sweet for me, but it was very beautiful (I feel like the lemon peel coulda been a little neater). It was quite pricey at $16 so I'm not sure if I would recommend it.There is complimentary sour dough bread which was pretty nice. No butter knife so I just ripped up the bread and smeared it on the butter. I love free carbs so...I started with the shaved salmon appetizer which was amazing! The salmon sashimi was very fresh and tasty, and the accompaniments were so unique but great. I LOVED the addition of the chilled tapioca. I normally only eat tapioca in my Asian desserts, but having it in a savory dish was such a nice surprise - amazing texture. I think the red pepper was a tad bit too strong. The like coconut broth was great. Overall a very strong dish with beautiful presentation. For the entree I got the pan seared pork loin. The pork loin was perfectly cool, super juicy, and very flavorful. As someone who normally does not like squash, this was quite nice. The squash was nicely seasoned and not too soft or wet. The cherry mole was great and added another dimension of flavor to the dish.For the dessert I got the vanilla pan a cotta. The panna cotta was very smooth and perfectly sweet. I normally don't like desserts that are overly sweet, but it was balanced nicely by the tartness of the fruits.Overall a very pleasant experience. The restaurant is very nice. It has a super casual feel. I went at 11:45 AM and even when I finished the restaurant was not too busy. I don't think it's a must try during restaurant week because their regular lunch tasting menu is only a few dollars more but has much more options!",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

I'm a sucker for modern design. So I could stay there for breakfast, lunch and dinner if no budget limit.Since St Georges is great at dessert but salty entrees in general, I chose brunch to test the water. It caught me off guard how beautiful they could make their dishes, including the tastes. That Belgian Waffle is most definitely the BEST Belgian waffle I've ever had. It had enough crisp and enough soft. Adding on it was maple syrup and wonderfully roasted and caramelized walnuts. If I were alone there, I would've ordered a second one. They also got banana split pretty right. One layer of caramel on top of half banana, making the dish a little sweet, but not overly cheap sweet.

The tempura would've became soggy if the vinaigrette was added before the dish was brought out, which shows how much the restaurant cares about its food.As for the entrée, I got the sea bass and my mom ordered the flat iron steak. Both were delicious, but I thought the steak was better just because it was so wonderfully cooked. It was grilled to a perfect medium rare and the meat was SO tender.For dessert, I ordered the chocolate cake and my mom had the pavlova. While the pavlova was great, the chocolate cake is absolutely amazing. The salted caramel ice cream goes so perfectly with it that you savor every single bite.

The sea bass was cooked well but also under-seasoned / bland.Finally, for desert I had chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream and my wife had buche de noel.

The staff were really friendly and brought us to our seats not too long after the drinks were made. APPETIZERS - - Rice Cracker Crusted Tuna -- sooooo good. Would definitely suggest this appetizer. It was incredibly flavorful and had great texture. - Bay Scallops (on a bed of warm truffle-garlic toast) -- honestly i think the truffle-garlic toast is what took this appetizer to a whole new level. GET THIS APPETIZER if you can! ENTREES - - Roasted turkey -- my boyfriend ordered this dish. Nothing too incredibly great about it. The dark meat was a little dry. - Butter poached lobster -- I had this dish and it was really great! Highly suggest the lobster. It is over a lemongrass kaffir broth (YUM) and had potato garlic ravioli (doubly YUM). All the flavors just blended really well in this dish. DESSERT - - Caramelized apple pie -- just your good ol' typical apple pie dish- Spiced pumpkin pie -- just your good ol' typical pumpkin pie There was a couple who sat at the table beside us and ordered after us. We got our appetizers before them. And for some reason, they got their entrees before us. I noticed that the lady got the same entree I ordered, and the gentleman ordered the same entree my boyfriend ordered. I was a little appalled. The staff obviously made some kind of mistake, and they knew it, too. The manager came to our table after realizing this and apologized for the mix-up.

I came for brunch (my 2nd time there for brunch) and I decided I definitely like it here and would come more. Wait Time - I made a reservation about a week in advance - still had lots of availability.Atmosphere - 4/5I've always liked this restaurant because it's so bright and airy when you dine there during the day. It's right by the Hudson River, so you get a pretty nice view. It's super cute - good for groups + eating with friends. Service - 3/5It's a bit hard to rate the service, because in some areas they went above & beyond but in others, they were less than subpar. The way they place your food on the table + their attitude towards you implies a level of luxury. They also offer coat check upon arrival. However, the service in general was extremely slow despite the restaurant not being busy - it was a little less than half full when we went at 1:30PM. We didn't get to place orders for food until a little past 2PM.Food - 4/5We both ordered the Taste of Autumn brunch menu. From that menu I had the Fried Calamari appetizer and the Slow Cooked Salmon entree with the Molten Chocolate Cake for dessert. We also shared Buttermilk Pancakes. Pancakes - $18 - 4/5Pretty solid pancakes, but nothing super extraordinary about it. It satisfied my craving!Taste of Autumn - $36 (appetizer + entree + dessert)Amazing deal for brunch! Fried Calamari - 5/5 *MUST ORDER*Finally, fried calamari that actually stands out! It had the lightest, crispiest skin with perfectly cooked calamari inside. The yuzu dipping sauce was unique and perfectly complemented the fried calamari. Pretty large portion size for an individual appetizer - I had to share with my friend because I couldn't finish it alone knowing how much food was coming!Slow Roasted Atlantic Salmon - 4/5I asked for medium-rare salmon, but was pretty sure I got medium-well salmon instead. It wasn't overcooked to a point where I couldn't enjoy it, but that definitely affected my experience. Everything else on the plate was perfect - the brussel sprouts were amazing. There were drops of green + orange sauces around the plate (chili bell-pepper sauce) - they complemented the salmon + brussel sprouts so well. Also decent portion size - could barely finish it after I had the calamari + was nibbling on pancakes. Molten Chocolate Cake - 2.5/5I've had molten chocolate cake here before and it was good. Maybe I was too full by the time dessert came, but it was simply too sweet for me and I couldn't get through even half of it before I gave up. Latte - 2/5Wasn't really much of a latte - more like a cortado. The milk to espresso ratio wasn't that of a typical latte. But even as a cortado, it was not good. The espresso was super bitter and the milk didn't really cut the bitterness like it was meant to. I had to add a little bit of sugar (literally the first time I've ever added sugar to my coffee) to be able to drink it + somewhat enjoy it. Overall, would definitely recommend! I've had dinner here before, but I think it's more successful in my book as a brunch spot. It's pretty easy to get a reservation here - always a bonus for NYC brunch!

58,CKd9nO3hbZVCgE2QZeC3bw,Tobin T.,5.0 star rating,"Winter 2017 Resturant Week Lunch Menu ReviewWe arrived on a Monday late morning, about 20 minutes before the restaurant opened. Yet the Host still invited us inside out of the cold to relax in their lounging area. She checked our coats and even served us water as we waited for the place to open and start lunch service.We were seat promptly at 1130 and presented with our menu. They started is us of with a slice of sourdough bread you can smell a mile away before it came to your plate. It was fresh, soft, moist, with a perfect outer crust. Spread with the creamy unsalted butter and a sprinkle of DYI salt flakes- it made out appetite run in overdrive! Course #1: Heart of Romaine vs Salmon SashimiBoth dishes were presented beautifully and had a similar flavor profile- citrus, tangy, and bursting of fresh bold flavors.The salmon was vibrant dish boasting every color of the rainbow- a work of art! The texture of the fish was firm and melted in your mouth; accompanied with blood orange, bits of veg, market herbs, and a drizzle of vinaigrette gave a nice balance to the dish yet keeping the fish the distinguished star.The base of the salad came as whole leaf romaine with the body consisting of watercress, creamy sweet Gorgonzola, red onion, crispy shallots, sunflower seeds, dressed with honey mustard vinaigrette and a garnish of what seemed to be a rich avocado purée. I was a tad put off at the stalk of the lettuce was a tad browned at the end, and the lead itself was pale and bitter. Otherwise, each bit was explosive and pungent from the vinegar dressing which I personally appreciated.Verdict: Salmon SashimiCourse #2 Roasted Hake vs Caramelized Pork LoinAgain. Both dishes were presented quite lovely and had very Korean notes throughout the entree despite the Japanese origins. The first bite of the Hake was like heaven with a perfect seasoned rub that was very familiar, but could not identify. This was served on top of a light flavorful broth with cabbage, kombu, Yuzu Kosho, and mint. The fish was flaky and delicate, and melded so wonderfully with the whole dish! The pork loin, in my opinion, was a poor cut to attempt caramelization. It was so lean, that is came out hard and dry with a limited sear on both side. It was also about 30 seconds away from being completely dried out if it remained in the pan. The seasoning was good, but the protein alone didn't hold to its own. Only after mixing the pork with the accompaniment of Dill Spatzle, samjang sauce, and Honshineji did I experience the radiant marriage of favors that just worked too well with each other. Alone, they taste of nothing, but all together, it was amazing!Verdict: Roasted HakeCourse #3: Molten Chocolate Cake vs Carmel Apple Panna CottaThe moist cake was served warm and flowed of deep rich chocolate ganache that was not overwhelmingly sweet. Served with a lightly caramelized vanilla ice cream is sure to fulfill anyone's indulgence for chocolate dessert.The fluffy Panna cotta bursts of apple flavor with a cream texture that also isn't too sweet. Although, the side of green Apple sorbet was perhaps the most amazing sorbet I had ever tasted!Verdict: Carmel Apple Panna Cotta for the Green Apple Sorbet!Overall experience was beyond my expectation and I thought the Resturant week menu was well thought out. Some of the dishes had small issues, but the meal was still very unique and satisfying. I will definitely be back for their 7 days a week lunch chefs tasting menu which is a hard find in the traditional Dinner Tasting menu culture of NYC.

Dim lighting and views of the water made for a romantic atmosphere. Our server was definitely frazzled by how busy the restaurant was but she had a good attitude and it did not detract from our dining experience.The food was really excellent. They had a special Valentine's Day menu that was certainly a bit overpriced from the normal menu, but that's business. Not all of the options are on the normal menu, but I will describe the meal in full detail anyway as it was delicious from beginning to end. To start I split two appetizers with my girlfriend. They were the menu's classic rice crusted tuna with a sriracha citrus emulsion that was a great bite, good portion, and not too spicy. I also had a fluke sashimi in a citrus vinaigrette which was one of the better sashimi bites I have ever had. It was fleshy, acidic, sweet, and had texture from a light bread crumb on only one side. Phenomenal dish.For my main course I had a duck a l'orange that rivaled any I had had and was a lovely and romantic wintry dish on a Valentine's night.The desserts were also quite nice. I shared the chocolate pudding with whipped cream and crystallized violets and a citrus pavlova.

For food, I give this place 4 stars. For the experience we had, probably a 2 star. We had a group of 6 girls for reservation at 6pm. Half of our group was running about 15-20 mins late so the hostess came up to us and said if our group doesn't show up soon, they would need to take the table back and we were forced to order food instead of just enjoying our drinks. Okay, understandable..given it is a Friday night. We were also told we all had to order everything all at one time, which I didn't really like. I mean, what if I ate something and decided I wanted to add something else after? Then we had a customized cake and we spent some time taking pictures and the hostess told us they can give us a back lounge table to enjoy the cake and keep taking pictures (basically kicking us off the table we had). Everything felt really rushed. I get it is a Friday night, but we also spent a good amount of $ for our group. I mean, our bill was over $600 and for that amount, I feel that we deserved to have our time for dinner. Okay, enough with the experience...onto the food. Calamari was probably my favorite, the best calamari I've ever had. Lightest and fluffiest batter ever, squid was so soft. We had to order 2. The yuzu foam like sauce was amazing with it. The other memorable dish was the rice cracker crusted tuna. That was amazing. These 2 is a must! We ordered the sashimi, kale salad and octopus for starters as well. All 3 were pretty good, but the tuna and calamari was the best as starters. For entrees, we ordered the lobster, duck, black Sea bass, lamb chops. The lobster was really good. The duck I felt was a bit on the raw side. It could have been cooked more. The black sea bass was pretty tender, but the mushroom with this dish was actually tastier than the fish itself. The lamb chops I didn't try so I can't say. Overall the food was really good since Jean Georges rarely disappoints. The only thing is that the portions are way too small for me. Then again, it's French cuisine. I never get full from those. I still feel like I didn't eat at all :( who's down for pizza?",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

I was shying away from booking an event space because they typically feel cold, industrial and conventional to me, but it was challenging finding a restaurant large enough to host 75 people comfortably. Perry St provided the perfect balance of design, quality and fine-dining experience in a beautiful intimate setting. Because it's a restaurant you didn't feel like you're in an ephemeral environment.

Perry St definitely nailed this dish, so tender and chewy, and the mole made it even more flavorful. As for the main dish, I deeply enjoyed my medium-cooked duck, contrary to many other places, Perry St focused less on using the sauce to bring up the savory, instead, it emphasized the original duck meat taste. Very unique! Both the rhubarb tart and panna cotta were delicately presented - cannot skip them for sure if you are a fan of sweets.If I were to use one word to describe Perry St, that will be ""simplicity"".

The interior is beautiful and calm, and the location is so lovely. We were first seated next to a large rowdy group, but the staff was very accommodating and moved us at my request. The appetizers were my favorite part of the meal. I had the fried artichoke salad, and my boyfriend got the pea soup. The salad was perfect! Although fried, it didn't feel heavy. The cheese, fava beans, and greens were great as well. The whole thing just worked. The only complaint, if I had to give one, is that I wanted a little more for the price! The soup was also delicious. It tasted like peas (some pea soups are drowning in cream and/or salt), but also had an amazing tanginess from the tumbleweed cheese. I don't know what that is, but it was fantastic. The presentation of both were also beautiful. The entrees could have used a little worked. I ordered the fried chicken. It tasted great, however the chicken was a little over cooked. For $30 fried chicken, I was expecting perfectly tender chicken. The creamed corn and scotch bonnet sauce were delicious, though! I asked for more sauce! My boyfriend had the lamb chops, and it really was not worth the $39. He asked for it to be cooked medium, it was more like a medium well or even well. There were also huge chunks of fat on the tiny chops, so you get even less meat than you think. My boyfriend requested that I get something a little more fruity for my birthday, and the restaurant was so great about it. Instead of the chocolate dessert we saw everyone else get (lots of anniversaries on Saturdays), I got like a brown sugar crusted banana with all sorts of fruit, ice creams, and sorbets on it. I loved it. Only complaint is that some of the sorbet was half melted when it was brought to the table. Honestly, I'd be happy to eat here again. The staff is accommodating, and the interior is so romantic. The location is out of the way enough that it's not ridiculously crowded. You also don't have to wait 3 months for a reservation. I think I'd just play it a bit safer and be very specific and picky with the entrees and how you want it done. I'm sure the restaurant would do their best. However, I can't give more than 3 stars as it is fine dining and at these prices, dishes should need little to no work (especially when you look at the competition).",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

69,AHCJv6NI7v1UA05kPn1oXQ,Sherry J.,2.0 star rating,"Restaurant week visit: StaffI made a reservation for 7:00. Being in Manhattan and all, I arrived 10min late due to bus delays. Once we arrived, they told us to wait at the bar because our table wasn't ready yet. They said the same thing to the two customers in front of us. We sat down at the bar and weren't even greeted by the bartenders. About 3-4 were walking back and forth in front of us and nobody said a word. Not even when they served us water. Or when they brought the cocktail menu. I found that quite rude. No ""good evening"", hello"" or I would've even settled for a ""hi"". We waited till about 7:30 and then I asked the hostess what was going on. I mentioned that we had waited a while, I turned back to my conversation and noticed her still looking in my direction. She continued with ""we're literally setting your table right now"". I said that I didn't think I would need to wait this long for a reservation. About 5-10min to set the table would be enough? Maybe they needed more time. But she shot back with,""This is a restaurant, not everything is on time"" ""It's restaurant week so we're busy""??? I wanted to laugh. This is not the only restaurant I've been to for restaurant week. With other restaurants I've been able to walk in and be seated either right away or within 5minutes. This is not the only restaurant that's busy on a Friday. What's the point of having reservations if you're just going to wait anyways? They should be more clear: ""Make a reservation so the wait time for a table is decreased"". Maybe the hostess was just having a bad day. But she is the introduction to our meal, the first person to represent the restaurant. It left an impression of my friend too: ""it seems like everyone here is tightly strung and stressed"" was her comment. AmbienceIt feels more like a bar than a fine-dining restaurant. The lights are dim and it's quite noisy. Would be good for a date. FoodIn one word: underwhelming. The salmon appetiser was not bad, but any place with fresh salmon would be able to make the dish. Maybe I'm not a professional taster, but if I don't find it exciting at all, there must be an issue...Which leads me to the main course. I got the hake. When the waitress came over to ask if we were enjoying the dish, I mentioned I found it very bland. She offered, ""Not exciting enough?"". So she understood what I meant. The desserts were probably my favourite part of the meal. I got the vanilla panna cotta and my friend got the chocolate lava cake. The panna cotta was perfect with its sweetness paired with the tartness of the sorbet. The chocolate lava cake was great! Couldn't really taste the caramel in the ice cream though. ViewEven though this place boasts a view of the sunset over the Hudson on its website, don't expect to see one. The restaurant is on the first floor, add in a highway, a bunch of trees, some curtains, and you can't even see the river, nevermind a sunset. VerdictI expected more from a Jean-Gorges restaurant.

The tuna appetizer was a perfect start. The dish was clean and light enough to stimulate our appetites. The sea bass came with a lemon sauce and basil broth. The mushroom, two sauces, and fish make the most harmonious combination of flavors - highly recommend!! The duck dish was very interesting. It had thick slices of the breast that was cooked medium (didn't know you could eat it like this) along with the leg that came in a sauce. The duck was surprisingly so tender and had no smell at all. It also went really well with the grapefruit/orange and turnip/celery roots! I really liked the overall pace that our food was being served. We weren't rushed with everything at once, but were able to eat slowly and really savor our meals. However, the service got slow towards the  end of our dinner because the restaurant filled up and consequently decided to forgo dessert.

While Perry St. offers an exceptional dinning space and professionally prepared food,  the short comings of a waiter can cause what should be an exceptional dinning experience to be a mediocre dinning experience. We were a party of 7, celebrating 2 birthdays. There were only several other parties in the restaurant, cocktails were ordered and took forever to arrive. Once drinks were brought out, only 5 of the 7 arrived together.  And as soon as the drinks arrived the waiter was on us to order our meals. Then a gentleman brought what seemed to be stale rye bread to the table.  We had to flag down someone to request our waiter take our order.  Seems to me he should have known how to control the flow of the dinning experience.  A waiter should have the experience to add to the dinning experience, rather than just be an order taker - particularly since the waiters don't even bring out the meal. Wine glasses were brought to the table and then removed because the wait staff was confused as to who ordered wine, which we had not. The lack of attentiveness by the waiter put a pall over the meal that the quality of the food could not overcome. As for the food, while the dishes were delicious, they didn't knock my socks off.    As there are many other terrific restaurants in NYC that have figured out how to present a complete package, Perry St. failed to do so.  We were quite disappointed and will not be returning.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

That Yuzu dipping sauce was also absolutely incredible. We had quite a bit of the sauce leftover after we quickly devoured the calamari and merrily paired it with some bread.I also ordered the Roasted Monkfish as my entree which was quite good. Nothing particularly notable about this dish to be honest. But I was still on such a high from the calamari that I overlooked the fact that the monkfish did not blow my socks off. For dessert, we collectively ordered the Strawberry Pavlova, Brown Butter Carrot Cake, Valrhona Chocolate Mousse, and the Panna Cotta. Everything was AMAZING.

This restaurant has an airy upscale modern ambiance with lots of open window light. They have a lounge, bar, and seating area. My boyfriend and I made last minute reservations for restaurant week. We got there a little early and they offered to seat us at the lounge area to eat if we prefer not to wait- we were totally fine with that as the lounge area seemed comfortable! We sat and picked out our drinks -I got to hand it to the baristas, they know what they are doing. The drinks were so good we were already trying to pick out our next drinks to try! The food here is excellent! They take the meaning fusion to the next level- they are daring, bold and different with their dishes. Each dish was beautifully presented and exquisite with a play to all your senses.Their services is top notch professional and very attentive. Everything about this restaurant is perfect.For appetizers: We got the Rice Cracker Crusted Tuna with Sriracha-Citrus Emulsion. The tuna was fresh with the perfect temperature, the rice cracker brought a different feel to eating raw fish. The balance between crunchy and soft meat was so interesting and topped with the perfect sauce- a bit spicy, a bit citrus-y, and a bit mayo-y. All so good eaten together.For entrees: I got the Butter Poached Lobster in lemongrass and kaffir lime broth with potato ravioli. This is the dish that won me over and I still think about this dish from time to time. I recommend this to everyone. The broth tastes a little bit Thai as it is comparable to Tom Yum soup both being tangy. But this dish has a more buttery taste and texture. The lobster was amazing as you get the juicy tail and the tender claws. The ravioli was also delicious, everything about this dish is well thought out to be intensely flavorful.

I enjoyed the pork, with the mushroom and pasta base as a highlight and a delicious sauce that added a wonderful spice. The chocolate cake (lava cake) was the perfect end to a marvelous meal. I was really blown away by how friendly and accommodating our server was. He was extremely helpful and always available when we needed him - and it was somewhat crowded in the restaurant. He also offered really wonderful recommendations when we could not decide what we wanted. I was extremely impressed with his professionalism, and would absolutely return.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

96,lkVsTGvz598CMHLXtyykFA,Cristina X.,5.0 star rating,"Here I am again at perry street, 5 months after my first delightful visit during restaurant week. The salmon entree is still vividly delicious in my memory. I love their style - simple, elegant and delightful (delicious!) - from the modern interior, to drinks, to each dish! This time I made a reservation through open table one week ahead for a Friday night. My friend and I arrived early so we sat at the bar waiting for the rest of the party. The bartenders are super nice and make great drinks! We got Lychee-raspberry Bellini and matcha with gin. Both are perfect fit for this season: refreshing and light (and not sweet).We ordered seasonal mushrooms, grilled octopus and asparagus as appetizers; duck and lobster as main dishes for share; Panna cotta and lemon tart with rose as desserts. I enjoyed everything and here are the highlights!Grilled octopus (5/5):Perfectly grilled, chewy yet tender. Really love the light smoky taste. The sauce is also delicious. Lastly, wonderful presentation with seasonal flowers! Duck, duck, duck! (5+/5)What a master piece! The duck is perfectly cooked with little garish and little condiment, which on the contrast, demonstrated how wonderful and complex duck can be in texture and taste. The dish is cooked in two ways - medium-cooked meat is tender and juicy. One bite, ohhh, wonderful light duck aroma is melting my heart. And inside its little chewy texture, more tender and juicy... The central piece is on purposely grilled - a nice smoky duck aroma and chewy texture. Definitely enjoyed every bite of this dish - highly recommended to all the duck fans (a big one here =)).Will see myself return soon to try out their brunch menu in the summer! ------ previous review ------Perry st has been sitting on top of my to-try restaurant list for a while, since it is widely mentioned and super popular on Yelp, also the pics online look great! I'm so exited that My friend and I chose it as our first stop to reveal 2016 Jan retardant week. Overall it was a great experience: nice modern, simple decoration creating a relaxed and nice ambiance; finest food with excellent flavor and texture combination; super friendly staff...Once entered the restaurant, I immediately fall in love with the simple design and white color decorations with big ceiling windows overseeing Hudson River, which creates a really nice and relaxed ambiance. We decided to try all of the items on restaurant week menu since its two choices for each course. First, we got complimentary potato soup with truffle sauce and pepper( my guess). The warm thick soup with a touch a truffle and spicy (prolly from pepper) really opens up my appetite from the cold Hudson River wind. House made burrata and Brussels sprout salad are both pretty good: fresh and various texture combined. it's a marvelous idea to pair Yuzu sauce and toasted crispy bread with burrata! The trace of fruit smell really brightens up this appetizer. Brussels sprout has been one of my fav veggie: this salad just took it to the next level - Brussels sprout is warm, crispy and yet not greasy at all (at other places I had either ones with too much oil or somewhat stale). Sourdough crusted salmon is my favorite main dish - salmon is a very common dish in many restaurants, also easy to cook but very hard to excel. I have to say well job done on it! Love the texture - not too fatty, not too juicy (watery) nor too dry. The sauces they pair with main dishes add a great layer of taste yet not overwhelming just like the ambiance. Last, the warm choco cake is the best I have ever had! I'm a sweet Asian tooth (love sweets but not too sweet). This cake is just about right!I enjoyed the dinner. And will come back during spring/summer time for brunch.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

Main Points- Make reservations- Great service - The bar area can get a bit crowded- Rice cracker tuna was delicious- Lobster & Gnocchi was my favorite - For food and drinks, it will be in the $80+ range Perry St definitely has it's Southeast Asian influences in the food, but still very french. We arrived here promptly but the hostess informed us that the group ahead of us was just finishing up, so we went to the bar. The bar was packed, probably because of people who didn't have reservations, so it took a while to flag down a bartender. Also they had 2 HUGE vases of flowers on opposite ends of the bar, so that contributed to getting a bartender to serve us since we were hiding behind a giant bouquet. The atmosphere was definitely upscale, but not as stuffy or quiet as I imagined it would be. Our waitress was excellent with top service.

I love fine dining and the aesthetics here really stood out.- I was impressed by the salmon and fried chicken. The flavors were hearty, yet crafted with incredible finesse.- I loved the chocolate cake! It wasn't too sweet, otherwise it'd be overwhelmingly rich. The ice cream balanced it out perfectly in terms of texture and taste. - Their lunch tasting (3 courses) is only $29. So worth it.

No one had a wow moment with anything they put in their mouth, but everything was done impeccably. The tuna with rice cracker crust was delicious. The potstickers might as well have been frozen but the sauce and sweet potatoes that accompanied them were interesting and a nice surprise. The calamari was light and crisp and pleasant. Tenderloin had a great crust and a nice pink center. Duck was excellent, maybe better prepared than I've ever had. Salmon was perfect although I noticed people skipped the accompanying Brussels. The wine list is solid with lots of great choices. Excellent selection of spirits, with good mezcal which I appreciate. Service was professional but too cool. The whole staff seemed focused on a benign, vanilla, slightly glum affect. And at the same time, service was kinda klutzy, banging glassware and silver.

But the bathrooms were very badly placed just behind a half wall next to a booth. Yuck!Service: This was the true disappointment.We had an 830 reservation for 4 on Xmas Eve.We arrived at 815. We waited 45 minutes to be seated. Half of our party was over 80 years old, and a very fashionable, chic, cheerful and accomodating over 80's I might add. So seeing this, I'd have expected the hosts to be much more helpfull than they were. They made us wait, and wait and wait, standing, in the cramped and cold entryway, for someone to take our coats. Then we had to wait wait wait (over 45 mins) in the overly cramped bar (bench area) for our table. At this price point and celeb chef status, If you see that you have 4 guests, two of whom are over 80 yrs old, you need to be on top of their needs. Not ignor them. When we were finally seated, the service was super slow and not very knowlegable. We waited and waited to be seated, to be seen, and then served. We had three courses plus cocktails and wine, none if which was served with attention to time or detail. The food was warm, and mostly very good. However, when we finished, and were leaving, and fruitlessly trying to hail a non existent cab on a freezing rainy windy x mas night on the westside hway...we went back into the host and asked if they'd call us a cab.  They refused. They said, ""we don't do that"", to two elderly people! ""We don't call cabs"". OMG!  Can you imagine!? I ended up getting us a Lyft.  To me that is unacceptable! Never again.

They have a limited restaurant week menu this year, two choices each for apps, mains, and dessert. JZ and I had total opposite choices, yet there were three of us, so AL had to be the tie breaker. Rounds of bread and butter kept coming around our table, glasses of water were always filled.Crispy Calamari- one of the best calamaris I've had. Lightly battered, fried till just soft, served with a fluffy basil sauce on the side. The pieces of unbelievably tender squid plus the hint of basil from the sauce were a perfect match, it was different and much tastier than the boring ole marinara sauce.Roasted Chicken- I thought my piece of chicken was a bit small, or was it just not enough chicken for me to finish all the barbeque sauce on that plate? This barbeque sauce was fruity, smoky and tangy. The little balls of polenta bites were crispy on the outside, sweet, warm and fluffy inside.Yuzu Eclair- the mango sorbet was tangy, every bite was perfect with the crunchy, toasty sesame brittle. The citrus glazed eclair was just as good, the amount of tart to sweet ratio was right.This was the just the perfect place for us girls in need of a lunch date, it was quiet, except that it was a bit of a trek since there isn't much public transportation around.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

We both got the 3-course lunch tasting menu, which was definitely a steal at only $28. I started with the Perry St Steak Tartare, which I enjoyed immensely. I loved the spiciness of the tartare, which was paired perfectly with the crunchy, buttery toast it was served with. Same with the crispy quail egg. Always a fan of a good quail egg. For my entree, I ordered the Perry St Fried Chicken. It was honestly probably the best fried chicken I have ever eaten. Crispy and juicy, but not at all greasy, the chicken pretty much tasted like perfection. Loved that it was boneless too. Hate having to work for my food, naw mean? Also a huge fan of those collard greens, which I not only finished but wanted more of. Crazy, huh? Naturally, my friend and I both got the Molten Chocolate Cake, as it is one of Jean-Georges' signature desserts and it honestly doesn't get any better than that.

I came here with friends and family. It was a college graduation lunch. We ordered the lunch set, which was a great deal for appetizer, entree and dessert ($29!). Each of the dishes were not unfamiliar, yet the tastes had unique twists that made them all the more tasty. For example, the salmon appetizer had the citrusy & sweet pomelo sorbet, accompanied with yuzu and a hint of jalapeño spiciness. Yes, unusual combination but it was really unique and yummy! Many of us ordered the fried chicken, which was so crispy yet tender inside. Love how it comes with an orange sauce in a tiny cute beaker. We also ordered, mussels & clams, pea soup, tuna tartare, the two different entree burgers in the set menu, and calamari. All good, all satisfying. Then the dessert! The seasonal strawberry sorbet and ice cream was so refreshing, while the molton lava cake was perfectly baked.Great place for a nice date or group celebratory meal.

You can also get a nice view of the Hudson River if you sit in the front of the restaurant. The service is great: nice, helpful, and professional. There's also free working WiFi![FOOD]Salmon Sashimi: This was an amazing starter. It was incredibly light and clean and simple. The salmon itself was fresh and carried not a hint of fishiness. The grapefruit sorbet was almost ethereal but had a good taste. The jalapeño added a light kick. Together, all the ingredients worked perfectly.Slow Cooked Hake: Just from cutting the fish in half, parts of it flaked off. It's a fish very similar to cod. It was cooked absolutely perfectly, and while the fish has a one-dimensional taste, the other ingredients give flavorful depth to the dish. The mushrooms have the umami flavor, the yuzu gives a tangyness, and there's a small kick from peppers. Together, the dish works together amazingly with very vibrant flavors.Parmesan Crusted Pork Loin: Absolutely amazing. I highly recommend this dish. The pork is cooked perfectly, and the meat is tender and juicy and incredibly flavorful. The butter sauce pairs well, and the broccoli rabe has an earthy taste. I can't stress enough how amazing the meat was.Warm Molten Chocolate Cake: After the high of eating the pork, this cake will take you to heaven. Though it's so simple with just vanilla ice cream, the gooey filling is orgasmic and nothing less. Just perfect.Almond Cake: This dessert was okay. The cake is nice, and the sorbet is fresh.[OVERALL]This was only $32 after tip and tax. For a place this nice with such amazing food, there's no reason not to mini-splurge.

The lobster comes with potato ravioli and sits inside a silky smooth, slightly sweet buttery broth. Yum. You must order dessert here. The Corn Souffle is a work of art. Who is the pastry chef? How did they come up with the idea to pair caramel popcorn and chipotle ice-cream? This is a must-order! It sounds weird, scary and spicy, but it's not. It's great. Service was on point as usual.

The decor is very modern, bright, and elegant, as to be expected from Jean-Georges restaurants. In general, the vibe is more on the posh side of things, which we were a little unprepared for. When we arrived, we actually both felt pretty under-dressed for the occasion, but the hostess was very kind, didn't skip a beat, and managed to hide her judgment, haha. We began the meal with a tuna tartare amuse bouche, which was pretty tender and the flavors were very well-balanced, with a bit of salty richness, but still refreshing. Instead of going with two entrees, we decided to go with two appetizers (the roasted autumn mushrooms and the burrata) and splitting the lamb chop/lamb belly main dish. The roasted mushrooms were bomb. The earthiness of the mushrooms really came out well, and the sherry vinaigrette provided a nice contrast. The burrata was interesting, since the crostini it came with were so razor thin, and it didn't come in the usual large sphere that it usually does at most restaurants. Nonetheless, it was still delicious, and the olive tapenade/lemon jam it came with provided some unique flavor profiles. The lamb chop was excellent, but the star in my opinion was the lamb belly that accompanied the chop. The belly really just flaked apart, and paired with the tomato jam, it was game over. The calypso beans that came with the lamb were a tad under-cooked for my tastes, but the lamb was just so good that I still rated this dish a success. We decided to split the peanut butter brownie sundae in the end, which came with grape sorbet. The sorbet by itself was actually very good, but didn't really have any place in this. I get the whole PB&J play-on, but it really didn't work in my opinion.Service was a bit on the spottier side, especially towards the end, not to mention a little impersonal. Also, it was a little cold out and since we were seated not too far from the front door, there was a pretty intense draft that came in every time the door opened, which was a little annoying. Prices are very much on the heftier side, but it's good knowing that the food is going to be great, and that you'll have plenty of Instagram fodder by the end of the night. I really thought the overall experience was more 3.5 stars, but I'll round up because the food was excellent.In all, it's not a bad place for a fancy dinner date. I feel like Perry St is one of the more forgotten Jean-Georges restaurants, given that it's so far west, there isn't that much hype surrounding this place, and the menu isn't quite as inventive as some of the other JG restaurants, in my opinion. Nonetheless, the experience in general was decent, and I would consider it an more than adequate choice in the realm of fine dining.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

Are you here was delicious and the service was impeccable. We started off with the appetizers, a fresh summer tomato salad and another with salmon sashimi. For the entrées I got the hake and my husband got the everything crusted chicken. The chicken unfortunately was a bit dry so we exchanged it for another hake. The hake was incredibly soft with a delicious mashed potato on the bottom and vegetables at the top, making for a lovely combination of textures and flavors.  The desserts were each incredible, with a molten chocolate lava cake which is Sean George's signature dessert, as well as a Pannell cotta with berry sorbet, and the waiter was nice enough to give us an additional freshly baked mini peach pie because of our dry chicken experience earlier. The peach pie was my favorite out of the three, since it had a flaky crispy and buttery shell with a delicious start feeling on the inside. The ambience of the restaurant was trendy and hip, though still retaining an intimate upscale feel, without being too loud.  What a pleasant surprise dining here and we will surely be back",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

We happened to be in west village and took a chance to drop in without a reservation.  Admittedly, it was not totally impromptu because when we decided to go to Perry Street, we were 5 minutes away and I had the foresight to called ahead and was told a reservation was not necessary.  We only waited a few minutes to be seated albeit near the door which was a little chilly on this blustery President's Day holiday.  There was a space heater on the floor which offered a little warmth to the not-the-best seats in the house.  The $29 prix fixe lunch was remarkably a great deal.  We added drinks which easily negated the great deal but well worth it.  I enjoyed my cocktail and my companion likewise his whiskey.  I started off with a salmon sashimi which was plated like a wreath of greens and salmon.  The starter was perfect with my lychee and raspberry Bellini, an accidental pairing that worked.  My friend had the steak tartare that held up to his scotch so another accident gone right.  I chose the signature fried chicken and he had salmon, both very satisfying and good choices following our substantial starters.We ended with a standard molten lava cake and ice cream and passionfruit and pomegranate sorbet.All in all, it was lovely to duck into this westside iconic restaurant and sample the culinary artistry of Jean-Georges and son, Cedric Vongerichten on a snowy winter day.  Sometimes spontaneous decisions like this are more meaningful than painfully pre planned meals like the ubiquitous Valentine dinners the day before.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

Overall it was good, but not so amazing that I will crave it in the future. The fried chicken as the main appetizer was SUPERB, though. This isn't your average run of the mill fried chicken. The crust was flaky, not oily at all, and the meat was tender and juicy, and boneless! The green sauce that came with it was DIVINE and sweet but not too sweet.

I also sampled my friend's Taste of Winter menu, who ordered the yuzu calamari, the fried chicken, and carrot cake dessert. The calamari was very well done, being very delicately breaded and the yuzu flavored foam pairing very well. The fried chicken was also very flavorful and not too dry, while the carrot cake was a unique interpretation of the typical dessert but still very tasty.

Disappointing and reviews are totally misleading.I went here with my bf and friends for my birthday for dinner. We decided to eat the regular dinner course and not the tasting. We had decided to order a few of the appetizers and all ordered entrees that the waiter recommended was popular/restaurant was known for. The only appetizers I'd recommend coming from me and my friends are the rice cracker tuna and the octopus. Almost the entrees are salty. I'm really surprised. My friend said his lobster was actually good, but my other friend said it was just ok. The dessert was actually pretty good, but I don't know since they gave it me for free.The website and dress code makes it out to be like it's extremely dressy, however it's not. I was really surprised. I came dressed thinking I couldn't go anywhere near business casual, but my friend came in like that and another friend came in somewhat casual and didn't care. Also what surprised me was  all the sudden this live country brand started playing. Considering it's supposedly a classy place it really was out of place and actually shocked me when they started playing. This place is a little small btw (not big as the pic they have of their restaurant can be misleading) and there wasn't any performance platform. I guess some places can have that, but I wasn't expecting it.The service was good. However, two people we were dealing with didn't know what cocktails were available. One said they could make a certain cocktail available while the other said they couldn't make the cocktail. Kinda made my friend upset at the waiter that didn't know and who was stern about saying that they didn't make the cocktail. This restaurant needs to make sure their staff has full knowledge of everything and if they don't know what drink can be made just ask the bartender instead of being rude.

I went for a birthday brunch and loved the interior the moment I stepped in. The presentation of the food reflected the thoughtful interior as well. The crusted ahi tuna is an absolute must. Probably my favorite dish from the brunch. The salmon sashimi was delicious as well, and almost too pretty to eat. But don't you worry, we ate every piece and enjoyed it as well. The fried chicken with wild rice was perfectly seasoned and had a pretty good crunch factor. For dessert, we got the molten chocolate and carrot cake and both were delicious without being too sweet.

It was very refreshing, considering the long walks we took from near by subway stations. I love ordering from restaurant week. Choices are simple and straightforward. For appertizer, I got the Salmon Sashimi with Cucumber, Wasabi Sorbet. It was the best sashimi ever! The nuts scattered in that dish made wonder. For entree, I got the Roasted Hake with Sweet Corn, Cherry Tomatoes and Basil. My friend got the same dish from the regular menu, and hers was 2x in portion. The hake had a nice crispy sear, yet it somehow didn't blend in very well with other ingredients on the dish. In fact, the fish tasted too bland in the companion of the flavorful side veggies. There was hardly enough food. Lemon Verbena Custard and Market Berries, Vanilla Rose Syrup came for dessert. It was lovely, and Molten Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream was also great. 4 stars were for the Salmon Sashimi, the food presentation, the professional staffs, and the elegant and relaxing ambiance.

The Long version: Perry St landed on my must try list years ago when it first opened. But at that time it was hard to get a reservation at prime time and my sister in-law came away with her review as overrated and unimpressed. Not exactly a ringing endorsement for a NYC Jean Georges establishment in trendy TriBeCa. So I waited years to come but decided to dine here last week with my hubby and our closest friends, another couple with discerning palates and high expectations of fine NYC dining. We sipped on the the white heat tequila drink-spicy jalapeño infused tequila with lime and grapefruit-I could not have concocted a more perfectly balanced drink to my liking and the wildwood-fresh strawberries muddled in bourbon-yum. The vodka thyme lemonade also seemed to be a hit and their wine by the glass list was extensive and made it possible for us to order by the glass to complement our food. We snacked on snapper sashimi which was superb in texture and bold in flavor, the kale salad which was crunchy with kale chips nestled between raw kale and shredded parmigiana reggiano lightly dressed, rice cracker crusted tuna and grilled Spanish octopus. This could be the tastiest most supple octopus I have ever had-tender with smoky notes which pop in your mouth. We enjoyed the black bass dish with the giant mushroom-one of the largest I have ever seen or eaten, the Maine Shellfish a la plancha in a tasty green curry broth-this was divine in terms of the sauce-not thick or salty-the scallops were soft and cooked to perfection but a few of the mussels were sadly served closed unable to be consumed! This dish was the only one that seem to lack the wow factor. While the curry was tasty, it didn't scream to be sopped up with the bread on the side. The lamb chops were also grilled to perfection.We were stuffed but our friends insisted on trying the steamed chocolate pudding with its crunchy crystallized violets and brownie bottom and the sweet roasted corn soufflé with a caramelized popcorn and chipotle gelato. This last one was for me the standout dessert and surprise of the evening. What I particularly love about Perry St was the sophistication of the food all in a pretty cool modern space. The vibe is casual but trendy enough to garner its clientele who clearly understand that you don't need a stuffy atmosphere to enjoy flavorful complex and exquisitely prepared food.

Portion was small but the fish was very flaky and cooked well.- The pork loin came with delicious mustard ""cubes"" which balanced out the smokiness of the meat. 3) Warm Chocolate Cake & Upside Down Pineapple Cake- Surprisingly generous portions for dessert, especially the pineapple cake. I'm a big fan of lava cakes, so the chocolate cake hit the spot for me, but the pineapple cake was also very tasty and fruity.

We arrived on time at 9:30 and the host asked us to wait for 20 minutes while our table finished up. She asked us to ""clear the area"" also while we waited, which was rather rude. We sat in the seats near the bar and our server was completely inattentive. He attempted to fill up water glasses that were not ours (and there were only 2 while it was a party of 4 - so that's a whole other story) and then promptly forgot about our drinks. NOT off to a good start. When we were finally seated, we had to re-order our drinks again. Our new server was much better and super sweet. For appetizers, we tried the calamari, peach frisee salad, and the salmon sashimi. I personally had the peach salad and it was tasty - one of the best flavor combinations I could ever imagine, with fresh peaches, goat cheese, crystalized wasabi, and frisee in a creamy thousand-island type dressing. The calamari and sashimi were also very enjoyable, per my friends. Onto the entree. I ordered the short ribs, while others ordered the hake and the fried chicken (which was not on the Restaurant Week menu, although it was listed on their website on the Restaurant Week menu). The short ribs were tasty, but they were a little scant and it definitely seemed a little lacking for a meal. The off-RW fried chicken was a heartier portion. Lastly, the desserts. The chocolate molten lava cake was nice, as well as the crepe cake. Overall, things were just very average. The meal was tasty, but it wasn't anything special. About my comment above about the portion being lacking -- I do feel as if Restaurant Week is the best opportunity for people to really try a menu.

148,lHgNf1GVKUogXqZEEqBnMA,Ali M.,4.0 star rating,"IN SHORT: Chic, subdued Jean-Georges dining at its finest, Perry St. is a quietly sexy and modern space serving elegant, French-inspired fusion food with a noticeably Asian twist.THE STORY: Perry St. is a lesson in coolness. Some restaurants seem to adopt coolness as a trope, combining of-the-moment culinary trends, an apathetic staff, and perhaps even some house music for the sake of a self-consciously cool affect. Perry St., however, with its wide glass windows, white furniture, and Vongerichten pedigree, knows just exactly how haute and excellent it really is. And that makes it the coolest restaurant at which you will you will ever eat. There is no pretending in a space like this, and as a result, the restaurant feels more earnest and genuine than expected. The ambiance is intensely intimate while still suggesting a youthful contemporary, and the food is so intensely flavorful, while still maintaining a lightness and clarity.And every member of the staff could be a model. There's that, too.The Sweet Pea Soup appetizer with tumbleweed cheese and sourdough croutons is a bright, ethereal, foamy broth that may be the best version of the soup out there, though some of the appetizers fare a little less well. The House-Made Burrata, while itself exceedingly fresh and lovely, was overpowered by a sweet rhubarb jam and hidden bombs of wasabi that explode unknowingly on the palette, wiping out the diner's sinuses for a few minutes.The entrees are the dishes that better show off some of Jean-Georges and his son, Cedric Vongerichten's truly nuanced conceptions of flavors. The Caramelized Beef Tenderloin with crispy and creamy potatoes and chanterelles was an elegant innovation on a classic, particularly with a spicy, thick green harissa sauce that represented the ultimate improvement upon a horseradish complement.It may be that the flavors are so clear at Perry St. that the errors seem to emerge as powerfully and strikingly as the successes. The Roasted Crescent Duck with passion fruit glazed carrots, garbanzo beans, and red miso, while perfectly cooked, had slightly too much sweetness from the fruit and cinnamon flavor to fully appreciate the balance of the red miso. The Butter Poached Lobster, however, with its kaffir lime broth and potato ravioli, had a thrilling zing that framed the richness of the lobster and brought out the succulent subtleties of the dish.There are still missteps, though, like when a waitress poured 4 glasses of wine each a different amount, leaving a friend with half of a lobster and a party-sized glass of red wine that she didn't really want to go with it. There are unfortunate inconsistencies in the food as well, with some elements of each dish overpowering others with a sweetness or spice that can unfairly destabilize the delicate balance of a dish.But maybe that's what makes Perry St. even cooler. It's not perfect. It's an exceptionally good restaurant that doesn't take itself more seriously than it should, and that is pretty cool.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

Each dish was thoughtfully and beautifully presented, tasting as delicious as it appeared. The salmon didn't have any notable seasoning and may be rather ""plain"" to some. But I enjoyed it as is and found it incredibly moist. I also particularly enjoyed the dessert! While the ice cream didn't have much flavor, the strawberry sorbet had a strong fruity taste and was refreshing. The crunchy bits on top also lent a nice contrast to the smoothness of the overall dessert. We also ordered cocktails, and I definitely preferred my friend's lychee-raspberry bellini over my matcha colada, which I didn't anticipate to taste really bitter. However, the waitstaff was incredibly attentive- noticing my distaste, the waiter came right over to see whether I'd prefer a different drink.Overall, the prix fixe was definitely a steal at only $29 for the food and service of a Jean-George restaurant, and I would probably return again to try out the offerings on their normal menu!",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

To my delight. The maître d' was gracious enough to offer my cocktail drink to be done according to my taste and that speaks a lot about a place. We were given an amuse-bouche I forgot how it's called but it tasted of delicious sweet summer corn with a hint of spiciness to it. It was divine and it had me anticipating for a real fantastic dinner. The rice cracker crusted tuna was so delicious that we were tempted to try all the other appetizers instead of having the entrees as they all sounded lush and delish. We agreed to do it next time. We had the beef tenderloin and the grilled lamb chops which were both good and I will surely be back to try the others. I was more than happy that the staff brought a personal touch to our choice of dessert - molten chocolate cake with the birthday greeting and a candle. This is only my third dining experience with a Jean George restaurant but it definitely still surprises my ever eager palate. I'm so glad we went to this place and definitely will be back.

160,pz3Ulbuk7ZiUUbT7oFzmpA,Lori L.,4.0 star rating,"There are few places more epitomic of West Village than Perry Street. Situated at the edge of West Manhattan with a gorgeous waterfront view of the Hudson River, the entrance to this restaurant is a little difficult to find (Note: Don't confuse it with the entryway to the apartment complex next door) but stepping inside, I was greeted with a bright, elegant dining room. The dining area plays off a white and beige theme, consisting of smaller tables and semi-circle booth seats for slightly larger groups, lamps hung on elongated poles, and plenty of windows that allow diners to enjoy a backdrop of sun against the water. A group of us dropped by on a weeknight for a Restaurant Week dinner, a reservation that I had been slightly hesitant to make given the general uncertainty of these weeks. It was, in hindsight, a wise decision.We were treated to a small amuse bouche that balanced the elements of sweet and savory beautifully, and began with our first courses. I had opted for the Grilled Tomato Soup, which was first presented in a deep bowl with just a circular scoop of cantaloupe, a cube of pineapple and watermelon, and sliver of cucumber, before the server poured the remainder of the soup in. It was delightfully light and creamy, and I appreciated the edge of acidity found naturally in tomatoes. The hints of basil provided a fragrant finish to each spoonful, and the freshness and sweetness of the fruits towards the end made for a satisfying finish.This was followed by the Perry St. Fried Chicken, a very refined take on the original pedestrian dish. The plate consisted of two pieces of lightly breaded and fried chicken paired with a Scotch Bonnet Sauce. I was slightly disappointed at the lack of heat in the sauce, but the chicken deserves its own accolade. It was deboned, which made it easier to eat with a fork and knife, the white meat was surprisingly tender and juicy, and the seasoning was just right - not overly heavy, but enough to give the originally bland protein some flavor. On the side were four slices of Goldbar Squash that was served with a bright puree; while I would have utilized a vegetable that would have provided more contrast, the squash was neatly roasted and helped balance the plate out.And, for dessert, I couldn't avoid Jean Georges'  famed Molten Chocolate Cake. It's a dish available at many of his restaurants throughout the city, and recollecting the times I had also ordered it at Nougatine and Jojo, I knew I would not be disappointed. There's not much that I need to say; after all, how can you go wrong with a cold scoop of vanilla ice creamed paired with a perfectly cooked molten chocolate cake? The inside seeps out at the break with the spoon, the chocolate interior is rich and smooth, but thankfully not overly sweet, and while it leaves a mess on the plate, it's well worth the effort it takes to eat it.Perry Street is a place that JGV should be proud to have in his empire; it's upscale and elegant without being pretentious, the food is delicious and flavorful, and the elements of French and Asian cuisine are seamlessly intertwined throughout the menu. Without a doubt, Cedric Vongerichten has done his father proud.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

The ginger rice bowl was rather simple,  at a glance looked like there were less than 10 ingredients. Looked light and simple, wasn't expecting too much but knew it was going to be delicious.  But OMG, it totally blew me far, far away with the flavors. I didn't even notice that it was a vegetarian dish,  it was so good I don't think I'd add meat even if that was an option. Honestly I've been raving about this dish for days to everyone I've encountered this week.  Everything else I tried from the tuna tartar to the strawberry sundae was top notch as well...  Truly this place was unbelievably incredible. I get the sense that every dish was crafted with well thought out flavors and combinations. Sometimes I dream about this place when I'm in that half asleep/ half awake state and think about the things that make me happy. On a side note, I've always wanted to be that person who has the job of painting a swish of spicy mayo on a fancy starter plate.

Since we came fairly early in the evening, we were seated right away, and the restaurant wasn't very crowded. We started with cocktails: the Vodka Thyme Lemonade for me and the Rhubarb Royale for mom. She loved the Rhubarb Royale - I was less impressed with the overly-sweet lemonade. We shared the House Made Burrata appetizer, and my mother had the Maine Shellfish a la Plancha for her entree while I had the Pan Seared Black Sea Bass. The food was absolutely the standout of the night - original, beautifully presented, perfectly executed, and absolutely delicious. All of the dishes were exquisitely interesting without compromising flavor, freshness, or quality. Unfortunately, our experience dining at Perry St was slightly marred when we paid our bill, half with a gift card and half with American Express. Our server accidentally overcharged us by $20, and instead of realizing his mistake when we brought it to his attention, he argued with my mother over it. She was right, of course, and he wound up correcting his mistake in the end, but it was truly unpleasant to go through that kind of discussion through no fault of our own.

Its Restaurant Week menu is by far the best I've ever seen. Definitely a great deal.Appetizers:+ Started with a baked potato soup amuse bouche - warm with a surprising spicy aftertaste!+ Salmon sashimi appetizer was good, the flavors complemented each other and the wasabi gave it a nice kick.+ The rice-cracker crusted tuna with yuzu-sriracha chili emulsion, which we ordered as an extra appetizer, was amazing! Very unique and delicious.Entrees:+ The hake with mushrooms with potatoes was good, but lacked the explosion of flavors of the previous dishes. The mushrooms, however, were very tasty.+ The fried chicken with rice & collard greens was perfectly cooked; the chicken was perfectly tender and the skin was perfectly crispy without being greasy. I was amazed - how do you pull that off? The collard greens were interesting, they tasted almost flowery.Dessert:+ Molten chocolate cake with ice cream was incredible. Best lava cake I've ever had.+ Profiteroles were very good.+ Two chocolate/green tea cake squares came with the check - they were heavy but delicious.The portions were pretty small (except for the fried chicken), but the desserts were huge, and by the end I was so stuffed I could barely walk. Service was great, very friendly, attentive, and timely. Decor and seating - beautiful. The only things I have to complain about are that the lighting was very dark (although I imagine it would be very bright during the day), and we were seated near the door, so a gust of cold air would hit us every time someone came in.With reasonable prices for such high-quality, complex dishes, Perry St is somewhere I would love to return to over and over again.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

When I got the check I saw the price difference. I asked the waitress what happened and the manager came told us that it was our fault not to look at the name of the wine. She said I should look at the wine carefully when the bottle was on the table and she did not apologize at all. I explained that we are not natives and we never had these two wine before; we are not sensitive with the wine names and we can't tell the difference. She kept repeating that we should pay for what we consumed and we should look at the wine more carefully.

If you're sitting in the right seat, you get a great view of the water and the doc. From a visual standpoint this place is 5 stars and a great place for a date. Foodwise, everything was delicious, with the standout actually being the old fashioned that i ordered..So I ordered an old fashioned made with Ron Zacapa dark rum and within 30 seconds the bartender personally came over to me and shook my hand out of respect for the fact that I chose to have my old fashioned with a higher end rum that most people don't usually order. We chatted it up for a few minutes before he left and made the actual drink. When it came out, it was the best old fashioned I'v ever had. Period. Hands down. On the food end, I started out with the rick cracker crusted tuna which was pretty good. But the standout was the Perry St, fried chicken that comes with a honey glaze. It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.. Delicious. I have a lot of respect for any restaurant that can master the art of making fried chicken into a non KFC tasting dish while also keeping all the hallmarks that make fried chicken delicious. Drinks were awesome, food was awesome and the atmosphere was great. This is an overall really cool place to come to for good food and trendy atmosphere.

My girlfriend and I ordered the tuna tartare and the fried calamari to start, followed by the ginger rice bowl and the bouchot mussels and clams for our entrees. The fried calamari comes with yuzu dipping sauce, which was a great change compared to the typical marinara sauce as it elevated your taste buds to a whole different level. For the egg lovers, you'll love the ginger rice bowl as the star of this dish was the crispy poached egg - runny yolk lovers unite! It takes a stroke of genius to get the egg to remain runny, while maintaining the crispiness of the panko bread crumbs on the outside.

Used Yelp to see what was around me at the moment and remembered hearing great things about Perry St. Looked at pictures and my mouth started to water up. My decision was made and headed on over.My boyfriend and I got there and we were the first ones there. The decor was very sophisticated and felt a bit underdressed. Nevertheless, nothing was said to us about our attire and were seated by the manager. Table setting was simple yet expressive. Menus were clean, readable, and a great amount of options of food and drinks. We didn't have to wait very long for our waiter, Henry, to come over and greet us.I like asking a lot of questions, and Henry was more than accommodating and pacient. He not only answered all of our questions but made some recommendations as well. Having great explanation skills, he convinced us in ordering some items and I'm very glad we did.Between my boyfriend and I, we shared three appetizers. The burrata, the mushrooms (highly recommend), and the grilled octopus (recommended to us which I too suggest you order). The burrata was refreshing, which I personally like to have in an appetizer, the mushrooms were juicy and full of flavor, and the octopus definitely had that charred grilled flavor accompanied with this awesome chipotle sauce giving it a nice spicy kick. All together a nice well rounded first course.It was time for our main course. My boyfriend ordered the perry chicken and I the black sea bass. We obviously shared and loved both. Again, all the sauces and flavors meshed very well. The sea bass was cooked to perfection. So juicy and tender as was the chicken. Finally, dessert! I'm not a big sweet tooth but I had to try something as everything was so good. That being said, two items were ordered for our final course. There was the mint and chocolate ice cream as well as the blood orange sorbet on top of a merengue with some grapefruit, orange, and blood orange slices. I personally don't like mint-chocolate combinations so I just ate the chocolate ice cream and I was in heaven. The little chocolate wafer balls created a great texture to the ice cream as well. The blood orange sorbet was also very good.Overall, great food, lovely decor, and knowledgable staff that make a lasting impression.

The appetizers of burrata and salmon carpaccio were good with the creamy burrata outshining the salmon which was too heavy on the horseradish. The fried chicken entree was unevenly cooked, with some pieces being too dry. I don't think the green sauce that came with it did much. The Jean Georges warm molten chocolate cake is one of my favorite desserts in the city and it delivered per usual.The service seemed a beat off even though the restaurant wasn't that busy. I kept seeing the waiter bringing out the dishes pause because the new silverware wasn't on our table yet. Then a different waiter would rush to put the new utensils in front of us.

The first time I went here I was amazed, service was great, food better and we stayed for hours ordering more food and drinks because it was so nice.   Last night the server and restaurant were clearly in over their heads.  We ordered cocktails and the waitress asked if we were ready to order at the same time.   We had been seated for about three minutes.   It was 9pm, so there was not going to be another seating - why rush.  We ordered one restaurant week item and a few things from the regular menu.   All three apps came out within one minute of ordering.  In other words, it was sitting in a similar fashion to McDonalds in the back ready to be served without thought.    The sashimi app was very tough, like worse than those 50% off sushi places tough.   Like it was just frozen tough.   The dish was nice looking, but anyone chef would have been Chopped if they served this on Food Network.  It had weird sorbet in the middle and then a coconut milk on it, it was just plain bad, weird, poorly thought out.  Remove that item from any and all menus, please, Perry St.The Tuna is always good, and it was no exception last night.   The duck was okay, but just okay.  The hake actually made me laugh when it was served.  It was the size of a business card folded in half.   I actually asked if that was normal and the waitress unintentionally insulted me by stating it is actually a good deal because I was getting a three course meal for the price of a regular dish, which really insinuated that I was showing up for a bargain and should be grateful that they even served my kind any fish (I kid).  The waitress was lost and asked if we wanted drinks half way through the main course after the were empty of about 15 minutes.  We said no, even though we asked for the drink menu, and she realize that she missed the timing.   Anyway, we asked for the check, left the dessert and got the hell out of there.   Thankfully we take things lightly and were able to laugh it off.   We spent about $350 the first time and half that this time, but it was probably worth closer to $50.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

Since it was only my boyfriend and I, we had one of each choice on the restaurant week menu. (There was only two choices per course). Everything was super flavorful. I had the salmon carpaccio as appetizer and my, my, it definitely took me by surprise. I had not see the sea salt that they had placed over the salmon. So, the salmon melted which created a sweet, sour and salty flavors. Additionally, the pink grapefruit sorbet was definitely a good combination with the cilantro chili seasoning. I then had the crispy fried chicken for my entree, which was so good that my mouth is a bit watery just thinking about it right now. It was buttery and the sauce was so flavorful! 10/10 would recommend and would definitely come back for this. For dessert, I had the almond cake with blood orange sorbet. It was definitely a good combination after having the salmon carpaccio. Last but not least, I had a raspberry lychee bellini for cocktail.

The dishes showed simplicity and restraint while maintaining good flavor. Molten chocolate cake was also great but didn't match the first two courses in elegance. My second visit was for the lunch pre fixe, in which the food items were not quite as mind-blowing as dinner, though the Perry St Fried Chicken dish is great. The service on that day by our waitress was very helpful and genuine. The hostess was attentive too.

She had the beef tenderloin which came out perfectly tender and I had the duck. Everything on both our plates worked in harmony with each other in order to create the perfect bite every single time. For dessert we had the apple pie which turned out amazing. The prices were high, but this was a special occasion. After our meal, looking at the bill didn't even matter.

Although the location is a bit out of the way and somewhat misleading (the entrance is actually on West Street and the building itself is surprisingly inconspicuous), the service and food were excellent. I could deduct half a point for lacking ambience (it kinda does feel a tiny bit like a bland hotel lobby), but oh well. Our table of six shared appetizers (sashimi, seared tuna, duck ravioli and burrata), all of which were very delicious. My personal favorite was the duck ravioli - just outstanding. On a side note, I wish the waiter had been more generous with the bread. One small slice a person only teased my tastebuds enough to want more. My waistline thanked him though.For dinner, I had the seared sea bass with a basil sauce and mushrooms - each ingredient was done to perfection and shows that an excellent dish does not need to have more than 5 ingredients. My husband had the beef tenderloin - also done perfectly with a wonderful seared crust. I had the most beautiful citrusy 2013 Pinot Noir from Oregon with all this - light, but not sweet or too overpowering.I wish I hadn't been too full for dessert, because it all sounded amazing. Next time I'll save space for the carrot cake. Someone else ordered the sundae, which was huge!This place wasn't cheap, so I'm glad someone else picked up the tab - absolutely worth a splurge though.

My friend is also new to the city so I thought I'd bring him out to some infamous West Village restaurants to experience NYC dining culture. Please keep in mind that my friend and I are both pretty adventurous foodies who are opened to any cuisine and dish. We are also the type to never leave food on our plates especially at a class of restaurant like Perry St. For appetizers, we ordered their calamari and special of the day- bay scallops with truffles. I'd have to say that their bay scallops were super fresh and complimented very well with a fresh squeeze of lemon juice and sea salt. I would not get this again though because of the price bump that the empty additive effect that truffles gave. The calamari was perfectly cooked and was paired very nicely with their lemon creamy sauce, but it was nothing special. As for our entrees, we ordered their roasted duck and sea bass. I followed the chef's recommendation and had be duck made medium rare. Who knew it would come out so rare! I've had a medium rare roasted duck before and it was one of the most unforgettable meats in my life. That was flavorful and juicy, this just tasted like a raw slab of meat. Also, it did not work well with the citrus and fennel on the side either since each item was placed separately in a ""stonehenge"" fashion. It was basically boring. The flavors and textures were awkwardly paired. So the dish just did not work for me. I thought the sea bass was also A-OK, also nothing special. Even though, it was perfectly seared, the dish still did not work. There was a green sauce that did nothing but bring a pop of color to my dish. I would only consider the side of mushroom as delicious only in the setting of my home, but not at a type of restaurant like Perry St since it was very bland. I guess we had our expectations a little bit too high for this restaurant. On the bright side, the ambience and service were very nice. We did not make any reservations, the hostess graciously seated right away on a Wednesday night at 6pm. So overall, this restaurant was only ""A-OK"" for me.

For my main dish I got the lamb chops , or they should have said lamb chop as there was only one of them with a side of slow cooked lamb all on top of white beans which had a smokey bacony flavor, I wasn't a fan.  Dessert was the best part, we shared a delicious molten chocolate cake with vanilla gelato.

His son, Cedric is the head chef in this nearly unassuming restaurant. We could barely find this place as it's located in what looked like the main level of a high rise condo builiding. The ambiance is very clean and relaxed despite the busy vibe of the place. Hostess was a bit snooty as we were about 15 mins late due to traffic. She made a big deal of it but really our table was for 815 pm on a Sunday evening and there were still a few tables available. Otherwise, our server was pretty laid back and friendly so that made up for the bad intro. I really enjoyed the Vodka Thyme Lemonade ($11) Skyy Citrus Vodka, Lemon, Thyme - excellent drink that was perfectly mixed. Rice Cracker Crusted Tuna Sriracha-Citrus Emulsion $19.50 is a signature dish. I thought it was ok since the sriacha overpowers the tuna. The Pan Seared Black Sea Bass ($34) - grilled Maitake Mushroom, Aromatic Basil Broth was perfectly cooked but on the salty side.  Butter Poached Lobster ($39) -  Lemongrass and Kaffir Lime Broth, Potato Ravioli was just touch over cooked which can be detrimental to lobster. It wasn't terribly rubbery but enough that it wasn't great and the dish was a tad cool in temperature. The kaffir lime broth was incredibly aromatic - felt like I was Thailand again.

It truly was a thing of beauty. It was also freaking delicious and that's what really counts at the end of the day. You know what else was super delicious? The seasonal White Asparagus, which were giant stalks that just fell apart in this delicious light sauce. The seasonal Softshell Crab was also oozing with some kind of delicious flavorful sauce. I thought the Rice Cracker Crusted Tuna was a bit overrated. The Sriracha-citrus emulsion that it came with was pretty good, but I thought the dish was still lacking flavor overall. I tried my a bit of my boyfriend's Pan Seared Black Sea Bass, which I found kind of dry. I also tried a bit of my boyfriend's mom's Perry St. Fried Chicken, which had a thin crispy skin, à la Korean fried chicken. Let's just say I was VERY happy with my Butter Poached Lobster choice. We split a Rhubarb and Lychee Trifle for dessert which was just light and fresh enough to cleanse the palate without making us feel obscenely full. They then came out with a chocolate petit four cake which was, as everyone agreed, divine. The restaurant is spacious and white, making it seem a bit cold and sparse in the light of day. Compared to the only other Jean-Georges restaurant I've been to, ABC Kitchen, it felt much less organic and more chic and modern. Once the sun set however, the lighting made the space feel much more intimate. The service is amazing and everything is considered.

219,1sxXLUKn6qCCVRJPhRNVYQ,Ken S.,4.0 star rating,"KenScale: 8.5/10Perry Street is a New American restaurant from the acclaimed chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten at a quiet corner of West Village run by his son Cedric. Jean-Georges' flagship restaurant Jean-Georges was one of the first restaurants that I visited when I first came to New York and it was definitely a mind-blowing experience. While my experiences at his other restaurants varied (I loved the casual spot Nougatine next to Jean-Georges and had solid but not amazing meals at ABC Kitchen and ABC Cocina), somehow Perry Street stayed under the radar. I finally decided to pay a visit, and was happy that the restaurant can stand alone as a great neighborhood spot with a lot of inventive and delicious dishes.FULL DISCLOSURE: My dining companion had a couple of friends working at the restaurant so we ended up getting some comped dishes. My grade reflects only the food that I actually paid for, although I will discuss my impressions with the comped dishes as well.Reflecting the style of Jean-Georges, who bases his dishes on French technique yet adopts a variety of influences from around the world, especially Asia, the dishes at Perry Street had the sophisticated elegance that was not however bound by any particular boundaries. For starters, I had rice cracker crusted tuna with sriracha-citrus emulsion and grilled Spanish octopus with hibiscus romesco sauce, potatoes and pickled peppers. Tuna was a light and delightful dish with tender texture, while I loved the combination of the spicy sauce with the octopus. The restaurant also comped New Zealand snapper sashimi with lemon, olive oil and crispy skin (a citrusy dish that was also deliciously light) and roasted asparagus with wild herbs (a very solid vegetable dish as well). I probably was a little more impressed with the starters than the main dishes. Both the grilled loin and crispy leg of rabbit and pan seared black sea bass came away slightly too salty than I would've preferred, although each dish had its own charm, from the really good texture of the meat to the huge (and awesome) grlled maitake mushroom that accompanied the sea bass next to very flavorful basil broth. For dessert, I went with the molten chocolate cake (a signature Jean-Georges dish that was just melting in my mouth without control) and white chocolate pavlova (a winner among the desserts with awesome flavor that was not overly too sweet in combination with yuzu sorbet and basil syrup). The restaurant comped creme fraiche cheesecake with marmalade and blood orange sorbet, another tasty dish that was thoughtful and well-prepared. The restaurant, located on the corner of a quieter and wealthier side of West Village next to the highway, has a feel of a more mature, classy place, with older crowds in blazers rather than hip, younger people. It has a full bar with an extensive wine and cocktail menu. Getting a reservation isn't particularly hard as long as you book the table several days in advance.

221,1DJzN5naN862avy_jliQHw,Martin W.,3.0 star rating,"We went for Restaurant Week, which means for a set price, you can sample an appetizer, entree and dessert. Some places do this better than others, and I would say after leaving Perry St. this was not one of those places. Nothing on the Restaurant Week menu was actually on the real menu. In fact, it was rather boring -- including such unoriginal creations as a peach salad and molten chocolate cake for dessert. My appetizer, the salmon sushimi, was very good. The peach salad was what you thought it would be -- good but not fitting for the type of restaurant this was supposed to be. The hake entree was plain tasting -- very little flavor and bland. The crispy short rib entree was decent with good flavor, but it seems they decided to flash fry the short rib, making the taste of fried oil apparent in the flavor. The caramelized crepe cake was good. Overall, a bit disappointed. Food was good, but not impressive. The idea of Restaurant Week is to get people out of their comfort zone and out to try new restaurants -- preferably yours. If they like it during Restaurant Week, they may come back for more at regular price. Unfortunately, Perry St. went in a different direction increasingly common -- subpar, not on the menu options that leave the customer confused at best as to whether he/she should return. I might come back to Perry St. Service was excellent, and ambiance was decent. That said, there are a lot of restaurants in NY, so maybe not.

The acoustics of this restaurant are amazing- even with the open concept layout, high ceiling, glass floor-to-ceiling windows, your dinning will feel intimate. The staff is extremely well trained, smart and warm. The waiter, David, treated us as impeccable.The restaurant week menu, highly recommended. I chose the burrata and my friend had the salmon carpaccio. We were immediately impressed! The buratta first bite was perfection: tart, spicy, creamy, crunchy. Why? Go try it. We both had the fish- I was pleasantly surprised to see mashed potatoes as the carb. In a dish that is so well composed to bring a comfort food element felt very welcomed. It also showed confidence, which I'm sure chef Jean-Georges does not lack. Let's say we almost fought over the last piece of desert. The Sancerre was a beautiful compliment to the food and a pleasure on it's own. We were not pressured to immediately leave after we finished our dinner.

How lucky was I that after finding parking directly in front of this place on not only on my first visit, but also on the third and fourth occasions, I casually walked in, found a seat at the bar and then came to the realization that I must be at one of those, '...oh, you must check it out..' kind of restaurants. I love the modern, sleek ambience and the, 'you have to try to look like a model in order to work here', staff. The hostess', waitstaff and bartenders have always been friendly, professional and on point. I had my first Burratta experience here. I didn't know what to make of it at first, because I was still expecting a regular mozzarella type dish, but instead had this cheese which had a firm skin exterior with a runny, creamy interior, served with some sort of salad. Needless to say it was a tasty experience. I've also had the crispy poached egg caviar main course and the ginger rice bowl, numerous times, plus a salmon dish, the calamari, the chilean sea bass and for dessert the berry soup, molten chocolate cake and a sorbet. All of which have been sublime and consistently great. And there's always some sort of amuse bouche presented at every meal.

The location was a little hard to find since it isn't actually in Perry street but it's a nice looking restaurant. We ordered drinks, I had something strong which was good but I don't recall exactly what it was. My fiancé had the lemonade with thyme which I thought was really tasty and quite inviting with the fresh sprig of thyme. I don't care for asparagus so I asked if they could replace the two items with asparagus on the tasting menu.  The first course was a salad which was quite good even sans asparagus. The second offering was a fish course, it was also prepared perfectly and good. The third was the lamb course and that was really good. It had some type of wasabi pea purée that complimented the lamb perfectly.The dessert was a chocolate pudding with cream and crystallized violets.

The food was delicious, we ordered every single main dish and almost all of the appetizers. High notes included the burrata, lamb, and monkfish. My complaint is, being that it is a Jean-Georges restaurant, the food is only one part of the dining experience, service place another huge part and their service was sub par. We had to flag our waiter down all evening. He was rude, not knowledgeable about anything, couldn't take our order unless we all spoke in turn, one after another, otherwise he would be confused as to where our dishes would go. Took forever to get the check, which they initially gave us the wrong one and we were honest and told them it was a mistake even though our tab was over double the one they gave us. Once they finally rectified the situation, the waiter came back, didn't even hand the bill to anyone, but dropped it in the middle of the table.

More often than not, they make me even more disappointed in the restaurant/food, but at Perry St, this was not the case. We actually came out more impressed!The entrance FACES the West Side Highway! Like many many others, I walked into the apartment next door, and when I asked the doorman if he knew where the Perry St restaurant was, he actually said that he had no idea. Maybe his first day on the job?I was the first of our party to arrive and the bar snacks were too far out of my reach (I was really tired!). So I pretended to seriously peruse the drinks menu at the bar. When the final fourth person arrived, we were seated (IMO) at the best seats in the house - a crescent-shaped booth in the front!The food was absolutely exquisite. Although the RW menu was limited, we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. We were teased by a faintly spicy cantaloupe drink for the amuse bouche. The Gazpacho Tomato soup turned out to be my favorite of the night -- I absolutely loved the little spicy kick at the end (again) and was wowed by the incredibly fresh ingredients (cucumber, cantaloupe, pineapple, watermelon, and the tomatoes!). To me, this dish spoke volumes about the subtle elegance of the vision at Perry St. The tomatoes were the clear soloists in this concerto (dish), but everything else eagerly supported them in the background, like orchestral musicians that have very specific roles at calculated moments. I did not have another grand artistic epiphany while enjoying the hake (pronounced hāk), but it was certainly no less superb. The star of this dish was the perfectly cooked, flakey hake, but supporting characters include the creamy mashed potatoes and the dash of yuzu.The Lavender Poundcake dessert with corn ice cream and blueberries unfortunately ended an overall lovely dinner on a weak note, as the dessert appeared to be three separate ingredients just tossed together with little motive. The corn ice cream was interesting, and the poundcake had a good proportion of lavender flavoring (not too soapy), but the blueberries tasted like they came straight from a can. Thankfully, the tiny chocolate and green tea cake petit fours finished the meal sweetly.Knowing that we were coming during Restaurant Week, I came in with no expectations. But from the top-notch service (despite that we were RW diners) and the subtly elegant food, this was definitely one of the best RW experiences I've had to date. Having said that, this makes me all the more eager to return to Perry St to try the rest of their menu. Until next time!",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

The entrance is right by the west side highway in greenwich village, giving you a nice view of Jersey from the interior ;). We were sat swiftly, and the interior while well put together had a mix of art-deco and white corporate going on.. nevertheless, the waitress was quick to bring us the menus and we dug right in with our restaurant week choices. All of us ordered the same 3 items. For the appetizer we had the salmon sasihmi with jalapenos, and cilantro-chili Oil. It actually worked pretty well with the jalapenos, I cant handle much spice but a little on each piece was a nice addition, It wasn't a huge serving but well presented on the plate. The entree was a Parmesan crusted pork Loin with broccoli Rabe and was quite tasty and savory. The breaded crust totally made the pork dish work. The desert may have been the best I've had yet during restaurant week! A savory warm slice of  Molten Chocolate with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I made sure to eat it slowly to enjoy it, and was glad I did :). The service was quick and I am glad I came in.

I'm a huge foodie and was really looking forward to it; even though I didn't have anyone to go with I still wanted to try it, and wanted the 'whole experience' so booked a table for one.Unfortunately I left mid meal embarrassed and very dissapointed. 1) took them over 30 mins to seat me (1:45 pm reservation on a Monday). 2) they were out of the caviar dish. No problem, I can deal with the first two as I wasn't in a rush and understand things happen. The next two really put me over the edge...3) the server (not the main one) didn't have the consideration to serve my appetizer from the front of the table (he literally stretched over the back of a booth from the busy hallway not even in the dining room and literally threw it down. It literally scared the heck out of me.4) this was the absolute shocker... Mid-bite during my entree, someone (the Somm or the mgr), came up and asked me to move tables because they had to sit a party of three next to me and ""had poor planning."" First of all, I have never been asked to move tables in a fine dining establishment to accomodate someone else- it's something you'd expect at your local casual bar. Second- I was not taking my time, I was eating very quickly, and was prepared to drop cash (my check would have been the price of a normal two top if they hadn't run out of caviar). I'm certain they wouldn't have asked me to move if I was with another person. Lastly, you make me wait to be seated for over 30 mins yet make me move so someone else doesn't have to wait to be seated? I'm literally mid-bite... If you're going to ask (which to me is pretty unacceptable), think about your timing.Needless to say I moved tables, blushing, while other diners stared, didn't take another bite, asked for the check without finishing my meal or my $20+ glass of wine, sad and just really embarrassed.

240,Q8KEm9D4tb42o7MT00DSmA,Sara L.,5.0 star rating,"Yes, the momentous 300th review! West Village gem, Perry Street, is one of many Jean-Georges restaurants in the city. It is an experience certainly worth noting. The food, atmosphere, and service can be described as simply spectacular. For those who want a special, finer dining experience, consider Perry Street on your list. Connected to the beautiful Richard Meier Towers complex, adjacent to the West Side highway, one can have amazing views of the Hudson River from across. The interior of Perry Street emanates ultra chic. A modern design of clean white and light tan furniture, wide open layout, wall to wall windows, concrete pillars, overhanging light fixtures, provides a very refined, sophisticated yet still rather casual environment for any sort of meetup. A polished appearance, while the ambiance and their service is welcoming. Wanting to take advantage of Restaurant Week at Perry Street, the four of us made a reservation here for a Thursday evening. The restaurant was full and pleasantly packed that night. Our seating arrangement made at a wide, circular table across from the main bar was perhaps one of the best seats in the house. The Restaurant Week special involved a 3-course pre-fixe dinner ($38) with two different options for each course. Our choice for main was between the Crispy Fried Chicken in Scotch Bonnet Sauce or the Pan Roasted Hake. Appetizer was a choice of Gazpacho Tomato Soup or Beet Salad with Goat Cheese and Mango Vinagrette. And lastly, for dessert, Lavendar Poundcake or Molten Chocolate Cake. I went with the Beet Salad, Hake, and Lavendar Poundcake. For drinks, a special of the day, the Cantaloupe Martini. Complimentary servings of bread and delicious, refreshing amuse-bouche were also distributed to us at the start.The Cantaloupe Martini with a garnish of cucumber was strong but still quite tasteful and refreshing. Certainly, it was not as sweet as I had anticipated and more on the tarty side. The beet salad was a pleasant surprise. The beets, a resemblance to pears, was not your typical beets per say. Topped with a light vinaigrette dressing, mixed with arugula, goat cheese, wasabi, and walnut bits, this was an excellent starter. The subtle hints of wasabi provided an unexpected kick in contrast to the complex levels of sweetness, and it clearly demonstrated an influence of Asian cuisine. The Hake was very delicate, flaky, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. A savory dish settled on top of a sauce base, the addition of wasabi bits, again, aroused an unexpected kick. It was the subtle hints of spice that made the food so much more interesting. An anticipation was being built with each and every bite. The Lavendar Poundcake with a side of blueberries and vanilla ice cream, was a sweet and delicious end to it all. What I immediately noted of all these dishes though was the artful, creative, and careful presentation. The plating is what you'd call minimal, and there was a clear attention to detail that made our meals all the more appetizing and appealing. My first time at Perry Street was excellent. The experience was near flawless from start to finish, and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute. It's a very refined and considerably more upscale venue, but I would certainly return again, whether for a special occasion or otherwise. The Restaurant Week special was fantastic, and it was perhaps one of the best that I've experienced in the city.

I don't like cheese and David went out of his way to accommodate me (he split our truffle pasta with Parmesan into two portions--one with cheese and one without and brought me an amouse bouche without cheese. Thank you!)What we got:One taste of Perry St., which includes:-Rice Cracker Crusted Tuna-Roasted Fall Vegetables and Fruits-Pan Seared Black Sea Bass-Grilled Lamb Chops-Chocolate Pudding with Candied Violets + an order of the tagliatelle with white truffles and an organic eggand the Butter Poached Lobster entree.Yum!We also got a few decent cocktails including the raspberry lychee bellini, the dark and stormy and a special cider. Our favorites by far were the rice cracker crusted tuna, the lobster and the lamb chops.The tuna dish was unique and so flavorful. The lobster portion was generous and I really liked the broth and potato ravioli it came with. The lamb chops were tender and juicy.The sea bass was a little bit too fishy for my taste and I thought the tagliatelle was overcooked. I really like my pasta al dente and felt that this dish would have been much stronger if it were cooked as so.Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to others, but have no strong desire to come back any time soon as there are a ton of other fabulous restaurants I want to try and no dishes left me truly salivating for more.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

We had talked up the restaurant dining experience big time to them given the excellent food and service that we were given in our prior visits. But this one was a bust!We came in promptly for our 8.30pm reservation time but had to wait for 40 minutes to get seated. Apparently the table for us had guests who were on their desserts and were about to pay the bill. As always the hostess was very nice and apologized to us about the wait and gave the specific reason for the delay but I still think 40 min was way too long whatever the reasoning is. In the past, for a long wait at a restaurant of their stature, they at least buy a round of free drinks but nothing was offered to us.Our appetizers were great. However, the entrees at least for me left a lot to be desired. I am Vegan and they don't really have much on the menu for me. However, in the past we found that they either have a vegetable + tofu dish off menu or they can substitute tofu for fish from any other dish on the menu. I opted to get the vegetable + tofu dish but was told soon after placing our order that they were out of tofu. Once my dish arrived, it was longing for flavor and felt like a novice chef threw a bunch of beans together with some vegetables and called it a day.Finally when the time came for desserts, turns out they were out of our favorite dessert on the menu as well.

Everything was fine until they started to rush us through our meal. Others around us had been there before us and were there after we left. It started with the waiter pushing us to order food immediately after ordering drinks to our courses rolling in - one on top of another - like Lucy & Ethel in the candy factory. A quick toast and drink sip later, we had the first plate on our table. We looked at each other wondering what was going on here. But we were determined to enjoy the evening. The waiter must have noticed our eye contact. He assured us that our food and service would not be rushed. But it was. Later, during desert and coffee, a hostess checked our progress, while pretending to make sure our table was clear (demonstrated by picking up an empty sweetener packet. She then left without acknowledging our existence - guess she intuited our happiness or she really needed that table - NOW!). And then, just two minutes later some overly grinning, sweaty guy puts his almost-disembodied head on my husband's left shoulder and asks if we liked everything (yes, we said), and could he bring our check (we didn't have time to answer). We were finishing our coffee and wanted to enjoy a few moments with each other. The check was plopped on our table. My coffee cup and saucer were removed - I would have liked a second cup, but no one asked. We had a bare table, except for the small leather check holder (hint, hint).We didn't want to ruin the evening by being upset - but we were.I used to bring a lot of clients there for lunch and dinner - USED TO.

It may sound odd to some people, but at $150/head, it was a good value.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

The food was good, but I am only giving four stars because the apps and dessert were really good, but I think the dinner was lacking. I had the lamb chops, which were perfectly cooked, but flavor of the meat and beans were lacking. My wife had the lobster and again, well cooked, but the flavor needed more.

It went really well with the grainy mustard and the wild mushrooms. I'd like to say the potato gratin was perfect. My girlfriend ordered the Butter Poached Lobster. This dish had a Thai feeling to it. It was definitely the Lemongrass and lime broth. Together, it was just a huge flavor bomb exploding in your mouth. The lobster was cooked perfectly.

I called Perry again, but she did said this is the amount I agreed and signed. I told her that I am not happy with the service at all, so that I can only pay for the food but no more tips.

The opportunity presented itself this past week when we decided to have an impromptu date night & they were able to get us in without a reservation. Needless to say it's now three days later & I am still thinking about how wonderful it was. The ambiance is elegant, romantic, & peaceful. The restaurant has a hotel quality to it, boasting lovely views of the Hudson River. My husband & I had a ton of privacy in our comfortable booth & enjoyed not having to share our personal space with other diners (certainly a luxury in these parts). It is the perfect place for a date. Service was efficient & friendly throughout. The staff was very warm, welcoming, & attentive. We appreciated the pace of the food/service; time was not dragging but we didn't feel rushed either. We were really able to enjoy our conversation while we were eating. Most importantly, the food was superb. The careful attention paid to showcasing the flavors was evident, my palette could not have been more pleased. When we first sat down we were offered a complimentary taste of tuna tartar which was delicious, fresh, & had a bit of a kick. I knew then & there this meal would be a good one. To start we had the foie gras & sweet potato appetizer special, the calamari with sesame & yuku sauce, & the burrata. The portions read more like small plates or tapas which is why we chose three items & shared them. One was more outstanding than the next. For dinner I chose the poached lobster with potato ravioli which was heavenly; hubby selected the sea bass with mushroom & basil broth that was also delectable. With wine & tip, our bill rounded out to $200 which is very reasonable. it was worth every cent (if not more!)Perry Street met & exceeded our expectations!

278,3kb7r-rY0GPBrjIK5zaXFg,Koty W.,5.0 star rating,"This restaurant was the definition of a dimly lit restaurant. 90% of the light source came from the little candles placed on the tables! I believe the lighting was intentionally placed that way to increase the intimacy by allowing the small candle to illuminate customer's faces. The restaurant boasted large windows surrounding the building and at night the drapes are pulled down, giving more privacy but designed well enough to allow customers to see outside through the fairly sized slits. We were kindly seated in the tables for two near the entrance in this sleek modernistic restaurant. Naturally, like any new 21-year-old, they flock to the drink menu! Cocktails, wines, champagne, they have it all, including home-brewed Jean-Georges Soda! She got the Vodka-Thyme Lemonade, and I joined in with a Cherry-Yuzu Old Fashioned. I am not a fan of alcohol, but for all the alcoholics out there, this drink was fairly strong with a good amount of bourbon in it. Moving on the main meal, my friend only ordered the Carmelized Beef Tenderloin(wow), while I went for the Taste of Perry St. The Taste of Perry St. was a four dish course that included a dessert at the end, but before our main meals came out, a waiter brought us two shots of French Onion Soup that was complimentary from the chef (everyone got one I think). WOW! This was amazing! The flavor was very powerful, and I honestly believe that serving it in a shot glass was a way to accentuate the taste. Not only did it come hot, it came in a unique presentation.The first dish of the Taste of Perry St. was the simple Rice Cracker Tuna. This dish was a fatty piece of tuna that was crusted with rice cracker or whatever they used. It had a very basic taste to it and the flavoring was well-balanced. I believe that French cuisine is set up in an intricate and thoughtful manner. The dish order places a significant role in bringing out the flavoring for each dish. The Rice Cracker Tuna was a set up to introduce the next dish, the King Oyster Mushroom and Avocado Carpaccio. Now this was a very interesting dish. Slices of mushroom that were placed over slices of avocado, garnished with lime and jalapeno oil. At first I did not know that there would be jalapeno oil in this dish, but right before I was going to finish a delicious slice of mushroom, I started tasting spicy in my mouth. Now we all know that mushrooms and avocados provide a basic flavor, so when a hint of sour hit me in the middle and a kick of spicy came at the end, I realized that these dishes were carefully planned out. The contrasting elements of the tuna and a mushroom definitely highlighted each other's traits more. I never tasted something so intricate and now I finally think I understand a little bit of French style cuisine. With this in mind, I was looking forward to the slow Cooked Atlantic Salmon. The plate looked fancy, but the salmon wasn't anything to rave about. Neither were the brussel sprouts. Although the presentation was great, I was ready for the next dish. At this time, my friend's meal, the beef tenderloin, came out. I had a small piece and it was simple yet delightful. It was cooked medium and had a very medium-like texture. As weird as that sounds, I am trying to say that it was easy to bite into and chew, unlike many places that screw it up. Even more weird is that I believe she enjoyed the carrots more than the beef.The best dish of the night hands down was the Grilled Lamb Chop! This was AMAZING! A piece of lamb chop with bone-in, over olive oil (I believe) and tomato marmalade. The lamb was VERY easy to bite into and chew and as a result the juiciness paired extremely well with the flavoring. From my memory, I can recall it being lightly salted with another after tasting flavoring. Sorry readers, I forgot what it was like but trust me, it was amazing! My friend who doesn't even like lamb agreed that it was really good. If you're used to Chinese or Afghan style lamb, you gotta try this one! It is distinctly unique.With every new course that came, our kitchen ware was replaced. I believe the reason for this is so that the previous flavors of the dish before doesn't contaminate the flavors presented on the next plate. Water was also constantly being replaced. I didn't remember a time ever when my glass was half full (optimist here). The last thing of the night to arrive was the chocolate pudding. My friend had the first bite because I was sick, and she said wow this is different.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"
279,o9ooI25bdChExnRlZCYH1A,Leslie D.,4.0 star rating,"I'm pretty ashamed to say this is the only Summer Restaurant Week 2012 meal I had... but I can forgive myself since Perry St was actually pretty amazing.The restaurants exudes a lovely ambiance and you can make out the water from every table in the dining room. Everything is posh with a more sophisticated, older crowd and I for once felt a little embarrassed of how I was dressed as I had just come from the gym. Very smart waitstaff... and I mean smart as in how they were dressed and presented, not their IQ. No offense but how could our waitress not know what a Manhattan cocktail was? When one of my party asked her for this quintessential drink, the girl looked at her and said ""A Manhattan? Uhh... Is that on our cocktail menu?"" Someone educate this poor thing ASAP before an alcoholic attacks her!Other than that slight abnormality, the rest of the meal went smoothly.A waiter came around distributing bread for each patron individually. I love it when restaurants do it because it gives me a real sense of ownership of my bread. Yes I'm territorial over my food and I will bite your hand off if it comes near my bread rolls. I elected to have the wheat bread which was soft on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The cylindrical cut of butter was of course at room temperate and was perfectly dreamy. God I love circular shaped butter.Although we were RW diners, Perry St did not discriminate. From the chef, my table was given an amuse bouche of corn fritters with a tangy remoulade sauce. This was definitely a sign of good things to come. For my appetizer I chose the sauteed shrimp with crispy baby artichokes, garlic puree and paprika. The shrimp were sweet and everything tasted fresh. I didn't really taste any garlic but the sauce was still scrumptious. Presentation as you can see from my photos was nice.For my main, I went with the meat choice and I wasn't in the mood for salmon. Sadly/annoyingly, Perry St only gives you two choices for each course for RW (boooo). I'll let it slide this one time since I enjoyed it. My entree was Crackling Short Rib with heirloom tomatoes and cheddar aged polenta. Wowie wow wow! The short rib was so tender on the inside but with a delectably crunchy texture on the outside. The meat was laid on top a bed of thinly sliced heirloom tomatoes which alternated in colors. Such a treat.For dessert, I (not) surprisingly chose the molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. I mean, I can't really say that much about this dish except that it made me crave milk like none other. Thick chocolate cake + gooey chocolaty center + ice cream = taste bud heaven.Obviously I enjoyed our meal here and would like to come back soon. I'll wait till I have a little bit more cash in the bank  though as this place ain't cheap. I mean, look at its neighborhood. You can't walk 10 feet without almost tripping over some designer dog.And yes, I was one of those people that accidentally went into the apartment building with the same number next door.

We also ordered the citrus risotto with uni, the butter poached lobster with lemongrass kaffir lime sauce and I had the cripsy fried chicken with the scotch bonnet sauce with wild rice.

It's not oily compared to other fried chicken you would get at other restaurants, one thing I would like more is the scotch bonnet sauce!!  We ended with a passion fruit souffle and a passion fruit sorbet. This dessert took about 13 minutes but it was well worth it! The sorbet was too tart for me but my boyfriend loved it since he hate sweets.

I had the winter tasting menu of calamari (app), mussels (main), and the lava cake. None of the food came out super hot but I didn't bother sending back (aka it was cold within 5 minutes of being served). Calamari was standard calamari. The mussels were served in a dish that made it really hard to get the broth out of. Also, there was not a lot of broth to begin with (maybe a quarter cup) so I found myself having to tip the bowl to get broth for every single mussel. The broth and mussels were tasty regardless. Fries were over salted. My friend had bacon which was great. Her breakfast potatoes were also great. Chocolate lava cake was like 95% lava and 5% cake.  I wish it were more cake-y but that's just a personal preference. I had the vodka thyme lemonade which was very good.The service was so/so. It took a long time to take our order and a very long time to get our coffee/tea. I had to ask twice for milk for my tea. And we had to ask twice for a cocktail menu. Also there was chocolate smeared on the side of the table from previous diners which got all over my hands. That was super gross.

When we first sat down, she didn't hand the menus to the ladies first but just handed them out clockwise.  That was the same for her ordering taking.  No ladies first.  I'm being critical on this but just an observation.3. She never came back to ask how our meal was.  And if she had, we would have told her it wasn't that great.4.

These 2 are my repeat items as I never tire of their genius/brilliance in balance and quality.Actually I was in Paris and saw a video of John Georges demonstrating the Tuna dish preparation in front of an assortment of high caliber french chefs..they applauded him..

All of the flavors were super well-balanced, and the fish was cooked perfectly. Think crispy skin, flaky meat -- with a light, basil sauce that really complimented the richness of the fish.

299,2Vid25RncNcgcCTvMqi0Pw,Stacey S.,3.0 star rating,"3.5 stars for my visually mouthwatering plates that didn't quite deliver on the palate. Came here for lunch with some colleagues on a Friday. The light and airy decor against the backdrop of a sunny July afternoon gave this space a spa-like feel. Other than our party of six, there were only a handful of people. I don't remember if there was music... I do remember it was easy for us to hear one another... as well as overhear the conversations of the few others around us.I had the crispy poached eggs as my appetizer. It came with caviar and vodka cream sauce. It was perfectly presented and I even got a food-porn shot of it with my iphone. Alas though, it looked better than it tasted. And while the meal was paid for by the firm, at around $30, I'd say my appetizer probably wasn't worth the price. The eggs were cold and slightly more runny than I would have preferred, which, I think, did a disservice to the caviar.For my entree, I had the grilled lamb chops with crispy artichokes and black olives. Again, it looked superb on the plate but taste-wise, it was rather ordinary. I wouldn't say it was forgettable.. but only because I remember the lamb being a bit on the fatty side and thinking to myself that the calories were not worthwhile.For dessert, I had the pavlova. The server's description of it involved yuzu, shiso, and white chocolate. I thought it sounded light and savory... and, well, light, it was... savory, not so much. The combination of the flavors were somewhat lost on me... and after the first two courses, I was neither surprised nor disappointed (expectations not being very high at this point).It seems that the others at the table had ordered better than I did though. The rice cracker crusted tuna looked delicious and I'm told it delivered on the taste as well. A few at the table ordered the butter poached lobster, which I tasted... and, it was definitely more pleasing to the taste buds than my lamb.Final thoughts:  overpriced and out of the way; but it's name brand and pretty",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

A squad car was chillin out front and bright blue and red ghosts had a party on the super chic modern white walls. This induced a headache which the Thyme Lemonade and Winter Pimm's quickly doctored.We sat 5 people in one of those round tables (which could probably fit 7 if you ask nicely) with a comfy white C-shaped booth that the middle person has to bounce and slide his way into. The servers walk behind these, which came as a surprise, since the tall seatback had created the illusion that we were right up against the window/wall. Staff also attempted to refill our water glasses this way, to varying degrees of splashiness/success. Food seemed precisely plated, but taste-wise there was nothing remarkably good. We had chicken and dill soup, an unexpectedly too-spicy roasted hake (sweet potato, leek fondue, rosemary-ginger vinaigrette), and very salty short ribs. The banana cake with salted caramel ice cream was a bit dry.Overall we enjoyed this dinner in good company but will probably pick one of JG's other restaurants for next time.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

I definitely recommend their spanish octopus. Cooked to perfection. Our entrées fell a notch. The butter poached lobster comes with a lemon sauce or should I say it drowns my lobster. High content of acidity that it overwhelms any taste of the lobster. It compliments the potato ravioli it comes with but the butter poached lobster is the main component so it was a bit of a let down. Sea bass was on par with any other restaurant for us... For someone with reservations, they sat us right next to the door and then ended up giving the table next to us to some very loud and demanding costumers who left after an argument with their server and manager. Overall the atmosphere definitely sucked. Those of you who've been to this restaurant can understand how close these 2 tables are so it was very aggravating to say the least.Our cocktails were warm...

I particularly loved the fresh and crispy peas in pods which were also pleasing on the eyes. For entree we had the lamb chop and salmon.  Though not as impressive as appetizers they were still delicious.  Again the pea puree on the salmon dish was really superb. We did not have any dessert.The cocktails however were not in the same calibre as the food. We tried 3 different cocktails and there was nothing special to write home about.  I was also a little annoyed that it takes them a long time to prepare drinks.  Many tables seemed to be waiting for their drinks more than they should. Wine would probably be a better choice. The service was very attentive and friendly, but did not feel professional as you'd expect at a JG restaurant.

Great food, great options, great price. Highly recommended.The steak tartare was simply divine. Smooth, rich, and perfectly seasoned with a touch of heat. It was a joy to eat. The simply grilled yellowfin tuna burger was very good and cooked perfectly medium rare. It was a great light spring dish, but it needed a touch of salt. In contrast, the chips served with the burger were way too salty and I couldn't eat them. Desserts were of similarly high quality. The molten chocolate cake was luscious and devoured within seconds, and the lemon meringue was beautifully presented and managed to not be too tart.Service was awesome. I loved our waitress, who was very kind and knowledgeable about the entire menu. Also, the restaurant itself is very simply designed, but still beautiful. A lot of white with clean edges.

We accepted the offer and kept munching on their delicious bar treats until our table was ready.First and foremost, I am so pleased at how flexible they are with how you decide to order - especially since we came during restaurant week. Most restaurants make it mandatory that the whole table participates in the RW menu, but not here. We were able to order 2 RW menu's and 1 of the 'Taste of Perry St' tasings between 4 people! This way we were able to try everything on both tasting menus. Additionally we added the fried chicken since we heard such good things.Everything was delicious! Some of my favorites were the:Rice Cracker Crusted Tuna: love the crunch of the rice cracker with every bite of the fresh tuna.. the sriracha-citrus emulsion added the perfect kick.Slow cooked Salmon: definitely slow cooked. this was the most tender piece of salmon I've ever tasted in my mouth.. melted like chocolate.Market Beets and Pears: Love the pairing of beets with pears.. with a hint of sweet from the honey and a punch of citrus from the lime.. so whimsical and tasty.Superb service and modern decor- the C-shaped booths were comfortable and roomy.. our whole party had an amazing time and will be back for more!",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

I am not normally a huge salmon eater but I knew I was going out for dinner and didn't want a heavy meal. A couple of the girls had the fried chicken, which is a house specialty. They raved about it.

As a Jean-Georges restaurant, this restaurant is amazingly clean down to the decor, but still laid back enough that you can come here dressed semi-casual. Once you walk into this restaurant, you're transformed into a restaurant that's great for a date, or just a nice little birthday celebration. The noise level is low, lights are dim, and you get a decent view of the Hudson depending on where you sit. For starters, we decided to go with the:- Crispy Calamari: California Yuzu Dipping Sauce, Sesame Seeds ($15)- Rice Cracker Crusted Tuna: Sriracha-Citrus Emulsion ($19.5)Out of those two, I'd definitely go with the calamari over the tuna. The calamari had an incredibly light batter, wasn't overly oily, and when complemented with the yuzu dipping sauce, created an amazing flavor combination. The tuna was alright, but then again, it didn't wow me as a dish that I would order again.As entrees, we ended up ordering:- Caramelized Beef Tenderloin: Green Chili Sauce, Summer Squash, Basil ($36)- Pan-Roasted Veal Loin with Parmesan Jus: Wilted Seasonal Greens and Mashed Potatoes ($34)I personally enjoyed my veal a lot. It wasn't cooked too well done, and had just the right amount of redness in the meat. The outside had a nice little crunch to it from being roasted on the pan, and the parmesean jus complemented it perfectly. Greens were greens, and the mashed potatoes were also pretty decent. As far as the steak goes, I thought the green chili sauce was pretty interesting. Not sure if it fits my palate completely, but the steak was very nicely cooked.After a hearty meal, only one thing can complete you, and that is dessert. - White Chocolate Pavlova: Yuzu Sorbet and Basil Syrup ($11)i actually didn't really care for this dessert. Sure the yuzu sorbet was solid, but the pavlova itself was just kind of mediocre in the end.  I will say that their cocktails here have a pretty good kick. I ordered the Manhattan, and I must say, it was nice and strong. In total, with food and drinks, the bill came out to be just around $175 for two people. Not too bad if I must say. What gives this place that extra kick is that Perry St is located right next to the Hudson River Park. That means, that before/after your meal, you can walk across the street, and have a great view of Jersey or sit down on the benches to hang out. Perry St is yet another amazing restaurant in the West Village. It's nice and intimate, far enough from the hustle and bustle of the city, and at the same time, they serve up some amazing food.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

328,EQPgp_WluL6Ufl7KZ7S0Sw,Dan R.,4.0 star rating,"Perry St is kind of like that fancy, off-limits living room at your parents' rich friends' house. You know, the one covered in white furniture, the one that is used exclusively in the presence of company, the one that is closed off and sealed shut like that pop-up medical facility they used to quarantine E.T. for whenever their spoiled brat teenage kids throw house parties. You know, the one that's just ""for show"".So, of course, everything here is very modern, clean, simple, proper, and maybe just a bit stiff. Still, as such ambiance is to be expected, so is excellent American-French fusion cuisine.And in speaking to this, Perry St is absolutely one of those restaurants where everything seems to just jump off the menu, thereby making any sort of decision that much more challenging. Arctic Char Sashimi or Rice Cracker Crusted Tuna? Sweet Pea Soup or Chilled Peekytoe Crab Salad? Char-Grilled Cheeseburger or Organic Fried Chicken? See what I mean? Plus, when seated with a big group in the corner booth, the last thing anyone wants is food envy. The ordering process starts silent, faces in unfolded menus, until a crescendo of conversation slowly builds and suddenly everyone's lunch picks are determined by communal election.And then maybe the waiter spills someone's Diet Coke. First off, no matter how comfortable Perry St's chairs are (which they are), they are still white. Second, I am still neurotically afraid of stains because my mother made me that way (I still don't think my brother owns white shirts - he's in his twenties). But there thankfully seems to be minimal stainage, and because Perry St is a classy, apologetic, stand-up type of place, we are given two complimentary dishes of House Made Burrata (with grilled sourdough bread, wasabi, and sea salt), a delightful, artery-clogging combination of mozzarella and cream. Thus, begins our meal.The amuse-bouche is Sesame Shishito Peppers. Of all the crazy things out there in the culinary world, I actually love shishito peppers. And while this is still a most appreciated first bite, I've had better - mostly because I like mine with a bit more pep. And with Perry St's peppers, any added heat is non-existent, as is any outstanding flavor, truthfully. That's not to say they aren't good, it's just that, well, turns out I'm kind of a shishito snob. Who knew?Then comes my Taste of Summer Promotion at $28, a choice of two plates and a dessert - essentially an extension of the ever-popular, city-wide Restaurant Week fixed-price lunches. My first dish is the Crispy Calamari (with yuzu dipping sauce and sesame), which, while sounding slightly pedestrian compared to flashier offerings, is absolutely delicious and certainly deserving of its spot on the roster. These steroid squid are perfectly puffed, and the dipping sauce is less of a sauce and more of this heavenly, cloud-like lather, with sesame seeds half-submerged in this cup of froth as if they were '90s kids at some club's teen night foam party. Don't act like you've never partied in foam.My second plate is the Grilled Yellowfin Tuna Burger (with bonito mayonnaise, shiso, and yuzu* pickles), that one fancy Promotion menu item that gets the call-out for being an additional $5. Still, this thing is solid and juicy enough to please skeptical carnivores questioning why they just didn't go for red meat when they had the chance. It's a well-constructed faux-burger, for sure, cooked rare and to perfection, and devoid of that too fishy tuna taste. As for dessert, the Mixed Berries and Yogurt Sorbet is a light, soupy, summery, refreshing end to a luxurious meal disguised as comfort food.Perry St may reside along the noisy West Side Highway, but from inside, you'd never know it. Just as the kitchen deserves a round of applause for their fine cuisine, so does whomever did the sound-proofing on this place. Seriously. It's a detail most people just wouldn't notice (most likely because the restaurant paid a pretty penny for you not to notice), and yet speaks volumes of the quality of work surely put into all aspects of this establishment. It's the understated, it's the subtlety, it's the otherwise taken for granted. If you look close enough - through the elegant all-glass exterior, beyond the basic white-and-tan, two-toned color scheme, past the less-casual-than-it-sounds offerings - you'll see, at Perry St, it's all in the details.*Apparently, I'm a yuzu fan, the ingredient appearing in both of my dishes, despite not even knowing what the hell yuzu was prior to my meal. Well, it's an East Asian citrus fruit. You really do learn something new every day.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

For the entrees we got the salmon and the short ribs. The short ribs were the best I've eaten so far, you wont miss much if you skip the salmon.

I was a tad bummed as none of the items I saw on the menu were on the list but that is how things go. Considering we were such a large party I thought the staff was pretty on top of things. I had the winter vegetables to start and aside from being extremely hungry and thinking ""I am probably going to need a falafel later."" It was delicious. I had the ginger rice bowl and this was also quite good. Someone else in our party had an issue with a food allergy but the staff worked to resolve it quickly and took her meal off of our bill.

The location was also a bit out of the way. The service was good - no complaints - my boyfriend asked for drink suggestions and the waiter was helpful, although at one point I guess I was eating slowly and the waiter asked me if I didn't like what I ordered? I didn't mind, but it was kind of strange.As for the food, the chilled tomato soup at the beginning was AMAZING. I don't love tomato soup, but I could've eaten (drank?) about ten shot glasses of that stuff. The calamari was really good as well, but the yuzu dipping sauce it came with I didn't think had much flavor (my boyfriend disagreed so maybe it's just me).. I also feel like you can kind of get fried calamari anywhere. The main was fried chicken and it was really good! Good size too, we were stuffed afterwards. For dessert, I didn't like the peach thing (I forget exactly what it was), but the chocolate cake was really really good (and I'm not even a huge chocolate person).Overall, it was a good meal and I'm glad I finally got to eat at a Jean Georges restaurant, but I'm not dying to go back!",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

The Benedict came with a chili hollandaise which I didn't care for and too much ham for the one egg served with each tortilla. And though the crab dumplings were presented beautifully, I found them a little bland. Their Tuna Burger used to be something I really enjoyed but was just not as good as I remember it.

The maitake mushrooms was awesome, I think I enjoyed it more than the fish it self. * BUTTER POACHED LOBSTER...omgosh the lobster was so tender and sweet, regretted not ordering it for myself.

We were all a little underwhelmed by the Restaurant Week menu because the food was not as adventurous as the regular menu, but once it came it was delicious and we were really pleased with it. The sashimi for a starter cut like butter and was so smooth. There were these crunchy things on top that added a nice kick. The salmon filet was delicious with green chile sauce.

The restaurant is located a bit far out, but offers beautiful views of the Hudson River and of bordering New Jersey (yes, I did indeed say beautiful views of New Jersey!) Cocktails were great. I particularly enjoyed the London Punch, which was deliciously unique. We got the rice cracker crusted tuna, which was very nice. It came with a siracha-citrus emulsion, which I would say was mostly citrus, less on the siracha. Still good though! Also got the butternut squash soup, which may have been the best butternut squash soup I've ever had. It was hearty, flavorful, and with some crunchy goodness. Also got the entree size Provence black truffle dish. It was still a small size and pricey, but I think worth it. I love truffle! It was interesting too because it was paired with raviolinis in a non creamy sauce. Very interesting with a unique flavor profile. I enjoyed it. And the best for last, dessert!! The carrot cake soufflé was certainly interesting and unique. Though I didn't love the soufflé itself, I thought it was a great idea. What I did love was the cream cheese ice cream it was paired with, that was the bomb. Also tried the chocolate mousse dish. It was pretty incredible.

You would not be out of place in a suit and tie for a special occasion, but also would not feel under dressed in jeans and a collared shirt for a more casual dinner with friends.The wait staff is as well trained and knowledgeable as you would expect, and enhanced the experience every step of the way.The drink selection is vast and creative, with something for every taste. For a stronger choice, the Mackenzie Manhattan was simple and robust. For a sweeter palate, the cucumber mint Hendricks martini still packed a punch and was a crowd pleaser.The amuse-bouche was a good as any I can remember. It was a piping hot french onion soup shooter, set the tone for the richness and traditional french influence of the meal to follow.For dinner we opted away from the tasting menu, only to try more options. For appetizers the white truffle tagliatelle with organic egg was the highlight, perfect to split for the table. The house made burrata was also fantastic, not too creamy and full of flavor. The squash soup was also quite good, light and simple, while the calamari was just okay.For entrees, the fried chicken with three ways brussel sprouts was the highlight, I normally shy away from ordering chicken at a nice restaurant, but this will not disappoint. The butter poached lobster was a distant second, although the light, citrus flavor was refreshing. The caramelized beef was mildly disappointing, even ordering medium rare, it still felt a little dry. Certainly not a bad dish, just didn't quite hold up to the rest of the meal (although the mushrooms accompanying the steak were incredible).For desert, the chocolate pudding has enough consistency to not really feel like pudding, it was the table favorite. The cheesecake was also very good, if not as memorable.Overall, my only reason for not giving 5 stars, is the slight disappointment at the entrée selection/execution. On a return trip, I will most likely skip the entrees, and order mostly off the appetizer menu.

For dessert I got the molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. The burrata was legendary; it looks like a piece of mozzarella, but when you cut into it, you get this gorgeous reveal of cream oozing out. It had to be a bazillion calories, but it was so freaking good, especially when paired with the citrus. The tuna burger was lightly seared, well seasoned and delicious. The yuzu pickles were a nice touch. It was really picturesque too. You know how good burgers appear in fast food ads? It was that kind of look, something that could have been straight out of a food photo shoot. Finally, the dessert was the classic molten cake I've seen at nearly every Jean Georges place.

We waited, and we waited, and we waited...delay our gratification to the final moment, when out of the blue, some coffee arrived. Ah...The food...what can I say? Eh. Very mediocre. We all had various dishes with 8 people, so we were able to sample a fairly big variety of menu items. None of them had any ""wow"" factor, or pizazz. Not that it was bad, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't anything I'd write home about, or eat a second time.Oh, and fair warning - the chocolate molten cake is ONLY served for lunch! At least that's what our server told us. Other reviews on here mention the cake, but don't mention that it's lunch only.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

I had the chocolate molten cake which I know was discovered by the chef.  I am not frankly that impressed by these cakes as I learned to make them years ago.. it's not too hard.Lots of Asians when we went.. which was a little weird.  They were all taking photographs of the food.. which I guess is characteristic of us.  Liked the wine list as well.  Good service.,Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

369,rsh9pZ5jiuRipdUJMqnxBw,Shawna L.,3.0 star rating,"I can honestly say that plants have never been a large factor in my ratings system, but Perry St has gigantic flowering plants at all ends of the bar - festive and annoying. Early for our reservation, my companion and I were seated at the bar, and I turned my head AHH leaves - branches - flowers - blast! Eventually the gentleman next to us left so we scooted over a seat and I reclaimed ownership of my hair from the towering monstrosity. And then about 4 minutes later another gentleman approached us offering to buy us a drink to move down a spot at the bar because he said his date was sitting in the shadow of a towering plant - only to see we had the same predicament, at which he smiled sheepishly and walked back to the bar's other end. As an aside - the plants were quite beautiful from a distance. And the food was quite pleasant. We shared a tuna sashimi appetizer and I had the black bass for my entree. The tuna was fresh as one would expect at an establishment of this caliber, and my bass was well prepared with crispy skin as it should be. I had the spiced pumpkin tiramisu for dessert, and though I love all things pumpkin and ladyfinger and espresso-y, this was only mediocre.The drinks were lovely, and I had a few, but took inordinately long for the bartenders to prepare. I am a lover of mixology and fully expect to wait 15 minutes if need be for a proper cocktail, but none of what I ordered at Perry St could possibly have taken as long to prepare as I waited - and we were seated at the bar.Of course I wasn't expecting an experience here like I had at proper Jean Georges, but I doubt I'll be back to Perry St, even if they've removed those damn flower pots.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"
370,QZC_0LU9SHcry-Ys3IqM3A,Jay B.,4.0 star rating,"Very excellent meal.  HIghly recommended.Everything about the restaurant - from interior design to food presentation and staff attire - was carefully architectural.  Clean simplicity complemented by fabulous specifics rules the day - whether it's the white walls with dark wood trims complemented by a huge bouquet of cheery tree stems / blossoms, or the beautiful green of perfectly strained pea soup with a few floating dehydrated peas.The help was attentive - maybe a _smidgen_ too-much so; don't drink more than an inch of your water glass, or the help will be by to fill it.  Not really a big deal with water - but the same attentiveness drains your wine bottle quickly.  (Maybe this is by design, to increase the chance they'll sell you 2.  ;-)My wife and I are eating Gluten-free (by choice).  The menu had plenty of good choices, and the waiter was nicely attentive to the issue (due to his own Coeliac disorder).  Sadly, the dessert course was sadly lacking for this, though - limited to ice cream / sorbet. (One area that could be improved, for sure, given the trend towards gluten-free across the population.)The only reason I'm not giving the restaurant 5 stars is that I need to reserve it for truly-amazing meals.  I've _had_ 5-star (or 1-2 Michelin star) experiences that have been mind-blowing.  The food at Perry St. was fantastic; the price was up there, but not rapacious by any means; and the experience was good.  But I've got to reserve 5-stars for the truly mind-blowing restaurants.That said, Perry St. was very, very good.  Just go.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

Both came in great presentation and more importantly, tasted awesome. The portion was just right; it was not so much that it overstuffed you.

We get there at 820PM and hostess greets us with a smile and shows us to our seats. The over-all ambiance of the restaurant is very elegant but simple. The staff was very friendly and observant, coming over to refill water/ask for refills on drinks and clearing away plates to make room for the next part of the meal in a timely fashion. Complimentary bread/butter was served and they gave us 2 fried risotto balls as well which were very good.We had the Argentinian Crios 2012 Malbec, to start, which was delicious We had the grilled octopus for appetizers, which was interesting and pretty good; one large tentacled arm is grilled and served with potatoes and various garnishes.She had the Chilean Sea Bass, which she enjoyed a lot.. I thought it was pretty good too. The grilled mushrooms were a nice touch.I had the Carmelized Beef Tenderloin medium rare, which I didn't enjoy so much.  The meat was cooked perfectly but the texture of the beef tasted old, like meat that's been sitting in the freezer for weeks.  I don't know, maybe it's just me, my girlfriend thought it tasted fine.The staff gave us 2 little cold, chocolatey, dessert things when dropping off the check; that was delicious as well.All in all, I had a very positive experience here.The service and ambiance were great, the wine was very good, and most of the food was tasty and just the right portion size.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

They have a great summer/fall/winter/spring 3 course menu for 28$ which is great, esp given that this is one of Jean-Georges's restaurants. Decor: Love it! Clean, refreshing, minimal.. It's simple and nice with lots of sunlight. Food: consistently great! The rice cracker crusted tuna is one of my favorites, but noticed that they removed this from the 3 course menu option (sad face)... They have a butternut squash soup in the fall and it is absolutely to die for. If you ever see it on the menu, it is a must try!  The one other item that stood out was the calamari. It's perfectly cooked and i LOVED the fluffiness from the batter. The only issue I had was that it was too salty. I would recommend telling them to skip the extra sea salt they sprinkle on top. Over the years this place has attracted more asian people (koreans specifically). It may be after the kimchi chronicles came out or because jean Georges wife is 1/2 korean and did a korea tour a few years ago.

I made our initial reservation for Tuesday at 8 on Monday evening. On Tuesday morning, I changed it to 7:30 and there were still plenty of times available.Perry Street is a bit out of the way and a pain to reach - there are no subways around the corner - but the food and location are worth it. The restaurant is across the street from the river and features a typical minimalist, but still nice Jean-Georges interior.On to the food. For those who didn't know, Jean-Georges' son is the executive chef here at Perry Street. They started off with a complimentary amuse bouche of fava beans and a pea soup of sorts, drizzled on crostini. It was slightly spicy and very yummy. For appetizers, we had the Rice Cracker Crusted Tuna and the Chilled Peekytoe Crab Salad. The tuna was delicious. Due to the rice cracker crust, I couldn't tell if the outside was seared, but the inside was definitely sashimi style. The crab salad, on the other hand, was not good. It wasn't rancid crab meat, but there were certain flavors mixed together in there that just didn't work.For entrees, I had the lamb chops and she had the butter poached lobster. The lamb chops, which currently aren't on the online menu, cost $38 and the lobster, which doesn't have a price on the online menu, is $35. Both were quite delicious, juicy and succulent. I had my lamb medium rare with no complaints. The lobster comes with a lemongrass and kaffir lime broth, served on the side and I'd suggest keeping it on the side. The lobster definitely tastes better without any sauce.For dessert, we split the trio of sorbets, choosing mandarin, ginger pear and green apple. All tasted like we were eating real fruit, tho the mandarin could've been a bit more flavorful.For beverages, we mainly stuck with water, tho I did have the Vodka Thyme Lemonade, which I'd recommend.No complaints about the staff. Everyone was super friendly and accommodating, answering any questions and making sure that all was well.Besides the complaint about the crab salad, the only other complaint is the dimly lit interior of the restaurant, which borders on being poorly lit so that it's difficult to see what you're eating. While there is still daylight outside, this isn't a problem, but once the sun goes down, it gets pretty dark inside as well.As for peoples' attire, it was all over the place. The guy sitting next to me had a v-neck undershirt and jeans, while other people had suits.All in all, a very good restaurant. The crab salad and poorly lit interior are the only things preventing me from awarding a 5 star rating.

There was at most one bite of overcooked cod, no purée at all in the dish and the garlic/chili seasoning was so strong and unbalanced it ruined the entire dish.The yuzu pavlova dessert was refreshing and not too sugary, and saved a little the menu.All in all, given the price for restaurant week, we cannot really complain about the ""assembly-line"" feeling but I was expecting more refined and balanced dishes.(and bigger portions)",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

388,HoPHPEe2oZOrrZx_4vWJzw,Jocy C.,4.0 star rating,"My 200th review!I decided to write it on Jean Georges' Perry Street.  I've been a big fan of Nougatine and The Mark Restaurant, so why not take try out Perry Street?  I've been wanting to try it out since New Years but haven't had a chance to go.Location:Perry Street by the West Side HighwayBe prepared to take a long walk from the train station... or just drive!  I was pretty lucky to find a parking spot in 2 minutes on a Saturday around 11:30am... but then again, I usually have good luck finding a parking spot.  I have a parking angel watching out for me.Food:Overall, food was great but not outstanding for a chef of Jean Georges reputation.  With that noted, it's still a GREAT DEAL for brunch!  Worth a trip for brunch and then take a nice walk along the West Side Highway to watch the view & water on a beautiful sunny day.The brunch deal includes 2 entrees and 1 dessert for $26.  I came here with 3 other friends... so what do we do?  We order 8 different dishes and shared.Highlights of the meal included the Amuse Bouche (Broccoli & Cheese), Artic Char Salmon and Sweet Chili Crab Dumplings (with Cilantro and Celeriac).  I personally liked the Cod with Miso-Yuzu Glaze (with Baby Bok Choy & Sriracha), but one of the girls at the table mentioned that she didn't think it was buttery enough.  For those of you that know me, I don't do butter.  I also liked their Spinach & Goat Cheese Omelette.  The goat cheese flavor was muted, so it doesn't slap you across the face when you eat it... although I do crave the strong flavor of goat cheese from time to time.Dessert:With the $26 deal, there are 2 choices of dessert, so our group got both to try.  1) Warm Valhora Chocolate Cake & Vanilla Ice Cream2) Cheesecake, Strawberry and Rhubarb Compote, Candied Almonds, Rhubarb SorbetI personally prefer the chocolate cake.  You can't go wrong with chocolate.  The strawberry dessert was good, but I didn't think the cheesecake was cheesecakey enough.  Is that even a word?  If I didn't know any better, I would have thought it was a cake instead of a cheesecake.Pictures:1) Amuse Bouche - Broccoli & Cheese - yelp.com/biz_photos/2Vpu…2) Drinks - Ginger Margarita & Bloody Mary - yelp.com/biz_photos/2Vpu…3) Spinach & Goat Cheese Omelette (with Shoestring Potatoes) - yelp.com/biz_photos/2Vpu…4) Artic Char Salmon (Lemon, Olive Oil, & Crispy Skin) - yelp.com/biz_photos/2Vpu…5) Rice Cracker Crusted Tuna (with Sriracha-Citrus Emulsion) - yelp.com/biz_photos/2Vpu…6) Sweet Chili Crab Dumplings (with Cilantro and Celeriac) - yelp.com/biz_photos/2Vpu…7) Grilled Yellowfin Tuna Burger (Bonito Mayonnaise, Shiso, and Yuzu Pickles) - yelp.com/biz_photos/2Vpu…8) Bouchot Mussels (Coconut Curry Sauce and Thai Basil) - yelp.com/biz_photos/2Vpu…9) Cod with Miso-Yuzu Glaze (with Baby Bok Choy & Sriracha) - yelp.com/biz_photos/2Vpu…10) Slowly Cooked Salmon (with Basil Vinaigrette and White Asparagus) - yelp.com/biz_photos/2Vpu…11) Warm Valhora Chocolate Cake & Vanilla Ice Cream - yelp.com/biz_photos/2Vpu…12) Cheesecake, Strawberry and Rhubarb Compote, Candied Almonds, Rhubarb Sorbet - yelp.com/biz_photos/2Vpu…",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

I nick a star off since dessert wasn't impressive given the standards of this place.  I had the strawberry tiramisu.  I thought the dessert cup was pretty since it was swirled with strawberries. I just thought the strawberry topping was too sweet.  It would have been better off topped with fresh sliced strawberries and whipped cream.  Also, I would have like the marsala wine or some kind of liquor infused into the saviordi fingers (the cookie portion) and into the zabligone.  Maybe there's better performing desserts but I guess I would have to come back to find out which isn't a bad thing since this place overall delivers beautiful and delicious cuisine.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

I'm happy to say the food was on point as it is in all the JG restaurants I've had the pleasure to try. And kudos to the staff for not giving us a hard time when my parents arrived nearly half an hour past the reservation time. And though we nearly got kicked out after we were done paying for the bill, they did that fairly graciously as well ^^. In their defense, it was very busy that night and I'm pretty sure the group of four having a drink at the bar were waiting for us to get up. Onto the dining.Sis and I ordered a round of cocktails as we waited. I had the Passionfruit - light and refreshing though a tad too sweet for my taste. My sister had the Pear; it was our favorite of the night. Light and frothy (love egg whites in cocktails [when made right, of course]!) Once my parents arrived, my dad got the Hot Hot Toddy... Hot cocktails are not my thing but it was fragrant and slightly spicy (had chili peppers in it) and he enjoyed it. I believe my mom had the tangerine... it was good but looking back, not memorable enough to recall. We decided to get the $78 tasting menu. (Damn inflation. The last time I went, it was $68.) I was happy to see that the rice cracker crusted tuna was still on it; I remember it being one of my favorite dishes the first time and it did not disappoint this time. LOVE the sriracha-citrus; I'd lick it off the plate if I weren't such a lady ;).  Second course was the roasted vegetables and fruits. So simple but so delicious; the pecorino and walnut vinaigrette... yum. Next was the pan seared black sea bass with maitake mushrooms in basil broth (I just realized it's really his sauces I'm in love with...) I wasn't crazy about the mushrooms, but you can't go wrong with sea bass, so light and flaky - it's definitely one of my favorite fish. The grilled lamb chops was the final entrée, served with crispy artichokes and black olive oil.  I remember enjoying the dish but nothing specific comes to mind.As I'm not a dessert person, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the dessert especially because I wasn't expecting much from the rather simple description, ""chocolate pudding with candied violets."" In reality, it's so much more. I can't even describe it... but there was pudding and cake and whipped cream and those violets...

The food is very well-made, somewhat creative, and high quality, but nothing is mind-blowing. I think my biggest problem was that literally everything we ordered ended up being breaded and fried: the egg/caviar and tuna appetizers, the rabbit, and the fried chicken (obviously). While that might be a good strategy for Chili's, I am not sure I really appreciate it at a fine-ish dining restaurant such as this. The fried chicken was out of this world, but the other items I mentioned really had their flavors muffled by all the breading. Otherwise, they were seasoned really well, cooked well, presented well, and I enjoyed it. Service was great.

The day has finally come when I ordered fried chicken in a snow white colored walls and very minimal decor, fancy smanchy restaurant. My date who is preggers suggested this restaurant and I was pretty excited when she mentioned Jean Georges. However, I was not excited when I saw on a map where this place is. What a SCHLEP to get here. Yes, adhere to the transportation advice given in other reviews and take a cab here. Beg the cabbie to use the GPS if he has no idea where to go.  We arrived at 6pm sharp on a Wednesday night and there was one other table seated already. My friend and I got a corner seats for 2. I admit I like the quietness in the air and the space of privacy.  We wanted to try the homemade sodas. I told the waiter and we would like to try the sodas. Thyme and lemon for me and a raspberry flavor for my friend. The waiter returned with mine having with hard liquor and salt brimmed at the top and thank goodness, my preggers friend got a virgin soda. I was disappointed that I got an alcoholic one and the waiter did say he would get me another one. But I opted to keep it because let's face it, he is gonna spit in the new one that he would have made for me. I asked my friend if I had ordered correctly, and she clearly remembered that I said ""SODAS"". This is what happens, when the wait staff do not write your order down.  We start with the crab dumplings, taking the advice of the previous yelpers. Delish! Crab meat comes in a huge clump presented inside a ravoli like pasta. I even found crab bones in my crab meat and it came with this delicious sauce on the bottom. There are great entrees on the menu, such as different types of fish. I love fish but I was not in a fish mood. We choose entrees raved by yelpers. The fried chicken entree came with two thick cuts of chicken breasts. The fried breading was the right amount of crispiness and crunch. I could not get enough of that deep fried breading. I took a big bite out of my friend's burger. The burger is Mmmm good and grade A chunk of meat. We ended the night with two unique desserts. I got the white chocolate and meregue. She got chocolate pudding with chocolate coated crushed sugar crystals. Both dessert were little works of art and sweet as can be.Overall, I was impressed with the food. Jean Georges put his spin on two American classics. When we were leaving, the atmosphere of quietness dimished as it got louder. The crowd here tends to be an older generation. I contemplated if I will come back. My peeve is really the location of this place. If I lived in the West Village, I would come here again. My friend said, this is a great place too come after work. I agree as well, but if someone wanted to come here for dinner over the weekend, I would say no.

A group of friends and me tried everything on the menu, which was not much, just 2 options for the appetizer, entree and dessert. There was no vegetarian option for the entree, but I am  not complaining. We started with the fried calamari and Burrata cheese. Fried calamari for me was the standout dish. The Yuzu dipping sauce was exceptional, I wanted to drink it. But my friends favored the cheese, they serve it with strawberries and some kind of crackers, micro greens, the works, it looked beautiful, I guess my palate is not that complex. For entrees it was Salmon and Fried chicken. I never thought I would say this but I actually liked the salmon much better, it was slow cooked to perfection. The fried chicken was definitely a step up from KFC, but I wouldn't rave about it. You cannot go wrong with the molten chocolate cake at any Jean-Georges place, there was also a really good blueberry cake with cream cheese and blueberry sorbet, the sorbet was truly exceptional. Special mention to all the cocktails we had, they were outstanding. I especially liked my Passion Chili Sour. Overall I would say its minimalist ambience and good food will make me go again.

One of them is that he always does restaurant week right.  I go to his restaurants plenty for regular meals, and it is really nice to see that even the restaurant week experience there is never a compromise on the quality of the food or the service.  (It's a huge pet peeve of mine when a decent restaurant offers an awful rest. week menu.  If you don't want to participate in this project, fine with me.  Won't hold it against you for a second.  But don't make me suffer through a horrible meal.  I've actually stopped patronizing restaurants over this... Blue Water Grill.)In any event...  This was my first time at Perry St.  The space is lovely.  Admittedly it's on the west side highway, pretty out of the way, but the ambiance is warm and welcoming, with clean modern decor.  I came in very early for my reservation and hung out for half an hour at the bar/lounge area with the amazingly delicious Pomegranate Cocktail made with fresh-squeezed pomegranate juice.  Highly recommend, but ask for it without salt on the rim of the glass, if you are not into that.  I am not and hated the salt thing.Once my husband got to the restaurant, we got seated right away at a very nice table.  The restaurant week menu was fantastic.  2 choices for each of the courses, which is limited but kind of perfect because makes it less difficult to make your food decisions.  Between the two of us, we tried everything on the menu.Before the meal we were served an amouse bouche of potato and black truffle soup - excellent!.Appetizers were burrata cheese and sashimi.  Both were good.  Burrata was filled with ricotta and presented beautifully with a delicious toasted piece of dark bread.  Sashimi was ok, but I am not that into sashimi, so....  My husband loved it.Main courses were cod with broccoli rabe and lemon sauce and beef  with spinach and Gruyere sauce.  Cod was wonderful, but the beef filet was simply above and beyond.  Perfectly prepared, completely out of this world.Desserts were warm chocolate cake and almond crusted ice cream bar, I believe.  I've never seen Jean-George make a less than fabulous warm choc cake, so no surprises there.  The vanilla ice cream that came with it was great, too.  The ice cream bar is a little hard to describe, but was also fantastic.  Order without hesitation if you are not in a mood for chocolate.Service was wonderful, competent and warm from the hostess, to the bar staff, to the waiter and food servers.  It is a little bit of a conveyor belt, considering that, like, 80% of the people seemed to be there for rest week.  And they do try to turn the tables around quickly - we were in and out in an hour.  But again, I do understand, this being rest week and all.   And on a Wednesday night, we weren't exactly looking to linger for there for hours.  So, it all worked out.All in all, a 5-star restaurant week experience.  Will definitely go back for their regular menu once the rest week is over.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

I'd specifically reserved this place for Restaurant Week. The waitress gave us the normal menus and came back with the RW inserts (which was in effect after 930pm on Fridays) upon request.Our amuse bouche was a soup. We were starving at this point. The bread was a saving grace. We candidly asked the waiter if the food was enough to fill us and he said yes. He was right.Between the two of us, we tried:- House Made Burrata, with cranberry compote, olive oil, and grilled sourdough.- Sauteed shrimp with fennel, tarrgon, and chorizo sauce. The appetizers were good, but not amazing.We both got the fried chicken and it was as perfect as we expected it to be. The mushroom spatzle that accompanied it set it over the top. Dessert was pretty standard. We tried the warm valrhona chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and the banana and chocolate torte with chocolate gelato. The gelatos were presented at a very high temperature. Too liquidy. They say it enhances the flavor this way, but it was hard to eat. Also, our table was extremely close to the adjacent table.

The food here was really great - just not in the blew-me-away-will-never-forget way that JG was for me. Thus the 4 stars.. what can I say, I have really high standards for 5 stars.Love that this is right on the west side highway - you see the parks/trees on the river, & it feels a little removed from the hustle & bustle of Manhattan.A note on the service. We were reserved for a table of 3. About an hour before our reservation a friend decided she could join. I called to could change it & they said it was impossible; they were completely booked & we'd have to push our reservation back another 2 hours, & that we were on a table that seated exactly 3. Oh well, too bad. But the restaurant was half empty throughout our lunch!! What BS. They could've taken 4.My girlfriends & I came for restaurant week - lunch is an incredible deal. Heres what we got:Cocktails:- Passion chili soda - delicious! The spice compliments the subtle sweetness really well. Very refreshing drink.- Lime Daiquiri  - really great summer drink! Very light yet sweet & so refreshing.- forgot the name but a bubbly made from cava - pretty good, a little strong on the cava & not much flavor beyond that.Amuse-bouche:- Gazpacho - really really interesting. The flavor like changes as you sip it. First slightly salty, then sweet/refreshing, then slightly spicy. Main plates:- Cod w/ ratatouille - well made dish, but nothing too unique or memorable. If you're a big fan of cod or ratatouille, get this. I was iffy on the ratatouille (too much of the harvest vegetables, not a big fan of the slight sour taste) but I think it was more a general iffy about this dish, not the way Perry St made it. The cod was pretty much perfect.- Calamari w/ yuzu sauce - woww what a perfect crunch to the calamari! We all loved the yuzu sauce too - a slight hint of sourness, who wouldve thought that would go so well with calamari??- Crab dumplings - wow, VERY very good. Sugar snap peas added that perfect refreshing crunch & slight natural sweetness, while the sauce was slightly tangy/ spicy/ sweet. Delicious.- Hanger steak - I always feel like you need to get some sort of steak at a nice restaurant, since it's so hard to get steak just right. There was an interesting interplay of flavors between the plum mustard (sweet), the veggie (forgot what it was called but it was bitter), & the steak. It tasted good all together. But I thought there should've been more flavor on the steak itself (it was rather plain). & it was cooked very well, was tender, medium-rare like I asked. But idunno.. I feel like I've just had better steak. Normally it slices right through under your knife, this one took a little work. I feel bad because it was a good dish and I am just being a little bit of a snob about my steak.. Oh and the blue chips were good. - Ginger rice - this wasnt bad... but in retrospect was a very plain & probably easy dish to make, & we should've gotten something else. The breaded poached egg was really good.. loved eating the rice that was soaked in the yolk. Came with avocado & scallions which added a nice crunch. We couldn't really taste the ginger though..- Fried chicken - I felt like the chicken was a little dry/ overdone. Loved the crispy skin, that was done really well. & the pea puree (was it pea? It was green) - so good!! The spinach went really well with all these too.Dessert:- warm chocolate cake - Always a great dessert. Can't really go wrong. Something Perry St did different was have this thin glazed cracker on top of the ice cream & some crumbles underneath it - added some great texture, & a bite with the warm cake, cold vanilla ice cream, & the cracker & crumbles was pure heaven.- Berry soup - good blend of summer fruits in a cold soup with (vanilla?) ice cream, & some sweet bread sticks. The bread sticks were really good, had a decent crunch yet were soft, & when it soaked in the soup a little was delicious. A nice counter balance with the chocolate cake - but if I had to choose between the two of course I'll always go for chocolate =).Overall pros:- Great location! Love that it's on the W side hwy, quieter, you get a view of the parks/ river. Nice simple decor, mostly white & classy, lots of natural light during the day. You get the feel of almost being outside without the crappy weather.- Good service of course.. as expect of a restaurant of this caliber.- Must haves: Crab dumplings, fried chicken (I say this with a little hesitation as the flavors were great but the meat was a little dry, not as tender as I would'v preferred). Overall cons:- Not the top JG restaurant. Like some of the unique flavor combinations, the Asian twist to some of the dishes, but overall this place didnt WOW me. I'm very glad I came, but probably won't be a repeat customer. I have only so many meals to eat out each week & I'll need to keep trying new",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

However, my experience over the 48 hours that followed was not pleasant and although this was in early December, I have not been able to eat calamari since and it has always been one of my favorites.

This restaurant, more than any of Jean-Georges' other restaurants that I've been to, is a perfectly balanced fusion of French and Asian cuisines. For example, one of my favorite dishes, the fried calamari, while decidedly a Western dish (or bar food) in my mind, is battered in light, crispy tempura batter and served with a yuzu foam dipping sauce that is just amazing. The combination turns something that is normally oily and heavy into a crisp, refreshing appetizer. Another of my favorites is the tuna burger, which unlike most tuna burgers, is moist and flavorful. Instead of grilled tuna, the patty is almost like a tuna carpaccio that is then lightly seared on both sides. The mussels are tender and delicious as well, served in a delicious green curry sauce rather than a  traditional wine sauce. I could go on and on about most items in the menu because they are all fantastic, meticulously created and very well-balanced. Perhaps best of all though, you can get an appetizer, entree, and dessert for just $28 during lunch, an absolute steal for the quality of food you're getting!Service at Perry St is also great. While you won't get the super attentive wait team that watches your every move like at one of the more expensive restaurants, the serving team is extremely professional and very helpful.

Quick access to tasty cocktails while I wait for a table are always a plus in my book. I love any place that exudes trendiness and swank, and paired with an attractive crowd (well...attractive and rich) is hitting the bulls eye. We were seating on time by a more than chipper hostess, and quickly greeted by a kind waiter who seemed to be poorly attempting to withhold his frustrations with the restaurant week crowd. Feeling the pressure, we decided to order an extra appetizer, one of the more expensive ones, but I'm glad we did. The crispy sliced ahi was delish, and I could have easily devoured an entire plate of the unique and fresh concoction. Is this rice crispy cereal on this fish? I had no clue, but it was excellent and that's all I cared about at this point. After just 2 cocktails I already had a buzz. Bravo Perry St.Dinner (Cod) was perfectly cooked and well accompanied with some brocollirab and sauce.

Then came the main courses: My mother and I both had the crispy bass which was just insanely good- the outside was crispy, and the inside was moist.  The portobello fries added the perfect saltiness and texture to the dish (the couscous, however, was dry and flavorless).  My father had the much-talked about fried chicken, and while we were both skeptical of anything hyped, the chicken lived up to the billing.  Best not to think of it as fried chicken (which, let's face it, makes you think of KFC).  This is light and juicy, and the mushroom spaetzle is the perfect complement.  My husband had the cod with miso glaze and bok choy- loved this too.  The dish had a clean, simple taste (something I usually associate with Vietnamese food).  Dessert: the kiwi tart was a hit - it was on a delicious flaky crust and the kiwi was both tart and sweet.  Less interesting was the white chocolate meringue (I loved the way it looked structurally but didn't love the texture of the white chocolate).   The sorbet trio was a nicer healthier option (my husband is dairy free so he appreciated an option that he could eat)-  the chocolate and the raspberry were delicious, the lemon was a bit tarter than we would have liked.All of this to say, Perry Street was just so, so refined and elegant and wonderful - and I'm sort of amazed that they can maintain this level of refinement and elegance at fairly reasonable prices.  What small misses there were were so tiny as to be almost unnoticeable.   Jean Georges,  I think I love you.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"
445,nhJc3hqllASqxwoVY6Ar1A,Serena T.,3.0 star rating,"As one of many Jean-Georges V. restaurants in NYC, Perry St faces the reputation dilemma - if it's good, that is expected.  If it's bad, you are doubly disappointed.  Lucky for me, Perry St fell into the former category.  I recently went for its prix fixe menu - at $26 for two courses and dessert, it is a reasonable brunch option.I started with the house mozzarella with with citrus and Thai basil. I've had good mozzarella, and I've had bad mozzarella.  At it's worst, it's gummy, squeaky, crunchy or even worse.  Luckily, this mozzarella was none of the above - it was soft but elastic, only lightly salted, and it absorbed the flavors of the Thai basil and olive oil.  The orange and grapefruit salad provided a pleasant, slightly sour counterpoint to the creamy cheese.My eating buddy had the peekytoe crab salad hot mustard and granny smith apples.   I love tart flavors paired with seafood, and this dish was a perfect example.  Without relying too heavily on mayonnaise for the crab salad, the freshness of the crab and ripe apples shined.For my second course, I ordered the slowly cooked salmon with truffle vinaigrette and steamed maitake mushroom.   I loved this dish.  I'm a fan of gravlax/lox/smoked salmon and its permutations, and this one didn't disappoint.  It was aromatic without being overly fishy, and the mushrooms and truffle vinaigrette provided a well-rounded flavor.  The bread was toasted and buttered - mmmm.My eating buddy had the roasted chicken sandwich with chipotle-lime mayo and avocado.  I'm always a little hesitant to order chicken - I'm a dark-meat gal, and most white meat served in restaurants is a little dry for my taste.  However, this chicken was juicy and tender, and the mayo and avocado also added a level of moisture.  The chips were quite typical, in my opinion.We finished with the warm chocolate cake with vanilla bean gelato, and the citrus custard cake. The cake had a rich and flavorful center - few things annoy me more than chocolatey-looking things that are actually quite flavorless. This was not the case here.  The vanilla bean ice cream was also delicious - you can see the real bean pieces, so you know they're not faking!The citrus cake was light and refreshing - I would have liked a little more tart-ness, but it wasn't sickly sweet, so I still gobbled it up.Perry St's portions are ample but not overwhelming, and the decor is clean and minimalist.  Being right off the West Side Highway, it's a bit of a walk from the subway, but I'd recommend trying it at least once!  Reservations recommended.A bit of a walk, but worth it for the Prix Fixe brunch.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

The food is nothing exceptional - the bread was cold and stale, the menu-specialty fried chicken was overly salted, but the short ribs were delicious.

I love the understated elegance of the decor or here and super attentive service. For my starter I had  the salmon carpaccio and shared some of my friends' steak tartare. Both were excellent and very well seasoned. If you are squeamish about steak tartare I highly recommend chef Cedric Vongerichten's version. It's just the right combination of salty, spicy and meaty. The salmon carpaccio was also nicely seasoned with garlic and vinegar and is presented beautifully.  For my main I had the fried chicken which is very tender and delicious. I love that they come by table-side to pour the jus  over it. The honey is nice and not overwhelmingly sweet. Also the brussels sprouts were perfectly cooked and reminiscent of Jean Georges' other spot, Spice Market. I'm not really a fan of brussels sprouts but these really changed my mind that with the right preparation and seasoning they can be very delicious.  For dessert we all shared desserts.  My favorites were the molten chocolate cake and the deconstructed pecan pie. The pie was nice and boozy, which I really love and the warm chocolate cake warmed my insides on the chilly December day.  The pear hazelnut tart was good, but the pear was not very ripe.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"
450,Q9UxDPklf9-N_URgpZoC5w,Erin M.,3.0 star rating,"In choosing a location for Sunday dinner, Perry St was especially attractive due to its intimate setting and Hudson River location.  The interior, furnished with clean modern lines, crisp whites and soft lighting, holds about 20 tables in all.  The small size juxtaposed with its breathtaking view was more reminiscent of Boston dinning, than New York City. We started the meal with two Hendricks cocktails: one a martini with cucumber and mint, served with a cucumber spear and the second with fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice.  Although both drinks were tasty, the cucumber mint martini played classically off the juniper-distilled gin. The appetizers ordered were sweet chili crab dumplings and the house made burrata with Meyer lemon. The stand out was the cheese, which we could have ordered for dessert. The lemon, served in a jam style, balanced the burrata for a slightly sweet, sour and smooth combination. Dinner consisted of butter-poached lobster and grilled strip loin. The lobster was surprisingly sweet featuring lemongrass and kaffir broth.  Having enjoyed kaffir and lemongrass pancakes at Kittichai, I enjoyed this flavor much more with a sweet over this savory style.  Bred in New England, perhaps I just enjoy my lobster in plain ol' butter (some garlic can be thrown in there for good measure). The highlight of the strip was the jalapeno cheddar fritters, better known as dressed up jalapeno poppers.  I am a sucker for bar food in a tux. The steak would have been mouth watering had it not been over-cooked. We ordered medium rare and it was served medium.  Luckily, a perfectly balanced glass of Pinto smoothed out our light disappointment. We ended the meal with the restaurant week special of molten chocolate cake. Since the dessert's explosion in the early 2000s, I haven't seen this delicacy on NYC menus recently. I was happy to learn that Perry St owner, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, claims invention of this lava delight and therefore it's not surprising that this was the dish of the night. Served with vanilla gelato, the slightly crisped outside crumbled into a gooey chocolate eruption. We practically licked the plate afterwards. All in all, we enjoyed our experience at Perry St. I don't except to have dinner there again, but I will certainly be back for cocktails, dessert and the view!",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

Perhaps it's the proximity to the river or the light colored decor, either way I immediately felt removed from the chaotic city.We were immediately greeted by a Myriad of friendly staff. After coats were checked we sat in the lounge area while our table was prepared.I was immediately impressed by the bar menu, as they offer half glasses of wine and champagne. I have never seen this before, and being a light drinker I was instantly attracted to the idea, the half glass of cava it was.Once we sat we were greeted promptly and from start to finish the service was impeccable and quite smooth. We ordered from the resturaunt week prixfixe menu. The one downside was the very limited menu, understandably so, given the circumstances. We were offered two choices for appetizer and entree. I selected the Meyer lemon burutta and beef tenderloins. Both were prepared to perfection, and as I finished one the other arrived right in time. The Amuse-bouche was one of my favorite parts of the dining experience. It was potatoe and truffle oil soup! Absolutely delicious, warm, savory soup with a slight kick to it. After enjoying it so much I asked if they served a bowl of it and unfortunately they dont. I suppose I'll just have to go back for more.The Meyer lemon burratta, a cheese made in house, was lightly topped with olive oil and Meyer lemon purée. The cheese consisted of an outside layer of mozzarella, then filled with ricotta and creme fresh. The lightly paired flavors and mixture of textures seemed to disappear from my plate before I knew it.The tenderloin arrived and with it came a lovely presentation as they poured the sauce in the intentionally empty place on the plate. The perfectly cooked beef tenderloin was placed on top of sautéed spinache and the warm greyeur sauce tied it all together nicely.The meat was so tender that no steak knife was needed. The dinner knife easily made its way through the entree, and just like the appetizer, my dinner disappeared before my eyes.Dessert was a warm chocolate lava cake lightly sprinkled with powdered sugar and a wonderful scoop of vanilla ice cream. The center of the cake was perfectly warm and melted as my fork made its way Into it. I ended the meal with a cup of coffee. Often this part of the dining experience is overlooked. I tend to judge a resturaunts quality, and my overall experience, based on the small details. The coffee came out promptly with milk and an assortment of sweetners. It was a fantastic cup of coffee and really was a nice way to end the meal. With the check came petite dusted fudge with walnut squares. They were a lovely way to end the evening.

I like places that are a hole-in-the-wall, dingey dives with questionable Dept of Health gradings. But Perry Street really showed me a gastronomic good time. Date night was successful once again. But honestly, when your companion rocks, there is not much that can ruin the evening. This place just heightened everything else that was already awesome. Although a bit hard to get to (especially if you trek from King's County), it is well worth the trip. My date was waiting for me, seated on a plush couch near the hostess station. I like that they have a nice waiting area, so people aren't loitering aroung the hostess station. The space is chic, sleek and modern. Check out the beautiful large light fixtures they have hovering over the tables. The restaurant was dimly lit and set the tone for the night. Romantic, but extremely elegant, and high-class. It is spacious and there is a lot of wiggle room. I like classy and this place embodied classy like no other. They have one of the best chili cocktails I have had in Manhattan.  It is Maker's Mark bourbon, chilies, and a splash of soda. If you like a spicy cocktail, start off with the Passion Chili cocktail. It will have you in flames!I decided to try the spring tasting menu ($68).  I am not a splurger, but the tasting menu was just too enticing to pass up. The rice cracker crusted tuna with sriracha-citrus emulsion was an excellent starter. The tuna was raw and extremely flavorful and fresh. I don't think I have had a piece of tuna like this in a long while.  Next up was the beet salad with farm goat cheese and mango vinaigrette and passionfruit pulp. The beets were extremely fresh and the passionfruit pulp added a unique kick. The main course consisted of the slowly cooked Scottish salmon, white asparagus and bok choy, and herbal chili sauce. The salmon was a small piece but just the right size. How ever did they find such a succulent piece of salmon bursting with flavor? I love fish. And thus far, this place was making me very weak in knees with superb culinary skills in preparing two of my favorite fishes.  The last dish I had was the icing on the cake. Crunchy rabbit with green chilies millet, fava beans and oven dried black olives.  If you can only try one dish, this is the dish to get. The rabbit was moist and the crust gave it a perfect ""crunchy"" texture. I especially loved the millet and fava beans. Fava beans are one of my favorite legumes and with the millet created a texture adventure for my mouth. The only disappointment in this whole meal was the dessert. The chocolate pudding was not as decadent and rich as I had conjured up in my head. It was mild sweet and a bit foamy. Not my kind of pudding, if you ask me. Overall, this place was impressive. Probably not a place I would go to regularly, but it is a great spot for a special occasion or if you want to impress that special someone.

That dinner has always remained, in my mind, as THE dinner. (Thank you, Adam Grealish.) So, my expectations for Perry St. were perhaps a bit high. I wasn't expecting a repeat of the white linen, 6-course tasting, but I did still hope for something magical to happen, as it had in the past. A different kind of magic. Alas, magic eluded me that night, but can I really complain about a very GOOD meal with fine company?The short:Perry St. is a stylish, intimate, romantic spot for simple, well-executed, new American dishes. You're not going to be sorry you came here, but you're also not going to be blown away. Simple dishes often have the most to lose--there are no wild cards and smoke-and-mirrors to hide behind. It simply boils down to careful selection of a few essential flavor components and execution. Perry St.'s execution is impeccable, but I found myself searching for a missing flavor in most of the dishes. Perhaps I came with too intellectual of a palate, but I can get well-executed new American fare closer to home.(Note: Service was a bit pushy; we were asked 4 times in 10 minutes whether we were ""done with our entrees."" Do I blame the daft server or Restaurant Week?)The rundown:Amuse-bouche:*Roasted Potato Soup with truffle emulsion and potato chips. I wish they had served a whole bowl of this. It was simply delicious and peppery and liquid velvet. The potato chips could have used some seasoning, though, perhaps a paprika cayenne smoked salt.Appetizers:* Tasmanian Trout Sashimi was pleasantly toothsome, and I liked the heat of the chilis, but it lacked acid. In general, I find sashimi ""good"" but not overwhelming--a chef doesn't get to collect the credit for a good piece of raw fish. I wish the dish had been ""good"" sashimi + interesting twists = ""great"" dish.*House-made Burrata was a failed play on a bread and cheese dessert plate with toasted bread and a meyer lemon compote, which was too sweet. There was no flavor to bridge it with the subtle, cheesy blandness of the burrata, stuffed with ricotta: 1 bland cheese + 1 bland cheese = 2 bland cheeses. The bread didn't add much, either.Entrees:*Grilled Beef Tenderloin was the best savory dish of the evening--cooked perfectly with a nice spinach foundation and a cheesy gruyere sauce. But nothing I couldn't get anywhere else or make at home, for that matter. And WHY AM I CUTTING MY STEAK WITH A BUTTER KNIFE? Just because it CAN be cut with a butter knife doesn't mean that I don't feel silly doing so.*Slowly Cooked Cod was perfectly flaky, and I loved the crispy lemon crust, but the lemon garlic sauce was too lemony and too salty (and I have a very salty palate in general) and lacked any subtle complexity. The broccoli rabe was lovely, though.Desserts:*Molten Chocolate Cake was perfect. I suppose if you're going to claim that you invented the dish, you'd better serve it up like a MF pro. You HAVE to have his molten chocolate cake. Served with simple vanilla ice cream and shortbread crumbs. So good.*Pineapple Upside-down Cake came with basil ice cream. What can I say, I'm a sucker for herbacious ice cream.For a gal who doesn't have much of a sweet tooth, the desserts really finished strong.

Next I had the Rice Bowl with came with a crispy poached egg which looks and is a poached egg-breaded- which is outrageously addicting. (The Rice bowl had an orange sauce that tasted like a sauce that is served at Spice Market with the Lobster rolls. It was slightly spicy, but tasty as hell.) Also avocado and very hot little chilies, which the chefs are nice enough to put in one corner so one can control how much heat you want. Next was the Chocolate Molton Cake-need I say more...yummy! Oh I almost forgot, my friend ordered the Calamari with Yuzu Dipping Sauce-this was fabulous as well. I highly recommend Perry Street for anyone looking for a neat causal yet elegant brunch/lunch.  I have been here a few times before and cannot believe I never Yelped about it.  All wonderful experiences.

Do yourself a favor, go straight to Perry St. and have some, because for someone like me, who does not even like meat -apart from the occasional ribeye and salmon- this was fantastic. Crispy, giant and delicious. The accompaniments such as the corns and the special sauce even enhance the taste of this wonder more.For starters i recommend the tuna cracker and the calamari, especially the sauce of the calamari is wonderful. They are not heavy though.Desert! Have the chocolate pudding because even if it is small, it is intense and has these violets stuff over it which makes it even more delicious, apart from the creaminess.Wine list could be better. Yes. But cocktails are a nice escape from that option though.In all of Jean Georges restaurants maybe Perry St. is not as trendy as spice market and mercer kitchen -i have been to them all and will eventually review- but it is better than even Nougatine @ Jean Georges. I am really appalled from people who believe it is such a drag to walk a couple blocks to get there cause apparently public transportation does not stop in front of it.

We ate and talked without rushed.The amuse-bouche came in usual espresso cup. It was soup with form on top with lemon color ring around. It was good and comforting. I thought perfect for cold spring rainy day. Initial citrus flavor surprised me. Then, richness of soup followed. This amuse-bouche helped me down my rush-hurry of New York life and anchored me to start to enjoy my dining.I chose Crab salad that I always enjoy. It was good as always. The dressing made it to shine. The tiny chopped shallot in lemon vinaigrette dressing around the mount of crab meat with sliced mango sank me deep into the arched couch.I chose Yellowfin tuna burge for secondr. It was highly suggested by our waiter but it was not for me unfortunately. The fish wasn't fresh enough and fishy taste over power the burger for Japanese. The curly thin sliced chips were good. I guess I never have good experience with fish here. I will remember to skip fish next time.For dessert, I chose pineapple pie (It was like Galette des Rois.

The meat was flavorful and fall off the bone tender.*Crispy fried chicken - I didn't personally try this one but everyone else at my table seemed to like it.-Dessert-*Chocolate pudding - this was essentially a glass layered with chocolate cake, pudding, and some type of creme fraiche. a good dish for chocolate lovers.*Cinnamon dusted doughnuts - this comes with 3 different dipping sauces all were good.*White chocolate cake w/ yuzu sorbet - this was one of our favorite desserts for the night. the white chocolate layered cake was intricate and totally delectable!*Banana bread cake with chocolate ice cream - this was also one of the favorites for the night. The dish was not overpoweringly sweet but it still had the fruit and chocolatey goodness elements.Overall, Perry St is a good but not great restaurant.

However, the place is very spacious and bright with large windows and clean décor, making it an ideal place for families to have meals without having to listen to the table next-door or having to feel cramped in any way like many NYC restaurants. We took advantage for a 3-course prix fixe for $26. JG's American dishes with hints of Korean/Asian flavors were a huge hit with my parents, who don't always like eating this type of cuisine. We had the warm asparagus covered with lemon crumbs (great appetizer), the spinach and goat cheese omelette with crispy potato strips, grilled cod (perfectly cooked and seasoned), salmon with chili sauce (well-balanced) and buttermilk pancakes with mixed berries (not too sweet). Dessert was also delicious - JG's lava chocolate cake was on the menu as was a raspberry tart with sorbet - both were a good way to end the meal.

In each course, one was pretty bad and one was decent but nothing special. Anyway -- the food: Started off with a strawberry gazpacho, it was ok but my friend didn't like it. Then burrata that was too watery with a strange strawberry relish that really ruined it, and calamari that was shockingly delicious since I'm not a big calamari person.

My wife selected the heirloom tomato salad as the appetizer, steamed skate as the entree and molten chocolate cake for dessert.  I ordered the ginger rice bowl as an appetizer (as recommended by our server), fried chicken as the entree, and berry soup as the dessert.  We were first provided with a slice of rustic bread but was a little disappointed in the quality.   Then we received the amuse bouche, which was corn fritters.  Even though my wife doesn't like fried foods, she did enjoy them as they were very light.  Next came our appetizers.  We were stunned at the large portions and quality. The heirloom tomato salad was served warm with a light vinagrette dressing and berries.  The ginger rice bowl contained sliced avocados, panko-breaded lightly-poached egg, pickled ginger, and scallions on top of a bed of seasoned steam jasmine rice.  My wife was full after eating a large majority of our dishes.The entrees were delicious, but not as good as the appetizers.  The steamed skate was lightly flavored with romesco sauce on the bottom and sliced fennel on top.  The fried chicken was boneless and was served with a side of corn relish and a spicy scotch bonnet pepper sauce.  My wife wanted to save room for dessert so I ate most of our entrees. The desserts were spectacular.  The molten chocolate cake was the best I've ever had and came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream (not a spoonful like most restaurants).  The cake was rich and really gooey on the inside.  The berry soup was almost as good and topped with fromage blanc ice cream (French frozen yogurt) and a sweet biscuit that you can dip the soup.The waitstaff didn't rush us so we stayed for about 2 hours.

The only problem I really had with Perry Street was that there was a hair in my amuse (potato soup with citrus foam).  The service overall was okay.  I would recommend Perry Street for a safe and good meal, and for $24, it's a great value that is really hard to come by in the city.  There weren't any dishes that left me in awe, but everything tasted very good and I can't criticize any of the flavors.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

I had no idea that this place was literally located at the edge of Perry St. where it met the westside highway....they did a good job with shielding out the noisy traffic. After the hostess took our drink orders she immediate sent out some bread and butter and a dish of amuse to tickle our palate of what it seemed to be a deep friend potato croquette with a mushroom/truffle cream. After we ordered, she sent out 2 additional complimentary appetizers, a deep fried calamari with a very distinct creamy citrusy froth that sat beautifully plump in the ramkin it was served in. It was delish! The other was a tapenade of some sort with a hint of cinnamon smothered on a thick piece of retangular toast next to house make mozzarella and a citrus fruit salad. I couldn't have asked for a better way to start off our meal. I had the crab toast, which was a layer crab meat with sprinkles of sesame on a perfectly toasted piece of thick white bread that sat on a streak of miso paste, which brought out the flavors of the fresh crab meat. As a entree, I had to go with the juicy, tender, flavorful braised short ribs served on a bed of lentils. An adequate portion may I say.As for dessert, a warm chocolate cake with sliced pears on the side was a decent way to finish up. I give the service and clean presentation a solid 5 stars especially when we found out our wines were also comped as well :) Overall performance: 4.45*s not far enough to round up unfortunately, but good enough to become a fan of this place.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

I ordered the pea soup to start and the fried chicken (both highly recommended) and I barely got through 1/4 of either. The best part of the soup was the croutons.

The large windows facing out to the westside highway provide a very nice view while you are eating dinner. I was able to try everything on the menu since we ordered one of each (the RW menu was pretty limited). The miso crab toast was excellent- full of interesting and spicy flavors. The amuse bouche of potato soup that was brought out prior the appetizer was fantastic. The goat cheese fondue was fine but there was really nothing special to it all. As for the entrees I was pretty underwhelmed. The braised short rib with a green apple reduction was a much better choice than the salmon but neither were impressive. The presentation was nice and simple but for the price during a regular week I would be pretty disappointed. The best part of the evening was the molten chocolate cake which is featured on their regular menu. The pineapple upside down cake with basil ice cream was a strange pairing and the flavors did not work well together all.

It was beautifully presented and so rich, indulgent.  The truffle flavor of the cod was mild with enough kick to be reminded of this nice touch. Cod was cooked right and not at all salty.  The tried and true chocolate cake tasted as good as all the ones you've had at nice restaurants, chocolate oozed out nicely. What made this dish special was its sidekick, the amazing vanilla bean ice cream; it had so much texture and intensity! Nice surprises were the amazing complimentary bites of cheese puffs (starter before the meal) and petite chocolate, green tea dessert  (as a finishing touch).  Drinks are also reasonably priced, in fact, one of the best drinks was the cheapest one-- for  $9, you can savor their Passion Fruit Chili cocktail (Maker's Mark Bourbon, Passion Fruit Chili).  Minimalist, clean, modern, sleek decor like the Modern but with a view of the river, this restaurant is a solid 4.5.NOTE: If you're a first timer at this restaurant like me, the restaurant is at the very end; I accidentally went inside the hotel and immediately knew I was not at the right spot.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

However, everything fell into place that evening. Here's a breakdown:  Appetizer - Squash soup, probably the best I've had to date in terms of taste, texture and presentation.  Once it was served, the waiter proceeded to pour in a hot kettle of tomato puree giving it an added tart flavor.   Main course - Beef tenderloin, that was perfectly prepared medium served with mushrooms (termed ""chanterelles"", I had to ask for a clarification) and potatoes.Dessert - Trio of sorbets: sour apple, lemon and grapefruit. Service was attentive, then again, this was a quiet Sunday evening where most tables were empty.  The ambience was mellow, despite being adjacent to the West Side Highway.  The designers creatively masked the street with a translucent curtain, but not to block the entire view of the river.  I'd return with little reservation, as this experience was extremely pleasant.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

I would say it is equal to my experience at Jean-Georges restaurant Nougatine. My boyfriend and I started out with the soft shelled crab and the rice cracker tuna. The soft shelled crab was a special that day and would say was equally delicious as the tuna. For entree I had the butter poached lobster which had lots of lobster meat and it was served with a thai broth that was tasty and on a bed of spinach. My boyfriend got the short rib and it was the best short rib I have ever had in my life. It was crispy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. It was served with polenta fries that were..well..paradise. For dessert we got the hazelnut frangipane that came with a poached pear. i was less enthused about the dessert but I am more of a chocolate person. The service was excellent. They were so considerate with even little things like pouring the water and making sure it did not get on the person by holding a napkin out.

My friends and I had plans to go to the Spotted Pig nearby, and of course, because they refuse to take reservations there was a 2 hour wait. So, a quick search on Yelp led me to a restaurant that I had on my to-do list for ages. Well, I remembered why once we got inside the stark modern pretentious hotel-like interior: Perry Street is part of the Jean Georges Empire. And it did not fall short of my elevated expectations.To start we shared a few appetizers, the highlight of which was the crispy poached eggs with caviar and vodka cream. I want to spread that vodka cream on every piece of bread I eat from now on. The entrees we sampled at our table were equally tasty: butter poached lobster with lemongrass and lime broth and potato ravioli, grilled Colorado lamb chops with caramelized brussels sprouts and pistachio pesto, and for me- don't judge- the organic fried chicken with Meyer lemon marmalade, crispy black trumpet stuffing and mashed potato. Each dish had something surprising, yet maintained a refined balanced approach to what would otherwise be considered some pretty heavy dishes.Bottom line: save up some money that will be well-spent and go here.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

On that particular evening, we were surrounded by a family celebrating their daughter's birthday, a young couple, and a group having a girl's night out.I was very impressed with the level of professionalism of the entire staff.  Everyone was extremely attentive and willing to answer questions that we had about the menu.Because it was extremely difficult to decide on an appetizer and a main course, we opted for the tasting menu.  The portion sizes were very generous considering the $68 price tag - most of the courses felt as though they were full portions.Our amuse bouche was a butternut squash soup which was perfect.  It was an excellent taste of early autumn.The rice-cracker crusted tuna was the first course and also my favorite.  The tuna was just lightly seared and came with a subtle wasabi mustard.  I also felt that this was the most Asian-infusion inspired dish that we had over the course of the evening.The second course was a very large helping of fresh burrata cheese, with figs and foccaccia with a sweet spread.  It was good, but did not give us an opportunity to experience the fusion of two cuisines.The third course was slowly cooked cod in a vegetable ratatouille.  The cod was perfectly cooked, retained its juices, and just flaked with a fork.  The ratatouille had the faint hint of chili, which gave it just the right amount of spiciness.The last course was supposed to be lamb, but the kitchen had run out.  The fried chicken was the substitute for the evening.  I was a bit disappointed, as I would not normally want to eat fried chicken as part of a tasting menu.  This was a HUGE portion of juicy white meat; the batter used was delicious.The desserts were a small sampling trio: a lime meringue, a banana ice cream, and a miniature warm molten chocolate cake.  The ice cream was surprisingly light and more like sorbet.  All three desserts were divine, but there is nothing in the world as comforting as Jean-George's signature dessert, even in its smaller format.  The green tea and chocolate petit fours were also incredible and the perfect way to finish off an Asian-fusion dinner.Perry Street is on my list of places that I will continue to frequent for dinner and to scope out one of the lunch or brunch deals.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

We had a reservation, but certainly didn't need it as the place had only a smattering of people there for brunch.We stuck to the breakfast-type brunch items as we were not in high-roller moods. (The menu includes a wide variety of appetizers, and more substantial lunch items in addition, but the prices for these items are quite a bit higher.) We were started off with an amuse bouche of roasted peppers which were tasty but not amazing. I ordered the gravlax with poached eggs and toasted brioche. I've never had gravlax before, but it didn't disappoint. I was pleased with the portion size- about 5 nice long slices- especially for the reasonable price, and it went really well with the poached eggs and brioche. My friend ordered the spinach and goat cheese omelette, which she got with egg whites only, and said it was very tasty. Her side of pork and jalepeno sausage was just so-so.With fresh-squeezed juice for me and coffee for my friend, the bill came to a little under $50 (not including tip).

526,DBxOepgF4ol1jTuOdDAofg,Ashley D.,4.0 star rating,"Jean-George Vongerichten's  8th restaurant in the city, Perry Street is a very sleek and minimalistic restaurant which includes minimal ornamentation such as simple hanging lights. However, the comfort of the wood tables and the soft white colors also made me feel like we were in someone's living room. You can tell, as soon as you enter, that it was designed by Richard Meier, the same architect who designed the parent building in which it's located.Located at Perry Street and West Side Highway, the restaurant's window front also provides amazing sunset views! We decided to start with cocktails instead of wine for a fun change of pace.The Thyme Lemonade cocktail was refreshing and a not too sweet take on the traditional lemonade. The Citron Vodka was mixed with club soda and a lemon thyme syrup, resulting in a delicious cocktail which went down far too quickly.We were in no mood to rush and therefore decided to split a small appetizer between us before ordering our appetizers and main course. The chilled Peekytoe crab salad did not disappoint! Unlike any crab salad I've ever had, it was topped with fresh summer vegetables, crisp to the bite, and a champagne mango vinaigrette. The smooth crab flavor against the fresh, crisp vegetables left me craving more than just a small plate portion!We followed our waiter's appetizer recommendation for the appetizer course. Tuna is one of my favorite fish, whether grilled or served sashimi style, so I knew I couldn't resist their signature dish, rice cracker crusted tuna. On the menu since opening day, this dish was served with a Siracha emulsion which was perfect for dipping. Always a sucker for sweet breads, Bo ordered the appetizer special which was a summer take on sweet breads, paired with freshly grilled peaches and a Siracha glaze. I don't care for sweet bread so can't directly speak to their flavor but I know Bo loved them! Choosing a main course was a more difficult task as many items sounded wonderful, especially the fish dishes! I finally decided on the pistachio grilled cod accompanied with summer vegetables and chanterelle mushrooms. Unfortunately, the dish was lacking flavor though the cod was cooked perfectlyBo's chicken was the real winner of the evening as it was a creative and perfectly executed spin on the southern classic, fried chicken with creamed corn.  One boneless breast and one boneless thigh were served with rich creamed corn that was perfectly seasoned.  The chicken also came with an interesting scotch bonnet hot sauce which enhanced the flavor even more by contrasting the creaminess of the corn.  Bo thought that it was one of the best dishes that he's had in a while.The service continued to amaze us through the final portion of the meal, a complimentary serving of strawberry French style macarons. I personally don't care for these one bit. I'll take a coconut macaroon over a macaron any day if I have my choice. But, according to Bo, who loves all things French, these were soft and delicious with a subtle sweet strawberry flavor. Overall, we were both very pleased with the service and meal. While I'm not sure we would go again, as there are so many restaurants in New York City,  I would recommend it to anyone. The sunset views and friendly service made the atmosphere more relaxed than stuffy.

First - the amuse bouche was a slighly over-salted (but I can't complain about that - love my salt) strawberry soup with cucumber foam. For my starter course I had a wonderful (not exquisite, but very good) cream of tomato soup.  A crostini covered with finely grated Parmesian and basil chiffonade was was balanced above the bowl.  The soup was poured from a separate serving dish = fancy.  My coworker had some amazing Arctic Char sashimi with a lemon-oil vinegarette and some sort of fried curles on top.  Both were good - hers was better. For the main course I indulged in a ginger-rice bowl that featured a poached egg that had then been dredged in tempura flakes and lightly fried.  It tasted amazing and provided a a perfect sauce-capsule for the rice, ginger dressing, scallions and red pepper in the bowl. My coworker Barbara (shout out!) had really good sea bass that had been fried in chili oil.  It had a great aroma and hit the back of the palette very nicely.  I washed this down with a delicious ginger soda. For dessert I had crepes with a side of apricot icecream and apricot compote.  Mmmmm...the icecream was resting on a delicious cookie-crumble.  Barbara feasted on a molten chocolate cake with pistachio icecream (that tasted like Starburst!  In a good way). Highly recommended.  Not crowded for lunch.  Delicious and affordable way to experience Msr. Jean-Gorge.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"
536,QJcfJTgI3XLdluTDzkRNpQ,Jerry H.,5.0 star rating,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our meal last night. We had the tasting menu which was very reasonably priced in my mind for 6 super delicious and innovative dishes ($78).  The wines were very good and we appreciated the 2.5 ounce pour which was only $0.25 more than half the price of a regular 5 ounce glass since we got to try a number of different wines. The timing of the food was excellent and the wait staff very polished and attentive.  The ambience was exceptional and unusual in that the restaurant was relatively quiet even when full.Only negative was that with the ambience comes a very dark table where it is difficult to see the superlative dishes.  I think a low wattage lamp on the table would solve that problem.,Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

I understand why Chef Jean George is one of the best.  I'm not going to list what i ate because  I feel all his food is great, try what appeals to you at the moment.  If your lucky enough to get David the Irish boy/man he was a great waiter.  But even more a great person.  David started off very professional but being he was serving a gay couple he learned quickly to just be himself.  Ask for David.  one last thing if they have the passion fruit sorbet take some home you will want to bathe in it.  I was an executive pastry chef for 2 1/2 years in nyc and this was the bomb!",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"
539,kG4BZhThGjPTw3DMKm2Qfw,Dreyfus W.,5.0 star rating,"On July 22nd, one of the hottest days this summer, my wife and I decided to visit our very first Jean-Georges' restaurant. After walking in the summer heat, the blast of cold air as we opened their doors was just a treat in itself. Perry St. has a modern look to it, the space is very ....flowy.    My wife went with their restaurant week menu which to me wasn't extensive as I have wanted it to be but then again, I don't always get what I want. So I chose from their regular. The dishes offered were quite delightful. It seem like everyone enjoyed the rice cracker crusted tuna, so we gave it a shot. The crust paired very well with the tuna, not so much that it gave away the natural flavor of the fish. The whole dish with the Sriracha sauce was a combination of sweet and salty and we both took pleasure in devouring it. We also had a taste of the snapper sashimi; a light, fresh,cool and citrusy dish, just seem appropriate in the summer days.      For mains I had the Scottish salmon with white asparagus, bok choy and an herbal chili sauce. I had many salmon dishes before but never paired with herbal chili sauce. The taste of the sauce reminded me of the green sauce that comes with samosas served at Indian restaurants but this one was lighter, and far less spicier. My wife delighted herself in the grilled cod with seasoned veggies. By the looks of her, she enjoyed the vegetables more than she did with the cod. But still a light a tasty entree.      The service was very warm and friendly. Not too intrusive during your meal and everything was brought to us without asking. I will def. come back but not looking forward to the walk from the train station.      What I wanted to do but couldn't because of the heat was to walk along the pier by the Hudson River.

We were a bit underwhelmed by the crispy poached eggs with caviar and vodka cream (nice to try once, but would not be a repeat order). As for entrees: I ordered the butter poached lobster with keffir lime broth & potato ravioli, and loved it. Lobster and ravioli were cooked to perfection and the flavors just sang. I was able to taste the black sea bass and braised short rib entree, both were delicious. The fish was cooked perfectly and the short ribs had this great caramelized onion taste.

We also loved the Sweet Pea Soup with Tumbleweed Cheese, Pea Shoots and Sourdough Croutons ($11), specifically for its subtle creaminess.  I considered the Grilled Cod with Market Vegetables ($28) thoughtless and bland, but almost launched across the table for another bite of the potato raviolis that came with the Butter Poached Lobster and Lemongrass Kaffir Lime Broth (MP).  The Grilled Beef Strip Loin with Cheddar-Jalapeno Fritters looked fantastic ($36.50), but then again, you had me at 'fritter'.Three hours later and I was still dreaming about my pre-dinner Ginger Margarita with its Ginger Salted Rim - exquisite.bravo JG, you struck again.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

See attached link....nymag.com/listings/resta… It turned out to be an excellent choice.  It came in a big round creation with the bacon and asparagus and croutons stuffed in the egg.  The combination of flavors gel'd so nicely in my mouth...I was able to try the Housemade Gravlax poached eggs, toasted brioche which was prettty good.  Fried Chicken spicy pea puree, basil vinaigrette was one piece of boneless chicken and was delicious.  Highly recommended and will likely have the next time I'm there...Char-grilled Cheese Burger russian dressing and crispy onions was ok and typical.  I've been on a burger run lately and it didn't do it for me.  Just good.  The fries didn't do it for me.  Would be soooo much better if they did shoestring or sweet potato fries.....Dessert was a choice of Warm Chocolate Cake and vanilla ice cream or assorted berries and lady fingers with ice cream as well.    Both were excellent.  Different flavors so either go fruity or do chocolate :)Service was excellent as you would expect in a JG establishment...",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"
546,mvxFIHnm50_91TA3tZSL4w,Gaurav P.,3.0 star rating,"***Disclaimer: NYC Restaurant Week Review January 2011***...Keeping the restaurant TWO weeks scene alive as we headed to Perry Street last night for dinner. It was very easy to find as my date noticed it at the corner of Perry Street and West Street however if you weren't looking exactly up and to the right, you'll walk right past it. Perry Street has a very romantic feel to it as it's extremely dimly lit which you'll notice after you've been seated by the very courteous and prompt hostess. She greeted us in and asked to take our coats right away. We were then brought to our table but ALAS, they hadn't noticed/read my request for a corner table or side-by-side seating which I mentioned to the gentleman who was seating us, at which point he turned around and offered us Table #1 which was a corner booth..quite a lovely table UNTIL the door opens and closes when folks need to come in/out of the restaurant. This is not so much fun on 20 degree nights...but it was still a lovely table.Fermented Grape Juice:+ Evening Land 2008 Chardonnay. Fantastic bottle of a buttery oak Chardonnay, rich, smooth, a bit lighter than you'd expect and complemented our food very well.- The issue we had wasn't with the wine itself, it was the fact that the wine bottle was stored at room temperature!! And they had us taste room temperature 72degree white wine? ugh. The worst part is, they have 2 beautiful HUGE wine fridges that are taller than me behind the bar...how do you serve white wine like this? And folks let me tell you, it wasn't just a few degrees warm, it was stored at room temperature as confirmed by the server. At that point, I asked them to un-cork it and put it in an ice bucket which didn't do the trick after 15-20 minutes so they put the opened bottle in the freezer upon my request. After another 15 minutes, the wine was then ""drink-able"". They served us a glass of house white wine in the interim which was almost at the state of vinegar. :( ...this was sad because it was a nice start to the evening.Foodstuffs:- Peekytoe Crab Toast with Miso Mustard and Shiso. This was a very interesting dish...the crab on top was laden with copious amounts of sesame seeds and overall the dish in my opinion was lacking something. I think the concept was good, the presentation was on-spot however the toast/crab combo was just blah? The miso mustard on the side was phenomenal.+ Butternut Squash Soup with Mimolette & Crouton. This was nothing shy of fantastic. Creamy, fattening, rich and velvety. The croutons on the bottom were a nice surprise touch and burst of crunchy texture in your mouth and the mimolette was a nice touch. Well done guys!- Black Truffle Crusted Cod, Celeriac with Lemon and Butter. Anything with truffle excites me beyond belief nowadays...You know truffle anything is a bit pricey so it makes you feel even better that it's on the restaurant week menu. However, the cod was extremely bland and the celeriac was just blah. :(+ Onion Lacquered Short Rib of Beef. This was served on a bed of lentils and I have to tell you that this dish was damn good. Wasn't the best short ribs I've ever had but it was really good...the lentils were a great touch along with the onions.+ Fruit salad with White Chocolate Ice Cream. You feel good ordering fruit salad for dessert which seemed to have been served in a rosewater soup. The white chocolate ice cream was good but not *shockingly* good as I thought it would be.+ Valrhona Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream. YUM. This chocolate cake was perfect, smooth, firm and velvety on the outside, liquidy and gooey on the inside. Nice job guys!If it wasn't for the white wine disaster in which it took 50+ minutes since the moment we sat down to enjoy our first sip and a lackluster cod dish, Perry Street would get 4 Yelps from me. But alas, it gets 3. I'll go back again if I were in the area, perhaps for brunch to give them another shot.

Our daughter, who lives in Australia, is engaged. In March she and her fiance were in New York, and we organized an engagement dinner for them at Jean-Georges Vongerichten's Perry St. Restaurant. We were the old folks. All the rest were longtime friends of our daughter, plus their significant others, plus our daughter and her fiance. The staff at Perry St. did a remarkable and perfect job. Seth, the general manager, made lots of promises as the arrangements were made, and delivered on all of them, including menu recommendations. Debbie, their wine sommelier, was likewise extremely helpful. Our waiter was there at every moment and did a flawless job. Even the bartender was making sure everything was working right for us. We started with drinks and cold appetizers in a side area as everyone arrived, then moved to a large table in front of the bar, separated from the other tables so our party noise did not bother other patrons. It's a great setup. They had custom menus printed for everyone. Jean-Georges himself came by to give his regards to our daughter. Then after the meal his son Cedric, the Executive Chef at Perry St., came out to visit with the group. Our menu: Cold appetizers for people as they arrived, in the lounge area: Rice cracker crusted tuna, with a sriracha-citrus emulsion; and a special homemade mozzarella appetizer not on the regular menu served in a Japanese-style soup spoon. First course: King oyster mushroom and avocado carpaccio, with charred jalapeno olive oil and lime; or sweet chili crab dumplings, with cilantro and celery root. Main course: Cod with miso yuzu glaze, baby bok choy and sriracha; or their signature deboned lightly-fried chicken, with mushroom spaetzle and ginger vinaigrette; or grilled tenderloin of beef, gruyere dumplings, rainbow chard and cornichon. Dessert: Poached pear, warm hazelnut fragipane and chocolate-amaretto truffle; or passion fruit souffle with passion fruit ice cream; or ""chocolate pudding,"" layers of chocolate cake and pudding with fresh cream and crystallized violets. Wines: With the cold appetizers and as everyone arrived, Pascal Jolivel Sancerre, Chateau de Nozay, 2007, Loire Valley, France and Domaine Drouhin Pinot Noir, 2007, Willamette Valley, Oregon. With the meal, Domaine de la Cadette Chardonnay, La Chatelaine, 2007, Vezelay, Burgundy, France, and Chateau Thenac Bordeaux (almost), Fleur du Perigord, 2006, Bergerac, France. Everything was so tasty, so interesting, and so well plated. It was one taste treat after another, starting with the melt-in-your-mouth rice cracker crusted tuna and ending with all the various chocolate flavors and delicious cream in the dessert.

It was accompanied most wonderfully with a mushroom spaetzle that added a nice texture to the dish and was flavored in a way that put me in mind of a spicy home cooked stuffing.I savored that fried chicken. That amazing fried chicken.And at $19.50 off the a la carte dinner menu, it is surprisingly affordable for one to savor.Another option for savoring this chickeny goodness is to come for the prix fixe lunch, which they offer year round, seven days a week, for $26.  The portion size at lunch was substantially smaller than the dinner portion (I guess that's to be expected), but you'll also get a chance to tack on another dish and a dessert (such as their molten lava cake - a chocolate O.D. in the making).In terms of ambiance, the typical Jean-Georges clean lines and muted tones, along with quirky staggered exposed light bulbs in the lounge area, make this a great neighborhood destination that's not too fancy for an impulsive meal out.Even if it were a hovel, though, I'd come here....Why?Um...have I FAWNED over the fried chicken enough?? Did I mention yet that this is the best fried chicken I've had in NYC?  Yes, this includes BonChon, Amy Ruth's, etc. And, yes, I SO went there.  And, yes, once you try this fried chicken, I'm confident you will SO go there, too.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

Maybe because I decided to go cheap and try the spring promotion (I came a while ago...so things might have changed) instead of going all out for a place like this. Don't get me wrong, the decor was chic white, ambiance elegant (too dark for me though), the food was good, and the price for the spring promotion at the time was pretty decent for non-socialites. But just not too memorable, and I lack the desire to go back.BEET CARPACCIO - Pretty tasty considering how I normally don't do beets. I figured why not try something new, and I'm glad I did because it was thinly sliced in a light dressing that complemented the beet taste. I would say refreshing. But I don't love it.PAN-ROASTED SKATE - Fresh white fish variety. It was a medium portion as an entree with some sauteed spinach I believe. The cool part was the foamy stuff all over it. Good but not awesome.FRANGIPANE TORTE - Rich and yummy... I don't remember if I had finished the last bite because it was so rich. The scoop of ice cream on graham cracker crumbs that came with it was however, quickly devoured.Overall it was a good and tasty meal at a Jean Georges', which would and should merit a solid 4 stars in my opinion, but the lack of WOW factor, combined with the reputation it should live up to, and last but not least, the TOO DIM of lighting that all constitutes a 3.5 stars for me.

I don't mind not having big portions; however, I do mind having flavorless food. What it lacked in quantity it certainly did not make up for in quality.But I must say the Passion Fruit Souffle exceeded my expectations.

The windowed walls look out onto the river and the ambiance is very relaxing and inviting. Before my food came, I got an amuse-bouche (yeah, it's that kind of place) of strawberry gazpacho. This is when I start to get a little turned on. My first course comes, the crab dumplings. Perfect portions, amazing flavors, and what tastes like the freshest (most fresh?) crab I've ever eaten. Next, I got this eggs and bacon thing. It was sort of like a frittata with two fried eggs on top. If you love runny egg yolks (a long love of mine) then this is a great brunch option. For dessert, I had a choice of molten chocolate cake and...(who cares about the other option..).

We were taking a friend out to dinner - we walked as we live in the neighborhood - he was so surprised when we stopped here as there was very little to announce the restaurant's presence until we walked through the doorrs, and then he let out a sigh of delight.The appetizers were great - especially the Grilled Spanish octopus. The Grilled Lamb Chops were perfectly cooked as was the Arctic Char. We also ordered the Roasted Hake which did not live up to the other two dishes -  kind of dull both in presentation and taste. The sauces and garnishes were amazing, though, and perfectly complimented the main dishes. The amuse bouche of shot glasses of soup was fantastic, as was the bread (warm), and the chocolates that accompanied the check. They were wonderful touches that just added to the enjoyment of the meal and the conversation.The wine list was good, and the wait staff were especially helpful with us in that regard.In fact the wait stafff was excellent -relaxed, professional, helpful, and efficient without being pushy.. They did not have that phony friendliness that is a pain to endure, yet they somehow  managed to express a genuine care and concern that our meal would be a success. .The design of the restaurant is top notch with wonderful ambient lighting, noise reducing materials - though the music was a tad too loud for a Wednesday night - and thoughtfully accessorized.

I started with the seared ahi tuna with rice cracker crust. The tuna was grade A but the crust was more hearty than I would have liked - I found it took away from the quality of the tuna more than accentuated it. This dish included a heaping helping of Sriracha aoli with green onions. The amount of aoli was a bit much and it looked like they were trying to justify it as a legitimate side on the plate, rather than purely a sauce. The main course was very good and more than made up for the slightly better than average starter. I had the grilled cod with a medly of green vegetables - including broccoli rabe, fava beans, English peas and asparagus tips. The dish was topped with a light sprinkling of ground hazelnuts and light drizzle of lemon buerre blanc. The quality of ingredients - from the cod to the vegetable medly - was apparent.The dessert was a very decadent Valhrona molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. All in all a pleasant experience in a modern, cool yet casual space. The service did not give off a sense of entitlement despite being a Jean-Georges establishment.

Perry St has a serene and elegant atmosphere and it's one of the few restaurants in NYC where you can acually have a quiet conversation. It's classy and upscale, but not stuffy.

It's a lemon marinated chicken breast and the spices in the batter are just amazing. The wild rice with this dish is also the best I've ever had. Pure perfection.Short ribs - 3* A little too fatty for my taste and didn't fall apart as easily as I had hoped. The cannellini bean side dish that comes with was phenomenal though.Cod - 3* Was my least favorite dish. Wasn't as buttery as other cod filets I've had and the compote seamed pretty standard and didn't wow us. Perry St Candy bar - 3* I love chocolate so I liked this one but my 2 friends were less enthusiastic about this chocolate mouse-like bar.Caramelized banana cake - 2* bananas weren't caramelized at all (I was expecting something a little more bananas foster like) and the cake was a little dry.Cinnamon dusted donuts - 4* my personal favorite. Came with apple, chocolate and lemon dipping sauces but I could just eat these warm donuts plain. Another plus about Perry St - the tables have decent spacing in between them so its one of the few Manhattan restaurants where you don't feel like you're sitting on top of the person next to you.

588,pGyY42QiNRHvZ-ZN4LEvEw,Laura A.,4.0 star rating,"Cedric-Vongerichten: Jean-George's son, Perry street's executive Chef since August 2009 , and the one who makes us experience innovation with the most fresh ingredients for that special family dinner.  To be described as ""one of the most celebrated chefs on the planet"" at Wikipedia is pretty impressive. I can't tell if Jean Georges is one of the best, but for what I got at Perry Street it worth a visit to find out. Jean-Georges Vongerichten is the face and name at Perry Street but the one who is behind in the kitchen can't be closer. I'm sure to growth up living the Master's passion for cook has play the main role in Cedric's cook qualities more than the genetic background.. but genes are genes and since Jean Georges says he got it from his grandma and mother, maybe the cook talent is imprinted in this family  The menu is clearly Asian inspired, which I guess you already know I love more than any other, and is coming from Jean-Georges living time in Thailand.  We shared 2 appetizers:  Black pepper crab dumplings with sauteed sugar snaped peas and unfortunately? the Crispy Calamari Yuzu Dipping sauce and Sesame, just because they run out of tuna that night and so we couldn't get the Rice Cracker Crusted Tuna. 3 things I loved about the dumplings: the sweet and viscous soy sauce, the abundant and tasty crab, and the delicate dough. The calamari was ""just"" fried calamari rings but here I first notice the freshness. No signs of the Yuzu sauce I think.. or the guy is just that creative that make it as a very interesting mayonnaise? the fact is that the dipping sauce was white, like mayonnaise with a texture that I have never seen before for this sauce; delicate and light as air. Delicate taste as well and topped with sesame seeds that made it unique. As main entrees I ordered Japanese Snapper Sashimi with Lemon Olive Oil and Crispy Skin. The tastier snapper slices I had ever, superfresh and not as thin as sashimi use to be presented. Small jalapeño rings to add life to some of the bites and topped with curly fried skin pieces, crunchy and tasty... ahh I loved it. The Cod with Lemmon Crumbs Sweet Garlic Broth and Brocoli Rabe was delicious. The main feature is the piece of cod, which laminates with every touch. The Lemmom crumbs, a layer over the cod, was amazing in flavor, it was just perfect. Dad didn't like the brocoli that much. I liked tho, it was a little bit bitter. Same experience for the Slowly Cooked Salmon with Passion fruit-olive oil emulsion, spinach jalapeño and black olive. The salmon was cooked just perfect with that semicook texture that is my favorite for salmon. No traces of fat in the piece signal of a fish that still runs free in the water...I think.. seriously the fish was really high quality, as well as the cod. But there is more. The passion fruit emulsion couldn't be better but what I was surprised with was the salty olive paste over the salmon. Mix everything together and enjoy. Dessert time.. We choose the Fig tart with Pistachio Frangipaneand concord grape sorbet. Cinnamon and sugar. Sweet. Old style dessert, like the grandma cakes, Its something that you should to try. The trio of sorbets (mango, pear and kiwi this time) was really refreshing and well done. Creamiest than a regular sorbet and looked like homemade sorbet. The coffee, the glass of Porto wine and the complementary chocolates parfaits was the perfect end.   I'd be really sad if Cedric disappoint me with the pre fixe menu, that as I mention before, this deals must reach same level as regular menu. Lets see what happen. Just a last note; Cedric is not only Jean George's son. I have read somewhere that he spent several months working with Ferran Adria, El bulli's Chef (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El…). The restaurant where I bet every single foodie wants to eat sometime.... if you are enough lucky to get a table during the just six months that is open to public. Innovation and successful craziness (molecular gastronomy)  is what Ferran perform in his lab-kitchen. Cedric was trained for his father and must be influenced by Ferran Adria as well, both of them are a name in the Chef world and as I said, Perry street was enough good to find out if I'll became a fan of the Vongerichtens",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

There were two options for every course. I went with the crab dumpling, slow cooked salmon, and the exotic fruit desert. The crab dumpling had some of the freshest crab I ever had, with a perfectly cooked steamed wrap loosely places outside the crab meat, and a sweet/spicy asian sauce with some crunchy julienned zucchini (?). Really really good, light and refreshing. THE BEST PART OF THE WHOLE MEAL was the slow-cooked salmon and damn, did they cook it slow!! Not because it took a long time to get to the table, but because that was the lightest, most perfectly cooked, freshest salmon I ever had. It was just the way I like it. Super light and barely flaky (because it was cooked so lightly!). The salmon was over some chopped parsnips and red cabbage which had a hint of cider vinegar, horseradish and honey. The dessert was 'meh..'.. the ice cream was the best part... the lil biscotti on the top was not very nice and the overcooked fruit in simple syrup was a bit too... well, simple. The service was good, but slightly snooty - but I guess that can be expected from this sort of place. The front dining area was freezing!

NYC, your restaurants excel at 95% of what matters, but the restrooms even at some of the finest places are really gross and it really takes away from the experience. But I digress...The majority of my experience at Perry St., the aspects people would be most interested in (food quality, taste, and presentation, as well as the service) were impeccable. I had a not very memorable amuse bouche (a kind of fritter, I believe), but also had burrato for the first time, and it's now my newest addiction. I also had a substantial steak, perfectly cooked, paired with an excellent vegetable puree. The service was 100% amazing. No pretentiousness whatsoever, no hovering, and no disappearing acts. I was celebrating with a friend of mine and had brought some mini-cupcakes from ""Baked by Melissa"", and I felt pretty gauche about wanting to eat them for dessert in the restaurant. But the waitstaff had no issue with it--they even offered to take the cupcakes and plate them for us which is one of the classiest moves I've seen. And I hate to harp on the bathroom because it really seems so minor--but there are only two there and they were just completely filthy. So much so that I had to warn the French woman and her daughter who were in line (in line! for the bathroom! at 10pm on a Saturday!) that they may want to consider waiting until I let the maitre'd know so they could take care of it. At least it gave me a chance to use my French skills. Anyway, I wish I could give Perry St. 4.5 stars, because it really does excel at the 95% that most of us care about.

Good flavor.My husband had the beef tenderloin, they accidentally brought out someone's lamb to him but corrected the order quickly.  His tenderloin was really delicious and came with thick cut potato fries and.For dessert we shared the passion fruit souffle which was good but the passion fruit flavor was VERY strong and the ice cream they served it with was passion fruit too with passion fruit seeds on top so all around LOTS of passion fruit.  I thought the flavor could've been more subtle but love the texture of souffle so it was still good.Definitely a good spot for a date or a business dinner, I would return.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

Admittedly, this is the most I've ever paid for a meal, but it was definitely worth it. The room has great views of the water, and the service was excellent, even though the food took forever to come out (they apologized profusely). For appetizers, we had the sweet chili crab dumplings (amazing, spicy yet sweet!) and the crispy calamari (a huge portion, and very crispy yet not at all greasy) and then the fried chicken (as good as they say, though the mushroom spatzle on the side was my favorite) and the burger (very tasty with great salty fries). We both had the infamous chocolate cake for dessert, which I liked (though it was very rich), and my boyfriend was not as thrilled by, yet still ate all of it.

I also really enjoyed my entree, butter poached lobster; the potato gnocchi was excellent, and went perfectly with the lemongrass and kaffir lime broth.I usually find dessert at these couture-like dinner places to be less satisfying than the simpler treats at places like Serendipity or Max Brenner, but I feel compelled to say that the white chocolate and meringue with yuzu sorbet and basil was pretty fulfilling. The cherry jubilee with pistachio ice cream was a little too tart for me, but my friend seemed to enjoy it a lot.Overall, if you have a few hours to go to the middle of nowhere, indulge in some pricey-but-worthwhile food, and don't mind eating at a restaurant that's basically in the middle of the highway, I would strongly recommend Perry Street.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

I saw this handsome man sitting with his spreading arms in the corner booth with two older gentlemen (probably some movie producers or investors) and I had no idea that it was him until these girls asked him for a photo when he got up to leave. Although I am not his biggest fan, he was kind enough to stop for a second and smiled at all the diners. While he was there, I think his wife and kids stopped by as well, but at that moment, I was not paying too much attention to his table.  I am slow like that. And unfortunately, that was the only highlight of my meal there.Now that Restaurant Week has turned into Restaurant Year at the JG empire, The $26 prix-fixe is still a great lunch deal, if you choose wisely.  I went a la carte, so I will just talk about my eating companion's dishes.  She went all out and got two entrees instead, which really were not a lot because the portions were not huge.  I would say if you want to get an appetizer, get the calamari because what I saw was a heaping pile of fried goodness at the table next to me. My friend chose the salmon and steak with the seafood came first.  The salmon was cooked to tenderness, though the sauce was too sour and the pickled white asparagus was too salty, which overshadowed the freshness of the fish.  The steak was just two small stripes over this pink, mushy sauce and these overburnt shoestring fries served over some pallid mashed potatoes. Again, the steak was a bit oversalted and it just did not go well with the sauce and random white beans.  Just a bit odd...The best course was probably the molten chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice-cream.  The most enjoyable presentation thus far.  The other offering was lemon mousse, but when you are at a JG restaurant, you always, always get the chocolate.  Service was medicore, though water was refilled consistently.  When dessert was presented, we were not asked if we wanted coffee/tea. I would have ordered tea (since I felt bad for just getting one dish), but since he did not ask, well, I got my tea at a nearby deli instead. It is a bit of a trek to walk there from the nearest subway station, but the view is nice (Hudson River) and you do get to avoid the crowds.  No wonder Mr. Jackman was there instead of Columbus Square.

However, with the restaurant week menu and the full menu to choose from... Oh yeah regular menu won out! We ordered the barrata and the crab dumplings to start - both were outstanding! They came it very very quickly which was fine, we were still enjoying our cocktails.... The bread and butter then came to the table and then the glasses for our   Bottle of wine. The table got very very crowded... Once finished with our apps, we ordered another cocktail and before it even was able to arrive out came our entrees! Striped bass and the butter pouched lobster... Both amazingly tasty. However, It was like a speed round of eating! It's a shame as the food deserved time to enjoy and talk about how wonderful it was.... We at that point had to choose, our cocktails or an entire bottle of wine... Certainly not enough time  (nor food left to enjoy it with ) to enjoy a whole bottle of wine, so we went the cocktail route.  I'm not sure why they even bother delivering bread and butter when they don't give you time to eat it! I will say the very cute manager came to apologize for the speed in which the food was delivered and explained that they weren't trying to rush us, but during restaurant week the tickets are fired quite quickly...and they sent out comp deserts.  Very nice and sweet of them to try to make it right.  It's shame that because of restaurant week we were lured in there and then instead of the $38 prix fix we opted for a bill that was $190 and thats after we cancelled the bottle of wine.  If we had a bit more time we would have spent 7x the prix fix amount.I would return, as the food was amazing and tasty and presently beautifully.  The staff overall was lovely , our experience would have been very different I am sure if it wasn't restaurant week.Perhaps in the future I would try it again...",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

625,cbTAq-Avnt_zt-xOg6OGaA,Mandy L.,3.0 star rating,"3.5 starsWhat I love the most about this restaurant is its location.  Situated on the very west end of Perry Street on the ground level of architect Richard Meier's beautiful and modern (yet unassuming) residential building, Jean-Georges' Perry St. is gorgeous.  It is simple, everything adorned in white, but that's why it's so great.  You look out the floor-to-ceiling glass windows and there are no obstructed views by other tall buildings.  All you see is cobblestone streets, the Hudson River, and the park that runs along the river.  What you don't see is a lot of people walking in every direction.  I felt like I was out of NYC.  I can't say I love the food as much as I like the location/decor though.  I went a few times and returned more recently for brunch.  Often, I thought many of the dishes were too salty.  For brunch, I ordered the grilled beef hanger steak (a little too salty and chewy) and the black pepper crab dumplings (was okay).  A friend ordered the yellowfin tuna burger and said it was too dry.  What was good was the slowly cooked salmon.  Think this is on many Jean-Georges restaurant menus and is always a safe bet... always good.  Others said the arctic char sashimi was good.  I liked the dessert the most, even though it was just a simple chocolate molten cake.  They also have an affordable wine list.So the food is only okay, but I love the space.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

Yet to our surprise after swallowing we noticed it was goat cheese. They tricked us! Anywho before we can finish our first piece of bread they asked if we wanted seconds and as soon as I put down my fork, my appetizer plate was gone. While I like prompt service, I found the french waiters professional but a little zealous. I had the salmon entree and this was surrounded by frothy milk. Interesting, but my friend sent hers back as she does not like milk and within 10 minutes she had the beef entree on the RW menu. Our desserts were chocolate lava cakes and fresh berries with ice cream. Both were delicious. We also received large glasses of free prosecco at the bar following our meal.The food was great but given the location and the nondescript but trendy atmosphere, I am not sure I would be back anytime soon.

Shout out to Sheena (good luck with the sommelier thing). Food: Kind of disappointing! I have to say, I was expecting to love this place. I liked Nougatine (another one of the JG conglomerate restaurants) a lot, so Perry was an automatic step for me. But the food fell short. The amuse bouche was a nice starter, a good broccoli cream soup. The meals were more of the issue. We got the burrata, which wasn't made traditionally, being not at all creamy (more like normal mozzarella), and with a kind of bizarre, non matching citrus sauce. I got the bass, whihc was much fishier than I expected. The cous cous, which was middle eastern, didn't mesh so well with the asian-like sauce that the fish was bathed in (a lemony type of taste, whereas the cous cous was I believe cilantro-turmeric). I did, however, like the fried portobello sticks. Of course I did. They were deep fried.The calamari were kind of odd. Actually, to clarify, the calamari itself were nice - but the sauce,with a predominantly egg white flavor, was very odd, especially when paired with the calamari.The table also got the fried chicken (which came with something akin to stuffing). This was by far my favorite dish of the evening, but even then, the chicken was a little dry.Overall, I didn't really hate the food, but didn't love it either. Too many bizarre pairings that didn't marry well.I did, however, appreciate the range of prices on the wine list - from 24 bucks (what?!?! that was amazing.) to the more expensive.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

I finally caught the attention of the Server (who had not come to our table at all except to pour water the first time I sat down) and told him we would like to order a drink.  He seemed caught off guard by this, but said no problem, and put the order in.  The manager who came over and took our order brought over the drinks after making them at the bar.  She then started to clear our dishes off the table, and there was still Calamari on the plate, but instead of asking if we were finished, she just picked up the plates, and then with a confused look asked if she forgot to put in the order of Calamari for us.  I told her that it was sent out to us from the kitchen, and then she just looked and said, oh ok, and walked away with our plates, and calamari that I was intending to finish.  Sure I could have said I wasn't finished, but I just got a vibe from the manager, like we were being more of an inconvenience to her instead of customers that wanted to enjoy lunch and spend some money.  I know this is Restaurant week, and it's not the most enjoyable time for people in the restaurant industry, because they just assume most people will be cheap.  However we didn't even do Restaurant week, we did the year round tasting menu they have.After I had called the server over the first time, he continued to check up on us periodically.  He was a nice guy, but seemed a bit confused as to the manager taking our order.  It was really the Manager though, that made us feel like we had to rush.  We didn't even finish our meals, we actually had them pack up the Tuna Burgers to go after we had 1/2 of them.  If we were being inconvenient to the restaurant by coming in as late as we were, they could have told us we might be a bit rushed due to the kitchen closing instead of making the lunch more of a rush and go feel instead of a nice enjoyable date.  Mind you by the time we sat til the time we paid the bill, it was only 50 min.  It was also a 3 course meal",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

Food was innovative and well-flavored/well-seasoned. The portions were just right, too; not too small and not too large (although after 5 courses I was stuffed...If I had 2 courses a la carte it would have been perfect). Crab dumplings had a sweet filling, plenty of crab, chewy/toothy but supple wrapper, and extremely fragrant broth. The meat and fish were both perfectly cooked, the fish tender and meat to the requested doneness. The only gripe is that the lamb tasted a tad bit gamier than it should have, possibly because the fat wasn't trimmed as much as it should have been. Also, the fish tasted perfect only when eaten with the garnish, i.e. fish was underseasoned and garnish was overseasoned.

I just dont think fried chicken can get that special.  In fact I think bonchon is way more flavorful and addicting than any other chicken I've had, including the supposedly famed JG fried chicken.  Desserts were a choice between the chocolate cake with ice cream or the exotic fruit salad with white pepper ice cream. Both are good, just depends on whether you want to go decadent or light.  I'm willing to go back, perhaps for the brunch menu where you get more options to try out.   But I definitely won't come back for the RW dinner menu - there are better menus out there.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

The service is really great, and the ambiance is laid-back but trendy and a little romantic. The space is surprisingly smaller than I'd anticipated, far fewer tables than I would have thought, which I actually found endearing.The strawberry and basil gazpacho for the amuse-bouche was refreshing and very summery, a nice jump-start for the palate. The peekytoe crab salad app was fantastic - light, subtle, and well-balanced - and the mango and asparagus in the dish were a perfect complement to the crab without being overwhelming. The fried chicken was a little on the dry side for my taste, but the sauce on the side provided a real kick of flavor that, along with the sweet corn, tempered an otherwise underwhelming reaction to the dish. To be fair though, my roommate and I both grew up in the south, so our expectations of fried chicken are a little higher than most. The warm chocolate cake was a delight, so sweet and rich and sinful that it pulled me straight out of a chocolate dessert rut I've been in lately.Given my high praise of the service and most of the food, I'm sure it seems odd that I've marked this only as three stars. I did find the food enjoyable and certainly wouldn't mind having the crab salad and chocolate cake again soon, but I did feel a little underwhelmed at the end of the meal. Everything was certainly good, just not mind-blowing. I wouldn't mind going back to Perry Street, but the food wasn't earth-moving like I had hoped.

Standing near the exit for a second, waiting for friends so I could hold the door open, there were four hostesses observing me and two of them simultaneously chuckled, condescendingly saying ""Ac-tu-al-ly, um, you're supposed to pusssshhhh the door."" They assumed I was an idiot and rather than trying to help or even understand the situation, their first impulse, rather than generosity and hospitality, was arrogance... And then there was the God awful wait for the bathroom, at least a dozen girls on their cellphones were going in and out, trading places, helping one another with makeup and hair, giving prescient life advice -- both times I tried... The waiters all seemed incredibly impatient, even when it wasn't near closing time and the restaurant was neither nearly empty nor over-crowded... There's nothing special about the amuse bouche, which was thrown down without any explanation whatsoever... There's nothing special about the bread and butter...  The dessert amuse bouche seemed almost like a perfunctory after-thought, relunctantly provided only because it was expected of them -- no effort was put into artistically or meticulously placing a smear of green tea between two pieces of chocolate... My table's appetizers were fine, the crab salad was extremely fresh and flavorful (although in my opinion there was no need to use such a wonderful crab as peekytoe with such intense flavors), I really liked my beet/ricotta/wasabi salad... My hanger steak was extremely tender and cooked a perfect rare (that's how I eat it), though I think a little bit over-salted -- same thing with the onion ring, it was perfectly cooked, very crispy and delicate and light, but just a little bit too salty -- the brussel sprouts were very good... I tried a couple bites from a few other dishes, what I enjoyed best was the sort-of salsa of beans/sake/ginger that came under the Cod... Desserts were very good, especially my trio of sorbets (not on the menu, but I requested something light -- wasn't in the mood for cake)... I think the layout is very relaxed, I love its proximity to the water, I love the open-air breezy flow of the space, I really like how much glass they use to connect it to the outside world -- it makes for an almost ideal brunch and for a potentially very romantic experience... I've been for lunch, it's a terrific bargain -- I really enjoyed the salmon dish (which came with incredibly delicious mitake mushrooms), but my  pan-roasted skate was a bit dry and a bit too sweet... I think they have some issues to work out with the employees, maybe if they're a little kinder then maybe the clientelle will be a little kinder and the whole environment can be more joyful and easy-going, but for now everybody seems a bit full of it... Also, make sure you know exactly how to get to and from your apartment and the restaurant, coming here my cab-driver tried to pull one over on me (in addition to blaming me for the war in Iraq and the economic collapse).",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"
653,zfcmdpsXTCDugivPROw9rQ,Cheryl K.,4.0 star rating,"[4.5 stars]I went to Perry Street for last summer's Restaurant Week after hearing great things from my roommate. I was not disappointed.My friend and I had to wait for the rest of our party before we could be seated so we ordered drinks. It's been a while so I don't remember what I drank but it was pink and bubbly. My friend also ordered a simple cocktail, probably a cosmo, and we were pleased with the price and the drinks themselves.As soon as our party arrived we were seated at a cozy circular booth. I believe I had the tuna tartar for an appetizer, the cod for my entree and something delightfully sweet and chocolate for dessert (I think it was a molten cake of some sort-amazing!). The cod was beyond excellent. It was accompanied by the most delicious side of mashed potatoes with this peculiar tangy green sauce. All in all a great dish! The interior is very sleek and modern. Nothing ornate or extravagant--very different from Vong. It is surrounded by glass windows which is perfect because you can see the water right outside. I took away .5 stars though because the location is a bit obscure (which can also be a plus) so it was difficult to find. However, it is a quiet and unique location--almost doesn't feel like you're in NYC anymore. I guess it has its pros and cons. I was just annoyed because I was wearing heels and there was construction and cobblestone on the way to find the restaurant.I'd still go again though! :)",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

Best calamari ever! That was the highlight of my meal, however.My buttermilk pancakes were good, but nothing to go koo koo over. My dessert was also just a normal molten lava cake with ice cream.  My table got everything everyone recommended (the tuna, sweet chili crab dumplings, etc) and it was good..... just not memorable enough for me.  The ambiance and service is pretty great however.

They don't skimp on decor, rent, or food here, that's why. Luckily I googled 'miroir au cassis' before dinner. We participated in the 'OpenTable Stimulus Plan'.

666,Z8ZS9cknAPqRNS_l9kjBTw,Jeremy L.,4.0 star rating,"So, for Chloe F.'s birthday her mom Mary S (of NYC Yelp Fame) wanted to take us to Perry St. by Jean Georges. I was totally excited and when I found out about their $24 'Taste of Winter' prix fixe menu, I figured the day couldn't get much better. I was wrong.To start, the decor is great, a little too minimalistic for my taste, but great none-the-less. White on white on white, trimmed in white. Right up front on against the windows were these big round booth that comfortably would seat 8, the perfect size of table in my opinion. Not too large so as one can't talk across the table; but large enough to include seven great friends.But on to the menu:The Cocktails: while I didn't take the opportunity to try one (it was lunch people!) They looked intriguing and delicious. In addition to the great looking cocktails there was house-made sodas, including organic grape soda made from different kinds of grapes.The Wine: In my opinion very reasonably priced. While somewhat small and limited, they did have lots of familiar wines and also had a wine special of $22/bottle, of which we partook, it was delicious (a cote du rhone)!The Food:Oh, how delicious!!! The menu consisted of 14 dishes of which you get to choose two. How ever you order it is how it arrives on the table, so if you order the steak first and your salad second, just be prepared. All of the dishes were slightly larger than an average appetizer and after two, plus choice of desert, I was full. There were definitely some highlights to the menu; the Peekytoe Crab Salad, the Grilled Hanger Steak (the most tender hanger steak I've ever had the pleasure to chew on), and the Beet Salad were all fantastic. I think that my favorite of all may have been the beet salad. Quartered beets with what I'm guessing was either house made or imported ricotta cheese, sprinkled with dried cherries, and candied pecans. At this point you may be thinking, what's special about this beet salad? Well let me tell you... sprinkled on top was crystallized/granulated wasabi, it gave the dish just enough heat to cut through the fattiness of the ricotta and just enough zip to balance the sweetness of the beets and cherries. Delicious!! Sadly one dish we sampled was a miss; the Artic Char Sashimi- it was flavorless and boring, only tasting of the lemon zest and olive oil. The best part of it was the crispy bits of fried Artic Char skin that garnished the plate.The Service:Its interesting that two of the worst service experiences I've ever had were in NYC, supposedly the pinnacle of dining...and both took place at restaurants by some of the biggest chefs in NYC. The first was a couple of years ago at BLT Fish, couldn't get a drink to save my life...and the second was Perry St. What gives chefs? It seemed as if they were a bit understaffed, the bartender took our order, only one server, and one busser. We regularly had to wave somebody down to get any attention... the staff wasn't even visually checking back with us from across the room, I don't think the manager even glanced toward our table once! He was actually rude to one of our guests who asked about the coat check - just pointing and saying ""back there"", not offering to take her coat or anything...Overall:Fantastic and I'd definitely go back and it would have been a 5-star experience except for the service.BC- Loved the bathrooms!

Located along the West Side Highway, it was a part of NYC that I was not familiar with. A cool neighborhood. Sunday morning was a perfect day which enhanced the experience. The restaurant is minimalist, calm, and spotless. Almost like a spa. I really like the atmosphere and quiet. Seemed elegant, to use an old-fashioned word. Food: Wonderful. I had the beet and goat cheese salad. This item, which is pretty commonplace, was brightened up considerably by the mango dressing and slices of mango. Delicious. Next came the delicious fried chicken - crispy, crunchy, moist, great. Nice sides too. I ended with the molten center chocolate cake. At first, I was surprised that such a 'cool' place would such a commonplace desert but their version was really good especially the ice cream and burnt sugar 'cookie'. Really good. My partner had the crab dumplings and gravalax and also the cake all of which he enjoyed a lot. Great bread too. Drinks: Nice. The mimosa featured wonderful fresh orange juice. And the coffee was perfect. Only drawback - $15 drinks more than doubled the price of brunch. And, I was surprised that coffee was not included with brunch price. Price: $25 is quite reasonable for 3 dishes for lunch. As stated, I was a bit surprised at the price of the drinks and coffee which more or less doubled the price of brunch. Location, etc: Very pretty and interesting. Kind of far from the subway and 'out of the way' (or so it seemed to me not being from New York). A very cool place in a very cool space with a great cool vibe. Overall: Fantastic. I hope to be able to return. Quite a nice brunch for a good price.

We had to call her over to take our drink orders and then our dessert order. The coffee arrived cold and when asked to replace it she said ""of course"" and never came back.

My bf came and met us at his apartment and we walked over to Perry St. which was quite relaxing, despite the humidity and rain sprinkles. As we walked into Perry St. we were our moods were immediately transformed into happy moods! The ambiance is wonderful, very clean and modern, almost tranquil even despite the bustling crowd. The modern building complete with white walls and fresh flowers make you feel like you're in a spa. We were seated for our reservation immediately and as soon as we were seated, the waitress brought our waters and we ordered our first round of cocktails for the night. YES PLEASE!The cocktails were delicious (so delicious we had like 3 rounds!! hehehe)! The names of the drinks escape me, but my bf and I had a vodka lemonade cocktail which was extremely refreshing, while my mom had a sparkling champagne cocktail and my dad had his signature glass of red wine!On to the food, which was truly delicious and met all of our expectations!Appetizers:-Crispy Calamari: I'm not the biggest calamari fan as I try to stay away from fried foods that aren't fried chicken or french fries and squid really but this dish was hands down one of the best calamari dishes we have ever tried. Calamari is a staple app order with my fam and everyone could not stop raving about the dipping sauce which was fantastic.-Chilled Peekytoe Crab Salad: the crab was so fresh, it was unreal! It was so refreshing on a hot summer night, we almost ordered seconds. The vinaigrette complemented the crab perfectly, and I still think about that appetizer to this day!Dinner:-Grilled Cod: My mom ordered the cod and it was delicious! The side of vegetables was cooked perfectly and the fish was flaky, almost buttery and melted in your mouth... yum!-Griled Beef Strip Loin: My dad's steak was perfectly cooked and the sauce was delicious! It wasn't the best entree that night, but it was definitely solid all around. -Poached Butter Lobster: I'm not the biggest fan of lobster, but my bf is and he loved his meal! The lemongrass broth was a nice touch, giving it this asian flare that was a really great flavor combination with the lobster itself.-Organic Fried Chicken: My meal was one of the best meals I've had in the city. I know what you're thinking... It's just fried chicken... But honestly it wasn't! The chicken was perfectly cooked and the batter was perfectly crunchy, but not too crispy and was perfectly seasoned! The scotch bonnet sauce was absolutely delicious and the side of creamed corn was divine. It was definitely upscale fried chicken at its finest and I would definitely go back to Perry St. just for this!Overall we had a wonderful dining experience here. For our first experience together at a Jean Georges restaurant in the city we gave this place 5 stars for ambiance, food, service and price: the total package! It was a great way to start the weekend in the city and if only we had the $$$, my bf and I will surely be back.

678,zETt15Ory31T0NqQZwAduQ,Leanne L.,4.0 star rating,"I tried Perry Street with a friend during Restaurant Week. The décor is kind of Jetsons-y with an interesting patterned carpet. What I appreciated immensely about the décor, other than the appropriately dim lighting, was the amount of space between each table. Perry Street could most likely double its capacity if it pushed tables together. But this lack of overcrowding creates a real intimacy in which diners can have very private conversations and, in turn, not be distracted by people seated next to them. For restaurant week there was a three course meal with two choices for each course. The food was thoughtful but not too fancy or complicated. To start, they serve a tiny demie-tasse of sweet potato soup which was heavenly. I could drink it by the gallon! From the menu, I had the shrimp with smoked paprika (yum!) as an appetizer, the salmon with a white truffle sauce as the main course and carrot cake for dessert (kind of boring in comparison with the first two courses). A glass of the Pinot Blanc tied everything together nicely. The wait staff was very attentive and discreet and I never felt rushed to finish or move on to the next course.Overall it was a great initiation to restaurant week for me.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

The decor is very minimal and simple, clean. The server seemed very timid and unsure of himself, but still did what he needed to do. The prix fixe menu was decent - I order the pancakes and gravlax, both of which were delicious. The portions were good, and the molten chocolate cake was very decadent. One thing that threw me off, but I suppose shouldn't have surprised me, was that there was a large group of tweeny girls that was sat in the booth on the corner. It just didn't seem like the kind of place for the younger palate, so I'm just assuming they're all privileges brats that insist on having poached eggs with caviar and creme fresh for their brunches.

Just looking at it on Google Maps made me decide to cab here. Came here for restaurant week w/ my gf Anna and 4 friends from Jeff C.'s meetup group. We bumped into Gene and walked over to the restaurant (didn't know the cab drop us a block and 1/2 away). With 20+ mph wind and temperatures 10 below freezing, I felt the chill going through my bones each time the wind blew in from the Hudson. Good thing it was ephemeral.Once we finally got inside (trying to open their 2nd set of doors was tricky, it felt like it was immovable, like you're pulling on a ton of bricks), we waited for everyone to show up in the waiting area. The restaurant is lit dimly, but I didn't feel it was use to enhance ambiance, more like to hide the imperfections (probably because its too dim). I did notice one cool thing though. They had a really large cherry blossom plant in a square shape pot. Gene went over to double checked it was real, and it was.They sat us on the corner table of their restaurant. It was a circular table with a circular bench around it. It looks nice, but I thought it felt a little odd, and I didn't figure it out until we were leaving the restaurant.  Our table had a overhanging lamp that almost look like a spotlight when compare in terms of brightness to every other table. On to the food, our RW menu included:Pumpkin Squash soup Amuse bouche - Good, very similar to what I had at David Burke TownhouseRoasted Beet Salad ricotta and crystallized wasabi - The beet and the ricotta goes so well, and the wasabi just give it the perfect kick. The walnuts hidden under the ricotta gives it a nice texture. The only thing is I felt like I was cutting a cake cuz beet were serve in 2 huge chunks. If the beet was slice in very thin layers to keep the shape, but save on the cutting, this would be perfectSautéed Shrimp baby artichokes, lemon fennel vinaigrette and paprika - tried dish from my gf's dish. Its good, but small portion almost make you confuse it w/ an amuse bouche.Glazed Short Ribs lightly pickled asian pears and parsnips - Good flavor, but a bit on the tough side. I wasn't expecting a workout on a Friday.Salmon - My gf gave me a big piece. I think we should have switch our entree. I like this because it was just slightly flaky, but still quite tenderMolten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream - Delicious, but the walls of chocolate cake was a bit thick, and the molten chocolate didn't ooze out but more like dripped out. It was still pretty good w/ the vanilla ice creamI guess my expectations were over the top after nougatine, and I thought their menu was a bit skimpy when I first laid eyes on it.

For some well-off people this place might be normal for a weeknight dinner out, because its casual enough or this might be their local bar hangout. But for not ""NYC-normal"" (ie rich) people like me, this place is reserved for special occasions so I brought a good friend for her birthday. She loved it, I loved it, the cocktails are outstanding, the service is outstanding, the FOOD is outstanding...I was so torn between so many things I wanted to order but went with the house made burrata which came with a fresh strawberry jam and basil oil. I only wish I came with more than one sliver of bread so I could share it with my friend. Entree was the butter poached lobster with lemongrass and kaffir lime lime broth and potato ravioli. I probably would have ordered any entree with lemongrass and kaffir lime broth regardless of what it was served on, it could have been cat meat for all I cared...but the fact that it was a generous mound of tender, perfectly cooked lobster was a bonus. It was plated beautifully and the citrusy flavors complemented the lobster. The potato ravioli was like a delicate pierogi. I was full but refused to leave one morsel in the bowl. For dessert I had the cherries jubilee with champagne sabayon and pistachio ice cream-WAY too much for one person but perfect to share.

The decor, as others said, is sleek and modern. When night time comes, candles are lighted in every corner, making the whole space feel foggy.As options on the restaurant week menu were very limited, I ordered from the regular menu instead. Asparagus with Chinese mustard for starter, and steamed red snapper on mashed potato bed as my main course. The lightly braised asparagus was succulent and refreshing, but the sauce was a snake's leg (redundant)-- a bit too salty and pungent, spoiling the purity of the main ingredient. I loved the steamed fish, which was meaty, smooth and milky. The potato bed enhanced the impression by bringing out the flavor of sweetness and sealing the moistness of the fish (of course, the low-carb animal left most of the potatoes untouched). The sauce for the fish was light buttery broth. That's all it needs.The service was a big drawback. The staff was indifferent and quickly disappeared after delivering our dishes.

On the plus side, the waiters were nice and the space was good. But on the downside, it's not an easy spot to get to and we were led to believe that this place sits on the water. It's CLOSE to the water, but there's a double 5 lane highway blocking our view of the Hudson. Why they put this 'raunt' on the first floor versus the rooftop to get a better view?

694,Jbo9MuS4pJ_XffsYbONQZw,Lianne Z.,3.0 star rating,"Went there last night with a few girlfriends for restaurant week.Tucked away on the West Side, if you aren't actively looking for it, most people would pass it up for an extension of a hotel. The restaurant is modern and sleek with low candles and lots of simple materials. The restaurant is mostly done in white with glass walls. It provides a nice view of the Hudson, intermixed with an always busy West Side Highway. The service was great although one of the runners did ask us twice if we'd finished our cucumber soup palate cleanser when my friend didn't even have a chance to try it yet. It's a fine line between having a not-at-all attentive waiter to one who is too eager to clear. Nothing great about feeling rushed.That contributed greatly to my three-star evaluation.We started with the sauteed shrimp with fried baby artichokes and paprika oil. The shrimp was a bit too salty but the mixture of lemon fennel emulsion and paprika oil with crunchy artichoke shavings was great. Our main course was the grilled Hangar steak. I've had a lot of hangar steak and I think a lot of times it is too chewy or has too much tendon. I got mine medium this time just to avoid over rareness (makes me too aware that I'm eating a cow). It came with sauteed herbal spinach which was creamy, tender and extremely flavorful. This dish is usually done with a beef tenderloin but I thought they cooked the Hangar steak extremely well. It was lightly charred and a perfect meaty flakiness. The meat was very flavorful and it was topped off with a liquid gruyere (not as nutty as what you'd associate with solid gruyere but still provided that hint of sharp flavor). Dessert was a strawberry/lemon flan-like cake accompanied with a lemon sorbet and fresh berries. I'm not a huge fan of dessert  but it was very refreshing compared to my friend's warm chocolate cake.Jean George's cooking style is very flavorful and I think instead of highlighting one item, he aims to maximize every element of each dish. This was a problem for my friend who preferred natural flavoring but my other friend and I enjoyed it quite a bit.Overall it was an enjoyable experience topped off with a delicious rasberry/lychee bellini and a bottle of red (was not the best but paired okay with the steak).

This time was far worse. Last time I recall our waiter being friendly but a little weird - unhappy in life or something. Our waiter was a complete ass. I asked him about the freshness of the artic char sashimi since it was sunday lunch but i love artic char. He assured me it was new daily and when he came back to take our orders I pointed on the menu and said I wanted the artic char sashimi and the steak. When our dishes came I had a mound of beets drowning in creme fraiche (I like beets but this really did not look appetizing) I politely told him that I had ordered the sashimi and instead of apologizing he glared at me and said. Oh, you wanted the sashimi? You pointed to beets. Surprised at his response, I just replied well I said sashimi...so he took the dish away without comment and replaced the dish shortly after. He looked pissed the rest of the meal, as if it was my fault he wrote down the wrong dish. It wasn't even like I had asked him about the beets or something. (Later on at another table he mixed up this girl's dessert order so clearly this guy is too hung over to work the sunday lunch crowd)The hangar steak was good but I got the last serving so a lot of it was the ends. Had I known I probably would have ordered something else. I liked the yellowfin tuna burger was also but overall the appetizers were far more interesting and noteworthy than the mains -the peekytoe crab salad was good although it did not taste quite as fresh as I expected. The artic char sashimi ended up being my favorite - too bad it was so difficult to get.I'm confused by the service here since I think JG and Nougatine have excellent service.

Tried the Grilled Hanger steak, which was very good.  The flavor reminded me of an Italian sausage.  Tender, juicy, cooked to perfection.  I think I would've preferred this over the cod.Dessert- Eyes and senses said Miroir Au Cassis, Pear Sorbet but I was in the mood for the Molten Chocolate Cake.  Love it, love it, love it.   I tried the Pear sorbet which was out of this work fabulous but on this night, chocolate was a craving not to be denied.Overall I'd say this place is classy, service is attentive and above average and food is a culinary delight.  I am definitely a fan.  I would highly recommend this place.  It is a nice place to meet and talk, it can also be romantic if the situation calls for it and definitely a good place to dine.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"
713,iYLOCmJTqEKVix7EYbCuNA,Carol H.,4.0 star rating,"This was the only place in the Meatpacking District I was able to get a reservation for 8 people on a Saturday night at 7 pm.  The restaurant is way out in the middle of bumf--k nowhere, a considerable hike from all subway stations and circuitous to get to even with a cab.  As a result, most of my party didn't arrive until nearly 8.   I'd like to preface my next statement by saying that at no time was the restaurant ever completely full, and after I had checked in and we were waiting for the rest of the party, no hostess ever approached me to ask if we wanted to get seated early because there were more reservations coming in.  No, instead, I got serious attitude when I went up to talk to her of my own accord at 7:40 to ask if we could just get started.  I realize it was 40 minutes past our reservation, and I know that it's a Saturday night.  But there sure as hell wasn't any party waiting behind us for the table (despite what the hostess implied), and the dinner rush was practically nonexistent.  I guess I just felt it unprofessional of her to chide me for something that was primarily out of my control. On to the better things: Food.  The amuse bouche was a watermelon gazpacho that was a little too acidic/oily for my taste.  We had 2 of the calamari appetizers, which were completely worth it, and the chili crab dumplings, which were eh.  They were good, they just didn't match up to the deliciousness of the calamari.  I might also have higher standards because I'm asian.  I also had a basil cocktail and someone else a girly martini, which were both served professionally.Most people got the fried chicken from the reviews here, and a few others got fish.  Everyone raved about their food, and I personally thought the fried chicken was great--not too heavy or greasy, perfect with the pickled onions and pea puree.  I had a bit of someone's fish (I can't remember which), that was also very well cooked.None of the desserts particularly appealed to us, but the dark chocolate green tea petit fours were more than good enough.  If they'd offered that as a full dessert, I definitely would have gotten it.  Service/Ambiance: Our waiter was eminently professional, and I think it was absolutely brilliant that there was space behind the round banquettes so the waiters could get behind you.  The whole restaurant was really bright and white at first, then as the sun went down, it turned into a dimly lit more club atmosphere with ambient colored lighting.  It also got way over air-conditioned (this was during the July heat wave) so a jacket might actually be helpful.  It's not a super ""young"" feeling place so I'm not sure I'd go back again soon, partially because it really is such a hike from all the subways.  It's a nice place for a more calm meal than you usually get in NYC though.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

The restaurant sits right on the West Side Highway, which makes it seem peaceful and removed from the village noise. In the evening, the floor to ceiling windows capture a beautiful sunset glow, which casts a perfect tint on the light/khaki decor inside. The design is minimalistic yet made cozy by sunflower bouquets. The food is a unique and adventurous take on casual foods - fried chicken, cream of tomato, calamari...

Off the pre fixe I had the artic char sashimi with crispy bits of skin and orange oil (probably the best of the night), then the entree was a slow cooked cod with black beans (good but nothing new), and the desert of pear sorbet and mirror cake.

They're not overly crowded at 12:30 and reservations are easy to come by. And you can't beat the eats.Jai and I took a colleague from an analyst firm to Perry Street for an informal lunch today. The wait staff is amazing. There were perhaps a total of three other tables there when we were there, and they team wait on tables -- I think we had three waiters at any one point in our meal.The lunch menu is fixed price. $24 gets you two plates and a dessert. The plates range from appetizers to entrees. And they make their own soda. I tried the lemon thyme soda; it was awesome.Jai and Chris both got the beef with an appetizer. I got the chicken soup and the bass. Everyone got a gratis sample of their sun choke soup with truffle -- just a sip, but awesome. My chicken soup was wonderful. They present the dry ingredients in a bowl topped with dill and then pour the broth over it. Wonderful.They did the same for my bass. It came served with frites and a smear of mashed potatoes -- ostensibly just to prop up the fish -- and then they poured the truffle broth over the fish. Lesson learned: If you pour something over food, it makes it better experience wise. The fish was also awesome.Dessert is included in the meal, so we each had dessert even though we were ready to head back to the office. We each had the chocolate pudding, which comes on top of a sliver of chocolate cake, topped with vanilla and what appeared to be grape sugar.All that beautiful food for $24 a person. $5 for the soda.

For example, when something I deem delicious is put in front of me I will eat that something until it is gone. Doesn't matter if it's one M&M or a family style order of penne ala vodka. If it's there and it's amazing, I will eat until there is no more left. Unfortunately, this was the case with everything I ordered at Perry Street. And boy oh boy did I order. Don't believe me? Let's run down the list, shall we? Drinks: champagne cocktail with violet liqueur x 5 (give me a break it was a celebration)Appetizer: cream of tomato soup with loads of shredded cheddar (what's up richest soup ever?) and a bite of red snapper sashimiDinner: lobster poached in butter with bearnaise sauce (so succulent, which by the way is one of the grossest words in the English language ) Dessert: white chocolate and meringue thing with yuzu sorbetFrom these four divine courses not a bite of my food was left... and believe me, it was very generously portioned.

After perusing Open Table with rejection after rejection Catherine's perseverance got us in here for my special night.We walked over from west 4th and grabbed a drink at Otheroom for a pre-dinner cocktail. When we arrived at the restaurant (on the ground floor of that Richard Meier building on the highway) we entered a sleek but comfortable environment. The service was really on point with all the professionalism you would expect without any pretense.Menus were set in Helvetica and had offerings that were not on the web version but still included the Chili crusted Lamb I was looking to get. Catherine ordered the Cream of Tomato soup (with fresh basil and a grated parmesan mound on top of a thin piece of bread). I ordered the calamari with a sesame dip. This was pretty awesome. Once the parmesan/bread was gone with the soup it was just a more acidic version of a cream of tomato soup. The amouse bouche was a cucumber/honeydew/lime foam. Tasty.Entrees ordered were the steamed red snapper and the chili crusted lamb. The snapper had a mint? puree that worked well.The lamb portion was small for $36 but it was cooked to perfection (medium rare on the rarer side) and butchered on the rib in a ""French Cut style."" I had no reservations gnawing off the remaining meat on the bone. It was accompanied by a pea puree and a small side of perfectly cooked peas with nuts and a slight mint sauce on the underside.Dessert was ridiculous and possibly showed up dinner for me. Which doesn't ever happen. I ordered the chocolate pudding with creme and crystallized violet petals. Yeah. flower petals that were a crunchy candy. Ridiculous. There was a thin layer of chocolate cake on the bottom as well. Catherine ordered the rhubarb tart/rhubarb ice cream combo. Definitely more tart than the pudding but also tasty.We had nothing else going on afterwards but cabs were cruising down Washington St. if you needed to get some place.

At around 9:15 we were all assembled and we informed the hostess. She said that unfortunately, our table wasn't ready. We were fine having cocktails. At 9:45, our table still wasn't ready, they apologized and said they wanted to bring us some appetizers on the house and ""did we have any allergies?"" Why, yes, thanks for asking--someone is allergic to seafood and we have a vegetarian. At around 10pm, they decide to seat us at a table (not the one we reserved), in the bar area where three of the five guests are seated on benches and not real chairs. We were not impressed, but had already waited an hour for our reservation and so felt we had no choice. Our first appetizer arrives -- the tuna. We noted to the hostess again that while we appreciated the thought--one of our guests is allergic to seafood and one is a vegetarian. She said, ""I think something else is coming out."" Shortly after we finish the tuna (which was great--very delicious), some calamari arrives. Also delicious, but also seafood again and not vegetarian. Then the amuse bouche arrives-- there are only 4 instead of 5. We ask the runner why and he says someone in your party can't have it. Well that's great, but who/why? Doesn't know. He says he will find out, and to his credit he does come back--- after about 20 minutes when they had been eaten and cleared. After speaking with the hostess, we're told that it contains bonito flakes (fish flakes--two people in our party can't eat this). They say they will send over a vegetarian version. And they do but only provide one portion, so back to the kitchen again. Meanwhile, we attempted to place our orders. Our waitress offered to find out what our vegetarian could order and whether a specific dish could be made vegetarian. (Note that the vegetarian had called in advance and was told that they could absolutely accommodate her by replacing any of the fishes with tofu). She disappears for 15 minutes or so. The hostesses offer to take our order after a while. They say any of the fish can be made vegetarian and so we place our orders. Then the waitress comes back to say the fish entry our vegetarian had inquired about cannot be made vegetarian as their is chicken stock in the sauce. I had the butter poached lobster, which was amazing as other reviewers have noted. Two people in our party had the fried chicken, which they also really enjoyed. The vegetarian on the other hand was served a quivering block of tofu on top of the garnishes that came with the original fish entree. The tofu didn't really seem prepared in any way. No sauce on top, nothing. Pretty disappointing and not that tasty. Though we declined to order dessert, they brought out two on the house. The chocolate pudding and the sorbet trio. Both were great (though the pudding was a clear favorite). I would say the staff tried really hard and were very nice (why I gave three instead of two stars), but their service was VERY off. This is especially true comparing it to Jean-George or Nougatine, both of which I have only received flawless service at. The food was delicious but I probably won't be looking to return any time soon (or frankly, ever).",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

And the chicken, while moist with a decent sauce, was nothing to text home about. Some highlights: After offering several delicious loaves of bread, they insisted that I cannot eat bread during dessert - they tried to remove the bread from the table on three occasions finally succeeding when I was not looking.West Village?

I went in with my friend for restaurant week and ended up getting the $68 prefixed menu. I had heard it was amazing... Here's the rundown: Canteloupe drink concoction: a little spicy, a little cool, great starter. Rice Cracker Crusted Tuna: appetizer portion is all they have. AMAZING. Yes, it was almost like sushi (friends comment) but the rice cracker around it made it so much better. There was a siracha-based  sauce with it that added to the experience. Market Beet Salad With Coach Farm Goat Cheese: Not a fan of beets, but I really enjoyed this. It came with a mango vinaigrette and goat cheese that was so creamy and frisee salad. I would order this again. Slowly Cooked Scottish Salmon: green chili sauce with it and bok choy cooked perfectly. This was probably my favorite. I dont usually go for salmon bc its overcooked or just not properly seasoned. But this looked and tasted like fine dining. It was cooked to perfection. Crunchy Rabbit With Green chilies Millet, Fava beans and oven dried black olives: I was the most excited for this, but I couldnt finish it. It was NASTY. The rabbit was just.. chewy. The fava bean and olive concoction had a wasabi aftertaste, but the consistency and texture of the whole thing was actually unappetizing. Normally I will eat anything and finish it, I am not a picky person. But this I just could not finish. Don't order this. Dessert - Chocolate pudding, fresh cream, and crystal violets: straight up Jello Chocolate Mouse with purple fruity pebbles. That says it all. Total 4/6 good entrees. Overall I am glad I went, I would recommend this to my friends. I would however not order the Summer Tasting Menu. I'd go for individual items so you can mix and match.

The wait staff were always very polite and attentive, not pretentious at all. My friend and I ordered from the restaurant week menu, which comprised of two choices per course, and we ordered the complete opposite of each other so I got to see all their dishes.They start you off with an amuse-bouche, then appetizer, main entre, dessert. We also got a bottle of wine and they were very good about serving that too. I would say the food itself was prepared well. When I saw some of the ingredients used for certain dishes, I was a bit hesitant (i.e. celery, white chocolate, pink watermelon).  However, they did a great job complimenting flavors and not making particular ingredient too overpowering. The atmosphere is real nice as well - not very crowded and dim lighting - located right by the West side highway.I really enjoyed myself.

Onto the degustation.  Drinks wise, you'll find something for everyone with plenty of cocktails and wines by the glass.   The Chardonnay is my favorite, but pricey.  Yet the Sauvignon Blanc is hardly a compromise.  When it comes to food, the appetizers are the best part of the dining experience.  The tomato soup is rich, fulfilling, perfect for any winter's day (soup is seasonal so get there before spring!) with the slice of parm cheese toast.  The peekytoe crab and rice crusted tuna are flavorful and light (you ask them to toss you a mixed green salad on the side).  To be honest, just the appetizers alone have kept me satiated and returning for more, although I vow to make it to the entrees next time.  Overall, if you are looking for a lack of pretension but high quality food/service in a serene atmosphere, this may be the perfect West Village oasis.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

At first sight, the décor is amazing - the furniture and walls were all white with touches of brown. The light fixtures were interesting. No formal white table cloth at my table - it was two recyclable brown place mats. There was enough space between tables to have an intimate conversation.We ordered the prix fix meal at $35/person which included an appetizer, an entrée and a dessert.This is what we had:-chilled strawberry yogurt soup (flavor was strange - strawberry was sour)-Ahi tuna with a citrus sauce and crunch fried onion sprinkled on top-Peach salad with goat cheese and wasabi vinaigrette-Red snapper over mashed potatoes with a few baby bok choy on the side-Flank steak medium rare over a bed of mint flavored spinach-Chocolate lava cake with pistachio sorbet with a caramelized sugar cracker-Vanilla crème brulee with a lemongrass sorbetAll the food was very flavorful but portion size is small. I am so glad we ordered from the prix fix menu. This food would not be worth paying full price. The red snapper was very fresh and went well with the mash potato. My fiancée had the flank steak which was tender and juicy. I enjoyed my decadent chocolate lava cake with the warm center. The pistachio sorbet helped balance the sweetness of the chocolate cake. The crème brulee was very soft and savory. I enjoyed the lemongrass sorbet - it was very refreshing. Our waiter provided decent service. It was downtime for them so a bunch of the waiters were standing together and chatting, which was un-professional. The only complaint was that we had to request a re-fill of our water which is usually automatic. Our waiter did come and check up on us every so often to see that our dinner was going well.

Plan a simple, we wanted everything on the menu. The menu is comfort-food inspired with marvelous Asian twists. The amuse bouche was a nice creamy soup with truffles, but I have to agree it was a tad hot! Snapper Sashimi was prepared with lemon, olive oil and crispy skin, making the taste last a long time in my mouth. The Peeky crab ravoli was a melt in the mouth. We got a nice bottle of sauvignon blanc to follow these courses. The Black Truffle Crusted Cod was so good.  It was served with a mash of delicate-tasting celeriac with lemon and butter, shaved truffles on top.  And I trying to think of the last meat dish, I know it was good...but I can't remember what the garnish was. Just say we had a good, dessert was a trio of sorbets/ice-cream. I thought dessert could be something more, I wanted to try a dessert not a garnish.  Overall, great service, great helpful staff. The bathrooms were clean, and the music was upbeat. I wanted to take my drink in the bathroom, it was a club! LOL Highly recommended.

If I had to complain about one thing, which hey, I'm a chick : ), I would say that I'm not a huge fan of the decor as I feel like I'm in a Hotel restaurant. That being said, they definitely have every thing down pat. I got there early for my reservation so I sat at the bar to wait for my date. The two bartenders were great about making suggestions. I decided to go with a drink that was something like a Manhattan but had fizz in the name. It was Makers Mark, passion fruit and chili. I had the bartender go easy on the sweet and serve it up and it was heaven. Makers with a kick, LOVED it! When my date got there he ordered a regular Manhattan and he's very particular about the type of Rye etc. but the bartender got it just right. We even had a little whiskey/rye tasting/discussion. We then sat down at our table and since I had said it was for a special Birthday they gave us a great corner booth. The amuse bouche that was served was two asparagus spears that were coated with some sort of crunchy mushroom flakes, YUM! The presentation here of every plate is gorgeous as well. We ordered a bottle of the Cote du Rhone and it was lovely at a reasonable $42 a bottle. The bread served at the start was perfectly crunchy on the crust and the sea salt and butter served along side were high quality. To start we split the Rice Cracker Crusted Tuna which was probably my least favorite dish but still fantastic. It sounds amazing with the sriracha-citrus emulsion but it really wasn't all that flavorful. For entrees we ordered Crispy Fried Chicken and the Butter poached Lobster. The chicken was perfectly cooked, not at all greasy and it was served with collard greens rolled up it what was like a very thin crepe. That might have been my favorite part! The Lobster was of course perfectly cooked and the lemongrass and kaffir lime broth gave it a Thai flavor that was to die for. I'm not even sure what our dessert was. It had a bit of citrus taste to it and had like a meringue cookie on top with creme underneath. I'm not sure it was on the menu and it came candle and all for the Birthday boy. This restaurant is definitely one of the better high end restaurants that doesn't charge you high end prices. Granted, it's not cheap but for the quality of the ingredients, the presentation, the excellent service and the comfortable decor you will not find a better value in NYC.

776,uyXIb01myGF5SVNNN3U9sw,Akilesh A.,5.0 star rating,"This simple minimalist Jean-Georges restaurant is on its eponymous street, right around the corner from a building full of condos. As I came in, I saw the sparse area, filled with elegant lamps and quietly chattering people, the muted light of a Saturday morning further dimmed by the kind of window shades that look like television static.When I sat down and got my menu, I was at first skeptical -- it seemed to have few traditional brunch entrees, and the menu was fairly sparse for vegetarians compared to a lot of brunch restaurants.But my concern was misplaced. The pricing system at Perry St. works by offering two plates plus dessert for $24, with each additional plate for $12. I was offered a choice of wine or cocktail, too, but instead I opted for the -- gasp -- $8 glass of grape juice.Grape juice? This is no ordinary grape juice. For someone whose last glass of grape juice was Welch, this was a complete revelation. My first glass was a Navarro 2005 Gewurtzheimer grape juice. It's a white grape juice, and it is like ambrosia. It has an amazing fruity, honeyed taste that's mild and clear and light. Later on in the meal I tried the Pinot Noir red grape juice from the same vineyard, and it was even fruitier, with a greater boldness and darkness and depth, though both are phenomenal (in fact, the white is my favorite).For entrees, I had a tomato soup and a ginger rice bowl. The tomato soup was carefully poured tableside into a porcelain bowl in which a bottom layer of cumin oil was patiently pooled. The resulting soup was homey and slightly tart, with an exotic cumin turn every few sipfuls. The soup was served with a simple strip of grilled sourdough with white cheddar sprinkled on top. The sourdough was crisp initially but turned chewy in the mouth, and worked well to present a contrasting texture to the soup.The other entree was truly memorable: the ginger rice bowl. This small, exquisitely prepared bowl of Japanese Nashiki rice, gently spiced with ginger (definitely no sting here), each grain delicately separate from the rest and begging to be savored individually, was served with a complement of graceful scallions, a mayonnaise-like emulsion of sriracha with a hit of spicy heat, and an astonishing poached egg, served in a deep fried batter, with a luscious yellow yolk spilling out onto the rice when pierced. The whole thing was amazing in look and taste. Indeed, that was true for the entire meal.Finally, the dessert kept up the trend of quality. I chose a chocolate pudding, which came served as a multi-layer dessert. Unsweetened cream, whipped to just the right soft, smooth texture, covered the chocolate pudding (a chocolate pot-de-creme in reality, I think), which was a semisweet mixture. The pudding in turn hid a simple chocolate cake at bottom. In one corner of the dessert bowl were piled a small heap of candied violets, which looked like nothing more to me than tiny fruity pebbles which smeared a blue trail behind them as I devoured them.Perry St. is calm and zenlike in its devotion to great tasting food that is pleasing to the eye. Service was similarly professional. Highly recommended.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

We split the ""trio of sorbets"" for desert. it was amazing as well. banana, mango and rasberry. all incredibly fresh with a bit of graham cracker crumbs on the bottom of the bowl. the banana was my favorite. perfecto. Lastly, after a delicious, calm, and refreshing meal. the check came out with 2 small squares of chocolate cake. it was layered with about 5 different ingredients, and although it was only 2 bites, i wanted it to last forever. we asked when we left what it was and how it was so good. they responded ""we get that a  lot"". aparently it was some green tea/chocolate layered cake- to die for!! would definitely go back, not my favorite, but worth the experience for a romantic one on one date.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

This year, not so much, but still ok (unless you are vegetarian). The atmosphere was relatively subdued for a Friday night, with plenty of empty tables at 8:30pm (full when we left). The crowd was young, definitely a lot of others taking part in restaurant week. I had the mozzarella and heirloom tomato salad, which was very good. I was disappointed in the selections for dinner, fried chicken or cod, and felt that they could have gotten more creative or generous. Worse, though, was the vegetarian option. They offered my date a  choice between ""mixed vegetables"" (as dinner!?!) or the opportunity to swap out the meat in either dish with tofu. He chose the latter and was presented with the same meal as mine, except a slab of (unseasoned, unprepared) tofu sat where my cod was. Again, in a city like NY, and a Jean Georges restaurant, you expect a little more craft, and some respect for dining restrictions.Anyway, dessert was fine, choice of  a generic lava cake or a more appealing berry soup that is actually full of fresh berries. Our cocktails left something to be desired (ginger margarita and the cherry kir royale) so we switched to wine after the first round. I have to say, I had a much better impression after my first visit, and wish I had left it at that.

The best calamari I've ever had and I've had lots! For the main course I had the Pan Seared Black Sea Bass with Grilled Maitake Mushroom...WOW. I love seafood and this sent me over the moon. If you're a seafood fan, you MUST try this..you won't be disappointed. The mushroom was so delicate and flavorful I wanted to order it again ( I didn't). And to finish we shared a dessert but i can't remember what is was..some type of ice cream..it was very good. The cocktails were good also, I had a bellini. Overall, one of the best meals I've had in NYC. Yum!P.S. The waitress pissed me off a little, she tried sitting us next to the door. Really lady? It's freezing out.

We had high expectations given that it is a Jean Georges restaurant. The food was definitely high in terms of quality but we did not enjoy the flavors so much and found that the majority of the menu skewed toward fish (possibly because it's summer and the chef wanted to offer lighter dishes). The things we enjoyed: the rice cracker encrusted tuna appetizer with sriracha and braised sweet and sour short ribs entree. I thoroughly did not enjoy my entree of poached cod in vegetable broth with avocado and lime. I found the broth too citrusy and did not match well with the cod. The japanese snapper sashimi with yuzu appetizer was ok but did not have a lot of flavor. For dessert we had the gateau des crepes which are 17 layers of crepes (served like a slice of cake) with an orange sauce. The crepes had a custard between the layers and was very light; another good dish for the hot weather. Overall, I thought the food was ok but not anything special. Definitely less than what you would have expected from Jean Georges.The restaurant did everything ""right"" in terms of service but we did not feel that the staff was very warm or inviting. They were attentive as they are supposed to be, getting our chairs when we got up, folding our napkins when we were away from the table and whisking our plates away as soon as we were finished.  Maybe the service is better described as ""unobtrusive"". The decor was nice and can be described as minimally chic.

Everyone at our table enjoyed their food.The waitstaff was very attentive, but not pushy- always refilling my water & coffee. The decor is pretty sleek and modern and faces the river.

This was supposed to be a birthday celebration and we had made our discontent known with the manager - to which she said she didn't know it was a birthday celebration - it wasn't "" in their system"" (even though when they called to confirm the reservations the restaurant confirmed it was a birthday dinner).....well when the coat check person couldn't find my coat and i had to rummage through their coat closet myself the manager asked for my phone # and she pulled up my reservation on the computer...Oh - wouldn't you know on the reservation screen it clearly stated BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION.

It's soothing, elegant and very comfortable. The portion size is on the small side so ordering a full 3-course meal is recommended. From what I've tried, I'd recommend the lettuce and poached egg for appetiser, fried chicken, beef fillet and roast salmon for entrees and the poached pear with almond cream for dessert. It's a lovely restaurant that is great for a leisurely meal with close ones.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"
846,wULzmpXAE8azOrJ00xwAbw,Jason R.,5.0 star rating,"Perry Street is one of Jean-Georges Vongerichten's newer restaurants, nicely situated close to the Hudson River.  The atmosphere feels like a tastefully decorated, modern living room, with somewhat neutral colors and large windows inviting in the sunlight.  Upon arriving, you are greeted by professional hostesses and waiters who are polite and responsive without being stuffy or obtrusive.  This is a wonderful place to dine, absent of cheesy gimmicks/themes, while allowing you to enjoy high-quality dining and feel special.Have a look at their menu, and you'll see that the sauces and flavors are carefully thought-out.  Most restaurants lack focus, cranking out indistinct dishes that often underwhelm.  Not so with Perry Street, which delivers a culinary experience that is very deliberate in its choice of a select few flavors and textures for each well-cooked and presented dish.  Many serious foodies appreciate this distinction.  This is a model that other restaurants should study carefully, because the results are truly outstanding.  I recommend reservations in advance and generally prefer non-rush hours for restaurants like this one--even a weeknight and especially just before sunset.Expect $50-70 (before tip) per person for an appetizer, main dish, dessert--you will likely share one of these with your date--and a glass of wine.  I took my wife here for her birthday, and both of us really enjoyed the whole experience.  I very strongly recommend this excellent restaurant (belongs in a list of NYC's top ten), especially for a romantic occasion.Location: on the 9A/West Side Highway (facing the Hudson River), a few blocks north of and parallel to Christopher Street.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

848,ov0YGwUqKmhU4spmNZ0XCg,L M L.,2.0 star rating,"Although I have always been a fan of the Jean Georges restaurants, having visited Perry St. a couple of times previously, I was less than fond of my experience there this past week.  While departing from the restaurant, I inadvertently left my iphone and blackberry on the chair and returned about 5 minutes later to retrieve them after realizing their absence.  Upon my return, the devices were nowhere to be found and the maitre-d took about maybe 30 seconds to go to the back and check.  Having decided to not give up just yet, I called the restaurant a couple more times throughout the night to try my luck.  I finally got a call back and was told that absolutely everything was done to search for my phones (i.e. lockers were searched, staff was spoken to twice, cameras were checked) and that there was nothing else left to be done.  Convinced that 5 minutes was too short of a time period for the devices to absolutely disappear out of thin air, my friends and I went back to the restaurant the following day and asked to see the surveillance videos.  The general manager went away for about half an hour and came back telling us the the video was ""grainy.""   We insisted to see it anyway and as reluctant as she was, she finally let us go downstairs.  It turned out that all of the video cameras in the entire restaurant were functioning perfectly except for the one over our table; in fact, this one screen had ""VIDEO LOSS"" written across it.  Having no other means of deciphering what had happened, we left with the understanding that I was going to file an official police report at the precinct, call the corporate offices of Jean Georges and  make it known to other guests.  Shortly after, one of my friends gets a call from my office security informing her that someone had dropped off my two phones and said that he found them outside of the office building.  It still baffles me how the devices made their way from the West Village all the way to Midtown.   While I am and continue to be impressed by the quality of the food at Perry St, I am highly disappointed by management's poor handling of the situation.  The suspicious lack of transparency is something I would have expected elsewhere, not at a Jean Georges' restaurant.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

We were seated promptly and our waiter immediately started us off with a bottle and some   appetizers. I had the shrimp which was pretty good, but to be honest everything on the menu looked decent. The waiter then recommended the salmon, so I took my chances. When it came out it looked delicious, but upon further inspection I found it to be undercooked and and little too raw for my taste. In any case, it wasn't too bad, just not nearly as good as I expected. Finally, we finished the meal off with some sorbet which was quite delicious. Overall, I would recommend Perry St. based on their great service and the surprisingly  non-pretentious atmosphere. Also, i hear that they have a great lunch deal that I would definitely look into in the future.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

855,4HLalVwRtId8VNscQmCtCw,Akshay R.,1.0 star rating,"What a dissapointment! This restaurant is well past its prime. We should have guessed by the number of empty tables.. apparently people already know to stay away, though not those writing reviews on yelp! This was the worst meal we have had in a long time and would not have justified even a very cheap ticket, which was far from what it was. We had a tasting menu and one extra dish - and without exception, every plate we were brought was a disappointment. The overwhelmingly consistent feature was the food's blandness. None of the dishes had any flavor. While the textures were not bad the taste was totally absent. Even the appearance seemed somehow artificial and stale. The dishes might as well have been reheated frozen ready meals. The quality was below the standard of what you would get in a supermarket. Aside from the terrible food, service was fine, but the decor was faded and old. We would strongly advise you not to bother!",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"

858,-maO9SpkBImaSus-WmvTpA,grace c.,1.0 star rating,"Went there for restaurant week looking forward to a nice meal but was utterly disappointed.  The whole feel and look of the restaurant was very modern and chic, which I liked but the food was sub par.  I'm not sure if it's because it's the prix fixe menu items - imagine a whole assembly line in the kitchen where making of the dishes almost becomes mechanical at the expense of the distinct flavor Perry St had hoped to present.  So on to the food, I had the sautéed shrimp appetizer, which had good flavor but was overly salted.  Then the braised short ribs, which was 1) burnt and 2) dry.  The concept of melt in your mouth goodness was lost with this dish and every bite became a chore.  My mouth became just a tool for chewing.  For dessert, I had the molten chocolate cake.  Whereas I complained that Mercer kitchen over baked the molten chocolate cake, Perry St underbaked it.  The chocolate sauce just kept on oozing out with every bite.  This is one restaurant I will never go back to again.  Oh and I almost forgot, I woke up at 3am with bad cramps, no it's not that time of the month...the only other time I've felt such bad cramps after having the food was from dining at Olive Garden (after they had a health inspection, go figure).  Slight food poisoning, I presume.  The cramps did not subside until 6am, another reason on the list for me never dining there again.",Perry St,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, French"
