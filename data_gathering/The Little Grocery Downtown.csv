I don't know where they get their croissant from but it's perfectly flakey. It costs $1-2 more for croissant - just do it! It is totally worth it.  This is a small spot and I only see 1-2 people working here at all time. I recommend calling ahead for pick up and if you don't, it might be a wait. One time my order wasn't ready when I got there and I double parked, the guy got to my order right away and poured me a free cup of joe.

Did a search for a place nearby to eat and this was first on the list and 2.5 blocks away. Decided to try it and are very glad we did!Two tables outside and about 5 inside, quaint, homey and clean with free Wi-Fi! The extensive menu made it hard to decide what to get. Lots of breakfast items, sandwiches and coffees. We had breakfast and lunch sandwiches with coffee and latte. All were delicious and reasonably priced. We will definately try to return before we go back home to West Palm Beach.The shining star of this establishment however, was the proprietor! He was friendly, gracious and truly appreciative of our patronage and compliments on his offerings. It's SO nice to see this in a small business owner. He really seems to enjoy his customers and delights in making them feel welcome. This naturally caries over into the food he makes for them. Truly outstanding.

7,KFFbjxO1NCRuevHCDV98lQ,Samantha H.,1.0 star rating,"This place deserves 0 stars. Do NOT waste your time here.I ordered (1) Quiche du Jour and (1) Egg Sandwich with Meat & Cheese. My options for the sandwich were croissant (second option: everything bagel, third option: plain bagel), american cheese and bacon. What I received was an egg, cheese and ONION omelette on a WHOLE WHEAT bagel. I'm extremely confused as to where the onion came in as a replacement for the bacon (I can't eat onions). I also paid for extra bacon on the side and received none. And what's up with the restaurant not calling to check that it was okay to use a whole wheat bagel? I provided 3 options for my sandwich bread and whole wheat wasn't one of them.Additionally, the Quiche du Jour was inedible. So upsetting because I love Quiche du Jour! Little Grocery Downtown's Quiche du Jour tastes like someone accidentally dropped it in a dirty sink. Food aside, my biggest concern with this place is the customer service. I called the restaurant to let them know they got my order wrong and the guy who answered the phone was in denial. He told me that it said I wanted onions... as I was staring at my order confirmation that said otherwise. I told him the correct order (read it word for word from my screen) and he said ""Well we're closing in 15 minutes and I have two more orders to deliver so you'll have to come in tomorrow to get a refund.""Excuse me? No. I kindly told him I will not be coming in for a refund. The purpose of ordering food online is so I don't need to leave my house (I am sick). Second, he can take the responsibility of getting the order wrong and deliver the correct one OR process my refund electronically. I guess he didn't like this answer because he HUNG UP on me.When I tried calling back, he would not answer the phone. Since I placed the order on delivery.com, I reached out to them for support and explained the situation. The delivery.com representative said she was able to get through to them but they told her they are closing and that if she calls back in 15 minutes she could speak to a manager. Well, she has called back several times and no answer. So now delivery.com is taking the responsibility of providing my full refund.I will be telling my many friends and family in the area that we are done doing business at this establishment. My suggestions to The Little Grocery Downtown are to 1) Read your orders carefully. Putting an ingredient (onions) in someone's food that they are allergic to and did not ask for is a serious health hazard. 2) When you make a mistake, own it and apologize for it. You got the order wrong. That's okay. An apology and fixing it would have been the best thing to do. 3) Never hang up on a customer. This is extremely rude and unprofessional and reflects very poorly on your business as a whole.",The Little Grocery Downtown,4.0 star rating,$,"Grocery,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Sandwiches"

I ordered the same as I had before, an egg and cheese croissant.  It was just as delicious as the first time.  My boyfriend, hearing my raving about the croissants, decided to try one, and ordered a taylor ham and cheese croissant.  His came out with egg on it.  He doesn't normally eat eggs as they upset his stomach, but the owner was really busy tending to several other people who had come in, and he's not a complainer, so he decided to just eat it. He ate a little more than half, then stopped because like I said, not a big fan of eggs.  We brought up our plates to throw away...the owner asked him why he didn't finish his sandwich.  Now, like i said before, he wasn't going to even say anything.  People make mistakes, the owner was clearly busy, and we didn't want to make a big deal of it.  Since he asked however, my boyfriend told him ""I ordered taylor ham and cheese, but you gave me eggs.  I don't really like eggs, so I didn't finish it."" Now the ONLY appropriate response to something like this would be ""I'm sorry!"" We weren't asking for our money back, we didn't ask him to re-make the sandwich (we could have but we were trying to be courteous customers as the owner was super busy). Instead, he looked at what was left on the plate and said ""So, you don't like eggs, yet you ate more than half of it?"" We were floored.  You're seriously going to stand here and grill him as to why he ate as much as he did, pretty much accusing him of LYING about having ordered just taylor ham and cheese?! He then just pretty much shook his head, and proceeded to charge us full price.  Like I said, we weren't looking for a free breakfast, but after we informed you that you screwed up, you could at least have apologized for the mistake and not shamed him in front of the rest of the restaurant for YOUR mistake.  We were so turned off.  I told him don't worry, we'll go buy the delicious croissants from the bakery they get them from, and I'll make your sandwich at home.  We will not return after this!",The Little Grocery Downtown,4.0 star rating,$,"Grocery,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Sandwiches"

14,AQl5j2fV2Y3H1n9IyUB9qw,Gianna S.,1.0 star rating,"After reading great reviews, I decided to try this place but boy was I disappointed. WORST breakfast sandwich I've ever had-- and I've had a lot. The outside of the place is nice, like a cute French bistro. Inside, it's extremely small, and there's no organization...There's nowhere to form a line, and the coffee is self serve away from the counter and about 5 inches away from the one cook. Everything you need for your coffee (milk, sugar, straws) however, is on the OTHER side of the room. You have to walk around the line and past the register after already making yourself coffee from a weird machine. The coffee is good though. Today, we were pleasantly greeted, and after I was  handed a menu and about to order breakfast, a woman came in and ordered a coffee and a few other things before I got the chance to open my mouth. She ended up taking a whole 5 minutes to order, get the food, and pay for it. The worker could have told her to wait, since I had been at the counter and ready to order, but he didn't. A little annoying, but whatever. The service is SO SLOWWWWW. He took a few minutes just to ring up her order on the computer. Then we ordered, and everything was made fresh and quick. I got a Bacon egg and cheese on a roll, and a croissant on the side, and my boyfriend got an omelette. His omelette would have been just as good, if not better, if he made it himself. It was $10 and just OK. It didn't even look appetizing. My croissant was good, except he cut it and I didn't want it cut (it's more messy). My sandwich, on the other hand, was awful. I couldn't eat more than half. It completely fell apart, was wet and runny, and the bacon was uncooked inside the eggs. I came here because I was excited when I read the bacon was cooked inside the eggs on their breakfast sandwiches, but it was gross and I couldn't even taste the bacon. No wonder why it came out so quick. Our food was also served on plates that weren't very clean. When we brought the plates back to the counter at the end of the meal, the manager started making rude comments to me because I didn't finish my sandwich. I tried saying I was full (even tho I just couldn't eat it because it tasted bad), and he said ""blah blah blah you didn't even finish it!"" I just kept my mouth shut, but boy was that rude. I felt uncomfortable as we left. My boyfriend felt terrible and even said ""Well, we can cross this place off our breakfast list."" I have no idea where people think the hospitality comes from, but today the comments, food, and service just did it for us.

It's nice to see how your food is being handled orPrepared.I ordered a sausage, egg and cheese on a roll to go. It took about 5-7 minutes. It's a smaller breakfast sandwich but is tasty. The sausage really gives it a lot of flavor and it stayed warm/hot for about 25 minutes before we ate it. They take CC and there aren't many places to sit inside but no one was really eating there.

You can tell they care about their customers, and they are on a first name basis with their regulars. Anyway, I digress. Since I'm such a fatty, I had the french toast AND the smoked salmon, capers, and goat cheese omelet (Sike: I shared). But, they were both absolutely delicious. I know they are known for their french toast, but the omelet was equally as good. Very filling dishes. The place is very small and quaint.

It was $10 and just OK. It didn't even look appetizing. My croissant was good, except he cut it and I didn't want it cut (it's more messy). My sandwich, on the other hand, was awful. I couldn't eat more than half. It completely fell apart, was wet and runny, and the bacon was uncooked inside the eggs. I came here because I was excited when I read the bacon was cooked inside the eggs on their breakfast sandwiches, but it was gross and I couldn't even taste the bacon. No wonder why it came out so quick. Our food was also served on plates that weren't very clean. When we brought the plates back to the counter at the end of the meal, the manager started making rude comments to me because I didn't finish my sandwich. I tried saying I was full (even tho I just couldn't eat it because it tasted bad), and he said ""blah blah blah you didn't even finish it!"" I just kept my mouth shut, but boy was that rude. I felt uncomfortable as we left. My boyfriend felt terrible and even said ""Well, we can cross this place off our breakfast list."" I have no idea where people think the hospitality comes from, but today the comments, food, and service just did it for us. I won't be returning here again, and I won't recommend it for anyone else either.",The Little Grocery Downtown,4.0 star rating,$,"Grocery,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Sandwiches"

The owner was sitting down watching Euro football, or soccer as we say here at 830 this morning. There was one guy behind the counter and he cooks the eggs and food right in front of you on skillets. It's nice to see how your food is being handled orPrepared.I ordered a sausage, egg and cheese on a roll to go. It took about 5-7 minutes. It's a smaller breakfast sandwich but is tasty. The sausage really gives it a lot of flavor and it stayed warm/hot for about 25 minutes before we ate it. They take CC and there aren't many places to sit inside but no one was really eating there.

Since I'm such a fatty, I had the french toast AND the smoked salmon, capers, and goat cheese omelet (Sike: I shared). But, they were both absolutely delicious. I know they are known for their french toast, but the omelet was equally as good. Very filling dishes. The place is very small and quaint.

47,EVHGskjMl6a3PIwd10Kz7g,Jonathan C.,1.0 star rating,"I really wanted to like this place, but for various reasons I cannot. I tried The Little Grocery last year with my wife and we were both underwhelmed. But that was a while back, so I thought this summer I'd give them another chance. What a fool I am! I had to return food twice in the last week. Yes, I know, I should have learned my lesson the first time, but its close proximity and enticing menu persuaded me to try again. This past Saturday my wife and I ordered breakfast for pick up. The French toast was a soggy mess of disintegrated egg and bread-meal, soaking in a stagnant pool of thick syrup. It was an abomination and an insult to motel buffet breakfasts everywhere! Initially I thought it was a mistake, so I brought it back and the woman behind the counter told me that the tiny tinfoil container of sludge was as the chef had intended it. It was ""real"" ""French"" toast and was rich in egg and other ingredients and was supposed to have that appearance and consistency. A ""chef"" was responsible for that culinary atrocity? The translation for French toast is ""Pain doré"" or literally translated, ""golden bread"". I'm not an expert, but I did spend many of my summers growing up in France and did most of my undergraduate in Dijon, and I never once encountered such a perverse mockery of a breakfast item so beloved across the world. The Little Grocery did refund my money, however, with no questions asked.I was never going to return, but today I was ravenous and needed to grab something quick between conference calls. I decided to give them another try because I was craving a salad and figured that even the Little Grocery couldn't mess that up. Ha ha, my naïvité will be the death of me. I called in my order and ran over to pick it up. I made the mistake of not examining the contents of my order before I left. Well, I've already spent too much time on this place so I'll wrap it up. The salad portion was tiny and instead of grilled chicken it was some dodgy cold cut chopped up over wilted lettuce. I returned it immediately and informed the owner why I was displeased. He refunded my money without making any  eye-contact and offered no apologies or explanation. I know first-hand that customer service is not the forte of the French, but pride in culinary creations usually is.

Enticed by the many reviews of the 'best eggs in Hoboken', I had to go to see for myself. Eggs are my favorite food and I make them petty darn well myself. I am quite picky about eating eggs out as I find they are often over or under cooked. My husband and I came here for breakfast. He got the 'Big Breakfast' (egg omelette with cheese, sausage, ham, and bacon) with bread and a side of French toast.  I got the 'eggs, ham, and cheese' on a roll. My husbands egg omelette was the best I have had anywhere in my life and mine was the best egg sandwich I have ever had in my life...that would be hundreds maybe thousands of egg sandwiches. God only knows how many omelettes!  Sometimes in our lives, we think we have had 'as good as it gets' for a type of food preparation. Then we eat it prepared somewhere and it's on this whole higher different plane of goodness: I would call this a sort of metaphysical experience. Yes, eating the eggs here was  that experience as far as omelettes and breakfast sandwiches go. Yes, I know you are skeptical and so was I. Just go and see for yourself. And, it gets better: the French toast was incredible, the best also that I have had in flavor, sweetness, texture.

74,4WV-gsQF9QDC4mw-YZsOJw,Anna T.,2.0 star rating,"(UPDATE BELOW) So, it's been 3 years since my last review, and when I saw The Little Grocery started doing delivery, I decided to give them a second chance.Pro: we received the order within the standard delivery time of 1 hour. Everything went downhill from there. We ordered the meatloaf dinner for 3 with green beans, garlic potatoes and bread pudding. We also added mac & cheese for $4.50 extra. Cons: 1. Everything arrived cold - not just, ""I had other deliveries in the winter so your food got a little cold,"" but rather, ""we just took your food directly out of the refrigerator."" But oh well, I have a microwave, so this wouldn't prompt me to write a review. 2. We did not receive potatoes, but black eyed peas and rice. 3. For a dinner for three adults, we only received two small pieces of meatloaf. I called the store to ask them about cons 2 & 3. The man that answered said that they didn't have potatoes, so they just sent ""whatever."" I told him that normally when an item is unavailable, other restaurants call me with options, or give me a discount. They did neither. The man didn't have much of a response, just ""they should have sent you a note."" When I asked about the meatloaf, he said that the pieces were big, and he just cut them into two so they would fit into the container. This doesn't make any sense, because there was ample room in the container for three pieces. So I asked him what the weight of a standard sized piece of meatloaf should be, and he said ""5 oz."" So I said, ""Okay, so I should have a total of 15 oz of meatloaf here, but just split between two large pieces, right?"" He replied, ""more or less."" I weighed the meatloaf (in the container, to give him the benefit of the doubt), and the weight was 10 oz. So, yeah, no. He's a liar. It became immediately apparent that I wasn't going to get anywhere with this guy, so I hung up. So we microwaved our food. Everything was bland, limp, and uninteresting. The green beans were barely cooked, and had an ""old vegetable"" taste (I like crunchy green beans, but c'mon. These were raw). For forty freakin' dollars, it should have been at least average. But the absolute icing on the cake was - There was a four inch BLACK HAIR in the RICE I DIDN'T EVEN WANT. No one in my home has black hair. Not even close. To say I won't be ordering from them is a ludicrous understatement. Anthony David's right down the street has the same fare for less, and their quality is consistently excellent.**********UPDATE**************I posted this review on Delivery.com's website as well as Yelp.  A few days later I received an email from Delivery.com letting me know that the owners had seen my review, were very apologetic, and wanted to issue me a refund. Delivery.com also wanted to give me a $25 courtesy credit for the inconvenience. That was all very much appreciated, and I am happy to note that the owners were responsive to the issue, even if the person that answered the phone when I called was not. The customer service rep then asked if, in light of the goodwill credit extended, I would be okay with them taking the review down. I said I was not okay with that - they could keep the money, the review should stay. If bad reviews come down every time someone gets a credit, then the review process is broken. A few more emails back and forth, and the final result is - I got my money back (despite not having asked for it - so that's a definite plus for this business) and the review stays as is.

The other half is a bit rude.Stay away from the dinner selection. They only serve it until like 7pm and they barely heat it up for you. It came cold. The portion was undersized for the cost (~$13) and it didn't taste all that great either.This place does breakfast well.

Sadly, we don't get there as much as we used to but it is DEFINITELY worth it. Best egg sandwiches anywhere. Croissant, bagel, roll - doesn't matter. It's delicious. As others have mentioned, it's not a restaurant like a diner; it's a small, mom-and-pop establishment. So if there is a line, you might have to wait for your order. But there's a reason there would be a line. Plus, if you show up more than twice, the owner and his employees will remember you and treat you like family.The people who have complained were clearly looking for something more ""formal"", if you just want good food and friendly people, this is the place.",The Little Grocery Downtown,4.0 star rating,$,"Grocery,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Sandwiches"

123,qBsZsHyRXhmfG8Y7WnOojQ,Michelle M.,4.0 star rating,"Truly ""little,"" and quite possibly the best egg sandwich. Really tiny place with a great, fresh menu. Based on the ""best"" claim, I ordered a bacon, egg & cheese on a croissant - it was completely delicious. Prepared perfectly and the ingredients were ideal, although my selection of a croissant made it a little greasier than I would have liked - I'd probably select a bagel next time.My friend's Toscana sandwich was much less successful. They were out of brie so she got provolone. Together with the super-salty prosciutto (even for my salty pallet), sun-dried tomato and olive pesto, it was far too salty for her. She said she'd go back, but wouldn't order that sandwich again.4-5 (2 person) tables inside, 3 outside. Really cute and worth checking out.

As of 1:10, I had not received a confirmation email. I called them at 1:08pm. No answer so I left a message.I walked over there to make sure they were open and got there at 1:22. The person behind the counter was on the phone and my order was bagged up on the counter. Perhaps he was calling the delivery person. I was with my dog and already paid $5.50 in delivery fee and tip so I told him to just deliver it and my husband was home. I mentioned that I had not received a confirmation email. He said that sometimes there's a mistake. ???I got home at 1:37, 15 minutes after the food was already packaged and the food had not arrived. Meanwhile, the confirmation email was sent, at 1:22; the same time I showed up there. I called about my food, and he said it would be there soon.The food just arrived at 1:43pm, 20 minutes after it was already sitting on the counter. The delivery service should have been called prior to the food being ready. By the time the food arrived, it was not hot. In addition, my husband's French toast was completely mushy, unappetizing, and inedible inside, perhaps because it had been stewing in syrup for 20+ minutes as it sat on the counter waiting for pick up. I contacted Seamless for a refund. They responded saying they would give me 15% off a future order. For inedible food??? I've never had these problems with delivery.com. They also said I should contact the merchant, which I never had to do with delivery.com. If there is no further resolution, I will no longer use Seamless or go back here. It's a shame too because we were really looking forward to something different. P.S.

Because I live down the street, and there is no breakfast places nearby, I often stop in Little Grocery. Every time there's a wait. (Even if it's just 2 customers!!) The owner is always sweating behind the counter juggling customer orders, answering phone calls, moving dirty pots, pans, boxes, out of the way to make counter space to cook. It's so unorganized. There's shit EVERYWHERE. No customer wants to see dirty rags and dirty dishes touching your food!! Today I walk in and the owner is gone. There's a delivery driver who had been waiting for 20 minutes to get an invoice signed. How do you just leave your store?!! Once the owner returns I order a Taylor ham, egg and cheese on a roll. He questioned me and said ""Taylor ham? On a roll?"" I said yes. He obviously realized he didn't have ham or rolls but didn't feel the need to mention it to me.
