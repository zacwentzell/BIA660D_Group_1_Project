1,TcHNJKiJ2DcSaMLX0NEP3Q,Gen L.,2.0 star rating,"The issue with this place is its service. It's one of very few restaurants in the immediate Sheraton hotel area, and it is popular. I'm not sure if this creates an unmanageable server-to-customer ratio, or what the problem is, but there simply are not enough servers for customers. My husband and I visited this place during our visit to the Sheraton Lincoln Harbor. When we entered the restaurant there was a guy standing at the hostess desk, but he didn't say anything when we entered. We actually didn't notice him at first. I asked if we could sit at the bar area and he said yes, so off we went. My husband and I ordered several drinks and food from the bar. All were very good. The drinks were actually pretty excellent. However, the service was terrible. We had incorrect items in our order and it was difficult getting a server to return to our table in order to correct the issue. Throughout our visit there were very long lapses where we didn't see a server. We couldn't even order a second round of drinks. After our experience we decided not to visit again during our hotel stay.",Houlihan’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

We walked in and stood by the podium waiting for someone to seat us, after 10min we decided to just walk up to the bar and sat on our own. When the waitress finally came to our table, she tells us ""we are no longer serving food the kitchen is closed,but the bar is still open"". Mind you it was only 2am when she got to our table, and as long as you're sitting in the bar area they serve certain foods until closing which is 3am (we went on a Friday night, I posted a picture of their happy hour apps and drinks. Yes I did get it from the internet I forgot to take a picture of their sign that was on our table, but it's exactly the same).I told the waitress ""excuse me I don't understand, how can the kitchen be closed if the sign saids apps and drinks 4pm-closing served at bar area only ? We are sitting at the bar and it's only 2am, I understand if it was 2:45pm but it's not"" all she has to say was ""sorry but it's already closed."" So my boyfriend and I decided we might as well get a drink since we already payed an Uber to bring us here lol, even the drink took the waitress 25-30min to bring. And we had to rush and drink it because she told us ""we are getting ready to close if you need to put one last drink order I need to know now."" I told her ""no thank you, by the time it's done we will be kicked out of here and with the doors closing in our faces."" It was just a bad experience, with a rude waitress. The only good thing that came out of it was the fact that we were so hungry we decided to find a diner which was 20 min walk (we could have taken an Uber, but we rarely walk anywhere and decided the weather was so nice, 3am and it wasn't freezing!) we ended up having a nice walk and eating in a very nice diner called Malibu (will be posting a review about it)",Houlihan’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

It is very near to the Hudson River and the view of New York from the restaurant is just amazing. This is our third visit here and the food dint disappoint us. We totally loved the food served here. They offer varieties of drinks(Beer, Wine, whiskey, vodka, skinny drinks, lemonades). Before we have tried Chicken Parmesan which was very tasty, comes with pasta, one chicken breast with cheese and the bread. Its actually comes with enormous quantity. Two people can split easily as an entree. We also got 10$ off for yelp checkin.This time Our order was-Skinny Margarita - 4/5  It was good but does not feel like giving 5/5.Avocado Toast - 5/5 This is best dish I ever had of Avocado. It is like an avocado pizza with crust being so crispy. On bread they put a layer of guacamole which is very very delicious. And top of it they served it with fresh cheese. It is a perfect combination and we loved it.Rosemary Chicken - 4/5  This was my order and I liked it. It is 2 grilled chicken breast marinated with spices and rosemary. A side of boiled vegetables and cauliflower mash(on top of it they sprinkled bacon and cheese). You can substitute mashed potatoes for this side.Chicken Pot-Pie - 4.5/5 My Mr. ordered this one and it comes out to be more delicious than mine. It is the creamy gravy with vegetables and chicken with a side of biscuit. The gravy with chicken and the bun tasted amazingly well.

14,XZIAEE2ZN6yxESKzXiZRqQ,Auggie L.,4.0 star rating,"Went for DinnerFood - 5/5. The wings & things appetizer sampler was fried very well. The loaded potato skin had a good amount of bacon, the wings were crispy and the stuffed mushrooms had good texture. The horseradish dip was probably my favorite among the three sauces as it really counteracts all that fried flavor. The Korean Chicken had good flavor and the entire dish was seasoned very well. The gochujang on the chicken and the pineapple in the rice makes for a really rich flavor. The green beans were surprisingly tasty with good bite. My only complaint was the arbitrary gochujang ""smear"" on the edge of the plates; it doesn't really serve much purpose to the meal as you can't really use a stuck gochujang paste as sauce and the paste has a tendency to get all over you as you eat if you're not careful.Service - 3/5. The restaurant seemed busy but the lack of water refills irritated me. For one of my friends, his French Onion Soup came out along with the entree, which I thought was odd. When asked if this was normal practice, the server responded yes but I don't know if I would go by his word. In either case, I wish the server would ask if you would like soup/salad first before the entree as is standard for most restaurants.Value - 4/5. As with most chains the appetizers are priced high but the entree prices are pretty good with most being in the mid 10s range. They offered no bread though which puts them behind all their local competitors in terms of value.Parking - Mall Lot (Free)",Houlihan’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

Still, I have to say on a regular basis the service has been lacking. This time the bartender was nice, but we've had pretty rude servers in the past.We came in on Sunday for lunch and sat in the bar area. We rarely get service right away but on this day it was particularly long. Maybe ten minutes passed before someone came to take our drink order. I don't blame the bartender honestly because they were the only person at the bar helping multiple bar guests as well as tables. After quite some time a second person came to greet us, and we informed him that someone had came already to take our drink order so he took our meal order. It was just a little confusing to know at that point who was helping us, but we never saw the person who took our food order again. The food this time around also just wasn't the same. We ordered chicken nachos with extra cheese, calamari, and buffalo wings. The wings are always great but the calamari had a massive amount of tentacles as opposed to half rings and half tentacles. The chicken nachos didn't appear to have extra cheese but as we were eating we found a massive amount of unmelted cheese at the bottom that was just unpleasant to eat. Overall we will probably be back. It's a quick and easy spot close to home with decent food.",Houlihan’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

In either case, I wish the server would ask if you would like soup/salad first before the entree as is standard for most restaurants.Value - 4/5. As with most chains the appetizers are priced high but the entree prices are pretty good with most being in the mid 10s range. They offered no bread though which puts them behind all their local competitors in terms of value.Parking - Mall Lot (Free)",Houlihan’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

Still, I have to say on a regular basis the service has been lacking. This time the bartender was nice, but we've had pretty rude servers in the past.We came in on Sunday for lunch and sat in the bar area. We rarely get service right away but on this day it was particularly long. Maybe ten minutes passed before someone came to take our drink order. I don't blame the bartender honestly because they were the only person at the bar helping multiple bar guests as well as tables. After quite some time a second person came to greet us, and we informed him that someone had came already to take our drink order so he took our meal order. It was just a little confusing to know at that point who was helping us, but we never saw the person who took our food order again. The food this time around also just wasn't the same. We ordered chicken nachos with extra cheese, calamari, and buffalo wings. The wings are always great but the calamari had a massive amount of tentacles as opposed to half rings and half tentacles. The chicken nachos didn't appear to have extra cheese but as we were eating we found a massive amount of unmelted cheese at the bottom that was just unpleasant to eat. Overall we will probably be back. It's a quick and easy spot close to home with decent food.",Houlihan’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

Short and sweet, the experience was disappointing for me. The waitstaff during our meal did not come back and ask about coffee refills or if we needed anything to make our experience more pleasant. The food from the general consensus around the table of four plus one toddler was that the food was pretty good except for me. I ordered a griled chicken caesar salad which was extremely disappointing. The low calorie ranch dressing that I requested was the worst that I hae ever eaten, the romaine lettuce had some brown discolored leaves intermixed, and the grilled chicken was not bad, just dry with an unappetizing flavor. When the server came to remove the dishes and seeing my salad pretty much was left untouched  did not bother to ask if anything was wrong with it or how everything was. Another curious thing was when a dish with tortilla chips was served a few chips must have fallen from the plate onto the floor. Instead of picking them up on one of the few visits our server made to our table they were left on the floor finally to be  ground into the carpet by other passing diners.

While my parents waited for me, my mother noticed a roach scurrying across the table where we had our meal. She  swatted it and brought it to the attention of a nearby service person. That person called our waitress who, in turn, called the manager. I walked back from the restroom to a table full of people and on-lookers. The manager offered an awkward apology and said nothing could be done about the check since we had already paid. My parents were not happy with the experience, and I just wanted to put this portion of the evening behind us as quickly as possible. As we exited, the manager gave us a $25 certificate for our next visit. The certificate will go unspent since I don't plan on subjecting family, friends, co-workers, or clients to the potential of a similar experience.

Once the bartender was confronted (shaved head with glasses) he raised his voice and talked down to a paying customer. *Two receipts were handed, I had him charge both receipts on my card, then comes back with another receipt twice the amount of the original I paid for*The bartender states there was another tab that wasn't calculated..  Upon review, 4 additional charges were added on and he went postal when confronted. Long story short, I would highly recommend not going back to that location. It's a damn shame considering where they are located.",Houlihan’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

Houlihans is one of those places where you can't expect fine dining quality of food or service; but for a cheap and cheerful chain restaurant, it definitely suffices for a Friday night dinner with the kids.I came here on a Friday, pregnant and hungry, with my fiancé and step kids, and proceeded to order half the appetizers on the menu. The stars: wings n things, spinach dip, and the flatbread pizza (which is the only thing I wouldn't reorder. It's worth noting - I am giving this establishment 4 stars as i think we gained 4 pounds after eating here.I'm not sure what the negative reviews are about, I mean you can't have the highest of expectations  eating at a casual dining chain in Jersey.

The bartender was friendly and accommodating. I can see myself hanging out here during cool summer nights with some yummy bites & cocktails. I usually go with the Asian Chicken Lettuce Wraps, but decided to try the Ahi Tuna Salad instead. Let me just warn you... It has BANANAS in it. Yes. Tuna & banana. Odd combination but it was surprisingly alright. The jambalaya was delish, but I was thrown off by the beans that came in the rice. Shrimp was cooked just right. Very flavorful dish. We didn't really enjoy the Navajo Chicken Pasta :( It tasted like something was missing.The cocktails were a bit disappointing, waaah. My friend really enjoyed her strawberry moscow mule, but our peach twisted teas were very watered down and had a lot of sour mix in it. I only had two of these but woke up with a mild hangover...

The avocado egg rolls were cold. Then came two baked potato soup. They were both cold and was told because of the tone it was. They came back and was told they get microwaved. They were still cold. Next came the fish taco and loaded fries. Guess what? Both cold again. We decided to take it with us to reheat. Last came the dessert which was the only ok meal since it was supposed to be cold. What a waste of 60 dollars. We always give this place a shot since it's near us but will not be going for a long time again. Nothing to do with the service or staff but it's all on the kitchen!

It was a Saturday night and the places was not very busy.- Appetizer ordered first then entrees ordered a few minutes later as drinks arrived,-  Appetizer finally arrives, far too long a wait. Halfway through it the server sneaks up behind us and mutters ""your entrees are here, would you like them""? Really!! We said no obviously and sent them back. No excuse for such poor order management.- Wouldn't be more than 5 minutes after we finished our appetizers, the entrees make their reappearance. My burger had been put back in oven as the plate was hotter than Hades! My wife's Nachos were ice cold!- Nachos sent back so I am eating alone. They finally arrive with what looks to be a fresh plate delivered by the manager who apologizes and states there will be no charge. - Being a glutton for punishment, I order apple pie and coffee. Dessert arrives and when it is finished, a cold cup of dark foul smelling liquid arrives. I assume this was the coffee. I leave it there.We pay the check, which to cap it off, overcharged on our glasses of wine and walk out. At the end of the day, go to a chain eatery and expect this kind of performance, but it doesn't have to be. Food also was subpar and unappealing. It shouldn't really be this hard.

Considering how hard it can be to find parking this is wonderful! The food is very average here, but it's a chain restaurant and obviously isn't gourmet. The buffalo chicken salad though is kind of outstanding when you have a hankering for buffalo chicken. The veggie burger is pretty good as well. They do a happy hour that has great prices and a ferry to the city is right across the street as well as a bus that takes you to port authority. I've had great service and awful service.

The restaurant has good  food. Lots of parking. Great ambience along the Hudson.  A Wonderful wonderful time was had by all of our guests.When the reservation was made I was clear that the party was a CHAMPAGNE party.  However when we arrived they had NONE.  And in the absence of the champagne they comped us a generous portion of appetizers and a limited number of deserts.   I would have appreciated a call to inform me that we were  in a no champagne scenario.  We might have made another choice, like the Masina.Fortunately a few good wines were in the menu so we were able to carry on the planned assortments of toasts for our party.The Moscata was an acceptable alternative.While I was happy with the overall dining experience, I was disappointed with the server and  the handling of check at the conclusion of the event.  Our server was personable and singled handedly managed our large party.  I think it would have been better to have had some help for him.The server allowed flexibility with pairs and groups of our guests to have separate checks prepared.  That isn't a service you usually get. We were happy with that.Our total unhappiness occurred when my wife and I received the primary check which was to have included only our food,  beverages and the 4 bottles of wine we treated our guest to.  Period.  It was $70 over that amount once a manager adjusted the check for a member in our party who was still present and whose food and beverages were inadvertently placed on our check.The server was told repeatedly by me what  food and beverages would be covered by me and my wife and that others needed to pay for their own food above and beyond any comped food stuff.  The server failed to ticket several items onto the appropriate other checks.  And there seemed to be confusion about what was comped or not comped by the manager. Therefore, We got left with a tab with unanticipated food costs.In retrospect we could have cleared all items and checks before any of our party left.  I could have asked to see all copies of checks to confirm that foods were or were not paid for b guests who had left.  And of course this only server could have communicated with me, as I had done repeatedly with him, when other items beyond the agreed upon items were placed on my check.We tipped him generously because he was a nice guy and he skillfully managed the order taking, delivery of foods , playing mediator around the no champagne mini crisis for  a large party solo but the confusion with checks at the end almost ruined what was otherwise a fantastic time.But all of that aside, everyone had a really nice time and appreciated how hard our server and the management worked to allow us to have a great time with our closest women friends.",Houlihan’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

He came over and said they don't open the patio if it's under 70 which is fine however, I'm simply asking one person to walk an extra foot at most and I feel with a beautiful day like today and tons of people are outside maybe making a few exceptions to make guests satisfied wouldn't be so hard.

131,-XiU34IQOkjLJw8hGBYzGw,Grace A.,4.0 star rating,"In terms of food, Houlihan's is basically indistinguishable from an Applebee's or chills. Which isn't to say that it's bad (who doesn't love to indulge in a ""salad"" loaded with buffalo chicken tenders, corn chips, and ranch every once in a while?), just that it's not destination food. What does make it a place worth seeking out, though, is it's amazing outdoor seating. The restaurant is a few feet from the pier and right on the water. There can be no better view on a sunny day then sailboats bobbing in the Hudson while you chow down on the fried food of your choice. I've also seen happy hour done on the outdoor deck. I haven't tried personally yet, but it looks like those people have the right idea.Sadly however, I'm not sure if the outdoor seating can handle large groups for sit down meals without reservations or just not at all. On a weekday a group of ten had no problem being seated for lunch inside but couldn't be accommodated outside. I would call ahead to check.",Houlihan’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

The bartenders were very attentive and nice, but only giving the place three stars because the list of beers on tap is so very limited. Also, the place was so full that the Blue Moon (one of the few drinkable beers on tap) keg had to get changed about every 30 minutes. Every time someone from my group would go up to order a drink, they had to wait like 15 minutes for the keg to be swapped. The bartender was nice enough to hand-deliver the drink to whomever was waiting for it though, so kudos to him. The restaurant itself was very clean and the restrooms were surprisingly tidy considering how packed the place was. There was no paper in the restrooms though, so I had to keep asking the hostess for napkins every time I used the ladies room. Sitting under one of the big trees at the outside bar was a bit of a pain in the butt however because tiny green bugs and leafs kept falling on us.

Other than this major draw- the food was lackluster. I had two dishes which comprised of two starters. I had the mac n' cheese and the spinach dip. Both dishes were overly salty. The Mac n' cheese was overpowered by the saltiness. I appreciated that it had scallions, breadcrumbs, bacon and sour cream accenting it, but the overall salty nature of the dish was diminishing these elements. The spinach dip was so greasy. It's unfortunate because it had good flavor, but it was just overly greasy. My soda was not mixed properly. Being from Texas, I ordered a Dr Pepper, and I have to say I was disappointed by the overly sweet soda presented.

We sat inside at the bar, asked for 2 Stellas. The bartender lady served our beer immediately. We started drinking and almost halfway the glass (it was tap beer), both of us said ""this beer is sweet?!?!?""We got her attention and told her that the beer tasted funky, kinda sweet. Do you have it in bottle?The story begins here.First thing she asked was ""have you ever had Stella before?"". We said that was the only beer we drink.Then she grabs a glass, goes to the tap and pours some, tastes the beer, comes back to us and says ""the beer tastes OK to me"". We don't have Stella on tap, would you like anything else?We asked for 2 bottles of Becks, moved on, ate some stuff and left. She didn't put the initial two beers on the check.Houlihan's staff, here are some tips for you:1. Clean your taps. Excessive starch buildup on the taps turn into yeast if not cleaned and gives your beer a sweet taste. It's not healthy either, you might get closed for that.2. Never, ever question a customer if a customer had X product before. If someone sits at the bar and asks for 2 Stellas without looking at the menu, they probably know what they want to drink. In our case, we probably have been drinking Stella long before she was born, yet she was questioning us.3. If a customer tells you ""I only drink this beer"", believe it. If you don't believe, act like you believe. After that, no good will come from grabbing a glass and tasting the beer yourself.4. If you've gone this far and tasted the beer, don't come back to the customer and tell them it tastes OK. You're going deeper in the mud now. If it was OK, the initial complaint wouldn't have been made at all.5. Keep in mind that the person you're serving to might be a reviewer, some representative from the beer company or a mystery shopper hired by your company to evaluate the staff. These people will always come with problems, complaints and special request and will review how you've resolved the things.And dear Yelp people;The food is excellent at Houlihans, the cocktails are great and the servings are huge.

The bar itself smelled so we had to get a table. The waitress cleaned off the sticky table with a napkin and seemed upset that she had to bus her table. We luckily had hand wipes to clean the table ourselves. She came back in 7 min to ask us of we were being helped. We asked what the happy hour specials were and she left again. This time we waited about 12 minutes and she didn't come back. So a total of 20 min waiting at a dirty table without any water,  which was requested. We decided to leave and not waste our time with bad service. Mark was the manager on duty at the time. Not going back. Left and went around the corner to Austin's, awesome food and great service. Within 10 min, we were given bread and someone came by 3 times.",Houlihan’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (New)"

ZOMG they are amazing!!I would also recommend their nacho dish from the appetizer menu, with extra jalapenos on the side of course :).It's a great restaurant with a upscale bar and grill type feel, so I can't say it's where you'd go for a romantic date.

Appetizers are amazing if your just looking for a place to get drunk and your in a tight nudged I recommend this place especially on Friday evenings. They half the $5 appetizers which are well proportioned and their cactus bowl is to die for!!! For $10 you get a super sized margarita glass with Bacardi and other liquor and fruit its enough for 2 to share. Also when you go there ask for the club card. Which every time you dine at this location you will accumulate money until you hit $200 that's when you will get $25 back. It's worth it. And the view is beautiful great for dates.

At the end, she gave us our check and we were all set to pay and split the cost evenly. Not to mention that she circled the ""suggested tip"" as if she thought we would not tip. She then comes back and tells us she gave us the wrong check, but already charged a different amount on the card. Overall, I was not fully satisfied with my visit today. I'm a server too, so I 100% understand if you make some errors, or don't have enough time to check on us, etc. But her section was not busy at all (we were the only ones in her section), and then she went over to talk to her coworkers in a group talking about us.

That's ok of course, sometimes all I want is bar food and football but herein lies the problem. For all of the TVs this place, albeit mostly poorly situated, they are still running standard definition. That sounds like a first world problem but watching sports in anything other than HD is unbearable and frankly unacceptable to even a casual fan of the game.

For dessert we ordered a creme brulee which came out cold - it was premade and that was disappointing. Then we also had a 'Snickers Ice Cream Cake' that I don't remember the actual name. This dessert was really good but was enough for a family of 4.

This particular Houlihan's rarely has any waiting time at all, more than likely - you'll be seated the instant you get there. It has a very large indoor area which is popular for its central bar.

Getting noticed by a bartender will take a lot of time as they are either very preoccupied, or spend a lot of time at one corner (something I've noticed through the years). There's an outdoors bar as well, which is decent summertime spot.Parking is decent, considering the lot itself is probably 3-4 football fields long.Houlihan's food is your typical mix of bar-and-grill, and comfort food. Fried appetizers, grilled chicken, steak and everything else you know about a franchise restaurant. My personal favorite here is the stuffed chicken breast. I usually find that waiting for something at this Houlihan's, even as simple as some ketchup, is usually a long wait.Overall, the food is decent and you can't beat that view of NYC (well, maybe if the harbor buildings weren't blocking it from your perspective).

I asked for the Thai style (they brought 2 extra spicey sweet and sour sauce on the side for free). I also tried a watermelon drink with vodka inside. It was sweet and sour and amazing!
