The location really isn't near a lot of residential spots so you have to drive to pick it up or pay close to $30 for delivery with the tip.Second time I ordered the same dishes- hot and sour soup was really gloopy and just not good (needed more hot and more sour). After two sips this was thrown out. Not a big deal since it was less than $2, but I will skip this next time.I requested for them to add scallions to the mapo tofu this time. That really brightens up the dish. The small container of rice it comes with is not nearly enough for this entree portion. Order an extra small rice.Still teetering between 3 and 4 stars, but I am excited by their extensive Sichuan menu and look forward to trying different dishes in the future.",Chengdu1,3.5 star rating,$$,Szechuan

I don't know how it took me 4 months since their grand opening to find this restaurant!!  It has an exceptionally large menu and the food is outstanding.  We ordered the braised fish fillet in chili sauce, the cucumber garlic salad (the best and most fresh I have had anywhere), the Chengdu vegetable dumplings, and the okra.  The braised fish was silky, moist and melt in your mouth with a subtle spicy chili sauce that was extremely balanced but not overpowering. This is served with white rice. The okra was out of this world, with spice and sweetness, perfectly cooked. The food is served rapidly and it was so yummy that we ate it all equally quickly. The hot tea is exceptional and complimentary. The service is warm.  The place is small with about 4 tables and window seating but with banquet style pink decor, paintings, and chairs: very cozy.

""Especially enjoy their Spicy Baby Wontons, their Double Cooked Pork, their Sautéed Bean Curd  Thread with Green Veggies. Ask for their plate of pickles and you will be sure of the delicious plate of homemade Chinese pickles.""For twenty years Chendu 1 thrived gloriously in Cedar Grove.  The New York Times haled it as ""Authentic Szechuan Cuisine.""  But recently it closed and moved to Jersey City, with few of its former trappings.  Now it is mainly a take-out place,  a stone's throw from the Holland Tunnel.Not knowing about these changes, my husband and I finally got around to trying it, and we dressed up a tad in great expectations.Initially we were disappointed, but intrepid.  We arrived soon after they opened at 11 a.m.  Most staff were bustling to pack freshly cooked food into many huge delivery containers.  In just three months at the new location and with little publicity, word has clearly gotten out that the Chengdu 1 is special.For almost an hour we were the only ones to eat in.  But the busy staff did not neglect us.  One who seemed to be in charge pleasantly greeted us, and we soon discovered that the chefs' do not sacrifice their commitment to high quality.  From the exhaustive menu (see online chengdu1jc.com/order-onl…) we ordered  Braised Whole Fish w/ Hot Bean Paste, Okra w/ Garlic Sauce, Tangy Eggplant Medalians, and Smoked Tea Duck -- an outstanding feast that fully lived up to my friend's description.   At home we will have two more feasts on the abundant left-overs.Psst!  Treat yourself to an adventure.

We ordered the braised whole fish with hot bean paste, the double cooked pork, pumpkin with ginger scallion for us and chicken wings and chicken and broccoli for the kids. Overall, it's okay - but I think King Szechuan wins over this place on all fronts. Everything lacked robust flavor. The whole fish was nicely braised but the sauce lacked the punch you in the face flavor, and didn't have any veggies (King Szechuan loads the sauce with lotus root, and yummy veggies that soak up the sauce). The double cooked pork was on the dryer side, so had more chew than one would expect for double cooked pork. The pumpkin had no ginger or scallion flavor whatsoever. Food is okay if you need a quick szechuan fix but I'd probably go for King if you have the option.

But let's just say you need to be choosy in terms of what you order off the menu because of some dishes are better than others. But in my opinion, even the good dishes are just average compared to similar places in Manhattan. Things to order: Fish fillet in chili oil (水煮鱼）Cumming Lamb (孜然羊肉)Lamb dumplings (羊肉水饺)Thing to avoid:Spicy dry pot (麻辣香锅)This is an UNauthentic version of the classic Spicy Dry Pot.
