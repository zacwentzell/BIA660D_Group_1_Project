1,wT1H1LRgytqyZ06jR4u6ig,Kristian D.,3.0 star rating,"I was fortunate to stay in a great part of New York on my last trip, and the unit just happened to be near The Ear Inn. When I learned it was one of the oldest bars in the city, I made sure to try it out. They are located on Spring Street near the Hudson in a small brick building. It is a bit of a walk from the Spring or Canal Street stations.The interior of the bar is fairly narrow with a medium sized bar and dining room in the rear. On my visit on a Tuesday night, the bar was packed with a lot of older businessmen grabbing a drink and some greasy food. Overall, the bar lacked a lot of unique character compared to most in the neighborhood and was not a good value.If The Ear Inn is slow, you might have a better time than I did. It is not a bad bar by any means, but it is more of an average neighborhood bar serving a local audience. It is an old bar, but it is hard to notice inside.",The Ear Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

Dinner is where the place falls flat.Very cool, old/historic spot. Yes, you've probably read that it, along with McSorley's are amongst the oldest continual watering holes in NYC. The place oozes with old-school charm.The bar is simple. A dozen or so beers on tap ($8), and a short, but solid cocktail list ($12). You could easily spend a cozy evening here and have no complaints.The much-hyped burger was indeed the best item that made it to our table. However, the vaunted ""Pat LaFrieda"" beef is no longer a specialty in the City as you can find it all over the place, most notably at the ever-growing Shake Shack chain. You probably won't be disappointed in the burger ($12).Specials:Mussels - 1/4 were not open. This is not a good sign. Tasted very fishy and could have greatly benefitted from a more garlicky base. Mac & Cheese ($7) - How does one screw this up? By putting what seems like Kraft (out of the box) into a dish heated over the open grill. It was a watery mess with flavorless pasta and very diluted cheese mix.Spaghetti w/ Shrimp ($17) - Oof, the worst plate of them all. The shrimps were cooked far beyond what is required and in turn were very tough and flavorless. Likewise, the spaghetti and marinara sauce was inexplicably void of flavor.Avoid the kitchen until you've had enough drinks to make it worth your while and we've got a 4-5 star spot!",The Ear Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

8,vPyIX5As6g4H9EnBDQCHeQ,Steph C.,5.0 star rating,"I have now been to three different bars that claim to be the oldest in New York City--McSorley's, Old Town Bar, and Ear Inn. I went to the last two with my friend Adam S., and when he mentioned that Ear Inn was the ""oldest continuous bar in NYC,"" I was like wait a minute, Adam, what about Old Town Bar? Are you saying they're lying trash?As it turns out, ""oldest bar in New York"" is a pretty hot merit badge, so there are a handful of spots with viable claims based on small but notable distinctions, such as whether they moved locations, or whether they were ever closed between the 19th century and today. I'm reminded of the time I went on the London Eye, which was billed as ""the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel."" It was the highest Ferris wheel in the world for six glorious years, and now it's the highest cantilevered Ferris wheel.Anyway, it was a great bar, delightfully old school, with a cozy atmosphere and eclectic decor. I met up with Adam around four o'clock on a Friday afternoon, and the place was busy, though not so busy that we couldn't get a table and kick back for a couple of hours. Service was great. Everyone on staff was super hospitable, and we got our beers right and quick. I had a couple Goose Island IPAs, and they hit the spot.I wasn't about to order food because I'd just had two lunches, and had two dinners to run to next, but I did help Adam polish off a plate of dumplings. Not like Irish potato dumplings, but straight up potstickers, fried pork dumplings served with soy sauce. They were pretty satisfying, actually, and I enjoyed eating Chinese food at the oldest continuous bar in NYC. Just another example of Asians taking over the world. (Come to think of it, the London Eye was outdone by the Star of Nanchang, then the Singapore Flyer. The current highest observation wheel is the High Roller in Las Vegas, which is a wonderful American city crawling with Asians.)I had a great time here, and would recommend it if you want a piece of history with your drinks.

This is an old school bar with fantastic old school ambiance combining bits of a dive bar, speakeasy, and steakhouse all into one. It is definitely worth going to get one (overpriced by far) drink. The crummy beer selection has about 7 to 10 beers priced at about $8 a beer. If they could just serve one decent craft beer, I would probably be back. The glasses of crummy wine go from $11 to $13. I came with a friend for the burger (2.5 out of 5) after I saw it on a Thrillist list. The burger is definitely overrated and has no place being on any top burger list. It is a basic bun and juicy but flavorless meat. The burger did not cost much, maybe about $10 ($14 with the tip I included). Overall, come for one drink and ambiance.

This is your typical irish pub with 5/6 beers on tap a fully stocked bar. My group got there around 6/7ish, it wasn't crowded but there were people occupying the tables/bar. It served as a great in between spot to figure where to go to next. The bartender was nice, the beer was good, and the atmosphere was chill. I would go back for a few pints and maybe to sample some food. Not sure how it gets later in the evening, but I recommend bar you're looking to talk and drink. The music wasn't loud and the selection is solid. The Ear Inn is off the beaten path so it's hard to find unless someone tells you about it or you're wandering around SoHo.

This is an old school bar with fantastic old school ambiance combining bits of a dive bar, speakeasy, and steakhouse all into one. It is definitely worth going to get one (overpriced by far) drink. The crummy beer selection has about 7 to 10 beers priced at about $8 a beer. If they could just serve one decent craft beer, I would probably be back. The glasses of crummy wine go from $11 to $13. I came with a friend for the burger (2.5 out of 5) after I saw it on a Thrillist list. The burger is definitely overrated and has no place being on any top burger list. It is a basic bun and juicy but flavorless meat. The burger did not cost much, maybe about $10 ($14 with the tip I included). Overall, come for one drink and ambiance.

Our server was rude and clearly hated her life and possibly us.  I was excited to order a Hoegaarden on tap but when it came it was completely flat and stale and tainted by the cabbage in the air.  I seriously don't know how anyone eats here - I wouldn't have been able to stomach it and I'm not a very picky person.I guess some people are drawn to angry wait staff and disgusting beer but life is simply too short.",The Ear Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

It was known to be a men's only speakeasy bar, but now WE IN THIS PIECE. Anyways, I can go on and on about the history on this place because of how interesting it is, but it's best to just read it on the menu. It's a low key place and I've come here before with coworkers to get a drink during our lunch time to ease our stress at work. The burgers from The Ear Inn is excellent, it's definitely something I look forward to. Honestly, I've tried their other items on their menus and it was all good and delicious.

I won't lie that we were nervous about ordering food considering how 'divey' the place looked but regardless we ordered the mac and cheese and the hot and spicy shrimp.

A stroll to the far west side of the West Village brought me to Ear Inn at around midnight on a Friday. The entire bar was packed, the rear even more than the bar, patrons drinking and eating on in the very unassuming rear, old tables covered with white paper, glasses holding crayons topping them for any aspiring artists. We eventually just posted up at the bar and ordered some fried pork dumplings; for what they were, they were pretty tasty! Drinks were good and cheap; $7 for a pint of cider was okay, though, at that point in the evening, I was sticking strictly to water. (Haaa.)

51,Z43kdZVcUJnx101GisCbtA,Ellis B.,5.0 star rating,"Why I LOVE the Ear:1)  Sunday nights.  GREAT jazz standards, Dixie Land, swing from highly acclaimed trumpet player Jon-Erik Kellso and his ""Ear-regulars"" band. The music is presented in a casual, ""let's kick back and jam"" manor.  And given the limited size of the performance space, the players are almost mixed in with the tables....feels like you're really part of the music!!  Excellent food.  Great atmosphere. Over the course of several years, I've tried to make it over to the Ear for this great music as often as I can - which isn't often enough.2) The back area is terrific for large groups.  This Saturday (lunchtime) I had reserved the back room for 12.  A few unexpected guests increased our number - but no problem -   our smiling, welcoming waitress Christine (Kristine?) gladly accommodated all of us.  All of the menu items we ordered (salads, burgers, dumplings, etc.) were greatly enjoyed.3)  Lots of easy parking in the area - which isn't the case in most of Manhattan.4) Authentic old New York charm  - in a landmark building.   Fewer and fewer places are like this......",The Ear Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

The $30 minimum probably helps defray the Merchant Fees the business must pay. No mind to me as I carry both hard currency cash and plastic. Many people today only carry plastic and sometimes have trouble paying their bills as a result. The EAR is a bar is a bar. It might be a little rough with the old time bartenders.

PRO TIP 2: you will get yelled at if you take a phone call in the bar. texting etc. is fine. just don't be  douche about it. the staff is friendly-ish, but to the point blunt. i appreciate honesty, so to me...i find them refreshing and super likable. to tourists and the entitled probably not so much.  staff is typically one bartender and a waitress taking food and drink orders from the tables. they are hardworking folks, so be patient when the bar is slammed. service is good and done with a smile and clever comments!the bathrooms? divey. old. femmes have to deal with one stall. so for girl groups this place is a struggle. the dudes room have two urinals and a toilet that are WAY TOO CLOSE TOGETHER! i mean close enough that you're definitely getting backspray from the guy next to you who's pissing at the adjoining urinal. seriously, wtf! lol. i know this is an old school joint, but i feel like while i was taking a piss that the guy next to me was my shadow. ugh. this place opens at noon. serves booze soaking food. is close to PIER 40 which is where my posse and i were heading for a boat event. and sell beer at a reasonable price. i wouldn't say it's cheap though. i've had way cheaper in nyc. actually it should be cheaper. 1 star off for the weird credit card policy and 1 star off for the urinal situation. drops the mic no where near the men's bathroom!i out.",The Ear Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

I mean I can't stop thinking about it (and I rarely ever eat burgers). There are some tables in the front near the bar and a section of tables in the back if you're there for more of a dinner with a group. Overall just a really chill place with a warm inviting vibe.

The bar itself is fine and I can look past the fact that a server will forget a drink or two once in a while, but there is absolutely no excuse for angrily yelling at a group of 10 people for asking if we can push a couple tables together. You probably also didn't need to sprint across the room and slam your hands down to desperately clutch the table that got rotated a couple inches, either. I promise, we weren't going to steal it.Incompetence aside, this was without a doubt the rudest, least respectful level of service I've ever received outside of a Dick's Last Resort.

88,PIQWsnbir7VGcoMhy8DNDg,Ed L.,4.0 star rating,"When in New York City, you hit up the Ear Inn in SoHo.At least that's where I went after dropping off my stuff in Jersey City upon arrival. First things first upon my short stay in New York City, is to hang out and enjoy the nightlife.  I didn't do a mobile check in since my iPhone ran out of juice in transit, so I just made a mental note that I was here. I came here with my friend, who lives in Jersey City and arrived here around 7:30pm on Thursday, May 9. This place was already packed to begin with. I guess people find any excuse to party and drink at any time of the day. With that said, a group of marathoner friends had already camped out here waiting for us to arrive. We were basically fashionably late and got a table pretty close to the door. It was okay, since my legs were already kind of tired from the travel and running at least one marathon on this trip. The overall experience was pretty good. We stayed here till about 9pm and left thereafter to another bar before making our way back to the PATH. My Jersey City friend was drunk, so I had to be the sober one to make the decisions. LolThe Ear Inn is located at 326 Spring Street in the South Village district of Manhattan. Since this place does get crowded on any given night, it was interesting to catch myself at a bar, but when in NYC, it's bound to happen I suppose. The noise level of this place can be classified as loud enough, since you can hear people talk, but that's about it. The lights were low enough to be sort of romantic in nature, but I guess that's how bars are. Cant say enough about driving in New York City, so save yourself the car keys and take the subway or walk it.  They have street parking up front or nearby, but its usually a hassle anyway, so public transport or walking is your best bet.  Ear Inn takes credit cards, so that's always a plus for me. As it turns out, since it was my 1st time in NYC, a friend of mine actually took the check after we ate and paid for both our meals. I didn't realize it till he gave our server his credit card without seeing the bill. That's pretty awesome, I think! I thanked him, of course. It was a nice night to hang out with friends with a couple of beers and dinner in New York City, that's for sure!I ultimately found solace with the angus burger, which was okay. It was tasty and delicious, but the price was well over $10, which came with French fries on the side. I ordered it medium.  I also had a couple of guinesses and a corona, which all hit the spot as well.  The beer, while familiar, was excellent as always. The company here was rather good, especially when most of them had run multiple marathons over the course of several years. The Ear Inn seemed too small for the patrons it was serving, but at least it had a bathroom in the rear of the establishment. Not sure if you can call this place a bar or a restaurant, since it does do both. We did sit next to the photo of Abraham Lincoln that had a sign that said something about Republicans. Probably too stoned to remember it though, but I remember that photo.  The company was great and the service was good. I enjoyed myself here before bar hopping around later that night. Recommend it if you are in the area and need to unwind from a tough challenging day. A few beers will help numb it all down.

I sat at the bar and positioned myself where I would have good sight to the band when they played. Barry the bartender was a major highlight. Straight talking and honest about the menu and his recommendations were spot on -- as were the recos from the rest of the staff. I ordered the Lamb Burger medium-rare and it was delicious! And it was done perfectly. I also got the fried pork dumpling appetizer -- also very flavorful and not greasy at all.Now let's talk Jazz! The ""Earregulars"" as they are called were top notch! Great chops. I'm pretty snotty about musicians since it is my background and they did not disappoint. The mix was Bass, Guitar, alto sax and trumpet. For such a small place I was worried with so much brass in the house but their dynamics were perfect for the room and mutes were used as well when needed. A few guest performers joined in and were also terrific. One woman sang and blew my mind. Her voice was a time travel to a Bix Biederbecke performance. The clientele was also wonderfully eclectic. The age range was 20s-60s and every shape and size. This place was such a wonderful surprise of good reasonably priced food, good people and culture. With a homey feel.

It's a blend of the past few decades meshed into one bar.Everyone who works here is super friendly, full of smiles and from around the area- they def. make this place feel even more like home! The people who work here are very down to earth and that's hard to find in Manhattan. The Ear Inn has the perfect equation for a comfortable place to relax: It def a laid back vibe- very casual, a little dirty, and a no cell phone policy.  What I like about this place is that people of all ages can come here and either enjoy a meal, drink, dessert or all three together while listening to live band music (they are there every Sunday).

My wife and I were at the Ear Inn  the fateful night Emily and the rest of her rude posse attempted to foul up the Ear Inn. It was out first time there ( for dinner and drinks). We were meeting another couple for dinner. Emily and the rest of her skankified crew were loud, obnoxious and acting very entitled. Standing on chairs, screeching and disrupting the dining area are with their loud mouths. When asked to leave, the motley crew started to whine like children ""their money was not welcome there"". That is 100% accurate. A round of applause escorted their trashy asses out the door.After that temporary interruption, we enjoyed a lovely dinner. The kale salad, quiche and mussels were divine. Our servers went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our visit and we will be back.

I came here in the hopes of finding some decent beer, sunday funday type of day, and when i came to this bar i saw it was fairly crowded so getting a table for a group of six seemed to be a challenge. We were seated all the way in the back next to the ladies bathroom and i felt like i had 0 room to breathe in this tight cramped space. I feel like this bar tried to cram as much tables and furniture as possible without thinking of space and comfort. Anyway the waitress was really friendly and had a good attitude, the options of draft beer for seven bucks were pretty decent including guiness blue moon and oktoberfest, and they were cold which quenched my thirst;). They also have cocktails and other bottled beers , i havent tried their cocktails but id love to see considering the large options i saw out in he front. This place seems great to catch up with friends or have lunch, and the menu looks good with items like dumplings burgers and sandwhiches to soups.

It's a huge neon sign that once said ""Bar"", but the 'B' is messed up, so it reads ""Ear"", hence the name. Incredible old building was  built before 1812 and was originally the home of James Brown, an African-American United States Revolutionary War veteran, who was the proprietor of a tobacco store on the ground floor of the house. It is rumored that Brown is one of the soldiers near the front of the boat in Emanuel Leutze's painting ""Washington Crossing the Delaware.""In 1817, a tavern opened in the space, making it one of the oldest bars in New York City. Its proximity to the water made it popular with sailors and longshoremen. It had a brewery that was later turned into a restaurant.Today, the Ear Inn is no longer on the shores of the Hudson, as subsequent development saw landfill push the riverbank further west. The Ear now sits between Washington Street and Greenwich street, just east of the West SIde Highway. Ok! All that history is making me hungry. The Ear has one of the BEST burgers in NYC. let me repeat that. One of THE BEST burgers in NYC. I don't know what they do to make them so delicious, but they are huge and amazing. They come with a side of roasted potatoes and a small salad. Although I've only had the burger here, I did sample the New England Clam chowder, which was money, and the dumblings, which were also delicious.

The wait staff, however, was wonderful. These ladies were sharp, engaging and fun to deal with. Our main waitress hailed from Cork, Ireland and she was a delight. Our table had everything from burgers and chili to a rack of lamb. The entrees were all exceptional (as were the fried dumpling appetizers) and the drinks were replenished with merely a look at our waitress. We got to talk a bit with the chef; he concocts some great dishes in the tiny kitchen and it is always fun to watch him work from the tables. The vibe was happy and upbeat like it usually is at the tables in back. I had their burger, and it was delicious. 82% lean with 18% fat, they are hand-made on the flat top and are so delicious and juicy.

His entree came with a salad as well. I thought my food was pretty good. The salad dressing was creamy (looked like Russian) so I scraped most of it off since I prefer vinegary dressings, but it was still good and a refreshing accompaniment to my shrimp and crab cakes. The portions were generous for the price and I couldn't finish my food. I thought the shrimp and crab cakes were well seasoned and fresh and delicious. I didn't try my friend's food, but he finished all of it, so I assume it was good.There are crayons on the table so we entertained ourselves by drawing on the paper tablecloth.I liked the old-timey ambiance of the pub and definitely enjoyed myself.

Ended up drinking the house beer which is made by Brooklyn Brewing with a close approximation of the recipe used to make Fidelio Beer originally made onsite at the Ear Inn. The bartender was really nice as well as the patrons!Being a bit hungry, we tried 2 different items before making our way to a Holiday party nearby:- Spicy Shrimp: About 5 shrimp in a shallow dish with a really tasty spicy sauce based on Sriracha. A bit of a small dish, but the dipping bread provided made it worth it I think. The bartender was nice enough to bring us out some more bread w/o being prompted so that we could finish up the sauce.- Pork Dumplings: Hand-made and served maybe 5 or 6 to the plate with a soy sauce based dip. These were not bad.In addition to the above, sampled the NYC Hot Sauce they stock made by Belcestro's locally. This was phenomenal and based on habanero. No preservatives, guar gums, or any other rubbish - all natural.Before I mentioned the people here are nice. We started talking with a nearby couple and they ended up buying us a highball of Woodford Reserve Distiller Select. That was some strong Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey but I think it definitely tasted a bit better than Jack Daniels from Tennessee.I could definitely see why a lot of friends from Arup used to go here after work (and some of them still do!).",The Ear Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

And nothing inside the pub has changed since -- check out the memorabilia, who needs a museum?The house was built for James Brown (not the one you're thinking of), a black man and aide to George Washington during the Revolution. After the war, he settled in New York and worked in the lucrative tobacco trade. He was successful enough to move to the suburbs near the village of Greenwich and build this fashionable Federal townhouse. In later years, it would become a Speakeasy during Prohibition and the upstairs apartment had been used as a boarding house, a smuggler's den, and a brothel -- interesting as no women were allowed in the bar! Ghosts have been heard and seen, in particular one ""Mickey,"" a sailor still waiting for his ship to come in.Since the end of Prohibition, the Ear Inn had no name and was only known to sailors as the 'green door', but in 1977 the new owners decided to avoid  lengthy reviews by the Landmark Commission over a new sign by simply painting out part of the existing neon BAR sign and alas, the 'Ear' was born.Today the Ear now sits in a designated Landmark of the City of New York and is on the National Register of Historic Buildings.

Best of all, set on a fairly deserted stretch of SoHo, Ear Inn feels like a familiar, private hideout. It's not - the building has been designated a historic landmark, and has a couple hundred years' worth of apocryphal trivia, but on a frigid weekday night, it felt like somebody's waking dream of a faraway, storied home.",The Ear Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

BUT that being said, if you're in the area it's worth a visit. It's super old, creaky, and when you enter, it feels like you've been completely removed from NYC and placed into an old secret speakeasy. Strangely, if you read the story of this very special house on the back of the menu (and it has quite an interesting history), you'll find that at some point in time it was a speakeasy. Eccentric & very cool knick-knacks, random pictures, and ornaments scatter all over the walls and it does have a homey feel.The food is generally consistently good, and the prices are reasonable. Mostly bar-type food, but they have specials every day, though they seem to largely remain the same every time I've visited. My co-workers love their burger, but I particularly like their side roasted potatoes.

I work right around the corner and have never seen it. Upon first sight it's pretty quaint. The sign is made out of an old neon 'BAR' sign with the corners of the B blacked out to look like 'EAR' which got a good laugh from my boyfriend and I.It's very small, but we sat near the back which was nice. I can imagine sitting towards the front could get a little annoying. The inside is old and cunning. Very European! Reminds me of the bars we used to head out too when I was living in Wales, which is where my boyfriend is from, so he was right at home here. The beer was good, not a huge selection like I'm used too, but good! Their house special is fantastic and their food was pretty good. Typical pub food, I had the irish beef stew myself as it was a special. I loved it! Very filling. Not to expensive for my boyfriend, myself and our three friends I certainly wasn't regretting treating! The wait staff was fantastic. Plus I got to doodle on the table, which is awesome in it's own right.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it gets really, and I mean really, loud. Pubs are usually loud but there's so many people so close together that you can't really have a conversation, even a pub one. Plus the lady in the next table over was listening in on our conversation because of this fact and kept butting in. It's not really the pubs fault, but it is rather annoying.

Concerned, he began to investigate, but then stopped after realising what it was: the smell of the dumplings.Apparently the dumplings tend to smell like that - something in the way they're cooked.

236,_YjmdXsFqjt0qzntmw5zXg,Thomas A.,1.0 star rating,"Just got home from my last trip to what used to be my favorite restaurant.Indignation, an upset stomach and soaked trousers is not something I deserve to experience by choosing to patronize a restaurant.As I already mentioned, this used to be my favorite place to go for a burger or maybe a fish entree, or both! I'd take groups of friends, dates, everyone. I first went there when a good friend of mine was playing jazz on one of their live music nights and just loved it.That said, today's experience has destroyed any desire of mine to ever return.So here's the story, I walk in a little after 7 with a friend, greet the bartender and waitress and are shown to the corner table in the back. I sit down and realize I just sat in a rather large amount of mystery liquid that was pooled in the contours of my seat. I get up and go tell the waitress that there's liquid on my seat and that I sat in it, and go to the restroom to try and soak as much as possible out of my trousers. I'm not going to say that it was urine, but it sure did look and smell like it. After I've soaked up as much as possible I head back out and ask the waitress if it's been cleaned up, which she says it has been. I go look and there's still a few spots of wetness, so I go and ask for a couple napkins. She then repeats herself saying that she cleaned it up, to which I say there is still some there.Did I mention that they didn't apologize to me once for this? I'm not one to make mountains out of molehills, I've worked as a server before so cut a lot of slack when it comes to mishaps, but not apologizing for something like this is not acceptable.So now, with dry seat and apparently a new waitress, we sit trying to act like nothing happened as to not ruin our dining experience, we order our burgers, both with swiss cheese and sauteed mushrooms, my friend's cooked medium and mine medium-well.The burgers come out with with sauteed onions, I point it out but say it's fine but the waitress quickly went and threw some mushrooms on top(apparently they are pre-cooked and kept next to the grill. I remember jokingly saying ""strike two"" at that point. My friend took a bite and showed me his very rare burger, mine was fine. Sipping my soda and eating the trusty Ear Inn burger, all seemed fine.We get the bill and I can't say I that I wasn't disappointed to see that our two sodas were on it. You ruin a customer's pants, you comp at LEAST a drink, restaurant 101. They have also raised their prices by about 30% since the last time I've been there. Were glasses of soda always $2.50? I honestly didn't feel bad leaving only 2 or 3 dollars as a tip.On the way out I ask the older bartender if he happened to be a manager, wanting to explain briefly what happened. Without any words, he walks away from me and gets a matchbook with the place's phone number on it and hands it to me. Not one word.Do you want to be treated like this? Then don't come here because there is a chance you will be.I had to head home to change my mystery liquid laden trousers and underwear, at which point I realize I've gotten a bad stomach ache- and all that comes with that...I will be calling soon to see if the owner/manager has anything to say about this atrocious series of events.To be clear on my rating, I would have given it two stars if I had not gotten the upset stomach. I would have given it three stars with adequate service and no rumbling bowels. I would have given it four stars with great service and no diarrhea. Lastly I would have given it 5 stars if I was engulfed in a time warp sitting here writing this, and I had just left having been served by the nice waitresses of years past, fair to low prices of a year ago and the nice feeling of having had a nice meal at my favorite restaurant.We had a good run old friend, but you can't treat me like that.",The Ear Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

A hearty chowder and a beer served in the old galley-looking main room made me feel more like Sir Francis Drake than a famished Manhattanite.

The chicken marsala, when they have it, is great and, like, $8 or $9. There is nothing exceptional about it at all, but I even love the bread and butter that you get while you wait for your food.

Don't think this pathetic, but I practically took jobs and moved into an apartment in TriBeCa just so I could be near this place. (Sort of.) The food is great, but the atmosphere is greater. Food first... I quite often get the spicy shrimp (app) and a side of mashed taters (just like an Irish Ma's). But the burgers are amazing and the roasted taters (that they offer with nearly everything) are perfect. They're menu always has a chicken, a fish, a meat and a pasta dish - all vary from day to day. You can never go wrong with their chicken dishes. Always good. If you go there on a pork chop night - get it! If you prefer to intake the calories via the booze, but need a lil something for sustenance, they have nice salads to choose from. I love their cesar salad, but have a really appreciation for their grilled shrimp on mescalin. The atmosphere... Ok, well there are plenty of bars out there who can throw together their atmosphere to look like a boat house or a hunting lodge or a pub of old Ireland. The Ear is special, tho. The place is the past, quite liter tally. The decor (if you even want to use that fancy a word to describe it) hasn't changed much since it's time as a boatman's bar. Did I mention that they pour the best beer in town? And the bartenders are really great people. Wait staff are also total sweetness.I think one of the best things about the place (which unfortunately the suits have picked up on over the years) is the outdoor seating. A nice little grandfather clause allows Ear patrons to have their frothy ales and hardy stouts outside.

335,JoMRSUPRYx8kEAOSrFRXRg,nate r.,4.0 star rating,"One of the Ear Inn's most important assets is the barstaff, who, as soon as you sit down, insist that you have a drink.  This works well because with a small draft selection and the 5 bottle choices displayed, you should be able to make your decision in the amount of time necessary to order at McDonalds.  Previous reviewers mention wine so I'll assume that's also an option, but the Ear Inn isn't really a wine-drinking kind of place. While I know that food's on the menu and many reviewers have treated primarily as such, I still regard the Ear Inn as a drinking establishment cum restaurant, much along the lines of Melon's. It's similarly timeworn (to be fair, Much more so: it's been here since the 1817) and from what I can tell, attracts a similarly regular crowd. And it's in a gorgeous federal-style house.  As the Hudson is in plain sight outside the doors, there's a nautical theme. I gather that this was a sailor bar for most of its history and really does a remarkable job of maintaining this feel. The huge functional cleat outside the door bespeaks authenticity that's lacking at, say, the Rusty Knot or the Anchor. Notably, there's also a massive ear affixed to the wall.  On a somewhat tangential note, its seafaring proclivities didn't deter the crowd of bikers who, on a recent Tuesday, made the Ear Inn the only ""biker bar"" I've visited in Manhattan, and the only biker/sailor bar I've seen anywhere. As a bar, it's a better choice than the other options in far-west Soho and worth a visit if you're near.",The Ear Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

342,sVDTwDA5enROIYiQsM4Pog,Amy S.,4.0 star rating,I wouldn't call the Ear Inn a dive bar but for some reason it feels like one. I find that to be a good thing. The clientele here kick ass (maybe litter ally most of them are bikers in the summer) and I am really impressed with the burgers. The place had a gritty feel but is actually quite clean and great place to have a rocking one-on-one with an old pal.,The Ear Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional)"
343,Vo0ON2E7SOsr8ek0pz_mCQ,Charlie D.,4.0 star rating,"This is a great little place to get a drink or a good pub meal. One of the oldest bars in New York, it really gives the feel of a dusty Irish pub. You can sit outside in the summer which is cool, but be aware that motorcyclists frequent this place, at least on Thursdays. It's cool if you like bikes since they park them right out front, but it gets a bit crowded. The food is good, and perhaps a bit underrated, too. Great burgers and sandwiches, but don't hesitate to order something slightly less run-of-the-mill. Anything that seems distinctly Irish or English--like Shepherd's Pie--is bound to be good. Great beers on tap like Sierra and Boddington's and the taps are kept pretty clean. It's reasonably priced, but not necessarily cheap. Definitely worth the stop if you're in the area.",The Ear Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

349,2N-4TniG6zy1LyIo2kXF1A,Brigitte W.,1.0 star rating,Have never been treated in such a disrespectful way!!! I met here with 2 friends just before 6pm on a Sunday evening to get a couple of drinks and some food before a movie premiere. We talked to the bar tender who told us that we could sit anywhere so we picked a table in the front. After 15 minutes without service (not even water - it was 95 degrees outside) we tried to get the attention of one of the waitresses who were busy chatting to a customer at the bar. More and more people started walking in and sat down in the back. The 2 waitresses started taking orders and tried the best to ignore us. A lady sat down next to us and got the menu right away. My friend asked her if we could order something (at that point we've been waiting for more than 25 minutes). Without saying anything she stared pulling the paper cloth from the table. I asked her if something was wrong and she almost shouted back saying that the table wasn't set up for dinner and that we had to move which we subsequently did. After another 5 minutes she gave us the menu. We said that we were ready to order which she ignored and ran away again! I was already steaming but I didn't want to disappoint my friend who had recommended the restaurant. So I suggested that we could order a drink at the bar and sit outside. The bar tender poured us drinks and I gave him my credit card. He asked me if I had cash. When I denied he said that there was a 2 Dollar charge for credits cards which I've never heard about. I should have walked out but paid and didn't leave a tip. Shame. Will never ever go back and would never recommend this place to anyone.,The Ear Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

It's like you've stepped into a movie set of a 'New York' place. Yeah, it's a dive-hole, but that's part of the charm. I feel like there's a good enough mix of the locals, tourists, outsiders etc. to give it up a thumbs-up.
