The the cashier yells my name, I say here and he hands me the sandwich I thought the kid just made. So I stop and askIs that mine? I ordered chicken??? They both say yes that's the ""Nunzio"" so I left with itGet back to work, open it up and it's turkey WTF???So I look on the menu and I realized that they don't even have turkey on the menu in any formNo time to go back I eat my $12.52 turkey sandwich So my review is ""you guys are idiots""Straight up bullshiting idiots And the turkey tasted like nothing So I'm giving you 1 star because that's the lowest I canAnd Al ""Capone"" died from complications from syphilis , not a great name for a sandwich place",Cappone’s Salumeria,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Sandwiches"

Located right in Chelsea Market, this place is one of the many places one can go to enjoy a casual bite on the way to the High Line. I came on a weekday lunch looking for a good sandwich. Ordering was fairly fast, but it took me a good 10-15 minutes to get the final product. When ordering, be aware that the specialty breads that they offer come at an additional cost; they tagged on an additional $1.50 for semolina bread without letting me know. My Salvatore without cheese was good. The sliced chicken cold cuts were delicately moist, while the semolina bread was fairly fresh and chewy. The oil,  vinegar, and arugula added a delicate tang to each bite, which melded well with the moistened sweet peppers. Although the sandwich was made well, I couldn't justify it with the price I was slammed with. Perhaps I'll come back here if I'm in a particular pinch, but I'll be looking at other shops around the Chelsea Market for lunch options.",Cappone’s Salumeria,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Sandwiches"

6,PNnKKuWTvG3PP13kynKPLA,Arlene R.,4.0 star rating,Was really in the mood recently for a meatball parm sub but wasn't really having luck finding a place to get one.  I mean I know I can stop by any local pizza shop or order from some frou frou italian restaurant nearby but I couldn't decide on a place to go. Went to Chelsea market to walk around and see what peaked my interest and stopped at Cappone's. The sandwich list is awesome with tons of varieties of typical Italian subs. As I'm perusing the menu I look at their counter and lo and behold....they were offering meatball parm sandwiches that day!  I ordered one and took it back to my desk to eat. First off it's a pretty big sub so I only ate half.  It was amazingly delicious. It could have used an extra meatball in there but this is me just being greedy.

Normally this would be the death nail to any restaurant but this place scores major points in other areas.  The cashier as all the guys working there were super nice, and they accepted my credit card without a problem.  If I had to do it again I think would go with the chicken cutlet they ha on display that was topped with bacon.   Never reject bacon.All the sandwiches are made with care, although this really slowed down the hole process.  They wrote your order on a paper bag and hand it to the guys making the sandwiches who definitely take there time making the sandwiches.  All the cold cuts are in a refrigerator rhomd them and they would take out one meat, place it in your sandwich, put it back in the fridge, take the next one, put it on your sandwich.....you get the idea.... It wasn't exactly efficient.  It seemed like they were new so this will probably improve.  It appeared as though all the tomatoe sauce and pesto were all home made.  Although you should expect to pay $10+ for all the sandwiches This place takes time to include quality ingredients, so I am open to giving it another shot.",Cappone’s Salumeria,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Sandwiches"

I got the Salvatore with roasted chicken breast, provolone, roasted peppers and arugala.  It was fine but not as good as it shoudl've been, especially at this price.  The provolone was a basic cold cut, not a sharp provolone like I thought it would be; I probably wouldn't have order it if I knew this.  The chicken was alright but I was expecting something sliced thicker and hot rather than them turning it into a cold cut.  The roasted peppers were good for what little there was of them.  The bread, which they pride themselves on baking every morning, wasn't anything special.  As a whole, this was an alright sandwich; again, it was not bad.  It just was overpriced, skimpy and not worth the trouble.I wasn't even full after eating this.  Put more stuff on your sandwiches, guys.",Cappone’s Salumeria,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Sandwiches"

Great! After an hour had gone by, I called Cappone's. I was greeted by a woman on the other end of the phone who proceeded to scold me, saying they'd ""just been there, trying to buzz in and calling over and over again"". I informed her that I had not received one call, nor any 'buzzes in', and she told me that my phone ""MUST be on silent or something, because I MEAN...."". I said ma'am - my phone is not on silent, I have been waiting patiently for my order this entire time. She then read my phone number back to me, which they had gotten incorrect. I double-checked that my phone number was entered correctly into Seamless (it was) - so they had somehow written it down wrong (I didn't mention this over the phone). I calmly told her the correct phone number - and she slammed down the receiver. The food came half an hour later - 100 minutes after I ordered it. I was scolded and spoken down to by both the woman on the phone and the delivery guy, because they failed to write down my phone number correctly. Apparently this is my fault.

The guys working here are very friendly and are happy to accommodate extras or substitutes to your sandwich. I had a mozzarella tomato basil and salami sandwich which was AHmayzing. It was huge and great value. Sandwiches are around the $10 mark.,Cappone’s Salumeria,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Sandwiches"

52,r6zDMVAoi_M3dV-jqDXa6Q,Ryan G.,2.0 star rating,"1 Bottle of water + 1 sandwich = $19.85.I've been to a lot of Italian sandwich shops. A first for me was paying $1.50 upcharge (on an already overpriced $14.00 sandwich) for the type of roll I chose. Mind you, this was not some fancy roll with special toppings - just your typical piece of bread. Balsamic vinegar must be a highly priced commodity these days:Me: excuse me, can I trouble you for some extra balsamic on the sideClerk: It's already on the sandwichMe: Ok, thanks. Can I have some extra on the side?Clerk: Oh, you want extra? It's already on the sandwichMe: Ok, thanks. Can I have some extra on the side?Last: when the hands-on clerk (maybe manager?) has a gash on his finger from what appears to be the slicer, I'd recommend using a bandage to cover the exposed wound. Air it out during off-work hours.",Cappone’s Salumeria,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Sandwiches"
53,JidfkpkYUzNS5o9DojNSjg,Luo Qi K.,3.0 star rating,"Nice little place with cool employees! There are a lot of sandwich options, making it difficult for me to choose. My sandwich was pretty good, but I didn't realize my choice of bread would make it more expensive. Altogether, I felt I paid way more than what my meal was worth. The sandwich was pretty regular, so I wasn't really impressed especially since I'd just forked over $12+ for a supposedly $9 sandwich. Ask for the bread prices, I guess?",Cappone’s Salumeria,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Sandwiches"
54,WTK20gSsRnQ-kEx0CKzBXw,George C.,3.0 star rating,"Ordered delivery.com pickup of Deniro (Soppressata, smoked mozzarella, artichokes, arugula) on Whole Wheat for $12.00+tax and arrived to no sandwich being ready and the news that they had no smoked mozzarella. Was given the option to 'come back later' after it was delivered at 'not sure when', and was told twice that they 'tried calling' (from a strange number with no voicemail left). Sandwich was really mediocre, so the smoked mozz would've helped slightly.",Cappone’s Salumeria,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Sandwiches"

56,JRHUDpn0IBOYpwbSJnxMCA,Sam B.,4.0 star rating,The Salvatore is an Excellent sandwich and huge so I don't mind paying the 12$ for it. They also usually have specials some days like chicken parm or meatball parm or eggplant but it's so random and not usually there at noon so I always miss it. It'd be nice if they would post their specials somewhere or do a weekly rotation so you know what days to expect the chicken parm or something.,Cappone’s Salumeria,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Sandwiches"
57,s3AbOgf86YQnswcvUdFOaA,Matthew R.,4.0 star rating,I went with a Nina and subbed the tomatoes for hot peppers. It had at least a 1/4lb of prosciutto and nice thick slices of smoked mozzarella. I didn't really get any smoked flavor from mozzarella but it was good nonetheless. I got the rustico bread which was nice and fresh and crusty. At $14.50 it's definitely a splurge for a sandwich though it's big enough to split.,Cappone’s Salumeria,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Sandwiches"
58,z5R_bi8VEJwgI1Z-rxlfpg,Chris J.,5.0 star rating,What a great place to get a real Italian Hero when there is no spot like this in the vicinity YESSSSSSSSSS. I had the Ernesto with roasted peppers. What made the sandwich stand out from other places was the balsamic glaze. However he made it gave the sandwich some extra moist and Vigorousity! I will be back very soon YESSSSSSSSSS,Cappone’s Salumeria,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Sandwiches"
