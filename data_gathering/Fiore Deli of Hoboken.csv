Fresh bread with fresh mozzarella, huge amount of roast beef and garlic marinated hot peppers and on top of that the whole thing was dipped in gravy. GODDAYUMN!I always thought that nothing beats Faicco's subs @ Manhattan, but I was wrong. Since this place is in Jersey, I believe not that many tourists know about this place, because they (or should I say 'we') usually just hang in Manhattan. But my tip for all the tourists is this: take a 15min NJ Transit bus ride from Manhattan Port Authority bus station to Hoboken, walk couple of minutes from Washington 4th St. bus stop to this place and have The Sub of Your Life.I also need to say that people working there are so nice!

I literally was drooling from the pure smell inside the deli and waiting for my sandwich I almost ate it in the store as we were paying because it smelled amazing and was so garlicky goodness.Turkey with Fresh Motz & Gravy - hubba hubba....sooo good!Prosciutto with Fresh Motz on a hard long roll - amazing!!! Absolutely can not go wrong with anything from here. It was super fresh prosciutto, the fresh motz was chewy and warm still (fresh) and super thick cuts with the roasted red peppers!

You walk in pick out your bread and then wait your turn and hand them the hero and proceed to tell them what you would like to have. The roast beef, mutz, and gravy are awesome.

Note: you grab your own bread from the box, tell them if you only want half and they'll cut it. They have different specials every day of the week. Their mutz is to die for...I could just get a small order of that and snack on it. I also love LOVE their marinated red peppers. They are so  soft and literally melt in your mouth. Even half of the sub is enough for me, even when I'm super hungry. The bread is tasty, but a little hard to eat and it usually scratched up the roof of my mouth. The last time I went, I got the HOUSE ROASTED BEEF with gravy, mutz, and roasted peppers. The wait can get a little long...I think I waited for 20-30 minutes the last time I went.

Prosciutto is amazing and the Italian combo out of this world.They also offer some of the best sun-dried tomatoes and hot peppers I have ever had.Tip: home on a weekday come around 5 usually really empty and get a sandwich, Saturdays can be absolutely packed, but worth it!",Fiore Deli of Hoboken,4.5 star rating,$,"Deliswfftdfvzztzaxqcuvwesssrrqrbsuxbfedbtd,, Italian"

I wouldn't get those again. Can't wait to try some of the other sandwiches. It felt a liiiiiittle pricey to me - $11 for a half size The Figs.

Seriously, it was the best mozzarella I've ever had, and I've had a LOT of good mozzarella! I didn't know it could even be so creamy-tasting.

If my mother was drowning in the Hudson river and next to her was a fresh sandwich from Fiore floating on a piece of driftwood and I could only save one I would jump in and save that fuckin' sandwich.

The bread was nice and chewy just how it should be, the mozzarella was so fresh and had a nice amount of salt and was perfect. The roast beef had great flavor just wish it was a little more rare. The sandwich and place alone was solid solid solid!

You've really gotta go here, that's all that needs to be said, but...A few tips/things to note:- not open on Sundays....not sure why but we all just have to deal with it- they don't take card, cash only...this is becoming a factor that makes me rule out certain restaurants out of spite, but this place is worth an ATM trip.- you pick your own bread from a display case, if you grab the whole long piece of bread instead of the roll and hand it to the guy and get the whole one...that's a double sandwich for $14, half of the long bread is a regular sandwich for $7....this wasn't super clear to us and I accidentally ordered the largest sandwich I've ever seen in my life. I also only had $10 cash on me but the guy was super nice and we worked out a deal where I'd get him the extra few bucks next time I visit, and there will certainly be many 'next time'sHis phrase was ""this bridge ain't worth burning just over a few bucks""- their mozzarella is just insanely good, I haven't even talked about the food yet in this review but it's SO good...stop reading and go check it out for yourselfWhat a great spot with great people!",Fiore Deli of Hoboken,4.5 star rating,$,"Deliswfftdfvzztzaxqcuvwesssrrqrbsuxbfedbtd,, Italian"

They have no tables and is strictly take out. Maybe I am lucky because it was a weekday but it wasn't that crowded. Ordered two sandwiches, my standard prosciutto, mozzarella with roasted peppers and balsamic vinegar. Since it was Thursday I also had to try the roast beef special.  This time it was with smoked mozzarella instead of fresh and gravy served warm.  95% of the time I normally prefer my standard but this time was different. The roast beef was served rare and I never have had smoked mozzarella before. Fiore's is run like a well oiled machine. They have a virtual assembly line for the sandwiches.  I was in and out in 15 minutes. Which was very impressive.  A whole sandwich is approximately 18 inches long and run about $13 each.  Another thing I can mention is that they actually have something really rare in this area....

It's always been my, and my mother's, favorite.This time around my boyfriend (who had never had any Hoboken mozzarella cheese before) and I decided it was time to put the cheese to the test.  I'm sure we missed a few places but we had limited time so we decided to try 5 of the highest rated, longest standing, and most renowned in town.My boyfriend never had fresh mozzarella before, so he didn't even recognize this as mozzarella cheese.  Of course I told him, 'this IS mozzarella cheese. Everything else you've had packaged to date is an imposter.'I think it's important to know exactly what you're tasting, so I recommend you taste the mozzarella in each location by itself PRIOR to/INSTEAD of just ordering it in a sandwich.  The taste by itself will really show you what the mozz is made of.Here's how the tour went and brief feedback for each location's mozzarella. My feedback and ratings (above) are solely based on the caliber/taste of mozzarella cheese, not the quality of everything else they sell or the service they provide.They are ALL in comparison to Vito's since that was my baseline.  Vito's is made fresh 4 times daily.  After tasting some of the best choices in Hoboken, I've come to the conclusion there is simply no better fresh mozzarella cheese in town than Vito's. Or anywhere in the world as far as I'm concerned. It's still my favorite. Stop 1: Vito's: Buttery, soft, warm, wet, salty, and literally melts in your mouth Stop 2: Biancamano: Great mozzarella taste overall, a little chewier than Vito's, nice amount of salt and a little wet from the brineStop 3: Lisa's: Great taste inside, but not salty with each bite on the outside.  Also a bit chewier than Vito's Stop 4: Fiore's: The saltiest of all 5 mozzarellas.  Also was the coolest (temperature-wise) and was slightly chewier than Lisa's and Biancamano 5: Luca Brasi: Coldest (temperature-wise) of them all, nice amount of salt, not too buttery however.  Unfortunately I found the texture to be more like cottage cheese once you start chewing it.*This exact review is posted across 4 different locations on my 'Hoboken Mozzarella Tour.'",Fiore Deli of Hoboken,4.5 star rating,$,"Deliswfftdfvzztzaxqcuvwesssrrqrbsuxbfedbtd,, Italian"

120,bXVIESLhoVcQV0DTUdXCRQ,Julie S.,5.0 star rating,"The mozzarella is everything they say it is. Milky, salty perfection with an ideal texture. Hands down the best I have ever had and worth the drive to Hoboken. We ordered sandwiches and a separate pound of mozzarella. I felt the true flavor and texture of it is better appreciated by itself and gets a bit lost on a sandwich, especially the milkiness. The corned beef sandwich special was delicious with tender corned beef, not too salty like other corned beef I've had. Another sandwich had prosciutto, roasted peppers, mozzarella, and balsamic vinegar. Excellent prosciutto. I preferred each ingredient a little at a time separately, rather than all together, so I could better appreciate each flavor. Had a sort of deconstructed sandwich. The true star, however, is the mozzarella. Do not leave without buying some separate to take home. We were told not to refrigerate it and it will last a day. Or we could freeze it immediately and take it out the day before we wanted to serve it. We did try freezing some and while it still had an amazing taste, the texture was not quite as milky, but still far surpassed other inferior cheeses.The deli itself is very small inside, not like a full deli.  It's mostly about the mozzarella and they offer a few other things to make sandwiches. I did notice calamari or some tentacle like creature on the way out. They also had olives, tomato salad and torrone.Tip: If ordering a sandwich, before you get to the counter grab your desired roll from the bin to your right when you are on line, then hand them the roll to use for your sandwich.",Fiore Deli of Hoboken,4.5 star rating,$,"Deliswfftdfvzztzaxqcuvwesssrrqrbsuxbfedbtd,, Italian"

As a customer and lover of Vito's Deli, I can honestly say that the fresh mozzarella at Fiore's is just slightly better. It was outstanding. The texture and taste were impeccable. I ordered a whole roast beef sandwich which is the special on Saturday. It was HUGE, and this is coming from someone with a hefty appetite. Half the sandwich would have sufficed. They kindly gave me the gravy separate so that the bread didn't get soggy as I was not eating it right away. The roast beef was nice and thinly sliced.

126,GP2dcFSr_8BteRKtY4nGNw,Mark B.,2.0 star rating,"I stopped over for lunch on Saturday and was unimpressed.Decor: It's a standard Italian deli, nothing out of the ordinary. However, I will note that the cabinet that holds the bread doesn't exactly entice one's appetite... it's filthy. Everything else is clean and well looked after, however. The thing that is lacking is seating. There is no where to eat there, at the deli. I got a warm sandwich and, by the time I ate it, it was anything but. Having seating available would allow people to enjoy the sandwich immediately. I ate half at the park and half at home.Bathroom: I am not sure they have one for customer use.Staff: The sandwich guys were all nice and kept to business. There were several regulars with whom they carried on jovial conversations. An older guy, Dominic, helped me and he was helpful to a first-timer like myself.Food/Drink: I had the Saturday special (roast beef w/ gravy) and a bag of chips. The bread, which you pick yourself while standing in line, is a bit on the small side and does not allow for a lot of meat/toppings to be added. The beef itself was great, while still warm, but the gravy wasn't as tasty once it cooled down. It was a fine meal, but nothing I would rave about.Value: The sandwich, which was the ""special"" and bag of chips were much more expensive than I was planning on, and higher priced than other delis in town. Given that the food was nothing special I am not sure where the price premium comes from...This place, all in, is average.

The bread did seem a little old, but that's understandable since it was the end of the day ( hence why I am not docking a star).Let's talk mozz- this was the best creamiest, dreamiest mozz I have ever had! Heaven!Now the star of the show for me were their hot peppers - for me it's not a sandwich without hot peppers. But theses peppers were just AMAZING! They were marinated and perfect! And I dreamed about them for the rest of the week. I definitely would eat a sandwich of just their mozz and hot peppers. Call me crazy.Their meats were great!

138,yAo4v4NackJ7FqKtgbu7eQ,Wilther M.,4.0 star rating,"Background for context (FEEL FREE TO SKIP): Born in Hoboken, raised locally, and went to Stevens (college situated in Hoboken). My ""go to"" for deli has ALWAYS been Vito's Deli on Washington St and 9th. Solid establishment with fresh mutz and conveniently close (mostly) to the ""action"" in Hoboken.One Monday afternoon, I decided to head to Vito's but unfortunately they are arbitrarily closed on Mondays. Alas, I had to find a substitute and Yelp was there to provide one for me. A lot of hooplah on this ""Fiore"" place that I've never really heard of before. I have faith in my Yelp community so I was not so quick to dismiss. ================================================CLOSER LOOK (aka the Juice)This place operates on daily specials but you're welcome to order anything else they might have available. A half sandwich runs $8 where as a whole is $15 - this might be subject to what you order. Point is the half is absolutely the SUITABLE amount for the average man/woman. I ordered a full my second time when I had a monster appetite and was left more than satisfied after half. On a Monday their special is Virginia Ham, Fresh Mutz, and Mustard Gravy. PHENOMENAL! Just a really delicious sandwich. The Mutz was marginally better than Vito's - if not on par. I will concede that their bread is slightly better.Upon returning a few days later, their special was Tuna Salad. I wasn't crazy about the idea so I opted for a Prosciutto, Mutz, and Red Peppers dressed in garlic and olive oil. Sandwich was AMAZING too! COOL POINT: The guy behind the counter offered to give me a sample of their Tuna Salad. I honestly would have been just as pleased with their special for the day. Note: Roast Beef is strictly Thursdays and Saturdays. I was bit disappointed they didn't have Roast Beef (w/ Mutz and Gravy) when I went since that seems to be a big hit, but I was not let down at all by their other sandwiches.",Fiore Deli of Hoboken,4.5 star rating,$,"Deliswfftdfvzztzaxqcuvwesssrrqrbsuxbfedbtd,, Italian"

My friend Jade kept saying, ""Oh my god, this is the best sandwich I ever ate!"" My friend Cleo (a guy), sitting in the back, could not stop raving about how delicious it all was. The sandwiches were large, so when Jade was getting full, Cleo reminded her they'd never get this back home. ""Keep going Jade,"" he said. ""Keep eating! You can do it!""

My boyfriend and I wandered in, and noticed that everyone had a piece of bread in their hands and were waiting in line. So I look to the bin next to me, and assumed we had to pick out a piece of bread (note: there are no napkins to pick up the bread...you just go in there and hope your grimey, flu-covered hands only touch one on your way out). Not only that, but there's no menu. I have ZERO culinary creativity, so I hate to be left to my own devices.

It's a straight up, old school Italian deli that'll give you what looks like high quality cold cuts and cheese. They'll also throw those things together for you in a sandwich. I went for an Italian sandwich with their freshly made mozzarella (might be spelling it wrong, but they refer to it as mutz). In fact, they gave me a very fresh, still warm piece to try when I walked in. I've never had mozzarella like this, it's very milky and extremely chewy. It was a strange consistency to me for cheese, but I definitely liked it and my memory of eating it has grown fonder over time. The sandwich itself was very good, the meat was great and the mutz was delicious with the meat and bread. The bread was also good, but I'd personally have preferred it to be a little softer. Also, I feel the sandwich would have benefitted from a little mayo and maybe a little mustard, but it doesn't look like they'll add condiments.

We were partially right, there was a wait but it was not awful.I had no idea what to order or to expect; they had the specials posted on the window and since the roast beef sandwich appeared on it for two separate days, we decided to go with that.The guy in front of us told us that the sandwiches are huge and a full one is enough to fill three people, so we ended up picking up what I would usually consider to be small buns. The roast beef special comes with mozzarella (of course) and gravy. We went light on the gravy and added some roasted peppers to it. That guy was right, they stuff that sandwich as much as humanly possible, that bun was more than enough to fill up an average sized person for certain. The price was around $8 which is not bad considering how much you get.Now let me get to the important part, the taste: it is amazing. Simply as said, the best mozzarella I have ever had. It was so soft that I felt like I was biting into clouds, very very tasty clouds. The roast beef itself was also good and so was the gravy (I am happy I went light with it because otherwise they dip it in gravy). The roasted peppers were not the best idea because they had lots of garlic on it, and as much as I love garlic, I brushed my teeth and rinsed twice after having it and still felt like i reeked of it.Don't wait over three years to go here, just do yourselves a favor and go!",Fiore Deli of Hoboken,4.5 star rating,$,"Deliswfftdfvzztzaxqcuvwesssrrqrbsuxbfedbtd,, Italian"

165,5Yb0ZMXV1g_wAap78UOvvg,Sandra B.,4.0 star rating,"I don't get the love affair with the roast beef special, people. It was fine. The bread is great, fresh, dense, crusty. It stands up to the sandwich. The beef is good, medium rare and freshly cut. The portion of mozz is generous. I have to disagree with many about their mozz. Maybe I caught them on an off day, but mine was waxy and flavorless, not melt in your mouth buttery deliciousness like many other Hoboken delis. Not enough gravy. The sandwich was just okay. 3 stars for the special.Here's where I give them the benefit of the doubt. Roast beef and mozz is not a great combo. It's too one note. All the flavors are savory and mellow. Haven't you noticed that most places pair roast beef with horseradish to literally spice it up? In philly, we take our roast beef with sharp prov and broccoli rabe, and a side of horseradish jus for dipping. Now that's an in-your-face, haunt you in your dreams kind of sandwich.I gave them the benefit of the doubt with 4 stars, because I refuse to punish the establishment for my bad selection. The bread is good. The sandwich makers are friendly. They kept coming out of the back like a clown car, keeping the line moving at a brisk pace. Everything seemed fresh and high quality. But, as scandalous as this may sound, I would skip the special AND the mozz, and stick to other options.",Fiore Deli of Hoboken,4.5 star rating,$,"Deliswfftdfvzztzaxqcuvwesssrrqrbsuxbfedbtd,, Italian"

203,UJ4ujczT2LNNnW03r7xp9w,Scott F.,4.0 star rating,"So here goes another review of another deli that I am happy to make and that's Fiore Deli in Hoboken. It was my ""first"" and I'll never forget itAn Italian American friend of mine took me there as he was catering our office shindig at his expense (love when that happens!).He promised me me something special. He getting this thing that he kept calling a ""mutz"" and I was like, ""What the hell is a 'mutz'?"" So off we drove to this place that is really a hole in the wall. Had it been a bar I'd have said, ""Dive"". And this place had it's own parking (in Hoboken, this is almost a miracle). Good thing it did.We go in and it's REALLY tight with rows upon rows of product: A glass deli case with meat...LOTS of meats; sausages, cold cuts, etc, bread in racks to pick up to take with you, olive oil cans and such, tomato sauce...mostly (if not all Italian in origin). Who knew that they could pack so much in so small a place? And CROWDED!But the real stuff is in the back...and that'w where you come to when you walk to the rear of the store as you wait, patiently, for your turn.It's where they make the Mutz; the fresh mozzarella. And the sanctum there is protected by part of the counter top that ""L's"" out, and as I recall it, clear plastic or glass with stuff below and treys of goodies (and cheeses).The guys back there were with the white aprons and the talk of people who work with food; you get the italian drift. And they had the mutz. Lots of it. It was being made in the back as we were speaking and this guy, excuse me, ""Dis guy"" looks at us and says ""what'll be be."" My workmate tells him that I've never had fresh mutz before. And the counterman goes in the back, and brings back this slab of white. He puts it in my hand and says to try it.It was so big a piece that I share it with my sponsor. It was that big.And the taste was something I had never had before. Oh, I've had cheeses and certainly mozzarella, I even made home-made pizzas from the crust up for decades... But I had never had FRESH, still warm mutz.Bingo...instant addiction.Along with 3 pounds of warm ecstasy, we bought bread, some sliced prosciutto and other meats to go with the things we already had. That's what Fior's is good and famous for: Deli and their cheese. They make SERIOUSLY good sandwiches and take out.The office party was a success to be sure, but I was hooked. I had to go back and did weeks later. I even returned the favor to my office by bring a similar spread to them as a thank you.To this day, I sniff out places that make their own fresh mutz and check them out (like Fran's here in Hoboken).

I'm completely aware that the fact that TODAY is the first time I've been to Fiore's is an absolute crime, so shut it. I've heard so many things about their roast beef and mutz sandwich that I actually blocked off time to go get this thing. To preface, I'm not a huge roast beef fan; when faced with a police lineup of cold cuts, I'm least likely to single out the roast beef. Fresh mozzarella on the other hand; it doesn't get any better. So when you put the two together, I figure it has to be at least a decent sandwich. Mother of God, decent doesn't even begin to describe it. The combination of beef and mutz works perfectly, and the sauce they slather it in (I asked for it light to be safe) brings out a great flavor. They use thick, house-made mutz and thinly shaved roast beef (not thick slabs). The bread they put mine on was good, but I had no idea you could also pick your own bread when you walked in the door. Pro-tip: PICK YOUR OWN BREAD WHEN YOU WALK IN THE DOOR. Some of those rolls looks amazing. The deli itself is tiny, so expect to wait in line for a while. Unlike Carlo's Bakery, there is some gooooood stuff at the end of this line. Pricewise, well, I ended up getting a whole sub, which clocks out around 16 inches, for $12 (on special).

And oh boy, I regret coming here because now I can't go to a regular JImmy John's or Subway without thinking about how much better the roast beef and mozz sandwich was at Fiore's. The roast beef and mozz is the best deli sandwich I have ever had! The roast beef was super tender. The Mozz stole the show though. You can't find Mozz as good as this in Chicago. The bread was a little harder/cheweier than preferred but all you need to do is use the beef gravy to soften it up and you're golden!The large sandwich is not pricey considering the sandwich is basically two sandwiches and the fact that they LOAD the meat on.

210,ZhRBIEqmRNrh9TLMWzIS6A,Matty G.,5.0 star rating,"Bing Bam, thank you ma'am! Fiore Deli has just earned my first five star rating and it was well deserved.  I don't really have to tell you this and that about the place because the other ninety five reviews all say the same thing. Fiore's is the place in Hoboken to get that awesome sub (hero) that you have been craving. And it might have been the safest place in Hoboken since the whole Hoboken police force was in line behind me getting lunch!Just walking in the door of the deli tells you that these Italian guys know what they are doing. The place has that old Italian deli look and offers a ton of other options besides the subs they make. The first step to getting one is to get your sandwich bread out of the bread cabinet. They offer either a hero roll or a bun roll and if you only want half the hero that is fine, they cut it in half at the counter. Once its your turn at the deli you give them your roll and order what you want on it, and that is no easy choice. I ordered the roast beef and mozzarella, which was amazing. The mozzarella is made right there and if you want some of your own you can order it either by the pound or by the log.They also have chips and drinks to purchase with the sandwich. The price was not bad either and keep in mind that they ONLY take cash. No credit cards and no checks, although I would probably dish out quarters just to get a sub there.Overall I gave this place five stars for the awesome subs, great guys working behind the counter, the price of heaven on a roll, and the nice atmosphere the deli has. I actually did some research on the place and found out that their sandwich was actually in the episode Sandwich Day on the TV show 30 Rock. Personally, I have been searching for years trying to find a deli like the one back home who makes awesome subs and I think I can finally call that search over.",Fiore Deli of Hoboken,4.5 star rating,$,"Deliswfftdfvzztzaxqcuvwesssrrqrbsuxbfedbtd,, Italian"

It always closes early though (6PM everyday and closed on Sundays), so it was always hard for us to pay a visit.  Finally one Saturday, we were heading to the gym, and I was super tired so I was looking for a food truck that supposedly sells the best ice coffee. After driving down several streets, we couldn't find it, but we did stumble upon Fiore's so we decided we might as well go inside.I was wary because some of the reviews on Yelp said their reputation doesn't really live up to the hype. Well, let me be the one to tell you it absolutely does! My boyfriend ordered a quarter pound of fresh ""mutz"" and the roast beef with fresh mozzarella and brown gravy. He unwrapped the sandwich while I dug into the mozzarella. He told me they had just made that batch which explained why it was still warm. I bit in, and it was HEAVEN. It was sooooo creamy and just salty enough. I've never had anything like it, and can't wait to go back. The sandwich was amazing. I don't think I was eating the same sandwich as anyone who said it was overrated. It wasn't dripping with gravy, but it was so moist. I can't even begin to describe it. You need to just taste it for yourself.Needless to say, I didn't go to the gym that day, and I would gladly choose this sandwich over my Saturday afternoon workout any day.",Fiore Deli of Hoboken,4.5 star rating,$,"Deliswfftdfvzztzaxqcuvwesssrrqrbsuxbfedbtd,, Italian"

The service is always friendly, the sandwich tasty, and you have to love that they have a parking lot. The mozzarella is clearly one of the best in Hoboken, and they're always liberal with it. I docked the place one star for not taking a credit/debit card,  the decrepit interior-which really could use an update, and the fact that they don't deliver. I'm sure purists will decry me for wanting to change a Hoboken institution, but man, with lines out the door you'd think they'd have a little cash to toss back into the store.Top tip: the roast beef may get all the attention, but the sausage sandwich is far and away my favorite.

And maybe it's just me, but I love how you can pull apart their mozzarella piece by piece... Something that doesn't really happen with store-bought or older mozzarella. Tip: Call in your lunch order during the weekdays. If you don't, you'll spend your entire lunch break waiting in line squished against several strangers.

I was kinda confused how to proceed at first, as some reviews mentioned having to pick out your own roll. I sorta just stood there until someone was free to help me. I simply ordered the de facto favorite around these parts - roast beef and mutz w/gravy.The guy behind the counter (really friendly, btw) asked me if I wanted a whole or a half. Not knowing the sizes, and feeling a bit hungry, I ordered a whole. The sandwich itself wasn't much different than what you would expect: roast beef, fresh mozzarella, and a gravy spread that was really tasty. The whole is actually the size of 2 moderately sized sandwiches, and was about $11 (not sure if that was a special price, as Thursday's special is the r. beef with mutz). The verdict? Tasty. I didn't have any visions of the second coming of Christ, but it was definitely pretty good. In the future I'd probably try something else out, but I'm glad I finally got a chance to eat here.

251,s7napVJfprMMlr0xGklA4g,Alex g.,5.0 star rating,"This is not a deli! This is your quintessential Italian-American salumeria. It is rumored that Fiore's fresh mozz was shipped regularly to Ole Blue Eyes in L.A. The bread comes from a bakery in Jersey City, whose name I can't remember. The salumi are fresh and perfectly cut for your sandwich or to be wrapped. I've been going to Fiore's since I was wearing diapers. That's over 35 years. Even when I moved to the suburbs in Bergen County, my family and/or I would take the ride to get boiled ham, prosciutto di parma, mortadella con pistacchio, a variety of salami, mozzarella (correctly pronounced ""mutz""), ricotta fresca, and much more. For at least 30 years, I've been getting ham and mozz sanwiches, giardiniera (pickled veggies and olives), and ricotta fresca for pasta con ricotta - the Italian version of Mac & Cheese. And, no ordinary pasta! You must get orrecchiete. You can also get the pasta there, it's near the slicer. Although I've only had it once, the Roast Beef & Mozz is delicious. So good that the line wraps out the doors and there are additional people behind the counter making the sandwiches.TIP: Fiore's is traditional. You won't find any yuppie, hipster, trendy-ass sandwiches named for movie characters, celebs, athletes, or other stronzi di merda. You ask them for a sandwich with cold-cuts and cheese, that's you get. Simple! Just like it was in 1913!If it's a beautiful day and the temperature is perfect, then get there before 12:15 -  especially on Roast Beef days. Otherwise, you'll spend your lunch hour on line. That's how damned good it is!Oh! And, I'll make you an offer you can't refuse. If you want a recipe for Orrecchiete con Ricotta Fresca, then e-mail me before you go.

I brought it to the counter for the eager deli/meat slicer guy to make. I told him I wanted the Roast beef with Fresh Mozzarella with gravy. It was a huge sandwich which I split into two meals, even tho I could have ate it all but wanted to thought it be too much for my fat ass. Words can't express the taste of this when you night into the roll, plenty of tender roast beef and the mozzarella is amazing. I need to go back just to buy that for my family.

Not to say that all of their specials aren't absolutely fabulous... but there is just something about that roast beef, paired with their fresh homemade mozzarella and all that delicious gravy ... Man I tell you, there isn't too much better than that. And as the sign above the cash register reads 'The taste of a good mozzarella is remembered long before the price is forgotten'... such is true here at Fiore's. I am actually a big fan of the virginia ham and mozzarella with mustard sauce special... amazing. Their cherry tomato and mozzarella salad is also to die for as well.I remember when I first moved to town, I had something against Fiore's. I felt, I don't know, like I wasn't part of the 'in crowd' here. I mean... I walked in, didn't see the menu, everyone else seemed to know what was going on but me. And I""m not lying when I say there were a few times I actually pretended like I was just looking around, only to turn around and run out ... the whole time telling myself that I 'obviously didn't even want that food there anyway', ending up at good old faithful Subway, and a fake feeling of satisfaction.I know. That may be just a little dramatic. But, after just going on in, and simply asking at the counter, I found my fears were a little more than ridiculous, and that these men were actually all very nice, and very willing to inform you of specials and anything else you may need to know. That was when Fiore's became my favorite sandwich shop in Hoboken. Well, that and the fact that it is literally right next door to my apartment.

I also recommend the roasted red garlic peppers. My second favorite sub is turkey, mozz, the roasted red peppers and oil. Also amazing. If you visit Hoboken, you absolutely have to go here. Its one of those old-school type places that all the locals love, but they're very friendly to visitors. First time I went in there, they were very understanding that I didn't know their procedure (you get the bread from the bin when you walk in and hand it to the employee when you give him your order).

Cons: the sandwich itself was meh. The jus had way too much soy sauce. The bread was a bit hard.

One thing I would suggest is to get the gravy on the side. It's an entirely different experience to dunk the sandwich into the gravy.I'm hooked on this place.

337,XRuMP1B60X4QYR0I3Bd_gA,Lady O.,2.0 star rating,"For the last few months, my brother and I have been embroiled in a Hoboken Hoagie-off between Fiore's and Vitos, the two most famous deli's in the area, both know for their house-made mutz (mozzerella) and sandwiches (aka grinders/hoagies/subs/heros) in general. Here's my take:Pro Fiore's-It's wayyyyyyyy closer to home than Vito's.-When you walk in, you can choose your own loaf/roll of fresh baked italian loaves, and therefore dictate the size of your sandwich. (This also drastically affects the price, but I'm not sure by how much due to the lack of menus.)Con Fiore's -There's no menu aside from the daily specials. Don't get me wrong, I like creativity when it comes to food, but a menu sets a ordering guideline of what's available/possible - without one, I just felt lost upon entering, and hence decided to stick to the hot roast beef + mutz, and a very basic proscutto + mutz + sundried tomato. -The gravy for the hot roast beef + mutz is more of a au jus dip than a true gravy. Ordinarily, I wouldn't care, but since it's so thin it soaks *INTO* the italian bread and ruins, versus compliments, the sandwich's texture - cause now everything is all soggy.-The proscuttio is stringy and oddly sweet; though I'm no expert, IMHO this is sign of an inferior cut of pork being cured with nitrates and additives. Proscu should be slightly nutty, not greasy with white chunks that get stuck between your teeth.-The mutz in the sandwiches tasted unsalted. Which would have been great if I'd requested that - but I didn't.Sorry Fiore's...you may have won the battle over distance, but you lost the war in taste and price.",Fiore Deli of Hoboken,4.5 star rating,$,"Deliswfftdfvzztzaxqcuvwesssrrqrbsuxbfedbtd,, Italian"

I tried going on a Friday evening around 5pm after getting home from work and unfortunately they were sold out of all the tuna options. Yesterday I decided I would give it another shot. I got there around 11am and the line was only a few people long. I got the Saturday special with roasted red peppers. It was absolutely amazing. I can't wait to go back and try other sandwiches and also pick up some of their hot pepper poppers and other anti pasta items. By the time I left at about 11:15am, the line was already out the door and starting down the street so definitely get their early. Also it's cash only, but they are more than willing to make sure you stay under whatever cash you have if you are buying multiple items (as the person in front of me was).

Even living here for the past year and a half, I can't stand the Jersey Shore meat-heads that come up here and the same ""Bar & Grill"" that pops up on every street corner.  My heart belongs to NYC.Nonetheless, there are a handful of places that are Phenomenal with a capital P in this little square-mile shindig of a town. #1 is FIORE'S.  A real Italian Deli.We live right across the street to this heavenly spot of fresh mozzarella and Italian meats and I'm surprised we haven't gotten fat yet (well, the pants are slightly tight, but that's what a good run is for).  The wait could be well over 30 mins during peak lunch hours (12p - 1:30p) any day of the week. Cars are double parked all along the street just for FIORE'S.If you had one sandwich - you have to try the Roast Beef, Mozzarella, and Gravy Sandwich special on Thursdays and Saturdays.  Rather than that, the staple Salami and mozz is good.  I tend to stay away from the provolone, because they put CHUNKS of that salty goodness in there (which my husband likes).  Beware - if you ask for lettuce, tomato, mayo or anything else besides Roast Peppers and Sundried Tomatoes (the only 2 things you can add), you'll get the ""you kiddin' me?"" look, then you'll have to rescind, take your sandwich and leave in embarassed shame (didn't happen to me, but to a friend - but she still comes back!).The also sell dried salami as well which is always good to keep around for Wine and Cheese pairings on a quiet Friday evening..",Fiore Deli of Hoboken,4.5 star rating,$,"Deliswfftdfvzztzaxqcuvwesssrrqrbsuxbfedbtd,, Italian"

Fiore's is a deli that makes straying from Washington all the more worth it. This can be a pretty intimidating place if you don't know what you're doing. As some of the more bitter reviewers pointed out, this isn't the type of place where they list a menu of items, unless it's a special. But don't let the passionate localism scare you. The guys in here were nice enough and they know how to make a good sandwich. The only thing you really have to know is to go to the bread bin and pick your bread then go to the counter to tell them what you want on it. If you get there too late sometimes they run out of bread and then that's all she wrote. Word on the street is that this is the joint that the show 30 Rock based its ""sandwich day"" episode on. This place is known for it's fresh mozzarella made daily. Whatever you get, you want to make sure you get something with fresh mozzarella. On occasion, an underbelly big shot will stroll in and buy up their entire stock of mozzarella. I had a classic Italian hero with prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, and their special garlic roasted peppers. Although the meat wasn't as plentiful as most good deli's, the sandwich was the size of two sandwiches. It also came with a bit of a hefty price tag at $14.50. I have to say, as tasty as this sandwich was, I thought Vito's on Washington street slightly edges this place out, plus you're only paying $8.95. I also thought the mozzarella at Vito's was a bit tastier. Everybody has an opinion. Stand down, Fiore lovers. Stand down. Let's not get too worked up.

We came on Friday, so they weren't offering the roast beef, mozzarella, and gravy sandwich but Vinnie offered the Italian tuna salad made with olive oil, balsamic vinaigrette, tomatoes, etc. which was unlike any tuna salad we'd had.Good thing that we came when there weren't a lot of customers because we dawdled for a bit, calling our friends to explain that there weren't roast beef sandwiches on Friday and did they want tuna. Then, we took some time picking the loaves of bread that he'd make our sandwiches with. Yum! The loaves of bread are long, and even cut in half, the sandwiches are a good size. My friends couldn't finish them. We had to pay in cash and neither of us brought enough. Did I say that our sandwich maker was patient? He directed my friend to the nearest ATM so we could take our sandwiches home. Happy ending! If I lived in the area, I'd want to be a regular. Another customer in a bike helmet came in after us and asked, ""Hey Vinnie, how much is this?"" Vinnie replied, ""Not much!"" then gave the price.

While waiting on line I watched deli men prepare the food. First, I observerved that none of the preparers were wearing plastic gloves. They were making the roast beef sandwiches with their bare hands and dipping the sandwiches and their hands into the au jus. Over and over again I watched all the preparers do this. 5 or 6 guys dipping their hands in the au jus. They used those same hands to prepare all the different deli selections. It was noon so there was a crowd. Not once did I see these guys wash their hands. They went from meat, to vegetable, to cheese foods, to wet foods without a moment's thought of cross contamination. Then an old guy, who I'm told is one of the owners, was busy at the meat slicer making a sandwich while coughing a most productive and phlegmy cough. Not once did he stop and cover his mouth. This guy shouldn't have been working with that cough. It is 1/24/13 and we are in one of the biggest flu epidemics the NY/NJ area has seen in years. I felt like throwing up and walked out and will NEVER return. These people are disgusting and should be ashamed at themselves for the lack of hygiene. Really people, the food might taste good, but I dare you to watch them prepare it, and still eat what they're serving up.

The roast beef sandwich is heavenly. One of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The bread is awesome, mozzarella is delicious and the roast beef is awesome....no fat and super moist! My second favorite sandwich there is the Italian Tuna which is made with balsamic vinegar...no mayo. Thursdays and holidays tend to be very busy after 11:00am.

The mozzarella is like nothing I've ever tasted, so moist, so flavorful. The daily specials are some of the best creations on Earth. Roast beef gravy and mozz on Thursday's and Saturday's, Italian Tuna on Friday's, Sausage and Red Gravy on Wednesdays. The meat is also extremely fresh and the only drawbacks are that the only toppings you can get are hot or sweet peppers, and sun-dried tomatoes.

370,dZP-zilhPyWzFfGZkVjDDg,Anthony A.,5.0 star rating,"The Hot Roast Beef & Mutz here can hold it's own with the heavyweights in NYC (see DeFonte's and Salumeria Biellese). This special sandwich is the sole basis for my review. The Mozzarella is as good as everyone proclaims and they are using high quality bread from Hoboken's famed Marie's Bakery, which that well known local epicure Sinatra was known to patronize.After you hand the counterman the bread that is hand selected from the bin near the store entrance, some house made rare roast beef is then thinly sliced and topped with the aforementioned Mutz. It is then taken into the back of the store and ladled with oniony jus. Superlatives do not do the sandwich justice. You will probably suffer bite lacerations to your inner cheek at some point in the carnage as your salivary glands kick into overdrive. Once the bloody roast beef  commingles with the creamy Fiore Di Latte, it causes a sensory overload that you tend to overcompensate for by gnashing your teeth furiously, so you can fill your mouth with more milky, meaty, bloody goodness and keep the rush going. This is how eating accidents take place. Be prepared for a couple of day's worth of Hydrogen Peroxide rinses after consumption.The sandwich is only served 2 weekly and draws lines out the door from Jersey locals and our NYC brethren as well.Get there early before the daily specials sell out.Cinco Estrellas for"" The Sandwich"".",Fiore Deli of Hoboken,4.5 star rating,$,"Deliswfftdfvzztzaxqcuvwesssrrqrbsuxbfedbtd,, Italian"

This isn't a typical deli either.  Yes, you can get processed sliced ham or turkey breast on your sandwich, but that's a sure sign you are not a local.  Stick to the special of the day (especially the roast beef and gravy) or get plain muzz with sundried tomatoes, balsamic and garlicky hot peppers on a half stick from Dom's coal-fired brick oven bakery.  It's simply the best sandwich ever.",Fiore Deli of Hoboken,4.5 star rating,$,"Deliswfftdfvzztzaxqcuvwesssrrqrbsuxbfedbtd,, Italian"

The freshest ingredients possible - bread made only a few blocks away and delivered several times throughout the day - mutz made on site - best in all of NJ - the real star here is the freshly made roast beef, mutz and brown gravy jus - only available on Sat and one other weekday - the sandwich is simply bonkers and you will be licking your fingers for hours after you're done eating it. Weekday sandwich specials are AMAZING - home made meatballs with mutz, home made sausage with mutz, etc. Skip the turkey and American and get yourself a ""real"" Italian sandwich with every cured imaginable - and top it off with the garlic roasted peppers.
