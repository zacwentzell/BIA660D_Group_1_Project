9,gX3GV7sYm3QlPasge-bBbA,Caitlyn G.,3.0 star rating,"Honestly, my boyfriend and I came just because we saw that this place had the ""biggest slice of pizza"". Jersey is known for its pizza places though, so we wanted to see what this was like. Benny Tudino's is located in busy Hoboken - so of course parking will be somewhat difficult. The parking is metered street parking where you'll pay at a kiosk. Interestingly enough, I wouldn't have expected this to be a pizza place based on the front of the business. It looks very nice outside with outdoor seating and flowers. But then again, there's huge writing that says ""Home of the Largest Slice"". The interior also doesn't look like a pizza place. When you walk in, it sort of does look like a pizza place, but the back is a different story. It's very nice in the back of the restaurant.As for the food, I'll just keep it short. We looked at the menu which had a lot of items. I didn't really know what to choose from. However, this place is known for the largest pizza slice, so there wasn't really a difficult decision. The price is pretty good for $3.50. The slice is definitely big. I was happy with the quantity. Quality-wise, the pizza is somewhat average, but the cheese does taste good.

11,xDYiNmKTDNL8RULdtvFoOQ,Ali W.,4.0 star rating,"Benny's really is my favorite place to pick up pizza out of any other place. So, as for the pizza itself, it tastes like any other normal pizzeria around the area. I just love the bigness of it. I love going by the waterfront view with some delicious aesthetically pleasing huge slice of pizza. My family loves this place as well and I'm always happy to go here. When ordering the pizza pie I like to ask for it to be a little well-done. A crispy exterior makes it 1000x better. If you're a real foodie, and not some fake mediocre pizza-lover, you will realize some inconsistency when only picking up a single slice. I guess the bigness plays a role in them not having a perfect pizza every time. Sometimes it can be under-cooked, sometimes too well and sometimes just right. That's why I always get a pie and ask for it to be well-done.I do gotta say, the gentlemen behind the counter can be kinda rude and arrogant. Maybe they're just going through something outside of work that effects their mood at work... idk I'm trying my best to look beyond that flaw. Servers have also been rude in the past asking my cousin if she was done taking pictures because the server mentioned she was supposed to serve the slices on our plates. A 5 year old can do that; you can leave with that attitude. I only dine out now; I'm not dealing with that at all. 0 tolerance for rudeness towards my family. Please keep in mind, as an ex-server I'm overly kind and generous to my fellow waiters or waitress's, but that really annoyed me.",Benny Tudino’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$,Pizza

However it doesn't deliver well.  I don't get it.

13,QlGSIokpsceDwzL4B05RVg,Dave N.,4.0 star rating,"A lot of this place does come from the novelty of claiming the biggest slice. Overhyped it may be, but it never failed the bar of a NY-style slice, let alone one that spans two plates. I've had only one other slice that big, and for $3.50 I got what I expected.It's pretty much what I expected. With the giant pizza comes the stereotypical attitude - plenty of stares and you're never quite sure if they're getting your order or the one for the guy next to you. But you'll get every bit of gooey, cheesy, greasy bite of pizza that you'll want. That being said, it wasn't perfect - I was so confused by two bites of pure bitter that I realized half my crust was charred to black.I'll chalk it up to a one-time occurrence but that sucked to bring home.Well the pizza's large enough to kill you with a Philly taco from Midtown, that's for sure.

I would say they're the equivalent of two, dollar slices from Two Bros. I actually prefer the Two Bros' dollar slices over this. This pie cost us $35 (half fresh garlic, half mushroom) and it was soggy. Now, maybe this was because we ordered ahead, and the pie had already been sitting for a while.

It was very cheesy - I'ii give you that - but there was NO FLAVOR because of the scant amount of sauce and spices/herbs. There was hardly ANY red sauce on the pie, and the rim was like under baked white bread and a far cry from ""crusty"".

There were a total of five of us and they gave us a booth with an extra chair as there were maybe a total of ten tables in the restaurant and they were all full of diners.FOOD:- BAKED ZITI ($8): Very large portion for $8 which is a very good price and I had a ton for leftovers the next day. The dish was okay. I wouldn't say it's the best ziti I've had. - 10 BUFFALO WINGS ($10): I was surprised by how good these were. We all couldn't stop eating them. It was probably the most memorable part of our meal. We asked for sauce on the side. The sauce is so, so good and addicting. - CHEESE PIZZA (price by slices): really huge, huge slices the size of your face! Definitely worth the price. Super cheap for such a large slice. My friends enjoyed their pizzas. I didn't get to try it so I don't really have an opinion on it.Service was good. Our server did check up on us a few times.

The prices are cheap I think it's $4.50 a slice but in Nyc you would get a half of that for $3.00+ so I'll take it. I travel specifically to Hoboken to get pizza from here and in the summer I'll get it to go and lay down on the grass near the water. It's perfect. This pizza is seriously amazing.

The front of the restaurant has 4 booths & the back is a small area w/ several tables We waited around 25min for a table. I ordered a slice of mushroom pizza & mussels for an appetizer. We also ordered the eggplant parm with pasta. They claim to be 'the home of the largest slice' - even though it's larger than an average slice of pizza, it is microscopic compared to the 2ft slice at the Pizza Barn in Yonkers. My pizza was surprisingly disappointing. The slice was heated up & raw mushrooms were thrown on top. Not sure why they didn't put the mushrooms on BEFORE they heated it? The eggplant was ""average"" & the mussels were ok. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, considering there are probably 10 other pizzerias on Washington StTotal bill was $35 - CASH ONLY",Benny Tudino’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$,Pizza
52,X07CWfbtv2fDVmyePfVlEw,Tony R.,3.0 star rating,"Reading the reviews you might think the pizza gods had descended on Washington Blvd in Hoboken and took up residence at Benny Tudolo's. In reality, the pizza is just OK. Yes the slices are huge and a great value however if taste is important, then it is at best average. Perhaps ordering a custom pizza might be better. On the positive side the slices are really big (served across 2 paper plates) and are custom in a sense. They take a slice that has just cheese on it and they add whatever toppings you want. But that's where the value goes out the window since it's $1.00 for each extra item. We had a slice with some toppings and it was average.....not bad but no where near great. The Italian salad we had was probably the best item. The Veal Parmigiana alone (no pasta) was $15.00 and huge. However not that tender. The veal was tough but the plate looked great, loaded with cheese and sauce. I think this place might also be better for take out. They have some tables in the back but cleanliness doesn't seem to be high on the list of priorities. The bathroom is disgusting but if you're out with friends and feeling the munchies after drinking, a slice from Benny's will do the trick.

Yes, they still have giant slices that you can put next to your newborn, but the quality seems to have slipped quite a bit of late.We've ordered delivery a couple times and the regular pie just hasn't been that good. I'd say it's average at best, burnt cheese (what little there is), bland sauce and kinda weird crust. We got the special with a calzone and it was just a clump of cheese on top of dough, it wasn't folded close or anything it was just a hot mess. No one would look at that thing and say ""yeah we should definitely send this to a customer"", but Benny's did. We were hungry so we just went with it. When you call they are still pretty rude. I think I may be done with the biggest slice in Hoboken and stick with places that are the most edible slices in Hoboken.

We ate 3 slices and took home the rest. The avocado salad was pretty good (huge portion of it too!). They packaged up the leftovers pretty well by taking each slice and plating them before putting them into the box so they won't stick together.

Yes they have been around for ages but I am sure not everyone who works there has been around as long. Although the pizza is good it could be great if they were more consistent with how the pizza is cooked. The sauce and cheese is always good but the dough can be undercooked at times. Not sure if that is due to inexperience in the cook or a new fad of pizza. Either way the fact of the inconsistency leaves less to be desired. Simple fix make sure to ask for your pizza well done then your pizza will be worth the trip to this old school feel of a great generation of pizza artists.

74,GATPiuNV4brnGDQs_DZrhw,Michael H.,3.0 star rating,"I stopped in on a heavy snow day because it was recommended by a colleague.Food: I ordered a large pepperoni pizza for take-out. I thought the pizza was good and tasted good even after it was reheated the following day. The pizza sauce in particular had a sweet hint to it that made it more memorable. I am not sure if they put some sugar in their pizza sauce but it was good. Can't say it is the best pizza, but was certainly enjoyable. I still give the title for the best pizza I've ever had to Star Tavern. Service: It was a busy day for delivery so the service was slow. I understood the circumstance so it didn't bother me.Con/Tip: At this point, I assume most places take credit cards, especially when they take it online. I learned that they take it on delivery.com but not in the restaurant. They defer you to the ATM machine that charges you an additional $2.50, which goes to the restaurant. That effectively increased the cost of my pizza. Normally, I walk to my bank's ATM but with the snow I decided to eat the cost. In a progressively cashless society, I find this to be outdated and inconvenient. Overall, the pizza was good but it wasn't enough to go out of my way to get their pizza. I'll likely stick to Hot House Pizza because it is closer and they take credit both online and in the restaurant.

For all I know, my pizza may have fallen into his litter box and that's why they were trying to get rid of it, but in the end it tasted fine to me.For that one bad experience, I've had many, many positive experiences, which keeps Benny T.'s as my #1 pizza spot in Hoboken.",Benny Tudino’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$,Pizza

The pizza is consistently big, under cooked, and tasteless.The service is consistently awful, and at times aggressive; The people behind the counter and the waiter/waitresses are consistently rude, uncaring, and seem to forget they are the face of a business. The people here (who seem to be more or less the same crew since i was a child) have somehow fooled the population of Hoboken into supporting their business. It seems people have forgotten how much they jacked up their prices in the time span Hurricane Sandy tore Hoboken up. Disgusting business practice.

Coming here we scored parking right in front of the place, how awesome was that? We went on inside and I saw the slices and realized that me and my pizza loving daughter would most likely be able to split one. After eating there was a second I thought I would have to get another one tho lol. The pizza was awesome. Slices good and BIG. They have optional of getting to go or dining in. Have a pretty large menu (i mean, coming from thinking all they had was pizza lol) I could see parking being a pain if you don't get one right there.

Before our slices were done, she came out with our drinks (2 liter coke) and threw the straws at the table. Furthermore, once the pizzas were ready instead of having the decency of giving out the pizza's who they corresponded to, she said ""no, I'm going to leave them right here and you can pass it over.""

Known for making child sized slices, it's too bad they don't have child sized drinks to quench my adult sized thirst. The crab ravioli is not distinguishable from other types of ravioli as it is just swimming in thick red sauce. It could've been any other filling  and tasted the same. A bit of a let down for crab lovers. It might as well have been the ravioli parmigiana which is just plain ravioli. We haven't tried the toppings on the pizza, the slice on its own does enough to satiate your hunger.",Benny Tudino’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$,Pizza

And I know I've had their (takeout) pizza in the past, and it was good. I've had pepperoni pizza, sausage & green peppers, and plain. All good. Thumbs up, Benny.We sat down in the front room, in view of the television so we could watch hockey. Pretty comfortable accommodations, at least until the oven's overhead fan conked out & the room filled with smoke. Oops! But who cares, right? These things happen. I tasted a piece of my fiance's meatball & sausage slice, and it was pretty delicious. Great crust, decent sauce, appropriate amount of cheese. Our fountain sodas were ice cold. The food came out quickly & piping hot. But I still have some issues. Let's talk about your Hawaiian pizza, Benny.Yes, I know. I am Italian, but I still enjoy a Hawaiian slice. Don't look at me like that! Anyway, one of my strong peeves is when the ham is deli-style, not chunk-style. And I'm not even talking strips -- this Hawaiian slice sported some full-sized squares of ham. It almost turns my pizza into an open-faced sandwich, and then I have to try not to drag the entire piece of ham off the slice, leaving a sad doughey cheeseless hole.  The pineapples were not incorporated into the cheese either, and they tumbled about as I struggled to eat my slice without wearing it home.So there you have it. A decent pizza place, with giant, economically-advantageous slices. Strongly recommended -- well, as long as you don't like Hawaiian pizza.",Benny Tudino’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$,Pizza

But I still think Benny Tudino's is a must see experience.  Here's why.1. You will get the largest slice of pizza you have ever seen.  The restaurant even has photos posted of babies next to a slice of pizza, which are about the same size. 2. Quality.  Other posts say that this isn't the best pizza ever, and they're right.  It isn't.  But it also isn't the worst pizza ever.  It's average pizza.  Real crust, real cheese, and baked right in front of you in a pizza oven.  Believe me, I've had the 99 cents a slice pizza in NYC which is really horrible (cardboard crust and fake cheese), but this is the real stuff.  If you don't mind a plain slice, come on in. 3. Entertainment.  I highly recommend you come here sober and just watch as the bar bound crowds pour in.  That, in itself, is worth the price of admission.4. Timing.  I stopped in around 11pm on a Saturday night.  Believe it or not, a lot of restaurants in NYC and Hoboken were closing shop already and were catering to the bar bound crowds.  We weren't too hungry and just wanted a bite to eat to hold us over for a bit, and Benny Tudino's was open and we were quickly served.  Self-seating made it even better.My reco: give it a try.",Benny Tudino’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$,Pizza

The delivery boys for this establishment. Who wants to try to eat pizza when they can barely breathe amongst the perpetual second hand smoke?!I'd understand if they were patrons, but there's no better way to undermine your own business than having your very own employees ruining the outdoor dining experience for paying customers.

After going to an engagement party in the area, my girlfriend and I took a ride to nearby Hoboken. Still being a bit hungry and in the mood for a slice, we decided to stop into Benny's. Upon entering, we were warmly greeted by a hostess and asked if we were dining in or taking out. The inside was bustling with many people and there was no shortage of others coming in to take out. We ordered 2 slices and a coke to take out, which came to $7.50 if I remember correctly. As others have mentioned the slices are the size of a small child. One slice of pizza is easily 2, maybe even 3 slices of normal pizza, but quantity is not the only thing they're known for. As well as being filling, their pizza is also delicious, with a thin crust and a nice sauce to cheese ratio that is full of flavor. It's also a lot of fun to people watch at Benny's, as I saw one guy who was literally wrestling with his slice as he attempted several times to take his first bite using only one hand (a hard feat to accomplish here).

Anywhere. One of our kids ordered Italian sausage on his slice, and instead of the little roundish balls of sausage that you see everywhere, this was long slices of an actual Italian sausage! My husband tasted it and said that it was excellent and has to be ordered the next time we go.  The waitress cleared away our plates and offered fresh plates for us to enjoy our dessert that we'd brought from Carlo's bakery.  I was worried that they would frown on it, but I'm happy that they were so accomodating.  The only downside is that Benny Tudino's is 725 miles from home.   We'll be going back to NJ and NY next summer, sadly, so I'll just have to wait for the best pizza!  Highly recommended!",Benny Tudino’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$,Pizza

So I said, ""where else would you like us to sit?"" She pointed to a table set for 3 that was smack in front of a door. When I attempted to pull it out away from the fence, as she stood there watching me do it, she said it was blocking the door and it wouldn't work. So now I'm pissed. I said where would YOU like us to sit, as the 4 of us ate not going to fit at a table for 3. She then instructed me to move the table over to another table... like, me, physically move it as she stood there and watched.  My level of doneness is all the way on high.

Only reason why I can't give it 5 stars is because the bathroom is always a nightmare trying to use, although tables are clean the place is too clustered. The waiters are awesome and super friendly.

Hoboken is a bit of a dry town when it comes to delicious AND cheap pizza so I go to Benny's for my pizza fix. For $3 you get a baby-sized slice and for a few extra bucks you should pair it with their delicious, just right, non-greasy mozzarella  sticks. Also, grab a Peroni Cerveza (italian beer) while you're at it. The Pizza:I'm all about that dough, man, and I believe that lightly baked dough lets you taste the essence of a pizza. As you can tell by Yelpers pictures, this place is known for their huge slices. Luckily, with the proper technique, Benny's does not serve you a large floppy slice. They've mastered the art of lightly baked pizza, but if that's not your style then just ask them for a toasty one!  The Place:Benny's is like my second home, 1. because I love pizza and 2. because this place is very warm and inviting. It's like a pizza café.... On a chill afternoon, you can grab yourself a booth and just chill out with your slice. They don't try to rush you and all the servers are extremely friendly!

I was planning to buy two big pizzas, wade back into the waters, and help feed others trapped by flood waters. When I got to the front of the line, I was told the following:1. Each slice was $3.2. They don't have change.3. They are selling only ""boxes"" of the pizza for $10 for 3 slices - because of no change.Benny was sitting there, eating and watching his residents shell out $10 for 3 slices of pizza. I fully respect and understand that they have 'huge' slices of pizza and that $3 would be a normal price - but in a crisis wouldn't you think Benny might think about helping the community rather than lining his own pockets? I wasn't getting pizza for myself, I was getting pizza for a building who hadn't had hot water, electricity for over 3 days.I went back to my apartment spending $20 on six slices and then sliced up their pizza into smaller slivers - and handed them out to hungry folks who didn't have power, heat or hot water for the last 48 hours.Benny, you lost a customer for life and should be ashamed of yourself for price gouging during the disaster.P.S.

The line was quick and I got my pizza nice and fresh.Be prepared for how big the pizza is. Their were some pictures of the size compared to a new born baby and anything in the size range of someone's hand to their elbow haha. I won't lie, I did enjoy the experience. PIzza was good, but not really worth the $5. After going throw the end of the pizza I hit a lot of bread and less sauce and cheese. Personally, I like to have more pizza than crust/bread, but that's just my opinion.Bottom Line:I personally think that Benny's is an experience that most people have to experience in Hoboken. Not many places are going t to have pizza the size of a newborn child. The only reason it doesn't get the full 5/5 from me is mainly because of the price I had to pay. I was thinking that the pizza would fill me up, but I definitely needed at least two slices to get full.

DONT ORDER A WHOLE PIE... it just doesn't taste the same as their individual slices.  I made the mistake of ordering two pies for a party.  I told everyone how good the pizza was... We ended up being really disappointed.  The pie was way too greasy and it did not have the same taste.My advice is to skip the whole pies and get a bunch of individual slices.  You will be much happier.Plus this pizza is excellent when eating it cold right out of the fridge the next day.So I give this 4 stars for slices and 2 stars for whole pies.  AVG = 3 stars.,Benny Tudino’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$,Pizza

Deal with it.  Thin crust.  Deal with it.  Greasy.  Deal with it.  Cheesy.  Deal with it.  But holeeee sheeeeyit, best tasting slices ever.  Ever ever ever.  And the size of chalkboards - so huge they use 2 paper plates to deliver it to you.  There's discussion on whether it's the sauce, or the cheese, or the olive oil that gives it their unique flavor, I don't care.  I personally think they bake it for 30 seconds in a crystal meth oven, but that'sa just me.  And they have other italian dishes that I am sure will put you to sleep the instant you close your eyes.  Seriously, the pizza here is the best I have ever had anywhere.  No other place comes close.  Plain and simple, and with the surrounding charm of where you're at, interacting with the myriad of personalities dining next to you, people-watching while you sip on italian beer...  you wish that you could do this every day with every single one of your best friends and family.  That's the feeling this place brings to me, and I hope one day to you too.",Benny Tudino’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$,Pizza

You want toppings on your pizza?  FUGGEDABOUTIT!  You're not coming here for the toppings.  All of their giant slices (except for pepperoni) begin life as a 32"" cheese pie.  Toppings are sprinkled on a plain slice, tossed in the oven for a couple of minutes, and served up.  As a result, the toppings don't get the opportunity to get really incorporated into the cheese. There's little more nostalgic and satisfying to me than a $3 giant slice of greasy, piping hot pizza after a couple of pitchers of beer.. but, wait.. unlike Koronet Pizza, Benny Tudino's Pizzeria has a liquor license!

348,FImJxONflK--UAsl34DVFA,Mari A.,1.0 star rating,"This experience ruined my pre Mother's Day hangout with my mom and my sis. First we walk in and place an order for 6 X-large slices. 3 of them with different toppings and the guy who took the order, looked annoyed bc he either didn't know how to spell spinach or was too lazy to make it. Right before we sit down, he's already trying to get us to pay and we didn't even get the drinks yet. Keep in mind, he looked aggravated that we were going to dine in. I was instantly aggravated. I mean wtf did he think, we were gonna eat 6 huge slices and run for the door?? To be honest, even if that was the case, it wasn't happening bc the entrance and the counter are literally on top of each other and the size of the space is an ant hole. So either way, one of the staff members would certainly catch up to you. My sis said brush it off. So I tried and we finally get the order. Ughhh!!!!! Back to feeling intense aggravation. The presentation looked & was disgusting. We got 3 slices with cheese, 2 slices with spinach and one with onions and he literally opened the spinach can and dumped it on the pizza. The onions were warm bc thank baby J the pizza was a little warmer. Seriously Dik?? Cold pizza?? $35 down the drain. I hate you!!!! I could have brought raw onions from home and saved the additional cost on the topping. I couldn't wait to fly out of there. Luckily, we ate with our eyes bc it looked better than it tasted, so we decided to take the other 3 remaining slices home. Us and our bright ideas. The minute I asked for a paper bag that lazy azz gave me the look of death bc he had to literally turn around and grab the bag, then hand it to me. And brace yourself bc it doesn't end there. My sister asked for a paper bag too and the look he gave her, was twice as vicious. My mom asked us to get her a bag and both my sister and I said NO at the same time. Eff that. At this point, I was willing to throw that greasy, tasteless, slice out anyway. I didn't know if I wanted to kick myself for ever suggesting this place or kick him just to blow off steam. Although my mom had a great night overall, I couldn't shake off this experience. I was so uncomfortable and another customer told me she ate outside just to avoid him bc he was just as rude to her. The guy seemed like he was either a racist douche bag or going through a divorce. Either way, I have lived in hobo all my life & The food in this city can be amazing. Don't believe the hype. Benny's used to be the spot back in the day but now they are just unpleasant in taste, quality, and clearly service. I wouldn't go back if the pizza was free.

If you think NY slices are big, you've got another thing coming to you at Benny Tudino's. The whole pie has about a 3 feet diameter so I'd imagine the slice being about 1.5 feet from tip to crust.

Benny's is awesome if you are in Hoboken and looking for some great pizza. Whether you are looking for a quick slice or are stumbling home, Benny's is solid for anytime of the day.The first two great things about this place are the prices and the portions. They give you a huge slice (one of their slices is considered two normal slices) and they only charge you four dollars for it. I would only bother getting one because unless you can go beyond three plates at a buffet, you won't get past one slice here.The staff is wicked cool and are always happy to help you out. The guys working at the oven always seem to be having a good time when they are not busy busting each others balls. I've never sat in the back where there are waitresses so I can't comment on them.The place itself has that old pizzeria feeling and is covered with pictures of different people from the area. You can choose to sit and eat either in the front, in the back with a waitress, or even outside where you can do either.Overall Benny's gets a well deserved five star rating because of their awesome pizza, cheap prices, huge portions, cool atmosphere and their friendly staff.

If you order a pie, make sure you order the house pie and not just a regular pie. The house pie is the gargantuan sized one that's very filling. Prices per slice went up recently (all around Hoboken not just here), but $3 for the slice is the same as you pay across the street at Giovanni's, but you get about 30% more pizza for the buck.I usually just get my slices plain or at most with Pepperoni.

In fact, I rarely frequent New Jersey at all, but I was in the area with friends about we got really hungry at midnight. Out of all the pizzeria's we passed none of them caught our immediate attention, and neither did Benny's, but for some strange reason all eight of us wound up at this place. After the two cars drove around in the rain for half an hour, (our car got lost for a while, we're from New York) we all eventually met at Benny's, and were seated in the back to a table for eight.From the outside, Benny's looks small, but it's not. Once you walk in you view the extra space that stretches out into the back, up a few steps and into an added room with more tables and people. Our waitress was a kind woman with a patient spirit, so we gave her credit for that, and she took our drink orders and even gave us advice on which pizza pie would be the best and cheapest for all of us. We ordered the ""House Pie,"" which our waitress suggested, and within fifteen minutes we had a table sized, hot, half-cheese, half-pepperoni pizza that made us all water at the mouth.It was a genuine experience to say the least, since I don't normally visit Jersey and see how the people really are. I enjoyed my time with friends, as I always do, and the food added something extra to the whole experience. One friend even mentioned that I should have brought my camera to take photos of the pizza, and I knew it had been a mistake that I had forgotten.

I don't know how drunk a person would have to be to like this place.The untrained, rude staff is ALMOST worth going to see. You can expect to hear them have personal conversations in loud, obnoxious voices using all types of nasty language totally oblivious that there are kids at some tables.I never want to see anyone fired so I will hope instead that the waitress with the unfortunate wrist, forearm and elbow tattoos gets re-trained. In our 15 minutes there, she spent more then half the time texting while on the dinning room floor. I know this is a dive and not fine dinning by any stretch but how does this get allowed?For an extra laugh, take your undercooked grease slab up to the dinning room and watch the nasty glares from the wait staff. They resent you seating yourself there and taking a table away. I can understand that, but then make a no-slices in the dinning room policy and put up a sign. Been there a few times, no more. Quality has gone way down hill. Hoboken should be but isn't a haven for good pizza. It's amazing how bad everyone is, especially this place.",Benny Tudino’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$,Pizza

The second time we came the service was pretty bad. The waitress disappeared and the restaurant was nearly empty. (Don't you hate that?) So I walked up to the counter to pay for our food and the guy behind the counter was extremely rude for no reason. He was looking at me crazy and he was acting like he didn't want to take the money.

How many Famous Ray's are there in Manhattan? I don't know, but I suspect it's four digits. One of the surest signs that New York is the greatest city on the planet is the density of our pizzeria population. But all pizzas are not created equal.There are the legends, of course. This or that shop with an Italian name for extra authenticity. There's that place in the West Village where the guy from the Daily Show yelled at Spider-Man in Spider-Man 2. And there's Benny Tudino's. Other reviews mention the size of the slice. If you're skimming this review, I need you to stop for a moment. Imagine a pizza, twenty inches in diameter. Now, cut it into quarters. That is not a slice of Benny's pizza. Add in a perfect combination of sauce, cheese, and soft but not doughy bread. There. That's the stuff.This is the sort of slice Achilles devoured before laying the smack down on Hector. A single slice of Benny's pizza could demolish the entire UFC. If you're reading this and weird bruises started forming all over your body, it's because you were preemptively rocked by a slice of Benny's. It goes without saying that the pizza is also well-priced. All this ranting would mean nothing if you actually had to pay for three slices when ordering one of Benny's. If this pizza were actually expensive, this would be a far different review, one telling you about my plans to commit arson. But the slices are very-well priced, so the place doesn't get burned down, and I stay out of prison! Yay!I suppose you could order from Benny's without ordering a massive slice. It's possible.

Not just because it was cheap and had really large slices, but because it had quality. To add to that they had a really friendly family atmosphere. I often saw Benny siting next to the front door talking to visitors. A fun fact: he sells a CD with his songs next to the cashier. The pizza was always perfect; never cold or stale.

I've never paid a delivery fee from them so I asked for clarification. Before I knew it they yelled and hung up.

512,cpcF75vIQb2DiQlcHVet-A,George G.,2.0 star rating,"Have been here a few times while attending university in the area and find Benny Tudino's Pizzeria to be mediocre for a few reasons:[Cons]- Pizza quality is average: crust is very thin and there is little oil on the pizza (either means the cheese is poor quality or tomato sauce does not have any olive oil in it).- Poor oven reheat quality for next day leftovers. A good pizza does not come out soggy but crispy on the outsides and gooey on the inside. Usually happens when the pizza was not made with enough dough.- Pizza is over-priced as I can generally get a Sicilian and regular pie for the cost of the Benny's House Pie and 2 of us can eat for 3 days. With the House Pie, its only good for 2 meals for 2 people.- There is no discount given if you buy a whole pie, instead its merely the same cost as buying by the slice. When coming with friends, ensure everyone purchases their own 2 slices and dont get a pie - they make you wait longer until they make it even though there are like 4 of them stacked keeping warm.- Staff is very rude telling people they dont care about their order and to get in line instead. At one point there was no line and they were still yelling at customers to get in line. The customer asked ""what line?"" and the staff said ""then make a line!"". Unbelievable. One time me and a friend challenged ourselves to eat a Whole House Pie between the two of us at a table. The waitress asked us if we were done and wanted the pizza packed after each and every slice we both completed. Think they just wanted to sit more people and get more money.[Pros]- They are open until 1AM when other pizza places are not.- Like stated earlier, pizza is average and could be much worse.- Pizza spices still available to take out patrons despite the busy nature of the place.- Located conveniently on Washington Street.- Late night when they are closing, you can get a stack of slices for a fistful of change (if you are lucky). Did this one time after stumbling drunk following an Alumni event and we had enough pizza for 3 days. Think it cost us less than 5$.To be honest, cant think of too many Pros for this place. Back in the day when 7th Star Pizza had their original recipe and cheaper prices, it was better. Uptown was also better when they first opened up and then they jacked prices, quality fell, and they stopped make pizzas with half/half toppings. Quite happy to have good pizza in Wallington, NJ.

I'd actually get out of my warm bed, flip on the light, and throw my big down jacket over my pajamas.  This was during the winter of '06.  I'd ride down there on my kids BMX bike-- one that was for a 4 foot 6 inch boy which I bought during the subway strike because I was a starving artist and couldn't afford better.  My knees would hit the handle bars if I wasn't careful.  At any given time, I'd have a fair share of Benny Tudino's bruises.  It was worth it.So there I was, riding down the street past those patches of snow at 12:30AM, hands freezing through my gloves and my head thinking about that sausage and broccoli slice that I love so much.  I'd walk through the door and the flirty italian guy'd say ""Hi"" to me like we grew up together and as if he had been expecting me.One night, I decided I would take a break.  I was not going to go, but I was walking by with the friend who introduced me.  He went all the time too, maybe even more than me. I told him that I needed to cut back. I told him that I already ate there the previous night, and that I wasn't hungry.  But then he forced me in (by holding the door open.)  He forced me to order (by asking me what I wanted.)  And then when that huge, hot, slice was put in front of my face, it was like I had a gun to my head.  My friend sat their grinning, knowing his unconsented coercion worked. There I was, once again in a situation that I tried so hard to avoid, one I knew I couldn't handle.  I knew it was bad for me and still I couldn't say no.  And yes, I liked it.  How could I press charges when I had that satiated food coma look on my face. No one would have believed me.  The slice was too big for me, too tasty,  too hot.  Yet I didn't stop, I didn't say no.   And yes, I took the whole thing in my mouth and swallowed.",Benny Tudino’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$,Pizza

If I were a cable producer I would give these guys a TV show before another certain Hoboken baked good establishment.The pizza:I have to say, if this place wasn't insanely busy and popular I doubt I would recommend the place ardently. There's the potential for some lack of attention to detail. I might be worried that I'd be getting some stale product. As it stands, the turnover here is so, that a lukewarm slice of pizza means that it has been sitting for 20-40 minutes instead of 3 hours. The house slices are as long as my sneaker, and I wear a men's size 11 and a half. There are pictures of month old babies next to Benny's slices and they are the same length. You could probably fit two newborns on a house  slice. The flavor of the sauce is right. The dough has been well rested. Cheese is generous. Sometimes the cooking is a little phoned in, but again, the busyness of the place tends to show an urgency in the food. I've tried their buffalo wings and enjoyed them.A slice of pizza here, for three dollars, will give you two slices worth of food at just about any other place.  If it doesn't hit the spot, which it usually will, it will at the very least, scratch an itch.",Benny Tudino’s Pizzeria,3.5 star rating,$,Pizza
