Living in a community with a plethora of Latin American establishments (so not complaining, after all I am Puerto Rican) anything that offers a little more variety and diversity is always welcomed! Toscana is a trendy, yet quaint cafe. They serve only Illy coffee, so you already know your cup-of-joe will be rich with flavor. I recommend their iced latte with skim milk, it is iced-heaven in a cup. All of the staff is super friendly and always great you the minute you walk in. As a former retail store manager, I know the importance of greeting guests within three seconds of them entering. So, kudos! Toscana was a definite upgrade to the neighborhood. I cannot wait to bring my laptop over to get some work done!",Toscana,5.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Italian"
1,hEBv5nPlwAGEOJ4K7i9aUg,Carola B.,4.0 star rating,"This is my to go place in the weekends whenever I wake up and I feel like having an ""Italian breakfast"" as I do when I am back home in Italy.A cup of cappuccino or an espresso with a croissant. Last weekend I bought a slice of pizza and a focaccia to bring home for lunch, best decision ever! They were both really good, especially if you heat them up for 3-5 min in the oven.I've been to toscana few times now since I moved to Weehawken and I was never disappointed. I only wish they had a wider selection of bakery.* You can also purchase some Italian products here.",Toscana,5.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Italian"
2,jnZKihlB4PWugY9TQi2fXw,Adrienne J.,3.0 star rating,"Having lived in the Union City Cliffs/ West Hoboken area for the past ten years I have to say I am delighted to have Toscana in the neighborhood! Stopped in today for the first time and had an out of this world Caprese on foccacia with fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, arugala, and pesto. I truly savored every delicious bite. The place is very authentically Italian and yet already has a great cozy neighborhood vibe. I cannot wait to try everything on the menu! Update:Unfortunately Toscana has been open a month now and it's gone down hill fast. I've now eaten there a total of 5 times, or tried to. Every single time I've gone since, the restaurant has had only pre-made sandwiches with meat on them. Which kind of sucks when you are a vegetarian, but they advertise that they will make you any sandwich that you want...so...my second Caprese sandwich was great, but it tasted nothing like the first. It was just a completely different sandwich which I thought was a bit odd. My third sandwich was terrible. It was tasteless and dry. My fourth attempt at going there they ran out of bread. It was around 3 clock in the afternoon. My fifth sandwich was downright awful... tiny microscopic little slivers of mozzarella and barely any tomato. I realize this is first and foremost a coffee shop and the coffee is good but if you are going to offer food, it should at LEAST be consistent. Just not sure I'll be going back to eat there again. So disappointed.",Toscana,5.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Italian"

6,MShS2td95ZOOerG_Vojkhw,Erika M.,5.0 star rating,"Found this place on Yelp and couldn't believe it was so close to home! Very inviting, cozy and friendly customer service. My husband and I got cappuccinos and sandwiches. (The beef one was excellent but I still don't remember the exact name in Italian, sorry!) -They were amazing! We shared a sugar donut for dessert and it had a touch of citrus which was really pleasant. It was my very first time here and I am sure I will be back!

Panini on pizza bianca bread was excellent. Look foreword to trying the espresso and pastries. The owner, Mario, is from Italy and he and his wife are super friendly. They did a nice job with decorating the store too, lots of seating more like a cafe than your typical Italian deli.",Toscana,5.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Italian"

10,Mxr4GCxwDm4oQWQpYs73IQ,Jackie R.,5.0 star rating,"Toscana is a beautiful addition to the neighborhood. They import their goods directly from Italy. They have top notch coffee and biscotti. Their focaccia bread is delicious as well as their specialty sandwiches. They pride themselves on using the freshest ingredients. They have someone come in and make fresh mozzarella which is then put up for sale. They have free wifi for customers and a very cozy atmosphere. Their customer service is excellent. Mario, the owner, is super friendly and a pleasure to be around. Danny makes you feel at home whenever you step foot through the door. I highly recommend this place and hope everyone can visit and support this local Union City establishment.",Toscana,5.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Italian"
