It's right by the high line, at such a great location, and the inside is full of lights and is just so pretty. I had a friend recommend this place to me for my birthday and I'm so glad I had picked it. They don't do same day reservations, but for a Saturday night, the wait wasn't bad at all. They anticipated a longer wait than we actually waited for. There is a ton of seating inside and the restaurant turns into a bar after a certain time (I believe some time around 10 p.m.) There's a bar and indoor & outdoor seating. I ordered the steak frites and it was delicious, but I also tasted the salmon & the kobe burger and both were sooo good. I definitely recommend the kobe burger the most. The cocktails are priced at $13. The service was great, they refilled our water at times, and when our waitress was getting off her shift, she introduced who was replacing her. The bill came up to a little less than $200 for 6 people. They're also constantly cleaning their bathrooms, which is a plus for such a big restaurant.

It's fully covered and heated, but sections of the streetfacing wall open to the outside to let in a nice breeze and keep it feeling like a garden patio rather than an atrium. The bar service was honestly awful. It took ages to get anyone's attention, the bartender wasn't particularly friendly, and one of our cocktails was made incorrectly. When I pointed it out to the bartender, he insisted I was wrong while adding the missing ingredient.

Seems like a good place to see and be seen and it's close to the high line!The less good: as a new parent, I have learn ed to be on a look out for baby friendly places. This place has some perks and is definitely not on the list. Our party decided to take advantage of the fresh air and sit in the garden. The whole family came - including us and a baby. Someone promptly ran to us to let us know strollers are not allowed in the garden. We asked for a manager but have not been able to get a reasonable or logical answer to why our baby's stroller needed to be locked in a closet. Thank god they didn't make us lock up the baby too!Most of the party ordered fish (Hake or salmon). The flavor of the food was ok. Not spectacular. The portions were small.

There are actual small little birds flying around, so don't be alarmed they won't come near the tables/food. Its a large space that is good for groups but it gets tricky having a long table. We had a reservation for 12 people and the tables/floor were uneven and that makes it difficult to have shareables not the table. It can get very cold here since its basically outdoors [some of it] but the back has fireplaces and couches which is very cozy.SERVICE No complaints! They came around often enough and answered all my questions. I originally ordered the french toast and didn't like it, they switched it without issues. FOODTheir food is amazing. The french toast was too sweet for me but I switched it out for the pancakes- so good! The berry spread is different but amazing. They give mini donuts which are so yummy! I tried some of the the food my table ordered and I had no complaints. Their mango mimosa is delicious as well. NOW...their hot chocolate is TO DIE FOR.

An absolutely beautiful space with a few different seating choices, all of them Instagrammable. But my delight with them ends there.We were in town to celebrate my mother's birthday. After a walk on the High Line with a stop at a brewery we wanted to grab a few glasses of wine before dinner. The Park is between the High Line end we finished at and the dinner spot so we popped in and sat in the bar. I have never been ignored for longer at a place than I was at The Park and it was absolutely unacceptable. The bartender made eye contact with me several times and yet skipped me for other people. I'm not sure why. Perhaps because I hadn't just gotten a fresh blowout or have my Birkin bag on the bar? Because that's the clientele here. Young and in debt. Also the guy in the paint-splattered romper. He got his drinks way faster. But I'd have skipped everyone for him, too.Once the bartender asked Ms. Birkin to remove her bag I loudly said, ""Hi, there."" and was STILL ignored. But I waited it out. I was interested in a bottle but after that wait I just asked for a cava (they don't have it so I went with prosecco) and a beer for my husband. My mom was going with soda. It took forever to get the drinks.We sat by the fireplace (check out the owls chillin' in it, 'Gram away) and collection of National Geographic magazines next to an engagement party or maybe rehearsal dinner and drank quickly. As someone who worked in food service I ALWAYS tip. And I always tip 25%. This was the first time since I don't know when that I skipped the tip.  I also won't be back and don't recommend it.

Sitting in the little area by the garage window is cool, but there were birds flying around haha. We also got sat by a huuuuge loud party. It's nicer to offer options rather than just automatically taking our little party of two to the cemented area. We maybe would've taken the option of waiting since it was a fairly cold day. They may need more heaters out there.Foodie-wise also just okay. Nothing to write home about. I got the French toast. It was good, but it wasn't amazing.

At night the trees inside are lit with rope lights and the whole area is dreamy. Their barrier to the outside is open on top so it can get chilly. They do have space heaters in the ceiling but prepare for the sporadic blast if it is cold out. The food is secondary. While decent, it didn't really stand out. The seafood pasta was ok.

18,euDYj9dZT41zwvf43yElVA,Victoria O.,4.0 star rating,"Reasonably priced restaurant with a wonderful, large patio filled with trees (and birds!). Birds are a nice touch. Alas, birds have an unfortunate tendency to poop without warning. That happened to one of the 12 people at brunch on Sunday. Twice! If you are averse to patio dining (even if covered) or birds, sit inside. Prices are good for a place with a view of the Highline in the teens:  12-15 for all brunch entrees, which are quite large. But in the interests of preventing disappointment: the huevos rancheros are good but what they call huevos bears literally no relation to the dish, even under the most liberal definition. The tortillas are crispy (Mermaid Cafe does this as well, plus the sauce is burgundy and while quite nice, it's not on any planet a ranchero sauce). The black beans are good and plentiful. The guac atop the dish is also good. But the eggs are *undetectable*. I asked for the eggs overeasy but I couldn't hardly find yolk in the whole bowl, much less a runny yolk. There's no sauce really, but the cheese is good. I enjoyed it but left still jonesing for huevos rancheros because I have not been in LA since July and won't be back till January. The salmon hash looked beautiful, but again not hash. The perfectly poached eggs sat atop some medium rare poached salmon. I think the potatoes were free-floating. It all looked good but like the huevos, failed to live up to the billing on the menu. Bloody Mary's were strong but on the small side (with a lot of ice, I might add). But the housemade mini-donuts are transcendent, not to mention dangerous. And the banana bread is just evil: I think I ate 4 or 5 pieces. Service is friendly.

An absolutely beautiful space with a few different seating choices, all of them Instagrammable. But my delight with them ends there.We were in town to celebrate my mother's birthday. After a walk on the High Line with a stop at a brewery we wanted to grab a few glasses of wine before dinner. The Park is between the High Line end we finished at and the dinner spot so we popped in and sat in the bar. I have never been ignored for longer at a place than I was at The Park and it was absolutely unacceptable. The bartender made eye contact with me several times and yet skipped me for other people. I'm not sure why. Perhaps because I hadn't just gotten a fresh blowout or have my Birkin bag on the bar? Because that's the clientele here. Young and in debt. Also the guy in the paint-splattered romper. He got his drinks way faster. But I'd have skipped everyone for him, too.Once the bartender asked Ms. Birkin to remove her bag I loudly said, ""Hi, there."" and was STILL ignored. But I waited it out. I was interested in a bottle but after that wait I just asked for a cava (they don't have it so I went with prosecco) and a beer for my husband. My mom was going with soda. It took forever to get the drinks.We sat by the fireplace (check out the owls chillin' in it, 'Gram away) and collection of National Geographic magazines next to an engagement party or maybe rehearsal dinner and drank quickly. As someone who worked in food service I ALWAYS tip. And I always tip 25%. This was the first time since I don't know when that I skipped the tip.  I also won't be back and don't recommend it.

It's one of those places with a large open area that can be closed off for inclement weather. Highly recommend you come at night. At night the trees inside are lit with rope lights and the whole area is dreamy. Their barrier to the outside is open on top so it can get chilly. They do have space heaters in the ceiling but prepare for the sporadic blast if it is cold out. The food is secondary. While decent, it didn't really stand out. The seafood pasta was ok. The carrot cake dessert was not the epiphany promised by the waiter. The wait staff were good and prompt. No one complained that we were overly loud, even though we were. The bar looks pretty hip.

38,euDYj9dZT41zwvf43yElVA,Victoria O.,4.0 star rating,"Reasonably priced restaurant with a wonderful, large patio filled with trees (and birds!). Birds are a nice touch. Alas, birds have an unfortunate tendency to poop without warning. That happened to one of the 12 people at brunch on Sunday. Twice! If you are averse to patio dining (even if covered) or birds, sit inside. Prices are good for a place with a view of the Highline in the teens:  12-15 for all brunch entrees, which are quite large. But in the interests of preventing disappointment: the huevos rancheros are good but what they call huevos bears literally no relation to the dish, even under the most liberal definition. The tortillas are crispy (Mermaid Cafe does this as well, plus the sauce is burgundy and while quite nice, it's not on any planet a ranchero sauce). The black beans are good and plentiful. The guac atop the dish is also good. But the eggs are *undetectable*. I asked for the eggs overeasy but I couldn't hardly find yolk in the whole bowl, much less a runny yolk. There's no sauce really, but the cheese is good. I enjoyed it but left still jonesing for huevos rancheros because I have not been in LA since July and won't be back till January. The salmon hash looked beautiful, but again not hash. The perfectly poached eggs sat atop some medium rare poached salmon. I think the potatoes were free-floating. It all looked good but like the huevos, failed to live up to the billing on the menu. Bloody Mary's were strong but on the small side (with a lot of ice, I might add). But the housemade mini-donuts are transcendent, not to mention dangerous. And the banana bread is just evil: I think I ate 4 or 5 pieces. Service is friendly. We were a party of twelve, I think, and they did a good job. A nice place for brunch.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

The service was just okay. The bread appetizer was really good. I think the whole concept of dining while being surrounded by trees and birds is great.

I don't necessarily go for the food (I think the food is pretty mediocre), but regardless of the season, the beautiful decor of the garden makes you want to show off what a nicely put together restaurant in NYC can look like. It's also right by the Highline and Chelsea Market, so if you're touring around that area or have guests that want both decent food and great ambiance, The Park is always a great option! Out of all of the choices on the menu, I think the burger/sandwich section is the best. Not so much because they're special, but because everything else on the menu is average. I've tried almost everything from each section of the menu such as gnocchi, margherita pizza, lamb sausage pizza, calamari, rotelle pasta, and so much more, but I always end up enjoying any one of the burgers and sandwiches more than other dishes. Something was always off with the food - either slightly salty or slightly bland, and if this place can step it up with the food a little bit, I think I could recommend this restaurant to ANYONE who wants a great NYC brunch/dinner experience. The desserts, though, are pretty fantastic. The banana wontons are FABULOUS, but I pretty much enjoyed everything else from the dessert menu. I have yet to have any problems with service so far. In fact, all of the the hosts/waiters have been very accommodating.

50,cUT32VYCjS_IDSmOjJvRjw,Scott L.,4.0 star rating,"December 17th Monday 4:20pmThe sun was shining through clouds as it rained on a cold winter day.I had an hour break from work and chose Park for its proximity.I've seen The Park at brunch and at night on a weekend.  The enclosed patio looks spacious, bougie, and trendy with lots of smiling unprententious yuppies.  It almost looked like a place I couldn't afford but the posted menu looked reasonable.I popped in for lunch during the week and was happy to find an expansive comfortable lounge feel.  The place was empty.   It was dim and felt like the lobby of a hip hotel, and being over on 10 avenue it had less of a tourist sensation.I ordered a happy hour Merlot, $6, even though I had to go back to work.  I also ordered the steak salad, $15 that said it came with horseradish and tangerine dressing.   Annoyingly the steak arrived underneath the greens which is a little suspicious if you ask me.The steak tasted and looked good, if maybe not the medium rare cook time I had asked for. The more I think about it, that was an ultra weird move.I had to dig around in a huge bowl to find the steak, which I'm guessing there was at least 3.5 ounces.It all tasted, and from what I could tell, looked good.But why has anyone ever done an upside down salad presentation without formally making it part of the dish, with the name and additional presentation.I've worked in the service industry long enough to know that something went wrong there.  I'm not sure what, but it's enough reason to make another trip back to Park to order that salad again to find out.The salad also was described as coming with toasted Hazelnut's, which were really burnt and maybe 3 and a half.   They actually provided a nice taste, even though they were few, a little hard and slightly burnt.I guess the food tasted like hipster hotel food too, kind of better than average but with a few whimsical flaws.I want to describe the salad more in depth to you.Salad profile *The large bowl was about 18 inches in diameter and 2 inches deep. *When the bowl arrived all you could see was a bowl of greens, but a fancier mix of small round lettuces, at least 5 different kinds.  I'm not sure of the name of the mix, I hadn't seen it before but I'm sure it has a name.* I had to dig around for at least 20 seconds before I felt comfortable with the meat portion.  To be honest the portion was small, and it wasn't mixed in with the lettuce, it was on the bottom of the bowl.  I'm guessing about 5 pieces of thinly sliced steak.  It actually tasted good, but was in the neighborhood of 3 ounces.I was honestly a little disappointed, but for $15 in chelsea, it was actually an okay price.  I can imagine having paid $23 for the same sort of salad.  It's called touristy rip off.  This was kind of like, part downtown rip off, part lazy downtown cook.The crime scene Park has an interesting atmosphere that combines Casual luxury with a dim moody film noir elegance.It feels yuppy and trendy, but it has a little edge.  As a matter of fact it somehow doesn't feel like it attracts a douchebag crowd, even though it looks like it does.And I'm sure there is the occasional douchebag moment. I'm assuming you go here to drink primarily, with food being secondary to the equation.$6 house wines for happy hour were a big surprise for downtown, and even just Manhattan.The place was so deserted at 4:30pm on a Monday, I'm definitely including this in my bar rotation downtown.It was comfortable and meditative.I had a second glass of wine at 4:40 which gave me enough time to down it before being down the street by 5pm.Yahtzee Atmosphere - contrived but unpretentious      Is that possible.

Upon leaving, she gave me attitude about getting them back. Just not a super friendly place, which was disappointing, especially considering it's where I chose to eat for my birthday.The drinks were quite awful, we had to send them back, and the taste still did not improve.It took us 15 minutes to ever see our waitress or any staff to ask for our check. Once we got that, it took 30 minutes to check out. Not sure why it was so slow since it was 6:30 on a Tuesday so maybe they're understaffed. There are birds up above since its kind of outdoors and a bird pooped on my friend's pizza and another one pooped on another girl's hand.

I mean, it's french toast and wonderfully sweet.-Breakfast pizza- We also shared it and loved it. The eggs were easy, and the flavors were good.-Pulled pork w/poached eggs and sweet potato hash- A mixed dish. Eggs were well-cooked and the hash was good. But the pork: bland city.

Needless to say, those expectations were met.People are definitely drawn in here for the decor of the store, and I was definitely part of that statistic however the food here is terrible and the service is equally terrible. Literally sat down looking at the menu for around 40 minutes before the waiter even came to see if we were ready to order and, honestly some of us weren't sure yet because he took so long to come by that we had forgotten what we wanted. While taking our orders, he seemed so irritated because we were taking so long but what do you expect from a table of 10? There would have to be some confusion and it is your job to clarify what each person wants, make sure that you heard them clearly and still deliver a positive attitude.After ordering, our ONE appetizer came out, which was calamari and pretty good. Probably best thing all night. It comes with a chipotle aioli which I never thought to have with calamari, but it was pair together pretty nicely. They also had the regular marinara sauce and I liked that as well.I had the magherita pizza, $14, which is the best pizza they have and PLEASE DO NOT try your luck with the other ones because they are DISGUSTING. Especially the smoked chicken, which doesn't have any marinara sauce or cheese, and is covered in EGGS. I took a bite out of my friends' and it was just absolutely horrific. My friend ordered the classic burger, veggie and another person in the table had ordered the classic burger with beef. The waiter and busboy had no idea which one was veggie or beef, this was a HUGE problem to me. As I find it a huge deal asking a vegan to accidentally take a bite out of a beef burger just to check if it was beef or veggies (patty made of beans). My friends and I took lots of photos here and they didn't rush us at all. Granted, it was very empty during the time that I went. Just my party, a couple parties of two and one other large party. But, we were all over the place and barely at the table at all and they were very kind with that. It took forever to get the bill settled but, finally we paid and left.

Unfortunately, all of the staff I encountered were less than lovely.I will limit my review to the bar (and not start with the manager who rudely told each of us to use another route to the bar). I suppose it was understaffed. After waiting at the bar for five minutes a woman came by to tell us ""it's going to be a long wait."" It seemed like that was suppose to deter us from ordering, but surely that was not the case as restaurants depend on patrons to buy food and drinks. Hmmm. When we finally got the attention of the other bartender, a friendly gentleman, the lady bartender interrupted us as we were ordering and told him to start at one end of the bar and ""go in order."" We waited quite a bit longer and was finally able to place an order. Two friends were ordering. The first friend ordered two beers, and the bartender rushed off to ring them up and get get glasses. He dropped off the drinks and the bill without asking if the second friend was ordering. He was. He also wanted a beer and was ordering my glass of wine. Unlucky for us, the bartender kept working his way from one end of the bar to the other, as instructed by the grumpy bartender woman, and simply moved on to the next group sitting beside us. We had to wave him down again to let him know that we weren't done. I noticed a couple of men standing behind me that were waiting longer than us and weren't being helped with this start-at-one-end-of-the-bar process. I am assuming they finally ordered but who knows. Hopefully the left and went somewhere else.Each time we went to the bar it was an ordeal. A long wait. Keep in mind, it was a very cold Saturday (bizarre 28 degree weather in November) and around 3pm. The bar wasn't busy; there were more than a few empty chairs at the bar. Furthermore, the restaurant wasn't busy. We easily found seating next to the fireplace near the entry and then in the garden space in the back. If I wasn't seeing friends who were in town from London I would have left. There are far too many restaurants/bars in NYC to have terrible service.

I was really disappointed though, the prices were okay and presentation was nice but the salad was super bland once you get past the egg and there were so few fried avocado pieces. It's worth it to mention though that at least the banana bread that was brought out was good. I see a lot of reviews here complaining about service but I found that the service was very good, our waiter was super knowledgeable on the menu and he was also super friendly. He even made periodic check ups on our table to make sure everything was alright.

I've noticed all the great dining reviews on Yelp but I can only comment on the nightlife.The ambiance and decor is absolutely breathtaking and they have 2 levels of dance floors with a splendid view of the skyline. The place was packed and people were drinking and dancing their hearts away. The bartenders were moving a mile a minute to accommodate everyone but it was still pretty rough trying to get their attention at times. The prices for the drinks were pretty standard ($12 for grey goose and cranberry). Ultimately, I was really happy they played a wide variety of music, mostly Top 40, but it definitely got people in the mood to dance. I enjoyed my time here and after I was completely sweaty and exhausted from dancing it was amazing to have a seat in the garden area for a few just to get myself together. The layout of the establishment is fantastic and it provides many outlets to having a good time whether you want to party or just gossip with your friends in the garden. A part from having a blast, however, throughout the night I observed many people (8 to be exact) dropping their glasses on the dance floor whether it was an accident or due to belligerence it definitely caused a safety hazard. The fact that it was crowded and people unawarely continued to dance on top of shards of glass is extremely dangerous.

My friend made a reservation for 16 people (changed to 15 last minute) -- they made her make a seating chart and create name cards for everyone. I thought it was a cute touch. A bit aggressive, but ended up working out.They have beautiful decor -- mostly with plants and trees all over the place. The floor is brick, and the ambiance is classy. In the bar area they have really cool wooden seating that makes it feel like you are in a forrest. Everyone I saw in The Park was very well-dressed.A few points:(1)I wish the table was more circular so that we could have all seen each other -- but it ended up being a really nice dinner and the long table was fine.(2) Our waitress was very nice -- she really tried hard to constantly attend to us.(3) My friend got a cake from outside to have at this dinner. The Park was really nice about cutting it for us -- they charged a $60 plating fee for 15 people. BUT we planned on going out afterwards, and we didn't want to carry the cake around with us so we asked if my friend could come pick it up the next day, and they said they will put it in the fridge and would be happy to do that for us. (4) Service was pretty slow. It took a really long time to bring out our food and the cake after we sang happy birthday. Even the drinks took quite a while. We were there from 7:15am until almost 11:00pm. They bring out this really nice bread for the table on a plank of wood with oil. I think there was rosemary in it -- and tasted really nice with the oil. Great start to the meal.I also got the mint lemonade. It had a nice fresh flavor to it because of the mint.The menu is very vegetarian friendly -- which I always appreciate. They specifically mark items that are vegetarian and others that are gluten-free -- which is awesome for people like me with diet restrictions.Me and my friend shared the Margherita pizza and a side of french fries. The pizza was definitely more than enough for the two of us to share -- and the waitress brought out red pepper flakes and ketchup (for the fries) upon our request. I thought the fries were very well-made and cooked to perfection.The waitress was also super nice about taking our photo.

I always crave both something sweet and savory for brunch, so my friend was kind enough to split the huevos rancheros and crunchy French toast with mascarpone & maple-vanilla syrup with me. Both were delicious! If I had to choose between the two, I'd pick the huevos rancheros. My mango mimosa was very sticky on the outside of the glass and didn't wow me as much as I expected it to.

With the severs not being very attentive I was unable to complain about it being cold until the end. When I did address it a nice gentleman said he would see what he could do about it and I'm assuming whoever he spoke to was some kind of high rank manager I overheard him saying "" oh well"" and then proceeded to charge my card.

I nicely asked why and was rudely told the *manager doesn't like her*. She looked beautiful, totally sober, and was dressed appropriately. Many other girls with flats were let in while she was for some reason pulled away. I told them we were a big group and if they didn't let her in, we had to go somewhere else and the bouncer said ""manager doesn't care, I don't care."" Great, I don't care about your reputation.

We ordered 3 pizza for everyone to share. One was with pesto sauce, Regular with mozzarella cheese & tomatoes and the last with an Egg on top. My favorite would be the last one which is the Egg pizza because I can taste all the ingredients. My least favorite would be the pesto Mozzarella pizza because it was really salty and left a bitter taste in my mouth. over all if you love burger and fries definitely order it!

We chose to sit inside because it was really humid outside, but the atmosphere outside is definitely better.Our waiter was super attentive and upbeat, and he refilled our tiny water glasses constantly. Having walked around a ton beforehand, this was much appreciated. We ordered the calamari to start and then the grilled hibiscus salmon that came with a snap pea, corn, and wheatberries accompaniment as well as the rigatoni with braised spare ribs. The food was all good but not outstanding. For a nice restaurant, I was surprised by the state of their bathroom.

I've never seen the Park really crowded but it does have a solid crowd most of the time. Crowd at night is kind of older, especially since I think Avenue and Artichoke next door capture everyone else. You know why it's called the Park the second you walk in - the downstairs area has a large, enclosed garden with trees, birds, and benches made out of stumps. The vibe is very laid back and chill, and I feel like it would be a great place to spend a lazy Sunday evening nursing a drink. The tables are set in the garden for table service, but you can also just go sit and chill at some of the benches or open tables without having to order actual food. Since the garden is enclosed but feels like outdoors, I imagine it would be fantastic in the winter. They have heaters attached to the roof. At night they have twinkling lights on the trees which make for a very cute, romantic vibe. Drinks are reasonably priced for New York.

Though we're having a great time, clearly this wasn't just my charming personality. She spotted a mouse crawling out from under an adjacent table and it was headed our way. The mouse stops about 3 feet away from us, turns around, and heads back to underneath the center table leg from which it came. I don't see our waiter, so I flag down a busboy. I explain about the mouse and he proceeds to tell me that he's only a busboy. Ummm, ok? So as the entrees are about to be placed on the table (which I'm obviously going to send back) I flag down our waiter, and explain to him the situation with the mouse. (Clearly we're not going to eat our dinner after just seeing a rodent walk right up to us) The waiter agrees and says ""Okay, I'll take care of it."" My date and I both assumed he'd come back with the manager or someone with an apology and tell us that the two drinks and appetizer would be gratis. Nope! He came back with our bill, and said that he didn't charge us for the entrees. No shit! A bit surprised by this, I pay the bill/tip, and we leave.I understand that we are in New York City.

Nothing special, my waitress was boring and kinda rude and she didn't offer us any drinks.

The drink was strong but very small. The bathroom was downstairs and it was disgusting and looked like it hasn't been cleaned in weeks. We left a $10 tip which I thought was generous because our waitress wasn't friendly and seemed bothered by us but she came back asking for more, I thought that was pushy and trashy.

The indoor garden is beautiful, and the space upstairs is great, too-- very open, with its own bar, and a heated/insulated common space for dinners or presentations that looks directly out onto the High Line.

After having sat ourselves in the dinner section for 10 mins, we had to flag down a waiter to order our food. He told us, heatedly, that we didn't follow the rules by getting seated by the hostess and that is why he was refusing to serve us (why didn't you approach us to say so?). We then went through the proper channels and were seated by the hostess in the same dining area where we proceeded to wait a further 10mins while no one addressed us. Eventually a cocktail server came and told us we hadn't been served because we didn't follow their protocol for dining but would be happy to help us because ""we must have been confused"".

Another friend ordered the house burger and had no complaints though her fries definitely needed more salt. In regards to the appetizers I cannot say much.

It is BeautifulI inside and Spacious, the upstairs looks like you're in an elaborate Garden or Jungle....idk its really green inside but it works!  The crowd is mixed and they have a restaurant and 2 dance rooms so whatever is your deal they may have it. I  went this time with a friend who had it on her bucket list and for the first ate in the restaurant section around 9pm. Our waitress was friendly and very helpful and the place really is attractive so we enjoyed catching up as we looked over the menu. Here we had an issue. Neither of us had a huge appetite but nothing on the menu looked promising for our simple palates. We decided to share the lamb meatballs which are Headed with the word ""Food to Share"" or something of that nature. As we waited for our meat we were given bread and some oil.  I have been fighting my carb addiction for years but tonight was a treat and Im glad I treated myself because that bread and oil tasted like pure Heaven! So our Meatballs came and well....there were 3 whole meatballs in that tiny bowl. My friend and I were confused. Who shares 3 Meatballs? I dont like sharing period so 3 meatballs left me considering fighting my friend for this bounty.   What kind of set up was this and no they weren't big or even medium sized meatballs ;they were normal sized. However,  when I tell you them things tasted like the VIP room IN Heaven!? Yes! That with our bread and oil and  we made a meal out of the meager offerings served. The bill actually wasn't that bad considering we had drinks that actually tasted like the ingredients listed in them.  I also must say the staff at this place are ALWAYS friendly. I came early but even when I've come and there was a line (which goes pretty quickly) the bouncers were not the pretentious run of the mill jerks NY night scene is rampant with.  By this time I wanted to party.  I remember the Park not having much Hip Hop and R &B which killed my dancing spirit but this time I found the little room on the 1st floor and partied like it was 99.

He said that he would take care of my dry cleaning...meaning, I would have to pay for the dry cleaning and the restaurant will reimburse me. I explained to the Manager that my night just started (I had two other events to attend that night) and I could not go back home and change. The manager sarcastically stated that there was nothing else he could do for me. My first mistake was not leaving after this incident occurred. I decided to stay because it was my cousin's birthday dinner and I didn't want to disappoint her. I ordered the Veggie burger with fries. The Veggie burger was hands down the nastiest Veggie burger I ever had in my life. Firstly, the patty was dry and it was oxblood red. I never had a red VEGGIE burger ever.

Luckily, The Park made it very easy to experience several different ambiances for a great night out without losing too many of my extremities to frostbite.I'm someone who tends to avoid Meatpacking at any cost, so I was really surprised I like this venue so much. You begin in a huge restaurant/bar area, move through a beautifully lit indoor garden, and end up in another bar/dance floor area. There's another dance space upstairs as well, but this was closed off when I visited. Restrooms and a much appreciated coat check are located downstairs in the basement (pro tip: don't lose your coat check ticket, or you'll have to wait until closing to get your coat back. They don't accept pictures of your ticket either).Perhaps the frigid weather had something to do with it, but The Park was very spacious and not crowded at all. Drinks were average prices for the area (around $10 well drinks), and the bartender was extremely efficient. The DJ was also killing it all night; I danced from midnight until 3:30am and barely noticed where the time went.I'd love to return and see what this space is like during the summer (probably 10x more crowded), but it was perfect for a girls' night out in the middle of winter.

When we ordered drinks, we actually got carded. I haven't been carded for drinks at dinner for almost ten years, and it was a little embarrassing because I had left the house without my wallet since the BF and I initially planned on going for a walk in the neighborhood. I understand that this might just be procedure, but wholly unnecessary (especially if my BF and I are clearly not rowdy teenagers). We did get our drinks after our server consulted about five people (clearly in view of us), and they were horribly watered down.Food was pretty good. The focaccia (served with olive oil for dipping) was soft but extremely salty. Calamari was crispy and was served in a generous portion. Rigatoni with short rib was decent but was missing some kind of flavor element (maybe because I asked the server to skip the parmesan on top).

A group of friends and I made plans to have breakfast at The Park for a friend's birthday. Mistake #1. The birthday girl and I were running about 15 minutes late, when the rest of our party of 7 let us know that the restaurant would not seat them until the entire party was there. Okay, totally understandable, as it is a common policy at many restaurants. We got there at around 10:15 am (thinking that the place would be packed, that being the reason they would not seat the rest of our party)...there. entire. restaurant. was. empty. EMPTY. They really couldn't just seat them? Very strange. Then, the hostess proceeded to seat us inside at a booth. To be honest, one of the reasons we chose The Park to begin with was because of the outdoor ""park-like"" seating area of the restaurant. We kindly asked the hostess if it would be okay if we were seated outside (that part of the restaurant was empty, too), and it seemed like she made up some bullsh*t answer on the spot. She told us that, since we were a BIG party (there was 7 of us), we couldn't be seated outside because there was another ""larger"" party coming at 11 that had reservations, and she did not want to rush us to eat our food in 30 minutes. Totally understandable...if that were true. We waited for 11 am to come around...11:15...11:30..........THERE WAS NO ""LARGE PARTY"" THAT CAME FOR ""RESERVATIONS"". In fact, the restaurant was still pretty empty. A party of 4 then entered, asked if they could sit outside, and the hostess happily walked them over to the outdoor seating area. So then, we asked the hostess one more time if it would be okay for us to sit in the outdoor seating area being that 1) it was empty and 2) two of the girls from our party of 7 had to leave and now that we were only 5 people, it seemed pretty reasonable to let us sit outdoors. And guess what the answer to that was? No...because ""another party has reservations and they will be here soon"". Needless to say, by the time we were done eating, not a single person had entered the restaurant at all. The place was a ghost town and the management has no idea what customer happiness/ satisfaction is. And as if that experience alone wasn't enough, the poached eggs over salmon hash that I ordered was essentially an entire plate full of onions, 3 pieces of potato, and poached eggs. I literally had onions with a side of eggs. My friend ordered the same thing and got a plate full of potatoes and eggs. Talk about consistency. Actually dont, because this place absolutely sucks and they have no consistency. I have been to hundreds of restaurants all over NYC and have never ever ever had an experience quite like this one. If you're contemplating going to The Park, even after reading this review, do yourself a favor and don't. Just don't. And if you STILL do, don't order the poached eggs over salmon hash unless you really love onions so much so that you're willing to pay $14 for sauteed onions. If I could give this place negative stars, I would. The only decent part of our horrifying experience was our waiter was the nicest guy ever.

171,PS7bbxdXhU-ti-gxb6hQPQ,Stephanie S.,2.0 star rating,"This was my second time having brunch at The Park. The first time I went, the meal was less than memorable but I was willing to give The Park another shot after the folks at the front desk at Equinox gushed about it. After our Equinox session, my friend and I were pretty excited to negate the workout we just did with brunch cocktails and breakfast carbs. My friend had been anxious to check out The Park since she's walked by it a few times and saw how picturesque it looks inside.  It is a very pretty restaurant, broken up into a bar area, a dining area and the covered garden/green house with ample seating as well. The garden alone can attract a large, curious brunch crowd with its Secret Garden like décor, covered in greenery, trees, and hanging plants.  As pretty as the restaurant is, the disappointing food outshines all that's positive. To start, the bloody mary was watered down and the complimentary banana bread was dry and not enjoyable. To make up for that, we started with the warm donuts and those were actually decent. There were 6 small donuts total and all were fluffy and warm so no complaints there. Our brunch just fell flat completely when the meals came out. I had the pulled pork and eggs and I spent the majority of the time picking off large fatty pieces. Normally I wouldn't care, I understand that it's pork and it's naturally fatty but there was so much of it. Also, I had a hard time believing that the pork was slow braised at all; it did not fall apart at all. The toast served on top made this dish tolerable as it offered a depth of texture on this rather one note dish. My friend decided on the always crowd pleasing eggs benedict only not to be pleased at all. Her canadian bacon was a thinly sliced piece of ham and the sorry excuse of a potato hash brown was more suitable as a hockey puck. Overall, The Park offers up a disappointing brunch in a garden like oasis. I felt betrayed by Sunday brunch here. Sunday Brunch is one thing that makes Sunday more of a funday and less of a pre-Monday kind of day, ya know?Oh and if you do decide to brunch here, watch out for those hanging plants, they tend to drip out runoff water onto the table.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

I easily could have  had another loaf by myself for lunch.Not long after, our food came out.  The table where they sat us was pretty small for 4 people dining and there was barely enough room for everyone's plates and glasses but all of us managed.  I will say that my salad was good and was a good portion with a good amount of seared tuna.  I really did enjoy the salad.  Our friendly and chatty waiter though sort of disappeared after that.  He came by one just to check up on us but I had to ask one of the busboys for another bottle of water.It took forever for us to get the check, and then to get it picked up which was annoying, given we all have to get back to work.  So A+ for the food and ambiance, C- for the service.  Still, I had a great lunch and would consider going back to eat.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

It is as its name suggests, an indoor park and it really feels like it even in the middle of December (albeit, a very warm one).

I could've eaten that butter with a spoon I don't even understand how it could be that delicious BUT IT WAS. Finally, my entree. I got the brunch entree that consisted of eggs and beet hash (I can't remember exactly what its called but its the only thing with beats on the menu). The sautéed onions paired with the tiny beet cubes were phenomenal and it was probably one of the best breakfast meals I've ever experienced (probably exaggerating a bit cuz I was starving but I seriously loved it).If you want awesome tasting brunch in a fairy tale atmosphere - try this place.

The restaurant has different areas and has really a ""park"" theme to it inside. Not the kiddie park, more like old brick wall with branches hung with yellow Christmas lights cute date night out chill with friends. Absolutely beautiful. They have a dance floor as well in the restaurant. There is a fire place area with couches if you want to wait while the club opens up.Even that area is gorgeous.Then when you walk upstairs to the club, it seems like you're walking into like a dark greenhouse I should say with the bar on the left, straight ahead the main dance floor and right in front of it is a big fish tank. Lots of seating available. I came on a Friday night and the kind of music they play is top 40 which is awesome coz I think majority can relate and dance to.Drinks a little up there $10+ I should say. I had a sex on the beach didn't really like it but then again disclaimer, im not much of a drinker. I like sex on the beach drink better back in Miami. My friends kinda liked it.

177,bOkhxBRt2FXs_Zxpm_wS0A,Amanda C.,3.0 star rating,"I have been here for both dinner and brunch and in both cases have found the food to be rather mediocre.The redeeming quality of Park is it's decor (granting it one extra star in my review!). The first room, the indoor dining room, has a large, bright, beautiful, fully stocked bar in the center, and a lounge area with several comfortable looking chairs. The second is the ""outdoor"" room, which is completely covered and enclosed during the winter time is filled with trees and plants, which are lit up at night. It's pretty enchanting, and the decor really makes you feel like you're dining in the middle of a park, hence the name. The one downfall is that it can be hard getting to your table sometimes in places where the furniture/decor isn't as well placed. When I came for dinner, there was a huge rock right behind my chair, making it hard to get in and out. When late night approaches, they also have a DJ and a dance area, which was pretty popular. Could be perfect to do right before heading over to Avenue next door. Food (brunch):- Bread basket: To start the table was given the most adorable plate of banana bread and butter; it looked absolutely lovely, but the bread itself was super dry- Huevos rancheros: I'd say it was pretty average, and there were way too many beans, making the dish pretty bland. To be honest, I think I'd only return here for drinks to appreciate the atmosphere. It'd be a great place for casual drinks with friends or a date.

Servers have a tough job, and I always tip well.The facts:We live in the neighborhood and have walked by this place so many times. I saw the reviews and decided not to try this place on my birthday. But today, after Pride, we decided to try it out.We made a 7pm reservation.The hostess seemed desperate for another job. No warmth. No smile. We sat down at 7:00. One server kept walking by and around us, serving all the other tables except us.Ten minutes later, someone finally brought us water.Five minutes later, we have to wave down some other server to take our order. He was not supposed to be our waiter but ""voluntarily"" took us on and placed our order, including drinks.7:30 comes, and we were just about to get up and walk out as we have yet to get our bread or drinks. They finally arrive at 7:35. Our volunteer server came and told us that the person who was supposed to serve us had not shown up to work yet. That made no sense because we had servers looking right at us, over us, through us, and still ignoring us. Every other table had someone attending to them, although most people looked displeased. Plus, our volunteer server put in our order but did not check to bring it to us.7:40 we speak with the manager. He comps our 2 drinks, which hardly had any alcohol. But still he was kind and understood our frustration. Our appetizer (flatbread and Mediterranean salad) arrives with our drinks. Two thumbs down. No taste. For either one, drinks and appetizer alike.Around that time, our would-be server arrives to work. She tries to serve us by bringing new silverware for our meal, not even apologizing. Maybe she didn't know???About 7:50, the food shows up. Salmon with some veggie crap and steak frites. It was as if we had dined at Applebee's. My steak was tough despite being medium rare. It had been sitting there for a long time. So long that the juices dried up. But I was over it and just wanted to eat rather than send it back. The salmon was bad. There was no flavor to anything.The best part of the meal plus appetizer was the fries with my steak. That's it. Around 8:10, our volunteer server comes back and asks if we would like another drink. We said only if they are on the house. He said he would check, and when he came back, he brought two drinks. They later showed up on the bill. When we got the bill, I still was willing to tip the waiter that took on our table. I inquired with the manager if the tip could go straight to him, but he said the tips go to everyone, not just the server. Well, screw that. I didn't want the late comer to have any piece of this tip, nor the server that walked by us over and over again.For the first time in a decade, I left no tip.

From my experience that night, clothing check wasn't a hassle and quite organized, despite a packed house. On the main floor, the bar area and the lounge is very chill ambiance. Really nice decor. Drinks can be pricey. At midnight, the top dance floor opens up. Mostly dance music, EDM, Hip Hop, etc. Sound quality is excellent.

211,50KBILeCJM8tcbjMpgROlw,Jessica G.,3.0 star rating,"We stumbled upon The Park after spending some time at The High Line over the holiday break. We were starving, and honestly, it was The Park or a pizza place. We took a look at the menu and decided to give The Park a try since it looked like they had a variety of food choices. It was probably right before noon on NYE, and the place wasn't very busy. We were seated in the garden area, which was lovely! It was beautiful, covered, and heated. There was a also a huge fireplace toward the back. I didn't explore too much, but it seemed like almost a lounge ambience. We thought that the food was reasonably priced, including one beer and one mimosa that we'd ordered. We all ordered some type of breakfast -- two breakfast sandwiches and a plate of scrambled eggs, toast, hash browns, and bacon. Our total bill before tax for the 3 of us was around $55. I don't find that unreasonably expensive, and again, we thought the food was good. After we placed our orders, our waiter brought some complimentary warm banana nut bread which was so so good! If they were selling them, I would have bought one to take home!The garden area is a little strange because there are birds flying around. Since we went in the dead of winter, I'm guessing that they open up the space when the weather is nicer. I watched a woman at the table across from us get pooped on by a bird not once, but twice! They also had some small children around us feeding the birds.

Once we were seated it took a while for our waitress to come take our order that we were ready to order appetizer and entry. I order a simple drink (Pepsi) and I got it long after our appetizer had arrived that I even forgot I had order a drink. As an appetizer we got fried calamari with chipotle sauce, and it was delicious and it was not dripping in oil at all. (Definitely recommend it). As a meal I order the classic beef burger in an English muffin and I have to say that I was disappointed. If you want to order a burger make sure you get the chef burger since it is the best one  in the menu. The one thing that disappointed me was the fact that I saw my waitress twice.

I cannot believe how atrocious the customer service is, and I'm stunned that they behave in such a rude and disrespectful fashion. Over 3 weeks in advance, I made a reservation for 9 people for Lunch this coming Sunday to celebrate a family birthday.  I confirmed the reservation a few days ago, by calling and speaking to them. At approximately 7pm this evening (Saturday, the night before the reservation), I received a voicemail from the restaurant. The message stated that in reviewing the reservation, they realized that their policy is to only accept reservations for groups of 10 or larger. That there must have been some sort of mistake, and that they will have to cancel the reservation. I was stunned and couldn't possibly believe the message was true. Even if there really is such a policy, I would imagine that since the reservation was both accepted and confirmed, a manager would make a one-time exception. Especially, considering the reservation was only 1 person short of their alleged minimum. I returned the voicemail and asked to speak to a manager.  An absurdly rude individual got on the phone. I explained the situation and the voicemail that I had received, and asked that considering it was almost 8pm on the eve of the reservation, and that some members of the dining party were driving from out of state, and the party was only 1 person short of their alleged minimum, if they could please make a one-time exception. I further explained to the manager that they accepted the reservation, and allowed me to confirm the reservation without anyone ever mentioning this policy or that or that there would be any issue with our dining party. The manager rudely said that he had canceled our reservation because of the policy and proceeded to hang up on me. This is simply pathetic behavior for an establishment in the service industry. Any normal restaurant would have made no issue of this, considering that they both accepted and confirmed the reservation. Additionally, calling to cancel the reservation the night before is epically rude and unprofessional. I implore anyone who is thinking of dining at this establishment to think again. They have no respect for their customers and could care a less for their fellow human beings,. Afterall, it was THERE error to both accept and confirm the reservation. And lets be honest, a party of 9 vs 10 makes virtually no difference!!!! Simply pathetic!!!!

The venue is really spacious with an elaborate Asian themed room with hanging lamp shades and deep red booths and lounge seats indoors. There were station tables set up for this particular event: a tasting of various cocktails from restaurants in the city utilizing the sponsor of Starr African rum. The restaurant provided complimentary meats, cheeses, and olive platters as well. The winner on the whole space is really their outdoor garden area that's enclosed by buildings and an overhead transparent roof. Beautiful trees on the patio laced with golden lights. It's pretty enchanting and whimsical and makes for a great spot to impress someone. As far as their actual menu, I've never ordered off of it as I've only been here for an event. However, the price range is moderately expensive as you would expect for meatpacking: $9 Drafts (unimpressive list)/ $13 cocktails.

The fregola was cooked perfectly, but everything else that came along with it wasn't the greatest: the pesto lacked in its flavor and was easily overtaken by the walnuts. The tomatoes weren't roasted as advertised, and so they really brought a bright acidity into the dishing contrast to the muddled tones from the pesto and walnuts. Overall, an earthy dish with slight sweet tones and confusing textures. SERVICE: Five stars for the hostess, for she was the only person in history that has ever explained why there are empty tables in the restaurant but aren't seating people. Our waiter was also very attentive and welcoming. ENVIRONMENT: This is why you would come here. Patio christmas lights with trees, or indoors full of comfortable booth seats.

The atmosphere is really nice, and our server was very friendly.  It's nice that they have a lot of vegetarian options on their menu, but I really wish they had vegan options labeled as well since just about all of the vegetarian options had some form of dairy in them.My fiance and I each ordered one of their vegan pies without cheese (we also asked to swap the cheese with mushrooms and they accommodated). When our orders came out they didn't have ricotta, but did have mozzarella on them. The manager came out and apologized for it when they brought out our correct orders. It seems the kitchen messed up because our server said they wrote ""no dairy"" on the order. I thought the pizza I got was pretty good, it was a lot better when I took the half I didn't finish home and reheated it in my oven with miyoko's vegan mozzarella. Everyone else we were with seemed to be happy with what they ordered, and all of the staff were very friendly, polite and attentive. Would I come back here? Only if I was with a group of omnivores that really wanted to go here, but I wouldn't suggest it. I'd love to come back on my own but I wouldn't unless they add better vegan options to the menu. I was also disappointed the bread and oil they brought out for the table wasn't even vegan (the bread had egg).  But they definitely have the potential to modify a few of their menu items and make a couple of really great vegan dishes, they could even just stock some vegan cheese for pizzas.

I went this past weekend for my birthday (went last year as well), and it never seems to disappoint. I enjoy this place for several reasons:1. The variety of rooms. I am at the age (mid-20s) when people's interests start changing. Some of my friends are beginning to settle down and get married, others still think they're in a frat and rage every weekend, and then there is everyone in-between. I don't like to disappoint my friends, so this place offers the best of both worlds. There are places to dance, but also places to sit and chill. It's definitely not quiet at night, so don't bring a friend who is looking for a relaxing, jazz-playing scene, but it it can host a variety of personalities. 2. The Scenery. I love parks in general, so it's awesome to have a place that resembles the outdoors even in the colder months. There is one dining area that has trees and plants, and it feels like you are outdoors (without the cold, frigid air). Some of the other rooms are more traditional, but this is by far my favorite room. I haven't been to the Park in the summer months, but apparently the upstairs (and maybe other rooms?) are open.3. Spacious and no cover. There is nothing worse than having to pay a cover to stand in a cramped space and then proceed to have to pay for drinks that cost $15+. The drinks here aren't cheap, so be prepared for that, but you can easily bring a large group and have fun. The place does get crowded late at night, but depending on which room you are in, you can find space. There is also a coat check if you don't want to lug around a jacket.Overall, fun place at night to bring friends.

I loved what I did end up ordering though. We ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer and that was great. My friend and I both decided on the potato gnocchi with arugula, pancetta and pecorino & it was amazing. I ordered the larger portion and actually almost finished the entire thing (I usually just pick when I eat). Boyfriend had the Park burger and said it was fine- nothing special, just a regular good burger. Our other friend had the margherita pizza, which was decent. We concluded that our waitress was definitely high on something...which is totally unprofessional. She was just out of it the whole time. We stayed after dinner in the lounge area. Good drinks, good music and the downstairs section wasn't too packed. Upstairs was too congested. Overall we had a good fun night!

Located at 118 10th Avenue, a great tucked away gem is waiting for you, that is if you like hideaway spots. Near the old and now wonderfully remade elevate line, now the high line walkway, the food is good but bring no expectations of great eating with you. Flipping burgers seems to be the best the cook can do because that's what s/he is good at. Other than that don't bother ordering something else. Large plates are physically large and not your entree.Either there is a lack of understanding in following a recipe, a waiter was cooking or management needs to understand that if you advertise an item on the menu...that really should be what you get. Otherwise leave a warning: INTERPRETATION OF RECIPES ARE RANDOM, EAT AT OWN RISK. But the burger was great. The order taker, waitress suggest customers should ask questions even though they are supposed to describe the dish and it's ingredients.

And even on occasions such as Halloween. This was a great brunch place. We came here for a huge birthday brunch. The ambiance and lighting was perfect on a Sunday afternoon. I felt like I was sitting outdoors or in a pretty greenhouse. The food was delicious. I ordered a mimosa and Eggs Any Style (scrambled) with sausage and toast. Everything was yummy, no complaints. Our waiter was a bit distracted and the service was just a tad bit lacking. However, we had an overall pleasant experience. As for nights out, I've been to both the bar area right as you enter and the red room, as well as upstairs to the penthouse. The drinks are better in the bar downstairs up front. Ordered a whiskey sour in the red room a few times and it ends up being too sour, mainly because they use the sour mix rather than actual lemons and simple syrup. But I guess that's expected in an overcrowded bar in NYC on Saturday nights. The Red Room and Penthouse are both usually packed and very lively. Great music and sometimes you can get a table to put all your stuff and take breaks from dancing. I love that there's no cover and the line moves relatively fast to get in, very much opposite of its neighbor, Avenue.

We were seated in the Garden area and everyone's first impressions of the space were great! For a group of eighteen, we were seated at two long tables, side-by-side. Our server seemed overwhelmed, even though we were forced to order from their large groups menu, which has limited options. The Worst Part: We ordered one of each appetizer on the menu for each table.

Marinate on it.  The Food: 1 StarDid I say that appetizer incident was the worst part? Well, that was the worst part about the service we received that day. The food is actually the worst part!

310,GnZatNzoIzQ7NKLyyREwgA,David F.,1.0 star rating,"This review has nothing to do with food, ambiance, service, etc. Simply put, The Park is one of the most poorly managed establishments in NYC. We booked my girlfriend's birthday dinner almost a month in advance, and, when doing so, requested that the party of 12 be seated in the garden as it is one of the more picturesque settings in the entire city and the main reason my girlfriend wanted her birthday dinner there. They said ""No problem.""Fast forward 4 weeks to the day of the event, and, it was only us calling them to make sure everything was good that prompted the hostess to inform us that the garden was, in fact, not available due to a private party and that we'd have to sit in the main dining room.Not the end of the world, but when I spoke with the manager that night and told him what happened, he agreed they were wrong and that someone should have called us as soon as the room was booked and simply asked us if we'd be okay moving to the main dining room. Apart from that, I had to educate him on the proper way to handle the situation: ""You call the customer up and say, 'I'm very sorry, but the garden has been booked for a private event the night of your birthday dinner. If it's okay with you, might we move you to main dining room and buy your guests a round on the house?"" Simple. Done.Unfortunately, the manager, when hearing my request for a round of a whopping twelve birthday shots for the table  - you could almost see the adding machine in his head start to smoke - exclaimed, ""Oh, I can't do that."" #BeancounterThe most they would do is a round for myself and my girlfriend - which probably cost them all of about .80 cents. And, again, I had to suggest it. It's quite obvious The Park cares only about the folks that rent their entire spaces and not about the patrons who frequent their establishment on a regular basis. Some owners/managers of restaurants peruse Yelp for negative reviews and on occasion, reach out to members and try to make things right.However, I believe they're owned by the same ""too cool for school"" guys who run Tao and the like, so I doubt they're concerned about stuff like this. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if it's in their handbook to treat guests this way.Never again.Just went to Rosa Mexicano last night and returned after a less than stellar experience. The management sent over every appetizer, side, and dessert in the book on the house.

We arrived in what seemed early by New York City standards and there was already a line congregating. So be wary however it moved rather swiftly with no fuss. The Park is very large with different sections and two levels with a good looking crowd. Almost every gentleman had a blazer on. The front bar was fairly less crowded and quieter. The back bar was a bit more crowded and because of this took a bit longer when ordering a drink. However, I never had any issues with the bartenders being rude or ignoring me. They were very pleasant. With the restaurant being so large there were plenty of places to step away and take a seat and converse with friends. I really liked that. The upstairs/rooftop was nice and open. Unfortunately I came here in December so I didn't get to experience the full rooftop open air but it was still nice. I remember the bartenders being on top of their game and having cups of water pre-filled ready to be passed out.

I brought a group of friends here who were visiting from abroad. Before arriving, I called to make a reservation. I was told they were no longer taking reservations but I could walk in and wait to be seated. No problem.  I expected a packed restaurant, but to my surprise, they were empty. With four of my party of six there, I was told we couldn't be seated until everyone arrived. I understand this policy in a full restaurant, but NO ONE was there. I even said we would order drinks while we waited if we could be seated. To this, the hostess scoffed back, ""Go to the bar!"" So Instead, we sat in an empty waiting area in an empty restaurant. Nice policy. Things didn't get better from there. The food was fine, but for the money, go anywhere else. It doesn't help the experience when you can hear the hostess talking about your group behind your backs. Am I confused?

Just asked if we wanted tap water or sparkling and left. She didn't ask us what we would like to drink. She just gave us water and left. 10 mins later came to take our order.... They didn't seem busy... There were guests but not busy or packed. We ordered.... Waited for 45 mins for a salmon burger and a plain personal pie. The waiters never came back to check on us or asked us if we needed anything else. A manager came and asked if we were ok when we were done eating. We said we are ok.

I haven't been here in years but based on the service we received tonight I don't know how this place stays in business. We sat down and I would say it was a good 10 minutes before our waiter showed up. In the meantime someone brought us water. Another 10 minutes later our waiter came back, explained to us he had just been given 3 other tables so he was now waiting on 4 tables at once to ""bare with him"" plus this was his second week on the job. Ok fine. Mind you the restaurant was practically empty. He comes back finally to take our order. We order our drinks and dinner at the same time in fear of waiting longer. About 20 minutes after placing our order he came to our table once to let us know our meals would be out shortly and that he was going to check on them. However we still haven't received our drinks? Another guy comes by to give us more water and I asked him to find out where our drinks were. 5 minutes later we get our drinks. Then our dinner arrives finally. Food was good so I don't have any complaints on that. We decided to order two desserts. We wait another 10 minutes to place our dessert order. Once we placed our order, it had to have been 20 minutes before we got our desserts. I ordered an ice cream sundae while my cousin ordered a piece of pie. How long does it take to prepare these items? No longer than 5-10 minutes in my opinion on a slow night. Once we finished we had to ask someone else for our check. After that we had to take our check to someone cause it was clear no one would be returning to our table to pick up the check. Not once did our waiter ask us if we wanted another drink or anything during dinner. For an empty night here it took us 2 1/2 hours to get through dinner. Service was horrible. I decided to use the bathroom before I left. The bathroom smelled like urine and it looked like someone had a party with the toilet paper. There was toilet paper all over the bathroom floor. There was even toilet paper on the stairs outside the bathroom. For a slow night how is no one at this restaurant servicing the restrooms? Do the employees use different ones that they do not realize they are a mess and smell? There is just no excuse when the restaurant is empty. Will I ever return her for dinner?

She became extremely rude to my friend. She decided he was too intoxicated to continue drinking, which is reasonable as it is her job. The manner in which she did so was unacceptable. We ordered 1 last round of drinks and after pouring them she then decided to refuse to put them on his tab and took the drink away from me as I was about to drink it and just poured them all out and wasted it. She threw my friends card at him and started yelling at him to sign immediately (illegal as he has a right to review the charges first). I then spoke with a manager, as I'm speaking with her she decided to handle it by kicking my friend out for a reason I did not see. He was a little upset, but I think after spending hundreds of dollars and then having a card flung at them, most people would object. She then agreed with me that the bartender was out of line, but she refused to compliment us a drink or discount for our troubles and seemed to just be humoring us. She then informed me that she did not care she would lose my business, despite the fact that me and my friends have spent in the thousands at this establishment this summer. I will not spend another penny at this place, it was quite clear I was mistreated. I was not intoxicated, the manager verbally agreed I was right and then she responded by removing my friends and doing nothing to right the wrong done to me, with the tab I had at the bar, a simple appetizer or drink would have been a nice gesture.

Who does that? It's actually ridiculous and I will never be coming back to this establishment ever again. Note- drinks are  not strong/overpriced, though the dining area is beautiful. You can't actually tell what they want to be though, between the front bar, the outdoor area, and the bar in back. Is it a club?

Once seated the heat was a little too much and we asked our waiter to turn it down and he did it quickly.The service was attentive and friendly. The food was amazing and just what we needed after a long walk. I had the butternut gnocchi and it was amazing. I wish I had ordered more, as it comes in different sizes.

The garden, with its sky ceilings and tall trees, is really charming and the ambience could potentially be really romantic (I came here for dinner with my buddy). Now, the food is really nothing to shout about. We ordered the fried calamari as app and it really is just that - breaded calamari that's deep fried. It's not particularly tasty, nor was it bad..just plain. I had the sausage pizza for my entree which again, was just OK. Perhaps, the purée wasn't spread evenly or it was concentrated in the middle because it was kind of soggy that when you pick up the slice, the thing just falls apart like a dog sticking out her tongue. I could taste the sausage but the overall taste was just 'MEH'. All in all, I'm sure that The Park would be a great place for happy hour drinks, or for dates (when maybe, the taste of food, or the lack thereof isn't a big deal) but I wouldn't come back craving for its food.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

They were very accomodating and switched out the cheesy sauce for a delicious tomato-based sauce. By contrast, my friend ordered the full size portion of the fregola sarda I believe and it was the same size as my half portion..... she was definitely disappointed.

We had a reservation at 9 PM for a group of 9 and when we got to the restaurant they had given our reservation away to another group. The hostess then told us since they messed up that we would have a round of drinks for free at the bar and that she would let the bartender know. We went to the bar and ordered the drinks, telling the bartender what we were told about them being free. He told us that he was not able to do that for us because the hostess wasn't ""authorized"" to tell us that. We then spoke with the manager who gave us little to no help, but said she would get us another table. We continued to wait for 20 more minutes, eventually being seated. Once seated, we waited for service for an additional 20-30 minutes. We eventually asked a woman who filled our glasses with water at our table twice, if we could have our server come over. She said she wasn't our server but we could order with her. We gave her our orders and she seemed totally overwhelmed. We waited another 10-15 minutes with no one coming over to us to ask us about anything drink-wise or anything. We eventually got up and left with no apologies or anything to make up for this miserable experience. We could tell other parties in the restaurant we're also dissatisfied and complaining to staff.

I was rather disappointed. I ordered the Margherita pizza which honestly had no flavor. I needed to add salt to make it taste worthy. The pizza was also bigger than expected so my group of friends and I could've shared 3 pies and not order 6. The waiter didn't even recommend to share the pizza, she instead took our order and we walked out with 3 entire pizzas.Lastly, my fiancé ordered drinks at the bar and paid for them at the bar, we ordered additional drinks at the table and when the bill came we had to return 3 out of 3 apple Martinis because they had to much mix and barely any vodka. The waiter seemed to get annoyed but it wasn't our fault the bartender kept messing up the drinks.

Sure, you may like the beautiful, dinner in the forest-like setting room--the overall upscale energy of this place--but the scene is super boring. I think most people who come here just come to socialize with their friends over a drink (which are expensive) and nodding their heads for the music is the most dancing they'll do. This is not a great place if you spend Friday and Saturday nights at the clubs. Music was mediocre and there was no real dance floor; people will move their feet but there's no real dancing here.

The one thing i liked about this place was that it wasn't sleezy at all. Most people were with groups and weren't bothering each other or sniffing up to strangers.

377,DGbJRVcAq5Aye2hHJgElwg,Stephanie S.,3.0 star rating,"I was brought here by 2 of my girlfriends on a Saturday night after leaving a private party. The upstairs was closed for some reason, but there are a couple different rooms, many of which are full of drunk but NOT sloppy people, which can make the difference between a great, or gross, place to dance the night away.When you first walk in, it looks like a quiet, classy restaurant with a handful people hanging around a bar and lounge area. I like to always make a quick walk-through before I commit to a place, but when you're ready to stay a while, the coat check is in the back and down the stairs, cost $4, and is next to the bathrooms.Go past the stairs, and you'll see a gorgeous courtyard with huge trees decorated with lights. In the 2 back rooms was a second bar, a lounge area, and a decent crowd of dancing people who all looked like they were having a BLAST. The DJ is posted next to the bar and plays booty-popping music all night long. It's loud enough that you'll feel like you're in a club even when the main restaurant is maybe 20 feet away, but they are cleverly separated by thick walls and the courtyard so noise is not a problem from the front of the house.We got there around 1-3am pre-drunk so we started dancing with each other. Unfortunately, there were a couple of guys who did not respect boundaries even after we moved away or said we weren't interested. At one point later in the night, a guy came up behind my friend and put his arms around her which felt a little rape-y and made us decide to leave. However, both my friends frequently come here and tell me that the crowd is usually much nicer, especially when the upstairs is open because you can explore the different rooms until you find one with a vibe you like.This is not the first and won't be the last time girls going out by themselves meet unsavory men. But most of the people here just want to let loose, dance, and have a great time, and there's enough space to move around that you don't have to feel like you're in a mosh pit.

The Park is an eclectic spot which offers a different vibe in all of the beautiful rooms it has. Let's pretend we're spending a night at The Park which demonstrates everything it's got. 7:30, arrive at The Park front bar for some pre dinner drinks. Sit by the fireplace on a comfy couch with friends and chat it up. Sip on some great brews they have on tap such as Stella. 8:30, head to dinner in the main eating hall of The Park. Dine on some amazing food. May I suggest, their oysters for a starter. The rigatoni with braised spare ribs is quite exquisite. The real winner is the grilled daurade, if you like sea bass, you'll enjoy this dish. 10:00, full? I bet. Head to the outdoor garden area of The Park. And walk some of it off. It's not really outside and you can't really walk around but it does look like you're outside, which is pleasant and could help you digest. Grab a drink while you're at it. Though I must unfortunately say, if there is one knock on this place, they don't have good cocktails. Stick to your standard shots, beers and generic liquor/mixer combos. 10:45, head to the red lounge room of The Park to meet up with more friends. Sit down with some buddies in the nice plush booths or get up and dance. Be careful not to knock into me and my drink. You will have to buy me a new one. 12:30, time to hit up the club. Upstairs at The Park. The Park has a nice rooftop which turns into a club like atmosphere on the weekends. It's pretty spacious from what you'd expect heading heading up there but don't worry. It'll be packed with lots of other sweaty people, so it won't appear that large. While it is a rooftop it is covered so not as much air gets up there as you'd like So in the end The Park is a wonderful spot. They aren't super strict with who they let it, don't care about your male/female ratio, they have no cover, it's certainly no dive but it's not a pretentious place filled with douchebags either.

We had made a reservation, which I recommend, because it filled up pretty quickly after 11.A bit off the beaten path in Chelsea (well, 10th Ave isn't really off the beaten path but it certainly isn't as busy as the rest of the neighborhood). The first thing we noticed about The Park is the beautiful décor inside. We were lucky enough to be sat in the indoor garden and LOVED it. There was also an abnormally high number of birds flying around, which made definitely made brunch more exciting when they flew right by your head. My question - do they just stay inside all the time? I'm assuming they open up the area in warmer weather, though.Anyways, the food was deliciously satisfying. Large portion-sizes, too. I got the sunnyside-up eggs over parmesan polenta with pancetta. Quite rich, but oh so good. Their coffee was pretty tasty too.Service was pretty standard, nothing too memorable about our waiter.

406,f36lq4qHFJ630yO9W4le8w,Alex H.,3.0 star rating,"So having read the reviews I decided to go regardless and make an informed decision of my own! The service was terrible, yes it was a Saturday night and now it was not packed/rammed, the waiter never came round to check on us, see if we wanted or needed anything, in fact we rarely actually saw him, our glasses sat there majority of the time empty - until we would grab the attention of a random waiter to order drinks.We literally would see him when he dropped off the food, which again also took what seemed like a long wait, it was fine because girl talk can fill any space of time. Another friend came to join us later on in the evening, she just sat there at the table - after about 15 minutes it was clear to say she wasn't going to be asked if she wanted a drink until, again WE were able to get the attention of another random waiter to order her a drink. After our meal, the manager came over and asked her how it was, by this point we still hasn't seen the waiter since he had given us our plates. I asked the manager whether the waiter had gone home, she said no, quickly replying that this other waiter was doing a tag team with him. Which was a complete and utter lie, because that was the first time that we saw him. So he cleared the table. Then never saw him again either.The place itself is beautiful - but it's cold! The restaurant was really cold, to the point where we sat there on a Saturday night and started slowly putting on layers from the nyc winter. The fans were on. Finally our waiter reappeared - I explained that we were cold and wanted to move seats. He explained that we could move but we would need to close our tab and settle, then we could move. We settled and then left. It maybe be coincidental but I've woken up with the worst sore throat ever.The food was good - I had the steak salad and it was very nice. It said to start - but it was a main meal within itself!The place is let down by the waiter - but we actually had a nice time and lovely food!  Quick tip: bring id - they id anyone who is wanting to have alcohol with their food.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

408,P9wWbPlS1ZHhCkq5ekplHA,Alyssa W.,2.0 star rating,"First and foremost, I am a lover of food and a lover of people. I have nothing but the utmost respect for those in service-based industries, and I'm aware that often there are situations that are trying, especially when sensitives such as serious food allergies are concerned. However, my family's experience tonight at The Park went beyond reproach, despite a determined new managers attempt to rectify the situation. My sister and I were born with severe allergies, hers far worse than mine. These allergies are to nuts and soy, two of the eight major allergens classified by FARE (food allergy research and education). We were clear and direct when notifying our waiter of these allergies; we came to find that this was futile. We ordered the artichoke dip, which was made with tofu cream cheese-- a fact left off the menu. it was only five minutes after we were brought this appetizer that the manager informed us of this ""contamination."" My sister (with soy allergies) had already eaten the dish at this point-- luckily for all involved, my sisters allergy to soy is far less severe than, say, peanuts or cashews. At this point, we became a bit defensive at the abhorrent breach of protocol- we notify of an allergy for the explicit reason that the restaurant staff know of each dish's contents- and the manager who came to our attention was apologetic and did what she could to tend to our needs. She offered us Benedryl, which I thought very appropriate and considerate. Yet, our waiter, apparently embarrassed at his mistake, never came back, and our table was ignored for the rest of the night. As for the food: the Rosemary bread and delicious olive oil at the beginning of the meal was the highlight for me. Two of our dishes arrived without sides, and two steaks were overcooked and were sent back. This would have been fine, I understand the demands of a Saturday night kitchen in Manhattan, but the way the staff treated us, like we were causing a scene and inconveniencing them at the kitchens mistake, was unacceptable. It was horrible, actually. I can forgive an overcooked steak, I can even forgive a side coming late. What I can't forgive is having eyes rolled at me and scoffing as I ask for the dish I ordered to be served. We had only heard great things about The Park before coming tonight, and I can only hope that tonight was a fluke for them, a far cry from their normal performance. I honestly can't give a higher rating to The Park at this moment. For those with any sort of allergies, I urge you to vigilantly ask about each dish ordered. The Park has a lovely indoor garden and a lot of supporters who love it, so I'll be back, hoping the next experience is better than the first.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

411,E9bf7sZym6fIWgIuKXEoKQ,Justin F.,1.0 star rating,"So I should probably preface this by saying that I have never, ever been compelled to write a review of anything on here before, but my experience at The Park this past Saturday night has changed that.I'd only ever been here once before for brunch, and that was fine. It's a pretty venue and its in a good location as far as stuff to do. However, some friends decided that they wanted to go for drinks and whatnot on a Saturday night after restaurant hours when it apparently becomes more of a bar/lounge situation. One friend mentioned that they recalled there being some sort of dress code, so I called and spoke with a hostess to find out what exactly that dress code entailed. In her exact words the dress code that they have is ""dress to impress"" and I was strongly advised against wearing sneakers, baggy clothes or overly casual attire. Now, as a 30 year old gay man who has worked in the fashion industry for almost a decade, I rarely even bother to take these club's and bar's ""dress codes"" into account because, frankly, I'm well dressed even at my most casual. I understand why a club that caters to a very mixed (and some might say simple) clientele may feel the need to advise guests who might feel the need to discourage their male patrons from wearing sloppy clothing and beat up gym sneakers, but when I specifically asked the hostess on the phone about what sort of sneakers she meant -- aka, do my $600+ designer sneakers from Barney's which would be worn with an equally stylish but casual outfit fall into that category -- she reiterated that sneakers are not encouraged, that I should ""dress to impress"" and that its at the doorman's discretion. Being a patron of places like Boom Boom Room, Le Bain, Soho House and other equally chic or hard to get into hot spots, not to mention an array of Fashion Week presentations and Susanne Bartsch parties, I'm well versed in what ""dress to impress"" means, so I heeded her advice and didn't wear any of my fashion sneakers. I ended up dressed the way I would dress to go somewhere with an equally stylish, equally cool crowd, and boy was that a mistake. Upon walking in and making my way around the venue with my equally dressed up friends, we all quickly saw that the dress code which was so adamantly explained by the hostess mere hours earlier was, in a word, bull****. Not only did I see guys in sneakers that wouldn't look out of place in a spartan race, I saw countless guys in wrinkled, poorly fitted collared shirts, nondescript t-shirts, sloppy jeans and, in one incredibly offensive instance, BAGGY CARGO SHORTS. And these instances were not even the exception, in fact, my small group -- in our satin bomber jackets, leather pants, blazers and dressed up shoes -- stood out like a sore thumb, a fact which was only made more infuriating by the near lack of suitable air conditioning in a massive and very crowded place.This all may sound like the spoiled ranting of a privileged brat, but to be totally frank, if I'm told verbatim to ""dress to impress"" I expect to be among a crowd of people doing EXACTLY THE SAME. In other words, I was either blatantly misinformed by The Park's hostess who insisted on a specific dress code OR The Park will let any bum in so long as they have a valid ID while also trying to present an image of a place that gets an attractive crowd. I have never, in my life, felt so out of place in a bar or club, which could very well be because I have never, in my life, heeding the advice of a hostess who clearly doesn't know what the hell she's talking about. I have also, never, wasted an outfit to party with a crowd of half assed slobs when I could just as easily have worn a pair of ripped up jeans, some sneakers, a vintage band tee and a bomber jacket and STILL been dressed better than most of the people there. Long story short, The Park needs to figure out exactly why they're telling patrons one thing pertaining to the way they're expected to look and acting in a totally contradictory manner when they let people in. If you're going to be a place that insists that even expensive, fashionable sneakers are not encouraged, then you damn well better make sure that everyone who comes through your door looks the part.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

We love the fact that there's no cover and a minimal short wait to get in! I usually trek all the way up to the roof area where you can dance on the dance floor or sit outside where there is open space area to breathe in the fresh air! However, the top roof area is always so packed and the floor is sticky from the spilled drinks. Whereas the bottom floor has more open space and a lot more area to dance in.The drinks are overly priced! I think it's worth it, to cover the no cover-fee. The park is also right near the highline! Too bad the Highline closes after dusk, or else there would be drunk club goers puking or sleeping on the greens.

Trying a new restaurant can be fun, but this was one the worst experiences ever. I thought I was playing it safe by ordering a salad and fries, but it was an almost $40 epic fail. I normally drink water, but either the water or the glass smelled very much like a garden, so I declined. I ordered lemonade, with the guarantee that the same water wasn't used as an ingredient. The lemonade was either missing an ingredient or had too much of something. Bitter, sweet and barely tolerable. Once I got my food, the fries tastes like they had been under a warmer for a few hours. The Caesar salad I ordered with grilled chicken arrived and I was disappointed. I always ask for a little extra dressing and croutons in most places, so that wasn't a shock. The shock was from not being able to see even ONE piece of chicken, on the grilled chicken Caesar salad! Well, the reason I couldn't see them, is because all 6 chunks (approx .5"" x .5"") were at the bottom of the salad. They were tiny, dry and rubbery. After asking three times for more dressing and croutons just to be able to stomach the dry salad, I finally got it. At some point toward the end of my meal, a new order of fries came. They were hot and fresh....and salty. Guess that's a good thing because it balances out the terrible taste of the lemonade. Oh, and the bathroom looked like an unsanitary tsunami hit it...and the smell matched. Even though my friend's margarita pizza was amazing, I will not be back.

For me, this bar is The Park.I've been coming here for a few years, and it really never dawned on me to write a review about this place...I just sort of assumed everyone knew how awesome it was.After taking a few of my friends here recently who apparently had never been, I felt it was my duty...no...my privilege, to share my views with the Yelp Universe as to why this establishment is so great.First of all, there's never a cover.  NYC bar and club microeconomics dictate that if you don't charge a cover, people will flock to the spot and it will get crowded. Yes, grasshopper, this is true...if the place weren't as big as a damn museum. Seriously, it's like they took 3 full sized lounges and combined them into one mega bar. It's easy to get lost if you come with a group - multiple bars, multiple dance areas, indoor, outdoor, whatever you like.Entrance area:As you enter the Park, you'll have a nice fireplace on the right (good to warm your hands after waiting in the cold too long), and a bar on the left that's almost always empty (good to warm your liver after being sober too long). Make a quick trip to the bathroom or coat check downstairs, and please proceed to the next roomMain area:Another long bar, dark and sleek with candles providing the accent lighting, and a ton of people dancing to everything from EDM to reggaeton. Just the way I like it.  Kind of hard to get a drink here, so you're probably better off going back to the previous bar. Garden area:Maybe you don't want to dance right now. That's fine - just go outside to their outdoor (in the winter it's covered) patio area, complete with tables (no reservations , just grab one and sit), another bar (good if you wanna get shots), and close enough to the music that you can just chill here and not bother anyone.Upstairs:Maybe you want to dance but it's too crowded downstairs. Well by all means hike up the stairs and find yet another room, complete with a bar, DJ setup, dance floor, and a nice outdoor area with more couches (again no reservations needed).So what's the catch?- sometimes a pseudo-line will form outside. Not cool bro. The place is at least a million square feet. It is not packed to capacity. Just let us in.- Bathroom attendants. ugh- early night syndrome - don't expect to show up fashionably late here. Although it closes at 4 as most NYC bars do, this place stars clearing out well before then.Despite these minor blemishes, the Park is a really fun place to hang out and party, no matter how many birthdays I have attended there (or will attend in the future).

We were seated at 11. Shortly after being seated, the entire party was carded. Regardless of the fact that we came for dinner, not watered down drinks, AND that only the 21 year olds were drinking (knowing the place was strict with ids), the entire party was told to leave after sitting for about 20 minutes because not everyone was of age.

The food and service, however, leave much to be desired.I attended a birthday party at The Park, and the staff was just kinda rude. They weren't friendly or welcoming. In fact, at one point, the manager (I guess) asked us to hurry and order because they had to give our table to another party in a hour. Mind you, she addressed the entire party, not just the young lady who'd coordinated the event. So we sat down and ordered, and found there was no rhyme or reason with bringing out the food. Two guests received their entrees when others were eating salads and appetizers. Others who'd also ordered entrees but no appetizers were not served until the others were finished with their appetizers. It was madness.To top it all off, the food wasn't even good. I ordered the gnocchi, and it would have been completely flavorless had it not been for the flavor of the arugula. Yes, I received lettuce-flavored pasta. The pasta didn't have enough sauce, and even after requesting more sauce and some Parmesan cheese, you could still only taste the arugula.I don't really have anything else to say about this experience other than the fact that I'm disappointed.

467,dcg9yvIzgz-vHUj4xhzJOg,Tiffany O.,3.0 star rating,"I'm not going to lie, despite the fact that I had a CRAZY experience the first time I was here, I have been back on multiple occasions, simply because this is a great and spacious place to hang out with friends, get drinks, and dance if you want to. Peep my tip though, DON'T DO COAT CHECK. I won't go into detail about it here, but if you're interested you can just message me or something (it's an exciting story, trust me).Being that I just moved to the East Coast back in August of 2012, I was looking for places to go in the City for my birthday that had the lounge/club feel. A friend suggested this place, and he told me that you didn't even really need to make reservations if you were just going for drinks so I was all about it.Atmosphere: LARGE. the bottom floor has numerous bar areas and there is seating since it's also a restaurant. It has an outdoor feel to it (with lit trees and stuff). They open the upper dance floor and lounge level around 11-11:30 and up there is a bar and a dance floor area and more tables.Drinks and Music: reasonably priced and relatively yummy. My friend bought all my drinks on my birthday (which was a lot), and all of them, at least up until the point at which I can remember the last drink, were good. The dance floor was filled when I went on Saturday night, but the vibe was weirder and less crowded on Friday. Don't know if this is a usual thing but eh, who cares, I was drunk and I apparently danced for more than 2 hours. The music consists of a variety of stuff - top hits, edm, etc. It's all-inclusive which is nice.Service: Brian, the manager (I think) is AWESOME. They work fast here and they're pretty relaxed when it comes to table service policies. The downside is it's a little far from the trains, but that doesn't really stop me from coming here. Honestly, if you have no set plans but want to go out and just chill, this is a really great place to do so.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

The Park calls this the ""front bar"" of the dining room, but the sign outside calls it ""BarCafe"". Either way, I'm so glad I discovered it. On one side is the bar but on the other is a mini lounge area where a fireplace crackles and vintage copies of National Geographic (dating back to the 1940s!) line the walls. A cushioned bench runs along the perimeter of the wall, and two 900-year-old (!) redwood root benches face them. Smooth jazz and mid-century crooners fill out the background sound. It's the perfect place to settle back, relax, and enjoy some good cocktails and company. For cocktails my Blood on the Tracks (bourbon, muddled orange and brandied cherries, blood orange puree, bitters) was watery and disappointing. But the boyfriend's Bonfire (jalapeno tequila, agave nectar, muddled cucumber, fresh jalapeno, lime juice) was en pointe and delicious! One of my friends got the Hendrick's Mash (gin, muddled lemon and cucumber, st germain- when elderflower is involved, it's always a winner) which was refreshing and tasty too.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

If you're over 30, don't bother coming here, unless you enjoy people-watching, which I do.

First of all, just like in real estate, the thing that matters most is location, location, location. The Park is in an ideal spot at the center of Chelsea. The music selection was relaxed and comforting, great background to our conversations. The terrace area is filled with hanging gardens and cozy lighting. The service was attentive and speedy. As with any review, the climax is the food. Our table ordered several plates. First up, the pulled pork eggs Benedict. The eggs were perfectly cooked, the meat was savory, well seasoned, and mildly spicy. You will get two crispy breads sitting on the top, use them to poke the eggs and explode the yolk all over the meat, it's orgasmic. The sweet potatoes provide the plate with an eclectic taste and perfect balance of sweet and salty. Second, we had the breakfast pizza, which comes with eggs and bacon for toppings. If you don't like eggs and bacon, your life is probably miserable. A person who tasted it once described this as ""amaze-balls."" Lastly, the French toast. We like to always end our experience with something to satiate the sweet tooth. We ordered the crunchy French toast with marscapone. The outside was crisp and caramelized. The inside was mushy, cheesy, fluffy, sexy. Overall, our experience was excellent, five stars for The Park.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

Also, she didn't completely understand our orders and a few items were off. Nothing catastrophic, again, just off. Food - Nothing to brag about if not somewhat odd.

We had no problem getting in, despite the profound amount of males in our group. There was a long line but it took us no more than 5 minutes getting in. No wonder because once in, we saw that the place was empty! So we ventured in. The Park is very unusually spacious. On the first floor there is a roomy bar area (which not one person was at...), and a beautiful garden area with tables and people lounging around there. The garden looked like a great place to have drinks or eat with friends. But once I saw disappointing food reviews on here, maybe I'll be cautious about eating there.... too bad because it  was just lovely. We went upstairs, where there was a dance floor and bar. Around this room are comfortable couches and sofas which was interesting! Easily can get a spot to sit and rest your feet or talk to someone. The drinks were pretty pricey. $10 for a beer or a shot. The music sucked, which put a damper on my night. I kept wanting to dance but I just couldnt. The music wasn't danceable, even though it was top 40, but it was bad top 40. Deducting one star for this, because it could be and should be better. My favorite part was the outdoor lounge next to the bar. Loved this. The atmosphere is so exotic and beautiful. There are multiple loungey couches outside for you to chill on with your group of friends or a date, or to just catch some night air, and there are plants everywhere. My friends were mainly dancing (to the horrid music) the entire night, but I wish we went to spend some time on the couches.

No, clearly Sock Bun Square Pants doesn't know what the word majority means, and she rudely snips at us that she needs 14/16 or 16/18 people....OK.So we sit and wait for a bit, before realizing that the rest of our party IS STUCK OUTSIDE ON LINE BECAUSE MUSCLES FOR BRAINS bouncer doesn't care that they're here for dinner reservations, not the club area. So, when I (female, tight mini dress) tell him that, it's fine. But when a guy tells him the same thing, it's not acceptable? After tracking down the hostess, we explain the situation to her, and she tells us she'll ""talk to the bouncer"". 20 minutes later, nothing has been done, and we ask her again, she rolls her eyes because *ohmahgod she has to do something that doesnt involve her cell phone or reapplying that god-awful lipstick*, and finally goes outside and gets the rest of the party. At this point its 1/2 an hour past our reservation, we're starving, and the birthday girl is not having fun -- not cool, Park.The rest of the night was fine. Our waiter was the bomb, and the food and cocktails were quite good. Nothing to write home about, but good, tasty food, in line with their prices. Then we went to dance, and it was your average NYC club scene, although the building set up is nice and spacy.All in all? Probably won't come here again. The food, music, and decor are great -- but I can get that at a lot of other places in NYC without the hassle or attitude.

Our waters were not refilled. The fries were super salty. The only time the waiter checked on us was when he saw us looking around for him so we can ask for the check. When we were ready to pay the waiter, again, he was never around. I got annoyed and just handed the money to the busboy. The busboy eventually gave us our change.

Simple steps to help make everyone more money but I guess they don't care. Another server came by and I ordered a cocktail, the mussels and our meal. The drink and app came but didn't have a check back. Oh well, the food was very good so far. My drink was half left and I definitely wanted another but couldn't flag our server. Why should I flag a server anyway? I would never want to be so rude. Our meals were delivered by one of the many food runners and bussers. I was given a burger with no ketchup and no one asking me if I wanted any, not to mention my drink was now empty and still wanted another. I flagged a busser for ketchup and he got it right away thankfully but I didn't want to burden him with my cocktail order that Ive been waiting to place because frankly it's not his job. Now let me give you a better perspective of scenery. There is an indoor and outdoor area. We were sitting at the first table in the outdoor area so we were right in the mix. Right in front of the entry for staff to see yet my drink was empty and we were practically finished our meals with still no check back. How can you not approach your table and ask if everything is ok especially since there is SO much help with the runners and bussers not to mention the manager I saw walking around the whole time.

This place use to be a garage space and it is hard to imagine any other restaurant in NYC has that much space to provide a cozy fireplace X 2 (1 by the bar and 1 by the back), an indoor garden seating area with nice greenery and a nice view of the highline.  Probably a great place for big parties.  Given their huge space, there was NO wait on a saturday around noon (peak brunch times)- might be a plus for many New Yorkers.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

Ordered a bottle wine, 2 appetizer and for main Steak frites without the fries, medium rare and Chicken Milanese. After 10 minutes waitress came back and told us to be patient, they can't find the wine, bartender is trying to locate it. Appetizers arrived, no wine! Wine came with comment,"" Must be a special bottle"". A Spanish Albarino for $45. Appetizers nothing to rave on. Another 20 minutes for the main. Took the buzzer 15 minutes to clear the plates and took the old and used silverware out of the plates and put it back on the table. Then we seen someone running around from table to table with plates, checking if it is their food. They finally located our table as the recipient after the whole restaurant inspected our food. Steak came with fries and well done. The Milanese was though cold, but OK. Hard to mess up a Milanese. I sent the Steak back as it was cooked too well done and I did not want the fries. So the Manager came over and apologized 20 times. I told him not to worry, just get me a steak the way I like it. He said I personally will make sure. Walking away lecturing all the wait staff for 15 minutes. Shortly after my Steak came back, presented by the Manager himself. I cut into the Steak and the first cut seemed OK. After the second cut I recognized the meat inside was raw and stone cold. I could not eat it, I did not order Steak Tartare. After the waitress came back and asked how it was I told her, that even with the best intention I could not eat it and she said he will talk to the Manager, ...again. Manager showed up again, apologized 99 times and asked if he can offer ""A"" dessert. We refused and asked for the check. What happened now is a first in all my dining experiences around the world.

First of all, who knew that it was so hard to accommodate that many people who want to throw money at your restaurant? The boss' boss' boss' boss told our department to go have dinner on their dime. Their was no limit!Anyways. So a large group, though I thought was fairly manageable, but I guess not. We called around - either we were too late or we could only have a pre fixed menu where you can only choose between like three items per course. Lame.So big plus on ""The Park"" for still having a menu with choices, albeit trimmed down from their main menu.Everything E said was true. The appetizers (small plates) were great - we had all but two of the apps and two of each. That was like 12 apps and we devoured all of it (by we, I mean our semi-split table of ten). We had the mozz, steak salad, asparagus salad, beet salad, crab cakes, and octopus with watermelon. Split pea was the only one that was not so great.The entrees and sides...the gnochhi was good, pizza was cold, fries were average, snow peas were a little overcooked and they didn't unstring them (you know what I mean?), spinach was really salty. Corn looked like a sad grey mash, but tasted better than it looked. The complimentary bread had rosemary in it, pretty great. The burger looked average.It was pretty much a consensus among the table that the cocktails were great (and strong), as well as the appetizers, but the entrees really fell short. Which was kind of a bummer to end the night like that, especially since everything else was going so well.The ambiance is beautiful - we were in the atrium with trees and birds. A little hot being summer and all, and fans only instead of AC, but I loved it there. The service was pretty slow. Understandably we're a large party, but why no extra help?

Our waiter made frequent check-ins.  The food did take a little longer and it was disappointing. mussels in white wine- The only amazing part of the meal. For $12 it came with about 40 mussels. I've had fresher mussels but the sauce was well done. It was not overpowered with white wine, yet it had the right flavoring. They could have gave us more bread to scoop up the sauce. It only came with 2 over toasted break sticks. pastrami sandwich- This was an utter disaster! The pastrami was over cooked up to the point that some pieces were jerky. The bread was also over toasted, probably because it was stale. It came with crisp home-made potato chips which has a nice coating of spice.  chef's braised short ribs burger- Through the description, we were expecting sort of a pulled-beef sandwich. Needless to say, NO! It was a regular burger, nothing exceptional. At least it wasn't over cooked unlike the bun which was over toasted. It came with standard fries that comes frozen.

Once I ran into a group of B and T trash (we're talking big hair, oompa-loompa tanned Jersey Shore) who were loudly complaining that the whole place was like a UN convention.  They themselves didn't seem like much to speak of, but they do have a point. It does get a bit overrun by Asians.And sometimes I just want to kick the ""bros"" who like to stand in the middle of the dance floor holding a beer. Seriously?? You don't look cool, you're not impressing any chicks, and you're in the FREAKIN' way! It's a dance floor, dude. Either dance with the rest of us or get off.But all in all, this place serves pretty well as a fail-safe plan to take a group of people when everywhere else is booked or too expensive.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

The walk upstairs takes you through a really cute lit up ""park"" area. They play a mix of EDM/top 40 songs mashed up together.Overall, it was a good spot for us since we had such a large group, and we could bounce out for KTV early without feeling guilty.

Anyways, went to their bar and ordered a drink while I was waiting. I heard that the hostess was calling out different names, I guess, those people who also reserved their tables and waited just like I did. I thought they would call me when my table was ready, but that never happened. And after an hour I decided to check on that and was told that I needed to come and ask to get sited. Weird...I really liked the atmosphere and nice staff, but I just don't get when you have a huuuge space and place tables so close to each other so you can literally can hear every single word from all tables around you. It is not big deal, but for some people who come their on dates that can be a bit annoying. Ordered a couple of drinks and a couple of pizzas. The food was really good and it was worth waiting. Also, prices are very good. I give this place 4 stars, just because I needed to wait an hour and no one tried to call me when my table was ready, and that the tables were so close to each and you could hear how other people were chewing their food lolI would recommend going there, though :)",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

I love all the greenery and the dim lights at night give this place a very romantic ambiance. It also helps that Artichoke Pizza is basically right next door! I've been here several times and have had fun each time. My most recent visit was on Saturday. My friends and I always hang out at the top floor, as that is the more club-y area. The top floor is kind of separated into two rooms, with one room being a patio area and the other being the dancing area with a bar and some seats. The crowd is anywhere from people in their 20s-30s and it never gets too rowdy or trashy; just good vibes all around. Their drinks are also on the stronger side, at least to me. The DJ was good; I have no idea where the DJ booth is, or if they even have one? But s/he played mostly hip hop, r&b and some throwbacks with some reggae, latin, and EDM here and there. Only problem is I felt s/he changed songs too quickly and too often.

We also tried some of their fancy bevvies - a smoothie with bee pollen, and a mint lemonade, and both were delicious.

She said you can grab your drinks and food at the bar and sit at any table with a ""setting"" in the ""garden"". My boyfriend goes to lock down a table while I head over to the bar to order. The place is big, so its a bit confusing where is what. After a solid 10mins - I finally get the bartenders attentions where I order a beer and glass of wine, and 1/2 dozen of oysters. I let him know we are sitting in the ""garden - and the hostess told us to order from the bar"" he pours me Prosecco - and tells me that I ordered that - when I clearly said Sav. Blanc, whatever its loud, I understand... then he says ""uhh.. yea come back in 10mins for the oysters"" and tells me to ""give him a card for a tab."" Lovely hospitality! NOT After circling the restaurant I find my man sitting at a table. We are weird-ed out by the fact that I have to walk back over to the bar to pick up our oysters. We notice the a handful of servers pointing and chatting about us (at least thats what it looked like - as they were pointing at us)  A server comes over to us and tells us that we can't sit there. We explain to her that the hostess told us how to sit and order and the server looks at us like we have 20 heads and have never eaten at a restaurant before. She exxxxxplains to us in a condescending manner that the hostess was ""new"" and that ""this is not how it works... the hostess seats you etc..."" The servers continue to cackle, point and snicker at us ... we are completely bewildered and want out ASAP - but since the oysters were ordered we didn't want to cause any chaos. We are moved to a table 3ft from where we are seated.  15mins later the server re-visits us and again condescendingly tells me how our oysters were not ready and that ""the bartender will bring you your oysters when they are ready... but that they weren't ready yet"" We get it ... their not ready... and no we're not excited to have the blank staring bartender bring our food over! We finally get our oysters - tossed onto our table. Eat them and ran (after paying our ""tab"" at the bar)! No one came to check on us... no one asked us if we wanted another drink... nothing! Did I mention that the 6 oysters we waited for - we're baring shucked, and we had to peel them out of the shells. They served a fork for the mignonette sauce, umm.. this is a vinegar sauce... !

The upstairs bar looked and sounded packed; I thought to myself, I hope they aren't upstairs.My text: Where are you?Hers: Upstairs.So I trudged wearily up the steps, waited at the bar to buy some liquid tolerance (it was $42 for two well drinks and two tequila shots, which could be worse, but could also be much better), and pushed my way through the crowd to a table in the back. Once there, I did have a good time.  But is it just me?

Years have gone since my crazy clubbing days back in the fancy clubs of Shanghai, and nowadays, I rarely find myself at a dance club or even a rowdy bar. You're much more likely to find me in a small speakeasy or wine bar. However, this Saturday night, I had to urge to go out and a friend of mine was heading to The Park, so I joined. Not at all knowing what to expect prior to coming, I dressed nicely but casually and headed there. It was an easy walk from the subway, and we were quickly ushered into the dimly lit, but beautiful place. The Park, I must say, is beautiful, and I know that I will surely return in the future. Upon entering, there's a small bar and a fireplace with comfortable armchairs. As we continued along I saw there was a downstairs - which we never adventured to - as well as numerous booths with adorable coat hangers along each. And then it led to the backyard. Now that was amazing. There was this huge tree lit with fairy lights, as well as numerous other earthy accents like a tree trunk bench. It was enchanting. Alas, that was not where we were meeting her friends, so we ventured onwards. There was a huge sitting area with couches and armchairs again, as well as a staircase that led up to one of the dancing areas. Here we could more clearly hear the sounds of some middle school classics - from Get Low, to Lean Back - these songs filled me with such nostalgia and got my dorky middle school dancing jam on. The adorable middle school-ness of it all was further highlighted when my friend Sarah's friend from home  - whom we were meeting - began dancing silly-y and a dance circle started form, with some of the men (and women) showcasing their stellar breakdancing skills. All in all it was a great, casual but fun night out in a really beautiful and chill atmosphere. Though the drinks were nothing spectacular, the place itself was really lovely. It was so huge that I never felt very cramped, and it wasn't such an intense dance bar that it didn't afford us the opportunity to talk - and occasionally get hit on by the menfolk there.

Everything was under seasoned and no salt and pepper offered in the table to address that.The most disappointing part is that these issues would be so easy to solve and make this place fantastic!",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

The music ranges from top 40, to spanish, and techno music. There are two floors, so if you ever feel like its too crowded you can always move to a different area. Also the seating is first come first serve, meaning no need to reserve a table just need to get there fairly early to claim a spot. There is also no cover charge, which I appreciate considering it is located in the meat packing district. Drinks can be a little overpriced so I do recommend you pregrame before heading here to dance the night away. I would definitely return anytime and even consider hosting my bday here because it would be a great spot for a large crowd.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

Initially, this place seemed very in demand due to the facade of class portrayed by the waitstaff. I was excited and intrigued by the trees that grow and invade your personal space. Our server was a vivacious gal, who understood the struggles of a common student. She was polite and the only positive thing about this terrible place.A bird was above one of my friends because again, this place was open area, aka the ""park"" as one might call it. The bird shitted on him, and it was to our mutual disgust. The server was kind enough to apologize and provide a means to clean up. But this was a warning of how bad things were to come. The food was terrible. I say this with extreme conviction. It was horrendous and disturbing that food could be made this terribly. It was as if it was taken from the primordial stew of creation and saturated in decay and the suffering of children. A friend ordered soup that was more dilute than deionized water. A veggie burger was very bland and would make a vegetarian quit life. I ordered a burger and was disgusted with the nasty taste it had. It was reminiscent of thick cardboard soaked runoff water. The crudo pizza (tuna) was quite crude. The chunks of tuna were rubbery and magnified how badly pizza could be made.I understand that the city may be expensive but price was the only reason why we finished the meals, but it boggles the mind how this establishment thrives. Are there that many tasteless people in the city that never sleeps?The highlight of the meal was my Coke which washed down the swill of this sepulchre.

Well, the actual restaurant itself is extremely pretty. However, not enough to make up for the service or the food. We had reservations and were promptly seated. Good sign. Then we sat. And sat. And sat. At first we didn't mind, but after 15 minutes of just sitting, with menus down, you start wondering what was going on. There was no water, or anything. Just menus, us, and a bunch of servers talking to each other. It wasn't even that busy. Finally, someone asked if we had been helped. We ordered, the banana bread came out. Things were looking upward. The food wasn't fast but wasn't as slow compared to the wait time it took for someone to even come to our table, however, the food order was wrong. We had ordered the crab benedict and were given a regular benedict. No big deal. What was odd was that we told them there was a mix up. And we were told, no, this is the crab benedict. Strange, as there was no crab patty in the crab benedict. Finally, after more wait, we found a second server, who confirmed that we were indeed given just a regular benedict. She put in the right order. And we proceeded to wait some more. Finally the food came out, and it was okay. A little bland. Definitely not worth all the waiting. We sat some more, had our table cleared of the rest of our food and waited. We asked if we could have our check. Waited. And waited. Finally the check came - they charged us for the crab benedict, no small gesture for screwing up the order or the wait time, whatever, no big deal. Then after putting my credit card down, we proceeded to wait some more to sign the check. So... if you like mediocre food but really LOVE to wait around and kill time, I'd recommend this place.

They had us wait until everyone showed up to seat us, which wasn't a problem since we all arrived on time. We got to sit outside in the garden area with the doors open to the street which was nice. Our server came over for our drink orders a few minutes after we were seated, but for some reason it took her forever to come back and take our food orders (she was quick with bringing out the drinks though). It wasn't that busy in the restaurant either, so I found that a little annoying. The food overall was pretty good for the price. I got a mango mimosa which was tasty and eggs benedict which came with a hash brown. They weren't trying to kick us out either after we finished our food, which was nice because we were all able to chat and relax.

But the bachlorette party i was a part of was busy having too much fun!Ambiance: its probably the prettiest interior concoction i have ever seen- multiple floors, gorgeous breezy layout- literally, breezy: parts of the venue are outdoors, awesome dj spinning latest in pop ( generic stuff), trees in the middle of the venue, i can go on.I really loved the fact that i didnt feel claustrophobic. The random shades of gold lighting was just beautiful at nighttime. Every floor had loungy chairs , drapes- great for groups or even just couples. It is as classy as you want to make it: heels and jeans, fancy dresses, you can probably pull anything off here. The patrons were colorful as well- people of all shapes and sizes, couples, singles, semi-pretentious NY.. but still cool.Service: We just came here to drink. The bartenders were nice, playful and were doign a great job juggling everyone's orders. There are many bars througout the venue on every floor. It really is bigger than i can describe. They also serve food here, even late into the night. Drinks were around 13$ each ( which i kinda expected). I really did not care for the way their drinks tasted. PLUS they are not allowed to make long island iced teas-- ive never encountered this before as this is my go-to drink.  Other PLUS points:-located right adjacent to a hopping pizza joint that seems to be open pretty late- bathrooms were clean ( thank you attendant)- no cover - No line :  ( we arrived around 10, but around mid night the line was huge!)- late night classy food  option ( vs just pizza)Becuase im broke i may need to pregame before hand, but definitely worth another trip into nyc !",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

658,Q8KEm9D4tb42o7MT00DSmA,Sara L.,4.0 star rating,"I'm actually surprised by the number of negative reviews this place has received. When you consider the amount of space this place has, the atmosphere, and the unique decor, it amounts to a lot. There is plenty of potential with The Park, but I assume a part of its problem is that it doesn't know what it is, and it will throw off a lot of people who come here for the first time. Also, the drinks are undeniably on the higher end of the scale. No $5 shots here, but this shouldn't surprise anyone; it's Chelsea after all. If it's over packed, then of course, customer service will certainly suffer at the bar and at the tables.Unless you are here the right time and occasion, this place can be a hit or a miss. A Chelsea gem, this venue offers a great ambiance and backdrop on the right day/night particularly for small to large social gatherings and parties. This venue is rather classy and can be romantic, if the mood is right. The overall construction of The Park is that it's literally like an indoor park with its green house elements. They introduce decorative components such as trees with string lights dangling from the branches, high ceilings, a variety of flora, etc. It provides an oasis away from the urban environment. Glass walls overlook the city streets. They have several different spaces within this venue; The Main Room, The Atrium, The Garden, Red Room and the Penthouse. My particular favorite room is The Garden, which is a room literally built to be an indoor garden.I've been to The Park a number of times already, and each time has been a different experience, bordering on both good and bad. The atmosphere and mood changes depending on what day and time you are here. Go on a Saturday night, expect a douche packed dance club. Go brunch on a Sunday, expect a nice casual restaurant. Go for drinks on Thursday, you may expect a half empty bar. Again, the decor and defining rooms of The Park is one of the strongest factors of it. If you aren't exploring the other rooms though, you may be missing out on a lot of the nice individual aspects of this venue. Unfortunately though, they keep particular spaces reserved for special reservations/parties more often than not. I feel this venue would be best enjoyed when you aren't here on a Saturday night squeezing through a swarm of people and listening to bad music. When it's more low-key in here, and you can casually have your martini at the bar while admiring the ambiance, this place can be quite wonderful. The space is rather large though, so if it's at all empty, you're going to feel that quite readily. If you have a party to plan, a bridal shower, a wedding reception, a birthday party, etc., The Park is a solid solution. Even during the weekends, it's great for brunch. The food is average priced and is not at all bad; a mix of mainly Mediterranean and Italian dishes.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"
659,xKHt5ar26wXaOQ6TfQJAFQ,Janie D.,1.0 star rating,"out for a late dinner with family members ( a party of 6) we chose The Park because we had heard it was quite the place to see. Upon entering i was quite enthralled with the ambiance of the restaurant. It's broken into several sections and each with its own theme. Even a trip to the bathroom will give you a quick step in the past with a few old wooden telephone booths you pass along the way. We were seated right away in a booth style table. It was fairly comfortable and, looking around the room, i was happy to see that the tables were all spread out so you don't feel like you're eating on top of the people next to you. The room was big and pretty loud, but you didn't have to yell to hear each other. A side note: they claim the dress is casual, so we showed up in casual wear. Not that we walked in wearing hockey jerseys and wife beaters, but simple jeans and t-shirts. You could tell by looking at the other customers that there was a "" hoity-toity"" feel. Some Customers were wearing elegant dresses and suits, and to be honest, we definitely got a few looks for , i guess, being underdressed by their standards ( but not the restaurants). anywho..so our waiter came up pretty quick, poured our water and took our order for drinks and starters. Our drinks came quickly. Our starters did not. They weren't bad, they just were slow coming. and about 15 mins later, they came with our dinners.  Mind you, between the starters and dinners arriving, even though ordering our dinner, they didn't pick up our empty plates from the starters themselves. And i will add that we asked for more water twice by then, and kept getting told "" sure"" and "" no problem""..but the water never came. The Waiters all dress in normal clothes, so you don't even know who to ask for service. for all you know, you're about to ask a fellow customer to clear your table for you. awkward.Dinner was okay. I had chicken that was floating in strange green sauce. It said it came with corn...which had been apparently blended into some sort of hummus looking goop. and i probably got about 5 bites off the chicken piece they give you, stripping it to the bone. The steak was fine, but as one of my party said,  you could get a better one at The Outback Steakhouse.  Again, after waiting a very long time our plates were finally cleared...and low and behold, the water finally showed up...and a second drink order. After another drink and some coffee, we finally found our waiter again, and asked for our check. and wouldn't you know it...THAT CAME QUICKLY. Peeking over my boyfriends shoulder to see the damage on the check, we noticed something...!!A WARNING TO THOSE WHO WISH TO EAT HERE!!i don't know if it's done just for parties over a certain number of people, but there is a line between TOTAL and TAXES that is labeled  SERVICE.....don't be fooled....this is gratuity. In fact we even asked the hostess and she confirmed it. Note that there is also a line for TIP. so basically they are fooling you into thinking you have to leave a tip when a !!!20%!!! tip is already added into your bill. it was all clear then, shitty wait service, sub par food..no one cares because they're tricking people into tipping twice.i will add that it was a saturday night and i understand that they were busy.but i will also add that we saw our waiter more than a dozen times, and on several occasions he saw us too, and he never came over to see if we needed anything. it became clear he was straight out avoiding us. Im 30 years old and i have never been to a restaurant before where the waiter didn't at least come by and ask how the food is. Worst waiter ive ever had by far.  all in all....it's pretty and whatnot but they need to make some changes in their cooking, their wait staff and their practices.

Perfect brunch venue that sets you in relaxed-park-mode straight away. I was preparing myself for an iHop standard brunch based on the way the food was described on the pedestrian looking menu.

Something tells me the chef knows butter very well. One of the best free serving appetizers I've had. The egg and toast my friend ordered was worse than iHop standard, the burger with fries was a hearty tasty meal, nothing to scream about. I guess their menu has hits and misses. I recommend sticking with the Chef's Recommendation section of the menu. That's where my waffle was categorized. Others who ordered from the Chef's recommendation section seemed to have pretty impressive looking food served.

If you want the summary:1) Rosemary on everything.2) Food was OVERsalted to the point of hilarity.3) Waiter dropped our ""take home"" food...but still gave it to us. 4) Bird shit.Now, if you stuck around for the long version, well suit up kiddies! You're in for quite a ride!My boyfriend and I went to eat here on a date a while back and I've been meaning to write a review for this place for a while now so here goes.We came here purely on a whim; I actually intended to go to amazing Artichoke next door (this is what happens when you don't listen to a woman :P) but once we glanced in and saw the pseudo-romantic ambience inside we figured why not, right?Wrong.There were a few clues throughout the time being there that shouted to us, ""Nooo! Leaavee! Don't come back!"" but we merrily ignored these-goodnatured omens & continued on our way blissfully unaware, and convinced that an empty restaurant was a sign of good fortune & not warning.The waiter was professional enough, & after he coaxed us into drinking our very own bottled water, served us luke-warm bread with some stale olive oil..that tasted of rosemary. What was it doing on our seedy bread in our olive oil..? No idea but it sure didn't belong there I can tell you that much. Yet, we kept going on positively, thinking, ""Hey, maybe we should keep our minds &palates open!"" because maybe people were into bread that was meant to be fed to birds.Before I review the food I'd just like to say that...I am NOT a picky eater...like AT all. We were recommended the calamari with chipotle aioli & marinara and that was safe enough, maybe a tad overseasoned but the chipotle aioli made up for it. We chose whatever looked safest on the menu: Steak Frites with French Fries and Wood Oven Roasted Chicken with Parsnip, Butternut Squash and Matso. Should be fine, right?Nope.I kid you not, in an almost comical way, the food was so super, super, SUPER salty--that we had no idea what to do about it. Sure, the steak was cooked alright albeit tough, but the rest of the meal tasted of salt & rosemary. It was in both dishes &ruined the taste entirely..I am now avoiding rosemary in every meal like the plague because of this experience. My BF didn't like the butternut squash, parsnip and matso..concoction as well and I tasted it and agreed. A bit weird. Totally not what we were expecting to eat with this fried chicken (that's all it really was).The best part of this night, and I am dead serious when I'm writing this, is us not finishing our food (duh) but we feel bad about throwing it away so I figure I'll save it for when I'm starving or hand it off to a homeless person on the way out or something. What happens next is priceless: as our table is being cleared of all our food&dishes, this one waiter is awesome enough to be able to put ALL of the plates on his arms, but we both were kinda worried because it looked like a shaky set up so we watched him go. While we were sitting in this marvelous garden, we witnessed him--BANG--dropping EVERYTHING he had in his arms onto the floor, with a dejected look on his face (hey, I'd be upset too if I had to clean up all of that mess). As we turn back to our conversation we both wondered aloud, ""He dropped the food didn't he..? You don't think..he wouldn't...give us the food that he dropped and pretended that it didn't happen..right..? Nahh"" and we just shrugged it off and chuckled to ourselves. Lo and behold, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HE DID WHEN HE APPROACHED OUR TABLE 15 MINUTES LATER, CARRYING  OUR FOOD IN A TO-GO BAG, WRAPPED UP AND READY TA GO.I don't know what you would have done; but my BF& I just sat there first bewildered &then we just LAUGHED our asses off. I mean, seriously!? You just dropped all of that on the FLOOR! We SAW you! Lmao! We could not believe it. &while I like to take the easy route and not cause any trouble, my BF at least wanted to say something to the waiter or manager in passing. We tried to do so quietly without causing any disturbance and then we were just going to leave without our food. What ends up happening is the waiter comes OUT to talk to us and says: ""What is ze problem here?! What joo saw was that I dropped the food? We would not give it to you! Oh c'man! You don't trust us?!"" And grins like crazy. No. No, we don't bro.All in all, sure the service was alright despite the mishap and nobody was outwardly rude to us or anything but the food..yech. I'm aware this has turned into beyond an essay, but it needed to be said. I'm not sure of how The Park is on any other night for the food, but for THAT night at least, I was sorely disappointed for the overseasoning. If anyone from management reads this I hope you fix that because there's a lot of potential in that restaurant&I hear the nightclub is ok!

I ended up eating some of my coworker's steak before mine arrived. He ordered medium and got almost well done. Everyone else ordered medium rare but got anything from well done to medium. And ALL the steaks tasted burnt. Like they didn't clean the grill or something. It was so burnt tasting that most of us left food on the table, besides the really big eaters who were starving. At almost thirty dollars per plate you'd think the steaks would be cook as ordered. Or just NOT taste burnt!And a pet peeve of mine: NOT seasoning your steaks!! You at least need a light sprinkle of salt & pepper; anything really! These steaks were absolutely bland.What a waste of good steaks: not seasoning & over-cooking them.Three others in the party ordered burgers and they were decent. One ordered Gnudi (not a misspelling - it's ravioli without the pasta shell?) & she said it was very good. One of the big eaters ordered some pasta also as a side and that was good.Apps we ordered:-Artichoke dip was very... weird. Everyone agreed it was ""not good""-Chicken skewers (2 per stick, 2 sticks per order) that were basically minced chicken in a square shape. We had 8 pieces between 9 people and yet we were forcing ppl to take one, that's how bad they were-A dozen oysters. They're ok, nothing special.

Most notable was the bathroom attendant (a thing I wish they would do away with entirely, nobody likes them) was very rude. I tipped him early in the night. Later on I took a mint from the basket, prompting the bathroom attendant to tell me that ""those aren't free, you know"". I asked how much he would like for one so he just said to put something in the basket. Now it is a borderline shakedown. They are supposed to be there to provide service, not insult. Furthermore we had an issue with how hot it was in the upper lounge so the manager opened the back door. I had to tell three very assertive bouncers that it was ok to leave it open and the manager did it. twenty minutes later they finally agreed. Furthermore, one would have thought the bartender was serving a room five times the size.Drinks are also overpriced but I suppose still within the New York range. I don't really like paying $10.00 for a beer after tip. However, the atmosphere is good and it is a really enjoyable place to go with a large group of friends. Just don't expect the staff to treat you like you are a paying customer.

I went there with a group of friends for a birthday brunch and the selection offered both breakfast and lunch items. I would give this 3 1/2 Stars. It was good food.The second part of the review would have to be about the restaurant itself. The theme is obviously having a meal in the park. They dress up their semi-outdoor section with trees and metal chairs to make it resemble a nice park. The BAD part is that this also means wildlife.           We were seated outside until I requested we be moved in when a bird (of which there are many and seemed to use it to escape the cold) flew overhead and took a crap on the table. When questioned, the waiter said that while it doesnt happen often it does happen. We then moved inside and you would think we were safe, but the two sections arent closed off and birds flew around the rest of the restaurant unhindered. It wasnt until as we were putting on our coats, a friend turned to me and pointed out that I had been crapped on. So for that I give them  0 Stars. That is why the review of 1 Star.

The restaurant is on the first floor, with multiple rooms. There's a nice fireplace you can sit, especially during winter. The dance floor where the club (more like a lounge) is up a long stairs. But warning, it opens at midnight. If you get there too early, you have to wait in the restaurant area until 12am. I wish the club area open at 11pm instead. Then I would give it 4 stars.I didn't get any food here, so I can't really comment on the food. But definitely the seating areas are nice. As for the club, it's okay. The music was good. But the crowd is so-so. Some were dancing, some were more interested at staring at girls. I was here on 12/29. I'm pretty sure most of the guys who were there that night were on the hunt to find a girl to celebrate New Year with. You can tell some were on a mission. I don't blame them. It's pretty lonely being single on New Year's Eve.The positive side, the Asian guys were hot! and this place is very close to Highline.Date idea for you fellas: Take a girl here for dinner. After dinner, take a nice stroll at Highline. Then take a short stroll to get ice cream (if it's not midnight yet). Once midnight hits, ask her if she wants to go dancing for a bit (remind her dancing is a great exercise and this is probably her once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for her to see your smooth dance moves). Return to the The Park and head to the second floor. No cover charge. (Sweet!). When you guys become too tired, head downstairs, rest, talk for a bit. Then take her home.

683,QNKTmlAmneNW76tVfLtMVQ,Liana L.,4.0 star rating,"It's hard to focus on your food when your company is so entrancing, but The Park gently reminds you why it is such an excellent backdrop to good conversation. The outdoor seating is a stunning oasis of greenery, and the impractically high glass ceilings make you feel like you're eating in a modern castle. It is a highly enjoyable place to enjoy lunch in good weather, and I can imagine that it's positively magical for dinner with the little sparkling lights. N. and I split a salad, an appetizer, and an entrée, and we lamented that we could not get sample more items on the carefully-crafted menu. I was surprised by the generous portions for such a trendy restaurant, and we definitely did not finish any of the dishes. Drawn to the exotic allure of the octopus-watermelon-feta salad, we ordered it with great anticipation. Unfortunately, it really didn't come together as well as we had hoped. Each individual piece was great - chewy, firm octopus - and the watermelon + feta combination worked, but overall, the salad would've been better as two separate things. The chorizo and mussels were splendid, and the broth was flavored by both to equal measure. The mussels themselves were plump and juicy, and the chorizo was not as plentiful as the sundried tomatoes (but still there). It was a delight to consume the chorizo and the mussel at the same time. Thankfully, we were able to order a small portion of the gnocchi with pancetta, arugula, and pecorino - excellently textured gnocchi smothered in creamy sauce, yum.

Mine was seasoned really tastefully and wasn't too globby, as gnocchi can sometimes adopt that characteristic. We split the chocolate budino and olive oil ice cream, which was really a treat as well. All in all a wonderful meal- perhaps the appetizer was the worst part for its lack of quality.Drinks: I had the red sangria, which I highly recommend. Presentation was definitely terrible but the drink itself was delicious and pretty reasonably priced I might add. I can't speak for my friend who got the mojito-- all I can say is that it was much smaller than the mojito.Service: Our waitress was very sweet and patient.

The hostesses were very helpful in helping me locate my group's table. We were seated in the garden. Is it pretty? Yes. But the large room felt a bit unwelcoming to me--sometimes smaller places actually have a nicer atmosphere--and at times it was hard to get our server to come over. I thought our server was adequate, but not great, in terms of personality, coming over to check on us enough, and promptness.As for the bird droppings that other reviewers have mentioned, I didn't experience it personally, but one of my dining companions did (it landed on the edge of her plate---luckily not on the food itself). Yikes! I had the ricotta pancakes with blood orange marmalade. They were yummy, but pancake orders are often too big and this was no exception. (My first-choice, the french toast, was ""sold out"" by the time our server came to take our orders.) A couple of my dining companions had the poached eggs over salmon--I didn't try it, but it looked very good, presentation-wise. I also appreciate that the restaurant provides slices of banana bread for the table.I decided not to order the $3 coffee, although I did get a fresh-squeezed orange juice ($4).

That being said, if you are ok with absolutely horrendous customer service and don't mind waiting an unnecessary amount of time to receive your food, then still check it out. The food is lovely and the prices are average for New York City. One the other hand, I wouldn't order oysters as the presentation is outstanding but with the lack of care the servers give to their tables, you will end up with a table soaked in melted ice. When the server finally did pick up our oyster plates, they grabbed our napkins from our laps to wipe down the tables. The puddle below the table was left there. I guess it was too much trouble to use a kitchen rag or something else to wipe the table. With our experience, which happened to be during an option of a prefix menu, we opted to cancel the last portion of the prefix due to having waited so long for the staff to clear our dirty plates. It was late and we were tired. We kindly asked if our desert could be replaced on the check with the cocktails we had on the table as they were comparable in price on the menu. It was just our way of trying to leave quickly. After waiting 10 minutes, our server returned and told us the manager would send over 4 glasses of champagne. We were a bit confused but accepted and quickly asked for the check. Much to our surprise, we were still being charged for the prefix on our check.In this situation there was a misunderstanding between the server and the manager. We asked to speak directly to the manager and what followed was a disgusting attitude from the person who should technically be accommodating the patrons spending over $250. At one point, I was asked to relax and then the manager grabbed my arm in what I hope was a lapse of judgment on his part. At that point, we settled up and left before anything more could take place. I was absolutely appalled with the service at this establishment and I will not be returning. Again, this might have been an isolated experience but overall, slow service, terrible attitudes.

Last Saturday there were a few Tutters and Pop & Lockers who didn't  know what they were doing, but other than that the floor moved pretty freely.  Credit to the awesome DJs!  Their transitions were smooth and they played a nice variety of tracks.  I'd bet money that you'd've heard something you liked.  Just so you know, this is a bit of a pick up spot.  So if you're coming here with your girlfriends just to dance, be aware that you might get pulled over by a prowler or two (That's with any nightlife institution, no?)Anyways, I'm sure I'll be visiting again.  Maybe I'll check the food out next time and update this review.  Know before you go:The parking situation is treacherous.  The earlier you get to the area, the better.  Also, 10th avenue becomes a hotbed of NYPD vans, taxis and black cars after 01:00.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

I was DISAPPOINTED because #1 we were served bad oysters and more than one was bad.   #2 We were a party of 6 and called to see if we could add 2 more.  We were told no and then 4 tables around us sat empty for the entire time that we were there.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

We sat in the Garden which is definitely where I would recommend reserving a table. Tall ceilings with glass windows, plants everywhere, it was like eating inside of an atrium. We came in for an early-ish dinner and it wasn't very crowded at all. The best drink option for a large group like ours was pitchers of sangria. We ordered some red and some white, but the overall preference was for white. Leah E. and I split the lamb meatball appetizer which was incredibly flavorful and hearty. It came with a spiced yogurt sauce that was very unique and the serving size was large. Others in our party ordered salads and other appetizers, all of which they enjoyed. For dinner, Leah E. and I shared the turkey burger and braised short rib burger. These were both rather disappointing. The turkey burger was charred and dry, not something I expected from this restaurant. The short rib burger was just ok, neither of us were impressed. The issue with our entrees being ""just ok"" is that this isn't an inexpensive meal (short rib burger was $16). Overall, loved the ambiance and appetizer, great place for a girls dinner, but the entrees fell way short of expectations for the price point.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

718,VHsL_dqeQm-xs-gcY8B3bA,Sammy C.,1.0 star rating,"I used to be an extremely fond of this establishment, coming here maybe twice a month since 2009. I eventually stopped dining here because I moved but when the moment sprang to take a trip into Manhattan I instantly thought to bring friends. What happened, was not only embarrassing for myself since I chose to come here but completely and utterly disappointing, a waste of time, energy, and money. I made a reservation for 2:00 PM. We arrived at about 2:05 and was told by the hostess they were setting up our table and to take a seat. Fast forward to twenty minutes later I go back up to the hostess and inquire as to what is going on and why the wait. Her response is, ""did you put your name on the list"". Is this a joke? I spoke to the same hostess when I walked in. I politely answered I checked in with her and she quickly sat us (clearly they forgot about our party). This was the beginning to my bad mood. We sit down at the table, and there are FLIES buzzing around, this isn't the end of the world but still, kind of gross. Fast forward to 2:50 pm. No one has come by to take any kind of order nor have we been poured water. I flag down the same hostess from before since we were sitting by the front and let her know the waiter never came. She responded with oh [insert name] is your waiter, she'll be right over she's just busy. No apology, nothing. Then when she does come, my friend who is extremely annoyed points out the fact that we don't even have water and that we've been sitting here for 20 minutes. She responds, oh, well I didn't take your drink order yet so thats why. What kind of nonesense is this? This was when I asked her to please bring the manager. After ordering, it takes another 15 minutes for our drinks to come. More time passes.... food still is not here. I flag down that same hostess tell her that we asked to speak to the manager who never came, she responds she will go get him. When the food does arrive the plates are place on our table very abruptly causing my sandwich to fall off the plate. No apologies. At least we got our food right and would be happy? WRONG. The food was absolutely disgusting. I ate a bite of my blt and put it down, doused in Mayo, the bread was stale, just disgusting. At that point we all wanted to get out of there, to be honest we all wanted to get out of there much sooner but thought if we waited it out something good would come. I was so angry that I wanted nothing more but to speak to a manager and give him/her a piece of my mind, but WHERE WAS THE MANAGER?! I flagged down the hostess again and told her very sternly that I was still waiting for the manager and she assured the manager would come. No one came. We asked for our checks, paid, and left.

720,PG1sGQlkZMjsA_VyiV7jLg,Stephanie Y.,3.0 star rating,"I'd been here once before ages ago with a girlfriend. The service was mad slow back then, and it still is when I came here last Thurs night for dinner with my boyfriend. We showed up early- around 7ish, and had no problems sitting down. Services is really, really slow. Not sure why. The place is really vast. Although the decor is really nice (tree in middle), nice comfy booths, etc, I think this limits how often the limited waitstaff came around. I had to eye our waitress a few times to come over, and she mirrored a look that she KNEW they'd be pinged for being slow. It took 25 minutes to order, 25 minutes to get the food, probably the same amount for the check, so we left cash.As for the menu, there is a variety of good American classic food: burgers, pizza, and entrees. The prices are right too- high teens and low 20s. We started off with a bread basket- which was supposed to be a foccacia, but ended up being more like a salty cornbread. With olive oil and salt and pepper (our preference- after shaking the pepper shaker, we realize it was empty. So, again- slow service and not much attention to each table)My bf got the Chef's Burger- braised short rib, blue cheese, roasted mushrooms and pickled cucumber. Our waitress kept making weird comments that it wasn't made fresh- it's already made. He also asked for it it ""medium rare"", and she said ""oh you don't have much choice, it comes medium well.""  Firstly, that'd crap. And secondly, she didn't know what she was talking about it because it WAS medium rare. LOL. My bf said it was very good- but strong on the blue cheese. The fries that came with the burger were just skinny frozen fries; they weren't hand-cut or seasoned at all. Satisfying but not anything special. As for me, I went with the roasted maple chicken and spaghetti squash. It was good- better than I expected. I'm glad I chose this over the pizza because they were more like flatbreads. The chicken was nicely pan seared, with crispy, juicy skin- it comes on the bone; both dark and white meat. The squash was kind of a boiled mess- good but mostly because it was drenched in butter and this masked the natural flavor. Liked the crunchy garlic atop. The dish also had very blah sauteed brussels sprouts- it was like they didn't even try to mask their natural nasty flavor, except to drench them in oil.Like I dined here long ago, the service is too slow so I doubt I'll be back if I really am in the mood for a good paced meal. It's convenient because it's in a great area, and relatively affordable in Chelsea.

The wait staff is snobby and inattentive, and the bouncer was on a total power trip. Food was mediocre at best... My boyfriend and I ordered burgers which both came cold. On top of the bad food, we received the rudest treatment I have ever experienced at a restaurant. After spending over $100 between the two of us, we decided to just glance into one of the other rooms because as many people have said, the decor is beautiful. We went in one room for about 10 seconds and the bouncer on a power trip aggressively told my boyfriend that he would have to leave immediately because he was wearing sandals without a strap on the back. We explained that we had already been at the restaurant for about two hours and we were just on our way out and he followed us the entire way out and told the person at the door that we were not to be let in again! I couldn't believe it! First of all, the restaurant website lists NOTHING about a dress code (I had checked prior to going there) and second, I couldn't believe that we were being treating like vagrants that were going to try and sneak back in. As if! I completely understand that some restaurants have dress codes, but that should be explained AT THE DOOR not two hours later, causing you to get thrown out like yesterday's trash.

I had the ""homemade"" potato gnocchi and it tasted like Campbell's chicken and dumplings soup with too much garnish on top. Some of the best Italian food in the U.S. is in NYC and this place should either hire a chef that can make Italian food or remove it from their menu. The food was very bland and if there was flavor they are clashed with one another. I could not eat any part of the entree and neither could my partner. The escarole salad was good after one bite. The salad was so sour and tangy from the vinaigrette that it over powered the salad.The dessert ended up being my only meal; an ice cream sundae.

There is a 'garden room' that looks beautiful with live trees and lush plantings. Most of the group had the individual pizza. There are many varieties to choose from and I had the ricotta and basil pesto. It was delicious! Our friends had all different varieties and most people were happy with their choices. Crust was a little soggy, but this isn't Brooklyn pizza. Sitting at another table, some of our friends ordered hamburgers. Our table was done eating by the time their meals arrived. They said the hamburgers were good, but then how do you ruin a burger and why did they take so long? I don't think it was worth the wait. I would recommend 'the Park' if you are in the area, but don't go out of your way.

The dance floor on the first floor isn't that big so its packed with people. Walk up to the second floor if you want to avoid the crowd. You won't get the best ""dace club"" experience here but it will do if you want a mixture of intimacy and fun. What I love about this place is the opportunity to go to a quiet place to talk. Many clubs or lounges force you to scream at the top of your lungs just to hear each other; you need to step outside if you want a conversation.

If you come here for their food, don't expect a fine dining experience. Their food quality is terrible but I guess most people who come here are either already drunk or past drunk where they don't even know what they're eating.  This time around, I just ordered appetizers because I wasn't in a mood for a full meal at midnight. The appetizers included calamari, crab cake, and chicken caesar salad.  The calamari and crab cakes were pretty standard but not stellar. The worst was the Caesar salad. I don't know what kind of dressing they used but it was  way too sour.  After one bite, I was done and was ready to call it a night.  The other sad part is I ordered a Coke and it came in this retro glass bottle but it tasted nothing like Coke. It tasted like they left it in the fridge since the 1950s and decided to take it out.  That's how bad it was. Upstairs, where the real ""clubbing"" happens, is no different. You walk up a flight of stairs and enter into this dark and overcrowded room full of people just standing around.

Hit this place up not too long ago with a friend because we were starving. I saw the inviting outdoor area and fell in love right away. But with the heat and humidity of the day, my friend and I decided to stay inside and let the breeze hit us. The menu also hit us because I couldn't find too much appealing to start off with. Well we decided to stick with the originals (calamari, a burger) and I decided to do something out of the box and ordered one of their large plates of two eggs, with parmesean white polenta and panchetta. Our server for that day was Christian (a cute Argentine) who was just a joy. What I did not  like though was once our food was brought to us (well at least the appetizers) remekins of sauces were so small we got through less than half of our food and they were done. As we dug into our crispy but yet satisfying calamari, my friend ordered herself a margarita and I indulged in the 10th Ave Sunset and Blueberry Hill (this is made with blueberry vodka not over powering just right). As the main entrees came she enjoyed her burger and my eggs with polenta and panchetta were absolutely amazing (even though the panchetta was too salty for my taste). The only con I would have is that the manager walked pass us several times and checked on other tables but didn't acknowledge us or speak until the entrees came or when we needed to check out.

We know how to order at a restaurant, thank you very much, and asked if it was possible before ordering, and we would have been paying the same price.

When they brought our food the second time, they had at least gotten my friend's eggs correct, but I had to send mine back yet again. The second and third time the food was delivered, it was by a manager who was only slightly apologetic. They did give each of us a 25%discount on the food, but I felt like they were not very apologetic and the service left something to be desired.

When we arrived, and checked in with the hostess - we were told we'd have to wait 10-15 minutes. Hmmm...with a reservation? Okay, so we were feeling amiable and decided to just wait. About 2.5 minutes later, I walked up to the hostess and asked if we could possibly sit outdoors once they sat us. This is how the conversation went:Me: Hi, is it possible we could have a seat outdoors once we are sat?Hostess: Do you have a reservation?Me: Yes...I just checked in with you a minute ago...Hostess: What's the name?Me: [Give my name] I just checked in with you...Hostess: Yeah, but I don't remember anyone. Me: *Long shocked pause* Okay, well thanks...You don't remember ANYONE? I'm sorry...but you're the HOSTESS. That's your JOB. To remember the people checking in. And I didn't check in 20 minutes ago with a disguise on, I checked in TWO minutes ago and I've been standing right in front of you. So then we are finally seated...kind of...they end up putting us outside on the sidewalk - instead of in their beautiful Atrium dining area, which was the whole reason we made a reservation there - and giving us a table next to a nursing mother who needed room for her stroller - so we had to awkwardly ask the mother to move the stroller and put her tiny newborn in the hot sun, instead of them just seating us at another perfectly good, empty table somewhere else. There were a ton of them - by the way. When we asked to possibly sit somewhere else, the girl seating us looked utterly bewildered - so we just gave up and sat down.About 8-10 minutes later - we finally get a waiter. The service is so so...the waiter seems confused when we ask him to explain one of their dishes to us.The food was alright. But honestly, after all of that, the food just didn't taste as good as it would have if we'd had great service. I would not go here again, nor would I recommend this to a friend.

If your not from NYC , you should definitely check it out just to see the space.  It really looks like an outdoor park and after being confined to the streets of NY all day...it's nice to have a view of the skyline....I liked the crowd...I would agree that it was more Asian but they are not fresh off the boat asians...they are cool new yorker asians...if that makes any sense...some Wall street looking types...I think there was a good mix of people...I didnt smell any BO , see any sweat and no wierdos who stare at the dance floor all night ..so I was happy.  By 2 am its pretty packed....I left at that point... I was tired and I had to get back to my Brooklyn hotel.   When I left, I saw that there was a line ...didnt look very long...20 people maybe? maybe 15-20 min wait?  Definitely a must do if your in NYC....at least to enjoy a drink and the amazing space....I was pleasantly suprised by the service...none of that holier than thou, stick up your ass,  new york unfriendly attitude.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

I had a guy friend join us late and he called me to help escort him in. I asked a girlfriend to help bring him in.Once we were inside, we went to a bar to get drinks (which took forever since it was crowded and the bartenders were overworked) and the bartender didn't know how to make anything we wanted (while I can't fault anyone for not knowing how to make a duck fart or a dirty girl scout, they should at least know how to make a buttery nipple!). Moving to another bar in the next room was even worse - she was grumpy and unhelpful.

It's a pretty nice looking place with lots of room with different dance floors, bars, and even an outdoor lounge/patio area.  It was kind of cold at the time, but they have heating lamps so people were able to stand outside. And with good reason too. The upstairs has some bad ventilation or something because people were passing gas right inside in that upstairs area before you reach the open outdoors patio area and it was really putting a damper on the night. My friends and I ended up going downstairs to get some air/escape from the smell.The crowd is relatively young and well, drunk. I don't really remember the music which could be a good or bad thing. Probably top 40s. That's the kind of vibe it gave off anyway. Most people were dressed casually but I remember the first time I went there were girls in cocktail dresses and both times there were guys in suits and ties. I didn't really enjoy the other people to be honest, but I did have a good time with my friends. Drinks were kind of priced as expected from NYC, but could have been cheaper.

Trees grow INSIDE, granting the space a degree of serenity that otherwise would be obliterated by (1) its sheer size, and (2) its patrons, many of whom are in various states of inebriation, especially after the dance floor rolls out in conjunction with the penthouse's opening around midnight. The bar is well-stocked, cocktails are mediocre, and the food is fine.I will say, however, that the music was TERRIBLE. Transitions between songs were laughably undance-able, and the speakers themselves should be repositioned or replaced.

Before that I had to ask many times and they kept telling us the wait was going to be long - how when many walk-ins that came after us got seated before us? They couldn't have told me straight up that they just wanted me to keep the reservation? Why is it so hard just to treat us like the other walk-ins, it's really no different.  Unbelievable!

It does have an open area with seating outside by the patio area as well as inside. Their ""club"" is located upstairs with a very tiny dance floor. To be honest, I didn't think it was a club at all but more than just a place to chill with friends. It's more of a lounge so if you're expecting a club, don't come here but if you're looking for a place to just chill and maybe people watch, this place is for you. This place is definitely huge. Once you walk in, they have a huge dining area with bars in both in the front and back of the room. Towards the back, a walkway to the outside patio is open as well. If you follow the stairs up, you'll be directed to the upstairs rooftop. Decor is Asian themed and there is an aquarium with a few fish which wasn't really impressive. Drinks were a bit pricey $12 for stoli and cranberry which tasted like juice. We went here on a Saturday night and maybe it was the wrong night but the place was pretty dead. There were plenty of Asians though but it's in the Meatpacking District so that's sort of a given. Free cover all night which is a plus! I'd come again to enjoy the atmosphere with some friends.

Also the most weird and scary experience that I haven't ever imagined to happen in a restaurant like this.  I was there yesterday around 1:10-2:45pm and had to call the police for my sister's lost iphone which was on our table right before the waitress picked up our check. The iphone was turned off immediately when we called using my phone. Anyway we realized this immediately and asked them to check whether they took the phone accidentally. However, they said they didn't do it and couldn't find it anywhere else. The floor manager came to say not to worry and they would check their security cameras. 15 mins later she came saying they didn't find any thing suspicious from their servers and there is nothing they can do, asking us to leave. I told them that we couldn't leave when we knew for sure her iphone was still in the restaurant, and that we wanted to see the cameras ourselves if possible. However, they kept saying they couldn't bring customers to their back room because the manager didn't allow it. I asked her then we would like to talk to the manager in person. We waited for another 15 mins and they didn't show up at all.  So we called 911 and thankfully NYPD came in 10 mins and we were explaining what happened to two police officers sitting in their car. Looks like the staff in the restaurant got freaked out. The two servers SUDDENLY came out with the lost iphone, saying they found the phone! Strangely THE PHONE WAS TURNED ON now?!I don't know what exactly happened, but my only ""guess"" is that something suspicious is going on in this restaurant (individual-level or team-level), and we wouldn't be able to find the iphone if we hadn't called the police which they didn't expect. (typically NYPD won't come for a lost phone,but we were lucky). Possibly we looked like naive tourists (yes, we took lots of photos), which made us some sorts of easy target.

The waitress will take your drink orders and come back 30 minutes later. And making your way to the bar to get a drink yourself is a workout. Verdict - Decent place to go to with a large group. The dance floor on the upper level is O. D crowded and it's like a microwave in there.

This guy. The Park is one of the only places in NYC where I can consistently guarantee that none of the above will ever, ever happen. First, it's so huge that it's actually overwhelming initially. After getting so used to perfecting my 'throw dem bows' technique to wade through crowds, I was at a loss once I entered and realized I could...actually...MOVE FREELY. There's a bar on the first floor near the front entrance that'll handle your basic beer/shot/well drink needs, and a TON of restaurant tables to crash at with your drinks and company. Proceed a bit further down and you'll find another bar serving specialty cocktails and draft beers with several booths to sit at. Look around and you'll find gorgeous lighting, fireplaces, and climbing vines adorning the walls, making the whole place feel like a sexy, heated outdoor garden.Walk up the winding stairs to the dance floor, where there's a THIRD bar waiting for you with a pretty decently sized space for dancing. The music is solid, and if you get cramped, there's an entire other half to this floor with more standing room, couches, and tables, and it's all housed within a glass framework that, again, gives the space a snazzy 'park' feel. They take their club title seriously. Only downside is that drinks can be a little pricey (I remember paying roughly $9 for a gin and tonic), though they're probably about standard for an NYC club. And considering you're not paying any cover like you would at every other similarly-designed place downtown, it's a fair trade. It's also a little out of the way on the west side, which doesn't make it easy to hop over somewhere else after. My suggestion is to make this a 2nd-stop destination, as this is more of an 'arrive at 12:30-1am and already slightly sauced' spot, so park your ass at The Park and have a great time!",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

We'd just come down off The Highline with an appetite and finally settled on The Park. The host asked us if we wanted inside or garden seating and I said it depends on how warm it is out there. She said very and I said, we'll take it. Once we were seated I understood why it's called The Park. The restaurant is already big, cavernous even, and when you add this great patio that's basically a wildlife refuge, well. Very high ceilings with ways the birds can obviously get in because they're chirping everywhere, invisible in the trees but pecking on the floor beneath you. So, the best parts of the garden patio were not only trees and wildlife activity all around you, but also the fact that the place was heated so well. I refrain from saying too much so because it takes a lot for me to become overheated and this made me very happy. I didn't want to leaveThere were a few distractions. One was the constantly falling leaves in your food and the other was the server trying persistently to sell me a drink. It was annoying and it was pissing me off to the point of telling him to knock it off.I had a bite of the pizza, a thin crusted variety with cheese and spaghetti squash. It was unusual but it was good. I had the seared tuna nicoise and I must say, it was awesome. Way more than I expected both in volume and tastiness.

Nearly FORTY minutes later with no sign of our server we finally waved down another server (drinks had been empty all 40 minutes also) and asked for the bill since our server seemed to have been abducted by aliens and also asked for the manager.

When my friends and I are tired and need a small break from clubbing upstairs, we always come down here and chill for a bit.Upstairs is the clubbing - a fairly large area but it gets crowded like any club. I like that they open up the windows so it's almost like being on a rooftop in the summer, and a nice breeze comes through. The crowd is pretty young, and fairly Asian, just an FYI.

I will start this off by saying...I couldn't stop laughing after it was over...and this was about a 2 1/2 hour lunch experience for 2 people!Arrived to a 15 minute wait when the restaurant was half empty; few servers probably called out sick, it happens.Took about 10 minutes for a bartender to offer something while we were waiting.The 15 minute to get our table wait turned into a 30 minute wait.Got to the table and then it took about 10 minutes to get water and then an additional 5 or 10 minutes to take our drink order and actually get them. My girlfriend's was brought first, and then my beer about 10 minutes later (Guinness should not have hints of Skoal dip).The waitress was very nice and was very good about confirming the order. My girlfriend had a veggie burger and I ordered the Chef's Burger (beef burger with short rib, cheddar and mushrooms). The burger was supposed to come with blue cheese but instead I asked to substitue it for the cheddar. Then we both ordered side salads to come with the burgers and got rosemary fries to share (very good fries).The food arrived about 30 minutes later, my girlfriend's order was accurate, but mine of course came with blue cheese. I then told the server that I would like a new one without blue cheese and I specifically asked to make sure that it was not just scraped off, but a new one was made. The new burger came back with a half melted cheddar cheese piece and blue cheese still on it. Here was the kicker, the blue cheese was still also scraped onto the plate, it literally looked as though the burger was picked up, scraped on the edge of the plate and a piece of cheddar put on the remaining burger.Had to send it back and when the new burger came back (over cooked) fries were on my plate instead of my salad!At this point we finished eating and then asked for the check. I thought I was in the clear and on my way out. But NO, there was something incorrectly charged on my check and that took another 10 to 15 minutes to get sorted out before I could actually pay and leave.The manager was present on the floor and did stop by the table after the billing portion was being corrected, but instead of offering an apology for the delay(s) she made excuses!

Beautiful atmosphere, but we slowly became aware of a disgusting problem. Although we could not see any movement, there were birds living in the trees inside the restaurant. They probably got in there because they leave the doors open to this space in warmer weather. That means the birds were probably in there for several months. WELL... first my husband was hit by bird droppings but thought it was something off the ceiling because we couldn't see any birds. I was then hit in the arm with droppings, but still we were uncertain what was going on. The bottom line was that I was hit at least 2 times and my husband 3 times, but it could have been more. We were really concerned that something would drop in our food. We asked the waiter if there were birds, and he immediately said yes and offered us dry-cleaning coupons. After it happened again, the manager came over and said they had been trying to get rid of the birds. He wound up taking my food cost off of our tab, but that wasn't really enough to make us less disgusted.It was impossible to move our party since we were 9 people. Seriously, call an exterminator. It seems like this would be a health code violation. I have never had this happen to me before, even when eating outside.  Besides that, my butternut squash lasagne was mushy and had no flavor but parmesan cheese.

The burger did not look or taste good. The food at The Park is in my opinion just really overpriced bar food. What you are really paying for is the great space and setting. The only reason this place got 2 stars is for the actual restaurant itself. Came here late at night for drinks and to party a few times in the past and had a good time.

But can you build a meal around bread and fries alone?  Probably not.  I say if you are just looking for a good meal, Cookshop down the street is a far superior option for food, and the pizza at Artichoke will likewise do a far better job of satisfying you than the Park.  But then again, Cookshop and Artichoke don't have DJs and a dance floor.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"
847,kQJO8mj0HD3sF_JsDmS8Xw,Carolyn S.,4.0 star rating,"This is a great place to go for lounging and getting drinks with friends.We arrived on a Friday night around 1-1:15. There was a short queue to show ID and get in, but then once we were inside, we saw that the place was not packed at all. It's clearly huge - there are numerous seating areas (indoor, outdoor, downstairs patio and upstairs porch). By the time we were there, the party was clearly upstairs. There was top-40 type music playing (although it switched to random classics around 3 am) and people dancing as well as sitting around in the chairs.We grabbed some couches on the porch (after grabbing our drinks). The best thing about this place was that although there was great music playing, it was really easy to carry on a conversation with friends, unlike some clubs or bars, where you have to choose between dancing versus talking. I would say that if you're looking for a real clubbing experience, Park probably isn't the place. It's great for hanging with friends. If you want to dance, you won't feel awkward about doing so, since there were plenty of people dancing around, but it's not compulsory and there is no either-or choice to be made.We were there on a really rainy evening, and the upstairs porch was such a cool place to be. With open-air views to the trees and city buildings beyond and rain pounding down on the roof on a hot night, it felt like a little bit of Hawaii or the tropics in NYC. I also thought the people there were a great crowd. Everyone was just there to enjoy themselves. It wasn't filled with wannabe models or groups of jockish guys. It was just groups of friends there to have a good time. Overall, I enjoyed it and would definitely go back.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

The garden is a pleasant change from most Manhattan establishments. It also happens to be one of the only quiet restaurants in the whole damn city!

I've been going here for years and it's declined in quality and service.The food is now bland, lackluster and simply not well thought out. Even simple things that I've ordered in the past- like artichoke dip- is now some bland puréed mess. If you really want to have a laugh, order the crab cakes. Crab Cakes? If the three tiny marbles of deep fried shredded crab on the plate weren't so ridiculous that I had to laugh, I'd actually be pissed.The pastas were bland. The pizza was doughy. And the service... Ugh. The waiters are just plain snotty. Can't get plates cleared off the tiny tables ever (I finally had to put a dirty plate on the floor). We got to order drinks and appetizers fairly quickly, but it took 45 minutes after appetizers arrived to be able to order our entrees and more drinks. And even then we had to actually call out and wave our arms around for quite some time to get our waiter's attention.One last thing- I love the garden atmosphere but I don't love bird poop on the menus and on the table.It's sad really.

When we got there, all of a sudden they told us there would be a $60 charge for the cake we brought because they charged $3 a person since we were using their ""silverware and china"". I told them nobody informed me of this but they insisted that I was given this information over the phone. After speaking to the manager, he first asked if I could pay half of that price and when I still said no, he said fine he would wave the fee.All of a sudden SEAN the general manager comes over to our table and yells at us in front of everyone that he was taking away half of our table since our entire group had not arrived yet. There were many tables still available and yet he NEEDED specifically our table. We told him to give us 1 minute so we can call the rest of our friends who were arriving together to see where they were and he said ""no! You don't get what i'm saying.

We didn't even have water or enough plates or glasses at our table. Finally, I flagged down a hostess passing by and asked for some water, and she rudely walked away. We saw her fighting with someone in the back and pointing at us. About 10 minutes later, a flustered waiter finally came by and apologized, saying he didn't know we were his table. Apparently he had forgotten the table of 8 next to us as well. This meant that he was trying to take 12 drink orders from 2 different tables. He brought us water but ran away before we could order cocktails, he forgot to bring the additional cup and place setting, and when he finally did return to take the drink orders he said that it would be awhile for the drinks because he just put 15 drink orders in (because he forgot the table next to us). It was a bad start, but we were willing to keep an open mind since it was an accident.Unfortunately, service was bad throughout the process.  We did receive our food quickly (before the drinks eventually came out), but the burger we ordered was so underdone it couldn't even be considered rare. The pizzas were good (goat cheese pizza and italian sausage pizza). It took another 15-20 minutes for them to bring the re-cooked  burger back out, and during that time we saw another lady nearby send back her burger.When our friend got her drink (she ordered some jalapeno drink) she mentioned that it was really spicy. At that point we had to pass it around the table, and we were all shocked. It was pretty much un-drinkable. It burned your mouth as soon as you took a sip and continued to keep it numb and tingly for 10 minutes after each sip. WAY too much jalapeno, even coming from the spicy-food lovers.We finally got through our meal and got our check. I was a little disappointed they made no attempt to make up for their mistakes (we were still charged full price for everything, including the burger that wasn't done), but the tipping point was when the manager stopped by later to return the check and asked how our experience was.We were honest and said we had some problems, and explained our experience. He literally laughed in our face at all our complaints, and in the end said 'Well I hope overall it was an okay experience' then walked away!!!We were so embarrassed to have taken our friends to this place, and we wanted to love it. Throughout the evening we were saying how we were going to give it another chance, maybe on a weeknight when it's not quite so busy, but after we left and talked about it, we realized that was one of the worst restaurant experiences we've ever had. Not sure if I'll ever be back, and I DEFINITELY won't be bringing friends.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

But i believe that big part of success of any place in high competitive New York scene depends on service. Unfortunately this place completely failed this part. And after really poor service you ending up with forgetting all good experience. We came there today with few more girls for a birthday dinner. We were waiting for the waitress for very long time each time we needed her. They simply vanish there when you need them. And maybe I am subjective but they were sort of sarcastic about all our pretty regular requests. First of all our birthday girl had flowers and we asked for some bucket with water for it. It turned out a big deal. When we needed bigger plates for our entrees that we were sharing, they just brought a pile of plates and pile of napkins and put them on the table, we were supposed to grab them ourselves. We also ended up wiping dirty table ourselves too and taking fresh silverware and more napkins from next table because nobody ever came to assist us. When the food was coming they were randomly putting it on the edges of the table, not in front of us in the middle. It all was very weird, almost looked like its all on purpose... Almost funny, but sad...I am not a spoiled person and i love giving generous feedbacks and maybe its all little things but dont little nice things make the whole pleasant experience???

My friends and I joked that the upstairs is for the poor, decrepit crowd and downstairs is for the rich snobs because that's where the air-conditioning was frigidly blasting. This past weekend, I went with a few friends to celebrate someone's birthday. The first group of us got here rather early (before 11pm) to find just a few clusters of people upstairs and found seating for all of us in the cushioned wicker ""couches"" and just sat around chatting while we waited for the rest of our party to show up. There wasn't any music playing, which surprised me, but I guess it made it easier to converse.Around 11:30, they dimmed the lights (a little too dark for me, but I guess it's better - enhanced beer goggles without the beer?) and a dj started playing some music. He gets a C+ in my book because he'd play some awesome songs and then play something dull to kill the mood and then go back to the good stuff. It was a buzzkill for me at times. After a while, the crowd got bigger and bigger and then we all suffered from heat stroke because there was seemingly no ventilation at all. I was a sweaty hot mess but there was one guy who wore a grey button down (with white collar and wrists - think Lumberg in 'Office Space') who was completely drenched and he kept bumping into people (and me) and grossed me out to the point of making me tell him to please try and control his movements and not touch me. I know, I know, princess behavior, but EWW. Our group lucked out because we found a little corner where some ventilation was working and we all took turns sticking our faces in the cool air so I didn't end up dying, like I usually do.Drink prices were surprisingly okay, I thought. It was $10ish for each cocktail I got.Overall, it's a sort of fun place. The music is Top40 and good for dancing (most of the time) and the crowd is mixed.

I don't remember any problems the first time, but in reading some reviews I did not want to be seated in the garden because of the birds. When I got there, they were setting up our table in the garden, and we decided to take it even though I was hesitant.  Sure enough, not long after we sat down, birds started crapping all over our table.  They crapped on my napkin, in a couple of my friend's drinks, on a plate of food, on a friends jacket, and possibly more that I can't remember.  My friends were such good sports about it but I was mortified and embarrassed.  I completely hyped up the place to my friends and now they were sitting there getting crapped on left and right at my birthday party.  The staff was nice about it, replaced drinks and food for free and offered to pay for my friend's dry cleaning, but still.  It should not be part of the ""dining experience"" in the first place.  The food also took incredibly long to come out (maybe 45 minutes), and then when my friends fries were ruined by the birds, she had to wait another 15 minutes to get a new plate of food while we were all almost done our meals.  They explained that they were trying to get rid of the birds, but this place didn't open yesterday and there have to be better measures they can take.  The food was just average and I knew that already. I really picked the place for the atmosphere and it's a shame because I really like how it looks in there and it's great for taking pictures.  But I can't see myself eating there again, and if I do I will not sit in the garden while eating.",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

Maybe after drink 4 (I will think) I'm ready for a stiffer drink, but not at numero uno. We ordered crab cakes for appetizers, which looked like deep fried store bought cakes swept with mayo and shared a turkey sandwich/ burger (I was too turned off by the cutlery and presentation to order my own meal).

There was many different levels to go to, each with different bars and challenges, and you reach each level by climbing up steep cement steps and steel barred staircases, which are difficult for Luigi and myself in heels to climb.This place was good because it was huge and the decor was AMAZING. The ceilings were at least 30 ft tall with beautiful foliage, dark wood, white lights and branches everywhere. Also this place has *live birds* I am not sure if this is planned or not but they definitely gave my partner a shock when they flew right by his side. The decorations and architecture are wonderful, hence the 4 stars. PLUS what other bar gives you real live native birds?! I'm not an avid bird watcher but I definitely believe I spotted a robin and 2 finches throughout the night.Oh plus they have a great set up and space for a natural dance floor and played above average music, except for the occasional whining of Adam Levine.The reason it did NOT get 5 stars:-it was terribly organized downstairs in terms of bartender/waitress communication. We were hanging out at the bar and I asked the bartender for a drink....and then was reprimanded by a waitress who made me order drinks through her, which slowed the process of us getting drinks.

The only good thing about The Park is that it's one of few nightlife spots in the city that doesn't charge a cover - which is probably the reason why so many crappy people end up gaining entry here. And unfortunately why I always inevitably end up at The Park when I'm hanging out with friends. The first time I came here a few years ago, I was deeply impressed by the leafy decor, which The Park's name is indicative of. It's really beautiful! It's a big place, too, so it never gets so crowded that you're being pushed and shoved every which way. The drinks are priced okay, considering how fancy this place looks. Their appetizers are decent, but maybe I need to come back here in the daytime and eat an actual meal. Those are all the positive things I have to say.Okay, to be fair, I guess it's not really The Park I dislike so much as the behavior of its patrons, but after awhile they kind of become one and the same. Maybe it's just me, but I don't need to see people dry humping in the middle of the restaurant, not even on the ""dance floor,"" which is just a small room on their ground level. Last time I was here they had a DJ playing all top 40 hits, not even mixing stuff. Can I get that job, please? I'd have a lot more money to spend on Yelp-worthy food if all I had to do was hit ""play all"" on my iTunes playlist.

At least help me find my friends first! Gosh. Everyone says that the drinks are moderately priced. Yes - for meatpacking. But I think it be wise that people pre-game else where and then go to Park. If you're sober and you go to park - well if you're female better get tons of guys to buy you drinks. It's definitely a nice chill spot with a decent group of people.

I've had watermelon/feta salads, I've had grilled octopus but never the two together, but I must say it was delicious. They dish was perfectly balanced in flavor and everyone at the table loved it. We would've ordered another 2 but wanted to leave room for our main dish and dessert.I had the salmon dish which was lovely, the waiter told me the chef recommended medium & I see why, kudos for the recommendation, double kudos for the flavor! It was paired with white beans & a heavenly green colored sauce? It tasted so familiar, yet I have no idea what it actually was but it tied the dish perfectly together with its rich buttery taste. I did get a chance to try the chicken but it was a little bland for me, however it did come in what looked like the same sauce so I'm sure it flavored things up. Now dessert, (my mouth is watering) the fried banana wontons?! are you kidding me?! why have I lived this long without trying this?! ok no more question marks & exclamation points, but I hope you realize how delicious & different this was. They were crunchy little wontons filled with warm banana slices and came with a caramel & chocolate dipping sauce. Sooo glad I didn't skip on dessert this time.We also ordered the smores dessert, which was a cup layered with chocolate  & marshmellows, accompanied by graham crackers. Although it was also very good, the banana wontons stole the show.Our waiter was very helpful in explaining the ingredients in the some of the dishes & made sure to check up on us and refill our glasses. Even the runners were affable and I loved that they didn't ask who ordered what, they knew exactly which dish belonged to which person.There are two reasons why I didn't it give 5 stars...First, was the hostess.. We were the last two to arrive, so 4 of our party had already been seated. We walked in and usually it goes ""hi do you a have a reservation?""... but instead it went more like .....(silence)..... ""hi I have a reservation.."" She then proceeded to point where our party was. I could've had my friends text me ""we're sitting by the back"" and it would've been about the same amount of guidance. Don't know what her purpose was exactly.The second, was my friend mentioned they saw a rodent in the area behind us with the trees and shrubs. Now normally I would think it was a joke but past posts seem to confirm that it is in fact a normal occurrence. Not that I think the kitchen or the place is ""dirty"" & I understand its probably with the plants and open space but I was uncomfortable from that point on considering my back was 1 inch away. Please do something about that, it makes a wonderful place less appetizing.I'll definitely go back but I'll opt for indoor seating lol",The Park,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Cocktail, Bars"

At 9 PM, the hostess told us that her manager had just said that there were going to be no seatings for another hour. When I asked the reason why, she just shrugged her shoulders. I've worked in the restaurant business for years and was shocked at the rudeness and by the fact that the manager himself didn't even come over to apologize or explain much less offer a complimentary drink or appetizer.

Sometimes really great and sometimes just ok.  The space is wonderful.  I love the fireplace right in front of the first bar area (I think it's currently under construction). I like sitting at the bar and having a good meal.  I like getting my groove on in the back room, on the occasional night I feel like coming here after work.The times it has been just ok for me unfortunately, I hate to say it, is because of the crowd. Almost every single time I have been to the Park, I have sat next to or been at the bar next people trying to get things for free!! Listen, I understand this economy is tough, but if you don't have the freakin money to order drinks in a Chelsea bar (ie more expensive than a regular one) or don't have the money to tip, please, Don't Go Out! Saturday was no different. I was with a few of my girlfriends, and there was a table next to us that was really just unhappy from the moment they walked in. They complained about their server, they complained about their food, they asked for management, etc, etc. When a manager came  over, he was hanging with them, chatting em up, asked them if they wanted their server changed out, he actually spent some time with them to make sure they didn't leave unhappy. He gave them his card and said next time they come in, he'll make sure they get taken care of. Instead, I find that they used his card to bad mouth him on Yelp...Well, they ordered a round of drinks from him and expected it to be comped. Long story short, it eventually was...Every single time I have been here, Tighe (the manager) has been by my table or the bar to make sure things have gone well and to make sure I was happy.  He's a great manager and genuinely cares that people have a fabulous time.

And once we got in, there was TONS of room inside. Gotta love bars trying to give the impression of being exclusive. 2) Drinks are pretty overpriced. 8 bucks for a bud light bottle, and 10 or 11 bucks for a crappy well drink.

Come on! The Wild Wild West? Ok, I think I killed the joke.] But last week, my friends decided to host a bachlorette party there. The decor is lovely. I'm not so sure about the birds flying around though. Yeah, they have a lot of trees with artificial bird nests. So the thought of feathered creatures hovering or dropping things over your head or food makes me want to take a star away. Star away.However, if you want a ""park"" experience [I suggest a picnic at Central Park, but you're fancy, so you chose this place], I suggest to go around the time during sunset. And if you're not sure when sunset will happen, go check at Google. During sunset, the birds go crazy. They start chirping to each other to announce it's bedtime. When the sun sets, you won't see the birds. See, a ""park"" experience. All my friends, including the bride-to-be, enjoyed the food. It was kind of hard to talk to one another given that we were seated in one of their long tables. But that was better than sitting next to the bar with loud chicks (so many reference to poultry here) and music. The food was fresh and delicious. Although, one of them ordered the roasted chicken and that reminded me of the ones that flew around our table. Hm...We ordered the garnelli with bits of shredded beef, even though they call that short ribs. Mushroom pizza. Butternut squash ravioli. The salads were expensive and not worth $10-13 for them. As for service, I think our waiter was very patient. And he would check up on us to make sure our water bottles were filled. (I know, such a sober evening. No, wait, I had a Blue Point. Not bad. It has a crisp apple taste to it.) He even helped take our pictures with two, three, and maybe even four cameras. (What can I say? My asian friends have a thing with showing off cameras and taking ten thousand photos of the SAME people.) We were probably the most annoying group there. That or people thought that we were celebrities with all the bright flashes.   Just make sure you check the bill. My sober friend saw that they charged us twice for the calamari.

At the beginning of the meal we ordered some appetizers along with our entrees. The appetizers came out and we realized the calamari we ordered never got sent to the table. We didn't say anything because we were satisfied with the amount of food we had already. At the end of the meal the check showed the $10 calamari dish. The total bill was around $800. We told the server we never got the dish and he said he would remove it from the bill. THEN the ""general manager"" came to the table and started accusing us of trying to steal the calamari and that the kitchen says they sent it out. We explained to her the situation and she told us she needed to review security camera footage to see if we were lying or not!!!! WHAT!?? What general manager would ever do this? $10 on a $800 bill-she's crazy. I confronted her about how my group and I felt insulted that she was accusing us of such things and she continued to give me an attitude and tell me she was verifying what the kitchen told her. I don't care what the kitchen is saying we never got the calamari- believe us!! She came across as threatening and hostile during this whole situation. This woman's extreme lack of customer service is the reason why I will NEVER return to this establishment.
