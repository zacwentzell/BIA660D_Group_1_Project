It's a little out the way as it's between Hamilton Park and the road that leads into the Holland Tunnel, but it's worth the trek in my opinion.

Service is fine, the staff aren't chatty or particularly friendly but they are swift and efficient - this isn't a fancy restaurant but it's a pleasant, functional space that's always busy, with a mostly Vietnam clientele.Food comes out of the kitchen as and when it is cooked so you will most likely get everything served all at once or in a random order but it's always piping hot and freshly cooked/preparedThe menu is big and everything that I have eaten here has been delicious. The spring rolls are a must, some of the best, if not THE best that I have ever had. Summer rolls are great, as are the grilled pork chops, the Vietnamese coffee is so good - in short everything is good, very tasty with fresh clean flavors.

It gives off more of a Asian seafood restaurant vibe than a viet restaurant! I just wish it smelled a little better! I've only ordered the pho bowls from there, #1! It literally comes out within 5 minutes, so if you're in a hurry, it's perfect for you! The portions are very generous and the broth is very flavorful.

For starters we ordered the fried egg roll that was served with lettuce and sauce on the side that was delicious and savory. The lettuce that you wrap around the egg roll was fresh and the egg roll was nice and crispy. My favorite dish is the rice vermicelli with spring rolls and grilled pork that came with a side of lettuce, cucumbers and fish sauce. It was so delicious and flavorful and yet so very light. I tried some of my uncles pho and the broth was so good that I wanted more but I was too full from my own meal.

7,Fz94pa_rqBfmmYyU39jjHA,Terri C.,4.0 star rating,"This Jersey City Vietnamese restaurant is right by the Holland tunnel. Unlike most other Vietnamese establishments I've been to, this one is quite spacious. We ordered pho, spring roll with vermicelli noodles, grilled pork with rice noodle squares and summer rolls. The pho and summer rolls were decent but not much better than other places in Jersey. The springs were good, crispier than most.  The star of the night was the grilled pork. In most Vietnamese restaurants, the grilled pork (usually called bbq pork) is too chewy, fatty, sweet or all of the above. Here, the grilled pork was very thinly sliced, not at all sweet but had a really nice charred and grilled taste to it. It was lean yet not dried out either. Portion sizes are generous. I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to come here again but if in the area, and not crossing the tunnel to NY (let's face it, there are too many good options in Ny), I'll probably stop in.",New Thanh Hoai,3.5 star rating,$$,"Vietnamese,, Seafood"

42,0MI1BlemQv2HoAl5ITW6QQ,Jeannette L.,4.0 star rating,"I've been going to New Thanh Hoai for years - both at the current location and the old spot on Newark Ave. So it's never going to be like how it was back in the day, but it's still a good spot to get solid Vietnamese food. One perk of the 10th Street location is that it serve both alcoholic drinks and bubble tea, which it did not before. NTH has a good selection of Asian beers and it makes a pretty mean bubble tea. :)The food hasn't really changed; it's still tasty. Maybe the spring rolls got a little smaller, but they are just as delicious as ever. I go with the vermicelli noodle bowls - the grilled shrimp one is my favorite. With my vegetarian boyfriend, we can also order off the vegetable section towards the back of the menu, so he has some satisfying options at New Thanh Hoai, as well. The restaurant has a lot of room and seating inside, with a dining area to the left and a bar area to the right once you enter. I've never had to wait for a table. For the most part, service is fine. The food comes out fast, but you may end up waiting a few times for the bill. (If you really need to leave, I just walk up to the register and ask for the bill). So the place used to have a parking lot for customers that was closer to the restaurant, but NTH had to move to the parking deck on 9th and Congress. In order to use the deck, you have to call the restaurant for them to open the gate. There is also street parking.

Moving out to NJ from CA, I definitely missed having a plethora of options at my disposal for Vietnamese food. I have dined here on average of once a month over the last two years, and still crave it all the time. -Ca kho to with salmon was an interesting choice of fish, but it definitely works. They even serve it with dua chua (Vietnamese pickled cabbage) on the side, which made me feel so at home!! It felt like my grandma made it for me! Major props. Seriously, they've got the carmelization down! I have had ca kho to at other vietnamese restaurants where the sauce is super liquidy and runny instead of carmelized into a thicker sauce, but New Thanh Hoai does it right!-Pho really hits the spot every time I get it, no matter if it's hot or cold out. -Ordering the bun bo hue here was only the second time I have ever eaten bun bo hue that was not made by my mom, and it was a very beautifully executed but bo hue. The depth and flavors are totally there.-Bun rieu was good, but not my favorite.-Rau muong is my favorite vegetable, and I was thrilled to see it on the menu! Delicious!-Banh cuon was also surprisingly delicious!! All the toppings were there, which is a pattern I'm noticing with every dish I order here. All the accoutrements that accompany each dish is served accordingly, and it makes it feel so thought-out, authentic, and home-y. Boba wasn't the best.

If you can't find parking around the restaurant, head to their parking lot--it moved to 9th and Erie. The interior is actually pretty nice, and looks like it could fit quite a few people. My group got a window seat next to the bar, which was perfect. Their menu is huge and the prices are very reasonable.Fried Calamari: Light, crispy, and very tender calamari with plenty of onions and green onions thrown in. The murky orange-ish sauce that comes with it does not match at all. It's supposed to be a ""garlic sauce,"" but it did not taste like garlic at all (no, I'm not talking about nuoc mam).Bun Bo Hue: If you're expecting blood cakes in your bun bo hue or bun rieu, you will be disappointed (as I was). Someone uploaded a picture of both with blood cakes, but I did not get any at all when I was here for lunch. The broth is very light in color and no where close to spicy, but the richness was perfect! The gio heo was very tender; not fall-off-the-bone soft, but close enough. They were also very generous with the cha gio and noodles. However, I'm specifically asking for blood cakes next time.I paired my food with a durian shake, and thought it was fantastic. The durian flavor is evident, but it isn't as strong as eating the fruit itself. I didn't try the other dishes, but we also ordered goi cuon (""summer rolls"") com tam (broken rice with pork chop, egg omelette, shredded pork skin, and sliced vegetables) and the XL pho.

The waiter tried to explain what it is and didn't want to bring me something else. Then I said please do me a favor and give me coffee because I cannot drink this. He brought me coffee but I ended up getting charged for both drinks. I talked to the owner and he started arguing with me over a $3 drink. He accused me of drinking half the drink and wanting a free drink. I told him that this is such bad business and that it's not right. I spent $20 for a meal by myself and they didn't want to do the right thing by their customer. He started saying how he's not going to make any money this and that. I was so disgusted. I'm sorry, I'm not being cheap, but you should not force your customer to eat strange things in their drink. I'm Vietnamese, I can make this food at home, I actually like the food here.

My coworker ordered the beef cubes with fried rice.  No lie 7 mins later our food comes out and it looked amazing.  The first bite of the Pork chop reminded me of the shish kabob Pork on a skewer.  Very tender and tasty.  The fried rice that comes with it was very light a little table spicy chili sauce on it and now it's even better.   My coworkers beef cubes which were so tender and delicious.  It was so good I invited my parents to try it for diner. My mother is very pick what I orders at lunch, the grilled pork chop and fried rice. Omg those pork chops r so tasty.  The spring rolls taste good too they had a similar taste to fried wonton.  Then I came back for dinner with my parents. I ordered the Pho and wanted to try the snapper but I didnt want to have it all by my self it looked so good. I decided on the egg rolls and griped pork. It was ok but the pork chops were better. My mom who is very picky loved the grilled pork chops as well.    And the Phò was Phò-nominal!!!! Lol. I definitely loved it a little better then both Thai and Chinese food.

That's fine on a nice sunny day, but on a cold wintery and rainy day...not fun. Though, the pho was a nice reward for that long walk. My group of three ordered three bowls of the Tai Nam Gau Gan Sach and a small order of Cha Gio, which comes with 4 egg rolls. The pho was tasty that day. My Vietnamese friend who goes there often says sometimes the pho isn't as consistent. But the day I went the broth was delicious, especially with a lot of lime, and the noodles weren't too soft or clumpy. Wish it came with more tendon and omosa though.The Cha Gio was okay but I've had better Vietnamese egg rolls elsewhere in NJ. They have the blistery version. I prefer the wheat based wrapper which produces a smoother skin after being fried. The best ones have filling with bits of carrots other interesting textures. This filling was just a slab of ground meat. The restaurant space is huge, so no worries about a wait here. They have an upstairs, second room, and huge room that loops all around the first floor.

We puked, stayed home from work and cancelled plans because we consumed something that touched their hands and plates.Somethings that may have contributed to our own unique experiences there:1. When they bring the pho soup/food plates over, their thumbs are always dipped into the food. These are the same thumbs that hold the dirty plates and wipe the rags off the tables. 2. They like to be efficient and spray the cleaning spray to clean the tables as quickly as people leave the table, regardless of who is sitting close by. The end result is you inhale and consume some of the spray in your food. 3. We have seen flies and bugs inside. 4. New employees (at that time) that seemed to be poorly trained and doing everything from holding rags to touching the food. We used to frequent this restaurant so we were familiar with many of the faces. Unfortunately the new faces were the ones we saw a lot of issues with. My husband and I took a one year break from eating here and have been fine. But recently a friend got sick from also eating here confirming  again it was this establishment that caused our pains. So please, while you may be craving that hot bowl of pho, or delicious plate of sausage and pork chops, think about the risks you are taking when you eat their food. To the establishment: Please train your staff appropriately. Please take care in the cleanliness of your food as it is consumed.

77,pz3Ulbuk7ZiUUbT7oFzmpA,Lori L.,3.0 star rating,"It took me a while to make my way over to New Thanh Hoai, but when a friend and I found ourselves in the Hamilton Park area, it was an easy dinner decision. The restaurant is one of the few that serves Vietnamese in downtown Jersey City; it's probably also the largest and busiest as well.Even on a Sunday evening, the venue was bustling and most tables and seats were filled with guests. Choosing to skip the wait, we opted to sit at the bar... and were left completely unattended. When we were finally able to get menus (+5 minutes) and glasses of water (+ 10 minutes), I was starting to see what prior reviewers meant when they noted that service was not the strong point here.If you can overlook the near non-existent service and the constant clattering of dishes and glasses as the staff clean up tables in your vicinity, New Thanh Hoai is well worth the trip just for the quality of the food. The Cha Gio (spring rolls) were some of the best that I can recall having; a perfectly crispy and thinly-rolled shell enfolds a dense filling of well-seasoned ground pork and vermicelli noodles. Wrap in a fresh lettuce leaf and dip into the sweet-spicy nuoc cham served on the side, and you have a perfect bite - as long as you don't burn the roof of your mouth.The Pho here is also noteworthy. While I would have liked the broth to have been hotter, it was one of the cleanest, most unctuous beef broths that I've yet to encounter. They offer a variety of well-portioned bowls based on the different protein toppings, but the Pho Tai Nam which I ordered, which was topped with eye of round and navel, is a solid choice for most. They do, of course, have the Xe Lua, which includes six different cuts (brisket, navel, frank, tripe, tendon & eye of round) for those that are particularly adventurous. Top with bean sprouts, add in the requisite squeeze of lime and sriracha, and you have the perfect remedy for a chilly evening.While New Thanh Hoai certainly has its strengths, I can't say that it'll ever become part of my regular dining rotation simply because of how lackluster the overall environment and quality of service is.

I ordered takeout one afternoon - spring rolls and grilled porak over vermicelli. My go to is usually just spring rolls over vermicelli, or spring rolls and sauteed beef over vermicelli but I decided to veer a little off course this time. The grilled pork is really just thinly sliced pork chops and I'm not a fan of pork chops because they're usually dry. This was no different. But even so, it was still very flavorful. And even with takeout, the spring rolls were still crunchy.I didn't call ahead for my order and only waited 10 minutes, even though the place seemed pretty busy.

So I'm really thankful to have this ""New Thanh Hoai"" in the neighborhood, however the hell you pronounce it.A major turnoff for me was the fact that they are a bit on the filthy side. A janitor was mopping the floor right next to us, while we were eating. It was hard to ignore the smell of the harsh chemicals. Then the manager said something to him and he stopped mopping, leaving his gear out in the open for us to enjoy (see the pic which I posted).

100,lQBYM86zocS9P0zezWwL_w,Michael C.,3.0 star rating,I still miss the original Newark ave location quite a bit even now. For my last meal while living in JC decided to give this place another try and in the end I think 3 stars is pretty fair. I've been to their newer location at least half dozen of times now and in the end its mostly because of convenience of location that I keep going back. Definitely still one of the most authentic Vietnamese place in JC but you can certainly get much better Vietnamese food in the city. The services I always thought were really fast while they were at the old place and now depending on where you sit it can be very hard to get the waiter. One time I had to walk over to near the kitchen to finally get someone to get our order. Although this most recent time I was able to find someone relatively quickly as I was sitting at the bar. The place definitely was very crowded when I was here Friday night around 8pm and I have to give it to them for getting my food out pretty quickly despite being a packed restaurant.The spring roll I had I thought was bit light on the shrimp and heavy on the vermicelli noodles. But at least the rolls were packed. The beef curry stew was quite good actually flavorful although I thought some of the beef I had were bit hard and chewy. The bread was done pretty well I think they are fresh bread and goes with the broth perfectly. I would recommend it in addition to their pho line up for sure. In the end though I don't think I'll be missing this place too much perhaps just getting to be too busy and showy for me that I keep missing when it was just a hole in the wall that not everyone in the neighborhood knows about.

It's a rarity to even find a Vietnamese spot in NY/NJ that is actually Vietnamese and not Chinese or Korean run. So when you find a place that is nearby and can order in Vietnamese you latch on. It's alright here, food selection is well.. let's just say there would be a lot of complaining if I brought my parents here. But beggars can't really be choosers. They have a large pho selection, an assortment of com, bun and mi. There is a good selection of appetizers and banh mi, even a few other Chinese inspired dishes and family sized soups and stews. I've had their pho a few times, noodle to soup ratio is fine, but the soup is just a bit too salty for my liking and I always leave with a thirst stemming from their overdosing of MSG in their food. Their bo kho (beef stew) is served alongside a large loaf of french bread, the bread crisp bread dipped into the soup was good. But the soup itself was lacking some depth, to me, it tasted as if they tossed in an extra handful of star anise to cover up for their lack of flavor. Also, my dish was clearly made the night before and reheated, the meat was still semi warm when I bit into it. And they didn't even bother peeling the carrots before throwing them in the stew, I hope they at least rinsed them first.. Would love to comment on their desserts but each time I have ordered it, they have forgotten to bring it out (and still have charged me for it - don't worry I get it reversed). They have the infamous che ba mau, nhan nhuc and several flavors of bubble tea. Maybe one day when my patience isn't thin I will try again. Service here is questionable. There is really no organization or waiting area when you first enter the restaurant, the only direction you get is if you are picking up or if you are ordering to go they have a designated area for that. I kind of just hang out in the walkway until someone guides me to a table, sometimes it happens immediately and other times I find myself have awkward staring contests with their fish in the tanks at the entrance. Speaking of ordering to go, if you are eating in and want to order something to go, they DO NOT bring your food to your table for you once it is ready - rather you have to go pick it up in the designated to go area. Wish someone would have told us that, as the last time we ordered to go we sat there aimlessly until we were finally flag someone down and they informed us our food had been long ready - great, thanks. In terms of in restaurant service, well.. its always consistently meh. Sometimes the food comes out pretty quick and then other times they seem to be taking their sweet time the kitchen. Generally when we ask for our check we have to do it multiple times, the waiter somehow always seems to forget, we have found our waiters get distracted mid request, once one even went n took a small snack break.  At least the restaurant is easily accessible.

My biggest gripe is their service. It's brash, a little busy, and they're not super welcoming to questions. Granted, you are paying an average of $15/pp for a huge meal but I just wished they were a bit more pleasant. I'd be coming much more often and be more inclined to bring friends. A huge plus though, they have a parking lot next to the restaurant.",New Thanh Hoai,3.5 star rating,$$,"Vietnamese,, Seafood"

We also got the fried squid and that was also very tasty, with most of the flavor coming from the bed of lightly grilled veggies as the squid was just dipped in batter and fried with no additional seasoning.

Upon receiving it, the color and clarity of the broth was off - it should be dark brown and somewhat translucent. It was neither. And the lack of flavor - it was an assault on my tastebuds. And too much noodle to broth ratio.  Guys, even i can make a better bowl of pho.Now the avacado shake: the texture should be blended smooth. All i got was watery base and chunky avacado bits.

There is plenty of parking on the street and they have their own lot. I came when they n/first relocated and the restaurant felt fresh and lively...usually at dinner. There is a bar area that serves food on your right, and the left is the main dining room. Just had lunch with family here and they were accommodating for 14 guests. The menu has all the traditional vietnamese dishes you'd expect at this type of restaurant. This place also benefits from adding some ""off the menu"" items in high end seafood--lobsert, crabs, etc. My family always orders the bo luc lac (shaken beef). Its a nice dish that is seasoned well. Beef have nice thick chunks so its not overly cooked and chewy. I think their appetizer eggrolls are ""well known"" as everyone was ordering it, including my family. I had their bun thit nuong, shrimp sauteed in butter and pepper, and sauteed water spinach. All were good and i'd order them again. Prices are good considering the up and coming neighborhood. Perhaps $1-2 above down and dirty vietnamese spots. But free parking makes up the difference. I don't usually have dessert, but we had a long lunch so i tried the Rainbow dessert. (3 color bean dessert). It was overly sweet. I ate the filling and passed on the liquid part. I even diluted it with water and it was still too sweet. Misses include the bathroom entrance and bus'ing service. I don't expect asian restaurants to have amazing bathrooms, but this is a fairly new place. Yet, the bathroom, despite looking modern, was looking shabby. I guess no one wants to clean up the water so everything had a ""wet"" look/feel. It's ashame as the fixtures are decent quality. Also, the bathooms are near the prep, expedite, and kitchen area. Whoever designed this ""new space"" really dropped the ball on this. They could've made the entrance in the other room?

I agree that all the servers aren't going to give you top notch service, but the food came out hot and fast and they were all working together to help all the customers get their orders. As soon as an order would be delivered, another huge tray of pho would be brought out and carried to another, and that to me is pretty good service!",New Thanh Hoai,3.5 star rating,$$,"Vietnamese,, Seafood"

However, after my last experience, I can vehemently say that I am NEVER coming back. If I can give this restaurant 0 stars, I would.Service: The service has never been great here, but I always got my food so it didn't really bother me that I had to ask several times for water refills or for the check. However, when I came in today, they completely forgot about us and I was outraged about how they handled the situation. My boyfriend and I waited 40 minutes for our food while we watched everybody around us receive their orders. The waiters didn't even notice or just plain ignored the fact that we sat there with nothing. At first I thought it was because they were busy, but after waving down a waiter (with much difficulty since they don't seem to care) I realized they forgot about us. We were about to get up and leave, when finally our pho was brought to us 10 MINUTES AFTER I waved down the waiter. We were so upset that we had lost our appetites while everybody around us, who had arrived at the restaurant at the same time, were finishing up their meals. I then waved down another waiter, who I thought was one of the managers, and explained our situation and why we were upset. All he could offer me was a half-assed apology and a ""sometimes the kitchen skips orders"" bs. Not even an offer to foot the bill or an offer of a free item to quell our dissatisfaction. This was by far some of the worst service I have ever received at any restaurant.Food: Like I said, I have been going to this restaurant for years and I have always loved their pho. Today, my boyfriend and I ordered the summer rolls and 2 bowls of the #1 extra large pho. The summer rolls were good, but somehow some way the quality of their pho has deteriorated drastically. They used to have a very flavorful, brown translucent broth, but today the broth was just white and greasy and lacked all the flavor that used to be there. Not only that, when the bowls of pho came out, it was obvious that the content of my bowl was larger than the content of my boyfriend's bowl even though we ordered the same thing. So on top of the shitty service we received, they gave us two inconsistent, shitty bowls of pho.Maybe this restaurant should consider moving back to a smaller location like the one they had on Newark Ave long ago, because from my experience here, it seems like their waiters and kitchen can't handle the demand of a large restaurant. Plus their quality of food is so spectacularly mediocre now that I can't even justify anyone coming here to suffer through their crappy service for some Vietnamese food. Looks like I'm going to have to find another restaurant to satisfy my pho crave.",New Thanh Hoai,3.5 star rating,$$,"Vietnamese,, Seafood"

Ignore the cleaning stations around the restaurant with nasty bowls of half eaten food all around bused by the very people who serve you your food.  This isnt a 5 star dining experience here!Ask for the check early.  We have literally had to ask for the check at least 2x every time I've eaten here.  The servers all seem completely swamped and so you need to remind them of your presence.  Don't be shy!Despite all shortcomings - the food here is great and the prices are also great.  Love the parking lot.  A really good dining option in JC.",New Thanh Hoai,3.5 star rating,$$,"Vietnamese,, Seafood"

I almost fell out my chair. The vermicelli was priced normally though.Anyway onto food. I was surprised at how it looked. The beef honestly looked like a long mcrib. Weird bc it's usually cut into thin strips. Anyway the food tastes fine but since the beef was so thick the lemongrass flavor didn't permeate all of the way through.

203,Q8KEm9D4tb42o7MT00DSmA,Sara L.,2.0 star rating,"New Thanh Hoai is about having a quick, cheap Vietnamese meal, but in an unexpectedly nicer space than your typical no-frills restaurant. Initially, I was going to give this place 4 stars, but my latest visit made me think twice. The taste and quality of the food has changed entirely, and certainly not for the better. What I've experienced as of late is an evident change and decline in the quality of both the food and service. New Thanh Hoai is run by the same management that ran Nha Trang, which has now been closed for a number of months. For those who have frequented Nha Trang, you will know what I am talking about. This has only left the surrounding neighborhood with a minimal number of options, most of which are just mediocre or plain bad. Has management of New Thanh Hoai changed; I wouldn't be surprised if this were the case. Long gone are the glorious days of Nha Trang and the food that made it so good and popular. It's unfortunate because New Thanh Hoai has a much bigger, newer space than its former. A fancier appearance alone simply cannot save New Thanh though. I just want Nha Trang back.My first visit to New Thanh Hoai was perhaps a little over two months ago. The food nearly equated to the taste and quality of Nha Trang; inexpensive but while being very good, true, and authentic. I had the sauteed squid in spicy sauce along with some spring rolls. My partner had a bowl of beef noodle Pho soup. Everything was great, portion size wise, taste wise, etc. It was a visit that could have easily garnered 4 stars at the time. My latest visit, however, reflected an evident downturn. For dinner, my partner and I both ordered the beef noodle Pho, spring rolls, along with some grilled pork. What we received was a surprise. Their Pho was the second worst bowl of Pho I've had. The broth was very cloudy and completely bland. It didn't look all too appetizing either. I needed to saturate the soup with generous amounts of Sriracha and Hoisin sauce in order to give it flavor. The beef brisket was slightly overcooked. The mint leaves and lettuce with the spring rolls weren't very fresh. The pork was too salty and was sliced a bit too thin. While pricing has remained the same low prices (about $7.95 for a bowl of Pho), the portion sizes have considerably shrunk. Prepare for a much smaller bowl of Pho the next time you come here. On the other hand, the service has always seemed a bit inadequate, but I can't say I ever expected too much. All in all, terrible food and equally lackluster service.Quick, easy, affordable Vietnamese food can be found at New Thanh Hoai, but something vital has gone missing.

I can't remember which I've gotten but I'd venture to say it doesn't matter cause they're all good. When I'm feeling fat I also order the summer rolls which are so light and yummy. Way better than heavy, fried spring rolls. You must also try the soda lemonade! That's right...SODA LEMONADE! The new place they moved to is ginormous.

Spicy, crispy, huge portion of shrimpy delight. My friends had the Ga Xao Sa Ot (chicken with lemongrass, green pepper, onions with chili sauce) and the Rau Muong Xao Toi (sauteed water spinach with garlic sauce).  To be honest I think this is more of a seafood speciality place and the chicken was good, but paled compared to the shrimp dish. The water spinach was fresh and enjoyable. I would love to give them 4 stars if their service improves. When we walked in, we weren't sure who to approach for a table, as there was noone around designated to do so. So we just hung around observing the chaos. Finally we decided to approach one guy, who told us to wait for 10 minutes and then maybe he forgot about us...so after 10-15 minutes we caught hold of him again and he got us seated. He also took our order...and throughout the meal we were served by three different people.

This place is very close to the holland tunnel in jersey city.Ambience was nice - lots of tables in an open dining room as well as a separate area adjacent to the bar area and another room in the back. There is also seating upstairs but I don't think they were seating anyone there.We ordered spring rolls (standard, acceptable) and the garlic calamari (I asked our waiter what he would choose if given the choice between the garlic calimari vs lemongrass squid and he said quickly the fried one). The calamari was very fresh and tender. The sauce had a sweet vinegary flavor which I liked, but on the calamari itself I felt there could be slightly less breading. The kids had grilled lemongrass chicken over vermicelli (chicken was flavorful, tender). Hubs ordered the pork chop vermicelli which I thought was a bit on the thin side, a hair more than what I would call shaved?! I, being indecisive, decided to ask the waiter what his favorite rice dish was and he immediately (no hesitation whatsover!) Called out 2 menu numbers - the pork chop and the beef cubes.  Since hubs was getting pork chop verm already I opted for the beef cubes, which was something I had never ordered before. I was delighted with my choice; the beef was super tender and nicely flavored with onion and I think lettuce. As we were exiting the restroom I caught a glimpse of something yellow in the refrigerator at the waiter/waitress station. ..I prematurely got excited thinking it was some sort of mango pudding...but it turned out to be flan...which normally I would have been up for...but this night, for some reason, I was all about being adventurous and trying new stuff...so I tried the rainbow ice. If you haven't had this before I would say it's an acquired taste...a scoop of shaved ice with sweet beans, green jello (my least fave part), and tapioca, sitting in a pool of coconut milk. I ate it...but I'm not sure I would order again.All in all decent. ..but I think i still favor binh duong in bloomfield which is easier to get to.

It's no longer on the Jersey City Grove St/Newark Ave commercial corridor, but out near the Holland Tunnel entrance. It's an isolated location, but it has a large, paved, free parking lot so that is a plus for me! The new restaurant has a large bar set-off from the main dining room. The bar is open until 1AM. However, I'm never there that late. I usually come for lunch, and that means Pho! Their menu has been enlarged, but I still order the #2 Pho Dac Biet & Bo Vien which is the big combination bowl of beef eye of round, brisket, tendon, beef balls, tripe, rice noodles and other goodies. The Pho beef broth is pretty tasty. For a Vietnamese restaurant mainly catering to the Asian crowd, I am surprised at the skimpiness of the Pho toppings such as the Thai basil leaves, bean sprouts and especially the cilantro, or sometimes the complete lack of cilantro. Every time I go there I have to ask the waiter for ""extra"" cilantro. Most of the time they don't know what cilantro is, and I wish I knew what the Vietnamese word is for cilantro. Then it comes out in a tiny bowl, chopped to bits sometimes along with green onion mixed in. I just want big leafy cilantro that you can get in Chinatown or a Spanish supermarket for 50 cents a bunch. For an appetizer, their Cha Gio-Vietnamese spring rolls are delicious and accompanied with lettuce leaves. Some of the waiters are aloof and you really have to flag them down for water refills and even the bill. But the food still comes out quick. And it's tasty. And the Pho is under $8. And there's only one other Vietnamese restaurant in the area (with no parking), so when I have a Pho craving, this is it.",New Thanh Hoai,3.5 star rating,$$,"Vietnamese,, Seafood"

226,zt-E1rw2UyUx24OgjQ1QZA,Myron M.,4.0 star rating,"This place is a result of the move from what used to be Nhang Trang (on Newark Ave), or more popularly called Miss Saigon, to their new location. What you're going to miss from the old spot is the extremely speedy and accurate service from their previous waitstaff, and the old asian grandpa that ran the machine.With their new upgrade in location, you get: (1) a bigger parking lot, (2) bigger space, (3) a full bar (yes, alcoholic drinks!), (4) and some TVs! But you're not here to admire any of that mumbo jumbo. You're here to appreciate authentic Vietnamese food. And that's what this place does best. The #1 (extra big bowl) Pho is extremely solid and probably accounts for most of the 4 star rating. The broth is so good on its own, that I don't even bother putting in Sriracha or Hoisin sauce to mess with elegant yet bodied flavor. Other go to's are pork chop with fried rice, and Cha Gio (Vietnamese egg rolls). Everything is worth at least one taste.The other part of this 4 star rating is that most dishes are indeed under $10 and you get free HOT TEA. (PRO TIP) The service is real quick, on a NOT BUSY day -- like mid-afternoon weekdays, or 11:30am to 1PM on a weekend. If you go on a Friday/Saturday night, or Sunday after 1:30PM, expect to get caught in the lunch/dinner rush, and wait a couple of minutes to get seated because its your fault you went at PEAK hour. And if you do get seated during a busy day/night, just know you can't expect them to check up on you every 10 minutes asking how your meal was. You're in a different restaurant with a different culture. ***(PRO TIP) You will need to really flag down a waitstaff with direct look-and-nod, or actually tap them on the arm when they pass you by because -- and this is really big:(1) It's probably REAL busy/understaffed, and...(2) Most Asian (unamericanized) restaurants will leave you be in peace at your table and give YOU your space and PRIVACY to eat and enjoy time with your family or company. The only time they will serve you is when you need it upon request, like to request for the check.With all this in mind, this place, despite the move, still maintains the great and signature flavor that Miss Saigon had on Newark Ave. Truly a gem of Jersey City!",New Thanh Hoai,3.5 star rating,$$,"Vietnamese,, Seafood"

If you are sensitive to it or want to avoid it, make sure you order something made-to-order and tell the server. I learned this the hard way because I have MSG sensitivity - what's weird is that I haven't had an issue with this sensitivity in years, but the food at this restaurant DID set off my symptoms. get nervous when a restaurant doesn't have a menu online. I mean, what did people do before the Internet? How would you know whether or not you'd like the food if you couldn't see the menu first? So I called ahead to make sure this new Vietnamese restaurant, which occupies the space formerly taken by the Embankment, would have vegetarian items. The woman on the other end told me, ""Yes!"" So I was excited to meet my colleague for dinner. When I arrived, I was kind of mesmerized by the interior. The renovation was definitely ambitious; the ceilings are high and painted with a sky pattern, and the bar area has multicolored strobe lights (wtf...). The lights in the dining room area were turned way too brightly, almost like a cafeteria, and I guess that made sense with all the families with children eating there at 8 PM on a Monday night. The service here is really terrible. It took forever to get a waiter to take our order, and none of the waitstaff seems to speak English very well. In my day-to-day, I'm not bothered too much by language barriers, but when I'm at a restaurant and the waiter can't answer my question because he doesn't understand it? This really bothers me, especially when the menu has like 100 items on it. How is the diner supposed to know anything without asking? I'm glad I asked about the OYSTER sauce in every dish except one on the vegetarian menu because it's not vegetarian. Does that make any sense?Luckily, I was able to order a custom dish that consisted of spinach in garlic sauce and topped with soybean cake. I'm not even sure what my dining companion ordered (and I don't think she knows either) because she just pointed to a photo on the menu and asked for it. The original item she wanted wasn't available because the kitchen had run out of pork. Finally my family-style plate of spinach dotted with little soybean cakes (basically tofu) arrived. Thank goodness for the peanut sauce leftover from my friend's shrimp roll appetizer because I needed some flavor besides garlic. I have enough spinach to last me at least two more meals. My friend didn't really enjoy her food.By the time we finished, I think it took a half hour for anyone to come over and check on us. We were getting antsy to leave, and I wanted to get my spinach farm wrapped. My friend couldn't figure out if we had to wait for the waiter to bring out check or if we had to pay up front. When she went to the front to ask, they looked at her as if she was being rude. When we got our bill, the ticket only had our total, no breakdown of prices. Because I basically ordered something off the menu, I had no idea how much my meal cost. I would not come back here.

Canadian (Dunguness) Crab - at $11.95 great deal.   Lighter coated in seasoned cornstarch and wok fried with ginger and scallion.   Best part is in the creamy roe glued inside the body cavity.   You have to work a little to eat it but worth the effort to get to sweet morsels of ocean meat.Service is very friendly and prices very reasonable.   Overall welcome addition to the neighborhood.",New Thanh Hoai,3.5 star rating,$$,"Vietnamese,, Seafood"

It is quickly paced, food ready, no frills.  Can there be a restaurant that tows both lines?  Depends on your standards.  For me, the pho and noodles carry worthy recognition without the need of fluff. I'm sorry,  for the prices you are paying we are not going get Michelin star rated hosting. Eat your spring rolls, they taste great.  Come correct.  If you wanted frou frou bourgie sub-par Asian fusion,  trounce your way up to Hoboken for overpriced noodles doused with soysauce albeit with very pretty plating and illustrious garnish. I am a simple man.  Take me to Argyle in Chicago or any pho joint with a rich broth, you've got one satisfied guy. The food is plentiful,  the seating is available, the flavors are solid,  no one customer is a superhuman diety. Each time I come here, whether on a Wednesday or a Sunday, the place is packed.  I don't see the myriad of Vietnamese and Pilipino families throwing shade. Hmmmmmm... is that a coincidence?

I've been here a couple times already not including their old location that used to be on Newark Ave. Anyway I've had both good and bad experiences but it's mostly with the customer service. Once you order the food comes super quick but then sometimes they take forever to get the check. My personal favorites are any of the Pho items extra large bowl full of all the gelatinous fat and trite pieces. Even though I don't eat those its good to know they don't waste animal pieces. The broth is just amazing especially if you add a hint of Sriracha and Hoisin sauce. I also like to put a splash of lime and all the bean sprouts they give as extra delicious flavor. My second favorite is the Bo Luc Luc which is diced beef cubes on top of salad and slice tomatoes. It's so good especially with egg on top and eat it with the side of white rice they give you it's just magic. What I try to do to not be as fat is to just eat the Bo Luc Luc with out the rice and egg and its just as good. the beef is so tender and good source of protein. The last thing I usually like getting is the Spring rolls which comes with delicious peanut sauce.

289,SIJtnk-PzoHExhCzNjnqGQ,Elle P.,4.0 star rating,"3.5 stars is just about right, but I'm rounding it up to 4*s because of the dearth of good places to eat around Hoboken. We quickly made New Thanh Hoai a part of our rotation of places where we regularly eat.The pho and bun are quite good. The rice noodles are nicely cooked. For the pho, the broth has a good savory flavor, but sometimes I find the broth a tad too salty. They give a decent size serving of bean sprouts and mint leaves with the pho. When we order bun, we either get the grilled beef or grilled beef and spring rolls. The grilled beef is really delicious and beautifully seasoned. I love the grilled beef. I also love the spring rolls. Very crispy, not oily at all, and absolutely irresistibly delicious. If you love spring rolls, you should definitely order them here. Several Yelpers complain about the service at New Thanh Hoai. I should clarify something about the service here. New Thanh Hoai does not have terrible service. It does have the indifferent type of service you should expect to get from an Asian restaurant. It's nothing personal. They're not being rude. It's a cultural thing. If you're expecting American-style service of the servers constantly coming over to check on you, smile, and anticipating your needs, then you're out of luck. You won't get it. Instead, they'll be a little slow to get your order, but your food will arrive quickly. They'll efficiently put your food down and leave you alone. If you need something including the check, flag someone down and you'll quickly get it. But don't expect them to anticipate you wanting your check. If you want to hang out there all day, they'll let you. They won't try to hurry you out like American restaurants.

No type of care for the customer, customer service, business credibility, anything, not even a ""Don't worry about the bill"" - to this individual all he cared about was just sending me the $34.00 bill for a fish that was not a Red Snapper and for me to leave. My problem was that I said I would pay for the meal - I find it embarrassing to not pay for a meal. Once the Bald Man knew he was guaranteed payment for this disgusting meal he could care less about rectifying the situation.

Cant really blame them on that since they dont have the turn over numbers like other vietnamese restaurants in chinatown. HOWEVER, there were some small spots of DIRT on the lettuce leaves... Employees should REALLY wash them carefully before serving. Did not complain because I was in a rush to eat.Also ordered the bun bo hue...hmmm major disappointment. First of all, the broth was a bit too sweet for my taste. Thats the first thing you really taste, the sweetness and then nothing much until the end where the spiciness kicks in. So here is the real problem with their broth. EXTREMELY UPSET ABOUT THE SOUP I don't believe they put in vietnamese shrimp paste, no pan frying of the shallets, garlic, and lemon grass with chili powder, SO ALL THEY REALLY DID WAS just put in the pho soup and add a spoonful of chili sauce.

Walk in you are greeted with large glass live seafood tanks and an open concept, high ceiling dining area surrounded by Asian artwork. Overall a clean and ambient Asian themed restaurant. What a cool thing to share when you were greeted by a waiter who spoke 4 different languages (English , Vietnamese, Cantonese, Mandarin )? Could hardly go bad with versatility plus friendly and quick food service (main entrees delivered in ~10 min) .For appetizers, four of us ordered Fried crispy Vietnamese Roll and hollow choy served with garlic (vegetable dish) , with one bowl of complimentary white rice hmmm. For main entrees ($9 - $12 ea.), I ordered #1 beef special pho soup noodle bowl (this signature dish common in Vietnamese Restaurant) that was delicious and sufficient. Others had pho or rice dish that looked and tasted just as pleasing. With so many other dishes on menu, New Thanh Hoai would be worthy a second visit. Only other beefs I had (haha get it?) with this place was ~10 min long wait time for bill preparation (someone else received their check well before we did, despite our checks were requested before theirs), relatively small quantity (w/o appetizers, main entrees alone fulfilling my stomach is questionable), and charging for additional bowls of rice ($1 extra!).P.S.

I'm a little sad that they moved a little further away from me but it's only a short drive down Erie Street and if the weather is nice, then it's a decent walk. I almost always get the pho for it's medicinal purposes from when I'm sick (this is not a joke). I'm pretty sure they're putting something in the pho to make you sweat out the illness and help you feel better.I also get the spring rolls and I slice them up to put in my pho lol. It tastes excellent in case you guys were wondering. The Bo Luc Lac is lip smacking good (ask for a fried egg with it, you won't regret it). Although I've never gotten the point of putting piping hot beef on top of lettuce which wilts almost instantly. I guess it's only for decorative purposes.The decor is somewhat weird but I'm not coming here for the decor.

PHO: 2.5-3 stars. I never get it hot and the broth is still a little watered down for me. DISHES: solid 4. Whenever I come here, I only get their entrees now. Their sauteed water spinach is delicious. The soups, noodles, rices... all very delicious. I don't know... some of their food pushes toward Chinese for me. I think they have some dishes that overlap. Overall though, pretty good Vietnamese for the area. Their happy hour deals are good - beer is pretty cheap. The services isn't the best. But I'm glad they moved to this area. Hamilton Park is a lot nicer, they still have good parking lot, and the venue is much bigger. Their portions are big and it's a good large party location. But... their PHO.sigh...

Apparently you were supposed to know to order your own veggie dishes, but I didn't know this and they staff members were hard to communicate with. The summer roll was refreshing but overstuffed with rice. The veggie soup was oily and the veggies were very big and hard to eat. It was hard to confirm certain dishes didn't have meat in them. There wasn't any flavor - I had to add a lot of chili sauce but it didn't help and the sticky rice was on the side. It also took 15 min and 4 people to get the check.

What kind of restaurant doesn't ask you for drinks or give you water unless you flag them down for it? I don't know if this is the norm in Vietnam but we are in America. You cannot expect your patrons to just drink your complementary hot tea the whole time. Now in fairness to them.. the food is great. The new location is much nicer and bigger than the old one. They also have a bigger and better parking lot this time. Unfortunately, the service remains awful.

My water never came as I chocked on a piece of spice, he literally THREW my plate in front of me which made a very loud ""clank"" sound on the glass. When my noodle dish came, it was the wrong one so I waited while others ate and I just stared at the emptiness in front of me. Then another waiter came and started piling food on our table which didn't belong to us.. SERIOUSLY PEOPLE?!  - understood that this place just opened, but this type of service is completely unacceptable. The spring roll's rice paper is very thick, not appetizing at all.

The two stars I'm giving for this review are basically for the pho alone, because everything else about this experience was so bad.My main complaint is about the service. I realize that the service here is not typical (I had been to the old location before, which was more like a cafeteria style where you had to flag people down to get anything). I was prepared for that, but this experience was really bad. One waitress took our order, and then was basically never seen again. We were a group of 4, and quickly the spring rolls and 2 people's entrees showed up. But the other 2 dishes just didn't come... We waited for a bit, then waited some more, trying to catch someone to ask, but it seemed like all the servers had pretty much checked out. Most of them just hung out in the far corner of the dining room, eating their own food or rolling the silverware, making it hard to find someone to flag down.When we did finally manage to ask someone, he said he'd check on our food. 10 minutes later and we were still waiting. When the same guy came back around to bus a nearby table, he seemed surprised that it still hadn't come, and went back to the kitchen. By this point, my 2 friends who had gotten their food had basically finished eating. I'm really not joking when I say there was a 20-30 minute gap between when half of our group got their food and when the other half got theirs. Pretty ridiculous.To sum up, the food is good.

What seemed like an argument amongst staff and management out in the open was appalling; no warm greetings or apologies after waiting quite a while was unbelievable (I even tried to be understanding because the place was busy but I was quite irritated after a while); busboys taking on all the hard work while the wait staff were looking around and waiting for me to call on them by raising my hand to simply order was absurd. I will most likely simply stick to delivery and not waste my usual 20% tips dining-in.

Tables always reek and have film of old dish rag/fish sauce smell - Old spot always sprayed down and cleaned up tables immediately. The stench is what usually gets me at first then ask I to move to new table and end up in back area - could be where the attitude comes from.  Seriously, clean up the tables better.As for the food, it's on par with old Nha Trang Place.  The Pho is my go to order but seems to be hit or miss lately - cold sticky blob of noodles that seem to be have been on shelf for a while, less than generous portions of meat.Like the new space but am missing the told staff - bring them back.",New Thanh Hoai,3.5 star rating,$$,"Vietnamese,, Seafood"

When you walk in they rush you to a seat even if it is still being cleaned. Then you are seated with the chemical aroma of the cleaning fluids around you.  Tea was served in good time but after they take your order and serve you, don't expect any service. No one checks to see if your food is ok or if you need anything else. If you didn't ask for water while you were ordering you're out of luck and have to flag someone down for it. I watched a server seat a customer who dropped the menu on the table and walk away while the customer was trying to order. When it came time to ask for the bill, I had to ask twice to get the bill and waited too long and missed any opportunity for servers ignoring me while they went to other tables.

The food didn't take long to arrive, and the chopsticks, spoons, sauces (Sriracha, Hoisin, chili, & soy), and napkins are all stacked on the side of your table set up, which is convenient.

406,qpTESNlZHhjRL3ki6aX-IQ,Pinkiblu L.,2.0 star rating,"I have gone to this place twice just to reassure my experience there and I did made comparison to other Vietnamese restaurants in JC.First time - 3 stars.  I've been a fan of the Embankment so I know how the interior is and I have always liked it.  The place was pretty empty during dinner time, assuming because it is still new.  So there where three other tables aside from us.  The staff greeted us a lot and we have our pick of table. We've ordered the pork chop over broken rice, pho soup, rice crepe appetizer and a green pepper squid over rice.  FOOD:  I've never had the rice crepe appetizer so there's nothing for me to compare it to.  I was thrilled to be able to order it when other restaurants have removed it from their menu.  The pepper squid was not bad, it was flavorful.  The pork chop was pretty moist and the crab patty was not bad so not much complaint there.  The rice for both plates was cold and we assumed it was because it's late in the evening, which should not be an excuse.  You cannot feed an Asian with bad rice!   As for the pho, we all know that the stock soup is suppose to be cooking the whole day to get the flavoring out.  We also know that it should not take 30 mins just to get a pho out. The soup flavoring was a bit bland comparatively to Miss Saigon.  Pho being the base of Vietnamese food (at least to all I have been too), it's already a no for returning.  The pho soup came out 30 mins AFTER the rest of our food came out.  I don't know if they said there's MSG or not but I'm pretty sure it is there because we all got really thirsty shortly after eating there.If it was not for the staff it would be a 2 instead of a 3 for my first visit.  Aside from forgetting my order they were really nice people.Second visit - 1 star (0 stars if I can):  I saw the Crab and Shrimp vermicelli sign after the first time so I came back during lunch to try that.  This time I took my mom to give this place a try.  My mom have always been a fan of the combo and since last time the pork chop was okay we ordered that, the special and the curry chicken appetizer.Curry chicken.  The curry was really watery and it sat more on sweet then spicy. It is probably with a coconut milk base but to not get a slight kick with it is sort of disappointing and the bread was not toasted or even sliced or were we given anything to cut with.  Combo rice.  Rice was cold again but this time the pork chop was dry and a significant drop of yumminess from the first time.  Knowing well enough we have ordered pork chop the staff forgot to give us the utensils to help cut it. (They were A LOT more attentive the first time)Special:  Oh how I need to filter my complaints about this dish!  I highly believe it was wrongly advertised.  It is called a ""Crab & Shrimp Vermicelli Soup""..let's all think how we will first interpret it in our own way.  I can assure that no one will have envisioned what I received.  The soup was a clear stock and what I think is a lot of the fish sauce mixed in  with tomato slices.  I found 3 pieces of pigs blood pudding, a few slices of fried tofu, meatball that tasted like pork and something I thought was just fish ball.  First off, I was not told there would be pork blood pudding and meatballs. what if I'm a Pescetarian or I cannot eat pork due to religious reasons?!  I'm neither but they should be more aware of the diversity of Jersey City crowds.  The whole time I cannot find the crab meat or the shrimp, I actually called over a staffer to ask just to make sure that I've received the correct order.  Only to find out, that 2 pieces of what I thought was fried fish slices were in fact the crab and shrimp IN PATTY FORM! I would've expected crab patty, heck even the imitation crab meat but not a crab/shrimp combo patty. To be fair, they did use real shrimp, I found a leg within the patty.  Is it worth the money I paid for? NO...do I feel cheated? YES.For a lunch crowd it was sad to say that there were only another table with us at the time yet we cannot see a staffer to get utensils or our check!CONCLUSION:  With a 3 and 1 stars, it averaged out to the 2 stars given and I will NEVER return to that place or give it as a recommendation based on the two times I've been there.",New Thanh Hoai,3.5 star rating,$$,"Vietnamese,, Seafood"

I recently attended a family dinner of about 65 people on a Thursday evening at New Thanh Hoia. We had originally called weeks ahead and inquired about menu options. Upon arrival we were given the family style option which was not what we had previously discussed. We still chose to do the new family style option that they had displayed. Appetizers came out within 20 minutes or so, 2 per table (we had 8 tables of 8-10 people) but orders were confused. We tried to sort it out with the servers but it seemed something got lost in translation so we ourselves handled the mixed appetizers. Drink orders were done after the apps came out despite us asking. When the entrees came out it just was not enough food so we had to order more. We still enjoyed our dinner. The food is always tasty but the family style option didn't quite work for us. Also, the workers were understandably frustrated with us but one waiter in particular kept mumbling under his breath.

I don't live in apartment 109, they just wrote the apartment number down incorrectly.(Now, they did try calling us...but the phone was in the other room. Didn't think it was necessary to have it next to me after repeating the address twice. So let's say it's half their fault, half mine)OK fine...we ask them to redeliver the food.  Another hour goes by...no food. We call them back and are told that the delivery guy left and FORGOT to take the order!! Who does that? No apology, no we'll get it to you in 5 minutes. Order = canceled It's too bad, for years I waited for a delivery vietnamese restaurant in the area. I would have ordered from them every other week. Oh well, they will never receive an order from me again.If you want to order dinner at 6:45, and still be hungry at 8:55 because your food never shows up, by all means order from here.",New Thanh Hoai,3.5 star rating,$$,"Vietnamese,, Seafood"

424,k2RaKsbZ6ZR0LsXStOxlnA,Alyssa W.,4.0 star rating,This was my first experience with Vietnamese food and it won't be my last. You can start smelling the kitchen a block away. We were seated quickly and hot tea was already on the table. The server was quick but not pushy. He allowed us to take our time with ordering since we were new to the menu. When the good came it was fresh and delicious. Their homemade hot sauce that is on the table is out of this world. I like hot sauce and this was amazing. Definitely will be back again soon.,New Thanh Hoai,3.5 star rating,$$,"Vietnamese,, Seafood"
425,KL0nSzYwOBTxGD6m9rlmLA,Rich W.,4.0 star rating,"I stumbled upon the original Thanh Hoai about 6 years ago when I was attempting to find something decent for lunch in the area and I've been going here since. Although I have since been relocated to Midtown for work, I still frequent this place when visiting the in-laws. Their new location is actually a lot more spacious with outdoor seating and a bar section. Located on the corner of the block, the ambundance of windows offers a brighter atmosphere when compared to their original location. The food is consistent as expected, their Pho isn't the best but enough to hold you down when you have that urge for some Pho goodness and let's get serious where else can you get Pho that's comparable out in Jersey City (sorry I'm not a local)!? Just because there isn't any other establishment that can offer you this out in Jersey City, this place deserves 4 stars!",New Thanh Hoai,3.5 star rating,$$,"Vietnamese,, Seafood"
426,nYcJK6bMm1oAN-JUQUWdOA,Cristina B.,1.0 star rating,"I had been craving good, local, Vietnamese food, since my Vietnam trip last year. After driving by this restaurant a couple times, I finally stopped in to give it a try. Started with the vegetable spring rolls with peanut sauce.  The rolls were huge and the wraps were thick, gummy and sticky.  I couldn't finish them, I was totally turned off.  I was expecting them to be light and crunchy.  Very disappointed.  As an entree, ordered the Chicken Curry, like in Vietnam, the chicken was served skin on and bone in (which I like). Chicken lacked flavor and the portions were really small, loads of sauce and potatoes, barely any chicken. Overall, the location is big and spacious, service was slow and the food was lacking in taste and presentation.  I will not be returning and  will continue my search for great Vietnamese in the area.",New Thanh Hoai,3.5 star rating,$$,"Vietnamese,, Seafood"
427,jCY4Fa2-L4eWkNKfQb4QaQ,Colin P.,2.0 star rating,Wow.  The inside of the new location is nice but the quality of the food and service is horrible compared to the old location.   The pho is ok.  The rice platters are decent.  The fried fish is horrible!   The service is very slow.   I miss the old location.,New Thanh Hoai,3.5 star rating,$$,"Vietnamese,, Seafood"
428,MNkbAnFpHX4gqgluZMKraw,Derek C.,3.0 star rating,"Been visiting this place for years since their old location. The food is consistently good no question about that. The prices are unbeatable. The portions are heavy and I always leave full. Service is crap. Staff is not very friendly never was, new location we hoped the service would be better. Why does the service suck? They always bring my meal with our appetiZers so we no longer order apps. Once the food is out they never check on you to see if you need more drinks so you spend your dinner trying to wave someone down. You can wait up to an hour after your meal waiting for the check even if you request it. This restaurant can easily earn 5 stars if the staff learned some customer service. But again food was always good and cooked well flavorful and can't beat the price we eat here at least twice a month and will continue to do so. Tips will reflect the service as always but they don't seem to care.",New Thanh Hoai,3.5 star rating,$$,"Vietnamese,, Seafood"

C.,4.0 star rating,"Being from California, where a good pho place is always a stone's throw away, none of the pho places in the City did it for me.  I was so happy to have found this place, originally on Newark Ave and now here.  Granted, while the broth could be a bit more intense and the noodles chewier, it's certainly good enough to satisfy my pho cravings.",New Thanh Hoai,3.5 star rating,$$,"Vietnamese,, Seafood"
430,oCx0NapiAkF_xlzupl_YGA,Veronica C.,5.0 star rating,"Ok, this is your typical style Vietnamese restaurant. I would say it is the best in the NYC metro area if Bunker Vietnamese didn't exist. However, this spot is king of the pho! The broth is simply incredible.

431,Asezc9LWoO7IfZ0AO-w8dw,Vito S.,3.0 star rating,"Very solid Pho food. I haven't tried any previously in Jersey city and compared to what I've had in Brooklyn I would definitely eat here again. Also a pretty nice restaurant for a pho place, but then again it's in a nice area as well. The only reason they don't get 4 stars is the service is awful, and that's due to not enough staff working because everyone there is very obviously working hard. Also the 3 alcoholic drinks were all pretty mediocre. I'm guessing this is again attributed to lack of staff and rushing to make the drinks. The food itself is above average and prices as with all Pho very reasonable.",New Thanh Hoai,3.5 star rating,$$,"Vietnamese,, Seafood"

433,ebcjwbP0Yhlui-hJ7ptYPQ,King C.,5.0 star rating,This is the first time I've gone to the restaurant after they relocated. I used to go to the old location on Newark twice a month since it was closer to my apt. I have to say this new location looks nicer and the menu prices match it too. Though it is still cheaper than other Vietnamese restaurants in the area. The pho and summer rolls are amazing as always. Will be coming back.,New Thanh Hoai,3.5 star rating,$$,"Vietnamese,, Seafood"

The server never like to repeat after taking order and don't even expect any customer service to make sure everything right ......",New Thanh Hoai,3.5 star rating,$$,"Vietnamese,, Seafood"

This is the place you want to go to for Pho. It's good quality at the price you expect. I wish they didn't move from the Newark Ave location because it was much closer to me then.
