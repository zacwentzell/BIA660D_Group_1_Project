( about 1/4 mile from the exit of the holland tunnel heading towards 78 and the turnpike )  Always meticulously clean and food is really really good on the cheap",El Cabañal,4.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Diners"
1,PteWTzAb4Q_7mw_yrKhD4Q,Michael C.,4.0 star rating,Great little place offering traditional diner food with a Latin flare. The Cabañal breakfast burrito and stuffed French toast are staples. The Ecuadorian Ruben is a permanent lunch special.,El Cabañal,4.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Diners"
2,_lPE6k5G9hsN7SgwNSc3VA,Chris L.,3.0 star rating,"Eggs, home fries, toast, juice and coffee con leche on platter #1 for just $6, a great price right by the Holland tunnel but fuggedabout parking. Love that the coffee already has my favorite steamed milk, and free refills too.Classic diner design with counter and tables, rehabbed and looking new, lavender pink seats lol, unfortunately the TVs were painfully loud. Friendly but surprisingly slow service on a quiet Saturday morning. Home fries were not deep fried, kudos. My Spanish omelette was stuffed with onion and tomato, solid. But no jam for the toast??",El Cabañal,4.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Diners"
3,VvjvDenuLLtvzxWeAZVMBg,Chris F.,4.0 star rating,"Every time I've eaten here it was a great meal and more than enough. I ordered the pernil and barely put a dent in it. This place is small and unassuming, and if you've take the holland tunnel back to NJ, you've probably unknowingly passed it. They're open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner  so any time is great to stop by.",El Cabañal,4.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Diners"
4,Y96jOicc2aO45h0oiPwTaw,Gary M.,5.0 star rating,"Let me start by saying that I have a soft spot for diners, and thus am predisposed to enjoy El Cabañal. That said even if you're not a Diner junkie you're going to have a great meal here. This place is everything that made Diners great back in the day. For starters they make real food. They don't just thaw and fry like a lot places do these days. The food is real and home cooked. Next, it's a family run joint. How can you go wrong with that? Owner/Operators care real hard about their businesses and customers. And finally, they've got diner favorites (all day breakfast!) with a South American flair. All of these things combine to make for the best breakfast burrito on the planet, for example. I really can't see a way that you're not going to enjoy yourself here.",El Cabañal,4.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Diners"
5,mSGnaFPuPl4esC03-CX_Og,Connie L.,5.0 star rating,"I come here for lunch almost every week and love the food and the price.  I always order one of the lunch specials that come with a salad, two sides (beans, plaintains, French fries), rice and a drink. Must try!",El Cabañal,4.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Diners"

I'll definitely come back for an authentic Colombian meal,El Cabañal,4.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Diners"
7,bp-vDOIQ47WDyxA-oqYSjg,Jim H.,5.0 star rating,"I've been driving by a few times a week and thought ""how are they doing with this location and limited parking?"" Today I finally went in with my son and his friend. We had wonderful authentic Ecuadorian flavored meals. Truly unique and tasty. I'll be coming by again and again. I highly recommend giving this cool little diner a try. Also try the Greenish/yellow sauce. Omg! Wonderful!",El Cabañal,4.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Diners"

9,bpFrCAYe4jYlVGPtsNEclQ,Jyoti K.,5.0 star rating,"Unlike most diners, this place is clean and doesn't leave you with that 'sticky' feeling other diners have. It's modern on the inside, so don't be fooled by the outer appearance.  The service is great with friendly staff.  The food is Ecuadorian with an American twist and tasty. I'm glad we stopped by to check it out, as this was a pleasant surprise!",El Cabañal,4.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Diners"
10,s0PejB8Y9k217Wi99wkfZQ,Charmaine B.,1.0 star rating,"So I've had my third visit here and I will not returning. There was a wrong pricing on the menu and the ""owner"" was very rude about it. I am concerned about the hair that was in my food. There was mice all around the area. Just be careful this place needs to be inspected.",El Cabañal,4.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Diners"
11,XT54wREgr6rFDjNLllleAA,Barrett W.,5.0 star rating,"This place is fresh and delicious!  We tried so many different things - loved the ceviche, pork, and steak, but the fish soup was INSANELY good and HUGE!  It is family run - you definitely feel the warmth and hospitality.  I could tell that this food is made with love.  Highly recommended!",El Cabañal,4.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Diners"
12,tBWjSjCkHdZntfqlSNC9Rw,Jared V.,5.0 star rating,"I've came here twice for lunch with coworkers. Even after my second time here it's still not better than any Caridad restaurant in NYC.  Great lunch deal though: an entree with yellow or white rice with 2 extra sides and a drink for $7.50. First time I had the rotisserie chicken, second time the baked chicken. Could have done the baked chicken better, too dry. The yellow rice seem pale. But overall, can't go wrong with a go to lunch spot right around the corner from work.",El Cabañal,4.5 star rating,$$,"Latin, American,, Diners"
