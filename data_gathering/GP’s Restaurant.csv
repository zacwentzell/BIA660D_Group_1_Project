As soon as we sat down we were greeted with a small salad. Best touch of the night in my opinion. I LOVE having a salad with my pasta but never am interested in paying $10 for an appetizer salad bc it's always too big and too much food. Loved that touch! Bread was also great!Ordered a bottle of the Montipulciano, our fav! Wine was very nicely priced. We started with the meatball app. The meatballs were really big and the sauce was amazing. However, they looked pretty pink on the inside. We werent sure if it was the sauce that made them appear pink but we risked it and devoured them anyways. Needless to say, we spent the night sick when we got home. I don't want to blame the delicious meatballs, but it was the only thing we both ate so sadly I think they were the culprit. :(. This is the ONLY reason I gave this place four stars instead of five. For entrees I got the orecchiette and he got a steak. Again, both awesome! Prices are right, portions are right, and the service was impeccable. That being said, we will definitely return to give it another chance. Just may skip the meatballs this time!",GP’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Wine, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
1,g5o0ixP6avZ8fyjw9R5nbQ,Danesh J.,2.0 star rating,"Cliff notes: Not so good. Long wait for nothing stellar. Came here for lunch during the week. We we're six people, the place was empty, but didn't get served food for about 60 minutes. The server was nice but didn't once acknowledge how long it was taking, rarely came over to fill up drinks, and acted as if the long wait was normal, which was odd. When we asked how much longer it would be they stated ambiguously ""they're working on it"". Mind you this was about 30 minutes into it. We ordered fries to start and that didn't come out until after our food came. Since we did order two baked salmons, I could understand if that took time, but the other items (all pasta related) should have been pretty quick. It really reminded me of a restaurant out of Kitchen Nightmares. Foodwise, it was okay but probably because we  were starving by the end of it. Oddly enough some of the fries were still frozen. Even after the wait, nothing was comped or even acknowledged, which really was a put off. So obviously if you're looking for Italian during the day for a work related team lunch, seek it elsewhere. Maybe they're better at timing at night, but after this experience I wouldn't chance it.",GP’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Wine, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I got passed that, maybe he felt lazy for that second, so whatever. We got the garlic bread with cheese ($7) for something I could make at home in 5 minutes.

The rhubarb margarita was incredible, a refreshing blend of tart, sweet, and tequila. Greek salad wasn't anything special but it got my veggies in for the day and was fresh. My meatball...that was something special. Tender and moist on the inside but with a good crust on the outside that kept it from falling apart into a mush of ground meat. The blend of pork, beef, and veal was just right and the tomato sauce was as good as your nonna's. Honorable mention to the spaghetti - cooked just right. Firm but not hard and finished in the sauce so it ""stuck"" with the noodles. Sea bass main course was excellently prepared. Imagine a lighter version of flounder francese with better tasting fish. I am not a huge fish lover but I could have eaten 2 or 3 servings of this one. Cannoli for dessert was nothing to write home about, but everyone really has their own preferred style of filling; this one wasn't for me.

The marsala sauce was the perfect amount of sweet mixed with the salty prosciutto. It also came with linguine and marinara sauce, so the portions were huge. I didn't even touch the pasta.

The marsala sauce was the perfect amount of sweet mixed with the salty prosciutto. It also came with linguine and marinara sauce, so the portions were huge. I didn't even touch the pasta.

The eggs were overlooked, soggy, and lacked any flavor except for the fishyness of what looked like Walmart packaged salmon that was haphazardly placed next to it. The mushrooms also tasted like they came out of a can. The whole thing came out cold so I don't doubt that it did actually come out of a can. Honestly, I never bother to review restaurants but I had to warn people about this place because I do not understand the 4 star rating. The pricing of this place is not warranted at all.

46,iN-KXz-iZ3AkdVav3Zo2PQ,Michael P.,1.0 star rating,"Okay so let me start by saying this place used to be one of my favorite places to come with a group of couples. My wife loves the food here and with good reason. What they do they do incredible well. Where they fail is having that, we know are food is good so you have to deal with our horrible customer service attitude that happens to great small trendy places too often in the area. Let's take it from the beginning. It's a Friday night I call for reservations around 7:30, party of 4, no problem. We arrive on time and due to the unusually warm weather for this time of year there a good amount of tables seated outside. We tell the hostess our name and time of reservations only to be greeted with ""I don't know if we have anymore room outside"". Now first off we didn't even want to sit outside second when you took my reservation you should have asked then if we wanted to sit outside or not, third if we wanted a table outside it's your job to politely explain that there is going to be a wait for an outside table and give us the option of waiting or sitting inside. Rudeness from the start of the night should have been a sign that this wasn't going to end well. We are seated inside and we are approached by our server, he makes a remark about it being so busy. YEAH BUDDY ITS A FRIDAY NIGHT!!! Are you complaining about making money ? We order a bottle of wine, a beer and my wife who is pregnant just asks for water to which the waiter replies ""are you just lame ?"" Then my wife sits back and shows her 5 month belly bump, he laughed it off and didn't even give a sincere apology. Ok I'm not a snotty diner by any means, I can crack a joke and take one for that matter with the best of them but to make a remark like that so early into the dinning experience is just unprofessional. I chalk it up to poor judgment because like I said we have been here plenty of times before and never really had any issue. So I, for now, give him the benefit of the doubt. When he comes back with our drinks he asks if they (the other couple we are with) want to taste the wine which my male friend declines and again this server puts his foot in his moth by mentioning that they selected a twist off cap so there really wouldn't be a reason to taste the first pour. I don't even know what he meant buy that remark so I let that slide too. The next time he approaches our table is to drop off bread, while he is holding a plate of food for a different table in his other hand. The dish he was holding looked amazing. Now we are ready to order by the time he comes back and we ask what he was holding in his hand, the waiter told us that what he had in his hand was a one of a kind specialty combination of two of the specials that night. It was basically the chicken special paired with the risotto from the salmon special WOW that sounds super difficult to recreate( sarcasm) He then went on to explain that the only reason the chef did that for this particular guest is because she has been coming to the restaurant since it was open and that we haven't reached her status yet so we couldn't request the same dish as our entree. Well this was the final straw for me. At this point I asked if the patron who is was referring to tips well because after his continuous arrogant comments he shouldn't expect a good tip for us. My wife was mortified because I can be very unruly when I want to and this server is lucky that this time my wife was pregnant and she begged me not to cause a scene. Anyway the rest of the night played out as expected and we left a average tip against my will but I will not be going back to this place despite the delicious food. Sometimes restaurants get comfortable and the service is the first sign that the ship isn't being run as tightly as it could be. There are enough good places in the area that patrons simply won't put up with poor service and this place is the newest casualty to the trend.",GP’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Wine, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

The restaurant sits across from Hamilton Park and offers outdoor seating with approximately 6-8 tables w/ umbrellas.Patrons can see a 20 foot bar upon walking through the door of the restaurant. This day the entire staff was very attentive and accommodating. Brunch consisted of one choice from each of two courses: 1) Arugula Salad or Crab Cake, 2) Rigatoni Bolognese or Crispy Salmon Florentine or Prosciutto and Burrata Panino. Most of the guests from the christening seemed to order the crab cake along with the Salmon. The crab cake came with a small dollop of tartar sauce and sat on a small bed of baby arugula and was seasoned and cooked perfectly and didn't seem to have excess filler. The Crispy Salmon Florentine was served on a bed of steamed spinach w/ capers and lemon wedge. IT WAS FANTASTIC! Everyone around cleaned their entire plate. The skin was so crispy and tasty I almost reached over to take my wife's dish and the fish was cooked perfectly. The salmon was had a delicate lemon flavor with a touch of saltiness from the capers.

We were seated immediately and the waiter quickly took our drink orders and brought out some bread, which was warm and soft.To start, we ordered the Prosciutto and White Bean Puree Crostini. For entrees, I ordered the Crispy Salmon and Grilled Vegetables and my boyfriend got the Chicken Scarpariello. The crostini was very good. All the ingredients played well with each other. They gave a lot of prosciutto too, which is awesome because I love prosciutto. My salmon was absolutely amazing. It was cooked perfectly and the vinaigrette sauce added a nice sweet and tarte taste to it. I really liked the presentation of my food as well. My boyfriend loved the Scarpariello. He scarfed it down in 2 seconds. For dessert, we got the chocolate torte. It was a chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. The cake was more like a ganache. It was creamy and heavy, but in a good way. It was good alone, but when you add a little bit of vanilla ice cream, it makes it 5 times better.The service was good too. Our waiter was very responsive. I like the atmosphere of the place as well.

60,pz3Ulbuk7ZiUUbT7oFzmpA,Lori L.,3.0 star rating,"Although the Jersey City location of GP's opened recently in the summer of 2012, the origins of the restaurant reach much further back in time, encompassing three generations and eight decades, to be exact. Grandfather (James Politis), father (George James Politis, Sr. a.k.a. GP) , and son (GP Jr.) all oversaw restaurants in Jersey, a clear love and craft that's been passed down through the family.While the original location of GP's opened in 1977 in Guttenberg, the Jersey City location is situated just east of Hamilton Park. It's an ideal spot, as it allows the restaurant to place a handful of tables outside during warmer weather. On the August morning we came for brunch, we took advantage of the expanded seating and started going through our options for brunch. A quick decision on a shared appetizer and our own entrees were made, and our order was taken promptly, helped by the fact that we were one of the first parties to arrive.Service started to fall short at this point. We'd requested that the appetizer be brought out separately from the mains, but all three plates came out at once, pushing the surface area of our small two-top to its limits. Requests for additional condiments and a second fork (after one dropped off the table) had to be asked for more than once, a rather confusing situation especially given the lack of other parties at the time.As for the dishes: the famed GP's Meatballs make for a solid signature dish. A quartet of them are served per order, and each contains a blend of veal, pork, and beef, as well as a slight punch of garlic; they're flavorful, but surprisingly tough and could have used a little more moisture. The San Marzano tomato sauce was a good complement, as the savoryness and acidity of the sauce made for a foolproof contrast to the protein. A final dusting of parmesan and slivers of parsley add the final finishing touches. I was satisfied with the Chicken Hash I ordered as well, a plate that consisted of peppery chicken hash, two poached eggs, toast, and a side salad. All the components were well-cooked, although the chicken leaned on the drier and slightly underseasoned side, but it made for a filling and well-balanced brunch dish.I'm not sure I'd eagerly return to GP's right away. While the dishes didn't disappoint, neither did leave a lasting mark in my memory.

But when I saw a reply from the owner, it made me feel like they actually care. Even though I did not receive any compensation, or a discount I decided to give it one more chance.To save our time (since their service is always slow) we ordered delivery for brunch. Ricotta pancakes arrived so hopelessly burned, they were black as coal (see pictures). I called the restaurant, they asked if I wanted a refund or new pancakes, I asked for new pancakes. Over 2 hours after I originally placed the order I got my replacement pancakes. And they were burned again! Not as terrible as the first batch, but still burned. The receipt that they enclosed said ""sent back, burned pancakes"" and yet they were burned again. This sounds really had to believe, so took a picture of it as well.Needless to say I was hungry and angry on a Saturday morning.I took time to write this review not to put GP's down, but to let the business owner know what is going on,  since it looks like he cares about customers' experience at GP's.",GP’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Wine, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
76,9LNKSIN49SrT24eZHCYivw,Randi E.,3.0 star rating,"This particular Sunday, I was craving pesto pasta with shrimp, and lucky for us GP's had the dish to satiate my hankering. GP's is a sweet little spot and the menu is typical of an Italian American spot, playing into the family-style feeling emanated by the tall red wall lined with photos.That night a homemade burrata served with green olives, prosciutto,  croutons, peppers and a balsamic reduction was highlighted. The burrata was not stringy and sticky at its center, but it was like soft ricotta, salt-less and rustic.The meatballs drenched in a homey tomato sauce and heavily dusted with grated Parmesan, are the perfect example of GP's mix of familiarity and freshness. A bit of home out, meaty but perhaps over-loved and almost too cooked.The gnocchi were doughy with a floury center, swimming in a thick and creamy pesto sauce. Totally not enough shrimp. The first few bites were all the things that I wanted, but it was heavy. We asked for pesto sauce on the homemade spaghetti with the chicken parmigiana. But the portion was just enough, a healthy balance of overworked protein and chewy homemade pasta. We got the special cheesecake that had a thick layer of sweet fig and was paired with a tangy fruit sauce, a little citrus to cut the intense sweet. There is quality with some slippage but most importantly, feelings of familiarity, like a place where grandma could very well be stirring the sauce and your friend pours the drinks.",GP’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Wine, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

It happens everywhere - political analysts, sports gurus, heck even Yelp is not immune to making mistakes sometimes. I wouldn't go as far as calling a night out at GP's a mistake, but I'd be remiss in not providing my dissenting opinion on this establishment.LocationDead in the center of the Hamilton Park area of JC, directly opposite the park. A bit of a hike from either PATH station (Newport or Grove), although if you're coming via Newport PATH you can at least cut through the mall and the parking lot. Parking is tough anywhere downtown, although the gods smiled and a spot opened up directly across the street. AmbianceThe restaurant itself has ample outdoor seating, making for a pleasant summer evening dine. The inside is more intimate and dark, although with the music that was playing (sounded almost like 90s/2000s alt rock?), I'd hesitate to call it romantic. Pretty nice spot to hang out and eat if the outside section is full.DiningThe servers were pleasant and informative. I opted for the chicken parm while my friend went for the $22 spaghetti and meatballs. You'll forgive me for doing a double take when I saw the price tag. Keep in mind that I am no Iron Chef; I eat out a lot because I am pretty useless in the kitchen. Spaghetti and meatballs are about one of 3 things that I can make well. To have a $22 dish of it on your menu must mean that it is amazing. Either that or the plate should be big enough to feed several small children.Sadly, when it came out, I found out that neither was true.  Neither plate was small, by any means, but it was not the type of place where you can expect to have leftovers (neither myself nor my 105 lb sopping wet companion took any food back). The taste was...adequate. My friend let me try some of her dish. If I had gone into the kitchen and made myself spaghetti and meatballs, it would have come out almost exactly the same. I'm not really sure how else one would make spaghetti and meatballs? My chicken parm was tasty. But then again, so is every single pizzeria in the Heights, without having to pay $20 for it. We washed down our dishes with a glass of red wine and a Peroni. Total per person was $30, excluding tip.OverallNice spot to have a conversation, maybe go on a date. If you are going strictly for the food, I'd recommend either Rita and Joe's or Renato's.ProsNice locationIntimate settingOutdoor seatingConsOverpriced menuUnderwhelming food",GP’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Wine, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I had a bloody mary and a mimosa - the bloody was fantastic (albeit cheap vodka shined through) and the mimosa was balanced well (not overly heavy on that fake juice that some places do).The menu was a bit underwhelming... we had placed our order only to learn afterwards that there were specials: a chicken hash and blueberry pancakes - BOTH those options sounded great.... we ended up getting an array of things (my guy for the eggs baked pomodoro.. the sauce just tasted bland and heavily of canned tomatoes). I got the pecorino scrambled eggs and potatoes (literally.. I got 4 chunks of potatoes, which was disappointing, but the sauteed onions in there was a great addition to me). For $13-$15 a brunch dish, the food was underwhelming.

We wanted to sit outside but the hostess could not make up her mind which table to sit us at. Then our waitress took our order but didn't give us the correct side sauce for the French fries because she forgot when all the food came out. Then she disappeared only to spend more time talking to her friends who showed up and catered more to them than to the other tables. There was another waiter who I had to ask for my refill for my Screwdriver but that took as long as waiting for our food. One of the servers who brings food went to two tables with the wrong food while we were sitting.I also had to call out a waiter to help out another table who got seated but never had anyone else help them. I was literally facing them for a half hour until I got someone to help them. Poor service but food was good. One star is for the chefs for making a salad and the Pat LaFrieda Burger with fries and the other star is for the brunch cocktail price.

Later, when we were ready for the bill, the waiter was involved in a very long conversation with another table (thumbs down) which was annoying (our sentiment was shared by another table).The food is great at this place but I would hesitate to come here on a Friday or Saturday night due to the service (and lack of bread).",GP’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Wine, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Having 3 tvs is tacky . Another suburban move. I understand when a sports bar has several sets. This is an expensive restaurant . The few times I sat at the bar, I found it distracting in a negative way. The food is so average . Prices are strictly Manhattan . For this money you can eat so much better in the city. The clams in tomato broth had sand in them . No one in Italy puts cheese inside tomato sauce . The cocktails are actually good. And the brunch menu is decent. Much better then dinner.

The bar was completely full and even though the bartender offered a drink, I felt uncomfortable to be holding a drink while the waiters busily bustled around me. The meatballs that everyone raved about was just okay, out of the 4 meatballs that comes with the appetizer, some were more blend/watery than others, but the sauce with cheese and basil was nice. My mussel (red) spaghetti was delicious. The noodles were cooked to perfection and the mussels were flavorful without having drowned in butter. The pinot noir (forget brand) was way too acidic and tart! I sent it back to the waitress (who wasn't too happy about it).

My companion was underwhelmed with the selection of by-the-glass red wines, but I was pretty happy with the whites. The artisinal cheese platter was lovely, especially the tiny pots of tomato jam and honey. The escarole and house-made ricotta crostini was nice, a bit spicy but the bread was a bit tough to cut /bite through and there was high fear factor for spillage.

This is not your red sauce specials joint, although I'm sure an excellent spaghetti and meatballs can be found here. This is not Babbo. But it's somewhere in between, and if you are lucky enough to walk in on a bustling Saturday night and grab two seats at the bar, without a reservation, as we did - do it! Otherwise, make a reservation the night or two before. You'll be glad you did.Like I said, we hopped up on some bar stools amidst a convivial crowd of 20s, 30s, and 40s somethings imbibing and eating away. We ordered the much-lauded meatballs, the broccoli rabe side, and a house-made penne with short rib ragu. We thought this would be a reasonable amount of food, but we left STUFFED and carrying half of the pasta back with us. Here's why.GP's gave us an enormous, PIPING hot piece (more like a mini loaf) of amazing bread. It was kind of a cross between white bread and sourdough and the texture was amazing. Crackly crispy crust and the softest, most pliable fluffy insides. I knew I should keep eating it, but with the olive oil and parmesan and salt dip I had made for myself...I just couldn't stop.Then the meatball app came out and it was holy heavens AMAZE-balls. I mean, seriously the best meatballs I have ever had. Soft, succulent, and savory. The sauce was spicy and full of tomatoey goodness. Then the bartender asked if we would like another piece (loaf) of bread brought out for the meatballs and sauce. Before we could answer, it arrived, hot and crispy. I told myself only one more piece, but...So when the pasta came out - that one bowl seemed impossible for the both of us to finish. And it was!Please, give GP's a try.

We were also served a small portion of bread that was warm like it should be, unlike other places where they give you cold bread and this place already has a good start. I ordered the lasagne bolognese and my fiancé ordered spaghetti and meatballs, the meatballs were AMAZING the spaghetti has a hint of lemon that was quite noticeable but it was also good. When I took my first bite into the lasagne it was a hot gooey delightful spoonful.

This time I went for brunch and I really didn't like it. Nothing in the menu was appealing to me, so after going up and down a few times I decided to order the BLT panini. Big mistake, I was truly disappointed when it arrived. The panini consisted of two slices of toasted white bread, bacon and a thin slice of tomato. Done. Needless to say, it was completely underwhelming. Service was friendly, but not efficient. After they brought our food, no one came to ask how it was, or see if we needed anything else. No one checking on drinks and also no one offered coffee or the dessert menu. I do like their $10 brunch drinks and $1 refills, it's a great deal, however, with so many good restaurants in the area, I wouldn't go back here. Their menu is way too bland and boring.

When I went to Hamilton Inn last week, it seems like things were not in their normal portions. Anywooooo, the waitress was really sweet, and pitched the food very well. I'm always the one to ask questions like- ""Is the Horseradish Creme Fraiche really strong? Because I'm not a huge fan of it."" To which she replied, ""Not overpowering at all."" And I have to give her a point because once I tried the Short Ribs with a Horseradish Creme Fraiche, I decided that I actually enjoyed the mild taste of horseradish. It was almost cheesy. I actually just ate my leftovers for lunch and I was excited to do it. I'm not going in order but who cares. I chose the Beets with Ricotta Salata, Sunflower Seeds and a citrus dressing. It was delicious and very pretty to look at because they used red and golden beets. Such a great combination of flavors that I would go back for. As a drink I got the Pomelo Fizz, and enjoyed it. I just love Pomelo. When I was little, I use to play with the skin after my peeled it because it was like a cottony pillow.Garreth G. originally got the Almond Cake with Pear Puree, and it was good, but not as good as my Chocolate Torte... which as you can see from his review... he ate it all.",GP’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Wine, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

My wife ordered the chicken parmigiana (was in the mood) and I ordered the Housemade Pappardelle, Duck Ragu. I have to say that was truly a very tasty dish. I would recommend that to anyone it was superb and not really heavy at all. Lastly the staff brought a sparkling candle to my wife to celebrate a birthday with chocolate tart and ice cream.

We were originally going to go out for Restaurant Week, but decided on checking out GP's instead. Made a reservation and off the group of us went. When we arrived, our table wasn't quite ready. That was fine, we made our way to the bar. There was no drink specials menu (but they had only been opened 3 weeks), but the bartender told us there was a cucumber margarita. Our group decided to replace the tequila with rum, but still a very good drink. However, I did think the bar tenders were a little inexperienced, super nice, but our drinks were not uniform, and they made up for it by adding more ice.While waiting, drinks in hand, we checked out the decor:I really enjoyed the old vs. new, industrial vs traditional. However, the area near the kitchen? did not fit in at all. Different wall lamps and chandeliers. It was like a different restaurant was added on - did not fit with the rest of it. Also, the ""chandeliers"" over the bar. Not sure if it was because they had just opened and they hadn't finished the product, or if they broke while being hung, but they were missing a bunch of bottles. We also found it a little odd that the photos on the wall were about twenty years older then the restaurant itself. Moving on to food and service:Loved the bread and oil. Bread was SO delicious. Did think they needed more oil, but not a big deal. We decided to pull the ""food critic"" move and order a bunch of plates to share.We gave our order all at once and informed our waitress to just bring it out, as it came up as the group would just be sharing everything. Well, that didn't happen... the salad and the cold apps came - but only after about 25 minutes. Another 25 minutes after our plates were cleared for the hot apps and another 25 after those plates were cleared for the ""main."" Our waitress apologized and say she was trying to space everything out... but it seemed like she wasn't paying attention.  Originally we pinned up our waitress's tardiness and disappearing acts on the fact that the GP's was packed, however, we saw her a couple of times talking to other servers. Our server could also could not answer many questions we had about the food. I will add though that while our server seemed a bit absent, the rest of the staff was fantastic. The manager came over about four times to make sure everything was okay, along with about two or three other servers who checked up on us.I do think the food was a little pricey for the portions, the food was very good. My personal favorites were the Escarole & Ricotta and the Gorgonzola Polenta. Unfortunately, the clams, which are my best friend's favorite dish, were the most disappointing. The clams were gritty and one of the top ones was unopened. She also felt it should have come with a crostini of sorts for the sauce.

Main courses were lasagna and duck papardelle. Both were great. The lasagna was a little more ricotta-ish than I prefer, but very nice flavor and a huge portion.

He ordered the chicken hash and I got the bolognese with a side of meatballs because I was in the mood for lunch. The bolognese tasted like a quick cook meat sauce. The sauce was too acidic and lacked richness. The pasta was served past al dente. The meatballs were not properly heated through and came out cool in the center.  The texture and taste were just okay.  The bf thought the food was bland and flavorless.  The quality is what I would expect from a takeout pizza place not a brunch priced the same as L'Artusi in the West Village. I assume the service was slower than normal because there was a party going on inside the restaurant and there was only outdoor seating available.  Having worked in the restaurant industry before, I try to ask for everything I need from the server in as few trips as possible but our server, while polite, wasn't really available.  We eventually had to flag down our hostess  for salt and pepper, tabasco, and parmesan cheese (none of which I would normally ask for if there was already flavor in the food).

Misses:The chicken parm  was a thin breast, very light on the bread crumbs, and seemingly fried with oil not hot enough.  The end result was a thin wet breast, although the sauce was quite good.The Meatballs were also a miss.

Bread was plain and bland - I'm guessing a ""rustic"" white that the olive oil did nothing for. The seating left a lot to be desired - the only tables available in the small location at 6:30 on a Friday were by the cold, drafty door or the very noisy kitchen and espresso machine that was covered not even by a door, but with a sheer curtain.And this is a bit of a strange nit to pick, but the staff was actually too attentive to the point of annoyance. Normally I don't mind people being helpful, but having multiple people stop by the table mid-entree to inquire how we're doing within 15 seconds of each other is overdoing it.

For starters we tried the meatballs, the polenta gorgonzola,  the fig and ham appetizer, and the kale salad. All were good. The meatballs were tasty but we just had meatballs at another JC restaurant that beat them a bit. Still, they were quite good and with a delicate tomato sauce. The fig and ham appetizer had great components and tasted good but was a little difficult to eat. The kale salad was tasty and probably the best we've had recently and comes with toast with a gorgonzola spread. The polenta was the standout and was delicious. It was served over grilled vegetables which alone tasted great but may have been a bit more charred than I would want for the dish. It was still really good. For main courses the pappardelle with duck was excellent with perfectly cooked pasta and tasty shredded duck ragu. The eggplant rollatini was pretty good but the cheese probably overpowered the taste of the eggplant and the sauce for me. The lasagna was the standout with melt in your mouth pasta great flavors. For desert, the strawberry shortcake was fresh and good and the tiramisu can hold its own against most others I've had. The espresso taste came through on the lady fingers but was not overbearing. The server could have been more knowledgeable since when we asked what cheese was on the lasagna he simply said four cheeses. Also, we were surprised that they would not substitute potato as a side for the crispy salmon. The standout food items and the decor and ambiance pushed this review to 4 stars.

However, my last visit 2 weeks ago is my absolute last. I have never walked out on a restaurant before but the HORRIBLE AND TERRIBLE customer service warranted it. What a shame because this place has potential. My friends and I arrived and were promptly seated outdoors for brunch but it all went downhill from there. Took ten minutes for our waitress to take our drink order. I had to flag her down again to take our actual food order. Nearly 40 min later I realized we still hadn't had any food nor did once anyone come to keep us updated or even refresh our water!! (Yes I realize 40 min is a long time to realize we had no food but we were having good conversation to notice at first.) at this point I went up to the hostess stand (why there is 4 of them is beyond me) and requested our waitress, who then comes to ask me what the problem is. Um our food?? Where is it? She says she'll check and never comes back. At this point, all the tables around us have new people and they're starting to get their food!!! Are we serious?! Then a manager comes up and starts to tell me there is problem in the kitchen and I tell her that cannot be the case when people who were seated after us are getting their food. She says brunch will be on them and takes a new drink order for us. Only to bring us the wrong drinks. We couldn't even complain because nobody came to check on us. Well nearly 1.5 hours after sitting their with a lack of attention and customer service, we just got up and left. The whole experience has soured me and you should all be warned. I've been working in the hospitality industry for over 15 years so I know what good customer service is and clearly this place is declining in that respect.
