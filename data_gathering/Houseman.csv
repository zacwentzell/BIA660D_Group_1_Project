6,To7h4NUOUug37mW1zBjT5Q,Jasper W.,2.0 star rating,"Let me start by saying I have been to Houseman a handful times. I live around the corner, so when it opened nearly three years ago we were excited to get something new in the area. I was not thrilled by my first visit there back in 2015 but went several more times because my girlfriend really WANTED it to be good. We both did, but it honestly wasn't for us. We would go in and leave being sort of just disappointed. A lot of menu items where you read the description, order, and then the way the plate comes out is something completely different than you pictured. That is good in some restaurants - I know diners love it. But the problem here is that a lot of times the dish just doesn't quite work. Actually, I have experienced this at a lot of restaurants that are categorized as ""New American."" I know I am being vague, but it's just not tasty! Sort of bland or under-salted or just a mix of things that are just that - a mix of things - not necessarily some amazing odd combo the chef created. Not bad, but just not something you want again....Now we get to the point of my review here, which indeed is partly about my Houseman experience, but also about a recent Grub Street ""Best of NY"" list - which got me back through the doors of Houseman. Before last night it had easily been two years since I'd gone to Houseman. I had made my opinion of the place and just never go anymore. This Grub Street list purported that Houseman has the best steak-frites in New York City. Now the list was interesting because it avoided the classic NYC steak house places and was more centered around bistros and smaller restaurants that don't solely focus on steak. Cherche Midi was #3 on their countdown which made me trust in the list, because I have been a huge fan of the steak-frites at Midi and indeed do the solo bar move they outline myself quite often. I felt like they knew my sleeper steak spot so they must know what they're talking about. The steak at Houseman was not nearly as good as it is at Cherche Midi. However it was exactly what I would expect at Houseman. Some twist on a dish that you didn't want or need but are getting anyway. There is nearly no crust on the meat - no Maillard reaction going on. It's as though it were sous-vide'd and then just rolled around and sautéed in a semi-hot pan for about a minute to get the outside a little brown. A lot of medium-rare beef throughout, not a lot of the flavor of the exterior which is personally why I eat steak. To Houseman's defense, reading the piece on Grub Street again right now, it sort of outlines that the steak would come out this way. Steak or no steak, my opinion on Houseman is exactly the same now as it has been. As Yelp puts it for two stars, ""Meh.

For my money, I'd happily go back.  Dressed Egg - Want more.Burger - I'm a burger snob.  This one made me happy. Great Burger: bun ratio. Not over the top can't pick it up, but you can still eat it with a fork. Not overly dressed with fruits and veg and what not. A solid, tasty, much needed burger.Fries - Hit the spot.  Clearly double fried as they should be, they begged for mayo.Also, the table are made from old bowling alley lanes.  Phenomenal. Stopped our conversation to comment on them.Kitschy named drinks are top notch, small but perfectly crafted. Perfectly crafted.  On a cold Monday night.  When many restaurants look the other way. And get through the evening.  Everything was made as if I really mattered to them.  Oh and the chocolate sundae with caramel corn was a lovely way to end the meal.

Not over the top can't pick it up, but you can still eat it with a fork. Not overly dressed with fruits and veg and what not. A solid, tasty, much needed burger.Fries - Hit the spot.  Clearly double fried as they should be, they begged for mayo.Also, the table are made from old bowling alley lanes.  Phenomenal. Stopped our conversation to comment on them.Kitschy named drinks are top notch, small but perfectly crafted. Perfectly crafted.  On a cold Monday night.  When many restaurants look the other way.

I understand the group in front of us was just taking their sweet time, but at least do something to make us feel better about the wait (maybe a complimentary cocktail or two)... but whatever...Service overall was efficient but not that friendly... the overall ambiance of the restaurant was a turn-off for me. The place is loud, topped off by loud, annoying music of a particular taste (not mine).This could have been easily overcome by the food. But there just too many mistakes. Out of all of our dishes I think the beef sausage was the most successful. Things that fell in the mediocre category: the fried fava beans, the ""hummus"", and the pork terrine... not sure why they burned the delicious bread they sent out, but this goes to the main issue I have with this place. Just too many mistakes...Okay, so the beef tongue was probably prepared how they wanted it, but it wasn't my friend's cup of tea (too mushy). The roast chicken- perfectly cooked, and the taste was there. Waaay too salty... Speaking of which, my burger was great, but again waaaay too salty. And while we're on this theme, the mushroom dish, waaay, waaay, too salty.What the hell?! Either the chef has a heavy hand with the salt, or someone in the kitchen was just not paying attention.

46,1sxXLUKn6qCCVRJPhRNVYQ,Ken S.,4.0 star rating,"KenScale: 8.0/10I visited Houseman last fall and had a lot to like about this unassuming place that serves really solid New American dishes. One of my acquaintances had been eager to check out this place for a while, and I figured a revisit was in order after more than six months since my last visit. The second visit was also quite a delightful affair.The daily changing menu at Houseman doesn't wow you with any fancy ingredients or techniques, but I can tell that the kitchen has put a lot of thoughts to the dishes. It's really hard to find a bad dish at this restaurant. Spicy shrimp with peas, herbs and radishes had the mild spicy flavor that worked quite well with the vegetables around it for a nice appetizer, and the spread of roasted sweet garlic (and some anchovies on top) all over the grilled bread somehow worked better than I had thought the moment I saw the dish. The roasted half chicken, which I had tried on my first visit, was just as good as I had remembered, with moist and juicy meat that worked nicely with dandelion greens and anchovies for a very satisfying meal. The big surprise was the burger. Nowadays, every restaurant in New York City seems to have a burger as a crowd-pleaser, but that doesn't mean the burger is done well even though it's hard to screw up. The one at Houseman had that awesome texture of beef with surprisingly nice balance of flavor without too much seasoning. It is really the seasoning that distinguishes a good burger from a great burger. While I'm not ready to call Houseman's burger the best in the city, it was definitely one of the better ones I've had recently. Among the dessert options, we weren't really sold on any of them on the menu, and decided to go with the off-menu dish of sour cream ice cream with candied almonds and strawberry. Turned out to be a great call as we thoroughly enjoyed the delightfully sweet dish. As I noted in my previous review, Houseman really epitomizes the type of neighborhood restaurant that I want to see more of, with minimalistic décor and warm and welcoming vibe that, combined with well-executed food from the kitchen, would make for a pleasant dining experience at any given night.",Houseman,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Burgers,, Wine, Bars"

51,WrVRNjvf8yLeF3361qXCxw,Lawrence H.,5.0 star rating,"A great new addition to southern West Village or northern Tribeca (whatever you wanna call it), houseman delivers a simple menu with merely a few choices that are well-executed in a comfortable space, reminiscent of New England. I came in one day and sat at the bar, even though the restaurant was remarkably empty. Maybe it was due to the fact that the place had just opened only three months before. In any case, the menu was a sight to behold: boxes within boxes, with drinks intermixed with entrees on one side, a curious weather report on the top, and wines by the bottle and beers on the reverse. A surprisingly short list of entrees (only three) with a fairly long list of appetizers were all the food they served, and when asked about the specials, the staff member I spoke to simply replied that they didn't have any that day. I ended up deciding on the beef tongue with tomato salad as an appetizer (a perfect late summer starter), and the famous roast chicken with parsley salad as a main. As anyone who's had tongue before, it is either hit or miss, but the gamble proved to be worthwhile as houseman's lengua was deliciously tender, as if the cow had a glib penchant for linguistics. The famous roast chicken was a contradiction -- the crisp skin somehow betraying the succulently moist meat, which was perfectly flavorful, but simple and downright homey in its seasoning. The breast meat could've been a little more moist (perhaps by brining or sous vide), but it was probably the most tender white meat I've ever had at a restaurant. A pickled onion relish and parsley salad rounded out the plate nicely.Desserts are presented via a chalkboard, but I ended up getting an espresso, which was perfectly agreeable. The atmosphere is relaxed, but the owner is the opposite, visibly buzzing around nervously from table to table. Perhaps it's because it's the first few months. Nonetheless, the service is professional, cute, and made me feel right at home. I'm eager to see how their menu changes with the seasons as the restaurant matures into the winter.",Houseman,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Burgers,, Wine, Bars"
52,V2R5oOmblUOTu0Ed_NuxrA,Priscilla T.,3.0 star rating,"Yeah, no. Supposedly one of the best burgers in town. Supposedly super innovative and delicious menus. Nothing was bad but nothing was inspired either. The burger patty itself was very tasty and umami-filled but the overall concept was lackluster (just caramelized onions and cheese) and I really don't like smushy potato buns which just sop up juices and turn into a soggy mess in your hands. I also much prefer raw onion to caramelized onions on burgers.The fried fava bean snack was literally just a handful of fried fava beans (and tastes the same as the kind you can buy in a jar at an Asian/Burmese market) and the sort-of-deconstructed deviled eggs were not even close to a substitute for actually-deviled eggs. Little gem lettuces salad wasn't bad but really... it's just some leaves and dressing smeared on the plate.And then there was the dessert menu. Laughable was the first word that came to mind. Did your pastry chef go on vacation and the best you could come up with was a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sliced cantaloupe? The vanilla ice cream was actually really nice but I have no idea if this was brought in or actually made in-house.It's a cool space but this is definitely in the category of places to be seen and be trendy, and not places to be wowed and satisfied by the food.",Houseman,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Burgers,, Wine, Bars"

Ahh, still thinking about it.  For apps, we had the little neck clams (6-7 large pieces for $16) marinated in celery broth, divine.

We both enjoyed our meal, but I do agree with Pete Wells' NYT review, which noted that the burger is too good to be served on a rather cold, unwieldy and large bun.

Admittedly, the tables are close together as the place isn't huge, but just far enough to not feel like it's communal dining. The waitress was wonderful - she took time to explain the menu (which isn't too huge, but nice and varied) and before long we were dining on spring lettuces and herbs and a bean and roast cauliflower dip. Both delightful. We then moved to entrees - I had the braised lamb and my girlfriend has the burger. The lamb was tender and gamey, complemented well by the golden rice. Tasty and satisfying. The burger, however, was one of the best I've eaten in a while. Perfectly cooked and seasoned, juicy meat, with Swiss cheese, mushroom and grilled onions. Just perfectly sized, I managed a bite before my girlfriend wolfed it down with her fries, and a satisfied look on her face.

I was meeting some friends for dinner and one of them suggested Houseman. I had been wanting to try it so I was excited. We walked in for an early 6:30 reservation and as stated, the atmosphere was very chill and relaxed. We sat at the bar to wait for the rest of our party and ordered a few cocktails. The bartender was great, explaining drinks and making suggestions so I went with the gin and cucumber drink, light on the sweet stuff and it was amazing. The Pimms' cup has a major kick given the extra gin they add and that was very good as well. They have a great Sekt by the glass, something you don't see enough of. We were seated when the last of our party arrived and we were very chatty which I think annoyed the waitress a bit. I ordered the fried fava beans to start, they're nothing like the fried chick peas you get at places like Tia Pol so feel free to skip them, a bit bland. For food I ordered a plate of french fries, yes seriously, and the charred broccoli with hummus and fennel. The fries were great as was the broccoli, it's served with toasted bread that makes this a pretty hardy dish. My bf ordered the burger which is the way to go here. Even though I'm not currently eating meat I had to take a bite and it was well worth it, order it. The other two people ordered the chicken.

77,jroyKvMcUqBuJjjRQ5CzBw,W L.,4.0 star rating,"New American food is just the best. I think Houseman was really close to making some top 10 list on the NYTimes a while ago... It's like a fancy hipster restaurant that can potentially create a hole in your wallet. The menu is simple and short. They're known for their chicken, but I found their desserts to be the most memorable. Get the ice cream/malt(?) for dessert.",Houseman,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Burgers,, Wine, Bars"
