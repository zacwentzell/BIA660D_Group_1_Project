She spoke ill of her co-workers to other guest.  By far the worst service I've experienced here.  I can understand maybe the locals or the ppl who frequent like this type of attitude but if she realized according to her that she was too old to be doing this she needs to stop because the way she spoke to customers on the phone and treated us her waitressing days should have been over.  Oh and the food was drenched in grease I had a hair in my eggs , his cheese in his omelet wasn't melted but due to her nasty attitude I wasn't in the mood for more had I complained.",Tommy’s Family Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Diners,, Greek"

My husband's only complaint is that they need to leave it on the griddle for a few minutes longer so there's some crispy bits in there.Maria, the woman who took care of us during my first meal there, was a sweetheart!

54,njDtnNhFpzCIy-rQP3I_PA,Cindy B.,5.0 star rating,Great little neighborhood dinner with a great service and excellent food. My favorite breakfast food which I will deny admitting ;) is the eggs and corned beef hash with home fries!  The best thin slices home fries this side of JC!  The corned beef hash is perfectly made on the griddle and NOT greasy!  I've had their panini a as well which are super yum!  And their meatloaf with gravy and mash is a tasty treat as well!  Made Hercules snow storm melt right away!,Tommy’s Family Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Diners,, Greek"
55,9D20jcweMX3yPUAaXja1Qw,Emily D.,4.0 star rating,"Really great, traditional diner breakfast. The French toast was fluffy and rich in the perfect way. Home fries are heavenly and omelettes are big. Bacon was perfectly cooked and portions are large (like you expect from a diner.) Have had breakfast sandwiches to go before as well and they are my favorite so far for The Heights. I do have to say that the corned beef hash wasn't ideal- it could have been crispier and more flavorful. The coffee was also less than awesome and for me, at a diner, that is disappointing. Staff is friendly and often humorous. Service is fast and prices are super affordable. Overall I still love the place and will certainly frequent more and recommend to others.

The vegetables I did eat were over cooked and brown not appetizing at all with again no flavor and bland. The salad that my meal came with was old and brownish ot looked like it was mixed with new and old lettuce.I gave two stars because I feel bad for the place.,Tommy’s Family Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Diners,, Greek"
60,3SKZZrSqeTPVFfTP7UwVqA,Jennifer C.,2.0 star rating,"I should've left my positive review when I first came here, and left it at that. Unfortunately, my most recent experience here was not a pleasant one. Let me start off by saying this ... there is nothing wrong with the food here. It's your typical diner menu with everything from subs to pancakes (and everything in between). My fiancé loves the meatloaf. The paninis are pretty good, but I always stick with my disco fries, which are actually pretty great here. I have to give credit where it's due.Now, onto my issue. The service here, or lack thereof, is awful. The staff is friendly for the most part, but unbelievably inattentive. I almost never care about things like this, but it is a serious problem at this joint. I'll make a list:1) We were never given utensils and actually had to remind our waitress to give them to us.2) She never checked to see if we needed drink refills (which we did). In fact, we had to ask the CHEF, because it seemed as if she was actively ignoring us.3) I asked for sauce on the side instead of on the sandwich. She brought it to me and said, ""They forgot to put the sauce on the side, but it's okay, right?"" (No, it WASN'T okay, and I wish I had the balls to have said so at the time. I knew I wouldn't like the sauce.)4) We asked for the check and she hung behind the counter chatting it up with a coworker instead of bringing it to us. We watched as she continued for talk for about 5 minutes, before my fiancé had enough and got up to request it again.While we are NOT the type of people to not leave a tip, regardless of the circumstances, we were very close that day. To sum it up, I'm not saying that I'll never eat there again (I'm sure I will), but I'll be sure to just have it delivered in the future.",Tommy’s Family Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Diners,, Greek"

70,JcYF1vJN7-LDsXxMURQ9WQ,David C.,5.0 star rating,"Tommy's is a family restaurant.  You know how sometimes your family makes food that's unimpressive, but simple, and it works?  While arguing in the kitchen about who-knows-what?  That's Tommy's.  This is the kind of place where about half the people coming in the door seem to get a hug.  Where the wait staff remembers what the kids liked last time.  Where the 10 year old coming in the door has baby pictures posted on the wall.  The back half is full of old men who I only assume are widowers, since I've seen them every time I have ever been in, or past, the place.  Like a lot of family restaurants, Tommy's has served as a family for these guys.  That's what a family restaurant does.  Today I watched two older ladies complain about somebody's wife's ravioli for what must have been an hour over 50 cents worth of tea.  Tommy's would never push them out, because this a family restaurant and they respect these ladies.  That's a family restaurant.Tommy's doesn't get five stars for the food.  Or five stars for the service.  Tommy's gets five stars because it's Tommy's.  And just like your grandma, it doesn't matter what you think about Tommy's - it never even crosses your mind to judge it.  You have to love it.",Tommy’s Family Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Diners,, Greek"

72,o631UkRlivHf8xc8xhElPw,Denice D.,5.0 star rating,"Little spot on central ave. Average diner menu options. I've never been during busy hours, but I've eaten in twice and both times I was very happy. First time I had the burger with bacon. I have to say, they nailed the medium rare temperature,  which I didn't think they would. Some of the more sophisticated restaurants I've been too can't even get it right. Second time went for the classic taylor ham, egg, and cheese. They did it with egg whites just like I asked and it was delicious.  Both times service was aloof, yet attentive,  just the way a diner should be.  Space is somewhat small, and if you sit towards the front, you can actually see the cook making the food, which I like. But I know some don't like to sit close to the kitchen. I'm glad I ventured into this little hole in the wall. Great food and nice staff.
