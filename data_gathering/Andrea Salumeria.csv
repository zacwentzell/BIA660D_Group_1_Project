1,nthLJ9vuA3nOw3eORGDMTw,Alex Y.,5.0 star rating,"I have been drooling over all the sandwich pics over the last few months and finally got to chance to visit last week.  It's a bit tucked away in Jersey City heights, so parking could get tough.  Don't give up so easily though, because the extra effort is going to be worth it.Despite the fact that they only show 4 options on the sandwich menu, those are just suggestions.  The staff here can pretty much make anything you want if you want to order.  Speaking of staff, they are probably the nicest people in all of Jersey City.  Perfect atmosphere for a family business, no wonder they have been going strong since 1975.Since I wanted to try everything, I ordered the Soprano, the What's Up, the Combo, plus an extra side of fresh mutz to go.  It's not mozzarella around Hoboken or Jersey City, just mutz...Favorite turned out to be the Soprano.  Loved the contrast of the sun dried tomato against the creamy mozzarella and the perfectly cured prosciutto.  Could have finished the whole thing by myself, but decided to stick with the original game plan and sample the rest of the sandwiches as well.What's Up definitely lived up to the hype as well.  It carried a good bit of heat from the meat as well as the spicy peppers.  The only thing that I would opt out of next time would be the chunks of sharp provolone they put in there.  It was just throwing me off a bit.Overall, a great little deli with extremely reasonable prices for the quality that they put out.  Will be back again really soon.",Andrea Salumeria,5.0 star rating,$,Delis

Really narrow aisle to the counter to order, which made me feel like I was in an alleyway in Italy. Came in around 130pm on a Saturday afternoon with ~8-10 customers in front of us. Line moved really quickly and I checked at the pasta in the frig, meats and cheeses in the glass, and some pantry items on the shelves while waiting.We ordered a ball of fresh mozzarella (they keep this in the back), the what's up (hot everything sandwich with provolone), and prosciutto, Mozz, peppers and balsamic on a hero. Goddamn these sandwiches. Phenomenal floury bread just soft enough on the inside and perfectly crunchy on the outside. Generous servings of meat and mozz on the sandwiches. Everything tasted super fresh with real Italian flavors. Soft mozz that literally falls apart in your mouth. Total bill came to ~$30. I'm nyc, these sandwiches could have costed $18 each. Will most definitely be back.",Andrea Salumeria,5.0 star rating,$,Delis

It's a small place, and if you didn't know it was there you might miss it.  Besides subs, you can buy pastas, sauces, salads galore and so much more. My go to here, is a Chef Salad with Mutz. They mix salami, ham, provolone, lettuce and tomatoes in this drool worthy combo of oil and vinegar. Stuff it in a container and serve it with Italian bread.

4,iHV_Ef7WMAu6u0XNyZgvJA,Sara M.,5.0 star rating,"Like everyone else has said, this is a damn good Italian sandwich. I still have my Hoboken go-to's, but this is no doubt the best that you can find in JC.The reason this sammie is so amazing is pretty simple. It's filled to the brim with meats, fresh mutz and veggies. So basically, it's all you could want from an Italian sandwich and more. The bread is perfectly baked and the portions are massive. One sandwich is easily enough to feed two people. We ordered two for two people and it was an unnecessary amount of food. I ended up eating half for lunch and half for din.I ordered a soprano which had fresh mutz, prosciutto, sopressata and sun dried tomato. The meat to cheese ratio was absolutely perfect and each bite was heavenly. My only complaint is that the sandwich was a bit oily so next time I'd ask them to go lighter. Otherwise, this was a top notch sandwich experience.While the menu is pretty basic lunch fare (sandwiches, salads, soups, etc) the storefront is actually a small speciality grocery store. You can find a variety of cold and packaged Italian grocery items. You can tell that most of the brands are authentic Italian. It's no surprise that Andrea Salumeria is a well known local favorite and is consistently ranked one of the best (if not the best)  Italian sandwiches in NJ.

I'll be making mouthwatering sandwiches for days.The only thing better than the food was the service. Was helped by Vinny and Pete and they went out of their way to make sure I was taken care of.

Summary:- Rating: 3.5- Location: less than a block from Pershing park, and on Central Ave (major street with many taxis / bus lines), making access fairly easy- Service: VERY efficient, nice and amiable for a fast paced place- Sandwiches: I am not a fan of pork based meats, so many of the standard sandwiches did not appeal to me. I tried the Tuna Salad special, which I wouldn't go back for- Mozzarella: clearly their secret weapon, I could literally eat their mozzarella like a bag of chips. I bought a half pound and had to contain myself from eating it all in one sitting.- Others: they have some nice sodas and other items that I have not seen at other deli's, which I will consider trying when I'm a tad bit more adventurousReason to go back: the mozzarella single handedly made the trip worth it.

Delivered on fresh bread, a hefty sandwich, I could have easily just eaten half and saved the rest for later, but it was TOO GOOD! I was in a pleasant food coma once devoured! Not to mention they had multiple golia (black licorice) candies that I HAD to buy since I only get them when my Nonno travels back from Italy. The shelves are stocked with authentic Italian goods from olives, to olive oil, to semolina, and even organic honey. A really neat and delicious place.

So I was a tad confused on where the menu and then realized that its on the side, lol. I went with the Soprano because lets be serious everyone was raving about it on Yelp.The guys here are no joke, full Italian funny guys! Best service with some laughs on the side. They were hilarious, fast and great. So lets get back to the Soprano.. ready.. baguette, fresh mozz, sopresata, prosciutto, and sundried tomatoes. OMG I died and went to Italian heaven. This sandwich was so filling I must admit I only ate half because it really was a big amount. This is deli is also a market where you can get food catered, buy Italian goods like sauce, pasta, oils along with meats, etc. They're pretty much your Italian go-to place in The Heights.If you want authentic Italian eats do yourself a favor and GET YOUR BEHIND HERE!

Warning: As you walk in you might think that there's no menu. There is but there is no sub menu. You basically walk up to the counter and tell the guy what you want. They can make any combination of meat and cheese. You also ask for whatever size you want. The guys there are cool and will walk you through the art of Italian Deli. I ended up getting a 6 inch sub with domestic prosciutto,provolone, lettuce, tomatoes and a splash of olive oil. Simple right? The cost was $11, not bad when you take into consideration the big load of prosciutto that you get.

Had a choice between this place or a few other ones in the city, but I'm really glad I chose this one.The selection of different cold cuts was pretty impressive. For some reason, not too many places in Jersey City carry Boar's Head. Certainly none of the major players do, like A&P, Shop Rite, BJs, Target, etc. So I was glad to see these guys fully stocked with the full spectrum of Boar's Head meats. They also had some imported stuff, like small capicola and dry Italian sausage links.The cashier (one of the owners) was super cool, and I would come back just for the awesome way he treats his customers. As he was slicing up the different cuts of meat for us, he gave us a little background about himself & the store and also treated us to some samples. The sheep's truffle cheese sample blew our minds, so we ended up getting half a pound of that as well.While waiting for our turn to order, we could see people ordering different sandwiches for lunch. The Soprano really got my attention, with the copious amounts of meat and fresh mozzarella cheese. Definitely gonna try that next time I'm here. Might even sneak out here from work during my lunch break.Needless to say, the charcuterie platter turned out excellent (see my pics).

So I had to write this right after finishing my combo sandwich. And yes it is that good.Today was my second time coming to this place, I'm clearly not Italian (Korean) but they made me feel like family the first time I came in and even today. Pete the owner, along with Vinny and Anthony who were this fine Wednesday morning, gave me recommendations and so far I've been lucky to get a sample of meat that they happened to have out twice, probably won't happen again though but who knows. Growing up in an italian neighborhood, these guys have it down perfect and rivals anything you have had, be it manhattan or elsewhere. think of it as the famous Jiro's sushi except for Italian deli meat instead of sushi. They've clearly perfected their craft with this family business that has been here for 30+ years. All the customers who came in the first time I was here Pete knew by name and what other days that they come in to order something.My wife has said their bread could be upgraded maybe softer or tastier, but I told her, ""no, this is the style of the old world before our time"" and nothing should be changed. It is a true Italian deli that has stood the test of time, you can taste the history when having this glorious sandwich. I hope this place continues to remain the same for the years to come. My only warning is once you have had this, you will have great difficulty going back to eating sandwiches at subway, blimpie, or whatever fake italian you used to have.

My friend had been telling me about this places for months without actually telling me the name or where it is. But today, we happened to be by it and he pointed it out.  Once again, he told me this was the best Italian deli ever and that my mind would be blown. I thought he was overhyping it, but he wasn't.We ordered the ""What's Up?"" full sized sandwich. It's $17, but it's absolutely massive. The full size is served as two foot long sandwiches, so you're really paying $8.50 a foot, very reasonable for the quality of the sandwich you're getting. I was surprised to see the guy at the counter pick up a few packages of cured meats and begin slicing them fresh. He chuckled at my surprise and asked me if it was my first time here. They also sliced their fresh mozzarella in nice thick slices. I like that the sandwich also had sharp provolone since I find mozzarella to be too creamy without enough flavor at times. Finished my sandwich off with hot peppers.What really makes this sandwich is the bread. It's fresh, very crusty, and very flavorful. I would've been happy just eating the bread. The meats were also very good, not too salty and a little bit of spice. The combination of creamy mozzarella and sharp provolone with the hot peppers was excellent.

Salty meats and fruity olive oils hang in the air and beckon me inside. Service: Utterly charming.

This is no mass produced deal. The bread is good hearty Italian bread, narrow with a good bite to it. The meats and cheeses are sliced fresh and the saltiness of the sharp provolone is so perfect with the creamy homemade mozzarella. I tried to save half for lunch the next day but caved in and had it for breakfast. Yes i'm weird, but it was delicious. I'm looking forward to going back to snag some of the other items they have, especially some mascarpone. The  guy behind the counter looked intrigued when I told him I make tiramisu ice cream.

Andrea Salumeria is a cramped deli/Italian grocery on Central Ave. They keep things simple: sandwiches. And plenty of them.What separates Andrea Salumeria from most delis is the impossible freshness of the goods.  Hams, salamis, cheeses...all are sliced right there and go well beyond Boars Head or Thumann's.  The sandwiches are immense (a 'half' is just that: half a full loaf of Italian bread).  I went with half a What's Up.  This was a hulking half loaf of crusty Italian bread loaded with  hot sopressata, hot and mild capicola, fresh mozz, sharp provolone, and hot peppers. Hot damn. That was a good sandwich.It won't surpass 2nd Street in my heart (unquestionably better meats, but the bread just didn't add to the sandwich.

The ingredients were all top quality and that is clearly where this place excels. Every piece of meat and cheese was fresh and tasty and complimented the sweet peppers and condiments nicely. I did find that eating the sandwich together was just too much and also that the flavors didn't ""mesh"" together like I wanted them to. I also wasn't a big fan of the bread the sandwich was on. Since the meat and cheese inside was really good, I just ended up eating those by themselves, layer by layer. I also bought some homemade mozzarella and some olives. I was expecting the cheese to be better considering the stellar reviews. I put it in a caprese salad and it was okay, but then I used it in some eggplant Parmesan and it was much better melted. The olives were good. The people who worked there are friendly and helpful which is always a plus.

98,w3czn31CGNmzHFtsWxmuVg,Denise C.,5.0 star rating,"I am a sucker for the following two things: quality cured meat (heh) and quality Italian men.And so, with an insane desire for a traditional Italian hero, I found myself at Andrea Salumeria. Based on the reviews I'd read on here, I knew this place would certainly satisfy my craving. As soon as I walked inside, I was greeted by the guys slicing up goodness behind the counter and immediately got a great vibe from the place. As I waited to order, I noticed everyone, whether customer or employee, had a good relationship with one another. The concept of famiglia was certainly apparent and I adored it - especially since it came from these charming Italian men (again, I nearly melted right there).Although most people come for the sandwiches and salumi, they also sell all kinds of Italian pantry staples: pasta, olive oil, torrone, taralli, arborio rice, anchovies, tuna, and even ""00"" flour. I tried not to turn into a giddy little schoolgirl as I watched my sandwich come together: hot peppers (the original combo comes with sweet, but I like a little punch!) soppressata, capicola, fresh mutz, sharp provolone, ham, and salami on fresh bread. And I also couldn't believe I'd just ordered a mere *half.* The combination of meats was just wonderful and the quality was not overshadowed by the cheeses. The provolone subtly cut through it all, while the creamy mutz provided a nice contrast. The peppers added piquancy, but were by no means overwhelming. The bread was also fantastic. The outside was crisp with a great chew, while the inside was fluffy. It held up very well to the ingredients inside and even at the end of the day, when I went back for my leftovers, it hadn't gotten soggy.There are a ton of places that look like and sell product just like Andrea Salumeria. However, despite that, very few places measure up.

You begin to imagine yourself as the type who throws lavish dinner parties with platters of fine antipasti and imported olives and sh*t.  As you get closer to the counter, prepare for a sensory overload of meat, meat, and more meat.  Pete and the rest of the guys behind the counter are a really great bunch and the service is always top notch.  Watching these guys prepare your sandwich is an experience and they are not stingy with the meat.  I usually switch between the combo, the prosciutto, and Pete's special tuna (all w/ mozz obviously).  While this mozz is delicious as f*ck, I'd have to give Fiore's in Hoboken the slight nod when it comes to best in the area.  Believe me though, you will not be disappointed.  Come here starving, leave with a foot long sandwich piled high for under $10.  Easily a nice lunch for 2.",Andrea Salumeria,5.0 star rating,$,Delis

The place itself is very small, uncooked pasta, olives, stuffed peppers and everything else you would expect in a nice Italian deli on the walls. The meat they have imported and the selection is not huge but well done. The mozzarella is amazing, this might be one of the best reasons to go here. It was soft, had a nice saltiness to it and melted in your mouth like butter. So I ordered a soprano sandwich while I was there with the works. It might have been one of the most enjoyable sandwiches I have had in a LONG time. The meat was great, you could tell this wasn't just shoprite brand meat and they cared what they were giving you. The mozzarella was fresh and had just the right consistency and the bread was not that to soft where it falls apart but had a nice crisp crust to it while the inner was soft enough.

The first time, and every time after, I have ordered the Soprano sandwich on a baguette. It is ABSOLUTELY amazing.

The quality of the meats is WAY above par and they (without a doubt) know how to make their mozzarella. Finally... a great deli and mozzarella that I can get without having to drive to Hoboken. (Sorry Lisa's & Fiore's)The soups on special are pretty good as well. I always need just a tiny bit more for lunch than just a sandwich.The service is so pleasing.

We were greeted by a very nice dude who sort of looked like an italian Ben Affleck. He was happy to chat, and we told him it was our first time and we wanted the Soprano because that's what everyone on Yelp recommended. He started piling on the sopressata, giving us samples, and wow was it good. It reminded us of our trip to Salumi, which is Batali's place in Seattle that makes my personal favorite sandwich. Then, the big boss chef comes out and says he overheard us talking from the back and brought us out some fresh, and I mean, FRESH, mozarella. Holy. I mean, words can not describe, the perfect texture, flavor and best of all, it was slightly warm, not too melty, not too solid. Perfection. I was thrilled to see our sandwich maker load up on the prosciutto and this fresh cheese. He recommended a drizzle of oil and balsamic, with some lettuce tomato and oregano.

The meats and cheeses are all top notch. The hoagies are to die for.

I called them first time to ask for mascarpone cheese and then called second time to ask for ladyfinger cookies. The owner(I guess so) answered my calls and was a pleasure talking to him. I reached 5 mins after their shop closing time due to bus delays but he still helped me with my stuff. He immediately recognized me as the person who had called twice. He was such an amazing person that it felt nice to meet him. Got all that I was looking for and so much more.,Andrea Salumeria,5.0 star rating,$,Delis

Who ever said that their sandwiches are ""decent"" or ""fair"" must not have any taste buds or just doesn't know a good sandwich. I always opt for the ""Whats Up"" which has a nice spice to it or the ""Soprano"". This place reminds me of the flavors you'd find in a good Salumeria in Italy. The sandwiches are just amazing and I hear their salads and antipasto are just as good. I just can never resist the temptation of getting the sandwich when I go there. The staff and owner are almost as great as the food they prepare.

Then drizzled with a little olive oil (and I added some balsamic vinegar for good measure)....The best part about it...As one of the workers was making my sandwich and taking the time to ensure that the Olive Oil and Vinegar were perfectly drizzled over every part of my sandwich, he says ""You gotta take pride in what you do right?""  God, if more people treated their sandwiches like that...It'd be a better world. lolPLEASE PAY THEM A VISIT!!",Andrea Salumeria,5.0 star rating,$,Delis
