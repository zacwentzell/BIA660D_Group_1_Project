1,La9hZPz1y_6LTcTfgNMaQQ,Marc F.,5.0 star rating,"Great spot for artisanal pizzas. Went for a snack before a late dinner on a rainy Saturday. It was pretty empty at the time so no problem finding a table and the hostess and waiter were attentive and accommodating. I shared a medium San Gregorio specialty pizza. The dough was cooked to perfection: just firm enough to hold the delicious imported pepperoni --crispy cups of flavor -- sliced sausage, basil and mozzarella. The sauce was a little on the light side but was tangy enough to balance the sausage and 'roni. The crust was excellent as well -- crispy and crunchy without being difficult to eat. They also have a really extensive craft beer collection -- nothing too exotic or rare, but definitely a wide variety for the beer lover. 9/10 would go again",Urban Coalhouse Pizza + Bar,3.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, Pizza,, Italian"

45,sqQ5wgiR5hZrH84b06iRVg,Chris C.,5.0 star rating,"I've been waiting for Urban Coalhouse to open its doors and this week they finally did with a soft opening. On the corner of 14th and Bloomfield, they occupy the spot Puerto Spain was once located. I've heard good things about Tommy's Coal Fired Pizza (Paramus/Brick/Red Bank) and I'm a fan of Tommy's Tap & Tavern in Sea Bright. When I heard they were coming to Hoboken I was pumped. The place was gutted and completely redesigned. The spot now sports a modern look, lots of exposed brick and a big open air design thanks to sliding glass panels in the front of the restaurant. There's a big bar and plenty of flat-panels to catch the games. Hi-tops and regular dining tables fill the rest of the space and an outdoor seating area extends down the Bloomfield side. They definitely nailed the cool vibe part of things. There's a strong selection of brews-- from staples and classic imports to seasonal and craft beers. I didn't notice the vino choices but if they put as much thought into the wine list as they did everything else, wine drinkers will not be disappointed. The bar is the reason you're going to stay here longer than you planned, but the reason you're going in the first place is the food. Calling this place a pizzeria is a disservice. It's an upscale casual establishment with an solid, simple menu. Their pizza is excellent, their meatballs would make nonna blush, and their wings are out of this world.The wings. Oh the wings! They ain't from Buffalo and they ain't deep fried. They're  seasoned, oven roasted and served on a hot platter with onions and a long hot. Magnifico!The prices are fair. Maybe even too reasonable for Hoboken. I'm not sure a bottle of Bud Light is still gonna be $4 a few months down the road but they have a decent Happy Hour with $2.50/$4.50 drafts and discounted apps. My only knock on the place is they're still working the kinks out. They ran out of pepperoni which I'm pretty sure is a felony in the Old Country. They also didn't have a couple of other menu items and a few of beers. The staff struggled with the POS system. The food runners sometimes seemed unsure where they were running. Despite all of this, everyone was friendly and attentive. None of those hiccups made our visit any less enjoyable. That's why there are soft openings. I will return. And whoever you are Tommy, keep up the good work. Not a lot of people in this business get it.

Our group ordered 3 personal size pizzas, & 1 buffalo chicken salad. 40 minutes went by, & nothing came out. At this point, we caught the waitress's attention to ask her when we could expect our order. She said, ""I know, the kitchen is backed up,"" Another 20 minutes go by, we see them bringing out other orders. We get the feeling there may have been a mix up, but no one comes to address our table. Finally after an hour of waiting & no food, our order arrives & one of the pizzas is missing 2 key ingredients. At this point, we flagged over what appeared to be a manager, showed him the pizza & he offered to replace it if we could wait longer. He said there was a promotion going on (what promotion??) so the kitchen was busy... we didn't want to keep waiting, so just asked him to bring out the missing ingredients, which eventually came. All in all, the pizza was fine, but there are MUCH better pizza places in this town with nicer & FASTER service. Our waitress never came by to ask how the food was. Our water glasses sat empty.

59,5NRc2NEqsVN4EKNJBfvMVw,Anna T.,2.0 star rating,"I've passed by this place a few times and wanted to try it out. It looks like a decent place from the outside. My friends decided to swing by since they were around the way and I decided to meet them. I was super hungry and after reading some comments and perusing their menu I was apprehensive about coming here.                 Once arrived, I noticed my friend at the bar and made my way there. The bartender handed me the drink and food menu and told me the specials. $4 well drinks, $4 house wine, and $2.50 coors light. Not bad for a Sunday night. I ordered my drinks and while I was waiting, I saw servers bringing out pizzas to tables nearby. Honestly, they did not look so great. They were also tiny for the price they had on the menu. For that, I'd rather go to Manhattan. I opted for the broccoli rabe with sausage instead. It was under the sides. Now, they made the price a little ambiguous. I thought that it was only $6 but for some reason the broccoli rabe itself was $12 and with sausage it was a whopping $18. Let's just say I did not know that it cost this much otherwise I would've had a better meal or I would've waited somewhere better to go to. So I finally get the side dish and I will say that they were pretty generous with the dish. The dish contained 3 hefty sausage links however they were not cut. It was such a weird presentation. The sausage was super dry as well. The broccoli was cooked right but I still had to add crushed red peppers and Parmesan cheese for extra flavoring. Needless to say when I received the check I was a little annoyed. $25 for a ""side dish"" of veggies and a coors light is beyond what I expected to pay for for a meal like that. I don't ever mind spending money but the ambiance and dish has to coincide with the cost. It's a casual pizza joint in Hoboken. Come on!

Two of us stand by an open table while the other continues to wait for the hostess.

Thinking it was happy hour (as advertised) we were disappointed to find out that happy hour was only at the bar which has maybe about ten seats with no place to stand if all the seats were taken (which they were). So we order our beers anyway and continue to wait. She comes back with ONE beer and tells us they ran out of Bud Light.

I will say that most of the photos I saw were not very appealing so when we ordered our food, I was pleasantly surprised how good it was! They currently have extended hours for specials but you have to sit at the bar only, so our pies were from the regular menu as we sat in the middle row of seats. Another ++, I usually hate sitting on 2-tops sandwiched in the middle row between tables, but shockingly, there was enough space that not one waiter or patron bumped into me or my bag hanging on the chair. High five!! This tends to happen a million times in small spaces and makes for an irritable dining experience. We had the regular margherita and spinach artichoke pie. I had their Passionate Punch martini and can seriously drink it like candy. Now this is not spinach artichoke pie on the same level as Artichoke Basille's in the city, but it was still tasty. I'm more of a thick crust kinda gal, so these pies are pretty flimsy in comparison. But tasty nonetheless! The old Puerto Spain used to be one of my top 10 faves in Hoboken, but knew it would be coming to an end soon. The place was just too dated and never seemed to have enough business to support a modern renovation, outside of their flamenco nights which were sparingly scheduled. Now, you seriously can't even recognize the place. I'm almost shocked how quickly this place opened with all the red tape in this city that seems to preclude businesses from opening without delay. The only negative is that there are a million TVs like every other place in the city. Do we really need another 'sports bar restaurant'? That would be a NO. Patrons remember, this place is a restaurant first, so if you're going to come in to watch football and start hooting, hollering and screaming profanities from your bar stool, remember you're not the only one there. You're annoying the rest of us who just want to watch the game and eat a decent meal. I'm fairly sure the parents in the restaurant were not pleased with the lone LSU fan so excited he must've had $$ on the game. But that's also a fault on management's part.

Sangria pitcher was nothing but pitcher full of ice , i like my sangria cold but this was ridiculous even the glasses were over filled with ice....LIKE REALLY....by my next glass it tasted so diluted  with water I couldn't taste the sangria at all and they charge $30.00  SHAMEPizza was delicious  i do give them that!NOW let me tell you about serviceAfter the waitress took our order she disappeared i needed lemon and hot sauce I wait and wait thinking that she would come around if I need anything after my starters came, but no... so I kindly I asked another waiter for lemon and hot sauce . He said yesBut never showed up with my request.So my girl got up and reached out to the hostess and asked him what we need.He was nice and with less than a minute he showed with our request.So time goes by and long after we were finished  with the appetizers we waited and waited for the waitress,  25 minutes passed my girl got up again and reached out to the hostess...I CAN KEEP GOING..Bottom line I apologized to my date for my bad choice  next time i  will take her to a better restaurant.And for the record the restaurant was half empty so no excuses I wasnt going to tip but I did it anyway.

95,Io1ovnRk1JJgAcLtxHDlgg,Lauren A.,2.0 star rating,"Meh. Nice looking place. First off, we ordered a beer (fine) and the strawberry basil smash cocktail- the cocktail came out in the smallest glass I've ever been served a cocktail in, ever. While putting it down the waitress said 'the size of this drink is pretty inconvenient' haha whatever that even means. Seven sips later, I ordered a beer which came in a glass with a huge splintered crack down the side. We ordered:  wings, Caesar salad, meat pizza and prosciutto arugula pizza. The wings came out super quickly. They're interesting. You get maybe 10 wings smothered in sautéed onions? It makes you feel like there should be pierogis on the plate instead of wings. With that being said, they're really tender. The menu says the wings come with focaccia bread, but it's actually pizza dough rolls. Not sure they know what focaccia is... The Caesar was fine, a lot of shaved Parmesan on top. The croutons were definitely not homemade which was slightly disappointing. The pizzas were interesting too. They're a pretty big size for personal sized pizzas. But they're thin and hard as a board. We were cracking the slices like crackers.... I think there's just too many local pizza options that outdo this place. All in all, I'd return for some beers and sit at the bar. The food is forgettable to say the least. The waitress was attentive in asking if we were okay, but inattentive when it came to cracked glasses, being unhappy with the size of the $10 cocktail and the fact that we didn't eat half our pizza :(",Urban Coalhouse Pizza + Bar,3.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, Pizza,, Italian"

Very, very thin, and crispy / cracker-like crust. I prefer a crust that's a bit softer. Toppings were great, especially the ricotta on the white pie. Wait service is severely lacking... Wasn't terribly busy when we arrived at 5pm, yet took 15 mins to get anyone to even realize we were here. Food came out quickly, but then we sat for close to 30 mins after dinner, waiting for a check. Hopefully they're working out the opening week kinks. All of the staff were extremely friendly.

I can't stand soggy doughy greasy pizza (maybe when I'm hungover but those days are gone) so it's refreshing to be able to stop in during lunch hours, grab a personal pie, yummy salad and topped with 2 delicious but dangerously potent glasses of sangria, white and red, and walk out smiling!",Urban Coalhouse Pizza + Bar,3.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, Pizza,, Italian"

Long wait for water and drinks - upside bud lights are only $4Food was served by the owner / manager cold.  Clearly there was no attention to detail.  While we ate the warm pizza we hD to send the chicken parm back.  Unfortunate the owner / manager couldn't tell that melted mozzarella was no longer hot.  While a free round was provided and the chicken parm was comped, folks would be better served going to a place in town with a lot less problems.  Btw, the warm pizza was tasty, the chicken parm tasted like it was coming from a franchised restaurant or frozen food box.

110,v-gz7t0VH2UCoeQmDSvwuQ,Nita K.,3.0 star rating,"3 stars for the nice cold beer until they ran out of blue moon. The bartender has no personality to be one and each time we needed something we had to ask for it. Most say ""would you like another beer""? We had the wings to start, and it took her 15 min to clean the dirty plates. Mind you we were like the only customers. It was so bad that when the bartenders were having a convo a customer got up right IN FRONT of them and they didn't even stop, they completely ignored him and he just left. If these were my staff they would be fired. I got the Brussels sprout pie and it came out half cooked. They were so hard I had to send it back. No apology from my bartender, 15 min later my pie comes out while my husband is now done with his. Again, the bartender was too busy in a convo to even care to ask if I am enjoying the second one. Also this by any means did not taste like coal fired pizza, they need to get it right if they want to stand by that name.",Urban Coalhouse Pizza + Bar,3.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, Pizza,, Italian"

115,U5_dsyTUobIvlH-TdQ8ZAg,Denise V.,1.0 star rating,"I came here with a friend and we were seated outside. Server came over right away & took our drink orders. Drinks took awhile to come. After a few sips, I noticed a fly flew right in my drink. (It wasn't there before) but still, Gross!!! I looked for the server who wasn't around and ended up having to ask the host to call her over. She apologized and said she would get me a new one. We received our food in the meantime. Ordered the grilled octopus, plain personal and the personal artichoke pie. Everything on that end was great. However my replacement drink didn't come till I was almost finished with my meal. Still, no biggie. I figured maybe the inside of the restaurant was super busy. So when I went to use the bathroom and saw the place was completely EMPTY, I was a little annoyed, but whatever. The bathroom was DISGUSTING. I still was going to give this place more stars because the food was good. So why the one star?! ...the server actually charged me for the drink with the fly in it! I was legitimately shocked. The manager was nice & refunded the charge, but will I return? Absolutely not!!! Urban coal house needs to reevaluate their basic service skills and cleanliness.
