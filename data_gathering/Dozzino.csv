0,XZIAEE2ZN6yxESKzXiZRqQ,Auggie L.,5.0 star rating,Went for DinnerFood - 5/5. The spicy meatballs are super tender and have a really nice sauce. It has a hint of spice in it but mostly a deep smoky flavor that keeps it fresh with every bite. The pizza is absolutely phenomenal! The dough is beautiful with the perfect amount of elasticity that gives you a great bite but keeps it soft. The cured meats pair perfectly with the awesome dough. Cheese and sauce is delicious and is surprisingly from Australia and the United States respectively proving that anyone can produce amazing ingredients regardless of location or cultural background.Service - 4/5. Quick and friendly. The restaurant is very casual and the service reflects it. They give you a pizza cutter as both your pizza cutter and to lift your pizzas.Value - 5/5. The pizza go for about $14 for a personal pie which is a little above average but the pizza here is so good. The dough will really make you happy to have dined here making it worth every dollar. Awesome value!Parking - Street (Free),Dozzino,3.5 star rating,$$,Pizza

What pizza place doesn't let you customize a pie? For $18 for a small thin pie, it wasn't that great. The server was nice and the BYOB was a nice addition, but not worth the money....

You can call ahead for a reservation, they have plenty of large tables, it's BYOB and the menu is easy to please. Definitely couldn't ask for more. Well, guess it would have been nice to enjoy their bocci courts in the backyard. Will have to come back over summer!The menu has a variety of small plates (salads, crostini, veggies, meatballs, etc) and then lots and lots of pizza options. They were out of a decent amount of the small plates, but luckily had a ton of mouthwatering special to make up for it.  We started off with some bruschetta and ricotta crostini for the table. I wasn't a huge fan of the ricotta (weird texture, sort of looked and tasted like greek yogurt) but the bruschetta was excellent. The tomatoes were so fresh. For my main I ordered off the specials menu - brussels sprouts and pizza with ricotta, pepperoni and caramelized onions. The sprouts were incredible- perfectly crunchy and topped with parm cheese. Two orders came out on a large tray that could have easily fed our party of 10. The coal fired pizza was bomb. Thin, crispy and cheesy with a generous amount of toppings. Only complaint was that there was too much crust. Because the pizza isn't that big to begin with, we weren't left with a whole lot of pizza. Because of that, I'd suggest ordering a solo pizza, or getting at least one other thing if you are going to share.

I loved Dozzino's crust, nice crunch in the right places, thick enough to hold a hearty sauce and toppings, buttery, not greasy, and yet charred from the oven, good foldability, but also good to hold in-hand with just a napkin, should no plates arrive on time. But the crust didn't have a hearty, tasty sauce. Didn't have a decent amount of cheese. And the pepperoni/salami topping on the pie i had was scarce. It smelled great, came out nice and hot, cut into with a crunch. But that sauce was tasteless. It made me upset.

Super salty...The chicken parm sand which came with two slices of white bread on top on a chicken breast with no cheese or sauce. Bread was not toasted.

None which were interested in helping. Finally the kitchen manager got on and explained that they made mistakes and the food was not the best. He also told me that the salt is from the crusts because they put in a high amount of salt to keep it. He apologized for the sand which and also for the wrong pizzas. I asked for the food to be replaced but I was told the only thing I could do is get a refund through Uber eats. They do not deliver to my area and they can't make fresh food.

I found this place on Yelp when I first moved here and probably have come back about fifteen times with lots of different people who have all loved my choice. I would have never found it since it is not on a main road in Hoboken. Thanks Yelp!Firstly, the pizza is amazing and the place is BYOB. They have unique pizza specials and I like that they are personal sized so everyone can get what they want or you can try a bunch. Secondly, the ambience is amazing inside but even better, they have the best outside patio! Not sure how there is no pictures yet, I am going to add one. It has a beautiful tree with lights! It's a great date spot or place to hang with your friends, and the BYOB makes it easy on the wallet.

The pizza itself is ok. We ordered the rice balls which were good but the pizza was nothing special. Another thing was every time we asked for something they were out or they wouldn't tell us what we were actually getting until it came to the table. Examples we ordered a cup of sauce that came to the table cold and we weren't told until it was in front of us that all the sauces are served at room temperature. I don't think cold sauce is the way to go but ok we overlooked that. Then I ordered cooked prosciutto on my pizza which came out cold I asked was it cooked he said yes but prior to the pizza, that was the second strike. The 3rd and final strike was when we walked in we were told to seat ourselves in which we did. One table inside was being occupied and 2 out of 6 outside. It was a nice day so we decided on outside. 4 of the 6 tables were so small it could barely fit the pizza on it so we took one of the bigger tables. When the waiter came to bring us our food he said you guys literally sat wherever you wanted if I would of known you were going to take the big table I would of sat you myself. RUDE!!!!!!!!!

I  picked up two pies to take home.  Maybe they tried to pull a fast one over on us since we did takeout.  So we got the Diavlo, it was eh, the dough was burnt and pretty chewy and there was hardly any cheese.

Delish little perk of knowing the right people ;) I ordered La Roma which is a margarita topped with Sopressata my friend had the Hot Onion, which is on the specials menu. It's a little odd that the specials menu is more extensive than the regular menu, buuuut from what I understand the specials don't change too often so it's more of like a Part 2 situation. I wanted to try a couple of the specials but I am partial to a Red pie, and the majority of the ones that sounded good are white pies. I can eat a slice of a white pie, but not an entire one so that was a bit of a bummer. When the pizzas came out 10-15 minutes later, I was so surprised by the amount of fluff! The dough was so light and airy, it had risen so much. I very much enjoyed every bite of this pie. Still could have used a little more sauce for my taste, but all the flavors were on point.

It's mediocre and not that filling. Each pie is personal sized but leaves you hungry. There's really not much more than dough. Sparse fillings of sauce, cheese and toppings don't make much of the pizza. It just leaves you eating really good dough and not much else.

The space is relatively small with approximately 10 tables big and small, high ceilings and modern finishing gives it that ""artisan"" feel. We were greeted informally by the shop owner who simply waved in the general direction of where we would sit. (He's too cool for school apparently). We chose the brushetta (tomato and basil), DINO (tomato and mortadella) pizza, and the nutella bread pudding. My favorite was definitely the pizza, the dough not too thin and not too thick, fresh sauce and meat couldn't be beat (any rhyming here is completely unintentional, but makes me smile). The brushetta was very fresh, but I probably wouldn't get it again because it taste almost TOO much like home made ones (chopped tomatos, olive oil and basil on dried up bread) so paying the $5 felt excessive. The bread pudding dessert was disappointing as we did not taste any nutella flavors and it sat in a mini cast iron soaked in melted butter.

I would say a solid 3.5 stars.I got there before my bride and her sister so I had to wait, so I popped a beer (it's BYOB) and waited at the counter. When they arrived we were sat in the back, not outside though. The outside did look nice however, the bocce ball court was a little damp otherwise I woulda been out there. Anyway onto the dining experience.I like the reclaimed wood tables and I like the few options they have. We ordered the Spesto Crostini. It was great, but it did need a bit more seasoning just a pinch of salt in that mix would have made this much better. The other crostini's looked great so I can't wait to try them.They did have some specials which all sounded good. They also have these I guess super deluxe artisan pies that cost $18 a piece, WAY to rich for my blood for a pizza unless they are covered in gold. I got the Diavola pie which definitely has a kick, it says red pepper on the menu, I guess for whatever reason my mind envisioned red peppers on the pizza, alas they meant in the sauce or crushed red pepper. Either way it was good. My wife got a white pie with spinach and artichoke. Plenty of spinach very little artichoke but it was very good. Her sister got just the plain pizza which was, well plain. The crust here is excellent and way better than Grimaldi's I loved that my sister-in-law doesn't like crust because I gobbled hers up like it was my job.They do run out of stuff, this time they were out of garlic. Um, at first we were pretty worried. How does a frickin pizza place run out of garlic? And fairly certain every store in Hoboken sells garlic. Unless this is garlic from New Zealand that is harvested only on full moons when wind blows from the east. But either I guess the other stuff is pre made with with the garlic.  But, seriously of all the ingredients to run out of that one is pretty silly.It was a nice place, and I can't wait to come back to try more of the pizza varieties and the marscapone and nutella dessert pie.",Dozzino,3.5 star rating,$$,Pizza

It was nice to have some greens but why only the choice of one salad and no other toppings?

Dozzino has brought that lifestyle to Hoboken.Less is more at this brick oven artisan pizza shop. Menu lists 4 simple sections: crostini, salad, pizza, drinks. Daily specials are listed on the blackboard in front of the bar. Simple ingredients create a great tasting pie. Good thin pies you can share with another person. My two buddy's and I decided to get three pieces + a the specialty crostini and share them. Perfect amount of food. Mark + Lauren where great servers. Telling us about how all the visible wood was salvaged from the original structure. A bocce ball court in the outdoor seating area in the back is fun to play while you wait for your food to come out. Pay with your credit card and you get to have your receipt texted to you via the credit card scanning iPad. Pretty boss! A great spot for people who want to drink and socialize while having a few bites of brick oven goodness.

87,yxGRJ68dkMwY7fRvJai9jQ,Nicole V.,1.0 star rating,"UPDATE: I don't think I will ever be returning here, unless someone visiting requests to go here specifically. Last night was the worst experience I have ever had here. The food, again, was excellent. But we felt like we were a bother to the staff, which should never be the case. A simple evening out: 4 girls, arriving at 8:45 for a quick dinner and drinks. There is 1 table in the front room with 2 people, and in the back a large party. The server STILL asks my friends who arrived a bit earlier than us to sit at the bar and wait for the rest of the party to arrive...with not a soul in the restaurant...We were rushed through the ordering process. 2 crostinis, which seem to get smaller and smaller for the price. 4 pizzas to share. We eat, leisurely, and sip our beers. At 10:00 ON THE DOT, the staff was DONE. They turned off the pleasant Christmas music, started playing YouTube videos of vintage No Doubt and Chili Peppers, blaring over our light conversation over drinks. The lights were turned up. Clearly, we were the last ones in the place, but a simple, ""Hey guys, we're closing up soon"" could have sufficed instead of basically making us feel like we were unwelcome and wasting the staff's precious closing time. I get it, you worked and want to go home. But this is still a business that you need to maintain, and as a very easy party of 4, we did not deserve it. To top it off, they claimed they could not split the bill, and could only use one credit card. I have split the bill between 2 here multiple times. When my friend, who had worked in a bar for a few years, called it bullshit quite kindly, the server got defensive and said, ""Here, do you wanna see our system and how hard it is?"" My friend contested, claiming it really was NOT an issue, just that she knew it could be done. Every staff member was now fighting with my friend, while she kept insisting she was still leaving a great tip on a $90 bill and that the issue was null. I wish I could write to the owners, but I doubt they'd really give a shit.

Also, the ambiance inside and out is great. The inside tables are sort of casual/family style, while the outside is an awesome little Brooklyn-esque garden. At Dozzino you'll find personal-sized gourmet/artisan pies with delicious, fresh, albeit minimalist ingredients. No red sauce, just fresh crushed tomatoes and basil, and a healthy glaze of olive oil on the crust. I've not had a pie here that I didn't like. They also have calzone's on special from time to time. If they have it, GET IT. Absolutely delicious. The way their dough cooks around a calzone is like nothing you've ever had before. Crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside.

My fiancé (who has been there before) and I went on a Thursday...we were seated immediately. Anyways, we ordered the mixed green salad with the apple cider vinaigrette, and to be honest, I think the greens were a little rancid. We also ordered the bruschetta, which didn't have much flavor, the only thing I could taste was salt, a lot of salt. We ordered two pies - the Diavola, which was pretty good and the Bianco, which tasted like nothing but salt. Overall, I was not impressed. I've heard so many people talk about how great the pizza is, so maybe we were just there on an off night. I'd like to give this place another shot, maybe in the summer, with a group when the backyard is open and we can play bocci ball. One thing I did like was the fact that it was a BYOB.****Updated review 8/3/16****Like I said, I planned on giving Dozzino another shot.

We had the room in the back and the outdoor space to ourselves. We all rolled up with our own booze and the food came out.We started off with different types of crustini. They were good. I'm usually not a fan of these, as in me personally ordering them and I don't think I'd come back for them but, they were definitely flavorful and good. One adorned with sweet tomatoes while the other was more of a pesto like sustenance. The meat plates were delicious: very simple, salamis and prosciutto on a pizza platter.The pizzas came out. So this place isn't American style pizza. These pizzas are personal size (someone with a nice appetite) and they are simple and fresh (i.e. not overloaded with cheese or sauce). They were good! The place is set up very stylish with open white walls and dark wood tables and floors. The outdoor space is simple with a patio and tables and chair and of course... a bocce pit!Definitely be back on a night with a bottle of wine for some pizza and bocce. One FYI: They don't have ice!

I arrived about 9:10 and was quickly told that they stopped seating at 9, the waiter had a little attitude when I was told this as well. I was a single diner and there were plenty of seats available but I was still turned away. Well, this was not a good first impression. I returned two days later with friends anxiously wanting to try Dozzino. We ordered  three pies. I ordered a spinach pie and friends ordered a special pie with prosciutto and I can't remember what the third pie was. Well I was quickly underwhelmed. The crust was fantastic but I felt that all of the toppings were skimpy. In short the pizzas were kind of bland. At one point we asked for a cup of sauce to add a little more flavor and the waiter came back 5 minutes later with a cup of sauce which was stone cold. When the bill arrived I then realized that the special posciutto pizza was 19$ Hmm, 19 bucks for a small sized pizza with skimpy toppings.

Not your standard pizza that is only good when you're drunk Hoboken...ahem 7 Stars, Basile's, Bona, etc... and whose mozzarella and peperoni comes from a plastic bag.--Dozzino makes their own fior di latte and dough--charcuterie for toppings is on point--dough is salty and pillowy--can't go wrong with Diavola or La Roma style pizzas, or the mascarpone nutella crostinisQuick seating--We always get seated in about 15 minutes or less, probably because it's off the beaten path.Lastly, just addressing some of the complaints about the service: I've been here probably 10 times, and yes, sometimes they run out of certain things and could probably work on that (which is why i took a star away from my review), but I've always ended up with a pizza on my table and food in my belly when I show up. Regarding the ""rude"" service: I think some people are just a little too sensitive. This is a casual pizza restaurant, its not Per Se. No one should expect the servers to roll out the red carpet. The service is usually prompt, friendly enough, and no one has ever been flat out rude.

That's because they have no freezer. They may even run out of dough. That's because they make it fresh daily. Anyone whose ever been in the biz knows those are GOOD things.

Unfortunately, neither were true in this case. It was early and the place was nearly empty, so that's no excuse.  The server was also a bit disgusting as he had massive amounts of sweat rolling down his face, and didn't bother making himself at all professional or even somewhat presentable. Despite the  place being so empty, he was really pushy in wanting us to order our food.  We weren't taking long, but he wanted our order pratically immediately when we sat down, and was clearly annoyed that we weren't ready.  He asked 2 more times in a span of 5 minutes or so.  Again... the place is empty, I just don't understand what his rush was.The ordering process itself was also a nightmare as they didn't have some of the toppings for the standard pizzas that were on their menu, and were completely unaccommodating in our attempts to work around their missing ingredients.  i.e.  When we asked to substitute their missing artichokes with tomato, they refused.  Apparently tomatoes are hard to come by in a pizza place.Even stranger, our server told us he was doing exactly what his boss (the owner) told him to do.  While taking our order, the server kept looking over at the boss, who was behind the counter listening in to our conversation, and he at one point said, ""yeah, my boss just gave me a thumbs up, i'm saying all the right things"".This pushy, impatient, rude service wasn't only known about by the owner, but was actually directed by the owner.

Our server took at least 20 minutes to take our order on a night that was not that busy. Tables that came in after we did were served first. We also had to hunt him down to get our check at the end of the night. And the bocce balls were MIA.The pizza was delicious, as always, which is the only reason I'm still giving the restaurant three stars.

Lights were on, music was playing, but the doors were locked. The owner clearly saw us and rudely waved us off, he didn't even come to the door. And just a side note, I walk by the place everyday and once the basement cellar was flooded with several feet of nasty sewage water. That was the icing on the cake to A.

It was fantastic - Perfectly amount of salty cheese (no sauce) and the slight bitter, crispness of the kale was delicious. It even made fantastic leftovers the next day.We also had the special squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta. Amazing!And the classic pizza is just perfect.I'm not sure what the issue last time was, but it was like we were in a whole new restaurant this go-around. We'll be coming back often!The only reason for a 1-star deduction, and it's not totally Dozzino's fault, was that the night we were there, there was a VERY rowdy crowd next to us.

The prices are pretty good too for artisinal pizza.For some reason, though, they are occasionally out of seemingly important things for a pizza place. My roommate and her BF ordered once and they basically couldn't get most of the pizzas because they were out of garlic. I called another time and couldn't order the pizza I wanted because they were out of, like, half the toppings.

Seriously, perfection.Unfortunately, the pizzas weren't quite as good - the crust was really nicely done, doughy and substantial, they also clearly used fresh ingredients which is nice, but both pizzas (Diablo and Spinach) were really bland - they looked so much better than they were.  The selection of pizzas is also small and a bit uninspired.I also found the service a little bit awkward, our food came out SO fast - the appetizer came within moments of ordering it, and the pizzas followed right behind, just as we were finishing the last bite of crostini.  We were done with our meal in about 30 minutes - I felt things could have been paced much better.I'm sure I'll be back, since this is a cozy, quiet option just 2 blocks from home - but for just a slightly longer walk we can, and probably will, go to Johnny Pepperoni - a very similar place (BYO, pizza) but with much more innovative pizza options, tastier pizzas, and a broader menu.",Dozzino,3.5 star rating,$$,Pizza
145,YN5HqVhguLFPcZKv5wPCvQ,John B.,1.0 star rating,"Let me start by saying that my family had a private party at Dozzino yesterday afternoon.  It was to start at 2pm.  They had rented out the back room (along with the patio).  Several from our group arrived at approximately 2:15pm.  We were ""motioned"" to make our way to the back area in which we found a long table with chairs and open doors to the patio. The rest of our party (approx 25 people) came at about 2:30pm.  It was not until after everyone had arrived and began to mingle that a server made an appearance and began to slam a large bag of ice down onto the pavement. After several slams he then proceeded to pour the ice chips into a bucket containing glass soda bottles, all of which had been sitting in the sun.  These should have been chilled prior to our arrival, never mind the fact that we were witness to an ice smashing spectacle. Let me add that the soda bucket was left on the patio next to a large collection of scrap iron and recyclables.  I suppose we should be thankful that a bottle opener was provided for us upon the seat of a rusted vespa. Another member of the party politely asked for a glass with ice cubes to which he was told ""we have no ice.""  No accommodation was made nor could they attempt to throw a tray into the freezer.  Isn't this a restaurant? As for the food, there were several plates of appetizers (served buffet style) along with our main entree which was an assortment of different pizza.  I have to say that these were all fresh and rather tasty, however small.  I had to ration each bite to make sure everyone had enough. The same cannot be said for the small plate that contained about two pounds of macaroni.  I wondered if the wind blew, would the pasta blow all over? I never saw such a large amount piled onto such a plate.  The dishwasher broke or that large bowel never arrived from Amazon.  I should mention that the pasta tasted like the left overs you would receive at a Pizza Hut buffet in Vegas.  I couldn't tell you what the tomato sauce tasted like, for it was rather more of a dressing with a hint of tomato.  Since there were no napkins in sight, I contemplated how I was going to wipe the ""tomato dressing"" from my fingers, in the event that it dripped.  I'm happy to say that the server made his second appearance of the day and brought us PAPER TOWELS from the BATHROOM.  Then came time for the cake.  Fortunately, my relatives ordered their own cake.  Plates and a knife were slapped onto the table and we served our own pieces.  It made for a nice cake-cutting ceremony.  Let me add that while we consumed our cake, we continued to drink the last of our warm water, soft drinks, and wine.  Another server came along and announced that he was taking coffee orders.  My Aunt asked if she could please have a regular coffee with milk.  He stared her down as if she had asked to go tubing down the Hudson with the other trash.  His reply was that the restaurant did NOT have regular (or decaf) coffee but he could make an espresso, latte, americano, etc.  We ordered all of the above.  They came to the table like slop in a cup. My latte was watered down, COLD, and stale. I wouldn't ladle that crap down the throat of a diabetic.  Just horrible.  WE continued to CLEAR OUR OWN PLATES AND SILVER WEAR before the end of this extravaganza.  Please beware: If you are planning on using the Men's restroom -- the light does not work.  You will have to keep your hands out in front of you, like a good old fashioned game of hide and seek.  Let's just hope you don't find anyone in your travels to the sink.  Don't expect soap or paper towel to dry your hands, because you will be more concerned with the flickering Christmas lights around the mirror. I fumbled to find the handle to the door, all the while hoping I wasn't going to seizure before I let myself out.  A short time later, we proceeded to leave.  Normally, I would thank the wait staff but the crew of five were too busy texting while sitting on the counter. This is the feeling one must get when they try to sneak out of someone's 3rd rate bbq (after they've crashed it).

Here's the thing, It's a simple BYOB pizza place set in a casual atmosphere with enough upscale finishes to make for a great date night. Maybe the nice atmosphere causes people to expect more from the service, but it's not a fine-dining restaurant, it's still a pizza place, and a VERY good one. I've worked as a server for many years, so I'm usually a stickler for poor service, and for me I've never had a problem at Dozzinos. I love that it's somewhat casual, they set a bottle of tap on the table, wine glasses are the same as water glasses (which is how they serve wine in trattorias overseas), the waiters wear a simple tshirt and jeans usually so it's just a cozy comfortable atmosphere. It makes me feel like I'm right at home. It does get busy on the weekends, so definitely aim for a weeknight if you want to be seated right away. Don't be fooled by the one-starrers...some of these reviewers seem uptight, leaving one star because they couldn't specialize the pie the way the precise way they prefer it...If you want something specific... GO HOME AND COOK IT YOURSELF. When you come to a restaurant you are leaving your palette up to the choices of the chef preparing your food, and if you would just trust the guys in the back at Dozzinos, I promise, you won't be disappointed. SERIOUSLY JUST GO TRY THEIR PIZZAS, it's my favorite pizza place I've ever been to and my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. The pizza is a good combo of crunchy and doughy, the ingredients are bursting with flavor because they source their produce locally, the pesto crostinis always taste fresh, we always get two orders of those and the prosciutto. The fior di latte cheese is unique, creamy and salty with a little tang just the way mozzarella should be. My favorite pie is the Tomato, followed by the Diavola (you need to like it spicy for that one!) I've tried a few from their ""specialty menu"" but always return to my two favorites. I used to live around the block and frequented Dozzinos 1-2 times a month, so I've been there about a dozen times... So as for the naysayers: yes, their salad is always the same one, and their dessert usually stays the same for a few weeks... but I could care less because it's delicious every time. I think on one occasion they did skimp on the toppings, but it was towards the end of the night, and since I know the ingredients are always super fresh, sometimes that's a sacrifice a restaurant has to make in order to not have too much waste at the end of a day. Overall - DO NOT skip out on Dozzinos because of a few poor reviews. Go there with an open mind and experience it for yourself.",Dozzino,3.5 star rating,$$,Pizza

Perfectly salty and charred crust and simple toppings. The menu is written on a blackboard on the large wall in the main dining area. There aren't many options, which is the best part. You eat whatever is new on the menu that you didn't have last time. Many sources for produce, greens and meats are listed on the board as well. Love the dedication to staying local! It's BYOB so while you're waiting for your table you can lean on the large bar in front of the menu wall and open up your bottle of wine and watch all the steaming hot plates of pizza leaving the kitchen window and being carried to hungry customers. The Ambiance is simple (love the pipes for table legs) but it does get a bit loud on the weekend.

First, the wait was long so we asked if we could order the pizza for pick-up, and were told no because they didn't have room in the ovens. I've never heard of that before, but ok. Next attempt- we get there at 8:50 pm on a Saturday and they tell us they're closing and already turned the ovens off. Closing at 9pm on a Saturday night? We leave along with three other equally surprised groups of people. We tried one last time on a saturday night, and they told us it would be 10 mins. We wait for 20 mins outside before they come and get us, and offer us a place at the bar. Im coming out to have a nice dinner w my boyfriend - not sit at a cramped bar. We let them politely know we'd prefer a table and he tells us it will be 15 or so more minutes. We wait a bit longer, and finally give up.

The minimal decor makes for a great, cozy atmosphere, fit for families, friends, and couples. Ingredients are always fresh, and pizzas are made at the time of each order (which can sometimes cause slow service, but better than cold pizza!)Only a few negatives: Because everything is fresh (a plus), Dozzino often runs out of ingredients before the end of the evening, limiting what is available on their menu. Only other complaint is the size of the crostini. When Dozzino first opened, their crostini was what I would consider a normal size (picture a 1in thick slice of Italian bread). However, since then they are now bite sized pieces, about the size of a quarter. Also would love to have a private party here, but last I checked (right after they opened) the cost to rent  the back space was very high (higher than any other place I called in Hoboken), and didn't include any food in the fee.",Dozzino,3.5 star rating,$$,Pizza

Very creative flavors with their meats and cheeses. As far as neapolitan characteristics, they are a bit lenient to please American expectations without jeopardizing the Neapolitan style. The center of their pizzas are not extremely wet. You can definitely pick up a slice. The crust has a flavorful char that shows you the benefits of their wood burning oven. Not one bite was bland, spicy meant spicy and their sauce wasn't just for color.I hosted a party there in February. Marc and his crew were hospitable and made sure everyone had a great time. The space itself is great. There's an ebb and flow to the raw space theme. There's plenty of seating and a great outdoor space.Bottom line, every Neapolitan style joint I've been to since, I've compared to Dozzino.Can't wait to go back.TIP: Check their Tumblr and Twitter to make sure they're not hosting a private event.

I would give Dozzino a better rating if I wasn't so miffed by the fact that they seem to be closed all the time for a private party. My husband and I ate at Dozzino in April and we loved the pizza. We tried and order of crostini with bruschetta, a daily salad and the spicy, pizza Diavola. While everything was good, the pizza was great. The quality of the ingredients really shines here. The dough was tasty, chewy, crispy and charred just enough to make you want to eat another pie.A lot of Yelpers are complaining about the fact that they run out of dough, that they don't offer choose-your-own toppings and whatever else they expect from a Hoboken pizzeria; but you really have to leave certain expectations at the door. This is not a pizzeria like Benny's or Mario's, it's a restaurant that sells artisanal pies. Why on earth Dozzino doesn't want our money, I can't say. All I know, is that every time my family has walked past the restaurant (usually on the weekends) - there's a sign on the door saying ""Closed for Private Party"" - when we look inside, the entire front room is empty except for a handful of the wait staff just sitting around. It's hard to recommend this place to anyone when they seem to be closed so much.

177,dZP-zilhPyWzFfGZkVjDDg,Anthony A.,5.0 star rating,"I have to say this place is putting out pizzas that are as fine as anything that can be found in the Garden State and rival some of the best that NY has to offer. The pies definitely pay homage to Naples, but they clearly do not adhere to all the VPN dogma. They are using a wood burning oven with a gas assist and they appear to be getting a slightly longer bake on their pies which prevents an over abundance of moisture from pooling at the center. Thus the pizza can be eaten with your hands and are not a fork and knife affairs like Vera Pizza Napoletana. The cornice on the pie is puffy and pliant and has the irregular crumb of artisan bread. The toppings are super fresh and are applied with a deft hand. In fact they remind me of Roberta's in NYC in terms of their understanding of ingredients. Some of the combo's defy convention but always coalesce nicely on the finished product.Also, I recommend splurging and ordering at least one pizza off the Riserva Menu. AlI pizzas are $18.00, but they use Premium ingredients and the pizza's are larger that the pies on the house menu. I had the ""Johnny Bismarck"" which is Fior di Latte, Tomato, Prosciutto and a Runny Egg. Outstanding. Their salumi is sourced through Salumeria Biellese which in my opinion makes the best Charcuterie in the country.In general ownership has cultivated an experience that is slightly iconoclastic and built a place that reflects solely their predilections, from the music played, to the Pop Up Ramen dinners, and the Bocce Ball court that they have out back. They do not have an inferiority complex. If you want to come and hang out for a while and enjoy some good food you are more than welcome. If you don't like it then don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out. Thus the service while respectful can be a little aloof. No one will be kissing your ass at Dozzino. If you expect a debt of appreciation for your patronage I suggest that you save yourself some trouble and look up a Danny Meyer restaurant in NYC and skip Pizza for the evening.

If you don't get that this is a competitor for the best in the Mid-Atlantic, then you just don't like pizza so much. You might like something that calls itself pizza and it might be excellent to you, but it's not great as what is classically knows as a ""pizza."" And maybe the greeks invented pizza but that's not the standard by which pizza's are judged. C'mon, there has to be a standard loudmouths. Their ingredients are the best, the cheese is made locally (not even locally but specifically for them) slash in-house and not out of ordinary components available to anyone as is the case with so many ""local"" cheeses, but locally out of locally made cheese stuff (I may have some inside info though), I can't divulge much more lest they're outdone  and they deserve not to be outdone through a mere academic stacking of components, though I doubt it's possible. If you don't think this pizza is good, you don't understand what makes a good pizza and there are connoisseurs of everything so don't be such a jerk. You should probably go get some ray's or famous ray's or sbarro or some of that $.99 pizza, because if you dig it, then it's good to you and it's great that you like crap. Your life must be like an easy driving boulevard inhibited by only green lights. God I wish I was you. I mean that: life must seem great all the time. And no, really, $10 for a 12 inch pizza full of excellent ingredients and craft from the ground up ain't bad...it's better than 'ain't bad,' it's a bargain. Just eat here, and let yourself understand it's some of the best pizza you'll ever have outside of Naples...probably in the top 5 you'll get stateside, but not really outdone. Maybe the best because the cheese is THE BEST. And the sauce is San Marzano tomato and you'll know the difference if you care and you know, that too might be THE BEST, it's made of San Marzano tomatoes, they're the best and Dozzinos uses them as well as is possible...probably better than 'as well.' If you like the sugar-sweetened, oregano variety sauce with a sheet of translucent cheese over the top of it, then this is not your thing, and that's cool.Some people say it's the water that makes pizza great, well I ever heard from a reliable source the water they use in the dough (just the dough, not the table water) is imported from Naples. Why not? Did you take the Pulaski Skyway to Hoboken? Wouldn't you rather have water from the motherland?Do you need me to show my credentials? If you do, you're a fool.

Sadly, Dozzino just doesn't quite measure up. Not yet.My wife, daughter and I stopped by around 6pm on Saturday night. One advantage of having a toddler is that it gives you an excuse to eat dinner early, thus avoiding the crowds. Even still, the small space was about 75% full when we arrived. We were seated at a small table in the back.Our waitress was great. 5 stars for the service - quick service, recommendations, and all the attentiveness you could ask for when you're dining with a 15 month old who is capable of making a ruckus at any given second.The space itself is nice. Dimly lit, with a front and back room. There have been complaints about the 2 TVs, but they are both muted and can be avoided. Nice wooden benches and tables.We started with the bruschetta crostini. Quality ingredients and a pretty good serving size. So far, pretty good.Next came the pizzas. Let's start with the good - both pizzas came out quickly (15 minutes after our order) and for 'personal pizzas' were impressive in size.  We ordered the Tomato (sweet cherry tomato, mozz, basil) and the Diavola (spicy salami/spicy sauce). Now for the not so good.. the pizza was by no means 'bad', but I can't say it was great. The tomato pie did have a nice sweet taste from the tomatoes, but the cheese seemed kinda of.. bland, and the pie was lacking in basil.  The diavola pie was spicy it seems for the sake of being spicy. I'm a fan of spicy food, but there wasn't much flavor other than the  'I just finished my beer and need a drink!' after taking a bite. All in all, I'm willing to give Dozzino another try (or two).

First off, it's a BYOB place which is always a great thing. Go to the liquor store next door because they have a great selection of craft beers and old college favorties. They even had Lion's Head which is one of the best extremely inexpensive brews which is hard to find around here.The staff is very friendly and make you feel welcome when you walk in. My only complaint is that the service is a bit slow during peak hours. You can find yourself waiting 15 mins to get a check but considering how good the food is I can overlook that. Be sure to get the meat plate to start, and if you have group try all the different pizzas. I usually go with a total of 4 people and we get 4 pizzas which fills us up. The white pizza, the diablo, and any of their pizzas with cured meats are wonderful.Save room for desert which is a moscapone mixed with Nutella on crustini. It's light and a great end to the meal.Finally, when the weather is great go out back and play Bocce Ball.",Dozzino,3.5 star rating,$$,Pizza

(by the way, they let you know up front if a certain menu item is unavailable for the day if they aren't satisfied with the quality of the offerings in the market. LOVE THAT and wish more hoboken restaurants would follow suit.) i do think the pizza is a tiny bit bland, but delicious goodness nonetheless. finished the meal with some sort of chocolate topped crostini with crushed mint milanos - perfect.

We waited for 30-40 minutes and when the host came over to us, he said he had good news and bad news. The good news was our table was ready, that bad news was that they only have enough dough left for 2 pizzas. This pizza place is a disgrace for running out of pizza on a Friday night at 9:30.I decided to give it one more try. I went on a Sunday night and sat in the back room. The service was very slow. We were told they didn't have any pizzas with meat on it (which is about half the menu) so that immediately threw off our order. We ended up ordering a poor excuse for bruschetta; basically it was chopped tomatoes on stale bread. Then we got the ""la pizza"" which was extremely burnt on the crust making it nearly inedible.

Maybe...but at least take a couple bucks off for the cheese that I didn't eat.

They do no work around for people who have food allergies. So, someone in our party who has a lactose allergy couldn't eat any of their pizzas and aks for it to have no cheese, unless the pizza already said it had no cheese. They wouldn't even put some extra ingredients on the dry pizza she got, even though she would pay extra for it, because it wasn't part of the what was presented on the menu. For example, since she was basically getting bread, she asked if they could put tomatoes on it. They said no. The waiter said they weren't allowed... ?2. Several people ordered spinach and artichoke pizza. Two of the three got no artichokes on their pizzas. That is, pizzas arrive, they had spinach on top, but no artichoke at all. They called the waiter to see of they could put some artichokes on the supposed spinach and artichoke pizza. He said no. Not allowed. They called the owner/manager. He said that he couldn't do anything about the lack of artichokes because he makes the mix in the morning, and when the mix is placed atop the pizzas... sometimes you get artichokes... and sometimes you don't.... Feel free to burst out laughing now. This should then be named the ""spinach pizza, where if you are lucky, you may experience some tiny artichoke bits"". We expressed our feelings about this, namely, that it was ridiculous. He then proceeded to get agitated, talking about how he has a ""vision"" and that we didn't understand his vision.

That's what made me decide to have a group event there. While the pizza is tasty I would definitely not recommend having a group event there.I was told several times that they were waiving the room rental fee for my group. I don't know of any other Hoboken restaurant that charges a room rental fee, but ok thanks. I pre-ordered salad and pizza at noon for a 7pm event based on 22 people, but said it might be a little more or a little less. When we arrived at 7 I asked for ice to put some beer and wine in and was told they don't provide that I would have to go to the liquor store next door and purchase my own. Ok did that. No food was ready until 7:30 at which point 2 salads came out and about 10 plates for 20 people. I was told the other plates were being washed. I had ordered 8 salads so naturally expected more than 2 to arrive, but after they were eaten and I asked when more would be coming they informed me that they had put 4 salads on each of the 2 plates. I explained it was not nearly enough and asked for a little more which they brought for another $28. BTW the $28 per plate salads consisted of mesclun greens, a few green grapes, a few sliced almonds and lemon vinaigrette. Finally around 8 (an hour after the event began) we had enough plates, forks and food for everyone. I will say the pizza and salad were good, but not worth the hassle of having an event here.  Originally the owner had agreed to come back and talk to our group about the place, but that never happened. I was told a total which was more than I expected and more than I had the cash to cover so I handed over my credit card. Later they came by with free dessert because they had overcharged me on a few pizzas. Not as a thank you for my business, but sorry we screwed up ok thanks the dessert was tasty. I did not receive a receipt as the bill was on an ipad I so I asked for one. They said they could email it the next day and then agreed to email it on the spot, but acted majorly inconvenienced by my request for a receipt for a $300 dinner.  So anyway I look at the receipt today and there is a $8.50 credit card fee OMG I have never had a restaurant charge me a fee for using a credit card!!

It's not that big of a place (maybe that's why?), but the staff seemed flustered and were constantly apologizing.  I don't care if you've run out of glasses, but seriously, if this is the first time it has happened (and it probably isn't), then buy more glasses for next time or improve your dish washing process--don't offer customers Styrofoam cups.   Seems like there are some serious management issues here that need to be resolved.",Dozzino,3.5 star rating,$$,Pizza

232,1m-85zQGHmLsDLgP0aCYIA,Brian D.,1.0 star rating,"I really enjoy dining out, so it takes a lot to get me angry about a food experience.  However, Dozzino succeeded in doing just that.I showed up on a Friday night in a group of 4.  Upon being seated, we were promptly informed by the waitress that the place had no tomatoes and that she was the only one working the entire restaurant, so she was very busy.  This was not a huge problem for me, as I could do without the tomatoes, and I was not in a rush.  Strike 1, though, for being understaffed and being a pizza place with no tomatoes (come on...).We ordered what pretty much amounted to a random appetizer, since we couldn't get bruschetta with no tomatoes, and 4 of the plain pizzas to keep it simple.  The waitress returned with a plate of little bread pieces with meat on them and a plate of little bread pieces with some green vegetable on them (pesto and garlic maybe? it was hard to tell.)  After we started picking on the appetizer, the waitress returned and told us that she delivered the vegetable one by accident.  She also told us that since we knew we didn't order it and ate it anyway, we would be charged for it.  We essentially told her that we were not happy about it and we would indeed pay for it, but we did not appreciate her accusing us of knowingly trying to get a free appetizer.  Most Italian restaurants bring you bread before a meal, and we thought that was all this was.  Regardless, she continually came back to the table all flustered and kept bringing it up, even though we were done with this issue, and then she ultimately took the appetizer off the bill.  In the end, no harm no foul, but Strike 2 for the completely bizarre situation.Shortly thereafter, the hostess came by and finally offered us water.  It was explained that since the restaurant was new, they did not order enough glasses for the place and they needed to constantly wash glasses.  She brought over water in a nice looking bottle, so when she asked if we wanted any, I asked, ""It is free, right?""  Admittedly, this comment was half joking to ease the tension from before and half serious to make sure it was indeed tap water and not some fancy bottled water.  Apparently, this was grounds for the hostess to just blow up at me.  She lectured me about how rude I was and how I have obviously never worked in the service industry before (um...I certainly have...) because it sucks to be treated this way.  I apologized to her, although in hindsight, I don't know why.  She was the one that was doing a poor job and demeaning me, the customer.  So that's Strike 3.In the end, it made for a pretty funny story, so that's why I figured I'd share.  I don't go out for the stories, though.  In the end, the service at this place is obviously terrible.  The pizza was below average and a little bland (although I will say the other 3 members of my party liked it).  The highlight of the meal was the disputed appetizer.  That was actually pretty tasty.  The only other good thing here is that it was a BYOB.  Despite everyone apparently ""rooting for this place to succeed"", there are just too many better restaurants in Hoboken than to waste your time here.  If you want BYOB pizza, you are better off picking up a bottle of wine and ordering delivery from somewhere else.",Dozzino,3.5 star rating,$$,Pizza

234,CXo9ZpObIkOkK2hMANeHPg,Julie G.,2.0 star rating,"We walked into Dozzinos, psyched to finally try it out after months of driving by while circling for parking spots in the neighborhood. I immediately noticed the beautiful, modern interior, and was charmed by the simple wooden tables, mason jar glasses and chalk-scribbled menu hanging above the bar. But as soon as we were greeted by a waitress and ushered to our seats, it hit us: the Christmas music. Totally a miss for a place like this, that is trying to be modern and cool and cozy. This wasn't even Frank Sinatra sings Christmas into his third martini- this was like, the soundtrack to the original Broadway cast recording of Auntie Mame. Ew. We ordered the Spesto Crostini, with baby spinach, walnuts and pecorino. This was a very small plate, but for $6 I guess we shouldn't have expected much more. The taste was refreshing and bright, but the texture was off- the spinach was stringy and the whole bite was a little too oily. Then, we shared the tomato pizza, which was completely flavorless- think bland mozzarella and steamed grape tomatoes with no salt or even a hint of garlic.From the start of the meal to the finish, we were in the restaurant for about 20 minutes. We had talked about ordering more food if we were still hungry, but due to the obnoxious  Christmas music and the general mediocrity of the fare, we decided to just  get the hell out of there.We ended up grabbing a slice of Sicilian from Delfino's to go on our way home, just to satiate the pizza craving that had brought us to Dozzinos in the first place. And for the record, Delfino's happens to be decked out with festive lights, ornaments, tinsel, and a full-on manger scene for the holidays, but they WERE NOT playing Jingle Bell Rock.",Dozzino,3.5 star rating,$$,Pizza

249,E8OwOiJOBZRHtwsGsMFZQw,Andy F.,4.0 star rating,"Dozzino is one of my favorite local meals - although it didn't start out that way.  Their ingredients are made daily with the use of some local produce and specialty imports(from Italy). This freshness shows as every bite is flavorful - whether its one of their plain or specialty pizzas, crostinis or caprese appetizers, the meat plate, or even a nutella based dessert - its all done with a fresh, flavorful and original mindset involved. The one caveat with the freshness is that it is very well possible they will run out of dough, tomatoes (grape particularly), and other ingredients. I've been a frequent customer here since they opened less than 2 years ago and been told they are out of dough on two separate occasions(out of at least 20+ meals). At first I was appalled - a pizza place that ran out of dough! Isn't this a capitalist society, don't they want to make money? Somewhere along my thought process I grew to respect what they at Dozzinos were doing and more importantly I found myself craving the pizza. It is a favorite spot for a relatively inexpensive meal with my girlfriend or a larger group.  Ive been a part of groups from 4-12 and Dozzino has always been hospitable. It is BYOB so be sure to pick up wine or some beers beforehand. I'd recommend going with 3-5 good friends and eating family style - each ordering a different pie (apps/dessert too) and sharing.

The wait staff was incompetent and it was a complete disaster.  Even worse was the food; what little they made was gross and inedible  - the pasta with roasted tomatoes was not freshly prepared and instead tasted like Ragu from a store bought sauce.  We were so embarrassed with how Dozzino handled our party.  Many guests left early because there was no food and it was such an embarrassment.  Living in Hoboken as a local for many years, it is shocking to me how such a place still can be in business.
