We did come within 30 min of kitchen close, so maybe that is why things were super efficient, but I think our waiter(s) was still very attentive and our glasses were always full (of water!)Decor- Cozy, romantic, upscale type atmosphere. I noticed that I kept glancing over towards the bar area, which is dimly lit and decorated beautifully.Food- Food is on point. Tried the spinach as well as the beef empanadas, which were both delicious, and I believe baked, not fried (huge plus in my book). The cilantro dipping sauce has a kick to it. Also tried the short rib main course, because they were sold out of the steak (womp womp, but proves this place must make really good steak). Short rib fell right off the bone, and was flavorful. I like this place! Will definitely come back",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

Came here on a Thursday night and was pleasantly surprised by the indoor decor; however, there were only a handful of other people there. I personally prefer a more lively scene, but I hear on the weekends it's packed. Standouts were:Spinach and cheese empanadas, the appetizer bread/sauce, and the calamari.

The balinhos de bacalhau, cod fritters, was lightly crispy with a very flavorful and soft interior. Arepas de choclo, corn cake with salmon roe, was also very impressive. It was light yet packed with flavors, and the sauce is sooo good. The ceviche de camarones de Jipijapa, shrimp ceviche in a tangy and slightly spicy tomato cold broth, was unique; I loved the sweetness of the plantain chips balanced out with the citrusy spice from the ceviche. Our main dish was the encocado de Mariscos, seafood in coconut curry, was different from any other types of curries I've ever had. A must try!

The croquetas de pollo had a dense pack of chicken filling with the crunchy breading making for yet another delightful texture. The panca pepper sauce gave it a smoky and creamy flavor. Pata de Chancho al Estilo was super tender with the skin adding good texture. The rice had good flavor but the beans were a bit dull; tasting like typical beans. The small salad was very refreshing and the cubes of cheese made it delicious.Service - 3/5. The lady who refilled our water and brought more pita was very friendly. The server was a bit aloof and I find it distasteful when you ask a server for recommendations and they reply by suggesting the highest priced items with no real explanation. ""I recommend this because it is good"" isn't a very convincing sell, especially if it seems obviously blunt you're trying to raise the check average.Value - 4/5. The prices are pretty high with most entrees being around the upper $20s to $30s. The food is good and the experience is nice but not amazing enough to give top notches for; also the portion is on the smaller side. People talk about how the prices are fitting for the area but I think higher priced areas also mean higher competition and for that a few points in value are lost.Parking - Street (Free)",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"
11,mCVKhJzonBGiLkTHVQGdRw,Heather L.,5.0 star rating,"After all the accolades and rave reviews, my friend and I finally checked this place out on a rainy Friday night. This place is very, very small so I get why there is often a wait for a table. We got there early enough to snag in a table in the back. It's a very warm, cozy environment with a wood burning stove heating up the room and brightly painted walls. I tried one of the rum/cinnamon cocktails ($12) to start. It was delicious but perhaps to rich for me to finish. My friend and I split a bunch of tapas after some amazing baked bread and butter. We asked for some recommendations from our waiter as the menu has alot of options. Each dish we tried had incredible flavor but with ingredients that you would not think go together. The dishes were fairly small and are a bit pricey so keep that in mind.We first got the Empanadas which come 2 pieces to an order.  We did 2 orders - 1 of the spinach/bacon ($9) and another of the beef ($9). Both were delicious with amazing flavor, soft flakey crust,  and soft cheese. We then tried the chorizo ($11) which was okay but not the same amazing flavor as the empanadas. We then tried the Pimientos de Piquillo Rellenos de Calabaza y Queso Manchego($12). The dish is incredibly tiny but the flavor is bold and you will savor each bite. The peppers are filled with manchego cheese and Caribbean pumpkin. The cheese/pumpkin/pepper combination is suprisngly perfect.  We also tried the arepas ($11) and a tamales - one of squash and the other chicken (each $10). Delicious and inventive flavor combinations though the veggie tamale was better than the chicken. My friend ordered the dulce de leche ice cream ($8) for desert but I was too stuffedThe flavor profiles of the majority of the dishes were inventive, original, and delicious. You have to be a somewhat adventurous eater as reading the menu, the flavors don't seem like they would go together.  There is a prix fix menu Monday-Friday between 5-6pm which is next on my list to try.

Turns out that its a homemade sweet butter where you are forced to ask the waiter/waitress about what its made of because you just cannot identify it. Couple this bread and any of their expertly crafted libations and youre off to a real hot start.Appetizer menu is extremely robust offering up a wide array of small plates to nosh on. Cucharamama does and unbelievable job of turning the simplest of dishes into an excursion of tastes that can change at the drop of a hat. My favorite appetizer is the Pulpo al Olivo. Perfectly grilled octopus sitting in olive oil and a delectable panca pepper sauce. If you still have room after the 100s of appetizers that you end up ordering you move onto the entree section of the menu. Massive plates of all kinds of South American fare that will wow the eye and the pallet. I still havent had the foresight to order the Lechoncito Tierno Asado which requires a 5 day call ahead and cooked to order but with god as my witness i will make it happen.All in all this place is a foodies dream and is a must for any food lovers. Just be ready to trust the chef and enjoy the ride.,Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

We came yesterday (August 22,2017. At night)The hostess was the highlight of the night. Very nice, accommodating with a great smile. She sat us right away. Then the lady busser gave us water and the menus.We were seated next to these obnoxious people that won't shut up and all they talked About was how much money they had. 15 mins passed and no sign of the server. He was too busy just catering for the annoying table next to us. My guess is.. he was so attentive with them because their tab was high : Bottle of wine and countless appetizers. To even bother check in on us. He wasn't even that busy. He had 4 tables including us. Granted, he was making his own drinks. But still..We finally told a busser that we were ready to order everything. Since we were waiting for so long...Server finally comes to us. And gets a little attitude when we ordered everything at once, he wasn't expecting it. But we were there for so long we already knew the menu.We started with the Chicharron de pollo and 2 Caipirinhas. They were good and strong.Then we all ordered the Churrasco.And wow.. what a waste of 30 dollars. I ordered mine Medium. And it was literally rubber. It was a big portion and I didn't even ate half of it. I would've been more tolerable if I had more chimichurri to coat the steak.. but again, no sign of the server. He was too busy with the table next to us.My advice is:Treat all of your tables the same way. Do not neglect a table just bc they're not ordering half the menu. Our tab in Total was $145 that should've been a decent tip. But instead we tipped the Lady busser who was the only one that smiled at us and helped us(Besides the hostess) But will never returned here.",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

46,P0Gq6psimW2sqx2UDUYE-w,Will V.,4.0 star rating,"3.5 stars for nice atmosphere, a good date spot it would seem (we were here on a sleepy summer Sunday afternoon), and decent, if overpriced, food for portion size. Classy, romantic, art filled dining room. Friendly but forgetful and not especially attentive service (even when we were only one of three occupied tables in the place). The sangria was tasty, fruit filled, and not overly sweet, aka a winner. Appetizers, including the shrimp ceviche, cod fritters, and bao bun with pork (I think) were tasty. The real winner was the tamal with juicy duck meat generously stacked on top: yum. Dinner entrees were less impressive and not unpricy at the mid- to high-$20s. The churrasco steak was on the tough side and not the most flavorful. Our table ordered two, the first, prepared to medium, arrived with other entrees; the other, prepared well done, arrived once everyone was almost done eating. Umm, okay. This was an expensive lunch for four, generally decent, but perhaps overpriced and overly precious for what actually arrived on the table.",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

My only issue was the duck wasn't very warm. It seems like the duck was finished before the steak and sat. Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable in explaining the food and the drinks. I would definitely go back because the flavors and combinations of sweet and savory were perfect.

50,Vd-28qnnrVRAMOM3GDQwmQ,Shanece D.,2.0 star rating,My friends and I visited this eatery for the first time today. We were super exited and thrilled to try some yummy food and drinks.Unfortunately the wood oven was down. Huge bummer because we were looking forward to ordering some items made from the oven. That left us sitting there looking over the menu for an extra fifteen minutes. I ordered the Shrimp in Pepper Sauce and the Corn Tamale. Both very good! My friends ordered the Salmon and the Skirt Steak. They were pleased with their chooses. I absolutely love a good drink! But very disappointed to find that they are NOT in fact a beer bar. They had 6 beers on the menu. Very misleading. I thought to myself before going- wow a Latin American restaurant that isn't a tequila or rum bar. Super awesome! But in fact it is more so a tequila and rum bar. I'm not sure of the name of the drink I ordered but I wasn't very pleased. Not good one bit. My friends ordered  Mojitos and loved them.The biggest disappointments were the service and the fact that it was overwhelmingly hot in the restaurant!!!! Our waiter never came to our table without us waving him down! Not once. He didn't even come to ask us how our food was or if we needed another drink or water. I actually wanted to order a different drink and my friends wanted more mojitos but because our waiter never checked on us we never had the opportunity to order more drinks. Back to the place being extremely hot! I don't like sweating unless it's in the gym. And when I stood up to leave my legs were dripping with sweat. Ugh!!!If I ever visit again I would call in advance and ask two very important questions: if both the wood oven and AC are working.,Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

We made reservations for a birthday with the owner but she never made it. So we show up to feel embarrassed and wait outside in the cold for about two hours. They compensated five sangrias when we don't even drink. We get seated and a busboy drops water all over our table and the gentlemen next to us. The food came out cold and our medium done steak came out basically raw. You would think they would take out the automatic tip but of course not that would be too much. It isn't about the money since our bill was 500$ it's the principal.

Our favorite was the peppers stuffed with pumpkin and cheese, our least was the fish fritters (and I love me a fish fritter puff) but this was EXTREMELY salty. It came with three and my boyfriend and i each had one and left the third alone. The buns was also a little disappointing for me but my boyfriend enjoyed it. We LOVE bao buns and eat them often but I wasn't that impressed and at $9 a bun I feel it should be amazing. The duck tamale was extremely yummy and packed with flavor! Chicken croquettes also good. We ended the night with chocolate flan and it was compliments from the kitchen which was extremely sweet and a lovely way to end the night. They also offered us coffee. The staff here is great!

So i've been back twice in the last 6-8 months, and they have redeemed themselves a hundred times over. The food is certainly on point. Spinach & manchego cheese empanadas are certainly one of my favorites. The platano asado, duck tamal, and pizzas from their oven were all delicious. The one downside was the arepa the chocolo. The salmon roe is unnecessary, and for $11 it is ridiculously overpriced. The menu says arepaS, so i was expecting at least 2 of them. I asked my waiter and he said it is just one. The menu is a little misleading with this one, so be careful. With that being said, i am certain i will be back for more delicious food. And so should YOU. ENJOY!!!",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

88,x4wUge5_bWM5ShHibHyPhw,Jason C.,3.0 star rating,"In Hoboken NJ lies a restaurant whose chef won the 2012 James Beard Award for the Best-Mid Atlantic Chef and has gotten a food rating as high as 27/30 on Zagat.  The recipient is a chef named Maricel Presilla and this is her flagship Peruvian restaurant.  And for the folks who may be interested, she smashed several DC finalists for the award:Cathal Armstrong, Restaurant Eve, Alexandria, Va.Johnny Monis, Komi, Washington, D.C.Peter Pastan, Obelisk, Washington, D.C.Vikram Sunderam, Rasika, Washington, D.C. Ouch.  So Maricel killed several of DC's finest.  I saw that list and I HAD to see what this place had to offer.  I was willing to put my DMV pride at stake for being the first elite in the DMV area to review this place...so here goes.Decor:  The focus of this restaurant is on the wood-burning oven that is in front of the bar area.  This wood oven is shaped like a semicircular Italian wood burning oven used to prepare Pizzas.  I admit this is something that you don't see often in restaurants and it is quite romantic.  There is a slew of appetizers and food you can order from the menu that is prepared in the oven...and obviously I did so.Appetizers: From the wood burning oven we ordered-Empanadas de Carne (Beef Empanadas)-the empanada was thick and had a trace of a slightly burnt exterior from the wood oven.  Unfortunately, the small amounts of beef combined with a very thick crust made it difficult to enjoy the right proportions of meat that would have made the dish tastier. (3*).Camarones Tatacuá, Salsa de Ají Panca (Shrimp in Panca Pepper Sauce)- contrary to what I expected, the shrimp was bland.  I could not taste much of the pepper and it was not spicy (2.5*).Main Dish:Argentinean-Style Skirt Steak with Chimichurri (2*) - this is supposed to be the #1 main dish in the restaurant. The skirt steak was of a low quality meat and extremely tough.  In addition, the marinade was only present on the top surface of the meat.  Once you bit into the meat, it was completely flavorless from the center of the meat and onwards.I recommended this dish to a party who sat adjacent to us.  After finishing the meal, I noticed that the dish was untouched after a bite.  I'm certain they shared the same sentiment with us.Peruvian-Style Roast Leg of Pork in Ají Amarillo Adobo, White Rice and Stewed Canary Beans -(3.5*).  It was a decent pork dish that was moderately tender and shredded similar to pulled pork dishes found in bbq restaurants.  It terms of the flavoring or spices there was nothing special about this dish but the taste was acceptable.Dessert:Millefeuille with dulce de leche and walnut between the pastry layers covered in a Malbec meringue -(5*).  This dessert is an absolute knockout.  The meringue is covered with a very light cream that has a taste and texture similar to marshmallow.  The bottom layer had a crunchy pie and the cream/pie combination with a hint of walnut made this one of the most outstanding dessert dishes that I ate on the east coast.I would compare this dessert dish and put it on par with:1) Brian Voltaggio's dessert dishes at Table 21 in VOLT2) Capogiro Gelato (philadelphia, PA)3) La Sierene's Iles Flotantes, Crème Anglaise et Caramel aux Amandes in NYCI was incredibly tempted to raise the overall yelp ratings for this restaurant to a 4* just because of this one dessert dish.  That's how good it is.If I were to make a recommendation, I would go to the bar, grab an appetizer or two from the wood fired oven (things I did not try), order a Pisco Sour, and...of course the Millefeuille.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.As for this restaurant knocking off Restaurant Eve, Rasika, Komi, and Obelisk? I share the same sentiment as Cathal Armstrong's wife:twitter.com/restaurant_e…I still take pride in my DC restaurants!",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

We ordered appetizers with the drinks since we saw it was a little busy and did not want to wait longer. I was aware that it was crowded but realized that two other tables around me were approached constantly asking if everything was ok. We then had to call the waiters attention AGAIN to order our entrees. He never told us specials for the day like he did to the surrounding tables. After the food was served, he never asked us how everything was going. The service for our table was terrible! We felt completely neglected and ignored.

Let me put it into context, I wouldn't come back here based on the food, none of the 5 entrees we had were of any consideration we simply did not enjoy them.

Getting a reservation has proved to be pretty difficult but we just happened to luck out (we called the same night, only a few hours prior). It makes sense though, as the place was packed (not an empty table available).The decor is great and pretty authentic. We sat right in front of the wood burning over so we got a little extra heat (which was very welcomed given that it was a chilly night). The staff was friendly and attentive, returning to take our order and/or deliver food/drinks promptly. Our water glasses were always being refilled as well.The food was the really high point. It was all delicious! Starting w/ mojitos, the bread and warm butter and the Calamari we knew we were in for a treat. The Calamari... ""Jalea de Calamares con Ají de Rocoto""...probably the best we've had in a LONG time (the breading and the sauce was unique and very tasty). For dinner we had the Costillas de Res en Salsa de Asado Negro Venezolana conPapelón y Cacao, Quinoa y Acelga (braised short rib) and the Entraña (Churrasco) con Chimichurri Rojo y Papas Chorreadas con Hogo Bogotano (Argentinean-Style Skirt Steak) and both were EXCELLENT. We really could not stop eating even though we were completely stuffed (and therefore did not have dessert).This is one of our new favorite spots in Hoboken and definitely one of the best places in town.

I found this restaurant by Googling ""Best restaurants in New Jersey"" - Google lied. I was so excited to go here, the thought of consuming flavorful and spicy South American foods almost had me salivating (I like food, a lot)... until I actually had it here. I had the Argentinian skirt steak with chimichurri, white rice and black beans. the steak was so tasteless, even with the chimichurri, our server had to get me a side of sauce so I could finish it. The rice was packed with butter/oil, so much that I actually stopped to imagine my arteries getting clogged. My boyfriend had the Peruvian-style Roast Leg Of Pork - which he was not impressed with. He had to request hot sauce to use as a dip. It was the most expensive, boring and tasteless meal I've had in a long time. Seriously, Cucharamama, would you at least offer authentic South American food that is as spicy as it should be or give us the option to choose how spicy we would like our dishes. I feel like your restaurant is catering to the locals and conforming every authentic dish to meet those standards.

Their bar is lacking. They do make a great Margarita though (Mamarita). We split a few apps for the table which were good not great. Very small portions. We ordered:Chicharron de Pollo Novoandino otherwise known as chicken fingersChorizo Argentino aka sausage and peppersCamarones Tatacua- shrimpAnd 1 Beef and 1 Cheese & Onion empanadasAll were good the beef empanadas stood out the most. For my main dish I ordered the Saice or spicy braised beef with rice and beans. I enjoyed it. In my opinion that and my mamarita's were the best parts of my meal. Everyone else at the table ordered the Churrasco which was a huge portion of skirt steak. They all enjoyed. Overall it was a pleasant experience and the food was good but again it wasn't as great as I had heard. I was a little disappointed.

123,NWLqOKl0Vxi7qK-6EoBLbg,Brandon E.,4.0 star rating,"This is probably my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. I don't always eat here, but when I do I prefer Cucharamama. Anyway, this place is outstanding and off Washington street which at times is nice to get away from. This is South American cuisine with some influences obviously from America but also Italian among others. I've been here four times now, mostly because it's not the cheapest place to chow down. We save it for birthdays, anniversaries, etc. Each time I go the food has always been spectacular, I have eaten nothing here that I didn't like. This last time I got the braised short ribs in a red wine sauce. Great googlie mooglie. It was rich and heavy but man was it good. This was NOT light fare but wow the flavor was intense. I've also gotten the skirt steak, rib eye tried some chicken all good. The tamale's are outstanding no matter what you get, I suggest the one with duck on top. The little pizzas, delicious and a great starter. Seriously, I've tried a variety of their tapas style food as apps and it has always been a home run. The empenadas with bleu cheese in them, awesome. I've been for a couple birthdays now and they've brought out a desert with a candle in it each time, no fan fare or anything like a Chili's (thank god) but a nice gesture considering no one has asked them to do that. The booze, they have a variety of mixed drinks and concoctions inspired by South American spices, alcohol, mixology, etc. The punch, mojito, rum on the rocks is all excellent and ask them to give it a little kick and you won't be disappointed. Not a place to come and tie one on as the drinks run from $9-11. The only reason I give it four stars because a couple of times they had to really dig to find our reservation and that was kind of a pain. it's a solid 4.5 stars to be honest.If you live in Hoboken or are just visiting this needs to be a must try on your list.",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

Tonight was the 2nd time I've been here in 5 years. The reason they only get 2 stars instead of 3, is because for a place that's written up as the end-all-be-all of latin american cuisine, for a chef who's repeatedly touted as ""one of the best around"" they are held to a higher standard than your 'average' gastronomie. When the best part of the night is the bread and butter, you know there's better places. The ceviche was halfway decent but could have benefited from chunks of tilapia or any kind of fish instead of just 4 shrimp and a bunch of onions. the skirt steak was once again tough and fairly bland. even the chimichurri was flavorless and tasted mostly of oil so I didn't even bother with it. My girlfriend had the boneless chicken which was just okay. the best part of that was the sauce from the chicken should have been used on the steak. Oh, and according to her, I make a better mojito in our kitchen than they do.If you want great latin tapas-style food, venture across the river to the yuca bar on Ave A and 7 st. Try the salmon ceviche, the espresso ribs, the guacamole, and pretty much anything else.

I could tell we were supposed to b/c there were butter knives on little bread plates at our table.Starters: Empanadas were good, soup was ok, fried fish was ok.Main courses: THE BRAISED BEEF WAS TERRIBLE. One of the worst dishes I've ever had at any restaurant. If you're gonna serve me a really cheap cut of beef, that's fine as long as you cook it right. Properly braised beef should be tender, but this was so chewy and wouldn't break apart when I chewed it. I pretty much swallowed it whole. Awful. We also got the seafood in coconut milk broth, it was just ok. I'd rather get a curry from Satay for half the price and twice the flavor. Sides: Plantains. I love plantains in general, these weren't bad.Dessert: None. I was so fed up at this point, it took forever to get the dessert menu, then forever to get the waiter to come take our order, so I just had him bring the check.Like I mentioned, the service was really bad. I understand that there are cultural differences, and I expect that service can sometimes be a little slower when going to Latin/South American restaurants b/c they're a little more laid back. But this was just terrible. After being seated, it took us like 10-15 minutes before any server even acknowledged our presence, then another 5 just to get a tiny glass of water. Throughout the course of our meal, our waiter was much more interested in socializing with other people than tending to us. If I wanted something (place an order, get a menu, get water), I kept having to stop him as he was passing our table, b/c he sure wouldn't stop on his own to see if we actually needed/wanted anything. Or I'd ask someone else if he was nowhere in sight. He was nice enough to bring the check to us quickly. I guess b/c he figured it was tip time. I'm tired of people over-hyping Hoboken restaurants b/c they don't know what good food is.I came here excited, and left pissed off. There's just no excuse for that service and that braised beef.UPDATE:I went back here a year later. Service still sucked, but everything I ate was very good.

We're South American and didn't really find it authentic. Portion size was small and the tamale size was laughable. No sangria pitchers. And good luck trying to get water refills. It wasn't a busy night then either. Tables were very small and ambiance lacking. I didn't hear any music, just a lot of loud chatter.

First and foremost, the food is excellent. I have come multiple time and tried many of the appetizers (some personal favorites are the crispy calamari, the Peruvian ceviche, the blue cheese empanadas, and the croquettes), and all were delicious, well executed, and great for ordering multiples/sharing with the table. My go-to entree is the entrana (skirt steak) with chimichurri sauce. YUM! I have also had the braised short ribs, and have tried some of my boyfriends' mussels which were flavorful and perfectly cooked! All-in-all, a fantastic food experience.However, the service at our most recent dining experience definitely overshadowed, and nearly ruined our enjoyment of the food. I had called and made a 7:30 dinner reservation for 6 people on a Friday night. Knowing the small capacity of the establishment, I called and made a reservation 6 days prior. My party (of out-of-town guests on their first trip to Hoboken) arrived at 7:30 and checked in with the hostess. She acknowledged our arrival and checked my name off of the list on her reservation sheet and walked back into the restaurant to check on the status of our table. A minute or two later she came back and informed us that our table would be another 30 minutes because the previous table was lingering longer than expected, but she offered for us to sit outside instead. There were some ""cold-blooded"" women in our group who mentioned they would prefer to sit at our reserved table inside when it was ready. We asked if we could sit around one of the empty outdoor tables and order drinks/peruse the menu while we waited for our table to become available. She said ""absolutely!"" and so we had a seat.And we sat.And sat.And saaaaattttttt.....With not a single menu/waiter in sight. Finally one of our group went up to the hostess station and stole a drink menu for us to look through. Finally, a waiter came to take our drink order.At about 8:15, a member of our party walked up to the hostess table to inquire about the status of our table, to which he was told ""Only another 20-30 minutes, now"". We were seconds away from cutting our losses, leaving the restaurant, and finding something elsewhere. When I confronted the (16 year-old looking, clearly overwhelmed) hostess, I made it very clear that it is unacceptable to keep a group waiting for a reserved table well over an hour. I also asked her to ""take care"" of our group for the evening, as we had not been treated with the experience we were expecting when we made the reservation.After that confrontation, our table was mysteriously ready in minutes (hmmmmm, curious.....). From that point on our dining experience was much better. The manager sent over a PLETHORA of complimentary appetizers, all of which were delicious, but we had to wait a VERY long time to see a waiter & order appetizers. At one point everyone at our table had an empty drink and we had to wave the waiter over to order more.By the end of the evening (and a few drinks later), we had ALMOST forgotten about the start of our evening.

The fire stove inside did make it a bit warm in there, but not a deal breaker. As mentioned, I had the skirt steak and their mojito, both were delicious. I was there with a group of 4 and everybody seemed to agree that the food was stellar. But...At the end of the meal, when the check came, there was a dead cockroach squished in the little book with the bill. That was pretty disgusting. I mean, not enough for it to ruin my meal, but other people would have probably been furious. If you think there aren't cockroaches or other creatures roaming the kitchens of all our local restaurants, you're only fooling yourself. Had it been IN the food, another story. So, I'll give it 3 stars. Food is worth 5 stars, finding a cockroach when you open the bill subtracts two. I only refer to you as ""Cucaracha-mama"" these days.

The tapas were quite tasty, but next time I think we will skip tapas and just enjoy the bread and our entrees. We enjoyed the mussels with pork belly in a beer broth - I still dream of it. The only downfall was I wish we had more bread to soak up the leftover broth when the mussels and pork belly were gone. We also enjoyed the chicken made in the wood burning oven... if you've never had a chicken cooked this way, this is the place to have it. Absolutely juicy and delicious. Will we be back?

172,ZQPmYnUND7Fzf09QMaNVDQ,Lucienne D.,3.0 star rating,"Would have given this place a better rating had the service been better.(The strategy is to sit inside, close to the center, and speak Spanish, which puts you at a definite advantage.  Came here twice before with friends who were fluent in Spanish, and the dinner could not have gone more smoothly).A few servers do not speak English, but are all very friendly, and seem genuinely eager to provide a positive dining experience. Their kitchen is small, and the staff seems overwhelmed by trying to serve indoor and outdoor tables, as well.Winter dinners here feel far more cozy and organized. A reservation hostess called twice in two days to confirm the reservation. We arrived promptly, were seated quickly, and then waited 30 minutes just to have a server actually get to our table! A party of six came in 15 to 20 minutes after we were seated, and the server approached them in no time. That server caught my eye, as he realized that we had been sitting there a long time, and came over to us.   Needless to say, the party of six shot us more than one nasty glance. But, then, am getting used to the more recent transplants to Hoboken, as entitled, older, wealthy looking types with terrible manners, who just assume being aggressive gets you everything here. The food was more uneven than I had remembered from previous dinners here.Crispy calamari was great. Cheese stuffed peppers arrived barely warm. Chicken croquettes were a bit boring. The tamales are far more interesting than Mexican tamales, but not as good as the last time I had tried them. Ceviche, Peruvian style, was a warm, spicy dish of a few cooked shrimp, swimming  in a huge amount of onions and hot tomato sauce. Roasted leg of pork was reasonably good. Braised short ribs were sweet but very tender. The salmon was respectable, but bland. The hit of the night was the Pastele...a chicken and beef pot pie with some sort of cornmeal base, bursting with unusual flavors. Dessert, on the house, due to our long wait, consisted of baked pineapple compote and ice cream...really good! And then, we were treated to a brown sugar flan. The flan i would skip.  It tasted more like gelatin than any specific flavor I could identify. I would give this place another try, but probably on a week night.  Their other restaurant, Zafra, might be a better choice for a weekend, but it is BYOB..",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

Admittedly, the most adventurous thing we tried was the Duck Tamale,  but everything was PRETTY good. This wasn't even close to gourmet, but they seemed to try hard. (Like, the ""Chorizo Argentino con Pimientos y Cebolla"" is nothing more than a chorizo sausage cut in half with red peppers and onions with a $10 price tag slapped on there.)The service wasn't THAT great, which is why I docked a star. I had to prompt our waiter to talk us through the menu, prompt him for suggestions, ask him about serving sizes for the two of us. There was definite room for improvement there. The bus girl was a far better waitress than our waiter was. The prices were pretty steep for what you get- most small plates are around $10, and when they say small, they are SMALL.

I went to Cucharamama on Friday at 7 without a reservation and was seated immediately, but the table was right next to the only narrow walkway, so I felt a bit squished and in the way. We made the mistake of ordering the calamari because we were intimidated by the menu. Not that the calamari was bad--it was excellent--but we immediately regretted not choosing something more Peruvian. Unfortunately (perhaps because of a language barrier), our waiter wasn't overly helpful with suggestions. And worse, he had to stand in the narrow walkway while speaking to us, so we didn't want to hold him up. Both of us ended up wishing we had ordered something else. Luckily, we decided to split the plantain, which was a huge hit, as was the flavored bread and butter served before the meal.

194,XfnlCrfUp0JDhZl06LXGxQ,Sid N.,3.0 star rating,"Cucharamma is one of the best of the dinner spots I've gone to in Hoboken. Me and my dining partner shared 4 appetizers, an entree, a desert and several of their specialty drinks. Though we enjoyed the meal I'll have to lean on 3 stars for this one due to reasons that are provided below. The short rib entree ""Braised Short Ribs in a Red Wine Sauce and Brown Loaf Sugar and Cacao"" was spectacular.  Its an amazing hunk of tender meat, the largest short rib portion I have ever had, marinated in something that included chocolate, of course.  The dark chocolate seemed like a taste that should always be infused in a short rib.   The specialty cocktails we tried were also top notch.  The capirinha I had was just 'pretty good' but the very unique and elaborate drinks on the menu, which will stand out in their length of their names, will all surely delight, as the two we tried were very tasty. The small plates we had were a mixed bag.  We had plantain and yuca dishes that were alright and two shrimp dishes, where one succeeded and the other failed.  These are a bit pricey for tapas, which is what they are, since they seem to be just decent tapas.  We didn't finish most of those small plates but I didn't feel the usual guilt associated with leaving half an appetizer behind (and no desire to 'bag' them either).The ceviche small plate was definitely the sore point.   For one thing, one of the two ceviches listed was certainly not ceviche as it was made with roast pork.  The other did not feature fish and instead whole shrimp.  This wasn't ""ceviched"" in citrus as one would expect but instead in a tomato and onion mix. I am not a ceviche expert, but I have enjoyed it in Latin America, Miami and New York, enough to know what the dish should taste like.  Though I have enjoyed ceviche of varying quality, none resembled this dish.  It may be an authentic variety of ceviche, but if you are a Peruvian restaurant claiming to serve authentic food, you probably wouldn't serve this as your sole ceviche. Wouldn't a Turkish restaurant ensure to serve a decent kebab?  It also was subpar in taste.  You do expect cubed fish in a ceviche and much of appeal is in the unique texture of fish flesh prepared this way (with citrus).  The tomato base of this variety dominated all else.I reckon an experience at Cucharamma can turn out much better, but I can only reflect on my own.  They deal with an elaborate and extensive menu, which aims to capture all of South American national cuisines (with a Peruvian base?).  I was wondering what the fire oven cooked shrimp dish that everyone was ordering (we sat by the oven) was but failed to pick it out.  It would make sense for the management to stick to the best in their menu, do a better job with the menu text layout and presentation or have the waiter guide new visitors through the menu a bit better.",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

The spicy dip that comes with it will burn a hole in your digestive tract if you aren't careful. That said, the appies were great.Three of us had the skirt steak, and it was out of this world. I had the braised beef. I didn't realize it was more or less a stew, but even so, it was excellent. Tasty and super tender and perfectly spiced.Their white sangria, sold,by the glass, although ridiculously over priced, was excellent.

Tonight was an awful experience but I'm giving two stars based on A. Only ordering tapas and didn't try their entrees and B. The food was tasty (but nothing extraordinary for the price). The night was ruined the second I walked in. Although my husband and I (and toddler) had a reservation, the banter between the hostesses of where to put us 'lepers' that dare bring a youngster out after 7pm went on way too long, to the point where it was so uncomfortable I said 'I'm sorry is there a problem?' The meaner of the hostesses said 'sorry, we're overbooked' to which I replied, 'But I have a reservation?!' and she said 'But you called today'...Ok, so instead of taking my spontaneous yet responsible reservation for 2 adults and a baby, I should have been told then they were overbooked at the time of my call. Regardless, we were seated by the door and I was fine to not have to engage with that one witch anymore. The hostess continued to sit people at the bar, yet there were a ton of empty tables in the front of the restaurant. I'm not here to judge their reservation method, but those tables were not filled our entire time there. So on to the food...It was tasty enough, but $11 for a thomas's corn cake and other tapas in the same price range for barely any food, $74 later I came home hungry. I am not a stranger to small plates, and one of my favorite places in the city is Pipa in the Flatiron district, but this was not as special. in all fairness to them, the entrees would have probably been the way to go, as the skirt steak looked great, but thanks to the attitude of the hostess ,I will only stick to the sister restaurant which is BYOB as an added perk.",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

Camarones Tatacuá, Salsa de Ají Panca (Shrimp in Panca Pepper Sauce):  Super delicious shrimp topped with a tasty sauce, sitting on an indistinguishable bed of a delightful vegetable concoction. Chorizo Pizza:  The same flatbread mentioned earlier with thick medallions of chorizo and red peppers on top.  Meh.  I should've known better than to order ""Pizza"" in a South American restaurant.Fried Sweet Plantains:  Piping hot and prettily plated, they had a crunchy, caramelized exterior and a creamy, sweet interior.Guarapita de Aragua (Venezuelan Rum and Passion Fruit):  It was light and refreshing with a delicate fragrance of cinnamon.  It was a perfect balance of sweetness and flavor that complimented the night.Now, a side note about the service.  As I have already mentioned, this place is authentic to the core.  That being said, the service is of South American nature...servers have a laid back demeanor and dawdle around the restaurant rather than taking your order.  Every time I've been here we need to ask for our orders to be taken.  Just be aware that service is lax so you might need to be more aggressive than usual.However, Cucharamama is undoubtedly one of the best restaurants of Hoboken.",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

I'm originally from South America and am always hopeful I can find a great restaurant that serves great South American food! This is the place to go!The restaurant is small and dark, and has wood burning oven. The staff was very friendly and professional. Our waiter constantly checked up with us to see if everything was fine.  The restaurant is more expensive than other Latin American restaurants I've been to, but it wasn't a problem for me considering its great service and food.For drinks, I ordered the Chicapa (Pineapple chicha and Zacapa rum). It was delicious! It was hard to pick only some appetizers since everything on  the menu looked delicious. We picked the Chicharrón de Pollo Novoandino (Peruvian-Style Crunchy Quinoa-Crusted Chicken Fingers, Chino-Latino Sauce),  and the Camarones Tatacuá, Salsa de Ají Panca (Shrimp in Panca Pepper Sauce), to share. These were amazing! By the way, they also serve fresh bread from the wood oven, with a sweet butter (which happened to be the best butter I've ever tasted)! For our entrees, me and one friend ordered the Bandejita Paisa (Traditional Colombian dish consisting of  skirt Steak, Pork Cracklings, Colombian Sausage, Arepa, Rice and Red Beans, Ripe Plantains, and Colombian Hot Pique Sauce). My other two friends ordered the Churrasco (Argentinian style skirt steak) and the Salmon. My dish was cooked to perfection! I've had the bandejita paisia from other restaurants, but this by far was the best I've ever eaten!We finished off by ordering the chocolate flan. The flan was good, but not great.

This was one of the more disappointing experiences. We came in for a Sunday afternoon brunch. Before even ordering anything, we noticed at least a dozen flies quietly sitting on the wall next to our table. These were not your typical fat american flies. These were slightly smaller, maybe a Peruvian species or something. We weren't very hungry and decided to just get two appetizers and one main to share. The first of the appetizers was rice cheese croquettes which actually tasted good but were very small at only 3 bite-sized pieces. We also got the beef empanadas which were again tiny and a little burned. We had higher hopes for the arepas with caviar, but were let down again. We learned that arepas is actually a singular word and if you can imagine a spoon 4 times smaller than the teaspoon, that's how much caviar was provided. In the end $30 bought us about 8 ounces of mediocre food. Needless, to say we were still hungry and walked over to the Italian fare a few blocks up and got 2 gigantic arepas for $5 each that were so good they were worth way more than the whole meal at Chucharamama.This is one of those restaurants that is in business purely because of the gullibility of the Hoboken clientele.

We made reservations, but when we got there, it was empty, so we could have walked in. They have cute outdoor tables, but we opted to sit inside for the ambiance. The drink menu is extensive and filled with interesting aperitifs. My husband ordered an ""El Viejo"" Ti-Punch, which is aged rum on the rocks with a twist, vanilla and a cinnamon stick. It was delicious! I opted for a classic margarita -- that was good, as well. Most things on the menu look enticing. We ordered the Empanada de Espinaca, two spinach empanadas with manchego and bacon. These were amazing. They serve a pita type bread with spices and a sweet cream butter -- also wonderful! For our entrees we ordered the Pastel de Choclo Chileno, a Chilean beef and chicken potpie, with a corn crust and Costillas de Res con Costra de Papelón y Mostaza, Quinoa y Acelga Salteada, braised short ribs in red wine sauce with stir-fried quinoa and swiss chard. The potpie was very tasty, albeit a bit heavy. The ribs were tender and flavorful, although drenched in sauce. Next time, I would order the sauce on the side. The quinoa was a bit dry. We also ordered Patacones, golden fried green plantains, as a side dish. These were pretty good, though I've had better. All of the food was rather heavy, but we decided to taste some dessert anyway. We ordered a chocolate flan and a gigantic millefeuille, with dulce de leche and walnut between the pastry layers, covered in a Malbec meringue. When the desserts came out, we were shocked at how large the millefeuille was! The meringue was creamy and light and the layers were crispy and the fillings were very sweet. The flan was tiny in comparison! The flavor of the flan was great, but the texture wasn't as creamy as I prefer my flan to be. Overall, I would recommend Cucharamama for good South American cuisine. I also like that it stands out from the usual-type Hoboken restaurant fare. The service wasn't that great.

We were told it was busy. Well, ok they must have really good food so we went on a little walk to the bar and grabbed dessert for after dinner when we got home. At 9:10ish we went back. They sat a couple who had come in after us. They then told us we had the next table. I saw several people leave and the hostess call a couple that their table was ready. We were 4 th on the walk-in list from what i saw. This couple wasn't there before us. At 9:40 we said we were leaving and were very upset with their service. Magically at 9:46pm I got a call saying they had a table open- AFTER we'd made our complaint and left. 8:11-9:46= 1 hour and 35 minutes to wait while being miss lead 3 time about how long it would take to get a table.

228,4FWfKm5GFUWakfIWVAMPGQ,Scott G.,3.0 star rating,"Not impressed. Read some really good reviews but didn't get the same experience.  I think the poor review starts with the hair that was on our bread plate. Even at that, I was keeping an open mind.Things didn't improve with my app - Pulpo al Olivo, which is Octopus in a Peruvian Black Olive and Panca Pepper Sauce. Now I've had octopus countless times, typically fried, grilled or ceviche. I don't believe this octopus is prepared using any of those methods. The texture was very unusual. The outer layer of the octopus felt a bit fatty and the inner part was (too) soft all the way through the bite. Also, the sauce was like an olive cream sauce. Had to ask myself several times 'why did I order this? Perhaps it's my fault for being adventurous. I couldn't eat three bites. The only way I was able to eat a second bite was to pretend I was Andrew Zimmern, from Bizarre Foods. At $14, a total throw away. My wife's app was the Llapingachos de Yuca con Uchu-Puka, which is a very tasty Yuca and Cheese Griddle Cakes with a Spicy Sauce from the Ecuadorian Amazon.For my entree, I went with the Saice, which is a skirt steak that's been cubed and braised. A little spicy, which I like, but very one note-ish. I feel like I would've been better off with a classic skirt steak with chimmichuri sauce.For an entree, my wife ordered the Picante de Camarones, which is Shimp in a Spicy Peruvian Hot Pepper Sauce with Fresh Cheese, White Rice, Peruvian Canary Beans.  She said it was very good, although it was accompanied by undercooked rice.That segues to the mention of pathetic service. While the rice was quickly replaced, not once did the waiter ask me about my meal. Maybe it's my fault for expecting the waiter to want to make up for the hair on the plate but he simply didn't care.For over $100, with a drink, the experience was disappointing. That said, I feel like there's potential here so I'd consider going back but would have to stay basic.",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

To be honest, before Sat night I never even knew this place existed. And when I heard that we would be going to a place called Chucharama I giggled a bit because, well, because it is kinda a funny name, no? Anyway, we come in without a reservation on a Sat night because we had no clue it would be so busy. Wrong! Obviously no one likes waiting, but it wasn't that big of a deal to us. So we gave the hostess our number and we went around the corner and had a few drinks. Around 40 mins later we walked back without receiving a call from them. Call it intuition, or whatever you want, but we just felt it was an appropriate time to mozy on back. When we arrived at the restaurant there still was no seating available (this was at like 10pm, almost) and while it was a bit frustrating it definitely indicates how good the food is. After standing in the entrance for no more than two mins the hostess comes up to us and graciously offered us a quiet seat in the back, instead of the bar, simply for being so kind while we waited. How often does that happen!? I'll answer that; rarely. Once seated we really got to enjoy the coziness of the place. The dim lighting, the flickering of the wood burning oven, the beautiful accents in the architecture inside - everything just made it an enjoyable setting. And this is still considering the amount of noise and foot traffic of people at the bar waiting to be seated... None of that really mattered though for some odd reason. Onto the meal: My fiance and I ordered a really tasty Pinot from Argentina. It was a drier version of its California counterpart, but the flavors were distinct and it paired very well with our meals. Speaking of, holy shit the food was good. For an app we ordered the chorizo with peppers and onions - out of sight. For entres we ordered the skirt steak and a pulled pork leg. Holy hell did they capture flavors. Now, clearly from my name you can see I am not Spanish, and I did not grow up around Spanish cooking so my reference point is from the amount of different Spanish restaurants I eat at (a lot) and my fiance being Spanish, and her family cooking absurdly good food. That all being said, this is now her favorite South American restaurant in the area.Do yourself the favor and go here. You may have to wait, but that's ok - go with the mindset that it's worth it and it will be. I will be often, and eventually hope to tackle the whole menu.",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"
232,9lH5jtLGRa2h16B2ijkjzA,Jonathan B.,5.0 star rating,"After reading the other reviews here, I expected Cucharamama to be a place with descent but pricey food in a nice setting with slow/inattentive service. Instead, I ended up having one of the best dining experiences I've had in a very long time.My friend and I had reservations for 5:30 on a cold Thursday night. When we entered the restaurant we were greeted by the warmth and aroma of the wood-burning stove. We were the first two patrons there and were seated near the stove. First Course:We were having something heavy for our entrees, so we wanted to share a light appetizer. Our server recommended the peppers stuffed with squash. I've never been much of a squash fan, but my friend kicked the sound of it and I'm glad she did. I wouldn't go so far as to call the dish ""amazing"", but it was very good. Main Course:There were several seemingly good options on the menu, but we decided to share two dishes. First up was the grilled duck. I'd recently had a duck dish at the top restaurant in Baltimore and while that dish was excellent, this one outshone it. The duck was cooked perfectly and the presentation was very nice. The accompaniments were ok, but didn't really stand out. Next up was the star of the night--braised short ribs. I don't know who came up with the recipe, but had they been there that night, I would have married them on the spot! The short ribs were amazingly tender and the sauce was other-worldly. As good as the duck was, this easily topped it. Both dishes were pretty huge and I ended up taking home a nicely wrapped doggie bag. Dessert:We finished the meal with chocolate bread pudding in a shallow bowl of cafe con leche. The cafe con leche was a nice touch, but the dish was unremarkable as a whole. It was by no means bad, but compared to our entrees, it was just so-so. Summary:This place definitely wouldn't make anyone's ""Cheap Eats"" list, but I have certainly paid much more for food that wasn't nearly as good. The meal described above (plus a $35 bottle of wine and an order of tea with dessert) came out to $116. In my mind this was more than reasonable considering the quality of the meal, wine and service.

We had the calamari and shrimp fritters to start off, which were both fresh and delicious! For entrees, we weren't sure what we wanted to get, because there are a ton of tapas style dishes but then main dishes as well.  I wanted to try all of them... but on the server's recommendation went with the Pechuga de Pollo Asado.. a very yummy chicken dish with plaintains and eggplant.  There was some sort of jalepeno glaze on top that gave the dish a little kick, but for someone that sometimes fear spice, it was great and definitely added to the dish.  We ordered a side dish of their arroz con queso (as one of the girls notoriously loves rice & cheese), and that quite possibly will cause her to go there everyday until she leaves Hoboken.  It was a Peruvian version of mac n cheese to say the least! Very interesting and tasty.  The entire ambiance of the restaurant is nice too, with very spanish style decor, fire wood burning oven, and dim lights.  We had no problem hearing each other amongst the crowded restaurant either.  Great place to go with friends or even on a date (slash my boyfriend is well aware of where he's taking me the next time he comes to visit)...Total bill was about 55 (incl tip) per person for appetizers, two drinks, and main dishes split amongst four girls... and it was a ton of food to give you a sort of price range!Cheers!",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

249,ywXERO5HPuWOLG4eRVZCSw,Peter M.,1.0 star rating,Honestly who's rating these places? Either they have the staff rating or the owners ask all there friends to rate the place. This place was horrible. The waiter was rushing me to pick my drink didn't recommend anything. Then I finally picked and my drink came out it was call Flor De Jamaica .. It was vodka with a splash of grenadine and a cinnamon stick .. Disgusting. The food read mediocre on the menu but came out even worse then it read. I swear we felt like it was a process of elimination to pick something then when we finally picked we felt iffy about it. The food came out and is was terrible the pizza with manchego and Serrano ham pizza it was a mini size pizza that was super salty cubed Serrano ham which was weird . We expected thin sliced . Bottom line it was bad . We also ordered the cannelloni and that was a complete train wreck. I'm sorry must not be a good food night out for us but this place was awful. Or maybe our bar is set really high. Sorry I don't recommend this place . Service was very poor.

They brought a crispy bread for the table and it was fantastic too. We didn't need dessert but couldn't help ourselves.

257,0GAiTc9U33NCWnZNqo-9hg,S.L B.,4.0 star rating,"We visited Cucharamama last night and the overall experience was positive. We were seated at the back of the restaurant close to another table but the servers brought over ice water, menus and bread over very quickly. The bread was warm and the butter that accompanied it was sweet and scrumptious.We ordered cocktails, a mojito for my boyfriend and a frozen daiquiri for me, both were a hit. My daiquiri had a perfect alcohol to sweetness ratio. We ordered two apps to share. The calamari came out insanely quick but it was cooked perfectly with a crunchy batter and an addictive spicy dipping sauce. The second app we chose was a spinach, bacon and onion empanada. These were nice with the smoky bacon flavor being a little strong but the side vinaigrette it came with was delicious. We then picked out two glasses of Spanish Rioja to go with our entrees. I chose the Saice, a spicy beef stew that came with rice and beans. The stew itself was a deep red and I could've taken a bath in it. It was spiced but not overwhelming and it worked beautifully with the awesome sweet beans. The beef itself however was too rare and chewy. I wasn't asked it I wanted it rare or not so I'm not sure if that is how it is served in South American cuisine but I believe stews in general should have tender well cooked beef.My boyfriend had the special entree available only on Thursdays. It was a medley of meat, skirt steak, Colombian sausage and pork. He asked for the skirt steak medium rare but it came out rare. The sausage wasn't to his taste but the pork was a big hit. It was fatty but crunchy on the outside and full of flavor. The arepas and plantain that came with the dish were also nice. The service was friendly and quick and we are definetly coming back here. However we would probably just stick to the items from the wood burning oven rather then the traditional entrees.",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

(2 small pepper pieces, it looked like one pepper cut in half and then stuffed) The Spinach with bacon-onion sofrito, manchego and parmigiano was pretty good too. (2 small size empandas stuffed)The Pizza Serrana - $10 (serrano ham, manchego, aged parmigiano reggiano, red onion, andean ají amarillo) was my favorite.  This was delicious and my favorite thing of the night.  Also quite small, about 4 inches in diameter or roughly the size of one normal slice of pizza.The Salprieta - 10$Roasted Ripe Plantain with Fresh Cheese,  Curd, and Peanut Seasoning Mix.One roasted plaintain with 3 dipping sauces.  This was also pretty good.  This was the ladies favorite.The previous time here i had the churrasco as its a common staple in cuban food and it was pretty lame.  GF had the octopus and it was definitely not the way a good grilled octopus should taste.  It was extremely fishy in flavor leading us to believe it may have been canned octopus rather than fresh.The service was also pretty laid back and unattentive.  Definitely had a dry glass of water for the majority of the night.  To recap: the small plates are good but a terrible value for your money.  The price of the food is not helped with the lazy feel of the service.  I probably won't go back again unless someone convinces me otherwise.",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

So, we went yesterday to celebrate Valentine's Day and we were highly disappointed. First, they only had a pre-fixed menu which consisted of very limited selection. Secondly, there was nothing authentic about the dishes: empanada with blue cheese- definitely not south american fare and the shrimp ceviche was nothing close to being ceviche but more of a shrimp cocktail with tons of onion and btw, there were 3 shrimp in the order; for main entree we had the roast chicken (Medio Pollo de Patio al Horno de Leña con Puré de Papas con Pirque) and Spicy braised beef. While the braised beef was delicious the chicken was not what I was expecting: small portion and nothing like the peruvian rotisserie chicken I've had from other peruvian restaurants. Not only was our experience quite pricey (210.00 with 2 cocktails) it was a big disappointment.

The decor, colors and layout are great and they compliment each other. However, the chairs on which we sat were very uncomfortable. They seemed very old and lacked cushion. I felt I was sitting in a toilet seat. They were covered in cheap seat covers that were so dirty that it was hard not to notice. I have no complain about the service, except that we had to wait a little for a highchair which they brought from their other restaurant Zafra, even after we made clear in our reservation that we needed it. But that was not a big deal.The big deal is the food. It is good food, but they have to make sure that they call it as it is in the menu. I'll explain. My wife ordered Sango de Camarones, which was advertised in the menu as ecuadorean plate. When she got it, she was dissapointed to see that they took the liberty to change the recipe adding coconut milk and instead of being a dense puree of corn, it turned out to be a soup. They should have listed it as ""our take on Ecuador's classic"" or something like it. They do have a good selection of plates from different latin american countries and the concept is very good. Maybe we just tried something that they don't master well and we should give them a second chance.

And because of this initial research on my part, i already came in weary of the place....  I'm not about the service/ambiance/decor, i gave this place 2 stars for the following reasons...1) I had the Pollo al horno in a peruvian style...i didn't understand what was peruvian about this.  You need alot more aji panca and the sides of camote with some other sweet sauce was not to my liking.  It lacked authenticity and peruvian flavor.2) I also had the fried quinoa dish which was good but lacked salt.  3) Chicken anticucho was sadly not very flavorful, once again lacking the peruvian taste.  And once again needing more aji panca.  4) Their butter with that flat bread was actually good, probably the highlight of the evening.  So coming from a Peruvian, this place is a thumbs down...only their decor, service, and butter/bread saved them from a 1 star.  I saw many non peruvians there so i'm imagining it's for them and not for me.  Peruchos, sigan buscando",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

Just an FYI the menu (both drinks, apps and entrees) is very extensive, complex and gets expensive - if you do not like South American cooking at its finest stop reading.  It probably took us 15 min to get our bearings, anyways we started off with drinks and about 4 apps.  The drinks were great, I had some Brazilian cream passion fruit thing with a cinnamon stick in it, and we also got a bottle of Malbec.  We started with the mussels, beef empanadas, tamales, and shrimp.  The mussels were outstanding, they were in this amazing broth and you could drink as a soup.  The other 3 did not disappoint either, the complex flavor of the tamales were really cool - delicious and hard to explain (try them!).The real winner of the apps was the stuffed pepper, this thing was fucking amazing.  As a person who really does not like peppers whole (except for some flavoring) this thing was delicious.  I could eat about 10 and it was well worth the 5 min of heartburn.  The entree I had was pork loin (shredded w/ delcioius seasonings unknown) side of white rice, an onion bean salad and bowl of beans.  Again, very good and I ate about half as I was stuffed from all the previous apps.  Dessert was good, not great, we had a chocolate flan that tasted like it had booze in it but it did not and dulce de leche ice cream.  It was a good finisher but no where near as good as the rest of the meal.  The ambiance is great, very quaint little date spot with the wood burning stove right in the front.  Dudes, if you want to get laid, take the chicks here, drop some coin, enjoy the food and let the restaurant do the rest (see Seinfeld for further assistance).  Place was great and I cant wait to try her other Hoboken restaurant",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

It took 30 minutes just to get the menus without any beverage being served- it was not full, and there it was adequately staffed but poorly managed- on a Friday night! Menu was unrepresentative of Latin flavors, not the greatest layout, printed on cheap material prone to get dirty (surprisingly almost all in my table were). The menu offered limited vegetarian options (I think it was less than 5). Food was plain, really small portions, wine selection was poor and could have been done a lot better to complement the food. Prices were high for what it was worth and the terrible service. Did not get dessert as everyone was already fed up with the service.Ambiance was the only good thing, although the music was at times tacky. There was a light malfunction I noticed and was rather an important one.Being in the hospitality industry and knowing what to look for in F&B, this place was under performing its potential (turnover and up-selling seemed terrible).

Granted, we should have done our homework, but we thought we were just going out on a regular weeknight dinner and found ourselves paying anniversary celebration prices, if you get my drift. In any case, I will say that the ambiance was warm and intimate (great for a date) and both the food and service was good.

I'm glad to say I had a stellar dining experience from start to finish over the course of 2.5 hours. Started out with malbec, while the rest of my party opted for more exotic cocktails - the mojitos, white wine sangria, and pineapple-rum-brown sugar cocktails all looked excellent. One of my favorite parts of the dining experience (which would draw me out of Queens for a second visit) was the amazing cinnamon coated toasted bread with sweet butter - it was a challenge to back away from the bread in favor of leaving room for my entree. Ah, choices. Be sure to try the fried cod balls with garlic aioli sauce on the side, and the short ribs in red wine sauce. The atmosphere is one of the best parts of the dining experience - cozy is the first word that comes to mind - roaring oven behind the bar that doubles as a cooking oven. If I am ever in the neighborhood again (and my meal isn't comped, since it was a business meal), I would certainly return for drinks, and a ton of appetizers - there were a number of yummy looking empanadas and sides I was dying to try, and the main dishes are pretty expensive ($25) for what they are - duck, I understand, but skirt steak and short ribs, it seemed a little overpriced.

306,9eyN1N6cXO7FKaZAzQCDKA,Craige M.,4.0 star rating,"Clearly the time to go to Cucharamama is on a Friday in the summer when many have abandoned Hoboken for the beach. It would have been a 20 minute wait for a table with no reservation, which is no big deal. But there was immediate availability at the bar. I will definitely return to this restaurant and there is a good chance I would sit at the bar again, too. There are no issues with waiting for your server to wander by when you're sitting at the bar. Plus, you get to watch the chefs prepare and cook food in the wood stove. We went the all-appetizer route. It was not hard at all to come up with 5 things that sounded good to both of us, even considering I didn't want any olives and Jeff doesn't eat meat. The shrimp skewers were delicious. The kale was nice and garlicy. I wasn't crazy about the potato and cheese tamale, but Jeff liked it. It tasted milky to me. My favorite were the mini onion and blue cheese empanadas. The crispy plantains came with a tart cilantro dipping sauce. My rum on the rocks with a twist of lime and a splash of vanilla was also delicious. Jeff had a Peruvian beer. Our bill came to $62. We were full and very satisfied with our meal. The entrees average about $22, so I think we would have probably spent more if we'd gone the route of an app plus two entrees. The hostess was incredibly nice and even came to remove our menus when she noticed me looking for a place to set them aside after we'd ordered. The bartenders were very busy, but they never kept us waiting long when we asked for water refills or to place our orders. Everyone was quite pleasant. And the menus were completely pristine and easy to navigate. One thing I will say is that the food is not representative of one single country, so if you are looking for food from one area, you will be disappointed.

310,vu7niZEMWGVIMvBTlObz2w,Peter A.,5.0 star rating,"easily one of the most amazing restaurants I've ever eaten at. a south American, and mostly Peruvian based cuisine there are an immense variety of authentic and unique dishes that will blow your mind. add a wood burning brick oven to some of the dishes and you have guaranteed success. it is a typical tapas place so you have a choice of at least 30-40 types (I'm including side dishes) and then 10-15 main entrees. my father and i came for dinner one night (and it will certainly not be the last time) and had 6 tapas and 2 desserts. the desserts sadly (cause of my crazy sweet tooth) were the big downside. they were some takes on traditional items with a spin. for example we had the apple crepe which reminded me of an apple pie except it was open face with cinnamon sugar syrup apple chunks. also had the bread pudding but it was blah..both could have used some vanilla pudding although I'm not sure they have that since only I've cream listed was dulce de leche. they also do a spin on flan by adding spiced chocolate. espresso, brandy and tequila are some other items available. as for the tapas it seemed like one was better than the other. we had the shrimp ceviche..perfect mix of lime/avocado/onions; the side dish of plantain and eggplant purée which accompanied the pita bread started very well; had the serrano and manchego with toasted olive bread plate...loved how it was brought out on a cutting board for you to work with; the argentine chorizo cooked in the wood oven with peppers and onions was one of top dishes; the duck tamale (which beat even charritos around the corner) was perfectly made; and finally quinoa crusted chicken tenders were a nice touch. the best part of it all may have been the unique and delectable sauces that came with each plate and perfectly complemented the food..most especially with the chorizo and the tamale. i HIGHLY recommend this place in Hoboken and although for food I would have given it four stars because of the dessert it deserves the 5 star for the friendly and top notch service (very helpful and friendly staff). please do yourself a favor when trying to decide among the numerous places to eat in Hoboken and I guarantee you will not be let down.",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

I mean. what a name.So Cucharamama serves nouveau, delicate, refined Latin American cuisine. Forget about your typical margaritas. Embrace creative cocktails that lay claim to roots in Ecuador, Peru and Columbia. Throw away images of gigantic tamales and burritos. Think delicate (and small) peppers stuffed with pumpkin puree and cheese, tender arepas served with salmon roe, fine tamales layered with moist shredded duck, crispy flat breads with sweet butter and fluffy empanadas that encase creamy polenta. I have been to Peru and I can guarantee you that the food there is not this fine and delicate.Everything we had from the appetizer/ small plate section was phenomenal. Ok, so the Argentinean Chorizo was a little bit of a let down as it really was just that- a nice oily sausage. One would have expected a little twist and some creativity given the tone of the other dishes. Portions were also a little small for the price tag, unless you tell yourself you are in a French restaurant, so it was definitely not ""good value"" in terms of quantity, but it was fantastic in terms of quality. It's just like women. Why have many lousy ones when you can have one fantastic one? You definitely can't go wrong with the small plates. The main courses looked huge with the skirt steak being a popular order as plates of meat whizzed past us. Perhaps, the next time around, we shall give it a shot.There are no pictures. Not only was the food snapped up before the camera could be whisked out, but the ambience was a little dark.  Actually, very. One could barely make out the menu, much less the interesting wall decorations that seemed to hail from Latin America. There was a nice buzzy bar that you could hang out at to meet people or just watch the world go by. After all, the restaurant had a nice noisy buzz about it. Definitely no place for a romantic date where you actually when to hear each other.

The outdoor seating is also a nice touch in the Spring/Summer. I have never been disappointed in a dish here. They bring you fresh bread out of the oven with delicious butter and their cocktail menu is full of different wines and South American speciality drinks (I got the mojito last time and loved it). I would recommend the calamari as an appetizer as well as the peppers and ceviche. I would suggest getting only one appetizer for 2 people because you really want to be able to savor your main dish (unless you order all appetizers which is also another good route to go).

324,fyXTOuins0H1HMBMlLyijg,Caroline Z.,1.0 star rating,"I hate to give this place such a low rating because I really loved everything about it, the decor, the food, the wine...up until the food poisoning. I had ordered a small soup and a shrimp appetizer, and a glass of white wine. Nothing major. Perhaps they sourced their shrimp from the Gulf, because not an hour later I was vomiting and collapsing on the PATH platform, which was shortly after my vision and hearing started to get dim and I broke into a cold sweat on the train. I have never had this reaction to food before, and I generally enjoy all types of food. If you choose to go, be very careful of the seafood at this place. Needless to say, I won't be back.",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

329,8DvkDaeyubRwcpGCp9hg5w,Scott S.,4.0 star rating,"The food is 5-star all the way.  The only reason I have to give it four stars is because of the service (like many have also said).Over the summer I went here for an early dinner around 530 on a Saturday and the place was empty.  They said they couldn't seat us because of reservations.  I mean, cmon....we can't have dinner for an hour, hour and a half because they have reservations to book the place by 630,7ish?...The place was literally empty, I think there may have been one table..They said we could eat outside if we wanted.  It was about to POUR!  which 20 minutes later it did..  Anyway, made another rez and had dinner here friday night.  Even with the rez I had to wait a half hour, which is fine, thats pretty typical of places in demand.  But the service during the dinner was very slow (not like comfortable and relaxed like in Europe), but just slow and never brought drinks we ordered..stuff like that...although once we ordered the food came out really quickly.  So when all is said and done, I have to knock a star off of the review for service.  Is it enough to make me not want to return? No F'n way!  The food is RIDIC!Once they gave us the bread with the sweet butter, I knew the food was gonna be phenomonal...For two of us we ordered 3 or 4 apps and a main course to split, and that was a perfect amount of food...Along with 4 mojitos and I was set..The aps we ordered were the rice and cheese croquetts, chorrizo, and beef empanadas...The main course was a chicken dish from the wood burning oven...The food is incredible...the menu is huge, so I cannot wait to come back and try different things on the menu..Tastewise, I would say its easily one of the top few restaurants I have ever been to in my life.  The price wasnt bad either...sure the portion sizes are a little small, but that can be expected for high end food...total meal was like $115 for 2 with tax, tips and a few drinks each..Can't wait to go back!",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"
330,v1VhWUbDe_lcOHtcKYSeAA,Kelly A.,5.0 star rating,"This is a New York quality (and priced) place on a little side street in Hoboken.  Fantastic Latino food in a cozy and elegant setting. Love the wood burning oven that's just behind the bar.  It really sets to mood for the place.  I've actually sat at the bar with a friend for dinner and we made friends with the bartender, the chef and an interesting guy who was dining alone.  They also have outdoor white tablecloth tables outdoor when the weather is nice.You have to try to latino drinks - all made with fresh ingredients.  Mojitos, Caipirinhas, Margaritas...oh my!  They also have a great wine list.  Oh yeah, and the food - heavenly!This is a first class joint!  And if you can't afford to splurge here, the owners have a BYOB Latino resturant down the street, Zafra.",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

Award winning chef( think James Beard award) A little pricey compared to similar places, but food is worth the price. The space itself is a little cramped especially if you are seated near the bar as people walk by. Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable which is a pet peeve of mine. I highly recommend if you can get a in. Usually have to make a reservation at least a week ahead of time.",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"

338,_EvdYmnRUjHk1zVx84ar4g,Gioia L.,1.0 star rating,"My fiance took me here for my birthday last week March 15th.   The seafood was fresh and the wood oven pizza was fabulous! The hostess was pleasant as well as the young bus boy.  I even received a complimentary piece of flan from the kitchen. However, after travelling around the world and dining at different restaurants including the most upscale --I have never experienced a waiter so rude and pompous. Our waiter grew impatient when I asked questions about the menu instead of taking pride in the cuisine of the culture  He barely greeted us and did not check back to see how we were. He could not even fake being nice and wish me a happy birthday as the nice hostess did.  The hostess and the young bus boy were friendly and attentive to our needs. This waiter made us feel uninvited and that he had better things to do than describe the  items on the menu , greet us or even smile. (P.s. I was a waitress during college and my uncle owned a restaurant so I am familiar with what customer service is supposed to look like.",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"
339,1-OJKaGFSx-P2my1ArUd7w,Michael z.,3.0 star rating,"We have been here many times since it opened. Cucharamama was spectacular when the place opened - the Chilean wines were great (try the Carmenere) and the oven-cooked items were delicious. My wife is vegetarian, and they put together a generous vegetarian platter for her with most of the vegetarian appetizers and side dishes. However, over the years this place has slipped - service is sloppier, handling reservations became error-prone, and the presentation of the food is less stellar. The food is still good (the bread and butter they serve as an appetizer is wonderful), but lately the vegetarian platter got smaller and had fewer dishes on it - for the same price. The main dishes are still OK, and it's probably still a good date spot, but it's no longer trying as hard to please as it once was.",Cucharamama,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Latin, American,, Beer, Bar,, Cocktail, Bars"
