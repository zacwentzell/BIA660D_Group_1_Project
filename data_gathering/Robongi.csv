The fish is consistently fresh, the rice is always well-cooked, and the rolls are always well made. I entertain several sushi-loving friends with Robongi when they are in the area as well.

It's casual, loud, almost always full on the weekends so make sure you call ahead if you have a group. Me and my friends will make a reservation around 9 on a Saturday and each bring a bottle of wine and that will be our pregame for the night. I am a stickler for good sushi and you get pretty decent sushi here considering the reasonable prices. $16 for a special roll may seem insane in the suburbs but in Hoboken/City that's not bad. I'm only giving 4 stars because it's not a ""5 star"" restaurant. It's super casual, they play loud music and people come here for the fun vibes, BYO and reasonably priced, good (not amazing) sushi.

61,oMFWQKBM6PiJfhelHej__g,Kyle O.,3.0 star rating,"Great food and a cheeky atmosphere with BYOB that makes for a nice night out.Beware: they charged us $1 for a tiny amount of Sriracha and $1 for a tiny amount of eel sauce (since the roll advertised eel sauce and came with a couple specks of it), and they did NOT warn us about the charge. We found out when the bill came...not cool people! Pros:1. Sushi is fresh and tasty, we like the Iso Roll and the Salmon Sashimi the best, but all of their rolls are interesting and tasty, and there's a lot to try.  Oyaku donburi is also a lot of food, very filling, and tasty.  Their gyoza (we go steamed to think we are being healthy as we gorge on pork filled goodness) are also yummy.  We tried the spring roll the other day, and it was greasy deep fried goodness, but wasn't too special so we would probably not get that again.2. Service is adequate for Hoboken, you don't really get one waiter, they all kind of pitch in, so you just grab someone close and tell them what you need.3. Pricing isn't awful.4. BYOB is great, but on every page of the menu there is a ""warning"" that basically says there is a $25 per person minimum if you BYOB, which is kind of steep.  We always spend more than that, so we don't know if they actually charge someone $25 if they came in for lunch with a bottle of wine and only spent $18 a person as an example, but that's a bit odd.5. Good outdoor seating in the nice weather.Cons:1. Decor is cheeky/kitchy at best, you feel like you are in an amusement park ride or a really bad beach/lake setting.2. The BYOB $25/pp minimum might be a really bad surprise at the end of the meal, not sure if they actually enforce that or not.3.

The meal started off super strong in my book, but fizzled a bit through dinner and when the check came, it sort of got knocked down, but didn't get up again. (Any Chumbawamba fans out there?)First the place is pure kitsch. It's a bit small and not your typical sushi joint. It's more of the decor of a crab shack with wooden tables and crab shack signs and nets; fun, but just not authentic and not very formal. While everyone chose to eat outside, my man and I dined in. With that, the place could use a sprucing, the bathroom wasn't nice at all, if I drop a quick $80 on dinner, I could use some of the finer things of life.The sashimi deluxe was oh so buttery good. Really nice cuts of fresh fish (the usual suspects) that literally melted in your mouth. This got me pumped up for the rolls we just loaded up on. And that's where the meal fell flat ::womp womp::. The rolls were unimpressive. Three speciality rolls costing on the average $13-$14 should have me groaning with pleasure, these rolls just had me sigh. The eel roll was cooked. Either the waiter messed up our order or the menu plainly does not state that it is cooked and served warm, which we were not a fan of. The other 2 rolls were just ultimately not that great of combo's and quite tasteless (minus the immense spice from the jalapeno's and wasabi tobik0). We left some men behind on the plate, which I rarely do in the sushi world.When the bill came, I ultimately felt like I didn't quite get the value of delicious rolls and sashimi for the price paid.

Robongi's spicy tuna was chunky, an indication of chopped tuna mixed with spicy mayo - always better than tuna mash.

It was tuna on the outside packed with asparagus and yellowtail.  I've had better but this was solid. Bf got the chicken teriyaki bento set , which came with pretty flavorful pieces of teriyaki (and I don't like teriyaki), a pile of rice, shumai (interesting shumai), tempura- shrimp and veg (WOW the panko crumbs were light and airy, major yum), and a tuna roll.   A good value for $21.

Find a fantastic BYOB dining establishment and chill. That's what.Enter, this weekend. We'd played all day Friday/Saturday and weren't sure what Saturday night would bring, but we knew we should eat. A BYOB was on the agenda and we landed on Robongi. The dining experience, itself, was a little bit odd. We definitely didn't have one waiter. I'm not sure a.) who took our order, b.) who brought our food, c.) who kept refilling our wine glasses, or d.) who asked us to move - read on - but we were never in need of anything so the formula must work. It was actually kind of nice not to have a single person in charge of our table, instead it was a collective waiter team that took care of us. We started with edamame and the tempura appetizer. We easily identified the shrimp, but the fried vegetables were more of a guessing game, which we don't think we won. There was a sweet potato (yum!), a cucumber, and... things that tasted good but were unidentifiable to our Midwestern meat-and-potato eyeballs.Next, we moved along to the classic California roll (my choice, it was excellent, but I was left wondering who had left out the cucumber), the Yellow Tail roll, and the sweet potato roll. They were presented beautifully and easily set up for two people to enjoy without reaching over one another. The sweet potato roll wasn't one I'd ordinarily choose, but now that I've had it I'll probably choose it again and again. I was encouraged to try it with the soy sauce - sweet and savory. Mmmm.. I'm glad I'm no longer dating the guy who is afraid to try new things. Picky eaters suck. Our meal would have ended there, but this weird thing happened mid-entree where we were asked to move tables so they could accommodate a large party. That has definitely never happened to me before, but what were we supposed to do? We're nice Midwesterners so we obliged, though we were a bit put off by the odd request. However, at the end of our meal we were given ice cream on the house, which was nice that they acknowledged that they made us move after we were nice and settled. As the ice cream goes, I'd stick to the vanilla. The green tea ice cream wasn't as nice as I'd have hoped. Overall, I'd definitely go back.

125,oMVnqtBt63iYlZAxPoHbIA,Donna F.,4.0 star rating,"My boyfriend and I sometimes stop by here for dinner or order take-out whenever we're at a loss on what to eat on a Saturday/Sunday evening. This past Saturday (06/21), we decided to eat an early dinner at Robongi's, because we knew the place wouldn't be jam-packed with club-hoppers at 5 PM. There is something about this restaurant on any given Friday or Saturday night, where you can't enjoy a nice sushi dinner in peace, because hordes of barely legal 20-somethings camp out here prior to their 8-hour long booze and schmoozefests. I don't get it. Can someone please solve the mystery for me? Anyway, the one thing I'm not too keen on here is the decor. For a sushi restaurant, I don't expect to see anything of the Krusty Krab variety hanging from the walls and ceilings. Also, the music tends to be a bit...off; mostly Top 20 hits from roughly 10-15 years ago. But at least it's low enough that you can hear yourself and your significant other talk during your meal, so that's something.What saves this place from an average or below-average rating is their food. I have never been disappointed in any of their sushi in all the times I've had take-out or eaten there in person. Saturday was no exception. I ordered the Unagi Don (broiled eel over a bed of rice, served with thin strips of sauteed seaweed), and I chose salad as my side dish, since it was a warm day. My boyfriend ordered the Tonkatsu (sic?) Don, which was white rice, pork, and sauteed vegetables. He had miso soup and a spicy yellowtail roll as his sides. I helped myself to a few pieces of the spicy yellowtail roll and thought the flavors balanced each other perfectly: sweet with a touch of spice, not too pungent, but enough of a kick to tickle your tastebuds. I loved the texture and flavor of my eel, and the portions were extremely generous.Our service was fine, if a bit over-attentive (but then, we were virtually the only ones inside, so there you go), but everyone who works there is very nice and polite.

The Wasagi Twist (bacon wrapped scallops and steak) is also very good. It's not too heavy and not too spicy, a lot of flavor. There are many other delicious items on the menu, and I will be back to try more.The atmosphere here is probably not what you would expect from a sushi restaurant.

Not only did everyone at my table enjoy their tasting piece, but they placed another order for the same dish, as well as requesting several of our other rolls rice-less. Not sure what the white sauce they drizzled over it was, but it was perfect. A soft flavor that didn't overpower the tuna.

On first impression this place looked pretty cheesy with its seafood/fish/sailing decorations. Once you walk in the first thing you might notice is the music. The music and volume changes depending on the day and time, but most likely it is going to be dance music and the later you go there, the louder it is going to get. I feel like its some sort of a pre-gaming ritual to prepare you for a night out, or maybe it's their way of getting you out of there quickly. The one time the music was relaxing when I was there on a Sunday evening so it might be worth a try to check it out then.As for the food itself, the fish is always fresh and the rolls are tasty, I have mostly been getting the sweet potato rolls, salmon avocado roll or dragon roll with salmon instead of eel and all have been great, the miso soup is pretty good as well. The service has always been quick, efficient, accommodating and pleasant. Although they are quick to bring out the food, I don't usually feel rushed to get out of there quickly.

The atmosphere is kitschy but fun. Like many other Hoboken restaurants they have outdoor seating and are BYOB. Seating inside can be a little cramped but the staff is very accommodating and tries to seat you as soon as possible, even on busy nights. Also important to note, I have never felt rushed with my meal, even on these busy nights when I'm killing a bottle of wine with a friend over girl talk. My starter staples, miso soup and edamame, were good but those are pretty fail-safe options. As far as sushi, I'm not the most adventurous, but I'm also not a California roll type of girl. I've tried....spicy tuna roll (love that they put crunchy tempura flakes in this), shrimp tempura roll (anything fried is going to be good, comes with tobiko which is a unique touch), calamari roll with avocado (I know, I know again with the fried non-sushi! Not as good as I thought it would be), and finally the Philadelphia roll (if you like smoked salmon and cream cheese you will love this one). I've never gotten sick from the sushi, but I've also never been blown away by presentation, quality or freshness. Bill comes to about $50 with appetizers, a few rolls and dessert for two people.

Japanese food (and basically any Asian food in general) is not something people associate Hoboken with. With that being said, Robongi is clearly one of the better options available on Washington Street.AtmosphereWhenever I am in Hoboken and pass by Robongi it is always packed. Typically there is a wait from what I've seen. Be prepared for blaring techno music and tight seating. You likely will get bumped into AT LEAST once during your time there.PricePretty reasonable for the area. Portion sizes are very good for what you pay.ServiceFriendly but rushed.FoodWe split for an appetizer the squid salad and Nasu. The Nasu is marinated eggplant in a miso sauce. I wasn't expecting much at first but my friend convinced me to try it. It was delicious!! Loved the sauce. The squid salad was good but was doused in mayo. Too much for my preference.We then split 3 rolls - eel avocado, Alaska, and the Tuna Naruto. Eel avocado is pretty self explanatory and was good. The Alaska had salmon, avocado, and cucumber. It was probably the best of the three but could have been a bit fresher. The Naruto had a large amount of tuna and was wrapped in cucumber. The tuna was good but not too fresh. All that food was just enough for my friend and I. We were pretty stuffed after that.One of the aspects of Robongi that made me knock off one star was the lack of higher quality seafood options.  All the salmon was farmed and their seafood entrees weren't anything unique. Most neighborhood Japanese places are like this, though.  Totally expected. Yet, once you have been to higher quality restaurants with a more diverse seafood selection it is hard to put the two in the same league.  Despite all the praise this place gets, you would think the types of fish would be of superior quality.OverallRobongi is best for larger groups. In that setting I will likely come here again. If you are looking for a more intimate quieter experience check out Illuzion one block over.

We sat at the bar and it was not crowded at all, however we were there lunch time during the week (Wednesday).  The dinner prices are of course higher than lunch.  You get a great view of the Hudson river because your right on the water.You have to pay for parking during the day, because they think you are going on the ferry, but after 6pm there is free parking right in front.   The waitress service was excellent and my friend who commutes a lot there knows her and she is the manager and very friendly (and has my friend says nice to look at).",Robongi,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanesetdassttaucfxffdddaerfstets,, Sushi, Bars"

The sushi/sashimi is super fresh and the daily special rolls are FANTASTIC! If you come here during lunch, the restaurant is usually more quite. Lunch is a fair deal and you get soup or a salad. Although the daily special rolls are a little bit more expensive than the regular special rolls are not that pricey. As an ex-Park Sloper, I have paid more at some sushi places there.

Everyone was friendly, the food was priced great and everything tasted excellent. I took my friend back earlier this week and again, the food was excellent but I had a less than pleasurable experience with the young man who was filling waters and pouring wine. (Our waiter was GREAT by the way) So, we sit down and I see two noticeably different wine glasses and as the young man started to pour in one of the glasses, I politely asked if we could have matching glasses. I may have even jokingly said ""Ran out of glasses?"" He seemed not to hear me, so I asked again. He stopped mid pour and said he would check. Not even a minute later he brought the match to my friend's glass and I smiled and thanked him. Then he walked away, stood aside and looked at me with disdain.I am very intuitive. I could tell he had an attitude because I asked for matching glasses. A few minutes later he came to the tables to the left and right of us and filled everyone's glass BUT mine. I ended up pouring my own wine after realizing he was refusing to deal with me. He came back some time later and filled my friend's glass with water and REFUSED to fill mine. Horrible. Now, aside from his blatant, sour attitude, we had a great time.Today, I decided to have food delivered to my office, for me only. My food was about $28 and they charged $1.00 per eel sauce, so $30 was my end total. Now, the restaurant is about 4 blocks from me and the food came rather quickly so I was pleased, initially. I think I was a little thrown off by the charge for eel sauce, so I hesitated reviewing the cost. Eventually I wrote in a 2$ tip. Now, I always struggle with tipping etiquette for delivery. I hear so many different things, and I am still learning the culture honestly. I tip 18-20% at a sit down restaurant and really don't get delivery a lot at all. Maybe I should have given 3$ or 4$?? Anyway, when I gave the receipt back the delivery guy pointed at the receipt and said ""2$"". I looked at him and said ""I'm sorry. I don't understand what you're trying to say"" and he waved me off, let out a deep sigh and said ""Shit"" as he walked out of my office. I was so disgusted and offended. Regardless of the tip, his attitude was unnecessary and extremely rude! Then, I get to my sushi and it had spicy mayo on it which was NOT mentioned on the menu for this particular roll. I despise spicy food. Total bummer and I refused to call for them to correct it because of the delivery guy's nasty attitude. Bottom line, the food rocks. I have experienced great service and warmth from MOST of the staff but the issues with the two I encountered left a sour taste in my mouth and I am a service oriented person.

The Miso soup was fine. The pickles were not good nor worth the price for the quantity. The soba with chef special sauce was good. The Black Window and Iso rolls were very good. Then we were served a check without asking if we wanted to see a dessert menu. I actually wanted to order dessert for the first time in forever so this was so funny. Then i ordered the banana tempura but they didnt have it. Its such an easy thing so that was surprising. So i asked to see a normal menu and got pork gyoza. They served us forks next. Why would I want a fork at a japanese restaurant? For a newbie this would be fine but its not acceptable to do this unless asked. We were in Japan less than 6 months ago and besides, this would never happen in nyc. I ordered the japanese pickles- which is atypical for white diners and indicates that I am pretty familiar with the cuisine. Well anyway, Gyoza was average so the ending of the meal was a let down.

We went at 8:30 on a Friday .. we had to wait about 20 minutes and then we were seated. The music was unbelievably loud and when I asked to have it turned down they told me ... ""People come here for the club like atmosphere"" ... really they do? We made it through the meal and left with some slight hearing damage.. but I decided to give them another Friday night try.

Dry, stale, warm, tough at its best.The fish was beyond lackluster. Dont know if it was an off day. It seems like they were trying to push out all the stale past its prime fish that they had left over from the weekend.And if thats the case. Shame on you. For such an acclaimed establishment with such a high rating on zagat I just could not believe the quality of the tuna and salmon was so low. The fish had a drynes to it and either it was due to how it was cut or just the fish itself but it was simply a tragedy on how tough it was.The only reason this place did not get one star instead of two was the fact the hot food was good. The chicken terriyaki and shrimp tempura were made well and were tasty. The chicken was quite flavorful juicy and tender. The shrimp had a light crispy batter and were cooked just right.Beyond the hot food and low quality of the fish, the place is dimly light and somewhat dingy.From what I noticed a lot of ppl like the ""funky"" decor. Which is ok, but when you begin to notice the actual filth that lays on top of the tacky decor it gets pretty outright repulsive.They keep the lights real dim and low as if they are trying to hide the filth that surrounds the guests.And its just my opinion but if they have no scrupples about not caring of keeping the dining room clean, i can only imagine the nightmare that lurks in the kitchen and in the fridge.Just dont know how they have gone this long without health inspectors getting them to clean up their act.Anyway if you dont mind being served stale fish in a dingyvenviroment, by all means check it out. But dont say I did not warn you.Mgmt if you read this please purchase some dusters and some lemon pledge and while your out buy some fresh fish from the sushi place next door.I dont hate, just being honest.

I was a little put off by the loud techno music, but i got used to it after I started concentrating on the food.I usually order them through delivery.com, so I never knew how the place was until I went there with my parents. I was a little put off at the start because of the crowd and how they seemed to be understaff (or the waiters were just like to walk around in very fast pace and tons of plates on their arms). But that seems to give them high efficiency because we got seated very fast despite of the long line waiting, and the sushi chefs were super efficient. Now onto the food, each piece is big, and as an ex sushi chef, the sushi was very well made. I recommend all the special rolls, and if you like tuna and eel, get the Gozilla roll. If we're just talking about the food, I'd give this place 4.5 stars.If you live in the area, I'd suggest order online, unless you want to have a very cosy, loud, uncomfortable dinner.

As a regular customer going here every single week for the past year I have NEVER been treated so bad by a restaurant in my entire life.  Going here every week  with my husband not once have we ever been acknowledged that we are regulars, which is not okay but we let it go.  A few weeks ago the manager asked us to leave after an hour of dining because we were done with our meal, we left feeling disappointed that we would be asked to leave (literally the minute after we paid our check) after an hour when we come here literally every friday night for the past year. We walked in for dinner this evening at 750 with hesitation after they were so rude to us a few weeks ago and asked for a table for 2. The manager says you can eat here but we have a party of 30 people coming in at 9pm so you have to leave by then all the tables will be used. My husband and I rushed our meal and started to see that there was no party of 30 coming, new customers are being seated to the right and left of us. I asked customers to the right and left who were seated after us if they were told about about a party at 9pm and they both said no. We soon realized that they purposely told us this to get us out, we have never stayed in this restaurant more than an hour for dinner, usually in and out within 40 minutes. My husband nicely said ""its 9pm where is the party of 30?"" He said oh they cancelled. We said well advice to you from working in the restaurant business you should not tell your regular customers that they need to leave by certain time, you should welcome them and make them feel special. He started screaming at us in the restaurant in front of customers. Telling my husband ""go F yourself, what are you going to do about it, calling him mental""  in front of customers.  We are good loyal customers who have NEVER experienced anything like this. My mouth was dropped the entire dinner realizing that the manager fully lied to us and made up a party coming that never existed to get us out of the restaurant within an hour. We will NEVER go back to this restaurant again, and watch closely how fast they try to get you in and out. And I have found hair in my food on numerous occasions here.

I felt like i belonged at a crab shack along the Chesapeake Bay, and my table should have been covered with newspaper - certainly was not the decor of a yummy sushi restaurant.Honestly, I could have done without the middle school flashback music (Cotton Eyed Joe twice in a 1 hour seating, really?!), I'd prefer having a slightly more elegantly done roll, and it was a little more snug than I prefer, but the food was delicious.

Needless to say I was upset because if you had the nerve to call me and tell me I owed more money at least get the order right. I called them to ask where it was and they said, ""oh um sorry driver will bring it out to you"" I said, "" how long?"" She says 30mins. So you want me to wait 30 more mins to eat my food. Thats unacceptable I said, "" no, I am going to call delivery.com and they will talk to you. They called and managers didnt really care at all that they treated a customer like this and they said the spicy mayo sauce will be there in 30.

The first time I went there I was shocked at the loud hiphop music, but after a while it grows on you :) Service is great and attentive, though there are a few lingering waiters that are a little too pushy, always trying to clear the table before you've finished eating. I love their assortment of specialty rolls, especially the changing weekly specials. They like to match their weekly specials to holidays or seasons. I always try them out. Sometimes I stop in after work for some take out and they are great about offering me a seat and water while I wait. I would give them 5 stars if they had better appetizers and a classier ambience. Bumpin music is great for a party but not my preference for dinner, especialy after a long day of work. So I don't recommend this place fro a romantic date, but definitely for a laid back meal without breaing the bank. Order Tips:- Definitely try the Rock & Roll. Yoro roll is good too.

Sadly, the entrees were simply lacking. Unfortunately, the rice with the sushi deluxe was not sticky enough and crumbled upon contact. This should not happen with sushi. Our other entree was an eel cucumber wrapped special chef roll. It was slightly warmer than room temperature, inconsistently wrapped and oddly sized.

I had the 2 roll lunch special and granted they had very fast service (served almost instantly) that could also be the downfall of my experience. I had the crispy salmon and crispy tuna and both ""crispiness"" of them felt stale. Granted, its a weekday and there aren't much people coming in, that shouldn't keep them from serving good food. It's averagely priced, though. Might come back but then there's about a hundred sushi places in Hoboken (someone would need to explain this to me).

I enjoy Robongi the most during the warmer months because of its outdoor seating on Washington.

412,tTzXRmjOaYbh3tKsPx9X6A,Jin C.,3.0 star rating,"I wanted to find a sushi place to eat in hoboken and saw this place got some pretty good reviews on yelp.  It was byob and we picked up some beers at the liquor store a few blocks away.  We got there around 6:30.  The place is small and wasn't packed but it looks like there were party reservations cos they ended up seating us in the front near the door.  The decor is very nosy/dark with lots of fish nets, streamers, signs, etc which is different and I think they were trying to go for like a marina/street vendor look.  We got the gyoza and robongi crab cake which we thought was good.  Then we ordered the seafood comb teriyaki, rainbow and lobster roll.  I was expecting good sushi rolls but was pretty disappointed just the way they were presented.  The rolls were chef specials but they were 6 small pieces and rolled as if they squeezed too hard making the rice compacted with very minimum ingredients in them.  Maybe it was just that one sushi chef because I saw other people's meal and they look much better.  As we were eating, they were squeezing people in...ie. a couple, baby, stroller and highchair next to us in the small space in front of the window which was pretty annoying cos they were having a hard time situating themselves but it was a Friday night.",Robongi,3.5 star rating,$$,"Japanesetdassttaucfxffdddaerfstets,, Sushi, Bars"

Between sushi on Manhattan to Boston, to virtually anywhere I've sampled it, Robongi is the best. The crunchy spicy scallop roll is my favorite and the specials are always delectable. The atmosphere is one of a kind because the servers get to hook up their iPods and play what they want. I've heard everything from KC & JoJo, to the Spice Girls, to Tupac playing on any random night. The service is consistently the best I've ever had. Take a sip of your water and it's almost instantly refilled. It's BYOB, and the lunch specials are incredibly reasonable. I've dined al fresco, done take out, and received delivery, and I'm always impressed. Since moving away, anytime I find myself in the Hoboken/NYC area, I make sure to stop in for my favorite.
