I've been here several times and each time, I've had consistently excellent service. The meal was not greasy at all, the portion size was just perfect, and the salad was fresh and crisp, as it should be. I ate this meal two hours ago and don't feel the post-prandial crash I usually do after eating platters from any other establishment so that's an excellent indicator of quality. Check out the picture and I'll be darned if the sight doesn't put your salivary glands in a frenzy (in a good way, of course haha)! The auntie and uncle who run the cart are very pleasant and always greet customers with a smile, which is always uplifting after a long day of travel, study, or work.

Never had egg with it before but it puts it over the top. Unlike other places where you get the big chicken tikka pieces, they'll shred it and it's perfect. Also if you like it spicy, they will make it spicier for you as well. The service is also great. The guy who works the cart is very nice and friendly. Honestly go back more often because of the service in addition to the great food.Long story short.

Royal Halal sounded promising in reviews and I walked over this afternoon to try it out. I ordered a Kathi Roll ($6 for 2 pieces) which made for a very sumptuous lunch. A little oily, but the food was pretty authentic and the spices were on point. Fora moment I was back in Mumbai!The cart offers a better variety than most other carts - mostly South Asian and this play to your strength strategy works very well for them - and us!You can always order online and go pick up your food. It's clean and the quality is pretty good too. The best part - you can always walk 2 blocks to Bryant Park and enjoy your fresh, hot, meal there.

Ive lived in new york a few years back but this time i came to visit and  stayed in times square for a week and I've visited this cart about more than half my trip. Every single time i went the lines was not too bad so i never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my food.Chicken over rice: the chicken is flavorful and very very tender. Lamb over rice: this was my favorite dish here, the lamb was cooked perfectly and had ample flavor.Shish kabab: i was expecting this to be a lot less soft and tender. The flavor was decent. Nothing i was crazy for.  I feel like theyre bot real kababs, they're just chicken breast on a stick. $3.99 for one, this dish added up quickly because I easily ended up spebds $16 on one mealHot dog: decent, but nothing out of the ordinary.On another note, everything here was halal and all the prices were listed which i thought was honest because i went to the street cart down the block and the guy easily charged $10 for medicore lamb over rice(pretty sute he thought we were tourist and he didnt have his prices listed) when it was much tastier here and afforable ($5.99).",Royal Grill Halal Food,5.0 star rating,$,"Halal,, Food, Trucks,, Street, Vendors"

The Chana Daal is fantastic, and never fails to deliver. The owner has a keen eye and never fails to recognize his repeat customers.Beyond veggie, the chicken is also excellent if you are so inclined. Generally, I would recommend anything - for the price, the taste and the expediency, I cannot imagine even the possibility of a better alternative.

57,PN5h5hY8xEK0fO-BSn19fw,Jon R.,5.0 star rating,"""Halal cart,"" ""amazing service,"" and ""great food"" are not phrases that generally go together in my mind. Royal Halal is the exception. They make a mean chicken & rice with a salad and a vegetable samosa for a cool $6 (but have a heart, leave a buck or two tip if you like it). Pretty swell for the Times Square area, the overpricing capital of Manhattan. The husband-and-wife team in the cart is super friendly and funny. TOURISTS: get a chicken and rice; it's a halal cart, not a Philly cheesesteak cart. I'm sure they do a good cheesesteak, but if you're going to a halal cart, get the good (read: ethnic) stuff.Worker bees: You can call ahead for pickup at 347-418-6388, which is nice if you're in a rush.I honestly can't believe I'm rating a NYC food cart, but they deserve the praise.",Royal Grill Halal Food,5.0 star rating,$,"Halal,, Food, Trucks,, Street, Vendors"

It's street food so it's gonna be a little messy and greasy but a fork and styrofoam container are included just for that. If you're up for it, he will even make it extra spicy with fresh peppers, just like how I grew up. The chicken and ""lamb"" are extremely tender, moist and flavorful, the sauce pairs very well with it. This is a bargain lunch for just $6 and your yelp card will be stamped extra if you bring friends. I will make it a ritual to come at least once a week, that is how good this food is. I already have recruited 10-12 people to check it out in just a couple days.

Many streets and avenues have halal carts but take a look at the menu and couple who work there 5 days a week during weekdays and you will find a menu full of variety and a sweet couple of people who cook authentic dishes.  The dishes take time because they are cooked to order.

108,VWI6DvG4IWg3qGo3n6hKGg,Jason L.,5.0 star rating,"One of the best food carts in Midtown (yes, better than the Halal Guys and other places supposedly ""famous"" among New Yorkers according to non-New Yorkers).If you1) understand kind of food you can typically get at food carts (this is a cart, by the way, not a truck, contrary to its current categorization),2) know that ""lamb"" isn't, you know, lamb, and3) appreciate that Yelp ratings are subject to ""star creep,""you'll understand why this gets five stars even if it isn't exactly fine dining.General info:- The owner has an uncanny ability to remember faces. It can actually be really impressive/spooky.- Everything they cook to order tastes pretty fresh and well-prepared. The lettuce tastes like lettuce. The rice actually has flavor and texture.- They have loyalty punch cards. The number of orders you need before you get one free has increased a bit over time (from six to eight in the time I've been frequenting the cart), but I'm certainly not complaining.- Even without the punch cards, prices are good (right in line with typical prices, ~$6 per entrée).- The cart right next to this one arguably sometimes has better biryani (and sometimes has samosa chaat, which I love), but they're much, much less consistent and generally less friendly/accommodating. Royal Halal has longer lines for good reason.Recommendations:- The (paratha!) kati rolls are the best around, and not just among food carts. I recommend getting them mixed (chicken + lamb together).- The chicken tikka is very tasty. Just don't expect it to recognize it as chicken tikka.- The pre-/par-cooked stuff that sits around a bit after the weekday lunch rush (daal, biryani, chicken curry) often (understandably) isn't quite top-tier-worthy, but it's all still pretty solid. The hard-boiled eggs they sometimes include with the biryani, while very appreciated (definite points earned for not just adding a tiny bit more spice to chicken and rice), are almost always overcooked. I'm not a huge fan of the fish, but that might be partly due to paranoia on my part.Tips:- In addition to the owner and his wife, there are some other guys who work the cart later in the evenings/weekends. The food is always good, but there is a bit of variation in how each person prepares each dish.- Like with all similar food carts, sodium levels can get pretty high. If you're wary of this, try not to load up on the lamb, tikka mix, or sauces (aka ""the good stuff""). If you're like me, disregard the previous sentence and just chug a gallon of water with/after your meal.- Portions are generous despite the low prices. One entrée is a good meal for most people. Two is pushing it even if you're pretty hungry. You probably shouldn't do three.",Royal Grill Halal Food,5.0 star rating,$,"Halal,, Food, Trucks,, Street, Vendors"

Well, I had a huge crazing the next day so hailed a cab and paid the $10 fare to take me back for some. It too was delicious. I will say that the meat is well seasoned and the rice is perfect.
