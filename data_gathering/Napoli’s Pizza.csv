Inside is a nice setting and it's BYOB so you can bring a few beers or a bottle of wine which is nice. Waiter was really attentive and served our table within a few minutes of entering. We tried the Sicilian and just a regular plain pie. The sicilian was great, nice airy crust with a nice crunch. It differed from a traditional Sicilian as it was round in shape, nonetheless it had the rest of the characteristics of a traditional one. The regular pie was excellent as well, nice crunch and crispy to the edge. The owner was inside checking tables making sure everyone was enjoying themselves.

2,dD-e4MWK3p5xUK9gcWpu9w,Emma P.,4.0 star rating,"I used to go to the original Napoli's every couple of weeks for pizza and then I moved downtown and it was kind of far... So I was thrilled to see that they have very recently opened up in the old Grimaldi's spot on the corner of First and Clinton.They have done a great job of renovating the restaurant. There's a new frontage, lots of wood and some nice lighting. It's a 'boken pizza joint so it's not super fancy or anything but I prefer it to the original, overall it looks a lot more modern.The menu is a lot bigger than it used to be but apart from an occasional salad for the table all I ever come here to eat is the pizza! The pies are thin crust NY style pies and I would recommend spending an extra couple of bucks and ordering a Margherita rather than the Original pie. I'd also recommend sticking with the more traditional toppings rather than the more inventive ones.There was a bit of a mix up with our pie - we received one with sausage and anchovies (why would you order that?!?) - but they made our correct pie quickly and comped our drinks to take care of the mix up. The pizza here is excellent just as good as at their other place. There's a few kinks they need to iron out (get a door closer on the front door to stop the draughts and for the love of God give the servers pencils and pads so they don't screw up orders) but I'll give them a break as they only just opened.What else do you need to know? It's BYOB like the original and they have the two slices and a soda deal like the original at lunchtime. And it's insanely cheap for the quality of pie you get, dinner for two for $25.00 is a deal in anyone's book.

Went here on Easter Sunday night craving a perfect NJ pizza and they did not fall short. we were instantly greeted with warm welcomes and it felt like a typical Italian family vibe.

We were able to see the guy make our pizza from start to finish and it made it that much more mouth watering. The pizzas are made in wood fire ovens and cook super quickly!

Once the staff finally found it, I returned home with quite the disappointment. Instead of a Napolitano style pizza with fresh mozzarella, juicy sausage, and garlicky broccoli rabe, I got a dry/flavorless mess. The pizza was stiff and tasted like the cardboard box it came in. I'm not sure how they think they could get away with replacing fresh mozzarella with the dry stuff in Hoboken of all places. Sausage was just bad so I picked it off. Finally, the broccoli rabe was an afterthought as someone obviously forgot to put it on before the oven. On top of everything the pie was cold after a one block walk and continues to make my stomach rumble as I type this.
