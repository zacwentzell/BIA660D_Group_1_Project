1,BZtrGsW7RJ5ZC8-UbLB27Q,Ed W.,1.0 star rating,"Came in specifically to try the happy hour - literally the only thing I came in for, to have a three dollar 'domestic' draft.  I order a Boston-based Sam Adams from the USA.   I get handed a check for a full price beer - not a big setback, but pretty annoying.  I asked the bartender what exactly is a domestic draft here.  Bartender says sorry we changed the happy hour menu, only bud/Miller/coors are $3.   Wtf then why does your happy hour menu say otherwise?  Wouldn't be so annoyed if this wasn't the SOLE reason I wanted to try your place out. Lesson learned - don't assume posted happy hour prices are what they actually charge you inside",Hudson Ultra Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (Traditional),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"
2,5DTr5PwhQxZKR36smP14Hw,Ashley S.,1.0 star rating,"We don't recommend coming for dinner. There was a long wait for our burgers, the burgers weren't cheap and tasted average, and horrible service. They gave us a drink menu but we later learned that they didn't have any cocktails and most beers because they are redoing their menu. There are better and cheaper options nearby for dinner.",Hudson Ultra Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (Traditional),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"
3,RFu3iJvWsKs8Hc_lgRY4DQ,Sam V.,5.0 star rating,Came one night around 10. Place wasn't packed but it seemed like a cool bar/lounge to check out near the Hoboken station. The bouncer was really chill and actually seemed friendly. Got patron shots for 5$ each and some ipas. Quick service and more than affordable prices. I left around 11 but I definitely do see myself coming back here and staying much longer into the night/morning. Also my friend and I were allowed to sit in the reserved couches area so that was awesome.,Hudson Ultra Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (Traditional),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"
4,xkAqppGO-UI0Ebr6DSk_Vw,Deana A.,3.0 star rating,"I was debating between 2 or 3 stars. First off, my husband and I came here on a Friday afternoon around 1pm. There were a total of 10 people in the place including us. The waitress seemed inexperienced and did not come by after we received our food to check on us as we needed another drink by then. It took a really long time to get our food and while my linguini in clams was ok (pasta was on the edge of bring too hard) my husband's burger was well done when he ordered medium. Not impressed and will not come back as there are so many other places in Hoboken to chose from. Don't waste your time or money.",Hudson Ultra Bar,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (Traditional),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"
