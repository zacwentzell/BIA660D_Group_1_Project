Because my night doesn't end until I'm chowing down on wings and fries.The store front is a decent size with like 7-8 tables that can seat 4 people each, so bring a party. Typical decor for a fast food joint. The service though, is actually horrendous. When you walk up to the register to order, the attitude you get is like you're bothering them, even though they are working. It actually super annoying, I'm paying for food, so why are you being so rude and annoyed?On to the food now! I always get the buffalo wings, and my goodness, they are delicious. Disclaimer, there are super saucey! The wings are perfectly cooked and breaded and drenched in their sauce, can't go wrong with that. And I always get their gravy fries, which are also super delicious. I wish there gave the option to add cheese, uhm hello disco fries! Only downside is they charge you for the sauces for your wings, and don't tell you. They'll ask you ranch or blue cheese, and don't tell you its an additional charge, which is grimey. Anyways, I'll be back eventually but I'm going to start looking for another wing joint with better service.",Cluck U Chicken,3.0 star rating,$,"Chicken, Wings,, Fast, Food,, Halal"

Of all the cluck u's I've been to, this is probably the best. The restaurant was really clean and food quality was better than the cluck u by my home. Everything was hot, fresh and delicious. The fried chicken had a nice crispy exterior, a good salty bite and moist and juicy inside. The honey hickory boneless wings is really delicious and goes well with the blue cheese dip. Mac and cheese was cheesy and delicious. Mini bites were an absolute flavor bomb. At the end of our meal, my friends and I were all full, satisfied, and had leftovers for the next day. Prices are fair. Workers were all nice. It was a really pleasant surprise and I'd definitely recommend this place.

The food:* The food looked amazing but unfortunately it wasn't good. I got the BBQ burger meal and Buffalo wings. The burger was a tiny patty, huge bun and way too much lettuce. It didn't have much flavor and was pretty dry. * The buffalo wings were terrible and absolutely drenched in honey BBQ sauce. I love buffalo wings but had to throw out 3 wings. * The fries are the reason this is 2 stars instead of 1. They were very good. Customer service:The ladies working there were pretty nice. BUT, when I walked in and gave my order I was told the soda fountain machine wasn't working and can select a can. Guess what? They charged me 60 cents extra for that. Then they also charged me 70 cents extra for cheese on the burger. Every single burger I've ever ordered has had cheese included in the burger. Then I got charged 70 cents extra for ranch dipping sauce with the buffalo wings. Total should have been $13.87 with tax, I got charged $16. I also asked for ketchup and mayo I only received ketchup.

16,RTkQwNM7qmP8krwleLU49g,Efrain R.,2.0 star rating,"Okay, so on a good note, they're open really late which is great being there are tons of bars out there. Perfect late night spot. Now, I was there pretty early so decided to stay and eat. Roughly 8-8:30 so it was pretty empty. I didn't have the fried chicken which people crave about but I did order their wings which I gotta say were just okay. I tried ordering their super hot ""911"" wings which you need to sign a waiver for, but they unfortunately weren't serving them that night.  Highly disappointed. I then decided to order the second hottest wings called ThermoNuclear BBQ along with some Sweet Chili wings and some Garlic Parmesan wings. GarlicParm sauce was delicious but it was literally just poured on top of some subpar wings. Sweet Chili wings were properly prepared and super enjoyable. As for the ThermoNuclear BBQ wings, super disappointment. I should have complained to the staff or at least have taken a pic for proof. It was weird because the GarlicParm wings had too much sauce, the SweetChili's had just enough, while the ThermoNukes barely had any. And it was far from hot. Makes me wonder how hot the 911 wings are. Besides that, their french fries were delicious. Oh, and here's another problem. If you're looking to mix and match wing flavors, you can't. You have to order separate orders of each flavor. For example, I wanted to order a 15 piece wings, and have them give me 5 of each sauce I've mentioned. They told me I couldn't do that. I would have to order 3 different orders of 5 piece wings which runs you $5.99 each instead of paying $14.99 for a 15 piece. This absolutely makes no sense since they obviously sell 5, 10, 15 and even 20 piece orders. It just felt as if they try to nickel and dime you for everything. That being said, that night they deserved a 2-Star rating unfortunately. That being said, I plan on returning to try out these 911 wings and give them another chance because I honestly feel that it had something to do with the staff that day. They looked highly annoyed and uninterested in taking orders. The girl at the register spent most of the time there in the back talking to the cook who was obviously more interested in the convo rather than making sure the food was being prepared properly. I only saw those two workers so I'm assuming one was a manager and that being said, they definitely need to have a talk with that person. It makes the spot look bad. Especially me traveling all the way from Queens, NY and not being able to see what people were so fascinated with. As of right now, WingStop has this place beat. But I will be back to give a better review as long as the staff snaps out of it.

I've spent a lot of money here, but a hair in your food is flat out the grossest thing you can experience at any establishment. I have never heard of a place not refunding everything you spent (tax included) for the whole meal. I don't want anything from you and you messed up the whole meal with putting hair in my food. Give me my money back end of story. I don't want more hair infused food from you, get over it.What's worse is they didn't even refund my whole meal. I order chicken kabob with a salad, and mozzarella sticks. I had it delivered, and it was about $22. It a little pricey for delivery, but I was hungry.I got the delivery, and immediately has a mozzarella stick which was cold. I decided to try the salad, and the second bite, I bit into a hair and wanted to throw up.  I immediately threw the entire meal in the trash.  What normal human being wants to eat anything with someone's hair in it?!? Not sure what part of the body that came from and I didn't want to know. Eww, Listerine and a shower was required immediately.  Disgusting.  They don't wear hair nets here and the place doesn't look clean.  One of those places that you order delivery and don't every want to go inside bc you don't want to know what you have been eating.I called the store, and they told me that I needed to call delivery.com because they could not help me at all.  Delivery.com said they would call them. They called me back and said we could only get management to give me back $9.95 for the kabob.  Are u kidding me? I will never eat anything from that filthy establishment again.  It's probably going out of business due to the high rents. I certainly don't want the other $10 worth of a roach infested substance they call food.If you're hungry and considering calling, don't do it. It's not worth the risk of losing your money.

After placing the order the woman on the phone provided us the estimate to pick the food up in 10-15 minutes. Given that provided timeframe, we headed over to the establishment. *Flashforward* - us standing inside the Cluck U for over 35 minutes still waiting for our order to be prepared. I have no issues with a 35 minute wait, but that is not what we were told. If we were provided a correct waiting time we would have planned accordingly. We, very politely, went up to the clerk working at the counter and said ""Do you have a time frame on when our food will be ready? We've been waiting a very long time"". The clerk proceeded to say, not so nicely, ""I work the counter. You'll have to ask the kitchen, that's not my job"". In that moment, we said well how would we check with the kitchen, being that it is behind the register and patrons do not have access. The clerk proceeded to be more aggressive and say ""well you can come behind the counter and ask them yourself"". In an attempt to rationalize the situation with a clearly not rational clerk, we explained that does not make sense and he is the employee so he should follow up with the kitchen and see when customers food would be completed. Once again the clerk became angry stating that it is not his job and he just works the front counter and not the kitchen.As this exchange was happening, a kitchen employee did overhear and stop by to say they were packaging our food now. About two minutes later we were provided our to-go order and left with no apology and the bad taste in our mouths of a rude, disrespectful and unmotivated clerk.I would advise anyone looking for food in Hoboken to go elsewhere - the food will most likely be better anyway.",Cluck U Chicken,3.0 star rating,$,"Chicken, Wings,, Fast, Food,, Halal"

I also remember him bringing me a hot, wilted lettuce salad, with red onions, cucumbers, grilled chicken with buffalo sauce on it, which was just as gross tasting as it is to picture in your mind. The salad wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't saturated with buffalo sauce, and the lettuce wilted and the over abundance of red onions. Kudos on the mac and cheese though...

I thought ""well, it seems to be always packed so it MUST be good"". But then again, McDonalds is always full and we all know their food is trash. Why I went to Cluck you TWICE still boogles my mind. The chubby staff (usually LOUD Latino women in their early twenties) act like they are on stage and the customers are their fans/audience. They take a while to acknowledge you, the hungry ""fan"", as they laugh and entertain each other while you watch. They talk on their cell phones and catch up with their staff gossip before even asking you what you want. Finally  you get to order and the staff roll their eyes if you do not know their menu inside and out. They know little about the ""food"" they serve as I did ask a few questions about the chicken and they tilted their heads like a puppy does when he hears a new squeaky toy.Cons: Place is filthy, loud and the food is disgusting. Chicken was rubbery and tasteless both times I went. I will never make the same mistake. We are done. Cole slaw was warm and rubbery. I am thinking all of the food is made from same rubbery substance with different toppings on it. I TRIED to like this place. I just couldn't. Now I know why it is open until 4am - they NEED their customers to be drunk off their faces to tolerate their ""food"". TV is extremely loud. Be prepared to SCREAM your order to the staff. Pros: If you are a female and are trying to pick up a hungry, horney, (usually drunk) male, THIS is the place to do it. 99% of their prey, I mean, customers, are male. Another pro: it is open until 4am, as I said AND is not far from Path train so if you need rubbery hot food to soak up your alcohol, drag your gullible ass to Cluck You.

Usually when i go there i get to see one of their best employee Melissa. Shes great with customers and has a great smile on all the time. This asian employee gave us an attitude when she misunderstood my order and didn't make it a value pack. I was okay with it and asked if she can make it and she said yes but the whole time she had a bad attitude. Then she says anything else and when we said no thanks she replied okay good. I didn't like her attitude with us.. I work at a restaurant too I know what customer service is and i expect good customer service too.

The food quality is way better than most fried chicken places like Crown Fried Chicken(KFC and Popeyes don't even come close), and the price is the same. The chicken is breaded and seasoned just right,the  biscuits are actually tasty and buttered just right (as opposed to the stale buns most establishments try to pass off as biscuits), and the Nuclear Death blue cheese sauce is to die for. I think these bad reviews come from people who ordered the wrong things from the menu. It's a fried chicken venue; their specialty is going to be fried chicken, and thats what I recommend ordering. I ordered a 4 piece chicken for 5 dollars, and it did not disappoint. The pieces they served were big; it was hard for me to finish what I ordered. And as I mentioned, the biscuits are heavenly. I also ordered their mini bites to go, with the aforementioned blue cheese sauce. Absolutely delish, my whole family loved it when I brought it home.As for the store: the young lady at the counter was very polite, and took time to keep the store clean when she wasn't busy with customers. The level of professionalism was very high from someone who doesn't work for tips. Also, they give free refills, always a sign of a good and friendly establishment. The food does take quite a while to prepare for fast food(even if you're the only customer), but I'd like to think that they take their time to make my meal as delicious as possible.

Horrible customer experience.I took my mom here two weeks ago for a quick bite with my 5 month old daughter and after being appalled that i had to pay more and ring up a seperate order for some celery my mom asked for the cashier came out to chat with us and must have dropped 15 F bombs in the 10 minutes we sat there.  We couldn't even enjoy or so-so wings and gold plated celery.They need to rethink the business strategy here....Quick!,Cluck U Chicken,3.0 star rating,$,"Chicken, Wings,, Fast, Food,, Halal"

Mascot aside the wings here aren't so hot (taste-wise; spice-wise they are indeed hot). The sauces I've tried are just not that inspriring and the chicken itself does not impress. I think I'll give it one more try when the 9-11 sauce arrives. After all -- maybe never again.If you like wings, you should get your fat ass out of Hoboken, take the Path to 9th Street at go to 1849 (183 Bleecker St).

Once it arrived, the well-done burger I ordered was completely raw and disgusting. When I called back to see if they would replace it the phone girl was rude and had a terrible attitude. She put me on hold for a long time, and then when I asked for chicken (of lesser value) she got annoyed. The replacement order took another hour to arrive. Waiting an extra hour in addition to the previous one while I was hungry was irritating to say the least. When I called back to check on my order the phone girl was even more annoyed and responded, ""Your order left SWEETIE."" Then she hung up abruptly.Not once did they sorry.

140,vVTsaTwnhzx0CvLyYMJdPQ,Nicole L.,1.0 star rating,"I completely agree with Jeremy W. I got food delivered from here once, and once was all it took for me to say NEVER AGAIN!  I wanted to try some of everything, so we ordered the wings, and a few different types of wraps. Over the phone, they said that there was a $2 delivery fee, and we were like... well, already placed the order, and hopefully the food is good so we'll just pay it this time and if we like it, we can always eat in or pick up next time.When the delivery person actually arrived though, we looked at the bill and realized that they actually charged us $6 for delivery? I was like... WTF?!?! Turns out (and this was written down nicely on the receipt), they charge an extra dollar per ITEM. So, we got 4 different wraps (for about $5 or $6 each) and they charged an extra dollar PER WRAP. Finally, the delivery person told us that he didn't get anything from the delivery fee, and so we ended up tipping him as well.Overall, the hidden fees associated with this place is bull, and on principle alone, I would never go back.  Regarding the food - the wings were not memorable and only mediocre, and the wraps where OK tasting, but very small. Management must have some money grubbing issues, because they did not care one bit about retaining potential customers when we called in to complain about these hidden fees.",Cluck U Chicken,3.0 star rating,$,"Chicken, Wings,, Fast, Food,, Halal"

I've also had plenty of satisfying, well priced dinners from this establishment.  However, i subtracted a star because they make you pay extra for blue cheese.  Seriously?  it's a wings place!  That's like charging for ketchup at McDonalds.  And I do miss the mascot that used to greet everybody on Washington St. and at the PATH station during the grand opening period.  i remember he was out one Sat. night and we re-enacted the Family Guy chicken fight scene.",Cluck U Chicken,3.0 star rating,$,"Chicken, Wings,, Fast, Food,, Halal"

She told me to call Groupon for a refund. I told her I would wait while she called Groupon to have the program explained to her. She told me I could call the owner in the morning.

Because we never got that far.My friends and I got all excited to try the Cluck-U 911 challenge. We walked a mile to the restaurant. We shouted ""CLUCK-U CHALLENGE!"" all the way. We waited in line for 10-15 minutes and boldly declared to the cashier that we wanted the 911-challenge.Cluck-U lady: ""Oh, we don't have the challenge today.""me: ""What? Isn't that like your thing?""Cluck-U lady: ""We're out of the sauce.'me: ""oh..... ummmm oooookkkkkkkk.....""So we decide to get the ""Combo A"" which is 25 wings, 3 sides, and a 2-liter for like $27. We were disappointed about the challenge, but we were already at Cluck-U so we figured we'd try the food. We ordered and were asked how many cups we wanted. We said 6.The bill came out to $40. And we were like ""whaaaat? why?"" She charged for all the drinks! We pointed out that the combo comes with a 2-liter. First she denied it. Then she said they didn't carry 2-liters and that we ""shouldn't go by what the menu says.""OK. If this were like a mom-and-pop place, I might let that slide. But this is a Cluck-U. And it's a branch of Corporate. And it's only opened up pretty recently. And it's their freakin MENU. What do you mean I shouldn't go by what the menu says?Then the cashier lady (who by now has become an angry fire-breathing b*****) mutters some profanities under her breath and gets some meathead muscleman from the kitchen to come out and talk to us. I asked for the number of corporate so I could file a complaint because at this point the whole experience had just become ridiculous. He told me to ""look it up online"" and when I asked for their names, he told me to ""F*** Off!"" WHAAAAAT?!?!?!

This is a fast food establishment that is not as fast as it could be.One outright negative I will give is that the fried chicken, which I'm not sure they even offer anymore, was miserable. Virtually meatless and freezer burned breading garbage.The burgers have been pretty decent; they take longer to cook than my lunch break usually allows but proper planning can get around that. Boneless wings are very generously portioned and pretty enjoyable for chucks of breaded fried chicken matter. Mac and cheese is hit or miss depending on the cheese that day. I personally enjoy the Nuclear barbeque sauce; the Thermonuclear version tastes too medicinal/chemical for my taste; the heat level will likely leave you on the toilet for a good long time in the near future.Fountain drinks are all you can drink if you eat in the place. Delivery is available in the late hours and has been pretty prompt in my experience.Coleslaw hasn't sucked. Been meaning to try the rice and beans.I pretty much know what I'm getting myself into whenever I get food from here; this has often included quite a bit of indigestion.
