Large selection of everything you might want from an Italian shop and you shall find it here! I picked up some important sun dried tomatoes,  artichokes,  pasta,  raviolis,  and a sandwich! Had a taste of their homemade biscotti. Holy. Cow. I get it now. They are amazing when made fresh!!! I hear they make their own mozzarella too. Can't wait to go back. And, it's a calm place, and you don't feel like you have to rush to shop because there's a sandwich line crowding you. Go, now. Tell him you read the review on Yelp by the lady with the half Italian daughter who loved the biscotti!",Salerno Salumeria,4.5 star rating,$,Italian
1,z8bAxk2tya8aH8C9LYFe2A,Pearce D.,4.0 star rating,"Hard to beat a classic Italian deli with quality meats and reasonable prices. The Hoboken Italian delis have gotten a little pricey for what it's worth but for a foot long Italian hero, it's only $8.75 here. It may not be the best ever, but for it's a welcome stop in the Heights and I'll be back.",Salerno Salumeria,4.5 star rating,$,Italian
2,mBD90lgGK2n9KifP6rNnOA,Krista C.,5.0 star rating,Amazing Italian deli! They have the best Italian delicacies imported from Italy. I highly recommend stopping by if you're in the area. The owner is very nice and helpful too!,Salerno Salumeria,4.5 star rating,$,Italian
3,ZZELut-m0rSyivf8saCMKA,Mark S.,4.0 star rating,"I was starving so decided to come here late this afternoon.  Needed my Italian Deli fix.  This satisfied it.My sandwich was Prosciutto, Capicola, Fresh Mozzarella, Balsamic Vinegar on a whole wheat hero (hey, a guy has to eat somewhat healthy).  The only thing was the wheat bread was a little hard for my taste.  (hence the 4 stars)  Would like to go back and try the semolina bread next time.As previously stated there is no menu involved, so have an idea what you would like to order when going in.  The store is located on Central Avenue between Patterson and Congress in JC Heights.  I have been to so many Italian delis in Jersey City and Hoboken that they all start to look the same to me.  Just look for the hanging meats in the window and the red, white and green awning out front.  Try to come early when the bread is made fresh and make sure you bring your appetite!  The sandwiches are pretty large and reasonably priced (about $8).Mangia Bene!",Salerno Salumeria,4.5 star rating,$,Italian
4,OMJwlCECjqBtY3cCxhpqyw,Venus R.,4.0 star rating,"Very friendly owner, makes you feel at home when going into his store. Had a sandwich turkey with mozzarella with mayo and roasted red peppers. It was very fresh, my fiancé and I do not eat pork so our only option was turkey. We were totally fine with it since it is a salumeria. We do wish there were more options as far as toppings. That's why the 4 stars. But other then that the full service and experience is 5 stars",Salerno Salumeria,4.5 star rating,$,Italian
5,bRMMId5_iBORolRTP3zpGA,Mark B.,5.0 star rating,"The Heights' Italian delis are the best in JC- I'm probably being biased, but maybe I'm not ;)I thought Andrea's was the only amazing Italian deli on Central, until I stepped into Salerno's.  I ordered a prosciutto, mozzarella and sundried tomato sandwich with olive oil and balsamic, and it was delicious! The mozzarella was soft and creamy and the prosciutto was what you expect from a place like this: delicate, savory, pork fatty and incredible.The owner is a kind Italian gentleman, and he is happy to accommodate your request! This is a classic JC business that needs to survive.Please go support this amazing Heights business!!",Salerno Salumeria,4.5 star rating,$,Italian

8,T69btMBaaD76jlpK0Pznmg,Gerard J.,5.0 star rating,"I love this place. This is the most authentic Italian deli in JC Heights. I like the owner. He is a very nice, old school Italian. He makes his own mozzarella, which tastes very good. The prosciutto is very fresh, and he also carries a lot of specialty Italian foods that you cannot find any place else, and his prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend giving them a try.",Salerno Salumeria,4.5 star rating,$,Italian
9,Hhvjy43I9JOAl81EE-CU1Q,Andrew L.,5.0 star rating,"I have to say I was impressed with this place. A small store with a lot to offer. No menu , no problem. When you walk into an old school Italian deli that takes pride in what they serve to the customer this is the place. We all know what we would like to eat coming to an Italian deli. Who wants, prosciutto and fresh mozzarella on fresh Italian bread. Soppressata and sharp provolone. Mortadella . Check out the meats. Ask what they have. They will make you anything you want. Better than a menu. If your not sure, they will kindly suggest. The fresh mozzarella is made everyday and does not last long. Sells out fast. Some of the best I have had. I stopped in the first time and had ham,salami,soppressata,fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers and olive oil on a full loaf of semolina bread. Co worker and I split. Best sandwich I've had. As I'm eating it I'm saying this is how it's supposed to taste. Co worker grew up in a family owned Italian deli business and said was best sandwich since his pops store. They also sell imported goods. Selections of pasta,espresso,olives,peppers,marinated mushrooms and eggplant. I talked to the owner"" nice guy"" they will cater. Ask them what you would like and most likely they will accommodate. No menu again no problem. Don't let that keep you from asking. Also have homemade sauce,meat sauce,eggplant,lasagna,meatballs  and some ravioli and other specialties. I returned the next day, had to have another sandwich. I had the prosciutto with fresh mozzarella  with olive oil ,roasted peppers salt pepper and oregano. Wow again. Delicious. There are no seats inside but doesn't matter. I left with ham salami and sliced soppressata  with all the fresh mozzarella he had,three loafs of bread stuffed green olives and some espresso. Let's just say I cannot wait to get back. If you want to make an order, call ahead for the mozzarella and anything else you would like . It will be ready when you arrive. I cannot wait to go back and enjoy all these specialties!  Stop in.",Salerno Salumeria,4.5 star rating,$,Italian
