You wait on a long line to order your food then they give you a ticket and you get on another line to encounter a large amount of people crowding the counter top area where you have to give the guys the ticket and they make your food. Â The first time I went there it was really good. Then, the second time I went there the Nopal was so slimy it slipped out of the taco and didn't taste right. Consistency is obviously an issue. I would say its worth it if its your first time other than that, there is limited seating and i think they should put two soft taco shells around the taco so all of the things inside don't slip out..

It's never been my number one (I find it a little too soupy), but finding myself in the area, this was an easy pick for lunch.Around noon, the line wasn't bad at all and took under 5 minutes. I did a chicken on corn and a nopal on flour for a combined ~$7. $5 minimum for credit card. No seating, so stand where you get the tacos or try to steal some space away from other vendors. You'll need a counter or table as these get a little messy. If you get them ""with everything,"" you really won't need any of the garnishes, as I think it's a good amount of spice and sauce. However, grab some radish for a palate cleanser when you're done.The chicken on corn was magnificent. Great flavor, tender, tasty. I'm from Houston, know my tacos, yadda yadda, and this is great stuff. The corn tortilla was a must-order as it held up to the messiness.Nopal was more of a mixed bag. It was slightly overcooked and slimy, and the tortilla completely fell apart by the end. The taste was also a bit one dimensional and jalapeno-y, but you'll get that with nopal. Doable if you're vegetarian but if not, try another meat.Recommended overall and a fun experience. Los Mariscos will be my next Chelsea Market destination.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

That being said once I found it I was very happy. It's counter ordering so take out style. You put your order in then go give them cooks a little detail on what you want inside your taco. They hand you your order and then you chow down. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars has nothing to do with the food or service but that there is not really anywhere to seat down and enjoy your food(but that is more of an issue of the Chelsea market ).Now to get to the food the tacos were out of this world or should I say straight from Mexico.

However, after trying the grilled cactus taco, I would say to stick to the meat. The grilled cactus was very sour tasting and personally not to my liking.

Amazing decision from my part to go to Los Tacos, which is right across from Mokbar. There are four kinds of tacos (carne asada, chicken, pork and cactus) and the price ranges from $3.25 to $3.75.

Once you order with the counter, you are sent to the back and are motioned by people who take your receipt and make the tacos fresh and right in front of you.

I was also impressed with how quickly the line moved despite being fairly long and how quickly we got our food.

(he said for these little one). The price aren't expensive, it's worth it every penny because it's that good which right now I'm craving for them right now.

The adobada is the most popular and it's also my favorite!! Spicy marinated pork on a tortilla with chopped cilantro, green sauce, onions, and topped with pineapple slices. Amazing flavor. The carne asada had a surprising charcoal-grilled taste that I also enjoyed.The waiting area is horrible and obviously not well thought out. After ordering and paying for your tacos, you are given a receipt to stand in another line (or more like a crowd) at a bar to hand off to a chef so he can make your order. Along this same bar has extra sauces and toppings (lime, pico de gallo, peppers, etc.) which are extremely hard to get to due to the line of people waiting to get their tacos made.Having come from Texas (where our tacos are around $1.50 each), paying $3.50 per taco is something I probably wouldn't do again.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

I've spent most of my time in the mid Atlantic or New York City. These are the best tacos I've ever had. I've had a lot of tacos in my life, but mainly in regions that aren't really known for them. Los tacos loads your corn soft shells with juicy delicious meat cooked to perfection. Their vegetables taste fresh and their salsas actually taste good and the spicy ones are actually spicy (take note everyone else). What it comes down to is this: I'll travel an absurd amount of time to their annoying location in Chelsea market to fulfill my taco craving.Long lines lead to this casual stand looking spot, where there is only standing tables to eat at. But the people behind the counter are veterans at moving the line along and preparing your food ASAP. And despite the demand, the tacos are priced like most tacos around the city. You just can't beat Los Tacos No 1. Atmosphere: 5/5 (casual standing - feels authentic)Food: 5/5 (I want to give a 6)Service: 5/5 Value: 5/5",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

You aaalllready know it's as good as I'm about to tell you it is! Los Tacos No. 1 named their taco shop being hopeful and confident but now they are, in fact, No. 1 in NYC. If you go on the weekend, yes it will probably be busy and you'll have to wait in line but delicious tacos wait for you at the end of that line. There's a counter where you take your ticket for your tacos to be made and picked up and you can totally eat there but be prepared for random strangers reaching over you for all of the limes, radishes, etc. I don't mind because it takes maybe 5 minutes to eat 2-3 tacos. If you want to preserve your personal bubble, there's spots and tables scattered throughout the market where you can enjoy your food.The most important thing is that these tacos are damn good. I really like the carne asada and adobada tacos. When you give them your ticket, tell them if you want flour or corn and which toppings (onion, cilantro, avocado sauce). Live a little and get everything on it. Their service is nice and quick! The second time I visited I tried the fried quesadilla. Super guilty but soooo good.

Located in Chelsea Market, this place gets busy and I mean very busy. It's located in one of the sub locations with several restaurants and this one has a line all the way to the main area. Food is cheap, around $3-5 an item. However, the food is not huge so definitely order several and order a variety. Very cool that you take your order then hand it to one of the chefs who pump out the order in less than a few seconds they work so quick. Something I did have was a little spicy for my liking, but I'm not sure what it came from because I did not ass spicy salsa or anything. Think there just might be some spice on the chicken or meat but wasn't anything crazy that I couldn't handle. You get to add your own salsa to the items that's served near the pick up area. There is sadly really no where to seat so you need to either eat at the counter where you picked up the food or find somewhere else to eat in Chelsea market.All in all, authentic Mexican food at a good price that is served fast!",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

The cheese tortilla is bigger than the flour or corn tortillas so I was satisfied with just one taco. With the price and quality of food, this place is so dang good even for New York standards. Love how they have self-serve choices when it comes to spice. I put a hefty amount of medium spice on and a little bit of mild spice. The mild spice was essentially just tomatoes and a little pepper, and I regretted putting it on there because the tomatoes were a little cold. The taco was one of the messiest things I've ever eaten, but also easily one of the best tacos I've ever had. I gave the atmosphere a high rating because it's in Chelsea Market, so even though it's a taco place, it feels quite posh. Â Los Tacos itself doesn't really have seating (just some standing eating space) so you may have to walk around a little to find seating. My friend and I sat at the bar area by Very Fresh Noodles. The workers certainly aren't very peppy because they're always swamped with customers, but you can tell they're working at top speed and working to expedite the line.

The adobada is the most popular and it's also my favorite!! Spicy marinated pork on a tortilla with chopped cilantro, green sauce, onions, and topped with pineapple slices. Amazing flavor. The carne asada had a surprising charcoal-grilled taste that I also enjoyed.The waiting area is horrible and obviously not well thought out. After ordering and paying for your tacos, you are given a receipt to stand in another line (or more like a crowd) at a bar to hand off to a chef so he can make your order. Along this same bar has extra sauces and toppings (lime, pico de gallo, peppers, etc.) which are extremely hard to get to due to the line of people waiting to get their tacos made.Having come from Texas (where our tacos are around $1.50 each), paying $3.50 per taco is something I probably wouldn't do again.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

I ordered the carne asada, nopal and adobada tacos.Nopal (cactus) : it was good BUT honestly it has the same texture and color, lacks in taste as green bell peppers so I would rather SAVE any money and not get a nopal taco unless authentically it is in Mexican cuisine to have Nopal cactus tacos so I don't mind that. But PASSDon't sleep on the carne asada taco and the adobada tacos. CORN TORTILLAS VS FLOUR? I ordered corn tortillas and I was disappointed by the lack of corn flavor.

I've spent most of my time in the mid Atlantic or New York City. These are the best tacos I've ever had. I've had a lot of tacos in my life, but mainly in regions that aren't really known for them. Los tacos loads your corn soft shells with juicy delicious meat cooked to perfection. Their vegetables taste fresh and their salsas actually taste good and the spicy ones are actually spicy (take note everyone else). What it comes down to is this: I'll travel an absurd amount of time to their annoying location in Chelsea market to fulfill my taco craving.Long lines lead to this casual stand looking spot, where there is only standing tables to eat at. But the people behind the counter are veterans at moving the line along and preparing your food ASAP. And despite the demand, the tacos are priced like most tacos around the city.

You aaalllready know it's as good as I'm about to tell you it is! Los Tacos No. 1 named their taco shop being hopeful and confident but now they are, in fact, No. 1 in NYC. If you go on the weekend, yes it will probably be busy and you'll have to wait in line but delicious tacos wait for you at the end of that line. There's a counter where you take your ticket for your tacos to be made and picked up and you can totally eat there but be prepared for random strangers reaching over you for all of the limes, radishes, etc. I don't mind because it takes maybe 5 minutes to eat 2-3 tacos. If you want to preserve your personal bubble, there's spots and tables scattered throughout the market where you can enjoy your food.The most important thing is that these tacos are damn good. I really like the carne asada and adobada tacos. When you give them your ticket, tell them if you want flour or corn and which toppings (onion, cilantro, avocado sauce). Live a little and get everything on it. Their service is nice and quick! The second time I visited I tried the fried quesadilla. Super guilty but soooo good.

Located in Chelsea Market, this place gets busy and I mean very busy. It's located in one of the sub locations with several restaurants and this one has a line all the way to the main area. Food is cheap, around $3-5 an item. However, the food is not huge so definitely order several and order a variety. Very cool that you take your order then hand it to one of the chefs who pump out the order in less than a few seconds they work so quick. Something I did have was a little spicy for my liking, but I'm not sure what it came from because I did not ass spicy salsa or anything. Think there just might be some spice on the chicken or meat but wasn't anything crazy that I couldn't handle. You get to add your own salsa to the items that's served near the pick up area. There is sadly really no where to seat so you need to either eat at the counter where you picked up the food or find somewhere else to eat in Chelsea market.All in all, authentic Mexican food at a good price that is served fast!",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

Also get the cheese tortilla instead of flour or corn (it does cost extra though).Food: 4 Â  Taste- 5 Â  Presentation- 3.5Atmosphere/Aesthetic: 4.5Service- 4.5Price/Value- 4.5I got the chicken taco (pollo asado) with cheese tortilla substitute and it came out to $5.75. The cheese tortilla is bigger than the flour or corn tortillas so I was satisfied with just one taco. With the price and quality of food, this place is so dang good even for New York standards. Love how they have self-serve choices when it comes to spice. I put a hefty amount of medium spice on and a little bit of mild spice. The mild spice was essentially just tomatoes and a little pepper, and I regretted putting it on there because the tomatoes were a little cold. The taco was one of the messiest things I've ever eaten, but also easily one of the best tacos I've ever had. I gave the atmosphere a high rating because it's in Chelsea Market, so even though it's a taco place, it feels quite posh. Â Los Tacos itself doesn't really have seating (just some standing eating space) so you may have to walk around a little to find seating. My friend and I sat at the bar area by Very Fresh Noodles. The workers certainly aren't very peppy because they're always swamped with customers, but you can tell they're working at top speed and working to expedite the line. I've never seen people make quality tacos so quickly. The line looked really long, but it goes quickly. I only waited about 12 minutes to order and get my food. Definitely come here.

I visited this place last year and I really enjoyed their Adobada tacos, so I wanted my friend to try it since it was his first time in NYC. We ordered two tacos which were pretty pricey, but were pretty big, so no complaints.While eating the taco, it brought back 2017 memories of when I first consumed this goodness.

45,u78CMrsEjky8Ryr3D-oWuQ,Taiba Sheerin A.,4.0 star rating,"It's located at Chelsea Market, and had a huge rush compared to any other place at the market. After eating their tacos, I understand the craze! I got chicken tacos on flour tortilla. You can see the chefs grilling up the meat and tortillas. The guy heated our tortilla and slapped on the ingredients (they ask you if you want onions, cilantro, tomatoes) and meat. They have a self-serve station consisting of fresh cut lime wedges, salsa, hot sauce, red chillis, and cut radishes. You can add these to your plate per your liking. The tacos tasted great - very authentic, the chicken was cooked well, and the salsa and hot sauce gave the taco a great kick. I squeezed some fresh lime on the taco and took a bite of the red chilli with each bite of taco. However, you have to be able to navigate through the rush. You first order and pay, then move left with your ticket and give it to the cooks. You wait there until the cook prepares and gives you your oder, when you can move on to the condiments/toppings area to fill your plate. You will encounter some people standing in areas they shouldn't be in. For example, a girl was waiting in front of the condiments for a loong time waiting for her order and blocking people from getting to that section. But I guess if you have lived in NY you must be good at navigating through such situations anyways. The reason why I took off one star - One of the employees who was cleaning the counter area where open ingredients were kept, was spraying the disinfectant really close to the open bowls of lime, salsa, etc. While I had my plate on the counter too, she sprayed really close to it ( I want to believe none of it went on my taco but it may have ).",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

Look up El Fogon in Mexico, El Flamin Taco in Los Angeles, and of course Los Tacos #1; they are all cooked the same way. This is true Al Pastor/Adobada style and don't forget the pineapple!

69,pHx3OKHJI9RoVTwqAIYuog,Neel A.,5.0 star rating,"Always on the hunt for great tacos, Los Tacos No. 1 kept coming up in my google searches for the best tacos in new york city. Located inside Chelsea Market, this place had a line even at 3pm on a weekday so I knew there had to be something special. And I was not mistaken.I ordered pork, chicken and beef tacos (~$3.50 per taco). You hand your receipt order to the cook over the counter and watch em go to work. Fresh cut meat and all the toppings your heart desires. The taste is phenomenal and there are two key reasons - 1) The meat - sooooo juicy, so fresh, so hot, it just melts in your mouth 2) Magic Guacamole sauce - this isn't traditional guacamole, it's more of a thinner consistency but it's loaded with bright lime acidic flavors that balances the meat perfectly. I also appreciated the self serve toppings (salsas, limes and radishes) that you can add yourself. The tacos are so good as is, I wouldn't dilute the flavor by adding too many toppings. Los Tacos No. 1, I love you *kisses lips*. I will definitely be back!",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

Los Tacos No. 1 is located inside of Chelsea Market so for those who have never been here, please note this!Los Tacos No. 1 is known for their gracious tacos and since it was a Tuesday, it was the perfect day to order tacos from them for Taco Tuesdays! The tacos were indeed delicious- the steak being the most favorite with corn tortilla. My husband and I also had the chicken and pork taco along with the chicken quesadilla. Still, the steak one rings the best. If you're looking to take out, make sure that the staff member making your tacos know that. They put an aluminum foil over it. As for the salsa, they have mild, medium and spicy out on display for self-serve. I'm not sure how sanitary this is since it is flu season and everyone is dipping and diving in there. But will I be back? Yes, of course. The only improvements I would suggest is to offer a better way to pack ""take out,"" especially for those traveling far and to offer already pre-packed salsa so one doesn't have to be holding up the line for the self-serve salsa, trying to package everything.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

My standards have been set very high and in all honesty if it isn't Arizona California or MEXICO most other places disappoint with authentic Mexican food. Los Tacos #1 definitely changed my perceptions of NYC Mexican food. The street tacos were pricey for the size but I guess it's the markup (each taco avg $3.25-$3.75). Carne asada, pollo, pork and veggie - pro they come with everything ""con todo"" guac cheese onions cilantro pico. There are different levels of spicy salsas available at the side wall.

Plus the slices of fresh pineapple really push it over the edge and take it to next level taco heaven. Seriously salivating just thinking about it! The only major difference between Los Tacos and my fave LA taco places is the price. But really, that's hard to compare since Los Tacos is located in such a hot NYC neighborhood where tacos are scarce (so demand wayyy exceeds supply) versus in LA where there are just so many cheap taco options that price competition is fierce.

Sure the tacos are pricy if compared to all the boroughs or food trucks, but as compared to some other taco places in this particular neighborhood this is actually pretty good (some restaurants in this area charge a lot just for sauce... see my previous reviews for details). For tacos; they have carne asada (grilled steak), chicken, cactus, and adobada Â (marinated pork). Â Step 3) give your receipt to the kitchen ( try to remember your order. They ask if you want flour or corn tortillas. Also you can ask for everything on it which can include Â guac (no extra charge). Also tell them if you want a to go order or not. The kitchen later calls out your order and you take it. Step 4) after you get your food, go to the middle of the counter to the sauce station. Grab a container or a few containers and fill them with sauces; pico de Gallo, and multiple types of hot sauce. You can also grab some lime wedges and napkins. The nice part is you can get however much sauce or combination of sauces as you want.I tried both the steak and the pork. The tacos were juicy and flavorful. They are a small size so you will need several.

I refused to try anything else because the tacos were calling my name, lol.-By the time I came to order, there was a large crowd gathering by the counter but it was moving at a good pace. There is a large board on the side with their menu and pricing. Tacos range from $3.25-$3.75 and Quesadillas, Chips with Salsa/Guacamole and Sodas are also sold here. -I went with the popular Carne Asada and Pollo, both on a flour tortilla. The carne asada taco was a bit on the chewy side, almost a medium done. Plus, it lacked flavor even with the salsa and guacamole on top. My favorite was pollo asado :-) Â (grilled chicken) So juicy, flavorful and mouth watering deliciously good! The chicken was grilled perfectly, the taco was soft and fresh and one chicken taco was not enough :o) One bite in and it was over before I could relish the spicy and mouth watering flavors! Yo quiero mÃ¡s! I want more! They serve your tacos on a small cake size plate and it's to go, as I didn't see any seating. Â The carne asada tacos weren't my thing because I'm not a fan of beef and I just wanted to give it a try. Next time I know I'm going for the chicken again and will try it on the corn tacos.

Â I am quite the lover of Mexican food including tacos, tostadas, etc so naturally if I'm going to be in Chelsea Market I'm not going to pass the opportunity to have a treat especially when it comes so highly rated.The concept is quite simple, you order what you want and how many you want and after you pay you get a paper ticket. Â You give that ticket to one of the guys behind the counter and let them do their thing. Â Because I wanted to try many things while in Chelsea Market I didn't go crazy on the ordering here. Â All I ordered was one chicken tostada and one carne asada tostada. Â At that point I was asked if I wanted flour or corn and since I prefer corn I went with that. Â The guys behind the counter do their magic and hand over the goods and on the counter in front of you are a variety of ways to dress your assembly line made creation wither with hot peppers, salsa, etc. Â I think I saw about 5 choices or so. Â At that point find a place to eat. Â They don't seem to have seating and the seating that was in this area belongs to the place next door (their across the aisle neighbor). Â Just outside the immediate area in the common walkway there are places to eat whether standing or seating in the Market. Â It's safe to say these did not last very long as they were oh so good. Â The meat was just amazing on each and I have to say I could easily inhale a half dozen of these without blinking they are that good. Â If it weren't for me trying to pace myself for more options at the market I could have and would have given into my greed and went all in on more. Â Honestly at that point price would also be no object. Â These run at around 4 bucks a shot so they're not inexpensive if you were to say order a half dozen just for yourself.

Since we were already passing through Chelsea Market, we decided to give it a try.Atmosphere:The line was very long on a Saturday afternoon, as expected, but it went by pretty quickly. It's made for fast, casual dining, so there were no seats or anything like that. Most people just ate while standing by the counter. The decor was fun, colorful, and looked nice!Food:We both ordered carne asada tacos on corn tortillas. I was excited to see that they were very generous with the amount of meat in the tacos. I went with some simple toppings and only sprinkled some fresh lime juice on mine, but that first bite was super delicious. The tortilla was warm, the onions added some crunch, the cilantro added flavor, and the meat was tender and tasty. (My boyfriend isn't a huge fan of cilantro, but even he said that they added the perfect amount to compliment the flavor of the meat.) My boyfriend ended up getting the guac and some salsa on his, and he was very pleased with both as well.I've tried a lot of tacos, including some while visiting Mexico, and these ones are pretty authentic and yummy in taste, but they are super small in size, which was a little disappointing.Price:The major downside to this place was definitely the price. $4 seems pretty cheap on the surface, but the tacos are still basically bite-sized. I'd probably need to eat around 5 or 6 of them to actually get full, which would cost me over $20.

It was so good I literally went two or three times during my short stay. This is a fast casual dining restaurant with no seats, most people eat by the counter. You order at the cashier's and then you are given a ticket which you then hand to the line workers. They make the tacos insanely fast and they are generous with the meat. The first time I went I ordered one Pollo asado taco and one carne asada taco. The first bite was phenomenal, the corn tortillas are warm and the meat is seasoned so perfectly. As a big fan of Mexican food I can say these are the best tacos I've ever had anywhere. After eating the two I ordered one more of each and enjoyed every bite. I had to hold back from getting more haha. I will warn you the avocado salsa Verde is VERY spicy. Keep that in mind if you are sensitive to spicyness.Overall this is a must try in NYC city if you want some delicious food. I could not get enough of this place after my first visit so I literally went out of my way to come back again the next day.

After picking up your tacos, I recommend the ""spicy"" sauce which is not only hot but also contains a ton of flavor.PRICE(3/5)Even with how good the food was, paying $3.75 for a taco is pretty steep in my opinion.New York isn't known for Mexican food, but this place will change your mind.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

The significant other agreed but didn't like how one small taco was $3.75.He ordered the carne asada taco, which is grilled steak. It was pretty tasty and filled to capacity. He mentioned how it was good, but would prefer to taste more of the meat versus filling it with fluff ingredients. I liked it as it. :)So if you get the especial quesadilla then you're getting a fried one. The first menu we encountered didn't have this specification that it was fried. Only after paying and staying in front of the cook line that you see a more in-depth menu.Needless to say, that thing was superb. It was filled with cheese, guacamole (I think), and all sorts of other stuff. Yeah. That quesadilla was oily, but it's super different imo and worth at least a try if you haven't before. There's also a cactus taco if you haven't had one of those. There's a line here so if you're hungry, plan ahead. Even after paying, you sort of stand in another area/line and wait for the cooks to ask for your order sheet. Los Tacos No. 1 is located inside of Chelsea Market.

It is definitely the best taco I have ever had. The flavor was on point. It came with a pineapple salsa that paired so well. I recommend trying the adobada, hands down.

Wait in line, place your order, and pay, hand your ticket off to a guy behind the next counter, and your order should come out less than five minutes later. While constantly slammed with customers, the staff are as friendly as can be, and can customize your tacos on the fly. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?The tacos at Los Tacos No.1 are $3.00 a pop or $3.75 for carne asada, and while the tacos themselves are on the smaller side, they're absolutely packed with goodies. Sure, you've got the meats onions, cilantro, and guac, but peripheral salsas and other goodies like pineapple slices up the value here tremendously. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?Absolutely excellent, and that didn't come as a surprise given you're watching these tacos made start to finish right in front of your eyes.Freshly crafted tortillas house fresh and flavorful meats that are made all the better thanks to the onions and cilantro, salsas, and meat specific add ons. While I only ordered two (Adobada (pork) and Carne Asada), I immediately wished I'd ordered more. Well done indeed. Dual Stars Granted.

I am usually full with two quesadillas and you can add pico de gallo and mild/spicy sauces if you want. Every time I come it's a really long line but the line moves quickly. But yesterday, I came on a Wednesday night and there was no line! AND Chelsea Market was actually walkable (no tourists)! I think the trick is - don't go on weekends. I think the ordering system is a little confusing and hectic but it works and they are efficient. They give you a receipt after you order and you move down and give your receipt to the people making the tacos, they ask what you want on it. I ask for everything except the salsa because it's spicy. Then you can add pico de gallo or salsas, the green one is spicier I believe. I always get the chicken quesadilla because it's SOO good. The pork quesadilla is also really good but a bit heavy. The nopal is cactus and the texture tastes like okra, personally I don't like it because that sliminess of okra and cactus is an acquired taste. I have not tried the beef taco.You can see them making the tortilla. They put a ball of dough on this tortilla squishing thingy that looks like a waffle maker, and it squishes out a really delicious tortilla.

The tortillas are freshly made so it's pillowy and pliable enough to soak up the savory juices. The marinated pork is super moist and flavorful whilst the pineapple makes the perfect accompaniment. Wash it down with their refreshing and creamy horchata while you're at it. Don't let the lines deter you away since the turn over rate is quick. Also, note that you have to hand your receipt over to the counter to place your order. There isn't any type of seating except for a meniscus counter space located next to the condiment area.

I have been wanting to come here forever with its crazy number of positive reviews and at last my dream has come true. I ordered the carne asada, adobada and nopal tacos on corn tortilla. The turnaround of them serving the food out was quick. Just find a spot in Chelsea market and you got yourself a taco meal!The Adobada was my favorite. The pork was super tender, juicy, well marinated with that adobo flavor. It was huge in portion but fortunately the corn tortilla was strong enough to hold everything. So good!!! I would reorder that 100%. Their carne asada was also very good. Different in flavor balance compared to the adobada. The adobada was heavy in seasoning. The carne asada was more subtle and light I felt, really highlighting the beef. Really good as well. The nopal was an experiment for me because I wanted to try the cactus. It was interesting. I like meats in my taco better but for what it was, it was good. The cactus kind of had the consistency of okra or aloe and had a sour taste to it. I wouldn't personally order it again but a good try nonetheless. There are sauces and limes on the side so you can pile on as much extra salsas and acid as you want.I also got their horchata, rice milk drink. It went down nicely with the tacos, with a good hit of cinnamon in it. Overall, so good for a quick, delicious meal!

I got the first three which were chicken, pork, and steak on corn tortillas. Super easy, quick service, and a serve yourself bar for the limes and three different sauce options (mild medium and spicy). I think I might've added too much sauce to the pork tacos because it was too hot for me to decently taste what was in it. The other two were delicious, filled with the right ratio of meat versus other filling and topped with guac. For 6 tacos and a beverage the total was under $30. The card minimum is $5. Next time I come I'll go easy on the sauce and try tasting the other flavors and the guac and chips to give this place a more thorough review.

The size of the tacos are kind of small so you will need at least 2 or 3 to actually fill you up. Everything including the salsa is freshly made and everyone that worked there was very nice.

I patiently waited in the line that actually moved fairly quickly and I ordered one steak taco and one chicken quesadilla. One thing you have to do is get your receipt and give it to the chef. I didn't know this so I was waiting for the longest time for my food! UghAnyway, whatever... waited my time, got my food, poured like 1/3 of all the tomatoes in the bin they had onto my tacos. Also smothered my tacos in the mild sauce they had. Went outside, grabbed a spot and took a bite... wow. It was pretty amazing, and I don't even like tacos! I ended up devouring my two tacos in like 5 minutes and was trying to figure out what had just happened. After taking a moment to breakdown the flavors, one of the things I appreciated most about this taco was the thin flour layer of the taco... not to mention that the ingredients meshed well together.

That being said, it only took me a minute to scarf down the 2 tacos I got. Tacos will run you under $4. Steak ones are $3.75 and others are $3.50. I got the chicken and abodaba one. Amazing. So succulent and moist. Just amazing. I can't really say more than that. Now, I'm reluctant to say this part, as I feel that more people will start swarming here, and I already have plans to come back many more times this year, until I start having to getting in shape for summer. There's a secret menu item. You can get any of these tacos in a queso shell, which in essence is a fried cheese shell. That's right, you heard it from me, the shell is made out of solely fried cheese. It is heavenly. A bit on the salty side, but that imperfection makes it perfect, you know?

Not really..but maaaaybe #2 or #3 which is still pretty darn good.. but why? pls hear me out..On a sunny yet chilly/windy Sunday I managed to beat out the laziness and venture to downtown Manhattan Meatpacking District area. The taco place is located pretty deep inside the Chelsea Market. There was a line while I was there at around 12 pm-ish (which is the norm for most popular places NYC - so I expect no less) but fortunately the line moved pretty quickly.So, once it is your turn, choose what you want and pay ahead at the register. Then he would give you a ticket number/receipt. Don't lose it! I was a panicking for a bit since I did not realize this workflow when I asked the cook next door where my order was, and he was just asking me where my receipt was. I did not remember whether the cash register guy instructed me to give the receipt to the cookers on the next section.I luckily found the receipt. Then the cook did my orders quickly and gave me my food. And be mindful, once you get the food, just get out of the way to give space to others waiting for the food. Space is at a premium at NYC, and unfortunately this also applies here. Also, you might need to just enjoy the food somewhere/while walking since no visible seats.For my meal I got:1. Nopales tacos - very interesting cactus texture (it's my 1st time trying!) - has a pretty tangy flavor to it2. Carne Asada tacos - well seasoned, comes with guacamole - small portion (feels like just 1 bite)3. Jamaica drink - very light, refreshing and fruity. Not too sweet.My order was totaled at $11.5 for a total of 2 bite tacos (each taco feels like a bite) and a medium sized drink. Very good food but I can hear my wallet, stomach and mind mildly protesting not to pay those amount of money and give the fullest credit to Los tacos no 1.

Thank goodness for Los Tacos! Located in Chelsea Market, Los Tacos is tucked away in the corner. Their menu is short and simple - four different taco fillings and the option to get it in a taco, quesadilla, or on a plate. You place your order and pay with the cashier then take your receipt to the counter to hand to one of the guys in the back. There you can decide if you want it on a flour or corn tortilla (always corn!). They also have a ""secret"" cheese shell, but be sure to tell your cashier before you hand your ticket to the guys assembling. My favorites are the carne asada and the adobada. I always have to get one of each. The adobado comes with a couple of slices of grilled pineapple. Yum! I love that they not only top your tacos with guac, but that they have a variety of salsas, limes, chilies, and radishes along the counter to let you further customize your tacos. Â Overall, Los Tacos is one place you have to visit if you're in the area. The line can get long but it moves pretty quickly.

It might seem a bit pricey for a taco ($3.50 for chicken, and $3.75 for steak) but don't underestimate the amount they give you or what the small piece of corn/flour tortilla can hold. They do fill it up and you can add on the extra good stuff after they give you your tacos. But before that you have to get on the line and order. You get a receipt, which you give one of the guys behind the counter for them to start cooking up your order. You seriously have to squeeze your way through everyone crowding around the counter to get that piece of paper to the guy. They ask if you want corn or flour tortilla and spicy or not. Tell them or forever hold your peace. After adding whatever you want on top and remember to get your limes. Then you can dig in! I don't know about you, but I can down these tacos in like three bites for each taco. And no regrets for getting hands dirty and looking like a mess because they definitely satisfy. And it will leaving you wanting more but you will then see the long line and you'll tell yourself that's all you need but deep down inside you want a few more. Or at least that's me.

We got one pollo asado, one carne asada, and two adobada tacos. I really can't argue with all the people that say the adobada is the single best taco in the city -- it is so good, really spicy, and just kind of perfect.

Eh...With only four types of tacos on the menu (Carne Asada, Pollo Asada, Nopal, and Adobada), Los Tacos definitely specializes in what they do best. Sure, there are some other options on the menu, like quesadillas, chips & salsa, and some plates, but the tacos are a must-have. You order at a register, and are presented with a ticket which you then give to one of the chefs on the line. They may or may not ask you about your preferences - I was asked if I wanted everything on the tacos, to which I replied yes, but I wasn't asked whether I wanted corn or flour, which I didn't even know was an option until the next person in line was asked (the default is corn, by the way). The tacos come with all sorts of goodies on top, and the meat was some of the most tender and flavorful I've ever had. The Adobada absolutely melted in my mouth. The salsa bar presents three options, ranging from a very mild pico to a pretty hot red salsa, and there are plenty of fresh limes for the taking. A fourth type of salsa came with the chips that I ordered, which I thought was delicious and packed a pretty solid kick. Tacos will run you about $3.50-$3.75 a piece, and chips were another $3.50 I believe, which I thought was overpriced for the small bag I got. Three tacos will fill you up if you're hungry, two if you're not. Don't get me wrong, the tacos were REALLY good (4.5 stars). Unfortunately I just came with obscenely high expectations. The main curse for Los Tacos is that its location in Chelsea market is just terrible. There's absolutely no seating and eating your tacos on a cramped bench in the middle of the market really kills the whole experience.

It's located in the middle of Chelsea market and the line was pretty long but moved quickly. I showed the cashier a pic of something delicious looking posted on Yelp and she said it's a special quesadilla. I had it with steak and a pork taco with sorrel (called Jamaica here) to wash it down. I had it with everything and added salsa and some type of sauce and fresh lime. It was absolutely amazing. I was wearing a waist trainer so it by the time I was done I was full. My friend on the other hand went back and ordered two more. I did not love her nopal. I've never had it and while it was flavorful it reminded me of sautÃ©ed peppers. The quesadilla is fried and overstuffed with cheese and the steak is cooked to absolute perfection and seasoned well. The pork taco is also cooked and seasoned to perfection and the pineapple is the perfect balance of sweet to the spice. Most places double the tortilla but they only give you one so it's a bit messy to eat. The tacos are a bit smaller than I'm used to. That's ok though because the taste more than makes up for it.

I decided to get the carne asada and pollo asada tacos on corn tortillas with everything on it. As soon as you order, you get a ticket and bring it up to the guys that make the tacos. They made everything so quickly and my mouth was immediately watering. You also have the option of adding different salsas and limes. I was amazed as soon as I bit it the taco. There was so much flavor and the meat was cooked to perfection. I loved that you could see they slow cooked the beef. It was definitely worth it! The chicken was also pretty good.

There is always a noticeable long line at this particular establishment and i had always made a mental note to try and visit Los Tacos if I got a chance. I was looking at the menu and the cashier was kind enough to let me know that they were closing up soon. Â This place serves the meat freshly cooked from a large spit (a method known as al pastor). This is a street style establishment so there is of course no seating. Â I chose the pollo asado (grilled chicken) and the adobada (marinated pork) both prepared on tostadas. Had there been more time I would have ordered more food but each selection was topped off with the works (guacamole, onions etc). Both selections were so very messy but so delicious. The service is very quick. Â They have a very efficient system for getting the food out in a very timely manner. It leaves little mystery as to why Los Tacos is always busy when I visit Chelsea Market. Â The only issue people might have is the no seating but there is seating in certain areas of the market.

All of the tacos are fresh as you can see them cooking in front of you. Â It's a bit of chaotic and disorganized once you placed your order. The next step is to tell the cook whether you prefer flour or corn. . It is unclear why I would need to tell the cook/food prep worker whether I want corn or flour. Sure, I have a preference, but Chelsea Market is loud and crowded. I find that many customers has to ask for clarifications when they ask for flour or corn. It could be easily resolved at the registrar and have it printed on your receipt. Â Another struggle is that there is a lack of space to eat. It lacks a natural flow to the area Â of ordering, speaking with the taco maker, getting the food, and moving along. Â I would recommend taking your food to go.

The line was very long, and Chelsea Market was as crowded as ever, but the line moved very quickly. They were incredibly friendly (and patient given the crazy number of tourists). Just be sure to give your to the receipt to the chefs at the second window (go around everyone lingering!), get the corn tortilla, and get everything on your taco! Also, be sure to load up on the toppings - but not so much as to overwhelm the delicious pork.I so happened to give my ticket to someone just as he was switching out the roasting pork. So after 5-10 minutes, and three times as many people came and went, the chefs noticed and asked me about my ticket. In less than 30 seconds, I had my tacos (and an extra graciously included!) in my hand and devoured them in about 2 mins.

Los Tacos No. 1 is located inside Chelsea Market. When we got there, the line was fairly long, but moved fairly quick. The type of tacos include pollo (chicken), adobada (pork), nopal (cactus -- I should've tried this), and carne asada (the one I did try). Tacos range from $3.25-$3.75. Seems a bit pricey for just one taco. They also have quesadillas and mulas, neither of which I tried, but looked good.When it was finally our turn, we ordered a bunch of the carne asada tacos since they're pretty small.After you order, make sure you take your receipt to the left side so the cooks can prepare your food for you. Once we handed the cooks our receipt, they made everything with 5-10 minutes. Pretty fast, considering we ordered 8 tacos and there was a crowd.Now, the moment of truth: the first bite. Again, I must emphasize that I am not a taco kind of person. After the first bite, I knew that these were the best tacos I've ever had, simply because I haven't had tacos from many places. Nonetheless, these tacos are definitely worth the price! I only had 3 of the 8 we ordered, and they were sufficient enough for me to get full.

I'm not 100% sure how it works because it was a little confusing since it was our first time there. It can get intimidating at first because it moves quick. Also, the line gets omega long closer to the main lunch period. We're just lucky that we ordered before said line happened. I decided to go with a carne asada taco with a flour tortilla. It was delicious. They pack so much meat onto the taco. And the beef for the carne asada was soooo juicy and seasoned soooo well. I've never had a taco that was so packed and juicy! They also have fresh salsa on the counter for you to grab. Definitely add some of that! It works so very well with the tacos! They also have little containers for you to put the salsa in if you are taking everything to-go. The only downside is that there is no places to sit and enjoy your food.

Nevertheless, I've always been disappointed in NYC's street taco offerings. I was excited to try Los Tacos, but a little wary that it wouldn't live up to the hype. Located in the center of Chelsea Market, this taco stand is easy to find due to the long line of taco fiends extending far past its boundaries. There is approximately no seating, so a few patrons were standing a the counter or at the tables of other dining establishments. The menu is pretty simple and has large font, so that you can make your decision to order while waiting in line. I ordered two tacos with corn tortillas and all the toppings. There is a $5 credit card minimum, but these tacos aren't super cheap so the cashless will be okay. Â After you elbow tourists out of the way to hand your receipt over the counter, you can watch the meat men prepare the goods and load up on salsas and pico de gallo. I was happy when my tacos came out and loved eating them! The carne asada had me ravenous - the beef was so juicy and tender. Unfortunately, my adobada taco took a bit longer to come out,and there was no seat to eat my other taco while waiting, but it was also good. These are definitely high quality tacos, but for $3.75, I can get 2 amazing tacos in SoCal. I guess its the price you pay for a great location in Chelsea Market and all the hype.

It is very confusing for people who are here for the first time, and the dudes barely speak any English. $3.75 for the grilled steak tacos. These are good but nowhere nere the best that others have claimed. While the meat are tender, some of the tacos have too much sauce (guacamole) and some don't have enough. It's obvious that these guys are trying to get the line moving so the portions are not consistent. $3.50 for the marinated pork tacos. The guy in front of us claims this one is the best taco in town. I don't usually get pork tacos but I want to see what's the hype is all about. I'm very surprised to find that they're so salty. I almost throw these away but at $3.50 a piece I gotta swallow these salt tacos. They're also a bit on the dry side so make sure you get a Mexican coke to help get everything down.

Do note that they're located inside of Chelsea Market with no sign outside. Los Tacos No. 1 was actually listed last year in Yelp's top 100 food places in the entire country and after eating here I can see why. It's a simple taco stand making everything from scratch right in front of you including both their corn and flour tortillas and the quality of the ingredients is top notch. Truly authentic tacos are made with corn tortillas and cheaper cuts of meat as it's generally considered a poor mans street food. As I dislike low quality meat and corn tortillas I typically stay away from tacos but with their high quality meat and homemade flour tortilla options it's a different ballgame. They may even convert me to a corn tortilla lover if those are as good as they look. Filling options for the tacos include carne asada (grilled steak) for $3.75, pollo asado (grilled chicken) for $3.50, adobada (marinated pork) for $3.50, and nopal (grilled cactus) for $3. You can also get the same fillings in a quesadilla/mulas (mulas being with flour tortilla, quesadilla being with corn) for $4-5, and chips and salsa ($3) or chips and guacamole ($4). I ordered 3 flour tortillas with eat of the meat options. They simply top each one with some raw chopped onions and cilantro and then you can help yourself to a number of different salsas and limes.

Sorry, Austin but Los Tacos has you beat on EVERY level. For about $4 you get your choice of pork, chicken, beef and cactus. We opted for one of each minus cactus. Take your pick on corn or flour tortilla and ask for ""everything."" You'll get guac, cilantro and onions. Top it off with salsa at the ""salsa bar"" where stone pots filled with various types of salas awaits. TIP: Save the best for last and savor pork at the very end. You can see the chefs slow roasting the pork in the back.I was pleasantly surprised to find none of my meat was dry and every bite was an explosion of flavors I'm still craving now.

At about $3 per taco, they're definitely cheaper than the majority of what's being sold at Chelsea Market. Two tacos is enough to keep me satiated so I have room to try a few other goodies at the Lobster Place a few meters down. I've tried both the steak and the chicken tacos here - both are great, really just a matter of which you prefer more usually. The meat is tender and seasoned well. The soft tortilla on the outside is soft and just thin enough where it holds the inside of the taco without being overpowering in terms of texture. You're also free to add any sauces, toppings, or lemons to your taco as well at the self-serve station near the counter.

You have to do a little navigating to find it in this massive shopping/food center. When you find the restaurant you will see a menu on the right side of the line and old fashion bottled sodas in a cooler, in front of the cash register. You order and they will give you your receipt. Do not be an idiot like me and throw it away once you get it because you will need it. In order to get your food, they will take your receipt, make your food, then give it to you. Do not forget!This was my first time going so I tried the pollo asado aka chicken taco and got it with a tortilla. Of course I ordered guac and chips on the side. I am not a rookie!When you get your food, there will be different types of spices. I loveeeee spicy food so I went with the first one( I do not know the name but it was brown) and it tasted delicious!!!! Time: the line was long but moved fast. Be aware when a cashier is calling next.

But that being said I really enjoyed them both and I didn't mind that I had waited in line a little while to get them. Also the prices there were very reasonable.

When I saw the menu, I was pretty shocked by how expensive the tacos were (I'm used to $1 tacos so $3.75 + extra for the cheese shell is a lot!!) but I was still very down just to try a new experience. We didn't have to wait that long, and especially after ordering, the line for sauces moves pretty quickly. I got one adobada and one carne asada.The cheese shell is delicious! You definitely end up with very greasy fingers but it's worth it. The meat was average, not amazing. Not worth $3.75 with a regular tortilla. But to be fair I am spoiled with amazing tacos in the LA/SD area, so I feel like my standards for tacos are really high. Still, the unique concept made it worth my time and money.

The process:You will have to mingle and wingle through the crowds of the Chelsea market to make it to the line. Not that the line doesn't move quickly, it's just part of the experience here.

After ordering you will get a ticket, and when one of the servers will be available give them your ticket and tell them you want it in a corn tortilla. The lime, radish, salads, and hot paper on the counter are there for you, so don't be shy. This is one of the few places where the hype is totally justified, especially if you get the marinated pork in a ""corn"" tortilla.

The lack of good Mexican food in NYC is well-documented by now, so I was wary when someone told me these were ""the best tacos in New York."" At this point I hear those words and just absently nod. But Los Tacos meets the standard of good taco trucks back home. I wouldn't say it blew me away. Their quality is solid and consistent, but lands in the mid-range if you've had decent tacos before. Still, I appreciate the quality given the location.The line can get pretty crazy since it's right in the middle of Chelsea Market, but it moves fast. Ordering is quick and simple: choose your type of meat (or nopales/cactus) in either a taco or quesadilla. Note that their quesadillas are open-faced tacos with melted cheese rather than traditional quesadillas, so I'm not sure if the extra $1 is worth it. They do feel a bit more filling though. In terms of meat, the adobada (marinated pork) and carne asada (steak) are both amazing. Their adobada is very similar to al pastor, and even comes with small strips of pineapple on top (to be honest, I'm not sure if there's a difference at all).After ordering, hand your ticket to the cooks and let them know if you want corn or flour tortillas. I highly recommend the freshly-made corn ones. Once your food is handed to you, top it off with one of their salsas and grab some limes, raw radish slices, and roasted chilies. Or eat them as is! Their tacos come simply with onion, cilantro, and guacamole taquero, the thinner guacamole that marks a street taco. There's no place to sit, but you can kind of hover near their ordering counter if it isn't too busy.The only thing that bothers me is pricing. I have a hard time forking over $4-5 for a single taco, but then again, I should probably just accept the fact that I'm in New York and this is how it's gonna be.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

The fried quesadilla is like, the best thing ever. Never had one before but it was life changing, basically. The outside was fried to a perfection, not too crunchy so that it was like a chip, and definitely not soft like what normal quesadillas are like.

The LAST place I could think of would probably be a taco joint inside Chelsea Market. And to claim to be ""No. 1""? We'll see about that. But my sister swore that all her friends loved the tacos, too, so we took off to the most upscale taco joint I've ever experienced. INTERIOR: No seating - at least they got that part right about it being a taco joint. Honestly, tacos need to be a little dirty and it wasn't as dirty as expected. But it was still interesting seeing the kitchen make my tacos. There was a line that ended near the entrance of the shop, which was pretty impressive, seeing as it was a late lunch time on a weekday. FOOD:I ended up ordering two tacos and a horchata, while my sister ordered chicken quesadillas. I was super excited for my carne asada and adobada. I sipped on my horchata while waiting. It was sugary sweet but definitely helped with the impending spicy kick of the tacos. Both tacos were delicious. My sister didn't appreciate that they automatically doused her quesadilla in the guacamole sauce, as she enjoys her food plain Jane - no sauce necessary. Overall, it was a tasty lunch on the go.

I get their breakfast burritos almost everyday. Salsas are good. Steak and chicken have this char grilled taste. Pork is the BEST. Get tacos with everything. If you can't find seating go to Los Mariscos next door and order a shrimp taco and sit down. Â They are owned by the same people. It's totally fine. Sometimes their pork is over salted but it's once in a blue moon. Go here. BEST TACOS EVER.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

The food here tastes actually very authentic. Their meat is especially juicy and well seasoned. And there are a lot of free toppings on the side too: pico de gallo, radish, salsa, slices of lime, etc. This place reminds me of the Mexican food I get in Queens.It is a bit overpriced but that is because of its location.

It also sets the stage for what's to come - fast, flavorful, funder-represented food. Fuh real.These guys I know talked up the adobada like it's a savory savior in a soft corn tortilla, but I'll tell you what the real counter lunch winner is: dat carne asada. Don't get me wrong - the pork is stuff of legend, especially when treated with the works (radishes, onion, lime, any of the baller salsas). The steak is just light years above other renditions, slung with the quickness after a marinade, biased cut and flash grilling that makes it impossibly tender and saturated with spice.As a newb, I hemmed and hawed after placing my order, not knowing what the fuck to do as arms and torsos thrusted themselves past me to the short stretch of a serving area - grabbing plates on the fly, or posting up to make quick work of their order. We joined in on the latter, and once everything was coated, topped and sauced, the world stopped. I housed my tacos like nobody's watching.Nearing $4 a taco is ludicrous, but hey, Manhattan.

Tacos are a little on the pricier side if you're comparing to LA taco trucks, but hey, you're in a prime Chelsea Market spot.. so I guessss. Good luck with finding seats because you'll have to fight your way through especially on busy days/hours (aka all day all night).

Los tacos #1 was very good, and I would probably go back but not in the near future.It is located inside Chelsea market, and there was only about a 10 min wait time in line on a Friday night at 7:30pm. One con is that there's no place to sit. We ordered the steak, pork, and chicken tacos (all the meat ones), and went across to the Creamline seating area to eat.I thought the pork taco was really good, very flavorful and salty, but the meat was a bit dry. They also but an exorbitant amount of sauce on it! I liked the sauce but would've preferred more meat or veggies instead.Also tried the steak and definitely liked that one better! Lots of juicy meat and not as sauce overloaded as the pork one. I didn't get to try the chicken one, but my boyfriend did and claimed that the steak was by far his favorite still.I think the best part of the tacos was the corn tortilla! I almost chose the flour tortilla, but the guy making the tacos heavily recommended corn, so I went with that. The corn was sturdy yet soft, didn't get soggy, and was perfectly chewy.

There's no other way to put it. They're perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked and the corn tortillas here are done right. This place restored my faith in tacos. There's a consistently long line here, but it moves pretty quickly and you're served relatively quickly as well.

A bit of a downer for me since I hail from Texas where great tacos are a dime a dozen. I had very low expectations when I went to Los Tacos No. 1 - I thought it was just an overhyped touristy spot. Man, was I wrong. The tacos were legit. They didn't rely on some weird fusion or crazy ingredients like some new trendy taco joints, but were in fact very authentic tacos just made very, very well. Every detail down to the tortilla was spot on. They don't skimp on the meat or fillings either. Every taco I have had was delicious, but as other people of mentioned, the adobada taco is probably the best. For those visiting for the first time, they have a weird ordering system where you put your order and then take your receipt to the guys at the left for your food to be prepared.

It's just nice to know beforehand so here you go: 1) Order at the register. 2) Hand your receipt to an employee at the bar on the left. 3) Tell them what toppings you'd like. 4) Stay in sight so the employee can find you when he/she is done crafting your tacos. Simple enough, but I thought they'd be calling out numbers so I stood around for a little bit before I caught on to the fact that I need to hand them my receipt.Seating:--There is none. Most people stood and ate at the bar on the left, but this is where people are handed their tacos and where the salsas are so it's not a very convenient spot to eat. Instead of standing in that high traffic area, I went and stood at the counter to the right of the cashier (nobody else was standing there).Food:--I ordered two carne asada tacos with all the toppings (one on flour and one on corn).

I also appreciate that this place makes fresh tortillas instead of using those tasteless premade ones. It makes a huge difference! You have two options here: flour or corn tortilla.

It was also disappointing because I bit into it expecting it to be beef.Probably would have loved this place if I got my correct order!

But based on the sample size of the tacos I've tried in NYC, and lots of West coasters preaching about what a real taco should taste like, these are probably the best so it gets a relative 5 stars. Tacos were stuffed to maximum capacity. My favorite is Carne asada, which was tender and smokey. The adobada was super flavorful but a little too salty for my taste. The cactus was pretty bland and boring, wouldn't recommend it. Corn tortilla was soft and grilled right. Guacamole is included which is what all other places should aspire to be like. I love that you have free access to salsas, limes, radishes and chilies. Horchata was pretty good too (though I've never met horchata I didn't like).

There was salsa where you pick up your order at the end for you to put n your tacos. I loaded it up with salsa and it was very delicious. The salsa was fresh and complimented the hot meats in the taco very well. I also had the horchata. The horchata had more cinnamon than expected.

For a moment, you forget you are even in Manhattan. People say there can't be a good taco place in Manhattan but I'm not so sure about that... The service is quick but there are really long lines sometimes. This was my 2nd time trying because the line was too long the 1st time I went. The employees there are extremely kind and receptive. The cashier takes you order and gives you a slip to give the taco man then he asks you if you want corn or flour tortillas. I chose corn cause I thought it would be a more authentic experience. Service is very quick and I got my taco within 5 minutes. I ordered a chicken and nopal (cactus) taco. First time actually eating cactus and the nearest desert is like a thousand miles a way so Los Tacos is the only place it looks like I can get cactus. I loove cactus, I def recommend it if you a vegetarian or vegan. The chicken taco was amazing as well, the chicken was perfectly grilled and marinated. Each taco comes topped with guac, onions,and cilantro. After you order your taco, there is a condiment bar to top your tacos. For such a busy place, I'm really surprised how clean it was each time I've been there. All condiment toppings looked fresh like they've just been made especially the salsa, radishes, and lime wedges. There is barely seating here, people do eat in front of the condiments which can be hectic. But if you walk around Chelsea Market, there's bound to be seating especially if it's warm & you can go up to the High Line and try not to look messy devouring your tacos like I did.

That's right, Tacos with a capital. Ya got Tacos, folks, right here in Chelsea Market. Tacos with a capital ""T"". And that rhymes with ""P"" and that stands for pork! The Adobada they serve up is nothing short of delectable.

Tacos are about $4 (a hefty price to pay, but worth every penny) and are pretty filling. You're going to want a few though. Not because you'll be hungry, but because they're just so good you need to try as many as possible.I'd recommend splitting 3-4 tacos and a quesadilla with a friend.

We got to the market around 5 PM or so and headed straight for the tacos! The line looked pretty long, but I think it moved relatively quickly. We got one of each taco minus the cactus one (I think there are 3, chicken, steak, and pork) with everything on them. You order at the register and they hand you a ticket with what you ordered which you give to one of the available guys making the tacos in front of you and you can watch them make it. It was pretty crowded and it was a little troublesome trying to get the attention of someone to take your ticket with everyone else in the area. They also had a bowl of pico de gallo and other sauces for when you get your taco. The tacos are pretty small and street sized so it was fine for us to share as a snack. I thought all 3 were amazing - the meat wasn't dry at all and they put GUAC on the tacos which was so good. The chicken wasn't spicy but the steak and pork were (in my opinion) - I have very low spice tolerance and my mouth was on FIRE after we finished. Get a drink and prepare yourself if you can't handle spicy food very well. It was definitely very tasty though!I think this place is moderately priced - $3/taco, considering that the amount of meat they give you was not skimpy. I would give it a 4.5/5. In my opinion tasted better than Los Mariscos which was around the corner and served the seafood version (fish and shrimp tacos).David's Review:Mexican food is consistently part of my meal plans as a guy from Southern California. I think these street tacos were definitely on point! The line was daunting but moved relatively quickly. It allowed us time to go through the pictures on Yelp and decide what to order. Out of the three that we got, I liked the pork adobada the best (another way of saying pastor? I love pastor so I may be biased), followed by the steak. My only suggestion to the business is that they should have a better system of just having the guys in the back make your tacos without you having to scramble to give them receipts after paying for it. If I wanted to be rude, I could have just pushed my way to the front and gave my receipt to the guy after paying for it in the back. Luckily, Joyce makes me want to be a better person so I played nice. Would give this a 4.5/5 as well! Definitely on point in terms of flavor and price. Knocked off a half star to round down to 4 for the flow (automate the food receipts in the back).D+J's Ratinf: 4/5 - We liked it! Come check it out!!",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

The meats are all grilled over open flame which gives them great flavor. The quesadillas are not what we are used to - it was two flat tortillas with cheese inside that is melted on the griddle. Then that is used as the base for a taco - so is it a true American style quesadilla where meats and fillings are melted together,? No. Is it good? Yes but not as good as if the meats and cheeses were melted together. It is clear that they do it this way to speed up the cooking process. If the meat was mixed with the cheese it would take a lot longer to melt. The flip side is that you get a lot more meat the way that they do it.No rice or beans available only chips and guacamole. Only tacos and quesadillas - no burritos or anything else.They have authentic looking hibiscus (flor de jamaica) herbal tea, orchata and a third beverage in pails that they ladle out over ice.

I was expediting more of a street style taco, but there were a little larger with more meat and only one tortilla instead of the usual two that you would get at a taco truck/taqueria. I think the meat was really good and tender, but all the flavors didn't work so well together and the tortilla was too thin. I felt like I was mostly eating meat and sauces weren't all that great either. Overall, I feel like I have been to various better tasting and authentic taco places.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

I have visited Los Tacos No.1 time and time again, and have finally decided to give them the review they deserve. The rave reviews that these tacos are receiving are all accurate. These are seriously the best tacos I have had in New York City. There's something about the meat seasoning that is just out of this world. My personal favorite is the carne asada taco. The quesadillas are just so, so good as well! You can't go wrong with either. Make sure you ask for a bit of pineapple for a burst of sweetness to your taco or quesadilla! The staff is kind enough to accommodate that request, even though it's not listed anywhere.The taste is very authentic, and you may choose from several toppings located on the bar. Just put everything on it! It's worth it! I have been to this location many times for their food, and I will be going back frequently!

Like, these are actually the best tacos I've ever had the pleasure of digesting in my 25 years of life in the North East. I only say NE because Texas (and I'm sure the West Coast as well) has their own spin on the classic taco - face it, who can beat the perfect Tex-Mex breakfast taco in TEYHASSS.Very little accouterments are added to said tacos yet even with the addition of the optional side sauces, the meat shines bright with all its glory.I recommend ordering the Carne Asada (grilled steak), you most definitely will not be disappointed. Out of all the steak tacos I've tried, this by far is THE BEST I've ever had. Corn tortillas are a must, it's not a true Mexican taco unless you order just that.Be wary, the line is constantly long (as it should be), but moves quite fast.

The line was long and the ordering system is interesting, making you give your receipt directly to a Tacquero as if you were to pass an order to a bartender. I got a Carne Asada taco and an Adobada quesadilla. They make the tacos really quickly so it's not going to be proportionately layered, but the meat is incredible. The quesadillas are like a larger taco with melted cheese, so if you like cheese on your tacos go with the quesadilla. If you like Taco Bell-style quesadillas that are dominated by cheese and pressed flat, then go to Taco Bell, because you're not worthy of this quality of Mexican. This is the perfect combination of upscale New York Mexican with LA street-cart Mexican. It also happens to be served out what looks like a street stand, but inside Chelsea Market.

You should get corn they make them fresh with actual masa meaning they are not those dry pieces of cardboard you get from the grocery store. The Adobada was great if I had to nitpick I would say it was a bit dry and overly charred. The Carne was juicy, fatty, and perfect. The combination of flavors were spot on.

Mainly b/c most places douse everything in cheese. I imagine, in Mexico everything isn't actually doused in cheese but I digress.

I got the cheese taco with chicken; let me elaborate the cheese taco is when they take mozzarella cheese and grill it to crunchy perfection into a nice ""taco shell"" than they proceed to add ""everything"" on it and they have these salsa stations and u can add additional stuff to it.

559,aaiQhRldfNZFmVmdy_c8QA,Athena B.,5.0 star rating,THE BEST TACOS IN NYC. They are truly authentic and their location in Chelsea Market gives you the full experience of going to a taco truck. All of their tacos are great and I highly recommend the Adobada (pork) tacos. You also have to try their Especial quesadilla. It is a FRIED quesadilla. What more can you ask for? They really do load up their dishes with the meat and be warned they do put some of their medium spiced salsa if you ask for everything on your taco so if you can't take the heat make sure you mention it to them. There is always a long line but it moves quickly. Make sure you make eye contact with the guys behind the counter because they won't wait for you with making these orders. Get your ticket into their hands as soon as they're ready. The biggest trouble is trying to find a spot in the market where you can rest your plate.,Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

And that's a story that should be told.Los Tacos No. 1 came into me and my fiancÃ©e's lives at the right time. We were missing some favorite foods from California and we wanted to, I guess, try and bury those feelings with some good, top-notch food from the best New York has to offer. Enter the Yelp Top 100. Scrolling down, we saw some of our favorite players: 1. Porto's, 11. Cream Pan, and... oh, 17. Tacos El Gordo! Your delicious adobada tacos, that pineapple, that green sauce. My most favorite in the world so far... What I wouldn't do for a bite of you...What's this...? 40. Los Tacos No. 1.... New York, NY? *clicks on pictures* And one picture had it in all its glory: adobada, pineapple, green sauce... a divine coincidence. As if it were a mirage. Too good to be true. Could this place stack up to my love? My Tacos El Gordo? We had to check this place out! After the line, a short wait time, and finding a place to sit in the Market, we bit. It's good. Really good. Meat on both the carne asada and adobada seemed a tad dry and I could've used more green sauce. Ignoring that as a one-time thing, well... I'll say it's a close second to Tacos El Gordo. And that's a fine place to be!! Shoot, my fiancÃ©e is second to... just kidding. Kidding!

Yes it's expensive and perhaps overrated, but when you're inebriated and on a low-carb diet, then this place is PERFECT. If you're a cheese fan like me, the thing to get is Queso Shell ANYTHING. I don't think you can go wrong, especially since everything kinda tastes deliciously similar. The only downy is that each taco costs around $5 bucks or so, which is an arm and a leg in taco world. Two should do the trick for the queso shells, but three is the magic number for the normal tacos unless you're a big eater. There aren't any seats, but there is a standing countertop area with a salsa station for you to eat your food. While it may seem a bit crowded at times, it doesn't take long for a spot to open up as the service is pretty fast and people come and go.

In short: yeah, the tacos are every bit as great as the other 1432 reviews say. The line/crowd is no joke and just figuring out how the process works can take a few minutes, but basically you put in your order, (attempt to) move down the counter, hand your order to one of cooks, and two minutes later you've got your piping hot and fresh tacos. The nopal/cactus taco is quite an interesting flavor...plant-y and a little sweet, plus texture-wise it was a little stringy so it wasn't my favorite. Adobada is quite good and I like the thin strips of pineapple on top, but the carne asada is UNBELIEVABLE. It's probably one of the most delicious things you'll ever eat in 30 seconds. Downsides are of course there's nowhere to sit unless you go into sister shop Los Mariscos, and even when you're standing at the counter you have a couple of people waiting impatiently for you to hurry up so they can take your place.

So believe the hype ya'll, Los Taco's No. 1 is truly popular for a reason. Also the cheapest and best thing to eat in the Chelsea Market. I normally love getting my taco fix in Brooklyn, Sunset from Taco's El Bronco which are about $2.50-3.00 with guac on top too. Tacos:Definitely get the 'Adobada Taco' of course, it's marinated pork topped with grilled pineapples (BONUS... this really gets me) and verde sauce and the 'Carne Asada' which is grilled steak taco. You get to pick either a regular flour tortilla or corn tortilla. I get carne with flour and adobada with the corn one. The tacos are truly so flavorful and juicyy! Price wise, I'm only paying $.50-$1 more here which is totally reasonable and not considered ""pricey tacos"" at all since its in Manhattan plus they really loadd the tacos. Your selection choice in tacos and quesadillas are small anyways however...

I've definitely walked by this stall multiple times but never considered getting anything first because of the long line and second because the menu is in Spanish.

You place your order and then hand your ticket to one of the cooks. Get the corn tortilla and let them know what you want on it! There's also additional toppings you can add to your taco on the counter. GET THE PORK! (Third option on the list!) You won't regret it. So juicy and flavorful. I went back the second time just to order it again. I don't think I can ever go to Chelsea and not get a taco now.

The price per taco is not cheap, but it is so worth it. The tacos exploded with flavor. The meat was fresh, juicy, and tender, and the tortillas were soft and chewy. I could not ask for more from a taco, and I honestly regret not getting seconds. The only downside to Los Tacos No. 1 is that they don't offer any seating, so my friends and I stood next to their counter to eat our tacos.

I've always thought why would I get Chacos in the city when there's so many authentic places in Queens and Brooklyn. But boy was I wrong. Decided to grab lunch here when nothing else was appealing to me cuz of my job, and I was in for a pleasant surprise. Ordered the Pollo asada tacos on flour tortillas and my friend ordered the same thing on the corn tortillas. You can see them being made right behind the counter. Workers were shopping chicken and preparing quesadillas, even Fresh Tortillas. But myself you can get this anywhere can go to qudoba or you can go to Chipotle and you're basically the same thing, but the difference is in the taste. The food was perfectly seasoned, and the two tacos were very filling. I also ordered an order of chips and guac. it was pretty good, I typically like my guacamole a little bit more spicy , but they had that covered as well. Right on the counter as you receive your order you can choose from mild medium and hot sauce to put on your tacos as well as pico de gallo and fresh lines cut for their customers. They also have roasted red chili peppers on the counter in case you wanted to have a little bit more of a Mesquite flavor to your taco. I will definitely visit this place again.

I came in and ordered a quesadilla especial and a nopal taco. The folks behind the counter promptly assembled my food and handed it over. Once I had my food, the tricky place was trying to find a place to enjoy it. You can stand at the table area or you can venture down the hall where there are more stand up tables. No sit down unless you want to pay for it I guess. :/The quesadilla was amazing. They folded over the tortilla to make a pocket and stuffed everything in after frying. It was just the right thickness to hold everything together. Any less and it would have split open..As for the taco, maybe it was me but the nopal has the texture of a rubber glove.

Because these were the BEST TACOS EVER!!!The moment I saw a video on this place on Facebook and it said it was in NYC, I HAD to go!!! Of course what caught my attention is their cheese shell tacos. Literally mouth watering. It's not that hard to find inside the market and the LONG line may turn some people off but TRUST me, it's worth the wait (which honestly, is not that long of a wait). They work really fast and you'll probably be on line for 10mins. I had their carne asada and pollo (beef and chicken) cheese shell tacos. I have a really low tolerance for spicy food so it sucked that most places I've gone to eat tacos, all the spices are so incorporated into the taco, there's no way around it. Which is why I fell in LOVE with this place because you pretty much order your taco like you'd order a sandwich at Subway's. I added the guacamole, onions and mild salsa to my tacos and squeezed fresh limes on them. (My mouth is watering as I'm typing this). Again, BEST. TACOS. EVER!!! Now, of course there are pros and cons to everything, but their pros definitely outweigh their cons. The cons are just there their are no seating areas near by for you to eat BUT there are these stand up tables not too far (which is where we ended up eating and it was fine). If you walk further down, you'll find tables that don't belong to any specific establishment and you can just eat there. So my suggestion is, where they ask if you want it to go, say yes. It'll be a lot easier to maneuver within the market when everything is wrapped and inside a bag. Also, because the taco shell is made of cheese, you can expect there to be a bit more grease than usual. BUT, it reallyyyy didn't matter to me since the deliciousness of this amazing cheese taco over powered anything else. So again, I can't stress this enough, if you live in NYC or are coming to visit, make your way to Chelsea Market and check this place out!

613,Ll9uTDMcdOjbVioIJFW08w,Pritha R.,4.0 star rating,"Guys. I'm super late to this party. Totally sorry!But now that I've arrived I AM SO INTO IT. A lil bit of backstory. You know when your MacBook Pro retina screen cracks and you have to get it fixed and you're dreading the 14th St 9th Ave Genius Bar appointment because your repair is out of warranty? And suddenly, Tim Cook's magical hands reach over from Cupertino, wave a magical wand, and your magical Geniuses decide to ""surprise and delight"" you, and your repair is free and done in front of you in an hour? (""Surprise and delight"" is actually a ""thing"" that Geniuses are encouraged to do, to keep the unicorn sparkle flowing in true Apple style. Google it. With a drink in hand. You'll want to raise that glass.)THAT is a taco moment. In fact, that is moment for two tacos. Conveniently located one block from the 14th Street Apple store, Los T #1 is in Chelsea Market. If you enter on 9th ave, the spot is tucked towards the back, and across from the Japanese-Inspired Mexican place (not awkward at all, I'm thinking? :| ) Los T #1 is usually always packed. Go at a slight off time, nbd. Place your order with the very pleasant intake person at the cashier. As a couple of questions. I usually go with ""What do you like best?"" ""Do you think I should get ______?"" Then I order it. I was advised to select adobada and grilled steak. We chatted about whether I should get chips (greed is allowed when Apple Magic happens - btw - but I decided against it). I asked if they had sparkling water and the intake person gave me a Jarritos selzer, free. What a lovely guy! Obviously, really great customer service makes everything taste pretty damn good so my tacos were already working for me, before I took a bite. After placing one's order, one moves over to the team that makes the food. I was asked ""Corn or Flour"" and went with corn. This was a mistake, as my new Mexican friend who ordered after me, shared. Real Mexican tacos are had in flour tortillas which can be fried. I sensed this could get geo-political fast. So I smiled, told him next time I'd flour up and redeemed myself by drinking a few tiny cups of gratis picante salsa, as chasers for my Mexican selzer. We discussed salsa in earnest, I sensed I had been absolved for my corn choice, and we had a nice moment. My tacos: guys, these tacos are pretty damn good. They come with one tortilla (some folks have many opinions on how many tortillas should cradle the fillings but I'm fine with the one), and as I asked for everything, my meats were topped with onion, cilantro, and a squirt of guacamole. Fresh radish, lime wedges, pico de gallo, and two slightly more ""spicy"" salsas were set up for self-serve taco (or whatever) embellishment. I bypassed the pico and beelined for the spiciest of their salsas only to be slightly crushed at how mild was for my tastes. I asked one of the counter fellows if they had anything with more heat and he gave a couple of charred jalepenos. Kind right?

I haven't had a really good experience with Mexican food in NYC and was therefore a bit skeptical when one of my friends suggested Los Tacos No. 1. We came in mid-afternoon on a weekday, so it wasn't as crowded as we expected. I ordered one pollo asado and one steak taco. They were both AMAZING. The meat was bursting with flavor and I was blown away by how tasty the tacos were. I love how they throw in a generous amount of guac inside and how you can add in as much salsa as you want. The tacos look pretty tiny, but I was comfortably full after eating two. There's no seating here, so we just ended up eating on the counters where the salsa and other condiments were. I can see how this place can get really chaotic during rush hours. Thankfully there is open seating around Chelsea Market so you'll probably be able to grab a table somewhere if there's no space around the counters. Staff was nice and checked in on us to see how we were enjoying ourselves. I was so busy stuffing my face I couldn't even verbally tell him how much I loved it. I'm sure he could how much I was enjoying the tacos by how quickly I was inhaling them.My friends are back in CA now, but we still talk about how great these tacos were.

I've tried many taco locations in New York (I have many more to try) but so far los tacos taste extremely close to what I've had in Mexico!!! That's says a lot because it's hard to replicate the exact flavor of a food that's not in the motherland. Los tacos is located in Chelsea market and it took about 5 minutes to find. There are no seatings, so you'll have to stand and eat. All the sauces are laid out for you by where you're eating. The chefs take your ticket and that's how they make your food! I ordered the pollo taco and pollo quesadilla. Holy moly... Best tacos I've had by far in NYC! The tacos are so fresh and made right in front of you! The meat, cheese, guac and everything else is extremely juicy! So careful not to make a mess!

Â I usually get two quesadillas with carne asada and that's just enough for lunch. Since it's in the Chelsea Market you do have to deal with the onslaught of tourists and others grabbing lunch in the area. There's also no seating accompanying this food stand. It's less of an issue in the warmer months when you can bring your food outside to eat.

The pork had a stronger kick than el Gordo, which is nice for the spicy lovers. Overall solid taco, pretty impressed but does not quite beat the adobada taco in San Diego.

The pork itself is crispy but also very tender at the same time. It is shaved off from a larger piece of beautiful meat that rotates on a vertical rotisserie with an open gas flame slowly cooking the pork. There's a bar of condiments and toppings after you finish ordering - stocked with cilantro, lime wedges, all sorts of hot sauce, salsa and more. You can top it with as much as you like and with whatever you like. I also ordered the HORCHATA but thought it was watered down. It tasted more like iced water with some cinnamon sprinkled in. I think I'd rather get a soda next time. I went on a Thursday afternoon so the line wasn't long at all. There were about 3 people ahead of me and the wait was about 5 minutes. I have heard that the lines get incredibly long most days though!

I used to think Mexican food in NYC couldn't possibly compare to the Mexican joints I frequent back home but I was wrong.

688,3YwmmJ5dNL7KC7FFbcJZVA,Peggie Y.,4.0 star rating,"This place is my new go-to for tacos. Â It's located in the Chelsea Market. Â You just need to follow the pointing arrows on the wall, and you would be able to find it easily. Â There's always a long line, so you just need to follow the flow of people and line up in front of the cashiers. Â Most items are under $6 each. Â For tacos, they have carne asada (grilled steak), chicken, cactus (they run of of cactus a lot, so this is not always available) and marinated pork. Â And you have to specify if you wanted flour tortillas (contained gluten per their sign) or corn tortillas. Â I chose corn tortillas with my chicken, beef and pork tacos. Â Their tortillas are homemade, there's a person behind the counter making them. Â I also ordered the pork and beef quesadillas. Â After you order at the cashier, just move to the end of the line where you could hand the kitchen your ticket (be sure to remember what you order as the kitchen would take away your ticket/receipt). Â The kitchen would then call your number. Â My wait for the food was less than 10 minutes. After you get your food, you could move to the middle of the counter where they have containers with freshly prepared pico de Gallo and various types of hot sauce and lime wedges. Â You could top your tacos or quesadillas with however much pico de gallo or hot sauce you want. Â It can get super messy eating this food, so make sure you grab a handful of napkins!!There are no seating area at this restaurant, so just grab your food and go to one of the standing spaces outside to enjoy your meal. Â My favorite out of the 3 tacos I ordered is the chicken taco, it's so flavorful and went really well with the pico de Gallo. Â The pork was on the dryer side and did not have the sweet taste that you would find in pork tacos at a lot of places (I also like pork with pineapples for pork taco, but the preparation style here is different.) Â I like the tacos better than the quesadillas, for some reasons, the stuffing for the quesadillas is saltier than the stuffing used for the tacos. Â They seemed to have more spice in them. Â So I would recommend ordering the tacos if you had to choose between tacos and quesadillas. Â They also offer plates but people rarely order the plates. Â This place is not expensive, but it could add up, a meal for 2 people could easily be $35+ for say 3 tacos and 4 quesadillas. Â However, the tacos here use meats that are succulent, they are seasoned well and the pico de gallo is freshly prepared right in front of your eyes. Â And the best part - their tacos, etc. come with guacamole with no extra charge!!! Â If you wanted quality Mexican food with traces of authenticity at a reasonable price, come here. Â Don't mind having to stand at one of the dining areas with standing tables and getting your hands dirty. Â The food is worth the hassle.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

I had heard great things about Los Tacos No.1, but had never gotten myself over to Chelsea Market for just a meal. Boy, did I regret not coming sooner. The hype is real, and Los Tacos definitely lives up to the hype.I've spent a good amount of time scouring California for great tacos and I still think that the tacos, on average, are better in LA. HOWEVER, I definitely think Los Tacos is up there with those west coast tacos, and probably the best you can find in downtown Manhattan. At $3-4, I would say they're a bit pricey, except for the fact that they really load them up with meat, veggies, and sauces. My favorite is the adobada/al pastor (of course), and it's just a good, fresh, meaty taco. Heh. The fresh tortillas and guacamole really make a difference as well, and it all comes together very well. They also make a pretty good horchata (a sweetened rice beverage), and it's about on par with most horchatas I've had anywhere.There's not really any seating, but considering I live super close now, that's not really a problem for me. Otherwise, you can try finding seating elsewhere within Chelsea Market. Don't make the same mistake I did. Come here ASAP for great tacos. But you didn't need me to tell you that.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

The Abodabo tacos are consistently delicious; a great mix of flavorful pork, topped with onions and delicious guac. I always add the mild pico de gallo they have on the counter as I like the little tang that it gives to the taco. The only downside--and the reason for losing a star--is that the tacos are overly wet, drippy, and hard to consume in a convenient hand-held manner. The steak tacos are a little less saucy and are thus less messy. I also prefer the corn tortilla because they are a little thicker.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

Â There's choices of beef, pork, chicken, and nopal (cactus) ranging from $3 to $4 a pop. Â They also have some specialty drinks including horchata and hibiscus.My favorite by far is the nopal. Â It's slightly tangy, seasoned very well, and I just love the texture - some might find the Â texture a little strange and slighty gooey, but it's still the bomb for me.

732,wFLCJ8pTXVUQw55dJsLzRQ,Milana B.,3.0 star rating,"So before I start my review I'd like to clarify something. This was my first time experience, and for the food I'd give a solid 5. But for the service and overall experience - as a first timer - a sad 2. Therefore a compromising 3-star. Having heard so many great things about Los Tacos, me and my husband, dropping in Chelsea Market went straight to their stand. Pretty straightforward and minimal menu - a plus. But do get acquainted with some terminology beforehand. If you're going Mexican - do get to know what you're getting into. When there are 10 people behind you - you don't really want to keep the cashier by asking 100 questions what's what.I guess part of our overall experience problem - is that we weren't really know what to expect, and how the process goes, so we received a crash course. They are super busy, people coming, but moving fast. And so in order to get the line moving you have to be ready to answer the questions fast and get your order details fast. They do assemble tacos pretty much right away, not without some sloppiness, which I suppose you can't avoid due to the volume of orders, but the problem is you have to speak up really loud and listen to the serving guy very carefully, as it's really loud over there and really confusing for a first-timer. People coming, going, all around you, orders being served, someone is ordering right next to you, giving order ticket, picking up the food, putting toppings...All at the same time in a space of 2 meters...Maybe it's totally ok and someone would say ""stop complaining, man up"". Well sure, for a regular it's all part of the experience - it's just we weren't ready for that. So we didn't know that they had extra salsas and radishes on the counter. Among all that confusion we just wanted to step aside and let other people pass. So be sure you wont miss those things like we did. Secondly...the quesadilla thing. So you'd think it's Â like 2 tortillas with toppings and melted cheese? No, no, no. What we got was a tiny taco-sized tortilla with some toppings sprinkled on top and the guy said ""here, quesadilla"". Erh...what? We were kind of hungry and people were coming, so we didn't want to argue and just accepted it. Later on looking on Yelp I learned that their quesadilla is opened faced - ok, we could accept that. But the size had to be bigger. Our serving guy gave us a taco sized tortilla by mistake, so basically we got another taco for extra dollar...Be sure you're aware of that.Oh, and if you have custom tacos inside one big order - you might wanna rethink that. Until you explain that this needs to be with onions but no cilantro, and the other with cilantro, but no guacamole...It's just not gonna work, you have to keep it simple. Even though they do ask you for your preference - among all that craziness it's just easier to say ""with everything"". Unless you're one of those people that want to get your buck's worth and will patiently explain to the server how you want it, not caring that it's people behind you. Up to you :-) Now, on the positive side, the food was delicious. I've recently tried some tacos on a local food truck, and they just weren't the same...That's why I'm prepared to ""man up"" and give this place another visit, playing by rules now, and knowing fully what to expect. I guess the whole ""messy"" ordering just comes as a part of overall experience. And if people didn't like it Â - they wouldn't be coming back.Los Tacos - we'll see you soon.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

Â It's still crowded, but I've been drawn back into the din. Â Los Tacos No. 1 is the reason for my return.Ironically, the chaotic/crowded atmosphere that drove me away from the Chelsea Market is one of the draws of Los Tacos No. 1. Â It has the feel of a taco stand in Mexico. Â They blast Mexican music, which adds to the cool vibe. Â You will probably have to stand on a crowded counter with your fellow diners. Â This is definitely not a place to have a sit down with some friends.The ordering procedure is simple: Â You wait on line and give your order to the cashier. Â The cashier gives you a receipt. Â You then walk over to the counter. Â You then hand your receipt to one of the workers at the counter and they make your tacos. Â Despite the crowd and the chaos, they are efficient.Of course, the main draw is the food. Â The tacos here are amongst the best I've had in NYC. Â My favorites are the carne asada (grilled steak) and pollo asado (grilled chicken). Â The adobada (marinated pork) is also very good. Â One of these days I have to try the nopal (grilled cactus). Â The flavors are amazing!The tacos range in price from $3.25 to $3.75. Â The quesadillas cost a bit more, but the most expensive one is $5.25. Â You may order more than one taco, but it is still cheaper than many of the other places in Chelsea Market.Oh, you can also wash down your tacos with a Mexican soda or one of the aguas frescas.

764,-FL3-KW6RNl7qyJnksnpLg,Paul A.,5.0 star rating,"Since this review is going to get buried in a few days I will keep this brief: These are some of the best tacos in all of NYCFirst, I would get one of each of the four tacos. They aren't huge, they aren't that expensive, and it is worth trying each of the different styles and flavors. Even the vegetarian cactus one is awesome. Also, get the Tamarind juice. You can only get it here and it is an awesome counterpart to the spicy food. Also, I recommend getting the corn tortillas rather than flour.Finally, I would have secondary plans after this place for eating the tacos. So many people wait in line for 40 minutes and then wolf down the tacos in five seconds standing amidst a crowd of 70 Eastern European tourists. Instead, plan to go to the high line or outside on the benches by the apple store or even a cab if it is cold and eat your tacos there. Chelsea Market is a really awful place to actually eat your food and these redonkadonk tacos definitely deserve better.So yeah, I haven't really had better tacos in NYC. I honestly like Otto's almost as much, but they obviously don't compare to the quality and Cosme, while on par with this place, is extremely expensive and hard to get into. So rock this spot.

With friends and family from the west coast assuring me that NY's taco scene Â is weak, I've actually suffered from reverse motivation. Â But now I wonder if this countertop grill at the Chelsea Market is something to crow about. I had the Asada tacos and Adobas tacos, both on flour tortillas. The Asada came rolled up like an ice cream cone, and it was one of the few I've ever had that lived up to the honorific of ""steak"". You'd be thrilled if a sit-down restaurant pushed these little cuts into your plate with some mashed potatoes. When you reach your last bites of this taco, you'll sigh as the juices drip off the tortilla, forever escaping your grasp. The Adobas arrived as a more traditional open-faced taco, and boy was it pretty to look at! Its' angry red color was layered over by a pale disc of crisp cheese. Being merely excellent, I didn't enjoy the pork's taste as much. Probably because I used a (not so) medium salsa topping, adding to its' already considerable heat.Following along that last tangent, you could see that each of the three options at the salsa station were ultra-fresh. And the big bowl of limes is great for citrus-lovers like myself. But I found that the wedges were so juicy that I only needed one squeeze! Finally, I might suggest the corn tortillas in the future. They'd be able to soak up all those delicious juices, and neither taco skimps on the quantity of meat. Should you be tempted by some of the hotter salsas, the creamy Horchata drink will nicely refresh you. Enjoy!",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

The place gets busy but the line moves fast. There are four different kinds of tacos: steak, chicken, pork, and cactus. The tortillas are made fresh! This makes such a difference. It's all corn tortillas for me. Flour ones are just, well, floury. We ordered 3 tacos (steak, pork, cactus). The steak and cactus come dressed with guacamole, tomatoes, and some other stuff. The pork (or adobado), is slightly different with a spicy sauce and pineapple. They were all fantastic. I like the steak and pork the best. The cactus is a nice option for vegetarians, but honestly there's nothing there that makes it any better than getting a steak taco.The setup is not very elegant.

But for a little more money, the slightly larger quesadillas are totally worth getting too. The meat they use here is juicy, flavorful, tender, and freaking delicious. So don't forget to get some napkins before stuffing your face.I do have to say that the nopal (cactus) is a bit of an acquired taste. The texture is a bit like cooked celery and the flavor is bland, but unique. I got the nopal plate and added meat to it, which was pretty good.

I hear people groaning when they eat these because they are so good. Pair with some chips and guac and nice glass of Horchata, and you are set. The Horchata has the perfect amount of cinnamon and is quite refreshing. There is a salsa station, but you really don't need all that stuff, the tacos are perfectly dressed when they come to you. However, I must say, their hot salsa is on point. The service is fantastic too. My mom wanted a side of beans to go with her chicken taco, but they said they only serve them with their cactus taco and do not sell it separately.

Even though it comes with pineapple, which I don't consider to be the authentic version of an al pastor taco, but it works in Los Tacos No. 1's version. My bias comes from eating tacos from Mexican families in California most of my life, very few taco joints in New York beat the west in the 'taco' category. Los Tacos No.1 tacos, come close, and is a great option if you're looking for something beyond the traditional carnita taco with cilantro and onions. I would be glad to eat here more, but their tacos are very messy and the line usually winds past the Nutbox, past the spice vendor, and almost to the waterfall, which is just too long of a wait for a quick bite.*Update, I've learned the owners are originally from the west coast, they hail from California and Tijuana.

Located in the buzzling Chelsea Market, it's hard to miss Los Tacos and the long line it attracts. The line is always pretty long, but it moves quickly. Make sure to have cash on hand. But enough about the location....Everything about the taco was done right. The tortilla. The beef. The chicken. The salsa. The pico de gallo. I don't think I have ever eaten a taco so fast in my life. The flour tortillas are seriously the perfect thickness. I think what distinguishes a great taco from a good taco is the salsa, and that is certainly the case at Los Tacos. The salsas are so flavorful. I would sample them in the salsa cuphodlers before placing them all over the taco because the spicier of the two has a kick and may be spicier than you'd like. The horchata was a nice addition on the side, but nothing life changing. I would pass on the chips altogether.The only con I can think of is that there's limited seating in Chelsea Market, but that's more of a Chelsea Market problem and less of a Los Tacos problem.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

Los Tacos No.1 exceeded my expectations and really makes me want to go back to NY just to go eat these tacos. Los Tacos is located inside the Chelsea Market.Customer Service - The employees were friendly and helpful, especially when I asked which tacos they would recommend. The service was fast and I got the correct order.Food - I ended up getting the pork (adobada) and steak (carne asada) on the corn tortilla. My friend and I were exploring the market and wanted to try a little bit of everything from the stores, so we decided to only order one taco each. They were a good size (snack if you just eat one, and a meal if you eat two I guess). The pork taco - I got everything on mine which included included some onions, peppers, salsa, guacamole, pork and some lime juice. It is a messy taco so be sure to have lots of napkins :) It was juicy and the pork had tons of flavour - smokey. Adding the lime helped cut the creaminess of the sauces, and really gave the taco a refreshing taste. It makes you want to order another one!CAUTION: I like spicy food but the medium salsa had some kick in it for me. So if you don't like spicy foods but want to try out the salsa, just put some on the side of your plate and try it before you dump a spoonful on your taco.Seating - There are NO seats, so if you are planning on sitting and eating, you will need to walk around with your food to find a spot to sit.

I grew up eating a lot of tacos in LA so there is something special here. First off, they use fresh ingredients and even their tortillas are freshly made there. The portion size is perfect and the taste is amazing. The adobado taco is one of my favorites. It has a slight spicy tang to it. I also love the steak tacos and the guac sauce they put on it. The price is very reasonable for what you are getting. It is about 3.50 a taco. They also take card and also after you get your taco you can put fresh salsa and pick De gallo.

Â I don't know what the heck is in their marinade but that pork was amazing. After the quesadilla was pulled from the flat top the fellas asked what toppings I wanted.

The one thing I have to say is that these tacos are not the crunchy kinds..so the shell is soft and I had the corn/wheat shell with steak, pollo and nopal cactus. it was amazing. The juiciness of the toppings do tend to make it a little sloppy with the juice oozing out. WHATEVER i just ate it like a homeless person, which makes it taste all that much better.

Even the medium spicy salsa was enough to burn my tongue (in a completely good way). The horchata definitely helped me cool down. Not to mention, it is also just such a delicious drink. Now, moving on to the tacos. The steak one was great, very juicy and flavorful. But if I were to go back and order again, I would ditch the steak and just have the MARINATED PORK. When I bit into the pork, the favors literally exploded in my mouth. The pork was slightly crunchy but also so tender at the same time.

So when my friend and I were on our way out of Chelsea Market and I spied with my little eye the words ""pollo asado"" and ""taco"" my feet just sorta walked their way over to Los Tacos No.1. It's like that sometimes. When you put ""Asado"" instead of just ""pollo"" or ""grilled chicken"" on a menu - you better come through for me.

Although on the cheaper side for NY standards, it still was expensive for a taco. Nonetheless, I filled up on two tacos and a soda, so perhaps they're more filling than these little guys give away.I like that they have the salsas and limes on the tables, so you can add however much you'd like to your food.

Hands down this place serves some of the best carne asada, adobo & grilled cactus (yes you vegans! You heard right! cactus! so you have a choiceeee!!!) I have tried in NYC! This coming from a Mexican that lived in LA and currently resides in the Bay Area northern Cal where Mexican cuisine (and tacos) is abundant. The asada is so rich in taste, juicy, and the cactus straight out of the grill, slightly charred that allows the taste to drop from your mouth once you dig your teeth on it, my Mexican mouth was orgasming in the well blend of freash corn tortilla, salsa, onion & cilantro that gets sprinkled on top. The meats are so rich in taste that it left my mouth watering and wanting for more!. Handmade corn tortillas is a + and an added star for this. The salsas are good but to be honest you probably don't need them on your tacos since the culinary chemists inside (aka taqueros) present your taco in a wrapped paper which showcases technique and finesse (ok maybe i'm just over reacting to this but trust me, they're worth it) that you often don't see in a taco place. I have still yet to try the rest of their selections but next time (""I'll be back"", ok Arnold) i'm back to NYC i shall try them. This place is worth trying it and i give it 4.5 stars total.

Very tender yet not overly juicy or oily. The meat is the main attraction at this place for sure. Back to the queso shell, like I said it was really good, but nothing extraordinary. Its exactly how you'd expect a queso taco shell to taste to be honest.

There are also huge bowls of pico and other salsas to top your tacos yourself. The adobada and carne asada tacos are amazing - the meat is tender and you get jam packed flavor with every bite. The tacos are about $3.50-$4.00 but they're worth every penny. I definitely recommend this place for anyone in the area!",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

I got the chicken quesadilla which is open faced which was unexpected but it was loaded with fresh toppings, chicken, cheese homemade corn tortilla, pico, guac and fresh squeezed lime. I just grabbed a fork ate a little off the top and then folded it like a taco and ate it, the flavors were fresh and just the right about if spice it was amazing.

Better to come on a weekday when it is less crowded, though I can see why people would be willing to wait for a taco. The ingredients are fresh and the corn tortillas are perfect (though I haven't tried the flour ones... just why would you?).I'm a huge fan of the carne asada taco, sometimes adobada when I want something a little saltier/more seasoned. I've recently ordered a quesadilla and it's a new favorite--adobada or carne asada, once again. I find that the carne asada is great for people who don't want too much saltiness.Despite the busyness of the place, the people who work at the cashier have been very nice and patient with my occasional floundering-of-the-wallet. +1 This place, Dizengoff, and Seed & Mill are my go-tos in Chelsea Market for sure.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

I get that you can get way cheaper tacos from a decent truck, but Los Tacos No. 1 is like the luxury version of a good taco truck. The flavors are a bit more subdued but that's because the quality and preparation of the meat is ever so slightly more consistent than a truck where sometimes you get too much sinew and meat that is a touch too chewy. Is it going to compare to what you can get in Mexico or the west coast probably not, but it's pretty damn close.

The toppings include: guacamole, onions, cilantro (these three are put on by the chef while the rest is self serve), salsa verde (kind of spicy), red salsa (I didn't have it but it's usually spicier than the verde), fresh cilantro salsa, and limes. I also had a cup of horchata and it was pretty good. Not very sweet, which I was happy about but I know some people prefer it to be sweeter.

But after trying their tacos, I can see why there's always a long line and it's DEFINITELY worth the wait. Everything about their tacos are perfect.THE TORTILLA: My number one complaint about tacos is the tortilla because it always takes over the taste of the filling. But Los Tacos have perfected their tortilla but making it thin but not too thin. It perfectly envelops the fillings and does not take away any taste of the fillings. It is simply a soft counterpart that exemplifies the fillings.THE AVOCADO: Their avocado is so well made that it just melts in your mouth. It's not thick and it's more like a puree. The way it just covers the top of the taco is just beautiful.THE MEATS: pollo, carne, you name it. It's all good. Perfect seasoning, perfect tenderness. You cannot go wrong with their meats.THE VEGETABLES: It's there and it adds a slight crispiness to each bite of the taco. It's not overpowering and adds flavor to each bite. THE SALSA: Whether you like a kick in your taco or not, add the salsa. It's still good without the salsa but the added spiciness just finishes the flavor profile of the taco.

My previous favorites were in Bushwick, Sunset Park and Queens, but inconsistency, a fire, and the fact that nobody wants to go to Queens has left Los Tacos No. 1's adobada in sole possession of first place. Let me give you some advice:Anytime you are at a restaurant and there is meat that they will carve off a spit and serve you, you should get it. Immediately after seeing the spit, I wanted to get two adobada tacos. But in the interest of variety, I got one adobada and one carne asada. HUGE MISTAKE. (Your first instinct is always right, people.*)While the carne asada and the pollo asada are both excellent (seriously, fantastic tacos in their own right), pork is always the right decision. Really, I'm betting anything you get on a fresh corn tortilla** will probably be good here...but any space the inferior meats of beef and chicken take up in your stomach is space you cannot fill with the crispy, fatty, juicy explosion of flavor that is the adobada. I've always known these marinated pork and pineapple flavors as al pastor, but whatever you want to call it, it's ridiculously delicious and all I can think about is going back for more._____________*Even if it tells you to slap that 250 lb. man for his insolence. **I can't abide a crappy, grainy, cold, corn tortilla (I'd actually rather have flour), but Los Tacos No. 1 does corn tortillas right.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

Taste, I would go with a five. Experience, way less.To begin, yes the line is long, but it's pretty worth it and it goes by fairly quickly. It gets a little crowded at the end because you have to get your receipt andâ âhand itâ âpersonally to the chef so they can make your order.ââ Of course, since it's in the Chelsea Market, there's nowhere to really sit.The prices are a little steep for a little taco (~$3.75), but it's packed with great flavor! The way they season their chicken and steak and the fact that they make their own tortillas from scratch right the makes a huge difference.I got the steak taco with a corn tortilla and my boyfriend got a steak taco and a chicken taco with a corn tortilla along with a steak quesadilla (FYI the quesadilla is just a taco with cheese in itâ - oddâ). Overall, the food was really good. The best taco I've had in NYC (the steak one). I'm from the West Coast and haven't been able to find a decent Mexican Taco in NYC. This has definitely been the best so far.The reason I am only giving them 3 stars is because I had asked three times if there was any dairy in the taco and I was assured there was not. They mentioned the guac in the cactus taco did, but that was it. So, I got my steak taco and devoured it. Needless to say, I had one of the worst nights of my life a couple hours later. I am lactose intolerant, if I had an allergy the situation would have been much worse. For this reason, unfortunately, I cannot give them 5 stars. âEspecially when it comes to dietary restrictions, your staff should be educated and not make faulty mistakes like that.âOther than that, I would highly recommend this place.

929,skW4f7TQBAM7WUg08H5yOg,Sierra B.,5.0 star rating,"I seem to always find myself here whilst gallivanting around the meatpacking district. This is the perfect place to stop at if you're going to a booze fest at Milk Studios or Highline Stages and aren't sure if food will be served (and the backdoors at Chelsea Market are adjacent to these venues, haha). The quality and price of the tacos is unmatched in the neighborhood and it is one of the cheaper eateries in the market ($3.50 - $4.75 per taco). Everything on the menu is good; take your pick. I am preferential to the pollo asado because the chicken is perfectly marinated. The carne asado (grilled steak) and adobada (marinated pork) are fantastic, too. The later comes with strips of pineapple creating a piquant sweet & spicy contrast with the pork. Two tacos are enough to leave you satiated, but I certainly attempt a third on many occasions. I alternate between the flour and corn tacos but if you want a more authentic experience go with the corn.There are a number of toppings you can add to your tacos, but try not to go overboard; the food is already well seasoned. A splash of lime should be sufficient. Wash the tacos down with a glass of horchata or tamarind juice.

The texture and flavor of these tortillas are fantastic. I wish I could buy them! I actually don't like the taste of corn tortillas, but that's probably because they're not freshly made. You don't get these flavors from those ""authentic Mexican places."" They usually put two grainy, dry tortillas with chewy meat and no salsa, with a bland guacamole sauce. The only issue I have, is that you have to stand to eat these tacos. These tacos can be a lil messy. I hope they expand.. I'd love to sit down and see just a few additions to their menu.

It's literally just a walk-up-and-order place, there are no tables so good luck finding a place to eat. The line can get really long, so try to get there before the lunch rush starts or you'll be waiting for a bit. However, they do move the line along at a decent clip so don't worry too much. They prepare everything right out in front of you as you wait so there is nothing to hide, and everything looks very clean and appetizing.Bathroom: In Chelsea Market, yes. Clean, inviting, but a line can also easily develop here as well.Staff: The cashier, and also food prep people, move the line along pretty well. They are all friendly and are more than willing to help you with your order if you're not a regular (which 99% of the visitors are NOT).Food: We ran the gamut of their tacos, trying each one. I would not recommend the cactus one, but the rest of them are very tasty and very enjoyable. Honestly, you can't go wrong with your choice, just pick something you like (I think the beef was the best though...)Value: It's a popular place because the food is great, but the prices won't put you in the poor house either.This is a cool little taco spot that I'd come back to again - however I'd make sure to arrive early because the line we waited in was just a bit too long (of a wait).",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

As a pescatarian, I was slightly disappointed that there were no other options for me (in tacos) other than the nopal (cactus) but since I'd never had it before, I was game. For $4, I got one taco served open on a small plate with everything on it. While they were generous with the cactus, I found it to be too slimey and got tired of it fast. I think it lacked flavor and the texture was just meh. The guac was really good though and I wish they had put more. The cilantro was also the right amount and not overpowering, something a lot of mexican rests overdo. Â I like the serve your self station where you can add mild, medium, spicy, or lime to your tacos (the spicy was great) and the large selection of sodas.

If Instagram could make cones look so good, well sign me up then!I must say I was skeptical of Los Tacos and thought it would all be hype. People in the past have told me Ottos Tacos was the best, or Taqueria Diana in the LES-- I fell victim to their strong opinions and tried the places myself but was utterly disappointed with both--their tacos were somewhat bland, meat was dry, and corn tortillas were too thick. Alas. Los Tacos entered my life and ended my mistrust in finding good tacos. One bite and I'm telling you--they truly were THE BEST TACOS. Chicken was moist and perfectly charred, all the toppings (onions, cilantro, 2 types of salsa, and guac--uhh free guac with no extra charging is unheard of!!) married so well. If only my marriage will be that good... Best part yet was that the corn tortilla was so fricken' fresh and not too thick or thin.

Deep within the recesses of Chelsea Market, you'll find a steaming counter in the distance, way at the end of a very, very long line. The masses line up for these scrumptious vittles, and I did, too. Said line goes pretty quickly and if you're not ready with your order at the end of it, be prepared for some looks, fella -- these patrons are for real. Word on the street is the adobada is the way to goo, but if you're allergic to pineapple (like me) or don't eat pork (like my buddy), you're still covered: the pollo asado is truly delectable, what with it's exceptional mix of spices and smoke from the grill. The carne is equally as good, but the pollo has a leg-up on texture. Add a squeeze of lime, a heaping spoon full of salsa fresca and you're golden, friend. Choose from corn or flour tortilla, and if you want cheese, order a quesadilla -- there' the same size as the tacos, but include melted choose courtesy of grilling over a wood-burning flame. In all honest, I've not had tacos this excellent outside of California. They're the real deal. Paired with one of their full-on sugar Mexican sodas, and you'll forget you're in a super-gentrified area of NYC. Just don't expect to relax.

We both had one pork taco- it was amazing and the steak quesadilla (not quite what you are used to) but they used super fresh ingredients. The spicy salsa was AWESOME! The chips and guac were also very tasty. I left full and felt like it was a pretty good deal. Really friendly staff- they provided recommendations and checked in on our experience throughout; they also hooked us up with a free order of chips and guac since we were still eating when they were closing down. It was also nice to see them deep cleaning their kitchen at the end of the night! As someone who used to work in F&B, I love a clean kitchen!

968,qq9fakOIrNBe-nwRm59jPQ,Anderson C.,4.0 star rating,"Whenever people ask me on recommendations on Tacos I either steer them towards Five Tacos or here at Los Tacos No.1. Truly, they are probably some of the best if not a top contender for the 1st and 2nd ranking in the taco world in NYC.But I think after last night's binge tasting I think they might be just be tied at 2nd place with 1st still open for the taking. Â SERVICE : Was close to being on point. The lady cashier expedited orders with ease and even though there wasn't a line waiting we all ordered, paid and moved on to the food side of things rather quickly. Â The 2nd part of the service was just as quick which is great BUT when I asked for extra onions and was given practically 3 little cubes of it due to the food assembler rushing through to get the tacos stuffed, I feel the service took a slight step backwards here. As much as you should be expediting food, listening should be just as important. There wasn't a line so the whole rushing thing I didn't really understand. It was also NOT Lunch time, happy hour, nor was it a dinner rush. Â You close in an hour. Slow down homie. And even if there were the speed that this guy was scooping, stuffing, and wrapping made it seem like he was trying to finish the order to go use the restroom. He could have just said something. I would have gladly waited.FOOD: This was also close to being on point. I ordered 4 different taco(s) Nopal (Cactus), Adobada (Spicy Pork), Pollo Asada (Grilled Chicken), Carne Asada (Grilled Steak). Â The cactus tacos was WAAAYYYY off the mark. I don't even know how to describe it. It just didn't taste right. Â The spicy pork was good but I felt it was lacking a certain kick to it. The chicken and the steak was the stars which came through on both flavor and expectation. The tacos are also on the smaller size very similar to Otto's except here they offer you the choose of corn or flour for your taco shell.AMBIANCE: This space is kind of a clusterfukc. The storefront is actually a health nut store. Across from it is MokBar which is a Korean noodle soup which offers seating & happy hour. Then you have Los Tacos No.1 to the far right which offers no seating whatsoever. I hate to imagine what happens when the health nuts store gets busy during a lunch rush for MokBar and the a taco rush for that same lunch crowd. 8 words. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THERE FOR THAT. Even if Los Tacos No.1 offered seats, they would have no place to put it. If I was going to get tacos on the go, I'd go to a taco truck.PRICE: The price is on the higher side partially due to the location of Chelsea Market, partially to there wide fan base, partially to Yelp and then partially because New Yorkers are willing to pay as much. They are priced competitively to those of Otto's & Five Tacos so I guess for better quality in Manhattan you need to fork out more cash for quality tacos.Overall: I would say they are at a 4 star for me but more like 3.5 stars after that cactus tacos.
