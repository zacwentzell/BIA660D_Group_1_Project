It's never been my number one (I find it a little too soupy), but finding myself in the area, this was an easy pick for lunch.Around noon, the line wasn't bad at all and took under 5 minutes. I did a chicken on corn and a nopal on flour for a combined ~$7. $5 minimum for credit card. No seating, so stand where you get the tacos or try to steal some space away from other vendors. You'll need a counter or table as these get a little messy. If you get them ""with everything,"" you really won't need any of the garnishes, as I think it's a good amount of spice and sauce. However, grab some radish for a palate cleanser when you're done.The chicken on corn was magnificent. Great flavor, tender, tasty. I'm from Houston, know my tacos, yadda yadda, and this is great stuff. The corn tortilla was a must-order as it held up to the messiness.Nopal was more of a mixed bag. It was slightly overcooked and slimy, and the tortilla completely fell apart by the end. The taste was also a bit one dimensional and jalapeno-y, but you'll get that with nopal.

That being said once I found it I was very happy. It's counter ordering so take out style. You put your order in then go give them cooks a little detail on what you want inside your taco. They hand you your order and then you chow down. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars has nothing to do with the food or service but that there is not really anywhere to seat down and enjoy your food(but that is more of an issue of the Chelsea market ).Now to get to the food the tacos were out of this world or should I say straight from Mexico.

Once you order with the counter, you are sent to the back and are motioned by people who take your receipt and make the tacos fresh and right in front of you.

(he said for these little one). The price aren't expensive, it's worth it every penny because it's that good which right now I'm craving for them right now.

I've spent most of my time in the mid Atlantic or New York City. These are the best tacos I've ever had. I've had a lot of tacos in my life, but mainly in regions that aren't really known for them. Los tacos loads your corn soft shells with juicy delicious meat cooked to perfection. Their vegetables taste fresh and their salsas actually taste good and the spicy ones are actually spicy (take note everyone else). What it comes down to is this: I'll travel an absurd amount of time to their annoying location in Chelsea market to fulfill my taco craving.Long lines lead to this casual stand looking spot, where there is only standing tables to eat at. But the people behind the counter are veterans at moving the line along and preparing your food ASAP. And despite the demand, the tacos are priced like most tacos around the city. You just can't beat Los Tacos No 1. Atmosphere: 5/5 (casual standing - feels authentic)Food: 5/5 (I want to give a 6)Service: 5/5 Value: 5/5",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

Located in Chelsea Market, this place gets busy and I mean very busy. It's located in one of the sub locations with several restaurants and this one has a line all the way to the main area. Food is cheap, around $3-5 an item. However, the food is not huge so definitely order several and order a variety. Very cool that you take your order then hand it to one of the chefs who pump out the order in less than a few seconds they work so quick. Something I did have was a little spicy for my liking, but I'm not sure what it came from because I did not ass spicy salsa or anything. Think there just might be some spice on the chicken or meat but wasn't anything crazy that I couldn't handle. You get to add your own salsa to the items that's served near the pick up area. There is sadly really no where to seat so you need to either eat at the counter where you picked up the food or find somewhere else to eat in Chelsea market.All in all, authentic Mexican food at a good price that is served fast!",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

You aaalllready know it's as good as I'm about to tell you it is! Los Tacos No. 1 named their taco shop being hopeful and confident but now they are, in fact, No. 1 in NYC. If you go on the weekend, yes it will probably be busy and you'll have to wait in line but delicious tacos wait for you at the end of that line. There's a counter where you take your ticket for your tacos to be made and picked up and you can totally eat there but be prepared for random strangers reaching over you for all of the limes, radishes, etc. I don't mind because it takes maybe 5 minutes to eat 2-3 tacos. If you want to preserve your personal bubble, there's spots and tables scattered throughout the market where you can enjoy your food.The most important thing is that these tacos are damn good. I really like the carne asada and adobada tacos. When you give them your ticket, tell them if you want flour or corn and which toppings (onion, cilantro, avocado sauce). Live a little and get everything on it. Their service is nice and quick! The second time I visited I tried the fried quesadilla. Super guilty but soooo good.

Also get the cheese tortilla instead of flour or corn (it does cost extra though).Food: 4   Taste- 5   Presentation- 3.5Atmosphere/Aesthetic: 4.5Service- 4.5Price/Value- 4.5I got the chicken taco (pollo asado) with cheese tortilla substitute and it came out to $5.75. The cheese tortilla is bigger than the flour or corn tortillas so I was satisfied with just one taco. With the price and quality of food, this place is so dang good even for New York standards. Love how they have self-serve choices when it comes to spice. I put a hefty amount of medium spice on and a little bit of mild spice. The mild spice was essentially just tomatoes and a little pepper, and I regretted putting it on there because the tomatoes were a little cold. The taco was one of the messiest things I've ever eaten, but also easily one of the best tacos I've ever had. I gave the atmosphere a high rating because it's in Chelsea Market, so even though it's a taco place, it feels quite posh.  Los Tacos itself doesn't really have seating (just some standing eating space) so you may have to walk around a little to find seating. My friend and I sat at the bar area by Very Fresh Noodles. The workers certainly aren't very peppy because they're always swamped with customers, but you can tell they're working at top speed and working to expedite the line. I've never seen people make quality tacos so quickly. The line looked really long, but it goes quickly. I only waited about 12 minutes to order and get my food. Definitely come here.

Surrounded by other great restaurants and shops that give out strong aromas, this place will draw you in as the smell from the Carne Asada and their Adobadas linger through the room. Before heading out to another place to eat dinner, my friend and I decided to stop by for some tacos. I visited this place last year and I really enjoyed their Adobada tacos, so I wanted my friend to try it since it was his first time in NYC. We ordered two tacos which were pretty pricey, but were pretty big, so no complaints.While eating the taco, it brought back 2017 memories of when I first consumed this goodness.

Yesterday was first time coming by to Chelsea market and it's good that I made the trip here to look around.Los tacos were next to mokbar. I wanted tacos and my friend wanted mokbar. I will review my experience with mokbar in their page.I didn't look at everything on the menu but they had steak, chicken, marinated pork and etc. You could choose between corn and flour tortillas.I ordered two steak, one chicken and one marinated pork.When I got them my friend were asking me how much were they which I told him $15.. (he said for these little one). The price aren't expensive, it's worth it every penny because it's that good which right now I'm craving for them right now. In the front they put sauce out, limes, guacamole, and radish where you could grab it and put it on your tacos yourself.There aren't seats so basically standing and eat.

I've spent most of my time in the mid Atlantic or New York City. These are the best tacos I've ever had. I've had a lot of tacos in my life, but mainly in regions that aren't really known for them. Los tacos loads your corn soft shells with juicy delicious meat cooked to perfection. Their vegetables taste fresh and their salsas actually taste good and the spicy ones are actually spicy (take note everyone else). What it comes down to is this: I'll travel an absurd amount of time to their annoying location in Chelsea market to fulfill my taco craving.Long lines lead to this casual stand looking spot, where there is only standing tables to eat at. But the people behind the counter are veterans at moving the line along and preparing your food ASAP. And despite the demand, the tacos are priced like most tacos around the city. You just can't beat Los Tacos No 1. Atmosphere: 5/5 (casual standing - feels authentic)Food: 5/5 (I want to give a 6)Service: 5/5 Value: 5/5",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

Located in Chelsea Market, this place gets busy and I mean very busy. It's located in one of the sub locations with several restaurants and this one has a line all the way to the main area. Food is cheap, around $3-5 an item. However, the food is not huge so definitely order several and order a variety. Very cool that you take your order then hand it to one of the chefs who pump out the order in less than a few seconds they work so quick. Something I did have was a little spicy for my liking, but I'm not sure what it came from because I did not ass spicy salsa or anything. Think there just might be some spice on the chicken or meat but wasn't anything crazy that I couldn't handle. You get to add your own salsa to the items that's served near the pick up area. There is sadly really no where to seat so you need to either eat at the counter where you picked up the food or find somewhere else to eat in Chelsea market.All in all, authentic Mexican food at a good price that is served fast!",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

You aaalllready know it's as good as I'm about to tell you it is! Los Tacos No. 1 named their taco shop being hopeful and confident but now they are, in fact, No. 1 in NYC. If you go on the weekend, yes it will probably be busy and you'll have to wait in line but delicious tacos wait for you at the end of that line. There's a counter where you take your ticket for your tacos to be made and picked up and you can totally eat there but be prepared for random strangers reaching over you for all of the limes, radishes, etc. I don't mind because it takes maybe 5 minutes to eat 2-3 tacos. If you want to preserve your personal bubble, there's spots and tables scattered throughout the market where you can enjoy your food.The most important thing is that these tacos are damn good. I really like the carne asada and adobada tacos. When you give them your ticket, tell them if you want flour or corn and which toppings (onion, cilantro, avocado sauce). Live a little and get everything on it. Their service is nice and quick! The second time I visited I tried the fried quesadilla. Super guilty but soooo good.

Also get the cheese tortilla instead of flour or corn (it does cost extra though).Food: 4   Taste- 5   Presentation- 3.5Atmosphere/Aesthetic: 4.5Service- 4.5Price/Value- 4.5I got the chicken taco (pollo asado) with cheese tortilla substitute and it came out to $5.75. The cheese tortilla is bigger than the flour or corn tortillas so I was satisfied with just one taco. With the price and quality of food, this place is so dang good even for New York standards. Love how they have self-serve choices when it comes to spice. I put a hefty amount of medium spice on and a little bit of mild spice. The mild spice was essentially just tomatoes and a little pepper, and I regretted putting it on there because the tomatoes were a little cold. The taco was one of the messiest things I've ever eaten, but also easily one of the best tacos I've ever had. I gave the atmosphere a high rating because it's in Chelsea Market, so even though it's a taco place, it feels quite posh.  Los Tacos itself doesn't really have seating (just some standing eating space) so you may have to walk around a little to find seating. My friend and I sat at the bar area by Very Fresh Noodles. The workers certainly aren't very peppy because they're always swamped with customers, but you can tell they're working at top speed and working to expedite the line. I've never seen people make quality tacos so quickly. The line looked really long, but it goes quickly. I only waited about 12 minutes to order and get my food. Definitely come here.

Surrounded by other great restaurants and shops that give out strong aromas, this place will draw you in as the smell from the Carne Asada and their Adobadas linger through the room. Before heading out to another place to eat dinner, my friend and I decided to stop by for some tacos. I visited this place last year and I really enjoyed their Adobada tacos, so I wanted my friend to try it since it was his first time in NYC. We ordered two tacos which were pretty pricey, but were pretty big, so no complaints.While eating the taco, it brought back 2017 memories of when I first consumed this goodness.

There is a sign that states that flour soft tacos are cooked in lard, but the corn are not. In error, my cousin missed this.

After eating their tacos, I understand the craze! I got chicken tacos on flour tortilla. You can see the chefs grilling up the meat and tortillas. The guy heated our tortilla and slapped on the ingredients (they ask you if you want onions, cilantro, tomatoes) and meat. They have a self-serve station consisting of fresh cut lime wedges, salsa, hot sauce, red chillis, and cut radishes. You can add these to your plate per your liking. The tacos tasted great - very authentic, the chicken was cooked well, and the salsa and hot sauce gave the taco a great kick. I squeezed some fresh lime on the taco and took a bite of the red chilli with each bite of taco. However, you have to be able to navigate through the rush. You first order and pay, then move left with your ticket and give it to the cooks. You wait there until the cook prepares and gives you your oder, when you can move on to the condiments/toppings area to fill your plate. You will encounter some people standing in areas they shouldn't be in. For example, a girl was waiting in front of the condiments for a loong time waiting for her order and blocking people from getting to that section. But I guess if you have lived in NY you must be good at navigating through such situations anyways. The reason why I took off one star - One of the employees who was cleaning the counter area where open ingredients were kept, was spraying the disinfectant really close to the open bowls of lime, salsa, etc. While I had my plate on the counter too, she sprayed really close to it ( I want to believe none of it went on my taco but it may have ).",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

They literally only take a couple seconds each Taco to be made. They're so fast! You put on the rest of your condiments, like sauce and lime etc. I got the spicy sauce and added the dried pepper. Must put that on if you like spicy. It isn't crazy spicy but has a nice kick. Staff was super cool and helpful. I really want to go back. Also, amazing how it's in such a beautiful market.

We've also tried the pork taco which wasn't my favorite.  I stuck with what I know and that is the carne asada tacos, you can't go wrong.  *TIP* When the guy making your tacos asks you if you want your taco ""con todo,"" which means with everything on your taco, just say ""yes please,"" you won't be disappointed.  I also recommend ordering the chips and guacamole as well, to finish off your tacos with.  They also have some pico de gallo there as well.This is the perfect place to grab some great tasting tacos right after having drinks at some of the cool bars/restaurants in Chelsea Market.  Don't expect $1.50 tacos here like we get in Texas, be prepared to pay $3.75 for each taco, but hey those are New York prices.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

Solely grilling or pan-frying does not achieve that same addicting flavor that these places in Mexico and Los Angeles have achieved. Look up El Fogon in Mexico, El Flamin Taco in Los Angeles, and of course Los Tacos #1; they are all cooked the same way. This is true Al Pastor/Adobada style and don't forget the pineapple!

I came on a rainy day, so there wasn't heavy traffic like normal, and I saw that the shells were already prepared, which means they were a little dry. You want that fresh shell.

Los Tacos No. 1 is located inside of Chelsea Market so for those who have never been here, please note this!Los Tacos No. 1 is known for their gracious tacos and since it was a Tuesday, it was the perfect day to order tacos from them for Taco Tuesdays! The tacos were indeed delicious- the steak being the most favorite with corn tortilla. My husband and I also had the chicken and pork taco along with the chicken quesadilla. Still, the steak one rings the best. If you're looking to take out, make sure that the staff member making your tacos know that. They put an aluminum foil over it. As for the salsa, they have mild, medium and spicy out on display for self-serve. I'm not sure how sanitary this is since it is flu season and everyone is dipping and diving in there. But will I be back? Yes, of course. The only improvements I would suggest is to offer a better way to pack ""take out,"" especially for those traveling far and to offer already pre-packed salsa so one doesn't have to be holding up the line for the self-serve salsa, trying to package everything.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

Next door, not easy to find,  is their sister restaurant, Los M-something--where you can buy fish tacos & I was able to sit there, thanks to VERY, VERY NICE & HELPFUL STAFF. Next time I'm also getting at least one or two fish tacos. I will definitely be back.

My standards have been set very high and in all honesty if it isn't Arizona California or MEXICO most other places disappoint with authentic Mexican food. Los Tacos #1 definitely changed my perceptions of NYC Mexican food. The street tacos were pricey for the size but I guess it's the markup (each taco avg $3.25-$3.75). Carne asada, pollo, pork and veggie - pro they come with everything ""con todo"" guac cheese onions cilantro pico. There are different levels of spicy salsas available at the side wall.

The Carne Asada taco is good, but the Adobada is seriously where it's at! The pork is SO much more tender, juicy, and flavorful. Plus the slices of fresh pineapple really push it over the edge and take it to next level taco heaven. Seriously salivating just thinking about it! The only major difference between Los Tacos and my fave LA taco places is the price. But really, that's hard to compare since Los Tacos is located in such a hot NYC neighborhood where tacos are scarce (so demand wayyy exceeds supply) versus in LA where there are just so many cheap taco options that price competition is fierce.

Don't worry too much, the line moves fairly quick. Step 2) order the food at the counter and make sure to keep the receipt since you shall need it later. Sure the tacos are pricy if compared to all the boroughs or food trucks, but as compared to some other taco places in this particular neighborhood this is actually pretty good (some restaurants in this area charge a lot just for sauce... see my previous reviews for details). For tacos; they have carne asada (grilled steak), chicken, cactus, and adobada  (marinated pork).  Step 3) give your receipt to the kitchen ( try to remember your order. They ask if you want flour or corn tortillas. Also you can ask for everything on it which can include  guac (no extra charge). Also tell them if you want a to go order or not. The kitchen later calls out your order and you take it. Step 4) after you get your food, go to the middle of the counter to the sauce station. Grab a container or a few containers and fill them with sauces; pico de Gallo, and multiple types of hot sauce. You can also grab some lime wedges and napkins. The nice part is you can get however much sauce or combination of sauces as you want.I tried both the steak and the pork. The tacos were juicy and flavorful. They are a small size so you will need several. Fyi: no seating area for this specific restaurant so you can grab your food and take it to one of the seating areas in Chelsea market, or you could take it to a waterside park like I did and enjoy your food by the water on a towel (great for a picnic).",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

I refused to try anything else because the tacos were calling my name, lol.-By the time I came to order, there was a large crowd gathering by the counter but it was moving at a good pace. There is a large board on the side with their menu and pricing. Tacos range from $3.25-$3.75 and Quesadillas, Chips with Salsa/Guacamole and Sodas are also sold here. -I went with the popular Carne Asada and Pollo, both on a flour tortilla. The carne asada taco was a bit on the chewy side, almost a medium done. Plus, it lacked flavor even with the salsa and guacamole on top. My favorite was pollo asado :-)  (grilled chicken) So juicy, flavorful and mouth watering deliciously good! The chicken was grilled perfectly, the taco was soft and fresh and one chicken taco was not enough :o) One bite in and it was over before I could relish the spicy and mouth watering flavors! Yo quiero más! I want more! They serve your tacos on a small cake size plate and it's to go, as I didn't see any seating.  The carne asada tacos weren't my thing because I'm not a fan of beef and I just wanted to give it a try.

Since we were already passing through Chelsea Market, we decided to give it a try.Atmosphere:The line was very long on a Saturday afternoon, as expected, but it went by pretty quickly. It's made for fast, casual dining, so there were no seats or anything like that. Most people just ate while standing by the counter. The decor was fun, colorful, and looked nice!Food:We both ordered carne asada tacos on corn tortillas. I was excited to see that they were very generous with the amount of meat in the tacos. I went with some simple toppings and only sprinkled some fresh lime juice on mine, but that first bite was super delicious. The tortilla was warm, the onions added some crunch, the cilantro added flavor, and the meat was tender and tasty. (My boyfriend isn't a huge fan of cilantro, but even he said that they added the perfect amount to compliment the flavor of the meat.) My boyfriend ended up getting the guac and some salsa on his, and he was very pleased with both as well.I've tried a lot of tacos, including some while visiting Mexico, and these ones are pretty authentic and yummy in taste, but they are super small in size, which was a little disappointing.Price:The major downside to this place was definitely the price. $4 seems pretty cheap on the surface, but the tacos are still basically bite-sized. I'd probably need to eat around 5 or 6 of them to actually get full, which would cost me over $20.

108,NPgbyvTPCUrLY2nCSLXzOA,Ram P.,5.0 star rating,"This place makes some insanely delicious and authentic Mexican tacos. I went here during my brief three day visit to NYC. It was so good I literally went two or three times during my short stay. This is a fast casual dining restaurant with no seats, most people eat by the counter. You order at the cashier's and then you are given a ticket which you then hand to the line workers. They make the tacos insanely fast and they are generous with the meat. The first time I went I ordered one Pollo asado taco and one carne asada taco. The first bite was phenomenal, the corn tortillas are warm and the meat is seasoned so perfectly. As a big fan of Mexican food I can say these are the best tacos I've ever had anywhere. After eating the two I ordered one more of each and enjoyed every bite. I had to hold back from getting more haha. I will warn you the avocado salsa Verde is VERY spicy. Keep that in mind if you are sensitive to spicyness.Overall this is a must try in NYC city if you want some delicious food. I could not get enough of this place after my first visit so I literally went out of my way to come back again the next day. You will not regret coming here and Chelsea market is a great place for good eats. I will absolutely make a stop here the next time I go to NY.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

Thankfully, I was wrong and the food here was SO GOOD. My recommendations are the Carne Asada taco and the Pollo Asada taco with everything on them. After picking up your tacos, I recommend the ""spicy"" sauce which is not only hot but also contains a ton of flavor.PRICE(3/5)Even with how good the food was, paying $3.75 for a taco is pretty steep in my opinion.New York isn't known for Mexican food, but this place will change your mind.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

The significant other agreed but didn't like how one small taco was $3.75.He ordered the carne asada taco, which is grilled steak. It was pretty tasty and filled to capacity. He mentioned how it was good, but would prefer to taste more of the meat versus filling it with fluff ingredients. I liked it as it. :)So if you get the especial quesadilla then you're getting a fried one. The first menu we encountered didn't have this specification that it was fried. Only after paying and staying in front of the cook line that you see a more in-depth menu.Needless to say, that thing was superb. It was filled with cheese, guacamole (I think), and all sorts of other stuff. Yeah. That quesadilla was oily, but it's super different imo and worth at least a try if you haven't before. There's also a cactus taco if you haven't had one of those. There's a line here so if you're hungry, plan ahead. Even after paying, you sort of stand in another area/line and wait for the cooks to ask for your order sheet. Los Tacos No. 1 is located inside of Chelsea Market.

It is definitely the best taco I have ever had. The flavor was on point. It came with a pineapple salsa that paired so well. I recommend trying the adobada, hands down.

Wait in line, place your order, and pay, hand your ticket off to a guy behind the next counter, and your order should come out less than five minutes later. While constantly slammed with customers, the staff are as friendly as can be, and can customize your tacos on the fly. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?The tacos at Los Tacos No.1 are $3.00 a pop or $3.75 for carne asada, and while the tacos themselves are on the smaller side, they're absolutely packed with goodies. Sure, you've got the meats onions, cilantro, and guac, but peripheral salsas and other goodies like pineapple slices up the value here tremendously. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?Absolutely excellent, and that didn't come as a surprise given you're watching these tacos made start to finish right in front of your eyes.Freshly crafted tortillas house fresh and flavorful meats that are made all the better thanks to the onions and cilantro, salsas, and meat specific add ons. While I only ordered two (Adobada (pork) and Carne Asada), I immediately wished I'd ordered more. Well done indeed. Dual Stars Granted.

I am usually full with two quesadillas and you can add pico de gallo and mild/spicy sauces if you want. Every time I come it's a really long line but the line moves quickly. But yesterday, I came on a Wednesday night and there was no line! AND Chelsea Market was actually walkable (no tourists)! I think the trick is - don't go on weekends. I think the ordering system is a little confusing and hectic but it works and they are efficient. They give you a receipt after you order and you move down and give your receipt to the people making the tacos, they ask what you want on it. I ask for everything except the salsa because it's spicy. Then you can add pico de gallo or salsas, the green one is spicier I believe. I always get the chicken quesadilla because it's SOO good. The pork quesadilla is also really good but a bit heavy. The nopal is cactus and the texture tastes like okra, personally I don't like it because that sliminess of okra and cactus is an acquired taste. I have not tried the beef taco.You can see them making the tortilla. They put a ball of dough on this tortilla squishing thingy that looks like a waffle maker, and it squishes out a really delicious tortilla.

The tortillas are freshly made so it's pillowy and pliable enough to soak up the savory juices. The marinated pork is super moist and flavorful whilst the pineapple makes the perfect accompaniment. Wash it down with their refreshing and creamy horchata while you're at it. Don't let the lines deter you away since the turn over rate is quick. Also, note that you have to hand your receipt over to the counter to place your order. There isn't any type of seating except for a meniscus counter space located next to the condiment area.

It also had a little kick but not overwhelmingly hot. I liked the way they have all the toppings on the counter for you to choose. It was very clean and sanitary because sometimes that can be hard to manage. There was a line but it moved very fast and the process is efficient.

The turnaround of them serving the food out was quick. Just find a spot in Chelsea market and you got yourself a taco meal!The Adobada was my favorite. The pork was super tender, juicy, well marinated with that adobo flavor. It was huge in portion but fortunately the corn tortilla was strong enough to hold everything. So good!!! I would reorder that 100%. Their carne asada was also very good. Different in flavor balance compared to the adobada. The adobada was heavy in seasoning. The carne asada was more subtle and light I felt, really highlighting the beef. Really good as well. The nopal was an experiment for me because I wanted to try the cactus. It was interesting. I like meats in my taco better but for what it was, it was good. The cactus kind of had the consistency of okra or aloe and had a sour taste to it. I wouldn't personally order it again but a good try nonetheless. There are sauces and limes on the side so you can pile on as much extra salsas and acid as you want.I also got their horchata, rice milk drink.

I got the first three which were chicken, pork, and steak on corn tortillas. Super easy, quick service, and a serve yourself bar for the limes and three different sauce options (mild medium and spicy). I think I might've added too much sauce to the pork tacos because it was too hot for me to decently taste what was in it. The other two were delicious, filled with the right ratio of meat versus other filling and topped with guac. For 6 tacos and a beverage the total was under $30. The card minimum is $5. Next time I come I'll go easy on the sauce and try tasting the other flavors and the guac and chips to give this place a more thorough review.

I liked the carne asada better but both were very good. The size of the tacos are kind of small so you will need at least 2 or 3 to actually fill you up. Everything including the salsa is freshly made and everyone that worked there was very nice. The only thing is that there wasn't anywhere to sit and eat so we just ate standing up st the counter.

I patiently waited in the line that actually moved fairly quickly and I ordered one steak taco and one chicken quesadilla. One thing you have to do is get your receipt and give it to the chef. I didn't know this so I was waiting for the longest time for my food! UghAnyway, whatever... waited my time, got my food, poured like 1/3 of all the tomatoes in the bin they had onto my tacos. Also smothered my tacos in the mild sauce they had. Went outside, grabbed a spot and took a bite... wow. It was pretty amazing, and I don't even like tacos! I ended up devouring my two tacos in like 5 minutes and was trying to figure out what had just happened. After taking a moment to breakdown the flavors, one of the things I appreciated most about this taco was the thin flour layer of the taco... not to mention that the ingredients meshed well together.

Don't be discouraged by the EXTREMELY long line. It moves relatively fast and was served within 15 minutes. The only downside is that there is no where to eat. My friend and I ate on a windowsill. That being said, it only took me a minute to scarf down the 2 tacos I got. Tacos will run you under $4. Steak ones are $3.75 and others are $3.50. I got the chicken and abodaba one. Amazing. So succulent and moist. Just amazing. I can't really say more than that. Now, I'm reluctant to say this part, as I feel that more people will start swarming here, and I already have plans to come back many more times this year, until I start having to getting in shape for summer. There's a secret menu item. You can get any of these tacos in a queso shell, which in essence is a fried cheese shell. That's right, you heard it from me, the shell is made out of solely fried cheese. It is heavenly. A bit on the salty side, but that imperfection makes it perfect, you know?

Not really..but maaaaybe #2 or #3 which is still pretty darn good.. but why? pls hear me out..On a sunny yet chilly/windy Sunday I managed to beat out the laziness and venture to downtown Manhattan Meatpacking District area. The taco place is located pretty deep inside the Chelsea Market. There was a line while I was there at around 12 pm-ish (which is the norm for most popular places NYC - so I expect no less) but fortunately the line moved pretty quickly.So, once it is your turn, choose what you want and pay ahead at the register. Then he would give you a ticket number/receipt. Don't lose it! I was a panicking for a bit since I did not realize this workflow when I asked the cook next door where my order was, and he was just asking me where my receipt was. I did not remember whether the cash register guy instructed me to give the receipt to the cookers on the next section.I luckily found the receipt. Then the cook did my orders quickly and gave me my food. And be mindful, once you get the food, just get out of the way to give space to others waiting for the food. Space is at a premium at NYC, and unfortunately this also applies here. Also, you might need to just enjoy the food somewhere/while walking since no visible seats.For my meal I got:1. Nopales tacos - very interesting cactus texture (it's my 1st time trying!) - has a pretty tangy flavor to it2. Carne Asada tacos - well seasoned, comes with guacamole - small portion (feels like just 1 bite)3. Jamaica drink - very light, refreshing and fruity. Not too sweet.My order was totaled at $11.5 for a total of 2 bite tacos (each taco feels like a bite) and a medium sized drink. Very good food but I can hear my wallet, stomach and mind mildly protesting not to pay those amount of money and give the fullest credit to Los tacos no 1.

Thank goodness for Los Tacos! Located in Chelsea Market, Los Tacos is tucked away in the corner. Their menu is short and simple - four different taco fillings and the option to get it in a taco, quesadilla, or on a plate. You place your order and pay with the cashier then take your receipt to the counter to hand to one of the guys in the back. There you can decide if you want it on a flour or corn tortilla (always corn!). They also have a ""secret"" cheese shell, but be sure to tell your cashier before you hand your ticket to the guys assembling. My favorites are the carne asada and the adobada. I always have to get one of each. The adobado comes with a couple of slices of grilled pineapple. Yum! I love that they not only top your tacos with guac, but that they have a variety of salsas, limes, chilies, and radishes along the counter to let you further customize your tacos.  Overall, Los Tacos is one place you have to visit if you're in the area. The line can get long but it moves pretty quickly. If you're feeling more tacos, I would head next door to Los Mariscos (fish tacos) for round 2!",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

It might seem a bit pricey for a taco ($3.50 for chicken, and $3.75 for steak) but don't underestimate the amount they give you or what the small piece of corn/flour tortilla can hold. They do fill it up and you can add on the extra good stuff after they give you your tacos. But before that you have to get on the line and order. You get a receipt, which you give one of the guys behind the counter for them to start cooking up your order. You seriously have to squeeze your way through everyone crowding around the counter to get that piece of paper to the guy. They ask if you want corn or flour tortilla and spicy or not. Tell them or forever hold your peace. After adding whatever you want on top and remember to get your limes. Then you can dig in! I don't know about you, but I can down these tacos in like three bites for each taco. And no regrets for getting hands dirty and looking like a mess because they definitely satisfy. And it will leaving you wanting more but you will then see the long line and you'll tell yourself that's all you need but deep down inside you want a few more. Or at least that's me.

The queso shell is really good! But also pretty greasy. I would recommend only doing one of your tacos on the queso shell, I prefer it with the steak. It is really filling because they do not skimp on any of the meat or toppings. All the salsas and sauces you need are on the counter where you pick up your tacos.

We got one pollo asado, one carne asada, and two adobada tacos. I really can't argue with all the people that say the adobada is the single best taco in the city -- it is so good, really spicy, and just kind of perfect.

217,d8aTxr9cZORHb1BLHk-V1A,Hannah M.,4.0 star rating,"Are they good? Oh yeah, they're good. Did it live up to the hype? Eh...With only four types of tacos on the menu (Carne Asada, Pollo Asada, Nopal, and Adobada), Los Tacos definitely specializes in what they do best. Sure, there are some other options on the menu, like quesadillas, chips & salsa, and some plates, but the tacos are a must-have. You order at a register, and are presented with a ticket which you then give to one of the chefs on the line. They may or may not ask you about your preferences - I was asked if I wanted everything on the tacos, to which I replied yes, but I wasn't asked whether I wanted corn or flour, which I didn't even know was an option until the next person in line was asked (the default is corn, by the way). The tacos come with all sorts of goodies on top, and the meat was some of the most tender and flavorful I've ever had. The Adobada absolutely melted in my mouth. The salsa bar presents three options, ranging from a very mild pico to a pretty hot red salsa, and there are plenty of fresh limes for the taking. A fourth type of salsa came with the chips that I ordered, which I thought was delicious and packed a pretty solid kick. Tacos will run you about $3.50-$3.75 a piece, and chips were another $3.50 I believe, which I thought was overpriced for the small bag I got. Three tacos will fill you up if you're hungry, two if you're not. Don't get me wrong, the tacos were REALLY good (4.5 stars). Unfortunately I just came with obscenely high expectations. The main curse for Los Tacos is that its location in Chelsea market is just terrible. There's absolutely no seating and eating your tacos on a cramped bench in the middle of the market really kills the whole experience.

It's located in the middle of Chelsea market and the line was pretty long but moved quickly. I showed the cashier a pic of something delicious looking posted on Yelp and she said it's a special quesadilla. I had it with steak and a pork taco with sorrel (called Jamaica here) to wash it down. I had it with everything and added salsa and some type of sauce and fresh lime. It was absolutely amazing. I was wearing a waist trainer so it by the time I was done I was full. My friend on the other hand went back and ordered two more. I did not love her nopal. I've never had it and while it was flavorful it reminded me of sautéed peppers. The quesadilla is fried and overstuffed with cheese and the steak is cooked to absolute perfection and seasoned well. The pork taco is also cooked and seasoned to perfection and the pineapple is the perfect balance of sweet to the spice. Most places double the tortilla but they only give you one so it's a bit messy to eat. The tacos are a bit smaller than I'm used to. That's ok though because the taste more than makes up for it.

There is always a noticeable long line at this particular establishment and i had always made a mental note to try and visit Los Tacos if I got a chance. I was looking at the menu and the cashier was kind enough to let me know that they were closing up soon.  This place serves the meat freshly cooked from a large spit (a method known as al pastor). This is a street style establishment so there is of course no seating.  I chose the pollo asado (grilled chicken) and the adobada (marinated pork) both prepared on tostadas. Had there been more time I would have ordered more food but each selection was topped off with the works (guacamole, onions etc). Both selections were so very messy but so delicious. The service is very quick.  They have a very efficient system for getting the food out in a very timely manner. It leaves little mystery as to why Los Tacos is always busy when I visit Chelsea Market.  The only issue people might have is the no seating but there is seating in certain areas of the market. This type of street food is wildly popular at all times of the year and it is always so satisfying to see the meat freshly cut from the spit.  Eat along. Eat with friends.

There are 4 different types of tacos and I tried 3 of them. I had the pork (Adobada), chicken (Pollo Asado) and beef (carne Asada). All of the tacos are fresh as you can see them cooking in front of you.  It's a bit of chaotic and disorganized once you placed your order. The next step is to tell the cook whether you prefer flour or corn. . It is unclear why I would need to tell the cook/food prep worker whether I want corn or flour. Sure, I have a preference, but Chelsea Market is loud and crowded. I find that many customers has to ask for clarifications when they ask for flour or corn. It could be easily resolved at the registrar and have it printed on your receipt.  Another struggle is that there is a lack of space to eat. It lacks a natural flow to the area  of ordering, speaking with the taco maker, getting the food, and moving along.  I would recommend taking your food to go. Important things to know:1- $ 5 credit card min. no amex2- hand ticker to taquero (who makes the tacos) and tell them flour or corn. I had the flour, but the corn looks better. 3- Get the necessary radish/sauces4- Move out of the way for the next customers",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

I recommend that you try one of each. I also ordered the Horchata which is rice milk. It was okay, I've had better else where. The only downfall about this place is the seating.

I hate long lines so much that I will avoid going to places simply if they're known for having long lines.

Well, it really is THAT good.Having lived in Texas for five years before moving to the east coast, I really developed a fondness for two things: tacos and BBQ. Well, for all the wonderful food that NYC has, guess what are the two things the city generally lacks? Good tacos and BBQ. When it comes to the former, however, I believe that I've found an amazing taco place here in Los Tacos. In fact, it's so tasty that it's not just ""good for NYC""; it's just good, period. Given the high ratings of this place, plus the amount of reviews, clearly I'm not alone in this assessment.Tried all four tacos~ CARNE ASADA, POLLO, ADOBADA, NOPAL; loved them all, but I'd say the Carne Asada and Adobada are the best. Even though the line is long at the place, they get through customers fast and they serve their food quickly. They have lots of fixin's (sauces, cilantro, lime, radish) over to the side.

Just be sure to give your to the receipt to the chefs at the second window (go around everyone lingering!), get the corn tortilla, and get everything on your taco! Also, be sure to load up on the toppings - but not so much as to overwhelm the delicious pork.I so happened to give my ticket to someone just as he was switching out the roasting pork. So after 5-10 minutes, and three times as many people came and went, the chefs noticed and asked me about my ticket.

Los Tacos No. 1 is located inside Chelsea Market. When we got there, the line was fairly long, but moved fairly quick. The type of tacos include pollo (chicken), adobada (pork), nopal (cactus -- I should've tried this), and carne asada (the one I did try). Tacos range from $3.25-$3.75. Seems a bit pricey for just one taco. They also have quesadillas and mulas, neither of which I tried, but looked good.When it was finally our turn, we ordered a bunch of the carne asada tacos since they're pretty small.After you order, make sure you take your receipt to the left side so the cooks can prepare your food for you. Once we handed the cooks our receipt, they made everything with 5-10 minutes. Pretty fast, considering we ordered 8 tacos and there was a crowd.Now, the moment of truth: the first bite. Again, I must emphasize that I am not a taco kind of person. After the first bite, I knew that these were the best tacos I've ever had, simply because I haven't had tacos from many places. Nonetheless, these tacos are definitely worth the price! I only had 3 of the 8 we ordered, and they were sufficient enough for me to get full. If you're living in/visiting NYC and you want a taco, check this place out! Since I'm not a taco kind of person, I would only ""probably"" go back here.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

And of course, we've heard about how awesome Los Tacos No. 1 was so naturally, we had to try stuff here. First, you get up, order, and pay. Then you go to the counter and you give them your ticket? I'm not 100% sure how it works because it was a little confusing since it was our first time there. It can get intimidating at first because it moves quick. Also, the line gets omega long closer to the main lunch period. We're just lucky that we ordered before said line happened. I decided to go with a carne asada taco with a flour tortilla. It was delicious. They pack so much meat onto the taco. And the beef for the carne asada was soooo juicy and seasoned soooo well. I've never had a taco that was so packed and juicy! They also have fresh salsa on the counter for you to grab. Definitely add some of that! It works so very well with the tacos! They also have little containers for you to put the salsa in if you are taking everything to-go. The only downside is that there is no places to sit and enjoy your food. It's mostly the type of food for you to grab and go -- like the many other places inside Chelsea's Market.

Nevertheless, I've always been disappointed in NYC's street taco offerings. I was excited to try Los Tacos, but a little wary that it wouldn't live up to the hype. Located in the center of Chelsea Market, this taco stand is easy to find due to the long line of taco fiends extending far past its boundaries. There is approximately no seating, so a few patrons were standing a the counter or at the tables of other dining establishments. The menu is pretty simple and has large font, so that you can make your decision to order while waiting in line. I ordered two tacos with corn tortillas and all the toppings. There is a $5 credit card minimum, but these tacos aren't super cheap so the cashless will be okay.  After you elbow tourists out of the way to hand your receipt over the counter, you can watch the meat men prepare the goods and load up on salsas and pico de gallo. I was happy when my tacos came out and loved eating them! The carne asada had me ravenous - the beef was so juicy and tender. Unfortunately, my adobada taco took a bit longer to come out,and there was no seat to eat my other taco while waiting, but it was also good. These are definitely high quality tacos, but for $3.75, I can get 2 amazing tacos in SoCal. I guess its the price you pay for a great location in Chelsea Market and all the hype.

Pricing are affordable ($10 or less for lunch in NYC). I wish the sizes were a little bigger but honestly the flavors were so delicious and authentic I couldn't give this less than a 5/5.

Instead we have to pay, get a ticket then try to squeeze in some more lines and track down one of the dudes to hand him our ticket and tell him corn or flour tortillas. It is very confusing for people who are here for the first time, and the dudes barely speak any English. $3.75 for the grilled steak tacos. These are good but nowhere nere the best that others have claimed. While the meat are tender, some of the tacos have too much sauce (guacamole) and some don't have enough. It's obvious that these guys are trying to get the line moving so the portions are not consistent. $3.50 for the marinated pork tacos. The guy in front of us claims this one is the best taco in town. I don't usually get pork tacos but I want to see what's the hype is all about. I'm very surprised to find that they're so salty. I almost throw these away but at $3.50 a piece I gotta swallow these salt tacos. They're also a bit on the dry side so make sure you get a Mexican coke to help get everything down. I really want to try the lengua but they obviously don't have that here(Guess people here don't like tongue).

Do note that they're located inside of Chelsea Market with no sign outside. Los Tacos No. 1 was actually listed last year in Yelp's top 100 food places in the entire country and after eating here I can see why. It's a simple taco stand making everything from scratch right in front of you including both their corn and flour tortillas and the quality of the ingredients is top notch. Truly authentic tacos are made with corn tortillas and cheaper cuts of meat as it's generally considered a poor mans street food. As I dislike low quality meat and corn tortillas I typically stay away from tacos but with their high quality meat and homemade flour tortilla options it's a different ballgame. They may even convert me to a corn tortilla lover if those are as good as they look. Filling options for the tacos include carne asada (grilled steak) for $3.75, pollo asado (grilled chicken) for $3.50, adobada (marinated pork) for $3.50, and nopal (grilled cactus) for $3. You can also get the same fillings in a quesadilla/mulas (mulas being with flour tortilla, quesadilla being with corn) for $4-5, and chips and salsa ($3) or chips and guacamole ($4). I ordered 3 flour tortillas with eat of the meat options. They simply top each one with some raw chopped onions and cilantro and then you can help yourself to a number of different salsas and limes.

324,-N-lphdEjvE-wH9S00owSg,Ross P.,5.0 star rating,"Too many people have suggested that I try this Taco spot out in Chelsea Market. I finally made the trip. You have to do a little navigating to find it in this massive shopping/food center. When you find the restaurant you will see a menu on the right side of the line and old fashion bottled sodas in a cooler, in front of the cash register. You order and they will give you your receipt. Do not be an idiot like me and throw it away once you get it because you will need it. In order to get your food, they will take your receipt, make your food, then give it to you. Do not forget!This was my first time going so I tried the pollo asado aka chicken taco and got it with a tortilla. Of course I ordered guac and chips on the side. I am not a rookie!When you get your food, there will be different types of spices. I loveeeee spicy food so I went with the first one( I do not know the name but it was brown) and it tasted delicious!!!! Time: the line was long but moved fast. Be aware when a cashier is calling next. This place gets a turn of tourist and sometimes they may not be as cognizant that the next register is open.Price: Cheap!This restaurant is worth multiple trips. It is safe to say that I will become a regular.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

This was my first time here but so I decided on a Carne asada taco and a pollo   asada quesadilla they were both really delicious the only thing I would have preferred is that the flour tortillas would have been a little thicker, they were basically paper thin and I had a hard time keeping the filling inside. But that being said I really enjoyed them both and I didn't mind that I had waited in line a little while to get them. Also the prices there were very reasonable.

When I saw the menu, I was pretty shocked by how expensive the tacos were (I'm used to $1 tacos so $3.75 + extra for the cheese shell is a lot!!) but I was still very down just to try a new experience. We didn't have to wait that long, and especially after ordering, the line for sauces moves pretty quickly. I got one adobada and one carne asada.The cheese shell is delicious! You definitely end up with very greasy fingers but it's worth it. The meat was average, not amazing. Not worth $3.75 with a regular tortilla. But to be fair I am spoiled with amazing tacos in the LA/SD area, so I feel like my standards for tacos are really high. Still, the unique concept made it worth my time and money.

Don't forget to squeeze some lemon to make it even more tastier!Overheard someone hesitating whether to wait just to get the tacos as the line was super long during Sunday afternoon; I would definitely grab something next door and be patient here, it was absolutely one of the best small bites in Chelsea market!",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

The process:You will have to mingle and wingle through the crowds of the Chelsea market to make it to the line. Not that the line doesn't move quickly, it's just part of the experience here. Ordering should be fairly easy as everything on the menu is based on one the following four: Carne asada (grilled steak) Pollo asado (grilled chicken)Adobada (marinated pork) Nopal (Grilled Cactus) If you are coming for the tacos I would recommend the Adobada / pork (the one roasting on the spit) in a corn tortilla. After ordering you will get a ticket, and when one of the servers will be available give them your ticket and tell them you want it in a corn tortilla. The lime, radish, salads, and hot paper on the counter are there for you, so don't be shy. This is one of the few places where the hype is totally justified, especially if you get the marinated pork in a ""corn"" tortilla.

The lack of good Mexican food in NYC is well-documented by now, so I was wary when someone told me these were ""the best tacos in New York."" At this point I hear those words and just absently nod. But Los Tacos meets the standard of good taco trucks back home. I wouldn't say it blew me away. Their quality is solid and consistent, but lands in the mid-range if you've had decent tacos before. Still, I appreciate the quality given the location.The line can get pretty crazy since it's right in the middle of Chelsea Market, but it moves fast. Ordering is quick and simple: choose your type of meat (or nopales/cactus) in either a taco or quesadilla. Note that their quesadillas are open-faced tacos with melted cheese rather than traditional quesadillas, so I'm not sure if the extra $1 is worth it. They do feel a bit more filling though. In terms of meat, the adobada (marinated pork) and carne asada (steak) are both amazing. Their adobada is very similar to al pastor, and even comes with small strips of pineapple on top (to be honest, I'm not sure if there's a difference at all).After ordering, hand your ticket to the cooks and let them know if you want corn or flour tortillas. I highly recommend the freshly-made corn ones. Once your food is handed to you, top it off with one of their salsas and grab some limes, raw radish slices, and roasted chilies. Or eat them as is! Their tacos come simply with onion, cilantro, and guacamole taquero, the thinner guacamole that marks a street taco. There's no place to sit, but you can kind of hover near their ordering counter if it isn't too busy.The only thing that bothers me is pricing. I have a hard time forking over $4-5 for a single taco, but then again, I should probably just accept the fact that I'm in New York and this is how it's gonna be.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

The fried quesadilla is like, the best thing ever. Never had one before but it was life changing, basically. The outside was fried to a perfection, not too crunchy so that it was like a chip, and definitely not soft like what normal quesadillas are like.

The LAST place I could think of would probably be a taco joint inside Chelsea Market. And to claim to be ""No. 1""? We'll see about that. But my sister swore that all her friends loved the tacos, too, so we took off to the most upscale taco joint I've ever experienced. INTERIOR: No seating - at least they got that part right about it being a taco joint. Honestly, tacos need to be a little dirty and it wasn't as dirty as expected. But it was still interesting seeing the kitchen make my tacos. There was a line that ended near the entrance of the shop, which was pretty impressive, seeing as it was a late lunch time on a weekday. FOOD:I ended up ordering two tacos and a horchata, while my sister ordered chicken quesadillas. I was super excited for my carne asada and adobada. I sipped on my horchata while waiting. It was sugary sweet but definitely helped with the impending spicy kick of the tacos. Both tacos were delicious. My sister didn't appreciate that they automatically doused her quesadilla in the guacamole sauce, as she enjoys her food plain Jane - no sauce necessary. Overall, it was a tasty lunch on the go.

The taco came with a corn tortilla and the quesadilla came with a slightly larger flour tortilla. In terms of meat, it looked like the same amount, but I definitely preferred the flour over the corn tortilla. The carne asada meat is so ridiculously juicy that juices leak out after each bite.

The tacos are not as flavorful as they look, and the guacamole is not generous enough to my liking. I would definitely say these are NY tacos, not authentic CA tacos like some reviewers are saying. A huge pet peeve is that they put all of their condiments (salsas, lime wedges, etc) in the pick-up area, which is already crowded because this is where people are giving cooks their tickets and picking up their orders. Some people are also inconsiderate enough to eat at the bar area in front of the condiments. It just all seems unsanitary with hands reaching over the open condiments and people eating their tacos over the condiments.

As my palate is quite sensitive these days due to a cleaned up diet, I was able to appreciate the flavor explosion in these tacos that needed no additional toppings, though they do offer for free as a self-serve option. My picks were the queso taco (not-so-secret menu item where the tortilla is made of cheese) with carne asada and the corn tortilla one with pork adobada. I assumed the queso would be too much but it's was just right. I've never been this excited about tacos in a sober state in my life and that's a fact.

It also sets the stage for what's to come - fast, flavorful, funder-represented food. Fuh real.These guys I know talked up the adobada like it's a savory savior in a soft corn tortilla, but I'll tell you what the real counter lunch winner is: dat carne asada. Don't get me wrong - the pork is stuff of legend, especially when treated with the works (radishes, onion, lime, any of the baller salsas). The steak is just light years above other renditions, slung with the quickness after a marinade, biased cut and flash grilling that makes it impossibly tender and saturated with spice.As a newb, I hemmed and hawed after placing my order, not knowing what the fuck to do as arms and torsos thrusted themselves past me to the short stretch of a serving area - grabbing plates on the fly, or posting up to make quick work of their order. We joined in on the latter, and once everything was coated, topped and sauced, the world stopped. I housed my tacos like nobody's watching.Nearing $4 a taco is ludicrous, but hey, Manhattan.

Good luck with finding seats because you'll have to fight your way through especially on busy days/hours (aka all day all night).

Los tacos #1 was very good, and I would probably go back but not in the near future.It is located inside Chelsea market, and there was only about a 10 min wait time in line on a Friday night at 7:30pm. One con is that there's no place to sit. We ordered the steak, pork, and chicken tacos (all the meat ones), and went across to the Creamline seating area to eat.I thought the pork taco was really good, very flavorful and salty, but the meat was a bit dry. They also but an exorbitant amount of sauce on it! I liked the sauce but would've preferred more meat or veggies instead.Also tried the steak and definitely liked that one better! Lots of juicy meat and not as sauce overloaded as the pork one. I didn't get to try the chicken one, but my boyfriend did and claimed that the steak was by far his favorite still.I think the best part of the tacos was the corn tortilla! I almost chose the flour tortilla, but the guy making the tacos heavily recommended corn, so I went with that. The corn was sturdy yet soft, didn't get soggy, and was perfectly chewy. Prices were somewhat high (3.40-4$ per taco) but hey it's NYC so can't expect any better!",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

We ordered one of each type of taco: carne asada, pollo asado, adobada, and nopal. I was fully expecting to just take a little taste of each one and leave the rest for my boyfriend to finish, but these tacos pleasantly surprised me! These tacos are delicious and amazing. There's no other way to put it. They're perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked and the corn tortillas here are done right. This place restored my faith in tacos. There's a consistently long line here, but it moves pretty quickly and you're served relatively quickly as well.

A bit of a downer for me since I hail from Texas where great tacos are a dime a dozen. I had very low expectations when I went to Los Tacos No. 1 - I thought it was just an overhyped touristy spot. Man, was I wrong. The tacos were legit. They didn't rely on some weird fusion or crazy ingredients like some new trendy taco joints, but were in fact very authentic tacos just made very, very well. Every detail down to the tortilla was spot on. They don't skimp on the meat or fillings either. Every taco I have had was delicious, but as other people of mentioned, the adobada taco is probably the best. For those visiting for the first time, they have a weird ordering system where you put your order and then take your receipt to the guys at the left for your food to be prepared.

It's just nice to know beforehand so here you go: 1) Order at the register. 2) Hand your receipt to an employee at the bar on the left. 3) Tell them what toppings you'd like. 4) Stay in sight so the employee can find you when he/she is done crafting your tacos. Simple enough, but I thought they'd be calling out numbers so I stood around for a little bit before I caught on to the fact that I need to hand them my receipt.Seating:--There is none. Most people stood and ate at the bar on the left, but this is where people are handed their tacos and where the salsas are so it's not a very convenient spot to eat. Instead of standing in that high traffic area, I went and stood at the counter to the right of the cashier (nobody else was standing there).Food:--I ordered two carne asada tacos with all the toppings (one on flour and one on corn).

I also appreciate that this place makes fresh tortillas instead of using those tasteless premade ones. It makes a huge difference! You have two options here: flour or corn tortilla.

For a moment, you forget you are even in Manhattan. People say there can't be a good taco place in Manhattan but I'm not so sure about that... The service is quick but there are really long lines sometimes. This was my 2nd time trying because the line was too long the 1st time I went. The employees there are extremely kind and receptive. The cashier takes you order and gives you a slip to give the taco man then he asks you if you want corn or flour tortillas. I chose corn cause I thought it would be a more authentic experience. Service is very quick and I got my taco within 5 minutes. I ordered a chicken and nopal (cactus) taco. First time actually eating cactus and the nearest desert is like a thousand miles a way so Los Tacos is the only place it looks like I can get cactus. I loove cactus, I def recommend it if you a vegetarian or vegan. The chicken taco was amazing as well, the chicken was perfectly grilled and marinated. Each taco comes topped with guac, onions,and cilantro. After you order your taco, there is a condiment bar to top your tacos. For such a busy place, I'm really surprised how clean it was each time I've been there. All condiment toppings looked fresh like they've just been made especially the salsa, radishes, and lime wedges. There is barely seating here, people do eat in front of the condiments which can be hectic. But if you walk around Chelsea Market, there's bound to be seating especially if it's warm & you can go up to the High Line and try not to look messy devouring your tacos like I did.

That's right, Tacos with a capital. Ya got Tacos, folks, right here in Chelsea Market. Tacos with a capital ""T"". And that rhymes with ""P"" and that stands for pork! The Adobada they serve up is nothing short of delectable. Juicy marinated pork on a rotating spit, drenched in spices, topped with a pineapple. *Touches fingers to lips and makes kissing sound*.The Carne Asada too...phenomenal. Tacos are about $4 (a hefty price to pay, but worth every penny) and are pretty filling. You're going to want a few though. Not because you'll be hungry, but because they're just so good you need to try as many as possible.I'd recommend splitting 3-4 tacos and a quesadilla with a friend.

477,IbJtMzGX0-7fTorOMNw9Dw,David And Joyce ..,4.0 star rating,"Joyce's Review:According to yelp Los Tacos was one of the #1 taco spots in the city, so obviously we had to give that a try first. We got to the market around 5 PM or so and headed straight for the tacos! The line looked pretty long, but I think it moved relatively quickly. We got one of each taco minus the cactus one (I think there are 3, chicken, steak, and pork) with everything on them. You order at the register and they hand you a ticket with what you ordered which you give to one of the available guys making the tacos in front of you and you can watch them make it. It was pretty crowded and it was a little troublesome trying to get the attention of someone to take your ticket with everyone else in the area. They also had a bowl of pico de gallo and other sauces for when you get your taco. The tacos are pretty small and street sized so it was fine for us to share as a snack. I thought all 3 were amazing - the meat wasn't dry at all and they put GUAC on the tacos which was so good. The chicken wasn't spicy but the steak and pork were (in my opinion) - I have very low spice tolerance and my mouth was on FIRE after we finished. Get a drink and prepare yourself if you can't handle spicy food very well. It was definitely very tasty though!I think this place is moderately priced - $3/taco, considering that the amount of meat they give you was not skimpy. I would give it a 4.5/5. In my opinion tasted better than Los Mariscos which was around the corner and served the seafood version (fish and shrimp tacos).David's Review:Mexican food is consistently part of my meal plans as a guy from Southern California. I think these street tacos were definitely on point! The line was daunting but moved relatively quickly. It allowed us time to go through the pictures on Yelp and decide what to order. Out of the three that we got, I liked the pork adobada the best (another way of saying pastor? I love pastor so I may be biased), followed by the steak. My only suggestion to the business is that they should have a better system of just having the guys in the back make your tacos without you having to scramble to give them receipts after paying for it. If I wanted to be rude, I could have just pushed my way to the front and gave my receipt to the guy after paying for it in the back. Luckily, Joyce makes me want to be a better person so I played nice. Would give this a 4.5/5 as well! Definitely on point in terms of flavor and price. Knocked off a half star to round down to 4 for the flow (automate the food receipts in the back).D+J's Ratinf: 4/5 - We liked it! Come check it out!!",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

The meats are all grilled over open flame which gives them great flavor. The quesadillas are not what we are used to - it was two flat tortillas with cheese inside that is melted on the griddle. Then that is used as the base for a taco - so is it a true American style quesadilla where meats and fillings are melted together,? No. Is it good? Yes but not as good as if the meats and cheeses were melted together. It is clear that they do it this way to speed up the cooking process. If the meat was mixed with the cheese it would take a lot longer to melt. The flip side is that you get a lot more meat the way that they do it.No rice or beans available only chips and guacamole. Only tacos and quesadillas - no burritos or anything else.They have authentic looking hibiscus (flor de jamaica) herbal tea, orchata and a third beverage in pails that they ladle out over ice.

They seemed to keep track of everyone, and while waiting he repeatedly assured me that my taco and quesadilla were in progress. Fun fact: quesadillas are really just tacos with cheese. Who knew? I thought they were supposed to be flatter and emptier. Anyway, it's delicious. Also, what most taco makers call ""pastor"" they call ""adobado"".

I have visited Los Tacos No.1 time and time again, and have finally decided to give them the review they deserve. The rave reviews that these tacos are receiving are all accurate. These are seriously the best tacos I have had in New York City. There's something about the meat seasoning that is just out of this world. My personal favorite is the carne asada taco. The quesadillas are just so, so good as well! You can't go wrong with either. Make sure you ask for a bit of pineapple for a burst of sweetness to your taco or quesadilla! The staff is kind enough to accommodate that request, even though it's not listed anywhere.The taste is very authentic, and you may choose from several toppings located on the bar. Just put everything on it! It's worth it! I have been to this location many times for their food, and I will be going back frequently! Lines can get pretty long here, and crowds can get pretty big, but as I said before, totally worth it!Many places will claim to have the best tacos in NYC, but seriously, this place is called No.1 for a reason.

Like, these are actually the best tacos I've ever had the pleasure of digesting in my 25 years of life in the North East. I only say NE because Texas (and I'm sure the West Coast as well) has their own spin on the classic taco - face it, who can beat the perfect Tex-Mex breakfast taco in TEYHASSS.Very little accouterments are added to said tacos yet even with the addition of the optional side sauces, the meat shines bright with all its glory.I recommend ordering the Carne Asada (grilled steak), you most definitely will not be disappointed. Out of all the steak tacos I've tried, this by far is THE BEST I've ever had. Corn tortillas are a must, it's not a true Mexican taco unless you order just that.Be wary, the line is constantly long (as it should be), but moves quite fast. Once you order, the cashiers will give you your receipt.. you MUST give that receipt to the line cooks or else - guess who's not getting a NYC renowned taco? -- you!Save your appetite for LOS TACOS NUMERO UNO cause honey, you'll be coming back every. single. day.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

The line moves quickly despite overwhelming crowds of tourists (like moi) in Chelsea Market because it'll all be worth it in about 10-15 minutes. Stick to the tacos and skip the quesadilla-- it's the same thing with just a bit of extra melted cheese. IMHO, steak over pork; flour over corn tortilla. The guac is amazing, toppings are abundant, so load up and chow down! I refrained from walking around with a food baby but now deeply regret only getting two.

The line was long and the ordering system is interesting, making you give your receipt directly to a Tacquero as if you were to pass an order to a bartender. I got a Carne Asada taco and an Adobada quesadilla. They make the tacos really quickly so it's not going to be proportionately layered, but the meat is incredible. The quesadillas are like a larger taco with melted cheese, so if you like cheese on your tacos go with the quesadilla. If you like Taco Bell-style quesadillas that are dominated by cheese and pressed flat, then go to Taco Bell, because you're not worthy of this quality of Mexican. This is the perfect combination of upscale New York Mexican with LA street-cart Mexican. It also happens to be served out what looks like a street stand, but inside Chelsea Market.

The Adobada was great if I had to nitpick I would say it was a bit dry and overly charred. The Carne was juicy, fatty, and perfect. The combination of flavors were spot on.

New York, NY? *clicks on pictures* And one picture had it in all its glory: adobada, pineapple, green sauce... a divine coincidence. As if it were a mirage. Too good to be true. Could this place stack up to my love? My Tacos El Gordo? We had to check this place out! After the line, a short wait time, and finding a place to sit in the Market, we bit. It's good. Really good. Meat on both the carne asada and adobada seemed a tad dry and I could've used more green sauce. Ignoring that as a one-time thing, well... I'll say it's a close second to Tacos El Gordo. And that's a fine place to be!! Shoot, my fiancée is second to... just kidding. Kidding! So since my favorite tacos in the world are over 2500 miles away, I think Los Tacos No. 1 will make a fine substitution!",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

Yes it's expensive and perhaps overrated, but when you're inebriated and on a low-carb diet, then this place is PERFECT. If you're a cheese fan like me, the thing to get is Queso Shell ANYTHING. I don't think you can go wrong, especially since everything kinda tastes deliciously similar. The only downy is that each taco costs around $5 bucks or so, which is an arm and a leg in taco world. Two should do the trick for the queso shells, but three is the magic number for the normal tacos unless you're a big eater. There aren't any seats, but there is a standing countertop area with a salsa station for you to eat your food. While it may seem a bit crowded at times, it doesn't take long for a spot to open up as the service is pretty fast and people come and go.

In short: yeah, the tacos are every bit as great as the other 1432 reviews say. The line/crowd is no joke and just figuring out how the process works can take a few minutes, but basically you put in your order, (attempt to) move down the counter, hand your order to one of cooks, and two minutes later you've got your piping hot and fresh tacos. The nopal/cactus taco is quite an interesting flavor...plant-y and a little sweet, plus texture-wise it was a little stringy so it wasn't my favorite. Adobada is quite good and I like the thin strips of pineapple on top, but the carne asada is UNBELIEVABLE. It's probably one of the most delicious things you'll ever eat in 30 seconds. Downsides are of course there's nowhere to sit unless you go into sister shop Los Mariscos, and even when you're standing at the counter you have a couple of people waiting impatiently for you to hurry up so they can take your place.

The carne asada tacos were jam packed with flavor..kind of a little too salty, but it made for a really tasty taco. Super tender meats. The adobada was alright. It was still really good, but I've had better. I went to college in San Diego and have had my share of pretty much authentic Mexican food being so close to the border and all. But, I was quite surprised by Los Tacos No. 1 -- their tacos are pretty dang close to one of my favorite taco spots in San Diego.

606,2yEC3VB9ENPWjhrhSKHcAQ,Devin W.,4.0 star rating,"I've worked in this area for about a year, and I've never stopped at this taco place. I've always thought why would I get Chacos in the city when there's so many authentic places in Queens and Brooklyn. But boy was I wrong. Decided to grab lunch here when nothing else was appealing to me cuz of my job, and I was in for a pleasant surprise. Ordered the Pollo asada tacos on flour tortillas and my friend ordered the same thing on the corn tortillas. You can see them being made right behind the counter. Workers were shopping chicken and preparing quesadillas, even Fresh Tortillas. But myself you can get this anywhere can go to qudoba or you can go to Chipotle and you're basically the same thing, but the difference is in the taste. The food was perfectly seasoned, and the two tacos were very filling. I also ordered an order of chips and guac. it was pretty good, I typically like my guacamole a little bit more spicy , but they had that covered as well. Right on the counter as you receive your order you can choose from mild medium and hot sauce to put on your tacos as well as pico de gallo and fresh lines cut for their customers. They also have roasted red chili peppers on the counter in case you wanted to have a little bit more of a Mesquite flavor to your taco. I will definitely visit this place again. Definitely a must check out when you're in Chelsea Market.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

Chelsea Market is always crazy so finding a seat inside is near impossible, but I found one up on the Highline very easily!Food: 5/5 The tacos were easily some of the best I've had! I had the carne asada and pollo asada with corn tortillas and they were both delicious! I definitely recommend putting some extra pico de gallo on top, along with some lime. The meat is spicy, but not overwhelmingly so and the flavors are very authentically Mexican! Service: 4/5 The process to get the tacos was a little confusing, as you have to take the receipt and give it to one of the cooks who will make your tacos for you.

I came in and ordered a quesadilla especial and a nopal taco. The folks behind the counter promptly assembled my food and handed it over. Once I had my food, the tricky place was trying to find a place to enjoy it. You can stand at the table area or you can venture down the hall where there are more stand up tables. No sit down unless you want to pay for it I guess. :/The quesadilla was amazing. They folded over the tortilla to make a pocket and stuffed everything in after frying. It was just the right thickness to hold everything together. Any less and it would have split open..As for the taco, maybe it was me but the nopal has the texture of a rubber glove. I wanted to try it considering over never had it before. Maybe I just had a bad batch??Overall, good food, clean venue.

610,aJ7pNwFURuUh6eGLfYILBQ,Marcela S.,5.0 star rating,"Can I give this 10 stars?!? Because these were the BEST TACOS EVER!!!The moment I saw a video on this place on Facebook and it said it was in NYC, I HAD to go!!! Of course what caught my attention is their cheese shell tacos. Literally mouth watering. It's not that hard to find inside the market and the LONG line may turn some people off but TRUST me, it's worth the wait (which honestly, is not that long of a wait). They work really fast and you'll probably be on line for 10mins. I had their carne asada and pollo (beef and chicken) cheese shell tacos. I have a really low tolerance for spicy food so it sucked that most places I've gone to eat tacos, all the spices are so incorporated into the taco, there's no way around it. Which is why I fell in LOVE with this place because you pretty much order your taco like you'd order a sandwich at Subway's. I added the guacamole, onions and mild salsa to my tacos and squeezed fresh limes on them. (My mouth is watering as I'm typing this). Again, BEST. TACOS. EVER!!! Now, of course there are pros and cons to everything, but their pros definitely outweigh their cons. The cons are just there their are no seating areas near by for you to eat BUT there are these stand up tables not too far (which is where we ended up eating and it was fine). If you walk further down, you'll find tables that don't belong to any specific establishment and you can just eat there. So my suggestion is, where they ask if you want it to go, say yes. It'll be a lot easier to maneuver within the market when everything is wrapped and inside a bag. Also, because the taco shell is made of cheese, you can expect there to be a bit more grease than usual. BUT, it reallyyyy didn't matter to me since the deliciousness of this amazing cheese taco over powered anything else. So again, I can't stress this enough, if you live in NYC or are coming to visit, make your way to Chelsea Market and check this place out! You won't regret it!!",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican
611,Ll9uTDMcdOjbVioIJFW08w,Pritha R.,4.0 star rating,"Guys. I'm super late to this party. Totally sorry!But now that I've arrived I AM SO INTO IT. A lil bit of backstory. You know when your MacBook Pro retina screen cracks and you have to get it fixed and you're dreading the 14th St 9th Ave Genius Bar appointment because your repair is out of warranty? And suddenly, Tim Cook's magical hands reach over from Cupertino, wave a magical wand, and your magical Geniuses decide to ""surprise and delight"" you, and your repair is free and done in front of you in an hour? (""Surprise and delight"" is actually a ""thing"" that Geniuses are encouraged to do, to keep the unicorn sparkle flowing in true Apple style. Google it. With a drink in hand. You'll want to raise that glass.)THAT is a taco moment. In fact, that is moment for two tacos. Conveniently located one block from the 14th Street Apple store, Los T #1 is in Chelsea Market. If you enter on 9th ave, the spot is tucked towards the back, and across from the Japanese-Inspired Mexican place (not awkward at all, I'm thinking? :| ) Los T #1 is usually always packed. Go at a slight off time, nbd. Place your order with the very pleasant intake person at the cashier. As a couple of questions. I usually go with ""What do you like best?"" ""Do you think I should get ______?"" Then I order it. I was advised to select adobada and grilled steak. We chatted about whether I should get chips (greed is allowed when Apple Magic happens - btw - but I decided against it). I asked if they had sparkling water and the intake person gave me a Jarritos selzer, free. What a lovely guy! Obviously, really great customer service makes everything taste pretty damn good so my tacos were already working for me, before I took a bite. After placing one's order, one moves over to the team that makes the food. I was asked ""Corn or Flour"" and went with corn. This was a mistake, as my new Mexican friend who ordered after me, shared. Real Mexican tacos are had in flour tortillas which can be fried. I sensed this could get geo-political fast. So I smiled, told him next time I'd flour up and redeemed myself by drinking a few tiny cups of gratis picante salsa, as chasers for my Mexican selzer. We discussed salsa in earnest, I sensed I had been absolved for my corn choice, and we had a nice moment. My tacos: guys, these tacos are pretty damn good. They come with one tortilla (some folks have many opinions on how many tortillas should cradle the fillings but I'm fine with the one), and as I asked for everything, my meats were topped with onion, cilantro, and a squirt of guacamole. Fresh radish, lime wedges, pico de gallo, and two slightly more ""spicy"" salsas were set up for self-serve taco (or whatever) embellishment. I bypassed the pico and beelined for the spiciest of their salsas only to be slightly crushed at how mild was for my tastes. I asked one of the counter fellows if they had anything with more heat and he gave a couple of charred jalepenos. Kind right? Lot T #1: your service is excellent, your food is tasty as hell, it's fun to learn tortilla #facts from a fellow eater, and I had a lovely time.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

I haven't had a really good experience with Mexican food in NYC and was therefore a bit skeptical when one of my friends suggested Los Tacos No. 1. We came in mid-afternoon on a weekday, so it wasn't as crowded as we expected. I ordered one pollo asado and one steak taco. They were both AMAZING. The meat was bursting with flavor and I was blown away by how tasty the tacos were. I love how they throw in a generous amount of guac inside and how you can add in as much salsa as you want. The tacos look pretty tiny, but I was comfortably full after eating two. There's no seating here, so we just ended up eating on the counters where the salsa and other condiments were. I can see how this place can get really chaotic during rush hours. Thankfully there is open seating around Chelsea Market so you'll probably be able to grab a table somewhere if there's no space around the counters. Staff was nice and checked in on us to see how we were enjoying ourselves. I was so busy stuffing my face I couldn't even verbally tell him how much I loved it. I'm sure he could how much I was enjoying the tacos by how quickly I was inhaling them.My friends are back in CA now, but we still talk about how great these tacos were.

Also I appreciated how they had three types of sauce toppings that were self serve. I put a lot of pico de gallo on my tacos with a little bit of the medium sauce. It was so good!

My personal favorite spot back in Cali is Tacos el Gordo literally minutes away from the border to Tijuana. There Adobada tacos are amazing and when I saw Los Tacos had Adobada as well I had to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised to find pineapple slices and green sauce like el Gordo does. The pork had a stronger kick than el Gordo, which is nice for the spicy lovers. Overall solid taco, pretty impressed but does not quite beat the adobada taco in San Diego.

The pork itself is crispy but also very tender at the same time. It is shaved off from a larger piece of beautiful meat that rotates on a vertical rotisserie with an open gas flame slowly cooking the pork. There's a bar of condiments and toppings after you finish ordering - stocked with cilantro, lime wedges, all sorts of hot sauce, salsa and more. You can top it with as much as you like and with whatever you like. I also ordered the HORCHATA but thought it was watered down. It tasted more like iced water with some cinnamon sprinkled in. I think I'd rather get a soda next time. I went on a Thursday afternoon so the line wasn't long at all. There were about 3 people ahead of me and the wait was about 5 minutes. I have heard that the lines get incredibly long most days though!

I used to think Mexican food in NYC couldn't possibly compare to the Mexican joints I frequent back home but I was wrong.

After you get your food, you could move to the middle of the counter where they have containers with freshly prepared pico de Gallo and various types of hot sauce and lime wedges.  You could top your tacos or quesadillas with however much pico de gallo or hot sauce you want.  It can get super messy eating this food, so make sure you grab a handful of napkins!!There are no seating area at this restaurant, so just grab your food and go to one of the standing spaces outside to enjoy your meal.  My favorite out of the 3 tacos I ordered is the chicken taco, it's so flavorful and went really well with the pico de Gallo.  The pork was on the dryer side and did not have the sweet taste that you would find in pork tacos at a lot of places (I also like pork with pineapples for pork taco, but the preparation style here is different.)  I like the tacos better than the quesadillas, for some reasons, the stuffing for the quesadillas is saltier than the stuffing used for the tacos.  They seemed to have more spice in them.  So I would recommend ordering the tacos if you had to choose between tacos and quesadillas.  They also offer plates but people rarely order the plates.  This place is not expensive, but it could add up, a meal for 2 people could easily be $35+ for say 3 tacos and 4 quesadillas.  However, the tacos here use meats that are succulent, they are seasoned well and the pico de gallo is freshly prepared right in front of your eyes.  And the best part - their tacos, etc. come with guacamole with no extra charge!!!  If you wanted quality Mexican food with traces of authenticity at a reasonable price, come here.  Don't mind having to stand at one of the dining areas with standing tables and getting your hands dirty.  The food is worth the hassle.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

I had heard great things about Los Tacos No.1, but had never gotten myself over to Chelsea Market for just a meal. Boy, did I regret not coming sooner. The hype is real, and Los Tacos definitely lives up to the hype.I've spent a good amount of time scouring California for great tacos and I still think that the tacos, on average, are better in LA. HOWEVER, I definitely think Los Tacos is up there with those west coast tacos, and probably the best you can find in downtown Manhattan. At $3-4, I would say they're a bit pricey, except for the fact that they really load them up with meat, veggies, and sauces. My favorite is the adobada/al pastor (of course), and it's just a good, fresh, meaty taco. Heh. The fresh tortillas and guacamole really make a difference as well, and it all comes together very well. They also make a pretty good horchata (a sweetened rice beverage), and it's about on par with most horchatas I've had anywhere.There's not really any seating, but considering I live super close now, that's not really a problem for me.

I tend not to get carne asada because most places overcook it, but it was *perfect* here. Everything I ordered was great!

730,wFLCJ8pTXVUQw55dJsLzRQ,Milana B.,3.0 star rating,"So before I start my review I'd like to clarify something. This was my first time experience, and for the food I'd give a solid 5. But for the service and overall experience - as a first timer - a sad 2. Therefore a compromising 3-star. Having heard so many great things about Los Tacos, me and my husband, dropping in Chelsea Market went straight to their stand. Pretty straightforward and minimal menu - a plus. But do get acquainted with some terminology beforehand. If you're going Mexican - do get to know what you're getting into. When there are 10 people behind you - you don't really want to keep the cashier by asking 100 questions what's what.I guess part of our overall experience problem - is that we weren't really know what to expect, and how the process goes, so we received a crash course. They are super busy, people coming, but moving fast. And so in order to get the line moving you have to be ready to answer the questions fast and get your order details fast. They do assemble tacos pretty much right away, not without some sloppiness, which I suppose you can't avoid due to the volume of orders, but the problem is you have to speak up really loud and listen to the serving guy very carefully, as it's really loud over there and really confusing for a first-timer. People coming, going, all around you, orders being served, someone is ordering right next to you, giving order ticket, picking up the food, putting toppings...All at the same time in a space of 2 meters...Maybe it's totally ok and someone would say ""stop complaining, man up"". Well sure, for a regular it's all part of the experience - it's just we weren't ready for that. So we didn't know that they had extra salsas and radishes on the counter. Among all that confusion we just wanted to step aside and let other people pass. So be sure you wont miss those things like we did. Secondly...the quesadilla thing. So you'd think it's  like 2 tortillas with toppings and melted cheese? No, no, no. What we got was a tiny taco-sized tortilla with some toppings sprinkled on top and the guy said ""here, quesadilla"". Erh...what? We were kind of hungry and people were coming, so we didn't want to argue and just accepted it. Later on looking on Yelp I learned that their quesadilla is opened faced - ok, we could accept that. But the size had to be bigger. Our serving guy gave us a taco sized tortilla by mistake, so basically we got another taco for extra dollar...Be sure you're aware of that.Oh, and if you have custom tacos inside one big order - you might wanna rethink that. Until you explain that this needs to be with onions but no cilantro, and the other with cilantro, but no guacamole...It's just not gonna work, you have to keep it simple. Even though they do ask you for your preference - among all that craziness it's just easier to say ""with everything"". Unless you're one of those people that want to get your buck's worth and will patiently explain to the server how you want it, not caring that it's people behind you. Up to you :-) Now, on the positive side, the food was delicious. I've recently tried some tacos on a local food truck, and they just weren't the same...That's why I'm prepared to ""man up"" and give this place another visit, playing by rules now, and knowing fully what to expect. I guess the whole ""messy"" ordering just comes as a part of overall experience. And if people didn't like it  - they wouldn't be coming back.Los Tacos - we'll see you soon.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

763,-FL3-KW6RNl7qyJnksnpLg,Paul A.,5.0 star rating,"Since this review is going to get buried in a few days I will keep this brief: These are some of the best tacos in all of NYCFirst, I would get one of each of the four tacos. They aren't huge, they aren't that expensive, and it is worth trying each of the different styles and flavors. Even the vegetarian cactus one is awesome. Also, get the Tamarind juice. You can only get it here and it is an awesome counterpart to the spicy food. Also, I recommend getting the corn tortillas rather than flour.Finally, I would have secondary plans after this place for eating the tacos. So many people wait in line for 40 minutes and then wolf down the tacos in five seconds standing amidst a crowd of 70 Eastern European tourists. Instead, plan to go to the high line or outside on the benches by the apple store or even a cab if it is cold and eat your tacos there. Chelsea Market is a really awful place to actually eat your food and these redonkadonk tacos definitely deserve better.So yeah, I haven't really had better tacos in NYC. I honestly like Otto's almost as much, but they obviously don't compare to the quality and Cosme, while on par with this place, is extremely expensive and hard to get into. So rock this spot.

767,uX_cBkvj73a-Q1Rka7nDtA,Jonathan D.,4.0 star rating,"I've always taken a pretty casual (read low-brow) approach to tacos. With friends and family from the west coast assuring me that NY's taco scene  is weak, I've actually suffered from reverse motivation.  But now I wonder if this countertop grill at the Chelsea Market is something to crow about. I had the Asada tacos and Adobas tacos, both on flour tortillas. The Asada came rolled up like an ice cream cone, and it was one of the few I've ever had that lived up to the honorific of ""steak"". You'd be thrilled if a sit-down restaurant pushed these little cuts into your plate with some mashed potatoes. When you reach your last bites of this taco, you'll sigh as the juices drip off the tortilla, forever escaping your grasp. The Adobas arrived as a more traditional open-faced taco, and boy was it pretty to look at! Its' angry red color was layered over by a pale disc of crisp cheese. Being merely excellent, I didn't enjoy the pork's taste as much. Probably because I used a (not so) medium salsa topping, adding to its' already considerable heat.Following along that last tangent, you could see that each of the three options at the salsa station were ultra-fresh. And the big bowl of limes is great for citrus-lovers like myself. But I found that the wedges were so juicy that I only needed one squeeze! Finally, I might suggest the corn tortillas in the future. They'd be able to soak up all those delicious juices, and neither taco skimps on the quantity of meat.

The place gets busy but the line moves fast. There are four different kinds of tacos: steak, chicken, pork, and cactus. The tortillas are made fresh! This makes such a difference. It's all corn tortillas for me. Flour ones are just, well, floury. We ordered 3 tacos (steak, pork, cactus). The steak and cactus come dressed with guacamole, tomatoes, and some other stuff. The pork (or adobado), is slightly different with a spicy sauce and pineapple. They were all fantastic. I like the steak and pork the best. The cactus is a nice option for vegetarians, but honestly there's nothing there that makes it any better than getting a steak taco.The setup is not very elegant.

But for a little more money, the slightly larger quesadillas are totally worth getting too. The meat they use here is juicy, flavorful, tender, and freaking delicious. So don't forget to get some napkins before stuffing your face.I do have to say that the nopal (cactus) is a bit of an acquired taste. The texture is a bit like cooked celery and the flavor is bland, but unique. I got the nopal plate and added meat to it, which was pretty good. But I probably wouldn't get the nopal by itself.There's no seating in there, so just grab your food and toppings from the bar before looking for somewhere to eat outside of the store area.

Asada was above average and the cactus was just not ma cup of tea. The quality and taste is definitely comparable to the West. There is no seating but it's good grub and there's loads to eat and do at Chelsea Market so its all good. My only complaint is that it's not in a central location in NYC.

Even though it comes with pineapple, which I don't consider to be the authentic version of an al pastor taco, but it works in Los Tacos No. 1's version.

Los Tacos No.1 tacos, come close, and is a great option if you're looking for something beyond the traditional carnita taco with cilantro and onions. I would be glad to eat here more, but their tacos are very messy and the line usually winds past the Nutbox, past the spice vendor, and almost to the waterfall, which is just too long of a wait for a quick bite.*Update, I've learned the owners are originally from the west coast, they hail from California and Tijuana.

Located in the buzzling Chelsea Market, it's hard to miss Los Tacos and the long line it attracts. The line is always pretty long, but it moves quickly. Make sure to have cash on hand. But enough about the location....Everything about the taco was done right. The tortilla. The beef. The chicken. The salsa. The pico de gallo. I don't think I have ever eaten a taco so fast in my life. The flour tortillas are seriously the perfect thickness. I think what distinguishes a great taco from a good taco is the salsa, and that is certainly the case at Los Tacos. The salsas are so flavorful. I would sample them in the salsa cuphodlers before placing them all over the taco because the spicier of the two has a kick and may be spicier than you'd like. The horchata was a nice addition on the side, but nothing life changing. I would pass on the chips altogether.The only con I can think of is that there's limited seating in Chelsea Market, but that's more of a Chelsea Market problem and less of a Los Tacos problem.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

Los Tacos No.1 exceeded my expectations and really makes me want to go back to NY just to go eat these tacos. Los Tacos is located inside the Chelsea Market.Customer Service - The employees were friendly and helpful, especially when I asked which tacos they would recommend. The service was fast and I got the correct order.Food - I ended up getting the pork (adobada) and steak (carne asada) on the corn tortilla. My friend and I were exploring the market and wanted to try a little bit of everything from the stores, so we decided to only order one taco each. They were a good size (snack if you just eat one, and a meal if you eat two I guess). The pork taco - I got everything on mine which included included some onions, peppers, salsa, guacamole, pork and some lime juice. It is a messy taco so be sure to have lots of napkins :) It was juicy and the pork had tons of flavour - smokey. Adding the lime helped cut the creaminess of the sauces, and really gave the taco a refreshing taste. It makes you want to order another one!CAUTION: I like spicy food but the medium salsa had some kick in it for me.

The chicken was super tender and juicy, and all the vegetables inside had an amazing flavor. This was finished very quickly to say the least. The steak was pretty good, but not amazing. The pieces of meat were a little small so the flavor wasn't all there. The pork was my least favorite, but it was still good.

The one thing I have to say is that these tacos are not the crunchy kinds..so the shell is soft and I had the corn/wheat shell with steak, pollo and nopal cactus. it was amazing. The juiciness of the toppings do tend to make it a little sloppy with the juice oozing out. WHATEVER i just ate it like a homeless person, which makes it taste all that much better.

I ordered a horchata, steak taco, and a marinated pork taco. The horchata is an iced sweet almond drink, and it's a must-have if you're planning to have the salsa with the taco. Even the medium spicy salsa was enough to burn my tongue (in a completely good way). The horchata definitely helped me cool down. Not to mention, it is also just such a delicious drink. Now, moving on to the tacos. The steak one was great, very juicy and flavorful. But if I were to go back and order again, I would ditch the steak and just have the MARINATED PORK. When I bit into the pork, the favors literally exploded in my mouth. The pork was slightly crunchy but also so tender at the same time.

So when my friend and I were on our way out of Chelsea Market and I spied with my little eye the words ""pollo asado"" and ""taco"" my feet just sorta walked their way over to Los Tacos No.1. It's like that sometimes. When you put ""Asado"" instead of just ""pollo"" or ""grilled chicken"" on a menu - you better come through for me.

Hands down this place serves some of the best carne asada, adobo & grilled cactus (yes you vegans! You heard right! cactus! so you have a choiceeee!!!) I have tried in NYC! This coming from a Mexican that lived in LA and currently resides in the Bay Area northern Cal where Mexican cuisine (and tacos) is abundant. The asada is so rich in taste, juicy, and the cactus straight out of the grill, slightly charred that allows the taste to drop from your mouth once you dig your teeth on it, my Mexican mouth was orgasming in the well blend of freash corn tortilla, salsa, onion & cilantro that gets sprinkled on top. The meats are so rich in taste that it left my mouth watering and wanting for more!. Handmade corn tortillas is a + and an added star for this. The salsas are good but to be honest you probably don't need them on your tacos since the culinary chemists inside (aka taqueros) present your taco in a wrapped paper which showcases technique and finesse (ok maybe i'm just over reacting to this but trust me, they're worth it) that you often don't see in a taco place. I have still yet to try the rest of their selections but next time (""I'll be back"", ok Arnold) i'm back to NYC i shall try them. This place is worth trying it and i give it 4.5 stars total.

Very tender yet not overly juicy or oily. The meat is the main attraction at this place for sure. Back to the queso shell, like I said it was really good, but nothing extraordinary. Its exactly how you'd expect a queso taco shell to taste to be honest.

The toppings include: guacamole, onions, cilantro (these three are put on by the chef while the rest is self serve), salsa verde (kind of spicy), red salsa (I didn't have it but it's usually spicier than the verde), fresh cilantro salsa, and limes. I also had a cup of horchata and it was pretty good. Not very sweet, which I was happy about but I know some people prefer it to be sweeter. It certainly helped offset the heat of the salsa verde and the heat of a NYC summer afternoon. Going back as soon as I can for more. Totally recommend.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

I passed this place a couple of times at Chelsea Market and always passed it because of the long lines. But after trying their tacos, I can see why there's always a long line and it's DEFINITELY worth the wait. Everything about their tacos are perfect.THE TORTILLA: My number one complaint about tacos is the tortilla because it always takes over the taste of the filling. But Los Tacos have perfected their tortilla but making it thin but not too thin. It perfectly envelops the fillings and does not take away any taste of the fillings. It is simply a soft counterpart that exemplifies the fillings.THE AVOCADO: Their avocado is so well made that it just melts in your mouth. It's not thick and it's more like a puree. The way it just covers the top of the taco is just beautiful.THE MEATS: pollo, carne, you name it. It's all good. Perfect seasoning, perfect tenderness. You cannot go wrong with their meats.THE VEGETABLES: It's there and it adds a slight crispiness to each bite of the taco. It's not overpowering and adds flavor to each bite. THE SALSA: Whether you like a kick in your taco or not, add the salsa. It's still good without the salsa but the added spiciness just finishes the flavor profile of the taco.

My previous favorites were in Bushwick, Sunset Park and Queens, but inconsistency, a fire, and the fact that nobody wants to go to Queens has left Los Tacos No. 1's adobada in sole possession of first place. Let me give you some advice:Anytime you are at a restaurant and there is meat that they will carve off a spit and serve you, you should get it. Immediately after seeing the spit, I wanted to get two adobada tacos. But in the interest of variety, I got one adobada and one carne asada. HUGE MISTAKE. (Your first instinct is always right, people.*)While the carne asada and the pollo asada are both excellent (seriously, fantastic tacos in their own right), pork is always the right decision. Really, I'm betting anything you get on a fresh corn tortilla** will probably be good here...but any space the inferior meats of beef and chicken take up in your stomach is space you cannot fill with the crispy, fatty, juicy explosion of flavor that is the adobada. I've always known these marinated pork and pineapple flavors as al pastor, but whatever you want to call it, it's ridiculously delicious and all I can think about is going back for more._____________*Even if it tells you to slap that 250 lb. man for his insolence. **I can't abide a crappy, grainy, cold, corn tortilla (I'd actually rather have flour), but Los Tacos No. 1 does corn tortillas right.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

926,c9-TD8CIhrHo7_2X8bJz8Q,Azul C.,3.0 star rating,"I struggled a bit with this review. Let me first off start by saying it really is a pity I can only give this place three stars. Taste, I would go with a five. Experience, way less.To begin, yes the line is long, but it's pretty worth it and it goes by fairly quickly. It gets a little crowded at the end because you have to get your receipt and​ ​hand it​ ​personally to the chef so they can make your order.​​ Of course, since it's in the Chelsea Market, there's nowhere to really sit.The prices are a little steep for a little taco (~$3.75), but it's packed with great flavor! The way they season their chicken and steak and the fact that they make their own tortillas from scratch right the makes a huge difference.I got the steak taco with a corn tortilla and my boyfriend got a steak taco and a chicken taco with a corn tortilla along with a steak quesadilla (FYI the quesadilla is just a taco with cheese in it​ - odd​). Overall, the food was really good. The best taco I've had in NYC (the steak one). I'm from the West Coast and haven't been able to find a decent Mexican Taco in NYC. This has definitely been the best so far.The reason I am only giving them 3 stars is because I had asked three times if there was any dairy in the taco and I was assured there was not. They mentioned the guac in the cactus taco did, but that was it. So, I got my steak taco and devoured it. Needless to say, I had one of the worst nights of my life a couple hours later. I am lactose intolerant, if I had an allergy the situation would have been much worse. For this reason, unfortunately, I cannot give them 5 stars. ​Especially when it comes to dietary restrictions, your staff should be educated and not make faulty mistakes like that.​Other than that, I would highly recommend this place. Tacos are delicious. I, however, am extremely disappointed with my experience and ​would ​caution anyone with a food sensitivity to maybe think twice, just in case.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican
927,skW4f7TQBAM7WUg08H5yOg,Sierra B.,5.0 star rating,"I seem to always find myself here whilst gallivanting around the meatpacking district. This is the perfect place to stop at if you're going to a booze fest at Milk Studios or Highline Stages and aren't sure if food will be served (and the backdoors at Chelsea Market are adjacent to these venues, haha). The quality and price of the tacos is unmatched in the neighborhood and it is one of the cheaper eateries in the market ($3.50 - $4.75 per taco). Everything on the menu is good; take your pick. I am preferential to the pollo asado because the chicken is perfectly marinated. The carne asado (grilled steak) and adobada (marinated pork) are fantastic, too. The later comes with strips of pineapple creating a piquant sweet & spicy contrast with the pork. Two tacos are enough to leave you satiated, but I certainly attempt a third on many occasions. I alternate between the flour and corn tacos but if you want a more authentic experience go with the corn.There are a number of toppings you can add to your tacos, but try not to go overboard; the food is already well seasoned. A splash of lime should be sufficient. Wash the tacos down with a glass of horchata or tamarind juice.

955,GP2dcFSr_8BteRKtY4nGNw,Mark B.,4.0 star rating,"We stopped here for lunch on recommendation from Yelp's Top 100 of 2015 list and had an enjoyable lunch.Décor: There really isn't much to this place as it is in the ""food court"" of Chelsea Market. It's literally just a walk-up-and-order place, there are no tables so good luck finding a place to eat. The line can get really long, so try to get there before the lunch rush starts or you'll be waiting for a bit. However, they do move the line along at a decent clip so don't worry too much. They prepare everything right out in front of you as you wait so there is nothing to hide, and everything looks very clean and appetizing.Bathroom: In Chelsea Market, yes. Clean, inviting, but a line can also easily develop here as well.Staff: The cashier, and also food prep people, move the line along pretty well. They are all friendly and are more than willing to help you with your order if you're not a regular (which 99% of the visitors are NOT).Food: We ran the gamut of their tacos, trying each one. I would not recommend the cactus one, but the rest of them are very tasty and very enjoyable. Honestly, you can't go wrong with your choice, just pick something you like (I think the beef was the best though...)Value: It's a popular place because the food is great, but the prices won't put you in the poor house either.This is a cool little taco spot that I'd come back to again - however I'd make sure to arrive early because the line we waited in was just a bit too long (of a wait).",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

As a pescatarian, I was slightly disappointed that there were no other options for me (in tacos) other than the nopal (cactus) but since I'd never had it before, I was game. For $4, I got one taco served open on a small plate with everything on it. While they were generous with the cactus, I found it to be too slimey and got tired of it fast. I think it lacked flavor and the texture was just meh. The guac was really good though and I wish they had put more. The cilantro was also the right amount and not overpowering, something a lot of mexican rests overdo.  I like the serve your self station where you can add mild, medium, spicy, or lime to your tacos (the spicy was great) and the large selection of sodas.

I've been dying to come and try Los Tacos as all I kept hearing was ""these are the BEST tacos,"" plus I couldn't help but realize that my Instagram page for some odd reason always seemed to feature their picture perfect tacos in their conical-like serving style, topped with only the most beautiful silky looking guac I ever did lay my eyes on. If Instagram could make cones look so good, well sign me up then!I must say I was skeptical of Los Tacos and thought it would all be hype. People in the past have told me Ottos Tacos was the best, or Taqueria Diana in the LES-- I fell victim to their strong opinions and tried the places myself but was utterly disappointed with both--their tacos were somewhat bland, meat was dry, and corn tortillas were too thick. Alas. Los Tacos entered my life and ended my mistrust in finding good tacos. One bite and I'm telling you--they truly were THE BEST TACOS. Chicken was moist and perfectly charred, all the toppings (onions, cilantro, 2 types of salsa, and guac--uhh free guac with no extra charging is unheard of!!) married so well. If only my marriage will be that good... Best part yet was that the corn tortilla was so fricken' fresh and not too thick or thin.

Deep within the recesses of Chelsea Market, you'll find a steaming counter in the distance, way at the end of a very, very long line. The masses line up for these scrumptious vittles, and I did, too. Said line goes pretty quickly and if you're not ready with your order at the end of it, be prepared for some looks, fella -- these patrons are for real. Word on the street is the adobada is the way to goo, but if you're allergic to pineapple (like me) or don't eat pork (like my buddy), you're still covered: the pollo asado is truly delectable, what with it's exceptional mix of spices and smoke from the grill. The carne is equally as good, but the pollo has a leg-up on texture. Add a squeeze of lime, a heaping spoon full of salsa fresca and you're golden, friend. Choose from corn or flour tortilla, and if you want cheese, order a quesadilla -- there' the same size as the tacos, but include melted choose courtesy of grilling over a wood-burning flame. In all honest, I've not had tacos this excellent outside of California. They're the real deal. Paired with one of their full-on sugar Mexican sodas, and you'll forget you're in a super-gentrified area of NYC. Just don't expect to relax.

We decided on Los Tacos No. 1 because I had seen it recommended on quite a few cheap but great eats in NYC and the food held up to the reviews! Yum! We both had one pork taco- it was amazing and the steak quesadilla (not quite what you are used to) but they used super fresh ingredients. The spicy salsa was AWESOME! The chips and guac were also very tasty. I left full and felt like it was a pretty good deal. Really friendly staff- they provided recommendations and checked in on our experience throughout; they also hooked us up with a free order of chips and guac since we were still eating when they were closing down. It was also nice to see them deep cleaning their kitchen at the end of the night! As someone who used to work in F&B, I love a clean kitchen!

967,qq9fakOIrNBe-nwRm59jPQ,Anderson C.,4.0 star rating,"Whenever people ask me on recommendations on Tacos I either steer them towards Five Tacos or here at Los Tacos No.1. Truly, they are probably some of the best if not a top contender for the 1st and 2nd ranking in the taco world in NYC.But I think after last night's binge tasting I think they might be just be tied at 2nd place with 1st still open for the taking.  SERVICE : Was close to being on point. The lady cashier expedited orders with ease and even though there wasn't a line waiting we all ordered, paid and moved on to the food side of things rather quickly.  The 2nd part of the service was just as quick which is great BUT when I asked for extra onions and was given practically 3 little cubes of it due to the food assembler rushing through to get the tacos stuffed, I feel the service took a slight step backwards here. As much as you should be expediting food, listening should be just as important. There wasn't a line so the whole rushing thing I didn't really understand. It was also NOT Lunch time, happy hour, nor was it a dinner rush.  You close in an hour. Slow down homie. And even if there were the speed that this guy was scooping, stuffing, and wrapping made it seem like he was trying to finish the order to go use the restroom. He could have just said something. I would have gladly waited.FOOD: This was also close to being on point. I ordered 4 different taco(s) Nopal (Cactus), Adobada (Spicy Pork), Pollo Asada (Grilled Chicken), Carne Asada (Grilled Steak).  The cactus tacos was WAAAYYYY off the mark. I don't even know how to describe it. It just didn't taste right.  The spicy pork was good but I felt it was lacking a certain kick to it. The chicken and the steak was the stars which came through on both flavor and expectation. The tacos are also on the smaller size very similar to Otto's except here they offer you the choose of corn or flour for your taco shell.AMBIANCE: This space is kind of a clusterfukc. The storefront is actually a health nut store. Across from it is MokBar which is a Korean noodle soup which offers seating & happy hour. Then you have Los Tacos No.1 to the far right which offers no seating whatsoever. I hate to imagine what happens when the health nuts store gets busy during a lunch rush for MokBar and the a taco rush for that same lunch crowd. 8 words. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THERE FOR THAT. Even if Los Tacos No.1 offered seats, they would have no place to put it. If I was going to get tacos on the go, I'd go to a taco truck.PRICE: The price is on the higher side partially due to the location of Chelsea Market, partially to there wide fan base, partially to Yelp and then partially because New Yorkers are willing to pay as much. They are priced competitively to those of Otto's & Five Tacos so I guess for better quality in Manhattan you need to fork out more cash for quality tacos.Overall: I would say they are at a 4 star for me but more like 3.5 stars after that cactus tacos.

993,5pL3GwG6ZdkCiXwH8oSFtg,Betty Ming L.,5.0 star rating,"Wonderful tacos at great prices. The portions don't look big but they will fill you up. If you're a pork lover, you'll want anything with the adobada (marinated pork). It's charred and tender at the same time. Marvelously seasoned. The pork tacos ($3.50 apiece) are smaller than the pork quesadillas ($4.50). One of each would be very filling. Or else, get two tacos to make a meal. There's a nice array of condiments that you can load up on yourself, including cut radishes, a mild tomato salsa, and spicier sauces. The corn tacos seem to be handmade, as are the flour tortillas.If you're avoiding carbs, try the nopal plate ($5), which is grilled cactus with beans and cheese. You can add meat for $1. The cactus is interesting -- chops up like a green pepper but a little slimy, like okra. I liked it!The $4 guac and chips seemed small but went surprisingly far. We were a group of four and probably should've placed two orders. Still, the guac was delicious and so were the chips. For non-alcoholic drinks $3.50), the homemade Jamaica had a sort of hibiscus tea taste to it. The horchata was okay. Both were on the thin, watery side, with a lot of ice in the cup. Lines can be long but they move fast. There's no place to sit. So if you have several in your party, get some to grab one of the public tables in the main corridor.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

996,riCUEy3tljyX0vnEG4BxPg,Maria C.,3.0 star rating,"Good, not great. 3.5 stars.I got a steak taco, pork taco, and the cactus taco. I appreciated the honesty of the cashier when I asked her if the cactus taco was a popular item. She said not unless they are vegetarian. I appreciated her honesty but ordered it anyway because I was curious what it'd be like. It tastes like mild green beans. The taco had almost no flavor and I'm someone who likes my tacos with a lot of kick. The steak taco was ok - I didn't actually order it - I ordered chicken but was sitting too far down the fall in Chelsea Market when I noticed the mistake and didn't go back to exchange it. I don't care for steak so naturally I didn't particularly care for this taco. The pork taco is the reason I give it 3.5 stars. It was very good. Far from the best taco I have ever had but very good nonetheless. One thing I really liked about this place is that you add the salsa and lemon and radish to your taco yourself - guaranteeing that you are going to get the exact amount of heat you are looking for because you add it yourself. Also, beware there is zero sitting space. I'd go back again if a friend wanted to and we were nearby but would not go out of my way to come back here.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

Wasn't able to get anywhere near full for the price. They're not huge so it's only good as a quick snack. Pros:- The freshest most flavoursome tacos I've had in my life.

1007,PSqbx7ui9XtZMvQcH_Udiw,Vishala S.,5.0 star rating,"I LOVE this place. I've been here a few times over the past 3 or 4 years, and it's literally the only place I visit for a meal at Chelsea Market. I have only ever ordered the Pollo Asado quesadilla and the Pollo Asado taco, as I generally don't eat a lot of other meat. I've gotten them on corn or flour tortillas at different times, both great. Usually one quesadilla and one taco, and that is satisfying enough to me for a meal where I don't want to eat to the point of being stuffed.They are packed with mini chunks of meat, even though they're a bit small overall. Succulent, juicy, wonderfully marinated meat! I get them without guacamole and they are still pretty decadent to me. All the cilantro hits me in just the right way. They have three different salsas to choose from on the counter to add yourself after the food is prepared- a mild, which is basically pico de gallo, a medium, which is tangy and green and perfectly spicy to me, and there's a more brownish colored hot sauce, which I haven't tried. They also have a plentiful supply of fresh lime wedges, radishes, and dried chiles de arbol to choose from on the counter. I highly recommend squeezing lime all over your tacos and quesadillas! The whole experience is just an explosion of flavor, definitely inspiring a bit of quasi (if not full-on)-orgasmic moaning. I thought I remember there being a few more small general seating tables in the vicinity of Los Tacos, but I think they may have been removed (or moved elsewhere), and now many tables are attached to certain other food establishments in the Market. When I went last night, a friend of mine got food from the place across the way which sells burgers and whatnot, so we sat at the relatively spacious tables in there. I never really spend over $10 when I go here, but getting a little more food and a drink will definitely take you over to the $10-20 range of spending.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

The stall has no seating and sadly, not much room for standing either.  (I enviously eyed the diners wedged on bar stools around the Rahmen shop.) You order, pay, then hand your ticket to the prep cooks who beckon you helpfully.  They ask you whether you prefer corn/flour tortillas and what toppings you would like. I got the adobada tacos on corn tortillas, with all toppings (that includes a squirt of guacamole).  Yes to the vertical meat spit with slowly roasting pork!  With plate of tacos in hand you have to navigate their counter for salsas (a range of mild, medium and spicy), lemon wedges, and radishes.  Very authentic.  However, very difficult to access, because due to aforementioned lack of space, there are all kinds of people with their back to you, their plates set right in front of the salsa bowls, eating.  Hence short of shoving them aside, it's regrettably annoying to try to garnish your delicious and juicy tacos.Having little other choice, I too wedged in my little plate on the corner of a counter and noshed on these quite delicious tacos.  I thoroughly enjoyed them. The balance of meat with crunchy, zesty, liquidy acoutrements is perfect.  It's the authentic Mexican style!You just have to cope with the the New York City square footage and crowds.  I would enjoy this place better were there some bar tables to set my plate down, so I could breathe easier while eating.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

We ordered 3 types of tacos, 4 carne asada, 4 adobada, and 2 pollo tacos and they gave us each set of tacos in individual batches amongst the crowd waiting.

It's a bit salty but the pineapple balanced it out. The chicken one was pretty good, but not amazing. If you consider price per taco then it's kinda pricey at $3.50-3.75 each but they do give quite a decent amount of meat! I spent $40 there for 10 tacos after tax. Worth it? To satisfy my craving for los tacos, yes! If I became a more frequent customer, probably not for that price tag.

You will be tempted to take a step to the left to try Hybird, since you've probably read some of the inexplicable good press for it, and since there is nobody on line and there is a much shorter wait.But instead of throwing away $2 on a drumstick, spend $3 here for one of the best tacos you'll ever taste. That will get you the Adobada Taco, which has some of the juiciest, most tasty marinated pork you could ever hope for. You should also get the Carne Asada ($3.50), which has some equally delicious grilled steak and some super flavorful sauce slathered on top.You also get to choose either a corn or flour tortilla for the taco. I tried one of each and they were both delicious.I could have easily eaten ten more of these tacos in a row.

It was funny how I never even plan to visit this place.  Was just walking around Chelsea with the wife, waiting for her sister and brother in-law to come.  While I was there,I turned on Yelp and BEHOLD Los Tacos No.1 just POPPED up in my face!Los Tacos No.1 is inside the Chelsea Market, it's easy to miss but if you look for a storefront where they sell spices or the big BIENVENIDOS sign, it's just right inside there!I came on a Saturday morning at around 10:30am and the place wasn't open yet.  I didn't want to look like a jack ass standing around waiting for the store to open so I play it cool by pretend to look at spices at the first store while looking at Yelp for some good recommendation.Once 11am hits, guess who was the first on line to get their tacos like a BOSS?Their menu is pretty simple, 3 types of meat (chicken, pork, steak) and a cactus.  My first go (yes there was more than 1 go) was 2 Carne Asada and 1 adobado but  I stupidly ordered it with flour tortilla while the whole timeIi'm looking at this lady behind the counter pumping out fresh corn tortillas... felt so stupid but at least I got my food.  Took 1 bite out of the adobado and I discovered what true love is (don't tell my wife I said that jk)The adobado was so juicy, tender and flavorful, they event add a slice of sweet pineapple to balance out the adobado, top it off salsa and guacamole and you have a mighty fine taco... you better have a bib with you while you eat this though because that juice will flow and burst onto your shirt like it did with mine but that's okay, nothing beats a good pork flavor cologne!! The Carne Asada was a little less flavorful than the Adobado but still very well made.  It was cooked perfectly so it didn't taste like rubber and the guacamole definitely added a layer of depth to it but I still like the adobado better!TIP: Be very careful with their salsa, I can handle my spice but even the medium salsa was spicy enough to get me to plow through my horchata (BTW the horchata is a MUST TRY!! so smooth so rich and so cinnamon-y)Because my first go wasn't enough, I went back again and this time got myself 3 adobado with corn tortillas and another horchata to wash it all down.  The corn tortillas was amazing! it's a lot more filling than the flour tortilla but it was nice and fluffy.  awesome chewy texture and best of all, it soaks up all the juices from the adobado.  YUM!!!!Price: $3.5 for the Adobado and $3.75 for the Carne asada- WORTH!Overall: Can't go wrong with freshly made corn tortillas, the adobado= to die for... just make sure you go early to avoid the long line and go with an empty stomach!!!",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

They put on a good amount of sauces, including a runny guac, which complimented the meat. You don't really need any additional sauces but they are available if you want them. As it is, it's difficult to eat these delicious tacos cleanly. You'll most probably need a fork to scoop up the remnants from your plate. Also tried the adobada. Didn't love it. Very similar to an Al Pastor*, it needs good quality pineapple (aka juicy) to break down the meat. Maybe the pineapple wasn't juicy enough but I needed more flavor, more succulence, more pop in my mouth.  It wasn't bad to be fair but probably wouldn't come back here for this again.

It was packed, but the line moves fast. Food: Authentic. I've had authentic tacos before out of the country and even some legit ones here in Long Island (shoutout to Nellys in Hicksville). I ordered the Carne Asada, Pollo, and adobada, on corn tortillas. Corn tortilla had great consistency, not flaky or hard. Regarding the carne asada and the adobada, the thing to note is that the meat is marinated very well. The flavor is deeeeep. As expected, the meat was also very tender, not very fatty either, the chew was nice. My friend also suggested the pollo, which I thought was alright: Chicken was not dry, and very flavorful. My only gripe would be that the tacos had a little too much going on; with the guac (they give a lot), in addition to the lime, pico, and salsa you may add, the flavors just don't come together too well. The bite is tasty, but not specific. You just get a lot of everything, and it tastes good, but if you don't have a sharp palate, you're just gonna taste a whole lot of flavors (again, not a bad thing). Seating: Nonexistent. Chelsea Market is poppin' with tourists, so don't expect to find much seating around the area when its packed. Me and my friend ate on the little ledge where the food comes out, where they have the salsas, lime wedges, etc. I think the one thing I didn't enjoy about this place is that it isn't inviting necessarily inviting for a conversational meal. If you have a sudden craving for tacos and you wanna get your fix and bounce, this a great spot. But because people are reaching over your shoulder, pushing you aside to get some salsa, and there really is nowhere else to go, you can't really enjoy the meal to the full. This atmosphere creates a sense of urgency that makes you feel like you need to rush and be out, like you're being obnoxious almost just standing there trying to eat. So my suggestion would be to get your food, and find a place to sit and eat, even stand in a corner somewhere where people aren't getting up in your personal space. Pricing: At $3.75 a taco, its a bit steep. The pricing is only fair because there aren't many places where you can tacos this authentic. But if you can find somewhere close to authentic with a lower price tag, I'd pass on this place. Conclusion: If you want the experience, and you're just craving tacos in general, drop by and get a taco or two. They're flavorful, and they'll satisfy your craving.

1077,D8VhFaC1TP--RsFjVkpmjA,Jando S.,4.0 star rating,"Los Tacos No.1 is the steadfast culmination of hype, convenience, and the use of quality ingredients for taco variety not commonly seen in these parts. The rise to stardom is somewhat impressive, considering there isn't a lot of seating and the menu isn't particularly big. There is a gringo contingent at work here, but the question remains: Are the tacos good? And the answer is yes. A big fat, yes.Folks who are seeking to explore the Tijuana / Southern California (Hola, San Ysidro!) style really need look no further. Tacos come in either asada (beef), pollo (chicken), adobada (pork), or nopal (cactus-vegetarian). The option of flour vs corn will come up and one should *always* choose corn. The difference is staggering compared to the regular flour tortillas and the juice soaks it all up so much better.The other thing that makes me excited about Los Tacos No.1 is the mere fact they offer adobada. Most of the Pueblan style taquerias around NYC will offer a similar variant in al pastor, but the seasoning on this marinated pork is definitely stronger. Northern style Mexican food just is a rarity in these parts and I love the fact they've continued to serve it via a rotisserie spit. Just thinking about it makes me hungry.If the tiny tacos don't curb the appetite, perhaps a large version in the quesadilla will. The meats are still on the table, along with a solid helping of cheese and salsa / guac. Feel free to decorate your plate to your hearts content by utilizing their condiments. A squeeze of lime, dash of radish, and a few drops of salsa verde is enough to give any taco / quesadilla a nice flavor boost.While it would be true that there is really no true seating, the same could be said about the taco trucks out on the street. And even though the place mildly simulates the truck experience, this shouldn't hinder anyone unless they have a large order. For some people (myself included), spending $3.50-$4.50 for each taco/quesadilla admittedly feels pricey. It might actually be the most expensive street style taco in NYC. I jokingly asked one of the guys in Spanish behind the counter if he'd pay this much for tacos and his reply was ""son gratis para mi..."" (it's free for me). That said, there aren't a lot of Mexican folks hitting up this line if you know what I mean.In the end, Chelsea Market and the surrounding hood has significantly pricier options than Los Tacos No.1.

Los Tacos offers no tables to sit at, like more than half of the other spots at the market don't either. The line was composed of about 40 people when I got there, and the wait was probably about 10-15 minutes.... but the wait is extremely worth it. Their steak and pork tacos are fantastic. Their pico de gallo is tangy, but not over the top spicy. Holy crap. These are by far the fastest and tastiest tacos that have ever graced my mouth. Their pork tacos have freaking pineapple in them? I've never had this combo and I'm dying to have some more of them right now. The employees are really friendly and move efficiently fast. The price? about $3 dollars a taco. WHAT? yes. The tacos are made by a Mexican staff? YES! That's probably why they're so damn good.Something to keep in mind though, after you pay and receive your ticket, move quickly to the other side and give that other person your ticket. If you assume that after you pay, your ticket number or order will be called out for you to come get it, you will be waiting there for a longgggggg time.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

I had the chicken and steak taco on a corn tortilla and they were both seasoned well and cooked to perfection. My bf had a chicken quesadilla on a flour tortilla and they aren't much bigger than a taco BUT we both agreed that the flour tortilla is so much better (i had a bite of his lol)!

Sometimes chicken can be too dry, but this chicken melts in your mouth! I also had the carne asada quesadilla on a flour tortilla. Again, the steak was very moist and the flavors were killing it! The quesadilla is served open faced. Make sure to get all of the toppings (like guac and onion, it's included in the price!!). I also had agua fresca (hibiscus) and it was lovely.I think the biggest thing here is the service and the free (well, included) toppings.

Best tacos I've ever eaten! The guy making them recommended I eat them right there when I asked if I could get it to go. I know I should, but I work nearby so I can always do that, and opted to take it home to eat (they will wrap it in foil for you to keep it warm). There are also condiments and garnishes on the counter for you to add to your food, consisting of various sauces, grilled jalapenos, grilled green onions, limes, and radishes.Got 3 different tacos - the carne asado (grilled steak), pollo asado (grilled chicken), and the nopal (cactus) - all ""con todo,"" which means ""with everything,"" for the sake of easy ordering. In this case, everything meant avocado/guac sauce, cilantro, onions, and salsa/tomatoes. The great thing was when I got home, the tacos were still very tasty, beautifully seasoned, juicy and warm. The tortilla was fluffy and not chewy, definitely handmade. You could taste the authenticity of the food. I wished I had ordered 2 more.I went crazy trying all the sauces (salsa verde, salsa roja, habanero peanut, and pico de gallo aka salsa fresca) by itself and with the tacos. Faves are the green and habanero.The tacos are on the small side and costs $2.50-$4.50, but seriously, best tacos ever and they're filled to the brim so you get a pretty fat taco, sooo worth it. 3 tacos didn't fill me up, but I wasn't starving either.

When you only have to go as far as your kitchen for amazing dishes (I miss you abuelita), you get spoiled.I still can't believe the best and most authentic tacos are in Chelsea Market.We usually start with 2 Carne Asada tacos on corn tortillas with only cilantro and onion. I'm not sure of the origins of that runny guac sauce but the consensus between me and my boyfriend has been #NotOnMyTacos. Add a squeeze of lime and the medium salsa from the molcajete on the counter and you are set.If you make it in time for the Adobada tacos, go for it! The gentlemen behind the counter already know I take my Adobada on a corn tortilla with cilantro, onion, and a slice of the pineapple on top. Salsa is optional on this since the taste of the meat is so delicious.Back home I would drink horchata almost as much as I would water and I am so glad their agua frescas are top notch. While I'm not a jamaica or tamarindo fan, my boyfriend is and was quite surprised by how good they are. If you need carbonation, try the Jarritos or a Coke in a glass bottle...I'm not a pop (soda) person and those always hit the spot.The nopal tacos are delicious. I'm used to eating nopales as a side dish but now that Lent is upon us and I'm not eating meat, they are my saving grace.My only complaint is that each taco is almost $4 but when the ingredients are right, the meat is perfect, and there is a woman standing there making tortillas BY HAND, I'll gladly pay up.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

She had them over flour tortillas and mine over corn.  I was a HUGE fan of the Adobado- fatty in a good way, juicy, and great flavors. My friend is all about the meat (pause?)* so she liked the carne asada more and we both agreed you could really taste the beef. They lay out some lime (definitely squeeze some over your tacos) and mild, medium, and hot salsas to add to your tacos/meal. We also got the guac-- pretty good! (4$)They would really up their game if they could somehow keep the chips warm. Its basically the size of the Chipotle guac side (for your reference...but much better!)

Why do I say that? Cuz I guess there is no other mexican food stand in Chelsea Market. LOL. Anyway, it is bit hard to get Los Taco since they are mixed with other food stands in Chelsea Market. And with all the flood of people and lots of food stand, it took me  10 mins to actually find that place. And when I got there, there was already a long line in front of me while I am starving to death. Service: there is no such thing as service since they do not even have any seats for you to enjoy their delicious taco. But they do have lists of food on the wall while you are waiting in line. However, one thing to notice is that although their line is extremely lone sometimes, it moves really fast!Food: what I found very interesting is that they have Nopal / Grilled Cactus taco. Tell me, have you ever thought about eating cactus? No, not at all. All though stings and all those ugly appearance, hell no~ But as a crazy foodie, I have to try to satisfie my curiosity. So I did order it. And it tasted really weird. It's chewy but tasteless. It is not typical veggies that I can related to, tastewise. A word to describe that taco, weird, is all I think about. It is not bad with spicy sauce but still, I asked myself, what is it? I do not know this time, I will leave the answer to you to fill in.Price: taco for 3 dollar for one . Pricy!Overall: Well, it's good, even though my order is weird. But the flour is good , tasteful and good to eat with spice.

Los Tacos No. 1 is nestled in the middle of the busy Chelsea Market, sharing a space with an Asian themed restaurant and a tea supplier. They have a very simple menu with about 5 taco styles, and if you want cheese on your taco it is labeled as a quesadilla. I ordered a chicken 'quesadilla' with the horchata that they had. The taco was by far the best taco I have ever tasted. The Guac blended perfectly wth the seasoning of the meat and zest of the vegetables. The horchata was good as well, but was overshadowed by the amazing taco. The restaurant itself has no interior seating space and is actually just a taco line if you think about it. You place your order, move down a few feet, hand a guy your ticket, and he had a you your food. If you're lucky you will find some standing seating right outside the spice stand.

Tucked away in a corner of Chelsea Market, these are hands down some of the best tacos in New York City. It all starts with the handmade tortillas, which you can see being pressed and grilled fresh to order. You can pretty much see and hear all the other components being made. Keep your eyes and ears pealed because the line cooks will make tacos for the next person in line if you don't keep up. This is why, albeit long, the line moves really quickly. I ordered Adobada and Carne Asada tacos with everything then topped them mild pico and a squeeze of lime. After getting our food, the next mission was finding a place to eat. Thank god for the holiday and a number of shops being close because it made, finding a table quick. Even though we would be standing, we picked the first available tabletop. I would go as far to recommend eating these standing up because it gives you the right amount of leverage with these overflowing tacos. Plus you can step out of the way or dodge some of the drippings that are sure to pure down your hand/arm. Yum. The meats were so juicy, all the condiments (onions, cilantro, and a mysteriously spicy green sauce) were on point, and the tortilla held up to all the weight. Even though I inhaled these 2 in under 5 minutes, they were extremely satisfying and I maaaaaaaybe could have squeezed in 3rd but only because they were so delicious and I didn't want it to end.

Packed with toppings leaving you with remnants of sauce dripping down your hand. Napkins and lots of them are required.Grab and go joint doesn't overlook presentation and customer service.

1182,dWi72pRg3D9OtyFEE27bXA,Sami E.,4.0 star rating,"Los Tacos No.1 has the art of taco making down to a science, serving endless line-ups of hungry guests while maintaining a high standard of freshness and quality. Located in Chelsea Market, this is a perfect stop for a snack while enjoying the market. Menu is simple and made up of a few variations of tacos. We opted for two grilled cactus and one Pork taco on corn tortillas. Once you order you get to witness the speed and precision in which the tacos are made; one lady making fresh tortilla, one man carving pork from a shawarma like spit, and one man putting all the magic together. The result is a miracle of food assembly that will tickle your taste buds. Grilled cactus was definitely the most interesting taco I have ever had. Slightly sweet, slightly smoky with a green bean texture, this was definitely something different. The pork was well seasoned, with the perfect amount of spice. The tacos are loaded with guacamole, tomatoes, and other toppings (onions, cilantro etc). There is an additional topping bar of salsas, hot sauces, radishes and things of that sort. The corn tortilla had a great texture and was clearly handmade shortly before consumption. All in all this was one of my favourite places to eat in New York; it is certainly a gem in the breathtaking Chelsea market.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

Perhaps some of the blame should be on me for coming here on a dismal thunderstorm-y evening of 7/14, but I caught them at 8:30pm on a Monday (some time after a Yelp event in nearby West Village), and they were absolutely not on their game.I'd ordered a horchata, a carne asada quesadilla, and an adobada taco and sadly, none of which satisfied my palate.  Both were soggy, dripping and flavorless. Upon picking up the taco, a stream of water came pouring out. 0-for-1. (I have a witness that swears by it and loves Los Taco No.1) Ok, maybe that was an aberration....I picked up the open face quesadilla (yes, it looks more like a giant taco... They DO know how to fold things in half, don't they?) and still it fell apart before my very eyes and hands, a sloppy mess, one which I had to eat with a fork.  Not going well I'm afraid. 0-for-2.If that were not an indictment, the third strike goes to flavor. It was simply bland beyond words.  I had expected savory and flavorful and my tastebuds were bereft of that small pleasure tonight. 0-for-3.To add to my misery after paying for this experience, I also had to hunt for seating somewhere or eat fashionably at the pickup counter.  Luckily, found a table outside after standing some five minutes or so.Even (name-your-baseball-player) has bad nights so I'll give them another chance, however, as it stands, the experience earns them two stars.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

That being said, Los Tacos No.1 are my favorite tacos in the 5 boros and quite possibly at the top of the list including California! Yes, it's pretty pricey, and you don't really expect to find the best Mexican food in Chelsea Market of all places--but it's legit. I've had everything on the menu before and it's ALL good. Of course I always prefer tacos in the end, but whether you go flour or corn tortillas, the end meal is outstanding. There's always limes (sometimes sliced a little too thin), and the salsas are so satisfyingly spicy! I always go with the adobada now-a-days as it's too amazing to pass up, and usually pair with an horchata to cool my burning palette afterwards. To be honest, I don't even feel robbed paying $3 a taco because you really do taste the quality -- in the meats (not fatty or gristley), the tortillas (hand made and fresh), the salsa (real chilies), and the Spanish language as music to my ears.  Go and you'll fall in love too!

Sure I'm biased, my grandmother knows how to make tortillas by hand and Mom's Guac is priceless and taco trucks are native to my home-state CALIFORNIA, but that does not mean I can't judge a taco by its taste. My Order: (2) Carne Asada (seasoned grilled steak) on corn tortillas w/ everything(1) Bottled Coca Cola (imported)(1) Side of Chips and SalsaThe TacosI handed my ticket to the sorcerers behind the counter. Had to pick between flour and corn. (Tip: Always go for corn, leave the flour for the tortillas) Toppings include fresh onion(diced), cilantro(chopped), house salsa(mild) and guac (no extra charge!!; again, looking at you chipotle)At the bar there are different salsas and garnishes like fresh limes, mild, medium, and hot salsas(fresh) and last but not least, Radishes(its a staple in Mexican tacos and soups).They were great! The steak was lightly seasoned so that I could taste the fresh cilantro and guac. The tortillas were fresh and handmade (just might be as good as grandma's)The Chips & SalsaThe chips (obviously corn) are also homemade. They were fresh and had only a pinch of salt. The Salsa was extra spicy but man was I not expecting it! This is not your average salsa. You can taste the blood sweat and tears in it.

The service is friendly and efficient, but it turns out there is nothing special or particularly delightful about these tacos at all.

But it's a hole-in-the-wall, order at the counter and sit on the floor to eat type of place - who cares about the service?I came in with a friend on a Sunday night around 7:30, and there was a line of maybe ten or so people waiting to order. I went with one each of the pollo, carne asada, and adobada tacos. The system is very confusing - after you order, you go to the other end of the counter, where you're supposed to hand your receipt to the employees there. They will then make your tacos for you. I was under the impression that they were given the orders by the people at the register, and you were supposed to use the receipt to claim the tacos after they were made, but no - if you don't give your receipt to them, they will never make the tacos. So hand your receipt to them as soon as you get to that end of the counter.At the register, I was able to order the adobada, but once I handed my receipt over, they said they were out of it. Obviously some logistical issues going on here that they should fix, but whatever - I just asked for a second carne asada taco. I love that guac comes automatically with the taco.There's no seating, so you have to go back into Chelsea Market and hope for an open counter, at which there will also be no seating - strictly stand-and-eat only - or just ignore the signs that say you can't sit on the floor and sit on the floor anyway. (If you don't want people to sit on the floor, maybe you should provide some damn chairs.)

As long as no one gets in your way to get here, you're all good.I've had my fair share of tacos in the city and in LA, and Los Tacos is one of the taquerias I can say reign supreme. It's almost always a long line, but it moves quickly. The first time I came, I will admit I may have slightly shoved someone to get in line (more like actually gave them the biggest death stare), but after all the hype that this place has received, I was excited and ravenous.I got two carne asada tacos, and while $3.75 for one seems outrageous, it really isn't for what you get here. You get a choice between flour and corn tortillas, and you can get three kinds of salsa along with guacamole included, and if you think about the charge at Chipotle, the price really isn't much for the tacos here. The steak was literally falling out of the taco because there was so much meat, so you really get your money's worth here. I liked my tacos with a little spritz of lime to wake them up even more, and I was actually heartbroken when I found the carnage left on my plate. To conclude my first time here, I tried both my friends' tamarind and jamaica drinks, which were a perfect way to end the meal.My second time back here was just as incredible, if not more. Los Tacos taught me why Vampire Weekend wrote a song titled Horchata; I became hooked right on the first sip. I thought it was a milk-type drink at first, but it's actually a drink made of ground grains and spices. As if I didn't eat enough carbs, I'm happy I found a way I can drink them now, too. On this time, I had the adobada, which was just as good as the carne asada I had the first time. I liked seeing the guy carve it fresh from the revolving contraption it was on.Los Tacos really is my favorite taqueria in the city. It's pretty straightforward; it has a small menu and it's all done so well.

It was so juicy and flavorful.  I also tried the steak (which was a tad bit dry) and my friend had the cactus and said it was nothing special.  Also wash this all down with the horchata drink I would come back and just order the pork tacos!,Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

But after hearing Los Tacos was serving vegetarian tacos with grilled cactus, I had to come.I tried both their flour, and corn tortilla with the two nopal tacos ($2.50) I got. Either one is a good choice, they're both pretty tasty, it's just a preference of corn or flour. The cactus itself wasn't what I expected, but not in a bad way. It reminded me a lot of eating okra. It's got a slimy exterior, but its crisp when you bite into it. I really enjoyed the taste, and it's definitely now one of my favorite vegetarian taco choices. Grab tons of napkins, these things get crazy messy. Also, any taco joint that gives you free guacamole on your tacos is solid in my book.The only downside of this place is location. I really wish they had another storefront away from Chelsea Market. When you get your food, you're left walking around the place looking for a table, maybe even a just a seat. Food is fresh, and made to order, and staff is really friendly. They let you put on your own salsas and hot sauce at the counter which is nice.

1281,Ie5O848EmC2a4Hm6j6ILqQ,Michelle A.,4.0 star rating,"First time in Chelsea Market and I was trying to figure out what I wanted to eat, so I stopped at Los Tacos because I really do like tacos! If you go here, expect to be in a long line of people (especially if you're going at a peak time like 1pm on a Saturday). But the line moves fairly quickly as the staff are really efficient while not compromising on freshness or quality of the food. Menu is simple, with only four options for tacos: carne asada, abodaba, pollo, and nopal. I got the carne asada and abodaba and both were fantastic and unique from one another. Meat was very tender, very flavorful, and they generously fill the tacos. The corn tortillas were fantastic, unlike other store-bought corn tortillas I've gotten in the past. These were a lot softer/more tender, while still having the great corn flavor. The only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the price ($3-$3.75 for a taco depending on which one you get, which makes sense for being in Chelsea Market), and the lack of seating in the area (I had to wander around the market and luckily was able to share a table with a few other strangers.)But overall, great place!",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

After getting a food coma from the Swiss Roll from Empire Bakery, I needed something salty to stabilize my blood sugar levels but was too full to eat a lot. Lo and behold, a taco place with a limited menu that actually has a vegetarian option! You place your order at the right side of the counter, pay, present your receipt to one of the friendly cooks on the left side, pick corn or wheat tortilla and it's cooked up before your hungry eyes. The nopal had square chunks, tasted as if somehow they managed to get fresh nopal and not the overly salted and vinegared nopal from the cans. The cilantro, onions and guacamole on top made it tasty and the salsa, tomatillo sauce, and pepper sauce you can load up on from the filled earthen bowls before you made it even tastier.

The owners need to partner up with a big player and open many more locations.  They will become rich beyond their wildest dreams and be doing a mitzvah by providing New Yorkers with a more delicious alternative to Chipotle.   I only wish they had burritos on the menu, not sure why they would not.I had originally given this place 5 stars but I'm taking away 1 star after going back several times.  Two reasons.  First, their stupid retro-novelty 3 sip soda bottles, if I'm spending 14+ bucks on 3 quesadillas then kindly give me an ample amount of beverage! I literally drank the entire tiny bottle between paying and collecting the food (no exaggeration).  Sure, those bottles have more personality than a can, but I'm there to get my eat on, not appreciate some trendy/eclectic notion of what soda once was. Second reason for losing a star is that the lady making the tortillas kept speaking on the phone, touching the phone with her gloved hand, and then going back to making them with same gloved hand. Not at all hygienic. For the love of G-d, while making  tortillas by hand, change your glove if you are going to touch the disgusting phone receiver!",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

I've never been to Cali, so I can't say it beats LA tacos, but at least in NY, los tacos no 1 is truly #1.

I've gotten both the pork and chicken tacos, and I think for its quality, the price is not bad at all - although I could honestly eat way more than just 2 tacos for ~$6. If you're stopping by Chelsea Market, this place is a must! The only con is that there are no seats - so you either have to stand or walk around to find a spot that probably isn't close to los tacos, but I didn't mind walking and exploring other things in the market.

I chose the adobada taco and especial quesadilla with chicken (you have the option to add meat). The adobada taco was good, but I thought that the pork meat was actually a bit too salty for my taste. Adobada usually tends to be my favorite, but in this case I liked the chicken more - the meat was juicy and the flavor stood out even with the cheese and dough fighting to steal the show. Then again, I will say that while the especial was certainly tasty with it's tender chicken, globs of melted cheese, and fried doughy goodness, I kind of felt that it ultimately wasn't worth the calories. I'm glad I tried it, but personally I thought the normal tacos were satisfying enough. I'd rather leave the indulgence for a chocolate dessert or something. But judging from the other reviews, maybe that's just me. These are definitely some of the best tacos I've had in NYC and not far behind the ones I had in San Diego at La Puerta.

It was an excellent decision.It was busy, but the line went quickly. The employees were pretty cheery for having to work on Thanksgiving day too.When you get to the counter you order the main taco filling and then you are able to add cilantro, onion, guacamole, etc and there is no extra charge for it.We both ordered 2 tacos each (each being around $3-$4). We also both got carne asada and adobada tacos. The abodaba taco was good. I have had abodaba before but sometimes it can be really salty. In this case, not so. The carne asada taco on the other hand was excellent. We were both glad that we saved that for our second taco to eat: it melts in your mouth and it's full of flavor.They also have an excellent horchata with none of the horchata-cinnamon sediment that happens sometimes at other places. Very smooth and refreshing. Corn tortillas (my sister was very happy with them).2 tacos may seem like a small meal but it was definitely just enough for a lunch.The only issue for this place is the seating. There isn't really any. The ramen bar nex door was closed and had a counter so people sat there. There were also a few tables but I think it was also for the ramen place. When that ramen place is open I don't know the seating situation. Don't let that discourage you though. It is eating even without seating available.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

1349,S0i4IPS4Rerf2VBpHKw2AQ,Karin G.,4.0 star rating,"Let me prelude this rating by saying this: I HATE CHIPOTLE WITH A PASSION! The reason is I am paying at non-McDonald's prices for food under a McDonald business model. Honestly, I don't really care if my food is really organic or locally sourced because healthy eating would mean eating a home-cooked meal. Eating meat that is organic or veggies that are locally sourced do not equate to healthy eating habit especially if they are heavily doused in sauces for taste. So Los Tacos No. 1 is a taco shop. I love tacos as I traced it from my childhood visits to Taco Bells. It makes great tacos such that all the components of a taco-the shell, condiments, meat, and sauce really complement each other. It is obviously a superior product compare to a taco from Taco Bell or Chipotle. It is a mom-and-pop shop. The downside is that it is located at Chelsea Market, which is becoming more populated with out-of-towners.

I can't think of any better quality Mexican food in NYC, and I've done Suenos, Dos Toros, Jackson Heights, Spanish Harlem, etc... Los Tacos No. 1 is hands down the best. The Menu:Comprised of tacos and quesadillas mostly. The quesadillas are the same size as the tacos, but griddled and with cheese. They also do nopal (cactus) plates, chips/salsa, and various Mexican sodas. The Spread:Select your taco filling: grilled steak (carne asada), grilled chicken (pollo asado), marinated pork (adobada), or cactus (nopal). Then choose corn or flour tortillas. Finally, choose your extras: guacamole, cilantro, onions, and salsa. Afterwards, you can garnish everything with cucumbers, limes, blistered peppers, hot salsa (red), and mild tomatillo salsa (green). The Set-up:Place your order and pay at the first register on the right counter of the stand. Then move over to the left counter, give the man your receipt, and tell him which tortilla/extras you'd like. There is ample counter space at the stand, and along the windows facing W. 15th St. The Locale:Once inside Chelsea Market, you will be able to locate Los Tacos No. 1 from a few visual clues. It's off a southern side passage from the main drag. Just find the spice store (or sniff it out), then walk south. It's directly across from Hybird. The Meal:I wasn't sure how big the quesadillas would be, so I went with one steak quesadilla on a flour tortilla with guacamole to start. I love that they don't make you get onions and cilantro! I know it's authentic, but I don't like raw onions, and I have a strong aversion to cilantro. I sauced it up with both hot salsa and green salsa, and then some lime juice. After one bite I was in love. The steak was so juicy, but still maintained the charred taste of the grill. The soft flour tortilla was great quality, and all the flavors worked together to form a complete package. I finished eating, but still had some room, so I decided to maybe try an overpriced Questlove Hybird drumstick, or maybe some Mexican corn from nearby Num Pang. But Num Pang didn't have any corn, and I couldn't shake my desire for another Los Taco No. 1 quesadilla. So I got back in the line (which was much longer now), and went with a pork quesadilla on corn tortilla this time. The pork is actually cut from a rotating spit (!), like gyro meat, then thrown on the griddle to add smokey char. As I waited again, I noticed the women in the back actually making the tortillas in house from masa. Now that is a fresh tortilla. I gobbled down another quesadilla, and by then I was satisfied, though other people could probably eat another taco/quesadilla or chips, additionally.The Verdict:I don't give out many 5 star reviews. I mean, I just gave one to Momofuku Ko, but like... that's Ko, that's to be expected. I wrestled with giving it a 4 because of the disorganized line situation. Honestly, one of my BIGGEST pet peeves of this city is that New Yorkers are notoriously aggressive line-cutters, and on a busy day I could see that being an issue, especially as this place gains in popularity, which I see happening in a big way. However, the food is too fantastic to care about any other minor annoyances. 5 stars.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

The prices are a bit high so it's hard for me to determine if it's worth it or not. I had two carne asada quesadillas and a drink which were satisfying and came out to about $15.

The way some people say the chicken at Hybird across the kisok from Los Tacos No. 1 is overpriced (in ways I don't quite understand; I think it is pretty fairly priced), I'm thinking to myself: ""$3.50 for a flimsy corn tortilla that's going to break under the weight of too much juicy chicken pieces while getting all over my hands and clothes?!"" At least the fried chicken doesn't completely fall apart in my hands after one bite. Ahhh, screw it. It all tasted good. Ha! The options are plentiful enough. One can get tacos with chicken, beef, or even cactus. Same goes with quesadillas. The chips and gauc are very reasonably priced. (Only $3 for a good amount!) I ended up getting the pollo asado taco; it was made fresh to order, and my server was quite happy with me when I said, ""Yeah, you can put everything on it."" What I love are the bowls full of extra ingredients for further customization / contentment. An extra spoonful of salsa fresca on the side and a wedge of lime, and I was good to go! It was flavorful, indeed. My favorite part was the avocado cream drizzled on top. Such a velvety compliment to the strong flavor of the chicken.I'll definitely be back to try some of their other options; nopal (cactus) sounds too interesting to pass up!

The tamarindo was tasty and The tacos are delicious- the pollo asado and carne asada were both good with a nice selection of fresh toppings to put on it. The problem is they're small. Again they're good but they're fit to be appetizers, I had to eat 3 of them before I kind of full (probably could've had another one still) and at $4.75 (?) per taco thats adds up if you want to be satisfied. I also had some of the 'nopal' which was a cactus salad dish with cheese. It was lame. I expected it to be interesting but nope tasted like string beans (which I hate) and they were just soggy. So I'd say unless you like that, its a waste of money. We also got the tortilla chips with guacamole which also seemed like just an appetizer and at any other spot probably would be.

1397,YoJfd2E1gprAVnzKv0fq0w,Owen S.,5.0 star rating,"Stopped by here on an impulse while my girlfriend and I were exploring Chelsea Market for the first time.  I had a craving for tacos all day and couldn't resist the allure of this casual, yet bustling taco stand just off the main drag.  Upon approaching the register I was welcomed by an active but quickly moving line.  After some deliberation I decided to try an Adobada taco and a Pollo Asada quesadilla.  There is a bit of a quirky ordering/serving process so, as another reviewer pointed out, the uninitiated may want to stand back and observe the ebb and flow of traffic before diving in on a busy day.As for the food, WOW.  I absolutely love Mexican food and after having spent the last few years working with a native mexican I have learned a thing or two about authentic dishes.  This place certainly has a noticeable ""tex mex"" flare but the balance between true Mexican street food and the flavor profile Americans have come to expect from what we call ""mexican"" is elegantly executed.  The pork and chicken were superbly well cooked and the various accoutrement were bursting with authentic flavors.  You can taste the quality and freshness of the ingredients.  I was initially flying solo into this experience as my girlfriend was not hungry at the time, but boy did her tune change once she had a taste of what I was ravenously devouring in front of her.I vaguely remember hearing her say ""it sounds like you're having an orgasm"" beyond the din of battling this culinary delight into submission, but I can't be sure.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

1400,XMfhNvRfjsGg1vxcQ1POsA,Marisol B.,5.0 star rating,"FROM TIJUANA TO THE REST OF THE WORLD!!!! I was born and raised in Tijuana, and moved to NYC about 3 years ago... it was my delight when a bit over a year ago I found a NYT article about the best taquerias in NY, and this Tijuana-style was one of them... so I had to be there immediately! First of all, I've always say the best tacos come from Tijuana (many will agree, some haters I respect). Are less complicated and full of flavor. Tacos No. 1 is the ultimate best execution of what a Tijuana Taqueria is: the stand, the coca cola colors, the music, the kitchen smoke, even the salt shakers in Gerber glass containers!  I understand that many people complaint about the lack of seating, but trust me: TIJUANA PEOPLE EAT TACOS THAT WAY! And I understand this is NYC and not Mexico, so an alternative is to place your order as ""to go"" and find a table towards the back of Chelsea Market.About the execution: if the salsas over the counter would be more liquid and spicier, these tacos could be ultimate perfection!  The main difference between these and real Tijuana tacos is the quality: Tacos no. 1 has much better meat without all the fat, tendon, nerves (ha!), but the marinated is the same. The signature taco of Tijuana is the Carne Asada (grilled steak), but I noticed that most of my non-mexican friends go crazy for the Adobada tacos at a point that is their ultimate experience (I don't eat pork, so I will relay in their picky palates). The tortillas are amazing, just the way how my favorite taco stand back home makes them, you can even see a lady making them right in front of you. Mulitas are also a signature Tijuana dish (don't try to order this in Mexico CIty), and they do it just the right way. Personally, I like to add Frijoles de la Olla, you can ask the taquero for a side order if they're available. Without a doubt, this is the best taqueria in Manhattan and I'm glad to know is reachable without going to Queens or Uptown. Yes,they're bit pricey, but everything in this city is pricey, and for the spot it's still worth to pay the price for something authentic without having to get out of the city. Just a side note, a good friend from Tijuana who now lives in Miami made fun of me about how crazy I get when talking about this place. He was here this past weekend, and paid 3 visits during his short stay.... authenticity and quality are the reasons why he kept going! Enjoy!",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

Los Tacos No. 1 is tucked into an area of Chelsea Market with a few other food establishments.  But believe me, it has no peer.  It stands head and shoulders above the other options because the food is delicious and dirt cheap! Win-win! When you get to the counter, you start off by ordering with the cashiers.  I chose the Carne Asada (grilled steak - $3.75 for one) and Adobada (marinated pork - $3.50 for one).  You get a ticket and then walk 10 steps to your left where the smell of cooking meats waifs through the air and gets your mouth watering.  I handed my ticket to one of the staff and I was asked whether I wanted flour or corn tortillas.  Now mind you, these tortillas are being made fresh right then and there.  I chose one of each for my taco selections.  I was then asked whether I wanted everything on my taco; everything being defined as cilantro, guacamole, salsa, and onions.  I said yes.  Seconds later I was handed two tacos to devour.  On the counter are freshly cut limes as well as mild, medium, and hot salsas to add at your discretion.  After adding these additional ingredients, I moved to the right and began to voraciously devour my lunch. Why voraciously? Because these tacos burst with flavor.  You can tell right away that everything is freshly made.  I love steak so I was surprised that I enjoyed the Adobado even more than the Carne Asada.  Don't get my wrong both were tremendous tacos, but the Adobado has a unique flavor. Of the two tortillas, I enjoyed the corn tortilla slightly more than the flour tortilla.  Although I was full after just two tacos,  I decided I had to go back and try the Pollo Asado (grilled chicken - $3.50 for one) taco because the others were just so good.  So I repeated the process above and as expected, the chicken taco was also excellent (though I rank it third behind the Adobado and Carne Asada options).  My one teeny-tiny gripe about Los Tacos No. 1 is that there is no seating area.  However, I was more than happy to stand at the counter and eat these wonderful tacos.  Los Tacos No. 1 is one of the best taco places I've been to in NYC and as the name says, it's certainly No.1 in my book.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

I'd always thought tacos were only good for a snack and even looking around, the plates looked deceptively small, so I kinda went ham and ordered a taco ($3.50), quesadilla ($4.50), and especial ($5) all with pollo asado. Holy guacamole (hah). Although the tortillas look small, they really load them up with meat and toppings. Two of any of their menu items is definitely sufficient for a good meal. For the tacos and quesadillas*, you have a choice of corn or flour tortilla. I tried and liked both although I somewhat preferred the flour since it was softer. However, even though the corn tortilla is a bit grittier, it sops up the juices better, which might help given how messy the food is to eat. But messiness must be directly correlated to taste, because these tacos were AMAZING! I especially loved the chicken, which was perfectly charred and had great adobo flavor. I've had a LOT of tacos in NYC, and have to say this was probably as authentic as you can get outside of Mexico.The especial though is probably what did me in. It's essentially a fried quesadilla, but looks like an empanada. Served piping hot, it's probably a million calories, but oh so good. Be careful though - the juices WILL drip all over you with each bite since the dough isn't very thick.Btw, if you're looking for a sit down place to eat, Los Tacos No.1 is not where you want to go. They have an open kitchen style with one long bar-style high countertop and NO seats, not even barstools! Although the crowds due to this configuration can be intimidating, the staff is generally pretty good at moving the line along - just try to know what you want beforehand! Also, the stairs are conveniently located right at the end and you can make a quick exit to eat your grub more freely outside, which is precisely what we did.------------------------------------------------------------------------------*Note: The quesadillas are served open face on a slightly larger tortilla than the tacos, so don't be expecting a two-tortilla version!",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

The menu's pretty simple - you can choose from tacos, tostadas, or quesadillas, with the variation of the main filling being what you choose. As we had just eaten at Cull & Pistol, we weren't that hungry - but we decided to grab two tacos (pollo and carne asada) anyways. These are pretty small and wrapped up almost how a crepe would be served to you, so be careful of any greasy goodness dripping out. Both meats were very tender and flavorful, and the combination of salsas and fresh ingredients really brings the food to life. The tortillas are small, but these are tortillas done just right - moist and chewy, not dried out and tough to bite into.There's not really any seating, just some standing area along the windows in the back - but there's not really much seating to begin with in Chelsea Market outside of the sit-down restaurants, so it's not something I'd worry much about.

First, I understood after reading reviews there were no seats, but seriously this was ridiculous. First of all you pay for your order only to find out you have to fight your way through people standing and eating at the counter to give your ticket to a cook. It's super disorganized and seems like you have to fight through to get the food you already paid for. Then the cook messed up and gave my husband's order with guacamole on it which he does not like. I told the cook guy I wanted guacamole on mine, and he got all huffy and said mine had it on there. But seriously there was no guacamole on it, I just think he was annoyed with us. The food itself was pretty good but really overpriced, the tacos should be $2 for how tiny they are. The chips and salsa overpriced for a tiny bag of chips and salsa so hot it hurts your hand to hold. I loved peaking at all the condiments at the counter, dreaming of using them but knowing I'd have to elbow my way in amongst people eating a meal to get any.So no, I'm not a fan.

Not sure if it's like this every day, but don't be discouraged! Unlike other restaurants who have long lines, the line moves pretty fast and service is pretty quick. The guy at the counter took our order in less a minute.Food- 10/10I ordered an adobada (or pork) mujas, which to me is basically like a tostada with an extra piece of tortilla and cheese, and my brother ordered an adobada taco. They were so good. Every small bite was bursting with flavor.The adobada was so tender and juicy. But be warned, the adobada is a little spicy so if you don't like spicy food, I wouldn't recommend it. They also had some Mexican soda in those old school glass bottles. You can just ask one of the guys to open it for you. They also have cute little stone pig shaped bowls filled with different kinds of salsa, limes, radishes, and peppers.

The ramen bar next door has seating but you can only sit there if you order food there.Pricing: 8/10Even though the food is good, the pricing was okay around $3-$4.

I was somewhat dismayed by the long line and the lack of seating for the place, but the die was cast.I'm embarrassed to say that I didn't know authentic quesadillas came on only one tortilla, but I guess this was an educational experience! It seemed a tad small for the $5 I paid for it but I figured that the taste might make up for it. Boy was I right. If I hadn't been in public, I probably would've broke down crying when I took my first bite. Yeah, it was that good. Everything tasted unbelievably fresh and vibrant. The cheese was unlike gooier quesadilla cheeses I've had in the past. It was baked a little more, not quite like the top of a lasagne, but maybe halfway there. The vegetables all tasted fantastic and the fresh-bakedness of the corn tortilla was apparent. It tasted exactly like a tortilla chip in the best way possible.The horchata was good, although not quite as much as the quesadilla. I found it to be a little too watery for my liking, although maybe I'm not remembering horchata like I used to.All in all the food definitely lived up to the hype.

1550,lam9Gex6xnagaPCJ7WOAEA,Michael C.,5.0 star rating,"Earlier today I received a text message from a friend of mine asking if I wanted to join him for a quick run to the Apple store. Since I wasn't making any progress on my lifelong task of fashioning an image of Jupiter out of Neil deGrasse Tyson's shining visage, I replied, ""sure.""Upon arriving at the Apple store, the two of us fell into our usual task of putting an image of Nicolas Cage on each and every device our grubby hands were permitted to handle. We soon learned that my friend needed to make an appointment in order to get a technician to have a look at his malfunctioning device, giving us a full 90 minutes to wait for an available ""genius."" We wandered into Chelsea Market. Anthropologie is right there on the corner, announcing to passers by that everything behind those doors will be overpriced and resemble something that one would find in their great-aunt's stash of the hand-me down clothes even she refused to wear. I suppose Anthropolgie has been a repellent these past two years, an offensive guard keeping me firmly away from Chelsea Market. My friend couldn't believe that I had never been inside, that I had never enjoyed the amazing fish market and the delicious gelato. I promptly pointed to the slow-moving masses of children and tourists as reason enough for me to have stayed away. It was a stalemate......until we discover Los Tacos No. 1. Forgive my ignorance, but I had heard very little about this place prior to discovering it. (I now recall seeing it on a ""best tacos"" list, but this is the result of post-meal research.) My friend and I, both coming from Chicago, deeply miss the wealth of delicious tacos that our former home offers, and have often pointed to New York's lack of amazing tacos as one of the reasons we miss our former home so much. I don't think I am exaggerating when I say that the Tacos I enjoyed this afternoon are among the finest I have ever consumed. I ordered a single pork taco, and a single steak taco, both on flour tortillas. They were perfect. I cannot imagine a complaint and am only able to offer hyperbole as description. The flavor was abundant, the meat was tender and juicy. Upon observing the menu we were skeptical of the $3.00 tacos. Most places in Chicago serve up amazing tacos for under $2.00. After enjoying these so much, I must admit that $3.00 is a bargain. I seldom review places after a single visit, but quite frankly, the food I enjoyed warrants the enthusiastic five star endorsement.

And only $4. It is not quite a full meal, but maybe that plus chips will do the quick. Also, be prepared to wait. You get in the first line to pay, then the next line to hand your order to the cooks. They can personalize your order there. If it's not crowded, you're looking at a five minute wait.

I found out about the place on the ""Yelp top 100"" and thought I would check out the reviews. I found a lot great reviews and figured this is a place I have to try. Since it is in the Historic Chelsea Market if was pretty crowded. We ordered Grilled Steak, and Adobado Pork tacos (two each), one Fried Quesadilla and Gaucamole with Chips. Tamerind Aguas Fresca and Horchata Aguas Fresca for our drinks. For $32 bucks we were stuffed when we finished!Service was fast, and the food was hot and delicious. The Adobado was the best I ever had!!! And we cannot wait to go back, we were not even out the door and planning our next trip.I read many reviews about the $3.50 price for a taco being too high and the taco's too small and I have to say that is crazy. My GF and I eat taco's everywhere In NYC and have paid $3.50 at the taco truck in front of the Apple store, so we cannot understand why anyone would say this... I mean a crappy BigMac cost 5 bucks!  And we found the size was fine. Most taco's we eat are the same size or smaller... The pictures posted are good representation of what we ate.After reading the negative reviews on Yelp we both think they are unfounded and just picky negative people who probably don't like taco's in the first place, so IMO disregard the negative reviews and enjoy some great tacos.My ONLY complaint was when we arrived I was surprised to see that there was no seating.  After all the funny-negative reviews I would have thought someone would mention NO SEATING....

You can't miss the stand, there's usually a long line [that goes relatively fast] and the large sign with red and black letters helps.Taco-wise, these are not cheap. Running at about $3 each, they cost more than what your average taco place on a side street would. But this is New York so you can call these ""cheap eats."" Adobada [$3]: The pork was really juicy and tender. It came right off the spit. I enjoyed the slices of pineapple on top. I could have done without the cheese and the kitchen sink though, it made the taco greasy. That was my fault for ordering ""everything"" on it. Chicken [$3]: The chicken was spiced nicely, the meat was moist on the inside but had a good char on the outside. The guacamole salsa on top was good, not as thick as traditional guac and not watery like salsa., somewhere in the middle.

I literally rush to get here on my days off just to get a taco since they close at 8:30 PM. All of their flavors are authentic and are made from fresh ingredients.

I was so tired of an Austin friend complaining about the absence of good tacos in the city, so I took him here, and he conceded that this comes close. High praise indeed.Food: good heaping of fresh delicious meats on top of a choice of wheat or corn tortilla. It's messy eating - each bite gushes forth with juice and flavor. What I like best is that Los Tacos lets the inherent taste of the meat shine forth - no heavyhanded salt or seasoning to overpower the meats. I tried the Nopal, the grilled cactus, and I gotta say it tasted like weird edible rubber. Don't do it unless you can't eat anything else on the menu. Note to self, I don't like horchata, the rice milk. Atmosphere: eat standing up at the bar, or find a table outside in the market. Not much seating in the immediate area.

Plus, they have sangria...what's not to like? Well, since you asked, the nopales. Maybe the taco stand vibe made me overconfident when I ordered, but I should've stuck to the more traditional fillings. They tasted like they just came out of the jar straight into the quesadilla, and since they weren't all that well strained, the (formerly) amazing tortilla got all soggy and the cheese was watery, too. :/ I'd visit again, but would avoid the nopales and any other ""off the beaten path"" items...",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

I immediately thought of American Mexican food and wasn't in the mood for imitation Mexican food but I was completely wrong. The food at Los Tacos No.1 is amazing! I became an instant fan. The cooks are Mexican and the food is definitely authentic Mexican fare. The menu is simple but authentic and I can't stress that enough.I had two tacos, one tostada with chicken, the other was soft with meat (both packed with protein and toppings) as well as a aguas frescas and a side of guacamole and chips. My friend had the chicken quesadilla and a agua fresa as well and split my guacamole with chips. I was thoroughly pleased with the food quality and taste. There is a self serve counter where you pick up condiments. I got the pico de gallo which was mildly spiced as well as a green condiment which I think may have been habanero peppers and it was hot which I love. There also was a red one which could have been chili peppers but I wasn't that adventurous, next time.Don't get overwhelmed. During lunch hours the line is very long (All Of Chelsea Market Is Buzzing At This Time) and snakes past the spice shop but it moves quickly. By the time you order and get your food it allows enough time for the other lunch goers to eat, go and free up counter space. THE FOOD IS DEFINITELY WORTH THE WAIT!

Also, they have Coke and Fanta products in old school glass bottles, but, I don't believe they are truly the foreign blend.  The orange Fanta didnt quite evoke the streets of Villarica or the hills of Odessa I was expecting.

Well....The tortilla is thin. It ripped once I picked it up. The meat is dry - both the adobada (pork) and pollo asado (chicken). The flavor is a little underwhelming and the texture is inconsistent. Some pieces were meaty and some pieces were a little like jerky. Understandably, I went at 8pm during a 9pm closing day. Perhaps because it was near closing time, the food wasn't the same caliber as it would be during the lunch and dinner rush. But an establishment shouldn't let that affect the quality of the food.

I had two carne asada tacos and they were so tender and flavorful, it was like eating two little pillows of joy. I was totally blown away. Just by looking at the Los Tacos stand you wouldn't think the food was all that spectacular because nothing in particular stands out, but once you eat the tacos you will be forever changed.

1653,nMOmj-ty40Ld1AeQKtuF3A,Christine P.,4.0 star rating,"Mmmmm so yummy! Here goes my experience there for the first time. I had this past Friday off and went to go renew my lic in the city and visit my grandma that also lives in Chelsea. Walked to the Chelsea market on a beautiful sunny Friday and it was PUMPIN' in there and there sure was a line for the tacos. Now, I've waited a while for rockaway tacos so to me, it wasn't so bad. If you are with a friend talking it goes even faster. I was there alone deciding on what to get and how many along with scrolling on Instagram. As I was standing there I see the workers pumpin shit out fast, lil lady there making the tortillas by hand and the men on grill along with assembling the tacos. I also peeped a white guy that worked there but wasn't working per se. I was wondering who the hell is he? On to my actual lunch. You get up to the register and there is also a menu w/the translation of what everything is. Not sure what the previous review was about not knowing what was what cause it's in English & Spanish. I also asked the girl what the horacha drink tasted like and she answered me no problem. I spent like almost $8 on 1 taco/ 1 tostada and opted out of the drink that was almost another $4. Got a ticket and moved to the side where the madness was going down. No space to eat but managed to go to the other counter twd the wall and was the only person there doggin my taco (thank God)...lol...anway as I'm waiting I'm still hawking who this dude is that works there,because clearly I'm nosey. I was thinking he prab thinks I'm some sort of creep but oh well. lol. So I give my ticket and get my taco and tostada literally 3min after, then put my tomatoes and semi spicy garnish located right at the counter as well. Moved my ass to the side counter where there was space and went to town. Damn these tacos are pricey for the side but SO GOOD...like wow, wtf do I say that other ppl haven't except you gotta try if you haven't already! I got two but literally could eat 3 no problem (legit only 3bites each). I'm guessing a grown/bigger guy or someone stoned could go for 4 or 5, no lie.  So back to me being a creep, I go to throw my plate out and still see this dude. So I politely go ""are you the owner?""...cause let's be honest ppl, who the hell else works at a place but not working their ass off but the owner? He said yes! His friends were there also and chatted a bit, asking if I was going to give 5stars since I mentioned I had them book marked on yelp for a while. Said the carne asad and pork were both amazing and that I gotta go somewhere a few times to give 5 stars..lol. The owner was super chil and *cough cough* actually very cute! lolI asked where he was from and he said Cali..(Ahhh the taco capital some would say, all makes sense now), white guy surfer type look..mmmm, mid-30's I would say. Yeah, I needed to give that run down on him as if you are all my girlfriends but my ass was in shock to see he was that young, only opened for 2yrs with such a known establishment, and doesn't hurt a cutie too! lmao..I said I really enjoyed it and kept it movin' on the rest of my day.

The Adobado is downright special - amazing pork with some sweet and delicious marinade sauce that balances out the little bit of kick you can add at the salsa bar. Also I'm a big fan of the chicken -- it's juicier than at most comparable taco spots with a great grilled flavor to it. The guacamole is legit as well. The corn tortillas are remarkably good, both in terms of flavor and their ability to not fall apart holding generous servings of meat. And despite Chelsea Market being a little bit crazy around lunchtime and weekends, if the weather is nice it's easy enough to walk a half block further down 15th street to the little park between the Highline and the river. Otherwise, cozy up to the counter and after one bite you will know it won't be long until you're looking down at an empty plate and taco wrappers.   The nopal and steak are also good but aren't quite up to the same level as the pork and chicken in my mind, but find a friend (or come with an appetite), order one of everything, and enjoy!",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

The types of tacos that make the 3-8 hour wait to get back across the border worth it. The tortillas are pressed fresh and amazing. The quesadillas are amazing. It tastes as though parts of the cheese are fried from making direct contact with the grill.

The first time I came here, I stood around thinking they'd call my order out. No! They make it when you present the receipt. And make sure you get ""everything"" on it! That includes guac, onions, cilantro. I'd recommend getting the tacos over a quesadilla. A quesadilla is about $1 more, but you're basically paying for a tortilla of the same size, a smidge more meat, and cheese. Two tacos will leave your belly content, get 3 if you're extra hungry. Get a side of guac and chips for $3. Add a horchata or agua fresca - you've got yourself a yummy, quick, and cheap meal for about $10!They offer a variety of salsas and accompaniments on the counter, such as peppers and radishes.

They were pretty average. I liked how the meat was grilled fresh on the spot, and there was a good amount of meat-to-tortilla ratio, but actually the steak tasted a bit funky (wonder if it was bad?). The guac sauce they put on the taco was watery, relatively tasteless, and just spilled everywhere, making it a pretty messy taco meal. I sort of wish they just got rid of it all together rather than set the expectation of having anything related to guac. And especially because there was no place to eat and Chelsea Market was packed, by the time we found a place to sit, the tacos weren't piping hot.I did like the add-ons they provided in those molcajetes, especially the sauces.

Right in the middle of Chelsea Market, too, who would have thought!Although the constant line leading to the register may seem daunting, the kitchen is a well-oiled machine and turnover is surprisingly fast. I really like that you bring your order ticket to the kitchen counter yourself, and the chef that takes your ticket then asks how you like your tacos prepared. Say ""everything"" if you want all the standard toppings. Actually, just say ""everything.""The bf and I stopped by to try a few of their tacos, including the carne asada and adobada. The adobada is very much like al pastor, roasted slowly on a spit almost like schawarma. They actually stick a large pineapple atop the huge hunk of pork, so that the sweet juices flow down slowly to infuse all its flavor on the pork and creates a beautiful lacquer. The adobada actually reminds me of the al pastor from Leo's Taco Truck in LA - which is a very good thing. The corn tortillas (and you should always get corn, although they do offer flour) were amazing as well, perfectly pliable, toothsome and incredibly fresh. The filling to tortilla ration was spot-on, making for perfect flavor and textural proportions with every bite. The bf also enjoyed the carne asada taco immensely, commenting that they're probably among the best tacos he's ever had. Mind you he is from San Diego.So there you go, my West Coasters - finally a place where you can indulge in all your taco cravings.

I used to live in the Lower East Side and would come here every time I was in Chelsea. I just moved to Brooklyn and made a 30-minute trek just to eat here. They are that good. Considering I've eaten places where a $4.00 taco comes with minimal toppings and guac is extra, the dressing at this place is unbelievable. Pico, cilantro, onions, AND guac are all included. That makes these small tacos pack a HUGE punch. I regularly order two with a nice bottle of Mexican Coke, and have managed to eat them standing up given the lack of seating. That's the only negative I can give about this place -- since there's no designated ""dining"" area (now that the noodle bar is open and has private seating) you might wander for a bit, but I would sit on the floor to enjoy these babies.I cannot say enough good things about this place.

The price is just right. Every taco is btn $3-$4, and generously stuffed. I got the chicken (pollo) and cactus (nopal) tacos. The chicken was juicy, and the cactus had a great texture - not too tart or slimy at all, just the right amount of crunch. The establishment is assembly-line style. You order and pay at one end of a long counter to receive a ticket and receipt. You then move further down the counter, hand your ticket to one of the waiting taco-assemblers and they then make your taco. When it gets crowded, it can get a bit hectic so make sure you keep an eye on your taco-assembler. When they are done, they hand you a small plate with your tacos. There are stations at the same counter where you can choose various sauces, or grab a lime or radish for extra flavor. The main challenge at this point is seating. There is a restaurant across from Los Tacos No. 1 which I'm guessing isn't very good by the lack of business. They have plenty of empty seats but exclude anyone else from using them. That means if you can't find any other seats in the general Chelsea Market area, you will probably have to stand at that same counter and chomp down. It does seem a bit un-hygienic yes, but the area looked generally clean so I'm guessing that people are generally pretty civil when they're chowing and/or Los Tacos wipes down those counters often, knowing that their patrons often lurk around the counter area to eat.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

I had the chicken, my husband tried the pork and beef, we agreed that they were all equally delicious.

The only place that we could agree on was Los Tacos No 1. It was an excellent decision.It was busy, but the line went quickly. The employees were pretty cheery for having to work on Thanksgiving day too.When you get to the counter you order the main taco filling and then you are able to add cilantro, onion, guacamole, etc and there is no extra charge for it.We both ordered 2 tacos each (each being around $3-$4). We also both got a nopal (cactus) & a carne asada (beef) taco. The nopal taco was good. I have had nopal before but sometimes it can be really salty. In this case, not so. The carne asada taco on the other hand was EXCELLENT. We were both glad that we saved that for our second taco to eat.They also have an excellent horchata with none of the horchata-cinnamon sediment that happens sometimes at other places. Very smooth and refreshing.2 tacos may seem like a small meal but it was definitely just enough for a lunch.The only issue for this place is the seating. There isn't really any. The ramen bar nex door was closed and had a counter so people sat there. There were also a few tables but I think it was also for the ramen place.

Got the corn tacos chicken and steak today. Going back again tomorrow for chicken and pork tacos. I think they melt the cheese on top of the corn tortilla which surprisingly keeps the taco together. They hide a smidgen of guacamole in there so it doesn't overwhelm the taco. There's an unlimited pico de gallo/salsas station. Located in an unassuming corner of Chelsea market. Don't count on getting a seat nearby though. So stock up and head over to the highline.

You place your order, then move along in the line and give your ticket to the cook. He then prepares the food. We weren't exactly sure how it worked and basically watched the people around us to figure it out. They gave us the food on tiny plates and there is no seating, so we had to get napkins, forks, sauce, and juggle them around Chelsea Market until we found a seat -- not an easy task on a busy day. We finally found a place and bit into the tacos. Wow! They tasted amazing! The only problem is they were messy and we only had these small plates, so we had to basically devour them quickly before the dripped over our clothes.

1958,KpxijugaAN5Q8yx4fLxmLA,Lawrence W.,5.0 star rating,"With Los Tacos No. 1 setting up in Chelsea Market, there's about one thing to say on behalf of taco-crazy New Yorkers when it comes to defending their assertions that they now have one of America's best tacos: God help you. West Coasters who haven't even sought out the city's best will likely have too much of a chip on their shoulder to admit it, many so-called East Coast taco experts haven't a leg to stand on to combat the cliché that there are no good New York tacos anyway, and it's going to seem pretty outrageous to declare a place open for less than a year as one that serves one of America's finest, so good luck with all that. But who cares anyway? Texans and Californians be damned, it's true. Los Tacos No. 1 serves a taco so good that you could dare anyone to taste it blindfolded against their supposed classic favorite confident and they'd secretly be worried they'd choose Los Tacos No. 1 instead. And Californians and Texans should have no reason to begrudge them anyway -- it's a collaboration of three close friends from Tijuana, Mexico, and Brawley, Calif., for crying out loud, guys who heard the East Coast plight and wanted to proselytize the West Coast expertise. Forget reason. Let's go to taste. You really can't go wrong whether you go with adobo or pollo, but the winner is the red chile-marinated pork, the adobada. Moist. Salted. Flavorful. Sweet but not cloying. Accoutrements. Proper moisture and accurately delivered tortilla. There are expertly prepared salsas. Dress it yourself. You'll shut up because your mouth will be full and you will be happy. (You shouldn't need to undersell them New Yorkers, but like dealing with that difficult friend, loved one, or sibling, you know well enough that introducing your West Coast friends to Los Tacos No. 1 will mean bumping into them there getting their fix.)Written by The Daily Meal",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

The adobada (AKA al pastor) and carne asada were both outstanding. I think the cut of beef used for the carne asada was skirt steak, hence the deliciousness. They roast the pork on the trompo (vertical spit) which is not something you see in New York City. When I saw the trompo it was a good sign.I lived in Houston for a while and tried a lot of the ""best of"" places in Houston, Austin, Dallas.

It was more spicy than the two meat options for whatever reason, and didn't really do much for me.They fill up your tacos with onions, cilantro, and guacamole (your choice of which). Then you can get some pico de gallo, and two other sauces on the side, as well as limes, so the tacos are overflowing and delicious. two were enough for me ($7.50 total). the guacamole doesn't seem to be made fresh and is akin to those squeeze bags you get at the grocery store; runny, limey, and slimey. it didn't detract from the whole taco, though,  i wouldn't have it on its own.at chelsea market, you can usually expect long lines, crowds, and unreasonably priced foods. as i was wondering around, feeling overwhelmed by all the raw vegan bars or whatever, i saw someone with two great looking tacos and became determined to find them. i am glad i did.",Los Tacos No.1,4.5 star rating,$,Mexican

I got a pork taco and my husband got the grilled cactus taco in addition to the hibiscus drink. We loved the condiment bar available. Of course my husband loaded his taco down with peppers and other yummy stuff. The tacos were probably the best we've had anywhere and the drink was muy delicioso! We walked around Chelsea Market some more and grabbed a cookie. While we're waiting in line for the cookie, my husband says to me, ""I think I want another taco!"" So he leaves me to go get two more tacos. So don't get just one. The only thing I regretted was not getting two tacos myself. Don't pass up on this place! It's worth waiting in line for.

I loved them so much I got them two days in a row and ordered them for my friends. The salsa was spicy and tasted so much like what I have eaten in Mexico.
