A strong latin core of music and some hip hop mixed in occasionally. Everyone was well dressed and it was a good ratio of girls about 1:1 although it seems a good amount of them came with guys or groups of friends. The drinks were reasonably priced and they even had some fireball and tequila shot specials for around $4-$5 I believe.

Good music, usually a $10-ish cover. Small dance floor, decent crowd. I went last Friday night with a cousin who is visiting from Ecuador. Rather than have her carry around her passport, I told her to just bring an ID with proof of age instead.We make a quick stop at Shannons, and she gets in without so much as a 2nd look from the bouncer.  Next stop, Coco Havana. The main bouncer guy (stocky, goatee, maybe retired or off duty Hoboken P.D?) put on his best ""Columbo"" impersonation and wouldn't accept it as a proper form of ID.  Fine, I get that each bar might have different rules or leniency in terms of ID. I don't have an issue with that. What I do have an issue with is his nasty and condescending attitude to someone whose only ""crime"" was not having a US identification. There's absolutely no reason for a doorman with an attitude problem and a power trip to harass potential customers. Oh, and they only have 2 bathroom stalls for the entire place, so both boys and girls have to wait 10-15 mins to handle their business. Bad. 1 star.",Coco Havana,3.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

The brunch entrees are reasonably priced and there is a variety of Cuban items. The Cuban Egg sandwiches are good! Steak & Eggs. The skirt steak is cut thin, so no matter how you order it, it will be well done (and I've ordered medium rare and then rare several times). We just go with the flow.

Well this is basically my story on a Friday night. I searched up Cuban food in the area and mistakenly went to the wrong Cuban restaurant. Yes, silly me. Any who, onto the food, drinks and overall experience. A solid 3/5. The nicest thing for me at this particular restaurant was the intimate set up. The dimly lit candles, the music and the overall ambiance. Walking into the restaurant, you're immediately greeted by a friendly host. We were asked if we had reservations and even though we didn't, it wasn't a problem and we were seated immediately. After being seated it took about 10 minutes for someone to come and greet up. Mistake number one! After we were finally greeted, we were told bread would be out shortly (and if by shortly you mean 20 minutes, UH OKAY) Weird enough, the bread might've been worth the wait -- SUPER GOOD and made to perfection. I know, I know it's just bread and carbs (OMG) I'll calm down now. Wait, I don't even think we were asked what we wanted to drink for another 10 minutes and the mediocre drinks (a white sangria for myself and a corona for the hubs) were def not worth the wait. As you can see, service here is practically non existent. And maybe after 40 minutes we finally had our dinner. I ordered the Vaca Frita -- crispy, twice cooked flank steak, sliced thin, onions and dressed with fresh lime wedge and two sides .. tostones and sautéed asparagus. The steak was completely dry, the asparagus wasn't the best also. Despite that, portions were fairly great. Personally, I just couldn't get over the steak stuck in my throat with every bite. The steak also lacked a lot of flavor. Perhaps because it was cooked twice. My tostones were a hit and were quickly devoured. For what we paid, I def didn't think this restaurant was worth it. The service was a huge let down and the food didn't make up for it at all. In the wake of my less than satisfied experience here I probably wouldn't return.",Coco Havana,3.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

Just made it here at 7, right after happy hour ended which was extremely disappointing because this place would be amazing for happy hour! Prices for the appetizers and drinks is so griffin reasonable for Hoboken it's insane! Music and ambiance is reggaeton (classics & new) so it's an amazing time - as long as you like the music. Tried to use my Groupon that I bought for Havana Central but because of the name change they would not accept it which is fine cause we had a great time and food was delicious! Ordered the appetizer sampler and the baby pernil to share. Off the appetizers the empanadas and the potatoe rellena and the shrimp over toast was delicious!! It was actually quite surprising because the shrimp over toast had bits of chorizo on it and drizzled with syrup or something and it's amazing! Empanadas we ordered the chicken and it was delicious! There was a taco and it is delicious! Baby pernil was okay not great and not bad, I have tons of pernil before.

When the food did come out my entree was cold. I ordered the oxtail with white rice and ""fried fingerlings."" It sounded good when the waiter said it was sautéed potatoes. But it was def not cooked well. The potatoes were hard. The oxtail wasn't as soft as I thought it would be. The meat was toooo chewy. I didn't want to send it back just because we had waited for a while for for our entrees to come out. So since it starts to turn into a lounge at night they needed to empty out the tables.

Had guac & tostones which were decent. The chicken and beef empanadas were surprisingly not bad. There was definitely enough meat inside and the filling was also pretty saucy which help up nice in the pastry. Had salmon with a side of yuca and sauteed spinach. The salmon was alright. Didn't really care for the pineapple salsa on top but the sauce that came with it was on point! Drenched the salmon and dipped the yuca in that sauce. The baby pernil was kind of dry.

Forgot how much we paid, but it was a certain amount for 2 hours unlimited sangria during our dinner. Service was a little slower on Saturday because of how packed it was.

During my visit, I had the croquettes and the food was delicious. One weird thing. During our visit, we learned that the restaurant did not have ropa vieja available. It was kind of weird that a cuban restaurant did not have this dish. That said, the other people in my party were happy with their dishesThe restaurant had a nice, open decor and everything in the restaurant looked pretty new. The service was a little slow at first but it got better as we were throwing back mimosas. This restaurant seems like a great place to score food and drinks.

The average price for most of the dishes hover around the 10 dollar range. Also, there is an unlimited mimosas, bellini, and bimosas (sp?) 2-hour deal for 29 bucks that you cannot beat. During my visit, I had the croquettes and the food was delicious. One weird thing. During our visit, we learned that the restaurant did not have ropa vieja available. It was kind of weird that a cuban restaurant did not have this dish. That said, the other people in my party were happy with their dishesThe restaurant had a nice, open decor and everything in the restaurant looked pretty new. The service was a little slow at first but it got better as we were throwing back mimosas. This restaurant seems like a great place to score food and drinks. Also, Coco Havana has some great happy hour prices and drinks. Plus, it is really close to the Path train, so it serves as a perfect meetup place. I definitely wouldn't mind going back to try some of Coco's dinner items and/or mojitos.",Coco Havana,3.0 star rating,$$,Cuban

I've worked at a Cuban restaurant in my past life and have made plenty of mojitos this mojito lacked sugar and muddling, it tasted like a watered down rum and club soda with pieces of lime in it, very disappointing. Tostones- were as hard as a rock and one of them was served on my plate on the dark side, not toasty, borderline burned color. I didn't eat any of them. Ok, let's talk about the rest of the food. Vaca frita, very flavorful and NOT dry, and Moro was cooked perfectly. Salmon was cooked perfectly and the yuca con mojo was nice. Churrasco, cooked perfectly and rice and red beans were good.

The place was fairly empty at the time, so we got decent seats at the bar. The ambiance of the restaurant was one of its best aspects; however, things went downhill from there. We order our food and wait for at least 1 hour in an empty restaurant before our dishes start to come out. That's fine, maybe they're short staffed in the kitchen or something. However, of the 6 things we ordered, only 2 initially came out as the correct dishes. One friend was missing a side dish. One friend was missing a sandwich. One friend was missing an entire order. After we spoke them, we realized they had completely neglected to make some of our items. We waited even longer for them to get everything right.

So yes that menu pleased me and eventually the beverages I chose satisfied my taste buds (ordered the mint mango daiquiri-which was massive and so up my alley, and some mojito which had a sugar cane decor to it). the bartender was super cool so that added to the fun and enjoyable factor. My buddy's a vegetarian and so when we asked he bartender what he'd recommend he gave us several suggestions. We eventually went with the guac and tostones. We also ordered guacamole and tostones to share. The tostones were crunchy and salted perfectly. Never been a fan of guacamole so I can't review that.

The service was frustrating since there were only now 3 tables (including us) but plenty of waiters (5) that literally would disappear for 15 minutes at a time . We started trying to imagine if they were in the back with some crazy tense domino game or something? This is how you know the situation was dire,  the other 2 tables were talking about how their waiter was disappearing. The other table responded ""welcome to the club."" It was a shame because the food was decent. Their Galician soup is very yummy. The arroz con pollo and tacos were ok. But regardless I would've come back if the service wasn't so lacking the basics: Check in on your tables, make sure your guests have water/refills, ""look in"" the dining area to see if any customers have been waiting for some time to get your attention (all the tables were going through this) again and again and again,   it was a waiting game.
