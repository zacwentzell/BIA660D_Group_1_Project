My husband got the Enchiladas Suizas and he absolutely loved them. The Rice and Beans are also really good. I got the Cheese Empanadas and they even added beans to them (I am a vegetarian).  They were very accommodating to my food restrictions. I have read all the one or two star comments and they all seem to be about language barriers, not about the flavor.  The place is family run and even if it takes a long time, it is totally worth it (our food came out in a normal amount of time)!!! My husband is American and I am Mexican.  He said that it's ""Nice to have a place to take my super picky wife to, as she never stops complaining about the lack of good authentic Mexican food in the area.""  He also said that it's half the price of what we'd pay downtown and in posting this review, I'm encouraging all of the other yuppies and they will ""ruin it"".  I hope that you will check out Mike's Restaurant and have the great experience that we did!",Mike’s Restaurant,3.0 star rating,$,Mexican

Velvety black beans and fluffy yellow rice. My god, do I love Mike's. Arguably the cheapest and most delicious bite in the Heights you can get at almost any time of day. Highly recommend.",Mike’s Restaurant,3.0 star rating,$,Mexican
2,go0sgr6XVHY1PI-D9YsACA,J H.,1.0 star rating,Pure garbage - never EVER eat here- they served old cold food and then expected me to pay for it - which I did anyway - this place is a toilet and I hope it gets shut down,Mike’s Restaurant,3.0 star rating,$,Mexican

4,lIcIMcPkS_tHkLS1qgYG2w,Jonathan M.,3.0 star rating,"Another good meal here.  The salsa was good, nice with a hint of sweetness.  The quesadillas looked awesome and everyone seemed to enjoy them.  However, they did say the texture of the chicken was a bit odd.  The burrito hit the spot for my friend, complete with a nice side salad.The steak fajitas were on point.  The steak was a bit tough, but overall still really good.  Huge portion may put you in a food coma.Oddly enough, the guacamole, although good, tasted like someone accidentally spilt a ton of salt into it.",Mike’s Restaurant,3.0 star rating,$,Mexican
5,jTtzGOYptbOiOabCCdkXyg,Dot S.,1.0 star rating,"Worst service EVER. Slow as a sleepy sloth and unless you speak Spanish, you can just forget it- they struggle with English, screw up your order and it always takes more than 30 minutes, even for a simply burrito. I walked out last time because it was taking waaaaay too long. Bring a sleeping bag if you eat here as you will need a nap waiting for your messed up order. If you are Hispanic, your order comes out magically in 3 minutes. If you are a gringo, have a seat and prepare to wait an hour or more. Not kidding.",Mike’s Restaurant,3.0 star rating,$,Mexican

Definitely one of my favorite places in Jersey City Heights.  $10 for a packed steak burrito: a huge flour tortilla stuffed with rice, beans, meat (of your choice), lettuce, salsa, cheese, and guacamole-- all well- seasoned and cooked well. SO good (if you're in the mood to stuff your face with Mexican food). Great spot to order from on a lazy, rainy Saturday night.Also don't let looks deceive you as their business name and store awning may creep you out, once you enter it's actually pretty cute and authentic! Especially with the lovely Mexican lady standing at the counter sporting a huge toothy smile.",Mike’s Restaurant,3.0 star rating,$,Mexican

Rude as well. Plenty of of other fantastic Mexican places in the are, don't waste your time.",Mike’s Restaurant,3.0 star rating,$,Mexican
8,lEZqmPS1Z3sArK1KECw2qA,Anthony B.,4.0 star rating,"A hole in the wall, yes. BUT A MUST TRY if you're a Spanish food lover. The cheese empanadas are the best cheese empanadas that I have ever had, hands down. I ordered one of the specials that they were making that day, it was SO GOOD. ..if only I remembered what it was called!Why didn't I give it 5 stars? Well, the atmosphere inside was a little too quiet for me. The woman that took my order couldn't really communicate with me very well due to a language barrier, but she was trying which is OK in my book. The place was Empty, without a doubt. Could use a little loving on the decor, too. It's kinda sad in there. This is a great place for take-out or delivery, in my opinion. I wouldn't exactly bring a date there. Definitely something for the locals to try out.",Mike’s Restaurant,3.0 star rating,$,Mexican
9,bYUDlWVbI_KvwmMCBFBA_w,Jerry K.,2.0 star rating,After being treated so badly I won't be going back regardless of the food being pretty good. I ordered dinner for two. One sandwich and an order of  enchiladas. I called in the order for pick up to save a few dollars on delivery. I did have to order in Spanish because the women speaks no English. So its pretty simple uno order of sandwich and uno order De enchiladas. So when I pick up the food I see a bill for 30.00 dollars.I asked why so much? The women said I ordered two orders of enchiladas. I clearly said one order she became nasty and basically yelled at me saying I asked for two shoved the bag of food in my face demanding I pay in full.  I paid left before I flipped out on her. Mike or who ever owns this place get someone who understands English or spanish. Uno is a pretty simple number and I won't be going back,Mike’s Restaurant,3.0 star rating,$,Mexican
