I ordered the Large wings and drumstick combo and an order of french fries. They offer two sauces for the chicken-- garlic soy & sweet & spicy. Both sauces were delicious. I preferred the garlic soy but my partner loved the sweet and spicy. Chicken was freshly prepared and juicy the way fried chicken should be. Pricing wasn't bad, service was quick, employees were very friendly.I've never done their take-out so I can't speak to that experience.",Chicken Factory,3.5 star rating,$$,"Chicken, Wings,, Korean"
1,tt1vLgAP5UpRXAKJLT2KWg,Alec K.,4.0 star rating,"Good place to get fried chicken with Korean-esque sauces. The food itself is pretty good and I eat here at least once a month. They have a good looking store and their prices are roughly the same as most Hoboken establishments. Their two sauces are decent, although the quality of the sweet and spicy sauce is much higher then that of the soy garlic, and I do wish they'd add more sauce options, with only two things get boring pretty quick. Unfortunately Chicken Factory has a pretty long wait time for food to come out of the kitchen. When you finally get it, the quality can very quite a bit. In each box we find around  the pieces are great looking and taste/feel great. The other pieces can be shriveled or have immensely hard/crunchy portions, some pieces have too little sauce on them and all you taste is the chicken. The size of pieces very as well and some are far too large. As for their non-chicken dishes, their cole slaw is decent but I find their Japchae to be of poor quality. As other people have said, sometimes their rice is burnt. Overall a decent place for a lunch or dinner in Hoboken.",Chicken Factory,3.5 star rating,$$,"Chicken, Wings,, Korean"

We ordered the large wing and drumstick combo, half sweet & spicy half soy garlic with a side of fries. We placed the order through Yelp and was pleased to see how easy it was to use.Upon picking up, I wanted to redeem the check in offer for a free bottle of soda, but the employee was very short and said that they ""don't do that"".. I was more disappointed at how the employee handled it than not receiving the free soda. After being turned down, we picked up the order and were on our way to eat at the comfort of my boyfriend's living room. When we unpackaged the food, we saw the chicken to be sufficiently sauced, which is a very important to me, and that the fries were soggy from the steam. I wish the box was ventilated, even with 3 or 4 poked holes, to let the steam out a little.Despite the soggy fries, the chicken was delicious and seemed fair for the price that we paid. The interior the restaurant was not very clean or cozy, screamed ""take out"" more than ""eat in"", so I was expecting a little more in terms of packaging of food for take out.

7,_3KlXVIhrKd-LNFZ1dnc7g,Shane B.,4.0 star rating,Tried this place for the first time and got both wings and bugolgi. I'll start with the bugolgi which I'd say was 3/10 it had decent taste but just didn't taste fresh. It also came with salad rice and 2 other sides which I did not order and there was no mention of on the menu. I thought for the price I'd get 2-3x the amount of meat I was given considering the menu states only the meat and rice were in the meal. I would not order again and would not recommend it. I also got a large order of wings and split the sauce. Most people complain that the soy ginger doesn't taste like soy ginger at all but what I got was a nice crispy wing that had a touch of soy flavoring which was nice because it didn't over power the great taste of the chicken. The spicy sauce was also a tad spicier than what I would normally like but had fantastic flavor. I appreciated the mix of large drum sticks with wings. It was also pretty great biting into the wings and having them still steaming hot even though I ordered delivery. Wings were 9.5/10 in taste texture and were a decent value too. I would highly recommend either sauce or even splitting it if you don't mind spicy.,Chicken Factory,3.5 star rating,$$,"Chicken, Wings,, Korean"

Korean fried chicken is one of the best tasting treats you can have, it's truly an experience that is unlike any other.I've gone here several times, )usually after some drinking is involved). I have friends who live in Hoboken and we always bring back an order of two of the spicy garlic wings. These things are amazing, super crispy and spicy and leave you wanting more. Definitely the most addicting chicken wings I've ever had.As for the prices... Not too friendly. They have two choices,  small for about 13.99 or a large for 20 and change. A small is more than enough for one person who isn't extremely hungry, but it definitely isn't cheap. Best bet is to get a large and split it with drinking buddies.Also, calling ahead is a smart idea because these wings aren't cooked until you order them, so you could wait 20 minutes or more for their food.They are open decently late and the people are pretty friendly.

Nothing compares to the original BonChon.  Might I also add that here on the this side of the Hudson, a small order of chicken means: - 9 pieces for $11.99-- how is this small and how is this cheap?  You can mix and match the flavors and chicken types.  I got the wings and drums- note that the ""drums"" are not the small drums, but rather, whole chicken drums.  I didn't know this. A whole drum is too heavy Korean Fried Chicken style- so stick with just the wings; you get the small drums too. - 20 min wait for double fried chicken- which is pretty standard-A dry ""Soy Garlic"" and a way too saucy/tangy Sweet and Spicy Sauce. The latter seems to be unique to Chicken Factory, and it's prob. their take on the American Buffalo wing as the Lord knows American is pretty rampant here in Hobokes.. it was too messy, saucy, and tangy for me. Unlike the American buffalo sauce though, it was actually spicy.  The Soy Garlic was done wrong completely- Soy Garlic is never supposed to be dry and lacking in flavor. This Soy Garlic didn't have enough 1) Garlic, and 2) Sauciness.

They've got the whole Korean fried chicken thing going on - if you find yourself a fan of places such as, oh, Bon Chon, you'll love it here. They've got the fix you need if you find yourself a Hoboken local.You will get your wallet kicked in if you order from here regularly. On top of squeezing you dry for their food (it is worth every penny, or close to it, anyway), you've got high delivery minimums and the like. $19 for a large thing of boneless filet, plus a few cans of soda, plus tip, comes out to around $27ish in total. Oof. Starts to add up after a while. I've never been inside this place, so this review is strictly on delivery.- Usually on time (within 35 minutes)- Always gets your order right- Your wallet will be crying and your credit card company will be thankful this place exists- Chicken is yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!- Sweet & Spicy is thebomb.com",Chicken Factory,3.5 star rating,$$,"Chicken, Wings,, Korean"

For the chicken, you have the option of 2 different sauces, Soy Garlic and Sweet Spicy and for the chicken you have the option of Wings, Wings and Legs or the Whole Chicken! Yessss the Wholleee chicken. Thighs, legs, and breast.. white meat or dark meat. Not only that but this place serves up some of the more popular korean dishes such as bulgoki, bibimbap, and jab che! All great options that will keep everyone satisfied, not to say that the chicken doesn't do the job but it's always great to have options.I ordered the large whole chicken, mixed with both sauces for $20. I'd say a large order is more than enough for 2 people. With every order you also get a side of their pickled radish and a soda, which is a great way to end the meal. The skin was so crispy and the chicken was also juicy, just the way it should be made! The thighs were definitely the best pieces and the white meat was so-so. It's great that this place is so close to home to, I can stop by practically whenever I feel like it.
