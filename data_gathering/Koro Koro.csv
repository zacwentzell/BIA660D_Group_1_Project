Well, triangles to be exact but you know what I mean.This cute little whole-in-the-wall of a restaurant is very easy to miss so keep an eye out for it!There is a small table you can eat the food at but it's clear this place is mostly take out. That's because this is the perfect food for take out if you don't want to deal with a soggy sandwich. We needed a meal for our night flight which was leaving at 6. Which meant we needed to buy the food around 4 so we needed something that could be eaten cold. Sandwiches were the only option but lots of them get soggy.Fortunately, we found rice balls! The perfect food for this situation! The food comes individually wrapped and it comes in such a way that the seaweed wrap is kept separate from the rice so it stays super crunchy!We ordered a bunch of flavors. There were so many! The Korean BBQ and miso beef were the best by far. The Yaki chicken was also delish. You really only need about 3 for a filling meal so I could go with those 3. I also tried the salmon which didn't have much flavor and the Moroccan, which was a little too sweet for my liking.Hopefully they bring this to Cali!",Koro Koro,4.5 star rating,$,"Japanese,, Comfort, Food,, Food, Trucks"

I ordered the miso beef and Korean BBQ chicken and ate both with a little bit of soy sauce and spicy mayo. My friends also has positive reviews of the Cuban and spicy salmon rice balls. They are a little messy to eat but just grab a fork for anything that falls out. They are offering a winter special - buy 3 and get 1 free when you pay with cash (4 for $10.50) which is a great deal for those who have good appetites, want leftovers or want to split with a friend. For those who require it, it's good to note that everything there is gluten free so the menu is your proverbial oyster.

Today i placed an order to go at 5:46. I called back at 6:28 to see if it was near. Because i know it is about a 15 minute walk from my address. The employee on the phone let me know it should be at least another 5 minutes. I called back at 6:44pm to ask if they were near because at that point i would've just come to pick it up. The owner answered. Put me on a brief hold and them preceded to tell me that im lying i actually placed the order 20 minutes ago and i need to basically be patient and im basically a liar. Im looking at my phone baffled at how im being spoken to. ESPECIALLY BY someone who called themselves the owner. He then proceeded to tell me hes gonna go me a favor by giving me the food for free and i dont have to worry about paying for it. As if i would eat it at this point. I hung up. Because i was obviously upset. He called me back to ask me if i hung up. I said yes. Then he asked me what i wanted him to do with the food. I said to shove it up his ass. Then he called me back to basically yell at me some more. Great customer service.

I mean, it only serves triangle rice balls and a few sides, how awesome can it be?  Additionally, I've eaten triangle rice balls before and knew what I would be getting.  If you've ever had a Korean kimbap before, it's exactly like that, only in triangular form.  The rice balls at Koro Koro are the triangular kind with lots of different stuffing options ranging from your standard Asian flare (a la the spicy salmon) to your modern western take on a standard asian dish (ie: cochinita pibil).Except for the umeboshi (there just wasn't enough... only three pieces of pickled plum to be exact leading to way too much rice and not enough filling) I very much enjoy all the different triangle rice ball options offered here.  What's even better than all of their delicious choices and flavors, is that all of the rice balls are generously filled and the rice to filling ratio is spot on (except for the umeboshi).  I especially like the different rice ball of the days that they offer - in fact every time I order their rice ball of the day, it ends up being my favorite that day!  So far I have tried the following: cuban, spicy salmon, yama chicken, umeboshi, cochinita pibil, Korean bbq, and the rice balls of the day.  Each rice ball tastes exactly as they describe on their menu and I have not been disappointed with my choices.  The space is small, and so it's much more comfortable taking your order to go, but my interaction with the staff has been pleasant, and I appreciate how they label each rice ball so it isn't a surprise when I bite into the food.",Koro Koro,4.5 star rating,$,"Japanese,, Comfort, Food,, Food, Trucks"

I'll admit that when I first saw it, I had low expectations. It was a miso soup base with large chunks of eggplant and sweet potato in it. Since I don't love either vegetable and was pretty overwhelmed by the size of the chunks, I almost went through the entire soup without trying it but I decided to give it a chance. It ended up being great! The sweet potato and eggplant was cooked perfectly and it added a nice savory element to the soup.The staff there is so friendly and helpful.
