12,jgU8W1c78e-ZHFSXg2M-1w,Jennifer C.,1.0 star rating,"I rarely write Yelp reviews but I feel the need to after having such a HORRIFIC dinner experience at the Turtle Club. My first and ONLY visit to this restaurant.On my birthday, my friend made a reservation for the two of us to have an early dinner at the Turtle Club. We arrived 10 minutes early and saw that the small but quaint dining area only had one couple seated.The two of us stood at the front desk for at least 5 minutes as waiters and waitresses continued to walk back and forth ignoring us. Finally I stopped an employee who turned out to be the hostess and said we would like to be seated in the dining area. She asked me if we had a reservation, which was quite strange considering the dining room was practically a ghost town... I said we had a reservation in 10 minutes. She gave us a frustrated look and grabbed two menus to seat us.Put off already, she sat us at the first small table for two directly in the hall when you enter the dining room. The table is the worst table in the room, it is poorly-lit, right next to a door, and in the middle of where servers walk back and forth.I went back to the hostess to simply ask if we could pick a table towards the back window. I never thought this would have presented an issue but my goodness! My smile was immediately wiped away when the hostess said she wasn't sure if any other tables were available. How are no other tables available when there is only one couple sitting in the otherwise empty dining room? The hostess went back and forth with me refusing to give us a better table, which made me simply speechless for a moment. I asked to talk to another employee to discuss this after explaining that we had a reservation. A man came out to discuss and before even saying hello, he asked ""Do you have a reservation? We cannot seat you without one."" For the millionth time, we said we had a reservation for right now. He replied that we could not move to another table because all of the other tables were reserved for other reservations?! Sounds ridiculous, I know.My friend continued to argue with the two hostesses and asked to speak to a manager. I explained that it was my birthday and all I wanted was to have a nice meal... why is asking for another table such a big deal when the dining room is essentially empty?! The hostesses eventually caved and gave us the table we wanted. The service was uncomfortable being that the man who was just arguing with us ironically became our waiter. I had the meatloaf and my friend had a hamburger. We both agreed that the food took way too long to come out since there was only one other table sitting in the dining room with us. Plus, I wasn't a huge fan of the taste of my meatloaf.The kicker at the end of this review... only ONE other table showed up during our entire meal! By the time we left, there were only 3 tables in the dining room. So 1/8th of the dining room was taken. So much for reservations, huh? What an unbelievably poorly ran dining room. Perhaps the bar is much better but I highly recommend you stay away from dinner at the Turtle Club.

13,XNY6tbZDetgEyeqh2_q_Ag,Allison B.,5.0 star rating,"My fiance and I were planning on our engagement photos occuring in Hoboken, when our photographer had the idea of taking pictures of us in a favorite Hoboken restaurant (with wine in hand, obviously). Turtle Club was the FIRST place that came to mind, because not only is the food delicious, but it's where fiance and I shared our very first dinner date, and kept coming back ever since. I called Turtle Club to ask if it would be possible to have part of our photos taken in the restaurant. Jessica the manager, was warm from the get go, congratulating me, taking down notes, and being so facilitating that it made me extra excited to have our pictures taken somewhere that has so much meaning to us. Her enthusiasm for us, brought so much MORE excitement to what was already such a big moment for the two of us.When we arrived at Turtle Club on Sunday, we were given an ideal table to sit and celebrate with our photographer. The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed, drink orders were quickly taken, our waiter actually asked us the reason why we picked Turtle Club and seemed really enthused for us, and service was wonderful, without being overbearing. Turtle Club's drink menu is awesome, and the prices are really good (their cocktail list looked incredible, but to avoid drunk engagement picture eyes, I decided to stick with red wine - a glass of Zin was $10). We also ordered food - fish tacos ($22) for me - there are three that come with your order, in addition to guac and rice and beans (one of my staples, since the veggie wrap that I usually die over wasn't on the menu), my fiance ordered the BRISKET MAC AND CHEESE, which is exactly as it sounds (this is one of his standby orders), and our photographer ordered the churrasco (Argentenian skirt steak, $22), which he said was delicious (though he think he had slight brisket mac and cheese envy). I think the part of an already great experience that set it over the edge (in a good way!) was when our server brought out the complimentary dessert to say congratulations. Any time you put blood orange sorbet in front of me, you've got me (and there was also a delicious chocolate lava cake as well). Turtle Club really pulled out all the stops for us, and we cannot thank the amazing staff there enough for helping us on such a special day. Overall, Turtle Club is a great place to grab some really fun and unique drinks, sit outside and people watch in the warmers months, eat delicious food that won't let you down, and have great service all at the same time. They also offer Open Table reservations, which is an added plus to just make life a little bit easier. One of our absolute favorite Hoboken restaurants, where we will keep coming back to, for so many reasons.",Hoboken Turtle Club,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

15,GRY2acZtI5q4P1KdCWhcUQ,Dave F.,4.0 star rating,"Really just an excellent all around spot that may very well become my neighborhood go to. The first visit here was one of the adult beverage variety. Beer selection is excellent, both on tap and in bottles. Pretty sure they don't have bud light or any other garbage beer on tap. Beyond that, he bourbon selection may be the best in Hoboken (although stewed cow was excellent as well). Yes, they have Pappy, and no, it is not reasonably priced, but that being said, I've not seen a reasonably priced glass of Pappy anywhere in years. The next visit had some of the small plates and one main. On to the food:Caesar salad - pretty much what you would expect for a Caesar salad; not sure what I can say beyond that. Mac and cheese - creamy and cheesy, and using ziti gives it both a nice bite and a vehicle to for the cheese to ooze into. Really nice dish. Spicy pulled pork sliders - before you bite into these, try a little piece of the pork on its own. It's stellar. Nice bite of subtle heat without being overwhelming, and not overly saucy at all. The cole slaw, pickle, and buns absorb a lot of the heat so don't think it's overpowering; it's well balanced and excellent. The fries it comes with are really good too. Fish tacos - the fish has a nice lightly blackened taste to it, and the fruit salsa pairs well with it. The major issue here is the tortilla. About 2 bites into the first ones, but bottom disintegrated and all the taco-y greatness falls to the plate. They need to either double up the tortilla or switch to flour. Between the excellent drinks and really quality food, I'll be coming back here again soon.",Hoboken Turtle Club,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

17,JZJIG5KdsJHITf0i0loGXw,Joe E.,4.0 star rating,"So, I'm torn with this review, mostly because each time we have eaten here, the food has been really good. The appetizers (while somewhat small) always taste fresh and are very enjoyable. Most recently, I had the buffalo chicken dip, which was pipping hot! In the past, I have had the Caprese Salad (three tomatoes and three pieces of mutz) which just seemed like a small slap in the face...but again, the entrees and the sandwiches are pretty great. In all honesty, I have tried each sandwich and they are filling enough on their own, but we always seem to order an appetizer because the wait is extremely long. I call it a two beer wait, which might not seem that long, but I have to order a third beer when my meal actually arrives. Now, you might say ""the place was really busy"" and I will quickly mention that it is not. I think the problem is more about the lack of servers, because it seems like their is usually one server for the entire restaurant. You might say ""it's because it is a small place"" and I will quickly say it is not. On our most recent trip, we arrived at 6:30, the dining room and outside had about 5 tables with people. The bar area was pretty busy, but otherwise, it was pretty slow. So maybe that is why there was one server, who did a good job at keeping tabs on us. I cannot say the same about the floating manager, although he did a really good job at keeping an eye on my beer as he chatted up some folks at the bar (there was also a bartender there). Anyway, the food, it's pretty amazing and pretty filling. The wait...well, there is a lot to choose from, so at least while you wait, you can enjoy a large assortment of drinks.",Hoboken Turtle Club,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

She gave us a frustrated look and grabbed two menus to seat us.Put off already, she sat us at the first small table for two directly in the hall when you enter the dining room. The table is the worst table in the room, it is poorly-lit, right next to a door, and in the middle of where servers walk back and forth.I went back to the hostess to simply ask if we could pick a table towards the back window. I never thought this would have presented an issue but my goodness! My smile was immediately wiped away when the hostess said she wasn't sure if any other tables were available. How are no other tables available when there is only one couple sitting in the otherwise empty dining room? The hostess went back and forth with me refusing to give us a better table, which made me simply speechless for a moment. I asked to talk to another employee to discuss this after explaining that we had a reservation. A man came out to discuss and before even saying hello, he asked ""Do you have a reservation? We cannot seat you without one."" For the millionth time, we said we had a reservation for right now. He replied that we could not move to another table because all of the other tables were reserved for other reservations?! Sounds ridiculous, I know.My friend continued to argue with the two hostesses and asked to speak to a manager. I explained that it was my birthday and all I wanted was to have a nice meal... why is asking for another table such a big deal when the dining room is essentially empty?! The hostesses eventually caved and gave us the table we wanted. The service was uncomfortable being that the man who was just arguing with us ironically became our waiter. I had the meatloaf and my friend had a hamburger. We both agreed that the food took way too long to come out since there was only one other table sitting in the dining room with us. Plus, I wasn't a huge fan of the taste of my meatloaf.The kicker at the end of this review... only ONE other table showed up during our entire meal! By the time we left, there were only 3 tables in the dining room. So 1/8th of the dining room was taken. So much for reservations, huh? What an unbelievably poorly ran dining room. Perhaps the bar is much better but I highly recommend you stay away from dinner at the Turtle Club. An utter disappointment, headache, and ruined birthday dinner.",Hoboken Turtle Club,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"
33,XNY6tbZDetgEyeqh2_q_Ag,Allison B.,5.0 star rating,"My fiance and I were planning on our engagement photos occuring in Hoboken, when our photographer had the idea of taking pictures of us in a favorite Hoboken restaurant (with wine in hand, obviously). Turtle Club was the FIRST place that came to mind, because not only is the food delicious, but it's where fiance and I shared our very first dinner date, and kept coming back ever since. I called Turtle Club to ask if it would be possible to have part of our photos taken in the restaurant. Jessica the manager, was warm from the get go, congratulating me, taking down notes, and being so facilitating that it made me extra excited to have our pictures taken somewhere that has so much meaning to us. Her enthusiasm for us, brought so much MORE excitement to what was already such a big moment for the two of us.When we arrived at Turtle Club on Sunday, we were given an ideal table to sit and celebrate with our photographer. The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed, drink orders were quickly taken, our waiter actually asked us the reason why we picked Turtle Club and seemed really enthused for us, and service was wonderful, without being overbearing. Turtle Club's drink menu is awesome, and the prices are really good (their cocktail list looked incredible, but to avoid drunk engagement picture eyes, I decided to stick with red wine - a glass of Zin was $10). We also ordered food - fish tacos ($22) for me - there are three that come with your order, in addition to guac and rice and beans (one of my staples, since the veggie wrap that I usually die over wasn't on the menu), my fiance ordered the BRISKET MAC AND CHEESE, which is exactly as it sounds (this is one of his standby orders), and our photographer ordered the churrasco (Argentenian skirt steak, $22), which he said was delicious (though he think he had slight brisket mac and cheese envy). I think the part of an already great experience that set it over the edge (in a good way!) was when our server brought out the complimentary dessert to say congratulations. Any time you put blood orange sorbet in front of me, you've got me (and there was also a delicious chocolate lava cake as well). Turtle Club really pulled out all the stops for us, and we cannot thank the amazing staff there enough for helping us on such a special day. Overall, Turtle Club is a great place to grab some really fun and unique drinks, sit outside and people watch in the warmers months, eat delicious food that won't let you down, and have great service all at the same time. They also offer Open Table reservations, which is an added plus to just make life a little bit easier.

35,GRY2acZtI5q4P1KdCWhcUQ,Dave F.,4.0 star rating,"Really just an excellent all around spot that may very well become my neighborhood go to. The first visit here was one of the adult beverage variety. Beer selection is excellent, both on tap and in bottles. Pretty sure they don't have bud light or any other garbage beer on tap. Beyond that, he bourbon selection may be the best in Hoboken (although stewed cow was excellent as well). Yes, they have Pappy, and no, it is not reasonably priced, but that being said, I've not seen a reasonably priced glass of Pappy anywhere in years. The next visit had some of the small plates and one main. On to the food:Caesar salad - pretty much what you would expect for a Caesar salad; not sure what I can say beyond that. Mac and cheese - creamy and cheesy, and using ziti gives it both a nice bite and a vehicle to for the cheese to ooze into. Really nice dish. Spicy pulled pork sliders - before you bite into these, try a little piece of the pork on its own. It's stellar. Nice bite of subtle heat without being overwhelming, and not overly saucy at all. The cole slaw, pickle, and buns absorb a lot of the heat so don't think it's overpowering; it's well balanced and excellent. The fries it comes with are really good too. Fish tacos - the fish has a nice lightly blackened taste to it, and the fruit salsa pairs well with it. The major issue here is the tortilla. About 2 bites into the first ones, but bottom disintegrated and all the taco-y greatness falls to the plate. They need to either double up the tortilla or switch to flour.

37,JZJIG5KdsJHITf0i0loGXw,Joe E.,4.0 star rating,"So, I'm torn with this review, mostly because each time we have eaten here, the food has been really good. The appetizers (while somewhat small) always taste fresh and are very enjoyable. Most recently, I had the buffalo chicken dip, which was pipping hot! In the past, I have had the Caprese Salad (three tomatoes and three pieces of mutz) which just seemed like a small slap in the face...but again, the entrees and the sandwiches are pretty great. In all honesty, I have tried each sandwich and they are filling enough on their own, but we always seem to order an appetizer because the wait is extremely long. I call it a two beer wait, which might not seem that long, but I have to order a third beer when my meal actually arrives. Now, you might say ""the place was really busy"" and I will quickly mention that it is not. I think the problem is more about the lack of servers, because it seems like their is usually one server for the entire restaurant. You might say ""it's because it is a small place"" and I will quickly say it is not. On our most recent trip, we arrived at 6:30, the dining room and outside had about 5 tables with people. The bar area was pretty busy, but otherwise, it was pretty slow. So maybe that is why there was one server, who did a good job at keeping tabs on us. I cannot say the same about the floating manager, although he did a really good job at keeping an eye on my beer as he chatted up some folks at the bar (there was also a bartender there). Anyway, the food, it's pretty amazing and pretty filling. The wait...well, there is a lot to choose from, so at least while you wait, you can enjoy a large assortment of drinks.",Hoboken Turtle Club,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

We all thought it was a great deal, and something different with their masquerade theme. The one or two passed hors d'oeuvres I had were great. I thought the food would have been subpar as the food at these types of events are, but to my surprise, it was pretty good! The main thing that sucked were the bartenders in the smaller area near the coat check. To me the male bartender was ok, but when I gave him a good tip (in my opinion) after my first round he seemed to have more of a personality, and didn't seem bothered when I asked for a drink for my friends and I. The woman who was bartending with him was a complete nightmare. If you asked for multiple drinks, she asked who they were for, and if they were visible she made you point them out. When she did that to me, I was a little taken aback but none the less I pointed out my two friends. She then goes ""Well that doesn't help me! Where are their stamps, do they have drinks in their hand?"" I was like whoa, what is your deal? The place was crowded you could barely hear.. let me give them clear instructions as to how we can all get our drink order in at the same time... get a grip. Also if you had half of a drink left she refused to serve you another drink until you were finished, even though the turn around time to get a drink was 5-10 mins because yea they were busy. Look lady, I get you're annoyed that you're working New Years Eve, but we all paid to get in here and to have a good time. Not to get a healthy attitude from you every time I asked to get what I paid for. Mind you, this is the attitude I received after I gave her the same tip I gave the other bartender. I understand its a major holiday, you're busy, you may rather be celebrating with your loved ones.. I get it. But don't take it out on everyone else that you're pissed. I didn't pay 95.00 + tips to get bitched at for getting a round of drinks for my friends who also paid the same amount of money to be there. If I got better service I would probably return, the place seemed like it could be fun on a night that wasn't so wild.

Overall, their drinks are always good, well made, and creative and their food is delicious. Unfortunately I went there with two friends recently on a Monday night and it was not pretty. Had I not made a quick res in open table about 15 minutes we showed up at 8pm, the waitress wouldn't have been able to seat us (despite there being plenty of open tables). Once seated, we put our appetizer order in pretty quickly but then we waited. And waited. And waited until almost 1/2 hour had passed! And then the waitress came and told us they were in fact out of the nachos we had ordered. Ok cool - not sure how that happens but we picked something else to start with. And waited. And waited. Another 1/2 hr for a couple of pork sliders. Kept trying to get the waitress's attention but to no avail. When asked what was taking so long, the waitress replied ""it's our kitchen, it's just really small and backed up today"". Really?! On a Monday night when half the tables aren't full?? So what happens on Thursday - Saturday?! People just don't eat??Needless to say, the entrees took forever (although tasty) and it felt like the waitress avoided us when we tried to get her attention (since it took another 15 min to get the check and me walking it up to the register for it to be charged)Oh and I got food poisoning for the first time in at least 5 yrs. that was fun.

I didn't eat here... so my review is strictly for the bar/ambiance.  You walk in and there's two bar areas, one to the left and the other to the right.  I guess the right side is considered the dining part, but if you go late enough it's just another bar.  We went to the left side and were able to get two tables for our large group since we got there kind of early.  It's a small space but never really felt too cramped.  Towards the end of the night I kind had to weave through people to get to the bar, but that's typical in bars like that.  They have the dim lighting which made the place warm and comfortable.The signature drinks are pretty yummy!  Kind of pricey at $12 each but again, that's typical for that area.  I tried the shrub and the sybils sip... both were on point! After that I just switched to vodka clubs and shots of soco :pA note for smokers... this bar is underneath several apartments so if you go outside the bouncers force you to be quiet!!  This is actually easier said than done haha.I'll definitely be back to the turtle club!!",Hoboken Turtle Club,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

Again, I really wanted to like this place because it looks charming and because of the positive reviews. Also, I know it's a tavern, but it would be great if they could offer one really good, healthy dish or dish that could be made vegetarian and not be bland or greasy or loaded with cheese.

The cost was 95 dollar for open bar till 1 am (top shelf liquor included) along with passed hors d'oeuvres for two hours and a champagne toast at midnight.Starting at the door, security was great. Once inside coat check was pretty smooth and the music was fine. At the bar everything went downhill. I approached with my husband and (female) friend to get our first drink. The female bartender in the small area took our order. My friend changed her mind about the drink she wanted so she waved her hand to get her attention before she poured it and the bartender backed up against the wall and told us we were making her ""extremely uncomfortable"" and not to ""lean over the bar"" because she didn't ""feel safe"". OOOOKKKK. We got our first drinks, tipped her and moved on. When my husband and I went back, I asked for two drinks and she asked who was the other drink for. Ummm, excuse me? I paid for open bar last time I checked but OK. I told her it was for my husband. She then asked me to point him out for her to confirm. I have NEVER heard of something like this before. This went on for the entire night. Needless to say it was not a pleasant experience. Shots were extra and she expected to get tipped with her nasty attitude and poor bartending skills.

With my roommate moving to the west coast in the month, we decided to have one of our final ""girls nights"" here for dinner ... Major mistake. The restaurant was nowhere near full capacity at 8 pm.. But you would think by the lack of service and quality of food it was slammed with a party of 100+. We started with the bruschetta, which took nearly 45 minutes to come to the table... It was three slices of cold white baguette with a little tiny ""smear"" of the topping .. The bread was super disappointing and the toppings were so small and tasteless. So I'm certainly confused why it took so long and why it was an $8 dish for something so poorly put together. We ordered dinner before our bruschetta came out, which also was a significant wait for something underwhelming. they have chicken saltimbocca on the menu for just under $25 (which makes sense since it incorporates chicken, prosciutto, a finer cheese, mashed potatoes, veggies, etc) .. But instead they had ""Mexican chicken"" which was a beaten over cooked piece of chicken with a handful of beans and pico de gallo on top and a small salad that looked like it came from acmes cold bar. The pico de gallo was more of a helping than the bruschetta though!Oh - my roommate got their TC burger ""medium rare"" which came out like a hockey puck. This was all consumed while our glasses sat empty without drinks because the waitress never came back to ask. The manager (or someone of that level) did come by to ask how everything was, and she didn't seem concerned with our dissatisfied response.

Nothing!  Inexcusable!  In 1.5 hours, I didn't see her pour or serve a single drink.  With the active bar scene in Hoboken, if you're a bartender who's not serving drinks during NFL games, there's something very wrong.  And to top it off, we were subject to overhearing her constant droning about Planet Fitness.The beer menu was okay; nothing to write home about.  And a number of the options were out of stock.  My buddy and I had a drink each, caught up a bit, and left.  We both agreed that TC was a big disappointment.",Hoboken Turtle Club,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

It was 3 little pieces of bread with a little garlic on one, cheese on another, and aparagus on the other. It was so light and not worth $8. The wings were nothing special either, even though the waiter raved about them. The shrimp and chorizo was also disappointing. It was two small pieces of bread with one piece of chorizo and 2 shrimp on each. Again, nothing special. The meals were decent. I liked the ribs and the fries it came with.

It was so slow and so cold that we ended up getting our entrees and dessert to go, because we had already been sitting in the cold for an hour and a half. They also told us to put the dessert in the freezer because there was ice cream that would melt .. got home and no, there was no ice cream.

When we found out Turtle Club had them on Tuesdays we gave them a try despite our last experience there being not so great. Learning from prior experience we ignored the open table option and called for reservations which were easily obtained. It wasn't totally bad but it wasn't the best we've tried. Most of the oysters tasted fresh. Hubby had a few fishy ones. Some of them were sloppily shucked and we got chunks of shell in the oyster. They came out gradually which I appreciate as we didn't have to wait long. Other elements of the night were slow service (we had to wait awhile to get drinks refilled) balanced with the nice atmosphere for a weeknight- people who were civilized but out to have a good time.

John Stevens.  This really has nothing to do with the place itself but I did give me an excuse to try it out.The menu is a little pricey but the paninis are affordable.  My friends and I have sampled a few items and all of them were top-notch.  We also got very excited about the Happy Hour special.  Most bars only discount select domestics; here ALL domestics were only $3.  Yup, that includes Sam Adams and Dogfish Head.Another night we went out on a Saturday to grab drinks.  The music was just right (selection and volume) and it was easy to get to the bartender.  Another plus was the chalkboard up top.  It showed all the available beers with their prices which eliminated the usual ""guess the price game"".  It also helps when there are plenty of brews to choose from.I can recommend the Turtle Club for anytime.  It's always fun and far away from the hustle and bustle of the PATH.",Hoboken Turtle Club,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

So back in the day, Colonel John Stevens, when he wasn't busy inventing steamships, trains and other things, or living in a castle, stated a social club for his buddies that included Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr and John Jay.

If I lived in a castle, I'd probably have started a club, too.So now that Goldhawk has been renovated into a fancy establishment, you'd think it'd be pretty expensive.

The decor is inviting, especially on a rainy and cold December night. Even though it wasn't crowded, service seemed oddly slow. I had the Juniper Cooler and the Queen Anne, both of which were light, fresh, and extremely tasty. For dinner, I had the mahi mahi, which was fine (and spicy so be careful!), but it didn't knock my socks off. My boyfriend had the Thursday night brisket sandwich special, which he absolutely loves. A problem arose when the bill came. Restaurant.com states that the certificate is good for ""dinner only,"" which I assumed meant we could not use it for lunch or brunch, but since we were there at 7pm, I thought everything would be fine. As it turns out, we were only allowed to use it for food, not drinks, which I thought was incredibly misleading. Like some Yelpers before me, I would give the Turtle Club five stars for drinks and decor, but the food and the service dragged my rating down.My recommendation?

When it came time to give our order our waitress, Meghan, was very obviously not paying attention to us and honestly seemed either drunk, distracted or on another planet. Unsurprisingly our orders were served incorrectly. We received an incorrect appetizer order and were missing THREE final meal orders! To make it worse, our waitress Meghan was taking sips from the cocktails at the table next to us. Yes, our waitress was drinking at the table next to us while she was working. She clearly had no care whether we would see her drinking in front of our faces while she was responsible for our service...which as I repeat was awful. Keila, another waitstaff member, further contributed to our wonderful experience by literally dipping her fingers into my cocktail before taking it away prematurely. At the end of the meal Meghan topped off our experience by throwing the check down on the table before blasting off to what I'm sure what was her next cocktail.

For such a ""grown up"" looking place, the menu is ""kid-like"".  Btw, just because you have truffle oil on the menu doesn't mean the food is good.  Service:  Slow and inattentive.  Waitress let us sit for long periods without asking us if we wanted more drinks.  We were by no means ""slugging them down"", but sat for most of our dinner without wine (my wife) or a club soda (myself) refill.  Waitress also forgot to put my salad order in and I sat there for a long period of time while my wife waited with her salad.Food:  Not horrible, but not good.  We started with the meat and cheese platter.  We had a choice of 3 cheeses, which included Muenster, Provolone and a few other uninteresting cheeses.  The plate was very small and consisted of 2 Salamis and Prosciutto (which seemed to be low quality prosciutto as it was hardened like the supermarket prepackaged and presliced variety.)  The platter was very small and had little cheese.  Next was the salads:  nothing great, but not terrible.On to the main courses:  We both had steak- my wife had the churrasco and I had the skirt steak.  I ordered the ribs as I read on yelp that they were great, but they were out.  The waitress suggested the skirt steak as it had the same ""spices"".  The skirt steak was basted in bbq sauce.  Definitely a little weird and didn't go well.  My wife's steak was better, but then again, both were cooked to mdedium/medium-well despite ordering them medium-rare.Overall, I wouldn't return.",Hoboken Turtle Club,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

Cute server, nice, friendly, but she obviously had too many tables because it took 10 minutes to take a drink order and to receive the drinks 20 minutes.Apps: We have the ""Meat and Cheese Plate""... which consisted of the SMALLEST triangles of cheese in history, store bought meats (like super cheap prosciutto and some other poorly cured meats that they COULD have gotten from the Italian deli down the street but instead they bought from Stop 'N Shop), and some miscellaneous fruits.We also had the bruscetta. Your choice of three, we had goat cheese, truffled asparagus and something else. The goat cheese with honey glaze was wonderful. Stole the show! The other bruscettas?  ..... eh.Entrees: What a joke. I got the ""soy ginger mahi-mahi"" or something... which was a frozen fish filet dunked in soy sauce. Couldn't eat it.My partner in crime (a chef in Jersey as well) got the pulled pork panini. The menu said it had Serrano Ham (a specialty I might add) and it was totally just a pre-sliced piece of deli ham on top of terrible pork that was BOUGHT pre-pulled.

I was bent on getting the crab dip, which turned out to be delicious. Warm, chunky, perhaps a bit too lemony, but all the same delicious. Our other appetizer was a hummus platter, which olives and carrots and pita for dipping. The hummus was pretty good, creamy and fresh, but it would not have been my first choice.For an entree, I stepped out of my fairly small ""dining out"" box, and ordered the very exotic (to me) fish tacos. I never had fish tacos before, but in the end I was happy I tried something new. The fried fish went nicely with the shredded lettuce, chunky corn salsa and the kind of sauce drizzled on top. The only problem I had was that the lack of flavor of the corn tortilla--the monotone dryness, threw off the moist flavorful insides. Also I kind of wish there was a little more sauce to counter the dry tortilla. My date got a churrasco style steak accompanied by a few asparagus and potatoes, which to me was odd. He and I have experienced too much ill seasoned and poorly prepared meat in our recent dining out history, but this steak was bursting with flavor and texture was just perfect.  I can't say much about the dish's accoutrements, because they faded into the background. The four of us also shared four desserts. We decided on the nutella Panini (crunchy, warm and chocolately sweet); the chocolate cake (dense, dry and bitterly chocolate); a sampler of vanilla, hazelnut, and chocolate gelati (cold, decadent and somewhat rich); and the pumpkin cheesecake (smooth, creamy with a subtle hint of crunch). I was partial to the pumpkin cheesecake. The top layer of pumpkin puree, reminiscent of pumpkin pie, was subtle, but made the already pretty good cheesecake a little more unique and exotic. I recommend going on a Monday night when all food is half priced. You can't beat that! I have also been since this first Turtle Club experience, and the food was not as good as I remembered.",Hoboken Turtle Club,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

147,-Q_Wn5nkCJG1SxM7BUlJcw,Rob M.,3.0 star rating,"When I read news of a new bar opening up in Hoboken naming itself The Turtle Club, I was optimistic. From early reports regarding decor, food options and beer selection, this place seemed to be aiming to cater to a different crowd than the typical Hoboken bar & grill.. which, as a 33 year old father of one, is a good thing.My wife and I have now been to the Turtle Club a few times and I can't help but have mixed feelings. Word on the street is the place gets packed on weekend nights. Fortunately for us, we've only visited on non-peak hours (Sunday/Weekday nights), and on each occasion it's been very empty and grabbing a table hasn't been an issue. The atmosphere is pretty cool, and on each occasion they've played some great tunes (Black Keys, Beck, Radiohead, The Strokes, etc) The menu is simple, perhaps a little much too so. There's a few paninis, a few apps, some salads and a few (4,5?) entrees. Each time we've went, they've been out of at least one menu item. Last night's not available item was ithe cuban panini. You couldn't eat here more than a few times without having to repeat items on the menu. That being said, the food is pretty good. It's hard to go wrong with any of their salads or paninis.As for the beer selection, at first glance it may seem impressive due to the sheer number - about 30 overall, but a quick browsing of their list reveals most of it to be mass produced domestic and imported crap that's available at every hoboken bar. True, you get your Dogfish Head 60 minute and your Long Trail, but otherwise I was stuck choosing between a Steel City or a Shiners to try something 'different'.  For my 2nd beer I went to the Dogfish on draft and sad to say, it tasted a little off. For a neighborhood option in Hoboken you could do a lot worse, but I can't help feeling that with an expanded food and beer menu that The Turtle Club could be so much better.",Hoboken Turtle Club,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

And the not so good.  The acoustics make it very difficult to have a conversation, or to hear the waitress for that matter.  Around 9:30 they turned up the volume on the music making it even worse.  The food portions were small.  Even though the prices were reasonable, you just don't get much to eat.  I think drink is more important to TC and its patrons than food.  Finally a word about ""street parking"".  We go to Hoboken often and usually park in a garage or on Washington at a meter.  Because TC is on Park, we cruised down it and found a great (if somewhat undersized) spot.  We were only there 2 hours, but were hit with a $68 ticket for parking in a permit only spot (if there was a sign, I didn't see it).Bottom line: Turtle Club is probably a good place to hang out, drink and meet 20 or 30 somethings, but not to eat, talk or park.",Hoboken Turtle Club,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

177,YA60zHiMZmgNZ8WFKGzGRA,Ahmad M.,2.0 star rating,"i found this place over-rated. It looks better from the outside. The food is okay, but nothing special to go out for, neither an interesting menu nor particularly well prepared food. The paninis and sliders are probably the better option over the steaks as a result. We went to check it out for the first time on a Monday night: So their advertized half-price food menu requires you to buy an alcoholic drink (they have a  good range to choose from including on draft), then a service charge of something like 30% or more is added on your check without warning, so if you want to go for that offer, make sure you have a designated driver and you read the check carefully. To be fair, the waitress was very good and it is only right that she should get a full tip and not a 50% reduced one, but some notice about that would be good, and it would also help to get reassurance that she will actually get the automatic service charge rather than the house. It is better as a bar where you can grab a simple bite. Certainly not ""epicurean.""",Hoboken Turtle Club,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

Drinks were ok (definitely average), food was meh, and the dj was out of sync with the crowd, talk about buzz killington. I have to say the staff was super nice and helpful, with the exception of one bouncer who really was very rude and full of himself, he acted like he owned this place and was yelling at some of the guests.Skip it, bars like that are a dime a dozen in hoboken",Hoboken Turtle Club,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"
