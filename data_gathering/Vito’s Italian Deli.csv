It's also one of the top 5 in Hoboken. That sounds weird, but it's a testament to how good the delis are here. Vito's is one of my faves, and makes a truly delicious, tasty sandwich.The guys that work here are real Italian Jersey guys. They're also really cool. The sandwiches are just off-the-charts spectacular. You cannot get better than a Vito's sandwich. There may be others in town that are just as good because this is the town of delis as I said. And this may be a little pricey. But Vito's is just perfect. I am absolutely in love with the sandwich and you will be too - once you try it.Another really great thing about Vito's is that they will put all kinds of delicious veggies and dressing on your sandwich which some other delis don't do. The fresh mozzarella as amazing as you would expect in Hoboken. You simply must try Vito's.And hey, I just met youAnd this is crazyBut here's my number (it's a Jersey number)So Corleone me maybe?So let me tell you, there's a secret. The best Italian delis in the world are not in New York City. They are not in your hometown of whateversville, Missouri. They are not in Italy or France (although there's some damn good sh** over there). Forget Long Island. Sorry Chicago. Nope. The best Italian delis in the world are in Hoboken and Jersey City. Yes, it's true. Don't ask me why, they just are.There are 5 spots in Ho-broken, all vying for the title of the world's best Italian Deli, I can't decide which of the 5 is best, and people I've taken to them have differing opinions. Although one thing we all agree on is: if the other 4 didn't exist, then the one remaining would be the best in the world. That's how good these 5 are.Fran's, Andrea Salumeria, M & P Biancamano, Vito's, and Fiore. I've been going between the 5 as my fave for the longest time, but if I had a gun to my head and I had to pick one: I'd pick all 5. And so should you.The selling point of all 5 (and all good delis in this area) is that they have Fresh Mozzarella. I mean fresh, fresh. It's literally fresh, like, still gooey, warm, squidy, just made, and absolute heaven. Their imported meats are the best of the best. Their breads and seasonings, incomparable. You can't get any better than these sandwiches. Come and try for yourself. They have ruined all Italian delis everywhere for me, forever.

So decadent that you really should be satisfied with one even though you're tempted to have half a dozen.Fast forward to today and I made it during their happy hour which brings down the price of the subs significantly. It was around 3pm and I was there with only two other customers. Everyone was helped quickly and efficiently. While I was waiting for my two hot roast beef with mutz and brown gravy (I'm not making the same mistake of *SHARING* one this time), I was having a casual conversation with a gentleman with a goatee (damn, I forgot to ask for his name). I mentioned that I was from California and I loved their sandwiches and cannolis. He was so nice and generous that he included a delicious cannoli on the house!

There is a rather high step in front of the entrance, desperately looking for a way to maneuver my stroller in, one of the workers saw me struggling and came to my rescue! The menu has plenty of options, I spotted a prosciutto & mutz so I ordered that. YUMMY! So good that I brought the family back a few months later and ordered the same thing. I do believe the secret is out though because the line on a weekend is quite long.

The first time I had Vito's my brother, who lives in Hoboken, introduced me and Mr. C. to the hot roast beef with mutz and brown gravy. Made me wish he got a *whole* one just for me and not cut into thirds to share (*eye roll*). He also introduced me to my very first cannoli which was heavenly. So decadent that you really should be satisfied with one even though you're tempted to have half a dozen.Fast forward to today and I made it during their happy hour which brings down the price of the subs significantly. It was around 3pm and I was there with only two other customers. Everyone was helped quickly and efficiently. While I was waiting for my two hot roast beef with mutz and brown gravy (I'm not making the same mistake of *SHARING* one this time), I was having a casual conversation with a gentleman with a goatee (damn, I forgot to ask for his name). I mentioned that I was from California and I loved their sandwiches and cannolis. He was so nice and generous that he included a delicious cannoli on the house!

Just saw the sign and went right in, not realizing what a gem this place is. First of, when reading the chalkboard menu and seeing MUTZ as an ingredient we were embarrassed to ask what the heck MUTZ is. Clearly it must of been some great ingredient because it was on everything. We even saw flags out on Washington St advertising a MUTZ festival....The deli also sold various salads, jarred pasta sauces, cookies, and more. But nothing gave me a clue as to what MUTZ was. So, we finally pick out our sandwich, the Italian Cuban, some chips and drinks. There's no place to eat in, so we took it back to our hotel room. After examining the sandwich, variety of meats, cheese and condiments, I could not figure out what the MUTZ was. The sandwich was delicious. Fresh ingredients and so tasty but still couldn't figure out what part is the MUTZ. Was it the bread, was it how it was wrapped. What!?!?A day later while visiting with family in the Bronx, we asked if they new what MUTZ was. Still no answer but after some discussion we figure it out to be the MUUUTZARRELLA!! Oh goodness.

The lines can be some what long in the small space, but they usually get you through quickly, and regardless, it's worth the wait. I had a roast beef sub and it was amazing. The bread was nice and crusty and the portions generous. While waiting in line I was enticed by the jars of homemade roasted garlic marinara and bought one to try. It is UNBELIEVABLE!!! On subsequent trips I stock up on multiple jars to use at home or to gift. Not to be out done, they have been voted ""Best Mutz"" (homemade mozzarella) at Hoboken's Mutz Fest...

They have everything you could want on, or for, a sandwich. I stayed and ate by sitting at one of their (few) outside tables and it was very nice.Bathroom: I doubt there is one for customers.Staff: Everyone was very friendly and accommodating.Food: My sandwich, a s classic Italian hero, was fantastic! It was just the right size, which is to say it's BIG, and the fixings were very, very tasty. It was served on hard bread, which I prefer soft, but I didn't think to ask for soft... my fault.

It can get messy when you are ripping apart the bread and juices fly all over the place.  They have a large selection of oils, vinegars, and other Italian delicacies for sale.  They have won multiple awards for the best Mutz in town, which is why I say this place is above the rest!!

I understand these mistakes happen and I know the guy in front of me ordered a Prosciutto+mutz+pesto sauce (which cost $1 less and I was not a fan of the pesto), so I'm really not too upset about a minor mistake. I called them up this morning when they opened to see if they would apologize or compensate me for giving me the wrong sandwich, but all I got was a laugh in the face... hahaha very funny (not...!)It's not even about the money, its the principle behind how they handled the situation. Even though $11 for a sandwich is rather excessive compared to the other deli's in the area, the $1 is nothing. I can't tell you just how excited I was for that Parma Prosciutto.

The sandwiches are plenty large enough to split which helps to offset the cost (approximately $10-$11 per sandwich).We were a little confused about the ordering situation when we walked in. We figured out the best way to order is to place the order for your sub, and while they make it, check out everything else in the store (drinks, pasta, homemade pasta sauce) and when they call you up to grab your sandwich, take all your other provisions up and pay at that point.I'm very excited to return and try all of their other sandwiches as well as their pasta salads.",Vito’s Italian Deli,4.5 star rating,$,Delis

I ordered Prosciutto di Parma and Mozzarella, that's it, nothing else (the Italian way). I was very excited to devour this almighty sandwich, but it fell short. Here are my reasons:1. The bread is not your typical Italian deli 'tear your gums apart' bread. It's soft rectangle-ish and yellow, whereas I'm used to the long pointy BROWN crispy bread for my sammiches.2. The mozzarella was barely noticeable in the sandwich. Fresh homemade mozzarella, is supposed to be warm, juicy, and... MILKY. Taste like nothing. 3. I paid $14.50 for the sandwich and a SnappleThe Prosciutto was a tad salty and I'm not sure it was exactly Parma, considering it was bright red as to a more browner color in that of Parma Prosciutto. But either way the taste was good. I won't go back, although they have a nice market selling packaged Italian foods/novelties I can go elsewhere for that. I strongly recommend M&P Biancamano Deli a few blocks uptown. Best mozzarella in Hoboken. If you want GREAT mozzarella go to Giovanni's in Secaucus.

We're talking tongue to the point of your head. Better than whippits. The only drawback is that you need to finish it in one day. It loses its taste and texture soon after.

For such a long standing establishment you think they would have some kind of clearly labeled line system worked out.When you enter you'll see one line on the right and another spattering of people on the left, that sort of looks like a line as well. It's unclear where you should stand - who had ordered - where to go if you want to quickly grab a packaged item and go. Which line do you wait in? Why does it take 10 minutes to serve 5 people when there are more than 5 people working behind the counter?When I finally got to the end of the line on the right - that I discovered was the line for ordering a sandwich, I told the man that I would like a turkey and provolone cheese sandwich on whole wheat bread with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and mustard with no oil or mayo.  He asked it I wanted vinegar and oil, which I found strange. I told him please no oil or mayo. He said he'd only put on the sandwich what I told him.  Then he asked me to repeat my order.When I opened the sandwich it was on white bread.Ok.  I understand they are busy, but that was strange.Also it would be nice if the cashier hustled a little but because everyone else around her is in constantly in motion, while she stares ahead - not proactive about trying to assist people that are either waiting in line or looking confused. On a side note, they are a bit gruff on the phone.  I had tried to order a sandwich at 8:30 over the phone - half hour after their posted opening time.  The man that answered said, ""Lady, do you just know we opened?"" when I tried to place an order with him.So.

I had to get a drink and chips also for them to deliver it since it was only one sandwich so all together came to $20. A little pricey I know. Once it finally arrived I couldn't unwrap it fast enough but then saw the grilled chicken and not cutlet and pretty much almost teared up. I was going to let it go till I looked into the sandwich to see NO Muzz and regular sundried tomato instead of their spread. I'm not one to ever call to complain about food but for 20 bucks no Muzz and no cutlet I had to. The woman was super nice and said they would send me over a new one immediately. (Thank goodness). Once the second one arrived I did get grilled chicken for a second time instead of cutlet but at this point I was eating it anyway.

There are 3 separate instances where the customer service by the person at the cash register has just driven me nuts.  This, for the most part, has nothing to do with the guys who make the sandwiches. 1) refused to let me use my debit card on a $9 purchase even though I used to go 2/3 times a week. I understand the $10 minimum but really to bust my chops over a dollar?  I had to have them up charge me to $10 because I had no cash. This all is understandable. What blows my mind is the next time I went the person had the ridiculousness to tell me ""sorry about last time you're a regular we shouldn't have done that"". I said ""no problem just take $1 off today's order.""  I received a chuckle and was charged full price. 2) They never charge the same amount for the same order. Mild pet peeve. 3) I was off a few days during the week and went in the afternoon to get a sandwich. They apparently have or used to have a special deal on subs in the mid afternoon. When I go to get rung up, the person who made the sandwich tells the person at the cash register to give me the ""special"" price to which she responded ""he's 3 minutes early"" and proceeded to ring me up full price. Really bad CS in my book. I should have left without paying and come back 5 minutes later but I was so befuddled I just paid and left.

There are a bunch of places where you can go, but there are a few that stand out more than others. Vito's is one of these really good deli's in Hoboken that you cannot go wrong with. It has a wide variety of food choices but you should mainly come here to get your Italian sub fix of the day. They have different choices for subs so you can order one of their specialty sandwiches or just create your own. I ordered the roast beef and mutz with gravy and thought it was very good. The bread was warm and soft, and the roast beef was of pretty good quality. None of that hard to chew stuff. The mutz was also pretty good and the gravy topped it all off. Just typing this up is making me crave another one.The shop is not very big but its a deli so it really does not matter The only issue is that during the lunch time rush, it can get a little hectic and crowded as people order and wait for the sandwiches. But I would say you are in and out the door in five to ten minutes tops. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and can answer any questions you have.Overall I gave Vito's four stars because of their delicious subs, the good quality of their subs, the friendly staff and the small Italian deli feel it has.

The bread is always fresh and has a great chewy crust.  As I said, the cold cuts are always sliced fresh to order and I believe they are Boars Head products if that means anything to anyone (it's more marketing than anything).  Another great option I choose sometimes is the chicken cutlet which is another good choice. This is all topped off with fresh veggies and an amazingly awesome fresh mozzarella that they hand cut in large chunks and put on your sandwich.  The sandwiches are so big they have to jam all the goodies in with the back of a knife to close them up.Vito's offers a number of ""spreads"" such as olive, pesto about a dozen others to put on your sandwich.  They also have panini's, a large number of varying salads and some rotating daily options.  I got the bean salad this past weekend and it was pretty darn tasty.  They also offer a number of hot option including aroncini and empanadas which I believe are made fresh on a daily basis. Vito's also has a decent looking selection of frozen pasta's made at the store and dry goods but I haven't tried either.Again, this is one of my favorite options for lunch on the weekends, check it out!",Vito’s Italian Deli,4.5 star rating,$,Delis

Then he and the cashier both told me that I can't call the order in.  I explained to them that the website says ""Calling in is recommended"" and the happy hour should apply as long as I walk-in before 5pm.  They still insisted that I pay $18.  At this point, it's become really embarrassing.  There is a line forming behind me and people are just staring and listening into our conversation.  I told those two to cancel my phone order and I'll replace the order as a walk-in and I stated my ""new"" order.  They said I couldn't do that either since the subs had already been made.  I told them I no longer wanted the subs and as I turned around to walk out, the cashier said that she would give me the deal.I'm in disbelief.  All I did was follow the directions on their website (which btw, they don't even have a mobile site), but it felt like a trick.  When I arrived, they just hassled me to make me pay full price, all the while embarrassing me in front of all the customers for a measly $7.  I love the food at this place, but I can't say that I'll be returning anytime soon.  I'm so turned off by the whole incident.I think you'd agree with me that this is not how a business should run.  You shouldn't make customers feel small or stupid...or embarrass them in front of other customers.   In a recession, you should be fighting for your customers' loyalty, not turning them away.  I also emailed Vito's and hopefully it went to someone higher-up...and not deleted by the deli guy.",Vito’s Italian Deli,4.5 star rating,$,Delis

191,jS4BO5hsQp0DGTNmnjOjqw,Tiffany M.,1.0 star rating,"STAY AWAY - DO NOT COME HERE!I purchased a $5 for $10 coupon through LivingSocial for Vitos. Right before it expired last week, I went to visit Vitos to use it but they were closed all week long for vacation. They were opening the deli back after the coupon expired (suspicious, right?). Thinking that they'd honor the coupon the following week since they closed their establishment for a full week without warning. Well that was not the case. They only would honor the $5 I paid for the coupon. This was not only disappointing since I go to Vitos all the time without a coupon but this not my fault as I couldn't use the coupon before it expired since they closed the deli!!! They should have honored my coupon - instead of throwing a fuss, I just used the stupid $5 I put in plus a little more (b/c i just wanted to get a sandwich and get out). I will never come here again and spend a penny here. I will tell all my friends, family, coworkers and anyone else that will listen in Hoboken, Jersey City, and New York City to NEVER come here. Instead I recommend going to Fiores on Adams st, M&P Biancamano on Washington, or even Tony Bolognas on First - they have better sandwiches anyway. How dare they pull a fast one on their customers like that. They have absolutely no respect for their customers. Yes, I used a livingsocial coupon, but they also forget customers like me come to Vitos many times without one. Way to retain your customers Vitos.

This place makes the sandwich perfectly.  They actually understand to not cut the bread all the way through, so when you eat it doesn't spill out the sides.  There isn't anything overly creative here but the ingredients are first rate and the execution is perfect of how a sandwich is made.Otherwise what can I say?  First rate mutz, prompt service, and delicious food.  My recommendations are this:The Vito, which is their Italian combo basically is legit top to bottom.  The fact that they default to mozz in the sandwich shows you they know whats up.  If I go to a deli in NYC they put thick sliced American cheese in a sub...gross.  This place drizzles it with oil and vinegar and also uses lettuce that went through the meat slicer so its all stringy and crunchy.  I always hate eating a sandwich and the entire lettuce piece falls out.  You can eat this while driving and texting and somehow not get messy.My custom, you can steal itChicken cutlet sandwich with provolone, balsamic glaze, bruschetta and lettuce.  Unreal, and their meat is tender and perfect.  Why cant my cutlets taste like that?!their Muzz and roast beef is good but Fiores is better, no hate, but Fiores is some freak invention of food that I can't explain unless you eat it.  I think the mozz is just milker and the meat more tender..BUT the Vito's roast beef still trumps 99% of other establishments Ive been to in the area.  So that's a nice way of saying 2nd best.",Vito’s Italian Deli,4.5 star rating,$,Delis

To those of simple-minded palates that give out 5 star ratings like charity, Vito's is an Italian deli that is actually worthy of a 5 star rating. I have found the perfect sandwich, and it's in Hoboken.Jersey is pretty well known for having good subs but I had no idea I would ever find a place to rival NY. I went with a pretty standard italian sandwich and ordered one of their signature sandwiches, the Prosciutto de Parma. Every single ingredient used was flawless, right down to the bread. This place is known for it's ""mutz."" That's what they call their fresh mozzarella here in Hoboken. Ever had mozzarella at a fancy italian restaurant? Well the mutz they use here is ten times better and they only charge you about $8.50 for a huge sandwich. You have to get a sandwich with mutz, trust me. They weren't any slouches on the amount of meat added, either. Of course, that was top quality as well. They also didn't overdo it with the oil or vinegar like a lot of places do. This is an establishment where you probably won't go wrong with whatever you order. When you come here, you come to the Holy Grail of sandwich shops. Part of me is torn as I write this because I live in NYC but I have to give credit where credits is due. I'm not one of these people that has to hype up a place just because they live in the immediate vicinity of it. That's for rookies. I keep it real. There's great food all around.

The ""Vito Hero"" is a must try for any new customer, a classic Italian hero, with Vito's signature homemade mozzarella (""mutz!"") and on a classic Hoboken fresh roll. Only downside is that Vito's can get VERY busy on the weekends, and there can be lines out of the door during the lunch rush on Saturdays or Sundays.

236,Imz3HXxCreL_SdwwkHbjsQ,Young C.,5.0 star rating,"Love this place.  It's quite small and crowded as you stand in line and order at the counter.  They make everything to order and have quite a few specialty sandwiches as well.  I ordered a Parma Prosciutto and a Hoboken sandwich.  It was so good and not dry at all.  The olive spread was delicious.  They make their own mozzarella there and call it mutz and it's a MUST have.  The bread was on a long french bread-like roll.  Quantity is great and the price is awesome, but the sandwich itself is amazing.",Vito’s Italian Deli,4.5 star rating,$,Delis
237,ibgf9x-oK-YL7emeIFxQTQ,Trey R.,4.0 star rating,"Definitely worth a try if you ever wind up in hoboken.  My favorite is the hot roast beef and mozzarella, or for a cold sandwich, the soprano.  They will deliver a large order to jersey city (but call it in early) for all of you business folks wanting lunch, that's how I discovered them.",Vito’s Italian Deli,4.5 star rating,$,Delis
238,vanWwCHyRcGrCuLZXgdlBQ,Dan M.,5.0 star rating,"A BANGIN' deli!   Seriously, tried numerous sandwiches and all are bomb.  Homemade muzz is phenom and the bread is a great compliment to the sandwich.  Quality cold cuts used.  Sides are quality as well and the prices are reasonable.  For some reason there seems to be more quality Italian delis in Boken compared to parts of NYC but hey, if I'm in the area, it's either here or Biancamano for me!",Vito’s Italian Deli,4.5 star rating,$,Delis

240,w1UiJKKeLxDY2sudj8-1og,Daniel D.,3.0 star rating,"I am so done with this place.  Not only has their sandwich gotten smaller and more expensive, but today, they sent sandwiches with no mutz.  How do you charge 8.95 for a little sandwich and forget the one thing you are allegedly famous for?  Time after time my orders have been screwed up, and they never make it right.  I am off Vitos, there are so many other Italian delis in the area that are more reliable.  The food is good, but way overpriced, and getting smaller.",Vito’s Italian Deli,4.5 star rating,$,Delis
241,x7UOznHzwLXy2Y36lzz3Tg,Tom P.,4.0 star rating,VERY good deli but you cannot compare this place with Fiore's Deli on Adams Street. Walk or drive the extra few blocks off Washington Street and go to Fiore's - one of the best sandwiches in all of NJ.,Vito’s Italian Deli,4.5 star rating,$,Delis
242,nLWrsZ_VgH5zdb_m8my7uw,Melanie C.,5.0 star rating,"It is easy for me to give Vito's 5 stars.  This is by far my favorite Italian deli in Hoboken.  I usually get the same thing: turkey, pepperoni, mutz with the works.  It has the perfect amount of everything.  The Italian bread is amazing.  The mutz is delicious and I think it trumps Fiore's.  I know, I know...most people don't agree with me.  I just like it better.  I have not had the hot roast beef and mutz in order to compare that with Fiore's, but friends of mine think Fiore's beat Vito's on that sammie.  But for a regular sub, Vito's it is!",Vito’s Italian Deli,4.5 star rating,$,Delis
243,qwZ5l6qTzUm1Z9YaayWNYg,Ed A.,5.0 star rating,"Great sandwiches... possibly the best in Hoboken. If you go on a Sat morning, expect there to be a line - but it's worth the wait. Just about anything I've gotten there is simply great. Make sure to try their different spreads on the sandwiches.

The mozzarella has to be made there, but I expected more- felt like I got if from a supermarket and it was too mushy.  it was so expensive too. They charge by the pound or something like that. The Italian sub was good, not too bad, but again, it was too expensive. I would only order a sandwich from them again, but will skip the appetizer.",Vito’s Italian Deli,4.5 star rating,$,Delis

This place is really amazing, homemade ""mutz"" (fresh mozzarella the real way it should be made), quality deli meat, bread, and italian grocery. I have a slice and bennys before going out, and then a sandwhich from Vitos the day after. It always works well.... the only thing that doesn't is the line. All good things come to those who wait, especially behind a yenta with a huge bedazzled bag that hits you in the nuts everytime the line moves.

The vito's with sweet peppers is my fav.  Try the different spreads well worth every bite.  Oh one last thing I tend to get a salad with my lunch.  The pasta salad and the marinated mushrooms are great.  If there is a line don't worry it's worth the wait.,Vito’s Italian Deli,4.5 star rating,$,Delis
