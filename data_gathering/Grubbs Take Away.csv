0,tCjYkKd3jxm5-QoGqJuQgQ,Kelly R.,4.0 star rating,"Compared to some of the negative reviews I've had a really good experience with Grubbs! This is such a great addition to Hoboken. I would say Grubbs sits somewhere in between Johnny Rockets and Bareburger in quality/taste/overall food.Pros:-The Oreo Shake. MY GOD! This is crack. Best Oreo shake I've ever had. Probably like a 10000 calorie shake and that's why it's so good, but it is WORTH IT. -Delivery is FAST. Food always arrives hot!-The seasoned fries are awesome. They are like super fried so they are great crunchy indulgence but don't wait to eat them that all goes away when they cool down and then they are kinda gross.-Burgers are good nothing mind blowing but good for when you just want a regular burger.-I've never had a delivery order wrong once.Cons: -The burgers can be a mess when you open the wrapping they are in. I've had to put them back together basically every time.-Secondly with burgers, I've had a couple times where they wet over cooked to the point of completely dried out. Now I prefer this to Bareburgers raw burgers, but still not that great.",Grubbs Take Away,4.0 star rating,$,"American, (Traditional)"

The staff was arguing in the background the entire time. The burger itself took longer than I would have thought given I was the only customer. The burger itself was fairly mediocre, though I wouldn't call it a bad burger.

2,tt1vLgAP5UpRXAKJLT2KWg,Alec K.,2.0 star rating,"Came here the week after they opened and decided to give it some time before posting my review, but subsequent comments from friends who have encountered the same issues I had confirmed my initial impression. I went here expecting to find a well priced, high quality, and filling burger. Upon entry we found that a double cheese burger costs over $12 (with tax). I ordered it, thinking it must be a pretty great burger to charge that much more then any other burger place would, but I was certainly mistaken. When we tried to order, it took the employees close to 10 minutes to figure out how to work the POS system. When the order finally went through, we saw the cooks peeling our small burger patties off of a sheet and tossing them lazily onto the grill. More confusion occurred when they tried to construct and bag our burgers, and by the time we received our orders over 30 minutes had passed since we had ordered, even though our party of two were the only patrons. While we waited, there was no where to sit down, since the place was meant for ""Take-Away"" and since there was inadequate ventilation in the restaurant it felt like it was well over 80° the whole time. For the insane prices they charge, I'd expect these to be large, organic, hand made, tasty burgers, but I was very disappointed at the overall quality and taste of the final product. The patties were tiny and tasted completely plain. I left hungry having spent over $12 dollars, for which I could have bought two tremendous burgers at a Shake Shack. After this poor experience I certainly would not visit Grubbs again, and many of my friends have told me that their visits there have been equally unpleasant.",Grubbs Take Away,4.0 star rating,$,"American, (Traditional)"

4,iyvp_61aUwxS8vQoX4RCVA,Brooke M.,3.0 star rating,"I ordered Grubbs Take Away for the first time tonight off off of Seamless. I was really excited to have this for dinner because I saw a lot of great reviews on yelp. I was prepping to leave Jersey City and head back to Philadelphia and was not in the mood to make dinner. We ordered our dinner at 6-6:15 pm and the app said that we would get our food delivered between 7:10-7:20. We normally get a message from Seamless when the food is on its way. When 7:25 hit and we had not received that message, I checked the app and saw that it said our food had been delivered at 7:11 PM. I called Grubbs and the man who answered was very courteous and apologetic. He let me know that their app was messed up and whenever the food is leaving the restaurant it comes up as delivered on the recipient's phone. They told me that our food would be there within 10 minutes and it had been delayed because they received a rush of orders after ours. The food finally made it at 8 pm and while it was good food (fries were crispy-just how I like them!) it was disappointing because I was hoping to have left by then. The whole point of ordering from here was that it was supposed to be a simple and decently quick meal but that isn't what it turned out to be. While I appreciate the restaurant being nice when I called, I wish they had just been honest and told me the food was going to take longer than expected, not give me false hope that it was around the corner. Side note- if you order a sandwich, you do not get chips or fries with it like you would at most restaurants. You have to order fries on their own!",Grubbs Take Away,4.0 star rating,$,"American, (Traditional)"

Ok so were you going to call me to let me know or just wait until I starved?????? Meanwhile I'm running late for an out of town errand and I've waited close to TWO HOURS!!!!! And now it's too late to get something else somewhere else so imagine my level of frustration when all they had to do was call and let me know.
