We have tasted quite a few items here .. Mouth melting Puris with perfectly spiced aloo bhaji, the real mumbai street side Samosa pav, the chandni chowk style tangy pani puris, the best kathi rolls in NYC (especially the Chicken tikka and Paneer shashlik flavours), allahbad style dahi puris and, to top it all, soul-satisfying masala tea. Not just the food, but be it the ambience, be it the service or be it the most friendly host, you will love this place! I definitely recommend this place to everyone.

After having stared at it from across the street sitting at Karma for so long, I decided to give this place a try. It seemed affordable and some of the reviews were a-okay. I ordered take-out (pick up) and while my order was ready upon arrival, I decided to add to my order, just in case the bf wanted a little more than the small platter I got him. First of all, let me just say, the customer service was nice. The guy behind the counter was very friendly, though it seemed his wife (maybe not his wife?) a little cold - metaphorically and quite literally as she wrapped herself in a shawl in the restaurant chair. Everyone who complained about this place not having AC, there you have it!My most relevant complaint is this: the cook behind the counter didn't wear gloves when he assembled another customer's kati roll. Yes, he sprinkled red onions on top and rolled it up with his bare hands. Why! I went home and ate my food, but not without zapping it in the microwave first and then praying like hell I don't get sick.Now on to the food. I ordered the tandoori ($8) chicken platter for myself and the chicken tikka masala platter ($8) for the bf, and requested for both to be spicy. The containers that the platters were packed in looked small but actually had a nice serving size in there. My chicken tandoori was delicious and spicy, but the bf's chicken tikka was way too mild. The platters are supposed to come with yellow rice and a side of chickpea+corn something on it. The rice we got was white and tasted like watery instant rice. The chickpea+corn was good in the sense that, when I mixed my rice all into it, it became yellow rice. Ha! The raita that came with the meal was also not that good. It was literally watery yogurt and nothing else - no seasoning, veggies, etc.Anyway, I'm kind of glad I didn't spend too much $$ here since I wasn't fully satisfied with the food.",Dilli Junction,4.0 star rating,$,Indian

I came to this place along with my 4 other friends and out of excitement we ordered almost everything from the menu. The ambience of the place was good but the food was really disappointing. I have never tasted such shitty food in my life.

We generally do not see that cuisine represented as much as Northern or Southern Indian cuisine. I literally could cry when I tasted the food. It is so authentic with a home-cooked feel! It took me back to my ancestral home with the smells and tastes of my grandma and aunt's cooking!! I tried the goat curry and the goat biryani as well as the samosa. All that I tasted was A-1! No frills required, no excess oil, nothing but genuinely well-made dishes. The service is also great and the owner sincerely cares about her customers and what kind of food she is putting out there.

Chicken was perfect, literally melted in my mouth-so much flavor. Karma, take notes! Samosas were out of this world. Nice, stuffed and fluffy! Could eat them all day!

I got a chicken tikka masala platter and an order of dahi puri. Like others have noted, their portions are more manageable (i.e. no leftovers, but you will still be satisfied). The chicken had good flavor and sufficient spice (their sauce has less cream so was more brown than some of the orange-ier ones you'll find elsewhere). I liked the corn salad and chickpeas on the side; they cut the savory and spice of the entree nicely. I haven't had anything like the dahi puri before but really liked the different textures and flavors at play (crunchy, smooth, sweet, spicy, creamy, tangy, and savory all at once). I was worried about being greedy getting a whole order for myself, but the 5-6 small puffs were a perfect starter.I was curious about their beverage selection so may try that next time.",Dilli Junction,4.0 star rating,$,Indian

The Vegetable Kabab Kati Roll, the Chicken Tikka Kabab Kati Roll and the Shami Kebab Roll are delectable to say the least.  The fact that they carry Rose Badam drink just makes me give them more props as the drink is hard to find outside of the usual Mango Lassi fare.  Highly recommended.  Outdoor seating makes the experience more enjoyable in the summertime.",Dilli Junction,4.0 star rating,$,Indian

I tried veg kebab, corn chat, gol gappa and ghugni. The kebab was melt in your mouth and was cooked to perfection. The corn chat was zingy and tasty. The gol gappas were a total let down and the paani was nothing to write home about. The ghugni was absolutely fantastic- had home style chole, onions and was neatly wrapped in a wheat chapati. Must visit for students!!",Dilli Junction,4.0 star rating,$,Indian

The owner's mom's recipes set the base for the menu and yes, it's spicy, but if you want the real deal then the spice is all part of the game! The staff are also very accommodating to special requests and very happy to explain the menu. We love the tikka masala platter and the potato roti. It comes with a sweet yoghurt dip too that works wonders to balance out the heat :)",Dilli Junction,4.0 star rating,$,Indian
