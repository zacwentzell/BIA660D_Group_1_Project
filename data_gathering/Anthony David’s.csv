I'm huge brunch fan and Anthony David's has not let me down yet...especially for being such a popular Hoboken brunch spot! I've ordered the eggs Florentine in the past as well as the goat cheese omellete. Both have been very good and I really enjoy their home fries. They aren't normal home fries, they add spices and peppers and onions which take them to a whole new level. The best perk about going here though would have to be that it's byob!

On the service, there's this: Anthony David's is a popular spot with a waiting list. Totally respect that. Here's what's egregious. Call and make a reservation and totally ready to wait. But then get a text saying the table is ready so you come in. Then you stand there for 50 minutes in the corner because they tell you it's not ready. That's unacceptable. That's how you ruin a night.On the food: it's good, not great. The ambition and ingredients are worth the price, but the taste isn't. The lobster gnocchi was a little fluffy. The stuffed squid needed more flavor, though the polenta was really good. A friend got the pork saltimbocca and said the prosciutto was better than the pork chop -- but the smell is intoxicating.

The food is made with love.  It's all presented beautifully and my favorite part is you're full before you're truly finished but you never feel gross. Even the more comfort selections are perfectly balanced, bright, and fresh.All the Hoboken locals should show off the amazing food environment in town with a stop at Anthony David's- especially when hosting guests.This place is a crowd pleaser!",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

It's about a 10-15 minute walk from the waterfront and main downtown Hoboken area.The place has a great menu with options for vegetarians too! The staff is very friendly. My favorite eggs dish is their Florentine Benedict and it's served with a side of home fries. When I'm in a more lunch mood, I usually go for the Bell and Evans Chicken Sandwich. Their food is delicious and fresh. Also, it is byob which is always a plus! A must is their amazing Nutella donuts. It's 4 bite size donuts covered in nutella.

Highly recommend if you are BYO a bottle of champagne or if you just want some fresh juice. My friends ordered the french toast and the prosciutto panini and we're satisfied with their meals. I ordered the tuna burger - rare. The flavor of the burger was good and the side salad was flavorful as well but the tuna itself was a little lackluster. Usually the tuna burgers are a steak with a hard sear and a red center. This burger seems almost chopped up and formed into a patty so it didn't taste as meaty as most tuna steaks do. Next time will order the chicken sandwich. We also got a side of truffle fries which were a bit overwhelming with truffle- would suggest a different flavor profile to the fries but they were crispy and well cooked.,Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

They have amazing choices for Eggs Benedict-- they have one that is served with bacon on French toast, which is a great sweet and savory dish. I was sure to order Gorgonzola fries as a side and they were delicious as well. There were a few downsides as well, one of which being that we ended up with a plethora of potatoes. This is because the Eggs Benedict already comes with home fries, but that is not states on the menu. The waitress probably should have offered a substitution; we ended up with enough potatoes for a family. This establishment also does not serve any alcohol, which was a shame because it would be my go-to brunch place if there were mimosa pitchers. All they would need are some bottles of Prosecco.The last thing I would address is the service. While the staff was friendly, we were greeted by a hostess standing at a podium outside in 48 degree weather. She seemed to be really cold and I'm not sure why they would keep her out there as were well into fall.Overall, this is a great place with amazing food, just be sure to bring your own bottle of champagne if you are interested in starting your day with mimosas!",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"
55,iHV_Ef7WMAu6u0XNyZgvJA,Sara M.,3.0 star rating,"Finally tried Anthony David's and I'm definitely impressed by the brunch menu and food.I ordered a prosciutto grilled cheese of sorts and it was really tasty. Perfectly crunchy bread and a generous portion of prosciutto sandwiched in between melty cheese. We split an order of nutella donuts for the table and these were also phenomenal. I mean, can you ever go wrong with an order of nutella donuts for the table? Nope. My friends both ordered different variations of eggs benedict (crab cake and chorizo with guacamole) and they had nothing but great things to say. Anthony Davids is BYOB with no corkage fee, and they will bring out orange juice so you can assemble a mimosa.So, while the food was tops and the BYOB factor is always a major plus, I'm giving AD three stars because of the so-so service. Our projected wait time of 30-45 minutes turned into over an hour. Three of us were sat at a table for two. Not the most comfy, but when you are super hungry anything will do. Our server wasn't too attentive and didn't seem to handle the Sunday brunch mob all that well. He rarely checked in on the table and we had a hard time getting a hold of him for simple things (getting water, a champagne bucket, taking old silverware, etc).Despite just average service, the food at Anthony David's is above average, and over an hour wait time for brunch is definitely an indicator of that.

The restaurant is on the nicer side of casual but doesn't require dressing up by any stretch of the imagination. We were there on a Sunday night around 7pm and it was extremely empty. I'm writing this review a couple of months after having been there, but thinking back I'm not sure if there were more than 5 other people in the whole place and they might've been staff.Regardless, I was there to eat, not to make friends, and the food was delicious.Recommended:Appetizers - Spicy Tuna Tartare ($13), Burrata ($15), Charred Octopus ($17) Pastas - Veal Meatballs ($26), Wild Boar Ragu ($32), Lobster Risotto ($32)Entrees - Rohan Duck Breast ($34), Grass-Fed Ribeye ($37)Desserts - Fried Bananas ($10)The waiters were great and extremely attentive.

83,3yS2yP4oAoboTG3HMBxTzg,Stephanie L.,3.0 star rating,"I went to Anthony David's for Sunday brunch with a group of girlfriends and consider it overall average.Food was good and portions were decent.  I enjoyed the kale Caesar salad and sunny side up egg on toast, though the egg was a tad under done (runny egg whites on the ""up"" side).  We also shared an order of donuts - 4 to an order, and we chose half Nutella and half bourbon glaze.  They're more like munchkins or zeppoles than a traditional donut.  The Nutella tasted more like a plain chocolate sauce without hazelnut though was still good.  The bourbon glaze was very sweet, but is more of a dip on the plate allowing you to govern sugar intake.Decor and ambiance can help make an experience.  The back private party room is used for general dining and lacks in both.  One long L shaped community table in a bare walled room - though plenty of natural light.  The few fruit flies antagonizing us all created a moment for a table wide toast when we swatted one down.Service was not entirely friendly or prompt.  When two coffees were served with one milk pitcher we needed a second.  We got it after our second request once the other table in the room was served twice.  The servers didn't want us to pull our table at the bottom of the L back a few inches since they needed the space to serve from both sides (really just 3 inches - we were still able to get up and walk).  It was better for them to have two patrons from different parties butted up to each other.  We moved, and ironically they passed plates over my friends' heads anyway.  Grumps.If you go, make sure you have a smaller group and sit in the front room.  Expect service to be busy and possibly a bit curt.  BYO and good food are pluses.",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

There is a nice little bench to sit on outside, though.The staff is friendly and welcoming. The interior is very home-y and simple. I was told that the restaurant was originally one place of business that became two. The way it was connected allowed it to have two separate ""rooms"". This was convenient because if you get to sit in the communal table, it's more quiet and somewhat private. Though, with it being a communal table, your privacy is somewhat limited. But it is quieter in that room.Onto the food. I ordered a Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict and Hot Chocolate and shared a French Toast Petite. My boyfriend ordered the Lobster Eggs Benedict and both of our main entree dishes were very good. Eggs were poached well, the salmon was almost melting in my mouth, and it all went well together.

One caveat: I love a good rib-eye, but I do have to say Anthony David's rib eye is not the best you can ever get, so try to opt for something else.  As other posters have commented, it is a thinner cut of steak than you'd expect which means the marbling just isn't there.Otherwise everything else is awesome!  Brunch is solid and they offer juices to pair with your champagne.  Duck is always fabulous and cooked very well . The cherry demi is a perfect compliment to the duck meat too.  Lamb chops when they are offered are soft and succulent and are not gamey at all.  The pecorino potatoes are amazing - perfectly crisp on the outside (kind of French fry like) with lots of flavor.  Ice box cake is always a welcome addition to the end of any meal.  Sometimes too welcome that I come just to get ice box cake for take out.",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

The French toast was different but good, lacked egg batter and had coconut all over it, and didn't have any nutmeg flavor although that was listed on the menu, but it was decent enough. 2. Outdoor seating is nice but tables of 2 get sat right next to each other like NYC, so get cozy.3. Service was average, no check in after serving food but nothing horrible about it. Our waitress did take the donuts off the check since we didn't eat or like them, which was nice of her. Cons:1. Nutella donuts were not good and we love Nutella, so we blame the donuts, which were dry and tasteless. Munchkins from D&D dipped in Nutella would be better, and they charge $9 for a small plate. Not worth it.2. Water served with no ice on a hot day in the summer/fall, serve ice please, I shouldn't have to ask for cold water.3.

Anthony David's should either expand or get a bigger space so that the wait will be less and that it won't feel so cramped in the winter time.

Overall, it was a great experience.We arrived at 5 PM and were seated immediately by the window, and not long after our waitress arrived with menus and explained the specials. Both of us ordered lemonade and decided to start with a cheese plate. 4 cheeses for $20 isn't too steep of a price, however- the cheese did not come with anything except for a few slices of bread. I wish they also provided honey or other accoutrements like nuts, compotes, etc.. The cheese was still delicious though!I went with the 3 pork cavatelli pasta for my main course, and my friend ordered one of the specials - a rock shrimp risotto with peppers and zucchini. Both of our entrees were outstanding, especially the cavatelli. The sauce was meaty and packed with flavor yet didn't overshadow the fresh, light cavatelli noodles. Prices were high for the portion size, but the quality was there for sure. When it came time to get the bill, my friend and I split the total. Unfortunately, our waitress must have swiped my card for the full amount as well as the split amount, yet did not inform me of the mistake.

But then, an hour goes by...and finally after waiting an hour and 15 minutes we were seated.  My problem wasn't the long wait.  My problem was with the poor estimate we were given because it was clearly way off.  Had we known the wait would have been that long, we could have gone to get coffee or made other arrangements.  That part really turned me off.After finally getting seated and now thoroughly starving, our server came over and offered us either fresh squeezed OJ or Tropicana for our mimosas.  I liked that they gave you the option.  We also knew what we wanted to eat since we had an hour 15 to study the menu so immediately put our orders in.  I got the crabcakes benedict, which was very good.  The potatoes were just ok, and they bordered on mushy, which was eh.  Portion sizes were good which was another plus.  The food came out very fast.  Also good considering we were starving.  Everyone really enjoyed their meal and the truffle fries that we all shared were particularly amazing.  With actual truffles on them not just oil.  Nearly died.  Service was average.  Nothing great but nothing awful.  Overall, the horrendous estimate of our wait time ended up being balanced out by good portion sizes and overall good quality food.  I would go back here and give it another shot but definitely would go a little earlier and hope that the estimated wait time is more in the realm of reality.",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

NO we were not and this became annoying.-this takes the cake:  our wine bottle was still 1/4th full and my friend and I were chatting, the co waitress come to our table picks up our wine bottle and says are you finished? I was appalled. No we weren't finished so why were you taking away my wine bottle!!  (I got the point we were being pushed out)-last note was server comped the petite French toast but then charged for two coffees we never ordered.

For the several times I've eaten brunch here I've really never had decent service. Every time I've had to specifically ask for things that servers should just know to bring. Example - when a guest is sitting outside and it starts to rain and you have open tables inside, you should probably ask if they'd like to move.

But since I am convinced that Anthony David's is also a secret training ground for male models, I will just make my peace here on Yelp.  I've only been once for brunch and once for dinner but on both occasions, my dining partner and I were served with delicious dishes and some seriously unwarranted attitude. It wasn't necessarily rudeness nor isolated to our table, so we weren't offended. Rather, it was a spit-your-drink-out comical kind of aloofness that made us feel like we needed to impress them. On both occasions, when our servers would reluctantly address us, neither made eye contact with us, but I suspect not out of shyness. Instead each pretty face looked away to the side as if pondering the next move he will make in a game of chess where he is playing it very cool and collected for his opponent. Too cool for me apparently.  Yes, the food is excellent, but I attribute that almost entirely to the dedicated immigrant staff preparing the dishes in the open kitchen.  And yes, it's quite expensive, but I'm glad it's in my neck of the woods and will likely go back when I'm in the mood to empty out my wallet for some quality deliciousness served to me by someone channeling Matthew McConaughey doing an impression of himself playing a snobby waiter at a trendy LA restaurant.",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

It was a beautiful morning outside - they have a great outdoor space but we decided to sit inside. It's a very quaint restaurant inside, the ambiance is very casual and staff is very amicable. As I mentioned we were seated quickly and ordered a couple coffees ($3, good coffee that come in huge mugs, although we didn't get refills (not sure if they do that or we just drank them slow through out our meal). I ordered the french toast bacon benedict and my boyfriend had two eggs any style. My dish was relatively good, a nice sweet and salty breakfast. I was sort of surprised to see coconut shreds on my french toast, it was an interesting flavor, which was covered in crispy bacon and poached eggs. Only one of my eggs was poached, and it wasn't seasoned, which I wish there was, but not a deal breaker. It comes with a side of home potatoes which were delicious! I noticed as we walked out that they had a pile of already made french toast in their baked goods case, which I thought was interesting because I figured the meals was made-to-order? Or those could have been french toast to-go, who knows, I'll ask next time.

Her assistant pointed out that we were first, she didn't acknowledge us, then walked another couple to their table, they refused to sit on that table and returned to the front door. Then she told us ""you can take that table, they refused to take it"" we walked ourselves to the table she pointed at and we can see why they refused, the floor was filthy, there was lots of egg yolk on the floor. Instead of cleaning the floor, she figured she'll offer the table to a different couple.  We declined the table too, and asked to sit outside. We waited for about 10 minutes and got a table outside.  Overall, the service was slow and I heard the table next to me and the one behind me complain about the slow service. They took a long time to take our order, then brought us a different table order. We asked for sugar multiple times and by the time they got it, the coffee was cold. The table next to me asked for the check multiple times. I honestly understand it was Sunday brunch, and it was busy and they were probably overworked, hence the bad management.

We were able to bring in champagne and peach schnapps, then just order a carafe of OJ to make our own brunch cocktails. The menu is great for brunch, with a surprising number of ""X Benedict"" options. Which brings me to what another reviewer said:Lobster Roll F*%$ing Benedict is incredible. Buttery and savory, at least 3 gym trips of goodness but so damn worth it. These came with home fries that had a lot more flavor than is typical from what I've seen. All in all great. The truffle fries were excellent as well.Looking forward to checking this place out in the spring for dinner.",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

We've lived on the west coast for the last two years and I decided to bring my (now) fiancee here since it was always one of our favorite places when we lived in Hoboken. They don't take reservations on weekends, but understood my situation and the fact that I was planning to surprise my girlfriend with ""the question"". I was on a tight timeline since we had about 30 people planning to meet us at a nearby bar as an additional surprise. They got us seated right away, the service and food were excellent as always, and they took a ton of pressure off of the night by helping to keep us on track. I think AD's is probably our favorite place to eat in Hoboken, especially because it's a BYOB.

Great location (for me :)); kind of tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Wash; has just the right amount of shade from the sun to give it whimsical lighting for dining al fresco during the warmer months. They have done some remodeling to make this place chic and hip. However, other than the new look and a few new things on the menu, not much has changed. The service is kind of a hit and miss. I say this because the last time I went there with my fam (my hubs and 20 month-old), the waitress was uber confusing! After a reasonable enough of waiting during brunch time central, she told us that she was ready to seat us. The previous patrons got up from the table and she and another staff started clearing the table. When we were about to sit, she tells us to move to the other side of the restaurant! For what? I do NOT know?! Our waitress was fine. That happened a few weeks ago. This is a typical kind of okay/somewhat annoying experience so I will get annoyed and not come back for a while.

I also had the brownie dessert and it was bad (my friends also said the brownie was very bad this visit); it tasted as if it had been sitting around uncovered for days.  Additionally, service was incredibly slow...our server disappeared for very prolonged periods of time the entire night.  So, again, I get the appeal of BYOB, but maybe it's better taken advantage of for brunch, as the pasta prices are way too much for what you're eating.

I split a side of fries with my friend and they did not disappoint. And the fries come with a sauce if your choice. (Who doesn't love magical sauce for your dipping pleasure?!) I typically don't like bleu or gorgonzola cheese but their gorgonzola sauce is addictive! Their chipotle sauce was yummy too. The french toast is a good choice as well. While waiting for our table, we were salivating at the baked goods on display at the counter. I'm generally more of a savory rather than sweet person so I typically don't have room for it but next time I'm gonna have to get a pastry to go. They recently renovated/expanded the place which is fantastic bc it is a brunch hot spot and the more seating the better!

193,kw_unRenFD-ModrsLLL2_g,Victoria C.,4.0 star rating,"Food: A-The food here was great - we started with the Grilled Asparagus, ordered the Seared Scallops and the Lobster Risotto for our entrees, and finished with the Icebox Cake for dessert. The asparagus came with some prosciutto and an egg, and it was good - quite a small portion though. My seared scallops were delicious - it came with shiitake mushrooms, creamed corn, and pancetta. Super tasty, not too heavy, but still filled me up comfortably. My boyfriend enjoyed his lobster risotto - I tasted it as well and it had a comfort food kind of taste. I would recommend my scallops if you like more different kinds of flavors in your meal (the scallops vs. the corn, etc.), whereas the risotto was more just one overall taste. The icebox cake was AMAZING. It was served cold, and it seems like a kind of mod-podge of different textures and tastes, but it's actually just made from chocolate pudding and graham crackers. It's nice and chocolatey, but not too much so - broken up by the graham cracker taste. Even though it's made from chocolate pudding, it doesn't have a pudding texture - it's frozen, so it has more of a gelato sort of texture. YUM.Service: C+The service was just alright. We had to wait a while to be seated since they don't take reservations. You also can't put your name down on the list to be seated until your whole party is there. The hosts could have been a little more organized I think - it just didn't seem like they totally knew what they were doing. We did like our waitress when we were finally seated. Later in our meal, though, I went to the hostess and asked her to make sure that for our dessert, we get a candle in it as it was my boyfriend's birthday. She assured me, but it didn't happen... Sort of disappointing (at least for me). There must have been some lack of communication there... or some forgetfulness. But we still tipped well since our waitress was good.Ambiance: B-Cute and mature looking place, busy but still gave a moderately intimate vibe. A bit more upscale, but not tooo fancy (business/dressy casual is fine). Good for a date night. Could be slightly intimate for a casual catch up with friends, but it really depends how close you are and how fancy you normally like to roll.Kind of tight space-wise. We were at a two-seat table against the wall across from the bar, and there were wait staff and customers bustling by our table through the night. There was also very little space to move around. I couldn't scoot my chair back at all for a little more leg space, as another girl at the next table was righttt behind me. The tables were squished in pretty tight. I also couldn't really find a place for my bag except right by my legs in the very little leg room that I had. Overall, I'd come back here for a nice occasion. It gets packed really fast though, and since they don't take reservations, I'd come here for an earlier dinner so you don't have to wait in their non-existent waiting area (you stand by the door and get in the way of all the wait staff).",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

The wife ordered the Eggs Benedict on potato pancakes, and proclaimed them to be the best she's ever had! We also got the gorgonzola cheese fries to share amongst the table, which were insanely good!My order, and the reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars, was the Salmon burger. We had just came back from our honeymoon in Hawaii, and was on a serious fish kick. Thus, I had to have a salmon burger, however, I don't really order something like this often. The waitress asked me how I wanted it cooked, and when I didn't know, she asked how do you get a normal burger cooked? My answer to this was medium, and thus that is how I got my salmon burger cooked. Definitely a mistake, but not her or the restaurant's fault. The burger overall was pretty good, good flavors and a great bun, but I couldn't help feeling like the fish was to raw for my tastes. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of sushi, but the raw fish thing didn't really go right on a burger for me. I should have just said cooked well and probably would have enjoyed it much more!In summary, this place is great, and I would definitely come back, but I would either A) order my salmon burger well done or B) order eggs benedict.

The set up of this restaurant is a little odd, when you walk in you think you are going in the wrong entrance because you are facing the kitchen.  The open kitchen concept makes the restaurant smell amazing though, definitely made my taste buds tingle!  We were seated closer to Bloomfield which I was thankful for (I called ahead to make a reservation, not sure if that made any difference).  The 2 rooms closer to Washington are a little crowded and next to the bathroom.  The bread was accompanied with a bean dip which was different from the normal butter or oil.  Very tasty, not overly salty.  We started with the 3 bruschetta which were delicious and a nice break from the usual tomato and basil.I got the 3 pork gravy pasta dish which was explained to me to be a thick meat like sauce made with pork rather than the traditional beef.  The pasta sauce was watery and the sauce was pretty salty but the pasta itself was very satisfying, perhaps the best pasta I've had.  Perfectly al dente and you could definitely tell it was home made.  The scoop of ricotta was delicate and light, a very nice contrast to the sauce.We opted for the chocolate budino for dessert which was like a chocolate mousse in a cup.  Pretty average, nothing special.I recommend this place for a date night or special occasion however it is definitely on the pricey side.  Seasonal menu is a plus and I do like the restaurant's non-traditional takes on traditional Italian dishes. I I don't think I would ever find penne vodka on the menu, and I like that.  3 stars for food (might have been 4 if I had something else) and 5 stars for atmosphere!",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

While the eggs were perfectly poached, the egg muffin tasted really cheap (it was literally an english muffin, not even a scone or anything). It was also overly toasted (a little burned on the edges).  And what was UP with the non delicious home fries?  I didn't get home fries- I got mushy, roasted potatoes that had no flavor- no salt, no pepper, no rosemary...  I also barely tasted any truffle butter. The ricotta definitely came through though. My bf had the southwestern omelette, which did look fluffy and good. I only had a bit- it had ham, cheddar, and avocado in it.  A traditional type of omelette that I think ended up being better than my dish. Also came with the blegh potatoes and measley sour dough bread (which was actually good and sour, though). So so disappointing food and service and PRICE wise.  Perhaps the lunch items are better- I was going to go for the meat and cheese baguettes, but I had such a disappointing experience that I wouldn't come back.  Maaaaybe for dinner because well, maybe they had an off night.",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

Entrees: Black sea bass - you can never go wrong with this dish. Seared scallops - came with a delicious cream corn.Pork chop special of the day. Everything was made really well.

Another friend ordered pasta with ragu which was not traditional ragu sause, but taste was ok. The second time I ordered burger which was just horrible and meat quality was just like it had been a month before they got it from a freezer. But french fries was really perfect fried and crunchy. My son had salmon benedict which tasted good. The portion was big for him so I finished a half of his benedict and next day we could not stand up because of stomach troubles. I can assume it was salmon benedict because he did not try my ""one month in the freezer"" burger. Several times I stopped by for an espresso, which was much better two years ago and now it has a taste of burned paper. I gave two stars only for an opportunity to bring an own alcohol and that's it.

It was served with artichoke which tasted like they were in a very thin batter and fried (clever idea) and wedged potatoes.  I want to try the entire menu but it will be hard to pass these items up next time around.  Boyfriend really enjoyed his meal as well.  Lobster bisque soup, pork shank (I know that was good because I saw how the meat was falling off the bone!), and a chocolate mousse dessert.Customer service is beyond exceptional.  Had a reservation for 6:30pm on a Monday night, but was delayed looking for parking.  Didn't think to call because I just assumed it wouldn't be crowded.  By the time it hit 6:45 the restaurant called me to see if I was still coming.  A restaurant has only called to confirm my reservation the day before, but never if I'm running late.  Kudos to them because I was so worried about parking, couldn't be bothered with dialing them!  Thank you Anthony David.  Our waiter Chris was great.  Knew the menu well and was honest when inquiring about the stand out items.  As soon as I walked into the place I fell in love with the ambiance.  It was so warm and cozy, it felt like there was a fireplace going, but I didn't see one.  I love the counter and the stools.  It felt very old school, not like sitting at a bar.  Lastly the place is BYO!  Can't beat that!I will be back to try brunch!  Looking forward to it.",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

The person who was with me was always getting bumped into by other customers and waitresses passing by as well, so they should find some other arrangement for this entry area.I ordered a salmon eggs benedict dish which would have been ok if the eggs were cooked a little more; the white was still too runny and I've had better at other restaurants.Before this visit, I had very high expectations from friends that have been here before, so I'm hoping to give this place another try and hopefully have a better experience!",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

Hard to screw that up. For appetizer, we shared some pork belly special thing. It wasn't quite what I expected. Typically with pork belly, I expect it to be really fatty but the way it was prepared, it was on the dry side. We shared the ribeye entree which was excellent, especially the potatoes. And for dessert, we got an ice box cake which was also great. Love that it's BYOB. We had a really nice meal for two for under $100. Can't beat that.

DOZENS and DOZENS of fruit flies line the wall across from the barista bar.  My better half actually pointed it out to me as we were leaving.  I don't know if maybe they don't notice or just don't care but it is really really bad and a really easy fix.  It makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like and what creepy crawlers lurk back there.  I'd love to come back but only when the infestation has died down.,Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

Anthony David's is BYOB which is definitely the best part about this location. The fresh squeezed orange juice is delicious and the perfect mixer for mimosas so bring a bottle of champagne. The host was friendly but the rest of the staff seemed like they were irritated and didn't want to help get things that we needed like a side of ketchup. We started with an order of the doughnuts: half Nutella, half bourbon glaze. They weren't very good at all and I definitely would not recommend them. They tasted like fried dough from a carnival: heavy, dense, and greasy. Then we both had the mushroom omelette. The goat cheese was fresh and tasty but my omelette hardly had any vegetables in it.

253,3RC4rRMLgY669VKUGp5i0g,Tiffany L.,3.0 star rating,"Came to The Dining Room on a Sunday night to celebrate my mother-in-laws' birthday. Our reservation was for 8pm and the restaurant was fairly empty despite a few people sitting outside. The ambiance is very, very charming -- we were seated in the room to the left, and being the only people in the room all night made us feel like we had our own little private party! We had a party of 7 and were seated comfortably at a long table, half cushioned booth half chairs.I love that this place is BYOB. That is absolutely fantastic. We bought a few bottles of wine, champagne and beer. They bought out the appropriate glassware (flutes for champagne, wine glasses), and kept whatever we weren't drinking at the time chilled. The hummus (made with white beans, olive oil and fresh herbs), was fantastic, as was the warm, crusty bread. They brought us out more bread when we asked without a problem (my husband and I arrived 7 minutes later than the rest and everyone ate all the bread!)This is a very nice place to celebrate or have a romantic evening. Even though it does feel ""special"" and upscale, it still remains low-key and quaint. Everyone was worried about the dress code because some of the men had only brought shorts, but they don't have a dress code. As someone pointed out, ""the hostess is wearing flip-flops, so I think we're okay.""The reason for the 3 stars is because the food had some faults, and the price tag was much heavier than it should have been. The service was okay, but not spectacular, and lacked in friendliness. If the service was better, I would have forgiven them for the less-than-perfect food, or vice versa. While we enjoyed the experience as a whole, it isn't 4-star worthy -- although with the price, it should have been 5-star.The Asparagus appetizer is very good. Perfectly grilled, with a sunny-side egg, toasted bread and deliciously salty proscuitto, but what really makes this dish is the shaved truffles. All of the tables' dishes came from the Entree section, although I feel I would have done better getting a pasta dish. I had the Scallops. While the scallops were delicious and perfectly cooked, there were only 4. This dish was $32. The tarragon-lime butter was delicious and a nice addition. The only side-dish to the scallops was a corn-cake that was over-cooked and burnt on the bottom. Four out of 7 people at the table got this dish, and we all agreed 4 scallops were not generous for the price, and the side-dish was not good -- and burnt. Other entrees to the table were the Duck, Steak and Pork Chop. I thought the Pork Chop was delicious, nicely cooked and worth the price. I did not try the steak because my brother-in-law did not share (haha). The Duck was also very good. We got quite a few desserts, as well as coffee. Cappuccino was very good. My dessert was the Bourbon Donuts. These were donut holes and they were so-so. Definitely not a moist or soft donut, although the bourbon glaze was very good. I love homemade donuts but these did not impress. The Tiramisu was very heavy on cream with barely any lady-fingers. Most got the Brownie, which was rich and chocolately - although I didn't care for the Pistachio Gelato (very artificial, obviously made with an extract for flavoring).I most likely wouldn't return, or if I did, would try more of the Antipastos' or pasta selections, as I feel the entrees are not worth the money. The ambiance and the fact it is BYOB still merits it as 3-stars, and is still worth trying once.",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

Husband had the western omelette which was fluffy and well-made. He really enjoyed the crunch and slight spice to the potatoes on the side.

We went for a nice date night dinner we made reservations for 7:30 but it was like a Tuesday night so it wasn't packed and we went right in. We ordered the meatball app which was heavenly, we're on a diet so we didn't get a whole lot of food. The white bean spread they give you with the bread is enough in itself. Our waitress was great, very friendly and kind of no BS which I like.  The place is laid out pretty cool, small intimate front with an open kitchen and then what looked like a nice room in the back. We sat up front, it was intimate and fun, not loud and boisterous which I liked. I got the Osso Bucco and it was the best I've ever had and I've had a ton of it. It fell off the bone. The risotto underneath was outstanding to say the least. There wasn't a speck left on my plate when I finished. I can't remember what my fiance got, but I tried it and it was also amazing. We both got desserts, the bourbon glazed donuts had a kick which I honestly didn't expect. I loved it, my fiance, not a huge bourbon fan but she still liked them. It was definitely unique. I had the chocolate cake, it was pretty good not mind blowing but very good.One of the best parts about this place is that it is BYOB. Our tab with all that came to just over $100. The only reason I don't give 5 stars because after we finished our entree the waitress asked us to move tables so they could get in a 4 top. Not really a fan of moving mid swing that was kind of annoying, luckily we were at dessert and almost ready to leave. I feel if you sit me somewhere I plan to stay there.

265,5aZX8bTiD0k9vR60SG588Q,Alison C.,4.0 star rating,"The Dining Room at Anthony David's has a fabulous reputation around Hoboken.  However, when I had visited it for brunch several years ago, I had found it rather greasy and not worth the hefty price tag.  My friend recently convinced me to give it another try, but for dinner this time.  I reluctantly agreed and was glad that I did.  The cozy space offered seating in either their smaller cafe upfront or a larger dining room in the back.  Our gracious waiter sat us at one of the more roomy tables in the front of the space, which allowed for prime people watching.  We loved the fact that the restaurant was BYOB and treated ourselves to two bottles of sweet white wine.  Our server did a fabulous job of keeping them chilled and refilling our glasses as necessary.We began our meal with a selection of 6 antipasti - 3 being from the Market Vegetables list, and the other 3 composing a small cheese plate.  Grilled Artichokes were perfectly seasoned.  Flavorful bulbs of Fennel were infused with with almonds for added texture.  The Garlic Zucchini was also fabulous.  In addition our platter of Tallegio, Aged Gouda, and Aged Manchego was a creamy delight.For dinner, I enjoyed 4 perfectly Seared Sea Scallops, which were served over a sweet, home-style creamed corn.  A splash of orange infused a citrus essence, and the topping of micro greens kept this a healthier option.  My brother's Truffle Risotto was the perfect texture and was packed with mushroom flavor.  The dish was topped with a sprinkle of Parmesan and micro arugula.  Despite all of these highlights, my friend's Veal Bolognese was dry and bland.  The seasoning from the wild mushrooms, fresh herbs, and arugula did little to enhance the flavor.  The meat was served with a fresh helping of tagliatelle.  Unfortunately, the meal continued to its end on this sour note with an arid brownie that did nothing to satisfy our chocolate craving.  The highlight of the dessert was actually the accompanying pistachio gelato, which was creamy, nutty, and just plain heavenly.As a whole, I would deem our dinner at The Dining Room a success, but there were a few blunders in the execution that put a slight ding in the experience.  However, I would certainly be more apt to return now than I was years ago.",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

Just buy some OJ and bring a bottle of champagne...what a brilliant idea!Oordered the nutella donuts for dessert to take home (which i finished before i signed the bill) - they were actually just OK, not much different than if i bought a box of munchkins and started dipping them in a huge jar of nutella that i bought from shop rite..ohh i just had an idea..anyway, price for brunch is pretty reasonable, especially given the caliber.I will return, look forward to trying some of the other choices. Anthony David's and Amandas to me are pretty much on par for brunch, with Anthony David's having an edge for more of a casual atmosphere and the BYOB touch - Amanda's if you are trying to prove to someone you are a gentleman.

Dessert was caramelized bananas with cherries (possibly macerated or bruleed), and very good gelato, as well as nutella donuts.  The cappuccinos and lattes are huge and very well done.  The service was also friendly and attentive.  One tip (which you've probably seen from other reviews) is that AD is BYO, so remember to grab a bottle before you head out.",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

We started with several appetizers: autumn bruschetta, spicy tuna tartar, grilled asparagus, golden beets, grilled octopus. Everything was really delicious with my favorite being the grilled asparagus which was served with a sunny egg, prosciutto, grana and truffles. So delicious. The octopus tasted a bit burnt but overall it paired well with the beans, fennel, tomatoes, and garlic.For my entree, I ordered the chilean sea bass which was served on a bed of crispy prosciutto brussels sprouts. The flavor was delicious. I also tried a few bites of the potato gnocchi with lobster which was delicious - great flavors. However, towards the end of the mean, I think my taste buds were overwhelmed and everything tasted salty.For dessert, I ordered the strawberries with bread crumbs and whipped cream.

I dropped in on them, not knowing if I wanted to eat, but I thought a glass of wine at least - but found out they were BYOB - that's fine, so I asked to see the menu... they brought me a dinner place setting... (please give me what I ask for first... I may not want to order food, so why waste both our time) - Since they were all eating and I couldn't just go out and get a bottle of wine and drink it in that place without ordering food, I ordered something simple - so I picked the Pumpkin Tortellini - butter, sage, shaved pecorino... When it arrived, my first comment to my friend was ""did I order the child portion?"" - I think that I counted 10 pieces... and they looked (texture and taste) like they were just freshly nuked. I was drinking - and got hungry, so I ate them... The price though... What would you expect to pay for a good plate of PASTA in a nice Manhattan restaurant? $15.00? $17? $19? well... on the Dining Room Restaurant's website, it's priced at $24.00 - anthonydavids.com/DR_Sit…And I have to admit that I totally missed that... I thought that I had read $13.00 - But they must have recently updated their pricing... it was $33!!!!! yes, THIRTY THREE US DOLLARS (the American currency) for a minuscule plate of pasta!!! I had to go back and get the menu to check - I was shocked!  Sure the place IS DEFINITELY cute, they wait staff, just ""meh""... not rude but not friendly. But $33.00 for a half portion of pasta?!...

I typically prefer to incorporate meat in all of my meals, but their ricotta and truffle eggs Benedict is amaze.. And with a side of bacon, it's pretty much a perfect breakfast. Their eggs benny selection is nice - my only criticism is that their lobster eggs benny doesn't have enough lobster. I also like their french toast with the coconut oil.

He was so enamored with these women that he almost spoke to them for a good thirty minutes. Everyone needs love sometimes, but it shouldn't come at the expense of delivering quality service when you are spending money on a good meal.Besides that, food is excellent.Cheese plate is around $18 for 4 varieties. We know nothing about cheese, so the waiter picked some out. Two were good, two were not so good. Appetizers..we ordered bruschetta and seared ahi tuna. Both were delicious and very filling. Nothing really to comment on, as both are standard fare.Pasta..Pumpkin tortellini. This was also very good - the sauce was good and the portion was very generous. Since it was split between two people, they brought it out on two plates which was a nice gesture.After that, we were stuffed. Didn't even try for an entree.

Everything was a bit stiff, but the taste was decent. This place is popular, so I was rather disappointed. The drinks came in wine glasses. I would've preferred a regular glass, since I ordered lemonade, not wine. There was something in most of the glasses of water we got, and in my lemonade as well. Not too big a deal, I guess. I would've given more stars if the service wasn't bad.I'm fine with waiters and waitresses not hanging over me the whole time, and the waitress didn't check on us at all. Doesn't matter to me. We spent a total of about $80, and were prepared to give her a $10 tip. That changed when we looked at the check.She entered us into the computer as a party of 6, so that we would have to pay a 20% tip; $15. If that was an accident, we would've been okay with it.  However, when we asked her about it, she claimed that she had no control over it and that the computer did that. Right. The computer automatically determines how many people came in. One of us owns a restaurant. There's no way we would be foolish enough to fall for that. She fixed it - and the 20% gratuity fee was gone. I wonder why.Like I said, we wouldn't have minded if it was a genuine mistake. However, the waitress tried to lie to us, and I find that unacceptable. We gave her a $5 tip, though I would've rather given her a tip of $0.01.

308,U8OmebpJzRr7_IkCp8k2Qg,Samson C.,1.0 star rating,"A former favorite of ours, my wife and I had been going to Anthony David's since we moved to Hoboken 9 years ago. We relished the lobster gnocchi, savored the delightful duck, and found the nuanced flavor concatenations utterly exquisite. That was, until we started tiring of the perplexingly inappropriate, surly, and unapologetically incompetent behavior of certain employees.The most glaring instance was when my parents came in from Europe. Of all culinary possibilities, we chose this place as the finest cuisine in the area for my parents. We even brought a bottle of Veuve Clicquot to celebrate their arrival. Of course the waitress promptly broke one of the glasses and sent shards into another (just-filled) champagne glass. Her response? Did she apologize profusely? Did they offer to comp us something for rendering a glass of expensive champagne undrinkable? Of course not. The waitress coldly said she'd clean it up, and that was it. Not even a perfunctory performance to pretend she gave a damn. No offer to make it up to us. Usually waiters feel a teensy bit bad, or at least pretend to. They usually make some gesture of apology, and offer to make it up somehow. No, this waitress couldn't have cared less. It even took her awhile to return to remove the broken glass. If anything she showed more apathy or contempt than concern. My parents were appalled by her complete coldness and unprofessionalism. (We've seen her there for years. We never understood the attitude of this lanky (formerly) blond waitress who spoke to customers in a cold, transactional voice and showed complete disdain for others. Why does one get into a customer service industry if one has such contempt for others? I never saw her smile or act politely in all the years we went there. Ever.)Back to the cracked glass in dad's champagne. No apology, no nothing. And some other employees behaved similarly. A friend once met us there for brunch. He had literally been hit by a car weeks before and had just exited the hospital. He was standing there holding a cane for support, so he asked if he could sit down while waiting for a brunch table. The response from the maître de? ""You don't look disabled"" she said - and NOT as a compliment in a supportive way, but in an incredulous, ""I don't believe you so f--k off"" mode of disdain. (My friend insists that the crab cakes Benedict are scrumptious enough to weather such gratuitously asinine behavior, but I'm not so sure.)And again: We once went there for my wife's birthday. We were placed next to the bathroom in a room entirely empty except for one other couple. I asked if we could have a table further away from the lavatory, and the waitress insisted that the room was entirely booked. People would fill up the tables in minutes. An hour and a half later, only one other couple arrived. 5 other tables remained open, an hour and a half later. (I even asked innocently - to a different waiter - whether it was a slow night or whether there had been cancellations. He said categorically that there had been no cancellations whatsoever. Opened the book to show me.) So here this waitress lied to us, and was just being callous by placing us by the lavatory & refusing to move us a few feet away, and for no other reason that she didn't feel like it. Happy birthday. What joyous, kind customer service.Does that mean that everyone there is so inexplicably cold and callous? NO. There's one waiter (a playwright or actor perhaps?) who has always been consistently amicable over the years. The chefs and kitchen staff were always jovial and welcoming. But certain people who continue to work there are devoid of any kind of kindness or professional responsibility. I suspect that they'd more appropriately be prison guards or employees of the Motor Vehicle Commission than work at a restaurant where (hypothetically) amicability and respect would make for a pleasant dining experience....Sadly, these are only a few examples of such inappropriate and contemptuous behavior.Do the owners care? I'd be surprised. I think 9 years is long enough to determine whether people are just having an off night, whether nasty behavior is a fluke, or whether they are callous people who really don't give a damn about even pretending to be civilized.",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

For my entree, I had a delicious boar ragu with papardelle pasta. The pasta was clearly homemade. Finally, I wrapped up with a completely unnecessary but delicious chocolate pudding icebox cake for dessert.

Our server was also great about refilling our wine and making sure our white wine was chilled.My only complaint about Anthony David's is how small and crowded it is. We waited about two hours for a table with a party of three. They do take your cell phone number, so we had a few drinks at a nearby bar for the bulk of our wait time, but once we returned, we felt very much in the way while we waited.

I tend to zero in on the smoked salmon Benedict, which never disappoints.This time around, we went pretty late (it was about 2:30 on Sunday), but the hostess seated us quickly, and we took a good look around. Anthony David's recently reopened after a week-longish renovation spectacular, and the results are pretty decent. I really liked their ceiling fans, which looked like they were carved from solid planks of wood. The staff behind the bar now wear pink shirts, while the servers on the floor wear blue.To whet our appetites, we ordered the bourbon glazed donuts, and they were much better this time around (we ordered them once before and they tasted very bland). Then I ordered my requisite smoked salmon Benedict while my boyfriend ordered the good old-fashioned Eggs Benedict. As always, my meal was excellent, but my boyfriend noticed a fleck of eggshell embedded in his yolk. Doh. Well, there's a first time for everything.I'm not subtracting a star for this mistake, however. What I'm subtracting a star for is the group of loud, annoying and nasally-voiced Jersey 20-something girls seated at the far corner near the windows, constantly adjusting their seating arrangements to take pictures of each other stuffing their tanned faces with food.

My initial read - not crazy about the layout (bathroom is positioned awkwardly in the dining room, kitchen area is very loud), but when we finally sat down with our bottle of wine (BYOB) and heard the specials, I was happy as a clam.  Sat in the kitchen area not far from the door, so next time I'd like to try the dining room with a bigger group.

The omelette I had ordered arrived lukewarm, too eggy and not overly tasty. For hype like this place has I was extremely dissappointed. For the past few months I thought I should give Anthony David's another chance thinking I must have missed something or came on an off day (sort of like when you re-watch a critically acclaimed film because you feel you must have missed the appeal somehow and the problem stems with you). Well, after this evening I can assure you all that  the people that rave about this place are followers by nature or perhaps ordered something entirely different on the menu than I have on two visits because my experience was beyond lackluster. I give the place one star for decor (it's quite romantic) and one star for service (which was above average) but food needs to count for a majority of the review and I give that part zero stars. We started with the special appetizer which was burrata and peach salad. Sounds yummy on the chalkboard but was small and extremely bland. Even a balsamic reduction to the rescue couldn't save this dish. My entree was the potato gnocchi with lobster. The photos here on yelp advertised a cream sauce but the dish arrived in a tomato based sauce. All very well if the sauce had ANY flavor. This, my fellow yelpers was the most bland dish I have had in recent memory. Even salt wouldn't save it. The potato gnocchi dish tasted like a boiled potato in tomato water. I dare any of you to taste it and disagree. The bill was $92 for a restaurant that was BYOB. Once shame on me. Twice shame on me again.

While it was very good, it was the smallest piece of meat I have ever been served in any restaurant. For 40 dollars it was a rip off.

They did not turn on the AC in 90+ degree weather. Their ceiling fan was going but I was hot during my whole meal! And I brought wine ... (which always makes people warmer) The conditions and environment always makes the food taste better in my opinion so ... FAIL. dropped 1 star because ... the server was rough(?) I think I walked in with high class expectations but it was just regular service. Our server spoke very abruptly and sharply. I don't know... I just wasn't thrilled. I thought she gave good recommendations, since I didn't know many of the cheeses in their antipasto list... but still... I felt like I was roughly handled. The food.. all very good.

383,pFIiDBStghnLEGuhn0PsNQ,Abhishek J.,1.0 star rating,"Went here last Saturday for a dinner with wife and two other friends (party of 4). On the surface, this place seemed nice, welcoming, and the food inviting. We expected a wait, and were not surprised when the hostess (who would benefit from knowing that she is in a service industry, and occasional smile would not hurt) told us there was a 45 minute wait. We decided to go buy a bottle of wine (BYOB only), and came back in about 20 mins, hoping we would just wait at the restaurant. After about 25 mins or so, we checked with the hostess, and in her usual i-am-doing-you-a-favor monotonous voice, she said ""I am working on it"". After about another 15 mins, we still did not have a table, and the hostess in her ""extremely hospitalble voice and attitude"" again informed us that the patrons of the table she had for us were not leaving inspite of her giving them the check. While I appreciate this restaurant's efforts to let patrons sit and not ask them to leave despite them giving a check for more than an hour, they need to learn the business of thinking on their feet and figuring out alternatives for guests who have been waiting an hour and twenty minutes for a table. The hostess at this place could learn a thing or two of being in the restaurant business, or perhaps, is more suited for military. The irritated attitude is nothing but a turn-off, ma'am. We weren't there asking for free food. So from my experience, if you go here, you should do the following:1. Order one thing on the menu and sit for 5+ hours and be rest assured that no one in this restaurant will ask you to leave (good for you).2. Steer clear of the hostess - on a weekend evening when you want to have a good time, the last person you want to see is the hostess at this place.Oh, as for us, even after waiting for one hour thirty minutes, we still did not have a table. We decided to leave and go to Elysian Cafe, where the food, am sure is not as great, but the service attitude is drastically better. I am sure the food here is great (I saw it being dished out and it looked fantastic), but I didn't eat here.

The mussels were served in a savory broth that tasted of little more than fennel. At first, I thought it was a subtle and welcome change from the often overwhelming soups most places pour over the things, but by the end of the dish, I found myself wanting a lemon wedge and salt shaker. In the end, it was just a bunch of shellfish sitting in low sodium chicken broth. I was hopeful when my very pretty lamb risotto arrived, but I found that too to be boring. Not only was it boring, it was barely risotto. The texture was all off and it seemed more like a fancy rice pilaf. At least I think I was eating the risotto I had ordered. The place was so dark, I could hardly see what was in front of me. When I tried a friend's pork shank, it turned out to be the same story as the mussels. Watery and under-seasoned. Watery pork. How do you water down pork? The sweet potato mash and sautéed veggies were equally blah. I expected this place to put their all into these dishes, as we had ordered off the special Restaurant Week menu, but I was sorely disappointed.

The flavor was no better than a diner. Now, here's where this restaurant really prompted my 1st Yelp comment. I specifically asked the waitress (dressed like she just rolled out of bed)  if she would recommend the rib eye steak. Of course she sold this baby like it was a Peter Luger rib eye. (Note Anthony David does not say what size this imposter rib eye is on their menu) I was served the equivalent of a seaside heights sliced steak, roughly 1\4 of an inch!!! They disquise this bone out imposter by placing 2 pieces angled over each other. The steak was drenched in some sauce but the bottom line was for almost $40, it was an embarrassment. So, for four people, we got clubbed over the head for $243 and i ts a BYOB!!I'll pay top dollar because I'm a foodie but DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THIS PLACE. The young kids may think this joint is nice and trendy but the food is frankly average and hugely overpriced!                Lou",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

I must say, however, their brunch menu rocks. Their options along with the taste and quality of their eggs and potatoes *and fresh oj and salads put me over the moon.

408,rTX__zM9xijBm846xcptLQ,Monica D.,2.0 star rating,"We had Sunday brunch at Anthony David's. There were several issues with our meal/experience. First, my sister's eggs benedict came with a hair on her plate. When we pointed it out to the server, she just took it off and brought the same plate back right away. She had asked the waiter specific questions about her dish, which he neglected to mention included coconut. He also incorrectly told us it came with hollandaise sauce when it did not. All three of our dishes were lukewarm when they arrived, and none of the three eggs benedict variations were particularly good. Furthermore, the restaurant's main door did not have a spring on it so it proceeded to slam loudly over and over again (about every 10 seconds) throughout our meal. When our waiter heard me saying how annoying it was, he said ""I know,"" and continued to let it slam violently. The only highlight was the chipotle sauce that came with the French fries.

Cheese menu looked to be a pleasant surprise until the selections arrived and were pallid representations of what was expected of a Bouche De Lucay, Tallegio and a Robiola. This isn't even taking into account the minuscule portion size for the price...just bland poor representations of what could have been a great start to our meal. Meats that arrived with the cheeses were passable. The real disappointment of the appetizer portion of our meal was the ""fois gras"" I use quotes because the thought that a duck gave it's engorged liver for that travesty of a dish sickens me... bland-boring-a waste of 18$. On to my main...Wild Boar Ragu with fresh parpadale...the dish came with what I could make out as a GIANT dollop of ricotta cheese (I say make out as the lighting was non existent, if not for the street light outside we would not been able to locate our utensils). I was informed by our server that the dish has ""many levels and layers of flavor"" I only encountered one, is lackluster a flavor? - maybe my taste buds had been put to sleep by the boredom of the appetizers? When the fresh made pasta is the highlight of your dinner and you are in desperate need of both salt and pepper to season the dish to have any flavor to go with the  over cooked arugula which is like green brown dental floss...there is a fundamental flaw in the dish. For 33$ I felt violated. I cannot say that anyone in my group was pleased with their dish. The special Seafood Pasta dish should have been called muscles and spaghetti...The gnocchi with lobster seemed to be the biggest let down. All in all the best part of this evening was the company and the wine ....both supplied by our party.

Both times, as we walked by Anthony David's, she mentioned how much she loved the restaurant and how good the truffle risotto was. For her birthday this February, I wanted to get her a gift certificate to AD's. I called, and they gladly processed a gift certificate and sent it to her that day. Unfortunately, a week went by and she hadn't received it. I called tje restaurant, and the staff remembered talking to me and confirmed with invoicing that the certificate was processed and sent. They then took down my information, canceled the first certificate, and sent another one to my friend's work address. The staff was incredibly informative, helpful, and cheerful through the whole ordeal. My friend received the second gift certificate and was extremely excited to have an excuse to go back for more truffle risotto!I was very impressed with how friendly and helpful the 2-3 people that I interacted with throughout the last couple weeks.

Nutella makes everything better, but this was extremely bland, and almost stale tasting. Then, I had two scrambled eggs with bacon, breakfast potatoes and toast. The eggs were dry, overdone and had no seasoning, the potatoes looked like someone had sat on them (nothing like the pictures other showed) and they were salty and had poor flavor. They tasted like mush, not potatoes and the peppers were sour. I've literally had better at Denny's, so for $13, I expected a lot better. My husband ordered one of their specialty eggs benedicts and found it equally bland with soggy bread. To top it off the cappuccino was watered down to the point where my husband couldn't finish his.  Even though the wait staff was incredibly nice and efficient, the food really was just bland to gross, so we won't be back.

On my way I picked up a bottle of vino since it is BYOB, the local liquor store is one block from the restaraunt. When I walked into the restarant it was dimly lit and cozy, great place to celebrate an occassion, have wine and food with friends or go on a date. We were seated outside. Our waiters were very prompt and reliable; suggested selections and answered our questions about the menu. I had the potato tart, it was recommended here by fellow Yelper's, it was good but I would have perferred that the dough was not as over cooked on the edges. The toughness of the edges distracted me from getting the full flavor of the dish. For my entree I had the cherry glazed duck recommended by our waiter, his favorite dish. Originally I had planned to go with the pumpkin tortellini but I figured this guy knew what he was talking about and I was in the mood for protien.  The duck was cooked very well, tender and juicy but it lacked seasoning in the middle part of the cut. The outer fatty portions of the meat held the bulk of the seasoning and flavor. The inner portion was very ducky (meaty) tasting, a little acrid. The duck is served with a polenta and spinach. The polenta was good the cherry sauce added to the flavor, again cooked very well. The portion was generous.My friend the bday girl had the special hollow pasta, which she loved but the portion was very small compared to the rest of our dishes. For dessert I had the brownie with pistachio ice cream, which was a reliable choice and my friend had the poached pear with vanilla gelato, I forgot to ask for a taste but I am pretty sure she enjoyed it.

Also, risotto is disappointing- basically your average white rice with a crap-ton of cream dumped on it.  The weird mashed beans that come with your bread is stupid and bland.Brunch is completely hit or missfinal thought: we recently took my bf's family here because we thought it was one of the more impressive restaurants in hoboken and they were not happy with their meal.  next time (which won't be for a while) we'll just nosh on some shared plates and skip the entrees.  i like the ideas and creativity in the menu but The Dining Room either needs to improve execution or lower their prices in order for me to feel it's money well spent.",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

My meal came with the breakfast potatoes and, be warned, nowhere on the menu does it say that they potatoes have a kick, but they definitely do. I'm not so great with spice, so it was a huge disappointment that I couldn't eat the potatoes. Our waitress noticed that I hadn't had any of the potatoes and we explained the situation. She offered to bring me French fries instead and, I don't know what they put in those fries, but they are goooooooooood! I really can't tell you why, but they may be some of the best fries I've had. They probably had sea salt instead of something else and they seemed to have a different (but good!) flavor to them.  Definitely a fan. *Note: They also have a wide variety of gourmet coffee, which they sell by the  1/2 pound.

Oh' and that was just the beginning. Main course was scallops which were excellent.they certainly make an effort to strive towards perfection - definitely an ""A"" on my list. the only setback was that i felt it was just slightly overpriced (not a big enough issue to take away that 5th star though). however, given that it's BYOB, the $$ increase in food is most likely subsidizing any lost revenue in wine/liquor sales.Again, overall great place, great staff - definitely will be back.Cheers",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"
449,qjj5-O1sViGF7d2ZfcwGQg,Chris U.,4.0 star rating,"I should first clarify that this review is based on approximately 30 breakfast/brunches at Anthony & David's over the past 3 1/2 years.   This does not reflect the quality of food for their dinner service.Brunch seems to be a ubiquitous tradition in this ""mile square"" city and any place that is remotely good seems to be jammed packed from 11 to 2 on any given Saturday and Sunday.  This presents some problems, particularly in the high-volume, table-turning joints who struggle to maintain quality while managing the crowds.  This is not the cas with Anthony & David's, however, which has probably delivered the most consistant, high quality brunch of any restaurant that I frequent in Hoboken.The space is small and can be cramped.  If you are in the back ""Dining Room"" section of the restaurant, it is one of those situations where you will be sharing your neighbors' plates.   Eating in the front room, or outside during warm weather, provides you a bit more room.  Nonetheless, the space is comfortable and inviting and, despite the usual packed crowd on the weekends, wait times are usually short, but you never feel rushed after you are seated.The quality of the coffee is a good place to start - strong, robust and fresh brewed.  The fresh-squeezed OJ is equally as good.   Starting the meal with their fresh fruit plate or their signature ""Bourbon Glazed Donuts"" is a good way to over-indulge yourself.  Everything is always of the freshest quality.The breakfast menu is well executed with a good variety.   Omeletts and fritattas are always cooked perfectly, fluffy and well-seasoned.  The thick-cut bacon that is offered as a side is delicious.  The ""breakfast potatoes"" tasty and not too heavy.The french toast deserves a review in and of itself.   It is terrifically thick, slightly crispy, but very light.  It is good by itself, but is also offered as a small order as a side to whatever else you've ordered.  I shamefully admit that there are days where I have ordered the fruit plate, a fritatta, a side of bacon and side of french toast (the latter two for sharing with my companion).   That usually satisfies me until dinner and puts a big smile on my face.",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

The kitchen puts out mediocre food, not acceptable, especially considering how expensive it is to eat here. Is someone high back there? How sloppy must you be to get eggshell on a poached egg dish? Our meals were not particularly fresh or correctly cooked and the plating was messy and amateurish. They used to put a proper slice of smoked salmon on their Salmon Benedict--which is what it should be for the $15.50 price tag--but now they use salmon bits, the odds and ends. Do they think neighborhood customers who frequent our local dining establishments won't notice? We notice detail. Service was poor. No one checked on us during our meal, even though we were out of water, coffee and needed a clean fork. This was the third time in three visits that the silverware was dirty.

The waitress was extremely helpful, knowledgeable and attentive. I enjoy it when I ask for the staff's recommendation and their response shows that they know the food well, know what their customers like, and take what you're in the mood for seriously. We had come in a little before the kitchen opened, so we sat for antipasta - 4 items off the antipasta menu for $20. The portions for the antipasta were large and i was quite satisfied with it as an appetizer (I was starving at the time). I had the duck breast for dinner and the cherry sauce really made the difference with this dish - fresh, light and good portion size, which I am extremely grateful for because the prices made me uneasy. I am not sure how you can charge $30+ for almost every entree on the menu, including pasta dishes, but at least the food was delicious, enjoyable, and filling. I don't mind spending the money as a treat once in a while but definitely can't hit this spot up all the time. We split the old school chocolate pudding for dessert - very chocolaty! But perfectly paired with the cappuccinos we ordered (one iced and one hot). The hot cappuccino was served in a LARGE cup. I mean like the size of my head large. Typically, in these kinds of establishments that charge $4 for a cappuccino, i expect a dinky/average cup, but this was a nice surprise and i felt i got my moneys worth.

We were finally seated close to 10. If you enjoy eating practically in the dark and mere inches away from your neighbors, than this is the spot for you! The room was so dark that I wouldn't even call it romantic as much as I would call it just downright creepy. We were seated in the dining room area practically on top of two other couples. The couple on my left was taking their dear sweet time, as they had actually finished their meals by the time we sat down, yet we ate and paid before they even left. The couple on my left were exchanging gifts. I felt like I was intruding on their tender, private moments. Awkward. The tight seating was one of my biggest gripes at Amanda's, so I was sad to see this was the case at Anthony David's as well. I don't understand how these gourmet food places can master the art of serving a good meal, but simple table placement baffles them. Onto the food and service. Our waitress was very nice, and the food came out quickly, which we were grateful for since we were both starving. We ordered the tuna tartar for an app and she asked if we were splitting it, so they split the entire dish. Awesome! Definitely took the work out of splitting the dish ourselves. It was yummy with a little kick to it. For an entree, I was split between the truffle risotto and the bucatini, and went with the bucatini on the waitress' recommendation. I liked this dish. The sauce had a slight spice to it, and although it was a little watery, I actually prefer that over chunky sauce. I didn't even realize the pancetta was even mixed in until I got more than halfway through the dish. A good choice, although I'm wondering if it was definitely better than the risotto. My boyfriend got a rigatoni special and was satisfied with his meal.I have yet to make a visit here where they get everything right.

488,eovbRAe5rekamkAQt5ofaQ,J C.,5.0 star rating,"This review is so insanely overdue.  Anthony David's is the only restaurant in Hoboken that truly deserves a 5 star review, in my opinion. Apologies in advance if I get carried away.My boyfriend and I have been living in uptown Hoboken for 5 years now.  For the first two years (!!!) we were somehow ignorant of the amazingness that is AD.  To think of all the brunches we had right across the street at Elysian, when we could have been at AD instead.  I shudder at the thought.Thankfully, over the past three years we have been to AD countless times for both brunch and dinner.  We have only had great experiences. Just note that the waits at primetime on the weekend tend to be crazy (they don't take reservations on Friday/Saturday), so we are always sure to go at off peak times like 2pm or 9pm. If you don't do that, be prepared to wait on most days.BRUNCH-The star of brunch for me is actually a side...the gorgonzola fries! I thought I didn't like gorgonzola cheese until I tried these at the recommendation of a friend.  Well good lord apparently I do like it.  They are  t o  d i e  f o r.   And only like $3.-Amazing ""breakfasty"" items: french toast with coconut butter, guacamole and spicy chorizo benedict, STEAK AND EGGS (omg), southwestern omelet, grilled portobello omelet-Amazing ""lunchy"" items: anjou pear salad (there's that gorgonzola again!), warm goat cheese salad, prosciutto panini^I'm realizing I'm naming like half the menu haha, so maybe I'll just name the things I've had that weren't as amazing, but definitely still good: lobster roll benedict (i was expecting to be blown away), chopped salad (yummy but I enjoyed the other salads more) and the grilled ahi tuna burger (probably the only borderline disappointment for me,  the fish was cooked nicely but I wanted more flavor)DINNER-We usually start with the antipasto- 2 cheeses, 2 cured meats, and 2 vegetables. Can't go wrong there....fresh, delish, and I especially love the tallegio cheese.-Appetizers: my favorites so far have been the veal meatballs (YES!!) and the grilled octopus (which I don't think they have on the current summer menu). The only one I've been disappointed in is the spicy tuna tartar. Tasty, don't get me wrong, but not amazing...which I guess makes sense for an Italian and not Japanese place.-Pasta: rabbit cannelloni, potato gnocchi and bucatini all amazing.-Entrees: seared sea scallops=perfection and the crispy duck breast is definitely a HIGHLIGHTDESSERT-Fried bananas MMMM and ice box cake WOW. They also used to have this amazing strawberry crumble thingy.So I guess I'll stop now that I'm embarrassed by just how many things I've tried at a single restaurant.  But again, all I have left to say is that Anthony David's is easily the best restaurant in Hoboken.",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

We were looking for something close to our hotel and where we could open a bottle of good wine we brought from home. Fresh fresh fresh ingredients. Prosciutto was freshly sliced. We also chose manchego and old Gouda cheeses. We are familiar with these cheeses and we both agreed they were among the best we've tasted. Appetizers: she chose a beet salad and I a grapefruit/arugula/goat cheese salad. Both, very tasty and fresh. Entrees: she, pasta of the day with an incredibly fresh and tasty fresh tomato, mozzarella and pancetta topping. I had a rabbit risotto which could have been a bit saltier.

I walked up to Anthony David's in the pouring rain only to find out it's a 45 minute wait.  But there's a plus... they will take your phone number and call you when your table is ready. Great. My party and I walked down Washington St. to check out a few places and receive a call in less than 20 minutes to say our table is ready.  We thought it was our lucky day....Alas... it was not. What compelled me to go to Anthony David's was the list... i repeat list of Eggs Benedicts. I saw Maine Lobster Roll Benedict and my eyes lit up. I was going to this restaurant and I was going to order this entree. When I arrived at the restaurant, I was still apprehensive, so many Benedicts to choose from and I couldn't order the two or three I was craving. I asked the waitress to describe the entree. When she did, I had my qualms.  But I held on fast to my dream of combining my love for lobster rolls and my love for eggs benedict into the same dish. Terrible, Terrible Idea. When it arrived, my heart sank.  Before me was a hot dog bun, with a ""lobster"" salad, two poached eggs and hollandaise sauce.  Okay... so, the hot dog bun was hearty and soft. The eggs were very nicely poached -- almost whipped-- and I really liked the texture. The ""lobster"" salad was awful. There was more celery than lobster in this ""lobster salad.  The lobster was so finely minced its presence was negligible. I was bitter.My friend had the Smoked Salmon Omelet and enjoyed it. The portion I tasted was pretty good. We also had the Bourbon Glazed Doughnuts which were more dense than I expected, but very delicious. I will likely go back to Anthony David's because I intend to try several other, if not all, eggs benedict offerings.  But I will definitely never ever order to Maine ""Lobster"" Roll Benedict and I suggest you don't either.",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

What a big dissapointment!!! Terrible service, we waited ages for our meals and when my dish came (I ordered the Maine Lobster Roll Benedict) I couldn't believe my eyes!! For $20.00 I had on my plate a very small Hot dog bun, with some sauce made of LOTS of onion and tiny little pieces of what I believed it was lobster) and 2 eggs. The lobster pieces were so small I couldn't even catch them iwith my fork!! When I complained, they brought a little more of that Awful sauce to the table, no apologies, no request for a feedback (it would've been nice if someone could have come to the table and asked me what was wrong). By the way, we ordered 2 small glasses of OJ. I kid you not, the glasses were SHOT glasses, yes, those ones that after 2 sips you need to order again (and they cost us $2.75 each!!).So basically our meal came to $47.50, we left the place ONE HOUR after we were seated and I felt it was the most disgusting service/food I've experienced in ages.

I like their food, and when I dine in I always have a great experience.  But myself and a lot of my neighbors also like to go to Anthony David's in the mornings for coffee, a pastry or bagel to take out and its always mass confusion.  The staff often has no idea what's in their pastry case.  Once I asked, ""Do you have bagels today?""  and the person behind the bar realized they weren't there and had to run around looking for them. Another time  I asked for a carrot muffin and got a corn muffin.  When I said I ordered a carrot they said, ""we don't have carrot,"" and I pointed to their pastry case and said, ""its right there."" Its also a very long wait to get served if you're getting an order to go. Seating people in the dining room is understandably a priority, but since there are so many people that utilize their take out services, I would love to see them create a more efficient less hectic system.

We opted for the prix fix because for $35 and BYOB, its a real bang for your buck. Too bad if one person at the table gets it, everyone has to (its just how the chef prepares the portions). We started with the truffle risotto to share. It was out of this world, as expected because it is their signature dish. The flavor was distinct but not overpowering - risotto was perfectly el dente. We were all craving more! The service was superb. We had a girl who is a regular there and she was super friendly. After that I've been there 3 times. We've also been served by a young handsome man there who is hilarious. He will really crack you up. Overall, this is just such a romantic and cozy spot to go on a cold winter night. I love to sit near the window. The place is always candle lit with dark wooden floors and walls. It really reminds me of Pastis in the meat packing district, but with a neighborhood feel. I'd definitely recommend this place for a date spot! It was even nice for my birthday dinner, even though it did feel a little crowded. Try going on a week night for a big party. Order Tips:- Definitely get the truffle risotto, but share it as an appetizer. Skip on the lobster risotto - it sounds a lot better than it is. - All entrees can be halved if you want to share. They'll do it for you and price accordingly. - I loved the warm potato tart - a very warm unique dish with pretty plating. My boyfriend didnt care for it though.- Pear salad was very good- Veal bolognese was a little bland and could've used a kick- Some of their specials are really great so don't be afraid to give it a shot!I would give it 5 stars if they had a more consistently solid entree selection.

When we arrived all the tables were dirty.... Like with Cheerios on them and dirty dishes, gross! Then we get a seat the waitress literally is sharp with us, acts like we are lucky to be seated... Meanwhile she's complaining about how all her friends are on vacation. Like I come to a 25 dollar a plate restaurant to hear about someones crappy day ?! I am there to relax and enjoy. Then after ordering we wait 35 min for eggs Benedict and a petite French toast... During this entire time the waitress doesn't even ask if we want more coffee or water etc... Instead after I flag her down she basically just ignores and keeps walking. We get our food finally, it was good. Lacked potatoes, only had 4 tiny pieces... Then dive into the benedict, the truffle essence was not there and on one egg it was literally hard boiled, not what you expect for paying 17 bucks. I wait literally 20 min for the waitress to come back and inform her of the egg, which I showed her and she asked me if I wanted a poached egg on the side. If anyone loves a good benedict we all know that the magic is in the runny egg/holllidase combo and the experience was ruined so I ask for another order and she sighed and walked away. I eventually got it and we ate and left. As I listened other tables were getting wrong orders too. Listen AD... I am all about capitalizing on talent and love that you have so many tasty new ventures opening in town, but you can't expand at the expense of your base biz.

The service was quite slow and it seemed to be a place where you have to be prepared for a leisurely pace.

It is very awkward to stand in the midst of a family get-together and wait for the bathroom to open up. Our situation is a bit unique because we waited for an entire hour before our server came over to us to let us know that the computers had gone down and our order never went through. This would have severely lowered my rating had he not been super apologetic AND served us as quickly as possible after that point. My omelet was delicious and the home fries even better. But the best part was that, due to our wait, the server got a hold of some challah french bread. It really is that good. The best french bread I have ever had.

At one point, the diners next to us introduced themselves as we shared the notion that since we were so close to one another, that we might as well know our company.Aside from the tight quarters, the food was fantastic. The restaurant is BYOB, so we brought wine and ordered the artisan cheeses. We got gouda, a type of parmesan, and one other cheese as well as hot soppressata, capicola, and an array of olives. It was delicioso! For dinner, I ordered the gnocchi with pesto and lobster; my fiance ordered the angus sirloin. Both plates were not oversized but just the right amount. With the ridiculous portions that are offered in restaurants today, these appeared small; yet, they were completely satisfying. We were overjoyed by our complete experience and will be returning customers.",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

525,NiA6r5S4c51nnBihcEOBng,Theresa S.,4.0 star rating,Went for brunch.  Interesting menu in comparison to the rest of the brunch menus in town.  Hostess was a bit difficult when we asked to be seated in an area with less sun.  Ultimately seated at a table was rickety and slanted.  The food was just ok - ricotta and truffle benedict sounded better than it tasted but the chorizo and guac benedict was tasty. Full star upgrade because their OJ is fresh squeezed.,Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

The food is always cooked to perfection and have never once been disappointed with the food, service or dining space :) Brunch is well priced for any occasion, however dinner is a bit more pricey - but that only means we save this special place for special events we celebrate.

I will say that everything we did order was excellent.  Some highlights were the eggplant bruschetta and the veal bolognese dish which was perfectly cooked.  And while we didn't drink, I like the fact that we have yet another BYO Hoboken restaurant to bring a bottle of our favorite wine to.  Needless to say, we were very pleased with our experience at Anthony David's and look forward to trying more of their dishes.",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

531,gSo3HXpEcLv3bNRGtPmF7w,Leander T.,1.0 star rating,"Can't comment on the food here, as we never got to order.We were seated (in the back) fairly promptly for Sunday brunch and had great expectations, having heard such good things about it. Confident that our waiter would be back any moment to to provide menus and a much-needed wiping of the sticky tabletop, we waited patiently. And waited... and waited. After about seven minutes, my friend got up to go find our waiter. The waiter finally made a huffy appearance just long enough to throw one menu on the table. We tried to ask for coffee, but he was gone before we could finish the question. We waited another 10 minutes or so when he finally reappeared... to present the check to a neighboring table. I asked him if we could please order, we've been here 20 minutes and don't even have coffee yet. He hissed, ""well what do you expect? It's brunch at Anthony David's. You'll just have to wait"" , spun on his heel and vanished.Had we known this was their policy going in, we never would have.We took this as our cue to leave. We related our experience to the manager on the way out, who could not have been more sympathetically disinterested.So if you're in the mood for a steaming plateful of attitude with a generous side of cooling your heels, this is the place for you.",Anthony David’s,4.0 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New),, Italian"

Cappucino and coffees come in a big round cup, which makes you feel like you are really having a special moment with that coffee drink! I had the fritatta with basil, tomato, mozzarella, which was good. My husband had the salmon, bagel plate, which is gigantic and really one of the prettiest I've seen - nice thick salmon, and everything just fresh as can be. We shared the side dish of the french toast - this is really tasty for the coconut involved, BUT it's a major disappointment that a restaurant this good would not serve real maple syrup. They could use a few more tasty veggie options on the brunch menu, just to really jazz things up (I had been intrigued by an eggs Benedict with arugula and Parmesan, but there was some ham involved.
