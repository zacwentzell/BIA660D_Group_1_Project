Hudson Tavern has a really good menu and something for everyone - the food is well done and they have some great specials. On Friday night they served a mean lobster risotto with a giant soft shell crab. The husband demolished the crab before I could get a good pic, sorry... but I can vouch for its fresh crispy excellence. The risotto itself was a generous portion with a good amount of lobster and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The catfish sandwich is also a good bet and seems to be an in-house favorite - the fish is nicely blackened and served on a fresh ciabatta. Great food and warm service ... win-win for this old Hoboken favorite. And strollers are encouraged in the back dining room.

I should have been forewarned about the place when half the lights in its sign were not working.  That is a reflection of attention to detail.   I sat at the bar and the bartender provided solid service although the time for the food to be delivered was not the best.for an app, i ordered the buffalo chicken springroll.  tasty but a bit under cooked on the outside.  I would order it again but would make sure to request it be cooked through.for dinner, i had the pan seared diver sea scallops.  HORRIBLE.  tasted like the scallops have been sitting in dirty back bay water for days.  i took a bit out of two and they were horrible.  Did i say horrible....The one concern i had with the bartender is when is he saw that i did not eat the scallops, he asked me if i wanted to speak to a manager.  after he asked me what was wrong, he should have directly spoken to the manager.  don't put the customer in the awkward position.  they just were given a bad meal.     the one good thing was that the taste was so bad from the scallops that i went and had ice cream from ben and jerry's.  that was good but killed my diet because it  took a whole pint to get rid of the taste......",Hudson Tavern,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pubs,, American, (New),, Sandwiches"

45,5Yb0ZMXV1g_wAap78UOvvg,Sandra B.,4.0 star rating,"I got kicked out of this place, let's get that part out of the way...3.5 stars. Bar area feels right. Spacious with warm low lighting, brass and dark wood. A few big TVs. The side dining room had bad feng shui and the bathroom gave me the creeps. Stick with the bar.Food is upscale bar fare. The wings were awesome. Lots of meat on those bones. The bar pie looked pretty lame, but the sauce was really well seasoned and the crust crispy. Surprisingly good. A few in my crew ordered salads, sandwiches, and a dope looking chicken entree. Thumbs up all around.They have a long beer list of boring beers with maybe 2 decent selections - pet peeve of mine. Does a place really need to carry bud light and coors light and miller light? Seems redundant. Put an Ommegang three philosophers on there; live a little.They also had a cocktail list circa 1999. Am I correct in assuming that no one drinks appletinis anymore? But they do atone by offering an impressive selection of bourbons, whiskeys, scotches, and ryes.Okay, that's the official review. If you want to hear about how my friends and I got kicked out, keep reading...Giants vs Dallas Sunday late game. I arrived at 8, but my friends got there for the 4pm games. We were 10 deep, and there were about 10 other people total in the establishment. A mix of giants and Dallas fans with heated fantasy battles that included witten, obj, romo, and the Dallas defense, this game was as high stakes as it gets for my crew. We cheered for the opening kick off, and the security guard warned us to quiet down. Not a promising start. My girl approached the manager explaining that we were going to cheer and, if it was an issue, we would prefer to leave before some folks ordered food, got more drinks, etc. Manager assured us no problem.Then OBJ had the best catch in the history of football. This is where things went downhill. My friend, let's call him double captain guy, and his boy from upstate New York, let's call him fireball guy, got VERY exhuberant. There were high fives to the tables behind us, several excessively loud screams, pounding on the bar. Four older gentleman seated at a table near us found the antics highly entertaining. The other patrons were not amused. Death stares would be the official term.Things settled a bit. Then Witten scored and more tomfoolery commenced. Fireball guy's wife started screeching like a banshee that she had him on her fantasy team, while the rest of the crew booed and cursed loudly. One of the regulars got the ear of the owner, and he asked us to please settle down until the kitchen closed. Not an unreasonable request, but when you have people who have been drinking for 6 hours and spending lots of money in your establishment, often reason is lost on them. So, when we could not comply, we were asked to leave. What can I say? I keep it classy.I gave Hudson Tavern the extra half a star because I felt they handled the situation very well. I understand that just because there are TVs, it doesn't mean the place is a sports bar. They did their best to balance the needs and accommodate all of their customers, even though my group put them in a tough spot. I was impressed with their professionalism and would definitely come back. I'll try not to act like a hooligan next time (try being the operative word).

The hostess say is right away in the bar area as requested. They had a pretty full early Friday night bar crowd which was good. Honestly our server was rather forgettable, but yet she didn't deliver any sort of bad service. The support staff were all great- not only promptly clearing empty plates, but also asking how we enjoyed specific items. I had a key like martini with light cream- one of the most flavorful ones I've ever had. My boyfriend ordered a blueprint beer on tap which wasn't too chilled, but no big deal. I had the pistachio-crusted salmon with yellow rice, sautéed spinach and an orange beurre blanc sauce cooked medium/well. It was awesome! The fish was cooked perfectly, the portions were huge, everything was well seasoned, and it was only $25! My boyfriend had the skirt steak medium with the same yellow rice, asparagus, and a chimichurri. He said his steak was cooked perfectly as well and loved his food. The steak was only $25 too! The chimi seemed blended to be blended instead of roughly chopped per usual, but it still had great flavor and he even requested more. I was really surprised at how much we enjoyed everything.

Instead I will get barbecue sauce.  (EVEN if I order the sriracha wings) And if the floor is wet, they will just sprinkle it with some salt (yes this actually happened.)A few nights ago I was asked whether or not I wanted dessert or the check.  I said I'll see the dessert menu.  Then my waitress looked at me and said, actually the kitchen is closed.  Sooo ok... I guess i'll take the check.  There have also been occasions when I get the chance to order dessert...sit and wait for it... get told it's on its way... watch others get their dessert... and then get told they're all out.  Regardless of the fact that I've never had the opportunity to have dessert, I'm sure I'll be back (Bringing my own Sriracha)",Hudson Tavern,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pubs,, American, (New),, Sandwiches"

My girlfriend and I grabbed a table near the bar to watch the game.Everything was fine until the bartender turned off the game at 10:30  pm to put on the Knicks. I understand the Knicks are important, but comeon. When you see more then one group of people watching the game, screaming, jeering, cheering for 2 + hours, you should know that the game means something to paying customers.  When we asked the waitress to turn the game back on, she said that the bartender told her that someone requested the Knicks game that just walked in. Funny thing was, no-one was even looking at the freaking television at that stage. The only people watching the Knicks were one employee and the the bartender. When more people began to complain to the server, he called her a b!tch and started yelling at this poor server. Life lesson: act like a man and don't treat a server like sh!t. She didn't do anything wrong, she was just trying to make some good tips.Anyway, the bill was $100+ for 2 people and we missed the end of the game.

Always friendly, they quickly remember who you are and pay special attention to the littles. The kids menu is awesome too. Instead of just your usual fried everything with a side of fries, they have things like grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies. My son is absolutely addicted to their macaroni and cheese, and my husband and I regularly steal bites when he's not looking. Salads are all delicious.

They have a great back room area available for large groups that we used. The seating was a little tight, but there was a lot of mingling, so you didn't notice it too much. The wait staff was very attentive to our group, and brought drinks and food at in a very timely fashion. They were also great about keeping the cake cool while we ate, and hanging onto balloons that were delivered there. Since people were leaving at different times, they were also nice about splitting checks as they left. At the end of the party that wasn't the case, but at that point, I don't blame them. I only at french fries during the party, which were very good, but everyone else that ordered from their brunch menu seemed to enjoy their meals. After a bulk of the group left, the remainder of us migrated to the bar area, and eventually ended up sitting outside for a bit.

This time around my trip was inspired by A Taste of Hoboken where I was able to try their White Truffled Mac & Cheese - delicious! So, for dinner while watching the Super Bowl, my friend and I decided to check it out.I was surprised that the restaurant wasn't very crowded for the event and found out they weren't having any drink specials - no wonder it wasn't crowded! However, we decided to stay and split a cheap bottle of wine ($26) to make up for the lack of special. We decided on the White Truffled Mac & Cheese to start and I had a burger with a salad for dinner. Everything was good. The mac and cheese was delicious - as I remembered! A little bit rustic in flavor with ham, swiss, and provolone cheese. The burger was par for the course, nothing terribly special. We did get super decadent celebrating the Super Bowl and the fact we just could and both decided to order the cinnamon gelato (""do you want one to share?"" ""Ummm... NO!""). It was fantastic! I wonder if theirs and Madison's come from the same place... if so, I want to figure out where that is! Oh, and we must have been really good customers because the waiter brought us each a shot on the house called a 'chocolate covered pretzel shot.' Awesome! He told us what it was, but I forgot. Something like whipped cream vodka and chocolate flavored liqueur, then you salt and lick your hand - sounds silly, but it's amazing! Our waiter was all around really good. He made sure we always had what we needed and put up with our lack of ability to make quick efficient decisions.

Their menu has expanded since opening and some of the food seems tasty, but we have never been able to enjoy it. I do recommend their egg sandwich - it's good. Their fish is not very fresh. I had the crab cake and it was awful...smelled fishy and seemed to have gone bad.The bar crowd is mixed, but at dinner and brunch, you'll like find a decent amount of families here.

94,4ZvQ-_csrFoUmMzXW8DJ3g,Jason R.,3.0 star rating,"Ok. So i've eaten at Hudson Tavern a few times. Pros: The Burger i had last year was memorable - maybe one of the best in town. The St. Louis Ribs are awesome - best around, period, the end.Cons: The place is dark...cold....there's just a vibe that is not very warm/friendly. One dish i had was inedible (some kind of crabcake over aioli, don't even know if it's still on the menu). But it was rank. And the last time i ate there, i was screwed out of a free drink (supposed to come with the Rib Special, but i was charged separately for both beers i ordered, and my check actually said ""Rib Special w/ No Drink"" and i was charged the full price of the special. Even though i ordered 2 beers. Go figure.",Hudson Tavern,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pubs,, American, (New),, Sandwiches"

After being turned down for the oysters we settled on the mussels as an app ... An excellent choice. Skillfully prepared and bursting with flavor. I was craving a burger and the better half went a lighter with a chicken and avocado sandwich ... what a bummer ... a woefully undercooked burger with little flavor and a bone dry chicken sandwich which lacked the spicy mayo advertised brought the meal to a halt. Admittingly, I did not make a stink about my mooing burger and just went for it .... dude ... we were tired, we just wanted meal and a beer ...

I've been here a number of times in the last few years, but have only eaten in the dining room once - the rest of the time, I've requested to be seated in the bar, because I like that area more. They have a relatively decent draft list (not too extensive, but it's not all Miller Light, either), and they have a good bar menu. The few times that I've eaten off of the dinner menu there hasn't been anything to really rave about, but if you stick to wings, burgers and sandwiches, it's all good. The music selection can be pretty hit-or-miss. I think they should do a better job of reading the crowd...sometimes it's mellow, which is great, but I've been there a few times where club music is pumping, and there's only a couple of people around the bar. That all said, I'm a fan, and will definitely continue to visit.",Hudson Tavern,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pubs,, American, (New),, Sandwiches"

I called ahead to make a reservation and the hostess was very helpful in accommodating us, even after I called back and said we'd be an hour late! Anyway, we weren't looking to have a full fledged dinner and luckily the menu had some options for us. I had heard about the ribs so I decided to order a half-rack to try. Everyone else ordered sandwiches. Our water was always full while we were waiting, but I can't help but think we were forgotten about momentarily? Luckily, soon after the thought popped into our heads our food was being placed before us. The ribs were very nicely cooked, probably too fall-off-the-bone for some people, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The only thing I could say is maybe too much bbq sauce slathered on top, but I'm not about to get picky after having been so pleasantly surprised by the large portion size and reasonable price of the ribs. A real winning combination in my book! Sweet potato fries were good too. Definitely going to have to try it out for brunch some time.",Hudson Tavern,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pubs,, American, (New),, Sandwiches"

107,5aZX8bTiD0k9vR60SG588Q,Alison C.,4.0 star rating,"Picture it - two indecisive foodie chicks trying to decide on a restaurant for a Friday night dinner in our neighborhood.  While one of us had enjoyed a large sushi lunch and was in search of a Cuban dinner, the other was craving Asian cuisine and had plans to eat Spanish the following evening.  Between the two of us, we had ruled out Thai, Indian, Chinese, Malaysian, Japanese, Cuban, Spanish, and Mexican, leaving few remaining options.  We decided to go for some good old American food.   However, even that made for a complicated decision.  Did we opt for the recently opened Hudson Tavern or stick to The Madison or City Bistro, which we had already established positive feelings towards?  After some additional deliberation, we chose to try something new.  I had once grabbed a quick drink at this expansive bar, but found the scene a bit older and more low-key than I had been looking for at the time.  I was optimistic about sampling the dinner menu, though.My friend and I met at the hostess stand and were given our next choice for the evening - Should we sit in the bar area or the quiet dining room?  Of course, there was the obligatory mutual glance before our collective response.  Though we told the host that we wanted to chat, he took that to mean we should sit in the louder bar section.  We were seated at a cozy wooden booth and just went along with it.  We reviewed the upscale bar menu with its list of salads, sandwiches, and entrees.  As we pondered what would hopefully be the last serious debate of the evening, the busboy delivered some dry, bland Italian bread.  A fragrant, garlicky olive oil was the only solution for salvaging the snack.  Also, the bread was oddly served two slices per person on individual small plates rather than in the standard basket.  Though our first few bites left us bored, we salivated at the prospect of our impending Portobello Sandwiches.  While my friend received hers on ciabatta bread, which was apparently much better than our starting slices, I was able to substitute for a wrap.  The large, grilled mushroom slices were packaged with tomato, fresh mozzarella, and a basil pesto herbed balsamic vinaigrette.  The earthy sandwich was absolutely delicious!  We also both loved that we could get a salad on the side rather than French fries.So, after a night of lengthy, unnecessary decision-making, we wound up making the right choice.  However, this could also be seen as a catch-22, since now we have yet another restaurant option to consider when planning our next meal!",Hudson Tavern,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pubs,, American, (New),, Sandwiches"
