Really nice guy; damn don't think I got his name. We ordered the Peruvian corn on the cob with cheese as an appetizer (I had no clue what this was). But I thought, eh, corn...cheese, how bad could it be? Have you ever had Peruvian corn?! It's crazy! It's a GIGANTIC corncob! Freakishly gigantic! We couldn't get past it's crazy size and the crazy starchy texture that followed. The huge kernels were so starchy that it felt like there was mashed potatoes in it! Be warned!For entree I got the half chicken with fries. He misheard me because I actually wanted fried rice (but he promptly brought that out for me). The chicken was pretty damn big. Juice and flavorful. The fries were normal fries. There was a dressing on the side salad that I just couldn't place but it was tasty.

Of course people in Hoboken are still afraid of the Heights, something about lots of Latinos and that hill makes it intimidating, but I'm certainly not! After walking past El Rinkoncito and being turned off by its small size, hunger pangs led me and my lover here. ""Let's just check it out... if we don't like it we'll just walk out."" O.K. Long story short: we ended up staying. And I am so glad we did! El Rinkon is family owned and ran- a super dynamic and personable father-son duo. We chatted, we drank coffee, and got to know one another after we were informed that the chickens had just been placed in the roaster and it would be a 45 minute wait. Now that sounds absurd when you're starving but they tried to accommodate us as much as possible even offering to deliver it as soon as it was done. An offer we quickly took to no avail because we ended up staying to chat anyway. The wait seems silly but not for deliciously fresh chicken. The pollo a la brasa at El Rinkon is amazing! Juicy, scrumptiously charred, and seasoned well. Hands down some of the best Peruvian chicken I've had and certainly the best I've had in the Hoboken/Jersey City area. Don't be afraid to venture to the Heights for some good Latin grub! And don't let the fact that it's a small place with limited seating fool ya- these people know their chicken. And they're fried rice too! YUM. 4 stars for personable personalities and DELICIOUS food!",El Rinkoncito Peruano,4.0 star rating,$$,"Peruvian,, Latin, American,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I have been here before even took a couple of my friends for ceviche , cow heart and lunch special chicken .This place is small it can fit around 16 people comfortably .It is a dive many local and workers visit this place.The lunch special comes  with a big bowl of soup and the main dish is plentiful  alongside with a can soda for 7 dollars..That price point for the food you get is very good..Like I said the soups awesome The ceviche very goodBut the lunch menu differs in consistency .Example :Once I had the chicken lunch and the chicken was burnt , it was tolerable but overdone.The lomo lunch today was a bit overdone .Included pictures .I will go back yes , no doubt but I hope the get the consistency right.",El Rinkoncito Peruano,4.0 star rating,$$,"Peruvian,, Latin, American,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

It offers very good portions and on top that it resembles food cooked in Peruvian grandmas' kitchens. The pollo a la brasa (rottiserie chicken) is well executed: tender and juicy.. brings joy to the palate. The ceviche is the best in union city. You won't be disappointed. The right amount of rocoto and lime juice. I had to get two of them.The father-son combination works great. The service is really fast and efficient. Don't be fooled by the small location. Bring your own liquor is a plus too. Cannot complain about this place. they even have peruvian breakfast whish is great: pork belly sandwich, relleno(blood sausage), salchicha. I can go on and on. Go eat at rinkoncito, it really delivers a piece of peruvian cuisine.",El Rinkoncito Peruano,4.0 star rating,$$,"Peruvian,, Latin, American,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
57,RlxzEGylaVcwwc7DyDWjZQ,Jeffry G.,3.0 star rating,"Def far from the best Peruvian in Hudson but possible the better one I have tried in Jersey City. As a Peruvian myself I always judge feet Peruvian food by 3 main dishes- Lomo Saltado, Rotisserie Chicken, and Ceviche. Ceviche is extremely rare to find well made due to the freshness requirements.I tried the Anticucho that is raved about. The texture was gummy and lacked the traditional slightly crunchy exterior. The flavor was not bad but not authentic.Lomo Saltado and Pollo a la brasa were our entrees. I was mildly to very disappointed. The Lomo Saltado had good flavor but mildly dry. Like if they had it already done and just heated it up. Needed more tomatoes and onions lacked the 30 seconds more of sautéing. The chicken- the levels of disappointment was slightly calmed by the flavor of the green aji (spicy sauce). I would not be surprised if it was microwaved by the dryness I had to endure. Pasty, dry, chalky, anything but moist and appetizing. The seasoning was on point which just disappointed me even more.Suggestion- throw away the microwave!!! The seasonings are perfect- the cooking needs tremendous work!! Restaurants with potential always make me hopeful of what they can become and this is one of them.",El Rinkoncito Peruano,4.0 star rating,$$,"Peruvian,, Latin, American,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

It finally came, we were planning on calling back to complain about the delivery. We ate the food and all our troubles went away. Ceviche is out of this world. Steak was perfect.

67,7xnOa-iszeiyvzRbir5rXA,Andre N.,4.0 star rating,"Searching Central Ave for some good Peruvian food has been fulfilled by El Rinkoncito Peruano. The restuarant's name is a mouth full. Yet, this father/son team will fill your mouths full of flavor. The multicultural Peruvian flare is present here at El Rinkoncito.Passing this place many times to go to Rumba's Cafe seems to be the trend. This very quaint hidden JEWEL on central ave, has stolen me as a customer. One of the owners explained I should try their fresh chicken. It was a longer  wait than I expected. (remember they are cooking it fresh) When that chicken came out it was juicy with the right amount of charredness. However, what stole the show for me was the Salchipapas. A stir fry of hotdogs/sausages, and combine with french fries, it was delicious. The many weeks I spent in South America. I never ran into Salchipapas. I thought was strictly a Haitian thing instead of fries would be fried green plantains and the hotdog/sausages stays the same.So Hobokenites. tired of Sushi and Pizza try coming up the mountain (its what i hear they call the heights) They also deliver.
