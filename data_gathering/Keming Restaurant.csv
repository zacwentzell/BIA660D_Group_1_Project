0,k6vG6D_q8576ZZ1nZpG0Sw,Gui Bin Z.,5.0 star rating,"Keming is hands down the best Chinese place in Hoboken. They offer a pretty extensive menu, from chinese American to traditional Chinese. We ordered the xiaolongbao (little steam porkbuns/soup dumplings), spicy wonton, sesame chicken, and the fatty pork Mala casserole. We really enjoyed the entire meal. The best dish was the fatty pork mala casserole. It's a traditional Chinese dish, dry spices with fatty pork and a bunch of veggies. The second best dish was the sesame chicken. Good chunks of chicken and not just fried breading like you would get elsewhere. The XLB and the spicy wonton were both really good as well, our one criticism is both the wrappers were too thick. The servers were nice, a little rough around the edges but overall great. We ordered a tea that they forgot about it until we were almost done, but in hindsight they probably did us a favor as we were able to finish everything we ordered and then use the tea as palate cleanser. The decoration was interesting but it's now something to be expected of authentic Asian restaurants. The wall by the door had m&ms painted on it and the opposite wall had a mural of traditional chinese men at a banquet. I got a good laugh from this. I'll definitely be back, also it's byob, what more could you ask for.",Keming Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Szechuan, Hot Pot"

This is a solid order when checking out a new asian spot ANYWHERE.The dumplings were good but I would rate them a touch gummy. You know when dumplings sometimes overcook the starch gums up and that is what happened.The lo mein wasnt bad but not the best I have had honestly. The meat in the lo meon was very fatty which was not a good sign. Flavor was ok though.Now the star of the show... the general tso chicken... I liked the kick of spice it has and the texture was on point. The chicken flavor did not come through and so I would have to put it in the 3/5 star range.Overall, the delivery was quick and ordering easy but that is typical for any asian spot.

I had the string beans with salty/crispy meat bits & rice lunch special and majority of what I tasted was white pepper. The redeeming quality to the string beans was that it was crunchy and not mushy. The mapo tofu was not as spicy or flavorful as I hoped it would be, and the three-cups chicken lacked the soy sauce flavors I was expecting it to have, and was almost bland against my taste buds. The cool cucumber appetizer was good and what I expected it to taste like. This place has affordable lunch specials, and they are available on weekends as well, which is nice for the locals in the area.My opinions here are most definitely biased as I've had better in queens, NY.

For what I can remember -Good - Sesame chicken, solid but a bit too crispy and the meat is not as soft to my liking. But still recommend as I know I'm critical for my Chinese food.Shredded pork with garlic sauce, I like it but a bit too much on the sweet side. Young chow fried rice - good, but again a bit too sweet. A bit disappointing -Ma la pot - this is a very popular Chinese dish and I had high hopes for it. Non authentic Chinese place wouldn't even have  this on the menu. But I think it's over priced for what you get. I was quite surprised for how small that dish was. There were a lot of potatoes to fill in the pot which was also cut too thick for flavor to seep through. The dried tofu is a bit too hard - needs to be cooked down more. The tofu puffs are good. I barely tasted the spice. Not sure if I should've ask them to make it extra spicy but I assumed ""ma la"" by default should be spicy enough.

There were a lot of potatoes to fill in the pot which was also cut too thick for flavor to seep through. The dried tofu is a bit too hard - needs to be cooked down more. The tofu puffs are good. I barely tasted the spice. Not sure if I should've ask them to make it extra spicy but I assumed ""ma la"" by default should be spicy enough. But in general I like it more than other Chinese restaurants in Hoboken so I will go back and recommend for a try if you haven't been.",Keming Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Szechuan, Hot Pot"

I ordered pan fried wontons and they were deep fried wontons... which were also dry. They didn't even include sauce. I'm sure the food isn't horrible, but this experience left a bad taste in my mouth.

36,QW_3g3RCUMGhvEit-paTOg,Andrew B.,4.0 star rating,"Easily the most authentic Chinese food in Hoboken (I lived in China for nearly 3 years, and my wife for nearly 7), which is probably part of the reason for most of the negative reviews.  This isn't the best place to go to if you want General Tso's or chicken and broccoli, but if you're looking for cumin lamb that tastes like it would in Xinjiang, or Sichuan food that's actually made with Sichuan peppercorns, this is the place for you.    The Sichuan selections are the highlight of the menu (the only place in Hoboken you'll find mapo tofu with actual flavor), and their beef noodle soup creates the interesting combination of street flavors of Taipei with Sichuan numbing pepper.  I give them 4 stars instead of 5 because they do have lesser quality in their ""standard"" American Chinese dishes - they're pretty much standard takeout quality.  So if you're looking for something to compete with Precious or Lo-Fatt Chow, this isn't the place; but if you're looking for authentic mainland flavors, it's the only place in Hoboken that's even trying.",Keming Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Szechuan, Hot Pot"

I was casually perusing Yelp looking for soup initially as it was a cold, rainy day in Hoboken and I wasn't in the mood to cook. What caught my attention was that they offered Xiao long bao (soup dumplings, $5.95 for six I think. They have it listed as ""Little Juicy Pork Bun"") and I was sold! I was also intrigued with the Mala casserole (Fatty beef, $25.95) due to watching too much Food Ranger on YouTube. When I got there around 11:30 AM, there were only about two group of people and plenty of room. I was accommodated and seated immediately. I know, I ate like a starving little piggy but I justified it by telling myself that I don't come and visit very often and I can take leftovers home and eat them for dinner....which I did because that Mala Fatty Beef Casserole was HUGE. It was a mixture of fatty beef (better than it sounds, I promise), napa cabbage, lotus roots, tripe, wood ear mushrooms (I think) and some sort of jelly-like item that I frankly couldn't identify but ate anyway. The vegetables were still crisp and fresh, just how I enjoy them. The beef was excellent in portion. The price is steep but it can feed two people....one me over two meals. The Xiao Long Bao.....best I've ever had in terms of taste. Better than Joe's Shanghai in NYC and Din Tai Fung in LA. IN MY OPINION so don't skewer me. The dumpling dough was on the thick side and wasn't folded correctly on some as on a couple of my dumplings, the dough tore and the soup ran out but the flavor of the soup and meatball was EXCELLENT. If I didn't have the mala casserole, I might have ordered two more Xiao long bao as a full meal.

They were pretty goox-- a little doughy but not a huge deal when you soak them in the soupy insides and a bit of vinegar. They also accomodated our requests for extra rice (yay) since we ordered an entree to share (peking style pork rib) which had a lot of bones, a lot of fat, but was pretty tasty with it's hoisin and five spice sauce.So while the place is a teeny bit tacky, the food is good.",Keming Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Szechuan, Hot Pot"
43,a_dp824dgqo_IHi-UFw6Tg,Joe C.,4.0 star rating,"It appears that this place is frequented as a sit-down destination by those in the know. Also, when you do see diners inside during early evenings or at lunch, many are Chinese - which is something you might see in New York counterparts, but rarely in any of Hoboken's existing Chinese restaurants.Here are some other items worth trying. For an appetizer, try the shredded beef/pork/chicken w spicy green peppers burrito. They call it a burrito, but that's more of a best guess translation. Its really a pan fried scallion ""pancake"" wrapped around a delicious mixture of meat and spicy green peppers. As with many of the spicy dishes there, ""spicy"" is a relative term and more mild than spicy. This appetizer can serve 2, but can be shared among 4 if each takes a portion.  For entrees, try these with white rice: dry sauteed spring beans with minced pork, dry fried shredded beef.  Different, but tasty and worth trying. For more tips, check out my earlier review below.Sometimes, there is only one server, but any wait is worth it.

They were hearty and full of flavor, not typical over fried stuff. I asked for my chicken to be extra spicy and they did not slack off, but still maintained great flavor with heat. The chicken looked appetizing and like real chicken, unlike most Chinese places in town. The sauce was delicious. The lady's pad thai was also delicious, and a massive portion. Service was pretty good and they explained the hot pot to us and answered questions. It was a little slower towards the end when we wanted to get the check but that's ok.Overall, this is so far, a much better quick Chinese option in town with what seems like real ingredients and not double fried gunk.

It's the only seemingly legit Chinese place in Hoboken.Ordered the lil pork bun (or whatever they call the item on the menu). From the name, I expected an actual PORK BUN, like the steamed, white, soft puff kind. In actuality, it's a bamboo steamer with several soup dumplings- if they could be called soup dumplings. The pork is an offputting pink, and the soup isn't so much soup but rather the unwanted juices from the meat. Usually, XLB meat is well put together and obviously cooked. This isn't the usual XLB, I guess. Also, I'm not Chinese so maybe my opinion isn't even valid...Boyfriend got the general tso's chicken and it was really good. I couldn't stop myself from stealing from his plate. Crispy, the sauce was great.The thing is, when we entered, we didn't know what to do. No welcome, no 'please wait to be seated' or even 'sit anywhere.' When we ended up sitting, we didn't get a server for a while. Drink refills (on our waters) were so hard to come by since our server was all over the place; it seems like they need more hands on deck.

It was a large amount of food and we were very full. Next time I'll swap the potato for the rice cakes.

No one answers and it is 12:30pm when they advertise ""Open 7 Days a Week"" Mon- Sat.: 11:00am - 11:00pm Sun.: 12:00pm - 10:30pm. I finally got an answer today and they said sorry they are not open right now. WHAT!? There's no way this place is going to be successful in Hoboken if they are not open during lunch time. Not sure if this place is just trying to get everything together or what but this is so disappointing to a repeat customer.Also one time we got the lunch special on the weekend. The second time we came in to eat they said no lunch special on the weekend (also doesn't specify one way or the other on the menu).

We ordered the xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) and they were quite delicious. I doubt there is any other restaurant in Hoboken that will serve these things, let alone well. My dad and I are also avid lovers of spicy food and ordered the beef noodle soup and 2 more Szechuan dishes that were equally as yummy and very authentic.

Despite it being non-busy, the servers were just chit chatting and ignored us for a good five minutes. As soon as we asked for the menu, they got annoyed and rolled their eyes at us. Seriously? I would give 0 stars for service if possible.In addition to that, we had to constantly ask for refills of water. They never came by to ask how the food was or if we needed any refills on water. By the way, the food was maybe a 1 star. Not authentic/spicy enough. At the end of our meal, we wanted to order some dessert. However, the server told us they prioritize take outs instead of the customers within the restaurant, which seems supper odd.Also, they give you a hard time if you want to split the bill with friends (each paying with their own card).Worst experience ever.",Keming Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Szechuan, Hot Pot"

After the apps it took at least another 25 min to receive the entrees (Chicken with broccoli and General Tso's chicken.)
