Pre dinner (ambiance and bar):Restaurant is pretty spacious set up with the main dining room enclosed by garage doors, which, can be pulled up during the summer to expand the dinning area into the side walk. Also worth noting was the seating in the kitchen for those looking to have a more immersive experienceSome of us arrived a little early for the reservation so we grabbed a few drinks at the bar. We ordered a glass of Sauvignon blanc, which was bland pretty standard and a very average Bellini lacking a distinct flavor. When all of our party arrived, we were shown to our table. Food:The evening's menu when we visited was not as enticing as others we'd heard about (or seen on yelp). Nonetheless, to start, we opted to share a couple of burratas, a plate of salumi, and two portions of the ""project X"" cheese (described as a softer Gouda style cheese). The burrata was on the small side, but was tasty, served with beets and arugula. The meats on the salumi plate were extremely fresh and portions were generous. The plate was a mix of 3 meats: prosciutto, aoppressata and cacciatorini. The ratio of bread/breadsticks to the project X cheese was a little disappointing and the cheese itself underwhelming. For entrees, the table ordered the JW chicken (signature Barbuto dish), lamb pappardelle, squid ink pasta and 3 portions of gnocchi stagional (with cauliflower, broccoli, olives and Parmesan). The common theme for our entrees was that they were bland. The gnocchi was heavy but not rich as such; it lacked flavor or excitement. The same can be said for the weak flavors in the squid ink pasta. That being said the lamb pappardelle was cooked perfectly (pasta and lamb) but it seemed like something was missing from a flavor perspective. That being said, the winning dish at the table was definitely the chicken with substantial serving size, moist inside and great seasoning on the skin!ServiceFriendly, informed and quick.

7,CrJl7b8FJZ80OAPyUYPi8Q,Michelle L.,4.0 star rating,"Barbuto always caught my eye when passing it on the street, corner space in the west village, right near the westside highway. Big open garage doors, clean cut looking. Always packed with people. At last, I got to try Johnathon Waxman's place!Came here with a group of 4 and we shared a bunch of delicious plates. We started off the insalata burrata which was a good size to split for bites between 4 people. The burrata itself was super creamy. It had apricot, pear and walnuts. The fruit and walnuts was an interesting add on to the burrata, enhanced the flavor of the creamy cheese. I think the most surprising factor was the hit of salt. Certain people had bites of extreme salt. I didn't mind it because I love salt but a bit of a surprise for the amount of salt present.As for the pastas, we shared the gnocchi stagionale. The gnocchi had almost a crisp bite to it as it was cooked in butter. Delicious! Coupled with the corn and it made it into a very homey dish. We also got the bucatini all amatriciana which had a ton of pancetta in tomato sauce. The bucatini was perfectly al dente, filling to say the least. The orecchiette con salsiccia was on the same level with the others. Al dente pasta, cleaner flavor compared to the bucatini with a ton of pork sausage inside. Overall, all the pastas were a hit!Then the main entrees. We shared the pollo al forno which was split perfectly into 4 pieces. It was one of their more popular dishes. Definitely a dish to be shared. The chicken was super tender, crisp skin. The salsa verde added an interesting element to the dish. It was good! Definitely worth a try. We also shared the hanger steak. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. There was a sauce on it that I wasn't really a fan of so this perhaps was my least favorite dish. Nothing overly memorable outside of that. And of course, we had to get sides. We got the seasonal vegetables which was swiss chard cooked in garlic and lemon. We also ordered side of potatoes. Their patate was amazing. Super crisp fried bunches of crushed potatoes with a good hefty sprinkle of pecorino. A must get!Overall, get the pastas and sides!

Which puts you right in all the action of the kitchen. We had 12 people and I was impressed with the wait staff who were attentive and never rushed us even though this is a three hour seating. We had a four course meal and the plates and silverware were changed immediately between courses. They refilled the water and wine glasses as needed without prompting. This can be a problem in some places although not a problem here. They give you more food than you can imagine. We had so many leftovers.The atmosphere is great, the place was full including the bar. Everyone looked like they were enjoying their meal. ALL OF THE FOOD WAS OUTSTANDING! I'm not going to discuss each one although I'm listing them so you can have an idea of the scope of the menu. The first course were appetizers. Salumi:Prosuitto di Parma,  Cacciatorini & Siopressata, bread and bread sticks. Bruschetta which was made of honey nut squash, Parmesan and aged balsamic. Cavolini Crudi: A salad of Brussels sprouts, watermelons, radish, hazelnut and pecorina. Insalata Burrata:    with Asian pears, walnut & oregano. Second course: Gnocchi, stagionale, cauliflower, broccoli rabe, & Parmesan. Capricci con Bolognese: Veal and Park ragú, tomato and Parmesan. Spaghetti ala Gamberetti: shrimp, Meyer lemon, Fresno chili and botarga.Third course: Pollo al Formo: JW chicken & salsa verde. Manzo ai ferri: Hanger Steak, Maitake sunshoke and black garlic. Zuppe de pesche: mussels, shrimp, striped bass, clams and shell fish broth. Verdure: seasonal greens, garlic and chile. Patate: Potatoes, pechorinno, and rosemary. Carote: baby carrots, preserved lemon, pistachio and basil. We also had a special Tuma dish.Fourth: desert plain and simple ""Toramisu"".Great night, great experience, highly recommend you try Barbuto.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

Overall, a great warm weather spot when the open up all the garage doors. Was more casual than I pictured but still very chic. I wanted to try because this is Jonathan Waxman's (from top chef masters) restaurant. The menu has a good variety of apps, salads, pastas, entrees, and cheeses/desserts. We started with the kale salad, gnocchi, risotto, spaghetti, and gernelli. (We got all 4 pasta dishes because they all looked very good.) For entrees we shared the steak and scallops. Overall, there were 5 in my party and all this food along with sharing a bottle and another carafe of Sauvignon Blanc made us very happy. The steak and scallops were cooked super well. The pastas were all very tasty - my favorites were the gnocchi and spaghetti but others liked the gernelli best.  The kale salad was good and a large portion but basically the largest mess up in our meal as my mom found a piece of plastic in the salad while eating it...we brought it to the waiter's attention and they brought us out a full new one and did not charge us for that dish. Was surprised to have that happen at a restaurant like this. For dessert, we got 2 cheeses (comes with bread and yummy breadsticks) and the gelato (comes with 2 flavors). They put a candle for me in the gelato. Overall really great experience. Yummy food. Nice service. Would definitely recommend reservations for dinner. Can easily be made through open table.

14,79ZAUhMJmV58Aj9Yj5q9Dw,Roland H.,4.0 star rating,"Barbuto is a charming Italian restaurant serving simple and refined dishes in the West Village in New York. If you go during the summer months, try getting a seat on the patio - great for people watching. Although, if the weather is good, the entire restaurant becomes outdoor dining as they generally pull the large doors up - giving the restaurant a casual feel. The wait staff was lovely and the service was attentive. To start, we had their mussels. The mussels were plump and juicy. We then tried the soup of the day which was very good. We tried their fresh made pasta and cooked to perfection - al dente. As a side note, the pasta dish was good but as a tad salty.Overall, I would recommend Barbuto if you are looking for a casual Italian restaurant that serves good Italian food. The prices are a bit on the higher end for a casual restaurant, but the quality of the food justifies the cost.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

With the open layout concept, I loved that it felt like we were dining al fresco when really we were indoors just right by the openness of the street with the occasional breeze. While it was a super hot day, it didn't feel stuffy.We got the potatoes to share, crunchy (maybe too crunchy/some were over cooked?) but had a nice crisp and you could really taste the pecorino & rosemary. We also ordered the pizza with sliced pears, ricotta, and onion. This was very good - crust/bread was on the doughier side and wish it were thinner and had more of a bite to it, but the flavors all blended nicely. The Gnocchi Primavera was delicious but felt heavy by the end of it which a lot of gnocchis tend to do, but I did love the peas in this.

I ate for two hours straight and every bite was better than before. I started with the tagliatelle with trumpet mushrooms and sage. Delicious. Pasta cooked al dente. The sage and mushrooms were fresh and so earthy. The cheese hit at the end with a creaminess. Get it!Then we had the chicken. This is a staple. It was juicy and flavorful. The salsa verde did something when combined with the flavor of the skin that was so satisfying. We also had the lamb and polenta. This is the only time I've ever liked polenta. The lamb flavor was so strong and meaty without being too Gamey. The whole dish was also super well balanced out with fresh arugula radicchio and acid. Every bite got better. It felt rustic and warm and homey except much better than what my grandma could make....sorry grandma but the truth hurts sometimes.....don't hate me....The lamb itself was stewed to perfection...fork tender and flavorful. The little animal did not die in vain. The side potatoes were ok but definitely outshone by everything else. I didn't want it to use up too much of my stomach space so I didn't have too much. They were fine especially for people who like potatoes.If a dish, so rare in how good it is...can be compared to a jewel...say the heart of the ocean (yes cheesy titantic reference) it would be the carbonara. Omg holy murgatroyd!!! So creamy and smokey and peppery with buccatini and pancetta. Like most girls I believe that carbs are evil. But If there is anything that can convince me otherwise, it would be this dish. If carbs are evil then I will sign my soul to the devil as long as this is on the dinner menu every night. Best carbonara I've ever had anywhere in the world. I actually got a little mad at my bf for eating so much of it as we were sharing. I got anxious and took out some and out it in another plate. I'm not ever Sharing this dish again. In summary - it was really good. I even thought about getting some to go. This isn't on the DINNER menu but do yourself a solid and ASK for it.The desserts were cool. The black fig ice cream was a stand out. I love you John Waxman! If the world was a fair place, girls would be throwing their panties and butt floss at him everywhere he went.Service was great. Very fast and friendly. I didn't really notice cause the food was so good. Cool venue and atmosphere. Can get a little noisy. They don't take reservations for 2 so get there early. We got there at 6 and had to wait 45 mins.

The portions varied IMMENSELY between us and 2 very same orders at the bar. I'm surprised at such inconsistency and hope management will look into it. Great fried calamari salad, but people who sat next to us literally has double the plate. Very disappointing to see. The shrimp pasta came out creamy and lemony, with rather limited bottarga (didn't see any and couldn't taste it.) I had to ask the chef to send an extra portion for a measly $3 he charged us. Sorry, but we just came from Capri, where bottarga covers the entire pasta, so this nonsensical portion is just insulting. Finished the dinner with cheese, it was great, though presentation was awful - breadsticks and focaccia overwhelming the tiny slivers in size. Please put in more thought into the plating.Love the food, will come back, but expect more next time. Oh, and please update your calvados selection, it is terrible - tastes like rocket fuel. Invest in better brands and educate the bar staff (your man poured random 1 out of 3, without even asking.)One star for good food and one star for wonderful staff.* * *Came back for lunch a few weeks later -- my pasta carbonara took 45 minutes to make, and it was so salty that I had to send it back.

Big open garage doors, clean cut looking. Always packed with people. At last, I got to try Johnathon Waxman's place!Came here with a group of 4 and we shared a bunch of delicious plates. We started off the insalata burrata which was a good size to split for bites between 4 people. The burrata itself was super creamy. It had apricot, pear and walnuts. The fruit and walnuts was an interesting add on to the burrata, enhanced the flavor of the creamy cheese. I think the most surprising factor was the hit of salt. Certain people had bites of extreme salt. I didn't mind it because I love salt but a bit of a surprise for the amount of salt present.As for the pastas, we shared the gnocchi stagionale. The gnocchi had almost a crisp bite to it as it was cooked in butter. Delicious! Coupled with the corn and it made it into a very homey dish. We also got the bucatini all amatriciana which had a ton of pancetta in tomato sauce. The bucatini was perfectly al dente, filling to say the least. The orecchiette con salsiccia was on the same level with the others. Al dente pasta, cleaner flavor compared to the bucatini with a ton of pork sausage inside. Overall, all the pastas were a hit!Then the main entrees. We shared the pollo al forno which was split perfectly into 4 pieces. It was one of their more popular dishes. Definitely a dish to be shared. The chicken was super tender, crisp skin. The salsa verde added an interesting element to the dish. It was good! Definitely worth a try. We also shared the hanger steak. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. There was a sauce on it that I wasn't really a fan of so this perhaps was my least favorite dish. Nothing overly memorable outside of that. And of course, we had to get sides. We got the seasonal vegetables which was swiss chard cooked in garlic and lemon. We also ordered side of potatoes. Their patate was amazing. Super crisp fried bunches of crushed potatoes with a good hefty sprinkle of pecorino. A must get!Overall, get the pastas and sides!

Which puts you right in all the action of the kitchen. We had 12 people and I was impressed with the wait staff who were attentive and never rushed us even though this is a three hour seating. We had a four course meal and the plates and silverware were changed immediately between courses. They refilled the water and wine glasses as needed without prompting. This can be a problem in some places although not a problem here. They give you more food than you can imagine. We had so many leftovers.The atmosphere is great, the place was full including the bar. Everyone looked like they were enjoying their meal. ALL OF THE FOOD WAS OUTSTANDING! I'm not going to discuss each one although I'm listing them so you can have an idea of the scope of the menu. The first course were appetizers. Salumi:Prosuitto di Parma,  Cacciatorini & Siopressata, bread and bread sticks. Bruschetta which was made of honey nut squash, Parmesan and aged balsamic. Cavolini Crudi: A salad of Brussels sprouts, watermelons, radish, hazelnut and pecorina. Insalata Burrata:    with Asian pears, walnut & oregano. Second course: Gnocchi, stagionale, cauliflower, broccoli rabe, & Parmesan. Capricci con Bolognese: Veal and Park ragú, tomato and Parmesan. Spaghetti ala Gamberetti: shrimp, Meyer lemon, Fresno chili and botarga.Third course: Pollo al Formo: JW chicken & salsa verde. Manzo ai ferri: Hanger Steak, Maitake sunshoke and black garlic. Zuppe de pesche: mussels, shrimp, striped bass, clams and shell fish broth. Verdure: seasonal greens, garlic and chile. Patate: Potatoes, pechorinno, and rosemary. Carote: baby carrots, preserved lemon, pistachio and basil. We also had a special Tuma dish.Fourth: desert plain and simple ""Toramisu"".Great night, great experience, highly recommend you try Barbuto.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

Overall, a great warm weather spot when the open up all the garage doors. Was more casual than I pictured but still very chic. I wanted to try because this is Jonathan Waxman's (from top chef masters) restaurant. The menu has a good variety of apps, salads, pastas, entrees, and cheeses/desserts. We started with the kale salad, gnocchi, risotto, spaghetti, and gernelli. (We got all 4 pasta dishes because they all looked very good.) For entrees we shared the steak and scallops. Overall, there were 5 in my party and all this food along with sharing a bottle and another carafe of Sauvignon Blanc made us very happy. The steak and scallops were cooked super well. The pastas were all very tasty - my favorites were the gnocchi and spaghetti but others liked the gernelli best.  The kale salad was good and a large portion but basically the largest mess up in our meal as my mom found a piece of plastic in the salad while eating it...we brought it to the waiter's attention and they brought us out a full new one and did not charge us for that dish. Was surprised to have that happen at a restaurant like this. For dessert, we got 2 cheeses (comes with bread and yummy breadsticks) and the gelato (comes with 2 flavors). They put a candle for me in the gelato. Overall really great experience. Yummy food. Nice service. Would definitely recommend reservations for dinner. Can easily be made through open table.

34,79ZAUhMJmV58Aj9Yj5q9Dw,Roland H.,4.0 star rating,"Barbuto is a charming Italian restaurant serving simple and refined dishes in the West Village in New York. If you go during the summer months, try getting a seat on the patio - great for people watching. Although, if the weather is good, the entire restaurant becomes outdoor dining as they generally pull the large doors up - giving the restaurant a casual feel. The wait staff was lovely and the service was attentive. To start, we had their mussels. The mussels were plump and juicy. We then tried the soup of the day which was very good. We tried their fresh made pasta and cooked to perfection - al dente. As a side note, the pasta dish was good but as a tad salty.Overall, I would recommend Barbuto if you are looking for a casual Italian restaurant that serves good Italian food. The prices are a bit on the higher end for a casual restaurant, but the quality of the food justifies the cost.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

With the open layout concept, I loved that it felt like we were dining al fresco when really we were indoors just right by the openness of the street with the occasional breeze. While it was a super hot day, it didn't feel stuffy.We got the potatoes to share, crunchy (maybe too crunchy/some were over cooked?) but had a nice crisp and you could really taste the pecorino & rosemary. We also ordered the pizza with sliced pears, ricotta, and onion. This was very good - crust/bread was on the doughier side and wish it were thinner and had more of a bite to it, but the flavors all blended nicely. The Gnocchi Primavera was delicious but felt heavy by the end of it which a lot of gnocchis tend to do, but I did love the peas in this.

I ate for two hours straight and every bite was better than before. I started with the tagliatelle with trumpet mushrooms and sage. Delicious. Pasta cooked al dente. The sage and mushrooms were fresh and so earthy. The cheese hit at the end with a creaminess. Get it!Then we had the chicken. This is a staple. It was juicy and flavorful. The salsa verde did something when combined with the flavor of the skin that was so satisfying. We also had the lamb and polenta. This is the only time I've ever liked polenta. The lamb flavor was so strong and meaty without being too Gamey. The whole dish was also super well balanced out with fresh arugula radicchio and acid. Every bite got better. It felt rustic and warm and homey except much better than what my grandma could make....sorry grandma but the truth hurts sometimes.....don't hate me....The lamb itself was stewed to perfection...fork tender and flavorful. The little animal did not die in vain. The side potatoes were ok but definitely outshone by everything else. I didn't want it to use up too much of my stomach space so I didn't have too much. They were fine especially for people who like potatoes.If a dish, so rare in how good it is...can be compared to a jewel...say the heart of the ocean (yes cheesy titantic reference) it would be the carbonara. Omg holy murgatroyd!!! So creamy and smokey and peppery with buccatini and pancetta. Like most girls I believe that carbs are evil. But If there is anything that can convince me otherwise, it would be this dish. If carbs are evil then I will sign my soul to the devil as long as this is on the dinner menu every night. Best carbonara I've ever had anywhere in the world. I actually got a little mad at my bf for eating so much of it as we were sharing. I got anxious and took out some and out it in another plate. I'm not ever Sharing this dish again. In summary - it was really good. I even thought about getting some to go. This isn't on the DINNER menu but do yourself a solid and ASK for it.The desserts were cool. The black fig ice cream was a stand out. I love you John Waxman! If the world was a fair place, girls would be throwing their panties and butt floss at him everywhere he went.Service was great. Very fast and friendly. I didn't really notice cause the food was so good. Cool venue and atmosphere. Can get a little noisy. They don't take reservations for 2 so get there early. We got there at 6 and had to wait 45 mins.

The portions varied IMMENSELY between us and 2 very same orders at the bar. I'm surprised at such inconsistency and hope management will look into it. Great fried calamari salad, but people who sat next to us literally has double the plate. Very disappointing to see. The shrimp pasta came out creamy and lemony, with rather limited bottarga (didn't see any and couldn't taste it.) I had to ask the chef to send an extra portion for a measly $3 he charged us. Sorry, but we just came from Capri, where bottarga covers the entire pasta, so this nonsensical portion is just insulting. Finished the dinner with cheese, it was great, though presentation was awful - breadsticks and focaccia overwhelming the tiny slivers in size. Please put in more thought into the plating.Love the food, will come back, but expect more next time. Oh, and please update your calvados selection, it is terrible - tastes like rocket fuel. Invest in better brands and educate the bar staff (your man poured random 1 out of 3, without even asking.)One star for good food and one star for wonderful staff.* * *Came back for lunch a few weeks later -- my pasta carbonara took 45 minutes to make, and it was so salty that I had to send it back.

I've tried to snatch one on opentable so many times but they were always ""booked out"". This time, our group of three walked in and got a table in 5 min. I'd recommend to just forego reservations and do the walk in. There always seems to be open tables at this place despite no reservation availability...Food: Bread: It's complimentary but you have to ask for it. Why they don't write this anywhere is beyond me...Kale Salad: Best restaurant kale salad I've had. Our portion size was oddly smaller than that given to another table of two...but oh well. The bread crumbs mixed well with the sprinkle of cheese and dressing. Carbonara: Apparently, Barbuto has a couple of ""off-menu"" items including the carbonara. Its a classic carbonara (bucatini pasta) with bacon. Really really good. Creamy but not too overwhelming. Just a classic. Chicken with salsa verde: Apparently, this is the dish that is well known at barbuto. Chicken was cooked well but there was no flavor at. all. This dish was overall meh. Not sure where the salsa verde was supposed to be but none of us could taste it. My friend actually only touched one piece that was slathered in salt and pepper. This could have been a fluke and the chef may have forgotten the salsa verde? Unsure.zuppa de peche: Also cooked well but it was underwhelming? Not a super stand out dish, but met expectations, simply put. Squid Ink Pasta: Portion size was much smaller than expected. The dish overall was really good. First couple bites had some salty grit to it which could have been due to the seafood but overall fantastic flavor. Loved the addition of the citrus with the tomato. Pasta cooked well.Service: The server was rarely at the table. Filled our water glasses once. Weirdly enough, the server changed near the end of the dining experience which was odd cause usually there's some type of forewarning given. First server didn't mention the bread rule or even do anything when he clearly knew that we were dissatisfied with the chicken. The second server was just rude. We were about to order dessert and asked her a few questions which she very rudely answered back. Let's just say there's a reason why I didn't write any reviews about dessert on this post. Sad case because the desserts did look so good but honestly, service was so horrible that I just wanted to get out of there. To the management: Unsure if this was a fluke night, but to have such terrible service ruin the high quality cooking/food is just sad. I will not be dining here in the future and will probably recommend others to avoid this restaurant in the future.

Every time I come here, this is how it goes:1. Walk up to hostess stand2. Expect to be greeted by the hostess, but instead she just looks me up and down with a grimace and waits for me to say something3. I smile, say a pleasant hello, and ask how long the wait will be4. She rolls her eyes and acts like I have just asked her to cut off her right arm, then tells me it will be X amount of time for a table5. I say great, please put my name down6. She gives me another dirty look, mutters something (presumably to acknowledge that I'd like my name to be on the list), doesn't write anything down, and then settles back into her default sullen facial expressionThis happens *every* time, and it's been different hostesses (at least two different ones). Other than that, food is delicious and the ambiance is lovely once you get past the hostesses. The waiters and bartenders are fun and attentive. If you order an Aperol Spritz, they make it with Contratto - a nice twist on a summery drink.

The service was ok, given a busy Saturday brunch crowd, understandable, but would have been nice if the waiter came around a few more times than once to bring water. The salad with steak was scrumptious. It tasted like it was well marinated in some sort of lime juice. Just delicious. Their potatoes with rosemary looked perfect!

And unlike many of those high-end Italian places, which was decorated in a way that naturally created some sort of barriers between diners and cook, Barbuto has provided a casual and inviting feeling, that made my dining experience warm and unique.Portion wise, really don't recommend getting the family menu (a.k.a. tasting menu) if you are not starving, as every dish was designed for share. My friend and I ordered the crispy octopus calamari, pork ragu, grilled chicken with salsa sauce, as well as the verdure. We both enjoyed the ragu, with the firmness of pasta paired itself perfectly well with the tenderness of pulled pork meat. Unfortunately, though our waiter has suggested us to get the chicken (which we did), we did not quite enjoy it, as the meat was a bit bland and did not carry enough flavor from the salsa sauce - a bit disappointed here as we both heard that the chicken was their signature dish! The veggie dish, on the other hand, was in a sense too flavorful that I could literally call it over-salted. Overall speaking we liked our food. It was a solid four star - reason I would have to take one away is the fact that Barbuto was opened by one of the top chefs in the country however quality-wise it was not really flawless. Nevertheless I do hope that they could bring up the quality of their signature dish, or at least bring down the portion size, so that we could try different pieces within one meal.

Carbonara is just Cacio E Pepe with egg and bacon (so good!). Make sure to ask your waiter for it!- They're pretty accommodating with reservations: I've stopped by here a few times before without a reservation, and am always impressed at how accommodating the host is. If you are unable to to snag a reservation, I would still try walking in (and expecting a reasonable wait)- Burrata: The burrata dish is amazing, and they'll provide bread if you request (which you should, because the bread and olive oil are really high quality)My only complaint is that the dessert menu does not have a great selection.

Perfectly seasoned, crunchy on the outside, steaming hot and soft on the inside. - Bucatini all'Amatriciana: My dish. This was perfectly al dente, and my friend who normally dislikes her pasta al dente also enjoyed the bite of this. Sauce was well seasoned, not too salty with the pancetta. Also the portion was surprisingly huge. I could barely finish it, and I normally can eat a LOT of pasta.- Chicken: Friend got the famous chicken, and I got to steal some bites. Definitely very juicy and not dry at all, but for me, chicken is chicken? Friend really enjoyed it but ""not the best chicken I've had, but definitely up there."" Also a huge dish.

Why is it SO difficult to get a reservation, yet when I arrived there a ton of tables open? I had told the people I was going with so many times that it was so hard to get a reservation and it was damn well embarrassing to see so many spots open. Hurt my credibility much!Anyways. To start we ordered a meat plate & cheese plate. They were both good and the meat plate was a nice hefty portion size. My only quam was that they came with the same type of bread and crackers. I wish the dishes were a little more different & had more variety so it didn't feel as much like I was eating the same thing. Like maybe adding some jam and crackers for the cheese plate? We ordered the brussel sprouts too which reminded me of a play on a kale salad. They were fine but could definitely live with out. For entrees I got the gnocchi with leeks. I found it super dry and the gnocci was more firm than tender. Everyone I was with got the chicken which was super moist with crispy skin and delicious! We also ordered potatos for the table.

But the reality is, Barbuto is just like any other Italian eatery in Manhattan. Their dishes are very basic with little creativity. I came here with a large group of friends so we ordered most of the items on the menu and were able to share. Don't get me wrong - they have some delicious dishes but nothing earth-shattering. I would highly recommend the pork meatballs - might be the best dish on the menu! Spicy sausage for the pasta was also a huge winner among the group.

Options for wine by the glass are exceptionally curated. Expect NYC prices ($12-$17 per glass). If you have cash to spend and want a quality meal with prompt service, Barbuto is the place. Here, you'll find fewer marinara-sopped pasta dishes and more EVOO, ragu and vodka sauces, and grilled and roasted entrees (the roast chicken looked epic). I had the appetizer portion of gnocchi with sunchokes and the calamari salad. Both were outstanding. The gnocchi was perfect in texture, just a tad bit too browned and crispy for my taste. The salad had no shortage of calimari and it was liberally dressed with EVOO (a bit too much, even for Italian fare). Both items were exceptionally rich. Sadly, I had to skip dessert.

86,LoBNVH5E5VHm8Us5_6Hs3A,Ashkan H.,3.0 star rating,"Came here on a Wednesday night to get some pasta. The interior is cool and spacious, and the ambience is pretty spot on; albeit super loud.We ordered one carbonara, and one gnocchi with broccoli. The gnocchi was homemade (I mean for $21, it better be), and very buttery and flavorful. Have I had better gnocchis in my life? Yes! But, this one is high up there. The texture was done right. Brown on the outside, and soft/yellow on the inside. So, If I wanted to judge this place solely based on their gnocchi and their ambience I would definitely give them a 4.5 stars (I would even round it up to 5, for sure). No doubt! But sadly, the carbonara was such a let down. I was quite impressed, how badly they can screw up a simple dish like carbonara. When I got the carbonara, it was lumpy, dry, and I could tell it was NOT a la dente pasta! It was way too chewy. Couldn't taste the cheese, and it was super bland. But, it was edible (unlike their second attempt). However, when I informed the staff, they were very nice about it, and took action. I told them it's dry and bland. Maybe actually cook the pasta this time? Add more seasoning, some butter, some cheese?Anyway, I waited for another 10 minutes. But, the second attempt was even worse! I got this ""carbonara"" pasta floating basically in salt water with pancetta. It was inedible. At least, the first one had a tiny bit of creaminess to it. This one was just pasta, pasta water and pancetta. It was terrible. No creaminess, no flavor. Very watery and bland. The texture was awful. I am surprised how they screw it up even more with their second attempt. The staff were again super nice about it, and wanted to replace the dish/remake it again, but at that point I had lost my appetite. I was also worried that they will just make it worse. But, they took the carbonara off the bill instead. I am sure the carbonara pasta would have been somewhere around $20. But, it's important to note here that all the pasta, except the gnocchis, are not homemade.

I'm not sure if that's true but if it is that's rather unfortunate, because this place is super delicious! Because i have the best friends in the world i got to eat here at the tasting menu table a couple weeks ago and man oh man was it perfect. First of all we originally booked with 10 people, but only 6 people showed up, because some people are always going to be flakes. That being said, we didn't know that we were going to be short until we ordered the wine and until the first delicious course came out. No worry, we spoke to our waitress and she said she would only charge us for 7 people, which is the minimum amount of people you can have for the tasting menu. Fyi. We got red wine and were munching on the first course. Which consist of assorted cured meats (salami, prosciutto, etc), these really good bread pizza things with wild mushroom, and some shirt of kale salad thing that, even though i don't want to admit it, was also solid. Because we were less people, the waitress told us that we would partake in more different types of food, which is awesome! The 2nd course had three different types of pasta, gnocci, tagliatelle, and i think some type of Penne. All were ridiculously good, but one of them had a spicy sausage which was to die for. These were probably the best pasta dishes I've had in any restaurant, at least in nyc. Sooooo delicious. But at this point we had eaten so much of the starter food that we were starting to get stuffed. We barely boxed up the pasta before the third course rolled in. Baked chicken, a delicious roast pork in this really good chutney thing, some sort of fish (and another type of fish for my friend who doesn't eat meat), some cooked veges, and these really amazing friend potatoes that were covered in a crumbly sort of cheese. My word!At this point we asked our waitress had anyone ever finished this tasting menu before. She said one group did, but they were probably pro football players! We tried to eat as much as we could but we were defeated, and our dessert hadn't even arrived yet! Tiramissu was the finale which we again tried to force down to no avail. Which sucked because it was really good, just like literally everything else we had, which is great because we didn't have to eat for the next few days anyway!

I split the melon / prosciutto appetizer with a friend and was surprised at how yumym it was. The fruit is salted perfectly to bring out the fresh, bright flavor, and it pairs nicely with the thinly sliced prosciutto. I ordered the gnocchi, which was surprisingly not as heavy as I expected. Little pillows of pasta are contrasted with crisp kernels of corn and roasted cherry tomatoes. A very delicious combination. My friend ordered the gemelli with pork sausage and I was surprised at how yummy it was! The dish is creamy enough to remind me of Mac and cheese, so I found myself stealing bites off her plate. Overall a great little gem. The wait was a hit long for a Tuesday night, but we were not disappointed.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

Lamb shoulder was overwhelmed by the polenta it was served over. It also had too much of what tasted like vinegar. Steak was over salted. Beet salad was bland.

By the time we were done, I was surprised to be second-guessing the JBF.The hosts were the kind of pretentious little s*&%s that make my skin crawl, but the bartenders and wait staff were relaxed, playful and funny. The decor was vaguely NYC industrial with garage doors that should make it a lot of fun in the summer.The food was better than average but not of the caliber that should be winning awards. Gnocchi, risotto, tagliatelle were excellent, duck was perfect. Chicken was...well chicken. The salsa verde was a mouthful of herbs and somewhat unappetizingly slathered on the the meat. The most I can say is that the skin was crispy and the meat was juicy.The critique is much of the food was in the greasy side, hidden by general over-seasoning and definitely repeated lemon across every plate. A forward-thinking Italian eatery of culinary repute should have more subtle and adventurous flavors, in my opinion.

Mind you, this was the day we got married at City Hall and wanted to take my family out afterwards. Since we enjoyed our meal here on NYE, we expected a great meal 2nd time around.Called to make reservation and hostess tells me the place was fully booked, but they do set aside some tables for walk-in guests. My family walked in around 12ish and the place was empty. Started out great, service was excellent.Food was horrible. I was so embarrassed to take my family here.

99,8blU6xP1PSjujpVJexiMiQ,Henry L.,5.0 star rating,"Of all the places I've been to in NY, this is the restaurant I'm most excited to review.  All because of the pollo al forno.I'm a true carnivore at heart, especially the red meat variety.  I consider chicken a cheap meat and usually avoid it at restaurants.  I mean, if I'm going to spend money at a nice restaurant, might as well get the really good stuff.  Now I browse through Yelp looking for a popular dish and I see the pollo al forno pop up over and over and over again.  Chicken, seriously?  For days I go through this internal struggle until I give in and put my trust in the word of the Yelpers.  You haven't failed me yet.And your winning streak continues.  My bad.This chicken.  This chicken is good.  Here's advice: if you're going to try this dish and compare the taste and texture with beef and pork, you're going to lose.  Comparing apples to oranges is just not the right way.  But if you compare it with all the chicken you've eaten in the past, this is going to be one of the best you've had.  I started with the breast and this isn't the normal sandy dry meat that you hurt your jaw chewing.  The breast is so soft, so tender, so juicy, and so delicious.  I didn't know chicken breast can be this good.  And just imagine if the white meat is already so good, how good the dark meat would be.  It's too much.  If I come back to Barbuto I'm getting this again, and I strongly advise you to do the same.  Oh yea, this dish can feed two or one super hungry individual.Seriously, how do you cook an entire chicken at the same heat and end up with the white and dark meat both being so perfectly cooked?  Jonathan Waxman, how do you do it?I had another pasta appetizer and a side of broccoli.  Both are pretty good, but ended up being in the pollo al forno's shadow.Five stars for the quality and tremendous shock value.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

102,ts5KyXEstaqEV0FyX0G_BA,Ruby Y.,3.0 star rating,"Went as a group of 3, we ordered two salads to share for the table and each got an entree. Food we ordered: 6/10Insalata di cavolo: green kale, pecorino, breadcrumb & anchovy dressing - Amazing salad. Very light, refreshing, and the anchovy dressing didn't bother me at all. You couldn't even taste or smell the anchovy. Insalata stagionale: little gem lettuce, blood orange, avocado & pistachi - Great salad, but not as refreshing as the Cavolo.Roast Chicken: Definitely get this. Flavorful and juicy. Best entree on the table by far.Gnocchi, spicy sausage, Tuscan kale pasta: I'd rate this a 5/10. I was expecting more flavor and spice with the spicy sausage but I had to ask for more cheese and black pepper to spice this dish up. Bucatini alla Carbonara: If you want a pasta, get this over the gnocchi. Flavor was fantastic and noodles were perfectly cooked (al dente)Service: 6/10- We went on a Thursday night, so the restaurant was definitely full which added to the noise level. It's not a big dining area, so the noise level was a little high for the nice low key dinner I was expecting. - When we sat down we had at least 3 different waiters come over to ask if we needed any drinks or if we were ready to order. I'm not sure if they wanted us to get started since it was a Thursday night and they wanted to get us in and out, but it felt very odd. The waiters also just stand on the side watching you as you eat. It's great for when you need them, but other than that, it was a little uncomfortable and made my dining experience a lot less enjoyable. Overall: 6- I've heard good things about Barbuto for awhile now, so I was definitely excited to try it out. Sadly, it was a underwhelming. Since it's in the West Village it has a nice cozy vibe, filled with trendy millennials. For my personal preference, I think the space is too small and the floor plan is too open for a nice ""cozy, intimidate"" dinner. I think the West Village has better gems to offer.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"
103,5_i1Uxi9cay1gTtKpGhDYQ,Katherine C.,4.0 star rating,"Just delightful. Probably 4.5 stars in reality. Ambiance was laid back, industrial, casual, and cool. Looks like it at one point was a car garage that was transformed. The glass ""doors"" were closed today as NYC is currently a disgusting swamp but it's very cute when the side walls are open and the outdoor space bleeds into the outdoors. Lively though I will say, with the doors down it was very loud. Service was efficient and prompt with a hint of cool indifference. Wine list was sufficient and tasty. Food was bomb, we tried the following:-calamari: served with a pesto sauce and jalapeños, very good (would have liked more sauce)-kale salad: was also quite tasty, almost like caesar salad in flavor profile, good but I don't know if it lives up to the crazy hype. At the end of the day...its kale, guys-gnocchi: SO GOOD!! Do it. Perfectly soft, light, with a pleasant caramelization. Loved the squash addition. I will say the portion was very small. -chicken: didn't live up. Very moist but I actually thought it was a bit bland. Huge portions. Would not re-order -orecchiette: delicious! Perfectly cooked and comforting-scallops: flavorful and actually melt in your mouth, came with a bright avocado purée -trout: properly cooked, a little salty and oily, olives were interesting. Portion was perfect. Do not skip dessert!! The chocolate mousse was decadent and delicious. The cannoli was the best I've ever had with a lemony interesting cream. The sorbet was super refreshing.

We started with appetizers of the Bibb salad and the ricotta bruschetta which were both delicious, even though salad was over dressed when we asked for light dressing. For main course ordered the chicken that everyone raved about in Yelp reviews. Honestly, it was good, but it was just chicken, didn't knock me over. My son had the duck and said it was good, but not special. My other son and my husband had the spaghetti in clam sauce, which is not on the menu, but we were told they would make that or carbonara, when we asked if there were any specials. I did taste the spaghetti and it was exceptional. They had the best meals of the night.

I usually have the mindset of never dining somewhere twice- this will be an exception.It has such a great vibe about the restaurant and I love that it's a refurbed garage. Every dish we had was delicious and our waiter (think his name was Gilbert) was fantastic. After placing our orders he specifically came back and said that two of the dishes we ordered had raw egg (I'm pregnant) and if that was okay. Attention to detail like that will always win in our books so well done Gilbert!The food - our faves and the standouts: bucatini all'amitriciana; cucumber with aioli; kale salad and the squid salad is a must.

I have been a professional chef, and if there is something new I always give it a try before judging. However, the combinations on the menu are completely unreasonable. Spaghetti with clams have 'nduja in it, which is a spicy creamy kind of sausage. WHY? It covered completely the other flavors. It didn't make any sense to me.

114,6Swy2gC1Mb2Eint5JBYmIQ,Josephine Z.,5.0 star rating,"The chicken entree at most restaurants is much like my whole junior high school experience: the one least picked and most dry. The roast chicken at Barbuto is alternatively much like my college experience: when you start growing into your weird personality, and learning to embrace it. Let's start with the appetizers. The Kale ceasar salad is awesome, dressed well, and easy to eat. Let's face it--salads made of gigantic un-chopped kale leaves--whose idea was that? This one was perfect. The charcuterie plate had a great selection of proscuitto Di Parma, and salami--but the long bread sticks stole of the show. I know, it's just a breadstick--but it was crispy, salty, and seriously fun to eat. The toss up for favorite is the burrata--on grilled crispy bread, with a tomato sauce and soft, spreadable burrata. You can't go wrong with that. For pastas, consider the gnocchi with breakfast radish, broccoli tossed Parmesan butter sauce--which was to die for. Contrasting that, the  pasta in a white bolognese sauce was perfect--the pasta perfectly al dente, holding together the unique white bolognese sauce (have you ever seen a bolognese sauce that isn't red? Exactly) and soft bits of sausage. I couldn't decide which pasta I like better--just get both!For the main entree, the chicken at this place is renown. The sauce and crispy skin were very impressive--everything about the chicken was high quality and very well made. But at the end of the day, it's just chicken. My favorite entree ended up being the pork loin, which was tender and flavorful, as was the fish. The escarole served was a tangy side, perfect as a veggie complement--but not as perfect as the ROSEMARY POTATOES. My god, these were so crispy and flavorful!! Out of all the entrees we received--this one emptied out first. For dessert, we had the lemon pistachio cake--the meringue-like layers coupled with the nuttiness of the pistachio made this cake awesome. I'd definitely recommend! Barbuto has a great private room in the back that can fit parties of about 10 comfortably.

Our server, who neglected to mention his name, made up for it with his accommodating nature, attentiveness, knowledge about the food, and personality. My palate was graced by their pumpkin ravioli served in a brown butter sage sauce. The flavor profiles were distinct, yet harmonious. For $23, I had expected at least two more ravioli, but as I wiped the tears from my eyes, I realized that $23 is a small price to pay for such transcendent calories. I also partook in some of my girlfriend's capricci bolognese, a much heartier portion for less money. My friend ordered the gnocchi, which was a textural, well-seasoned masterpiece. Full but determined to absolutely glut myself into oblivion, I pushed onward and ordered two scoops of gelato: caramel and chocolate, of course.

I called 3 blocks away asking if they had available any tables around 10 ... the Hostes tell me : I am so sorry we are fully booked for tonight !!! So we passed by to check out if there was any seats at the bar and the place had so many free tables !?!?!? What ? Are you serious ? I guess the Hostes wanted no one to come in as she wanted to go home early ! This place is not what ppl think .... but onestly as an Italian .... pls don't call this place an Italian restaurant because this cheff has no idea what Italian food is !

133,-FL3-KW6RNl7qyJnksnpLg,Paul A.,4.0 star rating,"As one of the more well established and beloved Italian restaurants in the city, Barbuto is going to be missed when it shuts down and moves. I had to visit before the change and brunch seemed like a pretty perfect opportunity since Santina (nicely) sent us packing.The space itself is beautiful. Airy and full of light, with a really vibrant and happy atmosphere, the glass-enclosed location is amazing.Because the menu felt a little uninspired, we went with just two classics: the roasted chicken and the eggs al forno. Both were exceptional dishes. The chicken was tender and moist, accompanied by a bright salsa verde. The eggs sat on a bed of perfectly made polenta topped with a crisp layer of cheese, tomato, and caramelized onions.Nothing was stratospherically good and frankly we wanted to order more but there was just nothing really on the menu that seemed that exciting. Still it was a wonderful experience and Barbuto will undoubtedly lose something when it leaves this awesome space. But who knows, maybe it will gain some new and perhaps more inventive concepts in its next iteration.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

Dimly lit at night, which gives it a nice vibe. Especially enjoyable in the warmer months when the garage doors are raised up and indoor/outdoor seating is available. Food: the kale salad is one of the best in the city. It is a simple but satisfying appetizer that is served in a generous portion and never short on Parmesan. The gnocchi (changes seasonally) is always delicious, flavorful and rich. On this particular night it was served with sun chokes in a warm pesto sauce, delicious!  The chicken is a great option if you prefer a non pasta main; however, it is served on the bone so can create some difficulties when eating.

Great for a nice summer evening like today. That's where the positive ends though.I was here for dinner with a friend and we both ordered cocktails. She got the hurricane and I got the sangria. Her hurricane was decent, but my sangria was just plain bad. Way too much ice and completely watery by the time I got it. I barely took a sip.For food, we ordered 2 pasta dishes - the pesto pasta and the eggplant gnocchi. When the server brought us our food, she simply plunked the dishes down on the table and disappeared. We immediately noticed that we had been brought out some sort of shrimp pasta instead of our pesto. The server was nowhere to be found and it took us almost 5 minutes to get someone's attention to correct the mistake.""Oh! Why don't you keep the extra pasta to make up for the mistake,"" she said. Great. So you're giving 2 people who don't eat seafood a shrimp pasta to make up for your mistake. (We ended up taking it to go to give to some lucky homeless person).Next we waited another ~15 minutes to be given the right pasta dish while the other one just sat around on our table. Seriously? Was one of us supposed to eat without the other? How was this expected to work?!When the pesto pasta finally arrived it was horrible. You can't call this pasta al dente. It was simply uncooked. It actually crunched in my mouth as I tried to chew it. We ended up adding it to the to-go bag for the lucky (or not so lucky, given the food quality!) homeless man. Next at some point my friend tried to order another hurricane. 20 minutes later it still hadn't arrived. It finally did arrive as we were done with everything else and about to ask for the check.Oh and also, no bread while you're waiting, no parmesan for your pasta.Overall this dinner was horrible in every possible way. There were no real apologies for the mess ups and nothing was comped. The service was bad. The food was even worse.

I went during August so I was able to sit outside. It was nice and warm, and there was an overhead so the sun wasn't beating down on your face. I got the avocado toast and the chicken. The toast was satisfying. I think the bread was a bit crunchier than I would like it to be, but it also gave it a nice texture. Plus, I love avocado so I'm not going to complain. BUT THE CHICKEN. I think the Pollo Al Forno was the highlight of my day. It wasn't overcooked. In fact, it was perfectly juicy. The best part was the skin. It was crispy, but not burnt, and the spices and herbs used to make the chicken flavored the entire dish. It's a MUST get!

I forgot I never wrote a review for this place.  I can't believe it because it was one of the best meals I had last year before I left the city. I went with my fellow foodie restaurant buddy. We always have high hopes for celebrity chef restaurants and this one held especially ugh expectations given it was a Jonathan Waxman spot. So we walk in and who is at the host stand? Yep Jonathan Waxman. I definitely awkwardly fan girled for a minute. When we sat to order we had a particular meal in mind (see above). The kale salad was this lemony cheesy amazing concoction of flavors. I think it could convert even the most staunch kale hater. The brick chicken was most inside and perfectly crisp on the skin. Probably the best roast chicken dish I've ever had. It was topped with this interesting salsa verde. Yummmm.Then there were the meh dishes. The gnocchi and carrots. They were both fine. The gnocchi was kind of flavorless. Even the purple cauliflower couldn't save this mess. Ok back to the good...And the carbonara. Wow. I mean pasta egg bacon... Can you really ask for more?

One day, my meal will be superb, the next, bizarrely over-salted or overcooked. Nonetheless, the good meals I have had have been exceptionally good, and I somehow find myself back again and again.The menu changes seasonally, so don't get too attached to any one dish. Constants that are also excellent bets are the roasted chicken (with a side of roasted potatoes - this is a must!) and their brick-oven pizzas. Barbuto also stands out with its seafood offerings, variety of bruschettas, and housemade pastas. Their chocolate budino (chocolate pudding of the richest, most voluptuous sort, in a cup with homemade whipped cream) is so overwhelmingly spectacular it's impossible to finish.Housed in a converted garage, Barbuto's decor is minimalist and the space airy and bright. Diners are able to look directly into, even sit in, the kitchen. This has its pros and cons. While beautiful to behold, the space tends to be quite chilly in the winter (poor insulation), stuffy in the summer (open windows in lieu of AC), and incredibly loud when crowded. Of note, the space does offer multiple options for large groups. For an extra special experience, reserve one of Baruto's party tables (one of which is in the kitchen!).Tips for the newbie:If it's winter, sit near the kitchen to be warmer.Some ridiculously good focaccia is hidden on the menu. You can only get it with the cheese plate. Order the cheese plate. Unless you are a salt fiend, ask them to go easy on the salt if you order a pizza. Most of the time the cheese is salty enough (with cheeses like pecorino and taleggio favored), and the added dusting of the crust is overkill.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

While I know barbuto is known for the roast chicken, I didn't want to use my only meal in the city while on vacation to experience chicken, so I shared some pizzas and carbanara with the table.Both pizzas (ricotta and pear and sausage) we're unbelievably fresh. The Neapolitan style is always a favorite for me, but there was a slice on each pie that was a bit too burnt for my liking. The red sauce and sausage was delicious and quite a contrast to the sweetness of the white pie. I would recommend sharing both to get a chance to try drastically different, but equally good pizzas.The real star of the show was the carbanara. The noodles were thick, cooked just right and tasted homemade. The bacon bits were thick and flavorful with a rich buttery sauce that wasn't overpoweringly greasy like other carbanaras.

The meal didn't kick off to the best start because I came with my 94 year old grandma but once we got some bread and red wine in her she got used to the conversational buzz and outdoor seating of the restaurant. Also, a bit annoying but they make you order everything at once and my family who likes to order food ASAP but may not know exactly what mains were getting found this a BIT frustrating. On to the food, we started the meal with the burrata and the kale salad. Sharing between five people, the burrata was a little bit underwhelming because I could usually eat one of those to myself but alas I learned to pace myself and was still tasty. The kale salad was a good start to the meal. Next we had three different pastas and the meatball, the ghocchi was spectacular and so was the meatball. I could give or take the risotto but I think it's because it came up with so much other richness at the same time. The bucatini was good and I would order that on it's own on a normal night out.We had the trout, duck, and the chicken after. The chicken was as good as everyone says it is - I think there was five spice in it which gave it some asian flavor and it was incredibly juicy and delicious. The duck was also a highlight of the meal. We had the apple tarte and chocolate budino - go for the chocolate.

If you don't have coke, just let us know before bringing the opened bottle of flat liquids. Thanks. Ordered fried eggs w sausage- the eggs were completely cooked through. That's a huge bummer. Can't mess eggs up. Especially for that NYC brunch pricing. The sausage was super flavorful so that made up for it. But overall not the most filling nice. HOWEVER, The setting was really nice with the open windows, and they were super accommodating when the other people in our party arrived.

171,pz3Ulbuk7ZiUUbT7oFzmpA,Lori L.,3.0 star rating,"Barbuto, translated from Italian, means ""bearded"", a nod to the relaxed, unfussy cuisine that Chef Jonathan Waxman wanted to serve at his restaurant [1]. At first glance, it's a step down from the likes of Chez Panisse and Washington Park, where Waxman began and built up his culinary career, but has a charm of its own. Located in what used to be a car garage along a quieter street in West Village, Barbuto has served up rustic Italian fare to guests for just over a decade, a tenure that few restaurants in NYC see nowadays. I had long wanted to visit this restaurant and try the much-lauded dishes, and when a few like-minded friends were willing to go, a reservation was all that was needed to seal the deal.It's hard to miss Barbuto at first sight; what other restaurants are distinguished by the line of garage doors around the venue's perimeter? In warmer weather, the doors are rolled back and allow for a breezy, airy feel to permeate throughout the otherwise enclosed venue. Be warned: when the garage doors are down and the restaurant is packed, the clamor can be quite the audial barrage, to say the least; look elsewhere for a quieter meal if you don't want to shout over your companions. I was the first to arrive and was promptly seated, despite the fact that my friends were running late; once they arrived, we started going through a few dishes we wanted to try and decided to share them among the group.We started off with a few Antipasti. The Insalata Cavolo took a base of black-leaf kale and garnished it with pecorino, bread crumbs, and a light anchovy dressing reminiscent of Caesar. It was a light, albeit slightly bitter, start to the meal, although I was fonder of the Bruschetta with Duck Liver. The bread was lightly buttered and toasted, so that it was a contrast in temperature and texture to the generous spread of duck liver on top. The pickled rhubarb on top was a crucial component, though, as the richness of the liver needed to be cut with a little acidity and crunch.And then, a few Primi followed. The Bucatini alla Carbonara featured the spaghetti-like pasta tossed in the traditional cheese and egg-based sauce. With the addition of diced pancetta and black pepper, it was a very simple but tasty dish; a little creaminess, a meatiness from the pancetta, and some spice from the crushed black pepper were the perfect complements to the plate. I was surprised by how much I liked the Gnocchi as well. A simple olive-oil based sauce as well as a few shavings of parmesan were all that were needed to highlight the pillowy pasta.Of course, we couldn't leave without trying the Pollo Al Forno, the famed Roasted Chicken. It's done very simply at Barbuto; after being roasted in the wood-burning oven, it's topped with an Italian salsa verde, and promptly served so it's still steaming warm. The chicken was a little disappointing; the lack of a crisp, savory skin as well as the surprisingly dry, sinewy white meat made it pale in comparison to numerous other roast chickens I've had in the city. The salsa verde, an aromatic concoction that doesn't hold back on the basil and parsley, couldn't make up for the (rather significant) deficiencies in the protein.Perhaps the roast chicken has been overhyped, as many dishes in NYC are prone to be, or perhaps the last ten years have incurred an oversight in the care placed into Barbuto's signature dish. Nonetheless, the quality of the other plates offered was a saving grace and would be the only reason I would return to the restaurant, preferably on an evening when the garage doors are still rolled up.--[1] It's also a nod to a beloved canine of Chef Waxman's, and also explains the image of a dog's head on the menu header.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

But the steak, which had to be sent back because it came back overdone, sat in a pool of olive oil and roasted peppers was bland and rubbery.

176,0zmI26k_pyxZhdHZ7nIPIg,L M.,4.0 star rating,"I went to Barbuto on a Friday night and dined solo at the bar. I went early - around 6:00pm so I could grab a bar seat and in glad I did. By 6:30ish the bar was pretty full and certainly by the time I was done eating, it was packed. The restaurant has a buzzy scene - which I liked. It seemed like a nice mix of locals and out of towners without feeling touristy at all. The space is a converted garage and they open up the doors when the weather is nice giving it an indoor/outdoor feeling.The bartenders were great. They were super busy but still very attentive. I had a vodka drink with rosemary in it that was really good and then a half carafe of white wine with my dinner. So, for dinner I had the kale salad and the roasted chicken with salsa verde. Both are very famous dishes at Barbuto. The kale salad was amazing! Simple, but so well done (why can't I make a good kale salad???!). It is mixed with breadcrumbs and a simple, lemony vinaigrette. The kale was soft and melted in your mouth. Really fantastic! And it was a great pairing with the chicken. The chicken was . . . decent. I feel kind of sacrilege saying that, but I guess I was looking for more considering everyone says this is THE DISH to get when you're there. Don't get me wrong, it was really good, but it's a simple plate of roasted chicken. Maybe that's the appeal in and of itself? The salsa verde was a lovely herby accompaniment and the chicken sits in a bed of light oil (very light and really adds to the dish). The chicken was cooked well, crispy skin and tender on the inside. I enjoyed the dish and it was well-executed, I've just had better (the chicken for two at Marc Forgione immediately comes to mind). Anyways, I had a great dining experience here - particularly for someone who was solo for the night. Great bar service and really solid food.

We were told the wait would be 1.5 hours, but ended up being seated after only a 30 minute wait at the bar....anyway, on to the food....- For appetizers we got the olives, Kale salad and the calamari. The kale salad was HUGE and far bigger than any appetizer salad I've ever had. I was fearful of the anchovies, but honestly you don't even  see them and it was very tasty. The calamari was even better, and refreshingly bright and acidic in a way that fried calamari hardly ever manages to achieve- For entrees my date got the steak and I got the famous JW chicken. We were both quite happy with our dishes. The chicken (as heralded) is very good, yet also gigantic, so like the salad I had enough for lunch the following day. We also ordered the side of rosemary potatoes, which were delicious, crispy and hot, but far too much food!As for drinks I found both the JW margarita and the daiquiri to be underwhelming, though the daiquiri was fine enough for me to get a second.

We began with a glass of Riesling and a Stagio Bellini, both enjoyable. We shared the salad with frisee and English pea, and it was enough for two as a starter. For a main course, I chose the signature JW chicken, 1//2 a fryer sized chicken, perfectly roasted with crisp skin, juicy breast and no pink or red in the joints of the dark meat. It could not have been cooked any better. The salsa verde and puddle of olive oil in which it sat were also delicious. At $18, my wife's pizza con uovo seemed pricey for the size, but it was filling and absolutely savory. I barely got a taste.I added an order of kale and escarole when I saw the chicken was unaccompanied. This was expedited by our wonderful server Katy. It might be too peppery for some tastes, but I enjoyed it.No room for dessert.The only cons: Some bread for dunking would have been nice, and would seem appropriate with a salad.

Third mistake was to sit next to the open kitchen, which gave us a great view of the busy chefs and the one newbie sous chef that just diddled around the whole night, because it made us quite hot.Onto the food: Pollo al Forno-  nicely executed but too salty, trout entree - well cooked but too salty, amazingly crispy fried potatoes - but they were too salty (starting to see a theme here?).  The bright spot was the app - out of this world Bruschetta w mushrooms and cheese.  This meal is a fail due to the misleading hype and the fact that I paid too much to eat a bunch of salty dishes.

Since I don't live or work in the city, reservations for a weekend were nearly impossible to come by. I finally used the holiday break wisely, and made a cozy lunch reservation for 2 to celebrate a friends birthday (who just so happens to love roast chicken). The afternoon was rainy but, we were so excited, we jumped through all the puddles en route. Rose was our drink of choice and we started off with the Kale Salad (insalata di cavolo). The salad was light and refreshing, loved the crunch from the breadcrumbs. I only wish the kale had been dressed a little longer, because it was still a little tough. Regardless, good start. We then shared the Pollo Al Forno, since you HAVE to, and the Bucatini alla Carbonara. There are no words to express what my taste buds felt when I bit into this chicken. It's so juicy and flavorful, anyone would debate eating the entire plate by themselves. It is no wonder this is Chef Waxman's signature. My friend and I both agreed, the carbonara was heavy on the pepper however, that didn't stop us from eating the entire bowl. I had really high expectations before coming and everything aside from the chicken, fell a little short in my eyes. I loved the rustic/industrial feel of the space and how you can see a little bit of the kitchen. The service was also above par. I think I would come back, just to try a few things other things on the menu but I'm in no rush to do so.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"
217,WrVRNjvf8yLeF3361qXCxw,Lawrence H.,2.0 star rating,"Jonathan Waxman, you disappoint me. A comforting staple of the West Village, Barbuto has been around for years, serving simple roasted chicken and rustic Italian cuisine. For years, I had dining companions challenging me to try the roast chicken at Barbuto because I am a roast chicken fanatic, one that is nearly impossible to satisfy, one that has had the best and the worst and is as particular about juiciness of chicken meat as he is about the crispiness of the skin and the sourcing of the fowl.So I tried it one day. Barbuto serves you a quarter chicken, beautifully roasted, with crispy skin and tender meat. Two minor complaints: the breast is a little dryer than perfect but maybe they had an off night the time I went. The other fault  was that the plate was slightly stark naked, only holding a few chicken pieces and a skimpy sauce. The roast chicken at Houseman or Locanda Verde are probably superior, but this one does some justice.The chicken was the highlight of the dinner as the other dishes paled in comparison. I tried two pastas, and both were horribly underdone even though I prefer al dente noodles. One was drowning in cheese. I also had a side of broccoli -- basically a plate of barely cooked broccoli with no sauce. I could've fed it to a raw vegan happily.PROS:Pretty good chicken, but not the bestLocated in a fun neighborhoodCONS:Underdone pastasA bit of a hike from the subwayPricey for the quality of foodBoring menu",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

The Food:There were three of us (myself and two girls) the other night and we ordered a ton of food, perhaps a bit much as we didn't realize the portions were larger than average for NYC.  We ordered the Salumi which was a great selection of cured meats.  The best of which were the salami and prosciutto.  This plate was served with toast and crackers (nice touch).  We paired this with the two cheese selection of which we got the buffalo and pecorino (the buffalo cheese was an amazing soft cheese, whose texture was somewhat reminiscent of brie but much tastier).The bruschetta was not your standard tomato on toast but a thicker spread which went very well with the garlic toast it was on.  Oh my, the potato dish was fabulous, perfectly crispy on the outside and soft/flaky on the inside, perfect side dish for the roasted chicken we got.The gnocchi dish was 50/50.  The great part was that the consistency of the gnocchi was on point, tasted home made; whereas the mushroom sauce left a little to be desired.  I would have preferred a stronger mushroom taste, perhaps some kind of truffle flavoring would have gone better.The Drinks:We ended up splurging and having a couple bottles of the pinot noir.  However, this place has a pretty nice selection of wines by the glass to satisfy whatever dish you're having.  We also got a sambuca to go with our dessert.The Atmosphere:I've been to this place during warm days and it's great when they open up the garage doors.  They also have a private room if you're trying to host a birthday dinner or other group event.The Service:Spot on!  The waiter gave some great recommendations and was fairly attentive but not annoying.  Optimal!Suggestions:Salumi and two cheese selection, bomb.  You cannot go wrong.  I also wouldn't order as much food as we did unless you are Starvin Marvin.  This place gives you your money's worth.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

The most memorable dish was a salad with apples tossed with lemon and olive oil (as per the waiter).Everything else was either forgettable or being done better somewhere else.I tried the risotto, the Pasta Ragu, gnocchi, chicken & hanger steak.Risotto: Was cooked nicely but a dish that is almost exclusively a comfort food has a bite here with some acid. Wouldn't order it again.The pasta in the Ragu was AL-DENT-AYYY!! I like my pasta al dente but this was borderline inedible. As close to sending back a dish as I have been in a long time. We cut though the pasta with a knife and you could still see the white of the uncooked pasta on the ends of the cut. Wouldn't order it again.Gnocchi- was the best of the pastas and the onions were nice. Could be in the mood for it if hard pressed to choose a pasta here.The chicken that everyone raves about was OK. The skin had great flavor. It was cooked well but once again, I don't know what the big deal is. I know this dish has received high acclaim from both diners and other chefs but it was average. Both Avoce & Bread and Tulips do it better.The Hanger steak was cooked perfectly and had a nice flavor.  Would have made a nice steak sandwich.

Unfortunately the wait for a table can be very long so we sat outside which was tolerable with the heat coming through the doors. When they were later closed, it was less so. Service was good though the main courses took a long time to come and there were a few periods when a drink wasn't refreshed for a noticeable time. The menu is Italian based with lots of salads, pasta, and meaty entrees but there are some new style inventive takes like squid ink pasta and goat with squash. The menu also changes fairly often based on seasonal ingredients which was nice with some pumpkin and butternut squash dishes in the fall. The squid ink risotto with shrimp was delicious with a healthy dose of garlic and succulent shrimp. The roasted chicken is a perpetual draw here and you can see them cooking it in the brick oven. The skin is delicious and the meat is succulent though the portion is so big it got a little much of the same flavor. The goat with squash my delicious with a slight Indian flavor but not a lot of spice it was on the heavy side but the portion was fairly small so it worked out ok.

I want to make sure to mention that the support staff (runners, bussers) were outstanding. We never needed water, and never had to look far to ask for something. Our server didn't help us navigate the menu well, and wasn't very present. He talked around the menu (""nothing is necessarily better than anything else, it's just different"") and didn't give any helpful descriptions of anything when we asked about particular dishes. That aside, we loved what we did order.

Strike 1.  So they jam us in the corner after giving away a better seat to the people who came after us.  Server comes over, we're ready for drinks and antipasto but still deciding on the main course.  ""Oh sorry we have to put in the entire order at once.""  Seriously?  Do we have a personal chef who makes our entire order at the same time?  How stupid.  But fine, we had to wait forever for the server to come back to place the order.So now the antipasto comes out, a kale salad and some of their cheeses.  The meats were absolutely fantastic 5/5, the highlight of an otherwise annoying meal.  The cheeses were OK but didn't compare to the meats, 3/5 perhaps.  The kale salad was lackluster even as far as kale goes, 2/5.The wine comes out, for $15 bucks the all-too-small pour had better be amazing.  Sadly, it was not.  After my wine glass was empty for 20 minutes the server finally noticed and I got a tuscan wine that was better but not noteworthy, especially considering the prices.So the main courses come out, we got the 'signature' chicken and the pork loin.  The pork loin was fine, lacked any real flavor, but wasn't bad no sides really so we also got some overcooked potato thing that wasn't very good.Now onto the chicken... which can only be described as on par with the cornish hens you get at Medieval Times!  Alas, I waited for the Knights to come out on horseback but it was not to be.  So fail on that as well.  Strike 2.All the while we dealt with spotty service, empty water glasses and empty wine glasses were a common theme.  I know its busy but at least keep the water glasses from being empty for 15 minute spans.  Strike 3!The only way I would come back here would be for the cured meat board at a slow time where we could get a table outside and even then, I'd have to be pressed.Fail, this one is overrated.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

Of course I got the famous bolognese. Of course I got the much raved about ""best potatoes in the world"" potatoes. Desserts were what desserts should be, simple, sweet, made with love.

We were fans of Jonathan Waxman from ""Top Chef Masters"" and saw that his restaurant, Barbuto, would be the best for our visit!We arrived around 6pm, giving us plenty of time to dine before the dinner rush and before heading to a Broadway show. It wasn't crowded so we were seated right away, at the edge of the open air space where we enjoyed some people watching. There are some enclosed private rooms and indoor seating, but being in the patio allowed us to enjoy the summer evening.Our waitress was very friendly and gave good drink recommendations - my husband had the Jack Hammer Pinot Noir and I had the Prosecco. A complimentary bowl (and offal bowl) of different kinds of olives were served first. My husband ordered the POLLO AL FORNO (roasted chicken with salsa verde). The dish was flavorful and the salsa verde isn't the latin style we thought it would be - it was more of a pureed topping of fresh herbs. I had the CAPPA SANTE (sea scallops, corn, scallions). The scallops were cooked perfectly, without the overpowering ocean taste. The corn and scallions complimented each other and the bed of creamed polenta gave the dish a nice smooth texture.Along with the delicious meals, I appreciated the casual-but-nice ambiance and versatility of this restaurant.

The host was very unfriendly and the food was maybe just ok at best.  But when you spend the kind of prices in a place that looks and is a garage I can't believe I paid over $400 for the food I got. Gnocchi vegetarian plate $20 dollars. You guys must be high not only on price but in your brain. And that the only home made pasta they had. The worst gnocchi I ever had Then you got to place all your order in at once. I mean from apps to first and second plate. (Very wrong)  Then when we ordered first and second plates the did bring it in 2 separate times.  Ok I get that. But if I'm ordering just a first plate and not a second. Don't you think I will like to eat it when everyone else gets the second and last plate so we can eat all together. You idiots.  That's was my first time that it happened to me. The chicken was supposedly the best thing on the menu. It a bit dry.  The duck was the best thing I tried. Very tender and good.  The cod was salty that you couldn't eat it. I still can't Believe the amount of money I spent for what a got. A total rip off!!!!    And what surprised me was how rude the hostes  was. Congrats on getting on my shit list. My reviews are viewed  by and average 20k yelpers every 90 days. I do not recommend this restaurant. Forget about the service from the hostes. The server was  nice.

The way he talked about food and creating a perfect three course meal really fooled me into thinking he knew what he was doing. We started the meal off with salumi which was standard. We ordered the Bruschetta with Tuna, which is seasonal. Looking at the website it seems that during other seasons, he serves bruschetta with duck liver or cannellini bean & pine nut purée. All I can say is that those options sound much tastier than the tuna that I was served. It was less than mediocre and very disappointing coming from such a renown chef. For the main, I got the pollo al forno. The salsa verde lived up to its name but the chicken was really not memorable. It wasn't neither succulent, nor juicy and it completely relied on the salsa verde to mask its short comings. My girlfriend ordered the gnocchi con salsiccia. This was a very generous portion but it did not need to be. The potato dumplings are very heavy to begin with so there was no way she, or I for that matter, could have finished the entire plate of gnocchi. The taste wasn't anything special.

First I want to say that I never write yelp reviews and I work in the service industry and know the politics of it all. But, I do have to say that I ate here after pride with three friends after having eaten here for the past three years after the pride parade and this year there was a marked difference in the amount of food that was plated. I understand the prices being a bit elevated because of where it is in Manhattan. I manage a fine dining restaurant and understand the system of pricing to location and atmosphere in addition to food quality. But I have to say that I was saddened by the small portions that I was served this evening. This used to be a place that cared about feeding their customers. And despite the food being delicious tonight, I felt as though I was not fed properly. we spent over $200 and left hungry. I think that the people who now live in live in this area probably wouldn't sneeze at the prices, but there are those of us who used to come here and treat ourselves a few times a year, and we've officially been priced out.

Now, dont get me wrong, the chicken and carbonara are good but the carbonara was a little too heavy on the pepper and the i could only take a few bites of the chicken before i started to be over the flavor.

Unfortunately, our experience last night was awful and I don't plan to go back anytime soon, if at all. The restaurant had the side garage door open last night - the temperature was about 50 degrees out. We did not dress for the weather as we did not plan to eat outside on such a cold night. Half of the restaurant was wearing jackets and the other half was shivering. To spend so much money on dinner and have to shiver through it is unacceptable. We were told that the reason the garage door was open was so that servers could access the one table sitting outside. It seems silly that they would inconvenience their paying customers so that their servers wouldn't have to walk out through the front door.The food was pretty good, although the Tagliatelle dish was very, very small.

They brush you off. They clearly do not value the locals and rely on the tourists and people who travel from other parts of the city. There are so many other great places to eat in the West Village.

And great food is around the corner at another spot that is more pleasing. I prefer to praise and value a restaurant.

My plan was to walk the High Line then go back to Barbuto for lunch. We passed some other nice restaurants along the way but I really wanted to try Barbuto. It may of been because it was so open, meaning that they raised the walls of the restaurant so the whole interior was exposed. It was great. I doubt this is this case right now since it is getting colder and winter is around the corner. Definitely eat here on a nice spring or summer day to enjoy the outdoor dining experience. Other than the esthetics and atmosphere, the food was fantastic. I had the gnocchi con granoturco with corn& cherry tomatoes. I love gnocchi, so I had to have this.

Tucked away in the West Village, I was initially excited to try this well-reviewed spot. Unfortunately, I left feeling like I had wasted money. Here are some of my thoughts on the experience:- Stereotypical hipster service- Very extensive wine selection, but very limited beer choices- Unique and appealing atmosphere; definitely a big selling point- The diced calamari was delicious, but the menu does not sufficiently describe the dish and the server (hipster #1) failed to walk us through the choices sufficiently- The Pollo Al Forno (which was all the hype on Yelp) was bland and lacking flavor; MAJOR disappointment - The potatoes (I don't recall the exact name, but they were one of the side dish selections) were really good!

For entrees, I got the bucatini which came in a MASSIVE bowl.  This thing probably had 3-4 servings of pasta.  I was expecting a nice runny yolk on top but was lost to find the egg at all--maybe it's in the sauce? The pasta was cooked perfectly and had a good kick of pepper, but with that much pasta it got mundane after a few bites.  My boyfriend had the chicken which had a nice crispy skin, but, again, it was just A LOT of food, with no side on the plate (you have to order separately).  So on to sides, the broccoli rabe was fine and the potatoes were burnt to little crisps--don't get all the positive reviews since we could barely taste potato among the crumbs.Overall, the portions are huge but have no accompaniments.  While good in flavor, after a few bites it gets boring.  If you do get the sides, don't expect them to wow--they were just ok.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

The Trout was just ok, the steak was requested at mid-rare and it was definitely underdone with a cold red center. The biggest draw back of this place is the noise level.

Summer corn/zuchhini and italian sweet sausage/kale are some of the seasonal gnochhi's. For dinner I would do the Chicken (can easily be split between 2 people) and an order of the potatoes.

Came for Sunday brunch with my parents. Started with a sangria, a half full glass, half of which was ice. Basically an extremely watered down and bitter tasting drink. I ordered the corn on the cob, which arrived cold, with a smear of the paprika aioli. I am a big fan of elote or the Mexican corn on the cob. This was a sad attempt, and not only lacked heat but also flavor. Of course, I ordered the famous chicken. And I will say that it was good, cooked very well, with a thin and crispy skin, seasoned well with salt and pepper. The Italian salsa verde was pretty good as well. However, it was very crudely done. It's just half a chicken cut into pieces, piled on your plate. I go to restaurants for taste and presentation. And while I enjoy eating with my hands, I'll leave that for wings at Hooters and Medieval Times. I wasn't a fan of the crispy potatoes at all, they were very fried and very boring in flavor - tasted like something I'd buy in the hot foods section a supermarket.  I will admit that I did not sample a lot of the menu item and I am only reviewing brunch, but overall, it was a disappointing experience and I don't have any desire to give it another chance.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

Dark with candles, loud, garage doors open to the street, and cool evening June breezes sneaking in. We split a salami plate, and I had the gnocchi, which was how it should be. Soft, but with the slight char to the outside, a nice buttery sauce with subtle lemon. The waitress was nice, but twice over-poured from our Prosecco bottle, spilling on the table. She did apologize, told us she had been working 12 hours straight, and gave us complimentary refills to compensate. The down side, however, is the location. It's in the West Village, but definitely starting to get closer to the Meatpacking District.

The linguine with shrimp had a nice zest to it with the lemon butter sauce and massive amount of garlic. The jalapeños were a bit more spice for my own taste so I declined to eat them. But overall this dish is delicious and very flavorful. The JW pollo al Forno was ok. Like other reviewers, I probably would have wanted crispier skin, but the patate totally made up for it.

We thought he was just kidding, but seriously they don't provide ketchup.  Had a group brunch on Sunday. We ordered several dishes and shared together. - Pollo Al Forno: roasted half-chicken, nothing special. Yes, chicken breast was very tender, but chicken is just chicken. Don't expect any materially special taste out of this dish.   - Pizza Uovo: thin pizza with oven baked eggs and pancetta. It was okay, but I thought pizza with mushroom and oven baked eggs at ABC Kitchen was so much better than this.- Bucatini Alla Carbonara: was okay too.- Insalata Cavolo: kale salad with raisins and almonds. This was my favorite out of all the dishes that we had that day. Cocktails? $14 per glass but so disappointed. We tried a glass of hot rum with honey, Salty Dog (vodka with grapefruit juice), and classic bloody marry, but none of them was good. I still don't get why this place is rated at 4 stars.

I'm glad to know that Barbuto has stood the test of time.  Most recently we shared a rather large dinner of 14 at the chef's table, we took the 9pm reservation although we were able to sit earlier around 8:15.  This is the second time we've done the chef's table and it's an awesome experience, just be aware that the heat from the kitchen can be pretty intense and I wouldn't exactly call it a private room, just a separate space.  Regardless, we shut the place down at 12:30am when the staff subtly switched on the house lights.The food is northern Italian, hearty and soulful.  I'd skip lunch and leave room for this dinner because you don't want to find yourself full when they finally serve the steak.  I enjoyed the pasta the most but nothing missed the mark.  Paired with a bold Italian red, I'd call the whole evening an indulgent affair.  My only slight issue with the restaurant itself is that, at the risk of sounding like my grandmother, it's seriously really loud.  Not sure what they can do here, maybe it goes with the Italian theme.  The real reason for 4 stars instead of 5, though, is that for some reason everyone here was quite old.  I've been living outside New York for four years now and I heard that everyone under 35 is now in Brooklyn, so I guess it's a sign of the times.This is an old favorite that I hope sticks around for years to come.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

We were lucky enough to get a 6:45pm Wednesday reservation for 4 people the day before, and the odds couldn't have been more in our favor.After extensively going through our possible menu selections, we decided to splurge and go for the $65 chef's family prix fixe menu. Our waitress highly recommended it, saying it was a four-course meal and that it was a lot of food. Talk about an understatement.We started off with a beautiful charcuterie plate, along with a romaine salad, calamari  salad, and an asparagus antipasti. After having a pastrami from Katz earlier in the day, it was a nice change having light proteins and crisp, seasonal vegetables to start off the meal. The winner if we had to pick one: calamari salad.For our primi courses, we got the gnocchi and shrimp linguitini, which were two dishes we were actually looking at before selecting the prix fixe menu. Both were al dente beyond perfection and had a slight spice to them, adding an extra kick. It's hard to rank the two, but if I had to choose one over the other, it would have to be the linguitini.For our secondi courses, we got the Jonathan Waxman chicken, grilled fish, and the roasted pork loin, accompanied by the boiled-then-roasted potatoes and braised kale and escarole salads. Everything was seasoned and cooked to the right temperature, though the chicken really was the star of the meal. I hate using hashtags where hashtags do not apply, but it really was the #winnerwinnerchickendinner.At this point we had reached our satiation level, yet we were welcomed with a rich dark chocolate mousse, topped with mascarpone and a biscotti.

I would have never picked this place myself for an intimate birthday dinner, but I'm glad the decision wasn't up to me. I was more than wow-ed. First off, the ambiance is the perfect mix of sensual and fancy. It has a calming effect. I immediately lowered my voice and snuggled up to my date because the place made me feel that cozy (And this was before the wine!). I love the exposed brick and open windows. I even caught myself telling my date, ""I hope  to have exposed brick like this one day in my dream kitchen."" I can't wait to experience this place when they're actually open on a too-hot Spring day. The food-- I've heard so many great things about it and wanted to judge for myself. The kale salad was one of the best dishes I had all night. Mind you-- I didn't even order the Kale, my date did but dammit if I didn't steal it from him! (Sorry boo!) The truth is, that my mussels-- while fresh and succulent, didn't stand up to the tangy and just perfectly salted pecorino Kale salad. I've tried to recreate this salad several times since leaving Barbuto, and while I haven't nailed it at least it got me eating raw Kale.My Hanger Steak-- yum, yum, and YUM! I loved it along with the sauteed greens and root vegetables we ordered. I heard the chicken here is a must have and I think my date would agree that they have superb chicken. As a red meat junkie, I wouldn't know. Although, I'm happy to report that Barbuto does not fail where red and white meat is concerned.

The gnocchi itself was perfect - slightly crispy on the outside - and the sauce, made with fresh seasonal corn, heirloom tomatoes, and basil, was simply mouthwatering. Totally worth the $19, especially since it was a decent portion.My friend ordered the charred eggplant dish (also seasonal I believe) and that too was yummy. It's a real delight when restaurants not only offer multiple vegetarian options, but also execute them beautifully.In addition to the above, I also highly recommend the patate side dish ($8) - wonderfully fried potatoes that were sprinkled with pecorino and topped with a whole sprig of aromatic rosemary - delish!Service was great too, although my one slight gripe is that we weren't given any bread to nosh on while we waited for our food (although we did get some delicious marinated olives!).Super cute and with awesome open air dining, Barbuto is definitely my new #1 summer spot.Kudos to you Jonathan Waxman.----------------------------------------------One comment if anyone from Barbuto is reading this: I absolutely love that you change your menu daily based on seasonality of ingredients, but since a lot of people, like myself, like picking what we're going to order in advance, would you be able to post a daily menu on your website?

It has long been a neighhood favorite destination known particularly for the famous chicken dish. The restaurant has long been on my radar, and I finally paid a visit. I was very impressed with the quality of rustic Italian dishes that this restaurant was producing. Suffice to say it wasn't just about the chicken dish.I started my meal with wild mushroom salad with frisee, hazelnuts and poached egg. I was just looking for a light and refreshing dish to get the meal going, but this salad turned out to be a lot better than expected, with excellent flavor of mushroom combined with the poached egg. I proceeded to try two pasta dishes: bucatini alla carbonara (with pancetta, black pepper and farm egg) and gnocchi con radici (with root vegetables, Calabrian chili and parmesan). I was very impressed with both dishes, too. Bucatini's spicy kick from the black pepper was addictive, and although not a huge fan of gnocchi in general, this gnocchi dish was really delicious, with excellent texture (not overly soft). Obviously, I had to go with the famous chicken and salsa verde dish. The dish was very good with the right balance of flavor and tenderness (definitely lives up to its hype), but based on my trips for notable chicken dishes around the city, I wouldn't call Barbuto's chicken dish the very best. I was pretty stuffed by the end of my meal, but decided to share a dessert of semifreddo sundae, which was just alright. The restaurant's decor is quite minimalist, but the charming neighborhood vibe is definitely there. It gets a little loud toward the middle of the night, but not on an unbearable level. The restaurant has a full bar with some nice wine options. Getting a reservation could be challenging (the restaurant takes reservations of parties of three or more only), but the restaurant sets aside walk-in tables for parties of two so show up early if you don't have reservations. Barbuto is an excellent Italian restaurant in a perfect neighborhood setting, so I highly recommend a visit here for a casual night out with friends or a date in the area on the border between West Village and Meatpacking District.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

I had the Bethesda cocktail, some sort of herbal and citrus drink that was perfect for a hot summer night. To eat, I had a salad off the antipasti menu - the insalata di cavolo, which was really just a glorified caesar salad (again, typically a much more adventurous eater but was on a first (blind) date and it was unseasonably muggy and warm, spare me).

I really don't understand what all of the hype is about. First two starters hit the table before our drinks arrived. When the drinks made it (my husband and I both ordered the mezcal cocktail- $18), they tasted primarily like water, then tequila, with a hint of peach. You know when you're at the bottom of the glass and you decide to go in for one last diluted sip? That was what the whole drink tasted like. I asked if the bartender could remake them, thinking it must have been an accident. Nope. They both came back more watery and flavorless than the first two. I never drank mine, but no one asked if it was better, etc. To be fair, they were very busy. However, if your cocktail pricing is on par with NoMad and other top bars in the city and you deliver something that would put the most average happy hour establishment to shame, it's a problem. The chicken was good, if a bit under-seasoned and slightly on the drier side. The pork tagliatelle was definitely the best dish of them all. The gnocchi were nice, but heavy on the flour and swimming in butter.

I'm with Time Out on this one. Maybe because they converted a huge car garage, buffed the concrete floors, and staffed it with equally buffed waiters in tight black T-shirts, it feels tilted a bit more toward California than Manhattan. The food also veers west in a back-to-basics way. But the Manhattan side comes out in the heaping portions of comfort food played out with an undeniably neo-Italian flair. It was also so frickin' cold last week that this San Franciscan was just happy the massive garage doors were rolled shut for the evening. Voices echoed pretty loudly for most of the evening, especially the boisterous group of white-collar mob types at the next table. But it moved to a dull roar when my friend Carlos and I got down to business. He went for the $13 Insalata Mista which was a nice pile of bitter mixed greens and frisee with red onions (see my photo). I went for a more audacious concoction, the $12 Bruschetta Con Barbabieto, a thick wedge of baguette piled high with diced beets slathered in a black pepper marscapone as it all sat on a bed of warm endive (see my photo). Even though it was impossible to pick up without the threat of a major-league stain, it was tasty. The salad was even better. The secondi courses (entrees) were hearty to say the least. At a relative bargain $19, the Pollo al Forno, three huge pieces of roasted chicken served with salsa verde, was incredible, very juicy and tender with a nice crust to the skin. The $27 Abbacchio di Maiale was really a nice osso bucco but instead of polenta, the succulent lamb shank rested on a bed of soft-crisp chunks of sweet apples. It was a wonderful sweet-savory combination. Our stellar sides were the $8 Cavolini (roasted baby brussel sprouts, halved and served with bits of pancetta - see my photo) and the $8 Patate (pan-fried fingerling potatoes with rosemary and sage). We ended our meal with a perfectly flaky $8 Crostata with a scoop of vanilla ice cream (see my photo). I was quite stuffed at this point in the meal and just wanted the scoop of Pomegranate Granita since it sounded refreshing. When the waiter offered a free taste, it came in a generous coffee cup (see my photo). That turned out to be enough for me, but the waiter insisted I get an even bigger cupful as a chaser. He was nice enough to give it to me for free.This is the kind of West Village bistro that really makes me wish I lived in New York...but then I walked back into the biting cold and promptly forgot that notion. By the way, Waxman's left coast eatery, the short-lived West County Grill in Sebastopol, closed in August due apparently to the star chef's neglect. That's a shame because I would have motored up there had I known it was there. FOOD - 5 stars...really hearty, tasty comfort food with a creative twist AMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...hip vibe ideal for the West Village set and even for California tourists like me...but awfully loud when it's at full buzz SERVICE - 5 stars...very attentive and helpful...nice shirt, bud TOTAL - 5 stars...comfort food supreme in a friendly, cool place...moderate prices...I'd like to come back in the summer with the garage doors rolled wide open",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

I had seen mouth watering pics of their cauliflower salad, carbonara,fettucini with mushrooms, and famous roasted chicken. I finally made it here and was shocked to find it was relatively empty and only a very short 15 min wait for a Saturday night. Granted, this was the Saturday before Christmas and maybe not a very busy time of year for restuarants. I was heart broken that many of the items I had been pinning for weren't on the menu that night. We ended up sharing the chicken, gnocchi with sausage, veggie lasagna, and a bruschetta to start. It was good, but not mild blowing good as I had expected. Nothing was bad, I just had such high expectations based on this huge cult following it has.

The kale was a bit overdressed for my liking but I still enjoyed it. The mains were buccatini carbonara and the JW chicken. The carbonara was good but is a pretty heavy dish for lunch. I'm glad I was sharing it. The JW chicken was the star of the meal. We normally never order chicken but we are glad we got it. It was tender and juicy. My wife was gushing over that chicken. Considering that we saw tons of it coming out of the kitchen, I guess most diners know that it is the reason to visit.

It was perfectly done, though a tad bit bland. Next time will definitely go for their chicken dish. We have the cheese plate, also delicious with a diverse selection of cheeses. We also got both the chocolate pudding and the chocolate cake. Next time would opt for the cake - it was rich and moist and topped by a phenomenal expression cream.

Definitely a cozy dish appropriate for dropping temperatures.Was it worth it? It's hard to assess objectively when ANYTHING as touted as ""The Best 'Insert Item Here' Ever"", but considering that chicken is usually the disfavored option on most dinner menus, I think Barbuto does a good job of skyrocketing it to a headliner position.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

Who knew such a simple food could taste so damn good! I was quite impressed by the food at Barbuto as a whole. We started with the brushetta, which is a different take on the typical tomato dish and instead is done with peas, ricotta and goat cheese. It's quite tasty. Even better than the brushetta was the insalata cavalo verde, kale done simply and to perfection with olive oil, lemon and anchovy flavoring. It was refreshing and delicious. I was also impressed by their wine list, which was very reasonable and had a lot of nice Italian selections. The dessert menu also added to me being a fan of Barbuto. Strawberry short cake? Yes please!The acoustics, as others have mentioned, do create some issues. We were there for an ""early bird special"" dinner* due to one of my friends catching a train back to Philly. The noise wasn't awful, but I could see it being bad later in the night, especially in the winter when the garage doors are not open. So for that reason I would suggest it for a group dinner not a date. Barbuto is perfect for the summer time with it's large garage doors opening for a wonderful partial al fresco dinning experience**. The menu is also very fresh and not overpowering with flavor or heaviness that is sometimes associated with Italian cooking. If you know anyone that loves roast chicken - bring them here! *Ummm please note - there is no special I just called it that because sitting down at 5:30pm made me feel really old**I must also mention this was also a wonderful dining experience because I ran into A-rod in an apartment building nearby after leaving Barbuto. He is waaaayyy more jacked in person than on TV or from the 400 level seats I can afford at Yankee stadium. Also by ""ran into"" I mean was close enough to reach out and squeeze his biceps.

The first time I was waiting for a bartender to serve me and even motioned for his attention and he basically ignored me until my married friend came and was very eager to serve her (they did not know each other). We were joining a group of friends so we stayed for dinner. Waiter service was better, but nothing to rave about (fortunately I had a good group of friends to distract me!) The 2nd time I visited Barbuto was on a Saturday night. I sat at the bar (same seats, ironically as the last time)I didn't care for my wine and told the bartender, very politely, that I just didn't care for it. Then, he says ok, and gives me another glass. I say, It tastes very sweet. His response, was that it's from grapes, and then he launches into a dialogue in which he explains to me what a super tuscan is (his explanation was wrong, btw). I refrained from admonishing this silly kid, because we've all been young and foolish, but I don't appreciate a 20-something bartender making flippant comments or talking to me so condescendingly. I, um, know how wine is made.  Then the  bartender walked away before I could respond. His colleague was normal and civilized and helped me from there on.It was late in the evening and this was the only easily accessible spot. I didn't stay to eat anything, nor did I finish the beer I ordered to replace the wine. I would avoid this place. You'll be treated better at the rowdy collegiate beer garden across the street. If you want a civilized dining experience with delicious food and wine, hit up the fig & olive. It is just down the road, the staff behaves themselves, and the food is delicious.

I had no idea when I walked in, but your many cookbooks lying around for sale, that large, illustrated football card self-portrait hanging above the entrance, and the number of times your name appeared on the menu had me thinking you must be kind of a big deal. Unfortunately your food made me think otherwise. Good:- Service: The hostesses and servers were all very friendly and attentive. - Wine: Decent selection of wines by the glass. I had a good Cortese di Gavi and great Pinot Noir from the Willamette Valley. Bad:- Noise: I get that NY restaurants are loud. Do you really need a table reeneacting that famous Righteous Brothers ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'"" scene from Top Gun though? It's entertaining but probably not necessary in an already loud restaurant.  - Food: -- In a very un-European fashion, we started with a cheese plate: chopped-up chunks of cheese, 2 small pieces of white bread and 3 breadsticks all tossed on a plate with the grace of a toddler. The cheese was tasty but where's the honey? Where are the cherry compote or even any interesting breads? How about some nuts? Damn it, I love nuts. -- Next up was what I think was supposed to be fried, bone-in pork belly with a saffron sauce. It looked pretty appetizing until my first cut had me wondering whether I was cutting bone or meat: so overcooked! The actual taste can only be described as salty saffron. Damn, I should have tried that JW* chicken!-- After that there was no desire to try the desserts. Maybe I was here on an off night, but JW*, if this is your flagship, you better step it up or people will think you've lost that lovin' feelin'.*Jonathan Waxman, obviously; in case you weren't quite sure after the many reminders here.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

But if you are a small party and didn't get there early in the evening be prepared for a long wait. The first time, we were there early on a Saturday night (before 6) and got seated right away. The second time we were there after 6 on a Saturday night and waited an hour. But the wait didn't diminish our enjoyment of the restaurant. (If you are stuck waiting, head to bookbook on Bleeker Street -- a friendly little independent bookstore.)For such a popular restaurant, the staff was exceptionally pleasant. We have been to trendy restaurants where the staff has a ""you're lucky you got in here"" attitude, which is off-putting when you're the one paying. At Barbuto, both times, our waitperson was friendly and professional. The food arrived promptly and the service was attentive throughout. Both visits, however, while we ordered completely different items with different waitstaff, we were congratulated each time on our excellent choices. It must be their training. The food was first-rate. We have tried several salads (kale, Brussels sprouts, escarole), and all were fabulous. I am particularly grateful for the light hand with the dressing, which allows you to taste the vegetables, too. For mains, we have had the roast chicken (of course), trout, monkfish and gnocchi -- all were excellent. We will keep trying new things, but would not be disappointed if we repeated. While the restaurant was busy during both visits, we did not feel rushed during our meal. We ended both with dessert and a pot of tea and left when we were ready to go.

461,fJJQ06l64bg3H6xnegbCug,Eric K.,5.0 star rating,"If you're thinking about Barbuto, chances are you've heard about Jonathan Waxman and his roast chicken. The legend of his roast chicken led me there one friday night...it also attracted a lot of other people there, creating about a one hour wait. There are things to do closeby during the one hour wait (a walk through the calmer side of meatpacking; Entwine; the crowded bar at Barbuto) so when our name was finally called, we were still in good spirits. The restaurant is loud but it's a good loud--part of it has to do with the airy, rustic space that allows you to relax (made even better when the garage walls are opened during nice weather). The open kitchen and the scent of roast chicken wafting throughout the room rounded out the atmosphere consisting of some nervous dates balanced out by more lively family and friend dinner conversations. En route to our seat, we glanced at the tables around us and each had ordered at least one roast chicken entree. Having finally tried Barbuto's roast chicken, I now understand the legend. It's a comfort food sized portion--one order is probably good for 2 people. More importantly, it's all about the chicken--there are no vegetables, decorations or sides on the plate trying to distract you; it's simply one of the tastiest roast chickens I've ever had. Crispy skin, juicy white and dark meat, and a chimichurri like sauce that's drizzled over the chicken that gives it even further depth of flavor. There are other dishes too. The gemelli w/ sausage and ricotta was a comforting dish that could rival any of the pastas of the rustic east village/alphabet city italian spots. Also, Barbuto's potato side is incredible--a very hearty portion of chunks of skin-on potato that look like they're roasted/fried. They're crispy/crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside and topped with rosemary and pecorino--a worthy complement to the roast chicken. With a bottle of bianco, a meal at Barbuto was therapeutic on a Friday after a long week of work.

One word: OVERRATED. Don't get me wrong, the food is by no means awful, or even bad for that matter, but it certainly doesn't live up to the expectations. We ordered the Salumi, stuffed meatball, potatoes, Brussels sprouts, gnocchi, and of course the acclaimed half chicken. Aside from the gnocchi and meatballs, I could've cooked all those things at home. (And that does not mean I enjoyed the gnocchi) the half chicken is good, but plain. Nothing special, and a pain in the ass to cut up and eat. Can't lie, the meatball was great. However the gnocchi was an attempt for extreme flavors that simply didn't go well together. Potatoes are oily, Fried potatoes (with very little potatoes). Salumi is an overpriced dish made up of cold meats (on a fancy wooden board) I could probably find at any deli in the neighborhood. Brussels sprouts were good, but I think that's just because everything else was so underwhelming. I mean, they were pretty simply sautéed Brussels sprouts, don't expect too much. To be quite frank, the Italian pudding was the saving grace of this otherwise sub par meal and the reason I gave it 3 stars.

489,h_PiLO8y_8JGd7QW1E4aBQ,G C.,5.0 star rating,"The roasted chicken is the real deal. I have to admit I never am one to order chicken while dining out because well... it's chicken. I can make a perfectly good chicken at home. This is definitely true, but I have to say this was probably the best roasted chicken I have ever had. Simple, yet extremely delicious. The skin was crackly crisp, which is definitely the hardest feat to accomplish. The meat stayed very juicy on the inside as well, although one of the pieces of the breast was a little dry- to be expected with chicken breast. The portion seems large, but honestly if you are hungry you can polish the whole thing off as I did. One thing to note is they are a little stingy with the salsa verde so ask for extra like me! Salsa verde was phenomenal as a condiment.The side of crispy potatoes was absolutely incredible! One of if not the best potatoes I have ever had. I believe they are poached first, then deep fried to perfection. This was the first time in awhile that I received potatoes extra crispy without me having to plead with the waiter to do so. I let Barbuto try to impress me and they did. Again, very simple but unbelievably delicious. The corn of the cob with parmiggiano and a chipotle like sauce was tasty, yet arrived to the table cold. I'm not sure if that was the intention but I bet if it was warmer it would have been great. I mean how can you go wrong with corn and parmiggiano cheese.One thing they lost points for is no bread. How do you operate a restaurant and only provide 5 olives? 99 percent of restaurants provide you with bread before the meal. I don't think you should have to request this- and even when I did it was not brought.Food was terrific and service was friendly but I will say that I asked for bread and butter while I waited and it was never brought. The waiter also seemed a little aloof at times and disappeared for long periods of time so it wasn't even like I could have asked him again. Maybe because it was lunch? But still the place was very empty.So there is a certain theme at Barbuto. They are just serving great, simple, comforting food in a relaxed space. Definitely a great place for lunch or a dinner with parents.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

For two people: I recommend ordering an order of the fantastic chicken, a half order of gnocchi, and a vegi dish - a perfectly balanced meal!

The waitress acted like I was the girl who bullied her throughout four years of high school and now here I was, sitting in her section. She would serve me because she had to, but she would NOT pretend to be happy about it. My napkin had more personality.Took about 15 minutes to come over and greet us. Did not say anything about the wait, did not say thanks or smile or do anything you might confuse with hospitality when we ordered. When she brought our beers, she plunked the bottles down silently and said absolutely nothing when I said 'thank-you'. I didn't dare ask for a glass, she'd probably take a swing at me.Luckily, we never saw her again. Some other guy came to ask how everything was, AFTER WE WERE FINISHED. What if we had needed or wanted something during the meal? Too bad for us, I guess. This guy had only slightly more personality than the girl, but still never said a 'thank-you' or 'you're welcome' throughout the dessert menu or check dropping exchanges. The busboy was delightful, though. It was almost like the servers had taken a vow of silence and it was up to the busboy to interpret their grunts. Food was decent.

I was so amazed by this appetizer i could not wait to find out what the rest of the meal was like : )Our entrees Merluzzo arrosto (roasted cod) and the Pollo al forno (roasted chicken) with salsa verde, were both delicious but this was not the highlight of the evening. The side order of their roasted brussel sprouts (cavolini) had this incredible crispy texture, drizzled with colatura (fish sauce), and a light dusting of crunchy hazelnuts was out of this world AMAZING!!!

521,axz70giIENWIacRXr-811A,Cecilia Z.,2.0 star rating,"Wow, what a letdown. I have long been a fan of Jonathan Waxman, so I naturally had pretty high expectations for Barbuto. Overall I was left very underwhelmed by the ambiance, service, and food. The bf and I came here for dinner on a Friday evening. My first impression of the restaurant was that it looked old and worn-down, and not in that intentionally rustic kind of way. The cheap chairs were also very shoddy and uncomfortable, which makes the dining room way too casual in an almost shabby way in my opinion. Not to mention that the bathrooms looked like ones you'd find behind a dive bar, not some highly rated neighborhood Italian restaurant with a renowned chef at its helms. I also hated sitting by the converted garage door as the cold winter air was totally seeping inside; come on, no one wants to wear their coat during dinner. What the fuck. Unfortunately, service was just as dreadful. Our waiter was inattentive and the timing of our dishes was slow to say the least.  As for the food, there were definite highs and lows. Highs included the oh-so-popular jw roast chicken, which was undeniably juicy down to the chicken breast. I liked the green sauce which had a nice mixture of different herbs. The fried potato side dish was good as well, nicely crispy on the outside with creamy interior. Lows included the calamari fritti we ordered as a starter - it was overcooked to the point of death. Not only was the thinly sliced calamari rubbery and tough, but the breading actually tasted stale, as if it were cooked in advanced and just microwaved. The dish was so inedible that I had to send it back (which I seldom do at restaurants), and our inept waiter certainly wasn't apologetic or even seemed to care about our dissatisfaction with the dish. We ended up ordering the pappardelle with oxtail ragu to replace the disgusting calamari dish, which we ended up paying for at the end. I was so utterly disappointed after finishing our entrees that I was unwilling to stay any longer for desserts. Instead the bf and I headed over to L'Artusi to have some desserts, cheese and wine at their bar. Lesson learned: when craving Italian, choose L'Artusi above all else.All in all, I just don't care to visit restaurants that don't care about their patrons. I understand that Barbuto is a very popular restaurant that probably doesn't have to worry about not having customers on any given night, but I certainly will not be coming back.

Enjoyed the carbonara and the chicken (which the server recommended as a popular dish) was excellent.

Their location is again wonderful, i went in a rainy weekend afternoon - do not remember whether it was saturday or sunday - but the place was really warm and welcoming. They have open kitchen and you have a very good and hard time choosing between great items on their menu. Their margarita pizza is great. Though, i can not say the same about their pollo al forno chicken dish, which was more than okay but i was expecting something extraordinarily amazing because there is an ongoing buzz around it.Deserts, yes they are more than fine. I had actually two and a coffee that was embellished with ice cream. Wine: again more than okay but nothing too rare or special. But i think wine lists are really becoming too generic these days that there are very few places that entertain me in that aspect, such as Craft.

The wild mushroom gnocchi was rich and melt-in-your mouth delicate. The seared tuna was the best I've had. Even the salad of dandelion greens with cubes of roasted butternut squash was just heaven.Also a nice touch: you can get wine by the glass, split or bottle.

We tried to order starters while waiting for a member of our party and we were told that the chef likes to receive complete orders so we could have the Salumi but nothing else until we were ready to order dinner.  The Salumi was good but not very large.We had: the eggplant bruschetta, kale salad and squid salad to start.  The winner was hands-down the bruschetta.  It was really fantastic. Everyone also loved the kale salad but I found it a bit too salty (I'd say the saltiness was an arching theme to the meal and I LOVE salt).  The squid was very good but a little small.We had the gnocchi and the Bolognese.  The Bolognese was the standout of the evening.  It was really delicious.  The gnocchi were fine but I thought they were just too salty.We ordered the steak, lamb, chicken and swordfish.  We all liked the steak and most of the table liked the chicken.  The chicken was very good but I didn't care for the salsa verde at all.  One of my dining companions said she has eaten comparable birds at Pio Pio.  The swordfish was good but a little small.  The lamb was okay. I ordered it medium-rare and had to send it back to the kitchen because it was over-cooked (I have actually never done that before).  The peppers and onions that came with the lamb were excellent. The fried potatoes were another highlight of the meal.  We also had the fagioli which were very good.We had the chocolate pudding for dessert which was delicious and we also had the blueberry torte with honey ice cream which was phenomenal.  We ordered 2 bottles of wine and with tip it came to $100 per/person.We had a very nice evening but I probably wouldn't return.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

Spicy, big glass, not that nasty mix so many restaurants all use.Not entirely sure if it would be a destination for dinner as i'm not a huge italian fan, but judging by the bloody mary quality alone, would be worth a go.  Very open, industrial feel - and would be nice in summer/ when it finally warms up consistently, if they open the garage style doors to outside (which would constitute all the windows/doors all around the restaurant).Bloody + soda = $14, so typical pricing - love that bloodies are almost always consistently cheaper than any cocktail as the few cocktails listed were $14 each",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

But after finding out about Pollo Al Forno...I told S and S was totally down for some chicken.Mind you, I am not a fan of chicken, since I am very particular on how I like my chicken. I am usually too scared to order chicken, since I hate dry and over-cooked chicken.I was confident enough to order a chicken entree here without worrying about dry chicken.The Pollo Al Forno - soooo damn moist and juicy. I wish there was more Salsa Verde action and crispier skin, but it was still delicious. I think it's because you're just so enthralled with the moistness of the chicken, that you don't really carry about anything else.We also shared the Linguini Alla Carbonara - pancetta, farmhouse egg, black pepper & parmesan.I only got this since S seem to really want this, but I was more leaning towards the ricotta pancakes, but I asked the waitress which one was more popular. She said this one, but I don't know how to describe the waitress, except she needs to work on her delivery style and she's so weird.This dish was decent, but it was missing something for me and plus this dish was way too rich and heavy for me. S seem to enjoy this more and kept eating after I took one bit.S wanted to get Patate crispy potatoes, parmesan & rosemary. But I am not trying to eat all this heavy food, so I told S I have to pass on this and I want to save room for dessert.I am glad I didn't agree to the Patate, since I saw the dish at another table and thought it looked crazy and damn heavy.We shared the Zuppa for dessert. I think it was called Zuppa. It was pound cake with some fruit. The pound cake could have been a bit more moist, but appreciate the fruit toppings.I would definitely come back for the Pollo Al Forno!

For my main, I had the monkfish, which was a generous portion and well prepared. I also tried my friends' meals. The jw roast chicken was sooo good. It had lots of seasonings (maybe fennel, among others) and was topped with a gremolata. The gnocchi was also good and the squash it came with was roasted to sweet, delicate perfection.

My friends and I happened to be there when the chef was in, and after gushing over his Top Chef Masters performance, we watched him float through the open kitchen in a Zen-like atmosphere of command and attention.We all shared the food, but I can't remember what the names were precisely so I'll just list the basic ingredient. They change their menu every day according to what is fresh on the market for the day.Starter: Gnocchi - This is the best gnocchi I have ever tasted. It's buttery, it melts into your mouth, it's got a symphony of smoky and rich flavors I never thought you could coax out of potato. Excellent, would go back just for this dish.Mains:1. JW Chicken - The roast chicken that is Chef Waxman's namesake, and which judges on Top Chef Masters called ""the best chicken I have ever had in my life."" That compliment is well-deserved. The heady smell of well-roasted chicken (I think there is one guy dedicated just to making the chicken) infused itself into every bite. As with any chicken, the middle was a bit dry, but the excellent blend of flavors overcame that hurdle.2. Trout with fiddlehead greens - This is an entire trout, butterflied for you on your plate, topped with fiddlehead greens and other vegetables. It was delicious, and moist, and even had crispy skin on at the bottom. I think this rivals the chicken for the best main of the night.3. Hanger steak - Hanger steak is a fairly basic dish, and while there wasn't anything wrong with it, it was at a disadvantage when compared with the other two excellent mains we enjoyed. You get what you ask for and that's about it.Dessert:Some kind of decadent chocolate chocolate caramel creation. We basically wanted every dessert on the menu (including the enormous cheese plate) but we were so full.Pros: The casual atmosphere, the very reasonable pricing, and the delicious fragrant flavors.

To start off, we had mussels in an herb broth, gnocchi with asparagus, and fusilli? and lamb ragu.  The mussels and broth were an interesting and refreshing mix.  Good.  The gnocchi was extremely mushy, not even the slightest bite to them.  For a place that considers itself to have an italian influence, pass.  The fusilli, while al dente, and along with lamb ragu, was bland.  The lamb ragu tasted like something out of a can. Pass.For my entree, I had the roasted chicken.  The skin was crispy and well seasoned... everything underneath however was tasteless.  The chicken was juicy, I'll give them that, but tasteless.It was a pretty disappointing meal and I'm sure I won't be back given there are tons of other celebrity chef restaurants I've yet to visit.**",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

Crackly skin, juicy meat (with the slight exception of the breast, but that is to be expected). I only wish it came with anything other than chicken and more chicken. We ordered a side of greens, but am I unreasonable for expecting that something comes with the entree? Maybe?Someone else ordered the ribolita and it was a little lackluster. I didn't get to try any of the other dishes, but there seemed to be general happiness around the table, though perhaps that was more due to the large garage door style windows and the lovely holiday weather. I'll bet this place is even nicer on the 3 days a year one wants to sit outside in NYC.For dessert we had the cookie plate and the coffee panna cotta, the latter of which was incredible.

We got the tasting menu, which has probably stuffed me up until November, but any extra pudge will be well worth it. It was a business dinner and we weren't feeling exceptionally stingy, so we had a bottle of red and a bottle of white. It was very Scenes from an Italian Restaurant, but updated for 2011. The meat and bread selection was fab, the mussels were delicious, the carrot and asparagus ""pasta"" was incredible and that bruscetta? Out. of. this. world. Well, I thought so, anyway. My fellow diners were not so up on the ""pate"" aspect of it, but I thought it was divine: chicken liver mousse on lightly oiled bread (with garlic) with a garnish of strawberry and rhubarb. Possibly one of the most delicious appetizers I have ever had. Then again, if pate isn't your bag, you may want to skip it.Then we had the risotto and the fettucitini with shrimp and jalapeno. Both were delicious but fairly forgettable. I've heard great things about the gnocchi, but I'd venture to say that if you're going to come here, you should definitely get the...CHICKEN! It's famous here for a reason, dontcha know? Simple and tremenously prepared. It's proof positive that fine dining doesn't have to be complicated. Delicious.We also had the skirt steak which came with a delicious spicy sauce and the swordfish on a bed of arugula. Both are solid, fine options and I'm glad I was able to sample them. If I came back starving, though, I'd get the chicken. We were also treated to the parmesan potatoes (excellent) and the cauliflower in walnut pesto sauce (divine). To top it off, we had a pistachio lemon cake, which is up there in my top five cakes of all time.

It was great being able to sit outside and the menu was really seasonal and perfect for a summer's day. I had the gazpacho which was fantastic, simple but incredibly flavorful and fresh, dotted with some olive oil and came with two large perfectly toasted croutons. I then had gnocchi with corn and cherry tomatoes which was really nice and a different combination than I've ever had - although I would say it was a bit too greasy for my liking and while it looked like the gnocchi had been pan fried at the end, they weren't crispy at all. Nonetheless, they had a great texture, super fluffy and light.

There are those places which fly under the radar about which virtually no one knows and you feel, as you partake of their benefits, that you're in on the secret.And then there are places which are both...like Barbuto.Barbuto is Jonathan Waxman's joint, a fairly impressive West Village scene-esque eatery that features an interesting space on an otherwise quaint, quiet street.We visited last night to celebrate a friend's birthday, and while it's out of the way for those of us uptown, it was well worth the ride.We started with Prosecco and the cheese and charcuterie (aka Salumi) starters. After making our way through these tasty bits, we dove into chicken and gnocchi and two sides of the patate (aka Potato) side-dish. For those of you who don't much care about roast chicken, have you ever eaten roast chicken that was rich, juicy and tasty like duck? I had never -- until last night. The outer crust of the chicken was a bit salty -- and while I understand the properties salt brings to the party in terms of both flavor and texture, and understand they use far more salt in restaurants than I am wont to use at home -- it was pretty fargin' incredible.Would I have been blown away by the chicken had I not been a fan of JW's -- or been looking forward to dining at his place? To put that in context, I was so underwhelmed by post-Tony Bourdain Les Halles that I won't return. Whereas -- with respect to Barbuto -- I will return as frequently as time permits.Incidentally, the patate sides were astoundingly good. Take the best, triple-fried fries you've ever eaten, mix in some garlic and rosemary, and some of the sweetest, most moist baby yukon golds, and you've got the patate side. It's so good, the only thing missing was bacon, and the crispy bits approximated the taste and texture of well-done bacon at its finest.Really impressed overall by a wonderful meal, including great service and overall a great experience. Can't wait to return.About the only negative was that the dimwit at the table next to us had as annoying and cloying a laugh as is humanly possible. I actually turned a few times to see if I could catch him mid-laugh to tell him to cheer up, but it didn't work out.So next time I know to bring ear-plugs.Rock on JW...keep up the good work :-)",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

We showed up as a party of two and had to do walk in since they don't take reservations for 2 or less. We were there at 9pm on a Saturday and I was expecting a long wait. We were told 45-60 minutes so we decided instead to sit at the bar and eat. This turned out to be a great move. Our bartender was super cool and took his time answering all our questions (yes, JW is there often). The decor is odd for such a great food place. I think it must have been a converted garage of some kind. But it somehow worked. The theme I can guess is that the place is super causal and laid back, but with amazingly prepared unpretentious food. I had a really cool drink but sadly I can't remember the name (nor find it online). But.. here's a tip, ask the bartender for the 'girliest' cocktail they make, as I did, and I'm sure you'll get it.So, food. We started with the Bruschetta which was super tasty. We finished that in record time. Next up was the Linguettine alla vongole which is essentially spaghetti and clams, but oh so much better than it had any right to be. It was simply amazingly cooked.Next up was the Stracotto di Bue which was a pot roast which must have been cooking all day since it just fell off the bone.. spectacular. My date had the Gnocchi which was our least favorite (yet still amazing). I think the issue we had with it was that we were expecting something light and spring like. Instead this was the perfect plate for a cold winters night. It was very earthy and hearty. For desert, we split the orange chocolate sandwich. We liked that a bunch.Overall, we had a great time.

The famous roast chicken dish is pretty tasty, ticking off nearly all the boxes on the standard list of ""this chicken is good"" Yelp adjectives, e.g., juicy, tender, ""chickeny,"" and featuring wonderfully salty, crisp skin. And hey, my leg of lamb was pretty nice, too. However, I can name two places off the top of my head whose chicken equals or betters Barbuto's (Vinegar Hill House and Marlow & Sons), and in general, I didn't find the food here significantly superior to any number of smaller, cheaper, hype-less restaurants all over the city, or even right in my own neighborhood. Service here was amazingly quick when we first sat down at 6:30, but by the time the place fills up your waiter will vanish like a ninja chameleon who is also Amelia Earhart and tragically turn into Billy from the Family Fuckin' Circus, compelled to follow a time-consuming and overly circuitous dotted-line path through five neighboring buildings, a jungle gym, a dog house, etc., each time before finally arriving at your table. The slowness is understandable, given the popularity of the place, but that makes it no more fun to wait 20 minutes for the privilege of having someone take your dessert order. Still, to their credit, I did get my sundae extremely quickly after I was able to actually order it, and it was...good.Overall, Barbuto is a solid, not life-changing, eating experience that buckles a bit under its own hype. I mean, I'm not the type of guy to turn my nose up at a place simply because it fails to be pants-shittingly spectacular, but frankly, at prices like this, and with crowds like this, ""solid"" isn't quite good enough.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

My boyfriend took me there a week ago for my birthday dinner and it was such a great experience, that it's one of my favorite restaurants now. I arrived a bit earlier, than my boyfriend and mentioned to the hostess,  that initially my boyfriend reserved a table for four people, but it will be only two instead. She kindly explained, they only reserve tables for bigger parties and only seat, when both patrons were present. She was very friendly and suggested for me to wait at the bar, she'll get me when my boyfriend arrives. At the bar, the bar tender, who also was very friendly, immediately asked me, if I would like to see the menu. I replied, yes but only the drink menu. I ordered a Lambrusco and didn't have to wait long for it  to be served. I wasn't a fan of it, due to the fact that I expected it to be sweet, not tart. Once my boyfriend arrived, the hostess immediately seated us at our table. Our waiter this evening was Lucas and he was such a sweetheart. He was very attentive to our needs and had an extensive knowledge of the drink menu as well, as the dinner menu. He mentioned the special for the appetizers this evening, which were the mussels in a white wine, garlic sauce, served on a bed of barley with pancetta. I asked, if it comes with bread on the side, he told me that unfortunately it wouldn't, but he can bring me some (which he didn't charge me for). So we went with the appetizer special this evening and ordered the gnocchi, in a Parmesan white sauce with corn, carrots and squash. We also ordered the roasted Parmesan potatoes and the roasted chicken. We didn't have to wait for our food to arrive and the portions are big enough to share (especially the chicken) or good for one person. For dessert, we had the pistachio tart, which was dense and served on a lemon, custard kind sauce with a dollop of fresh whipped cream. We asked our waiter, if he tried the pistachio tart, he was honest and kindly replied, he has not, because he has a nut allergy. But he hears a lot of compliments from his customers. It's suppose to be a popular dessert to order. We also went with the tiramisu. Both desserts were exquisite. Not too sweet and the portions were perfect. The atmosphere of the restaurant is modern, but cozy. It's almost like you have dinner at somebody's loft, especially with the open kitchen. Everybody is taking their time with their dinner and is chit chatting. It's not too loud and the staff knows when to attend to their customers and never rushes them. Although we already had our bill, Lucas assured us to just relax and take our time. It was such a refreshing experience. Barbuto you were excellent. And I can only recommend.

But that being said, it was yet another free meal for me so I'm not complaining.Really I'm not :)Maybe because I didn't try the Pollo al Forno but instead had the lamb and was just...'eh', okay. Everything was just 'eh'...okay. Insalata Mista was good, but just okay, crispy potatoes was just okay as well. Apart from everything else, the only thing that tasted above average was the rigatoni, it had this really nice 'crunchy' al dente texture as opposed to a generally overcooked pasta which everyone tends to do, soft on the outside but crunchy on the inside, and it had a very tasty sauce. My friends had the whole sea bass and the other the skate...judging by the way the bass was left into an empty carcass I would say that it was good. I did not get a verdict on the skate but did not hear any raves either so I will say that was just okay as well.Service was excellent but always is when you come in just a tad prior to the dinner crowd. Apparently chef Michael Symon was dining that night as well according to one of the waitresses, but alas I was too focused on food and the conversation. I did see Jonathan Waxman hanging by the open kitchen, which was cool as it provide an up and close kitchen feel, so I suppose that's something.The place was lively and not a seat open so maybe I am missing something here. I suppose if you are looking to catch a glimpse of celebrity chefs, bravotv/food network type celebrities in general, then the place is worth that. Maybe it's one of those neighborhood gems for manhattanites who want to eat rustic Italian food for a change, and enjoy Jonathan's California style cooking, although I struggle in defining what that is since when I think California, I think excellent wine, fresh tacos, In-N-Out burgers, and SoCal spanish architecture.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

Not bad overall, but there were a couple standouts in this garage-turned-restaurant, namely the roasted chicken and the gnocchi with mushrooms and walnut sauce. My dining companion and I ordered the $65 tasting menu, which the waiter cautioned us against due to the amount of food. Not knowing what we were in for, we ordered it anyway and soon understood his warning: these are NOT scaled down portions. Instead, you get the full sized portions of all dishes, each of which were extremely generous. We got three apps (each the size of an entree), two pastas, two main courses, two sides, and two desserts. Waaaay too much food!  It could have fed a party of 5, even with someone like me who can eat a lot.Apps:- Charcuterie plate: Good selection of 3 - 4 meats. Salty and yummy. - Smoked trout salad with frisee and pickled cauliflower: strong flavors but perhaps a little too aggressively smoky- Polenta with braised lamb: creamy, good flavors, tender meat. Overall pretty good, but wasn't served hot enough. Pastas:- Shells with meat ragu: perfect al dente, good flavors, but basically tasted like something I could get anywhere. - Gnocchi with mushrooms and walnut sauce:  richly flavored but not too heavy, pillowy dumplings with enough of a chewy bite - delicious both in terms of flavor and textureMains:- JW roast chicken:  moist, beatifully flavored, with a nice crispy skin.  I was already full by this point but still wanted to eat more of it!- Scallops with fennel:  nicely cooked to a medium rare, but there wasn't anything special about the dish as a wholeSides:- Crispy potatoes:  hot, crispy, and overall not bad, but it also wasn't anything special- Brussel sprouts:  very tender, decent flavors, but overall not very memorableDessert:- Chocolate Mousse- Some sort of cakeBothe were overall fine but didn't really impress me.  Kind of forgettable.Overall not bad but it would have been nice if they actually scaled down the portions of the tasting menu based on the number of people, and adjusted the price accordingly.  Definitely a great value for the amount of food we got, but we were only a party of two.  I'd have preferred less food and smaller bill.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

I had never given much thought to the food, but my latest visit made me think of Barbuto as a quality place to dine in a great location. I'd recommend Barbuto to anyone looking for a good meal in the heart of the Meat Packing district.Ambiance: Located in NYC's vibrant Meat Packing district, Barbuto is a great location for summer dining. Large garage-like doors open up the restaurant to the street cultivating an open, flowing feel. The tables are diner style, no table clothes here.Food: I have dined at Barbuto several times in the past and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food in the latest go around. For pasta, I suggest the orecchiette con calamari with point judith squid & chorizo. This dish was a great combination of spicy and tangy flavors, was good to share as the portion size was fairly large, was tossed in olive olive oil (no tomato or cream sauce), and the textures of the orecchiette, the chorizo and the squid complimented each other well. I followed the pasta with the maiale ai ferri - pork loin, rainbow chard & rhubarb mustard. Once again, the chef did a great job as the pork loin was very thick and maintained the juiciness throughout. I also had the striped bass - spigola ai ferri, with fennel, lemon & olives. The fish was good, but wasn't as incredible as the other dishes. I don't feel confident the food is consistently as good as it was on this visit and I need to go back again and have Barbuto prove its quality to me. Service: It's all you need in a place like this. The staff was attentive and courteous. Wine/Drinks: Very good selection of wines by the glass and by the bottle. Barbuto offers a good selection particularly for rosé's by the glass, which isn't common. I had a glass of the Lambrusco to start, which went very nicely with the orecchiette to start. The wine list is mostly Italian and is quite extensive offering some great selections at varying price points.JustAGuyThatLovesFood.bl…",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

Second time, a roach ran across the table and they were super nice about it - gave us a free champagne at the end... OK i get it - it's new york, doors and windows wide open, it happens. Food was still good.  Third time (last night), there was a SCREW in our risotto. Yes, a screw that one would find at home depot. One of the girls at my table found it in her plate as she went for seconds and started taking bites. We showed the waiter who basically looked surprised but then shrugged it off as if it didn't happen. He told the chefs and manager, we saw... no one came over to apologize. Unbelievable. They just acted like nothing happened. When we got our $1700 bill, we were surprised that they hadn't discounted anything or offered something on the house to ""make up for it"". Not only was this a HEALTH HAZARD, it is DISGUSTING. Good thing she didn't accidentally swallow the screw. We approached the manager, who barely apologized and said that he thought the chef came over and apologized and the situation was remedied. How do you remedy a screw found in your food?!? The chef never came over to apologize... As the girl who found the screw got up to use the restroom, he said he was sorry to her on her way. SO pathetic and awful customer service. The way they handled the situation was so poor. It wasn't until the  second time we complained that the manager offered a free class of dessert wine (which was so gross, no one drank it). The manager and waiter were terrible.. well I guess the chefs were too. Jonathan Waxman needs to hire and train better people. The chicken (the signature dish) and risotto (with a side of screw) didn't impress me that much. Also, almost every dish had asparagus in it. I like asparagus and all, but it gets old when it is in every dish. Needless to say, we will not be going back. And neither will any of our foodie friends, who we told this story to.

We ordered a very good bottle of red wine (I think amalgania or something - $36 dollar, which was one the cheap side for bottles here). We then shared the proscitto and polenta for appetizers - both very well prepared. For dinner we had the chicken - good use of flavor. I honestly don't remember the dessert, but I do remember eating the entire thing. This came out to around $50 per person - so a bit on the pricey side, but this goes with the area.

I had the baked eggs with creamed spinach and cheese and it was delicious. The eggs were runny and not overly baked, just the way I like it. The roasted chicken lived up to its fame with the crispy outside and tender meat. The orange juice was freshly squeezed and lovely while the coffee was strong and had a caffeine kick. Unfortunately, the baked eggs pizza was just average. The drawback of this place is the lack of AC on a very hot summer day. Don't get me wrong. I am all for open-air restaurants and it's a very lovely concept, but I think the owners should be flexible about when there should be AC or not. I couldn't enjoy the food as much when I am perspiring and downing glasses of iced water.. Overall, one can tell the pride and attention that was put into the food. My friend's request for an egg white omelette was emphatically turned down by the waiter who insisted that the kitchen can do it, but will not accomodate it..

Not just because of the copious amount of alcohol that was consumed last night, but more from the experience I had eating and grinning the night away. My experience alone is worthy of 5 stars, but the food stands on its own as one of the best meals I've ever had in NYC. Where to begin...upon entering Barbuto my colleague and I were amazed to find Jonathan Waxman AND Rick Moonen sitting down for a meal. It blew us away simply because moments like this do occur in NYC, but usually not for us hahaha After finally closing the wide open gap that was my mouth, we waited for our table over a bottle of Soave that was just perfectly crisp, with a hint of fruit that danced on my palate. The dinner finally arrived and we decided on the insalata caprese, the gnocchi pomodoro, and the pollo al forno. The insalata was amazingly fresh, the heirloom tomatoes were huge and tasty, while the mozzarella was moist and perfect.The Gnocchi Pomodoro was another amazing surprise. The mix of gnocchi, corn and tomatoes was both tasty, fresh and robust. Then came the big daddy, the pollo al forno (the Jon Waxman special). Hands down one of the best chicken dishes I've ever devoured. It was expertly seasoned, perfectly cooked and moist. My stomach is grumbling just thinking about it! Superb is an underrated word to describe the meal. All in all ... a great meal.The cherry on top came afterward, as we were leaving my colleague and I wound up having a drink with the very welcoming Rick Moonen.

593,MoORgMOPDtMsJ8jH7t_rmg,Chris C.,4.0 star rating,"People from all parts of the world travel to Manhattan to escape from their everyday lives and get a taste of the Big Apple, but local New Yorkers can escape from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan without going very far. A dinner at Barbuto is a transformative experience, and not just for your taste buds. In the warm weather, the hulking steel garage doors open up the island to its very sidewalks; you'll feel as if you went on vacation in the incalculable hours that you spend wining and dining at Barbuto, returning in plenty of time to make it to the office in the morning.Food: One of the main draws at Jonathan Waxman's foodie haven is that the menu changes nearly every day. The one mainstay is the house specialty: a deceptively simple Pollo al Forno ($19).  Don't get me wrong, this ain't your Plain Jane chicken ... Waxman's is subtly dressed in a lemony, garlicky salsa verde with a smattering of basil leaves sitting atop a small puddle of lemon butter ... but the meat does all the real talking, specifically the chicken skin, perfectly crispy and charred (I could eat this skin for days ...). The dish is massive, comprising three pieces of chicken - breast, leg and wing - all expertly roasted and marinated in that tasty verde. There was never a dull -or dry - bite. Garganelli Bolognese ($19), laden in a rich, vibrant pork and veal ragu, with some carrots thrown in for your conscience, was expertly cooked.  I've never had a more al dente pasta, the extra-wide tubular noodles breaking apart on my fork to become more like pappardelle. One of the many ""specials of the day"" (kind of an oxymoron at a place like Barbuto) were pork ribs accompanied by a decoration of escarole and kale. Like any meat cooked well, these fell off the bone without much prodding. The portion, similar to the chicken, was also large enough for sharing. The barbecue sauce the ribs came dressed in wasn't heavy or oversweet, but it didn't wow me with any intricate flavor either. A side order of verdure ($7) included a healthy dollop of more escarole, kale, garlic and chilies - four components that seem to factor in a lot of Barbuto's dishes - and helped add some color and cleansing to what was a meat-heavy meal. No meal at Barbuto is complete, however, without starting with one of the heralded crostinis-bruschettas amalgamations - the most brilliant being chicken liver ($10). The sweet (caramelized onions) and savory (that'd be the chicken liver spread) combination was fantastic, and with four crostinis on the plate, there's also enough to share - although you'd be hard-pressed to do so.Service: Our server was brutally honest (I don't eat vegetables) and attentive (nary a moment went by without a refill of water or wine). The service, like everything at Barbuto, is top-notch; friendly without being too informal, attentive without being interruptive. This is your vacation after all ...Atmosphere: It's a large, airy space with café chairs, brick walls, an open kitchen (and wood fire-burning oven) - and that's merely in the winter. In any season, Barbuto maintains a very convivial, transparent atmosphere. In the warm weather, it's even better, as all the dining action literally spills out onto the streets.Value: Good for a special night out with a date but moreover, with a group of friends before a fun night out. The prices are cheaper than similar establishments in the same area (it's the Meatpacking after all), but the portions are larger and meant for sharing. Barbuto is a unique, priceless dining experience without the heavy price tag.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

I will give celeb chef Jonathan Waxman credit for being in attendance, even if he did look like a refugee from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in his wrinkled gray shirt and pants.

617,nuBmvVOY1UktI7gfl6kNQg,Lee H.,5.0 star rating,"Since watching Top Chef Masters with ""Jedi Chef"" Jonathan Waxman, I've been curious to try his restaurant. His demeanor on the show was always portrayed as laid back and calm, cool and collected. But beyond that, Jonathan has been credited with transplanting the ""California cuisine"" ethos to NYC and has inspired many chefs throughout the years. This is a place we needed to try. We chose a Sunday evening to pop into Barbuto for dinner. The atmosphere is fantastic, with roll up doors that face the sidewalk, giving the entire restaurant an industrial and open air feel. The kitchen is also open and I almost couldn't believe my eyes when I saw Jonathan in the kitchen. I sipped on a nicely prepared Negroni before being seated at one of the tables that bordered the sidewalk. All right, let the Manhattan people watching begin!The Italian focused menu is simple and seasonal, making narrowing down a dinner choice difficult, so we eyed all of our neighbors' items before settling on our own entrees. The pollo al forno which translates to roasted ""JW chicken"" (does Jonathan Waxman raise his own chickens??) served with salsa verde. The chicken was nicely flavorful and moist, with crispy skin and that salsa verde was a garlicky complement. The dessert menu beckoned and I spied one of my favorites, chocolate budino. I'm picky about my budino and have found that the version at Pizzeria Mozza in LA is the benchmark to which all budinos are measured. After the second spoonful, I was ready to pronounce that Barbuto has my second favorite budino. The texture was right and every spoonful was savored. Lively atmosphere, great food and an evening of watching Jonathan in the open kitchen translates to a great experience.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

620,Lv5tUZFDXNgVkTqXhsGmtw,Lauren T.,4.0 star rating,"This review is based on two different visits to Barbuto. I can see from some of the other reviews that others had a similar interpretation on the consistency of the quality of the food.To begin, the roast chicken is just a must. It most definitely lived up to the hype. The first time I tried it, the chicken was moist, the skin flavorful, and it truly tasted like chicken. My second go with the chicken was still good but not mindblowing. I was also served an absurd amount of chicken. My boyfriend's lamb dish was delicious but looked like an amuse bouche in comparison to the chicken. Oh well, they were happy to wrap it up for lunch (and dinner!) the next day.Also, you have to order sides if you want anything besides chicken with your meal. It's the only entree that seems to be that way--strange. However, the roast potatoes are fantastic; they are cooked in so much butter that they taste like doughnuts. Mmmm, I would go back just to order a side of potatoes. Barbuto is good at using seasonal ingredients, making for ever-changing additions to the menu. The summer bean salad I had was fresh and sweet. While the zucchini crudo I ordered was well-dressed, again, there was an entire zucchini on the plate. Got a little monotonous after awhile. All in all, a lovely evening with simple food that hits the spot. I mean, how wrong can doughnut potatoes be?",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

Perhaps we had a particularly engaging server, or the lovely bottle of wine simply made it seem so..but I really can't believe that others have complained about the service. In all honesty, I would probably give Barbuto 5 stars for food even if our server had been bad--the food was delicious, the space is great, and the entire dinner was fun. I'm not actually a huge fan of chicken (my far my least favorite protein), but the few bites I stole from the fiance's plate were pretty darn delectable. My flank steak was spicy and delicious, but the star might have been the gnocchi! The few bites I stole from a friend's plate were pretty darn incredible. When (not if!) we come back to Barbuto, I'm going to convince the boy to order family style with me so we can share a few things!The only reason Barbuto doesn't get 5 stars from me?The dessert.We ordered the cream tart and the Italian chocolate pudding.The cream tart tasted like whipped cream with some fruit on top, and the chocolate pudding tasted like..well..pudding! If we're going to order dessert at a restaurant, it should taste a little better than reddi-whip meets fruit and a snack cup!A tasty ending, but not 5 star worthy.We'll be back..but perhaps we'll try to gelato!

625,-86t4LauO8uFGnPn711L7Q,Enoch H.,3.0 star rating,"First off, I love the ambiance of a garage turned into a restaurant. It gives the place a casual yet trendy enough feel that you could take a date or your family. While waiting at the bar for the rest of my party to arrive for our reservations, I enjoyed the diverse yet reasonably priced wine and drink menu as I downed a cold craft wheat beer. We were able to dine on a mild march night when the garage doors were raised so that everyone could enjoy the fresh night air.To start off the meal, we shared the calamari appetizer. The calamari was tender and cooked nicely. It would have paired perfectly with the greens, chilies, radish, and chickpeas had the dish not been overly acidic. I felt that the acidity overpowered the lightness of the entire dish.Next, we ordered the chicken, gnocchi, and risotto, with a side of potatoes. I must say, even knowing the hype around Jonathan Waxman's chicken, I was not disappointed. The flavorful yet thin and crisp chicken skin with salsa verde added a lovely texture to each bite. I normally do not order chicken at restaurants because it can be easily overcooked and frankly, I can cook it well enough. However, there is no way (yet) that I could reproduce meat that was as juicy and tasty with perfect skin as the one I had eaten.As for the gnocchi, I will admit I am no expert, so I will just say that the few bites I had were pretty good. My friend thoroughly enjoyed it, but I wouldn't go as far as to say it was very memorable. I personally preferred Babbo's gnocchi, a lighter, softer, more airy version. Unfortunately, the low point of the meal came in the form of the risotto. The rice was undercooked and a bit crunchy to the extent where we were debating whether or not to send it back. The only acceptable aspect was its sauce, but that itself could not redeem the dish. The potato sides were fried pretty well and still had some good sized chunks of potato. You can't really go wrong with fresh rosemary and potatoes.For dessert, we shared a canoli and chocolate pudding. Both weren't bad, but they were nothing special. Portion sizes at Barbuto were very good. We could have actually done without the sides, but I'm just a glutton so we ended up finishing everything. Given the ratio of waiters/waitresses to customers, the slightly slow service was expected. We were also given a nice red wine recommendation by our waitress to go along with our meal. One last note is that the half-open kitchen is always a nice touch. I was able to see chef ""Obi Wan Kenobi"" himself moving about the kitchen.Overall, Barbuto just met my expectations but did not provide much in terms of surpassing them.

Our server was prompt and friendly.I would recommend the mussles, the mushroom pizza and the pasta with shredded pork. The mussels had a great broth, the pizza was loaded with savory mushrooms and the pasta had a pork that tasted like it was braised for hours. The chickpea fritters tasted good, but they came in rectangular bricks that were a little dry. My skirt steak with endive salad was a little dissapointing for an entree salad. It just didn't have a lot of substance to it. Also, avoid the skate wing. For those of you that don't know, its an inexpensive item that is basically the floppy part of a sting ray you see at aquariums.One item that looked really good that we didn't get was the bruschetta.

Sometimes when you hear a buzz about something you wonder what the hype is and when you finally try it, it can be disappointing. However, not this chicken. It.s actually a pretty exciting chicken! Roasted in oven juuuuust perfectly, not dry at all. The flavors are simple but super delicious! It.s half a chicken per serving cut in four pieces. Definitely shareable between two. Right now (ca. 7-6-'14) they have these steamed, hand mooshed then deep fried potatoes topped w pecorino that is incredible! Such a great sidekick for the chicken. Really! They also had a thinly sliced cauliflower w roasted hazelnuts, scallions and raisins that was Really good. I think their option of mandonline-ing the cauliflower thinly makes it easier to bite on that chunky veggie. Highly recommended, the three items above highly recommended. Desserts: they have a choco pudding that is very similar to a pot de creme, so good! Rich and delicious. They also had a sour cherry tart w van. Ice cream that was really good. The cherries were indeed sour but the ice cream helped balance things.... Good combo! Then a poundcake khalua something that was forgettable. I.d skip the kahlua cake.

First of all loved the ambiance, the garage doors giving the restaurant an industrial feel were up and the sidewalk tables were full. Loved the open kitchen and the oven going full blast. If we were placed right next to the kitchen my head would be up on the ledge, just like a dog putting its head on a chair begging for food. The service was casual and efficient and the waiter provided all the so called ""greatest hits""Sometimes you leave a restaurant and everyone comments on that one dish that makes you want to come back. In the case of Barbuto it was more like 3 to 4 dishes that were all so well done1) Mushrooms in a 12 yr balsamic- perhaps the ingredients do all the singing here and its not the hand of the chef, but everyone swooned over this simple and sexy dish that made you want to put in a second order2) Gnocchi with snap peas-the waiter warned us it mite be the best gnocchi in the city. Possibly the best gnocchi Ive had in awhile, pillowy, lusciously good, and the snap peas were quite fresh..really a fantastic dish3) Chicken with salsa verde - I will dream about this skin for the next couple days, first of all a huge portion, roughly half a chicken roasted in the oven. I usually never get chicken, when does chicken ever surprise anyone? Its meant for the patron who doesnt know what they want...the chicken was perfectly roasted, the skin extra crispy and I just loved it. It possibly needed a salad or something under it, but then again we just ate half a chickenThese were the most memorable dishes. Dishes that all followed the chefs philosophy of simple and clean flavors that are plane out maxed to the bone. Simple flavors that sing and everyone swoons over.

639,pnxR2QTn2G3lPvQRWet8Pw,Nils E.,4.0 star rating,"Would you be mine, would you be mine, won't you be...my neighbor?If I lived in Greenwich Village, I'd be a regular at Barbuto. It's reasonably priced, has relatively diverse menu options including one sensational signature dish, and is laid back enough to be both hip and unstuffy. I'd like to think that I share some of the latter qualities, which is probably why I am attracted to the place (internal dialog: narcissist...you shut up...no YOU shut up...no YOU.). So, it's fitting and somewhat modest that I'm only giving it/me 4-stars...we're both rough around the edges.As my neighborhood restaurant, I'd work hard for the distinction of being on a first-name basis with the staff before recommending they take down the ridiculously ostentatious blow-up of Waxman's ""A Great American Cook"" book cover and shove it in a broom closet. The kitchen and the restaurant as a whole deserve accolades for the tone and ambiance, so the back-patting is an unwelcome distraction.Otherwise, the converted garage setting is very cool. It's not the first restaurant to take advantage of the utility of a garage, but the transformation from enclosed to open-air caused by rolling up the doors never loses its appeal (so long as it's not drafty on wet or frigid days). The brightly painted interior, mismatched chairs, and open kitchen are all likewise conducive to the ""hip"" factor.We visited Barbuto for a late lunch, which had some limitations, but enabled us to avoid the crowd and receive a lot of attention from the lone server. He made good recommendations and even tried to warn us that we were probably ordering too much for two people. (We took him up on the recommendations and ignored his admonition.) One of his tips was that the bartender, a native Brazilian, mixed a mean caipirinha. This was an understatement, and it was every bit as delicious as it was billed to be - real cachaça, sugar cane and muddled lime - all mixed with the proper proportions. What a way to kick-off a meal and an afternoon.We started with the seared CALAMARI with charred corn and chili oil. The char flavor accented with the chili oil imparted a very unusual and pleasing flavor to the calamari, which were cooked perfectly with just the right 'give' to the texture without being chewy.The BRUSCHETTA con uovo was a thick slice of Italian bread topped with a fried egg, pancetta, parmesan, squash and arugula. The bottom of the bruschetta was slightly charred, but unlike the enhancement to the calamari, it detracted from this dish. (When is burnt toast ever a pleasing flavor?)We had a side of fingerling POTATOES that came served with a sauce of crème fraiche, lemon and paprika. This was an enormous plate, even for two people, and while the potatoes were cooked beautifully, the sauce was too bland for our liking and needed more oomph.The BUCATINI alla carbonara was a very pleasing dish. The carbonara sauce was heavy, but the thickness of the al dente bucatini held it well, and the liberal use of black pepper cut the thickness of the cream/egg/parmesan. The pancetta was diced roughly, which left large flavorful chunks in the dish that also offset the heaviness of the sauce.The piece de resistance was the POLLO AL FORNO. Waxman's chicken was served with salsa verde (oil, parsley and basil) and was every bit the signature dish. The skin was crisp (we didn't think twice about eating every ounce of it), the meat was juicy and perfectly seasoned with salt and pepper, and this bird was perfectly cooked. I would venture back to Barbuto time and time again JUST for this dish.Very, very disappointingly, we were too stuffed for dessert - a mistake that I hope to remedy in the not too distant future. I'd also like to experience the dinner menu, which I gather has more main course options.Its imperfections make Barbuto the quintessential neighborhood restaurant - if it were perfect, the crowds would make it impossible to have regulars.

But half way through the meal I began to realize that this might actually be one of the best roasted chicken I've had. My appreciation for this impeccably executed classic grew and by the end  I was thoroughly satisfied.Things to note:Get a side dish, since your entree is protein centric you will need some crunch.

One of those meet at the museum and have lots to really say to each other situations. After the Rubin, I wanted to keep the good vibes going. Had chosen the Rubin over the Museum of Art and Design because you can get a lot of fantastic meals in this area without having to sell a kidney to pay for the meal. I figured we could head west and scout about after the museum for a bite to eat. At first we ended up at this place that looked pretty much up my alley. Not overly packed, so we could hear each other speak, candles on the tables, cozy. We sit down and the waitress explains that the cook does a sampling thing [Houston we have a problem.] and I think she mentioned something about ""tastings"" [Crap maybe I should have had a peanut butter and jelly before I came out.] Now don't get me wrong. I really didn't care about the cash, but it's the pretense that bothers me. ""Tastings!?!"" Dude, my grandma will kick all your asses!!! Hell everybody's grandma probably can. Imagine a ""iron Chef"" grandma versus chef special. Anyway, I look over and my date is searching. I inquire as to what she might order. She chooses something from the salads and appetizers. Alert. ""You wanna get outta here"", hell I'd be eating a steak somewhere, so if she isn't enjoying herself.... She was worried about the impropriety of the gesture. In my mind ""tastings"" shows little regard for anyone but yourself. And I'm a little weary of anyone stroking their ego over my food. So we end up a Barbuto, which is where I had scouted out prior to the date. [Yeah I know, but you can't leave things like this completely to chance.] As soon as we get inside to the table, she expressed relief. And the date could go on at the easy pace that we had at the museum. She ordered the gnocchi alla salsiccia: spicy sausage ragu with riccota, I had the filetto di maiale: hampshire pork loin with apple and yam. Mine was ...[sorry Grandma] Somehow they grew an apple tree in the kitchen and shaved the very crispest [if this wasn't a word it is now] part of it onto the top of your experience. I dug under the pork loin for the yams next. In the south [land of the Grandma] the biggest compliment is when someone takes their biscuit and mops the plate for the very late drop. In this case the impropriety of that gesture up here is a shame: good yams. So the pork. ""Succulent"" dominates my memory of the event a day later. I'm thankful for the assist.

We have previously dined there and had a better experience than the one we had this time around. Both times, we went on a Friday without reservations. We are not new to the city and expected a wait time, which is not a problem. After standing for an hour and watching an empty table for almost 30 minutes, we were discouraged by the way reservations were handled. Ironically enough, we sat at the empty table about 15 minutes later. To recap, we waited an hour 15 minutes for a table that had been empty for almost 45 minutes. Once we were seated the waitress was slightly rude about reminding us that if we wanted to order food, the entire order would have to be placed. This was not the case when we dined here the last time. I understood that they wanted to get through tables quick enough to meet reservation demand but it was appalling that they would do it at the expense of their customer service. Food: In terms of the food, the Parpadelle was exceptional. My wife had a very peppery spaghetti. If pepper is your thing, go for it. As mentioned in other reviews, the meat and cheese platers were splendid. No complaints there. For dessert we had the budino, which is a chocolate pudding. This is by far one of the best desserts that we've had. Wine: Though not extensive, the wine list was decent (~4 of 5). Some great Italian choices. Overall, the experience was OK because of the sour taste left behind by the service. Most of what we remember of our dining experiences is the food and service. Would we wait an hour for Barbuto again? Definitely not. There are better local options that don't seem as pretentious.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

Apparently it's nothing new and yet I've never explored this corner of Washington and w. 12th. They close their reservations one day in advance, so be prepared for a wait if you walk-in like we did. We checked in with them twice, because they didn't seem so busy to warrant a 1hr+ wait, and by the second time the table was ready, a bit earlier than they had estimated.The venue is very sexy. Everything is open and revealed. The kitchen is open to the tables, the tables extend out onto the sidewalk through a seemingly wall-less structure. I think that sexiness struck some of the patrons, at a nearby table a girl couldn't stop sitting in her date's lap. We started with the salad caprese for the table. The special pasta was a paparadelle with pancetta, mushrooms, and onion - the winner of the night. We also had steak and gnocchi, but the caprese and paparadelle were the standouts. Finished the meal with gelati (mint and espresso) and the semifreddo. The gelati was not very gelati-like, lacked cream and shape, and it got all melty.  I would give them a 4.5 if Yelp gave the half star and Barbuto would get a 5 if the wait  was shorter and the service a tad more prompt (albeit enthusiastically friendly, our waiter was nowhere to be found at the end of the night).",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

The meal began with a chopped Kale Salad and an Heirloom tomato salad. The tomato salad was piquant, savory, the tomatoes perfectly delicious and fresh. I have the idea that Italian food is the easiest to cook badly, smother meat with cheese, serve some nondescript vegetable, there you have it. Not here. Everything, the tomato and kale salads, was marvelously fresh, prepared with such great care. On then to the steak for me, the cod for my wife. The steak was a skirt steak, medium rare over arugula with an artisanal cheese crumbled in. It was perfectly cooked, juicy, beautifully prepared and served, a great experience. The meat was said to be prime and it met that standard and more. We will go back again, perhaps many times. Honestly, I can't imagine eating out anyplace else this Summer. It was that good.

(And I'm talking about all over the place, not just one spot.)  If this is what they are willing to let me see, I shudder to think about the condition of the areas of the restaurant that aren't open to the public.  Not as bad as the bathroom in Trainspotting, but much worse than the bathroom at Grand Central Station.  Absolutely unacceptable.  If you want this type of Italian food AND a sanitary environment, eat at Babbo instead.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

But that was all over when the two dishes were taken off the bill! Now to the food:We tried the Mussles ($12) which were good, but after Flex Mussles, these just don't compare. The bruschetta ($9) however, was delicious. The perfectly grilled ciabatta bread brushed with olive oil is served with the freshest ricotta spread. The thin slices of cucumber added a little crunch that worked perfectly with the spread. YUMWe also tried the pesto past with zucchini and pine nuts.($18) A pretty good portion, but not worth the price. I can't seem to pass up a pesto dish when I see one, and the sauce was definitely worth trying. Finally, we had the skirt steak ($19). Ours came with long strips of green onion and a peanut sauce to spread. The peanut sauce worked really well, but the meat itself was overcooked and a bit hard to chew. We also wanted to try to fingerling potatoes, but I guess the chef forgot to make those as well because they never came. Oops. The ambiance of the open air restaurant is so inviting.

The only thing on the table we didn't really like was the squid appetizer, which had more salt than Gandhi.

679,RcxplSQhyQOjLqFWd3MVsQ,Jonathan C.,3.0 star rating,"Maybe I got a dud, or perhaps I'm just not used to chicken cooked in this style, but I found my chicken to be a bit on the dry side. The skin was incredibly crisp and well-seasoned, but irregularly so - some bites would be bland, and others extremely salty.Maybe it's the Chinese in me (used to a slice of skin on every piece of Peking Duck), but the meat itself was a bit disappointing without the skin. Over-cooked, but a hint of  the seasonings did manage to creep into the meat all the way through the bone, however weak it was. After having a large hunk of meat, I then tried a drumstick from another plate (I went in a party of 6, and we ordered 3 plates), as that is usually the easiest ""cut"" of chicken to get right. It was only as moist as I had expected the breast meat to be, and was nothing exceptional.We also ordered sides of vegetables, potatoes, and gnocchi.The vegetables - nothing exceptional. Not any better than if my mom threw a handful of AA Choy in a wok with some vegetable oil and salt. The bitterness of the vegetables was still very much present. Also, the portion size was tiny. I'm under the impression that restaurants pulling crap like this (tiny portions of inexpensive foods/veggies for high prices) are the reason that products like FiberOne even exist in America.Potatoes - This was my favorite side. A crunchy skin on cubes of well-cooked potatoes topped with rosemary. However, the portion size, again, was not that generous, and after a few bites of ""potato,"" the dish quickly devolved into a plate covered with crunchy deep-fried batter.Gnocchi - also pretty good. Very soft and tender like gnocchi should be, but they cooked it in a way that there was a very slight crunchy outer layer on the outside. Not traditional at all, and I didn't really appreciate it.Ambiance -The restaurant was REALLY loud, and it was difficult to hold a conversation with people on the other end of the table (again, 6 people, so 3 on each side), and sometimes even with people next to or across from you. However, I really liked the garage concept, and I think I would be open to coming back in the summer when the restaurant is open-air. At night, it gets very dark.

680,4Jjsugexx5B_JTxX61NUbw,Sav B.,4.0 star rating,"Let's start a few facts about Barbuto first:- It's the closest restaurant from my house.- It boasts famous chef Jonathan Waxman's style of cooking- It's right above Industria, so if hot models are your thing, you might get some sightings late dinnersThe ambiance of Barbuto is just perfect. It's located on Washington Street, so away from the busyness of Meatpacking and Hudson Street. The whole restaurant is built out of a garage, so during summers the doors slide up and we enjoy the nice breeze. It can get a little cold in the winter, so have a sweater on. The food selection is excellent, although not many options for vegetarians. The highlight is the chicken, rubbed in some super miracle oil, that makes it so tasty. And it's a whole cut up chicken, so may want to skip the appetizers. The drinks are a bit on the expensive side, however, the wine selection is excellent. They also have a few seafood choices like the bass and monkfish, but before you try anything else - give the chicken a shot. They serve it both for brunch and dinner.If I had to name three favorite restaurants in the West Village - Barbuto will be one of them. Even for hanging out and drinks, this is a wonderful spot. Casual, yet stylish. Oh, and watch out for those models....",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

683,SZPGu1CE2EMlxRGNBB3RaQ,Max L.,1.0 star rating,"I've eaten here twice. The first time was about two months ago. I had their braised short rib, and it was fantastic. My friend had their chicken entree, he loved it. There was plenty of food, we tried each others dishes and still had to take home half of each of our dishes because there was that much good food.Fast forward to last night... We ordered the same entrees, and same sides. Tried their calamari as well this time. The calamari was cooked well. I have to hand it to them, the texture was fantastic. Probably the best preparation I've ever had. This was a salad dish actually, and it was mostly greens and beans.The menu has been restructured to get more bank per plate by the restaurant. Last night I actually tasted the recession everyone on the news is making a big deal about. I don't blame the place for trying to increase their profit margin since times are tough but I think they could have done this much better. The quality of the meat served to myself and my friend did not compare to our first visit 2 months ago. Interestingly enough 2 months ago when we came to this place because other spots had long waits my friend said he'd never eat here. We both felt wrong about that statement at the end of the meal that time.To understand why I'm so upset I'll give you some dish details about the short rib. First time: Large dish with two big short ribs on the bone. Big deal for flavor if it's on the bone. I pickup the bone with my fingers and the meat literally falls off. I know immediately this is going to be great. Came with nothing else on the plate or side.Side: creamy polenta dish. Don't recall it as much as the rib.Meal presentation favored family/group dinning with sharing of plates amongst friends.Second time:Short ribs are now accompanied by a crispy risotto. The risotto I think is a nice touch as the meat is very soft. NO BONES ON THE PLATE! Instead there are two small pieces of short rib meat which were not of the same consistency. One piece was cooked properly, the other was tough, the meat didn't fall apart, and there was a large chunk of fairly solid fat. The fat normally becomes very very soft because of the braising process. This means either the quality of the meat is shit or the person who now cooks this is awful. I blame the quality of the meat for the most part.This time, no left overs... there was actually some things left on our plates because we just didn't want them.On both occasions the service was ok at best. I don't blame restaurants for trying to make their menu/dishes recession proof to survive, but you don't cut on the quality of the food. Fine, lower the quantity, but don't every get cheaper meat! Short rib is meant to be served on the bone. That's the idea of a rib dish! This place is forever off my list of dinner options. I do not recommend this place at all because of the inconsistency. It's also very loud.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

They don't take reservations for 2 so we waited at the bar on a Thurs night for about a half hour where we proceeded to scarf down a delicious cheese plate, good bruschetta, and a pretty good bottle of Brunello. The atmosphere is great with the open garage doors keeping it cool and the neighborhood crowd cruising by. Tables were a bit cramped and if the bar is full there is no where to wait. When we were seated, we ran into Bobby Flay exiting from dinner with a buddy. He was a dick but we knew the food would be great for sure. Had Gnocchi and it was probably the best I've ever had, light and delciious, tossed in a tasty gravy with asparagus and peas, it was reminiscent of an amazing pot pie. The roasted chicken entree was everywhere and was huge so we went for that along with the swordfish. The chicken was moist and tasty, amazing. The swordfish was really good with some delicous greens on the side with fava beans. I could have eaten a whole plate of the greens. Side of roasted cauliflower was nothing special. Desserts of mocha cannoli and coconut chocolate tart were good but not incredible. While we were waiting outside for our cab after the meal some twenty something neighborhood wannabe hipsters walked by and scoffed ""oh let's go to Barbuto and wear our Ed Hardy t-shirts"". Interesting because being from California the kids were much more of the Ed Hardy type than the customers of Barbuto who seemed casual and sophisticated but did sku a little older.

So naturally I had the chicken, as did my friend who, up until recently, only ate poultry and thus considers herself a chicken expert. Anyway- JW's chicken is a ginormous plate of food that can easily serve 2. I would have appreciated fair warning about that; the juicy goodness isn't going to hold up the next day as leftovers. Reading other people's comments and discovering that dishes can be done by half orders would have been very useful information at the time, for sure. I also could have used more room for the salted caramel gelato offered for dessert. Gotta say, though, the best thing I ate that night wasn't actually the chicken (which was pretty darn good). Winner of the evening goes to the side of potatoes. Nice and crispy with parmesan and rosemary; I was thisclose to eating the fried rosemary. Overall a lovely evening and a great meal. Marks off because the service could have been better. Hostess was a little snitty.

But I had to give this place only 3 stars, which crushes me. I walked in there anticipating at least 4, but aiming for 5. This overall rating is also based on a quintessential experience about dining out -- service -- which was lacking. To begin the food, especially the roast chicken, was a 5 - in fact I would give that 6 if I could. But the service was a 0! I couldn't bring myself to say that Barbuto is less than 3, just because I enjoyed the food and my latte so much. Mind you, I went for brunch, and not dinner, so hopefully the front of the house steps it up a notch for dinner service.I have to say, the chicken is perfectly cooked. It was moist, and the skin perfectly browned. Me thinks that it must have been cooked in clarified butter to get that perfect texture on the skin, and perfect moisture of the meat. The portion was also exceedingly generous. However, I suggest that two people can have this rather than one. Additionally, since it comes with no side, its almost expected to order one, thus making the portion even bigger for one person. Get this and a side (the potatoes) for 2 people you will be fine.Like I said, the downside was our server just basically sucked. Hating to use that word, but there is really no other way to succinctly explain what we encountered. he was nice-ish, but great, but just didn't care about putting some pride in his work. What irked me the most is that I still had half of my chicken left to tear into and he just picked up the plate without asking if I was even finished! My BIGGEST pet peeve. I mean what if I wanted to continue eating, or take it to go? I felt so rushed, like I was already being ushered out of the restaurant. You don't even reach for a plate without asking the customer's status, never mind absconding with it before I could react. He also failed to apprise me of just how large that portion was. My friend and I could have easily split this.Next, my friend ordered the ice cream dessert. And although I mentioned I didn't want a spoon, he didn't bring one. Then when the dessert was melted and mostly gone, the server returned and said sarcastically, ""Oh I didn't bring you a spoon. You didn't seem to want one anyway. I guess it's too late if you wanted one now."" WHAT!? There wasn't anything to eat. What ice cream soup? Why bring the spoon now, and make that stupid comment?Finally, the coup d'etat, on the bill he overcharged me for a latte. I mean, you provide unprofessional service and then you carelessly overcharge? I would have even liked a second latte, if he ever bothered to ask, which he didn't. But I have a severe aversion to people who overcharge? What if I didn't check the bill? In this economy, people don't have as much money to throw away. It's just unfortunate when service can really put a damper on the experience and the food. I would hope to return and get a better server, and even try it for dinner, but brunch was a bust.  Ambiance is cool and fun of course, but so unimportant compared to how atrocious the service was. I adore Jonathan Waxman and I am willing to give this another try, but shame on me if I go again and service still sucks. I guess I should heed my own warning.(On a side note-- I used to wait tables in college at this same restaurant space, but back then it was called Braque. Very weird to go back now.)",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

PROS:Yes, the chicken was very good. A little too much salt and oil but it was very good, extremely generous portion and the least expensive entree. The side of potatoes was also good.CONS:Everything else. Let me explain.First, the bruschetta we started off with was really not good at all. Such an ugly and frankly not tasty dish. The drinks were also overpriced for what they were. Also, the Jonathan Waxman posters on the wall and selling his books on the menu? Seriously? Speaking of our menu, it seemed the printer was out of ink and it was very hard to even read what was on the menu. Next, the service. The waitress was rude and inattentive. She did not come back once after she took our order, not even to check if everything was okay, even after she walked by our table to service other tables. We did not complain or anything during the meal, there was no reason for her to be like that. Then, after our plates were cleared the table sat messy until we left, no one came over to wipe it off. The waitress NEVER came back to ask if we wanted dessert, to ask if we wanted a check. We sat for 20 minutes before we called over the hostess to get us a check and she was very apologetic, but still. Inexcusable.So basically a decent but underwhelming food experience, followed by horrible service. Will definitely not be returning.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

The cost on ingredients must be over the top, because the proportions are small on the pasta dishes. We split the dish and it was more like a tapas.The service was better once we seemed to have kissed and made up over me taking a call when he came over to greet us, but those calls pay the bills, I removed myself from the table for the call and when I was done returned. My guest was served his tea but we must have waited 10 minutes before he returned, mind you about 3 tables where seated, not a lot to do, when he returned I apologized for the call and smooth sailing from there... except I would have liked to know I was being charge 3.50 dollars for each glass of tea, I had even enquired as to who the importer of the tea was. My husband will never recover from that and I have had him in intense therapy since then.Great meal, a tad pretentious in the pasta department....how much can a nice plate of pasta cost?

Plus it's got a nice long bar that is perfect for a pre-dinner drink. The service is understated and the staff is very knowlegdable about what's on the menu, the daily specials, etc. They have a great selection of pastas, fish and meat.

I've been here multiple times and I love the atmosphere but most of the food is just average and my foodie mind is telling me if it wasn't such a great NYC  summer night vibe place I wouldn't go just for the food. That being said here I go. The attitude at the front always makes me laugh, are you really all that miserable? I have never had anything but bad tude given from whomever is perched at the Host stand, I can't figure this one out. We sat down and our waiter was pretty attentive given the chaos going on around us. It was packed and LOUD. Their wine list isn't bad and we decided to go with the uva di troia 'bottaccia' torre quarto '08 puglia which at $42 was a great choice. There were 3 of us so we decided to split some starters and order our own entrees. We ordered the salumi: prosciutto di parma, spicy coppa & cacciatorini which at $19 was a touch too expensive for what you got. It was good but definitely on the small side. They had a special insalata that had burrata, watermelon and potato's and this was fabulous, although again, a touch skimpy on the burrata. Our waiter suggested we also order the gnocchi for a secondi and I'm glad we did. They were puffy and perfect served with grape tomato's and parmesan all in a ton of brown butter sauce which probably is what made it so heavenly. For our entrees we had the pollo al forno, which if you come here someone at the table has to order it, the costine di maiale: pork ribs, snow peas & fennel and the manzo ai ferri: hanger steak, roasted shallots & chili salsa. The chicken was good, a HUGE portion but the breast wasn't as moist as I would like, the pork ribs were fabulous, what little I could wrestle from my friend and I didn't get to taste the hanger steak as my other friend didn't offer it. The entree portions are generous and all around a solid 3 1/2 stars. We also had to get the patate: potatoes, pecorino & rosemary because they are usually so fabulous but last night they fell a little flat. There wasn't enough rosemary a lot of the pieces were too well done for me and I like crispy! After all this, the gluttons that we are, we decided we needed dessert as well. We ordered some ice cream that had salty caramel sauce on it that I couldn't get enough of and basically a deconstructed ice cream sandwich with mint and chocolate cake, I wasn't a huge fan of that but my 2 companions were.

755,3XiTNZj1nBx73Ecb7adSOQ,Billy N.,3.0 star rating,"Stopped in here last night with the BF after taking a walk on the High Line. It was my first time, although he had been here before. We got a table right away with no wait. The place is pretty cool and you can tell it was converted from a garage. The meal was pretty good I have to say, although there is not a ton to choose from. To start off we ordered pasta. At first we were just going to split an order of the Pappardelle Bolognese (which was $16 on the menu - remember that). Our waiter said that we could get half-orders of all pasta dishes. So we thought why not get a half dish of the Bolognese and a half of the Bucatini Carbonara dish they had. Why not try the two and share them. So that is what we ordered. And I have to say, both were great, although the Bolognese was my favorite of the two. When it came to our entrees, I got the Skirt Steak, which came with some delicious sautéed onions in a wine sauce. The BF got the half roasted chicken, which according to our waiter was the best dish in the house. Both were excellent, as well as the side of carrots and peas we ordered. I would totally recommend both dishes. Also, they have a pretty extensive wine menu. Now, the one complaint I have is that when the bill came they charged us $14 for EACH of the half dishes of pasta. A full dish is $16, but a half is $14???? So we were charged a total of $28 for both half dishes! When we mentioned this to the waiter, he said something along the lines of ""Well, it is not really a half dish, more like two-thirds, and that is how we get people to try multiple things on the menu"". Ok, still, then shouldn't it be $10 per dish? And why did he not say that in the first place. Maybe it was our fault for not asking the price, but you would think a half dish would be half the amount. I'm not being unreasonable about that am I? Overall, I would come back here if I was in the area. It is a cool atmosphere, especially for the summer time when the huge garage doors can stay open, although perhaps it is a little loud (I would hate to live in the building across the street), and the food was tasty. Just beware of the half-dishes!",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

I'd probably say that the prices are too expensive for the food you get, but putting $$ aside, the food was awesome.We started off with the seared octupus, and it was amazing -- smoky, fishy/salty, and tender with the slightest crunch.

Both were so yummy, the BF and I ended up sharing our plates and picking at both...the chorizo was well-spiced and the gnocchi had a surprising kick to it.We ended the meal with their cheese platter -- the goats were great (read: strong and stinky :).Overall, I think the establishment and food are great, but I think the plates are overpriced for what they are and if I'm looking to spend $60+ per person, I'd probably explore other restaurants more before returning.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

I can't believe this place is still in business! What a joke! I went there on a beautiful day with a very special friend hoping to have a great lunch. We ordered Pomodoro with Ricotta. What we got for 16 dollars was 4 tomatoes, 2 completely green meaning UNRIPE, NOT green tomatoes cut into wedges, with a dusting of something that did not at all seem like ricotta but was so minimal that I really couldn't identify it, a bit of balsamic and a leaf of basil. The stone hard unripe tomatoes required a steak knife to cut and were really not edible. I couldn't even make up for it with the bread because none was offered. Judging by the faces of the patrons next to us were weren't the only ones highly disappointed with our selection as they ordered the same. The waiter needs a new career and an attitude adjustment. He never once came by and didn't serve the food. He really had an attitude about him like he was doing us a favor waiting on us. I know this attitude is the norm in the West Village but he took it to new levels of bad. Thank you Barbuto for a very disappointing dining experience that darkened an otherwise perfect day with a very special friend who I only see every few years.

792,QporOcT9XsVQgeVYScERKQ,Gourmet G.,4.0 star rating,"Chef Jonathan Waxman from Chez Panisse has headed east to Manhattan, and then west to the once unglamorous, now tres trendy meatpacking district, to open this casual trattoria. Windowed garage doors - which open to the street in warm weather - wrap around a huge industrial-looking dining room filled with schoolhouse tables and chairs. The menu fuses seasonal produce with rustic Italian country cooking. For starters - if available - try the shaved asparagus salad, sharp with pecorino vinaigrette, or lightly-dressed arugula with creamy chicken liver bruschetta. The spicy penne with braised rabbit was superb. Many of the entrees emerge from a wood-burning oven, with varying degrees of success. Pesto-slathered scallop skewers are perfectly cooked, buttery and sweet, although the meager count of three was more in keeping with an appetizer plate than a main course. Sea bass was drier than it should have been, and the lamb was slightly overcooked. Among the desserts, torte di limone is merely almond pound cake with a suggestion of citrus that's barely there, but the dark-chocolate pudding is phenomenal. The chef's table, separated from the dining room by a low partition, is just an arm's-length away from the small open kitchen and blazing oven. If no one has reserved it, and you can stand the heat, ask to sit there and watch the crew at work.

Jonathan Waxman walked around a bit and it was nice to see him - looks like a regular guy; don't know what I was expecting - lol.

I couldn't quite identify all the flavors, but the intensity and perfect melding of fresh black pepper and honey in the dressing was fabulous.We ordered the flank steak with chili salsa, and chicken with salsa verde, and be warned: the chicken plate is Huge with a capital ""H.""Both were delicious, and I think I can say that that was the most tender, juicy chicken roast I've ever had. But maybe because I'm not super-familiar with Italian cuisine, the entree's didn't seem quite Italian to me. Nevertheless,  a meal worthwhile.Oh yes - and we still managed to have dessert: Tiramisu and Chocolate pudding. Yummy in my tummy :-)Cons: Service was slightly slow.

My husband said the chicken was the best he's had...  And the ribs were just falling a part (in the GREAT way) - delicious.  There was SO MUCH meat...  We ended up taking 1/2 of it home...  Mostly because we ordered the corn with ricotta salada and the rosemary potatoes with pecorino as sides and we INHALED them.  Another review said the potatoes were heavy, which is very true, but they were the definitely the best potatoes I've ever put in my mouth, I would get them again in a second, even if it means I take the meat home for the next day:-).  It sounds from other reviews like the service can be mixed, but both times we've been there, our waiters have been very attentive, and last night, because I'm 5 months pregnant, I asked about a million questions about which cheeses were pastuerized, what each ingredient was, blah blah blah.  The waitress didn't know all the answers, but got responses from the chef immediately and was really pleasant about the whole thing.  All in all, a great place for a weeknight dinner or a special occassion.",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

Their appetizers are good, their pastas are fresh and flavorful, and the halibut I had was light, well textured, and interesting. Although it sometimes has its ups and downs (my friend's steak was overcooked and slightly tough) they do a good job of infusing their dishes with interesting salsas and sauces.

802,KK2sKw05NKeBMLPweAiX1g,Ted S.,4.0 star rating,"I went to Barbuto after reading the recent NYtimes review.  I had heard of the chef before (mostly in United States of Arugula) but I was unaware that he had a place in NY now.  The restaurant is in a nice space on a quiet west village avenue.  It feels and looks like a garage with rolling garage doors for walls and a large rectangular main room.  There are two semi private rooms (one of which has a great photograph of a whole swordfish) and an open visible kitchen.  The wine list is extensive but I thought a bit pricey.  The menu on the other hand is farly short, and if there were specials we weren't told about them.  We also never got bread until I asked for it after the entrees.  The meal was fine though as we skipped the so so app list and shared the cheese platter which had some nice but fairly common selections.  Maybe I'm weird but tallegio is not that exotic anymore... I have that on my bialys in the morning.  My friend got the rigatoni with cinghale which was tasty though the portion would not have been enough for me.  I went for the famous and relatively reasonably priced half chicken for $19.  This comes solo on a large oval plate dressed only in it's own juices and a little herb salsa verde.  It is a very well done chicken I have to say.  I personally think I prefer a more lively Latin American flavored bird like those you can get cheaply all over town but for a simple roast chicken it is hard to beat this.  While I didn't miss the bread before the food I found I really wanted some afterwards to mop up the chicken juice on my plate.  Overall a pleasant place to eat and a great chicken.  P.S. make sure to get some of the nuts at the bar... killer lightly roasted almonds and cashews",Barbuto,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Italian,, American, (New)"

Last ngt, we were so excited to do it again. The server told us that they really don't do it ""just for two ppl"" anymore. We were so disapointed, she went to check with the chef. They agreed to do it, but I felt like they were annoyed and only doing it so we weren't upset. I understand it is a lot of food for two people, but they could make the servings less if that's the issue. We were celebrating a special occasion and it kind of killed the moment and excitement.

814,f524HrlflBg6R0Im3pYFTQ,Jennifer L.,2.0 star rating,"I am giving Barbuto 2 stars, more for the atmosphere than for the food, unfortunately. I came here a couple years ago with a friend, but it was winter, so the place was closed up and cozy, and honestly, I can't remember much about that meal. This time I came with a group, and we were able to take advantage of a warm spring night. The West Village location is great, just far enough off the Meatpacking  District path, with the garage doors that open that make the whole place feel like you're outside. We had a 9pm res, but had to wait for about 15 min, which was odd because we were leaning up against the empty tables that were ultimately put together for our group. We ordered a couple of apps to start - the mussels and the bruschetta special, which had some wilted greens, some sort of creamy cheese, and stewed cherries on it. Yummy, but really tough to cut to share, since the greens were long and not cooperative. Both apps were pretty good, too bad things didn't pick up from there.We all ordered salads, everyone seemed to get either the salad of thinly sliced baby artichokes with argula, or the sliced fresh asparagus, which had a lot of other veggies in it. I had the former, which I thought was pretty good (I love arugula), and there seemed to be a lot of it, but it was nothing special. For entrees, everyone seemed to order pastas. One friend had the buccatini, a few of us had the linguini with asparagus and ramps, and others had the special pappardelle with ragu (can't remember if it was pork or what sort of meat). That looked good, but I was in a veggie sorta mood, and I love seasonal veggies, so I had the linguini. The asparagus could have used a few extra seconds of heat, as it was a little too raw for a pasta dish, IMHO, and the ramps were barely cooked at all, unfortunately. I love ramps, but I find the flavor comes out a lot more if you sautee them a bit longer. The ramps in my pasta were practically raw, just like the asparagus. Sad to say, this dish was far less than impressive.On top of the disappointing food, the service was rather slow. It took a noticably long time between courses. For a restaurant in this neighborhood, and for the money, I expected them to run a tighter ship.

Probably because the prices are decent, the food portions are generous and the wine isn't expensive. I like the roasted butternut squash dish and could eat two plates in one sitting.
