It's the only place I know in Hoboken that serves oxtail more than once a week (I'm looking at you...La Isla).Other than fulfilling my oxtail craving, I also decided to try the Mofongo de Chicharron, which are just mashed plantains with fried pork and garlic. I do recommend getting the oxtail dish...it was super delicious! I did enjoy the oxtail more than the mofongo as I felt the mofongo with the pork were a bit too dry for my taste. All the main entrees come with your choice of two sides. They have a variety of sides you can choose from, such as beans, rice, plantains, fries, salad, fried egg, veggie of the day, etc. Also, the prices here are very reasonable.Service here is very friendly and efficient. One thing to note is that space in here is pretty tight. I would say that this restaurant seats no more than about 10-15 people. It would be good for small groups.Look no further, I totally recommend coming here to get some Cuban food!",La Casa,4.5 star rating,$$,"Cuban,, Dominican,, Puerto, Rican"

It seemed that the customers were the regulars, who knew each other and the staff. We sat down near the bar area by the door. Space was very tight and they had to move the tables and chairs around to fit us.We ordered a beef empanada to share. It was crispy outside and tender & salty inside. I could use a little less salt but it was perfect for my husband. I ordered the pollo asado (rotisserie chicken) with sweet plantains and vegetables. The chicken was well roasted and pretty tender. Sweet plantains were soft and sweet and reminded me of Sophie's. Vegetables were pretty standard. My husband got oxtail stew with rice and eggs. Oxtail stew was very flavorful and tender.  The whole thing turned out about $25, which was very cheap for a sit-down dinner in Hoboken.",La Casa,4.5 star rating,$$,"Cuban,, Dominican,, Puerto, Rican"

They do not update their status so I don't even know if my order has been received. I call the restaurant and I get hung up on. 2. I called the customer service number who tells me they are on their way. Cool! I am hungry. I want my food. 3. I get food.. missing is the empanada, the cheese sauce I told them to keep is in there. And the bottle of sparkling water never made it, they substituted for club soda. I run after the delivery dude who disappeared to thin air. 4. Now I call customer service who calls the restaurant again. They come back with credit give me credit for the missing food. I am fuming!! I really wanted my food. I am good all week.

48,xSfFsXgwlAr0v1QqFq90hA,Mike M.,5.0 star rating,"Newcomer to Newark Street, adding yet another Cuban option to downtown Hoboken. Prices look very reasonable. Small place with maybe 6 2-tops, and 4 bar seats. I had the Pollo Guisado with 2 sides ($8 lunch special) and it was really tasty! A $2 beef empanada was, dare I say, almost/just as good as my all-time favorite at La Isla. I'm definitely going to keep coming back to try different dishes.",La Casa,4.5 star rating,$$,"Cuban,, Dominican,, Puerto, Rican"
49,UYU9e9p0JFC8QeQWS6JEvA,Adrian F.,5.0 star rating,Pollo de Camarillo was fantastic and savory. Yuca con mojo is definitely a side to try. Overall the place warm and welcoming. Staff is friendly and a nice place to have a cocktail after hours.This place just opened about a week ago and make a stop by and have lunch or dinner. Prices are very reasonable at about $8-10 per meal with sides.,La Casa,4.5 star rating,$$,"Cuban,, Dominican,, Puerto, Rican"
50,ueh43L04SWCcA979awaDlg,Clark W.,2.0 star rating,"I'm glad la casa isn't my permanent home for dining, that's for sure. We got off to a rough start my first time around. I sat on hold for 9 minutes while the gentleman that answered the phone had a full conversation with someone at the counter. None of the conversation was of grave importance - believe me, I heard the whole thing. The customer wasn't even leaving, they were eating there. Finally, I hung up after trying to yell into the phone a bit. I tried calling back and it rang without answer for over a minute before I came to the conclusion la casa wasn't in the cards for me that night. But, one bad experience isn't enough to shut me out from a place for good - it happens. So i figured I'd keep it on the radar. After a bad lunch special eaten by my roommate, I started to question whether I should give it a shot. But I had to. The yelpers deserved it. The fans clamored for it. So, alas, I made it to la casa for a meal after a stop at the gym across the street, looking for some quick protein and vegetables. I settled on the steak with onions entree and was pleased to find I could choose broccoli and carrots for sides. The broccoli was listed as the ""vegetable of the day"". Well, I think this batch of broccoli was also the ""vegetable of the day"" back when Obama was still in the Oval Office. Old. Hard. Discolored. Nothing you'd wanna eat. The steak was actually a decent size and pretty good, but I had to work around a ton of fat. It was poor quality meat. Still, enough to bring me from 1 to 2 stars, as I'm trying to be fair even though I am unlikely to return.",La Casa,4.5 star rating,$$,"Cuban,, Dominican,, Puerto, Rican"
51,p88Y7XY4Xl6E7K6P-1eq3g,Marilyn M.,4.0 star rating,"As a Latina I was elated to try some home cooking without being home. I was looking to treat myself on my walk home and saw the cute lookin exterior of this place. Drew me in. It looked like a cute café/library and that's hot to me. Cute but nerdy ... wait, this isn't a dating site. Anyway, I walk in before 4 and start my journey with a café con leche. I make small talk with an older gentlemen behind the counter who's demeanor could be a little nicer but I digress. I drink my coffee which was delicious and order a papa rellena. Both items $2 each. What a miracle. Cheap hispanic food in a highly gentrified town sprinkled with old school Latinos that Jones for a break in prices... you know, like the old times... when you used to walk bare feet in the snow with no shoes... the stories your parents tell you about. Anyway, I ordered to go some ropa vieja and white rice and black beans... damn that sh*t was good. And was 2 meals worth, made my co-workers jelly the next day. I went back a second time and started again with a café con leche and this time tried a beef empanada... let's just say my mother has competition. Try it for yourself. BYOB... but you don't need to drink to have a good time here. Salsa is always playing and the vibe is upbeat. Lookin. Forward to many noshes in the future.

It was cold out and their heat hasn't turned on yet so the waitress brought a personal heater for us.Food wise, I got huevos a la casa so potato, eggs, and a choice of ham or bacon. I could do without the ham- it looked like packaged processed meat ham. Lots of potatoes and eggs. Huge portions.

There have been many attempts to recreate the authentic food since Latin food came in Vogue. Most of these have failed terribly and are nothing like the real thing. La Casa succeeds in the atmosphere as well as the food. I have tried the pernil, the oxtail stew, the empanadas, the maduros, and the chiccarone; all of which were spot on delicious.

All the food came out within 10 minutes but tasted home-made and fresh.There's a small downside of the restaurant not having a wind-breaking structure outside the entrance, so gusts of cold air come in as people move in and out.Luckily, you can buy warm cookies after your meal at Insomnia Cookies.I would definitely recommend La Casa to friends and family.",La Casa,4.5 star rating,$$,"Cuban,, Dominican,, Puerto, Rican"
