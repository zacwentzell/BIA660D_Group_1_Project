Fast forward to a few nights ago!  Wow!!!!  What a difference. I was blown away!  The food and drinks were absolutely amazing. My friend and I had the artichoke dip and we both had a salad.  The atmosphere was great; like a party but no dancing involved. The food was hot and made to perfection.  The bread that came with the dip was toasted to perfection and had the perfect amount of butter. The salad had the perfect amount of chicken that was so juicy and tasty. In addition, the chicken was still warm as I ate the salad!!  The wontons in the salads were great!  The vegetables and peanuts in the salad was great. Wow!!!! Drinks - I think the bartender was heavy handed with the liquor (which I like and appreciate)!  The drink was delicious.  I think this place has the best ""fun"" drinks in the city.  The liquor didn't over power the sweetness of the drink. Yummy!!!In sum, I'm glad I came back and I'll be back again.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

It was fun to have the waiter wait for me to get my phone out to record before he started pouring the liquid concoction into the cup. However, I don't think this drink was worth $38 dollars.

The food is subpar, definitely not up to New York standards, but it's not what you go for. The service is great, and the ambiance is a blast. Ryan, our server, was SUCH a sweetheart. He takes care of everyone, sings hilarious birthday songs, and helps you decide just what drink you get - and then makes it for you! Spinach and artichoke dip - couldn't stop eating this! A bit greasy, but so damn good. Grilled chicken sandwich - my friend ordered this and said it was dry. She didn't look too happy with it. Comes with thin fries, which weren't bad. Sugar Factory signature salad - MEH. I am not exaggerating when I say I could've gotten better at Olive Garden. For $19?!? Child, please.  Sugar Factory cappuccino - covered with whipped cream, chocolate, and coconut. The decoration was cute, but not sure it's worth $11!!!

Goblet drinks, my coworkers and I had decided to come here for happy hour and to our surprise, almost every table has a birthday. Our waiter said he has about 20-50 birthdays in one shift. Nonetheless, due to the busyness of this place, it is recommended to make a reservation ahead of time if you want to sit at a table rather than a bar. We made the reservation a day prior, however we still had to wait for at least 15 minutes when we got here and they wouldn't seat us until everyone has arrived. The Goblet drinks were yummy and sweet. We got the lollipop passion infused with coconut and pineapple flavors. The drink has the liquid nitrogen that forms a cool vapor effect... when the vapor is gone, you can form more vapor by stirring the remaining nitrogen at the bottom...but just don't suck the liquid nitrogen. For food, we ordered the sampler platters, the mac & cheese pops, the rainbow sliders that came with a rubber ducky, the veggie burger, and more... the foods seem average however I really like the mac & cheese pops.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

We went on a Monday so it wasn't that busy, there were many reviews about how everyone has to be there or else you can't be seated. However, they let us get seated first which was actually pretty nice. The drinks were pretty nice, ordered a milk shake (Caramel Sugar Daddy Cheesecake). Took me a while to get a sip of it, the cheesecake on top was delicious. I also ordered a monster burger ( The Signature Sugar Factory Burger) which was not so good. I ordered it well done and I guess they cooked it way too long because the patty was so burnt. I would have understood if it was a little burned but it was so burned and dark. I thought I was the only one but my friends burgers were also burnt. Didn't really enjoy the burger as much as I thought I would.Would probably come back but I will probably never order a burger here again.

14,vg6wViGt3_ZDBPz-gYmoWQ,Dava P.,1.0 star rating,"This isn't a place for someone that is hungry. Upon walking in the waiting area is CROWDED with people waiting for seats, kids running around sampling candy and employees walking back and fourth. It needs an actual waiting area maybe with a couple seats that's a little more spacious.I came here yesterday around 4 for a birthday which the rude woman who was checking in couldn't find. She kept saying I don't see it I don't see it until we showed her an email. She didn't even apologize. Horrible customer service. I've worked in customer service for a while, I know how to treat customers. Even when it's busy and sometimes they aren't being the nicest.  We finally got seated in the downstairs area. Which was freeeeeezing. Even when loads of larger parties kept coming it, the area stayed cold. I believe there was only two servers down there, we had Kimbella who was very nice. She couldn't be very attentive because she had a lot of other people to take care of so I understand. The manager should've stepped in and added an extra bus boy or something to fill everyone's water glasses or something because I never got one refill of my water. I don't know if this man was the manager but he had a suit on and was just standing there giving orders. Too afraid to get your nice suit dirty with some sour sugar? Anyways, the $36 jumbo drinks that taste likeClub soda was a dub. No liquor. I didn't order it but my cousins did, all the other drinks were very watery I heard too. I think the only good thing was the milk shake my cousin had. I had the buffalo sandwich and the Chinese chicken salad. Me and my sister split this. The sandwich wasn't good, tomatoes tasted funny and it was falling apart. The salad was overly over dressed. Horrible.I will repeat, the employees in the downstairs area were not rude and sang a cute happy birthday song. But sadly, I don't even think the experience of this place is worth the crowd and price and hassle.So expensive for no reason. Please no one come here, save your money and go somewhere else.---------------UPDATE: I was asked to come back and change my review/stars in exchange for $100 off my bill. Still not worth it!

As of 10/17 the Goblets are $36-$39 with liquor. Ours were pretty strong! Our server did wait until we were ready to pour our drinks.Food was tasty as well I enjoyed my turkey burger and my brother the steak frites. Waiter was friendly service is quick too.

17,wzjMQhYwf4bHL8QGtn8HOw,Esther L.,3.0 star rating,"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. I went a couple of years ago for a birthday and had a great time. I was amazed by the size of the goblets and enjoyed the novelty of this restaurant. Now a couple years later; I wanted to take a good friend of mine for dinner to experience this restaurant because I had fond memories of it. Perhaps because we were older the same kitsch that was fun a couple of years ago wasn't as exciting now. This is a great restaurant for a birthday but not if you're looking for a quiet setting. There were about five birthday songs that went on throughout our meal.When I entered the restaurant, the hostess told me that she could not seat me until my friend arrived. It was a little annoying since the waiting area is small and you end up standing shoulder to shoulder with people. However, I understand that this restaurant gets booked quickly so they need all the tables that are available. When my friend arrived, we were directed to go upstairs and wait for another hostess. We were seated shortly after. I thought with the waiting time and the volume of the restaurant that our meal would progress slowly but the service was surprisingly fast. As we were waiting for our drink and meal, I looked around and noticed that almost everyone in the restaurant were either teenagers or a family with children. I found this a little unsettling as I came to know this restaurant as an establishment that was known for their alcoholic drinks. I think the next time I want to see my friend, I'll choose a more age-appropriate restaurant. My friend and I split a watermelon goblet. They really are huge and could even be enough for three people. I laughed when our waiter was about to pour the drink and told us to get our phones out to post a video and photos to Instagram. He wasn't wrong; this is definitely an Instagram worthy restaurant. The drinks smoke with liquid nitrogen. Ours was filled with watermelon candy and taffy. I enjoyed the club sandwich that I ordered. It was a bit expensive for a club sandwich but it was packed full and came with good French fries. My friend enjoyed her berry crepe. I would still recommend this restaurant for the fun that it can bring for a young crowd. It is expensive but the drinks are fun to show off. I understand why I liked it when I was younger and I also understand why it wasn't the best fit a couple years later.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

Goblet drinks, my coworkers and I had decided to come here for happy hour and to our surprise, almost every table has a birthday. Our waiter said he has about 20-50 birthdays in one shift. Nonetheless, due to the busyness of this place, it is recommended to make a reservation ahead of time if you want to sit at a table rather than a bar. We made the reservation a day prior, however we still had to wait for at least 15 minutes when we got here and they wouldn't seat us until everyone has arrived. The Goblet drinks were yummy and sweet. We got the lollipop passion infused with coconut and pineapple flavors. The drink has the liquid nitrogen that forms a cool vapor effect... when the vapor is gone, you can form more vapor by stirring the remaining nitrogen at the bottom...but just don't suck the liquid nitrogen. For food, we ordered the sampler platters, the mac & cheese pops, the rainbow sliders that came with a rubber ducky, the veggie burger, and more... the foods seem average however I really like the mac & cheese pops.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

However, they let us get seated first which was actually pretty nice. The drinks were pretty nice, ordered a milk shake (Caramel Sugar Daddy Cheesecake). Took me a while to get a sip of it, the cheesecake on top was delicious. I also ordered a monster burger ( The Signature Sugar Factory Burger) which was not so good. I ordered it well done and I guess they cooked it way too long because the patty was so burnt. I would have understood if it was a little burned but it was so burned and dark. I thought I was the only one but my friends burgers were also burnt. Didn't really enjoy the burger as much as I thought I would.Would probably come back but I will probably never order a burger here again.

Upon walking in the waiting area is CROWDED with people waiting for seats, kids running around sampling candy and employees walking back and fourth. It needs an actual waiting area maybe with a couple seats that's a little more spacious.I came here yesterday around 4 for a birthday which the rude woman who was checking in couldn't find. She kept saying I don't see it I don't see it until we showed her an email. She didn't even apologize. Horrible customer service. I've worked in customer service for a while, I know how to treat customers. Even when it's busy and sometimes they aren't being the nicest.  We finally got seated in the downstairs area. Which was freeeeeezing. Even when loads of larger parties kept coming it, the area stayed cold. I believe there was only two servers down there, we had Kimbella who was very nice. She couldn't be very attentive because she had a lot of other people to take care of so I understand. The manager should've stepped in and added an extra bus boy or something to fill everyone's water glasses or something because I never got one refill of my water. I don't know if this man was the manager but he had a suit on and was just standing there giving orders. Too afraid to get your nice suit dirty with some sour sugar? Anyways, the $36 jumbo drinks that taste likeClub soda was a dub. No liquor. I didn't order it but my cousins did, all the other drinks were very watery I heard too. I think the only good thing was the milk shake my cousin had. I had the buffalo sandwich and the Chinese chicken salad. Me and my sister split this. The sandwich wasn't good, tomatoes tasted funny and it was falling apart. The salad was overly over dressed. Horrible.I will repeat, the employees in the downstairs area were not rude and sang a cute happy birthday song. But sadly, I don't even think the experience of this place is worth the crowd and price and hassle.So expensive for no reason.

37,wzjMQhYwf4bHL8QGtn8HOw,Esther L.,3.0 star rating,"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. I went a couple of years ago for a birthday and had a great time. I was amazed by the size of the goblets and enjoyed the novelty of this restaurant. Now a couple years later; I wanted to take a good friend of mine for dinner to experience this restaurant because I had fond memories of it. Perhaps because we were older the same kitsch that was fun a couple of years ago wasn't as exciting now. This is a great restaurant for a birthday but not if you're looking for a quiet setting. There were about five birthday songs that went on throughout our meal.When I entered the restaurant, the hostess told me that she could not seat me until my friend arrived. It was a little annoying since the waiting area is small and you end up standing shoulder to shoulder with people. However, I understand that this restaurant gets booked quickly so they need all the tables that are available. When my friend arrived, we were directed to go upstairs and wait for another hostess. We were seated shortly after. I thought with the waiting time and the volume of the restaurant that our meal would progress slowly but the service was surprisingly fast. As we were waiting for our drink and meal, I looked around and noticed that almost everyone in the restaurant were either teenagers or a family with children. I found this a little unsettling as I came to know this restaurant as an establishment that was known for their alcoholic drinks. I think the next time I want to see my friend, I'll choose a more age-appropriate restaurant. My friend and I split a watermelon goblet. They really are huge and could even be enough for three people. I laughed when our waiter was about to pour the drink and told us to get our phones out to post a video and photos to Instagram. He wasn't wrong; this is definitely an Instagram worthy restaurant. The drinks smoke with liquid nitrogen. Ours was filled with watermelon candy and taffy. I enjoyed the club sandwich that I ordered. It was a bit expensive for a club sandwich but it was packed full and came with good French fries. My friend enjoyed her berry crepe. I would still recommend this restaurant for the fun that it can bring for a young crowd. It is expensive but the drinks are fun to show off.

The food choices were ok and everything was edible except for one dish Mediterranean Chicken  pappardelle, that was literally soaking in butter! And although we ordered it without the chicken, we had to pay the same price (not very customer oriented). Our table had steak frites a variety of Hamburgers and pastas. The burgers took the prize! At an average cost of $20 with French Fries, this is your best bet. Don't forget that the average cocktail goblet is about $38 so your burger and drink will run you $58.

This location (in the Meatpacking District) could not accommodate this request..So I'm like okay fine. How about an item on the menu (as I pointed to one of the cakes)..The server took the order and came back and said ""I'm sorry we are out of that item""I'm like ""wow.. okay, how about this..."" (as I pointed to another-less enticing item)... only for the server to come back again and say that he wasn't able to sell that because they were out of the ice cream. Whaaaaa?? Really??? Huh??? How??They even told my friend the same thing who ordered a milkshake so they had to use a different kind of ice cream to create my friends' shake.So I go on to select the red velvet dessert and guess what? Take a wild guess....You ready?? THEY WERE OUT OF THAT DESSERT TOO!At this point I'm just about over it. The server suggests that I speak with the manager for my troubles. So the manager comes over, very apologetic, and offers to make me his very special ice cream sandwich. Minutes later, that dessert comes back looking like a cookie soup!

What an adorable little surprise! We had the same waiter as last time, his name is Gregory... ask for him, great mannerism and attentive towards his customers. We started off with ordering our drinks, Mai Tai goblets, and ordered their appetizer sampler. When our drinks came they poured it into huge bowls and at the bottom is dry ice for the cool effect. Once we tasted our drinks, they were V E R Y strong! Definitely could get you drunk. When the appetizer sampler came it included mac and cheese balls, chicken wings, chicken tenders and onion rings. This was my first time trying their food and I was impressed with how everything tasted! I enjoyed it.For our entrees, we ordered the fettuccine alfredo and the big cheesy burger in medium well. When our orders came out, it was in huge portions so we had some leftovers to take home since we couldn't finish it. When I had my big cheesy burger (mac and cheese burger) it tasted so good. The burger didn't taste dry at all either. I give the burger a thumbs up! To end the night my boyfriend and I ordered their s'mores fondue. I like it better than the hazelnut fondue.

We had a reservation for 6:30pm., we were not seated until around 7pm. While we were taken to our table we noticed the lady seating next to our table, accompanied by her family,  mumbling unpleasant things. She was saying "" I can't seat next to these Puerto Rican looking people, I don't like them, among other things"", she got up and asked one of the people in her table to change seats with her. My co-workers and myself were confused as to whether she was referring to us, we paid no attention and decided to take our seats, until we noticed we were given a table for four instead of five. I decided to go to the person in the front desk to ask her for a table that will fit all of us. While I was talking to the person in the front desk the lady who was upset wearing next to us went crazy. All you were able to hear was her screaming and cursing. Her reaction was insane. She came downstairs towards the exit door and was yelling ""every f$&@ing time I go to a place I have to deal with these f$&@ing people"". She left the restaurant but her family stated. The person helping me get a larger table came with me upstairs to try to accommodate my co-workers and myself. She was going to try to fit us in the same table as before, my co-worker explained to the waiter that the lady started acting up when she saw us seating next to her, and requested a different seating section. The guy understood and took us to their ""private seating area"". (Not private at all)!!Anyway, we order our drinks and food. I can't complain on the appetizers nor the drinks but the food OMG!! I order the Pacific Salmon. This plate tasted like a lemonade!! It was probably the worst Salmon I've ever had. One of my co-workers ordered a burger with fries which was eatable. Others ordered Pasta which they said it was ok.

From the reviews, I figured the food wouldn't be amazing, but the drinks and desserts would be outstanding and also super cute. The food wasn't terrible, and had the desserts been anywhere near what we were expecting, I may have looked the other way. That's not to say that mediocre food at this price is excusable. Really, if you're charging $19 for a burger and $25+ for fettuccine alfredo with a few pieces of chicken, there's really no reason that everything shouldn't be outstanding. My big issue was dessert. We ordered what was supposed to be an adorable shake. The photo showed a cone covered in chocolate and popcorn, and just a great looking arrangement in general. What we got was a pathetic version of it, chocolate dripping down the side (no spoon to eat it with though), a few pieces of popcorn stuck to it, and a plain cone with some sprinkles on top. Thankfully it had the lollipop, otherwise my daughter would've been even more disappointed. Sadly, the taste wasn't much better than the presentation, I've had much better shakes elsewhere, and it felt like a good bit of it was simply whip topping.

We still had to wait about 15 minutes from when are reservation was made. We were a party of 5, sat close to the bar. It was loud but turned into some entertainment. The bartenders knew how to juggle bottles. Thats one star I gave, it was entertaining. Cool drinks were made for us, we ordered mai tais. Another star for cool drinks. It was hard to get the waiters attention though. It seemed like if you paid for the expensive sundaes they attended to those tables. We requested a slice of cream cheese cake for $18..for my sister's birthday.  It took about three requests to have it come out, after 6 $99 sundae shoutouts. We had reservations for 7:30, left at almost 10. Didn't even really eat, just ordered appetizers & drinks. Nice experience (another star), no star for service or friendly ness. Oh and for 5 people the tip was added on for 18%!  LOL",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"
65,D0ZxDalBFfD1bkiIYjjLTw,Rosemary V.,3.0 star rating,"They get 2.5 stars but I will round it off to 3. I came here for a friend's birthday on a Sunday around 1:00pm.Ambiance: Place is super-packed. Decor includes candies and pictures of celebrities. They play top 40 and EDM music making you feel like you are at a party brunch. But you quickly realize this is no party brunch since there are kids everywhere. Yes I know it is a sugar factory, but I do think they should make the downstairs Adults only. The bathroom line downstairs can get extremely long and it was weird for a place that services so many kids to have a bathroom wallpaper with drawings of half-naked people on it. Another reason for why the downstairs should be adults only.Service: We were not allowed to sit until our whole party was there. After standing by the entrance for 15 minutes, they finally took us downstairs to sit by the bar while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. I really think they should invest in designing a waiting area with comfy seats and couches. Our waitress was really nice and friendly.Food and drinks: I had the watermelon martini and for $16 it did not have enough alcohol but it was tasty (it is 90% sugar). Some of the other girls shared a goblet, I tasted the watermelon (it was too sweet) and the long island (was pretty strong but at least you get your money's worth). This drink is huge and should be shared. It was concerning watching children drink a whole goblet by themselves (sugar overload). They should post drinks prices on their menu. So remember, drinks are $16-38!For food I had the turkey burger; it was kind of dry but I did like the mushroom. The fries were delish. Like others mentioned, for the price, the quality of the food is low. The birthday girl ordered the 22 scoop ice cream Sunday which pretty much includes all you think can of (ice cream, rice crispy, gummy bears, pretzels, Oreos). It was pretty yummy but a little too much. They should come up with a system where people can take some of this to go because no one can really finish this. I had a headache after I left, our body is not meant for all this sugar.I had a good time but mainly due to the company.

My friend visited Sugar Factory is Las Vegas and I was so envious of her photos. Needless to say, I knew I had to get a goblet. Obviously my friend and I didn't know there were 10 shots in a goblet so we both ordered one.We came around 2-3 PM and only had to wait 5-10 minutes without reservations. The server was friendly and attentive. I ordered the watermelon one and my friend got the lollipop passion. I finished 3/4 of mine and then swapped with my friend because she wasn't much of a drinker. The lollipop one was so gross. I hate coconut Malibu and it tasted exactly like that. I asked the server if he could do anything to make it taste less gross and he added pineapple juice. It helped a bit but was still gross.We also ordered a sundae. It was whatever. Should have ordered something savoury though. At that point we were definitely feeling the alcohol and realized why most only finished half of their goblets and left. Then, we ordered a side of fries. They were good to munch on but nothing special. We felt kinda sick from all the sugar and alcohol so decided to leave.One of the bussers was annoying af and kept trying to make moves. Not about that. He kept asking where we were going after, where my phone was so he could give me his number, and trying to invite himself into our plans. No, no, no. You can clear the table for us and make polite conversation, but please, move it along, especially when someone is clearly not interested. I'm still rolling my eyes... definitely made for an uncomfortable, annoying experience.

I was here on a Friday around 8pm.Yes this place attracts birthday goers and yes you'll hear the servers sing happy birthday to almost every single table, but get passed all that and you can enjoy their delicious food. Appetizers: Baked brie wrapped in puff pastry is excellent. Do get this dish! It's a deconstructed apricot jam, apple slices, brie puff, & toast. Put it altogether in one bite and it's a well balanced dish. The popcorn shrimp surprisingly was not popcorn sized. The shrimp was large, but the flavor was pretty basic. Entree:The south beach flair burger was tasty. If you love plantains then you'll love this burger (thanks to our server, Jeremiah for the recommendation). Never had such a combination before, but with the angus beef, carmelized onions, chipotle mayo and chimichurri sauce made quite the perfect burger. They have other unique burger toppings such as the pizza burger and the white chocolate burger, which sounded interesting. The 6oz filet was good, but the huge serving of yukon gold mashed potatoes was so creamy & buttery I couldn't stop eating it.

76,Ok1dQhsagG4woh9dhHSiCg,Amit J.,2.0 star rating,"Decided to come to the Sugar Factory after hearing about their Goblet drinks. I'd strongly recommend making a reservation -- we came here 15 minutes early for our reservation and still spent 45 minutes waiting for a table. Make a reservation (or sit at the bar) and go only to try their special drinks and milkshakes, food isn't that great. Entire experience was unfortunately underwhelming. - Drinks: It seems that the Sugar Factory is known for their Goblet Drinks. Which is essentially served in a fish bowl like 60-ounce glass with dry ice and decorated with candy alongside or inside the glass. When the server pours the drinks in the glass and it reacts to the dry ice, it forms a cool vapor effect rising out of the glass. They don't list the price anywhere on the menu, but an a Goblet with alcohol is $36. I was torn between the signature Lollipop Passion Goblet or the Watermelon Raspberry Mojito (Fruit Juices, Silver Rum and topped with Watermelon Candy and Fresh Mint Leaves) ($36) and dedicated to go with mojito at the suggestion of the way. It was a cool experience getting the drink and watching the reactions to the dry ice. Aside from that, the drink was mediocre at best -- it tasted ok and it seemed that a quarter of it was just the dried ice. I'd recommend to order the Goblets for the experience and not the drink itself. - Food: We mainly went for drinks and treats, so opted for a couple appetizers instead of a full meal. We ordered the Fried Macaroni and Cheese Pops (Homemade Macaroni and Cheese, Battered and Deep Fried and served with a Creamy Tomato Herb Sauce) ($12), Bruschetta ($9) and a Basket of Fries ($6). The Mac and Cheese Pops were good, especially with the delicious Tomato Herb Sauce they came with, but honestly nothing exceptional. We also ordered the Chocolate Cookie Jar Milkshake (Vanilla Soft Serve Icr Cream blended with Oreo Cookie Crumbles, Chocolate Chips, Caramel Sauce, Pure Melted Chocolate Sauce and Topped with Oreo Cookies and Whipped Cream) ($10). This was absolutely delicious, it was smooth, creamy and a good balance between vanilla and chocolate. - Service:  I had mixed reactions about the service. We ended up coming 15 minutes earlier than our reservation, but ended up having to wait a total of 45 minutes for a table for two even with a reservation which I found to be unfortunate. What troubled me more so was that a couple who came about twenty minutes late for their reservation was able to be seated at the first table that opened over us and another couple who were either on time or early for our reservations. In regards to our waiter, she was absolutey nice, friendly and generally provided good service. She also was great in allowing us to enjoy the experience of the Goblet, and waited to pour the drinks until we were ready. - Overall: I would go here once for the experience or have a friend visiting from out of state but this truly is a tourist trap with underwhelming experience (food and service seem subpar) and overpriced food and drink items. You'd probably be better off sitting at the bar and ordered just drinks and sweets there (advise against food here).

77,jOncNjLZMCEX-ssnnr4oIQ,Gaby K.,1.0 star rating,"I went to Sugar Factory for my birthday with my closest friends, and the experience was so horrible that I had to apologize for inviting them. My reservation was for Monday night (October 9) for 5:00pm, booked on OpenTable a week or two before the date. When we were asked to wait to be seated, I had no issue as I thought they were simply looking for our table. Imagine my surprise when we had to wait just under an hour to be seated the same time as people who came in without a reservation. Was there a point in changing my birthday plans to make a 5PM reservation work since it was the only available one?I sat down and tried to put the wait behind me, but the same woman who took so long to seat us disappeared after doing so. At busy restaurants you want to order quickly because food may take a while to come - except we didn't have any menus. After 10 minutes of trying to call waiters (who were busy with other tables) we got our menus. There were 9 of us, yet we only got 7 menus, and even though I asked for 2 more we were never given them. Our server DJ had an uplifting personality, so I tried to ignore the events. That turned out to be a disappointment, just like the first time.Once we our goblets came (we ordered 3 and 3 people shared each goblet) they were spilling out contents because they seem to have been overfilled. Within minutes our table was a mess, but thanks to our waiter we had 3 paper napkins to clean it up. Obviously this didn't work, and we had to finish our drinks on a sticky table. I would also like to note that we were not given any silverware, so we had no cloth to wipe the liquid.We ordered our food the same time as our goblets and asked that they all be given at the same time since some were appetizers and others were entrees. Yet, the dishes came separated, with the appetizers coming last. Half of our table was eating while the other half sat awkwardly without anything.My order of chicken strips/fingers (don't remember the exact wording but it was an appetizer for $13) came and it was good - earning Sugar Factory it's one star in this review. I tried to eat it while having a conversation with my guests, but loud EDM music being played repeatedly at full volume distracted us. Every few minutes there would be a beat drop and music that gave us a headache. At one point I could even hear a commercial playing, which was odd to me.When our night finally came to an end, I was embarrassed that I brought my friends to such a place. I apologized to them and even paid the entire $45 ""auto 18% tip"" because I felt that they hadn't been treated well enough to have to pay that. We were also told that this tip did not entirely go to our waiter, who was one of the only highlights of our trip, so on top of that we gave him a tip.All in all, I was excited for my first time at the Sugar Factory and chose it as a special placed to celebrate my birthday. However, I was met with rude staff, ear-piercing music, and a messy atmosphere. I wish I could say your restaurant lived up to the hype, but these factors simply ruined it for me.

When we walked into Sugar Factory it was full of great energy as usual. The decor still has that cool vibe which includes colorful displays and spectacular chandeliers! The candy area is still near the front door and it includes such an awesome selection of delightful sweet treats! Across the street has a lovely view and it is beautifully lit up at night!Because the reservation was made earlier in the day, we waited about 5 minutes before we were seated which was wonderful. Sugar Factory had always been extremely accommodating which is to be commended since this place is very busy with many customers....Che was our server last night. He was kind, patient and constantly ensured that we were ok. He brought us all of our dishes. One of them was the Macaroni + Cheese Pops that you receive when you check in on Yelp which is nice. Boy, did I start feeling like a ate a full meal after comsuming the Macaroni + Cheese Pops!-lol. Everything was enjoyable from the Watermelon Burst Cocktail to the Steak w/ Fries. My guest raved about their sandwich and fries and the Make A Wish Milkshake. Staff came alive as they carried desserts to various tables and sang Hapoy Birthday to patrons with infectious positive energy! It is important to highlight the Managers Corinthian and Samantha as well as mention the server Che once again. We received the bill towards the end of our visit and Corinthian made it his mission to take care of us and fix our bill. Samantha was so lovely and pleasant.

The buffalo chicken sandwich my friend said was extremely spicy but she enjoyed it. My burger was great. I was a little adventurous, the burger had a fried egg in it, which is something new for me, so I was a little nervous, but wow. It was good.

Lets start by describing the place, very nice, nice decoration, nice ambiance, it was loud but fun, what do you expect ? kids come here,  its the sugar factory!! When we walked in,  we had reservations (months) ahead of time,  it was disorganized, so many people were waiting, it was crowded, kids were grabbing candie with theirs bare hands out the containers around the entrance, when you are supposed to grab them with gloves. I noticed some staff members were trying  theirs best to accomodate everyone but some other ones were just plain rude towards people, Good thing, that was not our experience but some other family. Once we were about to be seated, it was chaotic,  one of the assistant manager  (Angel) wanted to give us a made up table of four and forced it for a party of six, when we questioned this , he said that was the table we were assigned and that the other tables are for reservations, at this point we explained to him,  WE DO have reservations!! After the whole incident, he placed us in a more appropriate corner booth table by the bar, the whole incident with the table was very frustrating, and the reason why i removed the star(s), we ordered food, appetizers and gigantic drinks, we could make the drinks virgin as well. THE FOOD was amazing no complains At ALL!!, We had onion rings,  buffalo wings with sauce and no sauce, spinach artichoke dip, all as appetizers, everything was to die for !!! I mean it, we ordered 2 burgers entrees , 2 steak platters , two pastas dishes, AMAZING!!! Drinks they all have different names, i dont remeber the exact names but their flavor, we ordered the 60 oz, i had their signature, lollipop something, very good, watermelon was awesome, the mango and peach was really good too, the least favorite was the mai thai, No one in my table liked it so i do not recomend it. Our waiter was very good , unfortunately i dont recall his name, he made the whole experience remarkable and unique, thank you so much!! he was attentive and funny, lastly  the bill for six people and gratuity included came out over six hundred dollars and we added extra fifty dollars because the waiter was cool, very nice memory for a  twenty two year old birthday,",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

The sun was setting and shining through the windows, lovely you say? Nope guess again ...think blazing sun and heat shining in your eyes. They ran out of Heineken and peach flavoring so several drinks were not available. The alcoholic root beer float was delicious! The goblet drink lollipop passion was a coconut rum mixture of sweet sweet sweet but I could see how a 13 year old would get a kick out of the dry ice effect, lol they serve it non-alcoholism too! The food was ok nothing better than your average diner...the fries were delicious. The desserts were good the classic sundae for two was just that.

However the peanut butter chocolate ice cream  chocolate chip cookie not so good as no one could break the cookie...although we all tried stabbing at it repeatedly with a spoon. Now sadly the wait staff wasn't on point. Two of our drinks sat on the bar for 15 minutes before I got up and brought them to the table. So this is the new trendy place for wicked over the top desserts. I think anyone from 5-15 might get s kick out of it, other than that if I had an urge for ice cream I'd go to Baskin Robbins and have a sundae.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

89,WA9HvlweUeiGWxAAMNIUvQ,Mardory V.,4.0 star rating,"Super cute, overpriced, sugar and spice better suited for having a girl's night out or, as you will certainly discover within minutes, celebrating a birthday. If you have diabetes or food restrictions, or lack a sweet tooth then make sure to eat beforehand. Sugar reigns supreme here and the quality of it is high. The energy is superb and fun, and the service is jovial but effective. Our waiter was a total professional and earned every dollar over 20%. He accommodated our constantly growing group without a hitch and was always genuinely pleasant.The food was surprisingly better than expected and varied. I had the branzino while others ordered burgers with fries and the chicken alfredo.  However the safest bet is to stick with the insanely, huge, sugary sweet desserts that easily weigh a pound each and are strictly for sharing. (They can provide to-go containers if you are unable to finish the slice of cheesecake/lollipops/etc that comes with your milkshake or other such situations.)Do it to say you did or to see if you survive the sugar high.

We were intrigued with the bubbles and dry ice smoke coming from other people's bowls sitting in the outdoor patio area so thought we'd give it a try. We just had 2 of us so seating was easy at the bar. First impression was this place is really sweet smelling and everything was sticky, especially the menu. Every page was sticky and I had to grab the page on the corners. We ordered this orange passionfruit bowl since it seemed the less sweetest (which is saying a lot considering it's a candy store and sweet drink kind of place). Didn't see any prices but we thought how expensive can it be? Well the bowl was $39 bucks! Holy cow!! I mean I know NY is more expensive for drinks but wow. It was a experience though and our waiter was really sweet (took a bunch of pictures for us after he saw us struggling to get a selfie with the smoking drink too and also gave us nice pour of vokda at the end too and we definitely tipped him well). Would have given more start but given the price and how sticky everything was, that kind of did it. Oh and as we left we saw the wall of fame celebrity pictures.

However, I have to admit, the dry ice was a very nice touch. We decided to share the fried chicken and Mac and cheese which was delicious! The other dishes on the menu also looked good.

97,RH-Q_YgiErOCqAEynBotlg,Adeline C.,5.0 star rating,"Updated review:This is what you call a good customer service.  After my first disaster visit I posted my honest review of the place and then was contacted by one of the managers to see what they can do to rectify the situation.  Over the course of a few month I finally made it back to the joint and give it another try.  This time we went to celebrate my niece's 18th birthday.  From the very beginning I asked the front desk if we can be seated either in the first or second floor floor and not the basement and they were very accommodating.  The waiting area where all the candies are are much more lit up and also the inventory is much more appealing than the last time. Once we were seated upstairs which another big party (about 25 ppl) came up after us.  I was afraid the last scenario would happen again where our orders will be delayed and we will wait forever.  It didn't happen.  We ordered few goblet drinks which is the main reason why anyone is there.  Few appetizers and few main courses.  My server Genesis was wonderful and like the last time I was there as well, never had any problem with their staff, they are ultra accommodating knowing this is a tourist spot. The drinks came 10 mins after we ordered it and the food about the same.  My son even commented that we didn't wait as long as the last time.  I had to convince him to come back with me as well since he didn't like the last visit as well.  My niece loved everything but tbh it is a loud place which is understandable.  It is a party place not a quiet romantic dinner place.  Birthday songs and screams goes off every few mins.  The food was good, we ordered the Mac and Cheese pop, chicken fingers ( which was surprisingly awesome),  Charcuterie plate, calamari, savory crepe, Chicken and waffle, and Salmon salad.  Everything was satisfactory considered it is not the main attraction.  The drinks itself did not disappoint as the whole show is around it.  My mom, the kids loved every min of it and good time was had by all.  Bravo to the customer service department to reach out and ratify the situation which save this client from being an one time client.  Thank you and we had a much better time this time around. *****************************************************It is a one time visit thing.  A place you can say been there done that. We surprised our niece for her 15th birthday, low key family celebration. Made a reservation and I know from other reviews that there's a wait even with the reservation so no big deal, out party didn't fully assembled until 45 mins pass the reservation time so we couldn't check in until everyone was there so not their fault.  While waiting I was ready to drop down some money at the candy store.  What a disappointment.  If you have been to Dylan's Candy Bar then you will be highly disappointed.  Who set up shop? I mean my local bodegas has better display than that place.  I wanted to buy and spent money since I was waiting but I didn't drop a dime.  And the teenagers? They tried hard, and they came away with a small bag of Swedish fish in different  the colors. Ha! The wait for the table was not bad and we were seated in the basement. Our sever was great but we had to remind her of silver wares and they ran out of the spoons ( by desert time) and a gluten free menu for one member of our party. I swipe that off being that it is busy.  While there they were about 15 happy birthday songs sang within the 4 hours ( yes 4) we were there.  So this is the place for that kind of celebration. The good came, the appetizers are no better than your local bar, some ppl in my party orders the burgers and they liked it.  I got a French onion soup and a Chinese chicken salad sent both of them back and didn't get a replacement. The soup was iffy, I had many ( in Paris too) but something was off and I didn't want to take a chance getting sick, the Chinese chicken salad was too salty! Now those who knows me laugh when I said this but after a tasting from everyone they all agreed.  So I ended up eating my little ones sliders.  Talk about a puck in a bun, that is exactly what it was.  I had to lather with ketup and wash it down.  Finally desert time, oh we did order the famous goblet for the kids ( non alcoholic is $30) and they loved it and that's the reason why we were there so they can post pictures of them with the goblet on IG.  Anyway we waited over another hour for the dessert! The kids were getting restless and finally I got the manager's attention and they eventually came. So what's positive? The manager did the right thing by taking the dessert off  the bill and the kids got their IG photo from this place so they can brag and the server was cool. That's is it.  Everything else was horrible. So go as you like but keep the expectation to a minimum.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"
98,lPNNrmFVEWoPKAMK3Zz26w,Angel M.,3.0 star rating,"Sugar Factory is great for those just turning 21, or those looking to have some fun and cool drinks. I have eaten here on two separate occasions recently, and on both occasions, the overpriced drinks were way better than the food. This restaurant is almost always packed, so reservations are a must. When you first walk in, there is a wall filled with candy and candy dispensers. What is really cool about this is there are some 'Sugar Factory' unique candies that usually come with the drinks, but area available for purchase there. The restaurant looks really nice, the chandeliers are a very nice touch in both the day and the night time, and at night it has more of a date night feel. Dim lights, chandeliers, candles, and noise. If you are going for brunch, you will still need a reservation, but we were a few minutes late and they had no problem accommodating us. Coming on the weekends in the evening may not be the same case. When I went for brunch, my girls and I shared a drink and some appetizers (chicken tender basket), and I ordered the waffles. The 'chicken and waffles' was a but underwhelming, and the others seemed to feel the same about their entrees. Just a warning that the stuffed Strawberry french toast is not what you would typically see, but a pocket of dough with strawberry filling in the middle. Takes a while to come out but not always completely done.The drinks are fun. Not necessarily strong, but have great flavors, and come with candy ($1.50 extra if the drink of your choice does not come with Candy, but you still want it.When I came for dinner, I skipped the drink and ordered the pasta & Bolognese sauce. Not as flavorful as I would have thought -- I was hoping the meat sauce would be a bit more savory/salty. Maybe its because I skipped the cheese on top but I would not recommend that dish. Super bland. The guy next to me ordered a burger and seemed to really enjoy that.Each time, the waiters were really nice and accommodating, especially when my friend was not pleased by the french toast pocket and gladly switched out her entree.

She kept saying it was because she wanted us to sit in a booth, which we didn't ask for. After 30 minutes, I told her to seat us at any table, at which point we still had to wait. So how truthful was that. The waitress was no better. We waited 20 minutes for our drinks and about another 10 minutes for our water. Our appetizers arrived after our food, which took almost 45 minutes to arrive. When it arrived it was delivered by a guy with a goose down bomber jacket, Jesus piece, and skinny jeans on who was previously at the bar drinking. I didn't know if he was delivering our food or about to sell us his mix tape! Once we got our food, it was subpar at best. The waitress seemed to be highly annoyed, never smiled, and seldom came to check on us. The tables are right up on the bathroom which provides a constant barrage of unsettling smells.

They are accompanied with an herbed tomato sauce that makes dipping even better. The nutella crepe was yummy too. The Passion Punch was supposed to taste like blood orange and passion fruit mixed, but it honestly just tasted like orange soda to me. The presentation is very cool, smoke comes out when they pour the drink in front of you, but I was disappointed with the taste, and the fact that there was no candy inside of it.

We had a much better experience than We did last time. We got the mac and cheese balls ($14) for free from checking in on Yelp. They were gooey on the inside and crispy on the outside - absolutely delicious. Our waitress, Chanel, was friendly and attentive. The service was still quite slow, but given that the restaurant was packed this is understandable. We skipped the goblets and dessert. I got one last time, and found it too sweet. Full disclaimer: I'm typically not a big fan of sweets, and I also try to eat clean. Yet, today was the ultimate cheat day meal, and I have definitely satisfied my sugar cravings for the rest of the month (ok, maybe the rest of the week). We ordered a monster Nutella banana milkshake ($20), a s'mores latte ($13), red velvet pancakes ($16), and a Big Cheesy burger ($20). The milkshake tasted okay, but I was very impressed by the details, especially the sprinkles on the dark chocolate fondant and the various toppings. It looked too beautiful to eat. The s'mores latte was good, but again, too sweet. The pancakes were yum - loved the white chocolate flakes. The burger was delicious as well.At first I found the loudness of the restaurant disorienting, but I came to appreciate the fun, party-like ambiance.

Just go here for the drinks and candy I guess and even that was nothing to brag about. I've had better fishbowls!,Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

After getting called to be seated, they took us upstairs and placed an order. While waiting for our meal we noticed a lot of kids running around screaming loudly and carrying on in the dining area. It became so loud that got up and decided to go downstairs. Two of the wait staff and bartender who empathize, assisted us to the outside seating area. She apologized and rerouted the food and drinks to us. I just think the wait staff or managers should keep the noise level and behavior from children at a certain level especially if you have adult dining in the restaurant. Or have all the children upstairs and have adults downstairs in this particular location. As far as the food is concerned, we liked the food and drinks. Will we return back to this location, 100% no but may consider another location. We just hope the experience isn't the same.

It's pretty pricey but worth it for the experience! And they sneak a ton of booze in there. We did not walk out sober that's for sure. The place was packed (obviously) as it was Saturday night so we headed on up to the upstairs bar to play Russian roulette trying to find a seat. There ended up being ONE at the bar so my poor bf stood up behind me for a while until something finally freed up. The place seemed really cool for food and other fun candy drinks and there were lots of birthday dinners going on. I'd definitely return and this time with a reso!!!

The ambiance was great with loud club music blasting. We ordered the white gummi & mai tai goblet (Sugar Factory 60 oz. signature drinks) and a slice of red velvet cake. The drinks came out quick and were made in front of us using liquid nitrogen, which was really cool to watch and very picture/instagram worthy as well. They were filled with a little too much dry ice, which is what most places do nowadays anyway, no surprise there. Some of the gummies (gummy worms and gummy cherries) were literally frozen and super hard to eat. Like my friend said, you gotta suck on them til they get soft, then chew and swallow. Both drinks had sufficient amount of alcohol in them, no complaints there. The red velvet cake was delicious and super moist but too bad our waitress misunderstood my friend and took it away before we even got to finish the last few bites. They do indeed have the best looking, most creative, and fanciest drinks I've ever had. But considering the upscale location, the prices are high ($36 for a goblet) but well worth it to treat yourself once in awhile especially during special occasions when you're with friends. They also serve breakfast (pancakes and waffles) starting at 10:30, have an extensive menu and weekend brunch.

The drinks were also overhyped. I came here for my friend's birthday. We were seated after a small wait. Initially we thought the service was excellent because the waitress came immediately and took our orders. We got the drinks within 5 minutes. But that was not the same for the food. We waited an hour for the food to arrive. Right after we ordered dessert for the birthday girl. That did not show up until another hour because apparently we never told the waitress when she should bring it out. Whatever. The food was tasteless and unsatisfactory. And the dessert. Omg, I don't know how anybody can mess up a brownie so much. It was dry and didn't even taste good. In a group of 6 people, only half it was eaten. That's saying something.

I stated in my last review that I didn't want to give up on this place so I decided to visit again, and I'm glad I did. My fiance and I made a reservation and when we arrived we were greeted warmly and seated immediately. The atmosphere and decor was just as beautiful as the first time I visited so no complaints there. Our server by the name of Albert came over pretty quickly and took care of us the whole evening. He was very professional and made us feel like celebrities. What made his service stand out to me was how he gave us recommendations on what to order. They weren't just based off of his personal favorites but off of what we had on the table already. That type of attention to detail and personalized catering is extremely hard to find unless you're paying a pretty penny. The food was still as good as the first time. Drink wise I tried the Peace, Love and Harmonie and it was out of this world. Very nice mix of flavors! For dessert we had the brownie Sundae and a couple of crazy milkshakes and everything seemed right in the world. I definitely recommend giving this place a visit.

Granted, it's loud, crazy crowded and everyone is celebrating SOMETHING whether it's a sweet sixteen, Bachelorette or anniversary. Knowing all of this BEFORE you go probably makes the experience better.There are 3 levels. The second floor has windows so you can look over Meatpacking. The basement level is kind of fun, speakeasy-like (a stretch, but you get the idea) and a little quieter than the other levels. It is near impossible to just walk-in on the weekend and getting reservations can be difficult. However, there is a bar on each floor where you can seat yourself IF there's a spot. I've been lucky a couple of times with this.The goblet drinks are just so fun to share, and you can get them with or without alcohol. The original is pretty good. I've also had the berry but I REALLY like the white gummy. It is just too much fun to get a drink on dry ice!The food is your standard pub or diner food-- but good. The desserts are great and they will put a candle and sing a celebratory song on almost anything. I liked the red velvet cake.

My complaint is the service. When we shared that we were just there for drinks, the waiter copped an attitude. We had an underage person with us, so we ordered a nonalcoholic goblet and he gave her a specific colored straw.

If you want to eat exactly at noon or dinner time, I suggest you call ahead. It seemed quite packed. The noon crowd was made up of several young girls birthdays with parents snapping pictures. I think we heard the staff sing happy birthday four times before our order came. We had the philly burger and the dulce de leche milkshake. The milkshake was a whopping $17. It actually tasted just like vanilla milkshake. Just fancy with chocolate all over some popcorn and a big twirly candy stick. Lol it was aesthetically pleasing. Tasted good too but not $17 worth.  The philly burger was actually really good. Bun was toasty warm. The meat was juicy and flavorful. Surprisingly, we wanted more. Maybe my expectation was low. They had really big bowl alcohol stuff that foam up, fizzle up or sparked for$30-$40 dollars. It's cute to share with friends. But way too sugary. I was so thirsty after everything.

I wish we had less to eat at lunch so we could have enjoyed more food at Sugar Factory :(The place is located inside the heart of Meatpacking District, a district known for its nightlife, has tremendous amount of outdoor and culinary pleasures.  Parking on a Sunday evening is a breeze however other nights, I recommend taxi or Lyft car services. Upon entering, you can feel the excitement. The entrance is surrounded by a wonderful chandelier, colorful candies all around you and celebrity picture frames surrounding the wall. Our Host ( Kimberly ) came downstairs while we were utilizing the bathroom was very nice of her. ( On the side note : the bathroom was disgusting and really needed cleaning. )As we sat, our waitress "" Erica "" came and we told her about our allergies issues which she took care of it without much issues, making it very easy for us. If your dinning out at this place ( Sugar Factory in Meatpacking District ) definitely ask for her.  Definite order the Unique and Fun Drinks, We ordered the following :LOLLIPOP PASSION - blended together a wonderful mix of melon, coconut and pineapple to create a unique taste. For the final touch, they garnish this yummy goblet of goodness with lollipops. OCEAN BLUE - Danger lurks in the deep blue sea. There may not be an ocean nearby, but it will seem that way when you see all the sharks swimming in this Hpnotiq cocktail!RASPBERRY WATERMELON MOJITO - Made with delicious Fruit Juices, Silver Rum and topped with Watermelon Candy and Fresh Mint Leaves.

I've been here a couple of times and I have to say that is more hype than anything else. It's great to take someone here who is visiting NYC for the first time and never experienced 60 ounces of dry ice candy cocktails in their lives. They also have regular ice cocktails but no dry ice experience there but you do get the candy though.You have better service being at the bar, the two times I've sat down in the dining area our party waited too long for anyone to attend to us. I noticed while seating at the bar that they use a lot of bottom shelf liquor so if your liver is not cheap liquor friendly than I suggest have one 60 ounce gobbler.

The food is not fantastic, but good for what it seems to aim to be. There are huge goblet drinks with all sorts of colorful additions that the kids would enjoy, as well as a lot of alcoholic drinks, also colorful and in keeping with the theme.When we arrived, the staff were very friendly and laid back. Our server was very full of jokes and smiles, took our orders and brought out drinks and food in a perfectly reasonable amount of time. The food was fine, big burgers (and veggie burgers) and fries, a very sweet French toast plate, regular fare relaxed/casual food.We did have to remind our waiter about coffee orders once or twice, and when we wanted to pay it was not easy to flag someone down to get the bill. The place wasn't terribly crowded, but it did seem like there was only one server and a lot of other people doing other jobs who weren't willing to help us with the bill. At one point some of the staff seemed to be a bit miffed that we kept asking for the bill.I'm not sure if they were overwhelmed for a moment, or if someone had called in sick, or what.

175,rrtEm09rNvxtOG7Z_optpg,Dexter V.,4.0 star rating,"Let's get one thing out of the way first.  I know that this place is a tourist trap.  Only a sucker would easily fall to the brand advertising that this place is known for.  I mean for goodness sake they have pictures of different celebrities sucking a lollipop.  How cheesy is that?  Regardless I found my experience here quite enjoyable.  In fact it was so enjoyable I would have no problem visiting it again for special occasions.  Lastly I would also like to point out that I came to this restaurant during the day which means that the clientele were families looking for a good time and not drunk 20-something years old looking to party like a rock star.  Maybe that's why I enjoyed it as much as I did.So I'm going to start with the famous goblet bowls they serve.  After all when in Rome...well, whatever it applies in this situation.  Anyways we were feeling pretty passionate that day so we decided to go ahead with the Passion Punch and Lollipop Passion goblet bowls.  These 60 oz. signature drinks are an alcoholic and child's dreams come true.  Seriously is it possible that the two aspects of my life would be fulfilled.  This drink is a wonderful concoction of sweet candy goodness, but then the effervescent aroma of the alcohol is present to remind me that I'm all grown up.  Not to mention that the dry ice in the bowl produces an ethereal smoke show that is an instant-upload-to-Instagram worthy video.  Don't believe me? Then please refer to the accompanying video that I had posted here.Now in my opinion the drinks are certainly not the only reason to come by this establishment.  The food served during my visit was quite delicious.  I opted for the steak classique frites. A perfectly cooked steak served with signature butter on a bed of French fries and side salad.  For extra goodness I went with a side of onion rings because well...who doesn't love onion rings? Completely rhetorical question by the way.  Anyways the steak was cooked nicely, the frites were not soggy and the onion rings were large and scrumptious.  No complaints on my part here.Finally for dessert I opted for the red velvet cake with its vanilla ice cream and white chocolate curls all drizzled with a tangy raspberry sauce.  I know it sounds cliché but the dish was certainly the cherry on top of the whole meal.  Or in this case it was the cherry on top of the factory of sugar.  Haha see what just happened there?  No? Well never mind then.  Anyways long story short give this place a try.  Take it for what it is.  Have a great time with friends or family; pay an exorbitant amount of money, but still walk away satisfied and happy.  At least that's what happened in my case.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

The line between expensive and ripoff seems to be crossed by the $36 goblet (price not stated on menu) that didn't look like or taste like its ""Cotton Candy"" name. In its favor, they have a nice dry ice trick that makes it smoke, the kind of thing that presumably helped Sugar Factory earn its ""most Instagrammed restaurant"" status.On an appetizer list that makes hairpin turns from chicken fingers to foie gras terrine, the fried macaroni and cheese pops may be worth trying once. The South Beach Flair burger was shockingly good, including the meat as well as the amped-up condiments like chiptole mayo and chimichurri sauce. However, the fries were less compelling than the ones I had at BK earlier that day.Sugar Factory may not be a culinary goldmine, but MBA students should give it a look to see how the combination of booze and candy can really attract a crowd.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

I'll admit, I figured I would have never of updated this one!Sometime after reading my review I was offered a free meal for two. I was pretty blown away. Didn't see it coming, but I was pretty honored it was read!I took the offer because it wasn't an unforgivable experience (unlike La Marina who will never get my money again) so I'm willing to give them another shot. Plus, free food.I got my friend to join me for a 1pm reservation and we were seated promptly. I didn't take a table last time (Ebby lives at the bartop), so I was pleased with this! The restaurant, while crowded, wasn't nearly as rowdy. I thought the place had a club feel no matter what, but I'm guessing it depends on the time of day.My pal and I opted for drinks and were treated to the NICEST SERVER. Max was outright fantastic. He was very kind, super patient with us (we spent a lot of time conversing and not looking through the menu to place our orders), gave my friend recommendations when she asked, and was always attentive. This server had tables with groups to worry about so I really admired him! We decided to start with the drinks (of course) and since it was free I helped myself to the Berry Bliss. Still not buying a 36 dollar cocktail. Sure it was cool to see the smoke from the dry ice, but considering this drink runs at a high price tag, I wasn't very impressed. It does have a solid amount of alcohol (one is all you need, trust me), the flavors just don't work well. It took me back to a place where I mixed random juice, soda, and vodka to make something. I'm just going to chalk it up to a bad choice. My friend's drink was the Peace, Love, and Harmonie. So tasty! The hibiscus was strong in that one! We decided on getting an appetizer and went for the sampler. Everything was yummy! I'm not super huge on onion rings, but this made me reconsider that thought. There was also a orange sauce that complimented them nicely. I helped myself to the chicken fingers as well. I will say this, these were way more flavorful and juicy than that chicken sandwich I had previously!! I could have eaten a basket of them and called it a day. The other apps were buffalo wings and the mac and cheese balls. My friend really loved the latter. She said it was ""carbs on top of carbs"" and what she needed in life lol.It took us forever to get through the apps but when we did get to our mains I had the fried chicken and she got this burger topped with mac and cheese. I want to say that I loved my meal as much as the appetizers, but my chicken was dry! Again!! Dry fried chicken?? As someone who is pretty skilled in the art of fried chicken, I was disappointed! Shame because it was a solid portion, but so lacking in juiciness. My friend liked her burger, but wished for more mac on it as it was pictured on the menu.After my meal, I was greeted by Moro who offered it to me and she was super friendly! She even had gifts for us to take! I now have a Sugar Factory duckie! =DThe verdict? A much better time. I will honestly say that when I told my friend I didn't sell the restaurant and emphasized on how horrible it was, and she was like, ""Wow, it's much better than what you said."" I thought I was going to have a dreadful time! Dry chicken aside, I really fancied those apps! Service was fantastic and since it was during the day, I could actually hear my friend. Would I go back? Yes, this experience really made up for the previous.

The party of 20 next to was filing in and out of the table for 20 minutes before they even saw a menu.  They knocked over our water and food repeatedly.  One girl actually sat on my leg and bag.  We got spilled on and pushed - complete disaster. My husband got up about 20 mins in to tell the 3 girls at the front the situation.  They said if we would have told them earlier they would have moved us.  I don't understand why they couldn't have moved us after we complained, but they did not.  The waitress was nice but didn't do anything about the issue.  The manager then came over after we already asked the waitress for the check.  He was absolutely awful!  We calmly told him the situation and he did not care.  He said, ""Oh I was going to move you but if you want to leave ill get the check and you can go.  What kind of manager acts like that?  He saw how upset my husband was and didn't care.  He never even apologized.I have been here a few times before and was excited to come back.  The service was never amazing, but its a fun place.  I am sorry I ever went back and I would not recommend this place to anyone I know.  As someone in customer service, I would never let a customer leave so unhappy,AND THE BEST PART -Our food came out before our goblet and we finished our meal BEFORE our goblet came.   They said this is because there were not goblets left.  How does the Sugar Factory run out of goblets?  Ridiculous experience!",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

195,JUppSQfm-CYnseyGYdFhVg,Wendy C.,4.0 star rating,"Came here to try to food for the first time. The last time I came I had tried one of their specialty drinks and has a less than mediocre experience. One of their marketing people contacted me on yelp and encouraged me to come back to give this place another try, so I made a dinner reservation for two on a Friday at 7pm. Boy was this place PACKED. It's a pretty large restaurant with an upstairs and downstairs, so I thought I would have no trouble moving my reservation to an earlier time, but they were completely booked out and there was barely any standing room in the 'waiting area.' After getting seated, a waiter didn't come by and bring us water until ~10 mins later, but this wasn't a huge because I could see how busy this place was. The demographic of people who dine here seemed to me to be large parties (6+) of families, usually with young kids. This place is pretty loud and I would not recommend that you come here for a first or second date. Seems more like one of those places you would go with friends to celebrate an occasion. There were at least three parties around us celebrating a birthday. Their portion sizes are large, reminiscent of Cheesecake-Factory-esque portions. Because of this, I would say you get pretty good value for what you pay for their food. A lot of their dinner options were in the $17-30 range, which seemed reasonable to me.I ordered the branzino and my friend ordered the salmon, and we got a side of mash potatoes to share. The portion size was filling and the entrees were delicious. The combination of sauce and capers on my branzino made it a bit too salty for my liking - if it weren't for the tomatoes and the asparagus to balance out the flavors, the fish probably would have been too salty to eat. I tried a bit of the salmon and that was delicious! The skin was crisped to perfection and the fish was fresh. Too bad we didn't have room for dessert.Overall, I would recommend visiting this place at least once. It's worth the trip! Just be sure to make a reservation in advance.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

He knew I secretly really wanted to get one of those drinks so in we went! Sat down at the bar, looked around and EVERYONE, i mean literally EVERYONE was celebrating their birthday here. They are like 12. All underage but it looks so fun! They have do this great celebration song and lots of sparks flying as they bring something out, I forgot what because this happened a couple of months back. I got my drink and it was good tasting and the alcohol content isn't bad on this empty stomach right here! I could feel it! We didn't try the food so I can't elaborate on that unfortunately.

Everyone seemed to be having a good time, and it seems they get a lot of customers for birthday celebrations because there were happy birthday songs going on the whole time we were there. I wasn't bothered by it.The smoking cocktails (Goblets), are definitely worth a try. I had the Mai Tai and it was good. Sweet, but it's the sugar factory. Our waiter David, did a great job serving us. Very friendly and courteous. I had no bad experiences with the service. I thought the menu definitely had variety and options. Ordered the Farmer burger and it was delicious. Chicken and waffles was also a big hit at my table. Sugar factory is not a place for fine dining but definitely a fun place to dine.

We got there by 8:15pm and were seated immediately. They gave us a nice booth that was very comfortable too. You definitely won't regret eating here. Staff goes above and beyond to make sure all your needs are met! I ordered a Bacon, Mac & cheese burger, and they put extra bacon on my plate with no extra charge. When you order their special drinks, they wait until you're ready with your cameras out to record the experience. We also ordered the King Kong Ice cream sundae and she notified us 5 minutes in advance to coming out that they would be coming out with the dessert as well as singing so my party could get it on camera.Their food is superb as well. The burger was delicious and HUMONGOUS. You get a large, thick burger, with so many fries for just $18. Two people in my party ordered the steak and it was delicious as well. It was juicy and full of flavor. My fiancé ordered the Philly cheesesteak burger that comes with a thick burger patty and a piece of steak on top. The drinks, even the ones that don't come in the fishbowl, will fill you up. I ordered a sour apple martini and could barely finish it. The portions truly are large. I was celebrating my 21st birthday and some random person ordered me a bubble gum martini, but since we had so much already, I couldn't even finish it. The waitress who came and gave me the drink someone bought was very professional about it as well. All the waiters go above and beyond and try to be very careful with all they handle.No, Sugar Factory isn't just a tourist trap. I live in the area and have been coming here since 2014. Everyone is so nice, especially the manager. After you're done eating, he always says his goodbyes and makes sure you are satisfied. He's always on the floor as well, very friendly, making sure everyone is ok. You should only come here if you're willing to spend some money. The food isn't cheap, but you are getting what you paid for and more.

199,Y-5CFZHs-0x5a89_3PNKLA,Flora L.,1.0 star rating,"I'm going to have to agree with all the other not so good reviews on here. I've been wanting to come here for a while (years) because of the goblet drinks that they offer.Finally, today was the day! I came here with my boyfriend at 530 pm. We made reservations last minute and got a spot. We walked in and waited for a minute, then we were seated.First thing I noticed was the display of all the celebrity pictures with the goblets. We got sat down next to the window. The vibe is very mixed. It seems like there are a bunch of people that are from out of town (tourists) with a bunch of kids. There are LOTS of people celebrating their birthdays here and the staff sings very loudly. I've heard 7 birthday chants while I was here for... 50 minutes.... and they are VERY VERY LOUD. Now for the food...I got the sugar factory club sandwich and my boyfriend got a burger ( i forgot which one it was.). The sandwich was $16 and the burger was $18 I believe. We also got the ocean blue goblet ($36) The food was okay... it was nothing special at all. It also came out semi warm semi cold, like it was just left hanging for a good 15-20 minutes. Not worth the money, but nothing in the neighborhood is. It's all for the experience.The goblet literally tasted like the blue mountain dew with alcohol. If you get it without alcohol, it's a waste of money.. but hey anything for the cute picture of the goblet right?? I don't regret coming here. It was a nice experience but wouldn't come back again unless I want another cute picture of another flavor goblet to be honest. Maybe the desserts/sweets would be better to get than the actual food itself.For the service: the service was good but very pushy and overwhelming. Multiple waiters repeatedly came up to us and tried to take our food and goblet away and it's clear that we are not finished. In fact we just started eating. I can't even count how many times they came up to us with the check and trying to essentially kick us out. We weren't in there for long either..Even though it was very pushy, the service was good.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

I am an experience person when I go to places, I don't even look at how much I spend and I was very disappointed. The waitress hustled us to sing happy bday which wasn't really sang except happy bday w a cupcake. The fondu was very cheap little cups w a few pieces of candy.

One of our desserts - the peanut butter cup ice cream sandwich, the cookies were baked too long and very hard. My brownie ice cream sandwich was phenomenal. My goblet was very strong and tasted great. I got the big cheesy burger as my meal - which was also very good but not amazing. The burger patty itself wasn't the highest quality but it was well prepared. The fries were crispy and fresh, certainly tasty. Service was very good and checked in on our party often, water glasses were always full. A couple of things I want to note - our party of 6 had automatic gratuity added. Which I'm not a fan of, I'm typically a high tipper anyways, and would tip higher than what they pre charge. I did add additional tip to the bill. Not sure if that's the standard for parties of 6 in nyc, but that did annoy me slightly. Also, we realized one person from our party left her bag under the table after we left, and when we called to see if they had it, were hung up on 3 different times. We did make it back to the restaurant and get the bag back, however the phone service needs to be fixed because that's just unacceptable.

For drinks, we ordered the lollipop passion goblet, German chocolate cake martini, and cranberry and vodka. They were all delicious because they were based on a specific candy. However, they were definitely more overpriced than upscale bars. We spent more money on drinks than food...As far as the food goes, we ordered the apple pie crepe, signature sugar factory burger, fettuccini Alfredo, and NY strip. The apple pie crepe was overly sweet and didn't taste like any sort of development of flavor besides cream and sugar. The burger was perfectly cooked and just greasy enough to hold down the alcohol. The fries were nicely salted. The fettuccini Alfredo was a bit overcooked and therefore, lacked the mouthfeel of good pasta. The NY strip was cooked shockingly well, for a place that primarily concentrates on drinks; the seasoning was great. The potatoes were mashed well and the flavors were spot on.

When we finally got to our table, again, the waiters didn't acknowledge us. We had to call them ourselves and he finally took our order down. Food took too long to serve. The manager asked us to move WHILE we were eating because apparently there's a bigger party sitting next to us and they need the other table but they came and didn't even use it, which was VERY inconvenient for us and rude. I understand that it was busy but the waiters weren't giving us the same attention they did to other tables. So disappointing, it was also my first time there and it already left a bad impression on me. Overall experience, I wish I could give this place 0 review.

Although very crowded, we were seated within 5 minutes of arriving. The environment was fun, we had a funny waiter, who was attentive and made our experience enjoyable.  We ordered the typical huge drinks that they are known for.  Our meal was typical, nothing to brag about, hamburgers, chicken fingers, etc.  We ended our meal by ordering the sundae for 10 people, def. an experience!  However would I go back, no, it was one of those places, been there, done that, now on to the next.  If you have never been, def. try it.  It's one of those places that you have to try at least once.  My girls loved it but for typical food, the prices should have been typical as well but I guess you are paying for the ""experience"".   If you have money left over to spend, there is a Christian Loubutin store located across the street, which was my highlight of the evening!!",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

The main attraction is unabashedly the drinks. I went with the lollipop (ask the bartenders for a description of the drink and/or price since the menu is conspicuously mum on either) which was good and....uh, cool to look at?A friend of mine tried to argue that the bar was not clearly ""female-oriented.""

For all the hype it gets, where it's located, upscale décor, and celebrity appearances, you would think to expect a high-end restaurant/bar experience with a bougie somewhat middle-aged crowd. It is quite the contrary. Sugar Factory seriously reminded me of a Highschool Bar/Bat Mitzfah celebration: a bunch of rich teens accompanied by their parents b/c yeah they're old enough to kinda start dating, but def. still too young to be drinking and going to clubs. Oh, and lots of glitz + edm and ""Top 40"" playlist blaring in the background. Club, restaurant, bar, or Sweet 16 party venue? Maybe all the above... Anyway, I've been wanting to come here cause yeah, all those drinks look super cool on IG not to mention yummy. So I used my birthday as an excuse. My friends and I split two of their Goblets: the Lollipop Passion, and the Raspberry Watermelon Mojito. We couldn't even finish the drinks between us five. Two girls behind us each ordered and finished their own-- Lord, rest their souls (and livers).The Lollipop Passion was a blend of melon, coconut, and pineapple garnished with 2 giant lollipops and a Sweet Tarts necklace. The Raspberry Watermelon Mojito-- pretty self explanatory with raspberry+blackberry candies, garnished with 3 watermelon candy slices. To sum up the drinks: SWEET. You could definitely taste the alcohol in the Mojito. A few sips in and you're getting a sugar high, but a few bites of the candies and a quarter-way into the drinks, and you're prone to get a tummy ache. Left that place promising to never eat candy again... Probably wouldn't come back here unless someone else wanted to celly some special occasion. Prices are hefty ($99 for a sundae ""that feeds 12""?!), drinks are sugar coma-inducing, and the atmosphere is too ""teen"" for me.

But when your daughter turns 15, and wants to go to the Sugar Factory for her birthday dinner, how can I say no? You know kids....they don't know quality of food, they just want to go there for the ambience, the cool looking drinks. We had reservations for 5:30, and was still waiting for one more person, surprisingly they sat us early, and let us wait for my daughters friend to come. The menu is a basic diners menu, nothing really stands out. The drinks have no prices, but I believe there $40 each, and they aren't worth the price. The food sucked, looked & tasted like microwaved stuff, things I can buy from Costco, service was good our waiter was Raj, he was very attentive, and even sang Happy Birthday Day to my daughter after she didn't want the whole scene, thankfully we got some type of memory after a $435.00 dinner, which no one enjoyed. I seriously could have had a better meal at a diner, but this isn't the type of place you go too for the food, it's the place you go too when your teenager wants to celebrate a birthday. I also didn't like that everything felt rushed, we wasn't even done with the appetizers before the entrees were coming out, and if you read my reviews, you know how much I hate that.

We came for late lunch & from the moment we entered, we were greeted by the super friendly & welcoming staff at the entrance of the restaurant. We felt that we were truly treated like VIP guests during this visit, which was a nice, awesome, & much improved experience! We were asked to wait for about 5 or so minutes as they finished preparing our table. Upon arriving to our table, which was cutely decorated with confetti, we saw that they had provided cute little gifts- A mini Chinese takeout container filled with some of Sugar Factory's assorted gummies plus a little rubber ducky lol! & let me just say our server, Corinthian was the best! He was so welcoming, accommodating, & had such a sense of humor. We started off with an appetizer of popcorn shrimp & 2 goblets- The Drake & Lollipop Passion. Both were very sweet & fruity- just a tad strong, but that's just for my preference haha. For our entrees, we decided on the Monster Burgers - I had the Signature Sugar Factory Burger & my friend had The Philly, as recommended by Corinthian. They're not lying when they say monster burgers. They're massive & we were so stuffed after finishing just half of each of ours. The fries were perfectly crisp. I would highly recommend ordering their burgers over their pasta dishes. We couldn't help but try one of their many desserts. We wanted to try the Turtle cheesecake, but since it had just been added that day (literally hours before we arrived), instead we had the red velvet cake. It was so rich and decadent with the chocolate raspberry sauce & whipped cream plus pink sprinkles. Overall, my friend & I enjoyed our experience & we definitely felt like VIP guests!

They had a prefixed menu for everyone but there were many options to eat from. The food isn't THE best but it was pretty good nonetheless. The popularity of the place is mostly for its goblet drinks. The reason why I am giving this place 2 starts is mostly because of the service we received. Our waitress name was Cagney. I've been to many restaurants in NYC but this by far was the worst waitress I've ever had to deal with. The attitude from her was very shocking to all 20 of us. Another waitress took our orders for drinks. I ordered the Raspberry watermelon mojito goblet and a buddy of mine ordered the passion punch goblet. Cagney (our waitress) brings the wrong drink, instead she brought the watermelon candy goblet (and i can understand its similar to the other one so it may be easy to mix up) but they way she handled the situation was very rude and unprofessional. I had informed her this was the wrong drink to which then she forcefully shouts ""you want the raspberry, OK"" and rolls her eyes, snatches the drink and storms off. She's at the bar now talking to the bartender trying to fix the drink and I informed her Its fine i don't want it anymore due to her attitude and the way she handled the situation. She had said she wasn't mad at us but that she was mad at the staff who took the orders for the drinks pretty much insinuating they cannot do their job correctly. Again I don't think its correct to blame your coworkers and throw them under the bus. But after I confronted her you can easily tell she tried to up the charm and be super nice to everyone. Definitely trying to work for the tips at this point. It was sad to see because she was pretty much being fake towards us for the rest of the night. Also she kept rubbing my back and other peoples back at the table, which was very weird for a waitress to be touching the customers like that. And it happened multiple times throughout the night. My buddy never even received his drink but after the horrible experience he was okay with not wanting it. Cagney tried to convince me ""we'll hook it up for you, make the drink strong etc"" I didnt care at that point. She brings the drinks this time and it didnt really taste like it had much alcohol in it.Overall, had we had a waiter or waitress that ACTUALLY cared about our experience, i think i would have given a better rating.

When the coffee came, it was already a little cold and then by the time our server got us the milk and sugar, mine had turned to ice. I returned it and asked for another which again took forever!!

For the price i mean atleast we should have gotten good food. I didnt finish my french toast.

We've read decent reviews and have seen pictures that made their desserts look fantastic, so we were looking forward to a fun evening. Arriving a few minutes early for our reservation, we were seated fairly quickly. That's where things started to go downhill. We were given menus that were quite sticky, which made it difficult to turn the pages. After about 10 minutes a waiter came over, and without saying hello, introducing himself, or saying a word, dropped off our waters and disappeared. About 5-7 minutes later, he reappeared with a notepad asking if we had ""made any progress"" with the menu. I wouldn't call Aaron, our server, rude... but I will say he was clearly uninterested in providing us with decent service.We placed our order and the food arrived quickly. My husband and son ordered burgers, neither of which were anything special - not good or bad, but just a typical burger. I ordered rigatoni. The pasta was hard and chewy, (not al dente... trust me, I know the difference) and every single piece of rigatoni in the dish was broken. Our waiter never bothered to check on us again, so we asked for the check rather than staying to try one of the many desserts that they offer.

We waited maybe three minutes for a table. The menu is of course extensive, but what I don't like is that some things do not have prices next to them (i.e. the martinis). My friend and I ordered four different chocolate-based martinis during our stay (s'mores, peanut butter, caramel macchiato, and I think just a basic chocolate one). They were delicious, and strong, but pricey-- which is totally to be expected but it would've been nice to know HOW pricey when looking at the menu. We ordered the brownie sundae/ice cream sandwich (two brownies with vanilla ice cream in the middle). It was good, but nothing you can't make yourself.

I had reservations for 2:30 on Monday, February 19th for a table of 5, I had my two kids and my nice and nephew with me. We arrived at 2:15 and it was a madhouse. When I finally got up to check in I was told it would be a 45 minute to an hour wait with reservations. I said ok. I was going to take the kids out for a walk and come back. They said ok and they would call me when my table was ready.I went back 45 minutes later and it was still a packed madhouse in the front. I told the woman that I had a 2:30 reservations and I was told to come back in an hour. She told me there was still a wait but they are working on it. I told her we would be right outside.Then 30 minutes passed. I went back in. Still a crazy madhouse. I started talking to another woman waiting. She had 3:00 reservations for a party of 5. While I was waiting to make my way to the front, she gets called to go to her table. When I got up to the front, the woman told me there were still 7 people ahead of me. When I said what about the table of 5 that just went up, she had a 3:00 reservation and I had a 2:30.She told me I was 45 minutes late to my reservation. I told her no I was here at 2:15 and was told to come back in an hour because you were so backed up with reservations and I would be called when a table would be ready and this was my 3rd time checking in for my 2:30 reservation. At this point it was about 4:30.I canceled my reservation and left. The kids were so disappointed. What I planned to be a fun day out turned into a disappointing day because of your staff.

I didn't feel like you actually got a whole lot of liquid, considering the price!! It probably goes without saying that the cocktail was very sugary! It was fun at first when the barman served us the 'smokin' cocktail, I was excited and really impressed. However, once I got half way through the cocktail all I could take was the sugar and nothing else. I felt it was more style over substance. If you want a cocktail that photographs well for Instagram then definitely visit, but if you are looking for a good quality cocktail, I don't feel that you will find it here. While we were seated, there were literally 8 people that celebrated their birthdays! So there was constant dimmed lighting and singing. Not your typical bar experience.

We went around 4pm which it wasn't crowded. We sat downstairs and the seats were really close but not where people were sitting on top of each other so it wasn't too bad. It was a mixture of adults and kids so it's a family friendly spot. The music was also nice too like a mixture of pop and hip hop. Our server Tyrone (cute by the way) was very helpful and friendly. I had the turkey burger and french fries and the Mai Tai goblet. They are not stingy with the liquor in the goblets so you will get a crazy buzz but it was sweet at the same time. I love the theatrics with the ice and how they pour the drink. The food is decent and big so you will get your monies worth. All in all it's a great spot to go to try but make reservations as people are becoming more and more hip to this place. P.S. Mom loved the spot and older sis went here about 3 times.

I still had to wait atleast 15min fine no biggie. We sat down the one waiter that they had came over took our order. Fine. 30 min into is being there the server came back to tell us there's no more salmon. Now here's the problem. As a former manager I was disgusted. It should of been some of COMMUNCATION between the kitchen, manager and server when items are 86d, there's was none. Fine we pick some thing else. Now an hour later we're still waiting on drinks. I pulled the manager to the side and said hey ""do you need a bartender?"" . he said No.why ? I said we've been waiting for an hour for him to bring drinks. Meanwhile. The bartender is at the bar serving those drinks. Now as him being the manager and the server being the server, the bartender should know that the house drinks should be priority!!!! I then had to go get my friends drink that  he had sitting at bar for 20 min no Apology no nothing. After sitting there for almost an hour and a half and seeing another table get there food first I spoke to the server and manager again. How can we be sitting here all this time and nothing? He said because there table is smaller.  He said don't worry ill have the manager take care of you. 20 min after that the food came. No silverware no nothing. I had to go back to the server and ask. Now as I'm going to ask, my boyfriend and the bartender got into it. because the bartender stole a tip off of his card words were exchange between all three. Now we sit down to eat the police comes saying that i  a 5 ft woman threaten a 6 4 ft man. And was almost arrested. And on top of that things were added to the bill we didn't have. The service SUCKS. THERE IS NO LEADERSHIP. NO SERVICE SKILLS NO ORGANIZATION. NOTHING, IT WAS HORRIBLE. THEY COMPLETELY RUINED MY BIRTHDAY. I WOULDN'T SEND MY WORST ENEMY TO THIS PLACE. HORRIBLE FROM  BEGINNING TO END. they had no proof I threatened him because I didn't, all I ask for was silverware so we can eat. The manager seemed overwhelmed and the server had no clue.

The red velvet cocktail was terrible, I had to struggle to get that one down but for 16.00 dollars I couldn't afford not to. Some of the larger bowl drinks are pretty decent, a lot of presentation, a bit over priced, but fun if you are out on a night on the town.

Their menu of house cocktails runs towards the overly sweet side of things, but that's thematically appropriate. They were more than happy to pour us a couple glasses of whiskey however.The food is fine. It's not bad, it's just average for NYC and definitely a bit more expensive than you'd pay at a more low-key establishment.

288,g5TP6DjhiCSsIg8L-wgUCQ,Jennifer M.,3.0 star rating,"So, I was a little nervous about the Sugar Factory based on reviews.  And based on reviews, we did change our reservations from Broadway to the Meatpacking District.  We were celebrating my son being named valedictorian and getting into UPenn.  I had put in the reservation and tweeted to the Sugar Factory asking if there was anything special they could do (that we would pay for) and never got a response.  That definitely made it seem like a factory - impersonal and just churns out the same sparkler for everyone.   Regardless, we made had a reservation for this past Sunday for 8 for Brunch.  The restaurant was not busy and we were seated right away.  (Well, I shouldn't say that - I don't know what it was like upstairs - but the restaurant did not appear busy and there was never a wait).  Overall, it was just weird.  The service was spotty but we were not in a rush.  But everything came out one at a time.  First drinks came out one at a time - expect for the milkshakes.  More about those later.  After the drinks finally came out, and I re-ordered mine since it never came, we ordered our food.  Again, the food came out one at a time.  And there was a lot missing - we had to ask for one person's toast, another person's home fries, etc.  My sister realized that while she did get eggs benedict, it was not the one she ordered.  None of this was upsetting, we weren't mad, but we did ask for what we were supposed to get (except for the eggs - she let that go since she was halfway done).  Through this, we did keep inquiring about the 2 milkshakes for my son and his friend.  We were told ""they take a while, things are backed up downstairs...""  How are things that backed up at 11 am on a Sunday???  Regardless, again, not a big deal but we did have to ask about them.  The manager came over to us one point to apologize and took the milkshakes off our bill, which was unexpected and kind but she also said that the waitress was getting upset because we were getting mad.  No one was mad.  At all.  We asked because we were curious but we were enjoying our time, we were not in a rush, no one was mad.  Finally, an hour and 15 minutes after we ordered them, when everyone was done, their milkshakes came.  The biggest disappointment was, since the milkshake now kind of took the place of dessert, there was no way to even include the $5 sparkler in something to make it the celebration that we wanted it to be.  So the upshot is, we liked our waitress, she was sweet and nice - why the service was a little spotty, we don't know - certainly could have been the kitchen.  Not getting the milkshakes until we were all done was annoying but the manager made up for that.  But telling us that ""they take longer"" is one thing - getting them over an hour after you order them is another.  And there were lots of substitutions on them - the rice krispie heart was just a marshmallow, etc.  But that's fine.  I was only disappointed in the fact that it never had the true celebration feel I was hoping for, as his accomplishments are a huge deal, but the food, service, atmosphere were all fine and we would go back again, but maybe just for dessert.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

I've had *chicken alfredo pasta* and it was GREAT, I've had that extremely delicious *club sandwich+fries* whose name I don't recall and it was DELICIOUS, I've had the popcorn shrimp and that too was DELICIOUS, everything I have ordered or tried from my bf's plate has been EXTREMELY DELICIOUS so far. Like mentioned above, I've been here about 4 times and I have NEVER complaint about service, food or anything whatsoever.One thing for sure is that everyone knows they have to reserve in advance if they want to get a table guaranteed, otherwise you'll have to line up and wait 30+ minutes until something empties up.I'd say regardless you reserve in advance or line up, the wait is totally worth it.My favorite thing about coming to Sugar Factory is that one drink will probably last you all night long and will get the ""happy"" and ""chill"" you out with no exceptions. My favorite one has been the one made out of oranges and rum which name I don't recall but if you ask the bartenders, that's the one with the most amount of alcohol and taste of alcohol in the menu. I have to say the globet and the one made out of watermelon are pretty great too. No shame, I came on my birthday last year and left the restaurant in my happy cloud. Then I came on a Tuesday afternoon around 3pm and shared ONLY one globet with my boyfriend and we both left the restaurant in a great happy mood, perfect for walks around the city with no concerns about life and its struggles so that's what we did after our early noon drinks, we went to walk the High Line which is right across the restaurant, ISN'T THAT GREAT!? Continuing with my stories, I also came on November and that specific time I got drunk, like extremely happily excitedly drunk 'cause we didn't make a reservation so I decided we should wait at the bar.... We started the night with patron shots and then I helped my bf's mom with her watermelon 60oz drink (which name i don't remember) and then when we got a table (also right next to the bar on the 2nd FL) I ordered for myself the one made out of orange and rum, etc and the extremely nice and friendly bartender, which we met like an hour earlier decided to give us special treat and made mine and my bf's special drinks a little stronger than usual... that night I left the restaurant in the happiest mood I have ever been. In conclusion, try this spot out and I guarantee that just like me, you'll want to come back at least every three months and sure you'll leave the restaurant being the happiest person in the City.GREAT SPOT!!!!!",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast and milkshake upon the recommendation of my aunt. No matter what you order, you'll be jealous of what other people are ordering. I had mixed berry brioche French toast with a chocolate cookie milkshake, my boyfriend had mixed berry waffles and a Reese's peanut butter milkshake - which tasted. like a melted peanut butter cup! The brioche French toast had a strawberry filling, and the milkshake was delicious - served with whipped cream and crushed up chocolate cookies. However, as delicious as the food was, service was painfully slow. The waiter was paying more attention to the party tables, even assigning the busboy to serve us our food.

We made a reservation through open table, but the sugar factory couldn't find our reservation so we ended up waiting 40 minutes for a table - annoying and was not worth the wait. Went here mainly for the world famous King Kong. Very disappointing - it was mainly whipped cream (picture uploaded). The food, service and goblets were okay. Don't order the steak. The chicken dish and sandwiches were okay. Goblets were the best part of the night. Overall, not a good experience.

I attend to go back to try their desserts I was too full to try the last time I was there. I arrived to the restaurant at 440pm for  a 5 pm reservation and was seated right away. I want to say to truly enjoy this restaurant you should come on their off peak hours its great for birthday's. The song is literally sang ever fifteen minutes but its cute and urban and I enjoyed the friendly atmosphere. The hostess,manager and waitress was nice to me, came around and did their rounds but there was one person who truly stuck out and made my experience better. Around 6 pm it was a shift change and I gotten a new waiter I want to say his name is Derrick not to sure but right away he seemed very humble and friendly and cracked jokes he asked me if I was done with my drink. I said no I'm eating my candy. Without even asking he went and got me more candy for my drink and that's what i called customer service giving the customer something they  need that they didn't even know was available to them. He also held his hand out to help my friend get out of a really low seat. I enjoyed his jokes and the space he also gave for my friend and I  to have a  conversation. My previous waitress before him was sweet and was very apologetic when I discover a smudge on my utensil. For food I had their burger it was huge and had sweet plantains in it my favorite. The calamari was so good I finished it in seconds. Mash potatoes does not come with gravy and its bit dry i recommend salt and butter if you really want this side this. Fried chicken was favorable. But if your coming to sugar factory the milkshakes,drinks and desserts should be your go to the options seems endless and kids would love the goblets do come with non alcohol.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"
307,n-OI905PuD6bpaExdkgJkg,Drew B.,1.0 star rating,"I am a 17 year old teen, I literally don't use yelp unless I am really dissatisfied. So take that at face value.My friends and I (party of 9, reservation was for 11 - two people cancelled) showed up at 4:50 for our 5pm reservation. They would not seat us, even though we kept asking about our table. Finally, at 5:30, the hostess told that we couldn't be seated until 5:45 when the upstairs section opened. Ok, that would've been nice to know when making the reservation? Tables of people who showed up after us were being seated, and mind you, we originally had a larger table, so we should have had our table ready for a smaller group. We weren't seated until at least 6. Once seated, we only received 7 menus. We mentioned multiple times that we were a party of 9, but, at least we are all friends and can share. We did not receive water right away nor did we receive silverware. We had the menus for 30-45 minutes before our order was taken, which isn't terrible but when the upstairs was empty save for like three other tables, it was kind of annoying. I ordered rigatoni without cheese, because as a vegan it was one of just a handful of foods that I could have. (I didn't come in expecting much but I was still disappointed. The menu says v* means an item can be made vegetarian, but there were many dishes that I felt should have a v* but didn't.)Before our food came, we ordered the goblets (virgin) - and split them, but the drinks were more than disappointing. Half of the cup was ice and gummies, which left very little drink.During the hour plus that we waited for our food, the music was a mix of commercials (the drinks are $32/per and you can't afford spotify premium?) and edm music. I don't know who told them to only play edm music but that was a bad choice. During this time, my friends and I went on yelp to read the reviews and laughed at some of the ones calling out teens for being obnoxious. We got our food, finally, but 3 of our meals didn't come out at the same time, and they couldn't remember my one friend's order. My rigatoni was not worth $19, to be frank. I could've made that at home for maybe $6. But, whatever. My friend ordered a French Onion soup and they didn't give her a spoon for the soup, so she tried to eat it with a fork, as there were no waiters to call over to give her a spoon.At this point, we had been there for just over two hours and nothing felt real. Sugar Factory was a myth; time is fake. We were shouting the lyrics to I Gotta Feeling with another table who had been there almost as long as us (you can see the irony in us laughing at other yelp reviews). Since we were celebrating my friend's birthday, I went up to our waiter DJ (the only waiter for the entire upstairs, which was slowly getting more crowded), and I asked for a little something small for my friend. It was a sparkler in a rice krispie treat with whipped cream and they charged us $5 for the sparkler. Ok, I could've run to Party City before hand and gotten my own sparkler.All in all we were very disappointed; the food was mediocre, the service was poor (we love you DJ), the food was overpriced, and it just wasn't a great time. When the check came, they added $45 in gratuity (understandable, we were a party of 9), but we just felt that that tip wasn't deserved. We understand how poor waiters/waitresses are paid and were not trying to stiff them, but... it just didn't feel as if they earned a $45 tip? But whatever, we paid it and then tried to scrounge some money leftover for DJ's tip (it wasn't much, we were broke, sorry DJ). I would honestly not recommend the Sugar Factory to a friend and would probably find a better, tastier, and cheaper restaurant. They were not worth the hype.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

First of all, they are overpriced! The goblets that everyone ordered did not even have prices on the menu and only after the checks came out did I find out it was 36 dollars for a sci-fi-inspired, but horrible tasting concoction of low-end alcohol. Other drinks like the banana martini with peanut butter did not fare any better in the taste category. Admittedly, it was unwise on the part of me to not ask, but as a restaurant, leaving out the outrageous price is borderline unethical.

316,2RU46gpbsHuIzGmDipJPDg,Sharise J.,1.0 star rating,"The sugar factory made this the worst birthday I've ever celebrated! On top of that this is THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD!!!! I'm going to start with the good because it's way shorter.THE MANAGER BY THE NAME OF ANTHONY NEEDS A RAISE! Out of all the people, besides for the effort our waiter tried, he was the only one that was listening to my parties concerns and actually try to accommodate and make my day better! So for that I want to personally thank him.Now let's go to the HORRIBLE! I had a reservation at 9:30 PM for my birthday for a party of 9 some got there ahead of time and was not allowed to be seated until everyone was there. That was understandable to a certain extent. When I got there around 9:40 Pm and stated I was there for my reservation and everyone was there but 2 people were parking their cars I was rudely told "" Ok you'll be seated when everyone is actually here"" with a nice eye roll to follow. I've worked customer service all my life and that's how you cause fights with people but I kept calm and went back outside to wait. On top of that the parking is horrible over there! When the two people finally parked and we told them inside I was told it would be 20 minutes for a table after they were told twice we were there! When we finally were called we were taken downstairs where it was extremely hot and our table wasn't even ready! They had us there for 5-10 minutes looking confused and finally said we will get you the first table ready up stairs. We go back upstairs and waited another 20-30 mins and watched two parties of the same size get seated before us. When I asked for the manager of that floor she rudely brushed me off and said we are trying to get your table now. When I asked the hostess about it she said they had reservations as well. That is no excuse because they should've accommodated my party first since they screwed up our table. I asked for Anthony and he got my party seated within 10 mins. ALL AND ALL WE WEREN'T SEATED UNTIL 11 PM PROBABLY LATER!Let's move on to food and service because I feel as though our waiter should've been warned we were already pissed off. I had got sick due to the heat in the restaurant and had asked the hostess can I get water once we were seated. She told me I had to wait for the waiter. I guess she had a change of heart once she saw in my face how sick I looked and bought me the water. Thank god she didn't make me wait because the waiter didn't come until 15-20 mins after we were seated. He asked what we wanted but before even taken a full order excused himself for another 15 mins. He took everyone's food and drink order and my appetizer came before my drink! Some people only ordered water and that didn't come until like 20 mins after but at least he bought for the whole table and sung me a birthday song when pouring my drink. Our food took forever to come! And when it did about 4 orders were wrong and 2 people were missing their drinks still! We didn't have utensils for food or napkins. And I asked for straws but nothing was ever bought to me. Someone ordered steak and it was bought with no knife! WE TRIED FOR 30 MINS OR MORE TO GET ANYONE WHO WOULD LISTEN TO US ATTENTION BUT WAS IGNORED! I understand it's busy but at the very least we should've been asked was everything ok and to our liking! But that didn't happen. By now we had already sent back an appetizer because it was disgusting and we had asked for manager Anthony who got us seated no help to the manager on that floor btw. He listened and asked if we wanted the food or the dishes fixed and we declined because at that point we were ready to leave without paying the bill. He explained about the system going down which was never told to us! But for me that still wasn't an excuse as the Sugar Factory is one of the most popular food chains out there! Everyone working looked confused and rushed! By now it was 1:20 AM and I should've been to my second location for my birthday but because of all the issues that was not happening. I asked for the bill which I didn't get until 1:40 AM. We paid the bill with the ridiculous charge for gratuity. I'm normally a great tipper as well even if it is included in the bill I still give an extra 20-40 dollars but in this case I don't even think the 80 dollars in the bill was deserved. By the time we left I couldn't even get into my second locationAll in all the food was not the best didn't even come out warm. Anything that was cooked in oil you can see it or taste it. The drinks that we did get was not worth the price. I honestly would've gotten better service at Applebee's or McDonald's and enjoyed my food. THE SUGAR FACTORY BASICALLY RUINED MY BIRTHDAY!

Not to mention, even though we were not coming there to eat, we glanced at the food menu and wasn't too impressed with the selection and prices. I guess I'll try focus on the positive here. I like the presentation of the drink. The waiter brings out the goblet and prepares the drink in front of you.  I like the new location and the décor. I remember I attempted to go in the old location earlier in the year and immediately walked back out because it was so tiny and crowded. I'm sure if I were to return, I could find a drink that I liked, but I would have to have a large party to share it with.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

However, I went here with my mom on my birthday last week and had such a great experience! We are both Vegetarian so we ordered a Bruschetta between us and a Veggie burger. We substituted the side of fries with salad instead, however when my order came they had forgotten the salad and gives us the fries. After speaking to our hostess, she gave us a side of salad on the house which was super nice!  My only problem is with the veggie burger, the portion is huge and the double patties makes it difficult to eat for one person but this helped us since we shared everything. We got the Banana Split for 2 afterwards, which was delicious and everything was of perfect quantity (can definitely be shared by 3 though!)

We got to the restaurant around 1pm with a reservation...waited a few minutes but that was expected. No issue with that. We were a party of 5 sat at a table very close to others but once again,  no big deal. Menus were sticky but there was a large selection. We were excited to try a bunch of different things. Waitress, Chanel, brought waters over after us waiting 5 minutes. We then waited at least 15 minutes before she came back to take a drink order and at that time we were tired of waiting so we ordered food as well. We ordered the Mac/cheese burger, appetizer sampler, turkey club sandwich, French onion soup and chicken and waffles. A big plus was that the food came out SUPER QUICK and the food was great. Waitress didn't check on our food until we were almost done as she was preoccupied with a large table next to us and socializing with coworkers. As a server, I understand how demanding large parties can be, but she should have passed our table along to another server if she was overwhelmed. In fact, another table that sat next to us actually got up and left because they were frustrated after waiting too long for her to come over. Ended up ordering desserts but the cheesecake was frozen and the cookie for the ice cream sandwich was so hard that it was inedible. Went and looked for a manager and he took the items off with no issue. Overall, the quality and speed of entrees was the only reason I rated 2 stars--if the food was not good then i would have given 1 star. Clearly the servers understand that people come to the Sugar Factory for the extravagant drinks and desserts and use that as an excuse to give poor service.

I am pregnant so of course I'm going to order a virgin drink *i ordered the passion fruit goblet* my husband ordered the mai tai *with alcohol*. When the drinks arrived I was excited, but then when I drank some there was alcohol in mine when we specifically asked for virgin why would anyone give a pregnant lady alcohol. My husband got the waiter a skinny African American girl with her hair slightly back. She said sorry and got another one which took forrrrrrevvvveerrrrr it was nearly 1:30 when we got it. Any ways we ask to get my food packed up, I ordered he sloppy joe with fries, when I got home I saw that she only packed my sandwich and not my fries. Needless to say I am HIGHLY disappointed and feel terrible that my husband spent $100 on nothing. I will be calling to speak to a manager today.Oh I almost forgot my husband told the hostess *a different girl from our waiter* what we were celebrating she asked if he wanted someone to come out and sing happy birthday with the sparkle and guess what they never did it.

We decided to bring my daughter here for her 9th birthday dinner, made reservations on line and when we arrived were told we did not have a reservation (even after showing them the confirmation) after a moment she said that they would be able to seat us but no reservation was in the system. we sit down and it takes 15 minutes before a waiter comes over, he comes over and takes our drink order and 15 minutes later he finally came back with water in plastic cups while everyone else around us had glass. finally one drink arrives and then 10 minutes later the second drink comes.  when he delivered the second drink he finally took our order, 20 minutes goes by, 30 minutes, 45 minutes no waiter no manager no one, finally asked another waiter for more water and to find out where our waiter was. I asked about the food and he said he was going to look into it send a manager over. 50 minutes, 55 minutes the manager finally shows up a young girl and all she said was sorry for the delay and she was going to check on the food. finally the waiter came back with the order one dish was wrong after all this time. the manager never came back over. about 65 minutes for food and then another 15 minutes for another manager to come over and apologize and say they had a problem in the kitchen. needless to say we did not have dessert because it would have been another hour for that. I feel bad for my daughter because it was supposed to be a special meal for her and she was upset that it took so long and her meal was wrong to begin with. debating if I would ever go back. the waiter was horrible and the first manager needs to be taught how to have customer ae4vice skills. my girls did get a little box to fill with candy as am apology.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

356,T0vEWBntAL7lAMvSSANdKw,Tammy N.,4.0 star rating,I went here with a group of my friends for my birthday. I'm from Dallas and have never been to the Sugar Factory before. Apparently it's the place to be for a celebrity. They are proud of their celebrity guests. You'll notice when walking and waiting at the front giant framed pictures of famous guests who have visited their various locations and by flipping toward the back of their menu. It's interesting to say the least. This is the place for fun drinks! Their menu is literally dedicated to the different drinks they have to offer. You won't see a list of drinks like this anywhere. They have the goblets which we ended up getting one. The server was nice to let us prepare our phones before she made he pour. I think the entire goblet was $36 and they let you split it anyway you want so it comes out being extremely affordable. This is the only Sugar Factory that offers full entrees FYI. I got the Sugar Factory burger and it hit the spot for me. The fries were perfect and this was a large entree! I split it with my friend and we were satisfied after the meal. This is also the place for desserts! Of course it being the Sugar Factory that makes sense. We got the chocolate cake for my birthday and it came out with a giant sparkler and the servers signing you a special rendition of Happy Birthday. They do charge for this birthday surprise. It doesn't come free of charge which is a bummer but that sparkler made it special. My favorite part of the night was the goblet drink. You can ask your server which one they prefer or how you like your drinks. We got the one with the watermelon candies on the rim of the goblet. It was super good. Overall it was a fun experience.

If  you do plan on celebrating your birthday or anything occasion, it's best to reserve a table ahead of time.  The atmosphere is very upbeat and exciting. Almost every half an hour or less, there is a birthday celebration happening. The staff would all come out with a platter of dessert with sparklers and start singing and clapping. The lights are dimmed also and everyone sings along too. Their signature drinks are very enticing and tasty, I ordered a cotton candy drink that the waiter recommended and the white chocolate burger. The burger was pretty huge and had a very interesting taste. I came with about 5 other people and we ordered a appetizer sampler. Honestly speaking, it was not really enough for 5 people, therefore, if you have a big party, it is definitely not enough.  Since the burger was huge, I couldn't even finish it and I had not room for any other food.

I'm not saying it tasted bad, but it definitely isn't something I'd typically pay close to $40 for.Overall the food was decent, the service was great, and the atmosphere was fun.

The only good thing I have to say about this place is that the waiters are friendly and know how to tell a good joke.We ordered 2 goblets for the table, and for the price of them, you would think that there would be some alcohol in them! However none could be tasted. The goblets also have so much ice. Don't waste $40 on a drink that has more ice than anything else. One goblet was the Blood Orange one and the oranges inside(only 2 slices for an entire 60 oz glass) were regular oranges. Don't waste your money on these goblets unless you want a photo and to be ripped off.We proceeded to order appetizers for the table: sampler appetizer, fried calamari, and fried shrimp, all of which were bland. The fried calamari were soggy, the Mac & cheese balls in the appetizer were not even cheesy or hot(only warm inside). The fried shrimp were fine, nothing special.We also ordered the classic ice cream cookie sandwich to share and the Mudslide. The Mudslide looked good, but was so sweet. The coffee ice cream that comes with it was half melted.Now for the classic sandwich, the cookie was so hard that a fork and spoon wouldn't even break a piece off of the cookie. When we tried to do so, the cookie was as hard as a rock and moved with the plate.Don't waste your time coming here.

We had one of their goblets (White Gummi) which my wife loved (I am not a huge fan of gummy bear stuff to begin with, so I let her order and enjoy it).   :)Food-wise, we started with a Wedge Salad and a Baked Brie in Puff Pastry. Both of these things were really good! Prepared with very fresh ingredients and tasty, we were extremely pleased. Next, my wife had fried chicken, which was perfectly crispy and flavorful, and I had a very impressive hamburger. The meat was perfectly done, and there was plenty of food!As a treat at the end, we each had a milkshake. We were extremely impressed. We have two little kids at home, so it's somewhat rare that we are able to make it out for a dinner on the town.

The atmosphere is cool, the hosts at the door were friendly and made sure when a seat was available you're seated asap.  Today I decided to go all out, drinks, appetizer, entree and dessert. Glad I did. My girlfriend ordered the Raspberry watermelon mojito and i ordered the peace love and harmonie. My girlfriend has been here twice before and this is her go to drink and they DO NOT hold back on the alcohol.       I ordered the French onion soup and Sampler platter for the appetizer. The appetizer came to our table and our eyes lit up from all the food. The French onion soup was really good and the sampler platter was great. I'm a fan of onion rings and my girlfriend loves the Mac and cheese, everything was on point.       Now for the entree, I ordered the Rib eye bone in and my girlfriend the County fried chicken. We also had sides,  mushrooms and creamed spinach. I can't speak for my girlfriend who enjoyed it I can only write about what I had. The steak was really good, something I definitely did not expect. It was prepared exactly how I ordered, seasoned well with sauce on the side. The mash potatoes, I can tell it was fresh, they still had tiny small pieces of potatoes inside which I thought was amazing. The grilled veggies was done right not like other places where they are covered in oil and sometimes burned.  The mushrooms were good and so was the creamed spinach.        We decided to get dessert which was the cheese cake and key lime pie. The cheese cake was average and the key lime pie needs some work. A good Key lime pie is hard to come across. But overall we enjoyed it.       I will defiantly go back to the Sugar Factory, time and money well spent! Our waitress made sure our water glass was full and checked if everything was alright.

Other parties that arrived without a reservation were told there would be a two hour wait, YIKES! Before we were seated there was a woman arguing upstairs about the bill for a good 10 minutes. Security ran up the stairs to deescalate the situation, and seemed to return downstairs in defeat. Even when we were being seated, she was still arguing about the bill. I was not sure exactly what to get to eat, so I settled on the burger that comes with Mac and Cheese. It looked nothing like any of the pictures I saw here on yelp, I almost could not even tell where the Mac and Cheese was, but it was decent. I got the signature goblet, it wasn't sweet or anything, it was just okay tasting. The goblet came with two large lollipops and a candy bracelet, which I forgot to take with me (grrr). It cost $36 with alcohol, and if you drink it alone you may feel the effects of the drink. I honestly agree with many other reviewers. This place is not a place I would frequent, at all. Take your video for social media, because it does look cool, but it's not that special. Our table was near about 16 teenagers. They weren't overly annoying, just a little annoying.

The fries were extremely oily and soggy and the waffle (it literally came with just one waffle) tasted like Eggos. The pasta was just okay, you can get better elsewhere.

I would never be here again and never recommend my friends this restaurant forever.The service here is the WORST, WORST, WORST I have ever been through.When my girl friend and I sat down, the waiter (Just call her ""Ellen"") came to us and said what drinks would we want. After we ordered the drinks, she just walked away without saying anything. We haven't even ordered food. So we told her that we wanted to order food.

I went and told their woman manager that what the waiter said to us. She said she would talk to us later. 10 minutes later, NOTHING HAPPENED. I went and asked her again that we needed an explanation and sorry. She said okay she would deal with this. Of course, NOTHING HAPPENED EITHER. Then I went for her third times, finally another one came and asked us what happened, then she seemed to talk to ""Ellen"". As expected, NOTHING HAPPENED.

I read some of the Yelp reviews before just to see what I was getting myself into. So the night came and we got there. The atmosphere was really cool. I liked it and I thought the candy stuff was cool! We were seated downstair and it was so dark! I don't mind the dark at all, I thought it was cool. It was time for us to order our food, we got a Bogo deal on the appetizers. I ordered the Mac n Cheese Burger with fries and a Make A Wish shake. For appetizer my friends and I order buffalo wings and popcorn shrimp. The birthday girl ordered a Ocean Blue Goblet and we shared. It was really cool! However there is so little inside of it. At the end of the Goblet is just hard ice and I even tried to break it with a spoon to see if there was more of the drink there but no. For my Big Cheesy Burger, I was really disappointed. The Mac n Cheese was so bland. I could of went to Cheesecake or 5 Guys and get a better one! I was really sad about this. I ended up just eating the fries and taking the burger home. The Make A Wish shake was the worst milkshake I have ever tried. I worked at Cold Stone and we made better shakes than this! I was so disappointed! Just to make sure I wasn't over exaggerating I also let my friends taste it and they agreed too. For $10.00 that is a rip off! I asked our waiter if she could delete this off the bill because I was so upset about paying that much for a terrible shake!As for the appetizers, the chicken wings were okay, I ended up eating that with my fries for the night. The popcorn shrimp was cool but I couldn't believe how much it cost! It was $15 dollars for one appetizer that brought like 6 pieces of shrimp. Since it was my friend birthday I did that birthday special. She got the Brownie IC Sandwich. It was cool but when we started biting into the dessert it was a disaster! THE VANILLA ICE CREAM HAD NO FLAVOR! The brownie didn't taste like anything either. So upset. Disclaimer: I also tried other dishes that my friends picked out. I tried the Fettuccine Alfredo was alright. Nothing special, go to Olive Garden instead. OVERALL... the waiters were awesome! Our server Erika K was so sweet and cool. I really enjoyed having her as my waiter. Everything else was fine but the food. I feel bad that I am writing this negative review because I tend to like everything! I eat almost everything and I am always satisfied but this was really not good. If you want to go to get some drinks I say go for it! But I did not like the food at all and I can't believe I spend that much money. IF YOU ARE GOING AS A GROUP PLEASE READ THIS!It was myself and 2 other people and when our bill came I asked if they can spilt the bill because we wanted to pay for our own stuff but my waiter said they don't do that there! I cannot believe in the modern world we live in they would not have this feature at their business. A lot of restaurants have this feature and I would expect them to do it here but no!

First I arrived to an insolent hostess who wouldn't check me in because my party was a block behind me. OK fine we get inside we have to check in again and they tell us we should be seated within 15 minutes. While we were waiting, we were so lucky to watch the other hostess pick dry skin off her shoulder. We finally get seated after waiting at least 45 minutes and we order. The waitress said it shouldn't be long. The music is blasting so loud that you could barely hear yourself speaking to another person. The waitress could not even hear us while we were ordering. We literally had to scream our order. We must of been waiting at least an hour with no food when we see a server trip and fall with a tray of food. He comes out again a few minutes later and not only does he trip again, he falls onto someone's shoulder. Of course  that just happened to be our tray of food.

The decor was modern and cute, fit for the occasion.  It was definitely a hot spot for birthday celebrations, and despite having to bring out the sparkeler dessert and sing over and over, the staff was high energy and made each celebration feel special by singing and dancing. Jeremiah was a waiter, he was knowledgeable about the menu, polite and quite visually appealing.  The girls really enjoyed their birthday serenade from him. The drink presentation was awesome as was the way the food was presented.  Unfortunately though, neither tasted very good to me and was certainly not worth the $130 that I was charged for 2 people!

Didn't wait long to be seated. Our waiter, Tyrone, was ready to get us into our seats and having a good time immediately. He suggested we try the Ocean Blue goblet and made sure we had our cameras ready for this spectacular drink! Our meals were ready in no time. They were hot (I don't like cold food) and they were delicious. My fiancé barely spoke because he was thoroughly enjoying ""The Big Cheesy"" burger. I barely got to try his burger because he couldn't stop eating it. I had the Black Angus Filet (medium) and it was PERFECT! It was moist and flavorful! It sat on a very huge helping of mashed potatoes and I ate every bite. I didn't think I had room for desserts but I had to try the rainbow doughnut ice cream sandwich. It was absolutely worth it!

Eat before you get here because the food is trash. Nobody in my party of 11 liked their food, the one redeeming item was the fries but even those were cold when we got them. A couple of notes:1. We didn't get silverware until after our food was in front of us and we were waiting for a good five mins. 2. The restaurant (upstairs) was FREEZING. 3. Food is so overpriced and definitely not worth it. As far as the positives:1. Our waiter was very personable and made sure to accommodate all our food allergy needs. 2. The staff is very energetic no matter how many times they have to sing a bday song (btw each song is tailored to the client. A group of kids got a cute song and me and my group of 21 year olds got a turn up song lol)3. The drinks may be $16 but they reeeeally packed a punch. Delicious and different. 4. So many beautiful photo opportunities , whether it's from your drink or from all the cool decor around the restaurant. The $5 sparkler made for a great bday pic!5. This may be a silly bonus but the wait staff here is very attractive too...Basically, this is a nice place to get drinks and celebrate a very special occasion but definitely find somewhere else to eat first.

They tasted good but not $36 dollars good. And to add insultTo injury it's 98% ice and 2% actual drink!!!! NOT WORTH IT!!!!! We decided to get dessert to go. We ordered the white chocolate cheesecake. A VERY thin slice of cheesecake for $11!!! As a native NY'er that is absolutely ridiculous. That's more than a slice of Juniors famous cheesecake and that is at least 4X the size of this one! UNBELIEVABLE! Our total bill was $215.... we were severely underwhelmed!

Well, since we could hardly finish even half of our desserts it wasn't really cheating that much. They were that bad.Also, it took forever for two cappuccino's to get made. Our server, who was actually pretty good, kept apologizing for the wait. It was a joke after a while. At least it was a nice night outside to relax, wait, and people watch.Look, I get the ""club-like"" atmosphere they try and instill here with the special birthday music, singing, flashing lights, and shooting sparklers placed on the bday person's table, it's fun but after a while it got annoying. Seemed like a dozen other people were celebrating their big days too. I kept quiet about mine, and my gal also said no way to being serenaded.It's a place for all the bridge and tunnel suburbanites, 20 somethings with mommy and daddy's trust fund money to spend, and desperate celebrities looking to get noticed and have their pictures taken by the paparazzi. If you have a bunch of cash to burn then head here and fry up the credit card. I do have to admit the huge goblet cocktails looked cool, but I can imagine how much sugar must be in them.

My friends from Barcelona came to visit so I made a 6:30pm reservation so we can all enjoy a great meal and drink! When we got there the music was insanely loud which I didn't mind but my friends were less pleased. We had a waiter that was very kind but didn't listen to our very simple order. My friend is allergic to onions and she specifically told him no onions. I ordered a Big Chessy which was a bit disappointing. When our food came out her burger had onions and she became a bit nauseous but didn't make a scene. My burger so overly cooked and dry but my other friend enjoyed his food to a certain capacity.

The service was not nearly as bad as I had expected, as a matter of fact, it was pretty good (with the exception that our drinks sat out for wayyyyy too long and as a result we did not have very much of a dry ice effect which was a little disappointing). As for the ambiance though I wasn't a huge fan, the decor and all was really nice but it was a little too packed inside and pretty loud- between the music and all the people it was very difficult for any conversation. However, on the flip side, the drinks had exceeded my expectations (at least the Maui Thai did) which I highly recommend. I'm really not a big fan of sweets and I was expecting the drink to be sickeningly sweet but it really wasn't at all. One weird thing though was that when you start to get the end of the drink it starts to hurt to drink it, probably something to do with the dry ice. As for the food I ordered the brie puffs which were really good and surprisingly pretty filling when combined with the massive goblet. However, the food, like the goblets was all super expensive. The Brie puffs which were technically an appetizer were $14 and the drink without any alcohol was $30. There is also an automatic 18% gratuity included in the bill. All in all, the six of us each only got an appetizer and a total of 3 drinks for the table yet somehow ended up spending $200+. As upset with the prices that I was, I would probably come back. When you come to the sugar factory, you have to keep in mind that you're not just paying for food, you're paying for presentation and experience. Overall it was also a pretty fun place to visit with a few friends for a birthday or other celebration, but not the kind of place to casually dine at.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

Note the people are great and pleasant but service for drinks was poor which is a big draw to the place.The So-So:   The atmosphere was casual and dance music playing, fun decor but place is pretty small.  Smaller than I thought.  Parking can be had in street with pay meter if you get lucky!  I'd take out of town friends here, see the wall of celebs who came here and have drinks.  However would not go here otherwise.  3.5 stars.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

As for food, we got the Chinese chicken salad and the buffalo chicken sandwich and for dessert we got the signature fondue.

Food- Horrible.  Two of us ordered the chicken and waffles and it was very dry.  We actually asked for syrup to go with it since it came with a mornay sauce.  Chicken fry batter had a nice texture but was lacking in flavor.  Co-worker ordered the steak frites- it was average and flat.  We had high hopes for the desert and ordered two-  biggest disappointment of the night!!  Nothing special and would have been happier with grocery store ice cream! The sauces and cookie crumbles had no flavor.  The cookies were so hard that we had to bang on the plate to break them, were not fresh.   Overall- Horrible and waste of money.  Tourist Trap for birthdays and bachelorette parties.  Left us gazing across the street at other restaurant options, completely regretting our decision to dine here.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"
460,pEnEmQeWwh9ktZsAz12ZBw,Lucas C.,4.0 star rating,"Walking into Sugar Factory you are immediately hit with the cool, clean, and modern American bar and grill type restaurant. The music played throughout the restaurant was a good mix of modern music, which helped add to the already solid feel of the restaurant. We were able to get a table a good half hour before our reservation which was definitely a plus. When the waitress came over to the table, she gave off the vibe that she really didn't want to be there, which kinda killed the mood, but I was able to look past that, since the rest of the staff were very helpful and there always seemed to be someone around. The menu has a huge variety of food and drink option, but the thing that caught my eye was the Sugar Factory Specialty Sliders. The service was surprisingly fast. The first thing to come our were our three cups that were soon to be filled with their funky drinks. They messed up one of our drinks, but lucky we caught it before they poured in the actual liquid, so it was a quick and easy fix. The drinks were difficult to drink because of the abundance of ice, but it gave you the extra time to enjoy it. After finishing the drinks, it wasn't long before my sliders came out. I was very impressed with the presentation, but it almost seemed like you were paying for the food coloring in the buns and the complimentary rubber duck, because the sliders themselves weren't all that.

We made a reservation but the seats are soooo close together and the music is soooo loud too it really kind of takes away from the experience. As for the food I would say it is below average. Fries were just ok and the sandwiches taste kind of like low quality hospital food. Of course people dont really come here for the amazing food but the super cool drinks! As for the drinks we got the watermelon mojito one. (I will insert a picture below). It looked super cool with the dry ice and the candies, however it was not too great in taste. All you could taste was rum (im not even sure why they would put rum in a watermelon drink i think it would have been better with vodka or even tequila.) The drink tasted super over poured and you could not get a real fruity taste at all. The service its self was great. They have a very nice staff and they even have a bathroom attendant. Even though the food wasnt great it did come out realllly fast even though it was super busy. If it is like your 21st birthday or something than this is a fun place to go.

A friend of mine doesn't drink and she ordered a virgin candy goblet and it tasted really delicious. The food is also pretty good here. The chocolate fondue and frozen hot chocolate is absolutely delicious. I recommend the S'mores martini - was great! The burgers are also good if you aren't coming just for drinks. They even make fried mac and cheese balls - they are yummy. The only reason I didn't give this place five stars was because it is extremely tiny. I don't think people realize how small it is before they come here because I know I didn't. You are literally table to table with other guests and it can be a little overwhelming. The music is loud it's like a night club in there which is good since it puts you in a dancing (drinking) mood - but it can be annoying being so close to other people when you are trying to enjoy yourself and your company.

I, too, was a member of such a party, for my best friend's birthday. We didn't make a reservation beforehand (not a good idea - definitely look into it) and were told we were gonna have to wait for 2 hours. Well, we slipped the waiter a $5 and he gave us a small table for about 20 minutes, which was nice, but I would hate to think of waiting for so long if it didn't work out.  As we soon realized, when people come to the Sugar Factory, they definitely aren't coming for a 5 star meal.  As implied in the name, it's all about the sugar! My friend ordered the typical giant green drink called ""lollipop passion,"" and while it was very aesthetically pleasing, it did not taste as good. I guess next time I would try the blue one, as a devout lover of all things blue raspberry. But with the price range, it's hard to see myself coming back. We also got the giant ice cream sundae that was $100, which looked super awesome. The sparklers were a nice touch, and I, someone with a major sweet tooth, was ready to dive in but I soon realized that I could barely make it through one tiny mug that the server put small amounts of the mountain of diabetes into. Also, since we only had a quick 30 min before our server whisked us away, we definitely did not make very much progress. If you're going for your birthday, unless you have a party of 20, do not order this, no matter how cool it looks. The price and sheer quantity is not worth it.

485,tygRUEg5SnUJXpq7IsV4mw,Kathy X.,4.0 star rating,"This is a fun, club-like, happening, beautifully and festively decorated spot with 3 levels. It was quite crowded and even though I had a 8pm reservation, they wouldn't start getting our table ready until after our entire party was here. That in itself didn't bother me, as many restaurants have this policy. When everyone in my party arrived a little past 8pm, I let the host know and she told us we would have to wait. After 15 minutes she asked us to wait at the top of the stairs on the highest level, which was pretty nice... A great view of the gorgeous chandeliers and the restaurant. However, we had to wait another 15 minutes so it was about 30 minutes until we were finally seated. The seating set up was pretty cool, as there was booth seating, and table seating jutting out from the rounded booth. The menu is a hefty book with tons of cocktail drinks (which can be made non alcoholic), milkshakes, food and dessert options. I knew that I wanted a milkshake, which are expensive at $10, but really huge. I made a few of my friends order a milkshake as well, so was able to taste 4 different types. Here is what I thought, listed in order of favorite to least favorite. 1. Fluffier Nutter is the milkshake I chose and consisted of vanilla soft serve ice cream base, with peanut butter, chocolate sauce, marshmallows, topped with whipped cream and peanut butter cups. I was able to taste the peanut butter well, but wish there was more of a distinct marshmallow flavor. Also, it came topped with Reeses M&M's, not peanut butter cups.2. Make A Wish, was also made with vanilla soft serve, made with yellow cake, sprinkles and a cute little birthday candle, which I wished upon and blew out. This milkshake was deliciously sweet and the cake was perfectly moist and tasty.3. Chocolate Cookie Jar had vanilla soft serve, oreo, chocolate chips, caramel and chocolate sauces. This tasted just like Cookies & Cream and was very yummy.4. Memory Lane was vanilla soft serve, blended with hot fudge, marshmallows, chocolate fudge and waffle cone pieces. When I tried it, it was actually pretty bland... I couldn't really discern the flavors clearly and definitely did not taste a lot of hot fudge or marshmallows, so this milkshake flavor was a disappointment. As we were waiting for our meals, Chris, the general manager came to our table to introduce himself and to apologize for the wait. He then said that he knows it's my birthday so will do something extra special for that and called me by name. I was definitely happy and impressed that Chris took the time to speak with us personally. For my entree, I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Pappardelle pasta dish, which included sun dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, pine nuts, fresh herbs and a lemony sauce made with  olive oil and roasted garlic, along with toasted thin slice of bread with garlic taste on it (I wouldn't really call it garlic bread even though it calls it that on the menu). I liked my meal for the most part, but I thought the sauce was too oily. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente though and the chicken was nice and flavorful, going well with the artichoke, pine nuts and I enjoyed the plethora of parmesan cheese.Most of my friends ordered burgers, so I got to try some of the french fries, which were very good! They were skinny fries, crispy with great potato taste. Our entrees came around the same time, but the waiter brought the wrong order for one of my friends so he had to wait quite a bit longer to get his burger. When we were all finished, the servers came out with a seriously massive ice cream sundae with 2 sparklers in it and they all sang Happy Birthday to me! The sundae was beautifully presented with whipped cream, colorful sprinkles, sugar cones, 2 lollipops and the sizzling sparkling sparklers were a perfect touch! This sundae was the World Famous Sugar Factory King Kong Sundae, which had cookies & cream, chocolate, strawberry, vanilla ice cream flavors, as well as rice crispy treat pieces, pretzels, gummy bears, strawberries, blueberries and chocolate sauce. It also come with a comically big spoon. The servers handed out separate bowls for everyone and we started to dig in... It was delicious! I especially enjoyed the rice crispy treats and gummy bears. This amazing sundae concoction actually costs $99 for 12 people and the restaurant gave it to us without charge! Such a generous and wonderful gesture on their part... This definitely made up for having to wait a bit to be seated!This was the perfect place to celebrate my belated birthday dinner... I thoroughly enjoyed my time here and it seemed like most of my friends were having a ton of fun as well.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

The food is mediocre and basically a fancier Red Robin restaurant with some cool drinks called goblets. The cool drinks with smoke coming out are a must since you see nearly everyone ordering them. Here is the big negative, each goblet drink ranges from $30 to $40 each. The prices are not listed on the menu which I am not surprise. I saw my bill and I was stunned to see $64 for the 2 drinks I ordered for my two kids. The food we ordered were burgers and chicken wings. Final bill with gratuities was over $200 during lunch time. Afterwards, I called the restaurant and spoke to Julio, one of the managers, and asked why the prices are not listed for any of the goblet drinks and his reply was it was Sugar Factory policy to not display them. Why not? I guess with those outrageous prices, it's best to leave them off. Other than the overpriced food and drinks, the restaurant is nice with good ambiance. I will not come again.

The Pop music, bright colors, and loud atmosphere are directly indicative of that. As one reviewer mentioned, there is a wall with photos of celebrities at the establishment, essentially real-life clickbait. I could've swore I saw AT LEAST half the Jenner/Kardashian family on that wall.Everything at this place just screams excess. From the high prices ($36 for a 60 oz alcoholic ""goblet"", filled with gummi worms and lollipops to boot), to the enormous portion sizes (I was barely able to finish my gigantic burger), blasting Pop music, incorporation of candy into just about everything, flashy visuals, reflective ceilings and crystal chandeliers, if you go here, don't expect NOT to completely overindulge.We went here for my 9 year-old sister's birthday. We had a reservation for 6:30, we got there around 6:45, and we were seated about 2-5 minutes later. The service was friendly and speedy (especially that bathroom attendant, like dude, it's fancy as all hell), the food was actually very decent (for how decadent it appears), the drinks are fun, and the meals look like they were concocted by someone who hasn't eaten all day. For the birthday celebrations (of which there were four in the room), they turn up the music, cut the lights, and bring out giant cakes/milkshakes/sundaes with a sparkler sticking out of them. So if you're hosting a birthday, this is definitely a fun place to go. Also, be sure not to inhale too heavily on those goblets, as the dry ice will give you a nice shortness of breath.All that having been said, I would return here, but not alone or for a casual meal. Probably if I was with an out-of-town friend, some girls on a date, or if it was a friend's birthday.

Anyway, we made it there about 10 minutes late due to delays on the subway, but they took us in immediately. The place is gorgeous (except for the million Kardashian pictures hanging everywhere). We first walked into an elaborate candy shop and were escorted upstairs to the upper dining room...filled with children! It's to be expected, especially early on a Saturday morning. But , I mean we were the only group without kids...literally! They have a huge selection of drinks, most can be made without alcohol. We got this beautiful, candy-filled, green concoction. Very sweet, very strong, very delicious. I got a mixed berry crepe, also, which was fantastic. It is very pricy. This fishbowl drinks are like $35-$40 a pop, but they are quite the experience. The food was excellent and the service was also! Our waitress was on point and had an awesome personality! Minus one star for them moving my reservation across town.

But if you look past all the smoke (literally) and sparkles, there isn't much there. The drinks are expensive (to be expected) and fun because they are all put on dry ice for the cool look of smoke pouring out of your drink, but they simply aren't impressive. I shared a fishbowl with my friend - we ordered the SunTea because we could already feel our teeth rotting at the descriptions of all the other liquid candy drinks. It wasn't terrible! Essentially iced tea, lemonade and tequila. It wasn't too sweet so it was more tolerable than the other ones I tried, such as the berry one my friend ordered. We also ordered food - certainly frozen and again, unimpressive. Shared the appetizer sampler and Caesar salad with my friend. Eh. Nothing much to say about any of it. The atmosphere itself is fun. For birthdays the servers carry out these exploding ice cream sundaes ($100 mind you) which captures everyone's attention. The music is very loud, making it feel like a club even though everyone is seated at tables trying to hold conversations. In my opinion, it reflects a very cool concept that seems to have run it's course. Nothing stands out to me as WOW! this place is trying to be different and one-of-a-kind. Can definitely feel a corporate atmosphere. I will give props to the servers - despite the fact that our server insisted he couldn't split the bill by seat (I understand he wanted his gratuity but believe me, a table full of servers aren't going to jip on the tip). There was a situation with a VERY drunk guest which was handled very well from what I could observe.Again, overall - unimpressive and overrated. Fun - I suppose - for a girls night out or 21st birthday but with the overload of unique, fun, creative bars in NY and in the meatpacking district alone, I would absolutely PASS on the Sugar Factory.

We arrived at the restaurant to find ourselves waiting almost an hour before being seated. The place was extremely loud. They had party music through the entire time we were there. The prices were very high compared to the quantity of food that we got. We also had their signature big glass drink and they were too sweet and had way too much alcohol. The server was very fun and pleasant but the time waiting for the good was unbearable. We placed the order for appetizers and it took about 40 minutes before getting to our table. Shortly after ordering the appetizer we ordered our entré. We waited what seemed like 90 minutes from the time we placed the order to when we got the food. Overall was a very disappointing experience from the wait of being seated (even with a reservation) to how long it took for our food to get to our table to the highly priced generic menu items.

Tried various items on food menu...( meatballs, burger, fettuccine alfredo, steak, fudge brownie sundae, and milkshake) not one was acceptable for my party.""Known"" for their burgers... would rather have Burger King. The desserts?.......it was basically made to look like accessories in large portions but not well tasting. Basically everything was made with cheap soft serve ice cream. Diary queen is better. Ordered the fudge brownie ice cream sandwich. If I took two store bought brownies and a scoop of breyers it would have tasted better at a fraction of the price. It is one thing to be expensive and taste good but another to be expensive and not taste as one would expect.Would be better off at black tap craft beer and burgers for novelty milkshakes....taste good tooAnd serendipity for overall food and dessert experience with instagram pics (if that's what your into)ProsGreat for instagram pics Very nice waiter",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

540,MIDPZVO5wMeTo7VTtEm2pw,Deanna A.,1.0 star rating,"If the cheesecake factory and dylan's candy bar had a one night stand - the sugar factory would be the result of that accidental pregnancy. We came for a birthday celebration as a way to do something a little bit cheesy but ultimately fun and different. The sugary mixed drinks were calling our names.We had a 7:30 pm reservation for a pretty large group, and ultimately were not seated for 20-30 minutes. When we finally got to our table they plopped down the menus that were about 30 pages long. Featuring such delicacies as a milkshake with a small cheeseburger perched atop it (WHAT?!?!?!). First small saving grace, they did have a small gluten free menu - I was relieved to see my options parsed down from 35 pages to one sheet - front and back. I kept it simple with a caesar salad with chicken, and a side of potatoes. They do have gluten free pastas and pizzas for the more adventurous. When the salad came out it was so sad, completely dressingless, with mostly lettuce, a touch of cheese and a few small cubes of chicken. The potatoes also looked like they had breadcrumbs on them which would make the decidedly not gluten-free.After about 20 minutes we were able to flag down a server (not even our own) to check on the potatoes (which were luckily fine but unluckily not delicious) and get me some dressing. Either they were confused or the only gluten free salad dressing was an italian dressing (not caesar) because that's what I got. Very disappointing for an 18 dollar salad. Another small shining pro was that yes, yes the goblet does make for a fun experience and some delightful photos especially for the birthday girl. What weird science, however, causes it to fog up and then continue to bubble throughout the dinner? Finally, their biggest saving grace might be their overpriced bulk candy, but when some co-workers came here to get me a bag for a special occasion the cashier had no idea what candies were gluten-free when asked.so MAYBE come for just the candy, MAYBE come for just the drinks or MAYBE don't?

I shared one of the seasonal drinks called the Lollipop Brew. It's smoky appearance with delicious peach flavored liquor make for a great drink. It also includes at least $10-15 in candy inside the drink. Sugar Factory is unlike any place I've ever been. I would recommend a visit for dinner or drinks.

Returned for dinner after receiving a kind message and discount from the manager for a not-so-great first experience and I am so glad I did.Everything from the food to the drinks to the service was on point. My friend and I ordered the Thai chicken salad, Mediterranean salad with shrimp, the signature lollipop goblet, the coconut chocolate martini, and the s'mores martini.Now, I'm not normally one to write home about a salad (or anything with leaves, really), but the shrimp on the Mediterranean salad was so juicy I ended up inhaling the bowl. I didn't try the Thai chicken salad but my friend said it was damn good as well. The lollipop goblet was hilariously sweet but honestly, when you're ordering a cocktail with two lollipops in it, it better be sweet. Bonus: this drink is not shy on alcohol! But the real showstopper was the S'mores martini. This may have been the best dessert cocktail I've ever put in my face. The glass rim is coated in graham cracker, the drink itself tastes like a rich chocolate milk, and it's topped with 3 plump marshmallows. I don't care who you are or what you like, order it!The service and management staff were absolutely wonderful per usual. They really took the time to  check in and make sure we were taken care of.In sum, I'm really happy I gave this place another go.

Overall, a decent experience for the price - and instagram-worthy of course.  As he was getting ready to make our goblet smoke (comparing himself to a chemist), the waiter asked if we wanted to take pictures because usually everyone takes their phones out to capture this memorable experience.  I said sure why not - I'm all for the basic b**** life when it hits me full force.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

My entree Fettuccine Alfredo was good but not something I'd go back for. My friends didn't really like their food.

They do sprinklers for mostly everyone who celebrate their birthdays there. It's a cheerful joint with loud music and Amazing cocktails. I won't rate it a reasonable one when it comes to cost. Goblets are fun but a bit over-priced. It's better to make a reservation esp when you're going with a bunch of people. I loved the menu options since it had so many choices for vegetarians.

Food took about 20 to 25 minutes to come out and it was cold. Food came out separately. When we said something to our server, he brushed us off. It was the most disrespectful service I've ever had.

So we ordered 3 goblets and were not impressed at all, which was okay because everyone is entitled to their own opinions but the biggest let down of the night was how rude some of the staff (hostesses) were and how 2 of the girls up front did not know how to treat new customers. It's really sad because those are the first people that the customers engage with when they first walk in and we were not impressed at all.

My kids bugged us to go back recently because they go to school nearby and keep walking past the new location on Washington Street. We made a reservation a month in advance, arrived Sunday 6pm on the nose for our 6pm rese. By 6:20 they finally sat us BUT IT WAS IN THE DUNGEON (ASK TO BE SEATED ON THE GROUND OR UPPER FLOOR AS THE BASEMENT IS NOT DECORATED SUGAR STYLE), but by 6:45 our order was still not taken yet and we were being ignored, so we asked the manager who said to be patient and the waiter would be right over. But then the waiter said he still had a large table (or perhaps several tables) to take orders from before us, and it would be awhile. To wait an hour just to order, we figured we would not get served for another hour, thus we got up and left. There is no excuse for this treatment, given this place has been in operation for years and is always busy so they should not be surprised by the volume of people. It is also very noisy and filled with a bridge and tunnel crowd, basically a night club scene, except that everyone is overweight. We will never be back, this is not a place for local people who are used to being treated with respect and appreciation. In their favor for a tourist trap, the prices are actually quite reasonable, and it really is in an awesome part of town. Clearly, this place does not need my business, nor do they depend on repeat business, and this is how they treat and make you feel. Most people with children in tow that have dreamed of coming here for months, do not have the option to pick up and go to one of the many many other restaurants nearby, They have you captured and at their mercy, but for me, no thanks. My kids actually wanted to leave, they felt so ignored.

We also ordered a cheeseburger and fries.  It was more like Fries with a side of cheeseburger!  SOOO many fries....We also got the gummy worm drink.  Yes, it is $36, but it was enough alcohol for 10 people.  It was VERY strong and tasted like medicine!  Kind of reminded me of Jungle Juice in college!  Not the best drink by any means, but got the job done and it was fun :)  They bring huge gobletts out full of ice and candy, and pour the alcohol over the ice.  It smokes for a while and and looks really cool.Over all - I liked it here, you just have to be into the gimmicks!",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

So if you want to experience this, and you don't drink, there is something for you also. The food was okay. All my friends ordered something different, and we all thought the food was average. However, I wouldn't come to a place like this for the food. The drinks are what makes the experience great!

Personally, I did not enjoy the environment they presented. Very loud music blasted through the speakers caused me to yell my order to our Waitress. I understand they try to present a lively place to match the crazy dessert options, but they can relax on the volume. I couldn't even hear my girlfriend properly throughout of meal. I found it strange that a restaurant with such a large wait staff failed to provide timely service. It took 20 minutes before we were able to get someone to help us. We were not thinking about the amount of time that passes because we were standing in line for the one person bathroom. This establishment can hold over 100 customers but has one bathroom stall that workers used too. When we did, we were given a rude waiter that was disappointed we only order one item to share. He then disappeared and we had to re order with a waitress who was much nicer. Food: overall, the cookies and cream sundae was actually pretty good. I didnt enjoy my experience at Sugar Factory overall and for that they earned a 2 out of 5 in my opinion. I would never waste my patience and go back there.

We started with the signature goblet which was 36$. I wouldn't have minded the price, being that it is New York & that's expected of a shareable cocktail that size, if it had tasted good. The description was a mix of coconut, pineapple, and melon. Other then a slight aftertaste of maybe coconut vodka I honestly could not describe to you what the drink tasted like. I think I choked down a couple of sips & left it untouched.. I will also comment I noticed the same of a lot of tables around us. The girl seated directly next to me had said that hers didn't taste any better. Although the waitress was attentive she did not seem to notice or care that the drink was untouched. We also ordered the shareable platter for 26$. Basic chicken fingers, onion rings, deep fried mac & cheese, and buffalo wings which were fatty and glazed with a sweet hot sauce. Again nothing to be impressed about. Next we ordered the chocolate Sunday for 13$. Basically a couple of scoops of chocolate ice cream with lots of whip cream, chocolate sprinkles & cherry gummie candies inside of real ones.

My cousin and I definitely shared tea goblet. We had to get a goblet. It is part of the experience. The drink was stronger than we anticipated. I ordered the South Beach Flair burger which was different with fried sweet plantains and chimichurri sauce. It was pretty good and messy.

My daughter got a waffle with ice cream. It had ONE waffle and was about $16 I think. Her drink was enormous and virgin, but there weren't prices in the menu. It was THIRTY DOLLARS for the drink. I wished the waitress told us that it was too big for one person. 3-4 could have easily had it.Luckily, I had her take it to go bc I wasn't paying $30 for a drink to get poured down the drain. My drink was a grape crush. Good but really did just taste like soda. Again, I want to say it was about $12 or $16. I can't recall. I had a yummy salad but it was overpriced, too.I was thinking f taking my daughter back with more people but $87 for two people: a waffle and a salad, I don't know that I would  return unless I have some money to burn.All in all, it was good by way too pricey.

My friend and I were early so we were allowed to go downstairs to the bar and order a cocktail before being seated. We got the S'Mores cocktail & one of their fruity cocktails as well which were way too expensive for how they tasted. The display of all their drinks is beautiful and fun but I was not a fan of either drink's taste.

We had a reservation so we were seated relatively quickly but it took twenty minutes just to get a menu. I have all the time stamps because I was texting a friend the whole time about how absurd this was. Then, we asked for spring water instead of tap and the waiter came back ten minutes later with only three out of the five bottles we asked for. Then, he took so long to come back with the other two we ended up sharing the 3 we already had and not even opening the other two (that we were still charged $5 each for). Then, a manager came and poured tap water into my glass filled with bottled! When there was a giant blue glass bottle of spring water right next to it!Our waiter kept disappearing for 15-20 minutes at a time so once we were finally able to order, our drinks didn't come for THIRTY MINUTES! For a drink! And then, one of my nieces ordered a coconut and banana goblet that was yellow in the menu with coconut on the rim. When she got it, however, it was bright red. She told the waiter that wasn't her drink and he told her the glass it was in was red and that's why it wasn't yellow... these goblets come in a clear glass so I don't know what he even meant by that. I tried it and there was not an ounce of coconut or banana in that drink- but there was a ton of red bull which is another one of the drinks they have on the menu (side note who feeds a child red bull). We told the waiter this and he insisted, no it's the right drink. Then, we called the manager over and asked him about it and he told us THEY DON'T EVEN MAKE THIS DRINK ANYMORE! I'm sorry waiter- how are you so insistent that you served us the right thing when it no longer exists? Then the manager had the nerve to take the drink away and not offer a refund! I had to TELL HIM to take it off my bill. He was gunna charge me $36 for a drink I didn't order? I don't think so. (Once the bill came the drink was listed as the ""Drake"" which is obviously not the same name as what my niece ordered so the waiter had to know it was incorrect)The another HALF HOUR LATER (an hour after we ordered) our food finally came. It was alright I guess, but with the prices you're paying those processed frozen fries are unacceptable. The whole place was loud and sticky and I expected more from the staff.

My boyfriend and I shared the Raspberry Watermelon Mojito. By the time we were halfway done with the drink I could taste the sugar crystals in my mouth - so we only got to drink half of our $36 drink.Overall, I don't think this place is worth it at all. Way too much hype, especially not for an older crowd. This place would be okay for a big group of young kids, but I think it's lost its appeal to anyone above 18.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

Ambience in the new location beats the old location. Only reason I have been here twice is because I was invited out for birthday parties. The goblet drinks taste like straight dry ice, and when people say one goblet can be split between 4 people, definitely not. My boyfriend and I split one goblet and felt absolutely no effects. Don't waste your money just go with a regular cocktail. I had the banana pancakes which was delicious another time I had the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken which was mediocre at best. My boyfriend had the Nutella pancakes which he raved about as well as the beef sliders, both at the old location.  At the new location he has some fried seafood platter which was bland.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

Although I stand by what I said about the drinks - this time I tried the Sunshine Tea and replaced it with a plain margarita that was literally just syrup - I've finally had the food, and it was delicious. I got the pan-seared salmon on a bed of grilled (I think) asparagus, and it was delicious! The salmon was cooked to perfection, and the asparagus was a wonderful combination of soft and hard. The lemon slices that adorned the salmon really added to the taste, immensely enhancing the flavor. Not only was the food delicious (and were the drinks yucky), the service was great!

So by 9pm we were sat & once the waiter arrived (who never introduced himself )we were ready to order. We were waiting for over 30mins for some milkshakes. Mind you it was not busy & a table that had arrived after us got their drinks before us. Our drinks came 5mins before our food & we never received our appetizers. When we told our server he bluntly said he forgot & ""rushed"" to get them , we ordered 2 orders of fried mac and cheese pops & they looked like fried Oreos. At this point I was so annoyed I just wanted to leave & I didn't even get to enjoy my food. I honestly feel that because we didn't order any alcoholic beverages we were treated that way.

The fact that the manager reached out to me was great, but to have them invite me back and have dinner on them was even better. I made the reservation with the manager who was really kind and friendly. When I arrived today for my reservation my guests and I were seated and at the table waiting were a few bags of Sugar Factory's signature candies. I knew right then and there that I was going to have a much better experience. My family and I enjoyed some of the great food and dessert options such as the mac and cheese pops, buffalo chicken sandwich, and two of their new insane milkshakes. Since I did bring three additional guests I paid for them, but the fact that two complete meals came off the bill was amazing. Our waitress as well was great and she really tended to our table making sure we always had enough water and making sure the food came out okay.

Me and my girlfriend were trying to figure out if one of there special drinks would be enough for the two of us and although I do not look like I'm 21 he assumed I wanted non-alcoholic. And when I asked for alcohol in it, he had rushed me to show ID. Which ticked me off a bit. Wasn't too happy about that but once my drink came in it wasn't a big deal anymore. The drink was creative and boy was it big. It's sweet which was no surprise but the alcohol will get you afterwards so drink carefully. We ordered our food which was awesome also!!

I ordered the chicken and waffles which was tasty and my niece got a chicken sandwhich. We ordered the mojito with no alcohol which was $35....for no alcohol. It tasted like 7UP and grenadine with mint. Not that it wasn't good...I just think that's kinda crazy. It's really more about how much value you want to give some dry ice and instagram likes.

686,uQSu4t1Ox1wlmrgw3a9bSQ,Rashi S.,1.0 star rating,"Wow. I just received the most horrible treatment I have ever received from a manager in my life. We ordered a milkshake and food. I said repeatedly that the milkshake was for my 10 year old and it was to be given to with her meal. After asking 4 servers nicely for the milkshake, I finally got it after 1 hour. Of course, it was a vanilla milkshake instead of the banana Nutella one we ordered! The waitress herself offered to bring the manager over. Everyone else around me got food and drink on time. I asked the waitress if our milkshake was unusually hard to make, and she said no and was visibly upset. When I told the manager I was upset, and that I understand I am not the usual celebrity that comes there, but I should receive the treatment any patron does, he told me I was being dramatic. He said, let's not talk about all your drama, I will just fix it.. 10 more minutes went by before he ""fixed it"" and brought my daughter a shake. I didn't even raise my voice at him. It is very regular not dramatic to be angry after waiting an hour for something when everyone around you is getting their food on time. And after the wrong shake came over. He eventually came back over, gave my daughter her milkshake, she had a few sips, and then he came back with the check. And proceeded to smash her milkshake on the ground, glass flying everywhere. He did not apologize, he walked away. I have never met such a jerk in my life who lets glass and milkshake fly all over his customers! My daughter could have been hurt, as well as the woman it spilled on. He clearly did that on purpose. And again, did not apologize to my 10 year old who was crying because she was treated that way by an adult, and was scared, but also because the milkshake she waited for an hour was all over the ground. Another patron had milkshake on her. Owners of sugar factory, teach your manager to just apologize. If he had just apologized and been gracious, this all could have been avoided. Teach him some manners. Teach him how to respect patrons. Teach him how to be an example to kids. Teach him not to get angry and try to hurt children. Better yet, get rid of him. Celebrity endorsers should be aware how children are treated at this supposedly kid friendly place. It was scary. Don't believe me? Ask the waitress that served me because she was equally as appalled. Ask the customer who had milkshake on her. I could do nothing but laugh as I left.. wow a grown man in the hospitality business would rather smash a 10 year olds milkshake on the ground and make her cry rather than apologize. I didn't raise my voice once at him.. what would he have done if I did?",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

But also I knew it would be dangerous by how tasty it was!I decided on getting the White Chocolate Burger for my entree, I have never seen anything like that on any menu and so I decided to go with it for that reason. I was nervous, but It was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. The white chocolate and the perfectly grilled burger was one of the greatest sweet and salty combinations. I don't know why no one else does this! I'd highly recommend it to anyone!For dessert, since it was my friend's birthday they brought out a boat of ice cream with sparklers and sang.

Why is the virgin version the same price as the alcohol version?The food is totally beside the point, so I regret coming for lunch/brunch. Our food came an hour after we sat down (we had our beverages), and my classic waffles were not as described in the menu - not melted butter, no sprinkled powdered sugar, and the whipped cream was a melted puddle. I asked about the butter and was brought a couple of cold pats in a little cup. My iced coffee arrived without a single ice cube.The desert was good, tho charging extra for the sparklers seems a little grabby.

We were a party of 2 and were sat upstairs in the back room which was freezing cold, and had about 3 different groups of 8 people celebrating things. We asked our server if we could move to a different table since we were cold and had air blowing right on our heads. She went to find a manager. In the meantime the parties around us were so loud and obnoxious I couldn't even hear my sister talking to me a foot away. A manager comes over and says he's looking for another table downstairs and if we wait about 15 minutes there should be one opening. Well, about 20 minutes goes by and no word from the manager. Our server never came back over to us since first introducing herself since ""if we leave we'll no longer be in her station,"" which is obvious..but some water in the meantime would have been appreciated. I finally chase down the manager who says he misread the tables and that none are getting up anytime soon, and we can try our luck at the bar. We decided to just stay and freeze since already 30 minutes had passed since we first sat down.We ordered the Lollipop passion goblet... the presentation was great but it tasted disgusting, totally undrinkable, all artificial and sugary. At least we got some good instagram pictures. The menu was not impressive at all... chicken wings, mozzarella sticks, burgers, I guess anything that can be fried and put in a basket, so we decided to pass. Instead we ordered the chocolate fondue which was very good, and we liked all the different things it came with.$70 for 2 people that got one drink and one dessert.

I came here with a friend for her birthday. We are tiny Asian girls who look young but it was mad rude how the waiter just assumed that we were under aged and said ""no alcohol for you guys"". Like bruh, why would you think that 2 under aged kids are at sugar factory at like 4pm during weekdays. Anyways, we ordered wings and sugar factory club sandwich. Not gonna lie the portion was huuuuge. It was massive and we couldn't not finish both of them. Both of them were decent, no wow factor about it. I was excited for fries cus ppl on Yelp were like ""OMG FRIES ARE SO GOOD"" ... Chill it was just regular very thin sliced fries. So for what you pay, you get what you deserve. We ordered white gummies goblet and by the end of the drink, half of liquid on the bottom just froze and became slushy. It was not drinkable and tasted straight up like liquor. I thought the whole point of sugar factory is to put sugar or candy in drinks to mask nasty alcohol taste. Idk maybe I'm being childish but I expected it to be sweeter than what we got. Last time I got green goblet drink and it was way better than this one. At the end I wanted to throw in a little surprise and ordered cheesecake with flaming candle. Cheesecake was really good and flaming candle only lasted about 15 sec, boo. I couldn't even get a decent picture with her when the flame was on. Would I come here again?

When it arrived, the entire table noted..Hhmm..that doesn't look like red velvet cake. We all tasted it and sure enough, it was raspberry cake - the actual raspberries on top of it were the dead giveaway. We asked our server about it and he had no idea, so he had the manager come over. We asked him about it and he either had no idea what red velvet cake is supposed to be made of or he was going to go down with the ship and defend this imposter of a desert.For anyone that doesn't cook..here's an excerpt from the wiki, referencing red velvet cake:Red velvet cake is a cake with either a dark red, bright red or red-brown color. It is traditionally prepared as a layer cake topped with cream cheese or cooked roux icing.Common ingredients include buttermilk, butter, cocoa, and flour for the cake, beetroot or red food coloring for the color.During the inquiry, the manager clearly stated an understanding that red velvet cake was, actually, a chocolate cake, but them pivoted to the fact that called theirs a red velvet cake, but it, in fact, contained no chocolate and, instead, was raspberry cake. He then went right back to calling it a red velvet cake...I sat back, listened to the exchange and felt as though I was taking crazy pills.As we say in the south 'bless his heart'I was disappointed as we, as a society, have become so accustomed to the Kardashian name standing for exacting standards and the highest ethics and quality products...in case you didn't know they were affiliated with the restaurant, they put about 800 pictures of themselves all over the place.

I heard many positive reviews on this place, but after my visit there - I wasn't impressed. Not one bit. First of all music was very loud, so if you want to say something you should shout loudly. It is fine if you don't want to speak with you friend and get drank only.The menu is extensive, but I didn't like that some things don't have prices.

The place is dimly lit but once your eyes adust it not too dark. I only had a basket of fries and a Sour Apple Drink that came with pop rocks on the rim.  The basket of fries to me was a heafty proportion(matchstick size)and I was able to share with 2 other people. My friend had some meatballs that she said were really good and filling. The fries came out hot. My drink...my drink...my drink...was extra yummy. I wasn't ashamed to lick rim. I don't know what kind of pop rocks they were but they were delicious. My drink had a sour apple charms blow pop in the middle that mixed well with  the Liqour. Our waitress and the manager working that night (February 3rd) were really nice and polite. Despite it getting late they made sure my friend was able to have a sparkler for her birthday.

When we arrived to NYC for our annual vacation I wanted this to be a hit for her. I had been Yelping and looking at pics, checking the menu out online, and quite frankly I am sad that I was disappointed and let down. We went to Serafina's at first (because I enjoyed their bar and food) but my mother saw nothing on the menu that appealed to her. The manager informed us that Sugar Factory had closed it's original restaurant and had moved down a block. So we headed over and was excited to walk in.The place is bright, inviting, loud with fun and excitement, and just a joy to be in the environment. It's not a huge place but it works for large groups seeing as though they have large booths to accommodate. We were greeted by the hostess who was a very attractive and professional young lady. We asked to sit outside but the patio area was not open at that time. So my mother was given the option to sit upstairs or downstairs and so she chose upstairs.The upstairs has a bar area I glanced over briefly because we were not interested, on both sides were large groups of parties sat in very large comfortable booths. In the middle, are tables set up for groups of 2 or 4 comfortably. As we were sat we perused the menu and were never greeted. As a matter of fact, my mother and I sat there for 20 minutes and watched servers walk past us, we saw two more groups sat down in our section who were greeted and served but not us. Simply put I was beyond annoyed and decided to keep my composure and tell my mother I was sorry she didn't get service at the one restaurant I really wanted to take her to. We walked back downstairs and told the hostess who repeatedly apologized but we chose not to stay and move on to the next restaurant (needless to say we got service there)They won't be seeing me again anytime soon",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

I ordered a custom birthday cake and I was quite disappointed that all the candy decorations were made out of fondant instead of actual candy pieces. Considering I asked for a candy cake, what I received was definitely not worth the price I paid at all. Also the sparklers are a bit overkill for such a tiny venue with no ventilation, my guest and I were choking before we even fished the first verse of happy birthday. Overall slightly disappointed, lesson learned but I still had fun.UPDATED REVIEW 3 STARS: I have since returned the Sugar Factory. My mom wanted to go there for Mother's Day. It was only 3 of us, we were seated within 10 minutes of our reservation. Again, the drinks were great, the food wasn't anything too special but it was good. I would definitely recommend this place for a smaller group of people. No more than 5, which wasn't what I was told when I originally booked my birthday package. Unless you're buying out the space, it's just not very accommodating. Nonetheless, the staff both times were extremely helpful and polite, which is always appreciated.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

We were quite excited and made reservations to come back at 6 that evening for dinner!     The first thing that I must say about the Sugar Factory is that it is PACKED and very loud, so if you're looking for a quiet dinner where you will be able to talk to your dinner mates, this is not the place. However, the Sugar Factory is a place you must try at least once-it's fun, glamorous, and you may even spot a celebrity during your meal!     When we came back to check in, the counter/candy area was super crowded and rambunctious-luckily we were able to get our table quickly!     We began our meal with drinks-how could you not? I had the S'mores Martini (virgin of course, I am only 17!) which is my favorite. The food menu has a good range of options-sandwiches, salads, burgers, steaks, apps, etc. and we decided to go with a few appetizers as our meal: the Baked Brie in Puff Pastry, Fried Mac & Cheese Pops, and the ""Garbage Salad,"" and our friends ordered the Club Sandwich (came with thin fries) and an order of onion rings.When it comes to the food here, nothing is spectacular, but we did enjoy everything..especially the Brie and fries.     At the end of our meal, we were kindly asked if we could move down to another table, as a large party had made reservations and was arriving. We were okay with that and because of the ""inconvenience,"" our dessert was on the house! Our dessert of choice was the Cookie Jar Sundae, which was quite good!      Overall, the Sugar Factory is a fun place, and I enjoy going there when I'm in the city and want a fun meal. I do tend to get irritated at the loudness of others and wish that the workers would turn down the very loud music!",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

I was super excited to try out their milkshakes so we went in as a group and tried the Cookie Jar milkshake, apple pie, a sundae, and some appetizers. Everything was VERY expensive, but the appetizers were really underwhelming and tasted like they'd been prepackaged, defrosted, and reheated. The apple pie was very basic and kind of stale, the sundaes generic, but the milkshakes were the biggest disappointment :( My cookie jar was very, very bland and I couldn't really taste anything in it.

I ordered a cocktail and it had a strand of hair in it. The manager was really nice and she replaced it for free. However, it was a turn off for me. We ordered fettuccini with some bread. Nothing great about it. The cheesy garlic bread was served room temperature as if it was sitting on a shelf for a while. Mediterranean salad was average.

The burger with mushrooms was really good, however, but food at these places I guess isn't really what they're known for.

Than we ordered an eggs Benedict and a buffalo chicken sandwich. Well it took almost an hour and our waitress didn't even acknowledge the fact.. When it finally arrived I didn't even want it.

Even with reservations, my party still waited a good 15 minutes before being seated.Our waiter was very attentive and friendly, and the service was pretty quick. I loved my two drinks--the Ocean Blue and the Sexual Chocolate--but some of the drinks the rest of my party ordered were far from enjoyable. One even sent hers back to the kitchen as it was too gross to drink.I was far less impressed with my dessert. The Nutella crepes were hard and barely had any filling.

I got a goblet, obviously, and it did NOT skimp on liquor. It was pretty strong but really yummy. On the way out I bought some (read: a lot) of candy in the flat rate Chinese box, which is the best way to go.

808,YZ-TsbkR-pjTXkW58XUSVg,Charlene E.,2.0 star rating,"So apparently you have to book this place a month in advance and I'm still trying to figure out why. This place was lackluster and did not meet my expectations in any way. The inside of this place was on the shabbier end, nothing high end to match their high end prices. I was waiting to visit this place for 2 months and I left feeling disappointed and underwhelmed. We ordered the 60oz goblets and I regretted it instantaneously. I'm a light weight drinker so this drink wasn't ideal, I just figured 'hey! I'm finally at the sugar factory and I might as well make the best of it and experience what they have to offer'! Wrong answer though. I ordered the berry mojito and was extremely disappointed. It just tasted like a weak over hyped drink. It was very fizzy and bubbled for the first 30 mins. I was unable to get through a tenth of the drink. Maybe I ordered the wrong drink, maybe I should've tried another drink. My sister and her boyfriend seemed to enjoy their drinks, however, they mentioned the drink was on the weaker side as well. So for 40 bucks each, we were impressed. We also ordered the appetizer sampler and the portion for the price did not add up. Food was pretty basic, a couple of wings, two Mac and cheese balls and some other fixings I didn't bother with.

The sugar factory is now a total of 3 floors has plenty of room for everyone and the music is not crazy loud anymore. The average weight without a reservation is prob an hour to an hour and a half. The food there is a bit pricey but it is incredible. This place has my favorite fettuccine Alfred I've ever had and the goblet is big enough to be shared.

Our waitress had a nice demeanor. However, my mojito was served to one of my sons friends. When I told our waitress that she poured my alcoholic drink to the minor sitting with me...she apologized took the drink from the child and handed it to me expecting me to drink it ... I was appalled to say the very least . My sons friend had taken a few sips before telling me it taste funny!!!   I very calmly and politely said ... No Thank you. I ordered a freshly made drink I want a freshly made drink!!  We ate our appetizers by the time I finally received my drink and it was clear that all they did was pour the same drink into a new glass! I asked the waitress "" Does this look like a new fresh drink to you?"" She politely smiled agreed it was not and she apologized went off to get me a new drink. Well I finally got my $36.00 dollar drink with my dessert before leaving. I was shocked and in disbelief at just how bad the fact that my sons 12 years friend was served my alcohol. I emailed Sugar Factory informing them of the fact that alcohol was served to a minor I received a call from Sugar Factory I told the young lady what we experienced she apologized invited me and my family back to make it up to us as their guest! I thought about it and agreed to go back as their guest imagine my surprise when I received the bill ($400) for our dinner. Please note our 1st horrible experience cost over $600 and we were invited to come back as guest so they can make up the whole experience to us after we complained. I would have never gone back but was contacted by the manager on behalf of the owner to see how they could make this up to us and wanted us to give them another chance as their guest. Foolishly I agreed. Clearly this establishment is not as professional as you would think!

And it doesn't hurt the drinks are huge (two people drink) with lots of alcohol.  Yum.   We had chicken fingers, wings, and a seafood platter.  The kids decided on the non-alcohol passion punch. Hubby and I went with the same BUT with the alcohol.  We wanted to save space for dessert so my son got a milkshake....can't remember which one but he loved it.  My daughter and I shared the cookie and cream sundae.  It was ahh - cookie was too hard - however the highlight was to have the servers bring out the sundae with sparkles and sang Happy birthday with a twist ...too funny.

Came at about 9 PM and noticed that there was only one server for the outside tables (there was about 15 outdoor tables). We ordered three goblets and 1 meal and two soups for the three of us since we mostly were going for the goblets. The soups came out 10 mins before we got our waters that we asked for 20 mins prior. We didn't like the soup and wanted to tell someone, but no one came by until the meal came out 20 more minutes later! I take a fork to mix up my pasta and there is a HUGE bug crawling around!!!! Honestly it could've been from the fact we were sitting outside, BUT once again when we were trying to find someone to tell them about it, no one was there. We did feel kind of bad for the server cause he was clearly busy, but it had been 45 mins now, no exaggeration, and we still had not gotten our goblet drinks! The tables around us had all gotten them and quite a few came in after us. We had asked a busser if we could speak to a manager and ten more minutes passed and no one came. We needed to catch our train back to jersey, and we just wanted to leave even though we didn't get the drinks we came for. The manager didn't come until another 10 mins and that's because we had to walk inside to find him. We could tell that the hosts were talking about us, because we were clearly upset but I work in the restaurant business as a server and a bartender so it was a little bit unprofessional to be angry that we were upset we didn't get the service we were hoping for. We ended up only getting 1/2 off and the server never ended up coming back after that.

The 'bouncer' was rude despite me confirming twice that I had a reservation. The server we had was all over the place. My mini burger sliders were not well done and the server couldn't even recall what I had asked for. After receiving all of my food finally I was still waiting on my drinks and had to remind the server. Once my fiancé and I received the drinks they were not the drinks we ordered which I pointed out to the server as soon as she tried to leave them with us but she insisted it was what we ordered. I tried the drinks and like I suspected the drinks were wrong. When I finally flagged down our server she acknowledged her mistake and proceeded to give the two drinks I just tried to the table across from us! I was horrified! Needless to say the server never brought us the correct drinks and didn't bother to remove it from the bill which we had her correct before paying.

In fact, you can eat elsewhere and just come for the ending. There is a great selection of drinks for all tastes, and they are strong so you only need one. For the goblets, it is humanly impossible to drink a 60oz cocktail alone in one sitting, so I suggest sharing. The smaller cocktails are also delicious and strong.

The white gummy was sweet and peachy...we downed the first one and drank a second goblet; the watermelon mojito.  Literally tasted like a watermelon Slurpee!**ALSO they can be prepared alcohol free.  That's why it is somewhat mobbed with 13 year old girl gangs (this could dull the mood if they're overly rowdy like the party of 15 that was near us last night..but we tried to ignore)- birthdays/noise level:  awesome house music was being blasted and some reviews say it's too loud but I disagree.  It's loud enough to keep the flow and totally agrees with the vibe of the restaurant.  Be aware that There is a birthday shout out every 5 minutes or so.  Every. 5 minutes.  **AGAIN.  This is not a quiet, romantic, anniversary, kiddie type of place for night out.  If you fall into any of those categories you might end up leaving like ""wtf just happened"". -attire:  I venture to say casual/trendy.  You can tell most of the crowd dressed as though they thought they were celebrities themselves and that's all well and good...but jeans/flowy tops/rompers/sundresses/bodycon attire would be appropriate.  Basically anything you can find at forever21, mystique or H&M is a go.-Quality of service/food/drinks:  this is where the star was lost.  We completely adored our waiter Santi!! He was an absolute star and honest about food and drink choices.  However, aside from the wonderful Santi, It took about a 45 minutes to get the food to the table after we sat and waited etc.  (this is the kitchen not the waiters doing) The food itself was basic yet satisfying.  Also each drink was made perfectly and poured at your table so you can see all the magic take place!  Also all the flavors of each drink blended perfectly and tasted sweet and delicious...as it should!There you have it.  Go for the experience and enjoy yourself!! And for those wondering...2 goblets and 3 meals (burger, sandwich, sandwich) came to $138.47 before tip.  For a touristy Manhattan restaurant...split between 3 people it was well worth it.IF YOU MADE IT TO THE END OF THIS REVIEW AND YOU AGREE/FOUND THIS INFORMATION HELPFUL please comment me or reference me in a future Yelp.  Thanks!!",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"
844,Eo9Y8c6_eQhfVA2di9cCKg,LP R.,4.0 star rating,"Ok, so before I start this review, I just want to say that we didn't come here for the food. It was my first time and I came here with goblet drinks on my mind.My sister and I were celebrating our birthdays, January 27 & 29, and we both dreamed of checking out this place. We brought my 6 year old niece on January 30th and with no reservation, that was a recipe for disaster.  The wait was 2-3 hours long and she was getting restless. We purchased the candy in the entrance to keep her occupied, but that could only go so far.  We asked the hostess for a break, she helped us out and we were finally seated.  That was incredibly nice of them.  I will say this is a fun place for kids, but just make a reservation first.  Personally, I'm not the type that likes having waiters sing me Happy Birthday while others try to enjoy their meals, so we didn't go that route. If you do enjoy that, then this is the place for you.  Non-stop celebration of birthdays and music playing, it's a great spot for families and special occasions.  My sister and I shared a Lollipop passion goblet that we couldn't finish, I ordered a Make a wish shake topped with a candle to celebrate my 33rd Birthday, my niece tried the Barbie Shake and she could barely finish it. They should call it the Jem shake instead, because of the crystals on top.  We tried to sampler platter and I fell for the mac and cheese pops.  My goblet wasn't that sugary, I could really taste the alcohol.  I don't know how anybody can finish any of these drinks.  The shakes aren't anything great, as far as flavor, and the appetizers aren't that great either.  So, I did enjoyed the experience after all.  I'd like to come back again to try the other drinks and maybe some entrees, we'll see.*My niece, she's the real critic here,  she had a blast.

848,F--hL3naPLl-_ojr_JyeSA,Alyse R.,3.0 star rating,"This was my first time coming here and it was for my birthday so my bar was set pretty high. I made reservations about 2 weeks in advance which are a must if you want to stop in on a weekend. My reservation was for 11 and my party wasn't seated until about 11:40, the reason being that they won't seat you until everyone in your party arrives. 5 out of 7 of us were there so I find that to be kind of ridiculous especially when the place gets so packed you barely can find space to wait. They eventually did seat us without the other 2, btw. They have 3 floors and we were seated downstairs which has a cellar feel to it which is great if you're into that kind of thing (I'm not). They sat us at a table that was pretty tight for 7 people so we helped ourselves to a nearby table that was free. The waitress took our orders for both drinks and food and we waited and waited...and waited. Food arrived about 40 minutes later and it was cold. Most of us had burgers and were seated right by the kitchen so needless to say that was pretty confusing. The manager was notified and he did bring out new hot orders and gave us dessert on the house. Our server Brittany was very nice so that was a saving grace. Our drinks came out maybe 15 minutes after the food which was kind of backwards but it seems like the bar gets backed up with goblet orders. Overall it was a decent time with a few bumps. It could've just been bad luck, but I won't be returning to find out.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

We were then brought four glasses of water with a promise of another one  that never came When our appetizers came we had to ask for  our silverware and napkins to which they brought two set ups. My wife said there's five of us our waiter actually said "" you want five?"".  My wife's Chinese chicken salad came as a pile of cabbage with dressing no chicken. But at least she got hers.  My salmon salad came after everybody was finished. Oh! The  dirty martini I ordered didn't come the first time (we had to ask about it)because they had no Smirnoff. He asked what other vodka we wanted and we said Absolute. After having to ask again for my dinner we checked on the drink again. This time,  no olives. We were reprimanded that you can't make a Dirty Martini with no olives. And what did he suggest instead ? Nothing. He never came back. We sat with no waiter in sight for 20+ minutes at a time and never got even 1 refill on our 4 waters. When we told our waiter we were not happy at all for the reasons I  just wrote, he apologized and said he would get the manager but surprise surprise  he never did.

The employee tells me that she has openings for that night and she puts me down for February 19 at 9pm. She takes my full name, number and email address. Then, I call yesterday (the day before my reservation)  at 2pm to make sure my reservation  is confirmed since I didn't receive an email or phone call. The employee asks for my full name: doesn't find it. She asks me to spell it: still doesn't find it. Then she asks me for my number: again, doesn't find it. Then I tell her that my reservations were made well in advanced and there should be one for 9pm! She tells me that there was a reservation cancelled under the name of ""Mavelyn"" (almost spelled like mine!) for 9pm. But the number on that reservation was area code 646, not mine. She then starts laughing with her coworker stating ""what?...no. I don't have a pack of pens"" while I'm on the phone... Then she tells me to spell my name 3 times to she can fit me into the cancelled 9pm reservation from ""Mavelyn"". So I spell MY name for the reservation at 9pm.

The only thing is the unique presentation. Ordered a crepe with strawberries and barley got any strawberries. The flat cake part of the crepe tasted like mint and there was nothing sweet about it other than the bland whip cream and a scoop of ice cream. They have nothing over Creperie on Mcdougal street. The bubbly goblets are served over dry ice and claim to give you 60 ounces of a drink for 30 dollars. But waitress comes and pours out of a 10 ounce coffee mug Into the goblet. They overcharge and falsely advertise. Price of the goblet is different for the Times Square location versus the restaurant. A crepe a goblet juicy drink and a milk shake cost us 100 dollars and what a waste nothing tasted good. I would have rather visited Max Brenner and it would have been worth my money. This place uses celebrities to market and creates unique presentations to make it look like fun but has no quality or taste value. To wish someone happy Birthday costs you 5 dollars for a sparkler and a one inch rice crispie treat with whip cream on top.

The gift shop and the pictures of the celebrities who have been there are entertaining while you wait. We were seated on the top level of the restaurant which was decorated nicely. It took almost 15 minutes for the server to come to our table. We ordered the mai tai goblet, the lollipop goblet, the rocky road milkshake and the strawberry milkshake. Next time I would share the drinks because they are huge and overwhelmingly sweet. I personally think the goblets are fun to see and a great photo op, but I think they are overrated and overpriced. The goblets are $30 each and we barely drank ours. Even if we shared, I doubt we would have finished them. For food we ordered the mini burgers which were delicious, the philly burger which was portrayed differently on the menu than in person and the signature salad which was fine.

901,Th-7QFVWykyyB9Dv94dsZA,Ikeila T.,2.0 star rating,"We had heard so much about the sugar factory that we decided to go last Saturday while visiting New York from Philadelphia. The place was totally crowded Saturday night so we opted to go to the restaurant for lunch on Sunday after checking out of our hotel. When we arrived we were told that a table would be ready for us in 20 minutes which was fine so we waited. Loads of different families came in and were immediately seated. The ones who didn't have a reservation were offered to sit at the bar while they were waiting for tables. I immediately thought that was strange because we were never offered the option of sitting at the bar. My friend then goes to Mary( manager of sugar factory) and asked her how long did we have to continue waiting. She says 20 more minutes. This was after we had already waited 20 minutes. Mary, continued to over look us and  seat people that arrived at  tables AND AT THE BAR. So then we asked another waitress could we sit at the bar and she says YES. Apparently, they had a bar upstairs with AVAILABLE SEATING but as I stated the bar was NEVER offered to us as Mary did the other customers who arrived.Next- the 60oz goblet. we decided to share the lollipop was tons of candy. it was so pretty and smoking nothing I had ever seen before. BUT DONT BE FOOLED. For $37, I would like to at least Taste the alcohol and not a fruity drink that tasted like a big glass of mountain dew and kool aid. Sugar factory could add some more alcohol for the price. Food- The food is average nothing to boast about or sing praises. Actually I've had way better. Sorta reminds me of Nifty Fifties but my vote is for Nifty Fifty'sOverall, this place is overrated and the 60 oz goblets of Kool-Aid are a complete waste of money. Maybe children get a kick out of this place because of all of the sugary dessert and drink options but this place is definitely not someone I would visit again.

However, last night I got the full experience after a friend asked us to join her (she had been wanting to try to it for some time). We were told after calling earlier in the day to make a reservation that reservations were unnecessary since Sundays were slow. After showing up with our party of six, the hostess instructed us to wait at the bar and that she would get us when our table was ready. We waited 45 MINUTES. After asking for time updates twice, she kept telling us it would be ""5 more minutes."" I consulted with the group and we finally decided that we would just stay at the bar. The hostess insisted that we wait since ""they were just waiting for a table to pay their check."" Finally, we were seated at a table that had already been open for 20 minutes.We were already irritated, but on top of that, our group decided to order 3 drinks total since goblets are huge and are priced at $36 each before tax and tip. Those drinks took another century to make. Although they looked cute, I'd personally go for a more refined cocktail.Our waiter was friendly, but definitely did not make up for the rest of our encounters with the lackluster staff.

A photo of this place should be in the dictionary under ""bougie"".Everything is obscenely overpriced. It is $30 for a VIRGIN goblet and $36 for an alcoholic one (conveniently they leave the prices off the menus).6 of us split two orders of fries ($6 per order, they tasted no better than McDonalds fries) and two virgin goblets and it was $15 per person. If you get a birthday dessert, they charge you $5 just for the sparklers.Also, the place is set up like a restaurant, but they blast the music so loud you'd think you were in a club. It was impossible to have a conversation with the person across from you, much less down the table.Oh, and there's a bouncer who gives you a wristband at the door if you're 21+ to drink. My friends and I all had wrists bands but we're in our early twenties and I suppose we look like we could be underage, and I guess the waiter assumed because he brought us virgin goblets. Why bother handing out wristbands then, or why not at least clarify that the table you're serving wants alcohol and even card them again if you're unsure? Don't just assume, it was very rude.Will not be returning.

If you luck out you can get a reservation the day of like I did but most of the time you have to book in advance as this place gets packed very quickly. The drinks are okay but once you get to the bottom of them they really hurt your throat and nose when you try to drink them because of the nitrogen they use to make the drinks fog up. We ordered French fries (like that they are thinly cut) and asked for a side of aioli sauce and they gave us a side of plain mayonnaise....mayonnaise is not the same as aioli- they should of just told us they did not have any aioli instead of serving us mayonnaise without saying anything. 3 stars only because their drinks are adorable and the attending man after using the restroom was a TOTAL sweetheart who made small talk and handed you towels and everything. Everything is overpriced though and their gift shop has ""couture lollipops"" that cost about $22....what a joke. Also they should probably plaster their walls with more celebrities instead of just focusing on the Kardashians...literally so many pictures of them, which is cool and all but other celebrities who are famous exist too!!

Seriously, we all left this place with a case of Happy Birthday PTSD.The food is poor. Quantity over quality seems to be their motto. The pièce de résistance was the green (no joke... green) doughnut that topped my shake. In the menu, this is described as a ""chocolate covered Marshmallow glazed donut."" When we asked our waitress just what the green, cardboard-like, baked?? good actually was, she described it as a ""rainbow doughnut."" Nice try. I've had Entenmann's doughnuts WAY more appetizing than this excuse for food.I ordered two items, both of which were wrong when they came to the table (not prepared wrong, but the actual wrong item). A brief apology from the waitress on this, but... come on. They messed up my whole meal and I had to wait for the correct item while my friends ate. It was especially frustrating when the second-attempt at my shake appeared. I had explained that they didn't need to do all of the fuss that went on the top (chocolate covered glass and disgusting rainbow doughnut), just the shake that came in the glass. Well... the rocky road shake that promised ""Chocolate Ice Cream with Walnuts, Marshmallow and Chocolate Chip Pieces,"" was a plain chocolate shake.

The drink was definitely cool but definitely not worth the price and wait time.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

The food is okay, but if you are gonna come here then you must try the goblets, they are $36 which is pricey but like I said it's worth it. I got the Lollipop Passion goblet (it's the most popular). It was very crowded and we reached there a few minutes early to make sure we got our table but we had to wait for 15-20 minutes to get seated because there were so many people waiting to get seated. There are bathrooms upstairs which are clean (especially for NYC) and the decor is very bright and colorful which makes it a feast for the eyes during the day.

The drink was huge, however not to my liking but I only ordered one so I'm not sure if the others are tastier. This really seems like a place you would bring a child, (I know I know, bare with me) from the candy and all the sweets on the menu it was a little too juvenile to me.

The food was okay, I ordered the Caesar Salad with shrimp and the shrimps were extremely salty. The drinks are over-priced and the goblets don't taste the way you'd want it to taste, either it's way too strong or it tastes acidic.

I had a 6:30 reservation and because my whole party was not there, I decided to drink at the bar. Ramiro was a great bartender and provided great service. We probably waited for half hr and decided to ask if they could just seat us since 3 out of the 4 of us were there but the host said ""we can't do that because if she comes late, she won't be able to order."" That is the most absurd thing I have ever heard so we told her that we will just order for our friend then. Then the host said she will see what she can do. 15 minutes passes by and we decided to tell the host that we have 3 people now since they can't seem to sit 4 people. What table only holds 3 people anyways? Another 15 min passes by and a million people who were already waiting got their seats before us. It got so annoying that we had to go back and ask for our table again where the host then spoke on her walkie talkie that she needed a table for a group of 2, 3 and 6. Finally after 10 minutes, we were seated. Because of that experience, it definitely made me not want to go back. Food was also mediocre. It was a fun place but it was just a 1 time experience for me.

Sugar factory decided to change locations a couple weeks ago  (thank god)...but it would of been nice to have been notified,especially with a reservation! Nope we drove around clueless forever. Phone number listed was going to voicemail. Almost gave up until we just happened to stumble upon it. We were still seated promptly no issues. Place actually seemed unusually empty in the beginning (probably because no one knew they moved !!!)  I've tried coming here without reservations at the old location a couple times but the wait was ridiculous. Also would have been nice to know they cut out happy hour in the new location. Would have made later reservations had I known this didn't exist any longer. Those are my only complaints.SERVICE...Every single employee I came across was so pleasant. Our waiter Lamar (maybe Lamont?) he was great. Wish I could hire him as my personal waiter everywhere I went lol. Perfect. No complaints. DRINK...We ordered the famous lollipop gobs. I read other reviews about them being juicy (no alcohol) . So I fully prepared myself not to expect a good drink and that we were paying for the experience. LOL. Not. My drink was strong as f$&@!!! Def left tipsy. However , I did mention when I ordered how much I hate weak drinks, so I'm not sure if he got the memo or they are always strong. It was delicious, that's all I know. FOOD...I ordered the mac and cheese pops for an app and a cheeseburger for my entree. Ummmm I'm not sure how I felt about the food. The food was good but nothing spectacular. I didn't really like the menu options for dinner foods. The breakfast options sounded a lot better but I wasn't in the mood for breakfast. The food did come out fast and hot tho. DESERT... So the lil sis of course snitched that it was my birthday. The staff came out singing with an ice cream platter full of cookie dough and oreos and sparklers. It was cute,and festive ,and my face turned red.I loved it. This is a celebration kind of place imo. I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it as much as a casual outing.

I barely touched my entree because I bought the apps for the group and they didn't eat much out if shyness so I ate more than i planned on. The drinks were overly sweet, but that's what they're supposed to be. Don't be fooled by all the ice in the fishbowl drinks. Those suckers are strong! Our guys were toasted.

975,eMGHDxpztHXHybqZY2Cf2g,Yasin A.,1.0 star rating,"The worst restaurant I have been to ever! Long wait to get seated which was expected, but the biggest problem was when we were seated it took literally 2 hours to get the food and when we did it was the wrong order! The waitress kept saying they messed up the orders and had system issues. When we asked to speak to the manager he was so rude basically didn't care. Please avoid and save your self the hassle.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

Only to find out it was the Sugar Factory's own doing.   Won't ever go back and would never recommend this place.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"

The energy is more unified and amazing. The food and shakes were really good. The ambiance was full of life, great music and just a great place to enjoy a night out. I like to people watch and had a great time with the other guest. Go hungry because food, drinks will stuff you! My waiter, Named started with a C. Was amazing. His energy and attentiveness was much appreciated. Overall Great Time.",Sugar Factory,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Bars,, Candy, Stores,, American, (Traditional)"
