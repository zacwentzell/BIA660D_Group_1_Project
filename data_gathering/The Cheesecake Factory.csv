My husband and I just wanted a quick bite, so we ordered two of the same burgers cooked the same way exact way. The only difference is I ordered sweet potato fries and he had regular fries. Easy enough right? Wrong. Waited almost an hour for the two burgers. Meanwhile other customers that were seated after us got their food. We asked several times about our food and waitress kept saying it was on the way. Finally our food comes I'm guessing the manager on duty brings it out and there was no fries, and no bacon on the burger. So she had to go back to kitchen. That's just the first time. Second time brings the burgers but still the wrong order! No sweet potato fries. So she literally had to come back 3 times just to get our order right. I didn't even mention when we sat down my utensils were dirty and asked for new ones and the waitress never replaced them. I'm pregnant and starving I didn't even care at that point, I just wanted to finally eat, after a long hour+ of waiting. Manager did offer us a piece of cheesecake and apologized but still reeling from the terrible customer service. I work in customer service it's just such a shame when you get terrible service back. I was so tired from the long day I just wanted to pay and leave. But thinking back I should have remembered that manager's name so hopefully they can work on the terrible service here.

Jersey city is right next to NYC one of the greatest cities to eat anywhere in America, so if you want to eat good food just spend 2.75 on a subway ride and go to the city. I haven't had a worst experience anywhere in JC upto now. To begin with my experience we went on Thursday night at 9:30 pm for dinner. Firstly I went to the counter to ask for a table for 3 and they gave me a buzzer and told me it's a 15 min wait while half of the restaurant was empty, but that's ok  maybe that's their policy. I waited and after 10 mins the buzzer went off, I took it to the counter and the lady took it without telling me where the table is. I was just standing there waiting for her to guide after another 10 mins I asked so where's the table since you took the buzzer she tells me go stand on another side. There were 10 people who came after me and got seated before me, thank god for another server who came and asked me why are you standing here so I told him well my buzzer went off I'm waiting for my table, he asked for my name and told me I was looking for you since the past 10 mins we have your table ready come with me. So in short the 15 min wait turned into a 35 min wait. Once we got seated we were given the menus while the server took another 15 mins to come take our order. That's ok but once she took the order she vanished in thin air and was nowhere to be seen for good 20 mins, by then I was done with the place so I called the manager and asked him about the update on the food he said it's on it's way so I politely asked him to serve us atleast the on the house bread basket, he said it should be out any min so I asked him isn't that served with the menus he said yes it is I'll get back to you, he went in the kitchen and never came around us again. So yes no bread basket was served to us, we finally got our appetizer served after 30 mins which were the nachos and they were I would say 6 on 10. The food came after another 10 mins, out of which the bang bang shrimps were awful (if I could give it a number it was -5 on 10) but the pasta was nice. All in all a peaceful dinner which should have ended by max 11 ended around midnight.

We came here for lunch, and when dinner time came, despite not being hungry, we scrolled through Seamless for half an hour until we decided to order from the CF twice in one day. The food from this chain is alway decent but never exceeds expectations other than with its sheer portion size. The inaptly named Skinnylicious menu should just be the regular menu. Even the Superfoods section consists of dishes well over 1k calories. Flavorwise, both the vegan cobb and the salmon salad are tasty, and so is the free bread.

The food has been pretty good so far with my personal favorite being the southern chicken sliders. They offer a few lemonade mixes but all seem to be a little to sweet. Most recent visit, they have added a few more items to their menu and the kids menu has plenty of different options. My son ordered salmon, broccoli, and French fries which looked and tasted awesome.

The chicken taquitos were cold and tasteless with no hint of chicken in them. Drinks: Absolutely watered down.Service: The server (Dominique K) seemed disinterested, took a while to get the bread, forgot the straw and had to be asked 3 times to get us a box at the end. We saw staff at other tables being much more friendly and attentive to their patrons.Overall: Will never repeat.

My first experience here was dine in, my date and I were seated promptly, waitress was very helpful and well mannered. As an appetizer, we chose the Tex Mex egg rolls. I ordered the farfalle with pancetta, mushrooms, and chicken (minus the peas and carmelized onions that usually come with it). I also opted for spaghettini instead of farfalle and my waiter graciously accepted my alterations. My date went for the chicken alfredo. Both dishes came to us piping hot, beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. The Cheesecake Factory goodness that I fondly remember from years ago. Unfortunately my delivery experience was far from as pleasant as the dine in.Last night, via DoorDash, my date and I went for TCF again. He went for the turkey burger with cheese and french fries on the side. I went for the same pasta, instead I got shrimp instead of chicken in it. The food came fairly cold, there were still onions in mine, the shrimp was tough and cold, and they didn't put any pancetta in even though I didn't ask for that to be removed. There was also no sauce in it. It seemed like they made the dish in a pan, drained the remaining sauce and let it sit and dry out for 30 minutes. My date's burger was a little cold but seemingly good, although the fries were no dice; soggy and cold. I know that I had a few alterations but I really can't see myself sending out a such a crappy dish like this, being in their place. Can't see myself ordering delivery from ever again.

In terms of portion and quality although service was good. Me and my husband ordered one appetizer of Avocado Toast and an entree of Tuscan Chicken. We split the entree to two. Avocado Toast- 1/5        It is one of my favorite dish and here at cheesecake it is the worst thing I ever had. The bread was too rough even the avocado spread on it could not make it soggy.Tuscan Chicken - 3/5         It has very small pieces of chicken breast and the plate was covered in oil and lemon juice.

My girlfriend and I shared a filet mignon medium and they let us substitute the mashed potatoes and beans for asparagus and grilled broccoli. The asparagus came at a small of charge though, but that was okay. We actually then order dessert and got Godiva brownie sundae- it was really good. I typically order from the skinnylicious menu, but was craving a protein other than chicken. The Fiji Waters were a bit expensive at about $ 4 a bottle.

I loved my shrimp pasta and got a good kick out of my friend's spicy Thai chicken (actually don't even know if it's called that).So the lesson is: don't be alarmed that you'll go over your calorie intake in less than 45 minutes and don't let the 1000 items on the menu dissuade you from ordering too much :) Better advice: don't wear skinny jeans to this meal.Oh, and the cheesecake IS amazing.

79,jIR29peLh0O4zIAQ3NfxpQ,Angela R.,1.0 star rating,"My sister came to visit from Florida and we were in the Newport Mall to see a movie. We then decided to eat at this location in the mall even though I'm not a big fan of how big theIr menu is. I know it sounds weird but it's almost like they have TOO many options, but to appease my sister we went for it. We were a party of three and seated fairly quickly. The place looked like it was dying down around 9:45pm. We sat for about 5 minutes before a waitress came over and she took our drink order and brought over warm bread. She seemed nice enough and said she'd be back with our drinks in a few minutes. At this point, I took a deep breath and began to examine the menu. It took me almost 10-15 minutes to finally make a decision on my meal but low and behold we hadn't even gotten our drinks yet. My sister and my son had already picked out their meals and were looking around for the waitress. After an additional 5 minutes, she came with our drinks and then we ordered right away. I ordered the Parmesan herb crusted chicken, my son; the ribeye steak, and my sister order lettuce chicken wraps and edamame. So we're sipping our drinks and eating bread, conversing and enjoying our time together when I realize that we still haven't gotten our food. The time? 10:50pm. I looked around and there wasn't a trace of our server. I asked a hostess walking by if she could find our server as our food was taking long. She seemed disinterested and said she'd find our server. 2 minutes later wouldn't you know it? The hot food finally comes out, minus my sisters lettuce wraps and edamame. Well, we wait like 5 more minutes and her meal comes out. It's important to note that we STILL have not seen our server since she took our order. So I take a bite and I have to admit its pretty good, not the best meal ever but decent. Finally the sever came by and at this point we were just glad we got our food so we asked for refills and continued our meal. Then, it happened. My sister took a bite of one of the wraps and immediately spit out the chicken cause she said it tasted strange. She bit into the chicken and we saw it; the chicken was COMPLETELY raw. And what's worse is that she had eaten most of it already. At this point, we proceeded to wait another 10 minutes to grab someone, anyone's attention. I managed to flag down the same hostess and ask for a manager. Another 10 minutes and a manager shows up. I explain the current situation and the long wait time and the absence of our server and she simply said she'd take the wraps off the bill and was sorry. The server then shows up and apologized and offered dessert. We ordered a dulce de leche cheesecake to go just cause we wanted to get the hell out of there. She brought the cheesecake and the check after another 10 minutes and when I opened the check, I was appalled. The manager comped the lettuce wraps but the charge for the cheesecake was on the bill. I mean, come on? Really? Your server offered dessert and you couldn't even comp the dessert or even the drinks??? Where is the customer service?? I was so pissed at that point. I just paid and left a 15% tip which I never do cause I worked in a restaurant for over a decade and I ALWAYS take care of my fellow servers. I know it's not an easy job and you gotta put up with a lot of BS but I also know that it is managements job to get it right and I feel very strongly that this location dropped the ball. In total, we spent almost an hour and a half in that place. And about 15 minutes of that was spent actually eating.

They have amazing service, great food, and beautiful ambience.This is my go-to place at least 1 a week. Their portions are really big that it is fit for 2 people! Whenever I go, I always order the fried cheese, avocado toast, and their chipotle pasta! I would rate them 5/5! However, the last time we went, not only did our waiter forget about our order for a half hour, we ordered their new dish called ""Korean style cauliflower"" and it came really cold and soggy. It is only good if it is hot and crispy.  Always go during their happy hour on weekdays. Appetisers for about $5-$7!

He kept saying that it was someone else ordered the wrong food and overrided his order. But he couldn't explain what happened. So don't go there if you don't have enough time to wait. P.S.

I've visited this location twice this past month, and I've come to notice that you either get service that's 50% attentive or none at all (Note to Cheesecake-gotta aim for that 100%). For example, during today's visit I ordered a New York steak well done and what I got was medium with lots of pink. Sent it back and noticed that only the side that I had cut was browned while the rest was still pink-maybe the cook thought I was color blind. Ended up just taking it to go because I was full from the appetizer round and figured I'd cook it again at home.

He took our order making special note of my allergy to tomato. In no time our food arrived looking absolutely delicious. We were chewing down and Ty gave us a check to see if we were fine.

He still kept up with that huge group that looked like they were having a ball!Our dishes were removed when we were done and Ty promptly took our desert request.

Her slice was a mess in the container before we left. It shouldn't change the taste. I'll get a report when she eats it. Second, every time we've been to eat at this location we have had something flying around our food. Once it was a fly. Today it was a little bug of some kind.

Yum! The tropical-flavored house iced tea is always a welcomed refreshing treat to wash it all down.  I didn't taste the other items that my family order but all I heard was ""nom, nom, nom..."" as we all stuffed our hungry faces so that's always a good sign.  For dessert, we shared the banana cheesecake and the turtle cheesecake.  If you have ever had Cheesecake Factory cheesecake, you know that they don't play when it comes to the cheesecake in terms of the size of their menu and the flavor.  I spent many an evening at The Cheesecake Factory when they first opened and began expanding beyond Atlanta all the way to the San Francisco Bay Area.  All in all, even though I don't visit often nowadays, the Cheesecake Factory still holds a special place in my heart for nostalgia's sake if nothing else and I was happy to find that the food was still what I expected and the martini menu is still on point!",The Cheesecake Factory,3.0 star rating,$$,"Desserts,, American, (New),, Seafood"

She seemed very nice, smiled and Took our order. Then I barely saw her. I was with two kids and my boyfriend. After the kids food came she got lost. She never brought me the water I asked for, for the whole table. She never came to bring us bread. She didn't bring me the drink I ordered which was a smoothie. She comes back in what seemed like forever to me and I then had to ask her for bread because she didn't seem like she was ever going to bring it and I felt like I was starving to death. Still didn't bring me my water or my drink. Didn't come back to check if the kids food was okay or if they needed anything. The kids are almost done with their food and she STILL didn't come back with my water or bread or anything. By this point I was BEYOND frustrated and starving half to death. Another waiter by the name Yoval not sure his position but must of noticed the frustration in my face because he randomly came up to us and asked if we would want some bread. He was awesome compared to my waiter who lacked bunch of waiter skills. Then she came with my drink after she saw him helping us. Not sure if she had too many tables or if she just kept forgetting about us because she didn't even apologize the times she did happen to come back. He also came around to see if we needed refills on our drinks. She came and gave us the dessert menu and then never came back. The same gentleman kept looking at us and eventually came to see what we wanted to order.

Came out fast an hot I guess when I told her I was starving she new I meant it I was 8 months pregnant ready to eat anything lolMy children's loves it here, there kids meals are yummy my boys had chicken tenders an frys.Sounds so boring and simple but they actually where really good. I enjoyed my entree as well as my husband. Now let's get down to the cheesecakes OMG so many flavors so delicious. How can one control them selfs here. I love cheese cake We ordered 3 cheese cake to stay an a huge cake to go not realizing how much an how big of a portion they serve.

We had never been there and everybody talks about it , what looks to be a promising place with a dark bar like atmosphere seem to have good promise but we were extremely disappointed by the food. The service was OK , the waitress was very busy to check up on her table every so often. We did order some food,  two of my guests had burgers which came out terrible. They had to be returned and still came out wrong. No seasoning and did not know what medium term was. I had some steak dish which was just ok. Took two pieces of overpriced cheesecake home which one was good and the other had to go to the trash. I do not recommend this place to anybody especially for the price you will pay you're better off going to a burger  place maybe even the one next to them.

Our waitress apologized multiple times explaining that she had been busy running all over the place. It was the night before Valentines Day so you would think they'd staff accordingly. After ordering our drinks it took about 15 minutes before we saw our waitress again to take our food order. Then it was another half hour for our food to arrive. There were 5 people in our party and 2 of the orders came incorrectly. For one, a well done steak came out very red/pink. Didn't bother asking for a new order because of how long we had already been waiting. We also overheard the table next to us complaining to their waitress about their orders coming out wrong as well. Unfortunately we could not find a manager to vent our frustrations.

I usually enjoy the food and get good service at other locations, but it seems like this one can't seem to figure out how to do that. My visit to this location was on 1/14 at around 7:30- the wait was 30 minutes which was fine, however the bathrooms were disgusting. I told the hostess this and asked if she could get anyone to clean them, and she said ""no, we do that at the end of the night"". Well, okay, I guess the only guests that get clean bathrooms are the ones that go as soon as they open? I let it go as we were being seated, our server was awful. We asked for the bread that is normally brought out when you get seated three times, and finally got it with our appetizers. We were unable to get refills on our drinks in a timely manner, it doesn't seem that hard but I guess that would have been too much for our server. Every part of the meal came out burnt, but because we had to wait so long to order our appetizers we ate them anyway. We had the fried macaroni and cheese and the Factory nachos- the Factory nachos we did not eat, the chips were black. So we order our entrees, three of the same burger- they all came out burnt, they were completely black- not the way meat should look. I try a bite of mine, end up not being able to eat it, one is untouched and the third was half eaten because our server couldn't do her job and we were starving because we waited so long to order each time. 20 minutes pass as we are awkwardly sitting there waiting for our server to ask how the food is, so we can tell her there is an obvious issue. She finally comes and we ask for the manager, the manager comes and I explain the problem with our food. Normally management should respond positively, but unfortunately my valid complaints were just met with argument from this man. As I told him the nachos were burnt and clearly were mostly untouched, he says ""no we just like to give them more crisp, they aren't burnt"". So I pick up one of the many black chips and show it to him, where he finally agreed they were burnt. As for the burgers, we said we did not want them as we had to wait 20 minutes to even let anyone know there was a problem- the manager insists we should get new ones instead of getting them off the check because he doesn't understand why we would wait so long- but finally acquiesces to take two burgers off our check. Though we still had to pay for the uneaten, burnt nachos. Maybe if the service wasn't awful we would have been able to fix the many problems we had with our meal, but unfortunately the restaurant is not clean, the food is not good and management seems unable to fix guests issues.",The Cheesecake Factory,3.0 star rating,$$,"Desserts,, American, (New),, Seafood"

They hostess was unapologetic and made us walk all the way back to the hostess station (past plenty of open/clean tables). When they finally sat us the floor was filthy and table was sticky. We went on a Saturday afternoon around 130 and the place was not exceptionally crowded at all. The family who eventually was seated next to us had a baby and requested a booth which they did not give them. The mom was requesting a booth and the hostess told them they would have to go back and wait again even though the booth across from us was open. Then proceeded to take 15 min to bring them a height chair. The only reason this location didn't get one star was because we had James m. as our server and he made up for the lack of customer service the rest of the team presented with.

146,-Nwfq0S_6fBdJ1QSwYgMGg,Lewis M.,3.0 star rating,Overall the wait service is occasionally slow but the food is typically good. My suggestion would be to offer some healthier low carb options with your entrees? Example instead of just pasta offer spaghetti squash or instead of mashed potatoes offer cauliflower mash. Give your customer the option for a healthier food choice. You are on the right path with offering low carb cheesecake but your company needs to make greater strides in meeting the needs of people that are health conscious and following a low carb lifestyle. Some of us would much rather save our carbohydrates for your delicious cheesecake and not consume a weeks worth of carbs for one dinner/dessert. Definitely something for you guys to look into for the millions of people like myself that follow a low carb diet and are living healthier lives but still enjoy the occasional splurge. I appreciate your response about the skinnylicious menu however that is lower calorie not low carb. The sugar and carb content is what is creating the obesity epidemic. Perhaps you could add cauliflower mash or spaghetti squash to that menu. Thanks for listening and hopefully will result in a small change.

The menu was so long I really wanted a recommendation. Food: The Fried Macaroni appetizer was incredible. For my entree I ordered the chicken Marsala.

We didn't even finish the appetizer. I ordered tasteless, greasy, Chicken Piccata, which looked like something you'd get at an army base. The portions were really small (it was like chicken tenders drenched in greasy butter sauce), and the noodles were overcooked.

I have always enjoyed eating at Cheesecake Factory, so when one opened up a few miles from my house I was super excited. I have been to this location several times and mostly I solo dine at the bar. This review can be credited to Ally who is bartending this Monday afternoon. She is super friendly and efficient. I was never offered bread at the bar prior to today's experience. I usually order 1 or 2 small plates for myself. She always made sure my glass of water was full! I am super critical of dining out because I work in the restaurant industry.

We had high expectations for the desserts but did not know what to expect with the rest of the food. It turned out that both entrees that we had, the Chicken Bellagio and the Miso Salmon, we're excellent. Ironically it was the cheesecakes (Salted Caramel and Chocolate Tuxedo Cream) that didn't overwhelm us - they were okay. Would definitely go back for the entrees that we had but would try something else for dessert.  Our server Tamara was also extremely friendly and helpful though she was stretched thin at times.",The Cheesecake Factory,3.0 star rating,$$,"Desserts,, American, (New),, Seafood"

We were seated and given menu's.We ordered a passion fruit margarita (served in a martini glass) which was extremely too sweet, again it taste like chemicals and not freshly made. Our server brought us water but for some reason put no ice in it so it was luke warm. We didn't get any bread, and like the table next to us we had to ask our server for it.For the appetizer we got the zucchini, mushroom and avocado batter dipped ($6.95). There were 2 pieces of avocado and the rest was all soggy mushroom and zucchini pieces. Not good at all. They also threw Parmesan on top of it which made the sogginess worse.For the entree I ordered the Luau Salad which did not taste fresh at all. The salad was wilted and soggy. They also put way too much dressing in the salad. The crisp part was drowning in dressing, which had a chemical taste. Nothing tastes fresh.We decided to try the strawberry cheesecake (since it my husband's first time to Cheesecake Factory) and the strawberries ARE NOT fresh (like the menu states) but drowning in a strawberry concentrate and is extremely sugary and taste like corn syrup.Very disappointing experience. The food sucks as well as the ambiance.Complete waste of $70 (we also were not given an itemized receipt when we asked for the check, and were unable to locate our server to get one).",The Cheesecake Factory,3.0 star rating,$$,"Desserts,, American, (New),, Seafood"

The food seemed to be slow coming out, the appetizers about 30 minutes after we ordered, one which was the wrong item and corrected quickly and the entrees, another 30 minutes later, with 2 of the 5 delayed another few minutes.All in all, we spent over 2 hours when it should have only been 1.

Probably won't order that again though. James was great with keeping our cups full and answering any questions we had.CHEESECAKE TIME! We ordered two kinds, the red velvet cake and the white chocolate macadamia caramel cheesecake. My boyfriend liked them both.

It's ridiculous how little alcohol it takes to give me a nice buzz.  Finishing a single drink is hard for me to do.  I downed a huge Caribbean style drink and didn't feel a thing, which means only one thing .... their drinks have hardly any alcohol in them. So we finally order dinner.  I had a craving for the fish & chips.  It was so greasy I couldn't eat it.  What's worse is that when I brought it home my pets wouldn't touch it either.  It came with fries (which I normally don't eat) but since I wasn't eating that fish, I tried a couple.  They were also greasy and tasted just like fish.  It turns out they cook the fish and the fries in the same oil.

I was really looking forward to having the tiramisu cheese cake, because that's what I always have.........BUT it was not good at this location, it tasted old and not worth buying.",The Cheesecake Factory,3.0 star rating,$$,"Desserts,, American, (New),, Seafood"

It was busy so we went straight to the bar & luckily someone one was leaving, so we had a zero wait time. The table was cleaned up right away & menus were put down.  Our waitress was friendly & took the time to review & give drink recommendations. I had already read other yelp reviews, so went in the expectation of slow service, which I can't disagree with those reviews. It was Friday night, busy, realize the place is still new & in no rush, so it didn't bother me. Apps & drinks came out in a timely matter once the order was put in, all was tasty & satisfying!

204,kw_unRenFD-ModrsLLL2_g,Victoria C.,4.0 star rating,"Food: BThe food here was awesome mostly. We started with the Fried Calamari, and it came with both a garlic aioli and cocktail sauce - super tasty - and I noticed that the squid was very tender. Every time I order fried calamari, it's usually quite tough - it was ~delish~ here. The aioli, I think, consisted mainly of mayo - not complaining about, since it was SO good - but I wish it had been lighter so I didn't immediately feel my arteries clog up after taking one bite. Would have loved to eat more of it. The cocktail sauce was a more refreshing alternative. I actually really enjoy fried calamari with marinara sauce, though, so I wish that they had provided that as well. For our entrees we got the Chicken Bellagio and the Herb Crusted Salmon and Shrimp Scampi combo. The chicken dish was a breaded chicken breast over angel hair pasta (with a light pesto?) topped with prosciutto and arugula. My boyfriend loved it, and it came in a large portion. He has a good appetite and didn't finish it. Can't say the same about my combo dish, which also came with (a small amount of) mashed potatoes. It wasn't a huge problem for me since I still barely finished it - I was so full from the bread, appetizer and also barely touched the side of fries that I ordered (so unlike me). The presentation of this dish wasn't impressive, since the portions were small and it was spaced out over such a large dish. But the shrimp scampi was cooked very well - the sauce was absolutely delicious. Gotta warn you though, if garlic isn't your thing, I wouldn't get the shrimp scampi. Luckily, I LOVE garlic. As for the salmon, meh - overcooked IMO. I like my salmon with the center still a bit tender/soft, but it was tough/crumbly. The ""herb crusted"" part apparently just meant that some herbs were thrown on top of it. It just didn't look (or taste) that appetizing. A bit disappointing. After dinner, we ordered a slice of the chocolate mousse cheesecake to share, which we've had before, and it was super rich and chocolatey. It was very heavy, so I would recommend ordering a tall glass of milk or something on the side. I could barely eat any since I was so full already, but I really wish I could have eaten more of it.Service: AThe service here was great - our waitress was very friendly but not intrusive. She was patient when we needed some time to look at the menu, and she was also good with timing - how much time we needed to look at the menu, when to space out our bread, appetizer, and entrees, etc. Our wine was taking a bit due to a backup at the bar, so she was kind enough to give us a heads up so we weren't left wondering if it was forgotten. She checked up on us to see how our food was after giving us enough time to actually eat a bit (some waiters ask only a moment after setting the food down, and I'm like...I've barely touched my food yet...) Timing is a huge thing when it comes to waiting tables. Good timing makes the patrons feel comfortable, relaxed and able to enjoy their meal; poor timing gives customers an experience where they feel rushed, impatient, and/or uncomfortable or even frustrated. I distinctly noticed that she was very good at her job.Ambiance: BThis Cheesecake Factory is a part of the Newport Mall. We were seated in the ""patio"" area, outside the restaurant but inside the halls of the mall. They made sure to ask to make sure it was okay to be seated here. Seems weird since people shopping at the mall walk past you, but it wasn't that bad. I actually thought that we had a bit more privacy here than we would have inside, where it was super busy. I was a little concerned that because we were kind of separate from the rest of the tables, we would be forgotten (it happens) and the waitress would busy herself with the customers in the main area, but it was totally fine - our waitress was very attentive :) *thumbs up* A heads up, the patio area has patio furniture (wrought iron tables and all weather wicker sofas to sit on which was comfortable). Not everyone's cup of tea - some people might like the ""fancier"" vibe inside, but this was totally fine for us, even better since it was quieter and we could have a conversation.Other (Sanitation): CWhen we were seated, we saw that the table had not been cleaned properly - grease marks all over. After I asked our waitress about it, she sent someone over to wipe it, and the guy apologized. Understandable since the metal that the table was made of made it hard to see whether it was a grease mark or drying water. But what was annoying after that, though, was that they later gave us spoons for our cheesecake (dessert after our meal) that were also not very clean. Both my boyfriend and I took a look at our respective spoons and dipped them into a water glass and wiped them down before we felt comfortable enough to use them... Not ideal, especially after already giving us a table that hadn't been cleaned properly *thumbs down*Overall, I had a great time here and would come back! :)",The Cheesecake Factory,3.0 star rating,$$,"Desserts,, American, (New),, Seafood"

The place is beautiful but they need better seating arrangements for customers who are waiting for over an hour just to be seated. We waited outside because there was just too many people waiting to be seated. As we waited out side the restaurant too many teenagers where walking past I was wondering if I was going to have front row tickets to see a fight break out. Honestly I felt unsafe for the little girl I had with me and for my boyfriends safety because security wasn't doing there job!So after a hour and a half the buzzer finally rings we had sometime to look at the menu on our phone and knew what we wanted. I ordered  pasta Da Vinci it was awesome. My boyfriend ordered the bacon bacon burger he loved it. And the little lady had the cheese pizza for kids and that was a thumbs up in her book!! The wait staff needs better training. We had to keep reminding the waitress to bring out our drinks more then three times and when she finally did of course we finished our sodas not a minute after we got them. And we had to keep reminding her to bring the kid size milkshake she needed to keep checking on. All in all the food was good.

After all, if this place was bad, there wouldn't be so many people inside.

You should definitely try it out and have a taste for your self!!! I recommend the steak diane and the Godiva cheesecake for sure! P.S. Come around 2-3ish pm.

There is definitely some issues with management: - Too many staff members not really serving anyone. There were 4 people behind the host stand, chatting and laughing with eachother... never looking me in the eye. I felt ignored. - The waitress was nice, but seemed overworked. She was hard to find throughout the meal- One of our appetizers never came out..... by the time the entrees came we didn't want it anymore - I ordered a burger and the bottom of the bun was soggy wet. I couldn't find the waitress and had to flag down another staff member (also asking for ketchup). I got a new bun, but the meal wasn't very good due to this. The ketchup eventually came - 10 minutes later. - Waitstaff always seemed rushed, and asking for things like refills on drinks was hard to do because I felt I always had to chase down someone. - I felt that becuase an appetizer never came out and the burger bun was so soggy, there would have been some sort of apology (a free apetizer, soda, dessert... something) Nothing was ever offered and because of this, I probably won't be back for sometime to come. Overall, I give this place a subpar review (especially relative to other locations throughout the US). There were a few things that were on-par but there is a lot of work that needs to be done.

251,NB0ndm2gBWKTYu0To3OwxQ,G E.,1.0 star rating,"The service and management at this Cheesecake Factory located in Newport Mall, Jersey City has gone from poor to terrible. The first time I ever made an attempt to visit was shortly after they opened 2 years ago. I loved the establishment in other locations, and was always pleased with the Miso Salmon dish for nearly 16 years without a problem. I tried to pick up an order at the Newport Mall location shortly after they opened and they kept me on hold for 15-20 minutes or more (sounds unbelievable right...yeah I know, I couldn't believe it either). After all that hold time they still never took my order. I hung up the phone and opted for another restaurant  The last time I visited was last year. I ordered salmon that tasted somewhat like old fish, it was so bad I actually couldn't eat it and had to send it back (something I really hate to do). I then asked for chicken and biscuits as a substitute and they told me it was sold out.  Tonight I went back. We waited 15 minutes to be seated (with no one ahead of us) even though there were empty seats and I was told our wait would be short. Staff was nonchalant about clearing and cleaning the tables that were recently vacated by previous patrons.   I proceeded to the men's restroom once we were seated, and to my surprise there was absolutely no hand soap! I asked staff could i get some soap. After 5 minutes of waiting near the restroom for soap, I saw staff approach the manager who gave a nonchalant gesture toward my direction. Staff then gave a shameful look in my direction and went back to preparing tables. I waited another couple of minutes and approached the same staff, who then went on another search. This time the hostess went to the restroom to check. When she came out of the women's room without soap I asked her for soap. She said ok. Then the manager who wouldn't move to help me before finally comes in my direction to apologize. He blamed the lack of soap on the mall being closed at the time and said they're waiting for a shipment. I didn't believe him. Needless to say, a restaurant should always have soap in the restroom at all times, otherwise the restaurant itself should be closed.   Another 2-3 minutes later the manager comes back with soap from the kitchen. I waited for soap so long until my sister who accompanied me thought something bad possibly happened and told my son to check on me.  I ordered chicken and biscuits. The waitress was pleasant, but my chicken and mashed potatoes was lukewarm, and the biscuits were cold. I was afraid to send it back after the poor service I already received. I begrudgingly ate it with a resolve that I would never return to this establishment again.  This place is giving the Cheesecake Factory franchise a bad reputation. They really need to do something about this. If anyone wants to try Cheesecake Factory, don't go to the Newport Mall Jersey City location. Choose another location, or you might be as disappointed as I was and am now.",The Cheesecake Factory,3.0 star rating,$$,"Desserts,, American, (New),, Seafood"

My friends and I came in on 2/13 for  lunch around 2:30pm, The restaurant was quite empty. Our server came right up and was quite attentive at first. He went ahead took our order, 20+min later no food and no server in site. Our drinks were empty we had to ask other employees for refills. Finally, our waiter saw us and noticed we had no food, he was like let me go check but never made eye contact or asked if we needed anything. It took approximately 40 min for our food to arrive at our table. This is unacceptable for a restaurant that wAs not busy. The food was dropped off and again our server went missing. Each rare time he would pass by we would try just over look our table. We wanted to order dessert and once again it was a mission to locate our server. He finally came by took our dessert ordered and dropped off our check. When I took a look at my check I noticed that he Charged me for a dinner dish when I specifically told him the lunch size. When I brought it to his attention he wanted to start arguing with me saying I was wrong. He finally sorry let me get that fixed. After fixing the check our dessert took approx 15 min to arrive at our table as well as our revised check. I forgot to add that the server was also waiting the table behind us and he also messed up their order. In the end, this has been clearly the worst experience I have had at a Cheesecake Factory and I have been to many all over the country.

I can say first hand from seeing the behind the scenes at several restaurants that the cheesecake factory is top quality. The restaurant has very high standards for the quality of their food and service. The food is all prepared fresh daily along with fresh fish. The sauces are prepared to order. The dressings are made from scratch. It is all delicious. My favorite thing is the variety. There are over 250 items on the menu including skinilicious items and vegatarian items.Do not be turned off by the wait- there is a reason for it. The food is great and they try their best to not send food to the table that is not up to their standards. I've personally seen a manager try a sauce for a dish and make the kitchen remake the whole thing. The manager chose to make the guest wait for a quality product and even bought them dessert after explaining why they were making them wait.Just a note... don't order brown bread or pumpernickel...it's whole wheat!,The Cheesecake Factory,3.0 star rating,$$,"Desserts,, American, (New),, Seafood"

It's nice to be served by someone who knows their stuff. The session included a complimentary beverage, a shared appetizer, entree and shared desert. For drinks I had a Blueberry Mojito, it wasn't to berry-y or minty. It was the perfect blend and refreshing. My mom had a glass of moscato and they're not stingy with the pour. The appetizer we chose was the fried chicken sliders, they were huge! and spicy. My entree was the fettuccini Alfredo which I didn't like. the noodles were tooo chewy and the sauce was underseasoned. My mom had the everything pizza pie which she enjoyed. it had pepperoni, mushrooms, spinach and something else i can't recall. On the the cheesecake which is always the best part. The Dulce De Leche caramel cheesecake was delicious. It's really sweet so it may be too sweet for some but it was perfect for me.",The Cheesecake Factory,3.0 star rating,$$,"Desserts,, American, (New),, Seafood"

Then she told us it was a mistake and the table wasn't ready, which would've been nice to know before making us walk the whole way thru the restaurant. Then our waiter came and took our orders but it took forever for him to come. I had to flag someone else down twice to get the waiter. I ordered a drink and he never delivered my drink. We ordered the hot cheese and spinach dip as the appetizer and it was great. I was then ready to order the main entree and it took him at least a half an hour to come. I ordered my entree (the farfalle with chicken and garlic) and it was very tasty. Had absolutely no complaints and the portion sizes were reasonable. I asked him again for my drink (Mai Tai margarita) and he said he would get it. Second time around, STILL no drink and I decided to just call it quits. Then when we were ready to pay, he did not come back until for another 15 minutes. We assumed to just pay one front register then, until the waiter FINALLY came and said ""where do you think you're going""? I told him we were going to pay in the front and he rudely said ""NO, YOU PAY ME!!"" Well, yes, but you never showed up, so we assumed you forgot, and were just going to go the register which was right next to our table. Should not have even given him a 20% tip given his attitude and his ability to forget my Mai Tai cocktail TWICE.

Had a 50 minute wait for a table, it was pretty busy but we did see tables that were free but just not being flipped quickly enough. When we eventually got seated, our server was nice and took drinks/food order, the drinks took a fair amount of time to be brought to the table and the order was not complete. Probably took around 20-30 minutes to receive complete drinks order. Appetizers took around 30-40 minutes to be brought up, we had literally just finished our Apps when they brought the entree's up. The app plates had not even been cleared, the entree orders were wrong (One contained meat for a vegetarian...Even though we made it absolutely clear that the order should not contain meat) for two of the party and one was sent back completely. I just lived with the mistake on mine as i did not want to wait an eternity for it to be changed. One of the managers came over and comp'd one app and took the entree off the bill that had to be sent back due to length of time it took to receive the food and then the lack of break between courses. I get that this place is new and they are ironing out the kinks but we were hearing that other tables were being comp'd food due to the wait times. There are a ton of staff working at the restaurant but there just seems to be a lack of direction for them...Maybe management needs to step in more and direct as it seems that no one seems to know what they are doing there.

So we move up to the desk, and the host decided that now would be a good time to start shooting the breeze with her friend, (could've been a coworker not sure on that) for what ends up being 5 minutes. She completely ignores our presence. For 5 whole minutes. Now, we are the only two standing there. No one blocking her view of us. No way she could've missed us. She just chose to ignore us. When she was finally done with her very important  convo, we ask to be seated.  There's a wait because they're ""short staffed"". Mind you the restaurant was probably half filled, if that. Plenty of available tables! We were so beyond annoyed at this point that we decide to buy a cheesecake and get the hell out of Dodge. Here's where the three stars come into play... the gentlemen who helped us at the counter was a doll. Very attentive, very sweet! It was much appreciated after being blatantly ignored by the host.
