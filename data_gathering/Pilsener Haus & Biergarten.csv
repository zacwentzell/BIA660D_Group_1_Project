0,T9xLOjbWITOK0DiEdCOyTw,Laura E.,5.0 star rating,"Every time I can't make it on a Tuesday, I get major FOMO because that 50% deal is too good!!! I've had the kielbasa, the grilled chicken sausage and the bratwurst from the grill, which were all delicious and came with a heaping side of french fries and sauerkraut ($12, normally). After ordering, you wait around 10-20 minutes, depending on how crowded it is, and then pay at the register. The utensils are on the side of the grill, as well as the sauce pumps and napkins.Recently we came and ordered some of the entree dishes from the kitchen. The schnitzel ($19), a pork cutlet, came with a side of parsley potatoes, pickled cucumbers and lingonberry sauce - the portion was so large we needed to take it home. The side of french fries ($4) were huge and fed the four of us like an appetizer. Now the show stopper- you need to get the Bavarian Soft Pretzel ($11). It's not like your NYC pushcart pretzel, this is the real deal. It comes out incredibly soft and warm, and tastes absolutely delicious dipped in the grainy mustard and the cheese. Honestly, I could just eat 3 of these for dinner and live a happy life. As for the beer, the menu is extensive, and a little overwhelming. I've tried the Stiegel, Pilsner Original and Oktoberfest and all paired well with the meat. I also tried my friend's grapefruit canned cider, which was light and fruity. The bathrooms are clean, and seating gets really tight at around 6, do come early. The line for the grill gets lengthy real fast, and ordering entrees from the kitchen is just as good. There's outdoor seating which is pleasant during the warmer months, and is super aesthetic.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

Second, they have a lot of space... outdoor, indoor and even a second floor. Third, they have food, lots of grilled meats and sausage, but I've only had the pretzel... and it's perfection.  Fresh baked and warm with a crisp exterior that snaps when you break off a piece. It's salty but not overly coated in salt granules (that you end up rubbing off anyway). The interior is fully cooked and fluffy, not doughy. It's large and filling but doesn't leave a lump in your tummy like some heavier pretzel. Simply delicious. Fourth, they have events, drink specials, and guest djs.

I would suggest you split it so that you have room for the turkey burger I just convinced you to order.

Young students, professionals, and mom's with strollers all come here.  Tuesdays are the busiest I hear, and it's understandable as most things off the menu are 50% off.  This place is only worth it in my opinion if the food is discounted.We get the Bavarian pretzel, which comes buttery, salty and hot with a pickle, beer cheese, and mustard.  The mustard varies in heat each time we go, so just be careful if you can't handle it.  This is the one thing we suggest to people for their first time here.We also get the Kase-spaetzle, which is basically cheesy, fried noodles.  We aren't salad people but it comes with a cucumber salad which is delightfully vinegary and a regular salad.  I think it comes with sauerkraut too but I cannot remember.  It is tasty, like mac and cheese.  I still struggle with pronouncing it though.Oddly enough, and I know this is a crime, the pinot grigio here is light and refreshing, and a bit sweet but not overly so.  Would highly suggest if you like pinot grigio.  Very cheap when 50% off, and always served cold.You have to order from the grill for many items on the menu (the waitress will tell you so if you try to order certain things).  When I was eating pork, I got the Bratwurst with fries and sauerkraut. I like the fries a lot (freshly fried and crispy), and you can get barbecue sauce near the grill.  My boyfriend gets the Weisswurst, which is veal but kind of tastes weirdly chicken-y to me. He likes it though. I got the chicken sausage when I cut out pork, but it doesn't really taste like much and it's kind of tough.  It's too bad the turkey burger isn't 50% off.The dessert items are decent on Tuesdays, although not outstanding, they are worth it for 50% off.  We've tried all of them.Other items that are good are the schnitzel and the mussels.  The mussels are especially good if you get a side of fries to dunk in the broth, yum!",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

The issue is finding a seat or somewhere to sit. People were a bit rude and aggressive and tend not to want to share seats so every one could sit. We got a lot of food and it was delicious. The beer selection is pretty standard for a German Beer Garden but still good. Now... prob one of the weakest thing done well by this restaurant is their sausage line. The grills and cooks cook everything made to order. There was a long line and wait (20-25) for sausages. We all thought it didn't warrant them to wait for sausages to be made to order.

15,HRJInkK5AMatO-LompMCkw,Vinnie S.,4.0 star rating,"Coat check is no longer required on 1/2 price Tuesdays and Weekends!I have a prior review that wasn't favorable due to a required coat check. I came with a group of friends who have been coming every Tuesday for 4+ years. The required coat check and rubbed us all the wrong way. But with it no longer required, we are more then happy to return but we have a worry, which I'll mention later.From original:===I've been going to this place every week, for a little over a year. I meet with a group of friends who have been going here for 4+ years, every week. I go on Half-Priced Tuesdays, as that was when everyone else went.I would say it looks like a classic Biergarten. My German coworkers have told me it's like a modern Biergarten in Germany. It has long row tables that you just find space at and the waiter/waitress will come by to help. Pitcher of water is usually provided. The number of times we've been here, we're recognized on sight to the point that we don't even need to put a card down to open a tab.The group orders on the same tab, collects the cash, and pays all in cash at the end. Tuesdays say it's cash only, but you can still pay with card. Just not at the Grill in the back, which is always cash only. Note: on half-priced Tuesdays, if you order to-go, they'll charge full price.Grill Food: Burger, Frankfurter, Chicken, Kielbasa are all excellent. Some how I haven't tried any of the wursts before, but I was so content cycling between those options that I didn't see a need to try something else. They improved their fries about 4-5 months ago, from ""good"" to ""can we get more?""Non-Grill Food: Wiener Schnitzel is excellent and a sizable portion. Mussels are great too. I'd kill for their Brussels Sprouts: salty, sweet, spicy, all good. Popular table appetizer is the cucumber salad.===Service: So-so. Depends on who you get. If you get one of the good waiters/waitresses, they'll visit your table regularly, smile, and make you smile too. Otherwise, good luck getting their attention, getting your drinks in one order, and double check your bill... had one case where they charged us for another table's drinks (which weren't cheap) and after pointing this point, they went back and removed... our drinks. We didn't want to stay any longer, so we paid for the more expensive drinks and left.So per my original review, drink prices still went up, and beer quality has gone down. There was a security guard who recognized us on sight.Starting Jan 2018, they added a required coat check. It went for at least 4 weeks. My group didn't go the 4th week. There was a 2nd security guard who helped the first.""Week 5"" (Jan 2018): coat check is gone... along with the 2 security guards. For a bar, it was actually surprising: there was no security. As we were eating, we spotted what looked like a new, different from prior two, security guard who made a gesture towards the coat check... but people never approached it. The coat check is still there, no longer required. It wasn't staffed when we arrived.My worry: pre-Jan 2018, I said in the original review I would give this place 4 stars on a bad day, 5 on a good. I would have to say it's now 3 on bad, 4 on good. Reasoning is during the coat check debacle, we learned of new owners from multiple workers (their words, not sure if an actual new owner or just new manager) who worked in NYC clubs and was trying to turn this place into a NYC club, across the Hudson. I don't know if that's still the plan and the ""coat check cover charge"" was backtracked on, if they're changing plans on a whole, or if the whole plan was an idea that was mentioned. I have no reason not to distrust the workers, but it makes us question if ""we won the battle, but will loose the war"". Time will tell. Maybe then I'll update the review again. Until then, if then, we don't have to look for a replacement place and will be back next week as usual.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

The issue is finding a seat or somewhere to sit. People were a bit rude and aggressive and tend not to want to share seats so every one could sit. We got a lot of food and it was delicious. The beer selection is pretty standard for a German Beer Garden but still good. Now... prob one of the weakest thing done well by this restaurant is their sausage line. The grills and cooks cook everything made to order. There was a long line and wait (20-25) for sausages. We all thought it didn't warrant them to wait for sausages to be made to order.

35,HRJInkK5AMatO-LompMCkw,Vinnie S.,4.0 star rating,"Coat check is no longer required on 1/2 price Tuesdays and Weekends!I have a prior review that wasn't favorable due to a required coat check. I came with a group of friends who have been coming every Tuesday for 4+ years. The required coat check and rubbed us all the wrong way. But with it no longer required, we are more then happy to return but we have a worry, which I'll mention later.From original:===I've been going to this place every week, for a little over a year. I meet with a group of friends who have been going here for 4+ years, every week. I go on Half-Priced Tuesdays, as that was when everyone else went.I would say it looks like a classic Biergarten. My German coworkers have told me it's like a modern Biergarten in Germany. It has long row tables that you just find space at and the waiter/waitress will come by to help. Pitcher of water is usually provided. The number of times we've been here, we're recognized on sight to the point that we don't even need to put a card down to open a tab.The group orders on the same tab, collects the cash, and pays all in cash at the end. Tuesdays say it's cash only, but you can still pay with card. Just not at the Grill in the back, which is always cash only. Note: on half-priced Tuesdays, if you order to-go, they'll charge full price.Grill Food: Burger, Frankfurter, Chicken, Kielbasa are all excellent. Some how I haven't tried any of the wursts before, but I was so content cycling between those options that I didn't see a need to try something else. They improved their fries about 4-5 months ago, from ""good"" to ""can we get more?""Non-Grill Food: Wiener Schnitzel is excellent and a sizable portion. Mussels are great too. I'd kill for their Brussels Sprouts: salty, sweet, spicy, all good. Popular table appetizer is the cucumber salad.===Service: So-so. Depends on who you get. If you get one of the good waiters/waitresses, they'll visit your table regularly, smile, and make you smile too. Otherwise, good luck getting their attention, getting your drinks in one order, and double check your bill... had one case where they charged us for another table's drinks (which weren't cheap) and after pointing this point, they went back and removed... our drinks. We didn't want to stay any longer, so we paid for the more expensive drinks and left.So per my original review, drink prices still went up, and beer quality has gone down. There was a security guard who recognized us on sight.Starting Jan 2018, they added a required coat check. It went for at least 4 weeks. My group didn't go the 4th week. There was a 2nd security guard who helped the first.""Week 5"" (Jan 2018): coat check is gone... along with the 2 security guards. For a bar, it was actually surprising: there was no security. As we were eating, we spotted what looked like a new, different from prior two, security guard who made a gesture towards the coat check... but people never approached it. The coat check is still there, no longer required. It wasn't staffed when we arrived.My worry: pre-Jan 2018, I said in the original review I would give this place 4 stars on a bad day, 5 on a good. I would have to say it's now 3 on bad, 4 on good. Reasoning is during the coat check debacle, we learned of new owners from multiple workers (their words, not sure if an actual new owner or just new manager) who worked in NYC clubs and was trying to turn this place into a NYC club, across the Hudson. I don't know if that's still the plan and the ""coat check cover charge"" was backtracked on, if they're changing plans on a whole, or if the whole plan was an idea that was mentioned. I have no reason not to distrust the workers, but it makes us question if ""we won the battle, but will loose the war"". Time will tell. Maybe then I'll update the review again. Until then, if then, we don't have to look for a replacement place and will be back next week as usual.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

That being said, I can imagine that if you're a large group, it would probably be pretty hard to get seating. To start we ordered one of their giant pretzels. It comes with some mustard, and some type of (beer cheese?) dip. The pretzel was really soft and fresh, and I LOVED the beer cheese. If you can, save some of the beer cheese for your sausage. We ordered the jalapeño cheddar frankfurter, and the bratwurst. The frankfurter just tastes like a hot dog with cheese inside. I couldn't really taste the jalapeño. The bratwurst was great. I'd definitely order this one again. Each order comes with three links, sauerkraut, and fries and was enough for three people. Just make sure you have cash because for all of the sausages, and burgers, you will have to order yourself at the grill and they do not accept credit cards.I only got to try their Oktoberfest brew, but I really enjoyed it. I'll be sure to try some other beers next time.Tip - I read on Yelp that on Tuesdays, it's 50% off food and drinks. I kind of want to come back for that, but I'm also afraid of how crowded it will be.

The chew is amazing and the dips make it even tastier. Chicken wings were crispy with a tiny bit of kick and very tender. The bratwurst had great grilled flavor and the texture was a great blend of savory bite and soft filling. The sauerkraut was also a cut above the rest as you can taste the pickling seasoning of the sauerkraut but the cabbage still had that crisp bite to it; the quality proves it is made in-house!Service - 4/5. Professional and friendly. Our group came a bit earlier than their opening hours but the waiter was accommodating and courteous the entire time.Value - 5/5. On Mondays the menu is limited to the grill but on the plus side you get a free order of chicken wings with your beer.

Parking was not bad even on a Saturday early evening. There is 4 hour metered parking but only up til 9pm so getting there around 7pm I wound up only paying $1.50 for 2 hours. Unfortunately when we got there it started to rain lightly so we opted to go indoors instead of the partially umbrella covered tables in case it got worse. Indoors the place was pretty full and lively with music on and TVs playing sports.  We seated ourselves at one of the large communal tables and ordered a couple of beers and a pretzel to munch on before dinner. Pretzel was huge and came piping hot with a spicy brown mustard and a cheese spread. It was buttery and slightly crisp on the outside and fluffy inside. For dinner I ordered the Sauerbraten which was almost the single reason I came after seeing it on the show. My friend wanted to order the Polish kielbasa but was told he needed to go to the self service grill in the back and pay for it in cash. Somewhat inconvenient but not a big deal. My food arrived just before he got back with his, about 10-12 minutes and neither of us were disappointed. His was tasty, grilled with a nice snap on the casing and a side of crispy shoestring fries. The sauerbraten exceeded expectations. So many flavors and textures from a combination of the fall apart tender meat, the apple dumpling, red cabbage, mini mushrooms, crisp brussel sprouts and string beans. I managed to eat about half and still have enough left for another full meal. Overall great environment, good service and prices.

From the huge Bavarian pretzel, to the wiener schnitzel, sausages and other German fare... right to the burgers, fries, and even a dessert or two (the apple strudel is out of this world) you seriously cannot go wrong.  My only complaint is that it's a bit annoying that you can order certain things from the menu, but still have to go to the grill (cash only) if you want sausages or burgers.

The place is much more lively again since this has happened and my friends and I have resumed coming here. This is still my favorite bar in Hoboken. This used to be my favorite bar (I've come almost every week for the past  but the new management is trying to change that. Since the takeover they've instituted a mandatory coat and bag check. This would be fine if it was complimentary but they charge $2-$3 (depending on the night it seems) for the privilege. This might as well be a mandatory cover charge, especially in the winter. When a large portion of your clientele are poor college students an extra $2 can be a deciding factor in your choice of restaurant. I'm sure the sudden sharp decline in crowds on Tuesdays has something to do with this. Every staff member from the bouncer to our regular waitresses all agree this policy is ill conceived. They all insist it's the fault of this mysterious new manager. I'm told he's trying to turn Biergarten into a ""New York style club"" whatever that means. The bag check is especially annoying for someone like me who has to carry a bag of medications to deal with health issues. I tried explaining to the bouncer that I needed to hold onto my bag to keep my medications nearby but was told there would be no exceptions to the policy.

66,kNxtxnKhxPV7trd8DU66vQ,Stephanie D.,3.0 star rating,"It's hard to rate this place based on my experience(s) as I have different opinions on various elements, so I will rate in parts based on two visits:Food 2/5 - The pretzel is amazing, very soft and great for an appetizer. I was impressed when I saw the sauerbraten on Burgers, Brews, & Que on the Food Network, so I decided to try. The sauerbraten in my opinion, and I don't mean to be harsh, but it was awful. The texture was just right, as the beef shoulder was very tender and fell apart with my fork, but the taste was terrible. The beef has an overwhelming taste of maple syrup, and the pretzel dumplings lacked in flavor. The green beans were extremely soggy, and the braising liquid completely covered the plate, giving the other elements of the dish a maple syrup flavor as well. The wiener schnitzel also lacked in flavor, it tasted like dry chicken fingers. Overall, I wouldn't come back here for the food, only drinks as they have a very good beer selection. Drinks 5/5 - I loved the variety of beers and trying beers that I can't get anywhere else. The atmosphere is perfect for a German setting and is a great place to meet with friends. Service 5/5 - Both visits our waitresses were very friendly and very personable. I had no issues with them, and gave them good tips.Management 0/5 - TERRIBLE The restaurant was running a promotion for 50% of purchase of gift cards for one day only - so I went ahead and purchased. I asked the lady who was selling it to us if there were any restrictions on the use of the gift card (ex. can it be used any day of the week, can it be used on food and drinks, can it be used on happy hour). She said I can use it as a regular gift card and there were no restrictions, even on promotional days. I bought two sets of gift cards. The first gift card was used for the food explained above. The waitress mentioned that the gift card can only be used for house drinks and select beers, which we were never told. She spoke to her manager and made the exception and used the gift card for the check balance. Again, we asked her what restrictions there was for the gift card as we had another set and would use them for a second visit just for drinks. She said we can't use the gift card for anything that was half off. On our second visit, we came on a Tuesday coincidentally (50% everything with cash). Since our final check balance was more than the gift card and we didn't have cash anyway, we expected to use the gift card to pay the bill and the rest with credit card, totally fine with paying full price. Our server mentioned that the manager said the gift cards are not accepted on Tuesdays, and we asked to speak with him. We told him the entire story, but he was very rude and disrespectful, as he kept interrupting me when I spoke and raised his voice. I told him that there was no mention anywhere about gift cards not accepted on Tuesdays, he mentions that he can ""create restrictions whenever he wants,"" which is absolutely ridiculous and completely unprofessional. Although he did make the exception and accepted the gift card (after much debate) I did not like his attitude and do not appreciate his unprofessionalism. This place is a great place to drink and hang out with friends and try a variety of beers, but I definitely wouldn't recommend the food (except the pretzel) and hopefully no one has an issue with management.

67,Fvwz4JSLfwWJ2RqgyfuqOA,Bonnie M.,2.0 star rating,"I have to say while I like this place for its food, the customer service is not good.  Many times when we have eaten here, the service was rotating waiters and waitresses that don't follow up often, forget to bring something, etc.  For a place that should be kid friendly as it's loud, they have not been on many occasions. The most recent example is we asked to be seated in their outdoor heated igloos. Kids and parents all thought it would be super fun. They directed us to sit inside because 3 out of 4 were reserved and they were really meant for larger parties (we were a party of 4). After an hour and a half at dinner when we left we went outside and all 4 igloos were not used and in fact no one was even in the outdoor space! My kids (age 11 and 13) were super disappointed as were we.  In addition, upon entering the establishment a super rude bouncer or host (not sure what he was other than rude), insisted we had to check our coats for $3 A coat! Looking at everyone else dining with their coats on or having them on their seats, we ignored the request.  Really disappointed in the service and this is not a first time.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"
68,D8F3CRHFU4UGVV1y9xLhGQ,Ed J.,4.0 star rating,"This great neighborhood place was just around the corner from where my wife and I were staying while we visited our daughter in Hoboken.  We ended-up visiting twice during the week for dinner, so let that speak for itself.My only criticism is that the grille portion of the restaurant is run like a pop-up and seems to be completely unrelated to the general restaurant.  The first time we visited the Pilsener Haus on a Wednesday evening, we ordered from the grille and the 2 guys cooking were great! We returned on a Saturday evening and the lady cooking on the grille was (let's just say) less than great.  So the grille results and overall service vary widely with whomever is cooking that evening.The general serving staff and kitchen at the Pilsener Haus are quick, consistent and reliable.  No issues with that whatsoever.The grille requires pre-payment in cash and is operated ""counter-service"" style, but the general menu items from the Pilsener Haus and their beers & wines can be paid for at the conclusion of your meal with a credit card.  The grille/kitchen schizophrenia is a bit odd for first-timers.All-in-all, I'll return for sure.  I'll even order from the grille again, I just hope Dr. Jekyll is cooking and not Mr. (Ms.) Hyde!Give it a try, I think you'll like it.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

However, even if you're not keen on beer, which I'm not, there's definitely something for everyone. From the food variety to the two levels of music and dancing, you will definitely have a good time here.The bottom level has many wooden tables and is mostly for sitting down, eating, drinking. The upstairs has more of a club environment so if that's more your thing you can head up there. Aside from beer, they have a full bar so you can pretty much get any drink that you can get anywhere else. I recently tried one of their seasonal offerings which was hot apple cider with rum which was pretty good.I've only been here at night but I would imagine it's a good place to come for lunch and dinner if you're so inclined.

One outside which is the obvious prime spot but the tables outside can only hold around 10 people if you have more you need to go inside. Once you're inside there is a smaller room with a few large tables. If you keep walking further there is the large beer hall with the large wooden tables and benches and a bar across one of the walls. On another wall is grill cooking wursts and other delicious food.  The room has a very industrial feel to and can hold large groups. We had a group of about 20 people and all fit and watch the rangers games since they have a few tvs. At the tables there is wait service for food and drinks. I got a liter of beer from the recommendation of the server and it was perfect. In addition to the beers you gotta get a pretzel since you're at a Biergarten and it was made to perfection. A soft pretzel with a buttery glaze and the most delicious Bavarian mustard. I could not have asked for anything better.In short:-Great for groups-Friendly Fast wait service-Delicious beer and pretzels,Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

Of course not. It's Hoboken. It's the land of ""Bro's and Brittney's"" and you'll never find a time that this place isnt filled with those types.But interspersed with that is a nice little diverse mix of people who make this place steer far away from the annoying scenes you might find in no-longer-hidden gems in Manhattan or queens. People just looking to have a non-pretentious good time, have some drinks and some good bar food to go along with it.HIGHLY recommend getting that bavarian pretzel. Super soft and delicious and great to split with someone. Bratwursts and Kielbasa are solid and come with a heaping portion of freshly cooked fries. Lots of seating (huge tables with benches), and an outdoor area too. This place gets PACKED, but never too packed that you wont enjoy yourself.If you want to have those Brats and stuff, make sure you come with cash (although there are ATM's near the restrooms).

When I arrived, this was a typical beer hall, cool ambience with many long tables, a grill area and bar. I decided to go for the grill because I wanted to try the Bratwurst. It was freshly prepared right there and was ready within 10 mins. Brats come with a side of fries, bread or cucumber salad and sauerkraut. Overall, pretty satisfied with the food so far and I may go back to try something else.Now, to get to the negatives. I got some cash out because I drove 40 mins to come here and would have been really mad had I not been able to get anything. So, like any restaurant, they accept credit cards, BUT:1) There's a minimum charge for a credit card...absurd2) All the grill items i.e. Brats, Kielbasa, etc is CASH ONLY. The staff even made a point to comment on the sign amongst themselves while I was standing there.This is a big restaurant, so both of these are ridiculous. CC fees aren't that high so don't pass them on to the customer and the fact that half the menu is CASH ONLY and the rest is not is just plain stupid and highly inconvenient. I hate establishments that offer flexible payment options or have ambiguities surrounding them.As far as promotions, the website advertises daily specials although seems the staff makes no mention of them. I ordered brats which come with basically a complimentary beer. Having known this, I mentioned it to the bar tender and he got it for me. At the grill, no one said anything about a combo deal. That's bad marketing and training of staff, but they know to make sure the cash only sign is highly visible. Their loss, cause now I got a free beer for saying something.Pretty good first experience, but the owner should look into addressing the negatives. Cash only is a pain in the ass and frankly pathetic for a large restaurant that can make good margins of food and alcohol sales.

Apparently our server went home sick, but I don't understand how it takes that long to just close out a whole table and just start a new tab. On the good side the manager came over and made up for it so I'm not deducting any stars for it, because I felt like she did deal with it in a professional manner. Also as a pro-tip, you apparently get a free pitcher if it's your actual birthday so great place to stop in.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

After coming here a few times, I thought I would stop ordering it but that day will never come.This beer palace is huge. Huge tables, huge grill, huge TVs. Definitely good for groups of 20 or 30 people.For 2 weeks they have a few special dishes. We tried the smoked and grilled pork ribs. Delish. The meat had this perfect crisp on the outside and tender pork meat right underneath that. Easy to eat as it falls off the bone as you press on it with your fork. Accompanied with a good portion of jicama slaw top with a bit of fresh cilantro and red onions. It tasted as good as the ones served at authentic Mexican restaurants. We had to add a giant pretzel to our meal. It's a decision you won't regret. Yank a piece and dip it into butter or nordic mustard. You can't go wrong either way.  Just a quick negative note I had the half chicken dish last time I was here. It was bland and way too many french fries. Nothing great. Otherwise 5 stars.

I've tried almost everything on the menu, you can't really go wrong with anything, and the grill is delicious as well. I keep saying I'm gonna try some if the specials, but never quite get around to it (mostly as I like to come on half-price Tuesdays - the best kept secret in Hoboken!). On top of all this, how much fun is a full liter stein of German brew? You can't beat that!So why not a full 5 stars? Well, as others have said, it can be a bit of a hassle to scout out a seat for your crew, then swoop in and grab it before someone else does.

I almost always get the mussels, and at the end I let the fries that come with the sausage sit in that mussel sauce until they're nice and soggy- then DEVOUR! Their Steigl is my favorite beer... its flavorful and right in the middle- not heavy, but certainly not as light as some of their other options. And tastier than the Pilsner in my opinion.I'm not a huge fan of the separate grill and regular menu thing-- you have to order sausages at the grill and regular menu gets table service although everything can be eaten at a table-- I guess this is some sort of traditional beirgarten type thing??? I really don't know. I wish I could just order the grill at the table with everything else. Whatever.Undeniable value on Tuesdays- everything is half off when paid in cash!BUT you gotta come either EARLY or LATE...Between 7:30-9 and you're gonna be stuck hovering around a table waiting for them to leave.  The turnover is quick enough, but it can be annoying.

116,vSrUp_0FMyG_WHEPPzOVvQ,Charlotte J.,3.0 star rating,"This place gets most of its stars based on atmosphere alone. It is SUCH a fun place to hang out! Of course that means it's always crowded. Its outdoor seating area, a cobblestone patio filled with communal tables, is like one giant party. And inside there is often live music (a klezmer band when we were there!). It's a free-for-all to get a seat (the waitress actually said: ""if you see a place to sit, go for it"") but once we got a table the service was great. The on-tap beer selection is quite extensive, as is only right, considering they are a biergarten. I ordered the Schofferhofer Grapefruit, which honestly was more like orange soda than beer, frothy and sweet. You can order in half-liters or full-liters, and for a light weight like me a half-liter was plenty. The food was just okay. We ordered a pretzel for the table, and it came with a dipping cheese and a dipping mustard. Better than the pretzels sold on the streets of Manhattan, but not mind-blowing. My fish & chips were oddly sparse, way more fries than fish. My boyfriend found his turkey sandwich to be just okay, ordinary, nothing interesting. The best item we ordered was probably the warm broccolini salad.

Pilsener is actually pretty manageable, although to be fair, I was here on a Sunday afternoon...not exactly prime time from a noisiness standpoint. Nonetheless, it's got a nice brick structure to it that has a good amount of airiness and height at the section next to the outdoor seating, along with a wall-high television projection. The servers circulated often, making sure that we had pitchers at the ready, as well as any food. The beer here is actually quite solid - I do like the focus on lesser-known Central European beers, with the German IPA (a nice reddish hue and a full body) and the Oktoberfest lagers standing out in particular. As for the food, it's adequate filler, at least based on the chicken fingers (not the kind of crunchy fried goodness I prefer on the outside) and fries (good, but nothing mind-blowing).That said, the reasonableness of the prices, the nice space, and above-average beers is enough to score this spot a 4.

The beer selection is definitely on point. The main focus is a variety of German drafts, some with long, hard to pronounce names, but all with detailed descriptions that help you make an educated choice. I'm a huge fan of any witbier, so I tend to gravitate in that direction.For food, I go to the grill 90% of the time. There are a lot of good app choices (mussels and the german pretzel are favorites) but the grill always lures me away from the menu before I can order anything - because all food is better when grilled.I tend to gravitate towards the chicken sausage, with mustard for dipping. It comes with a metric ton of fries and a giant scoop of kraut, so the meal is definitely filling. If i'm not in a sausage mood, I go for the turkey burger, which is always a solid alternative.Pretty much anything off the menu is a great choice, but i'm here for the grill and the beer.We like to try and come on Tuesdays since it's half off when you pay cash - so our dinner for two this past Tuesday was a whopping $25.The weekends, as you would expect, are their busiest times...so it may be harder to find a seat. However, if it is cold, or snowing, or really hot, or some other weather condition that would prevent you from wanting to venture out, know their ""out of the way"" location makes it pretty easy to find parking, either on 15th or on Clinton/Grand/Adams/Jefferson, a noteworthy distinction for a restaurant in Hoboken.

But Pilsener seems to be the go-to place for my friends to host birthday and farewell dinners, and so I've been here on more than one occasion. If you like noisy, lively places and don't mind scrambling for seats, you'll probably have a good time at Pilsener. Wide selection of beer, a combination of get-it-yourself and order-from-the-kitchen dishes, and some decent desserts. Pilsener also has two party rooms (one on ground level, another called the ""Speakeasy"" on another level) that can be rented as well.For someone with low tolerance for chaos (such as myself), you may find the experience of trying to find a place to sit and order food to be overwhelming. The service was lackluster as it seemed they did not have enough wait staff to adequately cover each area. I saw my table's waitress once and never again. I wanted to order the huge pretzel, but after waiting an hour for someone - anyone - from the wait staff to return, decided that I didn't want it after all. It seems I needed to be way more aggressive in order to order anything from the kitchen menu. Parking unsurprisingly is a PITA during prime dinner and drinking hours even though Pilsener is in the middle of no-man's land between Hoboken and Weehawken. Probably the main reason that I dread going to Pilsener at 9 pm on the weekend.If you're a fan of German pubs, yeah, you'll love this place. I don't mind going here but for my introverted self it's not my first choice by far.For those on a mobile device, note that the check-in offer is only valid during a very specific time range on weekdays - the fine print doesn't show up until after you've checked in and pulled up the offer.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

The food menu has a nice list of German specialties without the pig knuckle :(, but for you yanks, a better portion with lots of familiar and ""safe"" dishes. Portions look large.

I have been on all kinds of nights and days and sometimes you get amazing service, sometimes you get so-so service it really depends on the day and how nice it is outside.The place is huge obviously and the beer is delicious, doesn't seem to rotate a whole lot, but enough to keep it fairly fresh. I usually wind up getting Hofbrau Dunkel anyway. The food is pretty good, the pretzels are a home run, the Sauerbraten is amazing but a bit pricey. I do like their sausages and what not, but the recent change to make that cash only is really kind of a pain in the ass. It used to take cards. You take cards everywhere else, but that one little stand requires cash and it requires me to order separately from the tab I already have open. While it's a minor annoyance, the wait time when it's busy can be  horrendous so I could be spending money drinking beer, but instead I am standing waiting for meat.  I just think it's a bad practice and even a bit sketchy. There are some great bartenders here though, Andrew, Rhodie, etc. all good guys and very good bartenders. The place does get overrun on nice days by the bro and woo girl crowd, that's to be expected. It can be annoying but enough Liter beers and you can tune them out. Also during the day you have parenting fails all around you. Last time we were there some parents, drinking, weren't watching their kid. She kept coming to our table, and handing us iPads, iPods, etc. They had no idea she was gone talking to us, she was probably about 7. Eventually we grabbed the dad when he went to pee and said ""hey you're kid is giving us all this stuff and talking to strangers"". This is pretty standard, parents getting schwasted and not watching their kids. As a mandated reporter my head wants to explode here on the weekend days. Overall it's ok, not amazing. But, a nice place to visit. I remember when they first opened they said they wouldn't have TVs, that changed quickly now they have major projector screens everywhere, which is fine.

Lots of fun, live music, crowded (but room to move).In general, I love coming to this place to grab a few drinks with friends. As many people have shared, the names of the beers are long and German, so don't ask me to pronounce them, but I'm usually not disappointed. The food is great too...biggest pretzels I've ever seen in my life ($11.00 worth of pretzel), along with staple german entrees. This is more of a social hangout type of place, where people come to chat, drink, and relax. It can get loud at night, but it's still always fun.

You sure showed me, Jersey!A friend recommended dinner and drinks here, and I went along for the ride. Even though he told me online reviews said the food was ""surprisingly good,"" I was skeptical (when have I ever had above average bar food in the City before?).I envisioned this place like Houston Beer hall, loud and cramped, with average or maybe above average beer selection. It's calm and composed inside, with most of the crowd on an early Friday night being well-dressed 30 somethings. The DJ gave us a refreshing array of tunes-- no top 40s here, just some classic rock mixed with eclectic modern. It's also very spacious and well decorated here, with enough old world charm to transport you away and yet with enough TVs playing sports to keep you grounded in reality. Now let's talk about the food.Holy hell that was good food. Granted I did work out an appetite walking into the Scooby Doo ghost town section of Hoboken, but I was well rewarded.My friend and I decided to split two entrees. A few quick minutes later, the staff arrived with our selections: the pork snitzel and the braised beef shoulder.To call the entrees restaurant quality is an understatement. This place could be a thriving German restaurant. Our food was fresh and warm, and the portions were huge! We could have easily split just one entree. They were roughly about $15 each, making them reasonably priced too. The snitzel was juicy and very crispy, and came with a berry sauce, thinly sliced cucumber salad, and German potato salad. Meanwhile, the beef shoulder came over red wine cabbage and pretzel dumplings, and was topped with pearl onions and bacon. They hit the spot on a cold day, and I'd go out of my way in Hoboken to have that snitzel again. The snitzel is a textbook example of the deep-fried meat done right. It takes an attentive chef to assembly a meal as good as this with so many moving parts. Not surprisingly, the beer selection was also outstanding. Our waitress (who was very attentive and periodically checked up on us) even offered a sample to help us decide on a selection. Good descriptions are always a must, and the beer menu here adequately describes them all.

The 4 different rooms seem to suit an array of customers. You can chill outside on the patio (where you can only get food from the grill) or hang in any of the other 3 rooms. The main room, where there is a bar and the grill, often has live entertainment which is fun. We ordered the kielbasa and bratwurst from the grill. Everything from this part of the menu is made to order, so its hot, crunch and crispy where appropriate. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the bratwurst. Very, very flavorful and fresh. The kielbasa was also good, but they all generally taste the same. I wish the platters came with another link or two of each meat, more sauerkraut and a little less fries.

188,FQh44MrbHRUUQm92MenTRQ,Matt E.,4.0 star rating,"4.5 stars if you go on a Tuesday when the majority of the beer and food is 50% off if you pay cash. If you're not going on a Tuesday then you'll find as though everything is $1-2 too expensive, right down to the $3 ATM fee and $12 soft pretzel. In their defense it's a giant pretzel equal to 2 regular large soft pretzels. Almost all Beers are on tap are craft German beers, with a couple exceptions taps are $7 for a pint (1/2 liter), and $13 for a full liter (about 33 oz). So coming here on a Tuesday and getting some of these delicious beers for $3.50/ea is one of the best deals in town. Don't worry if you've never heard of any of the beers as their menu offers great descriptions of each. Their food comes from either a side grill where they're making sausages and burgers (mostly around $10), both with fries, or from a full kitchen making some more complex full meals, snacks, and desserts. I just ordered a bratwurst from the grill. For $10 ($5 on Tuesday) I got two bratwursts and fries. I was hoping for buns and wasn't expecting fries but I was happy with the plate. It wasn't the best I've ever had but wasn't bad either. I left the biggest highlight for last, the space. They have two giant beer halls with long communal tables and a decent sized outdoor space with the same long picnic style tables with umbrellas. The outside seemed to be waitress service but it didn't seem to be a problem to go inside and get your own stuff as well. Service was friendly, especially from the bartender.

Great (imported) beer, great food, and a great spot to actually sit down and hang with your friends. If you're looking to avoid the more bro-y bars in Hoboken, then you've come to the right spot. Always a good spot on the weekends, but Tuesday night is the best time to go. Most of the menu is half off on Tuesday if you bring cash, which is hard to beat. If you order food: DEFINITELY GET THE PRETZEL! The mustard is great, but the cheese sauce is divine. You won't be sorry.The only complaint I have is that service could be a little bit better. Generally a lot of people come on Tuesday nights, so things can get packed very easily. It's not uncommon to have to wait a little extra for your server to get there, since they're taking care of so many people.

The detailed descriptions however really does help in the decision making process. The Bavarian Soft Pretzel is a must if you come here ... It was soooo good! Had also ordered the Wiener Schnitzel which comes in huge portion and was delicious. Did I mention 50% off the bill on Tuesdays if you pay with cash. What more can you ask for? Worth the trek, definitely one of my favorite place in Hoboken so far.Update: 10/4/14Came back last night for the Oktoberfest.  There was live music, stein holding competition, pretty ladies walking around giving out boot mugs.

The most recent time I went there, we came on a Saturday at 7:30ish, thinking that it wouldn't be packed yet and we could easily get seats. We were very wrong - the entire place was already really crowded, which goes to show that you've got a great establishment. We got seats at the bar quickly, thanks to excellent timing, and began ordering our half liters (which was more than enough to get all of us pretty tipsy - 3 for me left me feeling very good, 4 for the guys got them on a drunk level). I can't even remember or pronounce any of the beers I had - I know I had the one that's described as a chocolate Guinness (which it was not, but it was still good - I think I disliked it a little because I really was picturing a chocolate flavored Guinness, which is a hard act to follow, but it WAS still good). The boys ordered the Spaten beer (which was delish, and maybe the best of the night) and a handful of others. Good pricing on beers too - $7 for the half liter, which is definitely reasonable and kind of a steal. We also each got a pretzel, which was overkill because we could have easily split. The pretzels are massive and are SO delicious. Definitely worth ordering. Later on in the night, after the guys were pretty drunk, we also ordered fries, which were equally good (though drinking + fries are a winning combination to begin with). The service was also fantastic - there were only 2 or 3 guys working behind the bar, but they were on their game, serving drinks left and right, refilling waters (and dropping you a water if you had ordered a few beers already), and not letting beer glasses get empty before they were over asking what we were having next. It really would have been easy for them to use the fact that the place was packed to give shitty service, but they were phenomenal and really attentive. I go here with friends pretty often and it's a great time no matter what.

They have a large wrap around bar at the entrance, a fireplace and doors leading to a patio for the spring and summer months.

The converted warehouse has super high ceilings and giant frosted windows that let in the light but keeps the drinking private which makes the joint feel like a great big man cave - but of course the ladies are more than welcome.The biggest draw is the atmosphere.

People are uber friendly and you can easily make a friend as they have bench seating typical of any beer garden. I was there last night for the first night of Oktoberfest. And let me tell ya, it was a great big ol' party! They had live music and a special selection of beer on tap (not to mention their already extensive regular selection of draft and bottled beers). People were dancing all over the joint, even on my table! I couldn't even make it to the bathroom without somehow getting sucked into a twirl with a pair of random strangers!The food is quite good as well. We already had dinner beforehand but my buddies ordered sausages with fries which I munched on happily with my beer.

This place has captured that dark rustic ambiance with both a really great indoor and outdoor space. Long communal wood tables that makes drinking even more social, makes this a Hoboken hot spot.The beer is always solid and they even have a reasonable and decent wine list. I most recently nibbled on some food at a private event and I was definitely satisfied. The pretzel with dipping sauces was delicious, although it seemed to be drenched in butter. I'm not complaining or anything, but this pretzel by no means was a healthy one. The sausage platter with fries was large and in charge with a nice variety of pork sausages and crispy thin fires.This is definitely a great space for those looking to tie one on with a group anytime of the year.

232,YvarKG_QVsuiSyXaonjEZQ,Leah M.,4.0 star rating,"I practically lived here every weekend when we lived in Hoboken.  It is always packed and it is for a good reason.  Amazing liters of German and other European beers.  The only place I know that sells pear cider, and delicious food to boot (pun intended).  The only thing I have been disgruntled with every time I have returned is the grill.  When it first opened the grill moved quickly and efficiently (as it should, everything is already partially cooked)  Every time for the past 1 1/2 years I have visited the grill it has taken around 30 minutes to receive a sausage and fries.  For a while the person running the grill seemed to have never worked in food service before.  She often had to check the receipt the customers received and would often forget about the orders instead of looking at her copies.  Lately the grill staff has seemed to change but it still hasn't been as speedy as it was when it first opened.  The sausage is good and it kills when you see it cooked and ready to go in front of you and you have to beg the staff to complete the order. AHH!Love the Kolo Club too.  Still love going here when I visit Hobo.P.S. Get the Radler, it's delicious.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

And I lived in Astoria for a while (which is known for its beer gardens). I'd much rather go here than the ones in Astoria.1) Food is excellent. You can order from the grill or from the waitress (and yes, they are all female, fairly attractive ones; I've never seen a male waiter there). I usually order from the grill since I'm a huge kielbasa/bratwurst fan. It comes with a good portion of sauerkraut and fries.2) Beer selection is excellent. They have a very good rotation of local beers on draft along with all the popular German beers on draft. You can also get a bunch of others in bottle.3) You can come here with your kids. I actually don't think I'd enjoy coming here if I was childless because more often than not, this place is overrun with kids. Okay, I'm exaggerating a bit there and that's usually only on weekends before 7pm or so. You can avoid the kids if you come later. But I have kids so I love it. There aren't a lot of places to go in Hoboken where you can 1) drink beer and 2) bring the kids and not feel weird about it.I think this is my new favorite place to eat/drink in the whole NYC area.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

If you want somewhere to go where you can catch up with friends while drinking some good tasting beer then definitely come here. The Biergarten is located in upper Hoboken so it's a little far off from the usual go-to bars by Washington St. but still, it totally makes up for it with the cool atmosphere inside. There are three different spaces which include one outdoor seating area and two indoor. They offer a good selection of music which include anything from throwbacks to present hits.

239,JaesTErPaXXRRC0kqodDjA,May C.,4.0 star rating,"Awesome place! It's a little gem in upper Hoboken. There's no transportation near this place so you have to Uber or take a cab to get there (or drive, but it's Hoboken, you shouldn't drive). The place has nice outdoor seating with a DJ and a large indoor venue as well. There wasn't any space outdoors and there wasn't a bar outside so we went in. It was a bit crowded but no overbearing. The bar was insanely packed though. It was so hard to get a drink. I was waving my card around like a mad man, my usual MO to get a drink. it generally works, but these guys were too methodical. They took orders starting from left side of the bar and then worked there way to the other end. I'm pretty positive even if you flash them, they wouldn't break their code. Seating was mostly long wooden benches, not tables, which I was ok with. The setting was dim but really nice. They played awesome music, throwback to the 90's, but there was no dance floor sadly. The age group of thru place seemed mostly like people in their late 20's, which I'm not yet a part of.Beer is amazing here (obviously). Some of my favorites are Brooklyn Summer Ale, Pilsner Haus, Blanche, and the Doc's Draft of Hard Cider. Very weird though, the prices on the board say $5, but they actually charged me $7. Not sure if it gets more expensive at night, or if I accidentally ordered the larger size. Doesn't seem like it though, because I asked for a small. My glass was tall and thin, but I saw bigger glasses out there, so I don't think I ordered the larger size. I'll need to ask next time I'm there and it's not ridiculously crowded.Overall, great atmosphere and awesome place to grab some delicious beer and catch up with friends.

My boyfriend has to follow a gluten free diet which might prove challenging at most beer places, but they had one of his favorite gluten free beers on the menu! They also note gluten free items on their menu which is always helpful. For our late dinner, we both ordered the Calamari and Sausage dish which was really delicious and perfectly spiced. We also shared an order of the Bier Mussels. These were some of the more flavorful mussels I have had - so often I think mussels get dried out in the cooking process and don't absorb any of the usually delicious broths they are served in. That wasn't the case with these! To be noted, we did get a handful of ""crunchy"" mussels in this dish which is a little off putting butI don't hold this against the establishment. The atmosphere of the biergarten is really relaxing and romantic even. It was a perfect place for just the two of us to hang, but there were also several large groups enjoying several rounds of beers surrounding us, so it serves as a social spot as well!  I am not giving them 5 stars yet (we will be back!) for one small reason - when we arrived it wasn't totally clear if we could just sit anywhere and how to place our order. There was an awesome duo playing in the Biergarten and we chose to sit at one of the large community tables. It wasn't until we stopped a staff member to ask how we could order that someone was finally sent to our table. This wasn't a huge deal because we were enjoying just relaxing and enjoying the music, but we were hungry!

Once you walk in there is an outdoor seating area to the right which is great during the warmer months but it is not very large. The indoor area houses two very large rooms, the one on the right once you enter has a bunch of long communal style tables and a few TV screens, definitely a nice area for events. The main room is very spacious, it has a large TV screen and in front of it a small stage which sometimes has music performances, across from that there are a bunch of those same communal tables with a grill behind them. To the left of that is the main bar.The bartenders are dressed in a uniform that I can only assume reflects traditional garb in Austro-Hungarian Biergartens. They are friendly, fast and helpful.The bier list is fantastic, some are more well known than others but none of them are very ""mainstream"". There is a description for every beer which makes it easier to decide, but the bartenders can always assist with that.There is a waiter service at the communal tables for both bier and food. The service isn't perfect but it is good considering the amount of patrons and the size of the place. You could also sit at the communal tables and get the bier from the bar itself. The food menu seems to reflect the same Austro-Hungarian roots but I usually order from the grill. In my opinion the burgers from the grill are consistently the best I have had in Hoboken. That might not say much but it is also one of my favorite burgers in general, the fries aren't bad either. I have also had their brussel sprouts and the palatschinken and they were both decent but nothing to write home about. The only thing that could make this place better is if the outdoor area was larger, but other than that it is pretty much close to perfect.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

I've caught a couple of live bands here and there which is cool and all, but it can be deafening loud depending on where you are seated to the point that you are yelling at your friends to make any kind of communication. There's a decent sized outside seating area with heat lamps to warm you up on cooler nights. There are servers that come to your table to take your order and are knowledgeable about the beers.

It was a bit crowded in the main room, but luckily our table was reserved in the smaller side room.One of the best experiences of the night was the impeccable service we received.

Came out on a Wednesday because my friend heard it was ""all-you-can-eat-mussels night"" for $10/person. However, the same said friend also has an enormous appetite so I knew the ""mussels deal"" was pretty much just a pretty face to lure us into an  endless vortex of sausage and beer and glorious gluttony. (additional $$$) ""It will be fun if we each pay $10 for a piece of sausage,"" neither of us remember saying while waiting for our bratwurst and frankfurters. The sausage did come with plenty of fries and sauerkraut, so it rounded out our meals well.I liked that there were a lot of german draft beer options, and the long communal tables did make me imagine that we were temporarily in Europe. Here's a crash back to reality though: this is still Hoboken so if you're looking for ""authentic German food at 'traditional' prices,"" you're going to have to slap yourself because that's not really the real lure of this place. The lure is, if you come with some friends, you can definitely have a fun night spent drinking and enjoying good company together. Don't come here craving schnitzel and goulash though and be shell-shocked when it's $17/entree. (because why? because...drunk? because Hoboken? *shrug*)Still, I think this is a solid meeting place to hang with friends or just change up the scene once in a while so I'm glad there's a place like this in Hoboken.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

Our server was a lovely lady whose name I cannot remember. She was very knowledgeable and helpful. I was a little hesitant about this place since I am German so I grew up eating this kind of food. Their overall menu can be ordered from the server, and one time I chose their spaetzle. Sadly, I was not a big fan of it. It was too creamy and way too heavy, as well as bland so I couldn't finish it. They also have, confusingly enough, a different setup if you want to get sausages so you can't order that through your server, and that stand only takes cash. BUT - those sausages are fantastic. Their frankfurters are my favorite and their fries are also superyummy. Try their pretzel too - it comes all piping hot and steamy and it's just heavenly with a nice 1 liter Kolsch on the side!

They had a traditional band playing, loud and cheerful people meeting new people, and a very festival/fair atmosphere, for a lack of better terms.This biergarten is more or less the opposite; going with the dimly lit industrial theme.  (Not saying this is necessarily bad; just different.).  Tables lit by candles.  Staff are all wearing black.  Grill at the back is spewing flame and sausage.  In a side room they have big screen TVs with sports.  I guess they are going for the everything theme.  ""Romantic"" place to eat?  Sorta.  Place to watch sports?  Sorta.  Place to grab beers and food and just chat?  Mostly.I'm betting I would like this place much better on a warm summer afternoon in the outdoor seating, but until then, take this place for what it is.Side note:  Their Sauerkraut has little to no flavor at all.  It kind of just has a soggy texture.  They get plus points have great mustards; I wish they had some mayo that I could enjoy with the fries, a la European style.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

What I love about this place is that the vibe is really chilled out. There is no pretension that the usual NYC bar has, and the crowds here have ranged from parents with small babies, visiting tourists, locals, and a girls night out. The beer is varied, cold and fresh, and the food is tasty. They have the best goddamn hot pretzel I have ever tasted in my life, and I would also recommend trying the brussel sprouts (surprising I know but they are DELICIOUS), potato pancakes and the goulash.

Hum the menu says six, flag her down and question her and she replies that's correct so we point out the menu and now the story changes to you came after 8pm. and we have live music so the tip stands, I cry foul and point out to her that we arrived shortly after 7pm. and refuse to pay the 18% (check was time stamped 7:15pm.) in a angry manner she capitulates and removes the tip returns and slaps the check down on the table.

You MUST get the pretzel, no actually get two and extra beer cheese. I also love the mussels, they are amazing.

It has been one of my favorites of all time. Any time someone visits, I always make it a point to stop there. Recently, their allowance of children has gotten out of control. Today, the entire inside was taken over with FIRST birthday parties...as in first birthdays for kids. Virtually every table inside was taken over or reserved. It has gotten to the point where people are hanging pink banners, stringing streamers, balloons, etc. as if it wasn't designed as an industrial style beer hall. And as if there weren't others around. Kids run around this place like little maniacs. There's always been kids there, and for the most part it wasn't out of control. Now it has become known as a daycare with beer. People let their kids run around because that's what all the other parents allow. Screaming, yelling, climbing on the benches. Nuts. Now that the weather is getting nicer, more and more parents are going there. A beer garden / beer hall is a place for adults. Period. Being family friendly is one thing. But now they might as well hang a Chucky Cheese sign our front on the weekends. They seriously need to set limits. Maybe just the Winter Garten or one or two tables in the main hall. Or cut it off at 2pm. Otherwise, I would recommend avoiding this place (as much as it pains me to say) until after dark when the kids go to bed.

We arrived at 1:30pm on a Saturday, and the group expanded to about 16 people by the time I left at 4:30pm. The beer selection is really good, and I appreciated the description on the laminated menu. The food menu is also interesting, though I recommend just going straight to the back for the grilled food. This spot definitely has a family vibe going on, but I certainly prefer that to douche bag vibe that I feel in other beer gardens, honestly.

The beer selection is EXTENSIVE (as to be expected), but what surprised me is how yummy the food selection is. They have a traditional menu of German fare- I recommend the Pork Chop or the Wiener Schnitzel, and OF COURSE, the Bavarian Pretzel with pub cheese: yum! But they also have a walk-up ""grill"" where you can order things like Bratwurst & Saurkraut, or even a burger.I really love the open table layout and the cool abandoned warehouse feel. They even have a projection screen for the sports fans out there. I think Friday nights they have music; one DJ specialized in early 90's hits which really gets me going!The one downside to this place is that it is often overrun with children. No, not annoying 22 year olds who act like children, ACTUAL children. Like...families celebrating birthday parties and christenings and things.

Maybe they were having an off day because there's so many good reviews but I experienced otherwise. I'm pretty easy going and patient with things but this day definitely wasn't a 4 or 5 star day. I can understand why it can have good reviews based on just looking at the place, its location and its atmosphere. The service and practicality of the grill area needs tweaking. Our waitress was not informative and could have been more helpful and maybe it all started there. Know there is a grill. It is a great addition to the small brunch menu we were given, although we were not made aware of the grill at all. If you're sitting outside you'll have no clue. I asked if there was anything more than the brunch menu she said no that was it. Then I find out from another customer there's a grill so after just placing my order off the brunch menu I ask the waitress if there's a grill in the back and only then she tells me there is one. She got upset that I canceled my order but If you told me earlier and gave me options when I asked I wouldn't have done that!Now the grill. Make sense of it and put the menu in the right place, which is next to the register! As I'm waiting for my food 5 people looked at the menu, which is on the pick up side, and stood behind me thinking it was the line to order and I had to tell them it was the other side. Next waiting for my food was the worst part of the whole process. The Zeppelin beer hall in Jersey City gives you a buzzer so you don't stand at the grill for literally 20-25 mins. There's 8 of us staring at the grill and waiting. Crowding around it In a small tight area isn't cool. Now they should  add a 3rd person behind the grill. The same person at the register was also the same person cooking and then walking away to get more ingredients from the back. Only one other person is cooking. So now the line to order is long. You either work the register or you cook, not both and not on a busy weekend afternoon. After standing around forever you just lose all enthusiasm for being there.Work it out and I'll come back. For now I'll stick with Zeppelin beer hall.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

337,_lPE6k5G9hsN7SgwNSc3VA,Chris L.,5.0 star rating,"Loved the beer, liked the grilled sausages, absolutely devoured the food from the kitchen and was always treated well by waitstaff so this place is a new favorite for me!  I've visited three times now.  If you want to eat well here, avoid Mondays because only the sausage grill is open that day, no full kitchen. This is a very large German bar/restaurant with a medium-size patio.  The interior space is the first floor of an old industrial building, complete with concrete floors, brick walls, enormous wood posts and beams and huge windows so it doesn't  feel like a cave.  The exterior space is a patio, and forgive me but a patio is not a ""beer garden"".  A garden has trees, grass, possibly even flowers.  But to be sure, you can drink German beer outdoors, even under an umbrella if you like.  One room has huge doors that they open to make it feel outdoors-y.  What you can't see in the pictures are the oak beams rescued and refashioned into 20 foot long tables and benches! No folding tables here. The owners here put serious effort into the decor.  I completely love the old metal signs with German and Czech writing, might be the real deal; the stenciled black paint on the grey walls tries a bit too hard (with occasional grammar mistakes :).  Music was random, could use some oom-pah, volume kind of went up and down unpredictably. On a Thursday evening visit a jazz band started about 7, live music was a treat even if jazz didn't quite seem authentic for a beer hall.The extensive draft selections focus on Czech and German beers.  On a 90 degree day getting a liter is just asking to drink hot beer so we stuck to halves!  The PH Original was very good and a total value at $4 for a half liter (Monday special, also discounted if you Yelp check-in). Puzzler: who brews it?  We tried the Hofbrauhaus (HB), nice but so, so mild; the Pilsner Urqell was golden and excellent; the Gaffel Koelsch was refreshingly light yet so pleasantly bitter; the Paulaner Helles was tasty, and my buddy liked the Hefe-Weissen Dunkel a lot too.  All those were $7 for a half, $18 for a pitcher. I know, nobody in Germany serves a pitcher.  Consider this a concession to the American market.  I happen to love ordering pitchers!Get the soft pretzel!  Order it when you order your first pitcher.  Really.  It's the size of an overside dinner plate, arrives far too hot to touch with both mustard and an interesting spreadable cheese called Liptauer.  Perfect with the beer!From the grill I've tried the bratwurst, weisswurst and kielbasa.  The big kielbasa was the best of the bunch, lightly smoked and perfectly grilled.  The bratwurst pair was competently done.  The weisswurst pair was good but lacked the Bavarian sweet mustard that goes with weisswurst, don't see how they missed that one, really (I know I'm being a bit of a purist) it's essential.  All came with a slightly unusual sauerkraut (had a sauce with a creamy consistency but not like cream-from-a-cow) and fresh fries.  Each sausage plate was $9, which seemed about right to me.From the kitchen I've tried the Schnitzel, braised pork cheeks, Sauerbraten, gulasch and Kaesespaetzle.  Each and every one were excellent!  The schnitzel was a plate-size piece of supremely thin breaded, fried pork, you might call it the chicken-finger option of German cuisine, but still delicious. The pork cheeks were chunks of meat with a texture much like corned beef, cooked until they were very tender and served with pretzel dumplings, yum.  Sauerbraten is a long-cooked chunk of beef also served with pretzel dumpings.  The gulash was a deeply red and deliciously spicy sauce over large chunks of beef that were also incredibly tender and with spaetzle (homemade noodles), I swear I wanted to lick the plate clean.  Finally Kaesespaetzle is available without bacon for the vegetarians, basically the mac-and-cheese option of German cuisine.  So it's mostly long-stewed-meat from the kitchen, nothing especially complex, but they do it well.Note that the grill guy only takes cash but the restaurant takes credit (huh?).On a hot Thursday evening the place was half empty we could pick any table, delightfully cool inside, strictly an adult crowd and great service.  On a warm Sunday afternoon the place was *packed* with lots of babies and kids accompanying their parents for an early dinner.  Yep it's kid friendly.The neighborhood is forgotten industrial area, with the NYC Grey Line bus yard across the street along with other various businesses that need cheap real estate.  I'm trying to say  it's not too scary, but it's a world different from the bustle of Washington St. I also note we were always to park for free :)I completely disagree with Steve B. on this place.  The food here *rocks* and about the only evidence for his comment about ""trying to hard"" are the black stenciled signs painted on the interior and exterior walls.I'm a big fan of German beer and food.

The walk is deceptive since you seem to be walking into a deserted part of town, then you turn the corner and it's like a beacon of light. A beacon of light promising many liquid delights! PHB is essentially a colony of astute beer drinkers tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Washington Street, PHB offers a refreshingly different scene from those at other bars. If you want to catch the game, you'll need to go somewhere else since there aren't TVs at PHB, just good food, good beer, and a more authentic old school German atmosphere with a modern edge. The wait staff donned uniforms that included trendy suspenders instead of lederhosen.The beer. Let's talk about the beer. The assortment of beers on draft is extensive and somewhat daunting for anyone who is not comfortable breaking out of their standard beer box. There's no Bud Light or Blue Moon on tap, but there are a good number of American craft ales and imported beers available in bottles, so if you must have a beer you are familiar with, have no fear! However, if you're adventurous when it comes to beer, this place is your oyster! I sampled things I'd never had or ever even heard of and everything was good! I was even told that PHB was the only bar in the USA serving the Paulaner Wisen and it was delectable! Other highlights - like any good BG, there's seating at long tables both inside and outside. Kids and their families have a curfew, so if you see 'em don't worry - they'll be gone at 9pm. Food was excellent - we split the Wiener Schnitzel, which was scrumptious, and the waitress swore by the sweets so we had the Apple Strudel which was flakey, nutty, and cinnamon-y - the whip cream was also obviously homemade and not too sweet. The only downfall was that the strudel was supposed to come with ice cream, but ours didn't and we thought that was odd. It's not until I looked back at the menu now that I realized we were accidentally shorted.

Go with the bratwurst or the weisswurst. Haven't tried the jalepeno cheese one yet. But the sausages here are better, in my opinion.Just not as convenient otherwise to get to.

I have nothing against kids, and I think it's fine to bring them if you're just going for a few beers with friends in the afternoon, but it was still like a school playground at night-- well after dark. And I didn't see a single one of these parents trying to keep their kids under control; they were just letting them run around like crazy. The people next to us had toys, coloring books, and baby bottles sprawled out all over the table (and they're communal) right next to their beer. This is a BAR, people.

After all, Zeppelin Hall in Jersey City is a pretty solid spot, especially in the summertime. I finally made it out to Pilsener Haus a few months back, and unfortunately while it resembles Zeppelin Hall in some respects, it came off as a sterile and un-fun place to be on a weekend evening. LocationThis alone cost it 1 or 2 stars. If you're not driving (which luckily I was that night), it's a huge pain to get here, unless you happen to live in Hoboken's up and coming West Side. It's a trek from the PATH, and although the light rail is closer, it's not the most effective form of transportation.  I didn't think I'd find street parking, but luckily it wasn't too difficult.InsideMaybe I just caught them on an off night, but the place was pretty empty. To top it off, they had some 80s music playing, which sort of killed the mood. The whole place was really dark, which made reading the beer menus annoying.Beer selectionDidn't stay long, but they were out of 1 or 2 beers we wanted to try. In the end, we sort of just gave up and had the bartender pour us anything she wanted. Not bad I guess, but nothing to write home about.ConclusionI might have to try this place again in the spring to see if it's any more fun.

Maybe it's my German heritage seeping out, but there's something about the ambiance of a good old fashioned beer garden that keeps me coming back--the long wooden tables, the warm fuzzy ""community"" feel, the enormous beer steins, the outdoor seating...Pilsener Haus & Biergarten to me has the feel of a German speakeasy. It is tucked away in the annals of an unsuspecting industrial neighborhood in Hoboken. Once inside you have the feeling that you've just stumbled upon something you're not supposed to know about, somewhere you're not supposed to be--like you've been magically transported by some sort of portal to an underground public house in Berlin (but with that signature, slightly more hip Hoboken flair). At Pilsener Haus & Biergarten, it's all about abundance. The vast selection of beer and spirits, full menu with waiter service, as well as two counter-style grill areas where you can order thick sausages, hamburgers and sandwiches--everything is sumptuous and decadent here. Even though the place was packed to the gills, we received personal attention from the waitstaff and bartenders, who humored us when we wanted pictures with them, and even wished me happy birthday and comped me a soda (Hey, I told you I don't like beer!)The line to get in was L-O-N-G, but ultimately worth it (Even though I strongly suspect that they hold people out there longer than they need to in order to make themselves appear more ""happening""--clever move, Pilsener Haus. I ain't mad atcha.) I also ordered a jalapeno and cheddar sausage which was either severely lacking in both the jalapeno AND cheddar departments, or they got my order wrong.

The food is fantastic as well...beet salad (at a beer garden?...who knew!), mussels, and a giant pretzel.  The meal plus two smaller sized (but still huge) beers ran us $45.  Not bad at all for the quality of what we go.  My only gripe?  Please nix the requirement that your waitstaff dress up like German characters, Pilsner Hause (unless this was for Halloween?).  It gives the whole experience a bit of a hokiness factor. But just because my waitress is wearing knee-high socks and lederhosen, doesn't mean I don't still have mad love for this place.  Super great addition to the neighborhood.  **side note: I read somewhere that they don't have tv's here which is incorrect.  They are not a staple of the place and not viewable by any means from all seats in the house but they do have them so we got to catch a bit of the World Series (that no one cares about anyway) while there",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

It's so light and refreshing - get that and a sausage with fries to split with a friend. We've had one big surprise birthday here and are having another birthday party this week (mine). They're incredibly accommodating - put the cupcakes in the walk-in for us while we waited a bit toooo long for the surprise birthday boy.

The food, while not as good as the nearby Hoboken German restaurant Helmers, is a notch above Zeppelin Hall's fare.   The motif is very classy, with not one TV to be found. The building is a converted 100+ year old warehouse that has been re-purposed as a beer garden. You are provided with a server at your long reclaimed wood picnic table so that you don't need to wait on line at the bar. There is also a nice sized outdoor space.

Staff is friendly and does not rush you. The indoors is sizable and has a separate room for private parties. Parking is metered on the street ($1 per hour) with four hour max; meters shut off at 9PM. We were able to park directly across the street from the Biergarten on a Saturday afternoon. I wished we could've stayed longer so I could've sampled more of the beer-- there is a variety. Sitting there in the Sun drinking fine German beer really reminded me of our trip to Munich's Oktoberfest a couple of years ago.

I was pleasantly blown away by this beer hall, but my expectations were pretty low since the last one I went to is the one in Jersey City.My husband and I poked our heads in when walking by on our way to the movies at 7pm last Sunday night. The place was decently full, but not overly crowded. We perused the menu and beer list, found out the kitchen is open til 11 (yes, even on a Sunday!) and came back after the movie. At 9pm, it was still moderately full, but we had no trouble finding seats at the end of a half full table in the main room with no TVs. The waitress was prompt and courteous. She brought us a whole pitcher of water, which I really appreciate. We were hydrated and we didn't have to keep bugging her for refills. The draft beers are available in pints or half pints. The majority of the beers on tap are German, but there were a couple others (Belgian, American). There's a bottle list that isn't that expansive, but has at least something on it for every beer drinker. There is a dinner menu that you order from the waitstaff and there is a grill where you can spend less and get sausages and burgers (which you order at the grill). My husband got the weisswurst and I got the chicken sausage (both tasty). They come with sauerkraut and either fries or a big slice of grilled bread. The fries are fine, but the grilled bread is excellent. The exact same meal at Helmers costs nearly twice as much. They must have made a real effort on the acoustics because Jeff and I could hear each other just fine, despite being in a mostly full and large open room. I probably wouldn't make a special trip to Hoboken to go to Pilsener Haus, but if I were in the neighborhood, I'd certainly consider going back.

Always a great time followed by a remorseful morning.It's pretty out of the way, even for HOB, but deal with it. Cabs drop-off and pick-up regularly. Great layout and excellent for groups and get-togethers, day or night. Not as big as the JC hall, but a touch nicer. Good-sized patio that fills up fast in the warm months. Cavernous main hall. Smaller side room. All ages in attendance. During the daytime and early evening it's not uncommon to see strollers and toddlers. Hey, parents can't always hang out at the playground.All the Bavarian beers a boy could want and they always bring in some seasonals. Also a full bar but why come if you're going to get a vodka soda or, worse, a pinot grigio.People rave about the food and it all looks plump and tasty, but I've never made it past the pretzel. Best pretzel around, maybe even in the tri-state and beyond. Warm and soft, and served with a spicy mustard and some kind of cheese paste that's delicious, and probably terrible for you.Initially, the staff had me worried because I thought ""I'm going to place this order and not see it for 30 minutes,"" but I've never had a bad, or even mediocre, service experience. The bar maids are very quick and navigate the herds quite ably. They do roll down a big screen for marquee games and there's occasionally some live music. I always love some good Oompa/Polka music and it truly adds to the atmosphere, but sometimes you're just stuck with someone's predictable iTunes playlist.The team behind Pilsner Haus hit a home run.

I ordered a bratwurst and kielbasa via Seamless and it took them 2.5 hours to deliver the food. I know that sounds crazy. Here is what happened - I selected this place specifically because the delivery time said 25-35 minutes and that is when I expected to leave work. 35 minutes go by and nothing.... I called at 50 minutes and the guy on the phone said it was ""out for delivery."" At 1hr 15min I called back and cancelled the order because I wanted to leave work 45 minutes ago. I stop at crappy Chipotle on the way home and eat that stuff. About 45 minutes after I get home my phone rings and it is the delivery driver with my food - 2.5 hours late. Besides not understand why the delivery was at my apt and not work, I was irate that someone would even have the audacity to deliver food that was supposedly cooked hours ago. I called and left a message with the general manager; however, she never called me back. Additionally, the guy on the phone was not apologetic and just said, ""we use a delivery service and they took it."" You can just transfer risk and responsibility when things go wrong.

The pretzel is served with mustard and a cheesy butter.  I cant get enough of the cheesy butter!!!  Husband likes the mustard.I don't eat much chicken, but when I do, it needs to be on a bone.  No boneless chicken breast for this girl!  Imagine my delight what I saw chicken paprakash on the menu!  I inquired with the server as to whether the chicken still had bones....When she confirmed -  I was in!  This paprakash was just like grandma used to make, and just as tasty!  Soooo good!  The chicken and the sauce and the spaetzel rocked my world!  I have had this dish both times I have eaten there (The 2nd time I wanted to try the meatloaf, but they had taken it off the menu)Husband has had both the sauerbraten and schnitzel - he is a fan of both.  They both remind him of his childhood in Germany!The reason why I am not giving it 5 stars is because I dont really care for the other patrons that are there after about 9PM.  I dont go there for a romantic experience, but I find it really bothersome when people encroach on your space so much that when new friends of theirs arrive they introduce themselves to you (this has actually happened to me on more than one occasion). Literally, in two different instances two different groups of people were on top of me.  I could not even get back to my seat after a trip to the bathroom.  I know this isn't the fault of the Pilsner Haus,  but I find find it really bothersome.Long story short, great food, great beer, great atmosphere, but be sure to leave early if you value personal space.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

Kind of like Helmers on 11th street, this place serves beer by the liter, pitcher or however you want to drink it. They have a lot of European beers on the menu and most of them that I tried were really good. They also serve a variety of European food that you can order from either a waitress or walk right up to the grill and order. I did not get to try any of the food but my buddy said it was awesome, and it sure did look it. The location if the place will throw you off since you will find yourself walking through a industrial area that you probably never knew was apart of Hoboken. But if that keeps it a hidden gem then I am all game for that. Once inside it is a whole different world. They have a great outdoor seating area, one smaller dining area with a grill, and the main hall with another grill and the main bar. The main hall is huge, has plenty of seating and will get loud since it can hold so many people. But during the warm weather the place to be is outside in the beirgarden.The staff there is extremely friendly and will help you with whatever you need. Whether you decide to sit at a table and order through a waitress or wander and order at the bar, both will get you your drink fast. I forgot his name but one of the bartenders was a beer master and knew what was good. Overall I gave this place four stars because of the great atmosphere, the excellent staff and the awesome beer selection. I did not try the food so I cannot vouch for that. But if I like what I get next time I go this place, it will be getting one of my rare five star ratings.

429,feqqhbxwGAPe9EOzAPr0sw,Paul L.,5.0 star rating,"I had the distinct pleasure of going to the Pilsener Haus on November 1st for my 32nd birthday celebration. It was just a few friends getting together, nothing formal. That being said, I was completely blown away by this place. I think the owner/operator should be more than proud of the job his staff does, as they treated my party of nine as if we were the only people in the place. From the bussers to our server to the guys manning the grill, the level of professionalism we experienced that rainy, cold, afternoon guaranteed a repeat visit.The moment I walked into the place I felt like I had walked into a scene from INglorious Basterds. The dining room itself is huge with long wooden benches reminiscent of those seen in Munich during Oktoberfest. Soaped over windows let in a dreary, gray light from outside, but the lighting, though sparse, only added to the ambiance. I heard the familiar tones of Loius Armstrong, the great Satchmo, on the stereo and I remarked to myself ""This is my kinda place!""We seated ourselves and I noticed that many of the folks, who were about my age, had bought along their babies and small children. Though odd, at first, we all remarked to one another how well behaved the kids were. Good on you, fellow diners for having well behaved children.But, I digress.The first thing I ordered was a liter of Steigl. Mozart's favorite! The server was prompt, attentive to our needs, and made sure our glasses remained filled with the beverages of our choice. Special mention should be made of the hot apple cider, which claims to contain 80% rum. I don't know what sort of kitchen witchery they have going on in the back, but while it didn't taste like it had any rum at all, it certainly had a kick that didn't overpower the flavor of the cider. I had trekked all the way up from the Shore to try the soft pretzel. It was worth the drive. It was large, buttery, and evenly salted. It came with a delicious duo of spicy German mustard (with juuuust a hint of sweetness,) and a German cheese that can only be described as delectable (why the Germans aren't more into cheese making I can't, for the life of me, figure out). I ordered the Bratwurst from the grill and was not disappointed. It had a nice char and a meaty flavor. The french fries reminded me of those formerly served at McDonalds before they went downhill and the Kraut was accentuated with just the right amount of caraway seeds.of course, it was my birthday so my friend's sprung some chocolate mousse on me. The waitstaff came presented it to me in a martini glass and a candle. The mousse itself was chocolatey and very, very rich. It had undertones of red wine and bittersweet chocolate with a glaze of raspberry jam at the bottom of the glass. Fresh, unsweetened whipped cream, as fluffy as your pillow after pulling an all-nighter, sat upon the mousse. Two cookies completed the beautiful dessert and it was eaten heartily and with gusto. Highly recommended for those who enjoy chocolate and great presentation.My girlfriend ordered the Creme Brulee and upon sampling remarked to my table that the rich custard indeed tasted like the inside of a Cadbury Creme Egg. The sugar was perfectly caramelized and not overdone at all. Again, I must reiterate about the service. It was exemplary and totally professional. So much so that despite including the gratuity on the bill, I wanted to give our server a little extra cash for her herculean efforts of keeping our beers full. She would not accept additional money despite my protestations for her to take it. I think it speaks a great deal to her professionalism. The bussers kept our table free of unwanted dishes and cups (which have a tendency to stack up if you're sitting a while,) and the guys manning the grill know what they're doing.So, in summary, I will be returning because it's worth the drive and worth the money.

The place is small and very unassuming, in the last place you'd think to put a bar in a city full of bars. There is a small outdoor area which leads to an open-air seating, and that leads to more indoor seating. As stated, the beer menu is extensive, offering a dozen (or so) import drafts, including a house beer (Pilsener Haus original) akin to a regular lame-ass domestic, but very drinkable in liter form. A liter of beer will run you $13 and pitchers are a bit more at $18 (if you're classy like me, you'll want to order a pitcher for yourself instead and be done with it, but they really don't seem that much larger). If you don't want a draft, you can also order one of the craft beer bottles (or, if you're one of *those* people, a freaking mixed drink... at a biergarten... shame). I can't comment on the food because I didn't eat (by the way, that was a bad idea), but it seemed to garner rave reviews from those who did.The atmosphere is lively and fun, and the bartenders were very nice.

I felt like I had to protect the last pieces of my pretzel. The guy tried to take my not-finished pretzel at least 4 times. Dude, I'm not done - I think I may have had to slap his hand off my plate at one point. Is there a time limit on how long you can eat a pretzel? Are you running out of plates? Whats the dealy-o dude? Anyway - when its beautiful weather, I recommend grabbing a drink and protecting a pretzel. However, the early bird certainly gets the worm when it comes to tables, so keep that in mind.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"
450,ohnjyce4lMu0JWRYFb4IQg,Crystal G.,5.0 star rating,"I came here on a Friday night after trying a couple of other places in neighbouring town that just didn't fit. One was TOO crowded, the other was TOO empty, so we  decided to venture into Hoboken for this place after reading its reviews. I was apprehensive because the only time I'd been to Hoboken before was when I took the wrong train trying to go to NY so wasn't sure what it'd be like (I don't like trying new things, lol), and I thought we wouldn't be able to find parking.So cut to ten minutes later, and we find a parking spot in front of the bar :-D and when we go in, it's awesome. I felt like Goldilocks, finding the ""just right"" bar. It was well-populated, but not crazy-can't-move-anywhere packed. The crowd overall seemed like a fun bunch. And my other worry, that I wouldn't be able to get liquor at the beer house, evaporated when I was able to order my regular drink.  The music was great at first, alternative rock-y, and then it changed to hip hop. I do like hip hop also, a lot, but it was an abrupt transition. You can't just go from Green Day to Lil' Jon with no warning!It was great, I'd probably go again, even if it is in Hoboken.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

They play good music and they get a great, friendly crowd each time i'm there.The grill has the best bratwurst and other sausages, and with their special mustards and fries, I have to order this when i'm there. The employees are all top notch. I've been a seasoned drinker in Hoboken, and even after this bar being open for a few months now it astounds me how NICE and HELPFUL the wait staff and employees are. I was outside on a cold late fall day having my beer outside and enjoying a cigar. No one was in their courtyard, and I was trying to see if I could get one of their outdoor heaters to turn on, but it wasn't lighting. A guy comes from the inside of the bar, and says ""Let me help you with that, sir"" - and proceeds to find a full container of propane and get the heater lit, so I could enjoy a cigar outside, with a nice beer on a cold night.This is just one of many examples. The waitresses are all friendly. The bartenders really know the beers well, and will suggest something if you just describe what kind of beers you like to drink.I can't say enough about it, and my only regret is I wish it was in a more central location.

Try the giant pretzel with cheese dip if you want a snack or the wiener schnitzel if you want some good traditional German food. The brunch menu is small and lacks a ton of option and the grill's offerings are simple and slow. The crowd is this place's biggest down fall - on Saturday's and Sunday's the amount of strollers almost out numbers the beers on the menu. It's something I personally find a bit strange. On Friday or Saturday nights it is full of overly intoxicated 23 year olds - although I find that less strange. Would recommend trying this out on a week night.

463,iN-KXz-iZ3AkdVav3Zo2PQ,Michael P.,1.0 star rating,"This was my first time at Pilsner Haus & Biergarten. I was part of a large group that got together for a friends going away party on a Monday night. They have a quality beer selection and ample space but the staff seemed annoyed that they had to do their job. Our waitress was polite and stayed on top of our section. I give her credit because she was the only server working and she had to cover a good amount of people by herself. The USA women's World Cup was on the big screen and when it ended I asked her to put on the Stanley Cup Finals and she was quick to accommodate. Around 11pm I noticed that she was closing out all her checks and asking if anyone wanted 1 more round. This was disappointing because although half of my group had already left there were about 6-10 of us that was still enjoying the night. When a guy from our group walked up to the bar and asked for a drink he was denied and told that last call was already called, at this point it was barely 11:30pm. For an establishment that lists its closing time at 2am they certainly had no intentions of staying open past midnight. I could understand closing early if there was only 2 people sitting at the bar but we were the remaining handful of people from a group of about 20 that had been there since 7:30pm. We were basically the only business they had on this Monday with the exception of a few couples spread out throughout the the night who came in for 1-2 drinks and some eats. The food (wings/pretzels) at this place were good, not enough to make me come back for them alone but definitely worth trying. After the bartender turned away the member of my group another large group of men entered the bar, it looked like they were all on a team together possibly softball or rugby. They walked in around 11:45pm and you could tell by the look on the managers face that she wanted no part of them. The general vibe of the staff was somber at this point. Our waitress returned to tell us that only because the group of guys had arrived were we allowed to order another round of drinks. She then explained that she did not care what time they closed because she was there to make money. Then I realized that the manger and bar tender were the issue. Nobody was sitting at the bar all night. The place is set up to sit at the picnic tables so the bar tender probably wasn't making much money and the manager obviously isn't making tips so they had no problem with shutting down early. After about 20 minutes I could see the manager was angry that she had to stay at work past what she would have liked. She began to make us very uncomfortable and at one point she even flickered the lights. Now my group of about 8 and the large group of guys were the only patrons left. The manager came up to our table and explained that she was sorry but it's was time to close. I wasn't even finished with last liter of beer but because she had made such a commotion we decided to just leave. When we were walking out I realized she never even approached the large group of guys to tell them that is was closing time. I did not appreciate the fact that she was quick to ask us to leave after we were a majority of the business all night but said nothing to a group who had just entered the bar 30 minutes ago. On my way out I made a few comments loud enough for her to hear. She followed us outside and asked if everything was ok and started to apologize. By that time it was too late and I told her exactly why I was upset and assured her I would take to yelp with a unflattering review. As someone who worked in restaurants and bars I can understand wanting to close early but when you are in the service business sometimes it doesn't always work out that way and you have to stick it out. Never in my life have I seen a manager act so unprofessional and basically make their personal intentions a priority over accommodating the customers.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

FINALLY!  Jersey City has the crappiest food that they attempt to pass off as edible but Pilsener seems to have it right.  The pretzel was awesome, as was one of the sausages.  Second time around we had the chicken paprikash which was awesome, the cucumber salad and the spaetzle were all well made too.Ambiance:  Being in a warehouse gives this place a pretty cool atmosphere.  When I was there it wasn't that crowded but I know people complain about the noise inside.  They can easily fix the problem so hopefully they do!

There's a large menu of Viennese cuisine and it tastes surprisingly fantastic. The pretzel goes up there for best pretzel I may have ever had. It was huge, warm, soft, buttery and almost impossibly fluffy. Ah-mazing. It was also served with a side of a delicious cheese spread and Bavarian mustard. It seriously was so good that I consider crossing the river just to eat that softy pillow-y goodness again. We also sampled the mussels, which were also great swimming in a smokey beer broth. Mmmm. There's also a self serve grill for those who prefer something meatier. While I didn't partake, my group of friends had an awesome time chowing down on their selection of sausages and fresh-cut fries.

There is NO Coors, Miller or PBR to be found, but if your taste in beer is less sophisticated than the target audience for this place, the well-versed staff will make a recommendation from the plethora of incredible beers on tap and in a bottle. The price is perfectly in line with the quality and selection. The food, likewise, seems pretty amazing, although I just had the big pretzel (c'mon, you have to have the big pretzel to get the full German Biergarten experience) and the Kaese Krainer (a beef and pork sausage with cheese). The burger looked pretty incredible. We were there with a large group on a Saturday afternoon, and despite the place being completely full, our service was prompt and friendly. No complaints in this department at all. While the space outside is rather small, the atmosphere inside (with two separate rooms) could not be any more authentic nor inviting. The exposed cinderblock, unfinished floors and large windows retain the rustic charm of the original warehouse space. Giant wooden communal tables, the beautiful bar and the lavish attention to detail makes this simply the best looking restaurant in Hoboken, bar none. And, perhaps best of all, there are NO TELEVISIONS ANYWHERE IN PILSENER HAUS (no doubt this is going to tick off a lot of Hobokenites used to being blasted by giant screens from every direction). There is one problem with Pilsener Haus, however, as has been noted in all of the other reviews: It's goddamn LOUD. The acoustics in the room are awful, when it's busy (which is almost always, at least right now), you have to shout to be heard from across the table. It's a design oversight that can--and I would imagine will--be quickly fixed with some sound baffle placed on the ceiling. The comparisons have inevitably begun between Pilsener Haus and Jersey City's Zeppelin Hall, but they're kid of misplaced. Zeppelin Hall (as I stated in my review of that joint) may call itself a Beer Garden, but it's not. It's nothing but an overblown sports bar with crappy food, a few decent beers on tap--albeit served in generic plastic mugs--and some picnic tables. THIS is the place to go if you want to experience the communal and epicurean joys of a true German-inspired Beer Garden. Yes, it's a hike from the PATH and kind of out of the way, but it's worth the hike. While I may bring a pair of earplugs the next time I venture to Pilsener Haus, I cannot wait to go back. In fact, I wish they had longer hours during the week.... my laptop and I would become regulars in the afternoon.POSTSCRIPT:I was informed that Pilsener Haus has a large retractable projection screen upon which select sporting events WILL be shown. This is sad, but I guess a necessary evil in the context of Hoboken. It does mean, however, that I will not be seeking haven there during the Super Bowl.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"
483,GBDjDtwYZ44JrWRZpnOc6w,Steve B.,2.0 star rating,"Underwhelmed, definitely trying too hard.  Go to Zeppelin in Jersey City or Radegast in Williamsburg instead.First, the venue: Pretty good size in the back corner of Hoboken, designed to look like a beer hall.  Yet it is a bit too bright for me, a bit too airy and spacious for my liking.  It feels like an American version of a beer hall, but I like the more pure German style, like Radegast in Williamsburg Brooklyn.  Second, the beer: There are 20 drafts, of which about 18 are German standards and two basic Belgians (Palm and Blanche des Bruxelles).  Mostly lighter beers, not too many bocks/dark beers, and not a single Oktoberfest beer on draft.  I saw good craft and Belgian offerings as bottles, but didn't get a clear list.  For better/more diverse draft beer offerings, go to Zeppelin.Third, the music:  Salsa music?  Really?   Really?The place is already wildly popular and will be packed for months to come, but it's not a real beer hall.Open til 3 like all Hoboken bars fyi.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

I WAS SHOUTING AT MY FRIENDS WHO WERE SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO ME THE WHOLE NIGHT. I COULDN'T HEAR PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE AT ALL. EVEN WITHOUT THE MUSIC, THE ACOUSTICS AMPLIFY THE NOISE LEVEL INTO A CONSTANT LOUD DIN. THEY NEED TO HIRE AN ACOUSTICAL CONSULTANT TO COME OUT AND FIX THINGS OR AT LEAST PUT UP NOISE-ABSORBING MATERIALS. IT'S SERIOUSLY THAT BAD. Oh, also, the prices are a little high for Hoboken. I feel like the beer garden in JC is cheaper? Pro tip: If you're coming from Midtown-ish or higher in Manhattan (or going there after) just take the bus from Port Authority and get off right at 15th and Willow. Don't be scared of the bus. It comes pretty frequently and once you get out of the Tunnel it's one stop into the north end of Hoboken.

Be prepared for GTL overload.-waitstaff is nice, they definitely worked for their tip, but the bar staff's attitude was too inattentive...minus major points especially for opening week!-sausages are yummy, so is the food off the regular menu-music is ehh, and extremely TOO LOUDOverall a fun place, but you'll likely lose your voice (or it'll go hoarse) shouting over the music chatting with your buddies.

There was a really large seating area with at least ten tables in a row , so it's a great place to meet new people. In terms of their beer there were a lot of great options. The menu descriptions of each type were very helpful for someone who hasn't learned what their favorite kind of beer is quite yet. There were plenty of sizes offered, which makes it simple to get a couple of liters of various beers with friends at a great price. The middle-age decor was relaxing and fun, and the DJ was terrific! I'm hoping to go back soon. My only complaint is the location-it's located on the outskirts of Hoboken, far away from most other bars in town. However, it's definitely worth taking a cab!",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

524,-Q_Wn5nkCJG1SxM7BUlJcw,Rob M.,4.0 star rating,"Oh Pilsener Haus, how I waited for you. I'd been following your pending opening for months, which in typical Hoboken fashion was delayed numerous times with what I can only assume was red tape from City Hall.This past Saturday I finally had the opportunity to partake in your glory. Having been a frequent visitor to Bohemian Hall in Queens and more recently, have been known to make an appearance at Zeppelin Hall in Jersey City, I was excited to have a Biergarten open within walking distance of my mid town Hoboken condo.Being a 33 year old father of a toddler and not a 24 year old bro who has a 'crew', my review will reflect that reality.For starters, mid afternoon on Saturday appears to be the optimal time to arrive if you're looking for a seat and to avoid crowds and a line. We walked right in and there were tables inside and out available despite being pretty full.Unlike Bohemian or Zeppelin, the majority of the seating at the Pilsener Haus is inside... and it is loud as err..heck.. inside, even when not filled to capacity. Outside seating is confined to a relatively small area (in comparison to the other beer halls, at least). I guess what I'm getting at is that I don't consider the Pilesner Haus to be very kid friendly. There were a few parents with their kids, but as someone who's brought my daughter to Zeppelin before, I would not bring her here. That being said, the owners have done a great job replicating the German beer hall experience. The building layout and decor is great - you might almost even forget you're in Hoboken. As for the beer? Terrific. All German drafts, and a vast selection of bottles. There was a real emphasis to make this place feel like an authentic beirgarten rather than a place like Zeppelin Hall,which while is  a great place to get a drink, probably has Coors Lite on their taps. Unlike Zeppelin hall they had menus of their beer selection... a little detail that matters.All in all, it was a great experience, and when the babysitter allows, I'll be back. We stayed for a few hours, tried a few different liters of draft beers, and by 9pm with the crowd rolling in, and the line growing outside we were more than ready to head home.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

Positives:  Great selection of beer!  Outdoor section. Standard pricing similar to Zepplin hall.  Negatives:  (1) Over priced well drinks  (Vodka/Cranberry $10 in a small high ball glass filled with ice. Vodka/Red Bull $13 small glass.  Any shots (standard 2oz glass) $8 each!  That's a VERY ridiculous!!!(2) The ""lounge"" upstairs, can not bring your beer from downstairs.  The security is very strict and want only a club/lounge feel.   They should have a separate exterior entrance and no promote that this section is inside the main area. (3) I asked to see my tab before charging my credit card so I can pay forward with some cash.  My card was run through without question and did not hear 1 thank you for a tab over $200!

While the ambiance is a solid change of pace from the typical 'Broboken' scene, I couldn't quite convince the fifteen minute walk (or five dollar cab) through the cold. My return left me wondering what kept me away so long.Upon arrival, I was happy to see that the wait times I experienced last fall have subsided. While they were certainly busy, seats were easy to come by and I had a beer in hand within five minutes of arrival. Not too shabby. The beer selection is vast and the pretzels are fantastic. I will warn you against a rookie mistake- the litre is unnecessary and heavy (but you'll probably end up getting one for the full 'beer garden experience' anyway.)After taking in the scene, I noticed another significant change : BABIES. SO MANY BABIES. I thought maybe there was a birthday party or family reunion, but no. Easy stroller access & the bench style seating brought in more young children than I have ever seen in one place in Hoboken. It didn't bother my group at all, but it was noticeable. Seeing a man in a Baby Bjorn with a big beer stein is a quality sight.I've been 3:3 here and would confidently recommend it.

Even if the beer or food isn't to your liking, I would come back just for the music and environment. You won't hear any lady gaga here. The music is particular and original to the theme. Without a doubt, it is an enjoyable experience. The place can get loud, but since when is a beer-drinking crowd quiet?

They serve really large beers here and have a wide variety to try in a ""flight"" sampler, which is really fun to do. I'd recommend getting the flight of beer and  the brat, on a night with music.

In the cold winters, no one wants to walk a mile here so we usually Uber. This is generally NOT a place where people get wasted as the beers are more expensive than at other bars.

588,9ZFOdE2txwc_lAnOO05zvg,Allison B.,5.0 star rating,"Authentic Old World Experience ~ Amazing Selection of BeersPilsener Haus & Biergarten is an authentic Austro-Hungarian biergarten. It serves premium European beers 21 taps and 40 types of bottled beers to be exact and a menu of charcuterian cuisine. I was so excited to finally check this place out, I love beer, I love beer in big glasses, I love staff who is well versed on what they are selling ~ this place has all of that. The food is authentic European fare and it's delicious, I'm pretty sure it wasn't just the booze talking. Oh and by the way for those of you who are complaining about no TV's, get over it, enjoy the experience.  Founders Andy Ivanov and Ladi Sebestyanhave chose not to follow the trend of installing 20-30 flat panel TV's all over the establishment, but would rather focus on making Pilsener Haus a true destination not only for Hoboken residents, but all over the NYC tri-state area. - Taken from the Hoboken 411 page. So there ya go. ;) There is also live music here so you don't need TV's. Alli's Report Card:Booze: Fan-friggin-tastic most of the beers come in these giant glass mugs so each beer is the equivalent of three beers. I can't pronounce anything but the bar tenders are patient people and will recommend something great according to your taste, light vs dark etc. Food: The food is awesome and comes from both the restaurant's kitchen and two hot grills in the wintergarten and indoor hall. Kitchen closes around 10 pm I believe and the grill is open til midnight. The head chef is Thomas Ferlesch - the youngest chef to receive four stars from the New York Times for his work at Vienna '79. My half chicken ($14) was delicious and well seasoned, and my friends all got burgers ($12) juicy and huge, very good. Decor/Layout: A + - Authentic and old world feel. The inside features hand-painted German and Czech signs, huge long wooden tables (make some friends) high iron-worked windows, the outside has tables and umbrellas with cobblestones. Plating: B -  - Not the focus of this place but you get fries and a cucumber salad with your meal :) Servers: A + - Every staff person knew their stuff and they were totally German or Hungarian or at least had the accents down and could pronounce everything on the menu. Lars made a wonderful suggestion of their Pilsner Urquell - deep malt, I loved it. Date Night: Definitely not first date destination because its very loud. But if you're feeling brave go here for the second date and impress him with your beer chugging abilities. Girls Night : Yes. Ladies skip the heels the outside has cobblestones.

As great as their beer selection and ambiance is, though, I do have a couple of issues with Pilsner. I've been here a couple of times, and, while the service is pretty decent (they're always busy, but the servers are pleasant, and try their hardest to keep up), the timing of the drinks-appetizers-entree has always been completely off. For instance, I went there last week for brunch, and my friend and I both ordered beers, a pretzel to start with, and I ordered off the brunch menu. My friend went to order inside at the grill. Before we even got our drinks (and this was about three minutes after we ordered everything), our pretzel came out. It's kind of hard to enjoy a delicious, mouth-watering pretzel when you don't have anything to wash it down with, so we waited for our drinks. Before our drinks came out, my sandwich came out. So we had no drinks, a pretzel, a sandwich, and an order in at the grill. After about 10 minutes, we finally got our beers, but the grill order took another 15... the meal just didn't really have a good flow to it, and we didn't enjoy ourselves as much as we could have.

593,SgsvTJYy6-HkS5tx13ZBZQ,Cayley A.,4.0 star rating,"I have been twice (both times during opening week) and have generally very positive feelings about this place. I was super excited about it opening, and I only live a few blocks away so that  is a definite bonus. When I went on Tuesday (the grand opening) I got in without a wait at around 8pm (the doors had opened at 7pm). It took forever to get our server's attention (who was helping another server), so my boyfriend and I went drink-less for about 40 minutes. I ordered a half-liter of the last draft beer on the menu (an unpronounceable/type-able named beer) that was brewed with banana and tropical fruits. It was a lighter beer with lots of different flavors, and might possibly be one of my new favorite beers. I was immediately not annoyed anymore at having to wait so long for a drink, plus it was their first day open, so I had anticipated some mishaps occurring. The second time I went was that Friday when some friends from out-of-town came. We also arrived around 8pm, and I had heard about a long-line forming each day, so we hoped 8pm would be ""early"" enough to avoid the line...we were wrong. We wait about 45 minutes to get in. When I asked the doorman what time the line started he said 5pm which is when they open. When we walked in we found a table in the main large hall (all the outside seats were taken), the one thing I found weird, was there was a long line around the side of the beer garden building to get in, but the inside did not seem packed or crowded at all, we saw lots of open seats throughout the night, while the line still accrued outside. I am not entirely sure if they are nervous about exceeding capacity because they're a new establishment, or if they are trying to maintain a line all the time to seem super popular.   That aside, once we sat down we were greeted by a super nice helpful server who took our drink orders, and took our order for the larger pretzel. The large pretzel when it came easily worked as an appetizer for our party of 5. The two mustards that came along with it were awesome, and the pretzel had a good salt-to-dough ratio. My group and I then decided to order off of the grill menu because it just seemed more relaxed than ordering fine-dining like menu items in a cafeteria-like setting. The grill seemed like the best option for us at the time. Some people in my party got burgers, and the rest of us got different sausages like bratworst. The sauerkraut was amazing. We stayed there the whole night because it took us long-enough to get in, and we were so far uptown that it just made sense, plus we were having a great time. I personally found the liter beers a bit intimidating, but tried one on my second go-around even though it seemed most girls ordered the half-liters, and it took me all night to get through it. I will probably stick with half-liters from now on. The music is REALLY loud, and its hard to hear your friends. I don't have a problem with music playing in the background, but I want to be able to hear/speak to the people I'm with, and both times I've been I've wound up hoarse the next day. All-in-all I'll definitely be back, but I think I want to try it on a week-day after the grand-opening appeal has died down (if it does); or maybe I'll try it out for lunch on a weekend. Either way, I definitely like it, but its not perfect. Hopefully they're working out the issues as each day goes by.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

The pride they take in the beer and food is immediately obvious. With a beer in hand, the tantalizing aroma of sizzling meats on the grill is impossible to ignore. Food: After trying the Steamed Bier Mussels (very fresh, perfect prep), Bavarian Soft Pretzel (never had better), Charcuterie & Cheese Platter (good, esp. for cheese lovers), Wiener Schnitzel (good, standard), and the Sauerbraten (flavorful and tender), I've concluded that ordering the Smoked Polish Kielbasa w/ Sauerkraut right off the grill in the dining room, plus any beer, is basically fool proof. That said, there are surprising stars in the mix like the cucumber salad. who knew?  In addition to many outstanding German biers, they also have a nice collection of domestic micro brews.  Now my two favorite beer spots in Hoboken are in opposite corners of town.

620,PlTlFkyaJijluANINAD9Lw,Ed H.,4.0 star rating,"Having experienced the Munich Octoberfest I was looking for some Bavarian Fest type beer, food and atmosophere and the Pilsener Haus & Biergarten delivered entirely.  I've been to some other places over the years that have promised an ""Octoberfest"" but this is one of the best.The beers are a great selction of mostly German beers and given the time of year they had multiple true Munich fest beers on tap.  I had a Spaten fest beer and a Paulaner Weisn which was new to the US as the Pilsener Haus had 40 kegs specially shipped over for the first time.  Awesome and awesome selection of German beers and fest beers.The food was definitely up to scratch also.  We had the pretzel, which is just plain wonderful.  Light and flaky with the right bit of salt and a great mustard and cheese sauce.  Highly recommended.  We had the bratwurst plates and they hit the spot also.  Two nicely done and tasty bratwursts with fries and sauerkraut.  A great plate.I love the space and the decor both inside and out.  It definitely has that fest biergarden vibe.  If there is any way they can expand the outdoor area, they should.  Its a great space but its too small.  The inside has great beerhall decor and is huge.  As others have noted, it is also insanely loud, and sorely in need of some type of sound abatement treatment.  Seriously, I hope the owners are reading this and do something about the noise level.  Obviously no matter what they do its still going to be loud and appear lively but there is no reason for this place to be so insanely loud.  It is quite a turn off.The service was ok.  These ladies seem to be working hard in a big place but they weren't around very often and the wait time on the ordered food items was pretty long.  I was also not thrilled that when she was taking our used dishes, our waitress also grabbed my half full beer and I had to get it back.  That was just bush league, especially in a beer hall.I would definitely go back.  Meanwhile I hope they make some improvements to fix the noise, expand the ouside seating and let the waitstaff know that it is not cool to take my beer.",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

Not to mention overkill.  It's not like there weren't a half dozen other TVs around the place!  As for the beer - I found it really strange (or maybe it's a new trend around New Jersey) that the large chalkboard listing the types of craft beverages have numbers on them that are NOT the price (as they would be in Germany or other places in the US I've been to recently).  No, the numbers are the alcohol content.   So my 5.0 beverage was not $5.00 - - it was $7.00.  It was for a very good pumpkin cider - but yo - these are LA and NY prices here.  And I've had better for less in both cities.  Asked if they had any bar snacks like pretzels or nuts and the bartender said pretzels.  OK - - but what came was a giant soft hot pretzel (bigger than anything I've seen in southern Germany).  Not a basket of hard pretzels. All right, why not try it?  I was hungry and it was good.   The mustard and the spread (Liptaur) were really good, too.  What wasn't good was getting the bill!  I never saw a menu, and the bartender didn't say anything and nowhere was the price posted.... I mistakenly thought it would be in the $5 range.  Surprise - it was $11!!!   REALLY????  For a f'ing dough pretzel???  It's not even that much with the bad dollar to Euro exchange in Munich - the most expensive city in Bavaria.  This place could be lots of fun cause the space is nice and it's probably great in the summer when you can sit outside.  But the attitude and prices are not. Brats which are far from authentic are $10 and up. The dinner menu was pricey too. Maybe that's why it was pretty empty...",Pilsener Haus & Biergarten,4.0 star rating,$$,"German,, Pubs"

One thing I would like to complain about is the rude bouncer.Me and my boyfriend go outside to wait for our friend who was parking and the bouncer told is he would close the door exactly 2am we thanked him and were still outside when about 1:45am he told us to bring our drinks inside and he would hold it for us as long as we return before 2 am. We told him thank you we really appreciated it at 1:55am exactly we decided that our friend was taking to long so when we tried to get back in the door was locked and the bouncer was on the other side saying sorry i told you i was locking the door. We tried to explain that it was only 1:55 but he wasn't hearing it. So basically the bouncer tricked us into putting our brand new drinks back inside and locking us out.
