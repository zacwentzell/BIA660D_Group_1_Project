0,iJlGqi_icG-BnIOLtoTUSw,Ashley F.,4.0 star rating,"Came here for Happy Hour on a Tuesday with a friend and it was almost empty. We were warmly greeted and seated right away and the server let us know about the 1/2 priced apps they have on Tuesday. Looking for a drink under $10, I decided on a glass (or two) of the luminance riesling and thought it was pretty good. Between my friend and I, we ended up splitting:Guac & chips - 4/5 - Guac was goooood, but I feel like the chips could have been a little better?Wings - 5/5 - I think we had three of each flavor (hot, barbecue, thai chili, and teriyaki. They come with ranch and blue cheese and were a good size with good flavor.Chicken taquitos - 3/5 - Maybe it was just a bad batch, but the chicken was kind of dry. I also do not understand the need for the mayo on top? It was just a thin layer, but it felt unnecessary, especially since they give you an avocado jalapeno dipping sauce on the side. That sauce was only just okay to me. I feel like it could have been a little spicier.Overall, a decent and well-priced meal with good service. I would definitely come back on a Monday for the all-you-can-eat wings or to try the burgers.",10th & Willow Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars,, Barbeque"
1,_TwgAShonhh5F1agEtDgVw,T G.,4.0 star rating,"My review is on take out only!I love the Willow Ave burger legit 10/10This burger is amazing, I always take out at least 1x a month because it's always cooked perfect (medium rare) and is accompanied by the best McDonald's style fries. For 16$ (total with tax)I think it's totally worth it! Burger comes with bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato and red onion. I have been there during weekends and the bar gets pretty packed but this review is ONLY on the burger!!! I repeat this is not a review on the bar as a whole. Excuse me while I continue to stuff my face :)New review- minus 1 star, the service is hit or miss even when you sit at the bar?! The bartender was nice once I got his attention but a simple hello would have been nice or even a smile of acknowledgement. Onto the food- we tried the onion rings 4/5 so crunchy and delicious (little oily) but they were not like your typical Panko coated. The wings 5/5 we loved every bite, the Thai chili was sweet and tangy and would highly recommend. Since it was Wednesday night certain entrees are 1/2 off, the pretzel coated chicken with mash potatoes 5/5 this is so good! It comes with a honey mustard sauce that really hits the spot. They split it for us which I thought was really nice! Overall the food is good and the service is nice - just need to get their attention.",10th & Willow Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars,, Barbeque"

It was about 2 pm on a Saturday and there were only about 10 people in the place. We eventually placed our order, and after 30 minutes we didn't receive our food or hear from our waiter. Eventually I got his attention and asked for a status update on our food, and he walked away for 10 minutes and eventually came back with our food. So after waiting upwards of 45 minutes, we finally got our food. I had ordered my burger medium rare, instead what I got was a medium-well/well-done burger that had absolutely no taste. It was supposed to have avocado on it, but in reality it had three small slices of avocado, probably equivalent to a fifth of an avocado. It came with fries which were cold and bland. My brothers food, supposed to be medium-rare steak and eggs, also was medium-well and bland. His was supposed to come with a side of home fries, which turned out to be 6 small dices of potatoes. Overall the food took forever, the food sucked, and was nowhere near what we paid. Hell, if we paid $5 I would still feel ripped off.

I was an avid customer, and I will never go there again, and I recommend that anyone considering Hoboken bars go away from this place.  Absolute BS to not let someone in who has had ""2 beers"" because they are too drunk... what a bullshit joke.Me, my family, and the 90+ people that we know will now never go there again.  I wish they were smarter business people but ""Ike"" was too convince the 3 beers I had made me a detriment to the bar.Joey.",10th & Willow Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars,, Barbeque"

Two stars because the ""specials"" deal appears to be some kind of trap, or else the management is trying to destroy their bar/restaurant with totally unreasonable pricing. There are no ""entrees"" on the menu, so the waitress told me about 4 entrees that were the special. I ordered the stuffed rigatoni with sausage tomato sauce. As you can see in the photo, it was nice looking, but definitely not an entree size. The flavor was good, but the portions and price didn't match. I asked when the bill came: $14 for such a small pasta dish?! This would have been $28 not on special? The bartender shrugged and said he didn't know, he wasn't the manager.Definitely put me off.

11,FhuoUc7XNoWfCDpMkn4kew,Elizabeth M.,1.0 star rating,"I've been to 10th and willow quite a few times and each time the experience is weird/uncomfortable and I tell myself every time that I'll never be back. The only reason I've gone back a few times is the fact that it's close to home and convenient. The food is OK, standard bar food/burgers and breakfast is served till 4PM. However, they have a full bar yet still give you soda cans instead of fountain soda - weird. Also, I've received my fair share of skunked beers over the years. Despite all this, the real problem is the horrible service and my last experience was the final straw.Right when we walked in to eat lunch, we were badgered by a waiter AND the owner to provide our ID's (mind you, I'm in my later twenties) including my senior citizen parents and rest of family that are well over 21....at 2 PM in the afternoon on a Monday. What restaurant does this?! It was very inappropriate, shady and frankly a turn off. Once we sat down, we ordered soft drinks and beer and they came back with the wrong drinks quite a few times (even the owner!) I also ordered an orange juice and after waiting more than 20 minutes, the waiter said they ran out. How do you run out of orange juice? There have been other times in the past where they have also ran out of food. After 45 minutes, the waiter finally took our order (after finding him in the restaurant) and rarely came back to ask if we needed refills on our drinks/water or to update us on the status of our meal. They also put someone else's appetizers on our table which only made us even hungrier. Just rude. After waiting an HOUR, a BUS BOY updated us that the food would be right out. After waiting an additional 25 minutes for our food (thinking it would be out any minute), we had to ask another waiter for an update and he said it should be right out. Of course 30 seconds later, our food came out except it was not hot at all and appeared to have been sitting there. The food wasn't even that good - overly burnt toast, warm fruit, soggy and cold fries, subpar burger and burrito that was sloppily wrapped. My dad literally eats anything in front of him and he ate half of his meal. Our ACTUAL waiter finally made an appearance 20 minutes later asking if we needed anything and insincerely apologized for the delay. It was awkward and even more frustrating since they didn't bother to apologize BEFORE we got our food. The restaurant wasn't even crowded. The least they could have done was apologize earlier on or give us an appetizer on the house due to the long wait. The icing on the cake was the food being cold and that we had a total of 4 homefries on our plate and a pic to prove it. Not only this, every time we needed something (refills, update on food, salt and pepper, ketchup, THE CHECK), we had to go up and find the waiter because they were so unattentive. Whats also strange is how we had at least 3-4 waiters this entire time including the owner - it appeared super disorganized and unprofessional. Also, we didn't even know they were waiters since a couple of them were in sweatpants. Bottom line is that we were all super disappointed and in disbelief that service could be that terrible. Honestly we are not the type of family to care much but it's hard to let this one go. The amusing part is the OWNER provided equally bad service so obviously the staff does not have good training. The only thing the restaurant has going for them is the great location in uptown Hoboken. The restaurant atmosphere is nice but definitely not enough to make up for the horrible service and shady AF business. It's safe to say that I will NEVER be back to 10th and Willow.",10th & Willow Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars,, Barbeque"

No one was in those rooms on that night. The bar was consistently full.  The bartender was very nice and actually talks to customers so he gets 5 stars.Got the salmon which was good and well worth 16 paid but would question paying 32 for it.  This is not a bar with 20 beers but they have a beer in every category.A solid neighborhood bar and if take advantage of nightly specials a good value.

My dad literally eats anything in front of him and he ate half of his meal. Our ACTUAL waiter finally made an appearance 20 minutes later asking if we needed anything and insincerely apologized for the delay. It was awkward and even more frustrating since they didn't bother to apologize BEFORE we got our food. The restaurant wasn't even crowded. The least they could have done was apologize earlier on or give us an appetizer on the house due to the long wait. The icing on the cake was the food being cold and that we had a total of 4 homefries on our plate and a pic to prove it. Not only this, every time we needed something (refills, update on food, salt and pepper, ketchup, THE CHECK), we had to go up and find the waiter because they were so unattentive. Whats also strange is how we had at least 3-4 waiters this entire time including the owner - it appeared super disorganized and unprofessional. Also, we didn't even know they were waiters since a couple of them were in sweatpants. Bottom line is that we were all super disappointed and in disbelief that service could be that terrible. Honestly we are not the type of family to care much but it's hard to let this one go. The amusing part is the OWNER provided equally bad service so obviously the staff does not have good training. The only thing the restaurant has going for them is the great location in uptown Hoboken. The restaurant atmosphere is nice but definitely not enough to make up for the horrible service and shady AF business. It's safe to say that I will NEVER be back to 10th and Willow.",10th & Willow Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars,, Barbeque"

No one was in those rooms on that night. The bar was consistently full.  The bartender was very nice and actually talks to customers so he gets 5 stars.Got the salmon which was good and well worth 16 paid but would question paying 32 for it.  This is not a bar with 20 beers but they have a beer in every category.A solid neighborhood bar and if take advantage of nightly specials a good value.

Saving grace: Monday nights.*Inflation, right? Unfortunately, for those of us who remember the good ol' pre-2016 years, the all-you-can-eat wing deal on Mondays has been bumped up from $5 to $10; however, they've included a new flavor: Thai Chili (I think), but it doesn't matter, as the sole reason these wings are worth it is due to this bar's shining star--teriyaki! Also, this place offers $2 Coors Lights which is amazing. Coors Light is one of the best beers in the country, and that I can drink inexpensive pints of it so near my home is a godsend. When I am old, decrepit, and in the throes of hospice, I want this beer to be dripped into my bloodstream via IV. In fact, I wouldn't mind if those teriyaki wings were mashed into a liquid pulp and also dripped into my bloodstream.Servers and bartenders are friendly. Urbano is COOL and nice. Bouncers are chill, too. They always recognize me and we exchange fist bumps in passing--even if I am not going into the restaurant, but merely passing through the neighborhood. Their commitment to recognizing me is what some would call ""going above and beyond,"" but I consider it mere congeniality, a palpable warmth.Weekends nights between September and April, this place turns up. The music isn't that interesting, but neither are the clientele who frequent this place, so what can you expect? That said, everybody is very handsome and beautiful, and by proximity to such beautiful people, I feel beautiful as well.

The regular burgers are also very good. I like the Willow Ave. Burger and the Philly Burger, both are outstanding. The Mexacali isn't bad either! Their lamb gyro is also delicious. We usually stick to sandwiches, but the pretzel chicken entree is pretty damn good!On Monday it's $5 all you can eat wings, the 5 spot is cash only and there's 2 drink minimum.

Pro tip: get there either early or around 7ish when the next fresh batch comes out.The service is always fantastic from the doorman, servers, bartenders. They always say hi now and even remember our names and we always feel welcome here. It's a great neighborhood spot during the week. We really appreciate the level of service they put out here, and that's what keeps us coming back and bringing friends and family as well.

The bar scene is really vibrant here and there are a ton of drink options to choose from. I'm partial to the mojito (shocking).-You are looking to satisfy a bar food craving. Wings, fries, pizza, dillas, mozz sticks- you name it. The bar food here is really good, and fairly inexpensive. Watch out for nightly specials like half off apps on Tuesdays and 5 dollar all you can eat wings on Mondays. The pizza deserves a special shout. Normally at bars the pizza is enough for one or two, but this is like a full sized pizzeria quality pie. You can easily split it amongst four- last time my friend and I shared we had a full half leftover. Don't go there if:-You are looking for a quiet meal. Yes, there is a back dining section behind the sports bar area but every time I come its always really dark and loud. Last time I was eating in the back area they sat down a table of obnoxious drunk people who would not stop yelling. It put a huge damper on the meal and none of the waitstaff said anything. -You are looking for a quality entree and want to go out for a nice dinner. They have some delicious options like pretzel coated chicken and shrimp scampi, but in my eyes, the prices are unreasonably high for a restaurant with a sports bar vibe. There is no reason that an entree should be in the 30-40 dollar range. If you are going to spend that kind of money on a seafood or Italian dish then you are way better off going to something with a more quality dine-in atmosphere like Zack Oak's, Anthony David's or Onieals.

Took a few bites between us and left the plates more than half empty. No-one questioned us to see if there was a problem.Got bill and was shocked that they charge $18 (yes $18!!!) for a quesadilla appetizer that was the size of the palm of my hand. A side dish of guacamole was obviously pre-packaged. Called manager Mario over to complain about the appetizer in particular and all he offered was a free dessert.

Cant believe I haven't  reviewed it yet but my most recent experience really egged me on to share my opinion. Overrated. Overpriced. Underwhelming. Uninviting. Disappointing. This sums up my thoughts in a nut shell. As soon as you walk in the door, no matter what time it is, you're greeted by a not so friendly bouncer who demands your ID. Ok, whatever, not a huge deal...but at least let me walk through the door first before grilling me. Seating is tight and this place always seems to be crowded. Their menu in my opinion is limited. On this particular occasion, I wasn't really feeling any of their entrees, so I thought I made a safe choice by ordering their buffalo chicken tenders. Boy was I wrong. Talk about bad chicken...I barely could cut it with a steak knife it was so tough. Also, I ordered my tenders with ranch instead of blue cheese and surprise, surprise, it came out with blue cheese. Not usually a big deal, as this is an easy fix...but it was impossible to track down the waitress to switch it for ranch. By the time she came over, I already realized the chicken was lousy and wasn't even interested in eating it anymore. On a different occasion I had come here for breakfast. I ordered an egg dish, which according to my recollection, wasn't good. The eggs were overcooked. And a similar situation, I had asked for ketchup and never got it. By the time I was able to track down someone to ask for it, my eggs were cold and my company was almost done with their meal. I keep coming back to 10th & Willow simply because its close and because I want to believe I could have a better experience....but its not happening. I get that you cant expect perfection when dining out and obviously mistakes happen but this place has never lived up to any type of expectation I have for a restaurant. Its expensive, the quality of food is very poor and the service really doesn't make up for the other departments that are lacking. With that being said, I will not return to 10th and Willow to give it another try. I've tried one too many times and there's plenty of other places in Hoboken that can live up to at least some of my expectations of what dining out should be like.",10th & Willow Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars,, Barbeque"

The hour mark rolls by; 2 people in our party have now left because they don't have the whole afternoon to eat lunch. I approach the blonde manager Peggy (???), who, by the way, is dressed in gym attire, and she tells me with an attitude that they make their food from scratch, so that's why it was taking so long. Oh I'm sorry. You and every other restaurant in Hoboken use fresh ingredients. Do you farm your own chickens too? Even though it takes forever to make it, the chicken cheese steak is awesome, so the BF and I gave it another swing last week. We called in for take out and they never gave us a time frame for pick-up; they said ""we'll call you when it's ready."" So what does that mean? You'll call me in 3 hours?

We didn't want to wait for tables at Elysian Cafe, so my friend and I decided to try this place out as an alternative. Turns out we would have been better off waiting.It's very hard to mess up eggs, but 10th and Willow managed to do just that. The Skillet Breakfast I ordered was a healthy portion size, but it had no taste. It's as if they cooked the dish without any type of seasoning. Even the ham used was severely lacking in the sodium department. The side fruit was not sweet, and my toast was burnt around the edges. The only reason I gave the meal two stars instead of one is because the Spinach & Artichoke Dip we had as an appetizer was one of the best I've had in Hoboken.For $13, I was really expecting a top notch breakfast, but what I got was pretty much the opposite. It feels like I paid Hoboken premium pricing for something I could easily get a better serving of at IHOP. This is the least bang for my buck that I've gotten in a long time.We sat at the bar, so I wasn't expecting a full waiter experience, but there were still many things I feel they feel short on. My drink glass was empty halfway through my meal and was never refilled. My screwdriver had very little alcohol and had way too much ice. During our entire meal, we were not asked how everything was and even had to ask for my own utensils. I know a bartender is not a waiter, but when entire place is mostly empty, I think he could have done a better job of making sure we had a good experience. The only reason I gave the service two stars instead of one is because the Hostess was very personable and made some engaging small talk while I waited for my friend to arrive.This is one of those places that may look better under dim lighting than during the day. On a Sunday morning, I felt like the interior was lacking personality. Most of the furniture looks like someone just picked them out of a vintage sears catalog. Everything is very clean though, which I did appreciate. There are a few outdoor tables, but they looked a little cramped. It's located directly on a corner and the street parking situation is definitely better than places along Washington Avenue.Food: 2/5Price: 2/5Service: 2/5Environment: 3/5All in all, I do not see myself coming back here for brunch ever again.

Plus, I felt compelled to cancel my card and get a new one.  After several attempts to call a manager and stopping in only to have the staff obviously lie to me telling me there was no manager on duty, I was surrounded by the employees and they were trying to get the debit card from me which I had already destroyed.  Why would they want the card?  Also, they wouldn't give me mine back.  Extremely suspicious.  Finally, after phone tag and repeated calls, I finally spoke to Mario, who claims to be a manager there.  He told me he cut up my card, declined to explain how two people's cards could get so screwed up, refused to explain why they wouldn't give me back MY card, and definitely didn't apologize, or try to rectify the problem in any way.  He was nasty and hung up on me.  At the very least, he could given me the 6 bucks to replace my card.  At the very least, the entire staff is incompetent, nasty, and rude.  I suspect that there was something more fishy going on, however.  I think they knew exactly what they were doing.

Just had a great meal at the Cuban on Friday night to have such a bad full experience here.Woman who served us (white, blonde tall woman early 30s) was rude and looked like she couldn't be bothered. My gf and I asked her a total of 2 questions and looked like she was mad we couldn't make up our minds after sitting down for (no exaggeration) 3 minutes. Maybe it's not her fault for the attitude bc she has PBF (permanent bitch face) but the lack of attentiveness is inexcusable. My family owned restaurants for years and I can tell you for sure, you start with a 20% tip. You can go up or down based off the experience. (Just an FYI for all you servers who get mad ab a shitty tip)The reviews I've looked at are pretty spot on. I lived in the city for years and had about a thousand brunches, this one was on the high side in regards to brunch prices. The huevos rancheros was the size of an appetizer and was lifeless. To their credit, it at least a came out warm.My gf asked for a egg white omelette. It didn't come egg white, and it was extremely salty. Btw I was gonna get a Bloody Mary....didn't get a chance to order it as we didn't see the waitress for 15 minutes between when we ordered to after I finished my meal. Wow.

Half-sized hotel trays filled with buffalo, BBQ and honey teriyaki wings. All the bleu cheese you will ever need in small plastic containers. And even all the wet naps you need.The problem starts with the fact that seating is free-for-all. Grab a seat and hope no one takes your seat when you come up to get your wings. I wasn't even able to sit with people I arrived with. Other people were reserving 4 seats with their friends who didn't come until 30 minutes later.Another problem is the wings just aren't good whatsoever. Buffalo and honey teriyaki are tasteless. BBQ have WAY too much breading. I swear I had a few that were just chicken bone and breading. Beer selection is just about respectable. The normal selections plus Dogfish Head, Brooklyn Brewery and maybe another 1 or 2 craft beers.Staff here is really nice. They definitely take care of their customers, especially their regulars.

Don't you wish you could say the same?! Anyway... All jokes aside. Because, well you know I take my food very seriously! ;)The last and much more recent time was last Monday (maybe my 4th Monday in a row) with friends for the Monday wing special. The experience was so very different that I almost feel as if I should do two reviews instead of one. But I can't do that! So I go all excited for the $5 all you can eat wings! The guy in the front wasn't all that pleasant. Anyway we pay and we get in after we're informed about the two drinks minimum as well as where we can and can't seat. Yes, if you're there for the wings don't expect to get the seats by the window. That's like first class on a flight. You're coach! You cheap person you! I go all the way to the back and grab a table with my boyfriend (his first time for wings here) so he's kinda lost. Then we go grab wings and just patiently wait for someone to ask ""would you like something to drink?"" Even my bf was wondering if maybe we needed to go the bar and get it ourselves but I say no they'll come... Eventually. Sure enough a lovely waitress (not really) comes. I say I'd like a glass of water please. She replies ""if you have the wristband it's a two drinks minimum"". I tell her ""yes I know"". She walks away as my bf tries to tell her that he'd like a beer. So she came back with two glasses of water. Then he was able to tell her what HE wanted. I could go and on but don't want to bore you with every detail. The bad service and poor attention to our table continued and just got worse as the night went on. I still enjoyed myself because of the great company and the delicious wings (except BBQ one) too sweet. Omg why is it so hard for me to keep it short?! Anyway, if you want cheap wings and are willing to be treated like a second class citizen on Mondays do it. Jk, not that serious. If not, make it rain and go on a regular night.

Unlike other tables seated around us (helped by another server), she never told us about the specials or gave us bread.   Thirty minutes later, our burgers came out.  I told the food bringer-outer that we never got the wings we ordered.  Waitress came back and apologized, stating that she ""never put in for the wings.""  Strange explanation considering she painstakingly wrote ""wings"" on the same ticket as our burgers...Anyway, the burgers were excellent.  Cooked to order, juicy and delicious.  Although we're not in a rush to come back, I would recommend the burgers here.  We'll try it again in the summer.",10th & Willow Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars,, Barbeque"

It is a little on the more expensive side, especially for the pizza, salad, apps, but their entrees are well worth the price. The corn bread coated chicken and buffalo chicken empanadas are my favorites. Their wings are awesome and on Mondays they do a $5 all you can eat wing special. On Thursdays they have half prices martinis...although girly the gummy bear martini is delicious!!The only downside I can think about for 10th and Willow is their delivery service. I have all together stopped ordering for delivery from there because I have always waited over an hour for the food and on multiple times, it's arrived cold.

We were seated right away, and I was pleasantly surprised at how large the back dining area was - the best part was that the tables weren't close together at all and we were seated comfortably, which can be an issue at some other spots. The menu is pretty diverse - good mix of apps, salads, burgers, sandwiches, entrees and even pizzas. They do a different flavored butter every night - I've heard of everything from Kit Kats to buffalo chicken. Tonight's was bruschetta and goat cheese. The pizzas are reasonably priced and are actually a large size. We tried the bruschetta pizza, cornbread crusted chicken and a steak and shrimp special. The pizza was good, thin crust and a little overcooked, but just crispy enough. The cornbread chicken was good. I was expecting a little bit more, but the sweetness of the BBQ sauce added a pleasant kick. My boyfriend got the steak and shrimp special, which was average. The steak was cooked as he ordered, but it had no season and it was drowning in a sauce that wasn't really needed.

145,nrB4ku7kcwB7pdcNYuSCYQ,Travis L.,2.0 star rating,"Wow what a disappointment.  I had higher hopes for this place based on the size and apparent classy decor.  I think it is starting to cater more to the bar crowd and really letting the food slip.Had the boneless wings as an app.  They were 3 chicken tenders in wing sauce.  Appeared to be frozen, bought in chicken tenders that were just fried up.  Ehhh.For my entree, I had the NY Strip Steak with bacon/sour cream mashed.  Ordered Medium rare.The mash was completely cold.  Had obviously been sitting on the cold plate waiting for the steak (placed on top) to finish.The steak was medium well to well.  There was one thicker part that was MAYBE medium.When I sent it back, the waitress came back out with a ""fresh"" serving of mash and the same steak.  The kitchen had insisted that it was medium rare, and that the dark dining room just made it hard to see how rare it was. I let her walk away.Then I cut the steak into 3 or 4 big pieces all the way down to check the doneness.  As I went along, the meat was more and more well done.The meat was clearly butchered incorrectly because it was ticker in some spots.  But in any case, no-where was the steak actually medium rare.The new mash was only mildly warmer and the green beans were transfered from the old plate and now even colder.I sent the steak back again, and even pulled my iphone flashlight out to show the waitress that it was clearly not medium rare.  She again mentioned the dim light again, but there was the flashlight showing her that she was wrong.I asked to just have it taken off, and she said she would have to ""ask"" her manager first.There was no issue taking it off.However, a major thing that pisses me off is when there is an issue with a dish, and a manager doesn't have the time to come over an apologize.  Seriously?  Either you are too much of a jerk to come over, or are afraid.  Either way, anytime a customer has a complaint, ***YOUR WHOLE JOB*** is to come over to make the customer feel appreciated.There was no followup apologie or offer to prepare something else.  The waitress asked if we were through, dropped the check, and walked away. My wife enjoyed her BBQ burger and fries.  I tried a bite and personally think that the burger at O'nieals is far superior.  But she said she really enjoyed it.Apparently the all-you-can-eat Monday night wing special in the bar area is the highlight of 10th and Willow these days.Save your money.",10th & Willow Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars,, Barbeque"

147,oMVnqtBt63iYlZAxPoHbIA,Donna F.,2.0 star rating,"I went here for brunch yesterday (05/18) with my boyfriend and a friend of ours we hadn't seen in a long time to catch up over good food and drinks. Below is a play-by-play summary of the experience (both the good and the bad):1) EARDRUMS BURSTING! WHY IS IT SO LOUD IN HERE? Picture walking from a relatively quiet street onto the tarmac of a busy airport, and you'll get the sudden, jarring transition. You might also hear a persistent ringing in the ears, but trust me, that's temporary.1a) SIDE NOTE: Most of the volume was due to a rowdy birthday celebration taking place two tables behind us, composed of five ""old enough to know better"" women and one 20-something dude with a braying laugh (think Sybil from ""Fawlty Towers""). They kept clapping and cheering every time the birthday girl opened a present/sipped a drink, which quickly became annoying. Tip: if the overly-buffed greasy douchebags sitting at the bar give you the stinkeye, then you know you're being way too loud. Food for thought.2) I couldn't help but notice that the fixture for one of the flat-screen TVs had globs of yellow, dried-up caulk protruding from the wall. This is what happens when you let your cousin Jimmy with the lazy eye install your fixtures.3) BUTTERFINGER BARTENDERS: WTF? Throughout our meal, I heard at least six glasses being dropped, broken, or shattered, and each time, I glanced over at the bar to see what the hell was going on. At no point did any of the bartenders apologize or attempt to sweep anything up. I'm glad we were sitting far away against the opposite wall.4) The food was good, not great. I had the Huevos Rancheros, my boyfriend had the Breakfast Sliders, and our friend got the Monte Cristo. My dish was fine; the guacamole was the best part of the meal. The crispy tortilla was crispy to the point of burnt, but the eggs were done right, and the roasted potatoes were cooked well. I avoided the fresh fruit, since it was mostly comprised of cantaloupe and melon bits (Jesus knows I HATE those fruits), and took a bite of the sliders. Very eggy and a little chewy, but the bacon bits were well-cooked. Our friend seemed to enjoy her Monte Cristo.5) I felt bad that our friend had to wait almost 30 minutes to get her mimosa, while my Mango Mojito martini and my boyfriend's coffee came out in 30 seconds. My drink was delicious (thank God the motley crew of bartenders didn't chip my glass while preparing it).6) Speaking of my glass, there were brownish-red stains along the stem and bottom of it. Dried-up sauce splotches? Blood? You make the call.7) The service was sluggish, but our waitress was pleasant enough, and she came to check on us a few times when she wasn't being hassled by the drunken birthday/orgy participants (seriously, the sounds they were making bordered on indecent. Is that allowed in restaurants? I'll have to try it sometime and see what happens).8) The bill was higher than it should have been, based on the quality of the food we received.Final verdict: has potential, but needs to step it up and work on their A-game in the kitchen.

The selection of wine is good and I almost prefer getting that instead of their mixed drinks. Don't get me wrong, those are amazing too, but a bit too strong for my taste. During the summer all bars in Hoboken can't have anyone sitting outside after 11pm (I'm guessing noise), so keep that in mind. All you have to do after 11 is take your drinks inside.

On the website it reads:  all you can eat wings $5.00 from 11am to 11pm. I thought to myself damn good deal.  Upon entering the Bouncer gave me ice stare as if he was Marco from Tropoja, like the movie ""Taken"". He didn't crack a smile. Is he a mercenary something?Bouncer: Dining in or WingsMe: WingsBouncer: (Stares at me even harder) - Two drink Minimum also Me: Like a comedy club right lolBouncer.  (Stares at me even harder) I know this is what he was thinking ""Your little quips or jokes are not funny"". Me: Dang. I hand him my left wrist  Bouncer: (Stares at me even harder) Wrong wrist, I need the rightThen he instructs me on who to meet inside I felt like I really was in some sort of espionage movie. I didn't listen to him.  Of course we choose the wonderful seating alongside the fabulous window of 10th & W. The sun was beaming in illuminating the masterfully done table-scape. Quickly the barmaid said ""ohh that is Reserved.""  I thought damn, this place has changed. I remember you could sit anywhere and just eat wings be merry be a Viking. She pointed like an evil witch with a bent finger, to the really dark picnic table like area. The tables seating was like summer camp . It was accompanied with the ever so fabulous butcher style table cloths. My friend turned to me, remembers this is her first time here for the wing deal and said, ""Wow so they treat the wings people different than everyone else?""  I kept explaining to her no, no, no...I guess they ran into some sort of problem. Actually why I am I making excuses. It is kind of messed up if you ask me. Kudos to the waiter he had personality, but kept explaining to me that there is a two drink minimum. My friend still confused asks for water. Threw us completely off because we were not sure If wanted to get a pitcher or not. Then my next thought was would we have to get 4 pitchers of yeungling. Whatever, it's getting to complicated just give me a yeungling and water we will figure it out later. One thing for sure the wings are great deal and tasty, yummy all the above.  Teriyaki very crispy and sweet tang to it, the hot was not crispy but not enough spice in my opinion could use a bit of crispiness.

I like the burgers... those are good! Once I got some sort of steak sandwich and I think I got an upset stomach from it so I wouldn't recommend that! One of their signature things is that they have flavored butters served with the bread that are different every day. It is a nice touch but nothing really too fancy or difficult. It's ridiculously easy to make a flavored butter and they definitely do not make the butter in house, they just throw some herbs and store bought butter in a hobart mixer for 2min and whoaaaaaaa flavored butter! They have nice specials during the week... all you can eat wings, half price appetizers, martini specials etc etc. The staff can be really nice or really terrible. I have definitely had some great service, but I have also had some awful service served with a sneer. I think some of the ladies employed here have a little bit of a ""I think I'm really hot (but I'm actually not)"" complex.

Sometimes she treats you right, comforts your hunger, and quenches your thirst after a long work week. Other times she ignores your existence, chooses her more well-to-do friends over you, and rolls her eyes when you walk through the door.Given that I live right around the corner, I've seen both personalities. Let's start positive. My parents love coming here for dinner. Their burgers really are something to rave about, especially when ordered with their oversized English muffins. Their beer specials during dining hours are noteworthy as well - can't beat a Sierra Nevada draft for $2.50! The owner approached my parents at the end of our meal, hoped they liked their order, which they had, and offered them drinks at the bar on the house. Unfortunately, they were headed home and respectfully declined, but had very nice things to say about the offer on the ride back.When night rolls in, so do 10th & Willow's clientele. One example of this should give you a good picture of what to expect past 10:00p. I've seen two young women, maybe mid-20s, dressed to the nines, sit at the bar, order nothing at all, and spend twenty minutes looking over their shoulders with not a word exchanged between them. After their allotted time expired, that was their signal to move on to the next meat market seeing as no one gave them the time of day and bought either of them a drink. If this is how these women wanted to spend their night, wasted effort (or lack there of) that promises to never live up to their expectations, so be it. To the bar's defense, this isn't entirely under their control. They are a business like any other establishment and everyone is welcome. It's just a shame that those that choose to fill this particular establishment are often pretentious and, hate to break the news, better than you.I've read nightmares of how the staff has treated patrons, though I've never experienced it. I've gotten nothing but great service and nice gestures from the owner, the bartenders, and the bouncers alike. The drinks can be a bit costly, but nothing to complain about in Hoboken, and their entrees are a little overpriced.The beautiful wood decor should not go overlooked. 10th & Willow looks damn sexy and really puts on a great first impression - much like your bipolar girlfriend on the night you two kids met. By last call, the stiff crowd loosens up a bit. Do yourself a favor and save this bar for a nightcap.",10th & Willow Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars,, Barbeque"

Upon entering my husband and I were barely greeted before the hostess asked for our ID's. I was certainly taken aback since I had come there, first and foremost, to EAT! My husband presented his ID, but I told the hostess I did not have mine on me - as I left my handbag at home. She shifted focus and seated the couple in front of us with a baby. After returning she asked for my ID again, which I again explained I did not have on me. I told her I wasn't going to drink. She said ""it doesn't matter, this is a BAR, and I can't let you in without an ID"".  Let me put this into perspective for you - my husband and I are both in our early 40's, and do not look under 21!  Also, if this is a BAR like she said, then why didn't she card the baby that was with the couple...why is she letting a baby into a bar?!  Also if you are a BAR, why do you have a full FOOD menu?! Let's be honest...you can call EVERY food establishment a BAR in Hoboken because of its young demographic. However, this was not 11pm on a Friday night...this was Noon on a Saturday afternoon!  My suggestion: they need to change their policy and have the servers card people at the tables during dining hours.

There was no wait at noon on Sunday, so that was nice. The ambiance is very nice- exposed brick, high top tables, a big bar.

I decided to get the huevos rancheros; their take included two poached eggs on top of a black bean purree and crisp corn tortilla, salsa fresca, and guacamole. This was also served with a side of home fries. The food was good- my meal was nicely portioned, though I think $12.00 is a bit much to charge for what I got, but they gave me a huge scoop of guacamole. My friend's french toast was the size of regular bread (nothing thick and hearty which I automatically think of when I hear french toast), but it was coated with lots of cinnamon and sugar and it had a nice crisp to it. Their breakfasts were pretty big, but I don't know if it was $16.00 Our server was friendly and came around with coffee and water frequently.

I heard rumors of these amazing wing deals and decided to check it out with a friend when other dinner plans fell through. Sure enough, on Mondays $5 gets you unlimited wings (teriyaki, bbq, and hot), but there's also a 2 drink minimum. Unfortunately, I am not crazy about wings, but my compadre really enjoyed 'em. Instead, I opted for the skirt steak salad, which was awesome! The set up of this place was just a little bit curious. I was expecting sports bar with that kind of wing special, but there was a fair amount of romantic ambiance in there. Candle lit tables at 7pm made us question the whole thing since we weren't sure what we were in for. The establishment is much larger than it appears from the outside, too. The further you go back (3 rooms in total) the more romantic it gets. When we arrived there were a fair number of seating options when we walked in, but they soon went away. By the time we left, the place was packed to the gills! Men were standing around shoulder to shoulder sucking every ounce of meat off their precious wings. How they dealt with the 2 drink minimum without a place to set their beverages, I have no idea. Service was good. Ambiance was unexpected, but good.

I came here on Sunday for Mother's day and I must give credit to the service, specifically Elizabeth.  She was very friendly and did alot to accomodate my party pretty last minute.I did not like how the tables were extremely wobbly, but they seemed to have an endless supply of wedges to remedy the situation.The major downside was how long it took to get the food.  Granted, we were just enjoying time with family, but we put in an order for my cute lil two year old niece as soon as we got there (she is unbelievably adorable, but does not particularly care for waiting on her food when she is hungry), and it took an extremely long time.  Likewise for the rest of us.Huge + for the muffins and flavored butters.  Muffins tasted great, served fresh, soft and warm.I think everyone really liked their food without it being spectacular.  My niece's kids menu chicken fingers were good, but no wow factor.  I ordered the breakfast sliders which is an amazing idea, but to sound like one of those obnoxious cooking/judging shows, the execution was a little lacking.  Maybe it was lukewarm when it arrived, but it kind of looked like a great idea and I could have done it in my apartment.  Even so, it was a solid meal.Drinks - + for being very strong.  - for being expensive.  No real drink deals (1 reublik has $2 mimosas, or my favorite Essex House's seemingly endless supply of alcohol with amazing food).So the brunch is good, but could be a little expensive.  I would return, and wouldnt dissuade anyone from eating here, but would probably prefer to explore other places in the truly amazing city of Hoboken first.",10th & Willow Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars,, Barbeque"

The atmosphere is pretty cool.  There is a nice bar with some high top tables, room to maneuver and 6 big flat screens to catch the games and big windows to people watch.  There is always decent music playing.  Through the first bar there is a second smaller bar and dining room then even another dining room back even further.  When the weather is nice there are a dozen or so tables outside as well. A nice touch for when the weather is cold they have hot chocolate outside so when you leave to walk home at the end of the night.They have a decent selection of rotating beers on tap.  If you know what to ask for they usually have some decent bottled beers as well if you know what to ask for. The wines are nothing to write home about, but a decent selection for (Mark West Pinot, Cloudy Bay Sav Blanc) if that's what you are looking for.  Fully stocked bar and well made drinks are always to be had as well. Willow has a great happy hour 4-7 every day, half priced domestic beers and martini's which means $2.50 pints and $5 martinis.The food is usually really good.  If you go for brunch make sure you ask for the muffins and butter of the day.  The mini muffins are usually warm and the kitchen is usually whipping up some sort of tasty flavored butter like cinnamon sugar to slather on the muffins. The lunch/dinner menu is really yummy too.  My favorite appetizers include the spinach/artichoke dip, the wings and one of my favorites is the buffalo calamari.  The sweet/spicy buffalo sauce covered with blue cheese is awesome.  The salads really good, the beet and cobb salads are standouts. I tend to not order the main entrees but the chicken cheese steak sandwich is good and the burgers are all pretty good.  But my favorite sandwich by far is chicken cutlet which features prosciutto, mozzarella and broccoli rabe served with marinara sauce for dipping.  No matter what sandwich you order, I would ask for the garlic mashed potatoes which are awesome.The weekly specials are really good.  Monday from 11am-11pm they offer all you can eat wings for $5.  There are buffalo and BBQ wings which are good but the best by far are the teriyaki!  Pair that up with a few HH beers and I call that a good night.   1/2 price select apps on Tuesday and  1/2 price select entrees on Wednesdays (the farfalle pasta is really good).  Thursday nights are  1/2 price beers and Martini's till midnight can make Friday's rough.All in all these are just a few reasons why I love 10th and Willow.",10th & Willow Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars,, Barbeque"

I've eaten probably well over a hundred times over the years and definitely consider it a good to spot. First off, the staff is always very friendly and attentive. The owner (or who I assume if the owner) is always there and runs a pretty tight ship.The layout is a large bar with a few tv's in the front and a more quite restaurant in the rear. They have it separated well enough that when your in the restaurant portion you really feel like your in a restaurant, not just a bar with tables.They probably run some of the best specials in Hoboken. All you can eat wings on Mondays, half price entrees on Wednesday's and martini specials on Thursdays.The crowd, even on the weekends, is always a little better dressed and more social then what downtown Hoboken attracts.Alas, the one downfall.. The menu tries to be more upscale bar fare. Some of the things work, some don't. I've never eaten a meal there that caused me to complain, I just feel like the kitchen can be inconsistent and the food doesn't always live up to what should be expected, especially given the fact some entrees are pretty pricey.All in all, its a great, reliable spot.

It's upscale, casual, sports bar, lounge, restaurant, or wanna be nightclub pending on the weekend night (I refuse to go on Saturday nights).  Drinks are pricey, except for the daily specials. It used to get insanely crowded when it was the only establishment in Uptown Hoboken West that's not on or near Washington St. However, the Turtle Social Club up the block on 9th and Park has now given this place competition as far as the bar scene goes.

I ordered the shrimp and pasta dish- $29 for 5 of the smallest shrimp I've ever eaten AND THEY WEREN'T EVEN CLEANED. I'd rather go up the street to Anthony David's where I can actually get a nice set of prawns that are de-vained, cleaned properly, and are the size of my head. When I spoke to the waiter at 10th & willow about this ridiculously priced dish that was extremely small- he totally agreed with me. the bill came to $80 something for 2 entrees and 2 beers. which if you ask me is RIDICULOUS for a restaurant; that isn't Michelin rated, that doesn't have a celebrity or even outstanding chef. I foolishly gave it another chance. one night i ordered a salad and some wings for takeout. as I'm eating it I find a hair in it. OK, i work in the restaurant biz- i know these things happen. fine. i pick it out and move on, trying to forget about it. midway though my salad I start choking on a hair that was literally half way down my throat. I am not kidding when i say my friend had to pat me on the back several times so as not to swallow it. I somehow managed to pull it out to find a long black hair. Being a blond i knew it wasn't mine and was so disgusted at this point I put everything in the trash. Called the next day to speak to a manager and was finally called back the next day by the owner. WHO IS A COMPLETE A$$HOLE. he hurried me off the phone, hardly apologized and was like if you want another salad call me. We were on the phone for about 40 seconds and i get that there isn't much to say, but this d bag was not sorry and didn't really care about the hair in the salad situation.

Although I can't quite figure out what kind of place it wants to be, it seems to be balancing its multiple personalities quite nicely. When we first walked in I thought my friend must have taken us to a sports bar because the front room was noisy and filled with people watching football playoffs. (Love football but my team didn't make the playoffs and I just wasn't in the mood.) We were lead to a table in the back, but first walked into another room where there were no tables and just people standing up at the bar. It was bumping dance music and a group of girls had hung a ""Happy Birthday Bitch"" sign on the wall. Classy. But we finally reached the back of the restaurant which was perfectly civilized and full of people quietly having dinner. The place was pretty busy and our waiter did a pretty good job managing all the tables he had which was the entire back room. My friend and I shared the Skirt Steak Salad and the Mexicali Burger. The salad was tasty but nothing amazing. I found the steak to be a little chewier than I prefer and I realize this has something to do with the cut of meat but also know that skirt steak prepared well doesn't require quite as much masticating. The Mexicali burger was delightful--nice and big and cooked perfectly. It had ample, fresh avocado (not slightly browning, mushy, or stingy like most places) and the roll it was on was excellent. The only lackluster part of the burger was the fries--they were completely uninspired, kind of cold, and no better than something you could get at at Denny's.",10th & Willow Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars,, Barbeque"

However, I was so offended by my recent visit to this 'restaurant' that I can't help now but to vent.I recenetly moved from NYC to Hoboken and have been hard pressed to find many options for young professionals who are not still in to the college partying scene that is so prevalent there; especially downtown. So my boyfriend and I took to exploring the uptown bars/restaurants to find something more our style. When passing by on the street, this place looked great! It had a beautiful back dining room with several tables by the windows. We were excited to find something with an older crowd and stepped in for dinner after work one evening to grab a bit to eat and a few drinks.Me: ""Hi, its going to be just 2 for dinner.""Hostess: ""For dinner, or would you like to go to the bar?""Me: ""No, just a table for dinner.

We came here to sit down for dinner?""I could keep going, but you get the picture... I was so put off by this first experience that it ruined my meal and I will never give them my business again. Would they really reject a customer for dinner if they were 20?? I asked our waiter if this was common practice and he replied that yes, she asks everyone who comes in the door (...even for dinner???). I have never seen such a thing.

Of course I found that the bartender I was dealing with was not the best; however the rest of the staff was helpful and friendly.

They always infuse something in their butter (e.g. orange peel, strawberry, etc.) that comes with the bread basket, which is quite neat. They have really good wings. They have 3 flavors, and I like the teriyaki one best. During the summer, they have a tasty and refreshing lobster roll.",10th & Willow Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars,, Barbeque"

Good personality and great drinks. The owner could not have been more welcoming. Bought us, and others, a round of drinks as well as gave us a tour of his restaurant. Friendly, local bar and patrons and we made reservations while there for dinner Wednesday night.  Go, it's fun and you won't be disappointed.  I gave it four stars only because we have yet to try the food.

In the end we spent around $95.00 with tip which was such a waste of money. So overpriced for not great food.

This place would get 5 stars if it wasn't for the night-scene and the long wait for our food. I love small touches like the muffins before your meal. We all ordered burgers.

252,i3S3ZYlPBbXYPpyoiG8S8A,Kristoffer B.,2.0 star rating,"Stopped in on the way home for a burger and app with my girl. A guy sitting on Walmart plastic chairs out front brought us inside, never said to enjoy ourselves or made it clear who he was. To me he was some Jersey doucher with an Affliction T-shirt and takes roids that happened to be there helping. Server seemed like he didn't want to be there. Way too dark. Calamari was overlooked. When saying thank you to server or food runner, a ""yup"" was said. Clearly manners and class don't rank high on priority of hiring. Menu was RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED. Pork chop for $30+!?  Unless it's from Neiman Ranch or I'm on 5th ave in the city, stop kidding yourself that it's worth over $24 for a pork chop.  Burgers are mediocre at best. Calamari was rubbery and over cooked. Asked for our food to go BC the atmosphere and servers were so sterile that we would rather eat at home. When asked to have our food to go, server seemed pissed and put-out to simply put it into a container. Long story short, the food is mediocre at best, way too overpriced, and service should all be fired and replaced with people that want to work, have a personality. Service could have saved them a bad review on here and anyone I run across, as sometimes it makes up for shortcomings. Don't waste your time here. Walk to Hoboken Bar and Grill and get twice the food quality, service, and value. Shame on you for preying on people that don't know the difference of a rip off and a upscale grill/bar.",10th & Willow Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars,, Barbeque"
253,k_vsoK-7Cdbmz8eH4TJwBQ,Christina h.,5.0 star rating,"picture this, Monday night and me and my girlfriend are craving for wings. all we wanted were wings from 10th and willow --but we live 25 minutes away and it's already 10:30 and finding parking in hoboken is like trying to find a needle in a haystack! we felt adventurous, so we took the trip. got there at 10:55 and double parked our car right next to the spot. went in, but the wings they were gone. never to fear my girlfriend is a social butterfly and we had been here before so she's cool with the bouncer. next thing i know we have wings at our table an assortment of teriyaki, bbq, and hot enough for about 3 people. and we had beer!! they took care of us and it felt good. it's a cool spot, the wings are banging! i especially love the teriyaki wings. the first time we went it was really packed, who's trying to miss out on $5 all you can eat wings and $2 draft beer? the 2nd time it was almost empty because the deal was over. they treated us really well and i have a good time each time we come here! when packed it'll be hard to find seating but if your girl is as good as mine you'll have seating in no time.",10th & Willow Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars,, Barbeque"

So he is too drunk to be here???"", in which I explained that we were at a BAR at 6pm on a Saturday for dinner and he basically ruined the birthday dinner by interrogating the way he did.  Really?  We're at a bar, I get that you don't want wasted assholes coming in and causing problems, but seriously?  We were SITTING at a table, EATING dinner.  I will never go there again and I suggest that if you go, you probably shouldn't have any drinks, since you might be asked to leave.",10th & Willow Bar & Grill,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars,, Barbeque"

The best meal I've had in Hoboken. A tuna encrusted with toasted sesame seeds posessed all the nuanced flavors of a storied Manhattan bistro. A cobbler that leaves your mouth in disbelief. As for the scene inside? No clue. We ate outside. Something I reccomend after reading the somewhat disparaging remarks about the obnoxious crew indoors. We had a nice, quiet dinner.
