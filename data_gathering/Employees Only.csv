0,ZE9_VUoJWxMDzN4_BpOT1Q,ALEXANDER M.,5.0 star rating,"wow!!! the drinks are incredible!! i am so glad i researched where to go for my week long trip to nyc. if you like to drink(trust me) you will absolutely love this place! the food is just as great. try the bacon wrapped lamb chops or better yet...the elk loin! the crowd is cool and i enjoyed the music and atmosphere. a perfect place to go for a first date or to hang out with friends to drink. my server yael was great and kept the drinks coming. the drinks...i recommend the vesper(especially if you are a fan of 007). the yellowjacket has a nice kick and i quickly understood how it probably got it's name. for your date, get here the mara hari. this place takes bartending to another level. the only minor issue was the guy working the door with the sailor hat. he needs to be more professional. i was asked if i was there for drinks or dinner and i stated both. he replied by saying ""no, seriously?"" i told him i had a reservation and then he escorted me inside as if he did not believe me. i will be back next year in nyc and will return to this place at least once. open similar in l.a.!!",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

3,OQ4GRir0SlvBa-eON1l3Ag,Heather N.,4.0 star rating,"I've come here more times than I can count, and I always seem to have a great experience, whether it be for early night drinks, late night drinks, or dinner.  The mood is relaxed, warm and low key, yet vivacious.  The people watching is primetime, the drinks and food are delicious, and I always end up meeting lots of cool personalities at the bar and in random places like the bathroom lines.  Everyone here gives me a friendly vibe, from the staff to the partons.  If you are going for dinner, make sure to make reservations in advance for a table in the back garden as they fill up quickly.  I subtracted a star because of the hoax card reader that sits in the window.  The card reading room is completely annoying and totally gimmicky, so I'm pretty embarassed about what I am now about to confess -- I got sucked in one night and decided to let her read my cards.  The experience, all 2.5 minutes of it (and that's being extremely generous) were the worst 2.5 minutes of my night out.  Employees Only, I want those 2.5 minutes and my $20 bucks back.  I know, I know, it's ME that's the sucker for paying $20 bucks to a card reader wearing glitter eyeshadow and a turban siting in the window of a dimly lit bar!!  But the thing that pissed me off more than anything (more than the fortune's measly length of 2.5 mns costing me $20--WTF?!) was the fact that the teller was completely SHAMELESS about her lack of skill.  She wasn't crafty, clever or creative in her act of ripping me off, and she definitely wasn't sober-- it was as though she'd sat down at the bar for about 5 hours, and then decided to move to the front to snap up some money from some gullible partons.  After 30 seconds of her drivel, my brain was leaking out of my ear, and I was fighting the urge to hit her over the head w/ her magic balls.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"
