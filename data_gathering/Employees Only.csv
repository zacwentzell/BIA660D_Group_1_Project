I saw bone marrow poppers on the menu and just knew that this was where we had to go. I would definitely recommend making a reservation otherwise you might have to wait outside in the cold (or heat depending on the time of year) while spots open up inside. It does look like a psychic shop, but their logo is on the awning and looks like a key but is really EO. We ordered the thunder in paradise and almost there for the cocktails. The thunder in paradise was honesty too sweet for me, but it's definitely a good choice for those who don't love the taste of alcohol! The almost there was pretty minty and very refreshing. We got the bone marrow poppers and ricotta gnocchi to start, my boyfriend ordered the ribeye, and I ordered the cavatelli. The bone marrow poppers were amazing, and I don't even like bone marrow that much! It comes with 3 in an order, but our waitress offered to make it 4 so we could each have two. We didn't end up doing that so not sure how much extra that would've cost, but it was a nice offer! The gnocchi was pretty small - it only had about 6 gnocchi, but it was delicious! I loved the butternut squash sauce. I also heard the table next to us order it as an entree, and they offered to make it a larger order. The ribeye was ENORMOUS and was so yummy. It was cooked perfectly, and the potato gratin it came with was also amazing. I loved my cavatelli. It tasted like it was made in house, and the texture was perfect. There was also a solid amount of spicy pork sausage in it. I honestly haven't had pasta that good in a long time. Lastly, we ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was definitely one of the best, if not the best, cheesecake I've ever had. It was so light, almost like a Creme brûlée, and didn't feel heavy at all, which was great considering we were stuffed from our appetizers and entrees.

We decided on the fraise sauvage (gin, wild strawberries, vanilla, and prosecco) and amelía (vodka, elderflower liqueur, puréed blackberries, and lemon juice).

I had a Penicillin and the drink was super flavorful and had a good kick of ginger. We also decided to eat the Parmesan fries with garlic aioli and they were addicting (there's nothing better than a crispy French fry). The bill was a bit expensive, but that's probably assumed when going here. Highly recommend for a fun night out, overall great experience.

Our bride to be had this place top of her list and deservedly so! We had some late night bites here and everything was so delicious! We enjoyed a grilled cheese and fries as well as the pastrami croquettes. The croquettes were DIVINE. While we dined, we had some great craft cocktails as well. Once we were done eating, we stayed in the bar area and sang our little hearts out. My only complaints here are that the bar is INSANELY crowded and the music was SUPER depressing at the end of the night. I have never felt so claustrophobic before. I seriously doubt they're in fire code with how many people are crammed in here. While this place is open late, they do a lot to get you to leave before the closing time- namely play THE most depressing music right before closing. That's ultimately why we called it quits. All in all, this place is a great spot and it's obvious why it's so crowded.

We arrived at 9:30 pm and there was already a line. Normally, I take that to be a good sign. It's early in the night and there's a line out the door. This place must be good. The wait was about half an hour before we got in. The decor is nice and I love the ambiance, but it was WAY overcrowded. This is what ruined my experience overall. Someone is always bumping into you, I was worried about spilling my drink the whole time. It's also impossible to get drinks at the bar and I thought their cocktails were overrated. I got the Provencal and my husband got the Billionaire Cocktail. Mine was a lavender infused cocktail. I normally like lavender, but it's usually more subtle. It was very prominent in the drink and it muddled the other flavors. I ended up giving it to my friend to chug because I couldn't have more than 5 sips. My husband didn't like his cocktail either.Overall, I had high hopes, but my idea of a fun night doesn't consist of constantly bumping into people because there's no space in the bar.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

I found the scene inside to be a little ""too cool for school."" But, if that's the environment you like then you would probably really enjoy this place. The man at the front door was very friendly as was our waitress, but bartenders, cocktail servers and coat check all provided the vibe that they didn't really have time for me or anyone in my party.I came here with a large party of 9 people. Between the group of us, we ordered almost everything on the menu. I was happy to be able to try so many different foods. This menu is definitely geared toward the adventurous eater. Our appetizers included everything from oysters to bone marrow to a good old charcuterie and cheese board. I thought everything tasted delicious, even the foods I don't normally eat (bone marrow!). For an entree I ordered the squid ink, octopus risotto. I am such a sucker for risotto and octopus is one of my new favorite dishes so I did really enjoy this! The squid ink flavor is quite strong, stronger than I was expecting. But again, this was a fun and adventurous meal. I wouldn't want to eat here on the regular but I enjoyed it for a fun, ladies night out. The cocktails were INCREDIBLE, as I would expect from a speakeasy. I was a big fan of the ""besos"" tequila drink. Our table ordered tons of different cocktails and we were so pleased with all of them. Some other favorites were the strawberry prosecco cocktail and the one that had a dark elderberry syrup in it. Our waitress was so lovely.

It will be amazing I am sure.  Based upon the cocktails alone I think one could be fairly certain to be served a delicious and adventurous meal.  I must say that for NYC this establishment was accepting and unpretentious despite its super hip and trendy vibe.  I felt welcomed in my dungarees.  I would go back a little bit more finely dressed just because I would want to fit in a little bit better, but yet I was relieved to be treated well in what I was wearing.  The cocktails (and if you follow me, you know this is my jam) were wonderful.  We had such fun trying what sounded amazing and then was delivered in amazing style.  And then the final test: taste, flavor, bouquet...try anything, everything.   Close your eyes and point at the menu and say ""yes""...no disappointments here.  Thankfully it is Employees Only.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

17,8e0y0KJDEOiUqdoUCZNw4Q,Jay R.,4.0 star rating,"I came here for a work dinner and was pleasantly surprised with the place. The outside is very unassuming with barely any signs, so it almost reminded me of a speakeasy. I started my drinks with a ginger smash and while I thought it was good, I thought it was a bit overhyped. The Billionaire Cocktail and Quiet Storm tasted much better. For food, we ordered the prix fixe menu (gnocchi, steak tartar, charcuterie for appetizers) but we each had our choice of the main entree. I went with the pork chop and I started to regret my decision once I saw my coworker's gigantic rib eye being served. However, once I tasted my pork chop and compared it to his rib eye then I knew I made the right choice. The ribeye was cooked perfectly, but did not have much flavor to it compared to the pork chop. I barely had room for dessert, but the heart knows what it really wants. I tasted a few items, but the one that stood out was the butterscotch cheesecake (which I completely devoured).",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"
18,mOOP1V-_-Hpd500q8gOoJw,Nikolette F.,5.0 star rating,"My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate his 21st birthday and we waited to do so for a very long time. We were initially supposed to go over a year ago, but were denied at the door for not being 21. We went back a second time with the impression that we could go in if it was early enough in the day (miscommunication with the host) but we were again denied. Frustration was an under statement but we swore that if we ever got in that it better be some of the best damn food we'd ever had.... and you know what? It was fantastic! I couldn't have l picked a better place to spend such an important occasion with the one that I love.  For appetizers we ordered: Ricotta Gnocchi with Butternut Squash, Balsamico, Brown Butter & Pepitas - $14& Cheese Plate with Lavash, Herbs, & Honeyed Pistachios - $ 23 We were informed that the Gnocchi was home made and it tasted exactly like that. There were a lot of ingredients but it came together in a very subtle way and ultimately was flavorful but not over powering.  We got the cheese plate because that's been a thing of mine recently. All of the cheeses were imported and fresh. The honeyed pistachios were a beautiful and creative pairing. I actually want to add that to some of my own plates moving forward. The olive oil included went well as well. My only complaint would have to be that the lavash served with it shouldn't have been the only type of bread/cracker. I would have liked something with a crunch or more flavor. In addition there were these powdered nuts? They were nuts with something on them and they didn't bring much to the plate except for redundancy. I'd suggest maybe dry fruit, regular fruit, or a chutney?  Either way it was all pretty impressive and worth the price. For entrées: Skate Paprikás with Spaetzle & Crème Fraiche - $26&Roasted Half Chicken with Celery Root, Broccolini& Heirloom Cherry Tomato - $27 I had the Skate and I hadn't even heard of it until I looked it up at the table. Kudos to them for being so  exotic sincerely. I can't compare it to much, but it was really really good. The sauce was great too and packed a big punch which I like for a main course. I just wish it came with a vegetable and less sauce. A little truly does go a long way with that much flavor. I really can't complain. I can't say a much about the chicken, but I got a thumbs up from him. In addition his Broccolini was sooo good. I wanted some of my own. They offered sides as an item on the menu, but I don't think it's fair to pay for a entree and only get a protein. For dessert: Butterscotch & Mascarpone Cheesecake with Sea Salt & Nut Brittle - $10All I can say is wow. I have never cut into a piece of cake that smooth and soft. The people next to us made the exact same expression when they cut into theirs. It tasted even better than it looked and that's saying something. I really liked the nut brittle and sea salt combination too along with the cake. It created and sour and sweet sort of dialogue.Finally Drinks: Pedro Ximenez, ""Nectar"" Gonzalez Byass, Sanlucar de Barrameda, Spain, NV - $12 Employees Only Prosecco Brut, Zardetto, Veneta, Italy, NV - $12The dessert wine was super sweet, but very alcoholic. It paired super well with the cheese cake and didn't ruin the flavor of it at all. The prosecco was a little strong tasting but still pretty solid. I was impressed they had their own brand. Oh and before I forget! The decor is super old timey while still being up to date and trendy. The bar is way too over crowded and the dining area is small, but you won't even mind due to the wonderful service, knowledgeable staff, and great food and drink. All they need is another bathroom :p I would have taken pics but it was super low light and I didn't want to seem obnoxious/immature  (we were the youngest people in there by like ten years lol)",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

The bar is dim and cozy, while the small dining area is opened up by their sky light ceiling. It has a greenhouse quality to it. We ordered the Bone Marrow Poppers and the Lamb Chops with Salsa Verde. Bone marrow is of course always delicious, and the lamb chops were very well prepared.

The fraise sauvage was fruit-forward and sweet while the amelía was a bit punchier and acidic.Noise levels were moderate, so the ambiance is good for catching up with a friend or getting drinks on a date.

It was a pretty busy night but somehow my friend and I managed to get a table and our server was super nice and quick with our orders. I had a Penicillin and the drink was super flavorful and had a good kick of ginger. We also decided to eat the Parmesan fries with garlic aioli and they were addicting (there's nothing better than a crispy French fry). The bill was a bit expensive, but that's probably assumed when going here. Highly recommend for a fun night out, overall great experience.

Our bride to be had this place top of her list and deservedly so! We had some late night bites here and everything was so delicious! We enjoyed a grilled cheese and fries as well as the pastrami croquettes. The croquettes were DIVINE. While we dined, we had some great craft cocktails as well. Once we were done eating, we stayed in the bar area and sang our little hearts out. My only complaints here are that the bar is INSANELY crowded and the music was SUPER depressing at the end of the night. I have never felt so claustrophobic before. I seriously doubt they're in fire code with how many people are crammed in here. While this place is open late, they do a lot to get you to leave before the closing time- namely play THE most depressing music right before closing. That's ultimately why we called it quits.

We arrived at 9:30 pm and there was already a line. Normally, I take that to be a good sign. It's early in the night and there's a line out the door. This place must be good. The wait was about half an hour before we got in. The decor is nice and I love the ambiance, but it was WAY overcrowded. This is what ruined my experience overall. Someone is always bumping into you, I was worried about spilling my drink the whole time. It's also impossible to get drinks at the bar and I thought their cocktails were overrated. I got the Provencal and my husband got the Billionaire Cocktail. Mine was a lavender infused cocktail. I normally like lavender, but it's usually more subtle. It was very prominent in the drink and it muddled the other flavors. I ended up giving it to my friend to chug because I couldn't have more than 5 sips. My husband didn't like his cocktail either.Overall, I had high hopes, but my idea of a fun night doesn't consist of constantly bumping into people because there's no space in the bar.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

I found the scene inside to be a little ""too cool for school."" But, if that's the environment you like then you would probably really enjoy this place. The man at the front door was very friendly as was our waitress, but bartenders, cocktail servers and coat check all provided the vibe that they didn't really have time for me or anyone in my party.I came here with a large party of 9 people. Between the group of us, we ordered almost everything on the menu. I was happy to be able to try so many different foods. This menu is definitely geared toward the adventurous eater. Our appetizers included everything from oysters to bone marrow to a good old charcuterie and cheese board. I thought everything tasted delicious, even the foods I don't normally eat (bone marrow!). For an entree I ordered the squid ink, octopus risotto. I am such a sucker for risotto and octopus is one of my new favorite dishes so I did really enjoy this! The squid ink flavor is quite strong, stronger than I was expecting. But again, this was a fun and adventurous meal. I wouldn't want to eat here on the regular but I enjoyed it for a fun, ladies night out. The cocktails were INCREDIBLE, as I would expect from a speakeasy. I was a big fan of the ""besos"" tequila drink. Our table ordered tons of different cocktails and we were so pleased with all of them. Some other favorites were the strawberry prosecco cocktail and the one that had a dark elderberry syrup in it. Our waitress was so lovely.

The outside is very unassuming with barely any signs, so it almost reminded me of a speakeasy. I started my drinks with a ginger smash and while I thought it was good, I thought it was a bit overhyped. The Billionaire Cocktail and Quiet Storm tasted much better. For food, we ordered the prix fixe menu (gnocchi, steak tartar, charcuterie for appetizers) but we each had our choice of the main entree. I went with the pork chop and I started to regret my decision once I saw my coworker's gigantic rib eye being served. However, once I tasted my pork chop and compared it to his rib eye then I knew I made the right choice. The ribeye was cooked perfectly, but did not have much flavor to it compared to the pork chop. I barely had room for dessert, but the heart knows what it really wants. I tasted a few items, but the one that stood out was the butterscotch cheesecake (which I completely devoured).",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"
38,mOOP1V-_-Hpd500q8gOoJw,Nikolette F.,5.0 star rating,"My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate his 21st birthday and we waited to do so for a very long time. We were initially supposed to go over a year ago, but were denied at the door for not being 21. We went back a second time with the impression that we could go in if it was early enough in the day (miscommunication with the host) but we were again denied. Frustration was an under statement but we swore that if we ever got in that it better be some of the best damn food we'd ever had.... and you know what? It was fantastic! I couldn't have l picked a better place to spend such an important occasion with the one that I love.  For appetizers we ordered: Ricotta Gnocchi with Butternut Squash, Balsamico, Brown Butter & Pepitas - $14& Cheese Plate with Lavash, Herbs, & Honeyed Pistachios - $ 23 We were informed that the Gnocchi was home made and it tasted exactly like that. There were a lot of ingredients but it came together in a very subtle way and ultimately was flavorful but not over powering.  We got the cheese plate because that's been a thing of mine recently. All of the cheeses were imported and fresh. The honeyed pistachios were a beautiful and creative pairing. I actually want to add that to some of my own plates moving forward. The olive oil included went well as well. My only complaint would have to be that the lavash served with it shouldn't have been the only type of bread/cracker. I would have liked something with a crunch or more flavor. In addition there were these powdered nuts? They were nuts with something on them and they didn't bring much to the plate except for redundancy. I'd suggest maybe dry fruit, regular fruit, or a chutney?  Either way it was all pretty impressive and worth the price. For entrées: Skate Paprikás with Spaetzle & Crème Fraiche - $26&Roasted Half Chicken with Celery Root, Broccolini& Heirloom Cherry Tomato - $27 I had the Skate and I hadn't even heard of it until I looked it up at the table. Kudos to them for being so  exotic sincerely. I can't compare it to much, but it was really really good. The sauce was great too and packed a big punch which I like for a main course. I just wish it came with a vegetable and less sauce. A little truly does go a long way with that much flavor. I really can't complain. I can't say a much about the chicken, but I got a thumbs up from him. In addition his Broccolini was sooo good. I wanted some of my own. They offered sides as an item on the menu, but I don't think it's fair to pay for a entree and only get a protein. For dessert: Butterscotch & Mascarpone Cheesecake with Sea Salt & Nut Brittle - $10All I can say is wow. I have never cut into a piece of cake that smooth and soft. The people next to us made the exact same expression when they cut into theirs. It tasted even better than it looked and that's saying something. I really liked the nut brittle and sea salt combination too along with the cake. It created and sour and sweet sort of dialogue.Finally Drinks: Pedro Ximenez, ""Nectar"" Gonzalez Byass, Sanlucar de Barrameda, Spain, NV - $12 Employees Only Prosecco Brut, Zardetto, Veneta, Italy, NV - $12The dessert wine was super sweet, but very alcoholic. It paired super well with the cheese cake and didn't ruin the flavor of it at all. The prosecco was a little strong tasting but still pretty solid. I was impressed they had their own brand. Oh and before I forget! The decor is super old timey while still being up to date and trendy. The bar is way too over crowded and the dining area is small, but you won't even mind due to the wonderful service, knowledgeable staff, and great food and drink.

The bar is dim and cozy, while the small dining area is opened up by their sky light ceiling. It has a greenhouse quality to it. We ordered the Bone Marrow Poppers and the Lamb Chops with Salsa Verde. Bone marrow is of course always delicious, and the lamb chops were very well prepared.

Listen to the specials of the day as they are usually all good - last weekend we had the rabbit pate, yummers. The 20 oz rib eye steak is definitely for sharing and is juicy and fatty - could have used a bit less garlic on top. You can easily check out the table next to you since the dining area is really tiny (max about 12 tables?) and the two chickies next to us opted for more humane dishes unlike me and my bf, like the steak tartar (made at the table) and some green salad stuff.

The Ready Fire Aim cocktail shot me straight in the heart with its recipe of divine intervention: Del Maguey Vida Mezcal, fresh lime juice, house-made honey-pineapple syrup, and dashes of Bittermens Hellfire Bitters. Speechless? More like breathless. If a volcano had a taste, it would be this drink. Apparently volcanos are delicious.If the cocktails at Employees Only are works of art than Employees Only itself is a museum, but in this scenario the artists are there in-person for patrons to praise and bless, a ritual rarely experienced when taking in the work of a master.

We grabbed a small table in the back under a beautiful sky light. The rest of the place has a dark ambience, but it sets the tone perfectly. We ordered an Almost there, and a Fraise Sauvage. The Fraise was mildly sweet and refreshing and the almost there was a strong drink served nice and tall filled with ice. Both drinks were amazing. Since we were bar hopping, we just ordered small plates. The bone marrow poppers, spicy shrimp, and lamb lollipops. They were delicious. We dreamed about them all night. The wait staff were all attentive, clearing plates, filling water glasses, asking if we needed anything. I was truly amazed. I don't have one bad thing to say. This place deserves every star it has been given and then some. We also had Common sense and At first blush. Another set of great drinks.

My favorite part of EO is the art/magic that the bartenders create. It is a true performance to watch them create their drinks, and I was sitting there mesmerized, I forgot to order a drink! The bartenders have such a finasse, it makes sense they have to go through a long ""apprenticeship"" before being promoted to bartender. Several of the bartenders also have the EO key tatooted on their arms ( I mean, there's not much better then that right?)!  They had great personality, perfected skills, and made a profession that is typically looked down upon, into an inspiring artistry.The decor is dark, loungey, romantic, with a small seating area with great natural lighting above it and lots of candlelights.  The bathroom is very small, but has fun, inappropriate decor, which gave the bar a little bit more personality.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

I am new to exploring the upper echelon of the cocktail scene in NYC but that doesn't mean I don't know a quality cocktail when I see (and taste) one. My boyfriend and I stopped in fairly early on Saturday evening (sometime between 5:30-6, I believe) and we had to wait about 5 minutes to go inside. The bar area wasn't too packed. I had the 'Amelia' cocktail which was a deep violet color from the blueberries and garnished with mint, I believe it was.. gin based? I was already a few drinks deep so my memory is a bit foggy. It was a delicious drink and beautiful. My boyfriend tried the 'Stardust', which was a mezcal based drink that was smokey tasting and topped with a thick egg white foam. This drink was truly exceptional. If you don't like smokiness or the taste of mezcal, you'd be wise not to order it, but we both enjoy those attributes. He said this was a drink he was going to remember for a while. I hope we can come back here soon and try more drinks and possibly some food next time. I was too busy chatting with a group of girls to watch the bartenders at work so next time I'll have to pay better attention as I love to watch serious mixologists at work.

The bartender noticed us immediately and was quick to give us menus. I looked over their impressive list and asked a couple people what they'd ordered at the bar. Some lady had a Pisco Sour, It took a while for me to decide what to order. I chose the Ready, Fire, Aim- a mezcal cocktail with pineapple, honey, and some ""hellfire bitters""... perhaps this made my drink subtly spicy. It was delicious and well balanced, I would have had a few rounds if we had had time to stay.My boyfriend can be a bit dull when it comes to drink ordering, so he ordered his usual- a Manhattan. The bartender made his drink very quickly, which initially impressed me. But he sipped his drink and made a face. I took a sip to see what was wrong; it was an overly sweet, not-very cold Manhattan. We asked the bartender what was in it and he walked away. When he came back he said ""Grand Marnier, that's what makes it unique"" kind of with an attitude.This place is a hyped up cocktail bar for a reason. Their cocktails are amazing, the space is classy, and the bartenders are good at what they do. I'm just a little shocked that such a classic drink fell so flat. And I guess when you go out somewhere in the city that's so hyped up, you're going to find a little attitude from the staff, like they know better than you.

He shoved some menus at my girlfriend this Friday. We knew what we wanted, so she returned them and asked to order. He didn't like that. You could tell right away--we interfered with his normal process for taking orders. That's all it took for him to decide to use his petty power as a bartender to give us a hard time. We ordered a Woodford Reserve. He asked me three times if I wanted bourbon or rye. Three times, with increasing volume, I told him bourbon. The place isn't that loud. Clearly, by the third time he was just fucking with me. That inference was made clear when he said, pejoratively, ""You got it Boss."" Then he served me up a Cancun-quick pour over ice that looked like it had been pulled out of your Dad's cooler. When my brother ordered a martini, this dude stared him down while he shook it next to his head in some deranged display of aggression. There were other things--it was a bizarre encounter. Hey, boss, go see a man about a dog. You're a bartender. I ask you to make me a drink in return for money. (A stupid amount of money, $15-20 for these half-ass cocktails).

I wish I could describe to you why the taste of it fell so flat, but I'm still trying to decipher it myself. It was intensely bland. Too many herbs, and somehow absolutely no flavour. If I had closed my eyes, a part of me wondered if I'd even be able to understand *what* I was eating if I hadn't specially ordered it by name.So that sucked. They serve it without the egg, so maybe that was it? No, I don't know. It was just mystifying.

I absolutely loved it! All the bartenders looked so professional yet suave and made possibly the best cocktails I've ever had. Starting with the Billionaire cocktail ($16), AMAZING. That drink is so strong yet you won't even know it. Having not eaten earlier, I had already started buzzing from half the drink! But it is delicious and so well made I wouldn't complain to drinking that all night. I got the Ginger Smash ($16) next. Also, delicious. Not the biggest fan of ginger, but it was still really good! And like I keep saying this, very well made. There are many little ginger pieces in the drink. The steak tartare was amazing. A handsome waiter came by and mixed it up for us, adding in several ingredients into the tartare (unfortunately, I don't remember them all :( ). There was an egg yolk on top, onto which he added shallots, and 3 other spices I guess you could call it? You pair that off with these very crispy thin toasted (maybe sourdough?) bread slices and wow, the combination just takes you away. There are so many flavors incorporated into this. They also provide a side greens salad as well. They also brought dark brown bread and the soft butter that came with it was SO GOOD. I think there was lemon in it? I can't quite remember, but it's definitely not just butter. This speakeasy has every alcohol you can name. The bar is the more commonly used area, can probably fit around 15-20 people? There are two tables/booths on the opposite side of the bar where my friend and I sat. Each could probably fit about 4 people? There is also seating outside of the bar, where there is brighter lighting. I didn't get to take a look at it when we went. They offer cocktails that are separated into 3 categories, an EO cocktail, and 2 others.

I also got an Old Fashioned, which was equally as great as the first 2 cocktails. We sat at the bar for a bit and the bartenders were friendly and attentive.

Yet nothing was stated at the front of the bar about a restricted ""Industry night"" and at least a dozen people were let in with no confirmation of Industry Night. Finally as we were waiting and taking photos of the entry of your bar, a 3rd doorman came out and physically shoved me out of the entryway and threw my phone to the ground. I wonder why this bouncer had to be so antagonistic to 3 people trying patiently to enter the bar. Part of me wonders if it had something to do with us being all 3 Indian while many Caucasian people entered the bar while we were waiting.

The place is a pretty big for a speakeasy, but we were a party of 16, so we still took up about half the back room. NOTE: there's only one bathroom for the place - but there are 'rumors' that if you ask the staff, when faced with a long line, they may let you use a staff bathroom. First - the table bread is served with a cream spread that's friggin delicious.As we were a big party, we had a prix fix menu.  For appetizers, we had the charcuterie, the arugula and asparagus salad, and the ricotta gnocchi - served family style.The charcuterie had smoked/cured Italian-style meats, chicken liver pate, and homemade focaccia.  The chicken liver was incredible, and the spicy cured sausage went quickly - though we could reorder as needed.The ricotta gnocchi had a pea pesto/lemon and pistachio garnish. Toasted and delicious.The arugula/asparagus salad was nice, light palette cleanser when not gorging on the other apps.For my main, I ordered the roasted chicken, which was fine, and the skin was seasoned nicely, but I wish it was a bit crisper. Still fine though, light and flavorful.  I tried someone's cavatelli with house sausage, which was really good and the porn chops looked pretty impressive.For desserts, again served family style, we had the dark chocolate pot de creme, the butterscotch mascarpone cheesecake, and assorted sorbet.  The pot de creme packed some really intense chocolate flavor, and was creamy and delectable. The star, however, was the cheesecake. Light, but still a decently firm texture...just fantastic. Didn't try the sorbets...too busy with the pot de creme and cheesecake haha.For drinks, I had the Manhattan, Common Sense, and Yankee Notion.  The Manhattan was a little sweet for my liking, but was still very tasty.  For my, the common sense was the winner, as it was a bit drier than the Manhattan. Great stuff.  The Yankee Notion was also a fine drink, but again...for me, it was about the Common Sense.The service in the place was prompt and polite.  No complains whatsoever. Great food; great drinks...wish there was a bit more thought put into the whole bar that has one bathroom situation, but otherwise, great place.

It comes with a generous amount of dill and is dressed in a refreshing poppyseed yogurt sauce that's pure crack. Gnocchi appetizer with morels was comforting and lovingly prepared. It was so delicious, I wanted more of this and wished the portion was a little bit bigger. Cavatelli with pork sausage in tomato sauce is a hearty entree choice and perfect for those cold winter nights. Cheese plate appetizer is also a great choice to end a meal with. It comes with three different kinds of cheese, pistachios in honey, walnuts, and soft flatbread.

The servers here are all really nice, and the cocktails were excellent. We ordered the bone marrow poppers to start, and these were phenomenal. They were perfect small bites and were exploding in flavor! Everyone seriously needs to try these. We also got the ricotta gnocchi to share, and these were probably the best gnocchi I've ever had. The oyster mushroom sauce paired SO perfectly and I only wish the portions were bigger.The Tagliatelle with butternut squash was our main entree, and again the mushroom sauce x pasta combo was done perfectly with this dish. Our side of Brussels sprouts with bacon was also delicious and were gone in less than 3 minutes. For dessert, I HIGHLY recommend the Butterscotch & Mascarpone Cheesecake with Sea Salt & Nut Brittle.

My friend Mac and I had been thinking of going to Employees Only, the secret bar/restaurant for years and years. What better time than now!Spoilers on a Secret Restaurant ahead!As you all know by now, NYC was taken over by all these fancy secret bars in the past half decade. Some of them are so popular that you might not even realize it's supposed to be a secret. Beauty and Essex is definitely one such place.I digress.Employees Only is on a stretch of land called Hudson Ave. which was always too far west for me to care about or venture to. So imagine my surprise when I discovered the restaurant was hidden there. Mac and I knew that there would be a bouncer denying entry if you either didn't look the part (hello, tourists in white sneakers and fannypacks) or if you didn't have some sort of reservation. They're also pretty strict on seating, you must be ordering dinner if you book a table. When we finally walked in it was a bit of a let down, there's a psychic table immediately in front of you to keep up with the idea that they place is only a Psychic business. Then immediately to your right, you want into what looks like it could've been a tiny clothing store at one point but was now a dimly lit (not very impressive) bar. It was also really confusing to figure out who we speak to once we walk in to be seated. There were several people waiting for a seat and the hostess was on her phone or something who knows. All I know is that we were two seconds from walking out when she finally got to us.I had made a reservation with the full knowledge that we'd have to eat dinner - she tried to sit us in a tiny corner but we preferred to sit you know - where all the other dinner guests were.After we were seated, the server came over to us...eventually. I was really in a sour mood. Not to mention the couples to our left and to our right. One was on their first date - so that conversation was obnoxious. The other table had these really loud seemingly teenagers talking at the top of their voices.Then the food arrived and ok, fine, it was probably the most delicious handmade pasta I've had in a very long time. And isn't that the point really? That the food is good?I left knowing I will never go back or recommend the place to anyone, but I had a great time catching up with an old friend and some wildly delicious pasta",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

I'd recommend all three with my favorite being the octopus. The octopus came with a celery salad which had too much root and earthy flavor for my liking, but the octopus was well grilled; it was tender and juicy.The lamb chops were slightly overcooked for my liking; they were served medium though I would have preferred medium-rare or rare. The lamb chops came with a fantastic chimichuri sauce. I would have eaten that sauce on almost anything. The bacon wrapped around the lamb added crispiness and even more savoriness. The roasted beet salad included freshly roasted beets as opposed to pickled beets. It was a tasteful surprise to have fresh beets and carrots rather than the pickled ones I was expected.

I suggest the Fraise Sauvage, Ginger Smash, or the West Side. Dinner, best cheese plate in the city, cheeses are a chef selection of hard, medium, and soft. It's served with candied walnuts, olive oil, and pistachios in honey. After that we ordered the steak tartar which is literally mixed right in front of you with raw egg, shallots, capers, sea salt, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. They ask before mixing if you want mild, medium, or spicy. We opted for medium. It was ah-maxing! My friend ordered the skate and love it. For desert we ordered another round of drinks and made our way to the bar. If you are not going to order a specialty cocktail everything from this bar is great because the limes I had in my vodka soda were the juiciest in the city which made my simple drink perfect!

The place has a speak easy feel with some serious bartenders who will make you legit cocktails. the drinks are a bit pricey but they are definitely worth it. My boyfriend took forever to come (he was biking from uptown all the way down, anyway) so I had a few.

It's considered one of the best bars in the world and you don't need me to convince you to go. So let me make this easier for you and get right down to it. DrinksMata Hari -- This is the award-winning one. Once you taste it, you'll know why. Not too sweet and you can taste the alcohol, but there's no burning or unpleasantness, its sheer enjoyment. Manhattan - EO is known to pride itself on its unique Manhattan recipe. It's different but it's well done. However, this isn't for the faint hearted, aka me. I'd probably die if I drank a whole one of these. Billionaire Cocktail- this is a good medium, it's not too girly and not too manly. This is what I'd imagine a billion bucks to taste like. Ginger Mash - if you typically like ginger-based drinks, you'll like this. If you typically hate ginger-based drinks, you'll hate it. Appetizers Bone Marrow Poppers -- liked the bite size take on bone marrow. It's a must for bone marrow lovers--but not anything too wow. Steak Tartare - YES you can't go wrong. It's made at the table, and there's some aspect of customization in terms of flavor (spicy? Salty? More worchestshire?)Ricotta Gnocchi -- did you even doubt this? It's soft, pillowy, and deceptively simple with a hint of lemon. Not only did I want more, but I wanted to take some home to use it as a pillow it was so soft. Octopus - My favorite appetizer. I can't even remember the flavors because it was so distracted by how tender it was. That's a good sign. Oysters -- fresh, but I found mine were little sandy. Plus they didn't serve cocktail sauce--what the what? EntreesRib Eye -- it's true what they say. It's awesome and it's a must. Dash it with some sea salt, and skip the lemon wedge. Plus, the potato gratin?? Let's just say we ordered an extra one, it was so good. Monkfish - this is on the smaller side, but for a tiny fish, it's pack full of flavor. If you're a fish lover, you'll enjoy this one. Orecchiette with Spicy Pork Sausage, Tomato, & Arugula -- I really enjoyed this one, even though it was so simple, it was the execution. Perfect al dente, light sauce, and chunks of sausage. Arugula - tasty salad, I barely got a bite of this because the other half of my party destroyed it. But I take that as a good sign. SidesPotato gratin -- screw your no-carb diet, this is so good I think they baked crack into it. Kale -I'm not a kale lover, but I dig this side! It was soft, flavorful, and light. Black eyed peas - against kale and potato gratin, it may have been an unfair comparison, but this side did not stand out to me in the least. DessertCheesecake -- This is one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had, and I'm confident you'll think so too. It holds the consistency of Panna cotta, but drizzled with a toasty butterscotch, this will elevate your cheesecake standards. This dish is such a MUST, we ordered two. One right after the finished the first one. Who even does that?Brownie - it resembles chocolate mousse in its shapelessness, but a brownie in heaviness. Good for chocolate lovers, but I would pass on this again. Apple yogurt -- a good balance, not too sweet and not overly indulgent like the others. Sorbet - lemon basil and prickly pear sorbets were great but I highly recommend the prickly pear. It was refreshing and full of flavor!",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

I have been a bartender for over 10 years and never in my time of going to any establishment I felt the way I feel right now. I have never wrote a yelp review ""pulling the race card"" but this series of events was unprofessional and was so totally disrespectful and only way I can understand why this happened was because of my color of my skin. I walked up to the bar and waited for over 20 mins for a drink, which is fine for me. I saw that they were busy and I waited patiently for my drinks for me and my friends. The first thing that struck me as weird was the fact that the bartender was passing me to serve other ppl. I'm a bartender and as a bartender you can tell when another bartender is purposely ignoring you.The hispanic bartender with the black shirt and lettering was the rude bartender. Totally and completely rude. I have two of my friends from the UK visiting and wanted to show them a great time so I ask to what kind of tequila do they have and he said ""I don't know, don Julio."" In frustration, I ask him so what other ""better"" tequilas do you have. Then he response in the most rude voice ""patron"". Didn't give me a menu nor a sense a welcoming. Feeling uneasy from my experience at the bar I go the service station to ask for a manager, a person by the name of ""Kimmy"" came to me and claimed to be the manager. The reason why I use the Phrase ""claim to be"" is because the way she treated me she SHOULD NOT BE A MANAGER!!!! She literally said "" hurry up and spit it out"" as I tried to explain my issue. I asked her for the name of the rude bartender to include in this review she refused to give it to me which I thought was very unprofessional. No one should be treated like this. I get it, I'm the only black person you've seen all day and you think I'm not going to tip so you treat me like shit.

They take reservations not only for dinner but for bar seats as well so if you're not ""on the list"" you may have no chance snaggin' a table. I had made a reservation so I had no problem walking in.The wine list is great and reasonably priced so we did grab a bottle of Sauvignon Cabernet which was good. Now on to the food:Apps:The bone marrow poppers I actually did not like at all. Reminiscent of a pastry with  bone marrow on top. Definitely not a fan.The arugula salad was very good. Fresh, with the perfect amount of flavor, it was magnificent.Entree:Of course being the steak lover that  I am I had to order the rib eye. The steak was extremely juicy but worth $62??? I don't think so!!! Don't get me wrong the steak was good but not worth the value. I've had other steaks around the city that Ive enjoyed with a price point of $28-$48 so to me $62 never again. Although the steak was HUGE there was a lot of fat, and yes I know rib eye is fatty but still I don't eat the fatty part so a lot of it went to waste. The only side with the steak is the potato gratin, which by the way is amazing!  And although amazing its a very small portion! I also had a taste of the black sea bass which was good but again a very small piece of fish.All in all is this place good, YES. Is the service good, YES! The bit of hassle to get in and the prices of this place  don't match up.  The ambiance  is nice but at the same time casual and I don't find to be that exclusive.

It's a very popular kinda hidden place that everyone seems to be at. I ordered my normal old fashioned (great by the way) and I wanted to always try this poppers. First of all, I love bone marrow. If it's on the menu, I order them. These peppers were so good. You get three per order, and I wish it was ten. The pastry is cooked perfectly and it literally melts in your mouth.

Also, not one of those places where the bouncer makes people have long lines but then you come in and there's no one there. (WHY DO PEOPLE DO THIS?) Anyway so it was pretty packed and would definitely like to come back and have a reservation because I'm sute sitting down is a much more enjoyable experience. The space is quite small but not terribly so. If you don't mind standing - and I don't think you can mind if you come here - it's pretty nice and well lit, speakeasy decor and vibes. Also, great music! Does seem a bit touristy but the bartenders are pretty great and attentive. Don't think anyone has to wait too long to get attended to. Drinks are wonderful. I got the Hemingway and The Ginger Snap and preferred the former; though the latter is good had a bit of a bite, I wasn't prepared for. Saw some people getting food here so I imagine if you're not dining in, the food's worth a try. Does seem like a place where people come to see and be seen but eh, won't hold that against anyone.

I got the Amelia (apparently a popular choice because 2 other ladies had the same drink) and my bf got a really strong gin cocktail. Both were really good (but mine was tastier, he kept stealing it).

Bar and it was annoying women walk by with their bags practically knocking food and cups off our table. They stand with their asses in your face. zero Fks given if you're eating. Food- we had few starters the bone marrow puffs we're amazing but you get 3 little ones so yea . I had the rib eye and it was SUPERB. There was enough to feed 3 people, so much. The mashed potatoes were delicious too. Fresh jalapeños nice touch. The desserts were great I had the chocolate pudding or whatever it was, legit it was good. Walked away impressed as this place is known for their drinks I guess... Drinks- so we had a variety and tried each other's and wow they were very good. I can't remember the nameOf the one I liked most I had this SMOKEY flavor, I think it was called ready stand fire or something,  could be wrong but that one was legit too. To the people that say their drinks are underrated like, wtf is your problem? What more do you want from a 16$ cocktail? Everyone at our table was impressed.

I walked away disappointed. Let's start with the rude bouncer at the door. It was a week night, early dinner (around 7), yet there was a bouncer stationed outside the door interrogating me about every single detail of my reservation (which I had, by the way). Is this really necessary? It's a restaurant/bar, not the meatpacking.I finally make it inside, wait for my party to arrive, and order a drink at the bar. The bar area is really, really small. Now I know why the wait is so long! The legal capacity of this place is probably 20 people, and the layout feels like a fire hazard. The drinks I had were fine. But for $16 a pop, I was expecting more inventive and exciting options. A lot of the options on the menu seemed fairly simple. Being a big cocktails and speakeasy fan, I feel like this place just cannot compare to true heavyweights like the Dead Rabbit and the original Milk & Honey. $16 is probably one of the most expensive cocktails at a bar in the city, and I definitely would not choose to come back, wait in line, get harassed by the bouncer, to pay $16 a cocktail here. The dinner we had was surprisingly good. No one really talks about the food at Employees Only, so I was pleasantly surprised.

Their appetizers impressed me beyond comprehension, I wish I was able to try their entrées, but wasn't hungry enough for a big dish at that time.

When I arrived to the door I immediate got snooty vibes (saying it politely) from the woman at the door. I told her the name of my friend who was inside and she goes 'oh they've been waiting for you' (maybe she was trying to be friendly but it came across as anything but). I go inside and the bar is packed and there are small tables with people eating dinner directly next to it. I'm walking by and my butt is just about grazing people's steaks.

But I do wish it was a little bigger or had a couple more pieces. It came with three Tiny bite sizes. Then, we did get the steak that was $68. You can definitely split among 2 people as we did. I did steal all the potatoes bc they were super tasty ! And for dessert we got the butterscotch cheesecake. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS. By far the best part of the meal from my end. Soooo good !!!! Our waitress was nice but the person who made this 4 star up to 5 star was Kim or you might know her as the girl with the hat. She came up to us when we were done with our meal and got to know us and overall just made us feel so welcomed. I felt silly bc my boyfriend told she was grabbing us shots and it was more of a drink you sip and it helps your food digest. And here I am drinking it as a shot and I see Kim just sipping it LOL. I felt silly but she was great. Thank you for making it a superb experience :-)",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

Sometimes we just want a nice dinner without all the 'tude!Had to try the poppers after all the buzz and they were great, but not the star. The star of the night was surprisingly the Steak Tartare.

There's slightly dancy music so you see some people casually busting out some moves but it seems that most people are sitting at tables or by the bar. We ordered the Thunder in Paradise and the Maserati. Both were high quality cocktails. The former was very sweet and tropical. The latter was more tart and packed slightly more of a punch. I'm not sure if the mixology here beats out some of the other cocktail bars I've been too, but I definitely really liked the drinks. Together with the ambience, I'm a fan of this place.

On my recent visit to the big city I had the opportunity to finally come. My best friend and I got there at about 10pm and there was a line out the door. The first bouncer told us and everyone else it would be a 40 minute wait because they had reached capacity already. I think this was just a ploy to get us to leave but I decided to stick around for a few min. Within 5 minutes the other bouncer let us in and we were lucky enough to find a seat at the bar, which was nuts because it was insanely packed. We were quickly approached by the principal bartender and he handed us a couple of menus. I ordered the Yankee notion and it was delicious, not too sweet and chilled just right. We stuck around about an hour and then we were on our way. I'm a bartender, so it's always cool to watch other bartenders in action and mix up all the different cocktails, especially at the #1 cocktail bar in the world.

Husband and I came here for our weekly date night and we left very impressed. First, the drinks were on point. Husband got the Stardust & I got the Quiet Storm. I'm a huge fan of Dark & Stormy's and anything with Ginger Beer and wow, this drink was SO good. I had to slow myself down and not drink it too quickly cuz it was SO good. Husband loved his drink too! Unique flavours and good range of cocktails & wines.For food, we ordered the Bone Marrow Poppers, the Seared Steak & a side of the Tuscan Kale. The bone marrow poppers were VERY good. Different take on bone marrow but we loved it. Highly recommend. The waitress was sweet and told us that there was only one steak left in the kitchen so we ordered it immediately. Unfortunately, the steak came quite rare when we had requested medium rare. Since it was so dark in the restaurant and we were starving, we dug straight into the steak... a few bites in, I noticed that it was quite rare. Upon closer inspection (aka, moved the candle closer to the meat and squinted my eyes), it was actually VERY rare. Husband was too hungry to care but agreed it was quite bloody. By this point, we already ate 1/3 of the steak so us being us, we shrugged and said ""Ehhh, let's just continue eating"". Out of NOWHERE, the waitress appeared and said ""I noticed that the steak was quite rare. Do you want me to send it back to the kitchen and cook it more?"" Um. wow. We were SO impressed cuz we didn't say anything to her prior AND we didn't even know she was nearby! We sheepishly said ""Yes please"" and she took it back. It came out perfectly cooked a few minutes later :) Woohoo! By the time we finished the steak, we were SO full so we had to pass on dessert but next time!!! Apparently the cheesecake is quite good *according to our neighbours sitting next to us*Overall, loved the ambience & service & the drinks. The food was good too but it wasn't the best part of the meal (more the drinks & service that made the experience!) Funny too, when we walked out of the restaurant to grab the uber, the same waitress ran after us, holding a brown takeout bag, and yelled at us to stop cuz she thought we left our food. Husband corrected her so it was a funny incident but we both said in the car that even though it was a mistake, it was amazing she ran out on the street to give us (not our) leftover food.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

It's on the list of bars  that are purposely hidden from plain sight in order to wow you when you walk in, which is exactly what happened with me. However, once you find it, you're in for a great experience.After walking by a few times, I finally entered into a door with a psychic sign on the window. As you walk by the sign, you will see some curtains which when walked though, will reveal a very low key and cool bar. I got here while there were some seats at the bar, so I sat right down and proceeded to talk it up with the bartender. I told him that I like rum and would drink any concoction he put together. Well... He put together some deliciousness that caused me to order 3 more and leave the bar walking a little less than normal... One of the best rum drinks I've ever had. It was something with ginger and topped off with champagne. Absolutely delicious.The place itself is low key and laid back, but not overly so. I wouldn't go as far as to call this a speakeasy vibe however. There are some tables in the back for dining and the crowd is everyone from the after work crowd to regular people walking in. Things picked up after a while and got a little more crowded, but nothing crazy at all.I would put this place in the category of a really cool bar with awesome drinks and a great atmosphere. Doesn't compare to Raines Law Room in my opinion, but it's also a different kind of place that is much less formal.

While I prefer whiskey drinks I'm usually not a huge fan of the Manhattan since it could be quite strong. However, I was told that EO is the place in New York to get the drink, so I had to try it - and I'm glad I did! It was strangely smooth, still strong but nice to sip on.The bartenders all seemed really friendly, and put on a show as they made the drinks. They're attentive, and got each customer sitting at the bar a glass of water before they asked.Overall, I'd highly recommend this bar for anyone looking for a cool place to hang out in West Village. Also would be a cute place for a date.The reasons for not giving it 5 stars - (1) limited restrooms (only 2 in total), (2) drinks on the pricier side, (3) my friend got the Amelia and while she enjoyed the drink while having it, didn't sit well with her after.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

Though calling it a speakeasy at this point is a bit of a stretch--yes, it's disguised as a psychic's lair and there is in fact a psychic sitting in the entrance (I haven't actually tested her ""credibility"", though) but any place with a bouncer out front isn't exactly secret. That said, the cocktails here are certainly speakeasy-grade.Came here on a Friday night around 11 and was not at all surprised to hear it was packed. You should always account for some wait time here if you want to come on a weekend. The bouncer told us that there was no room at the bar, and we'd need to wait for his boss to come out to see if we could get in anytime soon. After insistently telling him that I had called ahead multiple times (not a lie, I promise) and was told we'd have no problem getting in (it was worth a try), we were eventually able to get in pretty quickly. It helped that I was with my sister, who happens to be a bartender. There's a mutual respect between people in the service industry. Anyway, once we got in, we were somewhat shocked. I've been to Employees Only a number of times, and this was actually the emptiest I had seen it. Sure, there weren't any vacant bar seats, but ""packed"" was quite an exaggeration. Not that I'm complaining. And actually, bar seats opened up pretty soon after we ordered our drinks--sweet deal. This was especially exciting for my sister, because watching the masters at work behind the bar at a cocktail joint like this is really special.For my first drink, I ordered the Maserati (Fords Gin & Fresh Basil Shaken with Homemade Chamomile Cordial, Schonauer Apple Liqueur & Fresh Lemon Juice, Served Over Ice). This is pretty much my perfect cocktail. Herbaceous and gin-based with some subtle fruitiness. Just divine. I'd recommend this to just about anyone. Even if you don't love gin...I just can't imagine not loving this drink. One more recommendation: if you're feeling adventurous, give the bartender some freedom. I love doing this at speakeasies--these guys aren't just bartenders, they're mixologists. Let them get a little creative. For my second drink, I told the mixologist that I was ambivalent but wanted something similar to the Maserati. He just said ""I've got something for you"" and that was that. And ""that"" was damn good.Just a note about the general vibe here: this place is trendy, bright and LOUD. Different than a lot of other speakeasies in the city. This is one of the few that I wouldn't call intimate. If you're looking for a speakeasy with some more energy, this is your place.

The bar is great for groups -- both in terms of seating and being able to try everyone's different cocktails :) The bar manages to be both lively yet intimate, with excitement flowing throughout the room yet the ability to focus on your group and have a great conversation. As I mentioned, the drinks were outstanding. I highly recommend going out of your comfort zone and picking a cocktail make with a liquor or ingredient that you wouldn't typically order. I was surprised and delighted with every drink. In addition to amazing cocktails, EO has a great menu. You have to try the bone marrow -- it is savory and deeply satisfying. Outstanding. The steak tartare is made table side to your preferences, spicy or not spicy, etc. The pork came in a giant portion and the orecchiette with sweet sausage tasted exactly like an Italian grandmother made it. The ricotta cheesecake with caramel sauce was sinful. It is so light and sweet, and the caramel sauce gives it an almost-burnt depth.

I've lived around the corner for a few years and have gone there for drinks and/or food on  pretty much every occasion I can think of and always had great service and a great time. Vibe: it depends on the day/time but overall pretty 'trendy' (I don't like the word either but you know what I mean, it's a nice place).Peak rush hours: it gets pretty packed on T, Th, and  The Weekend. If you're going on those days prepare to wait for a bit unless you're a Starboy/girl or are going w/ a regular. Door policy: look good, be a normal polite human being, and be patient. The guys at the door are probably NY's finest professionals in the industry. They usually have the people in line engaged in conversation or laughing their lungs out. Dress code: I'd dress 'nice'. That can mean everything from a suit (some people will be wearing these) to a leather jacket (other people will be wearing these). People: generally cool/attractive crowd. The people are different during the week and on the weekend and especially on Sunday nights. People are generally very friendly so don't freak out if random people offer to randomly buy you drinks or start taking to you. This usually ends up being extremely fun (I was once on a date next to a couple and all 4 of us ended up sharing dinner and drinks at the end of the night) but if it's not your cup of tea just politely decline and everyone will leave you be.Ok now on to the suggestions:1) Service* This place is by far my favorite establishment in NY and the drinks are food are fantastic. HOWEVER, the best quality of Eo is its amazing service. The staff loves what they do and it shows. - check out the Eo tattoos on the staff. They are that committed to staying the best and proportionally committed to ensuring you have a good time. 2) Drinks* If you like Japanese whiskey this is your kind of place (Yamazaki, Hakushu, Hibiki, Nikka.. they're all here)* If you want a drink the Ginger Smash (dark n' stormy-ish) Lazy Lover (cachaça + spicy/sweet: killer) and the Besos Calientes (this is spicy and has grapefruit - fun fact: it means hot kisses in Spanish haha)3) Food* I've never had a drink or meal here that is short of spectacular but if you're limited to trying only one thing, do yourself a favor and get THE steak tartare. It is in my opinion the best in the city.*Other suggestions - Seared Ribeye- Bacon wrapped lamb chops- Bone marrow poppers - Rainbow trout4) Important: When you're out way later than you should and pizza won't cut it, head over for the late night menu. It's spectacular regardless of your BAC at the time.* Suggestions- Everything I mentioned above except the rib eye and the trout (those aren't on the late night menu)- The dry aged burger- Parmesan fries w/ truffle aioli- Reuben croquettes w/ Kat'z Deli pastrami- Spicy rock shrimp  - The Staff Meal, which is what the staff are for dinner. This changes daily and can be a delicious novelty",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

Maybe I just don't get it.But why bother dealing with the restrictions and attitude that come attendant with a place like this? We'll start with the door, manned by two bouncers and a maître d'. They'll demand a reservation, and treat a walk-in like someone who has beamed down from another planet. It's bad enough that you have to wait until all hours of the night to eat here, but at 11:45, I don't want to be hassled about not planning in advance. We're told a table in available - in a tone that implies that this is some sort of miracle - but then have to make it through the bouncer. My two Canadian friends are given a through cross-examination by the bouncer. When they don't have a passport - only a Canadian license, which is perfectly valid in the States, we are dubiously told by the bouncer that not only is this not O.K., but ""After September 11, having an ID is required. Otherwise it's a $10,000 fine."" The maître d' also relates an almost certainly apocryphal story about someone spending a night in jail for not having identification.These are lies, and very strange ones, too. Of course, we're eventually let in and lead through a twisting, over-crowded lounge to a table that would struggle to serve as a two-top. I'm literally sitting on top of my sister, while my Canadian friends squeeze into tiny tables.It's dark, loud and uncomfortable as we shout our drink orders. A fancy cocktail arrives soon after, strong but otherwise unmemorable. The late night menu, the whole reason why we waited so long to come here, is unavailable. We're stuck with the more upscale regular fare. The skate feels Hungarian (quite the contradiction) with its mounds of paprika contrasted with the very German Spaetzle. Along with the bone marrow poppers that arrive early, it's Continental fare served as a reasonable amount of panache. It's also far too heavy to be eaten at midnight.By the time my friends poke at an apple dessert, I'm exhausted. It's well after 1 and I'm ready for home.

This was very inconvenient because has anyone knows coordinating dinner can be difficult.  The only times she offered me were either an hour and a half before or an hour and a half after my originally confirmed reservation. Nobody wants to eat dinner at 7 o'clock  and nobody wants to eat dinner at 10  on a Friday night. They are obviously unprofessional I need a better trained staff.

Terrific cocktail list here, but as always, just tell the mixologists what you are hankering for.

Definitely worth the hype and a must visit for anyone in New York. We got a reservation for dinner here on a Friday night. The food, drinks, ambience and service were all excellent! The drinks are outstanding, there's a reason this is voted one of the best cocktail bars in the world. We got the mata hari, the billionaire cocktail and the Manhattan. All of them were delicious and strong, perfectly balanced and great to drink. For appetizers we got the ricotta gnocchi and the bone marrow poppers. The gnocchi were pillowy soft and tasty with a great basil sauce. Bone marrow poppers -  you have to get these. Smoky sweet bone marrow on top of a flaky pastry base. No wonder they're a crowd favorite! For the main course we got the pork chop which was cooked to perfection, and the cavatelli with sausage, which was packed a punch and was full of flavor. For dessert we got the butterscotch cheesecake,which had a nice creamy texture but the sauce was a bit too sweet.The service here was excellent, the maitre 'd was polite and nice and our server was helpful and attentive as well.

Vintage photos adorn the walls and along with Prohibition Era jazz, give the space a very cool, retro feel that doesn't seem contrived.Sat at the bar and had some cocktails with work colleagues. The Billionaire, a combination of Bourbon, absinthe, simple syrup and lemon juice is fantastic. My companions both ordered Maseratis, made with gin, muddled basil and simple syrup and reported that these were also outstanding. I was able to personally confirm this later in the evening when I had a few myself. After being seated we opted to go with all small plates so we could try as much as possible. We ordered oysters, bone marrow poppers, steak tartar, lamb chops, charcuterie and cheese.All were quite amazing with the bone marrow poppers being among the best, rich, decadent and satisfying little bites of marrow, wrapped in bacon and place over a puff pastry shell.The steak tartar was without a doubt the best one I have had in sometime, possibly ever, as I order this menu option every time I see it and have enjoyed it from Europe and across the States. The mince was the perfect size and the accompaniments were all in the exact proportions to enhance the flavor of the beef and not overpower it with superfluous seasonings.

It's all about the ambiance.We had such a fun time here last weekend, sitting at the Bar, where we were served by Dev.

I, on the other hand, had been to EO once before... years ago... because let's be honest, I don't like the West Village. Not my cup o' tea. BUT We had just finished a two hour trapeze school course nearby (in 90 degree weather), where we were parched, sore, exhausted... and needed to kill time before our dinner reservations. So, I convinced spouse to try it out. (For reference, our *fave* cocktail joints are Freeman's in LES and Dick & Jane's in Ft. Greene, BK). EO proved that they stand out due to their service and quality. The bartender was full of zest, pizzazz and know-how and he was KIND (he also kindly slipped us some Fernet to settle our upset stomachs after our jumps). We ordered the Maserati, Almost There, Something with the word Caliente, the Waterloo? (the muddled watermelon cocktail) and Ready Fire Aim. Sounds like a lot, huh? Well, it was a slow and steady onset... the cocktails were not completely strong. But they were top notch, with pure mixologist flare (and we were glad that they were not the same potency as Freeman's or our night would have ended too soon).

I thought I was just getting a cocktail! - The place is majorly crowded. Crowd leans more towards pretentious and Murray Hill (when here I thought I was in the West Village...) - When I buy a cocktail Im not really trying to stand around and balance everything.

272,Od7O06u9tJEmJQICNUBUcg,Megan P.,4.0 star rating,"I feel like the East Village and Brooklyn has its claim to fame of speakeasies and famous cocktail bars, but Employee's Only should also be a contender. Located in the West Village, it's a happening spot so get there right when it opens if you don't want to stand all night. There is no secret password- you just need to know the entrance and the symbol above the door. Inside you'll find a full bar with bottles of homemade cordials, lesser known brands, and the typical liquors. Seating is available at the bar, smaller tables behind it, or in a separate room. I was seated at the bar and presented with a menu of tempting food and drink options. My friend took the liberty of ordering me a cobbler (drink...not the dessert!) to start off with, which is a bit sweet for my palate but consistent with the drink itself. The bartenders are dressed in long white coats, similar to a pharmacist, and know the drinks on their menu well. That being said, I tried to order ""bartender's choice"" and was always given drinks on the menu so it isn't the best place for experimental drinks. The cocktails run about $16 each- no surprise there, but something to be aware of. I tried the Malena, a rich, garnet drink made with rye, campari, port and orange blossom water and the Provencal, a refreshing concoction of gin and herbs de Provence infused vermouth. My friend and I also ordered the Brussels sprouts (bacon on the side for veg heads like myself) and the cheese plate. The petite Brussels sprouts were deliciously crispy and filled with flavor. A must if you like Brussels! The cheese board had a brie, mild blue cheese, and is served along with honeyed pistachios, lavash, candied walnuts, and a spray of parsley for aesthetics. Being a cheese board lover- this was very well done. The pairing of nutty blue cheese and sweet, sugary walnuts is a combination not to be missed! All in all, a truly enjoyable experience. I highly recommend stopping by Employee's Only on the weekend for a candlelit evening of craft cocktails and delicious food.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

A cocktail bar should be judged on 2 qualities: 1) quality and ability to ""craft"" a cocktail, and 2) intimacy of space. Employees only won the best bar in NY award a couple of years ago, but now they just make cocktails off of a list instead of crafting them. Additionally, this bar is such a scene. There is loud club music playing, and people are yelling and dancing.It feels much more like Meatpacking than West Village.

Can't go wrong with a speakeasy vibe and great food. I started with the Fraise Sauvage cocktail. Gin is my go to liquor. It tasted like a strawberry slushy. The back dining area is rather small, no more than 10-12 tables. There were two large parties on each side of us so if you were on a date.. good luck. You weren't going to hear anything. The seating in the back room seemed best for tables parties with less than four people because it could get very packed. Dinner: I went to the venison (Venison Chop with Heirloom Carrots, Farro & Kale $41). I haven't had venison in years, my bestfriend's dad hunted and when I visited I'd always have. My friends thought my meal was the hit at the table. The meat was so soft and juicy. I loved the sauce that dressed the meal. I tried the marrow poppers ($11), its acquired for some but I usually have had it served with an onion jam.  My friends also ordered the Skate ($25) and the  Orecchiette with Spicy Pork Sausage, Tomato, & Arugula ($19). I cant  comment on the Skate because I don't care for cooked fish. The Orecchiette looked good too but I didn't try it.

Both were delicious but one thing I didn't like was getting bits of ginger stuck in the straw or in my teeth - reminded me of pulp in oj. My bf also had a Manhattan and a quiet storm and he liked those as well. Prices were a bit high. We're from Boston and we're used to paying $10-12 for cocktails. These were $16 each.

The bone marrow apparently was heated, but it was cold and had a strange texture that did not appeal to either of our taste buds. The appetizer also is very small. We loved everything else. My whole grilled trout was generous and delicious, and my guest had a salad that also was beautiful and generous.

We were accommodated so nicely by the staff at the door and the waitstaff. The door staff actually was super helpful and even when we thought our party was too large to be able to comfortably stay in the crowded bar, they brought us to a table to fit the party, which was beyond nice and the cocktails were delicious. However... One of the ladies in our group had a baby about 3 months ago and she is still going through the breastfeeding phase of post birth. She was growing in discomfort and had to relieve herself of the pressure that builds up if she doesn't pump. Eventually I asked an employee where the restrooms were so she could relieve the discomfort, I was guided downstairs to a bathroom adjacent to the kitchen.  Unfortunately, because of my friends situation we did take a while in the bathroom. While we were in the ""one-person bathroom"" the door was being knocked on and I kindly told them we'd be out as soon as possible. As we were in there for a bit longer, someone keep repeatedly and rudely screaming ""too much cocaine"" into the restroom. When we had enough of the harassment and my friend had relieved as much as she could to be comfortable for the rest of the evening, we exited the bathroom to be meet by the HEAD CHEF. He aggressive yelled at us that this is a one person bathroom for his kitchen staff only. When I confronted him regarding the experience,  that his staff upstairs guided us to this restroom and tried to explain calmly what our situation was, he did not only continue to harass us, he also continued to mock my post birth friend saying she ""shouldn't have a baby in a bar"" which, of course we did not have her 3 month old child with us... she was just trying to enjoy her first evening out on the town after her boy was born. After I had enough arguing with the chef about how poorly he handled the situation and how horribly disgusted we were with the fact that he accused us of doing cocaine in his bathroom, we continued to leave. As we left the establishment, I complained heavily to one of the staff members upstairs who apologized profusely, as well as the door staff who was equally appalled.

My favorite entree is the seared rib-eye, but again, at $45, might as well go to a steakhouse.As for the drinks, you really can't go wrong. The cocktails really are the star of the show here. The bartenders have always been superb with the actual mixing, and they don't cut corners. I'm a big fan of bourbon, which is why I like the Quiet Storm, which is bourbon, ginger beer, vermouth, and lemon juice. Not too shabby.

He told us about the Sunday night burlesque show, which seems interesting enough to come back and see. We got there right at midnight and waited outside for about 10 minutes before we were led in. However, when we got in, we still had to wait a bit because the people at our table were lingering. It was better than waiting outside in the cold I guess. We were given a menu and I had my heart set on a cocktail, which I believe was called Mediterra and had crushed figs in it. I tried ordering it with the waitress and she told me that they actually didn't have that cocktail available that night. Just as she was saying this, another waiter came over and took the menu out of our hands and gave us a new one. Low and behold, the new menu did not have the cocktail on it. I decided to settle for a drink that others have said was good, the Amelia. The Amelia was very fruity and did not taste like it had alcohol in it at all. I also tried the bone marrow poppers, which were very delicious. I really loved the puffed pastry with the bone marrow. By around 1, it was much less crowded and there were a lot of tables available.

I very much respect the mixology here - but when i ordered a simple manhattan on the rocks, I was given a whiskey drink that involved grand marinier. While that is a perfectly good spirit, it's not a manhattan. The bartender proceeded to argue with me and gave me a follow up subpar drink.

Also lovely friendly server.Cons: The food was overpriced (which was expected) and just bland. None of the flavours really came through at all. We had the gnocchi and lamb chop to start, followed by chicken and pork chop. At best it was fine. Edible but pretty tasteless and boring. The wine by the glass was also very poor, to the point that my husband sent his back (which they did deal with quickly and remove from the bill to be fair). They really pack you in and the whole thing is just so not worth it. Especially when you contrast that with Beauty and Essex who have got it so right on all counts a number of times for me.

315,6uwMOedz0adZFEQdeR-wuA,Laura O.,4.0 star rating,"I've had three days to mull it over and I still can't believe I'm saying this: I'm recommending Employees Only primarily for the food, not the drinks.Two friends and I had plans to meet here on Saturday night at 8:30. Risky move, but I had read on their website that reservations were only to be made for dinner. So I was surprised when my friend, who had arrived first, called me to say that reservations were necessary for everything that night and no one without them could get in. Luckily, somehow she was able to not only get us a spot at the bar by the time I arrived, but she also managed to get us a table (at the bar area) by agreeing to possibly order some food. It's pretty easy to find the place, as long as you're on the right block. It'll be the restaurant with 30 people waiting outside. The vibe inside wasn't quite what I was expecting. I guess I thought EO would be a little more laid back, but it was pretty packed and noisy. Personally, I do think I prefer the chiller vibe at some of the other cocktail spots like Raines, Attaboy, and Little Branch.We started off with a round of drinks: one friend had some gin-based drink, another had the fraise savage, and I ordered a Manhattan (""Rittenhouse Rye Stirred with Italian Vermouth, Grand Marnier & Dashes of Angostura Bitters""), as I had heard it was THE place in New York to have one. So the drink came, I took a sip, and... it was SUPER vermouth-y. Like, way too much vermouth for a Manhattan. It didn't taste bad -- but it didn't really taste like a Manhattan should taste, either. I sort of grappled with this all night. Did the bartender just mess up? The place was so crowded, maybe he was hurrying and screwed up the ratios? Did our waitress tell him to make mine sweeter because she thought I somehow looked like I wouldn't like a spirit-forward beverage? I realize that maybe I sound like a crazy person now, but I was still thinking about it the next day, so I did some research, and... EO's Manhattan's DO have different ratios. On purpose. Apparently, they model theirs after the original Manhattan, which did have more vermouth than whiskey. So there you have it. If I had known it at the time, I might've enjoyed the drink more, rather than being befuddled the whole time. Next, I ordered a Pisco Sour (BarSol Pisco Shaken with Fresh Lime Juice & a Raw Egg White). It was good... maybe also a little on the sweeter side.The food, however... my god. I first had the bone marrow poppers. A little salty, but amazing. Tried a bite of my friend's butterscotch & mascarpone cheesecake (with sea salt and nut brittle). Holy ****. Quite possibly the best cheesecake I've ever had. I usually don't make repeat visits to restaurants in New York, as there's always something new to try, but I'm seriously considering returning here and it's because of the cheesecake. Even a random side (potato gratin) was nearly mind-blowing. I had some of my friend's, and she allowed me to finish it. I'm truly blessed. I do have to say I appreciate the discretion at Employees Only. I think our waitress thought our friend was pretty drunk (in reality, I think she was somewhat drunk, which was combined with a super bubbly personality), because an entire jug of water just somehow appeared on our table. Thanks, I think. I do think she probably saved us a hangover.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

The guy at the front did a good job at keeping track of people, and in the end, the manager gave us a free round of drinks since we had to wait so long, which was pretty nice.The place has good music (90s hip hop - Biggie, TLC, etc), and it's packed inside.  The drinks were really good, and Ready Fire Aim was my favorite.  It was super well balanced and had a nice kick to it.

My husband and I came in on a Saturday night while in town from Denver and really found it to be one of the highlights of our 4-day trip. Being what some might consider ""cocktail enthusiasts"", we can appreciate a creative, unique cocktail just as much as a perfected classic. This place has both. Fortunately we arrived before the 6pm opening, so we were two of the first in and able to snag two spots at the center of the bar.From the very beginning, our bartender Steve took wonderful care of us. I was amazed to watch how quickly they pushed out drinks, while still maintaining quality, to a bar that filled up easily within 20 minutes. The bar was shorthanded in the beginning, but pushed through and seemed to keep everyone's glasses full relatively quickly. Once some additional help arrived and everyone seemed to have their first round, Steve was able to chat a bit and crafted some unique and delicious drinks off-menu just based on a short list of the flavors we each liked. Each drink was perfectly balanced and I have to say, Steve made me the best Hemingway Daiquiri that I have had yet!Having visited many different high-end cocktail establishments over the last few years, including some greats in NYC and Chicago, I can firmly say that Employees Only rises to the top 2-3 on that list.  Its a bar that is the perfect combination of great drinks, great service and an upbeat vibe.

The bar itself is long and narrow and though it's crowded, there doesn't seem to be a place to put anyone who is just standing around. If you're lucky enough to get a seat (I saw reserved signs on tables at 1am!) then covet that seat, hold your bladder, and guard if with your life! There's lots of space for standing room and that's about all you'll get if you don't plan ahead. Almost like a nightclub, people will squeeze past you all night and you're lucky if you can find a place to put your drink. And I know I'm not making this sound awesome but it truly is great.

340,u0FAHtoWDbT3Ex7yFK01YA,Ina L.,5.0 star rating,"Employees Only has been on my must-try list for months, and I finally went with a couple of girlfriends. First off, there are no store fronts so don't expect a fancy entrance with beautiful type font that reads EMPLOYEES ONLY. The restaurant and lounge is hidden behind a taro card reader shop, but it'll probably be easier to locate the big bouncer standing in front of the taro card reader shop. #Spotblown. The bouncer is very meticulous about who he lets in, and probably won't let you in unless you have dinner reservations or if the bar isn't already full. If you're hoping to get in after 10PM on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday evening, chances are you will be waiting outside for a while. Make sure you are dressed to impress, it'll shorten your wait time. Luckily for us, we had a 8:30PM dinner reservation. So we were able to get in without hassle. But, our table wasn't ready... They expected the party before us would finish dinner and leave by 8:30 but the party decided to linger around and enjoy another round of drinks. We did not give management a hard time, since I imagine it's difficult to accurately calculate turnover rates. But the manager, who looked oddly like Ryan Reynolds, noticing that we still hadn't been seated, offered to buy us a round of drinks. We took it gladly and mingled with a very good looking bunch of young men and women. It's very crowded by the bar since 2/3 of the people are sitting at the bar, eating, and the other 1/3 are hovering over the bar to get a drink. The dining area is not too far into the restaurant, but the layout and narrow space makes Employees Only feel like a lounge, more than anything. We were seated at 9:15PM and were surrounded by couples, groups of girls catching up over good food and drinks, and even a group of men celebrating a bachelor's party. It's loud enough to gossip and laugh, and sexy and intimate enough to take a date. And to top it all off, the food is phenomenal. PHENOMENAL. We wanted to try as many things as we possibly could, so we got one order of the 1) half-shelled oysters, 2) the gnocchi appetizer, 3) the bacon-wrapped lamb chops, 4) braised octopus appetizer, 5) bone marrow poppers, and a 6) seared rib-eye with potato gratin. We were just three girls and we devoured every plate.1) The half-shelled oysters. Fresh and a great start to a great meal to come. 2) Gnocchi appetizer are small bite-size pieces full with ricotta. The dough was perfectly a la dente, served with a tangy brown sauce, a stem or two of asparagus, and slices of shitake mushrooms. I could have finished this portion of gnocchi in two bites, not only because it was delicious but also because the portion size was itty bitty. But I left a few pieces for my two girlfriends, since sharing IS caring... 3) I usually do not like lamb and I pick it out. But this one was delectably wrapped in a crispy piece of bacon, and it wasn't gamey in the slightest bit! I thought I was chewing on a fatty piece of pork, actually. I would recommend ordering this particular appetizer according to your party size since one order comes with one chop. 4) The braised octopus was not chewy, and had the slightest hint of fennel and herbs. It was a very neutral dish that went very well with our heavier appetizers. Not my favorite, since I was expecting more flavor but all of you pulpo lovers- this is the one for you. 5) THE BONE MARROW POPPERS. HEART HEART HEART. One heart for each popper. Each order comes with three pieces so please order according to your party size. I honestly could have had all three to myself. Each bite size is a flaky pastry baked with bone marrow filling. It melts in your mouth (not in your hands)!!!! For those of you who may not be familiar with bone marrow meat, it tastes just like pork but more tender. And it is usually roasted for hours in a broth of shallots, sugar, and sea salt. I usually prefer my bone marrow to taste like barbecue ribs or pulled pork, and most of the time, they do whether it's served in the bone or on top of toast. Unless of course, they are used to make soup. 6) The seared rib-eye was the only entree we ordered and it was a huge piece of meat, let me tell you, that came with the most buttery potato gratin ever. It was the perfect finale. The steak was cooked flawlessly, and the meat was so tender. They cut it for you, so it's very easy to share. We did not have an appetite for dessert but the manager, the one who looks like Ryan Reynolds, as aforementioned, was sweet enough to send us over a few shots.

It's not because of the appeal of finding an unmarked bar, except for a single neon pink ""Psychic"" sign on the window.It's not how the bone marrow poppers made me go ""MMM!!!"" with its flaky crust, filled with soft, fatty marrow flavored with aged balsamic vinegar. It's not because of the Provencale with its lavender infused Plymouth gin and Herbs de Provence infused vermouth and Cointreau.  The floral notes will tickle your nose and the taste will make you swoon, provided,  you love lavender as much as I do!It's not even how well balanced they pulled off a Manhattan made with Rittenhouse Rye, Italian vermouth and Grand Marnier.  Oh, I had quite a moment! Me? Having a Manhattan IN Manhattan? Scandalous! ;) Do you know why this place is crowded? SIZZLING. HOT. BARTENDERS. It was how Urosh, with his dark Serbian looks, held my gaze for a moment too long when he asked me what I wanted to drink.  I had to look down at the cocktail menu for the LONGEST time because I could feel my cheeks getting flushed .... and it wasn't from the 0.4 mile walk from the subway stop! When he delicately placed my Vesper in front of me, he flirtatiously said, ""I don't know how you drink vespers, because I can't."" * was that a twinkle in his eye?? * Damn. he's milking it bad for tips, but shoot, a girl could get used to this!As I tried very hard to look cool and completely ignore him, I could see him moving about behind the bar: handing checks to patrons, mixing more drinks, answering questions, but always with a smile. In fact, the bartenders who were here that night, were all friendly and efficient. The good looking crowd probably helped too. Since I had to be at the airport in 4 hours, I decided to cut it at midnight and pay my bill. I remember taking Fernet shots (who drinks this stuff??) before leaving. After landing in SF, I texted my friend Dave H to let him know I got home safe.  I also said: ""hey, thanks for buying the shots last night. I don't recall paying for that."" Dave's reply: ""haha, I didn't! the bartender did!"" Oh.  My.  Gawd. I'm moving to New York.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

Someone had a birthday, so they slammed on the red fog light and brought out a burlesque dancer to cause a scene and elaborately serenade the birthday man, obviously. This place is alive. The carpaccio was stellar, but I wasn't there for the food. Cocktails were good, like flawless, but also typical. Classic cocktails are classic cocktails, however a Ramos Gin Fizz is an exception; rarely are they done properly. EO surpassed expectations on that one.My experience seemed quintessential.

I want to be friends with this guy forever. Once inside, though, we all realized how overrated this bar is: 1- if you want to have the luxury of sitting down, they expect you to get an entrée, or an app and a salad at least. If not, forget it, you're condemned to stand the entire night. Which wouldn't be a big deal if it weren't for my next point: 2. If you're standing by the bar, be prepared to be pushed and shoved nonstop the entire time, especially by the waiters, because the bar area is cramped. The width is no wider than two people standing shoulder to shoulder. 3. Drinks are WAY overpriced. My Hemingway Daiquiri was finished in 4 sips and cost me a pretty penny. Same for all my friends' cocktails. 4. Bone Marrow Poppers... $11 for 3 teeny bites? Are you serious? I can get an entire steak sandwich and a drink for that much at Num Pang. 5. What is with the lonely psychic sitting at her own table? That space can seat an entire group! No need for her whatsoever. I left Employees Only disappointed, minus $26 over a drink and an app, and wishing I had chosen another bar for my friends and me to go to.

When we managed to get to the address, we saw that there were several other people waiting outside. The inside is small, so I understand they cannot let everyone in. When we got inside, the beauty of the bar struck me.We weren't able to snag any seats at the bar, so we had to awkwardly stand. I say awkwardly because the inside is small - this feeling is amplified by how many people were inside. There is a fire place, which adds certain character to the venue, but if you're too close, you feel like you may melt. For cocktails that are $15-$16, I very much prefer to be able to sit down. The last thing I want is for some girl taking a #selfie to knock into me and spill my drink.I settled on ordering the Blondina, made with Wild Turkey Bourbon, Apple Liqueur, puréed Pears and Fresh Lemon Juice.I did enjoy this cocktail. The glassware made it a bit tricky to handle since we were standing. The thin stem was not very reassuring! The cocktail glasses are personalized for the bar. Night touch.Aish ordered the Provencal, made with Lavender-infused Plymouth Gin stirred with Herbs de Provence-infused French Vermouth and Cointreau. She took a sip and commented: ""I'm drunk.""

Loud dinner since it was Friday night and was seated near bar area.Gnocchi - Absolutely delicious. Perfect consistency, clean, great sauce and slightly sweet. Presentation was exemplary. Perhaps larger portions though.Rainbow Trout - Tasted clean, sweet, utter perfection. Consistency was just the right amount of resistance. Work on presentation though - just a fish on a plate is the pinnacle of laziness in terms of wowing a customer, get it together.Porterhouse Pork Chop - Tasted normal, nothing wowing about it though. Not much to expect from such a normal dish. Ordered medium rare, got medium well - I understand, pork should not be cooked rare for health safety reasons, but the kitchen could have gotten closer to the rare side.

I always depend on well made cocktails to get me through the NY work week and we chose Employees Only as our newest drink off destination. I have been wanting to come here since FOREVER... basically since I got their hard covered cocktail book with special drink recipes to try out at home.. since... I fell in love with the speak easy scene in NYC... and also because this is the sister bar to my favorite bar of all (hehe... both are within walking distance from my apt)! Stefie made reservations for the dining area for 3 with no problems. We made our way to the West Village and our cab let us out just a few feet from the entrance. Typical speakeasy fashion, you cannot tell what lies within Employee's Only- it looks like a Psychic Reading store front when what's hidden inside is really a quaint and dimly lit bar / restaurant. If you're into psychic readings and stuff, there is someone who can do the tarot card thing for you.As the three of us sat in our cozy little candle lit table, we could see that we were sitting under a beautiful sky light. If it wasn't raining, I'm sure it would have been more amazing. We each ordered various things off the menu. We suggest to try: Dinner:-Bone Marrow Poppers- this is a must and it's sad that there are only 3 per plate. -Ricotta Gnocchi, made with Asparagus & shitake mushrooms. This is also small, but very delicious. I also wish there were a few more pieces!- Duck Confit- which is a good sized portion and also very tasty.-Orecchiette- with House-made pork sausage, tomato, arugula & parmesan. This has a nice little kick to it but isn't too spicy. - Tagliatelle- with English Peas, Parmesan, & Fermented Red Chili. Although this was vegetarian, I still enjoyed the consistency of the pasta and the light creamy sauce. Drinks:I stuck with the very amazing, Fraise Sauvage and also tried Bellini with pureed white peaches. Out of the two, I like a more strawberry taste of the Fraise Sauvage and this one was consistently hitting the spot last night. Scott also tried the Pimm's cup which is his new favorite. Overall the ambiance is really nice. I love cozy, sexy little bars. It's a beautiful space and it has a little retro throw back feel to it. The service was friendly and we enjoyed our time here. Our only hesistation is that the food portions are a little on the smaller side. I wouldn't suggest coming to eat here if you are STARVING... even though the food choices are very unique and delicious.

371,o9ooI25bdChExnRlZCYH1A,Leslie D.,5.0 star rating,"In a city where every establishment vies to be the best and everyone is jaded towards anything less than extraordinary, rarely do I find myself truly surprised anymore. My entire experience at Employees Only surpassed everything I expected and more.First off, the bouncer (excuse me, doorman) that evening was one of the friendliest guys working a door I've ever encountered. He needs to be cloned and have his clones distributed throughout Meatpacking District to replace all of the other bouncers and doormen.... for reals.Getting inside only took about 10 minutes on an obviously busy Saturday night and the whole time we were chatting it up with this man. Once inside, the palpable energy was uplifting and all consuming. Talk about an upper! As my eyes darted around the dimly lit interior, I fell in love immediately with the modern art deco feel which I took as a small homage to Prohibition times. True, this bar is not a legit speakeasy but you would probably walk on by if you didn't know any better. There is no sign saying ""Employees Only,"" just its symbol in the shape of a key on the awning plus a neon lit sign in the window saying ""Psychic."" You can usually just spot it by the line outside on an otherwise quiet block.The bar area was unsurprisingly packed. I noticed a small dining room area in the back for those who wished to avoid the livelier scene up front. Hey I'm sure it's more intimate but screw that! Like a highly renowned sushi restaurant, the bar is the place to be. You should want to be up close to smell the action. Watching the bartenders work their magic (and their hard biceps) is the new female aphrodisiac. Move over, oysters!Now I'm not going to lie, trying to get a seat at the bar can be a little bit of a game and dance but the amazing principal bartender signaled to me when a couple was about to leave. I then hovered like a pretty vulture to get the highly coveted seats staring down anyone eying my spot. Don't play the musical chairs game with me because I will win. As Sheldon would say, this is MY spot.For drinks I started off with the Billionaire Cocktail, because let's face it, I'm a balla. This yummy concoction was made with Baker's Bourbon shaken with lemon Juice, EO grenadine & absinthe bitters. My next beverage, which was bartender's choice, had a dash of black pepper on it. Can't remember the name of it but I know bourbon was used. My companions also had a few drinks of their own and thoroughly enjoyed them as well. I might have had a third cocktail but nothing ingested that night was less than delicious. This statement does not only cover the beverages but also the food as well!With great drink comes great responsibility to eat lest you become a mess. I had to have the Bone Marrow Poppers which in a nutshell are flaky little pastries topped off with dollops of fatty bone marrow goodness. So delectable. We also ordered the Braised Octopus with roasted fennel, celery & green olives. Delicious, tender octopus with the perfect flavor. I feel like most places don't get octopus right but EO thoroughly nailed it with Thor's Hammer.Since I'm always craving raw meat, I knew I had to try the Hand-Cut Steak Tartar. Now ladies, we all know when we've had something good and we HAVE to have it again... The steak tartar was no exception. I got it. Twice. Let me see if I can describe this act of culinary foreplay. Bartender brings forth a bowl of diced filet mignon which is so red and juicy looking. Next, he starts pointing out to me various ingredients that will go into the bowl. I'm thinking oh great, I get to mix my own tartar! Nope, wrong. The man mixing my freaking awesome cocktails is also mixing my raw meat in front of me! I think I'm in love. Verdict? It is honestly one of the best tartars I have ever had. No joke.I cannot rave enough about the quality of the bartenders here. Not only does it seem like they are personally attending to you amongst a crowded bar but their obvious dedication and love of their craft is so wonderful to watch. By now it's obvious that I will be coming back for more libations, scintillating conversation (what is it about speakeasies that makes me want to talk about sensual subjects?) and mouthwatering dishes. I have found a new bar obsession and it's mine... Don't bother me.------------------------------------------------Side notes:1. Yes they do have a ""psychic"" there on weekends! For a great deal of $25, Madame whats-her-face will read your palm fortune. I will not discuss the enlightening predictions she bestowed upon me *insert sarcasm here* but let me warn you now that it took a week to scour those damn purple marks off my hand.2. I've heard through the grapevine that the reason it's named Employees Only is because back in the day, it would only admit people who actually worked in bars in NYC... So in essence this place used to open its doors to only other bartenders and bar owners.

The service was intuitive. Flawless. The food was write-home, especially the cheese plate (this was late-night, so we expected the menu to be smaller).

So it was with some skepticism that I found myself at this happenin', hot spot of hipster-centricism ordering a tartare to be prepared at my table. You remember In  October of 2013 New York City became the official steak tartare capital of the world. How could this relatively young upstart compete with the classic tartares crafted with decades of practice and finesse? Well friends and fans, the tartare capital has a new king and his name is Employees Only. Creamy, fresh, textured, spicy, seasoned to perfection.  This is the steak tartare all other tartares want to be when they graduate. New York's formerly highest-rated tartare emporiums are now reduced to gas station convenience stores selling rancid jerky at Alpo prices. Employees Only is the new standard. Their retractable ballpoint pens are retro cool, too.

We were able to listen in on one of the guys' readings, and she talked about life line, love, developments in his future career, etc. I'm not sure if there was a specific time but she didn't seem rushed at all and asked him a couple times at the end if he had any additional questions. They serve a bunch of specialty cocktails here and the vibe of the restaurant and bar area are both pretty cool. We both decided to try the ginger smash despite not really liking ginger (idek) and were pleasantly surprised.

Once they open for the evening there is a security guy out front but he is very friendly.You immediately enter the bar area after you pass the entrance door. The dining area is directly in the back but overall the place is pretty small. But I love the skylight in the dining area because it gives you the feeling that you are dining outdoors in the back yard without the cold air.Our waitress was very friendly and welcoming as was most of the staff. The drinks I must say are very unique, flavorful and blended well. I tried the Vesper and was impressed with the presentation and taste. My friend ordered the Amelia which was on the sweeter side so I would order that next time I visit. For my meal I ordered the bacon wrapped lamb chops along with the Orecchiette and they were both delicious and did not disappoint. The best part was the bacon wrapped lambchops! My friend order the duck confit salad as well as the bacon wrapped lambchops. I was very impressed with the duck confit as well because it was so flavorful and I am not a fan of duck meat!We did order dessert because the description sounded so delicious. For my dessert I ordered the butterscotch/mascarpone cheesecake with sea salt and nut Brittle. My friend ordered the chocolate pudding which was layered with the flavors of hazelnut, caramel and fudge brownie. Both were pure heaven but I like the cheesecake best simply because I am not a great fan of chocolate. I would definitely return in the future but my only complaint would be about the restroom which was only one and it was unisex.

388,0xlaZ6c3ftTyIhKkC-Raig,Daniel B.,4.0 star rating,"*** Summary ***An upscale restaurant and bar with a hint of a speakeasy vibe because it hides itself behind a bit of obfuscatory storefront.  The front half of the space is the bar and the back is reserved for dining.You can make reservations for dining, but not for drinks.  While the drinks-only area isn't much smaller than some of the speakeasies and lounges around, it is still smaller, and it seemed to me like that means it'd be harder to get in here for drinks alone.Which is what happened to us--no room at the bar so we sat in the back and acquiesced to a second dinner.  (A hard life we lead, I know.)  We ended up trying six or seven items from the appetizers and sides menus.  All were good, but maybe overpriced?[1]  Service was good.Drinks were terrific.*** Mostly Useless Anecdotes About the Drinks ***Here's a cognac cocktail anecdote:It's difficult for me to politely describe how terrible I think cognac is.  I think it's toxic stuff, as toxic as the ooze the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were born in.  Put a turtle in a puddle of cognac, and 15 years later you'll maybe get a mutant sommelier.  Point is, I loathe the stuff, but I asked for bartender's choice here at Employees Only, and I gave them no restrictions, and what did I get?  Cognac.  Mixed up primarily with fresh berries.  I was prepared to suffer through something I hated, but was pleasantly surprised by my first sip.  The berry flavor either mellowed or just overwhelmed all the toxic properties of the cognac and made the whole thing surprisingly drinkable.Not bad, not bad.Another cocktail anecdote for you:I ordered The Ginger Smash, a gin+ginger entry on the menu.  I said, ""make it as gingery as you feel is safe,"" but the waitress didn't trust me and brought me something only modestly gingery.  She asked if it was gingery enough, and when I said no, she raised her eyebrows--""huh""--left, and came back a minute later with a fair amount of raw muddled ginger in a tumbler, for me to spoon into my drink to taste.  You could have two takeaways from this story:A) The bartender should've just known how to make what I wanted, and made it.B) I got a load of of raw ginger and it was goddamn delicious.A third anecdote:We got another bartender's choice, and the waitress very proudly presented us with a mezcal and chilli thing.  My tablemate tasted it and said, ""that tastes like the barrel of a gun that's just been fired.""  But I think this may've been a compliment--the drink was pretty tasty, especially if you like mezcal's smokiness.-----[1] Says the guy who keeps paying $16 for cocktails.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

It's the attention to details that were missing and here's why-we ordered the rib eye for rare and when it got to the table it was more like ""bleu"" and what makes it even worse, where we sat were cold and it makes all the fat in the beef congealed.

I've found this place also draws in a lively bunch of friendly folks, which is a huge plus in my opinion. We've never been here and not met some cool friendly people to chat with. As an added treat for those of you needing a little cosmic guidance, the palm reader is usually there at the ready to answer all your questions about life's mysteries or perhaps let you know if that cutie you just met near the bar is actually your soul mate... Seriously though, this is definitely a place to check out at least once and for those of you who are first timers, here are a couple tips:1.  If you're a lightweight like myself, be sure to pace yourself between drinks and ask    for water because those drinks are strong, and they sneak up on you quickly.... I have learned this one the hard way on more than one occasion. 2. Be nice to your bartenders! They like to have fun here and seem to appreciate customers who like to have fun also. 3.

The marrow poppers sounded promising, but as they arrived and we realized we had just paid $13 for 3 little pastries, we felt cheated. The cocktails were good, but at $15-$16, our deliciousness/value meter was pretty much at equilibrium.The only truly amazing thing on the menu was the $45 porterhouse steak, a really good piece of meat that is pretty much being sold at face value.You can keep the prices the same, and increase the value of the experience, or decrease the prices and leave the experience as it is today.

Furthermore, we get inside are seated and our waitress is utterly rude and seemed almost annoyed when we asked for description of our plates. To top of the night on a bad note, not once but twice did a waitress drop drinks on my brothers pants (1st time) and a glass of wine on the floor (2nd time) which ruined his white shoes. Not only did we never hear an apology from anyone only a ""we'll take care of you"" from one of the runners.

Our party of 8 had made a reservation beforehand and were seated in a timely manner. Bone Marrow Poppers: I can see why these are popular.  Buttery marrow surrounded by flaky puff pastry. I believe a standard order comes with 3, but you can add on additional ones a la carte. Smoked Trout Salad:  light and delicious.  The fingerling potatoes are creamy and tender, and the crisp apple cuts into everything nicely.  To be honest, though, the fish reminds me a lot of smoked salmon. If you order the Steak Tartar, someone will come to your table to prepare it for you- a fun experience.  The complimentary bread comes with a tzatziki-like sauce, but a little thicker. A solid spot for a small, intimate (also, expensive) gathering.  I'd say it's better for groups no more than 4. Also, the bar seating seems to be the place to be, as I saw several people having conversations with the bartenders.  My Pimm's Cup was good and strong.  We liked the fact that they had their logo on some of the glassware.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

We didn't make a reservation for dinner because we thought we could just find a couple seats at the bar. But no one would leave! So we found a manager (Evan) to see if we could be seated for dinner and he said he'd put my name on the waiting list. He quoted me 30 min to an hour. Well, 5 minutes later he found me and said they had a cancellation and would seat us right away. So they're definitely on top of their seating game! I ordered the steak tartar, which was wonderfully prepared in front of me. It was delicious! Perfect meal to have right - not heavy but filling enough! My friend ordered the gnocchi and loved it. The drinks were awesome! The server initially told us no changes could be made to drinks and that the bartenders make it their own way. Well, when we were done eating, we paid the check and decided to hang out at the bar for a little while and order another drink there. The server was wrong, the bartenders were totally accommodating and sweet. Def some of the best cocktails I've said (I ordered the Moscow mule).

I knew on this night, both me and my dear wanted a 'happening' place to drink and enjoy the night, it is New York afterall, and there should be a ton of places we could just walk into, but someone decided to do her homework on this one and we came here. I didn't even see the words ""Employees Only"", I only saw in a fashionable font EO on the front of this place. We got to the door, didn't see much except a charming funny bouncer as we ended up chatting with him and he said he couldn't let us in just yet.... until he saw our ID. His name was Robert and he was chatting with my dear and also two more ladies that just happen to want in on the action of this place. You know there is some love of this place when the guy has the EO font logo tattooed to his arm, ok, what are we walking into here? We had some jokes outside, some pictures taken, we were ready now for some drinks!There are no windows that show you the party that is going on inside, it's all covered and like a private club, the feel gets intense before you walk in. As Robert lets you pass to the set of doors wishing you a great time, you come across a fortune teller before you go through the veil covering the main room. You don't need a foturne teller to tell you that your going to have an awesome time in here, so we decided to walk in, and like turning on a tv and seeing a picture, this was a whole uncovered party. The sight of a sea of people cramming this small narrow space trying to get their money down to get another drink was the scene. I was able to at least see right to the bar, and the bartenders there were wearing white coats (sort of like doctors prescribing the right brew to you!) and dishing their magic, playing up to the crowd with their Tom Cruise cocktail tricks, one even posed for me as he saw me snapping up shots of the bar! Now these guys know what is going around, and have total control of the racks and racks of booze that is behind them and to keep the crowd wanting more!It was only 10pm, obviously people who come here like to let loose early, it was hard to get from one place to another, let alone the back wall right to the bar. Somehow my sweetie was able to squeeze her small frame through all the people, get to the bar, and carry some drinks back to the little section I was occupying. She brought back a Mai Tai and something called a Fraise Sauvage. I thought we were just going to take in the crowd and drink with the masses, but my dear had other plans, and that was to try their eats! On the back side of this place there actually are some tables, how you get to those tables is by wanting food, so she found one of the people working here and we got a table for two.This backroom was packed with couples, groups and people all eating.. but also noticing that everyone had a drink not too far from their hands, you are away from the crowd... but you still see them and feel that vibe eminating from it. We ended up ordering more booze (YES!) and a braised octopus salad and bone marrow poppers (whoa, what is that). The menu had a bunch of cool items, like beef tatare, gnocchi, hen, let's just say when I come back to NYC, I'm going to be back to try some other dishes, but let's get to what was devoured. We were given some rye bread to start, with some butter, beside a small candlelight awaiting our next plate. The octopus was nice, bouncy tender, fresh, not overly cooked and rubbery like some cheap ass Japanese restaurant serving something that has been in the fridge a little too long. How can I describe it, like some (it taste like chicken) fresh, just cooked to perfection meat alongside some beautiful greens, lightly sauced, for a little shine. Coming from a dinner already, we were full, but we kept on eating, and then the bone marrow poppers came out. We ordered one extra one, cause the normal dish has only 3 (recommended by the server, nice job!). These things came out, small, circular, pastry like, delicate, pure evil. They were light in weight put packed a punch, from the pastry itself sheilding the caramilized onions on the bottom, to raising the bone marrow like a crown on top, somehow this combination worked and I was already worried about finishing the last one cause I wanted to savour it.This place has some wicked cocktails, with more than 3 shelves worth of excellent booze that these master of mix can work with, they were crafted at perfection. The three we had were tasty in all it's essence, and packed a punch that creeps on you when you least expect it, not for me... but for my dear you could tell it was affecting her.. ahem... walking straight abilities!I wish I entered this place earlier during my trip, and not at the end, so I would be able to go again.

It was smaller than I had expected so it can get pretty crowded. With all the people and the dim lighting I couldn't see too much of the Decor. But it had some old world charm, but that's about it. I gave it 4 stars for two things, the billionaire club drink and the steak tartare.  I'm a scotch and old fashioned type of girl so I, of course, order the drink that is the closest to an old fashioned which was the Billionaire and it was fabulous.  We also got the Maserati, which is a gin based drink, good but it was too sweet for my liking. The steak tartare was probably the best steak tartare I have ever had. They make it table side and to the level of spicy that you prefer. And it was delicious.  The other dish that we ordered was the bone marrow poppers. They were very good, not as heavy or greasy as bone marrow can usually be. The puff pastry and the sauce offset the greasy-ness.  But I still think the steak tartare was the better of the two. The service was great and attentive even though it was very busy (we reserved a bar table, which I would recommend everyone to do) I would keep going back just for the billionaire club and the steak tartare.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

Be nice to the bouncer when he checks your ID, even though you're 40. Get yourself seat(s) at the bar.

441,PuuZ_RII_OKP7XVcNXWOPA,Julio I.,4.0 star rating,"Multiple times. Thursday Night (11pm dinner), Friday Night (6pm dinner reservation)Food: 85%----Charcuterie board - that chicken liver pate was really good, surprisingly.Bone Marrow Poppers - I really wanted to like this dish. It had the elements of a would-be awesome plate, but the bone marrow was masked texturally and flavor-wise by the puff pastry and the garnish on top. I really could not taste the bone marrow that much.Burger with Shoestring fries - basic, good greasy food. Lamb Chops - gamey, meaty, cooked perfectly.Steak Tartare - this is prepped tableside. Again, I wanted to like this dish but I've had better steak tartares where the actual flavor of the meat just exudes from the dish. I think EO's interpretation is still good but depending on what type of spices you're in to, this dish may be playing with a little bit too much aromatics. There's spice, tanginess, slight bitterness, and then gaminess from the meat. Drinks: ----Mata Hari - really good cocktail. Ambre Cognac. Tangy, slightly sweet, with striking aromatics. Ready Fire Aim - Mezcal. Smoky, pineapple flavor cocktail with a kick of habanero bitters. This drink is amazing. (not so for non-mezcal drinkers who feel like drinking mezcal is like eating a cigar). Service: 90%----The front doorman is definitely a lot friendlier and less obnoxious than most doormen at other speakeasy-type places (i.e. Death and Co, Pouring Ribbons). Even if EO has its own following and is quite known, it does not exude elitism. The servers were very friendly and very accommodating. Ambience: 100%----Dark, animated, high noise level but still comfortable, casual to classy. Value: 90%----I haven't tried the all food items, but the steak tartare has definitely garnered some praise so it is a very subjective dish. Reservations I think are only for dinner goers so if you simply want a cocktail, you might have to wait a bit. I would recommend at least trying out their food once, and if you don't fancy the flavor profile, then for sure come back for the cocktails.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

We had dinner ressies nearby so figured we could just start here and grab a few drinks. Had no problems getting in but waited about 5 min before 2 seats at the bar cleared. Note: there were other bar seat vultures as well, we just got lucky that the 2 we were standing near opened up! If you want to make sure you get seats, I would suggest coming a little earlier...the place was pretty crowded by 7 even on a Sunday.We started with the bacon wrapped lambchop apps - it's 2 lambchops so 1 for each of us. Loved the chimichurri (?) sauce underneath. I find lamb in general too gamey but this was tasty. It wasn't enough so we ordered the steak tartare as well. Again, I'm not a huge fan of this dish generally but it was GOOD. they mix it right in front of you and give you a stack of bread crisps to eat it on.

Found 1 seat at the bar and my friends stood (it would have been two had it not been for the pushy lady-but that's another story). The drinks are really creative.

Steak Tartare- The best tartare that you can possibly find at crack hours of going out!  Even better they come to your table and prepare it for you, which is AWESOME for a late night bar!  There's an option if you even want to make it spicy or not.  This is my favorite dish here!3. Truffle Fries- Truffle? What more can I say!I guess it depends on the night and time that you come to Employees Only.  I have been here where it is overly crowded and you have barely any room to even walk, which sucks.  But most of the time, I just request for a table and it hasn't been a problem.  It is way better to grab a table and enjoy your drinks there instead of standing amongst all the tall people.  I feel like EO isn't QUITE a speakeasy other than the mysterious EO sign at the door but it is so crowded that I feel like it is more of a lounge than anything.  It is definitely intimate in the seating area with high ceilings.  The staff are awesome and very catering.  I ordered the millionaire drink which was whiskey based and I loved it.  It did the trick.  Prices are your standard speakeasy drinks at around $15-$19 even, not a surprise to me anymore.DEFINITE recomment for late night munchies and drinks!  It's just too bad all the good stuff is so far away from the UES!",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

Thankfully, I didn't have to wait too long outside since it was freezing. I was promptly seated and assisted by a waitress. I ordered my favorite cocktail, the Bellini which I did not like. I was now disappointed and wasn't sure what else to order. Since I've had and know how to make most of their classics I tried some of their newer less familiar cocktails. I ordered two rounds of the Besos Caliente made with tequila grapefruit and lime. It was just the right about of spice! I then capped the night with a sweeter cocktail made with cachaca called the lazy lover. It was very sweet although it was made with jalapeño infused chartreuse and Benedictine, I thought these two ingredients would take the sweetness out of the cocktail but it did not. I also tried the Maserati, which was recommended by the waitress. She didn't seem as informative about the cocktails as I had hoped. Later in the evening I had met the principal bartender, Steve, outside the only bathroom in the establishment. I introduced myself and he invited me to the bar area to do a shot. I made my way there before I left to do a shot of Fernet Branca, the bartenders hello. Overall it was a very sexy place with great prohibition style ambiance.

Personally, I would never wait in the line that is usually outside, so this time my friend and I took a different approach. We went early at 7:30pm on a Saturday. The bouncer, unlike most, was really friendly and there was no line, so we walked in and got a seat rather quickly. Thank you to the friendly couple that got up and offered us their seat. The cocktails and the bartenders lived up to the hype. We had the Luscious Lover (something like that), and it was delish! Then two drinks in we asked the bartender to do something with jalepeno tequila and he created a fabulous drink. You have to appreciate a bartender that knows what he is doing. The service was pleasant, much more pleasant than assumed when you think of a swanky speakeasy in NYC. Service does truly make everything better. Loved this place and the atmosphere.

The beautiful steak tartar was brought to the table and mixed live with the level of spices asked for. The gratin was oozy, hot and crusted with a Parmesan topping.

Even more impressive was when I asked the bartender for a glass of water and he poured it with flair.  Bravo, sir.The crowd:  A bit older than what I'm used to.  The crowning moment was when a 70+ year old man did a magic trick for me and produced some red lacy panties.  Um....that's cute, I guess?  Other than providing me with a good story to tell my friends, no more of that please.Needs:  An underground dance floor.  I could see that some of the attendees were really itching to put those alcohol induced dance moves to good use and so was I!  If they had a small dance floor, I think I would have stayed longer.Definitely down to check this place out again.  I heard the food is great too!",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

The problem I had with several was they were either too sweet or too acidic. I think this may be a matter of preference, but in any case everything was OKAY. The look of the place was pretty cool - had a nice Gatsby vibe. One really annoying thing is the place is relatively large but has only one bathroom stall for both men and women.

And when you try to bring it up, he can't give you a straight answer. Maybe he doesn't know either.He's got some really quirky bits (a tarot card reader? really?) and he can be too noisy & messy (EO is definitely not a speakeasy, also quite crowded even on a weeknight). But he's got some positive points too. He is drop-dead gorgeous (hellooo principal bartender), and he knows just how to make your heart a-flutter. (What a mean, smokey penicillin! Second to Sam Ross' of Attaboy's, of course.) When he wants to sweep you off your feet, he might charm you with the Blondina with Maker's Mark Bourbon, Berentzen Apple Liqueur, pureed pears, and lemon juice (strong, but tastefully sweetened by the apple liqueur), but when he wants to show you his sensitive side, he'll concoct the Mata Hari with cognac and chai-infused vermouth and pomegranate.I'm not fond of his bipolar personality (boisterous bar environment in front vs. quieter restaurant space in back), but if I could choose... well, I guess I can't. You can't pass up watching the bartenders make drinks at the bar, but at the expense of shouting at the person buying your drink or being elbowed by people around you. (Do RSVP the tables in the back if you plan to order food though.)He is still a mystery. You see, we're still figuring out where we stand. But for now, his charm (well-prepared cocktails) is enough to draw me back.Bottom Line: Mixed feelings about EO.

This was our second visit and we pretty much followed the same orders as before (may sound boring, I know!). It was 3 of us and we shared few starters: Bacon wrapped Lamb Chops with Salsa Verde was my choice and it is amazingly good. This was followed by Bone Marrow Poppers with Pastry Shell & Bordelaise which once again great but not as amazing as lamb chops (personal preference). We also had Hand-Cut Steak Tartar with Crostini & Mixed Greens Salad which I love. The fact that they do it so nicely and make it in front of you adds to the experience. For main dish we had Seared Rib-Eye with Potato Gratin (medium rare). This is enough for two people. My wife loves potato gratin so I didn't have much of that but tried a bit and as usual it is a delight. The steak itself is wonderful and I love the touch of fresh chili and salt on the side. It means I can adjust the salt and spice whilst eating. Overall fantastic experience. We had couple of cocktails at $16 each which in my view is pricey but I really went for the food. Desert was also great: we shared Butterscotch & Mascarpone Cheesecake with Sea Salt & Nut Brittle and Chocolate Pudding with Hazelnuts, Caramel & Fudge Brownie. Simply amazing and vote went for cheesecake on our table.  Overall bill with tip and everything came to just under $200 for 3 people.

Went on a Thursday night, the bouncer was very nice and welcoming at the door, but once we got in it felt like an average nyc popular bar, standing room only. The cocktails are delicious and balanced, and I watched as one principal bartender tried my cocktail before serving it, decided it was lacking something, added more of something and then served it, so they're legit. I respect this place, it's staff, the way things are run here, but the average clientele sort of takes something away from the place. Lots of immature, loud young professionals and those chippy girls that tend to get sloppy on the bathroom line. Luckily a cool regular told me about the restroom downstairs so I didn't have to suffer the long loud line that I was on for too long.

They do cocktails right here!Space is dark and cramped with couples dancing around in the free space and groups eating and drinking at the tables. Crowd was somewhat dodgy bridge and tunnel and music was old top 40s. That was a bummer. Wouldn't want to hang out here all night but a good spot to grab a well made drink as part of a night out. When leaving there was a crowd of 35-40 outside waiting to get in. Bouncer was being polite and letting people know as space opened they would let people in.

The food and cocktails were great. I wouldn't call it a comfortable restaurant, however, and can't imagine coming back frequently.First and foremost, the Vesper cocktail was great. This is one of the great classic drinks and they nail it. Also had the Royal Charter. It had too much anise for my taste, but other than that preference it was well constructed. Cocktails were also well portioned. They have a good wine list as well, with some surprisingly affordable options for both glasses and bottles. One complaint here was the glassware. It wasn't particularly nice, one of the cocktail glasses had water spots on it and all the wine came in the same generic glass that wasn't suited to the type of wine.The food was similar to the cocktails: spot on and well portioned. The steak tartare was very good, and came with the perfect amount of toast. Bonus points for it being prepared table side and for the waitress asking the preferred spice level. Charcuterie had quite a number of nice items on it and went over well. For entrees, both the chicken and the skate we very good. The one complaint here was the descriptions on the menu are not very descriptive. The skate was fried and very heavy, and had I known that I would have gotten something different.The service was also quite good. They never rushed us, despite someone in the party being late and the table not ordering for a while. At the same time, they were attentive and prompt.The downside is the amount of space inside. I don't expect excessive space in these types of restaurants, but the tables are set ridiculously close, about four inches apart. One of the adjacent tables was on an end and had three people in it, one of them scrunched up against another trying to stay out of our table space. At this distance you feel intimately involved in your neighbors' discussion. I wasn't particularly interested in knowing that the woman to my right likes to spend five minutes in her weekly meeting with her reports having a moment of honesty where you can ask anyone anything about their life and expect a truthful answer in exchange for not receiving judgement, or where in Los Angeles the man to my left was from and what he enjoyed about it, but I got these tidbits anyways as a result of practically sitting at their table. They also only have one toilet in the restaurant, shared between men and women. On the way out of the restaurant while trying to squeeze between people I knocked someone's drink off their table.

The steak tartare in particular, prepared table side, made as spicy or as mild as you choose. It reminded me of France, and how I've never been there. The bone marrow poppers were incredible. So much so we ordered a second serving, so we wouldn't have to go all Hunger Games to share them. My ginger smash was gingery and smashing. Really. Just the right ammount of gin (a bucketload).

Apps were better than entrees, as entrees were tiny portions.  Bacon wrapped lamb was pretty good.  Wish we would've known the portions were so small, I would've ordered the rib eye or another entree.  Had the tagliatelle bolognese special, was good tasting, but small and not tagliatelle (some other shape of pasta I couldn't identify).  Bill was not expensive, but one member of the party didn't drink and barely ordered so that definitely kept the tab down.  Tiny little place, hot as hell on 50 degree April night, must be a sweatshop in the summer.  I understand it's all about the drinks here, but there is not sufficient room to enjoy your drink.

They open at 6, but people start lining up beforehand. Not a terribly huge crowd, but if you'd like a seat at the bar, make sure to arrive before 6:15. At that time, all the seats at the bar were taken and it was standing room only, as all the tables in the bar were reserved.. The dining room, however had plenty of room and was quiet and softly lit, compared to the loud and bustling bar area. After a while, who knows where my friend was and I had to give up his bar seat that I'd tried to hold.However, after tasting the drinks, I can see why people flock to this place. The first drink I had, the Hemingway, danced the line between packing a punch and being playful. It was a mixture of Banks 5 Island Rum & Fresh Lime Juice, Shaken with Maraschino Liqueur & Fresh Grapefruit Juice, served straight up. It definitely leaves you wanting more.The bartenders were also very friendly. After sitting down, they immediately place water, a napkin and a lit candle in front of you. I also thought it was neat how on the bartenders' uniform tops, it says ""Principal Bartender"" or ""Apprentice."" Even the apprentices are pretty skilled.So, at this point, I'm still waiting for my friend and didn't just want to take up space at the bar, so I ordered another drink. I asked if I could order off the menu and I was told that I could - just name the drink and they'd make it. I asked for a Bee's Kiss, a drink that I'd heard is legend over at Milk & Honey and Little Branch. The bartender had never heard of it before and asked me the ingredients and how to serve it. I told him the three ingredients (rum, cream and honey). He asked if heavy cream was ok (yes) and proceeded to measure everything out by eye, shake it with ice and serve it. He then asked if I'd like anything grated on top, like some fresh nutmeg. I said yes and then he served me. When I took my first sip, for never having even heard of this drink, he hit a home run and I let him know as much when he returned to ask me how the drink was. Sweet, creamy and strong.I wouldn't say there's anything terribly speakeasy-ish about this place, other than it's not labeled on the outside, except for the neon psychic sign, but they do have what a lot of other speakeasies don't - superb bartenders with excellent mixology skills.There was no psychic there when I was around, but perhaps it was a bit too early. Too bad, since I was pondering if she could tell me where last put my Canon AE-1.As for what happened to my friend, he said he got stuck in Williamsburg Bridge traffic. After an hour, I vacated my spot at the bar, texted my friend and told him to meet me at Little Branch, where I also tried the Bee's Kiss.

I loved the seafood at Gramercy Tavern, I loved the Dim Sum at Buddakan, but for me Employees Only put them both to shame. While visiting NYC we were meeting up with four locals- 2 coming from Hoboken, 1 from downtown and one from midtown. Strangely enough this place had come up in conversations with two different groups of people, and in a city with 25,000 restaurants that is not something to be ignored. We had originally tried and failed to get a same night reservation elsewhere (it was a Tuesday) and miraculously Employees Only had availability. You REALLY won't be able to find it unless you know where to look. There's a sign for a psychic and behind that curtain is the lounge. The restaurant seats only about 20 people, and we were escorted to our dark cozy half booth.Evan ordered a Pimms Cup, and this one had lots of mint and the perfect mix of ingredients. The 3 ladies split a bottle of white wine for $40. Not a bad price for the bottle.The 6 of us started with the braised octopus which was moist and flavorful, ricotta gnocchi and the charcuterie plate. We could have done with more appetizers as the only one substantial was the charcuterie. Main course... Evan and I split the Orecchiette (rich ear shaped pasta) and the Short Rib Terrine. The Orecchiette was so flavorful; and the Short Rib had been shredded and marinated, then put back together in a large steak shape (Terrine) atop a bed of flavorful kale with a citrus puree (though the puree for me was too intense). The service here doesn't disappoint either. There were always water refills, drink orders, fresh plates and bread.

Aylesbury Duck Vodka & St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur Shaken with Puréed Blackberries & Fresh Lemon Juice. Yummy! It's not too sweet and super refreshing. Then it gets really sweet half way through. That what happens with cocktails, as their temperature rise to room temperature. I would get mine less sweet and add some ice into the glass next time. These cocktails are just too expensive to be drunk quickly. Got Ginger Smash for my second, hoping it could be less sweet. Muddled Ginger Root & Fresh Kumquats Shaken with Tequila Cabeza, Clement Creole Shrubb & Fresh Lime Juice. Still, the sweetness overwelmed my palate after a few sips.

But at the time, it was impossible to get a table and so like many other places in New York City, this place got shelved. But recently, I was flipping through my NFT guide and it reminded me to give it another try. They take reservations, so that was a relief. We arrived on a Saturday night and as soon as you walk in, there is a palm reader sitting in the small, cozy entrance. There are large, red curtains that separate the outside from the inside hidden world of the speakeasy.Our 1920s-style flapper hostess greeted us after we swam pass the bar. It wasn't crowded...yet. She was extremely attractive and engaging. She also gave us probably the best seats in the house. A small circular table in the corner with a view towards the rest of the dining area and the bar. The perfect seats for the perfect date. We were able to cozy up next to each other. I started off with a Lazy Lover ($15). I have a thing for spicy cocktails and whenever I see a spicy cocktail on the menu, I can't help but get distracted. It consists of cachaça & jalapeño infused green chartreuse shaken with benedictine, fresh lime juice & agave nectar. An excellent drink with only a hint of spiciness. I also tried the Provençale ($14). It is lavender-infused plymouth gin stirred with herbs de provence-infused vermouth & combier royal. A strong drink that is packed with lavender flavor.For appetizers, we tried the steak tartare and bone marrow poppers. The steak tartare is prepared at your table and that is unique. It makes you remember the place. It was a very good steak tartare, but if you want the best, you still have to try Locanda Verde. The bone marrow poppers with pastry shell and bordelaise were a nice treat. I like the milky semi-thick consistency of bone marrow. Being that it is summer now, I tend to avoid heavier dishes, so I opted for the arugula and fennel salad with garbanzo beans and parmesan. I love fennel. I can't eat enough of it. The salad was fresh and the garbanzo beans worked well with the fennel. For dessert, we shared the butterscotch and mascarpone cheesecake with sea salt and nut brittle. Excellent dessert. I wanted a second slice, but I was on good behavior.When we left 4 hours later, the bar was packed. I admit, they do serve up some serious cocktails. This is place is quite seductive and alluring.

Instead of apologizing and comping at least one or throwing them away, he slid the extras over to his friends. What an insult to someone who just paid $16 for a simple 3 ingredient drink my mom could make (seriously - it was just well vodka, fresh lemon juice and mint shaken up). That must be why the place is so packed--the staff's friends crowded around the bar, waiting for free drinks to come their way. The music was cheesy 80's tunes, typical popular music tourists like. And there was a random, sad burlesque dancer in the dining area for one song. There is only one bathroom you have to fight a crowd to get to. I don't mind a unisex restroom, but it is small and guys pee on the toilet. Gross. I don't get what the big deal about this place is.

The kitchen here appropriately and impressively pairs the burger with both kajmak (clotted cream-like cheese) and ajvar (pepper/eggplant spread).  I love that they serve it late night as it reconstructed hazy memories of eating this delicious burger as a futile attempt to compensate for hours upon hours of drinking in Belgrade and Novi Sad.  If this was the only aspect of my experience here, then Employees Only would be on the short list for a five star rating.  Unfortunately, everything else about this bar just did not live up to expectations.  I'm beginning to question whether there is a bar north of Tennessee that can probably construct a Pimm's Cup because to describe the one at this bar as unimpressive would be a polite understatement.  The other drinks I sampled were okay, but we won't be placing Employees Only on the pedestal with Angel's Share, Flatiron Lounge, or Raines Law Room any time soon.  The space was also a bit cramped, and the music was loud enough that I had to literally shout to try and speak to my friends.  In fairness, this is a bar but if you have table service, I think it is a reasonable expectation that you can talk to the patrons seated with you.  I'm kind of torn about this place.  But, at the end of the day, one remarkable feature of the place does not excuse the rest of the experience.  It's worth a visit for the Serbian food, but there are better cocktails bars in the city.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

So we push past the psychic and went through the velvet curtain and there was the bar. It was exactly the type of bar I love to love, with its vintage feel, velvet, metal, rough hewn wood. The bartenders looked all old timey and some of those hipster ones were even sporting those crazy mustaches that ONLY work in speakeasies. Yeah. So we are able to get a table because it's very early in the evening and I think it might have been a Sunday. Nothing jumps out at me from the menu, so I ask the waitress to suggest something in the flavor combo I was feeling and off she goes to the bar to have something extra special made. Turns out, it was an Old Fashioned with only a slight twist, and it was absolutely delicious in that classic way. My brother and JAK loved their drinks too, and steadily the bar around us started filling up quite a bit. I was actually surprised at how many people they had squeezed in there by the time we had finished a few rounds and left. It was pretty crowded. We had to squeeze through the crowd to get out and all that. Because I am a child at heart and believe in magic, I of course had to try out the psychic. JAK was totally into it, and by that time more friends had arrived and my brother hung out with them at the table while we went to have our cards read. I'm a total and complete sucker for that sort of thing and really thought the reading was my future. Three old fashioneds sealed the deal. JAK also liked her reading. Thank god for best friends. Since that first night I have been back a few times and the drinks are constantly improving. I will say though that the psychic is different and not nearly as good or believable, which is disappointing. Although this does leave me more money for drinks, so I guess it's a win. The classic speakeasy vibe and decadent cocktails will keep me coming back, but the crowded Friday nights mean I can't stay there long, so I think I just found my weeknight hangout.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

Interesting as there were already three girls standing in line, one of whom muttered ""Not for the bar..."" I then called up the bartender who informed me, as I suspected, that no reservations are needed and that the bar was in fact not yet full! Wow. If you need to try this hard to look popular, that is an ominous sign for the business. Unfortunately, such a blatant display of rudeness, albeit mildly amusing in its transparency, equates more with sheer ineptitude than it does with coolness or class, so we spent a wonderful evening at two nearby locations, Aria Wine Bar and The Otherroom (both fantastic).

The bartenders (aka mad scientists behind the bar) used fresh peach purée. It tasted like the sweet nectar of the Gods.

It's dimly lit and very sexy, which while i know this place is hardly top secret anymore... the bland, no-signage, non-descript entrance and then coming in here was kinda great.The drink menu looked amazing with so many great choices and I'm not a big drinker, so I was a little overwhelmed. We asked the bartender what he recommended and after like, two questions, he got a little smart like ""i'm a not a psychic""... thanks for that, douchebag. So back and forth a little bit and I rather snottily asked fort the menu back, since ""you clearly aren't too helpful""... and he turned on his heel in a huff and started making a drink and I saw him putting cucumbers in it and what looked to be some type of green herb. I had every intention of sending it back if I didn't like it, but the fucking thing was AMAAAAAAAAAZING!!!It tasted a little sweet and gingery with a vague hint of tea in it, and mint and cucumber. It was off the charts. It was exactly the type of thing i would have ordered.So I smiled and thanked him and told him how great it was, and that my friends, is the story of how I made peace with the little despot behind the bar.My date ordered a drink he thought was amazing, but I didn't try the first one. The second one he ordered was pinky orange with 3 tiny dried roses in the middle... it was flipping amazing. i believe it had pomegranite... either fresh or liquer (?) and tanqueray and maybe some citrus and who knows what else.Amazing.i wanna get all dressed up one night and come back for sure!",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

Tip your mixologist well and they will be nice to you :). My first drink was the Pimm's Cup ($15) and it was the best I've ever had (and I've had my share in NOLA). Then the pisco sour ($15) was presented to me after I asked the mixologist for the prettiest drink they had. And it was very attractive-made with egg white foam and other concoctions. Plus it was delish and strong! My boyfriend had the Vespar ($16) that was strong and so delish. Usually I don't like cocktails like Vespar because they are usually too strong but this one was amazing. We also tried si mamacita- if you like tequila then you should def try this cocktail.

Ordered the bone marrow poppers and the steak tartare. Rich and decadent bone barrow grounded the flaky and airy pastry. The steak tartare was mixed table side, came accompanied by slices of crispy toasted baguette and a small green salad. I've only had steak tartare once before in Paris. Even though the dish is straight red meat, I found it refreshing with the little bits of shallots and generous seasoning. I had the ginger smash. Loved the generous and hearty chunks of ginger thrown in. This cocktail is not for the timid, that ginger comes on STRONG. Felt like my sinuses had cleared significantly after finishing the drink.

Small with cramped quarters, this little restaurant/ bar has a nice vibe to it upon first glance. But the place has many problems which is unfortunate because it is such a cool little space. 1) I had 8:30 reservations and dropped $400.00 on 4 people in an hour for food that was really mediocre. Small portions, over cooked meats and pastas, bland sauces. Everything needed salt. At 9:30 (one hour later) they were asking us to leave our table because there were other people who needed to be seated. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME? I just spent good money to have an evening of conversation with my friends and you are booting me out?? I couldn't believe it. It was the most shamelessly tacky thing I have experienced at a ""nice"" restaurant in a long time. 2) There is one bathroom stall. For both men and women. Meaning that there is one toilet for the entire restaurant. And the bar is quite popular which means that while you are trying to enjoy your meal, a bathroom trip is going to run you 20 mins and your food gets cold in the meantime. 3) The people who run the place are snotty. I know it's New York but at 100.00 a head, I expect to be treated well. In summary, small portions, boring food, snotty service, one bathroom stall, and EXPENSIVE.

I have never ever seen such complete rudeness in my life and I am truly embarrassed that this can happen in my city. If I could give this -5 stars I would.

Be care, is pleasantly sweet and strong. 20 min later, we were nicely asked to move because the event was happening right there. Using our chairs. It didn't bother us. They were so nice. I was already feeling like in a friend's place. Maybe because the guy that came many times to refill our glass of water with a big smile and open to random conversation.

Always a fan of the texture given for the egg white. Semisweet. Semi creamy. So delicious.   If this event was happening randomly just for one night .. I don't really now. Sorry about it?  But hey, I told you. The drinks and the ambiance are just more than enough. And I bet it was Henry La Fargue who was sitting next table dressed in a classic men robe.

Works for me!) Earlier in the evening, the bartender would sample the cocktail with a straw, much like a chef should taste his food. Nice touch.That said, the cocktails were good, but I have had better, especially at this price point.The Billionaire cocktail was tasty, but the absinthe bitters could be dialed back a bit - anise flavor goes a long way. My sister had the Ginger Smash, which was too heavy on the ginger. Even for a drink, the name of which starts with ""ginger"" - it was too much ginger. After dinner, we came back, but were told to come back at 10 pm - too crowded. We wandered around, trying other too-crowded bars (including beloved Little Branch), but decided to check back in w/ EO, and were let in.Sister went for a Gin-Gin Mule this time, which was nicely done, and I had their Manhattan, which was good, but spirits-light, the way a lot of these places are making their Manhattans these days. I would have liked more rye, but I suppose that the ideal Manhattan, like the ideal Martini, varies from person to person.The last drink of the night loses EO a star - the Ready-Fire-Aim. Ugh. The net flavor is pretty much that of gasoline, and I have had a few mezcal cocktails before. I finished the drink, as I thought it was my palate, but no - walking to the subway, I had to pick up a Vitamin Water just to get the taste out of my mouth.

I know what kind of drinks to expect, egg whites, bees knees, the usual...First - manage your expectations. The space is tight, mostly long and narrow, rail-road'ish.  If you're not leaning against the bar, or leaning against the guy leaning on the bar, you're stuck to the wall, being intimately close to the people walking to and fro the bathroom. With that being said, it's still tolerable. Like if you find a good nook, don't move. Plus the interior design is sexy and inviting.Second - because it's in a good location, and thus popular, the service is slow. Not because the mixologist people are lacking, it's because the cocktails are specific, and complicated and the demand is larger than the labor. So if you order, get two cocktails at a time.Third - what to order? By far - The Amelia .Russian Standard Vodka & St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur shaken with puréed Blackberries & Fresh Lemon Juice. OMG. Please stop the press for this one. Like some heat? Try the Lazy Lover  - Leblon Cachaca & Jalapeño Infused Green Chartreuse shaken with Benedictine, Fresh Lime Juice & Agave Nectar.A few interesting things to note. 1) Go early because at one point the bouncer will velvet rope the crap out of you. For good reason. The space is small. It starts to get warm and uncomfortable. So he needs to manage the flow of people. Its funny because I would go out for a smoke break and watch leggy blondes, and cleavage bearing women try to work their charm. To no avail, the bouncer was not falling prey to transparent advances. He literally told them to just go elsewhere. 2) So random - there's a palm reader nestled behind some curtains when you first walk in.

Everything was fresh, cooked and seasoned to perfection and accompanied by delicious sauces. All the meats literally melted in your mouth. Dessert didn't disappoint either, we had the Butterscotch and Mascarpone Cheesecake which was to die for. I didn't try any cocktails, because I was having red wine, which by the way, was really good too, but a lot of them sounded very appealing on the menu. Our main server, and everyone else, were attentive, friendly and efficient. Even the bouncer was sweet and funny. The place is small, but the decoration is pretty cool. My only complaint would be the lack of restrooms, there's only one, but if you're having dinner, your server will take you downstairs where there's no line, and you also get to see the kitchen, where all the magic takes place.

It was busy and noisy in the bar area. That means that there are good drinks. The wait staff was exceptional, attentive and on top of things even though it was crazy busy. I had the La Mikana and the Fraise Sauvage for drinks. The La Mikana was my favorite. It was grapefruit cordial, gin and champagne garnished with rosemary. SECONDLY: It's busy and noisy because it has amazing food!We had the Marrow Poppers and the Charcuterie. The chicken liver paté was the best I have ever eaten, velvety, smooth and creamy without the gritty dirty taste some chicken liver patés can have. My husband got the Porterhouse Pork Chop with Black-Eyed Peas & Savoy Cabbage. The pork was tender and the chop was almost 2"" thick. The side was black eyed peas that were also savory and the best companion to the pork. I had the  Elk Loin Wild Rice, Winter Squash, & Parsnip. It was excellent! It came with elk marrow, which I could only eat a few small fork fulls since the portion of food was generous.The waiter suggested the cheesecake for desert. We are not really cheesecake people, but we figured we'd try it. It was smooth and creamy. Not the pasty cheescake with graham cracker crust that is everywhere.

I thought the Quiet Storm was a great twist on the traditional Dark  & Stormy. But  it was the food that really made me want to move in and start a new life here.

Both drinks contained a good amount of alcohol for the usual $16 price of a cocktail in NYC but, my only complaint was my glass was a little small but, hey thats NYC for you. We ordered the Bone Marrow Poppers appetizer which my GF wanted to try. It was a slightly salty, light and flaky plate which had a unusual taste, I didn't taste the hype here but I guess it wasn't all that bad. For dinner I ordered the half baked chicken, which was very juicy and cooked perfectly with a light crispy skin I thought it was delectable. The plate came out in about 25 mins. My GF ordered the Pork Chop which she said was delicious as well as it was also cooked perectly and seasoned well. We shared the brussel sprouts with bacon as a side dish which complemented my chicken dish perfectly, and we both enjoyed.

It was almost 1:00 in the morning and my Papito and I finished watch Joan River's documentary (funny as hell!); and walked-in into Employees Only; the front bar was packed and got scared that we had to wait for a table, but once we passed through the crow, we found the tiny dining room area on the back; and there were some tables available. The staff directed us to a corner table and we just went for the ride... Let me say that I had probably two of the best cocktails I ever had in the city. They were amazing. No wonder why they are the ""hottest"" mixologists on the city... I can't wait to try their other venues. The food was above expectations. For a bar, sceny place like this, I wasn't expecting such good food. We had the Avocado Crostini and it was just a great for a bar dish, tasty! I had the Arugula & Shaved Fennel Salad as a main; and that was just great as well.  Papito had the La Frieda Burger and he found that good too.  And by reading the other items on the menu I could say that there's some European influence on it, but everything looks appetizing. How to describe the place? It is not a big, this place is not for large groups since tables are tiny and very tide to each other (romantic in a way). I would say that is mainly more for couples and singles hang out. The room bar has about 15 tools and some tables against the wall... there are three bartenders on duty pouring drinks for the thirsty ones. The back dining room has a glass roof which give the impression that you might be outside; but without loosing the speakeasy-esque of it.  I want to see this duting daylight; maybe for Brunch!The crow seems young and professionals, and New Yorkers for what I can tell.

Love the space itself, but the food didn't blow me away:- Bone marrow poppers - the filo pastry was too overwhelming so you couldn't really taste the marrow. Could have been anything at that point really. - Charcuterie plate - really delicious and I like that we got 3 of everything. Hate it when you go somewhere as a 3 and only get 2 of things. Great meats. Parmesan wasn't up to par.- Steak tartare - friends liked it. It's prepped at the table with egg, salt, shallots, capers, worcestershire sauce and hot sauce. Served with generous amount of crispy bread.- Crispy skate paprikas - nice fish but heavy dish overall with the batter and the spaetzle tasted crispy (fried also maybe?) so it was just too much.They were a little slow to bring our second round of drinks so we were done with our food by the time they came.

It's slightly greasy, but nevertheless falls apart in your mouth. There is that instant sensation of gratification as the fat hits your tongue.For dinner, you have the Paprika Prawns. Partly because you've never had prawns before, and partly because you're feeling adventurous after sipping on bourbon. Your recieve 5 or 6 of them in a bowl on top of some greens, and some other crunchy things that have an unknown identity since it's dark.

Not a very good value, either.The bar itself is beautiful, but it's barely a speakeasy (basically just a bar behind a curtain), and the drinks are way overpriced given the quality. The best cocktails I've had in the city have come from some of its better New American restaurants (e.g., Buttermilk Channel, Marlowe & Sons, Gwynnett St., etc.), and Employees Only is more expensive and not in the same league. It's the little things that matter with these drinks, and it's the little things that weren't there. The egg whites and the purees came from bottles (i.e., weren't made fresh), and when you say pistachio encrusted rim, I assume that's what I'll get. Not great complexity in the cocktails--I wouldn't say one-dimensional, but underwhelming given some of the genius drinks being made around the city. Plus, they're priced 50% than their competitors. Just not worth it. Go to Fig. 19 instead.The bar is beautiful inside -- absolutely. But there isn't a ton of bar seating, and even if you're a party of four just getting drinks and there are open tables, you can't sit.

I've been here twice for drinks and my impressions are these:the drinks are good, but definitely not the most incredible drinks by the best mixologists in the city (as my husband cites to me each time he mentions Employees Only)it is extremely crowded and I happen to be the kind of person who gets extremely claustrophobic and, as a result, tend to avoid clubs altogether, and bars and lounges which make me feel like I'm stuck in rush hour trafficI haven't personally been to the psychic in the front window, but I'd be interested in returning for an impromptu reading because she seems like funI'd like to try the food, as I've heard good things about it ... and ultimately, that one remaining factor will help me determine if this is the kind of place that I'd like to visit again, or just look for other establishments with fantastic drinks and delicious food - cause let's face it ... there are many",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

The bartenders wore fancy white uniforms and served us sixteen dollar tequila drinks. I had asked him to whip us up something and the concoctions ended up being overly bitter but drinkable.

We had an 11:30 res, walked in were seated and as I looked around was like this place is nothing to shout about decor wise, we started off with Bone Marrow Poppers - BAH! they were flavorless, we also had Bacon Wrapped Lambchops - These are great and the chimichurri style sauce was uh-may-zing.  Next came the Squid and Mussels with crispy polenta - my roomie and I fought over the polenta very delicious. We shared the Orichette - delish as well.  Ruben Croquttes - Meh... But the kicker of the night was Marscapone Cheesecake - this will make you want to slap your grandmama.

After hearing such great things about it and trying numerous wonderful cocktails at charity and other food events, my experience at the actual bar was surprisingly dismal. First, my group had an issue getting in. However, they let in someone before and after us (groups of girls) without issue. We were told the place was too full and had to wait (2 guys 2 girls). The place actually was pretty packed, and I know EO has the aura of being 'exclusive', but why make us wait but not the other group? Whatever.  That didn't really bother me just a minor nuisance.The drinks themselves were a huge disappointment. Mine was just bad. The bartenders do know their stuff and are true mixologists, but our cocktails were just not up to par. No other way to describe it. The crowd was a bit more pretentious than I was expecting. It did not have the feel of my other favorite NYC cocktail bars. Maybe it was the night, but I felt like I was in a bar in Jersey.  Noise level is really loud but that is expected. Another thing to note, and definitely knocks down a star, there appears to only be one unisex bathroom. There was a decently sized line to get in and the bathroom was pretty dirty.I definitely will give them another try since I've had great cocktails from them in the past, just not in this actual location.

The Tarot card reader in the entryway of the restaurant is a unique and much appreciated feature of Employees Only.We arrived at around 9 p.m. The fortune teller was busy so we walked right in. The place was crowded but not overly packed as I had feared. We were seated right away at a table in the bar area - great for people watching, but also very loud. We started off with a few rounds of tasty (and potent) cocktails.For dinner, we each ordered the asparagus salad which was served with endive, arugula and parmesan in a light and lemoney dressing. My only complaint was that there was more lettuce than asparagus. I don't see this salad on the menu now so it may have been a seasonal item.For our main dish, we shared the Hand-Cut Steak Tartar that is served with crostini and mixed greens. This was my friend's first taste of this delicious raw beef dish which is made table side by mixing the beef with an egg yolk, onions, parsley, capers, pepper, salt and hot sauce.Overall a fun, casual place to hang out.

Place is jam packed and even thou thats a good sign I didnt like that there was literally no place to stand forget about sitting. People were constantly pushing and bumping into each other, and I know some folks have thng for grinding into each other and stuff. But baby ,I live in NYC and ride the Hell-o-coaster called subway everyday to work. So I get enough of that action on a daily basis, so thank u but no thank u.line to get a drink was long enough that you were already sober before you got the next one.And I didnt know that the are famous for their cocktails so was sipping on my gin/tonic  and trying to dance a bit (by dancing I mean moving my things a it cuz thats the only body part that u might be able to move cuz of traffic.Crowd?

I wish I could give it 3.5 stars since everyone else is raving about the place and I'm thinking maybe I missed something. This ambiance you all speak of, what ambiance?? Perhaps you're referring to the oh-so-original tea light set up? Personally, I thought it was crowded, loud and kind of dingy. The tables were pushed so close together this girl practically sat in my drink when she tried to squeeze by. Positive reviews about the drinks are no exaggeration though - I got the west side (delicious), the EO Gimlet (strong), and a vodka martini (meh-can't really screw that one up). My friend got the provencale - which was amazing. Order it - very herbal, unique and refreshing. I'm reading the menu as I write this and am realizing that all the good reviews must be in reference to the food. The only thing I ate here were the bone marrow poppers, which certainly were delectable, but I definitely need to come back for the food. Elk loin?? Bacon wrapped lamb chops??

A crowd that didn't seem to really care about the craft cocktails that were being poured, and a bar staff overwhelmed by this crowd to the point that they couldn't engage with me when I wanted to ask about the cocktail menu and their favorite drinks to make.

I got here earlier with two friends and we decided to sample some of their cocktails as we waited for the rest of our party. I had the Billionaire Cocktail. It was a great bourbon drink, a little sweet, and the absinthe bitters made for a great little kick in the end.Our party finally arrived and we got ourselves situated. With a group of 10 we were able to sample a lot of the menu. The appetizers were amazing. We had the potato gnocchi, bone marrow poppers, steak tartar, oysters, mussel roast, and chicken liver pate. Stand outs to me were the bone marrow poppers and the gnocchi. I shared the rainbow trout with a friend, and though it was cooked very well it was rather ordinary. I also sampled the elk loin. It also was cooked very well, yet lacked any memorable flavoring. Food aside, this place is more known for their drinks. While they were good, I felt they were more on the sweet side. They lacked a good selection of stirred bitter drinks. Another poster commented on how it seemed that more women came here. I can see why based on their cocktail menu. The only dark bitter drink on the menu was their Manhattan, but it was a damn good Manhattan.The vibe itself is nice. Nothing too memorable.

When I arrived around 12:30am the bouncer told me no one was allowed in unless they had reservations. I explained what I was told and then asked if I could put my name on a list. He said yes but wasn't paying much attention to me as there was some other drunken fellow grabbing his attention. Eventually after I asked again he picked up and board and scribbled something down. He looked at me and said to come back in an hour. I asked of he needed my name and he looked at me and decided he did, he picked up his board and erased what he wrote and scribbled something again. Anyway, so an hour later I decide to give the place a shot in which I was lead to a tight table in the back to be served. I was with my girlfriend at this point and we were asked if we would like water, which I said yes to and we ordered some cocktails. Was looking forward to trying the food. We ordered the bone marrow puffs and the liver pate to start. The bone marrow was a little dry for me but the pastry was right. The liver pate was great! Very well balanced and super smooth. The lamb was... Well lamb. Good but a little over cooked. The chicken was horrible, over salted potatoes and greasy chicken, I almost asked for my money back. Whatever cocktail I got was a mistake.... Horrendous. My girlfriend had something similar to a old fashion which wasn't bad. The server really ignored us the whole time. It was like pulling teeth to order the food and it was until I asked for a third time before I received water. I don't know, I guess you have to be part of some elite group to be noticed here.

Totally threw me off, but then you step inside and go behind the curtain where voila! you are now in one of Manhattan's coolest bars. The bar is split in two parts where you can either sit and actually have dinner with your cocktails or  just hangout by the bar itself. We decided to sit down since we were a bit hungry and ordered Bone Marrow poppers, potato gnocchi, and spaghetti to share. It's a bit pricey here and smaller portions so I would say don't come here starving. Bone Marrow poppers were pretty good, but I was kind of whatever about the potato gnocchi. I didn't really like the consistency of it 'cause it tasted it a bit more mushy(?) I like gnocchi to be more of that sticky/doughy consistency. Spaghetti wasn't with tomato sauce and had a nice kick to it.For cocktails I got the Lazy Lover which had a very unique taste since it was jalapeno infused. Think it took a few sips to get used b/c of the slight jalapeno taste to but I liked it overall. My friends got the Fraise Sauvage and the Manhattan Cocktail which I liked as well.

They would converse with us in between running back and forth, serving other customers. Around 11 PM it cleared out, and we decided to do the same. The bartender said we should stay longer - gave us a shot of what I assumed to be Bella Rosa on the house. Okay. We'll stay a little longer... but not that much longer.

However, when we arrived the place was hoping, and we had to wait 10 extra minute for our table.  It  was well worth it though, and the amazing aperitifs from the bar tied us over. For a starter my friend and I split the mussel stew, which was so rich and creamy. For an entree I had the elk, which was perfectly cooked and season, and paired with potato's and spinach.  Usually I am not a dessert person, but I thought the butterscotch cheesecake sounded nice.  AMAZING.

I definitely trust the waitress with the long brunette hair. She didn't lie to me about Fraise Sauvage -Plymouth Gin shaken with Wild Strawberries & Tahitian Vanilla, topped off with Zardetto Prosecco. I like Vanilla, but I don't care for it in my drinks nor in my perfume. I feel the same way about Jalapenos - I love them, but I don't care for it in alcohol form.So naturally, I was interested in Fraise Sauvage, but when I read Tahitian Vanilla...it put me off. I saw this cocktail again and I asked the waitress if they could just skip the vanilla. She advised it's already mixed with the Wild Strawberries, but said you couldn't detect the Vanilla flavour and guess what...she did not lie to me.It was absolutely delicious and so I decided to ask for another suggestion...she recommeneded Amelía - Luksusowa Potato Vodka & St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur shaken with pureed Blackberries & Fresh Lemon Juice.This was also good, but less fruity.We got two orders of the Potato Gnocchi - Shitake, Oyster & Cremini Mushrooms. I like the mushrooms, but I felt the Gnocchi was a bit too hard but E loves it. Hence, we had two orders of this stuff along with the Mussel Roast.S got an order of Spaghetti, since S was craving some and even though it's pretty plain...it was really good.E loves sweets and got the Poached Apple ""Tufahija"" Candied Walnuts & Clove Scented Yogurt.

Handle bar mustaches, Supreme hats, girls in silky work dresses in PR. Don't come if you dont have trendy glasses, read pitchfork on your Ipad3 or work at a coffee shop. Come for the mixed drinks, stay for the food, and leave for the price tab. I got the ginger smash chocktail. Absolutely delicious. Not so strong though. I was expecting more. But the actual pieces of crushed pineapple and ginger made it worth my while. So fruity they got stuck in my teeth.  My friend and I ordered the potato gnocci portobello plate, which I severely enjoyed. Perfectly firm wheat gnocci in a really rich, buttery yet non-creamy mushroom sauce. Tender speared asparagus and real portobello steamed mushrooms also delighted the dish. It was perfect.

932,O_onR3HUrk1OR7YPLp3jmQ,Jane D.,4.0 star rating,"Have you ever walked into a bar with a roaring wood fire in the fireplace, cocktails made by artisan mixologists, good grub and nice people, and sort of wished you could be snowed in there for a few days? If not, head to Employees Only and you'll see what I mean.   As others have noted, there is a slightly disconcerting psychic working at the front when you first walk in, as well as a funny man with a little clicker, counting the number of people inside. Once you're through the second set of doors, though, there's a warm, inviting bar to the right, stocked with all sorts of alcoholic goodies, dried flowers and teas, elderflower liquor, ginger, etc.... To the left are two small tables and beyond them, a roaring fire on cold nights, smelling of the most delicious woodsmoke. This front room is where the soul of the place resides, where drinkers congregate to watch the highly skilled bartenders make their magic, warm their hands before the fire, and just chat. It's the kind of warm, inviting (if sometimes very crowded) place where you feel welcome to chat for hours on end. You and your companions will actually hear one another, most of the time. The back dining room is a bit less inviting. The tables are horribly cramped and arranged to pack you in like sardines. If you're sitting on the inside, against the wall, you'll have to climb over or under the table to get out if there are other diners next to you. Also, the high glass ceiling lets in drafts of cold air and traps all the heat 20 feet up, where, alas, your standard sized diner cannot enjoy it. But no matter. The cocktails and food will warm you right up. Employees Only's winter menu offers hearty, belly warming victuals. There's elk loin served with polenta fritters, broccoli rabe and foie gras mousse, a veritable carnivore's delight. There's rainbow trout with smoked trout and frisee salad, beef cheeks with celery root puree and pickled beets. Specials on a recent night included a dish of giant prawns served over braised kale, which a dining companion declared delicious. The beef cheeks are gorgeously tender and minimally seasoned, allowing the full flavor of the meat to shine through, though the celery root puree accompaniment was slightly sticky and waterlogged. For the record, I don't personally mind this texture -- it's vaguely reminiscent of tororo -- but it won't appeal to everyone. It was wonderfully buttery and probably very few things with that much butter can go truly wrong in my book. Employees Only is not terribly vegetarian friendly, unfortunately, unless you want to drink your dinner. There is one vegetarian pasta main, two salads and a few assorted sides. I haven't tried the sides, but the pasta and salads are pretty run of the mill -- definitely not among the stronger menu offerings. If you do want to drink your dinner, though, you're in luck. IIRC, Employees Only offers three pages of cocktails, not to mention two more pages of wine, a number of beers and many more liquors. The cocktails are without question the highlight and rank among the best in the city. Bartenders mix with a precise hand and nothing is ever too sweet or sour or bitter. Drinks are well balanced grown-up concoctions -- and they all seem to have at least five ingredients, each. Despite the complexity, bartenders serve them up fast. Favorites include the Amelia (Luksusowa potato vodka and St. Germain elderflower liqueur shaken with pureed blackberries & fresh lemon juice) and the Ginger Smash (muddled ginger root & fresh cranberries shaken with Plymouth gin, Berentzen apple liqueur & fresh lemon juice served over ice). Each drink includes a full serving of fruit -- or that's what you can tell yourself if you're drinking your dinner -- and protein, too, if you order one with egg whites.

The drinks were amazing.   They were formulated to accurately enhance their flavors and put the major flavors on a stage for the drinker to enjoy.  Also the drinks paired very well with the different dishes they had on the menu.The Bone Marrow Poppers are amazing...  If you come here, order this app and you wont be disappointed, plain and simple.For dinner I had the Elk.  I had never had Elk before but I was pleasantly surprised.  I was either expecting something terribly gamy or something drenched in sauce, but what came out was neither of those.  It was a dish that highlighted the Elk for what it was and not trying to turn it into an Osso bucco or something like that.  My friends had a shrimp dish that was rockstar as well.  I think this place has one of those cool prohibition vibes while delivering a menu that is unique and delicious.  The drinks are spectacular and well worth the visit.  You will only find an Employees Only in a city like NYC.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

You can order any damn thing you want and these guys will at least equal the best you've had if not surpass it. I've been through this place many times, on busy nights and slow ones, and the quality has never lagged once. They are the best at what they do, take pride in the fact and know what service is supposed to be. You ask them to make a drink, they turn around and do it as fast and as quickly and as well as any bartender I've seen anywhere. They're into it, as evidenced by the fact that a number of them have the ""EO"" insignia tattooed. From a former bartender, all respect to the guys working at Employees Only. Now the food at a place like this, I wasn't expecting fireworks. I've only had but one thing and I'm convinced from this one experience that they have no less a standard for what comes out of the kitchen than what gets handed over the bar. It was a dessert, the cheese cake. Sex on a plate. Sex on a plate with Naomi Campbell, Penelope Cruz and Gong Li. Dreamlike. The guy who tends to work the door is a well-dressed Jamaican guy who's soft-spoken and very polite. Can't remember his name for the life of me at the moment but he's the man. If he says it's too crowded and he'll try to get you in even though you walked up with four dudes, he'll try. As far as the sign behind the bar about the pickpockets and loose women, yeah, no shit. There are always some hard-edged party people haunting this place. I wouldn't have it any other way. The meat market thing is true, pretty ferocious at this place. For me though, that's part of the ride. This isn't the place to go to if you want to knock back miller high lifes and be able to see the game no matter which way you're facing. It's gutsy, sophisticated, and accommodating to the kind of people who know how things should be done. It's an event unto itself.

It does get quite crowded later in the evening so either go early or plan to put your name in and come back later.

972,tzDhUMXOwv6hnVhGA4ksaw,Brent G.,5.0 star rating,"I wish I could give is ten stars. What's there left to say about one of the most critically acclaimed and revolutionary speakeasy cocktail bars in the world? Yes, it is so popular now that the term speakeasy is outdated but it still retains it's title as a supreme cocktail bar. Yes, fat chance of getting in with a large group on a Friday or Saturday evening but at is the cost of going to a well known place like this. The environment is extremely sexy and intimate, the crowd is outgoing and daring. The best part is the people behind the bar. The have so much passion and respect foe what they do. You are not watching bartenders who are trying to make it in show business or just pay their rent. These guys made it their lifestyle and career in a field where cocktails and their craft are so under appreciated. Just watching these fellas perform their craft and engage you in conversation is amazing. It's not really about the drinks (which are still stellar) but how professional and passionate these bartenders are without being uppity and pretentious",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

Drink menu is very eclectic, very strong, VERY GOOD. my only complaint is that the space is quite small - and it's kind of not very conducive to standing around. it was a good thing we found seating early on at the bar. all in all though, i will definitely be back.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

It is like they all want to be speakeasy bars, even though only some of them are really hidden. The atmosphere is totally art deco and very stunning with all the bottles used as an ornament at the bar. Avoid Saturday night since it is so packed you cannot really move in the tiny standing area at the bar. Try the 'Fraises Sauvages' or the 'Amelia' cocktails; bartenders in their white period costume know their job.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

(Background info.)  Remember, Yelp is not the NYTimes and it's ok to sacrifice one's editorial integrity in the name of free bourbon.2. When given the chance, ALWAYS sit at the bar (this applies almost everywhere in NYC).3. Go to EO, get some cocktails (may I recommend the Blood and Smoke), and lap up every bite of the tartar.  This review will self-destruct in five seconds.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"
977,i7ymt_8KpuAKMs3qOES33w,Ben K.,4.0 star rating,"This is one of my favorites, and I'm glad I found it considering the minimal signage :-)The drinks are awesome - made with great care and consideration. The bar staff clearly takes great pride in their mixology. As a beer/wine guy, G&T at most, type of guy of late, the great combinations Employees Only mixologists put together are incredibly pleasing and just scream for us basic types to branch out.Food is quite good, though not quite as much so as the drinks. The dining alcove appears ideal for a romantic dinner, but winds up being too loud to avoid leaning over the table and shouting. Don't let that keep you from having some dinner here though, doing so will allow one to indulge in just one more of the excellent drinks.",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

Now employees only is an amazing bar with stand up top shelf bartenders and staff .. It is most certainly an ""indusrty"" bar , a place where I go by myself and with coworkers when I'm not closing my own bar to have drinks and kick the crap with other industry folk. Yes I'ts crowded yes it's busy but never to insane , their cocktails  are great , the interaction with guests is exactly what you would expect, courteous , friendly and welcoming . Everything you want in a proper bar. I have not eaten their so I cannot speak on the food .. Speaking as a person in the ""industry"" it's rock and roll, good music good conversation good people ... I would recommend this bar to anyone especially ""industry"" folk ... I mean where else can you go after a long shift to drink and complain about your day @3am that's not gonna kick you out ? Ha ......cheers to them  and their chicken soup Sidenote: 1st floor bathroom takes forever but that's the only downside",Employees Only,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Diners,, Cocktail, Bars"

Manager said customers paid already and should leave shortly. 9:30pm we still didn't get seated nor did anybody offer us sth to drink. At least we got sth to drink after we complained to the Manager a 2nd time. 9:40pm talking to the Manager again. He feels sorry for the guests as they are over 60 and he doesn't want to rush them out although they paid over 30mins ago. 9:50pm: want to leave, but get seated now.
