Low lighting, romantic, and soft rock from the 70's that'll induce almost any couple, young or old, to add to the population. There's even a parking lot which is an absolute rarity in Hoboken.The owner, Joe took care of us personally. Joe is incredibly passionate about what he does and it comes through in spades.Joe prides himself on his mozzarella, so we started with the Burrata. It was creamy and delicious.For entrees my girlfriend had a special, a veal rollatini with prosciutto. I had the pappardelle with duck ragu. Both dishes were excellent. Whenever I try out a new Italian spot that I can see myself eating at over and over again, I start by ordering some form of their ragu/bolognese. The duck ragu special did not disappoint whatsoever. The sauce was fantastic.The only reason I rated a 4 out of 5 stars was for the price of the meal. 2 entrees and an appetizer (no drinks - it's byob) came out to $70 before tip. On the other hand, it's Hoboken and these guys have bills to pay. Very satisfied with my experience and would highly recommend trying them out.",San Giuseppe,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

Made a 5:45PM reservation, just in case, but there were a few open tables and a few large reserved tables. With visiting a new restuarant, always better to be safe then sorry reservation wise. First order of business: BYOB and there's a parking lot. Which as you know in Hoboken is a total win. Second: Atmosphere. Comfortable, not too pretentious, priced well. Service was exceptional. Felt like we were being welcomed into someone's home.Third: The food is fantastic. Seriously really really good. We wanted to try a variety of things so we ordered the buratta appetizer that came with very thin slices of prosciutto, roasted red peppers and tomatoes-DELISH. Also ordered a salad to start. Then the pesto gnocchi which was like perfect clouds and the capresa pizza. The pizza is really good. Overall, more than happy with my meal and would love to go back! Oh, and order the buratta.

2,hwPbKo2ZPmFwBs1RZV1WJw,April D.,5.0 star rating,I was in Jersey recently dog sitting for the night in Hoboken and decided to stop by San Giuseppe since it was near by for dinner and am so glad I did!! Not only was I veryyyy happy to see that the restaurant is BYOB but also the food was beyond amazing! It's very hard especially in NYC to find a restaurant serving true Italian dishes (not even in Little Italy!!) so I was happy to see an amazing menu with some of my favorite dishes and some new items as well! I tried the special which was a Lobster Ravioli with a really nice light sauce that was delicious and not too heavy. The pizza was very good too...I'm not a pizza person but I had a few slices of their San Giuseppe Pizza which I think is one of their signatures and I would come back for more! Even though I live in Manhattan I would 100% come back to Hoboken for dinner again at San Guiseppe. Ohhhh and the Tiramisu is on point...I could barely fit any more food in but one of the owners was so sweet and brought some over and I had to indulge!=======================================================,San Giuseppe,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

That was not the case for our latest visit. Needless to say, regardless our experience, the restaurant location and ambiance is wonderful. Tucked away from all the hustle and bustle of the main ave, one of the best attributes of this restaurant is that it has its own parking lot with plenty of parking spaces.After being seated, the waitress came over and asked for our drink order, we received our drinks and my glass had ice whereas my boyfriend's drink had none. Odd, but we looked past it. They also brought what seemed like pizza crusts as the ""bread."" They were very bland and definitely needed an oil/vinegar or marinara side. Upon making our food order, we asked if we can make our pie half bianca and half Italian sausage. Our waitress shouted over our table to the pizza maker asking if the bianca pie has red sauce. Mind you, bianca literally translates to white in which I couldn't help but giggle when she asked this question.We ordered the Melanzane Ripiene as an appetizer and while eating it, we realized it was missing the mozzarella as the menu stated and lacked any flavor. Disappointed with the appetizer, we waited to receive the main course, the pizza that we fell in love with 2 years back. When the pizza arrived we already knew something was different, just by the way it looked. And after eating it, we knew it was definitely not the same pizza. The quality of the pizza was not worth the $$, in fact there are plenty of pizza places in Hoboken that served better pizza than what we had last night. We gave it 3 out of 5 stars, mediocre at best.After reading others reviews, I learned that owners of this establishment have changed and leaves me to question if that's when the quality of the food also changed.

I called to make a last minute reservation initially for 15 guests and Mario was so accommodating. I kept changing the number of guests between 17 and 15 and in the end it became 14 people.

The space of this restaurant is perfect for family style events. They even have options of a pre-fixed menu.But the two important things I chose about this place other than their customer service and food (obviously), is that they have a private parking lot and it's BYOB! For me, that's a win/win.Its a family owned business and every person that walks through their doors makes you feel like you just belong and I love that. I forgot the mother's name but she is just a sweetheart and her two sons Joseph and Mario are just as amazing as she is. Thank you so much San Giuseppe for making our night so special and memorable.

You can not order a glass; you have to order a bottle (I am a very light drinker so this means I just do not drink here at all :)Other than that, they have the best Arugula salad in Hoboken. Also, as I said before, they do not bring the Garlic.

(They are not deep fried). Also, to compliment the Wings for starters we had their Insalata Toscana w/ grilled shrimp which comes with romaine lettuce, chick peas, cannellini beans, cherry tomatoes tossed with extra virgin olive oil and topped with parmigiano reggiano.. fresh and zesty. For our entree we had an San Giuseppe Signature Pie, 14 inch L' Italiana Pizza with butternut squash puree, Fontina cheese, crimini mushrooms and my fave.. Truffle oil.

65,bFPO6YGF5aLK0-44aNubpg,Gina T.,1.0 star rating,"This review is being updated for the business under new ownership. Don't waste your time or money with this place. The service was terrible and there was an issue with both of our pizzas being served with the wrong ingredients and we were up-charged beyond listed prices anyway. Talking to the owner was a joke, he didn't even attempt to make it right except to argue that the ingredients they ended up using were more expensive than what we actually ordered. This is an empty shell of what san giuesppe's used to be.Previous review for original ownershipThis is my favorite spot for pizza in Hoboken! They have inventive gourmet pizzas with generous toppings and a delicious coal fired crust. The pizzas are large and good for 2-3 people. The owner and main chef is from Italy and truly cares about your experience and frequently checks in on you once you receive your order. As a vegetarian my go-to pizzas are L'Italiana and Mezza Luna. L'italiana is a rich flavorful choice with butternut squash purée instead of sauce layered with fontina cheese and crimini mushrooms, finished with a drizzle of truffle oil. The Mezza Luna is a little lighter with eggplant purée instead of sauce and fresh mozzarella, gaeta olives and arugula. Can't decide? They even let you do half and half!For the meat eaters in your party, you can never go wrong with the Prosciutto di Parma and Arugula pie. If you don't mind the extra carbs be sure to ask for the breadsticks for the table (delicious Parmesan focaccia).As for dessert, I've tried the nutella pizza and the Romeo and Juliet dessert pizza. Nutella is great but if you want to try something different, the Romeo and Juliet is really special. They use amaretto ricotta and top it with amarena cherries, pistachios and dark chocolate shavings. Great served cold if you have any leftover to take home as well!San Giuseppes is BYOB so don't forget the wine! They do offer to arrange delivery of certain wines if you do forget.They have a free parking lot if you come in from out of town!Things to be worked on: Bring back the penne vodka!Calzone is not the size you expectService can be slow but is always friendly (need more experienced wait staff).",San Giuseppe,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

78,svFycHjXZYpNVutZ_0_gDQ,Jessica W.,2.0 star rating,"So after a long hiatus I tried again .. I'm all about giving things another chance. And the result was pretty much the same.We ordered the fig and prosciutto pie while it was tasty!! It was also lukewarm at best. I definitely don't order pizza to have to microwave it or reheat in the oven unless it for breakfast the following morning. It wasn't even a freezing cold night, the high of the day was 46 degrees and we had ordered by 8:15. If it was 5 degrees out, I could maybe give them a pass but this was NOT the case. I'm totally okay with the delivery fee but not for cold pizza, might as well walk there and work off the carbs if that's the case. Or order from somewhere else like I will next time, Napoli's always delivers hot pizzas.We also ordered a pasta dish, I didn't have any but I was told it was good but that it needed Parmesan cheese. I guess I'm confused why there was no cheese sent with the dish? It was a bolognese dish, if I was in the restaurant I certainly would have been offered parm cheese for the dish. Also no bread was sent, I've ordered plenty of meals for delivery and with pasta it's pretty customary for both cheese and bread to be sent alongside. I always feel this place is cutting corners and pinching pennies. That's okay to do in practice but it shouldn't shine through to the customer, it's not as if the food is particularly inexpensive. For the quality it's a bit more expensive than it should be, but in an appropriate range if the service and presentation were up to standard. I'm definitely done with ordering from here and can say I won't be coming in to try it in the restaurant. It's a shame because this place has potential but the consistent errors and the last time I had an issue management contacted through yelp and was more accusatory and defensive then apologetic. Not really the best customer service.I hadn't gotten around to responding to Joe, but here is the response. I ordered the caprese, I considered that a salad option and it was 13.95, also you reference your salads are from 8.95-9.95 this is clearly untrue its 8.95-10.95 if you are going to refute what I said and try to correct me, as the manager you should be familiar with your menu and have correct pricing. Additionally if you view the picture of the cheeses, there are about 9 small pcs of cheese, to me that isn't really a fair portion for the pricing.

Hoboken has a history of being quintessentially Italian-American and the worst casualty of that heritage is its food. The ""Italian"" food in Hoboken is notoriously bad. This restaurant is no exception. I ordered a pizza with butternut squash purée and truffle oil. In theory, fantastic. I asked if it was thin crust and was told yes. It wasn't (although in all fairness better than most in Hoboken). The purée was overly sweet and is muddled by the truffle taste. The whole thing is a mess.I also ordered a Bolognese which turned out to be the worst Bolognese I've ever had. I'm completely serious. It tasted as though it had taken 10 minutes to cook and was over-powered by a tomato taste. The pasta was over cooked and starchy. Really appalling. Those two items plus tip cost about $60. Ridiculous.Don't be fooled by the propaganda. This place is no better than any corner pizzeria, but costs about 4 times as much. Shameful.",San Giuseppe,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

Please accept this candid feedback from a customer that just wants you to make improvements so you get repeat business. The pizza and pastas are actually very good. That said, the service needs to get much better. Whether it's take out or dining in, no one ever thanks you for your patronage. It feels like I'm always thanking them. Every time I get take out, I'm just handed my food with a stark stare, no smile whatsoever, ever! The owner should encourage the cashiers to thank patrons as they are handing the food. So easy. As far as waiters go, they work hard but then they'll make the oddest and most obnoxious comments, such as ""wow! you guys had a ton of carbs tonight"" or ""wow! you guys ordered a lot of food; is this your cheat night!?""  Seriously Mr Waiter? Does your boss train you to make comments like that instead of saying thank you for dining with us. It's uncalled for. And My wife, friends and I are fit. I can't imagine how a person struggling with their weight/health would feel if they heard these comments from their waiters. So please Mr Owner, train your staff to be a little bit friendlier and polite, and to show appreciation to your patrons. A smile and thank you goes a long way and it requires minimal effort.

And tables will be available for about 5 minutes before they seat people.  All this while we are watching about 5 parties got seated.  Finally it's our turn and again they had to wait I don't know for what and finally after about 5 minutes, she asked if we want to sit there.  ???  Seriously.I was so ready for my wine at that point.  And then our waiter came by to tell us and they ran out of wine glasses!! And told us to use champagne glasses.  Ok whatever.  Another 10 minutes passed, I'm drinking my wine in an empty stomach and finally someone gave us out menus.  I do enjoy the complimentary warm bread they serve.Food is decent, not mind blowing.  We got the chicken wings, pasta with vodka sauce and Sierra pasta.  Nothing too special.  Maybe we should have ordered pizza but I didn't feel like paying around $20 for pizza.And at the end, they didn't offer us dessert either.  Just felt we were second class citizens.  Maybe because we didn't have reservation or something.  Not sure.  Oh well.",San Giuseppe,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

I""ve been teetering between 4 and 5 stars on this place and I've finally decided to give San G some five star love and here's why. Food = 4 stars.Value = 4 starsParking = 5 starsBYO = 5 starsWhat brings this bad boy up to five from 4.5 is the chef/owner who comes out to to thank his guests for eating and truly cares about his customers, the food and the community.Lets chat about the pros:1. Free parking in Hoboken. Yes, it's true.2. BYOB3. The food is fantastic. Very simple, light and amazing. I've sampled the pastas and the pizza. I find the pizza to be absolutely amazing. The eggplant puree and the prosciutto with figs have been my favorite but with this thin crust pizza, you can't go wrong. The gnocchi is amazing and the buena serra with chicken, sausage and a balsamic sauce rather than the tomato is out of this world. 4. Service is good. So friendly and amicable. The food does take a while to come out but, everything is served completely freshly made so, pizza takes awhile, I get it.5. Ambiance is nice. Far from trendy but similar to the food, it's authentic. Cons:1. I can say price/portion size may be a bit off. My one minor complaint was that the salad was pretty tiny for the price. It was filled with fresh parmagiana, olives and white beans but, not a lot of greens itself. I think that was my only disappointment with the meal. With both the pasta and pizza dishes, you can taste the quality ingredients. I also think I'm used to Jersey City prices which clearly, it's just cheaper. Overall, San Guiseppe's the perfect place for a carb loaded night out when you're looking for great eats, Go.",San Giuseppe,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

This place is by far the classiest pizza / Italian place in Hoboken, especially compared to Dozzinos or Grimaldi's. you can actually have a conversation here too, if you are into that kinda thing. The place is BYOB, but be prepared, the nearest place to get liquor is the Shoprite, however, they do have a large liquor menu from Augies, which will deliver to the restaurant. They start you off with some delicious flatbread with cheese, oil, butter, and herbs. Really nice. We went with the wings and Tuscan salad to start. The wings are truly unique with the dry rub and smothered with caramelized onions. Can't say I've seen that before. As far as the wings go, they are good and worth trying, but I'm not sure I'd order them again. The salad was a bit different with the chickpeas, but let's keep things in perspective here; it's a salad. For our pizza, we went for the L'Italiana, which has fontina, butternut squash purée, mushrooms, and truffle oil. This is a hearty and hefty pizza. The flavors were nice, but we were hoping it would be like all the other pizzas we saw that were super thin and light looking. If you order this, expect to take home leftovers. Near the end of the meal, the man who was cooking the pizzas, who I have to assume is either the head chef, owner, or both, came around to every single table to ask how everything was. This type of attention and reaching out to customers is worth so much to a business, and speaks so much as to the type of place it is. I really commend him for this, and hope he keeps it up as a regular habit. All customers appreciate this.

The pesto pasta was just ok but not memorable. I asked for a side of Pecorino Romano, and was brought something that looked/tasted more like a lifeless Parmesan.

Small piece of chicken that had an old oily taste and doesn't come with homemade pasta. M on Washington has the best - double the amount of chicken, awesome seasoning, and comes with homemade pasta instead of bland,cheap potatoes and carrots.  They also skimped me on the mozzarella and charged me 3 bucks extra.

I also had the Romeo and Juliet dessert pizza which had a fantastic combination of ingredients- delicious ricotta, amaretto, chocolate shavings, pistachio and cherries.

Seriously, I have not yet been disappointed by either of these orders. I strayed once and my party ordered 2 different pasta dishes- I was disappointed and would not order pasta from here again.I am taking off a star due to the customer service. The first time I came here, we waited for a few minutes to be acknowledged even though the restaurant had just opened for the day, and there were multiple employees running around and no other customers there yet. The hostess finally addressed us, but it was like she wasn't having a good day- she didn't smile and seemed annoyed to be there. The entire time that we were there, I don't think I saw her smile or look remotely happy once.One of the times I ordered to go, I called ahead and got my usual (coal-fired chicken wings, and the Prosciutto di Parma & Figs (or dates, if figs are not in season). The time before, San Giuseppe was using dates on the pizza (not complaining-love them with this pizza). As I was on the phone with the hostess, I asked her if they were using dates or figs on that particular day. She said figs.

So here it is folks - hands down best pizza in a coal fired oven no less! Crust had just the right amount of chew and crisp. We did the pepperoni and garlic and also the fontina and mushrooms. Both were delicious! As an appetizer we had the wings and a salad. The wings were also amazing. Carmelized onions and crispy wings with just the right amount of seasoning. We sat outside yesterday - first day of outdoor seating, which was a real treat. The owner was super sweet. Told us they do tapas on Wednesday and Thursdays, so we can't wait to come back for that.

I've been here a few times and I've never had anything bad.  It is BYOB which of course is always a win for me.The food is delicious it's mostly solid Italian dishes nothing too out there and crazy, but all what seems to be fresh ingredients. They have a brick oven which I like. I've had everything from the gnocchi to pizza and nothing has been ""meh"" but nothing has sent me screaming down Adams Street in joyous celebration. We got the prosciutto and arugula pizza one night and there was just too much arugula on it, it was hard to even see the pizza it was just thrown on top, not baked into the pie. So that had a perk that we were able to pick the excess off, but that seemed like it was just being called in when you throw it on top like a parsley garnish.  But, the service is pretty good. The big perk is they have a parking lot...in Hoboken, true story. So that's nice. The only thing I don't like about it is the interior it just reminds me too much of a suburban Olive Garden.But, it's way uptown, has a parking lot, BYOB and solid food.

133,sTZpGCVW9igIZXs328EqYg,Cici L.,2.0 star rating,"Based on rave reviews from my friend and all of the positives reviews on Yelp, I was excited to come here on a Friday night to try out their food. Unfortunately, this place left me wishing I went to my original choice of Napoli's*.Service: Came here on a Friday night.  All the tables were filled outside but upon entering the place, there were at least 4 tables available.  When we entered, a few servers looked at us, but continued with what they were doing; it took a good minute or so for someone to come to the door and acknowledge us.  When we were finally seated, our utensils, plate, and napkin came piecemeal - the waiter seemed visibly annoyed that it took me a few seconds to pick up my menu so he could put my plate on the table.  When a waiter finally came to take our order, they just said ""do you know what you want?"" - they didn't tell us any specials, what they'd recommend on the menu, or even just speak with a smile.  Likewise, the waiter was so busy cooing over another customer's baby, it took them over 5 minutes after we ordered to bring us water, and only after we asked twice.  The only time the waiter seemed to be nice to us was when we asked for the check, and instead of giving it to us, suggested we order dessert.Food: We ordered two different pasta dishes, that unfortunately were just mediocre.  The penne alla vodka dish was my favorite, although the chicken was dry and bland.  The gnocchi was too dense, with the same bland chicken.Ambiance: The decor in the restaurant was cute and had a rustic Italian feel.  The lighting was dim and would be a good date place, if you could get past the service.*to sum up my service experience: I essentially wrote this entire review while waiting for my check.",San Giuseppe,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

Highly recommend the pizza with butternut squash, fontina, mushrooms and truffle oil.  Sounds like a crazy combo but really worked. Sweet and earthy and salty. I was less impressed by the pasta bueno sera. It was good, just not as stellar as the pizza. Service was quite attentive (borderline too fast and pushy--for example, he came to take our order 3 times while I was clearly still engrossed in reading the menu!). However, I was disappointed that I had noted on my open table reservation that it was my boyfriend's birthday, yet there was no acknowledgement.  We only ordered dessert because I thought they'd need a vehicle for a candle!  Had I known they would ignore the birthday occasion I would have skipped the (quite average) cheesecake.

136,iLV5py7Nwwwk6OivcY2DGg,Jeff B.,1.0 star rating,"So so so disappointed that I have to write this review to downgrade my previous rating, but I think Sunday night, I visited San Guiseppe for my final time after the experience.  The issues with service have been ongoing for a very long time and even though the food is mostly awesome, this continual service problem is just too hard to ignore. I've been to the restaurant around 20 times, and while the food is always amazing and the service is almost always disappointing, I continue to return because of the food quality.  Tonight, however, was the final straw after the worst service experience while going here, and the food was off a little as well.  After arriving, we were sat at a table with menus and we didn't even have anyone come over for a good 10 minutes until one of the waiters came over and said that our waiter would be over shortly.  She (the person who wasn't our waiter) took our drink order of 2 diet cokes and appetizer of coal fired chicken wings.  When our server finally came over about 10 minutes later, we gave him the order and asked for bread.  The first server then came back with cokes instead of diet cokes.  I didn't think it was a big deal but was hoping it wasn't a precursor of things to come, which it actually turned out to be.  Fifteen or so minutes later he (the actual waiter) came over with the bread, but only after I asked his co-worker server if she could please ask him for us.  Once that came, I figured our wings would be along for the appetizer any minute.  However, one of our dinners came out instead before the wing appetizer.  Normally we would send it back but didn't want to take a chance it would sit around since it was grilled chicken on top of a salad. Then eventually the wings came (which were actually a little dried out this night, which I've never experienced here), and shortly afterward the final meal.  The sauce on this nice in the main meal was also a little off and not the same quality as I'm used to.The server asks me, if I would like more bread to which I replied ""yes.""  So after this the guy never came back to the table to bring my bread, ask if we wanted more to drink, or even check in.  I had to literally walk up to the counter and find him and ask him to bring our check.  Then it was his co-worker and not even him who came to the table to wrap the leftover food and bring us our check.  Then it was also his co-worker who came to the table to take my payment and bring me back my receipt to sign.  Then this guy comes over near the table to stand nearby watching as if he's just waiting for me to fill out the receipt.  I waited until he left though because I was giving a very small tip.As a former waiter myself, I understand what it takes to wait table and give good service.  Knowing this, I often give $20 even on a $50 check.  But definitely not on this night!  The guy came to the table hardly at all and never checked back, and I had to track him down.  His co-worker helped us much much more than he did.  I would understand if the restaurant was busy, but there were 4 tables in the place w/customers - there was hardly anyone there yet.  And, the times he did come to the table, he was trying to be all cheery and joke around, as if he could sense we were unhappy.  Just better service would have done the trick instead of trying to pry a smile out of us by staring us down and continuing to try joking around.  It was actually a little creepy.Very very frustrated, I am, about this place.  I want to love it because of the food but just can't!  Now I know the owner will message me back here on Yelp and tell me they are always at the restaurant to speak to if there are issues, or they may ask me to call them.  The truth is though, until someone has better oversight over the waitstaff, nothing I can say to them will help the situation.  =(",San Giuseppe,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

To our surprise on Valentines Day it was a Price Fixe only Menu (no one mentioned it when the reservation was made the day before). When asked for the fig and prosciutto pizza that we order quite often we were told by the owner (*through the waiter) that they only had the ingredients that were on the price fixe menu. QUITE COMICAL considering there were 4 delivery people standing next to our table taking orders out throughout our meal. We considered just ordering delivery/to go to get what we came for but we mistakenly decided to stay for a $50 per person meal. The lasagna was reheated and a comical portion size.The creme breluee wasn't even torched and was not edible!!!  it was still in hard sugar form. Ive had no problem paying $20+ for their pizzas. Price Fixe on valentines day is always a rip off but this one certainly was the worst. Ive never felt so ripped off at a restaurant before - price fixe or otherwise.As regular customers we are extremely disappointed.

Low-key, relaxing vibe, contemporary decor with high ceilings, open counter with coal oven. Brought our own wine. Plenty of parking. My GPS led to the address which was not the entrance to the restaurant. You have to go past the address and make a left into the strip-mall. Now, on to the food. We had to try the wings, being that there was a trophy there and all. These are not hot wings; they are crispy, dry-rubbed wings covered in sauteed onions. I couldn't figure out how you're supposed to hold the wings and balance the onions on them, but believe me, you find a way. So good!My husband and I shared a margherita pie with prosciutto and hot cherry peppers. Very highly recommend. It was covered in thin slices of prosciutto and those spicy peppers were so sweet and delicious, they made the pizza. We saved room for a dessert pizza which had shaved apples, walnuts, brown sugar and vanilla icing drizzled over it. It really was so delicious.Our server, Nicole, was the best. She had great recommendations, she was professional, and she also was a very nice person. Nicole really wanted us to enjoy our time there. A true asset to the restaurant.

142,oMVnqtBt63iYlZAxPoHbIA,Donna F.,4.0 star rating,"I'd like to give this place 4.5 stars if I could. I was first here around Valentine's Day, but that was before I gave a crap about my Yelp account, so I'm writing about my more recent experience instead.I went here with my boyfriend and his mom for a Sunday evening dinner right before Thanksgiving (11/24) after we escaped from the madness of Elizabeth's IKEA. We got there a little after 5 PM and were surprised to see it was completely empty inside. (Later, we realized why: the restaurant opened at 5). Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, and brought us fresh bread immediately. I loved the texture of the bread: warm and crisp on the outside but mealy on the inside. For an appetizer, I ordered their arugula salad with mozzarella and grape tomatoes with a balsamic/olive oil dressing. I tore through it in minutes, mostly because I was hungry (shopping at IKEA is serious business, y'all), but also because it was extremely tasty. The mozzarella was soft but not mushy, with a sweet flavor, and the arugula was a vibrant shade of green with a tangy aftertaste.For our main courses, my boyfriend ordered the gnocchi pesto, his mom ordered penne alla vodka  (minus the prosciutto, because she's not a fan of ham), and I ordered the spaghetti al pomodoro with tomato and basil. It didn't take long for our meals to come out. (Again, maybe it's because we were the only ones in the place, but I'm not complaining). Our waiter made sure our water glasses were refilled, and he stopped by to check on us at strategic moments during our meals. (Meaning, he came to see how we were doing when our mouths weren't full or in the midst of swallowing water). I get annoyed at waiters who ask you how the food is when you're shoving a forkful of stuff into your mouth. This guy knew better.I can't speak for my boyfriend or his mom, but my dinner was fabulous. The sauce was served rustic-style (which I love), and the basil was a nice touch. It didn't overpower the flavor of the dish, but it added an undercurrent of fresh herbal zest to the sauce.I didn't think I was hungry for dessert, but it turned out I was. I decided to get the tiramisu and split it with my boyfriend's mom, while he tried the profitteroles (sic?).  The tiramisu was deceptively light and very good. I didn't ask, but I have a feeling it was from a homemade recipe. Also, I'm not usually a fan of profitteroles, as they're usually too lardy or hard, with way too much cream inside. But these were soft, light on the stomach, and with just the right amount of cream. They were also drizzled with chocolate sauce, which was a plus.So, if I really enjoyed myself at this place, why am I giving it four stars? It was chilly inside, and they sat us near the door, where the delivery guy kept running in and out. Oh well. I'll definitely be back for another delicious Italian dinner.",San Giuseppe,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

And from the view of someone behind the scene.  Let me tell you that freshness, cleanliness and quality is a must when working there. I saw some reviews about the service and yes some servers mite be haveing a bad day but thats because the pressure of san guiseppes standards are high. If something aint right then you throw it away and make it right, and fresh at that. Some servers just cant cut it.

159,JFtCfwvXUviyp9PHc5iU4w,Kristen P.,3.0 star rating,"3.5 stars, 0.5 for being BYOB.Location-wise it is definitely off the beaten path in terms of restaurants in Hoboken. It's in a building of 3 or 4 store fronts, almost like a mini strip-mall feel across the street from the Hoboken Movie Theatre. The plus of this location is that there is a parking lot if you don't feel like walking all the way to 14th street. I also think it's a plus because it's a little hidden, and therefore I never have to wait for a table ;)I've been to San Giuseppe's before and had a pleasant experience. However, you have to know what to order otherwise you might not have the same luck....What makes San Giuseppe's special is their coal fueled brick (assuming?) oven. Therefore, when you go make sure you order a coal-fired pizza, or the coal-fired wings or something that's cooked in said oven. The pasta entrees are rather over-priced and underwhelming. Their salads are fresh and satisfying, but not mind-blowing.My boyfriend and I came here for a date night (with a Groupon for $15 for $30 worth of food...in this case a TOTAL steal.) We arrived at 7:30PM on a Tuesday night. There were 3 out of 20 or so tables occupied: one table of two or three two tops pushed together to accommodate a family with small children, another table of 4 of adults, and a 2 top with a 20-something couple. We were seated at an awkward corner table by the window, but since there were so many other two-tops available I moved to another 5 ft. away in a more central location (not face-level next to the restaurants light switches and security system panel). As we sat down we were greeted with two servers, the one who's table we declined, and the one who's table we were sitting at. The young man who's table we moved from was obviously not happy that we had moved, and made some sarcastic remarks about not wanting to be served by him which got the night off to an awkward start because I honestly couldn't tell if he was joking or not.Luckily, our server was much more pleasant and made up for the other's unprofessional remarks. She was very sweet and knowledgeable of the menu. We ended up ordering the coal-fired wings ($13.95 for 10) and a large Margherita pie (14.50). The wings were delicious. Baked in the coal-fired oven, they had a spicy rustic flavor and were topped with delicious but not overwhelming caramelized onions. The wings were definitely not too oily and were NOT coated with anything (such as flour) before baking (according to our waitress) as other reviews have claimed. The pizza was great as well. The crust was thinner than the average ""brick oven"" slice, but wasn't cracker-thin. The sauce was rich and the cheese was very fresh. We finished the whole pie!In the middle of our meal the two tops next to us were seated and we ended up having to talk loudly over two other conversations in order to hear each other, which was annoying considering how many other open tables their were in the restaurant.Since we had the Groupon, we ended up tipping the waitress 50% of the original bill because she really was extremely helpful and pleasant. I will definitely be going back as long as the weather is nice enough to walk the 26 minutes to get to 14th street from my apartment on 1st. TIPS TO THE OWNER/MANAGER: The two 2 tops in the corners of the two windows of the restaurant need to go. No one wants to be sitting at eye level with light switches in their face. Either put ONE two-top centered against each window, so both guests can face each other and see outside or try putting a 4 top in each space. It's not fair for the servers who have that section.",San Giuseppe,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

The coal-fired pizza is top notch - just enough char, but not too much.  The crust is the perfect combination of crispy and chewy and the tomato sauce is just a bit sweet.   It's not the slightest bit greasy or sloppy - you can eat it right out of the oven without being covered in juices.  Gramaldi's may have the history, but I think this pizza is better and its served in a ambiance that doesn't make you feel like you're offending them when you place an order.We also shared a pasta dish to start, which was very flavorful, cooked perfectly al dente and included a generous portion of excellent jumbo shrimp.The owner carefully watches over the pizza counter.  I think I only saw him peek into the main kitchen once or twice while we were there.   You can see that pizza is his passion and he takes great care in everything he touches.  He did take enough time to step into the dining room and make sure that each of his tables were happy and everyone genuinely looked as if they were enjoying themselves.Altogether a great addition to a town filled with mediocre pizza joints - it certainly stands out above the rest.  Relative to the other places in the area, it's certainly 5 stars...compared to some of the best of the best across the river, maybe 4.5.   Regardless, I'll be back.Hey, and it's got parking!",San Giuseppe,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

For our entrees we had gnocchi with pesto sauce-good pesto, not over whelming, but the gnocchi could have been cooked a pinch more. The papardelle with veal bolognese was very good.

The good thing is if you around and have booze this place is BYOB.Started with their famous and different style chicken wings. It was an interesting experience to have caramalized onions over wings, however I am of the opinion that wings should have a little bit of fire&kick in it. Not bad though.The main course bombed big time. The pastas were terribly bland and no great taste. I don't know if these are preparations of a specific area in Italy but all I can say is they didn't taste good.

I'm sorry to say that that was the low point of the meal... they were okay, but kind of dry, and could use a little something else, like maybe Gorgonzola crumbles. We finished them, but I don't think that we'll be ordering it again. But our entrees more than made up for our appetizer. My boyfriend got the Sunday sauce, and I got the Bolognese. Each tasted fresh, delicious, and the portion size was perfect - not too much, and not too little. We were both really happy with our meals.

Also, the location is very convenient if you are looking for a lovely, scrumptious dinner before or after a movie (i.e., the new Clearview Cinemas are right next door).So, when you go to San Giuseppe, you should be prepared to indulge on Italian food goodness! My friends and I started off with two appetizers- a cheese plate and burrata. Let me tell you, the burrata was creamy and delectable. Yum! And the cheese plate was a great starter for the main dish to come. For my main dish, I had the gnocchi with pesto sauce. The portion was perfect in that it was just enough for me to feel satisfied without being too full. The dish was creamy and seasoned so well. I definitely would have that again.We shared 2 desserts- the profiteroles and the Baci sweet pizza. We started with the profiteroles, which were amazing. Again, they were just right the three of us, a beautiful cap to a wonderful meal. But then, the sweet pizza came. Not only was it incredibly delicious, it was also aesthetically pleasing. The Baci pizza is made with nutella and strawberries sprinkled with powdered sugar. This dessert was very refreshing and big enough to be shared by 3-5 people (depending on how full you are) so no guilt about eating a dessert on your own:)I would definitely return to San Giuseppe.

The chef/owner is on the premises (such a rarity these days) making the pizza and greeting the customers. As any true Italian pizza maker would do, he uses ""00"" flour which gives the pizza crust a nice texture with a light and airy consistency. In other words its like the pizza you get in Italy. Absolutely DELICIOUS! And after just coming from eating at DiFara's Pizza in Brooklyn and trying every pizza place in this town, San Guiseppe delivers the best pizza in Hoboken by far!!The modern yet homey restaurant, is a nice sized place with high ceilings and warm colors. It is beautifully lit by real tealight candles that are placed on every table. All these attributes make you feel welcomed. They start you off with homemade Parmesan flatbreads, again delicious. It's BYOB, so they cork and place your wine in large stainless steel buckets...is this place really in a strip mall and not on 5th avenue?! Such details like large wine glasses and a glass carafe of water on the table, make this place truly a welcomed pleasure in a town where restaurants constantly miss the mark.Besides the pizza, we also had the tricolor salad with fresh shavings of Parmesan (really nice honey dressing, they actually use good quality olive oil), the Nonna pasta dish (brasiole, small meatballs and sausage over ziti) and the Orrechettie pasta with fresh tomato, peas and sweet sausage in a light white wine sauce. Everything was extremely fresh and the quality you get here is way better than any restaurant on Washington Street. One thing I would like to see maybe as specials or eventually on the menu is a few more protein options. Doesn't have to be many but a chicken, fish and steak dish would be the perfect addition to the menu.Living right down the block, this place has become an instant favorite. I'm so glad to have a restaurant of this caliber ""back here"" in Uptown Hoboken. My family and I loved the food, ambiance and the cozy, warm feeling you got from the decor and the staff.

206,3CUhfaH5PRxqVAtx1yegJA,Bryan C.,5.0 star rating,"This place is fantastic and an example of Groupon working for a business. The restaurant is in a small strip mall tucked away near the Clearview Cinemas....I may not have known about it without the Groupon, but I'm really glad I checked it out. The ambiance is great, with a huge coal-fired oven taking center-stage inside. There is also ample parking and outdoor seating. The staff was great and the owner was accommodating and enthusiastic while he spoke with us and helped man the oven.First, it's BYOB...a Hoboken staple and great start to the meal. Bring whatever you want and enjoy it with your meals. No corking fees or issues. We started with the coal-fired chicken wings, a must-order if you like wings. The portion size was generous for two or more people to split...12+ wings. The wings are crispy, slightly charred, and moist on the inside. They come with carmelized Vidalia onions that provide a great sweet, soft complement to the wings.We decided to split a pasta entree and a pizza. The entree was a family recipe called Sugo Delle Nonne. The pasta had meatballs with raisins and pine nuts...a delicious and unique interpretation of an Italian classic. The pizza (Quattro Stagioni) had prosciutto and a variety of cooked vegetables. The crust was perfect and the combination of favors was very nice. We left the meal with leftovers, a rarity for us, and will definitely be going back. Check this place out....great people and a great place.",San Giuseppe,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

Ding! Ding! Ding!  Thin pieces of prosciutto and fresh baby arugula layered over a crispy thin crust with tomato sauce, sprinkled with parmigianno reggiano.  Mmmm, mmm good.  The fig pie is worth a spin too.  I don't like figs but thoroughly enjoyed shoveling this tasty pie down.We ordered take out the other night.  Say what? You don't deliver to my area?! Blasphemy!  Prosciutto di Parma & Arugula pie - Need I say more?Veal Parm served with Linguine al Pomodoro - Good.   Probably would order it again.Last but not least, we were given pieces of soft warm garlic flatbread sprinkled with salt and parm.  How did you steer me wrong the first time?  Where were my delicious morsels of glutenous extra carbs?  If they don't serve these during dinner, then they are cray-cray.",San Giuseppe,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"
208,kqf8TrANaU5j1gk_eBWIUA,Maritsa T.,5.0 star rating,"I can not be happier that a friend of mine suggested we try San Giuseppe's! Oddly I am a Manhattan girl that has visited many Italian restaurants in neighboring areas such as Stamford, White Plains, and now Hoboken. In comparison, as others have mentioned San Giuseppe's provides an upscale ambiance while offering a great value. I love the high ceilings which I believe added an intimate feel; obviously something that is hard to achieve at many NYC restaurants due to the close seating.Of course I wouldn't be this pleased if the food was not delicious! To start we ordered one of the Burrata, an appetizer special. This was my first-time trying Burrata which was so creamy and delicious with the warm bread provided. The Burrata was presented on a bed of salad which was dressed with a vinaigrette of sorts for those who did not want to pair it with bread. We also had the cheese plate and I was very pleased that there were apple slices to help cleanse your palate. Of course with all this cheese the Waiter happily provided us with more bread. I then ordered the pasta amore, which I must admit was based on a review I found online. I absolutely loved the inclusion of peas, and  unlike the reviewer I had enough sausage for the portion I took home. And I am very glad I decided to take some pasta home to save room for dessert. Now this was dinner with my girlfriend so we went big on dessert. We had the profiteroles and a dessert pizza. The profiteroles were yummy with the chocolate drizzle but nothing beats the fresh strawberries on top of nutella dessert pizza!I was so please with my dessert pizza I can not wait to visit San Giuseppe's again to try one of the savory coal fired pizzas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",San Giuseppe,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"

My wife liked the pizza, I thought it was tasteless, asked for sausage on half, covered the whole thing with minuscule pieces. Paid for extra fresh parmigiana graded over the whole pizza. Not there. Basil looked like it was from a box store bulk container of shredded morsels. Tuscan salad was fresh as far as the lettuce went, but the other ingredients were old, soggy and tasteless. Wendy's and McDonalds have superior salads to this. Tortino's frozen pizza at Walmart beats these pizzas. Save your money and order a Domino's.",San Giuseppe,3.5 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Pizza"
