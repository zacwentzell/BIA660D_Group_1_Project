Don't the lines fool you; you will be in and out faster then that tinder date you went on last week.  Healthy options abound. The veggies are all very good and although the flavors are boring, sometimes boring is what you need, Mary. The roasted brussels sprouts (nicely charred and seasoned) are the fav for this folio followed by the broccoli and kale, which are equally simply cooked and tasty.   The combo meals are relatively cheap ($10ish and below for a small) for lunch considering it's one of the healthiest options around the area and ""healthier"" tends to come with a heavier price tag. I usually come here and when it's a ""veggie lunch"" kind of day, which means mid week and not only is it filling, it's under $9. If you need to cheat with an animal option that will cost a little more. Meat options might kill you eventually, but they are good here. The meatballs are my least favorite, due to it's odd flavor, but it's edible. The wild salmon is a nice option, but it's extra. Ditto for the avocado option, but you knew that already. The chicken and flank steak are both solid, with the steak the clear front runner for this wolf in sheeps clothing. I don't run here looking forward to an exciting lunch, but I do appreciate their speed, value and quality. It also makes me think I might live a little longer.

Sometimes Dig Inn can be too hipster-food-palate for my taste though... what does that mean? Well, it's like when they can't serve you a type of food without a 'surprise' flavor shoved in there. Like, sometimes all I want is carrots... not carrots rolled in ""pumpkin seed pesto."" Or like, sometimes all I want is meatballs without ""apricot chutney"" lousing it up. Am I super boring? Yes! Yes, sometimes I am goddamnit. I don't always want a damn flavor medley, sometimes I just want the food I'm ordering. BUT, at the end of the day, Dig Inn at least makes stuff that mostly tastes great and the best is they're always consistent. It's especially surprising to me how consistent they are considering they're using locally sourced food, but they rarely seem to run out of items. This location in particular gets crazy packed so I mostly order in or order for pick up. They're pretty accurate on their delivery times and easy enough to navigate for pick ups.I am a chicken + faro fan, I like the portion control on the chicken and I just do my best not to eat all of the faro because otherwise I feel painfully full... but dang, are they both good. Nice brown meat chicken piece with little to no gristle, cooked with some outside crunch. I adore the way they prepare their brussels sprouts - never bitter, always tasty. I'm also a big fan of the upstate mac & cheese which comes with a nice panko breadcrumb situation on top. Since the menu is seasonal my favs will come and go, but it kind of gives me something to look forward to the next time the season rolls around (ugh, is this what I've come to?

There aren't many quick bites in the area, but this spot is part of a small block of lunch spots in hudson square, including pret a manger, gregory's, hale & hearty, as well as others.Lately i've been frequenting this spot less and less because their portions have gotten ridiculously small (they switched to a bowl from tray style cartons) while still being pretty pricey. A typical lunch would cost about $13-15. Also, some of their dishes have gotten much too salty, which is kind of paradoxical to their healthy/organic angle. Nonetheless, I still do have some favorites at this spot - I enjoy the salmon, which comes with a tasty pesto/cilantro-y sauce. Also, they always have fresh veggie options and their mac & cheese is amaaaazing. Highly recommend the latter. Despite the crazy lunch rush during the week, the service here is quick even though I do think they skimp on portions even more during busy hours.

Got the charred chicken with mac & cheese and roasted squash. The food was definitely flavorful. And if there was a healthy element to it, then even better. The chicken was tasty but kind of skimpy on the portion. The mac and cheese was gooey but the cheese flavor was mild and the mac was limp. The squash was seasoned well but there was a big pool of grease on the bottom when I finished. I think the master (health) plan with this place is to give small protein portions but large portions of really filling veggie-based sides (mac & cheese definitely not a veg but definitely filling). All in all, a very heavy meal for summer. So if the co-workers decide to go again, I might have to wait until I need something that hearty.",Dig Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New)"

These meatballs are covered in tomato sauce and were satisfying nevertheless. - sides - I liked the lemony Brussels sprouts, charred greens, kale and quince salad.I wasn't crazy about the sweet potatoes which were a bit bland and not sweet.  The line during lunch hour gets pretty long but it moves at a reasonable pace.  The price for a small plate is $8.04 which is fairly ""cheap"" for this neighborhood.  I have always finished my plate which tells you the potions are not large but it's just enough for me.

The salmon was served with pesto and was VERY VERY good - no fishy taste, even with the skin on! The sweet potatoes were tasty, especially since they serve them with the skin on (the only way I enjoy them). The one flaw was the curried kale - the cook was heavy-handed with that salt.

96,EQPgp_WluL6Ufl7KZ7S0Sw,Dan R.,3.0 star rating,"Dig Inn virgins, I've got two recommendations for you:- Spicy Cabo Caesar Salad- Ginger Mint LemonadeI think I ordered this exact lunch maybe seventeen consecutive times before opting for something else because I was so damn satisfied with it. Roasted corn and queso fresco is really all it takes to win me over salad-wise, and that chipotle lime dressing ain't hurtin' either. Plus, that lemonade just gives me life. This is the lunch you get the day after your calorie-counting may have gotten away from you during a steakhouse dinner or pasta gorgefest. Which, as you can see by my approximation of placing this exact order seventeen times, I don't exactly have the same discipline come nightfall as I might have mid-day.Anyway, when i tried to risk my satisfaction streak, it was met with mixed results. The Greek Salad was decent, while the Spicy Pork Banh Mi was forgettable. You can assemble a plate of sides (probably the most popular option here among the busy lunch crowd), but it took me a few orders to find out which ones I liked - red lentil and edamame, baby spinach and mandarin, and lemon chicken as a combo ain't half-bad. Still, each time I wish I had that damn Spicy Cabo Caesar instead. The Spicy Cabo is just my shit.*They do have a few seasonal items on rotation (hence the Seasonal Market moniker), so I can't rule out fancying something new. They've also got some shakes and pressed juices if that's your thing. The staff is way nicer than a lunch spot like this ever needs to be. And the woodsy decor is charming, but I always catch myself staring at that weird, re-worked cigarette ad with the smiling couple out on some hike or something, where the cig is replaced with a big-ass carrot. Seasonal market humor, I suppose.For me, the options here seem limited, and if it weren't for the two items I so sincerely enjoy, I don't know if Dig Inn would remain in the lunch rotation. That said, if you do happen to follow my lead with the Spicy Cabo pick, take this final pro tip and keep the salad vegetarian. At nearly $3 extra, don't bother adding any protein here - the amount of meat is so measly, it's a joke.*Even if, truth be told, its name is totally misleading because it's really not spicy at all.",Dig Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New)"

You can get a plate of one protein and three sides for $10. It sounds like it might be a lot of food, but the portion sizes given to you are actually pretty small. You can also get sandwiches and salads instead of the plates.

While the food options are great and healthy, I feel their service is going down. Each time I come there seems to be a different process on what you can order, what costs extra. Not only that, the portions get smaller and smaller each time. Sometimes the server will scoop back if they think they scooped too much. They used to offer half avocados and now they cut it to a quarter. I just don't think it's worth the price  anymore.

Heck it's only like a dollar more expensive than getting a wrap (like I said I try to avoid) or a salad at the deli down the street which might seem like a quicker more affordable option when it actuality it's like $9. For exactly $10 at Dig Inn you chicken (some other meats more expensive, also tofu option or only sides option), either greens or a grain, and 2 sides.

So no, I don't have anything to compare it to, so you can judge me for that if you want (because I'm totally judging the two two start comments before me). Hah. =)First off, I will say that yes, this location is new. And as with all new stores, even a franchise, it takes time to kick it up to the level you're used to at other places. Because that store hired new employees who are still learning and everyone is working out the kinks. It happens people. There's a learning curve, cut them some slack maybe?So I like that fact that yes, I'm new so I go in and not really know what to expect. My first time there, it was fairly empty so I like that I was asked if it was my first time there, was explained how it worked by a beautiful, smiling employee, and was not rushed when I went down the line eying everything.I like the many choices, I like the flavoring I like how healthy it is, I like how fresh it is, I like the prices, hell I even like the portions. No, they aren't heapfuls, but honestly a good-sized amount for lunch. I like more food for dinner, so not quite sure if it'd be as fulfilling for me.I like that they have pressed juice (bottled), about five different kinds of iced tea, coconut water (bottled), kale chips, chocolates, and other little in-between snacks to munch on.I will say that when I went today, there was a mad line during lunch. I heard they're getting more and more people everyday - also something they're getting used to. But we had a large order, talked to the manager about how we tried to put the order through online but couldn't, so he took our 16 orders and rushed them through. Yes, Andrew, the manager is great - smart, courteous, funny, clearly cares about the costumers, the food and the store. He was thinking the online ordering system would hit in May.Addressing the low reviews, I will say this. The store is still revving up, so until the yelp reviews catch up, look at the number of people waiting to get their meal rather than the reviews here as a sign of how good they are.",Dig Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New)"

Dig Inn's new compartmented trays caused the latest snafu, so you're now able to get only three vegetable sides versus four previously.

Yesterday I finally managed to get there and upon entering, I was a little skeptical about the dishes, as nothing on the menu stood out to me. A gentleman who I presumed to be the manager greeted us immediately and allowed us time to browse the menu. When I inquired about a particular menu item, he asked if I had ever been to a Dig Inn before, When I told him no, he immediately began preparing samples for my friend and I. Of the five samples, there was only one which I thought was ""ok."" Everything else was packed with flavor! I finally decided on the braised beef over their specialty grain with roasted sweet potatoes and siracha string beans. The meal was amazing and, afterwards, I decided to get a dessert and drink. While at the counter, the same man attended to me and noticed a birthday button on my dress and he asked when my birthday was. I told him it was that day and as a result he gave me a free iced tea and cookies. I appreciated that so much.

However, this location uses an a la carte model that increases the cost to over $13 for the same thing. The service and food quality is on par with the other locations. However, the staff was insistent they were better value than the other locations because ""they pile it on."" I completely disagree with that statement since they basically put the same amount in the ""large"" container that would've fit in the ""small"" container. They are being dishonest or are just plain oblivious to what the competition is doing. Also, I don't understand why they need 20 people behind the counter and another one handing out menus that are unnecessary since the writing is on the wall. Lastly, they don't do the frequent eater punch cards. Total disservice to loyal customers like myself.

I was wrong and am actually really disappointed.Okay -- here's the thing. I like all the food Dig Inn has to offer. It is good. However, the plates situation is incredibly misleading.Everyone is saying you get a protein (and rice) and 3 sides for $10 -- this is complete B.S. I just went there and looked at the menu, and trying to understand the deal, I asked a person who worked there how many sides I can order for a big plate and she completely didn't answer my question. She said ""You pick what you want. You'll see them up front."" So, when I finally got to the front and saw all of the options, I had to decide quickly what looked good. If you've ever been to a Manhattan Chiptole or something, you might understand how they just rush you through as if you're a daily patron. Also, you'd better be open-minded to ingredients (which I am) because who knows what is chopped up in those sides. It's not like anyone is there to explain the ingredients to you.Anywho, I did what I thought was right -- I ordered 3 vegetables, and a protein. They charged me $13.50. What the hell?  Did they charge me for the vegetables as a plate and then extra for the protein? They put my meatballs in a random cylinder cup. I was so confused. The line was going so fast that I didn't even get a receipt and was basically pushed out the door.Honestly, that is WAY to much money for me too spend on lunch!

That's because when it comes to WAY overpriced, stuck up food places that think their food is better than it actually is, this place takes the cake. Yall, do not let them eat cake. (Getting Hungry, look out, you're probably next.)This place opened up a few weeks ago in the midst of increasingly frequent food trucks covering all KINDS of ground--waffle truck, kimchi taco truck, other exotic taco truck, lobster truck,  grilled cheese truck, straight up meat truck. If you're a new kid on the block you need to bring your A game. Dig Inn is comin at you with a solid C-.First time I went in, I was greeted by like 5 different people all telling me different stuff. Chill. The menu is about 6 feet tall on your wall and I'm not at Foot Locker. Let me live. I read through the menu and was like ok, I'm on my healthy tip so I'll get roast chicken with vegetables. Safe enough, right? Wrong. The roast chicken was chopped up in pieces and swimming in some brown sauce like a stew. What? Why? For what? So I went with the brisket. Which turned out to also be a stew. Suddenly I could hear Chipotle (my main man) whispering in my ear like, girl why are you even going around looking somewhere else when that good-good is right here?The sides. I got a salad the last time, but by the time I got back to work why did it even matter, because it was swimming in the beef stew masquerading as brisket. So I got a salad with beef stock dressing. But even then, I gave this place another chance, today. I knew to steer clear of the meat stews and got tofu with bok choy and brussel sprouts. Yo. WHY DOES EVERYTHING NEED TO BE CHOPPED UP? This is like a cafeteria for adult babies! The bok choy and brussel sprouts are both practically minced--I'm looking at my plate right now and literally cannot tell what's what. And both are swimming in an equally bitter...marinade? or something. The tofu is beyond bland--it's bitter too! But in this really mysterious way. Is it cumin? Too much garlic? Some kind of new age herb mix? I'm sittin here trying to figure out where this plate took a left turn and I just can't crack it. AND it's pricey.

147,mRydfzpHKIcInUIl4OoXLg,Devin S.,4.0 star rating,"Hey now, what's with all the hate around this place? Protip: when reviews are so crazy split between two extremes like this, the place has got to be new. It seems like the consensus here is:1-2 star = ""I had high hopes and they were ruined! RUINED!""4-5 star = ""This place is exactly what we needed in the area!""Obviously since I'm giving this place 4 stars I'm biased and maybe being a *little* mean to the 1-2 star people. But really, this is NOT a 1-2 star, it's at minimum a 3. The food is all fresh, good quality, and they stand by the idea of ""real"" ""healthy"" food - or at least they subscribe to my idea of real/healthy food, which includes basically anything that can be found in nature and served as a meal without too much lab science synthesis magic.I don't do big lunches, so 1- or 2-sides plus a main is generally enough for me, and I love them for making reasonable portions a real and easy option. My favorites from the sides I've tried are the broccoli & quinoa, strawberry & spinach salad, beets & goat cheese, and the orecchiette. Kale & apple salad is meh... not an inspired flavor combination in my opinion. All the meats I've tried so far (chicken, meatballs, braised beef) are good, but I almost always get the meatballs. They are reasonably spicy (for something you don't expect to be very spicy) and amazingly not heavy in your belly at all. They are probably the only meatballs I can eat regularly without any fear that I'll feel like crap later in the day as a result.It CAN get a bit pricey, but overall I think the food is worth it. The drinks maybe not so much - but the hot food platters, yes. I will say my one major disappointment here was the market veggie salad I got - it was DRENCHED in the balsamic dressing and there weren't very many veggies mixed in aside from the greens at all. I'll probably stick with the hot food bar.Lastly, the staff here are very nice and surprisingly efficient for how packed this place is. The line is always long, but moves pretty quickly even at peak lunch hours. If you don't want to wait at all, though, they strongly encourage online ordering. I've never done it, but I was given numerous fliers advertising it, and it seems like a good idea if you already know what you're going to want.",Dig Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New)"

I thought it was going to be a nice grilled chicken addition. False.False.False.False.It was like a dark meat stew thing with weird chickpeas and chives.IDK. NOT MY THING. I personally don't like dark meat chicken and I felt it was false advertising. Or just not clear. I was really anxious and didn't want to hand it back because she already dumped it into the little cup thing. But I regret it. Please be warned that it's dark meat chunks.

Cool ice cubes.I would give it 2 stars for this scarring chicken experience, but I was happy with the rest of my meal. So I will not be that mean.

It was evident that all of their workers were eating.I try to go again at 11:30 AM and again, the business is still not opened. Finally, I show up at Noon and they are ready for business. I get the delayed opening, it's new, it happens.What happened next, shouldn't have happened, this isn't their first shop, in fact it's their 6th. First, I go in and they need to explain to me how to get food, that's all well and good, but it needs to be self explanatory. Second, I notice that the trays for the salads are out waiting for people to pick up to hand over to the food handlers. This doesn't seem super sanitary to me. Third and what I was most peeved about was that the staff didn't seem to know what they were doing, it was like they weren't trained properly. For instance, I ordered a sandwich and no one told me that I had to pay for the sandwich where I ordered it. There were no instructions, nothing that really told people where to go or what to do.This particular location is a VERY busy lunch spot, you need to make sure your people are well trained and ready to handle this. The final straw was when we ordered sandwiches and they took 15 minutes to make. I could have gone to the grocery store, bought the food and made the sandwich in that time.I will try Dig Inn again because the food is worth it but I hope they iron out their growing pains soon or I won't be back due to the service.",Dig Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New)"

(quinoa, avocado, string beans, pumpkin, sauteed kale, beets, etc)people complain aboutt he portion size but it's a good amount of food for me. it's definitely not a heavy meal. depending on what you get, you'll be full if you get 2 portions of protein instead of 1, but they also have salads and sandwichesone downside, they don't have unsweetened ice tea so i have to run across the street to starbucks or pret next door for my drink.",Dig Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New)"

I like having variety on my plate which means ordering 3 sides - but to get 3 sides, I have to fill up a large plate here which ends up being a huge meal.There's no turkey as a protein at this storeNo guacamole either, instead you have to order half an avocado as a side for $2.30I do like:the service is fabulous here - really pleasant great people working herethe new teas are yummy - loved the black ginger iced teaThere are sandwiches and fresh made salads - haven't tried these to comment, but I like that there's a bigger variety of healthy choices.The lack of smaller plate option, and turkey are deal breakers for me.

I wandered into this restaurant after shopping in Soho with my dad and my daughter today (Sunday) and was really impressed with their selection of hot and cold vegetable sides.

My dad got the bahn mi sandwich, which he really liked, and my daughter got just 2 sides (tofu and green bean salad and red cabbage salad) and an avocado apple shake. The tofu was surprisingly flavorful and the avocado shake was perfect -- not too sweet but not overpowered by avocado either.The staff was friendly and we didn't wait long to get our food. The inside looks cool. I liked the area at the back selling local food products. They even had Rick's Picks (which are made in Brooklyn.

Obviously it's less crowded on the weekends (this area is always packed during weekday lunchtimes), but such is life.The first time I ordered the Spicy Pork Banh Mi and was super excited for the ""healthy"" (or just ""natural"", really) carnal and carnivorous meal I was about to encounter. Five minutes after I ordered it however, I was told by a staff member that they were out of the baguettes since it was Sunday, and could replace it with bread. Straight up sliced bread. It was nice of them to come up with an alternative, but Vietnamese goodness on bread that was two steps away from Wonder was some kind of blasphemy, I was sure of it. So instead I ordered the Wild Salmon Salad (I regret the mayo) with two sides: Roasted Beets with Lentils (hearty), and Red Cabbage with Coconut (but where's the coconut?!).But I resolved to get the Banh Mi, which I did just the other day. I brought it back to work and created quite the mess on my desk. It was a good size (8"" or so), with tender and meaty pork. Jalapenos, pickles, cilantro, pickled carrots and daikon.

192,S8eHppO6f1ghKS5tT3WsIA,Grace L.,1.0 star rating,"I come here occasionally to grab a quick lunch on the healthy side.  Ordered two salads to go last night and was very disappointed to find that they were missing ingredients.  The immunity salad had no grapes in it.  The Dig Inn Market salad had no butternut squash in it, but it had green string beans instead.  It was very bizarre and I was sorely disappointed because I had specifically ordered the Dig Inn for the butternut squash.  My husband kept looking for grapes in his immunity salad and only saw grape tomatoes.  He thought maybe he read the menu incorrectly, but when I went back to the website, it clearly states that the immunity has both grapes and grape tomatoes.  I hate paying for something and not getting what I paid for.  Next time, if I ever go back, I will have to open up the salad top and inspect it.  If they ran out of ingredients, they should have told me.  I would have added something else or gotten another salad.",Dig Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New)"
193,b2pg_HSigJZdPthph_g8QA,Zag B.,4.0 star rating,I have been coming to DIG INN for only a short while (8 or 9 months) and I literally can't stop.  I don't know how they manage to put the flavors together as you do but it's delicious.  I really enjoyed the Crispy Chicken sandwich w/ Avocadonaisse and was a little upset to find that there was a new menu.  As a result I wound up ordering the Cluk and Kale... my goodness.  Once again I have a favorite sandwich.  Everything there is so fresh and wonderfully blended.  I like the fresh fountain drinks as well.,Dig Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New)"
194,ENF46W-lgN8iWr29--xyJQ,Y S.,4.0 star rating,"This is a healthy, al desko lunch option in the Hudson Square area.  The lines for the prepared food options look manic, but are quite efficient.  The friendly staff, including Ayana at the register and the woman with the eyeglasses that asks whether you want a Small or Large platter, are really courteous, super hardworking and helpful.",Dig Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New)"
195,aa18Uuf1fcV1oZgwD2VhAg,Ira M.,3.0 star rating,"Healthy food, cafeteria style.  If you're looking for a quick bite or take for low cost this is probably your best bet in the area.  Think fast food without the fryers.  Several proteins and a variety of cooked and/or raw veggies.  Each choice is a blend of fresh ingredients (eg.  not simply grilled chicken).",Dig Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New)"

I've never heard of this chain, so I was a bit befuddled when I first wandered in and saw a line of people, but I'm glad I forged ahead. It's like a cheaper, ""fast food"" version of Westville Market. The fresh sides ($2.50 each, I believe) include kale/apple salad, spinach/berry salad, baked tofu, beets, cauldrons of sweet potatoes or b sprouts... basically vegetarian heaven. (There's also chicken and meat things.) Service was friendly. I'll be back for more greens.",Dig Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New)"
197,D7lmUvDDaGuyWYll7B6onA,Ziv N.,5.0 star rating,"I eat here 3-4 times a week. Yes, there are other or cheaper joints in the area, but the key to eating healthy is good ingredients + good taste + repetition. Dig Inn meets the first two requirements and tastes good enough so that the third one is easy.",Dig Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New)"
198,I7diXqoia1UK56u57z5q-w,Harper S.,4.0 star rating,"One of the best days in my office was when a colleague came in and said a new spot opened that was going to change our lives and boy was he right! This place is fantastic. Right across the street from Westville where I am a huge fan of their sides but this has more variety and more reasonably priced. The kale salad, quinoa with broccoli and the carrots with cherries were phenomenal. I don't even like cherries and I had the carrots twice in two days. Needless to say, totally reasonably priced and great portions. It's dangerous that this place is in my work/home hood. I'm going to be a regular, get ready for it.",Dig Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New)"
199,TWvbcmNq3FTPZl11uECFNg,Jeff R.,5.0 star rating,"Dig Inn is a fantastic place to get lunch or a quick dinner. Super healthy, delicious food. There's no two ways about it - this place is high quality. Some people may not like the options due to personal preference - but the dishes they serve achieve what they're going for, they're delicious, and healthy. Great service as well. Yes, it's a little bit of a zoo in there, but so what? Line moves quickly, friendly staff, my favorite lunch place in NYC. I go literally every day for lunch at work.",Dig Inn,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (New)"
