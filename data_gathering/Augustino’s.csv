1,92bYO8orpZ380qvyIHFEng,Melissa T.,4.0 star rating,"We came to Augustino's at 5:30PM on a Thursday (since that was all that was available for 4 weeks) before Christmas. The restaurant is tiny and I mean TINY but it gives a very welcoming, intimate vibe. One thing I noticed immediately was that the waitresses & the rest of the staff work together - at no point was I trying to flag down our waitress, because a different one was already willing to help. I was surprised to find that their wine bottles we're extremely reasonably priced. For apps we had the calamari and the stuffed artichoke, I wasn't impressed with the artichoke, but it was good. For dinner we had veal francaise and chicken Parmesan - both were very tasty. For desert we had the ice box cake and I'm still dreaming about it - this coming from a usual non desert eater.PS - no credit cards, bring ya cash!",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian
2,LcWOq7p7Mhtv9hIlDrhy9A,Mel T.,5.0 star rating,"Probably the best pork chop I've ever had in life. And I don't even like pork chops, so that's saying a lot. My boyfriend and I came in on a Saturday at 6 pm. Almost everything you've read is true - giant servings of pork chops that you won't be able to finish, cash only, and needing to make ressos weeks in advance. But I'm not sure about these other reviews saying that the staff was rude. They were super nice to us and made us feel like we had been going to Augustino's for years, even though it was just our first time there.To start, they give you some bread, as well as two complimentary pieces of bruschetta with tomatoes. This was amazing. I could have just eaten a whole plate of these for dinner. We also ordered the clams casino to start, which are clams on the half shell with breadcrumbs and bacon. Can't really go wrong with anything with bacon in it.To drink, we decided to order their $20 bottle of riesling that everyone was talking about. It was too sweet for us, but it's a pretty good value if you like sweet wine. Augustino's is not BYOB but their other bottles are pretty reasonably priced as well.For entrees, he ordered the Breaded Pork Chops with Vinegar and Hot Peppers. This came out sizzling, as two thick pieces. I ordered their special of the day, which was a Prime Ribeye cooked in a spicy tomato sauce. This was a huge piece as well, and I was only able to finish about half of it. Entrees come with a small side of pasta in marinara sauce.Tip - they charge $5 for sharing dishes so you might as well just order your own and take the rest home for lunch the next day.",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian
3,nqrS1GYyYtyvQmvPnpkyMQ,Mitch C.,5.0 star rating,My wife and I have been to all the great Italian restaurants in the city and Augustino's gives them a run for their money. We had an incredible night there with another couple who live in Hoboken. This was easily the best restaurant we've been to (Anthony David's a close second if you can't get reservations here). Before we get to the food I have to say the staff is amazing. Not sure if this is a family business but they seem like one big family. They are all fantastic and happy to help make decisions for you or tell you that you are ordering wrong. I gave our waitress two options and she knew what I needed. My breaded pork chops with vinegar and hot peppers was one of the best pork chop dishes I've ever had. Two double cut pork chops (one came home with me)!  Everyone else had amazing dishes but if you like pork chops I say go for it. The complimentary Bruschetta was great and the appetizers were good but I'd suggest skipping them and saving room for your meal and dessertPrices are also super reasonable,Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian
4,Jfn08iBR3uZnFx1rqz0qTQ,Melissa W.,3.0 star rating,"This review is based on eating at Augustino's three times.  The food is outstanding and maybe the best Italian you'll ever have.  That said, the service is awful and obnoxious.  The owners, bar tenders and servers are all very aggressive and short.  If you want to make a reservation, know exactly when you are willing to eat because they have limited availability and the whole call will last less than thirty seconds.  Once the owner accused us of not calling ahead, when in fact we had called twice to confirm.You also have to understand ""Augustino's speak"".  For example, they will offer you water - sparking, flat or Hoboken's finest.  We misinterpreted the last two to be the same thing since most places around here don't offer bottled flat water.  The waitress seemed annoyed when we clarified that we were fine with tap.  When specials are listed, servers often don't mention the price but we would have appreciated a heads up that our order was nearly double the price of the average entrée on the menu.  Lastly, we interpreted ""all set"" meant that they could take our payment.  It is courtesy in the industry to always bring back change even if the customer doesn't ask for it explicitly.  We were shocked that she assumed we were leaving a 30%+ tip, especially when we only ordered two items and didn't ask for anything extraordinary.During all the meals we felt uncomfortable and uneasy to ask for anything.  We eat and get out as fast as possible.  While the food is excellent, don't think we'll be back any time soon.",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian

7,sTwvPXOtsPD48t-wN4L-7g,Natalia C.,4.0 star rating,"Love this restaurant. This is a very good Italian-American restaurant. I personally wouldn't consider it authentic-Italian as it is certainly geared towards a more Italian-American audience. I wouldn't bring my Nonna here, then again I wouldn't bring her to any Italian restaurant because she'll always say her cooking is better. They serve a wide variety of Italian-American comfort food. The waitresses are extremely welcoming. Their goal is to make everyone feel like a regular and have a personal experience and they achieve that. I do wish it was BYO that would bring the concept full circle. I don't really think they need any advice though, they are always full and require reservations well in advance. If you are a guy and want to impress a girl you're dating BRING HER HERE. Come once or twice shortly before so the staff know you then when you walk in with her they will act like you go all the time and you'll look really cool.

He made a reservation for a Wednesday night about 2 weeks out and we took the last table so definitely plan ahead for your dinner here.We bought a bottle of Cabernet at the bar and started drinking while we waited for our table. I was pleasantly surprised by how cozy the interior was, and how boisterous the diners were. We were seated and our waitress gave us and the table next to us the specials at the same time - no frills in delivery but we came to eat, not to have our butts kissed :)We ordered the calamari as an app and it was my favorite part of the meal - perfectly crisp, not too big or too small, and we got the mild and medium sauce and they were both delicious. As others have mentioned, the house bruschetta is delicious as well. For mains, we had the chicken parm and the carbonara. I loved the chicken parm and had 2 lunches leftover. My boyfriend really enjoyed the carbonara, and the bacon is very prevalent in the sauce - however it was too heavy for my delicate stomach.We will certainly be back soon and highly recommend!",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian

18,4kdSh2lkelfHpXOQAPF4rQ,Michelle C.,4.0 star rating,"Rule of thumb - follow what the yelpers recommended.  1) Make reservation beforehand.  If you plan to walk-in, the bar is first come first serve and when we were there, the bar spots were taken up pretty quickly.  2) For appetizer, we got ""eggplant stuffed with prosciutto, peppers, and fontina cheese"" which is recommended by the waitress.  This is the holy grail of greatness!  My date who does not like eggplant devoured half of the dish!  The eggplant was grilled became tender, almost potato-like. Along with the prosciutto, roast peppers, and fontina cheese - it really came together! 3) For dinner:   - We ordered pork chops with hot peppers (of course).  Describing this dish as huge portion is an understatement - this is monstrous!  Essentially you are getting 4 pork chops in 2 pieces.  The waitress split the porkchop into two plates so my date and I can have our own plate which is super nice of her.  It was perfectly done and it was so flavorful.  I am very curious to know how they cook it because the porkchop is so thick.   - We also ordered Ravioli.  The marinara sauce is amazing!  I wish I can drink an entire bowl of that sauce!  4) For dessert, we ordered the Italian cheesecake.  We were so disappointed at the dessert.  I am not sure what Italian cheesecake was supposed to taste like but... I am pretty sure it should not taste stale.  I should have known to not order dessert as no one recommended dessert here... 5) This is NOT BYOB. I was amazed that the bottle wines are very reasonably priced.  A bottle of Riesling was $20.  6) BRING CASH!  Credit Cards, children, etc.. will not be accepted as a form of payment. This is definitely my favorite Italian restaurant in Hoboken now.",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian

20,NS8UTKj5JX1kRBsry35xGA,Christine A.,5.0 star rating,"there's so much good to be said about augustinos!  I feel so silly for not coming sooner.  The restaurant as others have mentioned is tiny - there's only enough space for a few small tables, so it feels very intimate.  The staff really seem to know their customers and there seems to be a ton of regular patrons that come time and time again.  It's really crazy how the wine list is so large for such a small place - but I get that Italians love their wine.   We were lucky to get a reservation on a Friday night and we really enjoyed our experience.  The server somehow knew we were going to share everything, so she halved the meals and brought them out on separate plates for us --- such impeccable service!  We ordered a chicken francese and a linguine in clam sauce.   The francese sauce was perfectly lemony - the chicken was nicely crispy and it came over pasta.  The vongole (clam) sauce had so many clams in it (they were already de-shelled) and there was no sign of them being tough or chewy!  I hate when my clams are overcooked.   We also indulged in 2 different desserts - a lemon cheesecake - pieces of lemon rind baked right in there; and a crème brulee.  We left so happy and satisfied.  And yes, cash only - but for a place like this, you get over that quickly.",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian

24,mjoPd2xa8BCsKus5bnca0A,Gabriela L.,4.0 star rating,"I won't flat out saaaaay this place is what Hispanics refer to as ""mafioso"" (pretty easy cognate), but it's pretty obvious based on the crowd, servers and ambiance. That being said, there is no denying this Augustino's is a Hoboken staple and a great place to get some ""sauce"" . Friendly and flirtatious waitresses wasted NO time getting to know us and call us by our first names, which may come off as a bit aggressive but they were just too nice. By the time our appetizer had come around, I felt like I had known our waitress for years. Complimentary bruschetta right when we sat down so no complaints here. Got a bottle of wine and Mussels (white) to start, both delicious. When I was between a couple entrees, the waitress strongly recommended I go with the veal parm to ""get what this place was all about."" Great suggestion because the veal was tender, smothered in cheese and drenched in sauce... so good. The perfectly cooked pasta was nestled underneath catching all the juices from the veal and sauce... again, so good. My boyfriend had the veal piccata and practically licked his plate clean so I think he at least somewhat enjoyed his choice. Have to make reservations well in advance (1 month + possibly more, especially for a weekend), for the prime time dinner slots 6-8pm. Cash only so come well endowed. It's pretty small, there are only like (4) 4-top tables, 1 round table that could seat 6, and a couple 2-tops so I wouldn't suggest it for a large crowd unless its a weekday. There are also openings at the bar, which seats 4-6, so if you don't have a reservation and want to take a gamble on that you might get lucky. Overall, great experience that I cannot wait to repeat and would highly recommend it.",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian

Every bite was delicious.Next, we had appetizers:  the pasta carbonara was absolutely fabulous. We also got the mozzarella salad which was very good. Nothing was left on our plates.For entrees, my bf ordered the sunday pasta special. There was so much food that he had another meal to take home. He enjoyed every bite. I had the chicken marsala with a side of pasta with red sauce. It was a beautifully pounded thin piece of chicken with a delicious marsala sauce. I devoured the pasta and red sauce which was excellent. I had enough chicken leftover again for an additional meal. Our friends had a chicken dish and the shrimp scampi. unlike us, they were used to the portion size and devoured everything. To complement the meal, the crusty Italian bread was very good.To finish the evening, we all split an icebox cake.

It can be difficult to get reservations BUT IT IS WORTH IT! Also, it is NOT BYOB and they ONLY takes CASH. That being said, Augustino's is a small and quaint restaurant with a very intimate atmosphere. When we got to the restaurant the hostess(she is also a server) verified our reservation and then indicated that our seat will be available in a couple minutes. Since our table was not ready we sat at the bar in the back. The bartender was extremely nice and offered us some recommendations. After a table opened up we sat down and ordered our meal. I ordered the hot pepper pork chops ($35). The waitress said that it will take about 30-40 minutes to come out, which was ok with me. As our dishes came out, i quickly noticed the SIZE of the two(2) pork chops for my dish. I could barely finish one pork chop. Also the pork chop came with a small order of pasta and red sauce. Please note it is spicy. I have to say that the pork chops were ONE OF THE BEST I EVER HAD! The Food IS AMAZING HERE! Throughout my meal the both waitresses (only two were working that night) kept checking on me and making sure I didn't need anything. I do not know why there are some negative reviews regarding the staff. Everyone was extremely welcoming at Augustino's. I would highly recommend Augustino's to anyone looking for AMAZING FOOD!

44,mjoPd2xa8BCsKus5bnca0A,Gabriela L.,4.0 star rating,"I won't flat out saaaaay this place is what Hispanics refer to as ""mafioso"" (pretty easy cognate), but it's pretty obvious based on the crowd, servers and ambiance. That being said, there is no denying this Augustino's is a Hoboken staple and a great place to get some ""sauce"" . Friendly and flirtatious waitresses wasted NO time getting to know us and call us by our first names, which may come off as a bit aggressive but they were just too nice. By the time our appetizer had come around, I felt like I had known our waitress for years. Complimentary bruschetta right when we sat down so no complaints here. Got a bottle of wine and Mussels (white) to start, both delicious. When I was between a couple entrees, the waitress strongly recommended I go with the veal parm to ""get what this place was all about."" Great suggestion because the veal was tender, smothered in cheese and drenched in sauce... so good. The perfectly cooked pasta was nestled underneath catching all the juices from the veal and sauce... again, so good. My boyfriend had the veal piccata and practically licked his plate clean so I think he at least somewhat enjoyed his choice. Have to make reservations well in advance (1 month + possibly more, especially for a weekend), for the prime time dinner slots 6-8pm. Cash only so come well endowed. It's pretty small, there are only like (4) 4-top tables, 1 round table that could seat 6, and a couple 2-tops so I wouldn't suggest it for a large crowd unless its a weekday. There are also openings at the bar, which seats 4-6, so if you don't have a reservation and want to take a gamble on that you might get lucky. Overall, great experience that I cannot wait to repeat and would highly recommend it.",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian

From that moment on, we were family.We started with drinks and their famous bruschetta. Unfortunately, you only got one piece. Every bite was delicious.Next, we had appetizers:  the pasta carbonara was absolutely fabulous. We also got the mozzarella salad which was very good. Nothing was left on our plates.For entrees, my bf ordered the sunday pasta special. There was so much food that he had another meal to take home. He enjoyed every bite. I had the chicken marsala with a side of pasta with red sauce. It was a beautifully pounded thin piece of chicken with a delicious marsala sauce. I devoured the pasta and red sauce which was excellent. I had enough chicken leftover again for an additional meal. Our friends had a chicken dish and the shrimp scampi. unlike us, they were used to the portion size and devoured everything. To complement the meal, the crusty Italian bread was very good.To finish the evening, we all split an icebox cake.

It can be difficult to get reservations BUT IT IS WORTH IT! Also, it is NOT BYOB and they ONLY takes CASH. That being said, Augustino's is a small and quaint restaurant with a very intimate atmosphere. When we got to the restaurant the hostess(she is also a server) verified our reservation and then indicated that our seat will be available in a couple minutes. Since our table was not ready we sat at the bar in the back. The bartender was extremely nice and offered us some recommendations. After a table opened up we sat down and ordered our meal. I ordered the hot pepper pork chops ($35). The waitress said that it will take about 30-40 minutes to come out, which was ok with me. As our dishes came out, i quickly noticed the SIZE of the two(2) pork chops for my dish. I could barely finish one pork chop. Also the pork chop came with a small order of pasta and red sauce. Please note it is spicy. I have to say that the pork chops were ONE OF THE BEST I EVER HAD! The Food IS AMAZING HERE! Throughout my meal the both waitresses (only two were working that night) kept checking on me and making sure I didn't need anything. I do not know why there are some negative reviews regarding the staff. Everyone was extremely welcoming at Augustino's. I would highly recommend Augustino's to anyone looking for AMAZING FOOD!

After 10-15 minutes I asked the 3 ladies standing at the bar area for menus and one actually said 'Someone will be with you shortly' instead of handing us menus! One of the 3 had the smarts to do so before the bad taste in my mouth actually settled. After we ordered I had to ask for bread since we didn't get any. Again, our meals were fine but nothing I would go back for. My linguine in clam sauce was tasty but more on the watery side. My husband's pasta in di Pomodoro was also ok - the bottom line is nothing on the menu is exciting, current or authentic. Please note, I am not looking to bash the place at all and this would have just qualified as a passable meal without any review if this didn't happen: when we were handed the check, a tip of 20% was included because as I was told we were a party of 5. They included my 4 year old daughter in the head count (which is as ridiculous as charging $10 for her side of pasta in marinara sauce), and I guess if these are the rules they play by it doesn't matter if guests have to request menus or bread...Bad taste definitely settled after this.",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian

Yes, the restaurant is small, crowded and it can take a little time to get to your table. Definitely make a reservation but even still, expect to wait a little bit. Don't worry, have the wonderful Denise fix you a deliciously strong Negroni while you wait. We ordered the specials: Pasta Special (spicy sausage bolognese) and the Rack of Lamb Lollipops. Best lamb I've ever had - I wanted to bathe in that sauce. But most importantly you can tell that this restaurant is more than a business, it's a family and a community. They have a lot of regulars, but they treat everyone (it was our first time) with love and a sense of familiarity.

We were greeted with hugs and seated right away. The service overall throughout the night was a little on the slow side, but I think that's a part of their charm. They take their time with every table, but they also let each table enjoy their food and company. You will not feel like you're rushed here.We began our meal with the most delicious bite of bruschetta I've ever tried. The bread was crunchy but still moist and it was just overall amazing. We shared the clams casino and the fried calamari for apps. The clams casino were unique and delicious - each clam was topped with finely minced tomatoes and a piece of pancetta. The calamari were cooked perfectly and the marinara had just the right amount of heat (we ordered spicy).For our entree, we shared the fettucini carbonara and the pork chops with hot peppers. The carbonara was creamy and so so yummy. The pork chops were the best I had ever had. They're actually still actively blowing my mind - the portions are gargantuan. The pork chops are 2-3 chops thick, but somehow manage to be perfectly tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. I don't know how they manage to do it, but I'm glad they've figured it out.We ended our meal with the icebox cake, which I found just okay. Not a huge fan of pudding, but I figured I'd try it based on the Yelp recommendations.I'm already looking forward to my next visit to Augustino's - also, saw a couple people picking up takeout while I was there. I will definitely be taking advantage of this in the coming weeks. Also, I found the prices to be more reasonable than I had initially thought.

Quick note: they are CASH ONLY.Decor: This place is small, but I would classify it as quaint. It is very intimate, with only about 8 tables, and has a genuinely homey feel. The look and feel is more of an old-school (really nice) pub with a bit of Italian flair.Bathroom: I did not use the bathroom during our visit.Staff: Our waitress was very friendly and pretty quick taking, and delivering, our orders. When we first sat down there was about 5mins of zero activity, but things picked up from there. She was also pretty helpful with menu questions and suggestions. Bonus: they leave a carafe of water on your table! Love it.Food/Drink: The menu is a bit small, but has all the staples on it. They also have specials that all sounded great. To start, we had the Stuffed Artichoke (which was ok, but I wouldn't get it again) and bread (delicious!). For meals we had the Chicken Parm (very tasty) and the Halibut, which was on special (perfectly prepared).Value: The prices don't seem too unreasonable but the total bill will add up quickly. While I believe we got what we paid for I feel as though their reputation somewhat precedes them and they have priced the menu accordingly.We definitely enjoyed the meal that we had but agreed that it wouldn't be a usual stop for us. The atmosphere is nice but the food could be a bit better. It is certainly the best Italian in Hoboken but not the BEST I've ever tasted.",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian

I had a really bad experience here, and you should definitely read my review before considering this place. I made a reservation for a birthday celebration for a few family members from out of town. We showed up on time at 8:30, but our table was not ready. We were told to wait at the bar, which is a really tight space and where the waiters walk in and out with hot dishes, and scream at you (in an aggressive manner)  to move out of the way whenever they walk by.  By about 9:00, our reservation wasn't ready so we politely asked the bar tender when we'd be seated. We finally got seated by 9:10 and the owner of the restaurant came over to speak with us. She was extremely rude to us and told us that it was offensive to ask the bartender about our reservation and that we stressed her out and that we can't act this way in her restaurant. After some more rude words from her, our party of 7 decided to stand up and leave the restaurant. The owner came running after us and proceeded to tell us to ""go f*ck ourselves"" and called my father-in-law the c-word. This was all uncalled for, as we simply were trying to celebrate a family birthday, and the only thing we did was ask when our table would be ready! I am embarrassed that this place can stay open.  DO NOT go here. No restaurant should stay open while they can treat customers this way.",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian

She is extremely friendly (even gives hugs and massages throughout the dinner) and she gave us some great recommendations. Last night we had the shrimp special, eggplant rollatini, and scallops appetizers and then we split the breaded porkchop with vinegar and hot peppers. Everything was ridiculously good. The sauce on the eggplant was amazing. I keep dreaming about it. The scallops were cooked perfectly. Chef Gordon Ramsey would have been proud. The pork chop was excellent too.

Lastly, its cash only  no ATM on premises.With that done, let's get to what matters. THE PLACE IS GREAT. I was honestly happy with the whole experience there. The restaurant is fairly small, perhaps 10 tables, and wasn't particularly loud. The whole meal, appetizers through desert were all great, and i certainly felt that they didn't skimp on portions. The hostess, waitress and bartender I dealt with were all wonderful. Just a small warning to those who don't love spicy food, the sauces that come with the fried calamari, anything besides mild, is pretty spicy, but seriously great.I would certainly recommend this place, if you can find $180 dollars in cash, someone who can tolerate you for a dinner date and your names on a list to get a seat.",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian

That's my #1 takeaway from the entire disappointing experience.As for the comfort Italian food, it was pretty good, though not especially memorable.  Broccoli rabe appetizer had burnt garlic that added bitterness, veal Marsala was tasty, lobster fra diablo had lots of seafood but the flavor was a bit one-dimensional (red pepper flake).  We had a pretty good bottle of Cab for $40 which was actually a good deal.  I don't remember the dessert (something chocolate?) or coffee all that well, other than being rushed through it.  For $180 for an early weeknight dinner for 2, I expected something to stand out.  Rather than food - ranging from fair to pretty good, but overpriced- or ambiance - kitchy, dated - it was the service.  It was amazing to see how quickly the schtick can go from endearing to insulting, and how quickly we went from making future reservations to swearing ""never again.""",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian

Understandably, my friends at the table started to question the waiter's decision, and they asked what they would do if they wanted to ""order another bottle of wine and prolong their dinner"", even had they arrived on time. The waiter told them they couldn't take time out of the next reservation, essentially saying that everyone is limited to 1.5 hours for dinner!After discussing it, the waiter got fed up, took their wine, and asked them to leave!

Augustino's you rocked my dining world.  Not necessarily with your amazing food, though you do an extremely good job with that.  Not with your outstanding wine list, as your wine list isn't that comprehensive.  You rocked my world with ambiance, service and charm.  I'll go out and say this is a 4.5 star kind of place.  Before I get into the details of this wonderful evening, I will just put it out there for you yelpers why I am rounding down rather than up.  I didn't love my entree.Now, this place is tiny so don't expect to just walk in and get a table.  Our friends did tell us that you can walk in post 9pm on a Friday and get 2 spots at the bar.  (Thanks Portia R for that great tip!). Now waiting for our reservations, my party of 4 was in the way, no doubt about that.  The waitresses were kind, rude, hilarious while getting their job done.  If you don't like a little sass and a few ""get the hell out of my ways will ya"" then yes you may say the service is not that good.  However, the beautiful servers always have a smile on the their face and are ready to help you feel at home. (Including a few back rubs and hugs).For starters: Calamari with a choice of 3 sauces - sweet, regular or hot.  We went with hot.  It was actually a hot marinara and was it delicious.  An amazing idea if you ask me since I love me some hot sauce and I love me some marinara sauce. The eggplant rollatini was good but what stood out was again that marinara sauce.  Augustino's has some damn good marinara.Entrees - The veal chop special stuffed with prosciutto, fontina, and spinach.  It looked scrumptious but in fact it lacked a certain je ne sais quoi.  Extra flavor?  Salt? I don't know.  Definitely not the best thing on the menu.  My boyfriend echoed my sentiment with his stuffed pork chop.  On a side note, I do need to add that my bf was torn on what to order and the waitress hooked him up with the half order pork chop (though I don't think it was half, it was huge) and a half order of the pasta he was eyeing.   So sweet.  All the pastas I tasted were delicious.  That marinara again... yummm.The side of veggies and potatoes were delicious. The asparagus being perfectly charred and very crispy.  I dare say they were perfect.  The free bruschetta waiting on the table is a great way to start.   The Ice Box cake split into 4, for the 4 people in my party was out of this world delicious and a great way to end this fun evening.Augustino's has standard prices for upscale Italian.  It wasn't the best Italian food I ever had but, by no means was it bad.  It was quite good, very good. But, what really makes this place stand out is it's heart.

We came here on a weeknight to avoid the crowds and trouble of securing a table, but even on a calm Wednesday night this place was bustling. We ended up sitting at the bar which is first come first serve. The bartender was attentive and got us menu's right away while he explained the special for the day. I ended up ordering the chicken parm which is as basic as it gets but it came at the recommendation of the bartender. The portion size is huge could have easily filled up two people and still had leftovers for the next day. The sauce was delicious and the chicken and mozz were cooked just right. The chicken cutlets are served over penne pasta with some red sauce. This place does take reservations via phone but if you want to try your luck at the bar best to go on a weekday!

My favorite dish here is the Chicken Rollatini, unless they run out that is what I order.  It is always so tasty.  I think I ordered from the menu once as I usually go with one of the specials!

Absolutely flawless.  My only recommendation would be that they should consider serving butter in a ramekin or butter dish as opposed to the gold-foil pat of butter.All and all, it was a great presentation of classic, properly prepared Italian specialties without adopting an American interpretation, which often happens in other restaurants.  Remember to bring cash, and lots of it....  because as you know, a home cooked Italian dinner is not inexpensive but certainly worth every penny.",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE the atmosphere of the place, but when it came to the hyped-up food, I was beyond disappointed. First, my husband and I started with the complimentary bruschetta... so far so good. Then we ordered the shrimp and pepper appetizer, which was 3 pieces of shrimp and a ton of peppers in a sea of oil. It didn't have any flavor nor any spice to it (even though our server said it was). For our meals, I had the Lemon Chicken on the bone with a side a pasta, and my husband ordered the Chicken Parm. The chicken parm was average... nothing to write home about, but when our server put my Lemon Chicken in front of me, it was a plate of chicken wings! I was absolutely shocked as I thought this would at least be a boned chicken breast or something similar. I couldn't believe they would even bring this out to me. What type of ""nice"", authentic Italian restaurant thinks this is acceptable as an entree? And to boot, the pasta was overcooked. The best part of the dinner was the icebox cake... amazing.

The handmade farfelle pasta was really amazing but that is the only good thing I can say about the food. The rest of the fare including their famous veal were just ok.

166,NWLqOKl0Vxi7qK-6EoBLbg,Brandon E.,4.0 star rating,"This place is a classic among not so classics. It's obvious to me that they don't try too hard to be good, which I think makes for a better experience. My fiance knew I've been wanting to try this place forever, so she made reservations for my birthday. She said she had no problem getting one for a Friday night. In fact, when we were there we saw empty tables. This place is small and intimate though, probably 10 tables or so a few 2 tops, some 4 tops and a small bar.  It's old school inside. As someone stated this is out of the 80s, well I wouldn't say that. I'd say the food is classic Italian with no fit and flare. It's good, classic and like I said, doesn't try hard. The place is cash only, which is why only 4 stars, I know it's the way it's always been but it's time to move into the 21st century. But if you plan accordingly you're fine. The prices aren't outrageous and the wine is very fairly priced.  The waitresses are great, friendly and no BS and joke with you, it was like sitting down at a family dinner, they create a great atmosphere.Now onto the food, we got a couple apps, one was a veal special, it was kind of like a burrito but with delicious veal inside it was awesome. Then we got the fontina cheese app, which was a lot like an Italian grilled cheese, also delicious, simple, but delicious! I had the bone-in veal chop special, it was so good. It fell off the bone and was beautifully seasoned. was it the best veal chop I've ever had? No. But it was still excellent. My fiance got some seafood and she loved it, ate most all of it. I cleaned my plate. Like I said, this food was excellent without having to try, they do a wonderful job of putting the emphasis on flavor which is good. For dessert we got the ice box cake, which was good but not spectacular. I wish I would have gone for something a different, but not complaining it just didn't measure up to the other two courses. I loved it here, some of the best classic Italian food I've had in a long time. It's a home cooked environment with a fine dining touch. It's a great intimate atmosphere and worth checking out, just hit the ATM before you do.",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian

We followed with the enormous breaded pork chops with vinegar peppers, shrimp parm, chicken parm, and the farfalle pasta dish.  Needless to say, our table was silent for a good 20 minutes as we devoured our food.  Everything tasted exactly how my mom cooks in the absolute best way possible, where we all had smiles on our faces from the familiar flavors.  The sauces were robust and fresh, the breading was crunchy and just thick enough, and the pork chops were juicy and cooked to perfection.  I had no doubt that there was no wrong choice to be made on their menu.  After our meal we left to more hugs and kisses and a promise that we will be back for more!",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian

Made reservations the day of (score) - definitely thought it was a good sign. The bruschetta - it was good, a little oily/soggy.. and it had already been sitting out on the table before we got there. The app that we ordered was the special of the day - some sort of antipasto (tomatoes, fresh mozz, onions, balsamic - nix'ed the onions though). It was decent. The boy got stuffed chicken - that was YUMMY. Probably the best thing we ordered (another special they had that night). I got veal marsala, and I have to say. It's nothing to write home about. They gave a side of linguine in a red sauce - which i would have rather lose the sauce and have it in with my entree. All in all, this was an average experience. I think there are places in Hoboken that have much better food.The service here is something else, too. It was dinner and a show.

We went on Thanksgiving Eve to celebrate a rather stressful year and when we went to pay the bill (cash only) we gave $100 and only received change for $80. It was an extremely disappointing experience- having us blamed for losing the money after double checking our remaining cash against our ATM receipt. Beyond that it was mortifying bc it's such a small restaurant- everyone was listening in.  However- the worse part was there was no apology from management, we still gave an additional $20 for gratuity bc we didn't want our server to be penalized for the bartenders mistake. Afterwards it left such a bad taste in our mouth, I had to call back to explain our disappointment and the management was defensive and accusatory. It's a shame bc it's always been a special place to us and now I have no desire to ever return or refer it again. I'm sure our review on Yelp won't have any impact on business, but word of mouth in this town moves quickly and for the $20 mistake it cost them it would have been better for them to just pay that small difference.

Wait staff was very friendly. However, the food didn't meet my expectations after all that bragging I heard from my friend. The stuffed mushroom was good but over priced. 2 for $14, it just didn't do it. My wife's calamari was over cooked, tasted rubbery. My rack of lamb was cooked to my requested temperature, but was lacking flavor. I gave it three stars because I was very disappointed with the food. I guess, i just had very high expectations after we heard that Augustino's has the best Italian food. I don't understand why they have such a long waiting list and this place is hard to get into.  Not at all worth the wait, although when I called they fit me into an early time slot for diner and I didn't have to wait as long as people who want to go at a normal dinner time.Over all, I think Augustino is an over gloried and over priced restaurant.

Wooh!  The bartender quickly offered recommendations which were delish. I ordered the special lasagna and the spaghetti.  The free bread that sat at the bar tasted stale and immediately I was downheartened.  Maybe my expectations were too high?  Fortunately, the worst part or the meal wad over. The entrees came out delish and overflowing with taste. It also didn't hurt that the portions were hearty,  because sometimes nice restaurants like to give you only a sampling of food. I left full and happy.  Will certainly return the next time I can afford to.",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian

I still come back here after all of these years. It is hard to imagine the few mediocre reviews here. The quality and taste of their food is almost second to none. You can't come here counting your pennies as dinner with all of the trimmings and tip is in the $65 range.

A weird, aggressive message on your answering machine trying to confirm your reservation the day before your date.2. To be greeted by a gum cracking rude hostess when you arrive.3. That two of the appetizers, a bottle of wine, and one entree that you choose from the menu are ""not available tonight"".  (Rotating menu necessary, perhaps?)4. That your waitress would bring your wine bottle to the table already opened.  Now, I'm not a wine snot, but isn't that wrong? They could have piped any old crap in that bottle!I was also annoyed that they didn't take credit cards, which we were unaware of.  My husband had to run out and find an ATM during dinner.The inside is cute and cozy, with only a few tables; it has a pizza parlor ambiance, only with a bar.  I expected a much more sophisticated dining experience due to the long wait for a reservation.  And it would have been nice if they mentioned the cash only thing when they called us to confirm our reservation.There are many less pretentious places to eat in Hoboken, without the silly waiting period.",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian

Potatoes and onions were served on the side. Applesauce just tasted like they had opened a bottle of Motts.  Next time I think I would have tried the sauteed pork chops with vinegar and hot peppers.  We skipped coffee and dessert.",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian

Living in Hoboken for five years and hearing that this is the best spot in town for your classic southern Italian dishes, I knew I had to try it. After several attempts of trying to get a table (spread over the years), I'd almost given up.  Finally, a random weekday at the early bird time of 5pm, my boyfriend and I managed to walk in and find several tables available for dinner. We ordered lasagna and chicken marsala.  Our two favorite Italian dishes we always order anytime we try a new spot.  All I can say is ""Eh"".  To say the wait staff is friendly, is an understatement... our waitress started massaging my boyfriend's shoulders!!! I'm sooo Not Kidding!!!! We walked out of there feeling like we had just been a part of one of those ""punked"" shows, like ""what the hell just happened in there""???I'd rate Augustino's a 5-star in entertainment value, because we got a good laugh that night and were very amused by the experience, but it's a 2-star on the food.  Sorry to the cult-like fans, but I just don't get it.",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian

The complimentary bruschetta is fantastic-- garlicky chopped tomatoes sitting atop nicely chewy, olive oil drizzled bread. The chicken parmigiana lives up to expectations-- it's a mass of cheesiness-- so too was the special meat lasagna.  The portions are massive so be prepared to take home a doggy bag. Augustino's is definitely good Italian food, but I'm still not convinced it is worth the month wait for reservations, nor that it's even the best Italian in Hoboken by a large margin.",Augustino’s,4.0 star rating,$$$,Italian

I had - Chicken Frances: good, but not drop on the floor awesome. He had - Chicken Marsala: good, but not OMG I WANT MORE good. The atmosphere was small and cute, and the waitresses were super nice. However, with their delicious (and super-elaborate) descriptions for specials, they were hard to follow. I would have been more comfortable seeing them written down.

They may not have a table available, but it is always wise to get on the waiting list because something usually opens up. Christine, who takes reservations, is great about calling you when a table is free.The food here is top notch. Try the shrimp and spicy peppers for an appetizer if they're serving it. The peppers are cooked to absolute perfection and the shrimp is delicious and fresh.If you order the pork chop, be prepared to for two 10oz chops full of juicy meat all around the bone. You can get it with peppers or apple sauce and it is phenomenal.The wait staff is friendly, they offer great suggestions, and will make you want to stay all night.
