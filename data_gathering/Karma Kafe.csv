DO NOT LET PEOPLE USE THE SAME PLATE TWICE. there's literally 2 nasty peeps I saw chowing down on their plates on line at the buffet to refill them plates. The tongs touched their food. It's FREAKING GROSS.  Please observe, NEW PLATE every time you go to the buffet. There was this Chinese dude eating in front of the buffet bar on line then refilled his plate.

The green sauce that comes with it is refreshing. The chicken Tikka masala was fantastic. Very flavorful. Lots of chicken. Not too heavy. It was a garlic tomato sauce. The meals came with basmati rice and dal, which I think is kind of soup, similar to lentil.I will absolutely order from here again. It only took about 40-45 minutes to arrive.

52,b0x4HrjoB6Mo47G5bJN0rw,Irina D.,4.0 star rating,"Maybe it's due to some odd devotion to another Indian restaurant in Hoboken, which closed years ago although it was excellent, but I've been holding off on writing a review for Karma Kafe for what seems like years. I have frequented Karma Kafe multiple times in the past 5.5 years, and I'd say most times it has been quite consistent: Good service, flavorful food, generous dishes (enough leftovers for a full meal), and a nice environment.The most recent visit was a few months ago with my boyfriend. Karma Kafe was closed for about 8-9 months as a result of a bad fire in the building. I was afraid they weren't going to reopen but the construction gave me hope. At some point they put up a sign saying they are going to open soon and I got really excited, we made sure to come here shortly after they reopened.The restaurant looked even better than it did before the fire, but with a very similar set up. When we came in it was still somewhat early for dinner, unless you are an ""old"" person like us, so there were a few empty tables but they all filled up by the time we left. We were seated almost immediately and got the menu.I can't recall the previous menu but believe it was almost identical to the current one. We split the veggie tikkas, garlic naan and I got my regular order of Vegetable Jalfrezzi. The food was delicious and the service was consistent.I probably take this place for granted, but it's definitely nice to have a good Indian restaurant close to where I live.",Karma Kafe,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

I went for the Sunday Lunch Buffet, the selection is not as great as other places in NJ but probably the best around the Hoboken area. They offered a few dishes mainly I was interested in the Chicken Tandoori, Lamb and Chicken Curry. The Tandoori is spicy and cooked well, the chicken curry was good and the lamb was really good. I would definitely recommend the lamb an chicken tandoori. I did find it useful that the naan was out on the buffet and I did not have to ask for it like most places.

I thought the food on the buffet was a little lackluster and lacked any innovation or zing. The star of the meal which the Karma Kafe buffet was known for - chicken koftas is now missing completely from the buffet. Instead it's being substituted for Achari Chicken - meh. Rest of the dishes include Saag Paneer (good), Fish tikka masala (very good - like a butter chicken but made of fish!), aalo gobhi (meh), tandoori chicken (not impressed), tava vegetables (deep fried potato and okra as an app -okay) and medu vada (very good).The quality of the naan has improved tremendously, but some of the best dishes like the koftas, pav bhaji and chicken biryani are all absconding. Delivery is still good - see my detailed delivery review in the previous update. They do have great vegetarian options on their ala carte menu - like the aaloo chole (banging) and kadhi pakoda (excellent), so it would be great if they added some of those options to their buffet to give it a face-lift.",Karma Kafe,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

I came from Journal Square area because I heard great things about this and was disappointed with the food choices and the flavor, the Chicken Tikka Masala was actually kind of sweet and the paneer dish was bland and cold. I would maybe come try this place by ordering off the menu but someone would have to suggest the place to go. Best part of the meal was the Tandoori Chicken- soft and moist and flavorful. Naan was thick and cold. I would suggest adding more items and keeping food warm and maybe serve fresh naan (garlic and butter) to the table.

It was also a great pic!! I recommend the saucy dishes if you are a dip extraordinaire like myself. Especially with the garlic Naan; warm with just the right amount of toast and garlic (not overpowering at all). But now to the drinks, for $9 a drink it is exactly what you crave.

Im told they have a really inexpensive lunch buffet during the week but I'm not sure how good it is because I haven't been.

Dessert: gulab jamun The entree comes with rice, side salad, and with the amazing dal. For the bread, I have tried all different types of naans and parathas so my favorites would be the garlic naan and the laccha paratha- so fluffy and warm, you will feel so cozy. You will feel at home when you're here. The entree is made with the right amount of spices,not unnecessarily spicy nor bland.

Karma Kafe had their kiosk in Hoboken Art festival today. They had most unfriendly staff and I had to give directions to give me my parcel in bag, ask for spoons and paper napkins! Besides they listed their items in menu as Chicken combo and Veg combo. A chicken combo usually includes chicken curry and a vegetable curry. However they only had the chicken curry as part of it. I wonder why they called it a combo. The chicken curry was too sweet and no spices. Felt like eating chicken marinated in yogurt but zero spices or salt. Worst part was their box was so substandard quality and the guy didn't close it properly. Some of curry spilled inside the bag before I noticed and locked it nice! I don't recommend them.

The grilled veggies were good, though.More recently, I ordered delivery because my wife and I are too lazy to cook or go out. The food was good and filling, but it took FOREVER to get here. Seamless estimated 70-85 minutes, which is already pretty harsh, and the food took 93 minutes to get here. All I could hear was my wife saying ""I'm hungry"" while we waited. The Lamb Korma was different from any other Indian food I've ever had, but definitely delicious and creamy. The Chicken Tikka Masala, on the other hand, was among the worst. Although the flavor was good, the gravy was so way too watery and runny compared to what I'm used to. I like it really thick and creamy, maybe that's just me.

Every time, they follow through with a fantastic experience.The lunch buffet leaves nothing to be desired. They have a wide selection of food that left my omnivorous friend and my vegetarian self so satisfied that we practically waddled out of the place.The difference between eating there for lunch and dinner is the crowd. The lunch crowd is usually people from nearby businesses and some families with small children. It's usually not too crowded, too. During dinner you get an interesting mix and they have a tendency to be more crowded. The problem with that is that it can get loud pretty quickly inside. However, the outdoor seating area is nice and is usually a viable option.Delivery is the one thing they fall a little short on. I've ordered from them through seamless and waited for over an hour for the food. The food was delicious once I got it, but that wait just about did me in.The food is always fresh and delicious, and I like that they offer cocktails in addition to wine and beer.

I'm ordering naan b/c it's delicious....and this stuff is seriously delicious.The Chicken Kashmiri has been the underdog favorite. It's like a mix between chicken korma and chicken tikka masala, and in addition to big chunks of chicken, is loaded with vegetables. This stuff is da bomb. p.s. that oughtta tell you how good it is - I haven't used a phrase like ""da bomb"" in...well....ever.Chicken Tikka Masala is very good. Not the best, but certainly worth ordering. It's a little more mild and has a little more tomato flavor, while being slightly less creamy than I'm used to. The paneer is also very good.My only complaint is the wait.

I do not consider Karma ""authentic"" Indian food -- it's cooked for the Western palate but it's always delicious. Also, we've always had great service.There are a few plates that you have to experience onsite instead of delivery. I'd say the tandoori sampler and the wings haryali should be enjoyed there in the restaurant. For delivery, we normally order the chicken malabar, tilapia malabar, chicken biryani, aloo chole and sometimes the chana palaak.

175,JFtCfwvXUviyp9PHc5iU4w,Kristen P.,4.0 star rating,"Karma Kafe is my favorite place in Hoboken to get traditional Indian food because they are CONSISTENT in the quality of the food they serve, and all of their dishes are more than reasonably priced.Whether you order delivery (they've mastered the art of packing food to go so it stays mess-free and arrives steaming hot) or you eat-in, you won't be disappointed with the flavors and quality of their food.Everything I've had from here is delicious, even their many vegetarian options don't disappoint in the flavor department. My favorite appetizer dishes are the Wings Havarti (Baked chicken wings in a spicy yogurt marinade, served with a tangy mustard sauce $8) and the Karma Aloo (Sautéed baby red potato wedges served over a chilled tomato and garlic reduction, dressed with yogurt and pepper sauce $7). I've also had their Veggie Samosas which are always spot on, but tend to be on the heavier side for an app. As far as entrees, I've had many of their vegetarian dishes and have never been disappointed. Most recently, I was impressed with their Chana Palak (Chick peas in a spiced creamy spinach sauce. $12) for having so much FLAVOR.I have yet to try their buffet brunch/lunch on the weekends, but I am very much looking forward to it. If you're looking for straight forward, honest, flavorful Indian cuisine without all of the weird fusion dishes of other nearby establishments (Naanchos? Really?)

The cauliflower, my forever nemesis, was very tender and soft. It was a texture contrast to the thin sauce and the crunchy green peppers.      The tandoori chicken was terrible. The meat was dry (like the waiter's personality), the spice rub was too spicy even for an Indian food lover like me, and the chicken skin looked like a Victor Frankenstein experiment gone awry. I was under impressed because it is considered their best dish. Really? That's your best dish?     The dal, a lentil soup, was delicious, however, my fellow diners didn't enjoy it as much as me. The soupy lentils was the perfect for the chewy naan. And that brings me to...     NAAN!!! The charred naan had the crustiness of burnt ends and the chewiness good flat breads should have.      Palak paaner is a traditional Indian dish of spinach and... you guessed it... cheese. Some people don't know that Indians make cheeses but weirdly enough, they do. Anyway, spinach with cheese is just not my thing so I ended up disliking this dish.     For dessert, we had vermicelli pudding with golden raisins and almonds. I, personally, didn't like it because of its odd texture. But my fellow diners wanted to bring some home.      I enjoyed the food we had today so I'm giving it 4 stars.

When we walked in this place wasn't crowded at all.

The appetizers specially chicken kofta were delicious. I felt some of the main course dishes like aloo baigan and paneer chole were very bland.

I ended up ordering the Chicken Tikka, which was $13. It came out quickly and looked great. The dal was a bit too spicy for me, but the rice and chicken tikka tasted great. For the price, I was hoping for a bit more, and usually I would give it one less star, but hey, this is Hoboken.I also ordered a drink, the Punch-A-Tauntra.

Service was ok.  Food came out fast, servers filled waters quickly. The only downside is that the waiter who took our orders said they offered basmati brown rice, which we all ordered but we didn't get that.. we got basmati white rice. It also took a while for us to give our orders). We started off with the poori (puffy fried bread) as an app, $5. It was supposed to come with an onion salad of some sort but we got nothing. The food comes in a HUGE portion and it's actually plenty spicy, which I appreciated. I got the tiliapia malabar, which was a brown fish curry. It was pretty spicy with a hint of coconut.. I thought it'd be a lighter curry but I can't complain. It was piping hot. All entrees come with tomato, lettuce, lentils (bad, watery lentils.. a small portion too.. not the hearty kind), and lots of buttery basmati rice (this was pretty good).  I think this was some $16-17ishMy Mom had the kebab medley, which was a chicken tikka masala kebab, and a grilled chicken kebab (some other flavored chicken). The pieces were plentiful, good and tender. This also came with lentils and rice. I believe this was $15..(sorry too lazy to look up the menu haha0My Dad ordered the shrimp biriyani which was $18.. it's a curried rice dish with basmati rice. I'm quite familiar with it since we Burmese have our own version of this dish. I thought Karma's was more on the stir fry side.. you could tell they probably didn't labor over each spice that's supposed to do into this dish but eh, I didnt try it too much so I guess I am assuming. There was plenty of shrimp in it.  It came with a meh  yogurt sauce (it was a bit sour and cold.. sort of just tasted like.. a cold tzitaki which isn't Indian at all!)Again, A+ for the spicy food but overall a 3.5 star experience.

Other restauranteurs and business owners, take note: they're doing things right on a number of levels.  Here's the breakdown:Quality: My husband has had the great misfortune of having a ""reaction"" after eating a number of Indian chicken meals.  Most happily, Karma Kafe was very good to him!Generous portions: You'll have to take some home, there's so much! Pricing: Really affordable and in a dining room, no less! $5 apps, $10 entrees, $3 naan. Listening to the customer and going the extra mile: I was impressed when I asked for to go boxes so I could pack up the food (it's a germ/food safety thing). Not only did our server listen and brought the containers to the table, but he packed the food (which I didn't expect and began doing). My request for containers has often been disregarded and servers take the plates to the kitchen for packing.Amazing customer service: When our waiter noticed I left half a dish (just the onions and tomatoes which I wanted to be left out, but it was pre-made), he took the dish off the bill!  He said next time, he'll ask the kitchen to prepare it to my liking.When we mentioned we were customers of the now shuttered Anika's Kati Roll, he asked what we ordered there.  I shared I ordered masala but since it wasn't listed on the menu at Karma Kafe, I ordered the aloo chole. Our server said a lot of customers ask for channa masala and they will make it for me next time.  The aloo chole (which is chickpeas AND potatoes) is more tomatoey in comparison to the heavier, cream based masala.Note: The twice used phrase ""next time"" is a great subliminal trick and if used in a certain manner, can be an invitation to return.Made it personal: Our waiter shook our hands and shared his name--which I apologize I can't remember because I was overwhelmed by the amazing experience I was having!!!Incentive to return: Our server shared cards for free appetizers.  Now of course I'll be back---have you been reading?!? But just in case I was thinking of leaving KK behind, I now have reason to come back---and there are a lot of different appetizers to choose from, so if I didn't like the one I had today, now I can try others. ;)Opportunities for improvement:I'm a clean/germ freak so I see things a bit differently than the average consumer.  Chutneys are placed on tables before guests arrive and we happen to have an uninvited dining guest named Gnat who visited us.  Bet Gnat and his pals would like to take some laps in those pools of condiment!Oh Karma Kafe!  You made me sooo happy, I was literally smiling from ear to ear when I left!  (If you've peeked at my reviews, you know most businesses and experiences don't leave me feeling that way.)",Karma Kafe,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

As long as no one in your party is sick, this is a great place to share a few entrées with the table. However, if you don't like sharing, each entrée comes with its own rice and salad and it's definitely nice to have the option to share or not. I had the Chicken Tikka Masala and tried my boyfriend's Chicken Curry. Both were excellent, and the prices are very low for the amount of food you get.One thing to note was our server added gratuity to our check even though we were only a table of 4, so be sure to look out for that if you go with a larger group.

The biggest disappoint I've run into in the three years I've lived in Hoboken is the downgrade of a once-great restaurant. Since going to Karma, the service has always been excellent, and the five star quality of the food has never changed. While it may not look like the ritziest place on the inside, once you get your food, you'll want to keep coming back again and again.

Delivery was fast, and I was starving, so I was incredibly let down on digging into the lamb vindaloo I ordered to find that it was all bone. I mean, about as close to 100% bone as it could be without there being any meat at all. Of course, more likely than not you won't get boneless meat when ordering Indian, but when you're digging through a pile of curry and bones ultimately scraping up what amounted to one cube of meat at any of the Indian places a mile away in Jersey City, you should be embarrassed for your business. That entire section near Journal Square has about 5 blocks worth of great Indian places, and I've never been ripped off from any of them.  I paid $30 for a container of bones last night; considering I'm not a dog who lives in a junkyard, that didn't do me much good, so I suggest you don't make the same mistake.",Karma Kafe,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

My friend and I were starving and but I knew better than to scarf my food down (Indian food is not the best food to be scarfing down when you're hungry). Let's just say it was a very quiet lunch. It was a pretty big buffet, there was: chicken korma, dal, black beans in a sauce, this chicken tandoori, spinach palak, this potato/peppers dish, your raita/tamarind/cilantro sauces, naan, basmati rice, and some other dishes I can't quite remember. Oh and fruit and rice pudding for dessert. We ordered mango lassis which were delish. The chicken dishes were great, I've always had bad experiences with chicken korma but it was really good this time.The food was all really flavorful. I rarely like buffets but this was an exception. I came out probably 3 pounds heavier, it was worth it though.

He talked for a year about a particular dish (lamb korma) that I HAD to try when we moved back.  So of course, being a food lover, I had to try it and give in.  After all, he did give in get sushi with me before he understood just how amazing it would be.We went, it was a quiet night, and service was quick and easy.  The decor is plain, but I wasn't too concerned about that - the food would make or break the experience for me.  I love the cracker that they serve with dipping sauces before dinner.  Just a little something to satisfy without filling you up like bread. I decided to get chicken kashmiri, based on the description in their menu and we also asked for two orders of naan.  The chicken was delicious - moist, flavorful.  But that sauce.  There was not enough naan in the world to gobble up with that sauce!  OMG.We have been back a few times since and I haven't tried any other dish.

Drinks!! Mango mojitos!! The mojitos were delicious and actually tasted like mango , most places they don't. We didn't get apps , went straight for main course. One thing I loved was that you get your own plate of food , most Indian places you get a pot of curry and you'd have to share. The paneer curry that I got was really good but not great. But they have tons of selection, paneer happens to be my fav. And I'm very picky about it. Your plate also comes with Daal (lentil soup) and rice, which was very good. The naan (separate order)  which is one of my favorite foods in the world, which I'm happy to say was excellent. Fluffy , crispy right out of the tandoor . We got the garlic and the onion , mmmm so good. It can get a but expensive , our bill ran about 60.00 for two , that's without apps .

The inside was small but still navigable (?) enough to make my way to the buffet area without fear of bumping into other guests. The food had good flavor. There's not much variety, but there is at least one offering of mild, moderate and strong flavoring and spiciness. In terms of meat, chicken meatballs and chicken wings were offered. Unfortunately, the chicken wings were sitting out for a while and became dry. They definitely weren't overcooked. The potato balls were the standout. Fluffy inside, crispy outside with a fair amount of curry flavor.One thing that stuck out to me was the food didn't seem too fresh. It could have been a result of the cooking style. A lot of stewed, mushy, food. As for the beer, the Taj Mahal lager tasted like any of your big name beers.Overall, it wasn't a bad meal.

We didn't try the cocktails but they seemed popular with our fellow patrons, especially the bachelorette party across the room. The main courses were incredible, very moist tender chicken actually served with rice and dal at no extra charge, and with ample sauce for dipping.

The food is just about average, but the high prices make it much worse. I ordered a naan (bread) last week, and it was an inch thick and half cooked. The chef didn't even bother to bake it all the way. A waiter with half a brain could notice that it was bright white all over and turned it back to the kitchen (a well baked one would be almost brown), but our guy was too much in rush to get over with it. It was so doughy, you could squeeze it into a ball in your fist. They barely cared to use ANY butter on my ""butter naan"".  The non-alcoholic pina colada contained SO MUCH ginger that it was hard to swallow...we gave it up after 2 sips. The pakoras (starters) were all burnt and charred.  The service was very poor. If the restaurant is about to close for the night, either warn the guests in advance or turn them away. They welcomed us in, and then started rushing us. The waiter came twice to our table to ask if we've finished and wanted the rest of our food in a box. We thought we'd have a relaxed weekend dinner, but it felt more like a breakfast when you're running late for work. Then they started stacking up chairs and tables and their hardware right next to our seat to prepare for closing. My wife had to wait 10 minutes outside the ladies room....and finally the door opened and a man emerged...and without apologizing went straight back to work into the kitchen. How about teaching your staff some rules and manners?? The weekend buffet is a nightmare. They've stuffed in so many tables and chairs that it gets hard to get in or out of your chair without hitting or brushing against someone. I spent half my energy trying to protect my plates from getting knocked over by people walking by. The buffet menu is TINY...and after a while, all that maneuvering you need to do to get from your seat to the food and back just wears you out. I find it highly offensive when restaurants take the liberty of awarding themselves a gratuity--I believe that amount is up to my discretion, based on how good or bad I find your service. Despite their pathetic service and poor food, they added a generous gratuity to the bill. I'm never coming back, and neither should you.",Karma Kafe,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

The Idli was great melt in your mouth so were the accompaniments, a must try. The pav bhaji was just about ok. The mains were good too. They had a goat curry which was really well made. They had bone in pieces in the curry which really added to the flavor of the curry, normally you will see dry boneless pieces in the goat curries at some other places. The food was pretty flavorful overall. Only thing I would say is it would be nice if they serve the naan on your table as ordered rather than at the buffet table.

We have eaten from Karma many times since moving to downtown JC - the food is always reliable and arrives within an hour (if you're ordering). They do make things spicy if you request it though not nearly to the level we like! If you live in downtown JC and can't make it to the more authentic Indian restaurants in Journal Sq, I would advise ditching our local downtown Indian spots (Raaz, Amiya) for a quick trip to Karma (or get it via seamless!).We have tried the buffet but tend to stick with the veggie lunch box when ordering on weekends. Aloo Chhole, veggie jalfrazie, channa palak are all fantastic. I also loved their app sampler which came with samosas, tikkis and pakoras - really awesome and crispy when I tried them - not too oil logged and soggy.If you visit Karma in person, you may have a wait as it's quite small.

We stopped in here for the lunch buffet so we could get a variety of dishes. They had the usual basmati rice, naan and tandoori chicken. Obviously those are very hard to screw up. I however had a delicious chilly gobi made with cauliflower which I helped myself to 3x. Palak Paanar a traditional spinach and garbanzo bean dish was great and a slopped it all over my naan. I really enjoyed the Dal!! I however am a fan of any type of lentil. But this was great it had a kick of spice and I loved the cilantro finish. What I really liked best was the texture some lentils were still whole and others almost mashed. I ate this like a soup, over my rice and also dipped my naan in the bowl. By far my favorite dish there. Vermicelli pudding was the choice I picked for dessert. I really am not a dessert lover and sweet sugar rice with raisins and almond bits just is not my thing.

The only thing I didn't like was how tiny it is, especially in the winter when the outdoor seating isn't available.  But they have a mini bar you can sit at while you wait for a seat and get a drink.  Their house drinks are interesting and generally well made.  My favorite is the Nirvana - it's champagne, St. Germain and tonic.  Not really Indian but still lovely.  The food is delicious, albeit heavy.  We had the chicken tikka masala, lamb korma, and one another occasion, the chicken biryani.  Firstly, the portions are MASSIVE.  The one bowl of any curry is really for two people.  The naan was delicious, fresh and pillowy soft.  The meats were well flavored and tenderized.But what blew me away was the little bowl of yellow daal (lentils).  They serve little bowls of daal as well, with all their meals... I like this b/c Indian food is typically a collection of tapas in that sense, different curries and stews, with rice AND naan etc and it's nice to recreate the typical experience.  Daal is also the standard of which I hold Indian restaurants to.  If you can't make a good daal, you most likely can't make good food.  The daal at Karma is amazing.  It tastes almost just like my mother's and is traditional and refined.   Service was courteous and prompt.  The prices are a steal for the amount and quality of food.  The only negatives are that the place is incredibly tiny and the food is heavy and not somewhere I'd eat more than once a month, at most.  But it's cute place to take people to and a solid representation of Indian cuisine.",Karma Kafe,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

Indian-hot was certainly spicy and I was sweating and tearing while eating but that's the best kind of spicy! LOL It was sooo flavorful and even the basmati rice (which is usually just a boring filler in Indian food) was delish and soft. The mozzarella naan was the best part ..

I can't speak for authenticity since I've not been to India yet, but I've been to Srilanka and they like their food spicy. Karma Kafe offers some spicy dishes that will knock your socks off and they are so good but not for the faint of heat.Ask the waiter for spicy level if you're concerned, and remember, to them something that's insanely spicy for us will be ""it's a little spicy"".We love the Karma Naan, Lamb Vindaloo, Tandoori dishes, Shrimp Malabar (yummm) and lots of others. Honestly, I think only once I had a dish that I didn't love because it was a little too salty. But 99% of the time everything is fantastic. I love that they have a bar as well and the server's are generally warm if you engage them. It's a pinch pricey but the portions can definitely be shared. Two entrees and one appetizer is alot of food so be prepared to take some home.The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because many of the dishes are rich and heavy.

Chickpeas with spinach and tomato -- Great choice for a vegetarian entree or side.  Flavorful, and not too oily compared to the other dishes.  Even a little spicy.Lamb Achera -- this was great!  Originally was going to go with Lamb Vindaloo, but the manager suggested I go with this instead, because it's less spicy.  It looked quite oily when we opened the tray, but it was one of the best lamb dishes I've had.  Very popular.  The naan and whole wheat bread was also great, as was the rice.  They accommodated when I asked that they throw in two extra containers of rice since we had such a big order.Overall, really happy with both the food and the delivery experience with Karma Kafe.  We order food quite often, and it's great to be able to work with a restaurant that is easy to communicate with, timely, and responsive.  If I can get my team to do Indian again, we'll definitely be going back to Karma Kafe.",Karma Kafe,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

Each entree could feed at least 2-3 people! I wish my bf and I knew for the large portions before we over ordered and had to drag out butts back to the PATH and into Manhattan.The samosas were a bit too salty for me. I had a curry chickpea and potato dish. I enjoyed the curry flavor soaked up by the chickpeas but the potatoes were not cooked thoroughly enough. They were still hard and didn't absorb any of the flavor of the curry. My boyfriend had lamb in a spinach sauce. Good flavor but extremely dry and tough meat. I also ordered a mango lassi that I felt was a tad too sweet. I was pretty disappointed especially with all these rave reviews on yelp.

It just wasn't as soft/light/fluffy as it should be. The papri chaat was fine, but how can you screw that up...The chicken tikka masala's flavor was the highlight of the meal. It was a nice tomato base with a nice amount of heat. However, there were a few pieces of dry chicken...So no matter how good the flavor is, if you get dry chicken all bets are off...The chana palak taste just wasn't all there for me...Aloo chole was very bland almost tasteless...Note the diners at the table next to me also pushed both the chana palak and aloo chole aside...and stated ""I want more of the chicken tikka, thats the only thing thats good...""The menu online also says there is desert to be had (as a part of the buffet)....there was none...",Karma Kafe,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

341,xMNbh4gKsycoGc1Vm8omzA,Jonathan F.,5.0 star rating,"Karma Kafe is hands down the best Indian food in Hoboken, and perhaps the best in the entire tri-state area.  For the past two years I have been coming to Karma Kafe, as well as trying every other Indian restaurant and hole-in-the-wall [all over New Jersey and New York].  I have yet to find a better place than Karma Kafe.I've tried close to every dish at Karma, but my favorite is the Lamb Vindaloo [and I ask them to make it deathly spicy for me].  To be honest, you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.  I've never had the slightest moment of disappointment while eating at Karma.  If you are unhappy, or even if the employees THINK that you aren't enjoying it as much as usual, they will come out with additional dishes for you to ""try"" at no extra charge.My parents were the ones who got me into Indian when I was younger, and since then I have been begging to get my friends to come with me and try it.  Finally one-by-one, I was getting friends to come with me.  Now it's to the point where every single week, I have a dozen+ friends calling me and messaging me saying ""Karma Sunday?!""  I'm always like "" Dude, I was just there yesterday... What time should we meet?"".In fact, my best friend who lives in the UES has been a Karma fan with me for well over a year now.  He hikes all the way from 85th street to Hoboken to eat here.  He had been in Columbia Presbyterian Hospital for the past two months [he's OK now, don't worry], and I would get text messages from him in his hospital bed saying "" Get me out of here, I want KARMA"" as well as "" VINDALOOOOO"".The service is top-notch - I'm absolutely dumbfounded to read peoples reviews stating that service could have been better.  How?  The employees do not stop moving at all, sometimes I feel as if my glass is being refilled with water as I'm drinking it.Hands down my favorite restaurant in the tri-state and worth trying, regardless if you say you do or do not like Indian food.  If you're a first timer, I suggest you come here with an open mind, during the buffet [which I think runs everyday from 12-4.  Sundays seem to be the best however].  Whether you know what's in the dish or not, try it - you will be amazed.Karma for life baby.Jonathan",Karma Kafe,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

352,fwmQHOYpvYHnlR9A2vxPEQ,Jackie N.,3.0 star rating,"I've been here a few times on weekdays. The lunch buffet, while reasonably priced, does not have enough seafood or vegetarian dishes for it to be a viable option for me (ovo-pescetarian). Because of this, I've only ever ordered off of the full-menu. Although the portions are large, I'm not sure the cost is justified. The Crab Cake Makhani ($19) is not made with jumbo lump crab meat, but it is also not made with too much breading so I think whether you enjoy it depends on what type of crab cake you prefer. The sauce is amazing - definitely the component of the dish that makes it delicious. I've also enjoyed the Bombay Shrimp and Koliwada Fish appetizers - I would probably get one of these as an entree if I were to go back again just because the portions and the richness of the food is more than I'm used to.Each time I've been there for lunch, the tables fill-up quickly. It gets pretty noisy, especially if there are kids dining (or kids with parents that don't bother controlling their children), so I wouldn't recommend this as a good place for a business lunch.

You have the choice of ordering it mild, medium or hot. I went with mild since it was my first time trying this dish. It was excellent! It also came with a few sauces in addition to the rice. The chicken and rich along with the naan were more than filling on their own - I'm looking forward to eating my left overs for lunch tomorrow.The only complaint I have is that the deliver did take a while. I ordered on Seamless Web and it did say it would take 60-75 minutes, which was pretty accurate, I guess it was just wishful thinking on my part ... or I was very hungry :) I think I found a new go to spot for take out.",Karma Kafe,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

An acquaintance was working for a time for an Indian Place in Hoboken called Bombay West; he encouraged me to try it, so naturally i went to Yelp to check on its reviews. It had a lackluster 3 stars and relatively few reviews, and a lot of the reviewers seemed to use Karma Kafe at a base for Comparison. After Perusing their attractive internet menu, I ordered a couple of the Lunch Box Combos from Karma Kafe. It was terrific!

Didn't know that until a friend visited and they pulled out their parking ticket with their credit card.The servings here of most dishes come with a cool lentil soup, a bed of basmati rice, and a little bit of salad. I rarely eat the salad, though.Naan here comes literally one piece (cut into two) per order. Sometimes overcooked and crisp, slightly disappointing. The garlic naan here wasn't nearly as buttery and garlicky as I would've liked.On the other hand, the vindaloo curry is super-spicy, even for the Indian friends I brought along that claimed to be able to eat anything..! There's more than enough sauce on most dishes to dip your naan of choice into it, though. The chicken tikka masala is delicious, spicy or not (although if you get a spicy dish after ordering non-spicy, they just dilute it with some cream to remove the spiciness). A bit of hard bread at the beginning to snack on while you wait for your order, too, along with some spicy sauces (3) for tasting.Decently packed, and some ""traditional"" seating near the windows, but for the most part, filled with space for people to relax in.",Karma Kafe,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

The reason I am giving them a 2 star review is because of poor customer service. I made an order through Delivery.com at 6:04pm and didn't receive the delivery until 2 hours later. When I called the restaurant, they didn't apologize, simply stating that the delivery was sent out. When the delivery person came, she also reiterated the same statements. I didn't tip her, given her lack of customer service (and I am a good tipper). Of interest, Karma Kafe also charges a $2 delivery fee, which does not include the tip. For what?!If they simply apologized, that would have sufficed as I understand that these things can happen from time to time. But the lack of good customer service will cause me to avoid an otherwise decent restaurant.05/13/2010: Received an apology from the restaurant with a 50% discount off the next order.

378,c6Z3aag-BPzcPOgNCfpJ3w,Nicole M.,3.0 star rating,"Let me start my review by saying that I have only had food delivered from Karma, I have never dined in. My roommate introduced me to indian food, and Karma has been my go-to spot whenever I get a craving for it. I have had a few things on the menu and the food is usually delicious. I was surprised, however, that no other reviewers have encountered the same issue as me- I have found that the food is often inconsistent. Like I said, Karma is my first experience with indian food so I am not sure how things are supposed to taste, I just know what I like. And I have noticed when ordering the same thing repeatedly, it has been somewhat different every time. Examples-Onion kulcha- usually delicious, sometimes underdone (I don't like mine crispy so I don't mind this very much), often not enough onion at all.Raita- one of my favorite dipping sauces ever, but the consistency and taste has been different lately. I have had it the consistency of yogurt, and also the consistency of milk, and everything in between. Several times it has also had a noticeable sweet flavor that isn't usually there.Pakora- sometimes they are very good, but sometimes they are very very oily and over-fried. The seasoning is usually spot-on though.These three are items I order regularly. The gingery coconut chicken soup is delicious (somewhat salty, but still delicious).As other reviewers have noted, the delivery is not speedy whatsoever. It has taken up to two hours for me to receive a dinner order on a random week night. One time, I was told the delivery person was a block away from my apartment after waiting over an hour for my food to arrive. 30 minutes later, I called again and was put on ""hold"" (I could hear everything going on), the gentleman who answered the phone scolded the delivery person and asked him why my order had been sitting there for an hour. He then returned to the phone and apologized and said that the delivery person was a block away (again) and would be there shortly. It was clearly a lie, but my food did arrive after that, albeit very late, and also cold (I had ordered soup).I have become frustrated with the service lately and am ordering much less often, but some days the food is worth the wait.",Karma Kafe,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

I've probably been to Karma a handful of times - a few times for the lunch buffet and a few take outs and here is my experience so far.Lunch Buffet - While they offer a limited selection (maybe 6 -8 different choices) they certainly serve up my favorites. The food, when fresh, is EXCELLENT. However, there have been times that the service can be slow and they can be brutually slow to replace the food. Most likely, it is because they are cooking it fresh, so when they do get around to replacing it, be sure to be the first in line to snag the goods! At a very reasonable price, it can be well worth the investment if you catch them the right time.Take Out - I've ordered from them a few times, and they have been pretty good. It can be a bit pricey on a college student budget, but they do accept duckbills (my experience with this to follow). Accepts Duckbills - If there are any Stevens Students reading this review, then it is important to note that Karma accepts duckbills, but only when their machine is working. Dbills have a notorious habit of not working if the restaurant neglects the machine, or even if they take pristine care of it. I went to Karma to try to unload some of my ""fake"" money only to find that it wasn't working and I had blown $30 of my real hard earned cash. So just  be prepared to have cash or credit on hand if their machine is down.Out of all the Indian places in Hoboken, I'd return to the Karma Kafe for sure. But I guess it would depend on whether I was feeling lucky or not. Maybe I could do a few good deeds during the day and hope that Karma is on my side (pun INTENDED).",Karma Kafe,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

I am indian so i know good indian food when i have it. i ordered:-papdi chaat - this is meant to be very yogurty and have a sweet tamarind sauce in there amongst the crackers, masalas, chickpea, onion, coriander, etc. there was hardly any yogurt or sauce - very dry and the crackers weren't crunchy either. chicken tikka masala - tastes ok but nothing wow. there weren't many chicken pieces but so much sauce to make the tub look fuller. garlic naan - this was pretty good. soft and freshraita - the yogurt was soooo watered down! indian raita is meant to be much thicker than how kafe karma serve it. the tomatoes didn't taste fresh either(last time i ordered a mango lasso which was ridiculously watered down too.) i also ordered a mango colada which didn't arrive. i had to call them back to remind them. it arrived 20mins later. the drink itself is pretty good. my total came to $32 for 1 person. a bit pricey for what it is. i wouldn't order from here again. may try the buffet as its much cheaper and you can see what you are about to eat",Karma Kafe,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

I usually order chicken tikka masala (which is what she ordered) whenever I go to an Indian restaurant, but this time I decided to ""branch out"" and order the chicken vindaloo with garlic naan. While the chicken was tasty, it was really spicy but luckily my water glass was filled every few minutes lol. The server even gave me riata to take away some of the spice which made the dish taste even better. The garlic naan was excellent, as well as the mango salsa and the free dessert of mango ice cream was delicious too! I truly enjoyed my experience and my friend enjoyed her meal as well.

It was so hot, I slurped down my water and the mango lassi to put out the fire. My bf's comment... gotta bring the snorkel when eating this dish so you don't drown in your sweat.

The prices for the main dishes are not cheap, but they give you a good amount of both meat and sauce, and it's pretty darn good. The Naan is also not bad, but it's PRICEY, since they are $3 each for one thin slice. The tables are a bit small, and they do not often refill the water glasses unless asked. Nothing special about the basmati rice, but I generally just eat naan as the staple.I'm a big fan of the chicken tikka masala, but they make it a little spicy for my tastes. Would not touch the Chicken vindaloo due to the level of spice, although my husband loves it. Given the price and my recent forays into making yummy chicken tikka masala from scratch at home, I rarely visit this place anymore. However, if I'm ever feeling lazy and just want some good, consistent Indian food, this is where I would go.Also, while they have validated parking, it's about 3 blocks away from the restaurant itself, so be prepared to walk.",Karma Kafe,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

I also recommend trying the specialty non-alcoholic fruit concoctions.  My chief complain is the beer selection, which includes typical Indian beer ""trappings,"" such as the awful Kingfisher and Taj Mahal, as well as standards, like Miller Lite and Sam Adams Boston Lager, which is the only star on the menu, but only marginally cuts through the spiciness. I prefer my Indian dishes spicy, and this requires beers like sharp European pilsners (Prima Pils, Sierra Nevada Summerfest), weissbiers (Hacker-Pschorr Weiss), pale ales (Sierra Nevada Pale Ale) or a farmhouse ale (Saison). Although different styles, all would help to balance out spiciness, while not overpowering the delicate spices. Without the hops and malt, wine doesn't stand a chance against traditional Indian cuisine.",Karma Kafe,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

472,vcykaaDjnk0ZQh7mAhMQIg,A R.,3.0 star rating,"Love the food. HOWEVER, I ordered from here via delivery.com. The order took 1 hr 15 minutes to arrive, and the delivery guy goes, ""How 'bout my tip?"" I've NEVER had that happen. I pointed out to him I added money to the $2.00 delivery fee on the Web site (the food total was $18). He said, ""But only $1.80."" I said, ""Yeah, that's in addition to th $2.00."" He told me he doesn't get the $2.00-- the restaurant keeps that. So, thinking maybe he has a family to feed, I ran back up the 4 flights to my apartment and got 2 more dollars for him. A dollar eighty cents isn't much, even though I was already paying nearly $4 in fees. But...seriously? I don't usually only tip 10% (I believe in tipping well), but if I did it would be at my discretion. I ended up paying about 30%, as if their food isn't expensive enough. At least he said thank you when I brought down the additional money.",Karma Kafe,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

I have eaten there a number of times, and each time I am flabbergasted at the prices they get away with. Dinner for three, delivered = $70!  My shrimp malabar was $17 and had like 4 small shrimp in it. Our lamb vindaloo had three chunks of lamb. We each got one. What a letdown. They do not provide enough rice to accompany their mostly sauce entrees. One order of regular naan is $3, and is not nearly enough for three people.That said, I basically could not go on living knowing that I could never have their Veggie Samosa again.",Karma Kafe,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

485,0krpcA4jjuZ1WDMKVcoIgQ,leah h.,4.0 star rating,"The closest I can get to being an authority to Indian food is that I am Asian. Okay, that is lame. But I have eaten at enough Indian restaurants to have basis in saying that so far, this place is my favorite. We (my hubby and I) went to Hoboken one summer Sunday with our 4 kids ages 5 to 17 (who are all in training to develop adventurous palates). We were the first customers for the night at 530pm.For appetizer we had the bhel poori. it was good. fresh and good spice-kick at the end of each bite. this is my first time trying this dish. so does my positive feedback still count? how about the fact that my kids had seconds? and no, i didn't force them.the main dish came out and it all surprised us. we are used to 1 small-bowl-per-dish size of serving. we didn't expect much especially for $12/dish.  this place apparently has not heard of that trend. and had we known that, we wouldn't have ordered: lamb korma, butter chicken, (hefty sized) half chicken tandoori, chicken kashmiri and naan pizza for my 5 year old. Usually, we don't mind ordering less food at Indian Restaurants because the leftover sauce of any dish, we wipe the bowls clean with extra naans. And that fills up whatever holes are left in our stomach. But not this time, no holes were left to fill. A brightly-lit Gluttony sign was flashing in my mind every time I take a bite to try and finish what is left on the table. Alas, I wiped my curry drenched fingers and gave up at 3 half-filled bowls of curry.The place has nice ambiance. The other end of the table we sat in has the bay window instead of a chair. The service was prompt and attentive but not hovering. The price is unbeatable...hoping they don't scale down the serving size!I will definitely come back - even without the free app coupon they gave me after I paid.",Karma Kafe,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

The Chana Palak (chick peas, spinach veggie dish i think) is an eruption of flavor. And top all that off with Kulfi (indian version of pistachio ice cream). That stuff is just fantastic.
