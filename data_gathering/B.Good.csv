I didn't do anything to guy but really looked like he didn't want to be there and I always say if your grumpy and miserable at your job, careers, professional, service industry your making everyone else feel miserable, get out of the job if you hate it so much.  We as consumers would have a better experience at your stores and you'll probably have more customers. He also rolled his eyes when another customer was placing his order.  Ugh that look on his face.  It was disgusting have a grumpy look when your dealing w customers.  - sorry we came in. My second star is for the food.  My burger was small but good. My fries were a tiny portion and not worth the price.  The salad was ok but I wouldn't pay for it again when there's so many other options around.  I do know that when I eat happy, food does taste good so maybe it effected my tastebuds eh still the burger was good. So what do I know. I wouldn't come back here unless someone I know says something is really good here then I would go try it again. I still think the concept is great.

It's still reminds me of a fast food joint, but the atmosphere seems to emphasize on the quality of their ingredients. When you walk in they display all their fresh fruits and vegetables through their clear refrigerator and the huge map on the wall tells you which state and farm their ingredients are sourced from. Pretty cool.I didn't try any of the burgers, but my friends' burgers looked rather small. I'm pretty sure they weren't full after eating one burger. The fries were great though. They were the large potatoey-kinds, but still crispy. I chose the Harvest Kale salad with marinated kale, brussel sprouts, manchego cheese, sunflower seeds, beets, acorn squash, garbanzos, and sherry vinaigrette. The salad was quite tasty and loaded with ingredients. All the vegetables were fresh. The vinaigrette had a nice tart taste to it, but I think next time I would ask for a little less vinaigrette. But I'm not sure if they allow any requests like that. I like that you can look up the calorie count on their website. If I worked in the area, I would definitely come often to get their seasonal salads. In terms of price, it comes to around the same as Chop't or Sweetgreen in Manhattan.

Other than that, there's really nowhere to go for salad.Now there is. While it's a tad overpriced ($9.59 w/o tax), the salad I got was really good (Southwestern Salad).

I have brushed it off in the past but this evening (I called about 15 minutes ago) when I called and said I wanted to place an order for pick up she put me on hold for 5 minutes and then picked up the phone with an attitude telling me they were closing at 9 (25 minutes away) and when did I think I was going to be there. I explained that we were less than 5 minutes away at this point after being on hold and she hesitated for a while and I asked if it was a problem and if they would rather not have my business and rather than saying no she just asked for my name to begin taking an order.

The fries are very good. Their Breakfast menu from 7 - 11AM is absolutely, addictive and delicious. The Ham & Egg'er (ham, egg and cheese on some tasty english muffin) is my favorite, all time compared to other similar breakfast sandwiches in America. The breakfast bowls.. you cant go wrong with any of them. And they seasonally change parts of the menu; so it's possible an item that you really like (I was a big fan of the Side Vegetable cup) is gone but there are some new good one too.The new Eggplant Meatballs with Marinara sauce... I dont know what to do about those right now. I have already hooked three of my coworkers into these vegetables meatballs. delicious.

The veggies were extremely undercooked, with no seasoning. Basically I was left with a completely inedible meal.",B.Good,3.5 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, Juice, Bars, &, Smoothies,, Sandwiches"

It is a little on the pricier side for the quantity you receive but I suppose healthy food tends to cost more. The food does take some time to make, but they're making it fresh so it is worth the wait!",B.Good,3.5 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, Juice, Bars, &, Smoothies,, Sandwiches"
