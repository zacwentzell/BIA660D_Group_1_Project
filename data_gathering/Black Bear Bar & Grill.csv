But hey, I don't have high expectations of Hoboken, period, so this came to me as no surprise - Hoboken is all about dive bars and game nights, but nothing about quality. The atmosphere is fine and our waitress was sweet. The men's and women's restrooms face each other and the main door was kept open. That's... quite unnerving but at least it wasn't disgusting inside.

I don't eat ethnic or hunting food bc I tried vennisson 1nce when I was little and then I got chicken pox but my dude Danny said Black Bear tasted like chopped meat. There are crazy hotties here. The hot girls from my home town come here bc they are to scared to go to NYC so this is like their fancy NYC bar for people from The Fallz. Allot of other towns' hotties come here to.

On the bright side, they still have  Tuesday Wing bucket & Pitcher of Beer Special for $19.99 -- I miss the days when they used to charge $12.99 for this special, but $20 still isn't a bad deal.  *Pro tip - don't get the boneless wings here, they are pretty abysmal. They also have trivia on Wednesday nights.  I'm a sucker for trivia.

Decided we would grab a quick bite to eat and sit outside since of course they are underage and it was great weather out. Asked the bouncer at the door if we could eat outside, he said it was fine but to tell the hostess. Advised the hostess got my menus and sat down. Time was 10 o clock pm, at 1030 one of the workers says we have to go inside because the outside area needs to be closed, I advised him I had just ordered my food, we would eat and head out. 5 minutes later my food arrives and so does the hostess to tell me they will be grabbing my food to bring it inside. I told her the kids were under 21 and at this point we had a sleeping 4 year old, just wanted to finish my food and leave she says okay and leaves. Minutes later the bus boy arrives Says we have to go inside now, again explained they are underage, and I have a sleeping 4 year old. Finally the manager comes out and says we have to go inside or leave. So I decided to leave the food I couldn't even finish half or enjoy because I was busy telling EVERY WORKER that I would be leaving as soon as I was able to finish my food.

I convinced my dad to get the specialty burger so I could just look at it. It had fried egg and onion rings. Overall, I remember the ahi tuna being blackened and spicy but the ahi was dry and rubbery inside, with chewy bits. Um, ew. And my dad barely finished his burger, stopping at one point to put more money in the meter. And usually, he's the person I can feed anything to and he'll scarf it down.

The food is OK and prices are what you would expect for a busy, young, bar-town. The bartender I had was really nice but the waitresses are in your face and annoying. The rest of the staff is just rude. They moved us from our table and let another group sit down while we were still ordering drinks. They also pushed everyone out of the way when moving a podium through the downstairs level, when they could have just asked people to move aside since there was plenty of room. To top it off my friend forgot to close his tab and they charged him an additional $50.

The nightly specials and happy hour deals are quite appealing ($19.99 pitcher of Yeung with a bucket of wings on Tuesdays, for example, or buy one get one select apps from 4-8pm), and for bar food, it's pretty damn delicious (I recommend the Bear Bites, the steak sandwich, and the shrimp wrap).

If you don't know how they work - basically you get a glass of ice and vodka, then you're free to add your own mixes and fixes. Here at Black Bear you get a pint glass and it's seasoned with a spicy mixture. I opted for pineapple habanero hot sauce while my other half went heavy on the horseradish.For food we ordered the Taylor Ham (link in case you aren't familiar with this Jersey delicacy), egg and cheese on a kaiser roll and a side of French onion soup. You might think this is an odd mixture, but it was windy out and the soup hit the spot. Actually it was one of the better french onions we have had and the sandwich was definitely on point.We always look for more in a bartender than being an epic drink-slinger and our new friend Michelle fit the bill. Since we are so comfortable at bar stools, it's always nice to feel like you're hanging out. Michelle is a Jameson drinker - so that automatically makes her cool in our book. She also is rooting for Manny Pacquiao in the big fight coming up, so we got to talk some sports.What was most impressive to us about this spot is the bar specials. They have specials every single day and they are actually enticing (we plan to come back for the bucket of wings and pitcher of Yuengling for $20 on Tuesdays). A lot of bars in Hoboken tend to get reputations for rowdy college crowds, so if you like your elbow room, we suggest going early for lunch and hitting up the awesome happy hours. But if you like doing body shots off a stranger and chugging beers in a packed bar with hunting props, this could be your spot too!If you check out Black Bear on Yelp you will see a lot of misspelled whining - mostly over things that could be avoided. If you don't want a crowded, noisy bar, you should know what times to go out in Hoboken; it's not exactly trigonometry.

It was Mac and Cheese topped with cheese Doritos and then topped with more cheese. If you like Doritos, I'm sure you'll like this dish. The Doritos added a cool crunch to the Mac and Cheese.

This, however, is one of the good things about coming there on non gamedays.

It is one of the better sports bars in Hoboken, and i've never had a problem with the crowd it attracts. Here are my pros and cons:Pros: good weeknight specials. The tuesday yuengs and wings special (bucket of wings and pitcher of beer) is great to split with someone and i think its only $15. The thursday half off ladies night deal is also great if you are or know a lady. I think their appetizers are delicious. I drool over their chicken quesadillas and buffalo wings. The food prices arent terrible either especially the appetizer discounts during happy hour. I also love their specialty shots. Ive never had the bartender question me when i asked for a bday cake shot or a buttery nipple. They usually can make anything.Cons: they have a ton of rules that they strictly enforce. You can only benefit from happy hour specials AT the bar which really sucks because you can't come with a large good or else youre stuck at a table paying full price. Their credit card minimum is $25 so make sure to bring cash if you plan to get a quick drink at the bar. At night they slowly turn up the volume so at 6pm happy hour you can talk like a normal person, but by 8pm i have to scream to talk which can be annoying.",Black Bear Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"

I was in Black Bear minding my own business and having an ok time dancing when apparently I danced too close to some incredibly sensitive and stuck up ladies. Never touched or bumped them, but apparently breathing the air within five feet of them was enough to have them start yelling at me to move and get lost. I proceeded to ignore them and told them I had no reason to listen to them since I was doing nothing wrong, and their response was to come get in my face and choke me. When I removed the hand from my neck, security came and of course immediately believed the girls were the victims, because how could a group of ladies ever be in the wrong? I decided it wasn't worth the argument and said I would leave no problem--I just wanted my coat. The security guard asserted that I could not get my coat and that I had to wait outside (in 35 degrees) without my coat until he went back and got it. I still cooperated. I was escorted outside like a petty criminal, and then gave extremely explicit directions to where my coat was and what it looked like. After five minutes, the guard returned....with the wrong coat. I still cooperated. I told the guy at the door wearing a scarf over his mouth what happened and he less than eagerly called the guard back to the door. He took the other person's coat they gave me and simply threw it on the ground next to the door. When the guard came back to the door I again told him exactly where it was and he said he looked everywhere and that it wasn't there. I then asked if I could simply walk with him to the spot where it was and check. I was told no. Instead, the Black Bear's senseless, intolerable grunts at the door decided to berate me and get belligerent because I told them it was unacceptable to have me stand like a bozo in the freezing cold because they were too clueless to find my coat. I then had Ben (the ""bigshot"" with a headset) come tell me that I should leave, go to Dunkin Donuts, and come back in the morning for it. All the while as this was happening I was being repeatedly demeaned and treated like a lower class citizen with arrogant remarks like ""I wouldn't let this happen to me, so I don't feel bad you don't have a coat"" and ""I wouldn't let a girl choke me so that's your problem."" Big Boy Ben eventually notified me that it was pointless that I was still waiting because no one would look for my coat at this point, and that I wouldn't be allowed in. Finally, the other big bouncer decided he had enough of me losing my patience while slowly succumbing to frostbite, and decided getting right in my face and telling me to ""get the **** out of here"" was the next best solution.After 30 MINUTES, I then decided to take matters into my own hands. I called the Hoboken police and explained what happened. They weren't thrilled to be wasting their time with such garbage (I don't blame them), but guess what? They escorted me inside Black Bear, I went to where I said my coat was, and sure enough it was right where I left it.

I didn't want to deal with anyone no more and just decided to go right next door. When I got to the bouncer I asked him jokingly if they declined passports and the bouncer laughed, and asked me why would they refuse to accept it. That night we went to 3 different bars, all which didn't even question her ID accept for them. I guess this bar is exclusive for ""Americans"" and don't care about tourists!!!

Don't expect anything that you couldn't get anywhere.  I love the pulled pork sliders, but I ordered as a meal ($1 more) and they sucked.  The pork was not drenched in the rub which is a big no no.  They also served it on a stale Italian roll.  Pulled pork should be served on nothing other than a brioche bun.The drinks are a bit overprices and based on the bartender you get, your drink strength hangs in the balance.  The bill was over $100 for 3 drinks each and specials.  On a positive note, the boody mary bar is cool for brunch.  This was a tough two star but we gotta keep it honest.  I will come back though to see if they can redeem.",Black Bear Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"

We paid $20 per person cover to enter which is a bit steep but whatever we paid it. We didn't expect to pay $10 for an 8oz bud light after paying $20 per person to enter. That was incredibly high and taking advantage of people. For a bar that never charges a cover besides on special days like this, charging $10 for a small beer is ridiculous.

Anyways-the happy hour food menu is also awesome because theyre basically 2 for 1..soooo we order the boneless buffalo chicken bites which are always delicious and spicy (though can always be a bit hotter temperature wise) as well as the mac and cheese which is AWESOME. The combo of these 2 bar bites just works with the spicyneas of the buffalo bites and the warm rich taste of the mac and cheese-they are a perfect pair! We usually wind up ordering the same thing twice during happy hour-thats how good it is! Weve also tried the mini pizza they have which is very thin crust and tasty! The regar wings are great too especially when they have their bucket of wings with a pitcher of beer special for 20 bucks-cant beat it! The sliders here are also amazing-this bar has really awesome bar food which is super important for me beause all I want to do when drinking is eat! As for the bar itself, i love the music that plays during happy hour-a reallt good mix (not just a typical top 40 type of playlist). The upstairs area is great for watching games with all of the tvs. They run different specials daily which you can keep up with on instagram!

169,6Dq7pcKVXur-iJDDE-M6kg,Michael C.,4.0 star rating,"I feel like there are 2 different Black Bears.  My rating is for the first version.1 version is during the week, when you can get some great bar food and decent beer.  You can sit at the bar and watch some games on the Wall of Flat screens.  Or you can sit outside or upstairs and have a conversation.  The bucket of wings on Tuesday is a great deal (get the firecracker wings) and overall the food is surprisingly good.  Then there's the other version of Black Bear.  The version on the weekends where if I don't walk in with a decent buzz beforehand, I want to walk right out.  The bar gets way too pack with entitled, awful people.  It's funny when there's a big game going on during a Saturday night.  The place will be great, with everyone focused on the TVs (or the giant projector screen).  And then once the game is over, the sports crowd leaves and the place fills up with Lana Lounge/Trinity/Teak people and it gets tough to enjoy yourself.  Or I'm just getting old.",Black Bear Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"

However, I was wearing a nice sweater and black shoes. My jeans were loose fitted and I find them more comfortable that way.If I was dressed shabbily then I could understand being turned down, but honestly that was not the case. In addition I have been here before plenty of times before and I go solely to have a good time and not for any adverse reason such as starting beef. So it was kind of ridiculous for them to turn me down just because my pants were too baggy.As a result, I never want to go here or to give this place any future business.

My average bucket is 30-35 wings and it's good to split with 1 or 2 people.

177,w3czn31CGNmzHFtsWxmuVg,Denise C.,3.0 star rating,"I met up with a few friends here to watch the Rangers. We went on Saturday and, thinking venue continuity was the best way to bring our Blueshirts some good luck (we're superstitious when it comes to the playoffs!), we stopped in again last night. The main bar area has at least fifteen TVs in addition to a projector. They also have a back room for those who want a sit-down dinner (an option if you have kids) and an upstairs with even more TVs for your viewing pleasure. Needless to say, it caters to every sports fan. To call it a Rangers bar might be a bit of a stretch. But they definitely root for them there, as evidenced by the wall decor and the fact that they hosted a viewing party not too long ago.I appreciated that they turned on the sound for each game and I even put up with the ""music"" during intermissions, because I'd rather listen to terrible music than Mike Milbury. The draft beer selection is nothing to write home about and is geared towards what I consider the ""typical jockish sports fan"" sort: Bud Light, Coors Light, Sam Adams, Yuengling, etc. So if you're a craft beer person like me, you won't be too impressed. But they do offer good specials each day, such as $6 large Stella mugs on Saturdays.They serve standard bar food. I got the portobello chicken wrap. Veg was roasted properly; chicken was a little dry, but the entire thing was good. It was also pretty big and one half was enough for me. The fries were just okay: crispy but with a very oily aftertaste. I've been told the wings are the item to get there (especially on Tuesdays when they're part of the special), but I have not yet had them.Service was spotty on Saturday, as our server seemed a bit flustered by the influx of Ranger fans and then by some bar crawl crowd. Monday it was better (and yes, it was even busy, but not overwhelming, on a Monday).The crowd was typical of Washington Street: young, tan, and, in some cases, obnoxious. There were several groups of people who came in and thoroughly annoyed the piss out of me (when the majority of us are rooting for the Rangers and concentrating on the hockey game, we don't want anyone else in our way).

I usally come to this bar / resturant too often. ... not gonna lie but I m regular here. ....First of all I like this bar bc its a sports bar with many big screen TVs for games.  Edpically during football season its grest too come out here n  chill with ppl around you. Football season gets special due too there games n free gifts that they give out.  Superball time they even throw free caps, t- shirts etc. I have been regular customer during Superball game from last the year n I love it. It ia crowded here but I love when there are people during game time.  Good is ok. Add everyone says ..... can't beat their wing specials. Good food n friendly staff members.  Weekends are pretty pack here (Friday's & Saturday). I was there last Friday n it seemed like it was Saturday night.  Couldn't find a space to even walk. It was over crowded.  I think they should stop the entry when it getgets to pack.  Can't even do to the bar to get drinks.  But it was day before NYE so it was expected. Besides that i like to come here of Sunday football. I like the decorations for the place makes me feel like I m sitting in a wooden house,  which I love. Ambience is pretty good followed by some good music. Very few place plays good music whixh you like n I like it here. It's personal choice tho. ....Summer time they have outside tables n open ups their patios for customers.  During summer's you can sit outside n still can watch  you're fresh games n shows.

Fortunately for us, my friend knew the bouncer and pulled in a little favor to bump us up the waiting list.

While we were waiting on the rather long line to get in, I saw the bouncer, a young, tan-skinned man with hair long on the top but shaved on the sides, take a girl's ID and put it in his pocket without letting the girl enter the bar. After she quietly and politely asked for it back and assured that she would not return, his totally inappropriate reply was ""You're so beautiful, i'd definitely like to see you come back"". The man accompanying the girl assured him that they didn't want trouble and just would like the ID back, the bouncer replied, out in the open, ""How much are you going to give me"" and to ""Make an offer"" to get the ID card back. The male friend of the girl made an offer, at which the bouncer laughed at the apparently insufficient amount of money offered. After much discussion, the bouncer refused and the couple left the line. Later, I witnessed two other girls before me in line have their ID's pocketed by the same bouncer, only to get them back and enter the bar after paying the bouncer what looked like over $80. It seems clear that this bouncer was very inappropriate, had no regard for actually keeping under-age people out of the bar, and was also running a business out of his pocket, charging people to get their own property back.

Sam Adams mug for 10 bucks..burgers/beer - $10 speaking my language. Well the beer was big but they should really say MINI MINI burgers these things were so tiny, they made white castle burgers look like something from Fudruckers. No fries, side or anything so I asked for a side of fries...$4 for a side of fries...really?? Not like they were gourmet or anything just Sysco food fries. Sigh ok. The service at this visit was great.The 2nd time I went was before a kickball game for happy hour. They have wings and yuengs for $13, this deal you can't beat. I love my yuengling and I love my wings. The wings were pretty good no complaints I'd get them again and there are a TON of them. We got the hot and the Chipotle BBQ, but it's just BBQ the Chipotle part wasn't there. The waitress was meh. She seemed more interested in the guys wearing mesh muscle shirts behind us (yup not kidding). It took forever to get refills on beer, water, etc.The 3rd and likely last time was this past Sunday for brunch. We looked at the menu it was cheap, looked decent and we were hungover and didn't feel like walking further (that's the real reason). The waitress was nice at first, brought us our drinks then took our order. Here is where it gets weird. About 7-8 minutes after placing our order the waitress comes over and says ""You guys doing OK, need anything else or will just the check be it?"" I was like um...before I pay for my food I'd prefer to eat it. She had no clue that we hadn't eaten yet, keep in mind she had a total of 3 tables in the upstairs and spent most of her time talking to the other bartender. I waited tables for 5 years and I never heard of anyone forgetting their table hadn't eaten especially after only a few minutes. Then the table behind us who came in AFTER we ordered got their food. We sat there waiting, waiting...wait for it...waiting. The waitress never once came over and said you're food is coming out soon etc. Then when we finally got it my girlfriends potatoes were cold. She plopped it down, no apology for the 30 minutes it took (we ordered a pork roll sandwich and an omlette, not groundbreaking time consuming entrees). Never checked back in with us to see how it was, nothing. She plopped the check down and we left as soon as we could. Honestly, I've had bad servers before but this girl was a space cadet.

Even more fail was that we had finished eating and were enjoying our drinks, then were told to hurry up so they could rearrange upstairs into a dance area. EPIC FAIL.I do have a funny story about this place. I was brought here for my 21st birthday and they had bingo, which is kinda funny in and of itself. Well, my friend won a t-shirt and asked for an extra one for me for my birthday, and when she told the announcer that I was a large he gave her a large...a youth large. I put it on as a joke and looked like Bruce Banner about to Hulk up.",Black Bear Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"

The food is pretty good for a random bar as well, normal stuff with buffalo wings to quesadilla's.The dance floor upstairs is weird because it is normally filled with ridiculously drunk guys/girls with a nice crowd of drunk guys making a circle around the dancing...just watching.

Within a few minutes my friend pings me about Black Bear. He tells me to check out their Yuengs and Wings special.* Based on his advice, I hit up the place at around 8.30. It was fully packed downstairs and upstairs. I had to wait for quite some time to grab a seat. * The bar has a large number of TV screens for watching sports. I mean you could watch TV from any cornor of the bar. Black Bear is essentially a sports bar streaming all kinds of sports - Tennis, Football, Racing, etc.* So after sitting down comfortably, I asked for the Yuengs and Wings special for 12.95. I chose the medium spicy wings. Couldn't wait to get my hands on the wings. * Within minutes, I got a big Yuengling pitcher to drink. Then came the bucket of wings served with blue cheese and carrots. It was huge - I mean it had some 20-25 wings. It was too heavy for me alone. But as I was terribly hungry, I ate it all like a pig.

It took way to long to get a drink at the bar so that would probably be my biggest complaint.I've been there 2 other times for dinner on Tuesday and that's where most of my 4 rating comes from. On Tuesdays there's a bucket of wings and a pitcher of Yeungling for $12.99 and each additional pitcher is $8. The wings are very good and they give you a good amount.

I've had anywhere from 18-30 wings in a bucket. I've tried the Jamaican Jerk, Chipotle BBQ, Honey BBQ, Teriyaki, and Firecracker BBQ. By far, the Jamaican Jerk is the best. Perfect crisp with a flavorful sauce & is not dry at all. It's sweet but also has a slight tang at the end (I have a high tolerance for spicy food so to others it may be spicy). I wasn't a big fan of the Firecracker - it was not spicy at all (the Jamaican had more of a kick than this) and it was rather dry. is my favorite (Chipotle BBQ tasted like regular BBQ sauce w/ a slight kick). I have introduced these wings to over 15 friends and every single one agreed that these were the best wings.I've had their regular food as well (a wrap that came with fries - was very good). Everyone else in our group liked their meal as well.Waiters/waitresses are usually fun and attentive.FYI: Green rock is the place to go afterwards. $1 mugs of yuengling, coors light or miller light all night long.

The happy hour specials drew me in and then subsequently drove me away. Okay, so half-price drinks and half-price appetizers is nothing extraordinary, but decent nevertheless. Plus with a sizeable bar and drink selection, it seemed like it was worth a shot. There were three of us, so we grabbed a hi-top next to the bar rather than sitting in a row at the bar itself. We proceeded to spend a good 90 minutes of alternating our order between drinks and apps and the server was fairly bubbly and friendly with us. Good so far. Then when we get the bill, there are no discounts at all, everything is full price. When this was brought to the server's attention, the response could not have been more prepared. ""Happy hour specials are only good AT the bar, it says so on the menu."" (In small print no less). Really? We're six feet away from the bar at a bar hi-top (not a dinner table), and it never occurred to you to perhaps float out a friendly reminder that the happy hour specials, likely the reason why just about everyone who's there at 4:30p on a weekday is there, only applies if you literally sit at or order from the bar? Again, the response was so blunt that it's as if they've been coached to play this little trick on unsuspecting patrons. There was no remorse or attempt to resolve. We chalked this gaffe, albeit one that cost us an additional $35 (for nothing, really), up to us perhaps not being diligent in our review of the ""rules"".

I'm not one to write off an establishment for one incident, particularly if it could be argued that the situation could have turned out differently. In other words, I'll learn from the mistake. So this time, I remember to order my stuff from the bar, even though there is no room to sit at the bar. I figure surely they can't have a finite amount of people that can participate in a happy hour special just based on how many seats are at the bar. Just order from the bar and all is good. ""Newcastle please,""  I say as I also make a quick point to the taps. The bartender reaches into the refrigerator, cracks open a Newcastle bottle and pours it into a glass. ""$7"" she says. ""$7? What happened to half-price happy hour."" ""Oh that's for drafts only."" What? A place has a half-off special for drinks, I order one and somehow they assume I wanted the full-price bottle? Again, there was no remorse from the bartender and she explained in not so many words that the damage is already done, the bottle is open and poured and now it's mine. So pay I do, drink and out the door to hit up a more reliable joint.What did I learn? Well, it had appeared to me, that Black Bear took pride in making you work for the happy hour specials. It shouldn't take that much effort. Happy hours are a dime a dozen and I'll be glad to spend mine at a place that is not interested in pulling the all-too-frequent ruse.(The second star is because the beer variety and quality of the appetizers was pretty good, just pay attention because no one there will help you out.)",Black Bear Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"

We tried to explain to her that everything is fine, but before we even finished she called security who were sooo rude to my boyfriend and pushed him a few times, very disrespectful. He was being very nice and respectful and just wanted to get my purse back (since i dropped it) he couldnt even do that because the big bouncer in the front pushed him and yelled at him to leave.

303,dOisEUVsc-O7VLiiKLp9Zg,Alex C.,3.0 star rating,"Black Bear is one of the better places to watch sports in Hoboken.  Plenty of TVs and if your team is featured (Yanks, G-men, Rangers) they play it over the loud speaker and there is usually prizes and lots of rowdy fans.  Drinking off special gets kind of expensive but not too bad.  The food is actually really good, I was surprised because most bar food is shit.  But the sliders deal on wednesdays is great and they are quite good - 8.95 for a 25oz sam adams and 6 sliders and then $3 25oz sams all night does me dirty.  I have found myself playing bingo every wednesday and winning numerous prizes.  They always have give aways or promo items which is good.  Going out at night here is not all that fun, its always packed and it's blazing hot even in the winter.  The top floor is better because there is more room but I would much rather go somewhere else to drink and party off special.",Black Bear Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"

Great atmosphere for Giants (and unfortunately Jets) games. The place gets packed with everyone cheering. That's the experience I enjoy as a fan. This year they bought probably 20-25 brand new TVs and upgraded their big screen projector. I don't think I've seen a better setup except in Vegas. Food is decent and beer seems to be reasonably priced by the pitcher. Not sure if love or hate this but they have a DJ every Sunday giving away prizes during halftime for trivia. I do love that they play music during commercial breaks. Arrive early to secure bar spot before your game.",Black Bear Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"

I have to do all the work and you're still going to charge me top shelf prices for Absolute?  Must be why that station is vacant the whole time we were there - suggestion, bring the price down to $5 at least and you've got yourself a catchy hook to get drinkers in.... My only other peeve of this place is the ""no drinks only"" outside rule for the patio.  This is ridiculous.  I can understand why they do this (to ensure higher ticket checks from diners for the servers) but 4 of us spent more at the bar in 2 hours than any diner in the bar...

309,RfzkmraN2Xf8aASG-ICNGQ,Ken O.,3.0 star rating,"Pretty nice sports bar and decent grub. Up front there's a bar, a bunch of TVs and some tall tables and high stools. In back there are regular sit down tables and some smaller TVs. Good burgers, mini burgers, chicken sandwich etc. If you stick to the basics I think you'll be pretty happy. Other people can tell you what's up stairs - not accessible - but between the up front and downstairs back I've always been comfortable. A young, hustling staff makes sure you're never thirsty or hungry.Wheelchair Access: Getting in is easy. Up front can be a little tight, but I can usually find a nice spot. I like the back lower level best. There's a nice ramp to get down there and there's lots of room. The bathroom is iffy. Getting in is OK, but the stall is too small for me. Better check it out for yourself before you down your 4th pint. Overall: For a sports bar, hang out with friends, watch the game place I'd give it 4 stars.

314,DOny_M6Xc_954y9-D2y9mQ,Justin E.,3.0 star rating,"One of Hoboken's most popular sports bars, its food. While their Tuesday Bucket of Wings and Beer special keeps me coming back, it's their use of alliteration that won my heart over. They have specials all week which are described by clever alliterations like Mexican Mondays, Thirsty Thursday, Fantastic Friday, and more! I am easily amused, get over it.Everyone at the Black Bear was very friendly; although, I did wish to see our waitresses beautiful smile a tad bit more.  She was very attentive and won extra points by refilling our waters without being asked to. I've been there even on a busy day, and the wait staff is pretty much on top of their game. The restaurant is a typical sports bar, with a minimum of 3 TVs always within view.  I also really enjoyed the music that they played at a moderate level, which provided great atmosphere while never interfering with your conversation. As far as the food goes, most people I know go to Black Bear for their hot wings, but I feel it is almost obligatory to order a burger at a bar and grill in order to form a real review. As such, I ordered the Chipotle BBQ Burger cooked medium rare. I thought it was delicious since it seemed the spice and zip was cooked into the meat. My guest ordered a Grilled Vegetable Wrap, which they agreed to put chicken into. The wrap was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. However, both entrees came with some pretty delicious fries. Also, on the recommendation of a friend, we ordered the Meatloaf with Mashed Potatoes. While the Meatloaf was good, it may be a bit too pricey for most at $15. To top it all off, for desert we split a Death by Chocolate, which was a rich and delicious chocolate cake. It was a good thing that we split it because if the chocolate overload didn't get you, then the diabetes would have. Definitely one of the better bar and grills in Hoboken, Black Bear is the perfect place if you want to kick back a bucket of wings and pitcher of beer with your friends, or are looking for a relaxed business-esque type lunch. The service was quick and attentive, and the food was above average for other establishments of that type. Make sure to check out their cleverly named specials to get the best bang for your buck.

You have to consider the time of day and day of the week when you plan on going though because it gets PACKED and makes it hard to enjoy your time there sometimes. We love Wednesday nights because they have free Bingo and Burger + Beer specials. The food is good but after you've been there a few times, you've tried it all. I'd recommend their chicken wings but if you like meaty chicken tenders, you won't find them here.
