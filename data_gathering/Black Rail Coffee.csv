Coffee is priced as any other local coffee shop but the price of avocado toast is robbery ($8.50!). Before I actually got here, I was hoping to order that but the price deterred me. Instead I got the Money Honey sans the honey ($6). It was pretty good and the lunch looked good as well. I would come back here if I ever wanted a more boujee flavored and priced sandwich. For drinks, I was hoping to find some more interesting types of coffee but didn't see anything that caught my eye.

I'm very confident that this will become one of my new regular coffee spots:1) Conveniently located on Jackson and 9th in Hoboken, right next to the light rail station. Easy place to run to if you commute via the light rail, or using the elevator to/from Hoboken/Jersey City. But despite its proximity to this major transit stop, I still found it to be pretty chill because it's on a quiet corner. (But to be fair, I haven't been there for morning rush hour lol)2) I got an Americano and my boyfriend got a French vanilla latte. Mine was pretty good, but my boyfriend LOVED his order which says a lot because he's much more particular about his coffee than me. We also got a raspberry kouign and almond croissant (by chocopain), which was very exciting because they're one of my favorite bakeries. They also have sandwiches, salads, breakfast, and even a kids menu in addition to pastries.3) I also appreciate their stock of healthier chip options, granola, etc. They even had bowls for you to sample the granolas they carry. I mean, who doesn't love a free sample? 4) The environment of the cafe is very nice. I like all the natural lighting, amount of seating indoors and outdoors, outlet availability, and decor. I wish the seats were a little more comfortable, but they weren't bad either.This combo of great coffee, favorite pastries, and easy access is right up my alley!

The decor is modern in a 70s kind of way, and the furniture is spaced well, not cramped.  Black Rail has the lattes and such that many coffee fans demand, as well as a modest selection of fresh pastries and made-to-order 'healthy' sandwiches.  Although the sandwiches are a tad pricey, they now include chips so that's good.Other things to mention include a selection of cold drinks including ice-brewed coffee, some outdoor seating in the shade,  and a suggestion box that I actually plan to use to be helpful.

Black Rail is the type of shop that will make you do just that. Located adjacent to the 9th street HBLR stop, Black Rail is in a perfect spot to grab coffee and breakfast before the morning commute. Since I began taking the train from this stop, Black Rail has been a regular part of my routine. The coffee is not bitter nor burnt. The lattes rival any in town (including my favorite downtown shop Bean Vault) but what sets this cafe apart is the food. The breakfast sandwiches strike a rare combination of being pre made yet really really good. The sausage, egg and cheese on a croissant makes me smile and turkey, egg and Swiss is a perfect change of pace. Last week I got the avocado toast as I woke up early and actually got there more then 5 minutes prior to my train. It was in a word...ridiculous. The multi grain bread is toasted perfectly, there is a generous amount of sliced avocado and the red pepper flakes add a kick.

For the price, I'd expect a delicious cold brew and fresh delicious croissant.

I stopped in to get a cold brew even though it was 20 degrees outside but it was so good and so worth it. I think I have fully transitioned from iced coffee to cold brews from now on, too. They have a breakfast and lunch menu, as well, but I didn't have anything to eat when I visited. They also have cookies, biscotti's and goodies to choose from, all of which looked tasty.

From day one I can sense the urgency they have in serving up the best cup of coffee or cooking up the absolute most delicious bite to eat. From the modern & clean decor, to the variety of fresh pastries presented, you cannot simply walk out without trying something from their counter. Fresh coffee both hot are cold have always been great, for sweeteners in addition to standard offerings they have sweet agave as well. For breakfast/lunch I've had the usual bagel & croissants but then I ventured into the tastiness of their sandwiches. The other day I tried ""The Healthier Sandwich"" (oven roasted turkey, ripe avocados, red onions, fresh carrots, spinach & balsamic dressing on sourdough pullman bread) and it was all tasty bites of joy. I also tried the ""Wasa Beef"" (roast beef, arugula, red onions, wasabi mayo & swiss cheese on rosemary focaccia bread) and this was a bit interesting. The kick the wasabi mayo/red onion offered was an interesting blend of spicy but tangy & almost stinging yet equally delicious when the arugula & focaccia balanced it out. Definitely a foodie must although heed my warning that wasabi mayo is indeed spicy. I'm fortunate to have my project site right adjacent to here & I'm looking forward to trying their other sandwiches as well.

When I put in my gps it out me in no mans land until I finally saw a sign for it and followed it to the cafe I had been searching for. When I finally arrived they stated they were closing early and only could make food to go which was understandable. There was one cool fellow manning the register/coffee and another making the food. Seriously awesome vibes and menu choices. From the photos I knew I had to try the avocado toast! It was a must- and I absolutely loved the it! After walking home It was finally time to taste this epic treat!! First bite- uhhhhMazing!!!!!!!!! The hint of lemon and then the spice of the red peppers really wake you up!!

My favorite is either the Turkey meets Ham or the Healthier Sandwich (cute names). They take a little under 4 minutes to prepare. They do recycle. You just need to hand it to them and ask them to recycle whatever. They don't leave out bins because they're concerned that some people will throw trash in. This has it's pros and cons.
