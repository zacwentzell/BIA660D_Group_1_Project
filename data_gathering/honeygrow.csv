I remember when they announced they were opening one in Hoboken I was so excited that they would be closer. Yesterday I decided to venture out the city to give the Hoboken location a try.  I must say it is easy to get to from the Lower Manhattan via the PATH train. And only about a 5 min walk from the Hoboken train stop.The establishment has that modern look incorporating wood as well like many other locations.  They have outdoor seating which is great for nice evenings.  They have 4 kiosk to select your food and that evening a small line was forming to order around 7ish.  I ordered my regular spicy garlic stir fry and adding in shrimp as well.  It took a little less than 10 minutes for my food to be ready.  Once I received my food it looked amazing at first sight, but then I noticed that the noodles were undercooked and clumping together.  On top of that they went very light on the sauce which made for a rather dry entree.  At this point I am tired and hungry from a long day I just ate it as is.  My meal with my bottle of water was about $16.  They didn't knock my socks off as I PRAYED they would. Will I give it another try? Probably will but I know to ask for extra sauce and to tell them about how I want my noodles.",honeygrow,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Noodles"

I've been going to HG for years and usually get salads because of the ability to customize and enjoy the stir-fry when I do order.However, HG has always struggled to get customer service right (at least at this location) and similar to other reviewers, there's usually something incorrect about the order.Tonight was the first time I got so frustrated I almost walked out. I encountered a very negative employee making salads that incorrectly put tuna on top of my salad (side note: who actually likes tuna?). When I corrected her and told her it was okay just to take it off she had an unnecessary attitude, threw the salad out, did not apologize for the already 15 minute wait and aggressively slammed together my new salad. Without speaking one word. I want to be understanding that there might be something happening in her personal life but I have learned in the service industry you must put on a poker face and be pleasant to customers and fellow employees.I will likely be returning because I do enjoy the food, but if I'm in a hurry or trying to avoid negative vibes will likely go elsewhere for lunch and dinner.",honeygrow,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Noodles"

55,KOygMqXCqAmCmktxYXyL1g,Scott H.,3.0 star rating,"Healthy, pricey, bland.I've been here 5 or 6 times to try the salads.  I like the idea - healthy, organic salads prepared as quickly as other 'fast' food.  The salads have been decent, but not great.  Here's where they can improve:-A single portion of protein (chicken or shrimp) is small, probably only 2 or 3 ounces.  If that's not enough to satisfy you, you'll have to go with a double portion, at extra cost.  -Price:  if you go double protein, expect a salad and drink to run $15 - $16.  For what you're getting, that seems high.-Flavor:  I've tried many different salads here, many different ingredients, dressings, etc., and most combinations have been bland.  So tomatoes don't have much tomato flavor, the chicken has very little chicken flavor, etc.  Even ingredients that should normally be bold and assertively flavored (blue cheese, onions, etc.) are somehow lacking.  Honeygrow is a chain, and it seems they've focus-grouped their flavors to aim for the lowest common denominator.  That is, they've made everything mild, so as not to turn off customers with more sensitive palates.  Even the dressings, which are there mainly to add flavor, are mild.  -Dressings:  Lots of choices, but too many closely-overlapping ones.  So they've got a balsamic vinaigrette.  Also a white balsamic vinaigrette.  Also a cider vinaigrette, etc.  That would be OK if each one had a distinct flavor, but they don't.  They're so mildly-flavored, it's hard to discern differences between them.  Honestly, most bottled dressings you'd buy at the store pack more flavor than these.  (Protip:  the one non-mild choice is the sriracha one.  Go for that if you like actually tasting things.) -Ingredient segregation limits choices:  Honeygrow makes two things:  salads and stir-frys.  But for some reason, ingredients that are used in the stir-frys aren't available to be added to the salads.  Green beans, jalapeños, shredded pork, etc. can go in the frys, but not the salads.  Mr. Honeygrow, tear down this wall!Honeygrow, if you're listening, this is a decent start, but you've got room to improve.  Make these changes and you'll earn . . . my coveted fourth star!  (Cue: crickets chirping . . . )",honeygrow,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Noodles"

There is no cashier there but only nice machines with nice pictures. The restaurant is also clean with open kitchen. You can see how they prepare food. The staffs there are friendly. The restaurant brands their healthy food, and almost convinced me: many vegetables there to choose, salad looks beautiful, until I realize it is not really healthy for their oily stir-fried category food.For the stir-fry style dishes, they are definitely Asian. As mentioned, they are oily, more than Asian-Asian and comparable to some American-Asian. In Asia things are fried in order: different food need different heats; in this store it looks like they mix whatever protein, vegetables, sauces, etc. and stir-fry them altogether with oil. Of course finally there are raw things and there are over-cooked things. Luckily I never see meat are undercooked, probably their standard is to fully cook the meat and let the vegetables whatever. I guess they should observe how an Asian restaurant in Asia works on this matter. The quantity is not much, either. They should at least offer more noodles or rice with very low cost or even no cost for people to choose. These things are cheap.But anyway, for stir-fries, they are actually comparable or even slightly better than most American-Asian in Hoboken regarding to flavor, probably much better regarding to raw material freshness, and light-year better regarding to branding and marketing.

The red coconut curry (aka red coco aka I'm in love with the coco) is absolutely delicious!! I've tried a few of the other stir fries but this has been my favorite sauce. I recommend adding the spiced turkey as the protein instead of the tofu (unless you're vegan/vegetarian of course). Philly roast pork stir fry is also great if you're in a pork and cheese kind of mood! Two cons:1. They serve the hot stir fries in plastic bowls if you eat in. Really?? With the whole modern take on local fusion food with wood and sustainable tables/chairs, you serve in plastic bowls? I do not eat anything hot out of plastic as a rule of thumb so this was pretty disappointing. I usually do take out for this reason.2. The topping amounts are not consistent. Sometimes I get 2 pieces of broccoli, other times I get 10. To be clear, I'd prefer 10. :) When they get stingy with the toppings, it becomes just a bowl of noodles/rice...not so fun, and the inconsistency becomes quite disappointing.",honeygrow,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Noodles"

My go-to is the sweet soy five spice stir fry, modified to replace spiced turkey with chicken and rice with egg white noodles, but when I'm feeling reckless I opt for the spicy garlic stir fry (which is pretty damn spicy but very worth it).

If Hoboken had other similar options like Terri or Hale and Hearty, Honeygrow would rank between 3 to 3.5 stars. With virtually no competition (yet), I'm going with 4. Pluses:- Food was really fresh and portions were substantial (I had plenty of leftovers)- Many options for toppings and veggies - huge score on that front - Stir fries are really good - love the unique range of sauces too - Nice, clean interiors, minimalistic and airyMinuses:- The touch screen kiosks can get a little confusing - it's tough to edit your choices or get rid of something you've added by mistake to your cart- Long wait times for your order- Would like better options to customize the sauces at the kiosk (mild, medium, spicy or add extra sauce)What we got:- Stir fry with whole wheat noodles, coconut red curry sauce, tofu, carrots, snap peas and coriander. Over all the combination really worked, though found the sauce to be on the blander side - lacked the flavor of coconut and a little kick would add to the authentic Thai/Asian concoction.- Husband got the egg white noodles in lemon miso sauce - he only wanted beef, but somehow we didn't notice, but the default option on the kiosk is chicken; so he ended up getting both and being charged extra!!

There was a time when I used to come here 2-3 times a week, but now that I am exploring more in Hoboken, I've brought this number down to once every other week or so. Still, when I'm craving custom salads or stir-fry, there is no better place than Honeygrow to satisfy my palate. I ALWAYS get the same thing here. Custom stir-fry with chicken, egg white noodles, peppers, bean sprouts, chili flakes and sesame seeds, with sesame garlic sauce (less sauce). I don't know why but I loved this combo so much that I never bothered to try anything else. I've heard EVERYTHING here is good though, so you really can't go wrong.The key to this place is arriving BEFORE lunch time. When there's no line, you'll be in and out within 10-15 minutes, but if you wait until peak lunch time, there's no telling how long it will take.

However, a recent experience has left such a poor taste in my mouth that I doubt I will ever be back. My wife and I went for lunch on Halloween. We both usually order the Cobb salad with one substitution - we opt for mozzarella instead of feta since we both strongly dislike the taste of feta cheese.When we got our salads that day, I was disappointed to see that the requested substitution had not been made. I went to speak to the manager who referred me to the people making the salads without even listening to me. As the salads were being remade, I was very rudely asked if I was sure what type of cheese I wanted this time. This remark was not said to be helpful, rather her tone and demeanor made it clear that it was meant to be snide. I still wasn't too bothered at this point but what happened next was unacceptable IMO.As we were sitting down to eat the manager came by. I figured she came to ask if the order was ok. Instead, she insinuated how rude I had been by making a remark about how I didn't even say thank you for having the salads remade. She went on about how they had thrown out two completely good salads due to MY mistake. Apparently the person making the salad had lied and said the substitution request was not on my order.When I informed her otherwise she left and brought back the receipt which clearly stated mozzarella. She then back pedaled and tried telling me that both feta and mozzarella were on the order which I don't believe. If that had been the case, the original order would have had both feta and mozzarella instead of just feta. Even if I had made the mistake it wouldn't ever justify trying to chastise a customer for not saying thank you and calling them rude, especially in this instance since I was just reacting to how I was being treated by the staff. Besides, had the mistake actually been on my end, I would have just eaten what I ordered but that was not the case.From now on, I will be getting my salads from Quality Greens.",honeygrow,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Noodles"

I've been there twice already and don't have any complaints. Both time I've ordered the custom stir fry. The first time I got rice noodles with shrimp, broccoli, parsley, cilantro, and spicy garlic sauce. The spicy garlic sauce is delicious, but truly spicy. They also have gluten free soy sauce which is a bonus. The downside to my delicious meal was that there were only 3 shrimps in the whole $12 bowl.  After that, I learned my lesson and got vegetables only for around $10. I got the same thing and thoroughly enjoyed it. Ordering is simple and efficient as you select your food on a touch screen desktop and pay with credit there or take your receipt then go to the cashier and pay with cash which is also where you pick up your food. When I was waiting for my order, I heard a man tell the cashier he had an allergy and the cashier immediately notified all the staff. If you're gluten free, have allergies or have any diet restrictions, they're extremely accommodating and everything is labeled.Honeygrow provides a large portion and has a nice atmosphere. It's great for friends or for a laid back date. Their sodas are all natural and the two times I had them, they weren't bad.

And have everything down packed . Every time i walk in the cooks and the additional employees are horsing around, and the employees in the back I'm guessing in the break room you can hear them yelling . The managers are horsing around with them as well and you can't even tell who's the manager . Now my question is why is it that there's only 1-2 people per station especially when it's BUSY. The other employees are in the back just hanging out . There's a good I would say 10-20 people still waiting for their foods all the time this happens. The people who run the food have forgotten to hand me the drinks that I have payed for and have the audacity to give attitude and slam the drinks on the counter instead of handing it to you.

It was basically a carton of dry, flavorless noodles with a few tofu and pineapple chunks thrown in. My boyfriend tried the Philly Roast Pork - another disappointment, loaded with an absurd amount of pepper and very little flavor otherwise. And this is coming from someone who loves spicy food.

And all self serve digital ordering. Cool! I've waited to write my review on this place because it was just so new... And I'm glad I waited. First time I went I tried the stir fry-- lemon miso. It was... Creamy and the noodles were prefect texture. But something in my dish tasted like.... Dirt or like mushroom fungus. Idk what it was but there was something in it that definitely did not taste fresh. My coworker tried the sesame stir fry and he said it was salty and mediocre. Second time I tried a honey bar. Fucking amazing. Jesus it's so good. The granola?!?! The maple yogurt?!?! To die for. Serious the best granola I've tried. The fruit can be a little better condition but overall the honey and the granola and yogurt really do it for me. Wish they had BIGGER sizes!! Hope the owners read this. Cause I would Definitely get the biggest size they offer.Third time I tried a salad-- made my own and it was AMAZING. It was just too small.. BUTTT they are definitely falling off with their ""assembly line"" quality. I had a vegetarian salad--just tofu no meat. And I had a SHRIMP IN MY SALAD?! Obviously doesn't belong there. And I also ordered my favorite thing on the menu the honey bar.. And in my honey bar I had two prices of spinach ?! Ummmmmmm why is that there....... Two words. Quality control.

I love the concept of local and fresh ingredients of course, and how they are very transparent with everything that goes into the food. There's barely any human contact here. You order from an iPad which is easy to use. You're given a number on a receipt and they call you by number. You can watch to see how the food is made if you're into that. I like how I'm usually talking to an employee when my food is being prepared, so this is something new. The stir fry seems to be the more popular option here and everyone seems to like it. I'm not really a stir fry person so I went with the salad. They have their signature salads that you can order from and salads that you can choose what ingredients you want (this is cheaper). My salad came out to around $10 keeping ingredients to a minimum. I wasn't really impressed with the salad, I felt like the portion was small and the add ins were kinda skimpy, and the salad was not mixed well. So I suggest you stick with the stir-fry, which seems to be more their forte. The interior is really nice with tons of seating indoors and outdoors. The staff is very friendly and walks around to clean tables from plates & garbage when you're done eating. Overall, a nice addition to Hoboken.",honeygrow,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Noodles"
101,b0x4HrjoB6Mo47G5bJN0rw,Irina D.,4.0 star rating,"I consider myself to be a pretty healthy eater. At the same time I also happen to live in Hoboken, a land where Italian and American cuisines rule. It might be surprising to some, but those two do not tend to offer many healthy dishes so I would often dream of a local establishment that could offer something else. While there are a few businesses, most of whom have closed by now, who promised a healthier option they were either tasteless or had awful customer service.When I saw that this location was under construction, it happened to mention the name of the place and when I looked it up I was very excited to find out that Hoboken was finally going to have a healthy food option that also seemed appetizing. I kept checking on the progress of the construction and was there within the first week of them opening.The service: when they first opened, people greeted you by the door and gave you the menu while you were waiting in line (and there was quite a line). Everyone working there was very friendly and was obviously trained well. While the greetings have subsided, I still find them to be very nice and do get the occasional greeting from time to time. Since you use a computer to place your order, the communication is somewhat limited as is. the food itself: I was very hesitant when I tried my first dish from them as I had such high hopes and was all too used to the disappointment. However, it was excellent! It was hard to believe that what I was eating was actually (well, mostly) healthy. Full of flavor and the serving size is enough for me to split into two meals. I also like how one can customize it, I usually get either the spicy garlic or the sweet soy spice five stir fries and substitute the meat for tofu.the price: Very reasonable considering what you are getting.The only reason this place doesn't get five stars is because the tofu has been inconsistent and overcooked on a few occasions. Also, do expect a reasonable wait for stir fries. Otherwise, I really do love it and hope it stays for a while",honeygrow,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Noodles"

HG has positioned itself in the perfect spot in the trendy ""organic / free range / vegan "" niche market. Better yet, its not just not banking on the trend, its providing great quality food, large portion sizes (I couldn't even finish half of my stir fry) for a super affordable prices.I stopped by for a quick lunch, and had a wonderful experience. The staff welcomed me, gave me helpful recommendations as to what to try (100% recommend the red coconut curry!!), and served me quickly. Even when waiting for my food it was an enjoyable experience because automatically, visually, it meets expectations. Very new, very minimalist, and very conscientious of the image it should hope to portray. Even the kiosk was appealing: everything is touchscreen, high tech, beautiful videos of Hoboken...and better yet, super easy to use. After finishing my meal and transferring it into a container to go, I ordered an extra stir fry for my boyfriend, two items from the honey bar (their fruit, honey desserts). Very great packaging for the stir fry: adorable chinese take out boxes. Why not five stars? I feel like HG has the potential to do so much more. My roommate is a vegan and what makes HG great and unique is that its definitely the only one of its kind in Hoboken: a cheap, tasty filling meal that tends to a broad range of dietary needs (health conscientious, vegan, vegetarian and gluten free--but don't worry, great tasty, meat options too!) What I would like to see would be greater portions of vegetables in the stir fry, have it served warmer (sadly, my rice noodles were a little cold), a colder drink (the kale smoothie was disappointingly lukewarm), and most definitely more options for smoothies. There are tons of options of vegetables smoothies which would be great because tons of times there are only juiced drinks or only fruit smoothies. Also, with the honey bar, as nit picky as this may sound, I would like to have contents mixed so that everything is equally coated in honey/coconut what have you, and I can enjoy all of the fruit at once.

For whatever reason, his seemed to be slightly more tasty.  Mine was almost missing some salt (adding some would definitely elevate the taste and I'm not a salt heavy eater either...).  Again, the entire dish was somewhat bland even with a spicy garlic sauce.Other areas to improve, the jalapenos were cut into huge round chunks - I love spicy food and I wouldn't even eat a jalapeno like that.  I would recommend trying the sauces before you get it just to make sure you want to commit.  One of the servers was helpful and let me try the red curry sauce which was too sweet for my taste.   Definitely try the sodas though - they are great!I probably won't be rushing to go back soon but probably will give it one more try in the future.",honeygrow,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Noodles"

The selection of pre-designed stir frys and salads are awesome plus you can create your own which is always a huge plus. The interface is user-friendly and pretty descriptive. While waiting for my food, I walked around the two dining areas and checked out the prep stations - everything was clean and easily identifiable. For my first round, I made my own stir fry with whole wheat noodles, broccoli, mushrooms, onions and shrimp with the sesame garlic sauce. I must say, I was thoroughly impressed. Love the Chinese take-out boxes too! They did not skimp out on the protein or veggies so there was a good balance of noodles and other toppings. Very filling and drum roll please... affordable! With a bottled water, my meal came out to $13 which I feel like is hard to find at an organic/local eatery around NYC.

132,kw_unRenFD-ModrsLLL2_g,Victoria C.,4.0 star rating,"This place is pretty unique in Hoboken - you order at a kiosk sort of like what you'd find at Wawa, and you get to choose from a bunch of options for stirfry (and some other items). The food is great - very tasty and flavorful and moderately healthy. For build-your-own, you can get noodles, rice, or lettuce as a base, and then you build off of that with different ingredients and sauces. Otherwise, you can get one of the pre-set stirfry options, which I've opted for and are delicious. I've enjoyed every different sauce I've tried here, so don't be afraid to experiment! I also usually get the lettuce cups for a healthier option, rather than noodles or rice. It's still super tasty, so don't be afraid to try it out as well. The lettuce cup comes in a separate little container.Overall, I really enjoy the food here, although I do think it's slightly pricy for the amount of food you're getting. But it does fill you up just the right amount, and the ingredients are fresh and prepped and cooked well. The food is a little bit reminiscent of Chinese or Asian stirfry, so if you're into that, and you're looking for healthier or more customizable options, this is the place for you!Service is also good - you'd think that you don't interact with the staff much because all of your ordering is through the kiosk. But there's a staff member by the kiosks to help guide newcomers through the ordering process and to assist with any questions. I mean, the ordering process is pretty straightforward, but I like that they're friendly and there to greet you and help you if needed.",honeygrow,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Noodles"

145,oua3hFOMkCxc7WjG43dLVA,Charles B.,3.0 star rating,"I have been here twice now - once for a stir-fry and once for a ""honeybar"" yogurt bowl. The first time I came in to order my yogurt bowl, they omitted the crushed candied cashews. This was even after double-checking (as I saw one or two messed up orders before mine). The cashier blatantly lied to me and said that ""the cashews were at the bottom of the bowl"". I remained skeptical, but was in a rush so trusted her word. Nope, not there. *Wave*The second order I placed here was for the sesame garlic stir-fry with egg white noodles, naturally raised beef, sugar snap peas, bell peppers, red onions, carrots, scallions, and I added fried shallots and cilantro (.45 cents extra for cilantro - come on). Generous portion, fresh ingredients, but the beef was not very flavorful. Overall, I was much more satisfied with the stir-fry than the yogurt bowl. I'm all for fresh and natural ingredients, but still, $15 for a stir-fry is a bit steep, especially since there wasn't enough meat in my order. I really do like the concept of Honeygrow and the kiosk system, but every time I come in here I find that there's about 15 people waiting in front of me, regardless of the time of day. It seems like the orders get backed up with the kiosk system and Honeygrow rarely has the manpower to keep up. The waiting area itself isn't exactly spacious, either. Pluses: Fresh, natural ingredients + variety in healthy menu options Minuses: long wait times + very expensive prices I'm willing to give Honeygrow another try, as I know they are a fairly new business to the Hoboken area.

I was nervous it wouldn't be big/filling enough for dinner or they wouldn't put enough chicken in- however, they put the perfect amount of each item in! I liked how the salad was basically mixed already so I didn't have to do much cutting up myself before eating. Not only was the salad great, but as my friend & I were eating, an employee came by to ask us how our meal was and if we needed anything. Around 10 minutes later, he again walked by and collected my tray since I was finished (it was nice not to have to throw it out myself!).

The customization is awesome and I dig being able to order on a computer like you would at Wawa. My only complaint is the beef and chicken taste extremely processed. Like it was frozen for a year or something with tons of sodium. I'd be fives stars all day if they went with a higher quality meat.,honeygrow,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Noodles"

I thought I would hate not interacting with the staff, but ordering on these shiny screens only made me add more and spend more. The food was delish - I had the lemon miso tahini and piled on the noodles, veggies, chicken, etc. etc. and ended up with a $14+ stir fry bowl. Worth every penny. The place was clean, the staff were nice, and the music was pleasant. Now can you just open one up in JC please?!",honeygrow,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Noodles"

I like to know where they buy their vegetables because it looked like they were your typical precut frozen vegetables you buy in the freezer section. Tasted like cardboard ...

Aside from the food, which taste fresh, healthy, and delicious, the hospitality is unbelievably warm, especially for a ""chain"" restaurant. Darnell runs the kitchen with amazing efficiency, and I'm always impressed by his positive energy. In addition, Shantel has an incredible attitude- she always greets us with a huge smile, and it's a major reason we keep coming back. Thanks so much to Shantel, Darnell, and the rest of the team.

Most of these were add-on items that I paid for, too. It wasn't even all that crowded when we went, so I can't chalk it up to the staff being extremely busy (and that's not even a sufficient reason in my mind). The items are on the order slip, all they have to do is go down the list. Very disappointing that they can't get the orders right when it's all spelled out for them. The food is actually pretty good but it's expensive, you have to wait for a long time in a very overheated and cramped space, and the place is ridiculously loud.

190,tl2xwzkyb-EtRgqPk7R6lA,Xiaoli P.,4.0 star rating,"I enjoy this place and mostly get salads, I'm a big fan of how the salad is thoroughly mixed so that dressing is generously and evenly dispersed throughout the greens- no dry leaves at the bottom! They are also generous with the chicken and toppings, however as far as comparable salad/prices go at similar places, this is on the pricy side. I ordered one of their readymade salads and it came out to $11 and it was regular sized, whereas I usually eat at just salad and their salads are around $9 and they are HUGE. Originally I had tried to make my own salad with no add one but it came out to be more expensive than the readymade salads.

I would give this place 5 stars but, they almost always mess up my order. I usually order to go and bring it home and its extremely frustrating to get home and discover that the chicken, avocado or falafel is missing from my salad. One time I brought it back to have it fixed, another time I called but only received an apology, a third time I just sucked it up and ate the salad without the falafel.  I suggest ordering and eating there!

I recommend ordering light dressing or dressing on the side because they tend to add way too much.  I like the lemon miso stir fry and the vegan kale salad (dressing is so good), but was really disappointed by the kaleatta that is a little slimy.  Ordering is easy, but during busy times you'll have to wait a while for your food.",honeygrow,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Noodles"

Completely customizing my order was great and liked all the options they offered. We tried the Chicken Cobb Salad and Sesame Garlic Beef Stir Fry. We took it to go and when we got home, realized that both of our meals were lacking protein. I called Honeygrow to let them know and they said the next time we come in, to remind them to add the protein. I'm sorry, but when each and every ingredient is listed on the receipt, I expect it to be placed in my food. Both the salad and stir fry were a little bland, but we would be willing to give this place another shot. Just make sure everything is included before you leave with your order!",honeygrow,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Noodles"

I came here yesterday to pick up a salad and honey bar. With the salad, the person making it couldn't find the correct salad dressing. After taking a few minutes to rummage around she took a to go salad dressing container and dumped it on my salad. It was not the right dressing. If they did not have the proper salad dressing they could have let me know so I could choose a new one instead of them dumping a random dressing on it to complete the order. Unfortunately by the time I realized it was not the correct dressing, I was already back home. In addition, with the honey bar, they must of mixed my order up with someone else's. I paid extra to have yogurt and extra fruit/toppings and the honey bar I received was nowhere close to what I ordered. Honeygrow needs to properly train their employees because every time I give Honeygrow another chance they mess up time and time again.
