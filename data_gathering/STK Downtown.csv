0,5aZX8bTiD0k9vR60SG588Q,Alison C.,4.0 star rating,"I had been to STK Meatpacking for drinks in the past - both at the sprawling indoor lounge and on the packed rooftop.  There was also that one time when I had had a terrific steak dinner there, but had totally forgotten to write a review of the food...oops!  Well, I happened to make it there for dinner again last night, so I can now fulfill my duty as a loyal Yelper!  When I arrived at the restaurant just after 7 pm on that Monday evening, the place was pretty dead.  My brother was waiting for me at one of the tables, and there were a few other tables and bar seats taken, but not many.  Between the bleak look inside and the sorry state of the Meatpacking District and its diminishing culinary options, I was not sure that the meal would live up to the glory of my previous visit.  When it was time to order beverages, our waitress kept pushing us towards the much more expensive red wines by the glass, despite our inquiries on the more affordable options.  It was a bit frustrating, and, in the end, we wound up going with our initial choice - the Decoy by Duckhorn Cabernet Sauvignon, a solid brand with a woodsy, yet fruity flavor at a reasonable $16 a glass.  For the food, we kept it simple, each ordering a small, 6 ounce Filet Mignon and sharing the Shaved Brussels Sprout Salad as our side dish.  The salad was phenomenal!  Besides the sheared sprout leaves, the dish included feta cheese, pickled red onion, marcona almonds, and dried cranberries, all tossed in a red wine vinaigrette.  It really encompassed a spectrum of flavors (sweet, nutty, acidic, creamy) and textures (crunchy, chewy, etc.).  Plus, the portion was extremely large, making it a good option as a singular, shared side dish, alongside smaller pieces of meat.  We had ordered our steaks to be cooked medium, but they were both slightly more towards medium-well.  However, the meat possessed that salty, peppery crust that one hopes for on their steak.  It was simply delicious.  Though we did not order specific sauces, we actually used the pesto that accompanied the complimentary, doughy skillet rolls as our sauce.  This added an herbaceous and garlicky kick that was simply addicting.  As our meal came to an end, we looked around and noticed that the restaurant had become much more crowded.  Apparently these other diners knew that STK was still a star in the now quieter Meatpacking District.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

2,ROWpK1tS0unPK-uKkZLsGQ,David R.,5.0 star rating,"I've been here several times and always a great time. Last night was particularly great so finally adding a review.1. Service - Waitress(kim I think) was supper attentive and provides a perfect wine recommendation, Executice Chef came out to make sure we enjoyed our meal which is always a plus, and finally manager brought us 2 glasses of champagne to end our celebratory meal - A+2. Food - we shared the porterhouse and it was great. STK has great food. It is a top quality restaurant. Forget the negative reviews, this is a fun and trendy steakhouse with great quality food. Notnthe ""best"" but definitely a top 5 in nyc. You get your money's worth for sure. Jalapeño grits are money and the truffle, think cut fries are perfect additions to your meat. 3. Price - listen this is a steakhouse, you are going to drop $200-$300 for two at any good steakhouse and STK is no different. Even anything it's slightly less expensive than some old school steakhouses in NYC. Overall, perfect date place, fun group dining and makes for a trendy night out if that's your thing.

Drinks We tried the Rose Sangria .. very nice good tasting drink we stuck to this for the night. Tables apparently are for eating only which kinda sucks since if u are drinking I don't see the problem? But I get it food & liquor bill will of course bring more $$.

The tator tots are not tater tots but fried mashed potatoes. Not my favorite.The cream corn pudding side dish was amazing! Order it. I could have the name wrong but it is awesome.This is a hefty priced meal but i thought it was delicious. We were going to sit on the rooftop but thought it was much nicer inside.

There are 17 of us in total so we were subject to ordering from a prefixed menu. The printed menu was customized for the special occasion, and my friends were allowed to decorate the room however they wanted. The waitstaff was efficient with delivering both food and drinks, and we were also allowed to put on our own playlists. The food was absolutely delicious. I had the chicken but most ordered the steak STK is known for. I only heard rave reviews from my friends.At some point the girls got pretty rowdy but since the space was ours we had complete autonomy. As far as price charged, unfortunately I don't know the final price for the private room, but if you have a large enough group I would assume that it is fairly affordable divided by the number of heads.Final note: the warm cookie ball served with ice cream was to die for.

Of course the prices aren't those of a quick casual restaurant, but this isn't a quick casual restaurant. I chose to have a steak (of course) ribeye, it was delicious! One of my friends had a chicken dish and another lamb, I believe the remainder of the table had steaks. I remember the sides standing out the most, the corn pudding was to die for! I went home thinking of a way to recreate (unfortunately I haven't had one as good since) the lobster mac was good, but there was very little lobster and although the waiter said the portion size was enough to split between four people I highly doubt it would have satisfied one person as an entree.Nonetheless, if given the opportunity to experience a meal at STK please go; you won't be disappointed.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

Tables apparently are for eating only which kinda sucks since if u are drinking I don't see the problem? But I get it food & liquor bill will of course bring more $$. We manage to find our selves a table to stand by which was fine since it's all we needed. This place is not bad good music, nice vibe glad it wasn't very crowded since the place is not big at all decent city views.

34,QxTNaHoxTL8f7jAK5nwQ1g,Nicholas G.,4.0 star rating,Really enjoyed my meal here. I thought the filet mignon was perfectly cooked and the sirloin had a good mix of fat and meat. It was tender and delicious.I am not the biggest fan of caesar salads where the lettuce is not cut like this one but overall flavor is good. I like chopped salads better. The tator tots are not tater tots but fried mashed potatoes. Not my favorite.The cream corn pudding side dish was amazing! Order it. I could have the name wrong but it is awesome.This is a hefty priced meal but i thought it was delicious. We were going to sit on the rooftop but thought it was much nicer inside.

35,qUPPNWKwgBqPNW63j-Ex3Q,Sharon L.,5.0 star rating,"My Maid of Honor rented out a private room for my bachelorette party during June. There are 17 of us in total so we were subject to ordering from a prefixed menu. The printed menu was customized for the special occasion, and my friends were allowed to decorate the room however they wanted. The waitstaff was efficient with delivering both food and drinks, and we were also allowed to put on our own playlists. The food was absolutely delicious. I had the chicken but most ordered the steak STK is known for. I only heard rave reviews from my friends.At some point the girls got pretty rowdy but since the space was ours we had complete autonomy. As far as price charged, unfortunately I don't know the final price for the private room, but if you have a large enough group I would assume that it is fairly affordable divided by the number of heads.Final note: the warm cookie ball served with ice cream was to die for. I probably had four in total night. It's a miracle I fit into the wedding dress just a few weeks later!",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

Of course the prices aren't those of a quick casual restaurant, but this isn't a quick casual restaurant. I chose to have a steak (of course) ribeye, it was delicious! One of my friends had a chicken dish and another lamb, I believe the remainder of the table had steaks. I remember the sides standing out the most, the corn pudding was to die for! I went home thinking of a way to recreate (unfortunately I haven't had one as good since) the lobster mac was good, but there was very little lobster and although the waiter said the portion size was enough to split between four people I highly doubt it would have satisfied one person as an entree.Nonetheless, if given the opportunity to experience a meal at STK please go; you won't be disappointed.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

41,GtMYANPoCz0o8xb0x56HJA,Nana B.,1.0 star rating,"OK let me preface this review by saying that I did not even get a chance to eat here, which is the entire point of my rating.So I had a 9:30pm reservation. Knowing that I was running late and wanting to be courteous, I called this establishment 6 times, from 8pm to 9:10pm, a whole hour and a half ahead of my reservation time. No one picked up not even once and what infuriated me even more was that the automated message kept telling me that my wait time was 1 minute, then 5 minutes later it would tell me it was less than 1 minute, then 5 minutes after that it would just hang up on me. This happened about 5 times, and on the 6th time I tried to go to the reservation desk to let them know and that just took me straight to voicemail. For an establishment to not have anyone man their phones for over an hour is completely laughable for a place like New York City, and I will expound on the reason why (other than lose listed above) later.So I proceed to change the reservation online to 11:30pm, since no one picked up and I did not want us to end up there and have to wait, even though I knew we would arrive well ahead of the time. So  we get there early, around 11:00pm, after wasting a lot of time just to meet the reservation time. We entered the restaurant around 11:20pm. I told the person at the front desk my name, and because the music was extremely loud, after 4 times of trying, I had to go to the CRM system and point out my name myself. He tells us to wait for our time, so we wait patiently, and he disappears. A lady is behind the counter, so I ask her about our reservation, as we had been there for 15 minutes now, and she says our table is still not ready, that they are just waiting for people to get up and then we shall be seated. I calmly step away again and wait and she also disappears. 20 minutes after waiting, there's now someone new at the counter and I ask her and she tells me that there are about 4 groups waiting to be seated before us, so they are trying but we will let me know. After waiting another 10 minutes, we just told them we were leaving and they should just ignore our reservation completely. She had the nerve to tell us to come back. The worst part brings me back to the phone call situation, because when we arrived I had meant to ask about the phone issue or speak to a manager, but the place was so loud that it made that impossible. Not that the noise bothered me but one of the staff told me that the place gets that loud on weekend nights, which is fine but when I was calling it was 8pm, it was not their club hours yet and I noticed 4 phones hanging on the wall, yet no one answered any of them. What is the point of the phones then? And if their club hours started earlier (which I doubt), as an establishment would you not find it a bit prudent to have your phones somewhere a person can respond to in case of an emergency? And to top it all of, what is the point of a reservation then if you will go there and still have to wait 40 minutes? To make matters even painfully worse, we ventured to Chelsea, and because we had not eaten all day, ended up at another high end establishment which was also pretty packed at 12:30am in the morning, but was able to accommodate us immediately, even without a reservation, which goes to show the difference in how one restaurant is run versus the other. Anyway I've exerted enough energy and frustration because they won't see me again for me to go through this again, and I'll make sure to let everyone know.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

I'm usually a pretty mellow guy who discounts reviews that speak to a venue's service, but STK's staff were aggressive and disrespectful toward multiple paying customers. Details below.My friends and I purchased NYE open bar tickets for post-12:30AM entry two weeks ahead of time. On the day of New Year's Eve, the ticket sales were still available. After celebrating the ball drop and heading to STK immediately after, we were greeted by STK's four doorpeople, who yelled at us to ""go home"" and ""get a refund"" because they had oversold the venue. They took no responsibility and when we asked to speak with the manager even threatened us saying they'd call ""30 security guards"" to forcibly remove us.No reasonable explanation, no respect, no compensation, no responsibility. And furthermore, they yelled at us like we did something wrong. I've never been treated so poorly as a customer in my life.I've read the 25% of reviews for STK that are filtered out and highly recommend you do too before visiting this venue, even for dinner.

43,_ieiHbadEfwVFCE3aTmZZw,Joe A.,5.0 star rating,"STK is a trendy modern American steak house with a touch of music, cocktails and great steaks. This is one of those places we never had a bad meal the service, the scene and the drinks are always great. The staff is always friendly and attentive they always try to accommodate everyone with the most upmost hospitality they can show. The meats are the highest quality that can be found A5 Wagyu, heavy marbled. Our favorites are the tomahawk,bone in ribeye and filet mignon and their lamb chops are some of the cuts that are superb. We really like their version of small wagyu burgers mac and cheese and jalapeno grits with truffle fries as well. They also have amazing desserts for a steak house their ice cream cones and warm cookie is to die for. On weekends the music is blasting and the scene is very live. If you'd like you can grab some drinks on their rooftop ""lodge"" on the STK rooftop before you get sat, however on busy nights they do require reservations for the rooftop. When compared to similar steakhouses in the city the prices are up to par and not anymore nor less so make sure to bring your wallet. The parking is not too much of a problem,street parking is available.

I ordered the short rib with the jalapeño grits and found both the meat and the grits lacking in flavor. It almost felt as if the chefs at the restaurant were scared to offend some of the clientele's taste buds. I admit the short rib was pretty tender, but for the price, I expect my meat to be seasoned and delicious which it was not. I enjoyed the complimentary bread and butter a bit more than I enjoyed my entree which is inherently problematic. Additionally, even though the table did not request any dessert the table received a dessert that was added to the bill at the end of the night which I thought was dishonest to say the least. This does not even include the fact that even though we had a reservation, our party of 3 was not seated until 45 minutes later.

I went with my coworkers for our holiday Christmas party and the seating was way too tight for a party of 8. We were literally on top of each other like packed sardines. Food: I ordered the short rib ravioli which came in about 30 minutes late and it was also served cold which made the pasta taste uncooked. Also, I didn't have utensils so after we asked the waiter for  utensils it took him 15 minutes to bring one. Ugh!!!Our waiter told us the specials of the night which was: Sirloin steak $30 an ounce. We were all shocked. $30 dollars for an ounce of steak!!!!! What is it made out of gold??? Ughhhh at this point I just wanted to go home. Drinks: The drinks were good no complaints but the waiting game was getting annoying already. Let's not forget it's $16-35 a small drink. Service: it takes the waiters at least 30 mins to an hour to bring you a glass of water or even drinks. No, I wouldn't recommend coming here. Oh I almost forgot to mention, there is a foul moldy cheese smell too that is very unpleasant. So yeah, too pricey, bad food, horrible service, horrible seating for a group of ppl.

We all got the same drink (some kind of sangria cocktail- but I forget the name). Though the drink took awhile to arrive at our table, our waiter did tell us that it would take awhile. The cocktail tasted rather refreshing. The rooftop view is quite lovely and overall the bar definitely had a fun ambience. My friend ordered sirloin steak and my other friend tried their signature dry steak burger- both were generous portions. Both of them enjoyed their dishes. I only ordered sweet corn pudding since I was full from a whole day of eating other kinds of food, but it was still delicious! Dishes are on the $13-30+ range.Slow service though, as it is busy as expected for a Friday night. It took a long time to flag down a waiter for extra ketchup.

If you've been to STK midtown and thought that it brings 'trendy' to steakhouses, the downtown branch surely kicks it up a few (or several!) notches.The decor is modern, cool and classy at the same time. There are little fireplaces all around and the inside is spacious in ways I'm not used to seeing in Manhattan restaurants. The music is clubby and thumping, definitely keeping in tune with its meatpacking location.All this would be okay if the food were 'just fine', but we were wonderfully surprised as we ate and found that the meal was as perfect as the decor! We did the restaurant week menu and here's what we got:Bread with chimichurri sauce (complimentary for the table): This was some delicious steakhouse bread: warm, soft and covered in butter and served with a yummy green chimichurri dipping sauceBraised short rib and onion wontons: These were hearty and delicious with a nice crispy exterior.Big Eye Tuna tartare: The tuna was well seasoned and covered with avocado and came with a yuca chip. Yummy but I wish there was more tuna in the dish.Steak Frites: This was delicious beyond all expectations. We got it done medium and it was perfectly cooked, well seasoned and extremely flavorful. Fries that came with it were yummy as well.Chocolate chip cookie: This was more like a crumbly muffin and was delicious!Apple Crumb Cake: This was fruity, light and delicious with a nice apple flavor that was not overpowered by cinnamon or other spices.The drinks were spot on as well. We got the ""Perfect Martini"" and the ""Not your Daddy's Manhattan"", both of which were well made, balanced and strong! Our server was friendly and attentive, and the seating process was smooth and timely.This is an awesome restaurant and the fact that they hit it out of the park with their restaurant week makes me want to come back here again!

74,4DEmodN3aLnUhL2L0bHUvQ,Patrick B.,1.0 star rating,"Terrible experience. Both in food and in service. Details below.Service rating for that night: 1/10Food rating: 3/10Overall I give one star because I can't give zero. I strictly rate based on food and service, separated from each other. Ambience or price is not an ingredient of this rating, although STK downtown would be considered a place to go mostly for its ambience. A brief word of caution: The place has a terrible ""old carpet"" smell to it, experienced by different guests over multiple visits.Here's some detail:I went here with a group of 5, on a random Tuesday evening, with a reservation for 7:30 pm.Upon arrival, a few groups were of similar size were waiting to be seated, apparently they also had reservations. Overall it took about 10 minutes of standing in the doorway until we were seated - A little too much for someone with a reservation, but given the group size no reason for me to discredit the restaurant.Service:- After being seated, water was brought immediately and a few beers were ordered. 5 minutes after the order, the waitress came back to let us know they are sold out on the beer. We ordered a different set.- 10 minutes later we got our beers and ordered the first bottle of wine to go with the food. Although we asked to order starters immediately, the waitress insisted on putting in the wine bottle order first.- 5 minutes later waitress comes back to take the orders. We ordered starters and mains together.- 15 min. later the starters arrive, brought to us by the support staff. Our waitress hasn't shown herself meanwhile and our water glasses remained empty. Bread was delivered by the support staff after asking for it, other tables got it proactively.- 45min. later: Another bottle of wine was ordered with the Sommelier and our water glasses were finally replenished, also by the Sommelier, because no one else took care of it. Because our waitress hasn't shown up a single time meanwhile, the Sommelier also offered to ask in the kitchen why our main courses are not ready yet.- Another 15min. later (almost 70min. after ordering) I take to go search for the waitress that so far we haven't seen since we were seated. I find her and without me saying anything she approaches me, starts caressing my shoulder and says ""I know. I'm sorry. I'm going to talk to the chef. Your  main courses will be ready soon."" I go back to the table without comment.- 20 min. later our main courses arrive. A staggering 80 minutes since order and 65 minutes after starters. Our water glasses are empty again. No one refills them.- A person shows up at our table, it appears to be a restaurant management related role, and says she is sorry for the experience and offers us another bottle of wine on the house and the desserts for free. Meanwhile, our waitress hasn't shown up once.- After we are done with our dinner (and the free stuff) our waitress magically reappears with the 1100 USD bill.Food:This one will be quick.- Starters: Tuna Tartare, Steak Tartare, Oysters, Shortrib Ravioli, Wagyu Carpaccio.No surprises here, everything tasted as expected but certainly didn't knock us off our chairs. The wagyu carpaccio was disappointing. The slices were way too thick, no garnish or marination on the plate. I appreciate the amount of wagyu they're giving you, but they could slice it out in a proper carpaccio way, as the thickness does influence the taste. Overall I have to say with the exception of the powerful truffle and shortrib flavors in the ravioli, the starters were just plain boring. Who's going to a steakhouse for starters anyway?- Steaks (all ordered Medium to Medium-rare): Dry-Aged Tomahawk (32oz), Dry-Aged Porterhouse (28oz), Dry-Aged Delmonico (14oz), Steak-of-the-day: Dry-Aged top cap of the rib-eye (8oz).Disappointing. They were all on the rare side (after 80 minutes of waiting for them kind of surprising) and unfortunately cold in the center and only slightly warm on the outside. No juices flowing, even more surprising given they are rare. I expect a steak to be crispy-grilled and hot on the outside and with a good temperature on the inside, aside from it being juicy and flavorful especially because of the dry-aging process. None of these expectations were met. But who goes to STK for a good steak anyway? If you want a great steak, there are a series of places in Manhattan which STK will probably never match in quality & service.What went wrong on this Tuesday night in December? It certainly must have been a series of issues because it is hard to believe that the lack of kitchen performance justifies a lack of service performance. Unfortunately even the bare minimum of restaurant service that you would expect was not provided on this evening. My recommendation to the ""The ONE Group"" (owner of the STK chain, among others): Take the prime real estate and architecture you have here and open it as a new place with new staff and management, new flavors, new energy and basically new everything.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

It's not often that I get a chance to experience restaurant week and fortunately, one of my bffs was able to get us a reservation at the last minute. My journey to STK Downtown was a bit much last night, in fact, it was the dinner that almost never happened. The MTA, more specifically the C line was doing trick and shows. The C train couldn't move beyond my stop and due to signal problem. Fortunately, they rolled the train back which allowed us to get off. I had to take a cab all the way from Brooklyn and I'm glad I did.The moment I arrived, the place was hoping and immediately my feeling of MTA disappointment resolved away. My friend and I waited only a few minute to be seated. Our waiter took our drink order and we were off to the races. As I sat there enjoying my wine, I could not help but take in the beauty of this place. I was also impressed with the friendly staff and the incredible music music playing. The DJ needs to be applauded for his nonstop groove! Everything that I order (short-rib fried dumpling - herb chicken - apple crisp ) was absolutely amazing. The five stars represent the totality of my experience. STK Downtown is an absolute hit!! The entire staff needs to be commended!

I had a reservation for a group of people and the whole group wasn't there for our reservation time, so we lost our table. I kept begging the hostess to please just seat the people in the group that were there so that we could at least still have dinner, and we had to end up waiting two hours before being seated. It's not fully the fault of the restaurant, so I didn't include that situation as part of my review, but I didn't appreciate the snobby attitudes of the hostesses behind the front counter. Once we were finally seated after having a few drinks at the bar, we realized it was going to be really hard to hear each other across the table. This place is really hip, with a fun and trendy atmosphere. It's definitely the type of place to get dressed up with friends to have a good night. The music was awesome, it was just a bit too loud. Our waitress was really slow, stretching out our dinner another two hours, which could have gone a lot quicker had she been more attentive. We started off with a few cocktails and the complimentary monkey bread that was really good! Next up, I ordered the Filet Medallion with King Crab on top. The filet was so boring. There was no char on the steak and it was completely lifeless. The crab was overlooked and tasteless. For sides, we ordered the Mac and Cheese and Brussels Sprouts. The Mac and Cheese was a 2 out of 5. I can make creamier Mac at home and be more pleased. The Brussels were really good; the red peppers brought a nice touch to the side dish. For dessert, we ordered the Warm Cookie with Vanilla Ice Cream and the cookie must have been from yesterday's batch because it was hard and barely lukewarm. There also wasn't enough ice cream for the big cookie. It was a horrible dessert. Overall, this is one of my bottom tier steak restaurants.

The rooftop has a BEAUTIFUL view and both covered/open air seating. We started outside but got cold and the waitress graciously moved us over to a table right next to the heater.Both drinks and food were very solid. The Green Intensity cocktail (jalapeño infused) packs a great spicy kick and is really fun to sip on! The truffle fries come in a cute little skillet and are DELICIOUS.

I made plans with my 2 best friends (since childhood) to get together for dinner this past weekend at STK. We used to frequent this spot pre children. We stopped at the bar first since we came in early. After trying to catch the bartenders attention for sometime, the blonde bartender came by and took our order. We ordered two drinks that came to about $35. I gave her cash. She tipped herself $10 from the cash back. Please explain why she feels she needs to get $10 tip for two drinks that she poured out of a bottle. I would normally speak up, but I have not seen my friends in over a year and did not want to start the night with a bad note so I let it go.For dinner, we ordered the steak dish (cannot think of the name) that was $134 which looks like a porterhouse. It was by far the WORST steak I ever had. When the waitress came over to ask how it was, we did not say anything and that is the biggest mistake we made. None of us wanted to ruin the night we planned in advance. What were they going to do, replace the dish? We were over it by then. Reason for 1 star is because our waitress was sweet and the side dishes were good (creamed spinach, mac and cheese, and creamed Yukon potatoes).",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

I didn't think I would have to remind them of my request considering the Miami location always pays attention the these details. We arrived 25 mins early and had a drink at the bar while we waited. I recommend trying the Ophelia Flame cocktail. Unfortunately they did not fulfill my request and attempted to seat my boyfriend and I in a cramped booth with a ripped seat while they were an abundance of spacious booths the server could of chosen for us. Regardless of the lack of attention to detail this location has I have to say the food was amazing. We ordered the kind crab legs to start ( keep in mind only two come in the order) they were delicious. My boyfriend had the sirloin steak Oscar style with a side of lobster mac and I had the Market Fish with a side of Brussels sprouts.

I've been to all STK locations around the United States and still STK downtown has been one of my favorite location of the One Group! My second favorite location is STK Miami.This evening my entire opinion of STK has completely changed. I had ignored all the telling signs throughout the years because I was a big fan of their food . Regardless , they were never known for their service. They were known for their trendy atmosphere and fantastic food . That trendy atmosphere that once graced STK downtown has become stale. Their food can't carry for their waitstaff short comings ! Every year on the day I was born , which is typically called your birthday. For the past 5 years, I would celebrate my birthday at STK . I would have a wonderful dinner with my party followed by real conversation that will end with a candle & dessert! No singing !!! That is just too embarrassing ! Every year, my party would make a reservations at STK. They will always instruct the reservationist that they would like a candle with desserts because they are celebrating a birthday and to keep it quietly since it's a surprise .Every year, STK would provide a candle in my dessert! That candle had symbolized the day I was born, my birthday!  Candle marked the day for me ! Last year , my mother had pass away . Thus , I mourned for the entire year which I did not celebrate my birthday nor any holiday . It's already hard enough missing the one person you would like to be there , but can't be their physically only in spirit.My party and I waited for the desserts to be brought out!  We waited about 22 minutes for STK waiter to bring out my dessert. Once they did , we realized something was missing !!! There was  no candle on the desert to mark my birthday!!' I was terribly upset and very disappointed that I personally brought it to the managers attention! It was just another ordinary dinner!!!  How  is this different than any other dinner ? This is my birthday dinner!  It need to be different,  we need to mark the occasion !! We were than told by the manager , he will be right back ! A woman then approached the table & stated to us that unfortunately they do not take reservations in house so they do not know who we spoke to at STK reservations off site. Than  they took off my $12 dessert! Her attitude was very nonchalant , like oh well . Listen I'm not looking for a free meal people ! I'm the CEO for a major global beauty brand. Every year I share my birthday with my family, friends at STK . STK & The One Group robbed me of my birthday celebrations this year 2017 ! They couldn't even acknowledge their responsibility for screwing things up. Than they had the audacity to push it back on us.. How stupid you think my party is ? We do this every single year! My party knows how important my birthday is especially not being able to celebrate it last year! Listen I understand things happen in life!  I get it, but I'm a paying customer requesting a service , and yet I did not receive said services! I feel robbed! Instead of enjoying my birthday evening I am forced to write reviews on a business that did not acknowledge or take any accountability on their mistake . A simply I'm sorry would of been suffice , but instead they tried to pass fault to a third party that is employed by STK and the One Group.  Also , what happen to coat check in this establishment ?

102,oOnBiKOsaLCxQVSVaFoeHA,Noelle S.,4.0 star rating,"I organized a bachelorette party at STK. There were several things I want to bring attention to. Firstly, originally the plan was to have the bachelorette party at their sister location, Bagatelle, down the block. A contract was signed and all. Two days before the event, I was informed that Bagatelle's construction was not finished and they could not longer hold the party there. Although this was a disappointment to hear about this for I've been organizing for several months and been in discussions with no information that there was construction taking place, they had a solution to transfer the contract at STK. I've been to both places and was apprehensive to transfer to STK for I was used to that just being a dinner place not a party atmosphere. We were given a private room for dinner, which honored the contract price of Bagatelle. In addition, we had our own speakers to play our own music. The staff was attentive and made sure our party was happy and satisfied. In addition, Amanda who in 24 hours honored and made the new contract ensured all was up to our standards. She even checked in with me via email after the event to ensure how everything went. The food is good. The steak I enjoyed a lot. I wouldn't say its the best steak you can get in NYC, but to have a DJ atmosphere and food and drinks, it's a great place to go.

I took my friend out for his birthday since I owed him one, and I always love the ambience here. The music was great, and the food of course was great as usual. Our waiter was really nice, and friendly. He assisted us in what's a few popular items, because it's been a while since I've came back here. I decided to keep it original, and got the skirt steak, while my friend got the duck. As for drink selection, I'm a whiskey girl, so the waiter introduce me to the ""Not Your Daddy's Manhattan"" -- loved it. It was just right like goldilocks porridge lol.. I started with a starter Of the crispy lobster tails. It was delicious, and I was in loveeee with the flavor of the mini slaw mixture that enhanced it. I was introducing my friend into red wine, because he doesn't have much knowledge about blends and body of wine. The waiter selected a wine of his choice saying ""Let me choose something for you and I'll think you'll like it."" He came back, with a full bodied glass of Malbec and my friend liked it. As for dessert it was my friends birthday, so they brought out this delicious baked cookie .. The cookie was cooked to perfection, soft and moist.

If you're going on a date or  a business meeting I would suggest the STK in Midtown which has a bit more of a relaxed vibe. If you are out with friends looking for a good time STK Downtown is definitely the place. This place gets packed on the weekends with an endless amount of dance clubs surrounding its location. My last visit I decided to go with my usual choice here which is the skirt steak with the chimichurri  sauce and mac n' cheese as my side. Also went with a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon which was fantastic. Also sampled some other sides that night that my guest had including the truffle fries and the mushrooms. Everything was fantastic as always. The steak is always juicy and flavorful. Service is always wonderful, the place is cozy and again it is in a very convenient location.

We ordered almost everything so I'll break it down.  They brought the table bread with a warm  chutney dip... delicious, but I had to hold back to leave room for all the rest we ordered. Seasoned octopus very good. This is coming from someone who doesn't care for octopus. It wasn't fried just grilled and seasoned. The fired lobster tails were good. I didnt really care for the shredded carrot mix in the middle. I think they can put something else in the middle for decor but also good to eat. The kale salad had a nice subtle vinegar taste and was a good size. We had more than enough for 3 people. Our second round of food came with cauliflower, BRG sliders x 3, and glazed short rib. All of these were delicious. The short rib was tender and juicy. The slider was everyone's favorite. The cauliflower was cover with almonds on top and went perfectly with the cauliflower. 3 people shared all this in a family style dinner and paired it with a nice glass of cab.  I loved it all. For a Wednesday night they had the place loud with music you can dance too. Although I was in the corner by the window next to the sidewalk, I saw people int he bar lounge area drinking it up and dancing. So pretty cool place to come and also just have drinks and dance for humpday Wednesday. Nice ambience. There was a more dressed up business attire in the bar area.

117,lD3h34uv4HpEfx6gmUE0xw,JohnnyPrimeC. C.,4.0 star rating,"STK (Meatpacking) overall score: 87My wife and I picked up a flash deal for this place that gave us a $150 credit to spend, which we purchased at a discounted price. Check out how the deal turned out:Flavor: 9We shared a 36oz bone-in rib eye.This thing had a lot of nice flavor for a non-aged steak. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare from end to end, with the exception of the expected slight over-cooking that often happens to the fat cap portion of a large rib eye.There were no scraps left on the plate when we were finished with it. We even cleaned off all the bits that were still clinging to the bone.Choice of Cuts & Quality Available: 8All the steaks on the menu are prime quality beef, but they didn't offer anything that was aged.The good news is they have several sizes of steaks to suit whatever kind of pussy appetite you might have, and two people can share the large steaks.Portion Size & Plating: 8Portions are pretty good here. While two of the large cuts seemed a bit pricey, I felt the porterhouse was fair and that all the other cuts were correctly priced as well. Side items and apps were also good. Plating was basic but with a touch of attention to beauty.Price: 9With the flash deal in hand, this was a great experience. I might feel the prices were a bit steep otherwise, but we left completely happy.Bar: 8The bar here is quite different from the upstairs rooftop version of this restaurant. This bar is more spacious, with lounge seating and a fireplace right there.They did a nice job mixing up our cocktails, and I can see this place getting pretty crowded on nights and weekends.Specials and Other Meats: 10There is chicken, lamb, duck and beef short rib for those who don't want a real cut of steak. On special this time was a 16oz boneless rib eye from Niman Ranch. But they also have some wagyu selections available as well, for those with fatter wallets. I was glad to see that they changed up the specials from last time I was here, up on the rooftop. That means they're constantly pushing the envelope.Apps, Sides & Desserts: 9My wife and I tried two apps, one side and a dessert. All of them were fantastic. Here's how it went down:Beef Tartare: This was really delicious, and quite possibly one of the best in town. It was well dressed, nicely salted and chock full of nice, high quality beef.Fois Gras: This was slightly on the small side, but the candied orange and mini pancakes made for a fun and different take on the dish.Broccolini: Simple and well executed, these tasty stalk were sauteed with garlic, oil and seasonings. They came away with a really nice texture and tons of flavor.Apple Crumble: This tart with ice cream was very tasty. The apple pie portion was warm and fresh, with lots of Autums flavors.Seafood Selection: 8There are at least three or four fish items on the entree menu to choose if you have a snatch and don't eat meat, but we certainly didn't try any. The appetizer fare is chock full of shellfish and other seafood items, however, and some of those are pretty good, based on my experience on the rooftop.Service: 10Jerome, our waiter, was great, and the manager came around to ask how everything was during the meal. They sent out complimentary glasses of Prosecco when we started the meal, too, because my wife told them we were celebrating our anniversary when she made the OpenTable reservation. In addition, we really enjoyed the table bread here, which was a sort of ""monkey bread"" with garlic butter on top and an herb butter dipping sauce on the side.Ambiance: 8This is really the only difference between the rooftop and down in the regular restaurant. Upstairs offers something really unique, and downstairs seems to match the decor and vibe of their other locations, like the one in midtown.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

No problem and handled very well! The food was great!  Much better than the last time I remembered going there and service through our meal was good too and we even went by our waiters suggestions which we're spot on!  It was just over two hours into dining, which is par and we were hoping someone else was going to drop by for a drink and we were also debating on staying a bit.  All of a sudden without any notice or warning, our server Ryan dropped our check at the table!  I noticed it and asked by husband and our friend if they had asked for it and no one did!  I looked for our server and couldn't find him.  A young lady walks by and I asked if she worked there to which she said yes.  I told her what happened to which she replies, ""I don't know, are you here for 3 or more hours"" and I said no and what has that got to do with it?  Mind you dinner for 3 with drinks was almost $600.00!  No problem when all is good.  She rolled her eyes at me to which I became unglued.  I asked for her manager who came over and introduced himself as John.  He apologized and said the server had to leave for a family emergency. Okay I understand and get that but there are other ways to handle this.  I am not at a diner during breakfast!  He became flustered and said I am sure he was distraught and wasn't clearly thinking.  As he is saying this bull, I see our server not once but twice still serving other tables?!  Your lying to me on top of all this!  Seriously!  WTF!!!!  I asked for his manager as I was furious at this time, but keep in mind I never raised my voice!  As he walked away, I said to my husband, ""What an ass"" John hears, this and comes back and says ""whats did you say"" to which I replied, your an ass and get away from me!  It took everything in my power not to go over the table and lunge at him!  Mind you all each of us are over 200 lbs and over 6 FT tall!  Big guys.  But to confront me!  He then proceeds to come back in a huff and tries to intimidate me by saying his manager is in the middle of something and will be with us when he could.  I said fine we will wait.  Only a few minutes went by and the Manager came down to speak to us.  My guest asked my husband to record this as it was getting really ugly and bad.  The Manager had no words to express his apology, he did offer us a round of drinks and to go to the rooftop to which I said its not about that.  Its about the experience and you just blew it!  I was dumbfounded how all this could have gone down so bad and quickly to which they we're trying to intimidate us and make us feel bad?  I don't get it.  I told the manager that the power of Social media will prevail on this one and I am furious on how bad this was and went down.  There was nothing that they could do at that point as I was over it!  Low and behold my husband posted we were at STK and another friend ours of the blue who was in the area read about it and she dropped in.  She read the post on Face Book to which I said, lets go we are leaving and I will explain later.  I am in the customer service business for over 30 years, I have had to adapt to many changes, but I never changed on the way I treat people as I want to be treated the very same way.  Moreover: you dropped the check for whatever reason, but you also dismissed us, we were more than prepared to pay the price for what was warranted as a great experience..., but more so you prejudged us as to how much we could spend!  Not in today's market will this treatment encourage a good business practice!",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

We were told we would be seated upon this person's arrival. Our reservation was for 8:15pm and we were seated closer to 10:00pm. I made this reservation a month ago. Aside from the extensive wait, the hostesses were very arrogant and made us feel as though we were inconveniencing them by being there. The restaurant was very busy and they clearly did not care about delivering a good experience. I asked for an update every 30 minutes which was followed by eye rolls and short responses. When we were finally offered a table, it was the worst one in the house which we refused. I can understand a restaurant being busy and there being a wait, but blatant rudeness is inexcusable. While waiting for our table, we ordered a drink from the bar and sat in the waiting lounge in front of the bar. The waitress then told us if we wanted to sit on these sofas we had to order the drink from her (so she could get the tip). I ordered a second glass of champagne (this time through her) and it was delivered warm and in a white wine glass. Everyone seemed to be in a bad mood and have a major attitude. After speaking with the manager, a round of drinks and an appetizer was provided which was appreciated but doesn't make up for the terrible experience. The food and drinks were pretty good.

As she arrived late, we had to wait approximately 30-45 minutes for a seat. The place was packed and we were finally seated about midnight. We were all starved and knew what we wanted. Collectively we ordered lamb, siroloin steak (2) porterhouse (1), lamb (1) creamed spinach (3) mac and cheese (3), asparagus (1), and broccolini (1) (which never came) The food took a decent amount of time (20-25 minutes). However, the bread took about just as much time, but it was well worth the wait. The siroloin and it was a bit rough, but it was managable. I had a few cuts of the porterhouse and that was tender and excellent. I regret going with the sirloin and will definitely opt for porterhouse next time.Overall, I was pleased with my food, not so much the siroloin, but the porterhouse. However, between the wait time, the fact the server was very forgetful about various things we asked for (broccolilini, napkins, to go boxes, drink) it became a bit frustrating. Also, I believe some of the items are a bit over priced, but that's basically every restaurant in Meatpacking District.

And very overpriced.We had a table reserved for 9:30: when we arrived they greeted us warmly and asked us to wait at the bar. After 15 minutes no sign of our table and we discovered they had a problem with the reservation system and our (and other people's) table wasn't ready at all, not even booked.After another 10 mins wait they took us to the last table next to the kitchen: notice that table, because you never, ever have to have it at STK.The reason? 2-3 nasty AC ducts spitting icing cold air on the poor patrons. Us.My wife had to keep the coat on all night (the air at our table was colder than outside).The waiter was pretty good and said they would have switched off the AC but clearly nobody cared. So with a freezing wife keeping her coat on and my head in the cold we had dinner.About the food...Appetizers mixed: great fois gras, good scallops and tuna tartare, horrible octopus (tasted like boiled octopus in vinegar).Main course: exceptionally tender filed 10oz but it arrived almost blue and I asked it medium-rare. That was my only dish for the night so I didn't want to wait for them to get it right. I hate rare-blue meat, but it was really prime quality, so I chewed along and ate it. The other main was the duck breast that was good but too sweet for my taste.Desserts: avoid big time. We had the orange cheesecake (never had a heavier cheesecake in my life) and a chocolate something dessert that I don't remember how was called and nobody really liked.Drinks: great drinks. If I will ever (I doubt) go back to this place, I will have another drink.Price: what you expect in a fancy steakhouse with loud music in the Meatpacking District? Over-overpriced. But at least in some places in the area you have an experience either with the food, or with the ambience.

The inside is beautiful, the rooftop was rockin', and the people were gorgeous. My favorite dish was the boring ass iceberg blue cheese salad. We didn't even order it, but we saw it brought out to the table next to us and it looked so refreshing we had to get us some. Glad we did. Their bread thing was damn good too. Warm, with some herb butter, and herby olive oil. I had a small piece, but could have kept going if we didn't order so many other items. My girlfriends had the bone in rib eye, I went with the steak loin. Everyone did medium rare. The meats were cooked perfectly to temp, but the rib eye was where it was at. The steak loin was good, but I wasn't a big fan of the grill flavor for some reason. You should get the parmesan truffle fries. The brussels sprouts were tasty too, it was like a szechuan sauce on it. The cauliflower gratin was good at first bite, but the more I ate the more it disgusted me. Too mushy. There were two things I really disliked. The first was that is was really freakin' hot. I was wearing a blue skirt and I was afraid I may have sweat through it. Please turn on the AC. Then there was the super loud club music. I enjoyed the music, but it was so loud that dinner conversation was not possible. If I came back I'd only do drinks on the rooftop, which is where we headed after dinner.

The reason I picked STK was because of the great reviews and photos!  It is suppose to be one of the best restaurants in Manhattan that provide upscale dining and great service. However my experience was the complete opposite my night at STK turned out to be a disaster. Before ordering I showed the bartender the Yelp check in offer for the complementary bubbles at the bar and that's where the problems started. He suggested I get another drink which I happily  did. I handed him my debt card and he attempted to charge me, swiping my card multiple times. Eventually he said he was having problems with his computer therefore I paid with cash. After dinner I tryed to pay with my card and for some odd reason it was declined. I very embarrassed! So I just paid with cash again and left. The next day I got in contact with the bank and was notified that one of the team members at STK wanted to charge my card $818.23.  I am glad my bank automatically flagged it as fraud and declined it. However if I would have given my credit card I would be out $818.23. This is unacceptable. I don't know if they were trying to do a credit card scam or what but I definitely was upset.I honestly think it was the bartender that attempted to charge that amount. Not only did he look drunk but when he was making my drink he spilled vodka all over. If you go use cash. Save yourself the headache and potential embarrassment. Do not trust these people with your credit card!!!! Food- both the chicken and steak were dry. There isn't A1 sauce but the sauce (third best thing I had) that was given for the steak was good. It has a BBQ taste. It really is better with the chicken rather than the steak.Sides- If you get the truffle fries you are paying a dollar a fry. Also just don't get the fries unless you like wedge type fries. They are thick and soft with little to no flavor.  Mac and cheese is great (the best thing I had). The broccoli is great (second best thing I had).",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

I came super hungry and even though there was an open bar, I b-lined it straight to the mini-burgers. I will say off the bat that each slider is $10. Yes, that is super expensive, so don't come here and whine about the price. You've been warned. However, if you look past that, you will be amazed by the variety and flavors in each of these burgers.I started with the Char Sui Chicken with Asian Slaw. The chicken was crunchy even though it was slathered in a sticky, sweet Asian sauce. The meat was juicy and perfectly fried. What surprised me most was the quality of the bun (for all the sliders). They are seriously delicious, just as much, if not more, as the filling itself. The BBQ Pork Belly with Cipollini Onion Apple Sauce was also a sweet slider. The meat was tender and full of umami tastes. The sauce worked in a perfect harmony with the meat. The Tempura Shrimp with Sweet and Sour Sauce was scrumptious as well, though pretty standard and didn't blow my mind like the other four sliders.The Grilled Wild Mushroom with Garlic Herb Aioli was so savory that I forgot I was eating a veggie slider. The truffle taste inundates your mouth in warm goodness and the aioli adds so much complexion to the slider. The Lil Burger with White Cheddar and STK Special Sauce was really the cream of the crop. The burger is cooked at a perfect medium rare and oozing with juices and flavor. Everyone agreed that this was one of the best sliders to ever exist (exaggeration).I'm a huge fan of their sliders.

The light was dim and romantic and the staff was courteous and nice.We got a few bottles of wine and bar was consumption based. There were mini truffle cheeseburgers that were very yummy. We had a ""famly style"" dinner with bleu iceberg salad, lump crab salad, entrees like skirt steak, ribeye steak, seared tuna, chicken, sides including truffle fries, mac and cheese and brussel sprouts, and desserts including assorted sorbet, apple cake and chocolate cake.I would say the food was 3.5 stars. The company and ambiance kicked it up a notch. I enjoyed the skirt steak better than the ribeye and enjoyed the sides. The crab salad was better (for me) than the iceberg salad (bc the bleu cheese was a bit strong for me). The desserts were ok. The mini burgers were great!

It's also extremely loud inside so it feels more like a night club than a restaurant. The food is also variable...I am not a fan of the sides, the appetizers are alright (I loved the Kale salad), the lobster is not very favorable and the bone in filet mignon is good but over seasoned as most of their steaks are. If you are serving good meat, you don't need so much seasoning. I think all the great steakhouses know that...so this is definitely not the place I would go if I was looking for great steak.

Coat check in on the second floor and then back downstairs to the bar while we waited for our table. Everyone was basically dressed like they were going to a club and all the ladies looked amazing. My wife and I went down the entire cocktail list and then some before we got seated (roughly an hour). We met a few famous folks and then the hostess finally grabbed us an escorted us to an amazing part of the restaurant. They started us off with some great bread/chimichurri sauce and then we moved along to the mains. She went with the bone in rib eye and I went with the porterhouse. The sides were also huge so we shared an order of wild mushrooms. We came her for the party atmosphere and didn't expect an amazing steak... But we did! This place is not on the level of my platinum standard spot but it is still an excellent cut. They marinate their steaks in some type of sauce and they season them well with salt and pepper. The rib eye was definitely the way to go by the way though the porterhouse fans won't be disappointed.  We plowed through a few glasses of Pinot noir as we grooved to the amazing music that the DJ was playing. As the clock stuck 1am the crowd/music was very ""turnt up"". Lots of dancing, lots of bottle popping. Definitely a nice change of pace from your traditional steak house. We will be back!

Worth it though.The sides were very good too.  Cream corn was very creamy and very corny.  Just what you'd expect.  Mushrooms were amazing too.  Perfect compliment for the steak.It's a bit of a night club atmosphere for my taste.  Loud music but good music.  Just seemed odd for a steak place with food this fine.Seating was a bit odd at a table with one side on a  booth and the other a chair.  Considering the loud music, it was difficult to hold a conversation with someone on the other side of the table.  If you come in as a couple and get this type of seating, don't expect to talk unless you're ok with shouting.  I think of steak houses as places where you can share good conversation about wine, food, etc.  That was part difficult.  Thus taking away a star. I guess it depends what atmosphere you're looking for.Oh, the complimentary bread with butter and blue cheese topping was to die for.  I was going to order it off the menu until I found out it was complementary!",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

I wrote on the reservation that it was my fiancé's birthday and nothing was done to acknowledge that. Also, we let the waiter know that I was allergic to shellfish. We ordered the risotto with vegetable, but the one with lobster was served instead. I was seconds away from eating something that could send me to the hospital. The waiter was super apologetic though and gave us free glass of wine and dessert in order to make up for the mix up. Overall, it was a very good night and I'd definitely recommend this place for date night or even a lively group dinner.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

The restaurant has a very elegant atmosphere but not too pretentious...the only thing could be the music...amazing dj set, but maybe a little bit too loud. But the best thing is the food. We ordered the seafood entree, just marvelous, especially the prawns! Be sure to be hungry...it's delicious but big! As mains we had the fillet mignon, the medium t-bone, the medium sirloin steak and the herbs' marinated chicken breast....the meat was just as it should be tender, juicy and cooked as you have asked! You have a choice from four kind of sauce...try them all! We took as well some side, I have to recommend the truffle oil fries!!!! At last the desserts...you should have the mini doughnuts with the strawberry and chocolate sauces! The apple crumble tart was divine and the tree gelato scones were great. At the end I have to say thank to the amazing staff concentrate on the customers needs and always there to help!

163,gfH1FWkaRWv4W1ZUaiGekA,Mate P.,1.0 star rating,"My main point is: avoid this place people, you cant pay with credit cards here, and they make you wait for 90 minutes. They claim it has never happened before, but based on a few other reviews here, it definitely has. The details:Food and drinks were OK. Service was a bit on the annoying and slow side, but nothing serious during the meal.Our problems started when we wanted to pay. The waitress brought back our card and told us it's declined and we have to call the bank. We were a bit surprised, and gave her another one instead. She came back - declined. We ended up giving here five credit cards in total, from different banks and credit card companies. She insisted none of the cards are working. This has never happened with any of us before. So we started calling our banks. They (of course) confirmed the transaction requests haven't even arrived, and there's nothing wrong with our cards. After about 20 minutes the manager confirmed the bar's payment system is not working and asked us to wait. We didn't have this much cash on us. Now, I'm not a restaurant manager, but this is how I think this situation should have been handled:1) Free drinks for the table after 10 minutes2) Sincere apologies and promise of a discount after 20 minutes3) Apologize for wasting our time and tell us we are free to go after 30 minutesWhat they did was:1) Completely abandon us, the waitress at one point asked us whether our ""problem"" is being dealt with - isn't that your job to know?2) They played the same game with other tables, NOBODY could pay with cards, and yet they kept asking people to call their banks, it was outrageous3) The waitress stopped twice to start blaming the banks, which was incredibly annoying4) They stopped refilling our water after a while5) After 50 minutes the manager told us they still cant figure it out, and they are going to make a paper copy of our card, and then he is going to ""Let us go"" ....... I mean wtf. Like we are some sort of criminals. 6) After 90 minutes they actually made a copy and graciously let us go, the mischiefs we are for wanting to pay with card at a bar. Full price, of course. And they were expecting a tip. Overall, incredibly poor service, rude and amateurish attitude once anything unexpected happens.

I wasn't fortunate enough to dine in their rooftop lounge but the inside is just as good! The garlic truffle bread they give you for starters with the chive oil reduction was mouth watering. As an entree we ordered the 10oz filet with the truffle fries, the Brussels sprouts, the Mac n cheese, and the jalapeño cheese grits. They were all equally amazing. Not one thing was disappointing. My only complaint is that the chef overcooked everyone's meat but it was still great. I would also recommend trying the burger sliders as an appetizer, along with the kale salad.

The hostess seemed unconcerned. It was pretty crowded due to happy hour as well, so we just told her we would wait for a table inside. The inside is big and has a nice ambience, but very loud because of the DJ so you have to yell over the music when you talk. We had drinks while we waited for the table, which was about an hour. It was restaurant week so we ordered off that menu. I thought my steak frites was OK, nothing to rave about, but obviously they don't put the best items on the pre-fixe menu.

The dessert we had five small donuts and ice cream on dried small round cake with two candles Celebrate the birthday of our friend.In short, anyone who wants to eat a good Steak this is not the right place, there are many very good restaurants to eat NYC , surely we are not going back to eat at this place anymore.

The COCKTAILS to start off were well worth the Meatpacking price. As far as the meal was concerned the PORTHOUSE was one of the best I have yet to have in NYC. The med/rare steak had an flavorful char that left my mouthwatering for more. I definitely recommend getting a good wine to pair with the steaks, it will make it that much enjoyable. I combined it w the Prisoner red wine. For dessert the warm cookie with  ice cream was a nice little sweet to end off the meal. I have to give 4 stars tho .

We had a wine called Cherry Pie (Pinot Noir) from Napa and it was the most interesting red experience I've had so far, I cant really even describe it other than it is an interesting mildly tannic fruity combustion.Everyone at the table got a wedge salad except me who opted for the pork belly on watermellon, yes on WATERMELLON. It was so interesting because the pork belly was cooked like deeply cooked bacon (very hard and crunchy) and it had a maple glaze finish and made it a bit chewy later on and putting that with onions and fetta on the watermellon which basically acted like chips for the dry pork belly to rest on created a very yin yang flavor profile with lots of different textures. The juices from the watermellon canceled out the overall otherwise dry dish and made it amazing.We had a ton of steak and different sides. The mac and cheese was my fav (not the lobster one we didn't get that but im sure its even better), the spinach was good as always because its pretty consistent at most decent steak houses. I had the duck and that was fantastic, and it comes with a crab cake although slightly overly fried. The rest of the table got some kind of steak and they all enjoyed it.Dessert we had the cheesecake and the fudge brownie both were amazing but the brownie was slightly chewy-hard though the ice cream next to it made it a lot better. I believe the cheesecake was a key lime one or at least thats what it tasted like.

This place deserves 5-Stars - ambiance, decor, attitude, energy, location, food, selection, service, two bars.MINUS 1-Star for the LOUD music on a Saturday night. This is basically a nightclub with a deejay posing as a restaurant. The deejay was awesome and he played great selections on his Apple Macbook, but we were there with 12 people for a very special birthday and it was a real bummer we couldn't communicate with each other. We were actually TEXTING EACH OTHER AT THE TABLE to communicate. LOL  I would think if we spend US $2000.00 for a dinner that we could have a nice, quiet, relaxing atmosphere.These were friends I haven't seen in 5 months and yet it was really impossible to talk unless we were sitting right next to each other.Minus 1-Star - for the annoying bathroom guy. I didn't have a chance to visit the ladies room but I assume there is an annoying bathroom girl in there too? I will never understand why they feel we would desire a guy working in the bathroom to hand us towels and turn on the water for me. Maybe in an Ultra-high-end restaurant but this isn't quite there.  Sorry bathroom guy, I didn't have anything smaller than a $10 and you weren't getting that.  I felt so uncomfortable using the bathroom. The bar was too crowded to get change before I used the restroom so I just had to deal with the bathroom attendant I don't really need. I just want a clean bathroom with nice towels - not a bathroom so dark I couldn't even see myself in the mirror and then I had to get a glaring look from this dude when I said ""thank you"" and walked out without handing over my ransom.

Entrees ordered the skirt steak and seared tuna with a side of asparagus. Wow. It's portioned perfectly. The tuna was a bit spicy, but def gave it a kick. My steak was amazing, perfect size for me. Everything was great. One star off for the waiter ""Craig"". I understand you have multiple tables to tend to, but I felt under tended. When he did show up at our table he was very attentive.

For dessert I got the Apple Crumb cake, which I devoured within minutes because I love hot and cold items as desserts. The Apple crumb was a tad bit crunchy and chewy while the ice cream provided the real sweet kick to the flavor. I also had the rose champagne and red wine to compliment the meal.

The ambiance is perfect for a romantic dinner or an adult gathering. There is a fireplace in the front as well as dinner tables. As you go towards the middle/back there are these cozy circular booths. The lighting is dim...perfect for those stolen kisses Once you order, you are given bread. This is no ordinary bread. It's a warm small persist sized loaf in a deep dish. It is served with this garlicky pesto dipping sauce. It is filling so try to pace yourself and do not get another serving. It takes away from the meal. Appetizer and entrees are well proportioned. I like the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp is served cold and crisp. It is a three piece appetizer, so ask for one more if you are sharing it. We like filet mignon (off bone). We share a 10oz-12oz. Prepared medium. For sides, we ordered Mac and cheese and something called sweet corn pudding. That pudding side was the icing on the cake. It was sweet and buttery. I never tasted anything like it. That is a must have when dining at the steakhouse. I Am not a dessert person, but we ordered Birthday cake. It is a tort with vanilla icecream and rum. Large enough to share.

The rooftop looked so beautiful in pictures, but it was raining on the day I went so we were seated indoors instead. Indoor was still really pretty and spacious, but packed and dark. It's also really loud, so I found myself having to yell pretty loudly just to talk to my waiter. The staff was so amazing--frequently checking in on us and clearing finished plates. My cousin and I were also on a time crunch, so our waiter was able to put in a word for us and got our food out in like 20 minutes.The food itself was really good. The two of use ordered the blue iceberg salad, parmesan truffle fries, and the medium skirt steak. This was perfect and super filling for the two of us. All of it was honestly so delicious. Don't be fooled with the water options though. Our waiter gave us the option of sparkling or flat water. We chose flat and there was miscommunication because it was so loud, but he ended up giving us a large Fiji water, and that cost us an extra $7. I got a STRAWBERRY COBBLER cocktail and that was the best part of the night. It's strong but doesn't have an overwhelming alcohol taste. It's expensive, but sooooo yummy with chunks of strawberry in the drink! We dropped ~$130. It was a special occasion--don't judge.

""How about a bottle instead?""... ""Sure, I'll take the one for $62, please.""... ""We don't have that one, we have one for $80!""... ""Ok, that's fine.""... ""Do you want sparkling or non-sparkling?""... ""sparkling""... 3 min later, I see bartender opening Veuve Cliquot Rose.  ""Is that bottle $80?... ""No, it's $165""... ""What happened to $80?""... ""You said 'sparkling!!""... UGH 2nd visit, Sunday at 1pm:Patron pukes at bar... we are next to him.  I immediately ask for check, need to go clean/change my shoes.  Before giving me check, bartender (seriously) serves puking patron 2 additional cocktails (actually 3, one for his girl, two for him... yes it is strange when someone throws up at the bar in the middle of the day and decides to order more drinks.  Yes, if I had to go change my shoes, he should have as well.  Yes, this is hard to articulate because clearly he should have left immediately, but surprisingly didn't.)  I asked the hostess what was up and she told me the guy is a regular, so... all forgiven. No, no it's not, seriously, puke, go home.  So, before leaving our unfinished drinks, we had to pay.  The FULL bill.  The bartender saw what happened.  Forget that he served the guy more drinks before cashing me out... he should've reduced the cost of my 2 cocktails!  Or said sorry.  Something.  Conclusion: If not managed properly, the servers have a tendency to focus on short term revenue/tips to the detriment of long term customer loyalty.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

I had a party of 9 and until all of you or almost all of you are there, you won't be seated, which is fine because there are couches by the bar. They sat us with 7 people. There is complimentary coat check and parking is kind of easy to find. 2 hr metered street parking ($3 an hr) parked literally across the street.The food was delicious. What looked like small portions turned out to be filling before being able to finish it. Out of what I had, the mac and cheese was the best! I expected more of the parmesian fries. They weren't what I thought they'd be. Not bad but there were better options. I asked to pay for the bottles of wine separately and the waitress gave me a separate check. She also allowed me to sample a wine before actually buying the bottle.The music and the dj was everything. We literally sat for a half an hr after paying the check just singing and dancing. I hope thry werent mad. He plays old school and new school.The negatives included the amount of time we had to wait for things including dinner granted it was a very busy night and I understand that they also want to bring everyone at the table's food out at the same time.

After walking around for a few minutes, we came upon STK Rooftop. I had never known a rooftop existed here, but when we got to the top it was a pretty chill environment. It was around 9pm and the rooftop wasn't crowded, but there were enough patrons to do some people watching. There were many tables with chairs scattered around the rooftop and plenty of comfortable sofas in between. We managed to get a table with a sofa on the elevated deck (which is just occupied by sofas) and spent the night just chilling there and ordering drinks. Over the course of the few hours we were there, there was a bachelorette party that invaded the surrounding sofas and also other miscellaneous guests, mostly well-dressed, chic and young. Throughout the course of the night, it never got extremely crowded, but there was a constant influx of people.As for the view, it's not the greatest and the rooftop is not really high, but there's a quiet view of the West Side, Highline and New Jersey. The service was constant and we didn't have any issues with it either. The drink prices were expensive, as expected. No real surprises there.

216,o8VqJdeJK6X-RU22hFcWfw,Ed U.,3.0 star rating,"In full disclosure, I didn't choose to dine at STK. I was there for the first night of a business conference, and the organizers provided a fixed menu dinner in the private room up on the third floor. That means we weren't anywhere near the main attraction for the hipsters the place was drawing - the clandestine lounge, the expansive white banquettes, the blaring dance music where everyone was shoulder to shoulder with each other and their designer libations. All of that is on the first floor. On the way up, I did notice the white fiberglass cast sculptures that were meant to evoke Texas longhorn antlers.To me, that epitomizes what STK is about - a steakhouse that doesn't want to look like one in order to bring in the cool, cosmopolitan MePa crowds. In fact, they bill themselves as ""female-friendly"" and ""not your daddy's steakhouse"" and feature only sparsely dressed twenty-somethings in stiletto heels on their website. I can only comment on the food, and I have to say it was decent but nothing outstanding. There was a bit of a wedding banquet feel especially when you're one of fifty being served at the same time. We were given choices albeit limited (see photo), but I think we got a good sampling of their food.I started with the Apple and Endive Salad (normally $15), which was a refreshingly crisp mix with Gorgonzola cheese and spiced walnuts and dressed in a honey mustard vinaigrette (see photo). Then came the steak where we were given a choice between the Loin Strip in an Au Poivre Sauce (10 oz for $33) and what my selection, the Strip Steak in Chimichurri Sauce (6 oz for $24). Had I not just indulged myself at places like Beauty & Essex and the Dutch, I would have gone for the more substantial loin, but the skirt steak suited me that evening (see photo). It was tender enough, but the taste really didn't resonate since the chimichurri camouflaged the flavor of the beef.Because of the size of our table, side dishes were abundant, so I was able to try four of them (usually $12 each) - buttery asparagus spears, creamy Yukon potatoes, Parmesan truffle fries and my favorite of the bunch, the carb-loaded mac 'n' cheese. While others demurred on dessert as they immersed themselves in conversation, I have no such will power. I took control of the Warm Flourless Chocolate Cake served to me because it was melty without being overly sweet. That part came from the small scoop of hazelnut ice cream that came on the side. All in all, for a business dinner, STK did a solid job. Perhaps some other time, I'll get sloshed on the first floor with the whippersnappers.FOOD - 3 stars...decent enough steak though the sides and the dessert outperformed the main eventAMBIANCE - 3 stars...wall-to-wall clubby downstairsSERVICE - 3 stars...they did their job with little intrusionTOTAL - 3 stars...maybe I do prefer my daddy's steakhouse...Sizzler's anyone?",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

New York is New York so not all parties were there at the same time. For some reason the hostess decided she couldn't seat us since people in the party were missing. I asked her why but got a response that was defying logic so that I decided to erase it from my mind. The fact that the place was pretty much empty didn't help her case.Once we got seated, they tried to give us a table looking at some couples dating and the wall. We asked to be reseated and were told that the other tables were specifically reserved. So you can actually get a table number and reserve them now? That's a new one.Well, the manager tried to do some damage control by shaking my hand but we were in a sour mood. As you can imagine, the food saved the evening, plus we had great waiter named Ben.

Ordered steak that came over done, oyster platter for the table came without spoons or anything to serve the sauces, the tuna tar-tar was ok, and quite honestly I could grill the side of asparagus better. I work in the industry and although I called specifically to mention that we were celebrating his birthday and that he had been there a couple of times and intentionally chose STK, there wasn't even a candle or dessert plate with a birthday wish - which is customary of almost any restaurant.

Grilled asparagus was grilled asparagus, it was what it was. The STK Bold sauce was good, and OMG, the BREAD BASKET. Can we just take a moment to discuss this basket of fluffy, buttery sunshine? If I had no self control, I would've wolfed it and not had room for steak. Service was excellent, and the wait staff was so kind and attentive.

When we arrived the security at the door directed us to the wrong line so we spent a good 30 - 45 minutes here. Eventually, we were directed to the right one but this line wasn't moving either. Spent another 40 minutes or more here. Staff closer to the door (checking guests in) was courteous, expedient and professional.Inside - paid for VIP & thought we would have a table but what this meant was seating in a banquette type of area that was over crowded. Food and drinks were not easily accessible because of the number of people present. The one half of a deviled egg and meatball I managed to get my hands on were good.Use of the elevator was interesting! Allowed to quickly check in coats - very much appreciated! When I wanted to use it to reach the ladies room quickly, I was told it was only for staff and some other nonsense. This meant parsing my way through drunken revelers spilling drinks on my expensive dress and climbing 2 or 3 floors in my Manolo's. The elevator bypassed all of this but wasn't available! OK! A very considerate employee allowed me to use it on the way out. This same gentleman was very helpful in directing us to the right area.  Location - good. Service - OK. DJ - was adequate but didn't play much that made me want to move. Why does any DJ have tunes in his mix by Michael Jackson? I may have danced to his stuff in middle school but not inclined to get busy on the floor to anything by him now! Would I return?

The location itself is really nice and it's more of a seen and be seen place and because of that, I think the quality of food has suffered. We went on our visit to NYC with some friends who live in the city. The staff is friendly, but they could work more on their knowledge of the menu. I asked if the porter house was good enough to share for 2, and the waiter said no. I mean who eats 24 ounces of meat at once?! Not sure if he was trying to sell it or if he honestly believed that. Regardless, my husband and I got the porter house to share. Starting with the salad. It was good, after I picked out the goat cheese that I specifically said not to add. So that is either carelessness or it's premixed. I didn't feel like sending it back since I was hungry, so I just did some operation. My favorite part of the meal was probably the bread. The dipping sauce was so good. The actual steak, porterhouse, it was probably the fattiest porterhouse we've ever gotten, aside from the tenderloin part, the other half was basically doing surgery trying not to get giant globs of fat. My husband and I regretted not getting out own filets. We also ordered the Mac and cheese, Parmassan truffle fries, and mashed potatoes. All of the sides were good and our favorite was the Mac and cheese. They are good enough to share. We had 3 sides for 4 people (2 men & 2 women) and still had a little left over. For dessert we got the cheesecake to share and it was good, again nothing spectacular. Overall, if you wanna be seen and pay a pretty penny for that, then this is a place for you.

261,hGMoHjcVdH1zWosSA60-Tw,Mike C.,3.0 star rating,"STK's RLLY PRCY.Typical of a cliched place in Meatpacking, this place is mostly about style and atmosphere for big bucks.Don't get me wrong, the food here was really good and everything tasted fine - but it's just not really worth the $150 plus tax and tip for a normal-sized meal the two of us got.They start you off with this complimentary bread that looks way better than it really is. It's in a cool shape that looks kind of like a flower, and is coated on top with what I assume is butter or something, which is way too overwhelming. My hand was soaking after touching it, and the bread turned out not even being that good. It's very soft and was not hot enough, with not that much flavor to it.For an appetizer, we started with the Lil' BRGRs ($22). These things truly are extremely ""Lil'"", and definitely feel too small to justify paying $11 each. If only they weren't so pricy, because these were some seriously delicious little sliders.For the entrees, we got the Filet (10 oz.) ($46), which was a delicious little hunk of meat, and the Beef Short Ribs ($32), which were also as delicious as you would expect short ribs usually are. These were both great, and about on par with what you would expect of any decent steakhouse.For the sides, we got the Truffle Parmesan Fries and the Mac & Cheese ($12 each). The fries were much different than what you would typically expect of fries - they are shaped almost like perfect rectangles, arranged in neat little Jenga-like stacks. They were pretty delicious, with the parmesan sprinkled on top adding some extra flavor. The Mac & Cheese was of the extremely cheesy, runny variety. When it first comes out, it almost looks like a lasagna, with a thick layer of browned cheese on top, until you mix it in with the pasta below.For the desserts, we got the Birthday Cake and the Peanut Butter Cup ($10 each). These were easily the highlight of the meal, which is usually not a good sign at a steakhouse when the dessert far outshines the other food. The Birthday Cake may have been the better of the two, just because I am a huge fan of ice cream cake, and I rarely see it offered for dessert at restaurants. It was cookie dough ice cream cake, along with some delicious pink frosting that went very well together. The Peanut Butter Cup was just genius though - it was literally a ""cup"" of peanut butter: there was a very generous amount of solid peanut butter (similar to the peanut butter you find at the middle of a Reese's), inside of a cup entirely made out of chocolate, down to a little chocolate handle. It was also served with some ice cream topped with nuts and covering some bananas. These were some truly great desserts.Also, when I pay that amount of money, I expect to get treated with some pretty good service. This was not the case with our waiter, who seemed super sick of it and barely came to a complete stop every time we asked for something or on the rare occasions he came by to check on us.Nevertheless, all of the food came out super quickly, which is always a plus.

On the other hand if you are paying so much for such an appetizer, followed by a good steak and sides you'd expect the service to match. There were a couple ""no-no's"" that they made, which I was surprised that a steak house of this supposed character would make.For example while getting our second bottle of wine they asked if the person who ordered it wanted to taste it (as you should) even though it was the same wine we had had before. However when pouring the bottle to the rest of the table they mixed that with the previous wine... Just not something I would expect. Can't they spare another set of wine glasses, while your paying a $50 steak?Secondary they took away our appetizers and bread far before we were done. Kind of hurried us along the whole night, even though it was a Sunday and not nearly booked to capacity.

The menu is somewhat pared from the restaurant downstairs but you can still get the important stuff like truffle Jenga-shaped fries, Mac and cheese in a tiny cast iron pan, and of course, steak steak steak. It's not the best or worst food in NYC, but its not really all about the food either.

My friend ordered it and I ended up eating he majority of it :) it came in a little pan with melted herbed butter on the top and green olive oil on he side. SO GOOD!We also shared the jumbo lump crab salad. It had bits of avocado, grapefruit, and (drumroll) crab. It was very tasty with a delicious sauce/dressing.The lobster tail appetizer was also yummy! It's friend but not too greasy and pleasantly crunchy.The mac and cheese was ok. Not my favorite. The crust was cheesy and the mac was good, but not mind blowing and not very salty (which can be a plus).The kale salad was delicious! It was a nice sized portion (you know how some salads can run really small). The kale was shredded, it came with a slightly too sweet but not bad dressing, and the hazelnut crunch worked well.Drinks:Our first drink was made with belvedere, lemon, muddled strawberries and a graham cracker rim: YES! Favorite drink of the night. We had multiple rounds. It was not too sweet (the server told me no sugar was added to the drink except for the cookie rim), the bits of strawberries were succulent, and it was so good we had to refrain from instantly gulping it down.I ventured out to another drink made with vodka, chili, watermelon, and lemon. If you like spicy drinks, definitely try it out! It was solid too.Service:Our server didn't smile once the entire time. She was friendly in her responses however, and while we liked her, she did seem kind of ""not into it/us."" The bus staff was friendly and helpful. There was a staff member in a suit (manager?) dancing around the room looking pretty funny.Music:DJ was ok, playing good music but not really letting be songs play lol. 'Twas a good time though. Beware, the music is at club volume. Can't really have romantic conversations there if that's the vibe you're aiming for.In short: I'd come back here, especially for the food and drinks.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

If it is going for the steakhouse vibe they are 100% failing.

The food wasn't terrible but the prices were not even close to the quality. Basically all you need to know is that it is the kind of place that serves BBQ sauce with your steak, no thanks.

I came here for a friend's birthday, a few of us were running pretty late for the reservation and the host was accommodating, which we appreciate especially on a busy Friday night.Decor was upscale modern, with a second floor to situate bigger parties. This place is a great choice to get dinner before going out in meatpacking.As for food, dipping sauce for the bread was tasty. I ordered the 10oz fillet, meat was cooked well but it did not blown me away. I did enjoy the brussels sprouts and the mushroom sides as they were both seasoned really well. Dessert was a let-down. Birthday cake was basically a block of sugar and tasted nothing more beyond it. The maple donut was warm and fluffy, but overall too sweet.I can't speak too much about their cocktails or wine list as I only had one drink, the sweet and spicy. It definitely got a kick to it with jalapeno but overall on the sweeter side of things. If you like fruity drinks with a kick it would be a good choice.Service was very attentive here and we had no problem holding the table a bit longer than we were told initially.

Sirloin - Wow.  Cooked to perfect (medium rare) seasoned perfectly, just the right flavor!The sides: Lobster Mac n Cheese - awesome!  Large chunks of lobster in the mac and cheese was delicious, Asparagus - sauteed well, good - Parmesian Truffle fries - amazing - the light dusting of cheese was delicious. mini burgers - awesome tasty - a bit bready, but that's ok - tuna tar tar - good seasoning.  All in all a good meal!Desserts - The birthday cake and the peanut butter cup were delicious, but the best thing was these doughnut things that were awesome!",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

I also got the blue cheese wedge, very good, and the cauliflower au gratin which was stellar.

309,B3HSiz_HOXqvCv3lkjgYHA,Nicole A.,4.0 star rating,"I've dined at this location twice. Once yesterday and once five years ago. The quality of the food has remained consistent.My initial drink order of the creamy lime drink (cannot remember the name but it was at the bottom of the specialty drink list) was disappointing. It tasted somewhere between a peppermint patty and mylanta. I do not recommend. Fortunately they were very good about switching it to a glass of malbec. The malbec was some of the smoothest tasting wine I've ever had. There was no bite after a sip, which happens quite often in lesser restaurants where the wine quality is not up to par. I could really differentiate the quality of the wine. I would definitely pay close attention to the wine list here, they appear to have a great selection based off that.We started with the lil burgers, which were wagyu beef sliders. They were tender, juicy and flavorful. A side of cornichons and razor thin pickle slices added a nice touch. The truffle parmesan fries are thick spears and uniformly cut. They actually look like jenga blocks if that makes sense and are even layered up in a tower like so. They are different from any other parmesan truffle fries I've ever had (I've had a lot) and coming from someone who prefers shoestring fries over thick cut fries any day, these are some of the best I've ever had so that says a lot. Definitely try those out.For steaks the table shared a small filet medallion, a small skirtsteak, and asparagus (three small girls, don't eat much I guess) but it was enough for us, one of us was even able to take home leftovers. The steaks were ordered medium rare, and actually came out medium rare, which shouldn't be a point of contention but it is hard to find a place that actually cooks meat correctly at the ordered temperature so bravo to the chef for that. The best part is the accompaniment of 8 sauces for the meats. I cannot remember them all, but my favorite was the yellow hollandaise and my second favorite was the red wine sauce. The different sauces make it a fun dining experience and the variety makes it feel like you're eating 8 different meals. It's fun to discuss what your favorite sauce is and such with the other guests.We finished the meal off with little cream puffs and lovely tasting glasses of prosecco. Again, no bite, which I think speaks to the overall quality of the wine selection here.I look forward to being wowed a third time here in the future. If they keep up the consistency, I can't see a reason why they wouldn't remain in business for a long time to come.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

312,ak-hXHRIqWqH7bNKe6SpNQ,Fiona L.,2.0 star rating,"A hit or a miss. I've heard great things about this place, and in fact, I've been here twice. The first time I came here after a dinner date, and I was already very buzzed and happy! Of course, I wasn't really aware of my surroundings, such as rude/lousy people, dirty tables, or the boring view. I was very happy and enjoyed my date's company. I only noticed the bright hanging lights with a buzzing/white noise background, and of course, beautifully garnished and strong alcoholic drinks that I could no longer taste besides that the fact that it was wet and drinkable. I only noticed the romantic lighting and intimate feeling with my date.The second time (which is the reason why I'm giving it a two star) I came here with several other girls - I think 6 others, and this time I was unfortunately sober. The plan was to pre-game before we head out to the club. We didn't even arrive to STK that late. It was only around 9pm, and whoa, everything looks SO DIFFERENT SOBER! On the rooftop, you can do three things: 1) dine at a table, 2) lounge and drink, 3) sit/hang around the bar and drink. We came here for drinks, and with a decently big group of girls, we sat on the couches, but the lounge areas weren't very well designed because there are literally three huge couches in one area forming a C shape. One couch can literally fit five girls, so it was kind of awkward since there were 7 of us. It was difficult to all chat and talk since we were sitting like an L. Even if we had a bigger group to fill the space, the two couches parallel to each other were to far apart plus the loud background noises...it's hard to social with everyone. Also, the tables were wet and dirty. Wish they could spend five minutes wiping down the tables.Yes, it's a rooftop bar, but there's no view. There's nothing to see. At first, I saw the bright lights, I thought there would be some sort of view of the skyline, but nope, that's not true. One more thing, it's in the meatpacking district, so I was expecting it to be more upscale and classy...It definitely can be a good place to party and chill when you have a group of 15 or so, you are extremely drunk/buzzed, and you come around 7ish-8 to start your night.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

It could be a little dark and it got a little loud, so it was hard to hear people. But the appetizers were okay, my  favorite was the pigs in a blanket. It was a wine tasting event, so there were many glasses and bottles of white and red wine. The wine could have been better, but you're really there for the locale. Afterwards, we headed upstairs to the rooftop. It was so nice out and the view was decent, you get to see NJ and the highline park. Because the weather was nice, it made the night enjoyable. The drinks are expensive, but what do you expect in the meatpacking district and a rooftop?

315,C5Ul-WTUT7fek_InvjAPVA,Joe D.,1.0 star rating,"This is a 1 Star review for the rooftop section of STK Downtown. Came here on a Friday night. Were seated pretty quickly but it was downhill after that. 1: The drinks took so long to come from the waiter that my Girlfriend went to the bar to order drinks again.2: When the drinks did come it was made wrong. 3: The food took an incredibly long time and when it did come we requested a sauce for the steak. The waiter said we should have ordered the sauce when we ordered the food. Luckily we got the sauce. 4: The steak was charred on the outside and Medium Rare on the inside not Medium Well like we ordered. 5: There were crab shells in my steak topping...yes Crab Shell in my steak topping. Never ever had that happened at a place that is rated right up there with Mastros. 6: By the time we sent both plates back the manger came over to ask us what was wrong. We explained, sent the food back, ordered a new round, and waited for the new steaks. 7: Her steak comes back out and it's still not cooked correctly. The chef comes over, doesn't say a word as she shows him how it's cooked, the manager and the chef go back to the kitchen and they discuss. 8: We were offered another round but we refused and just decided to leave. After crab shells, slow drinks, and sending her plate back twice we had enough. If i could rate the downstairs separately I would. It was a 5/5 Stars. Our waiter was amazing, the steak was cooked exactly how we ordered it and finished out the night strong. We won't be coming back down to STK downtown. We do love STK Los Angeles though.

Naturally,  we requested to be seated at a better table facing bar and street.  Hostess refused saying that there wasn't a server for that seating area until 7pm.  She had to ask the manager, and then we were offered an equally bad table..We insisted again, and so she had to ask manager a second time, and then we were finally granted a better table.  Only to see some other group, that came in minutes later, be seated right next to us without hesitation.  We let that table incident slide, because we were here to have a good time and celebrate our dear coworker's birthday.  We then ordered 2 Delmonico steaks, a special of the day.  Our waiter told us he would rush to kitchen to set aside those steaks for us because there were only 2 left.  20 minutes later, waiter comes back, after Manager pulled him away, to tell us that our steaks have been sold to someone else?   We requested to speak to the manager because it didn't make sense for this to happen being that we were the first ones here, and first to place the order.  Manager was rude, gave us attitude, and did NOTHING to mend the situation.   This is customer service 101 here, I would have apologized and offered to buy at the very least a round of drinks or something, but he was totally indifferent to our disappointment.  At this point we were relying completely on the food to turn this sour experience sweet.  However, food was nothing out of the ordinary.  For apps we had sliders and green salad.  Salad was OK, nothing new.  Sliders were juicy, but I've had better.  Steak tasted like any other steak from any other steakhouse.   For sides we had brocollini, Truffle fries, twice baked potato, and macaroni and cheese.  The worse out of the latter was the mac and cheese, it wasn't savory at all, and I felt it was even on the sweet side. Truffle fries were ok, but again, not the best I've had.   Twice baked potato, looked really good, but i felt it was a bit bland.  Brocollini was the only thing that I liked.   Drinks were only 4oz and weak.  Overall, Steakhouses in NYC are a dime a dozen, and so this is not worth it.  If you're paying good money for food, you should at least be treated right.  Never again!",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"
320,oapskECtxXLIJqBAkQ90VA,Jose P.,1.0 star rating,"I hardly ever write reviews but, this time I could not hold back. This place is exactly the reason why I try to avoid the Meatpacking District. Last Saturday I went to the rooftop with my GF and another couple. When we were brought to our table we found ourselves between two large parties. My friend was back to back with one of the large parties. So, every time a server was taking care of the other table the would bump into my friend. Every time some from the other table moved, they bumped into my friend. We asked if we could be moved and we were told there were no other available tables. The ladies ordered the same drink. BOTH drinks came warm. The food took some time to get to the table and when it finally arrived we werent impressed. We didn't know who exactly was the server because they were like a passing ship. A client had given my friend gift certificate for the restaurant. When it came time to pay the bill None of the servers knew how the gift certificate system worked. The manager had to come take the info and then we waited. 15 min to get the adjusted bill. First time I've been somewhere with a gift card and the server had no idea what to do. How is that possible?I'm a native New Yorker. I've been eating in nyc my whole life as a child and as an adult. I've ALWAYS rewarded a good experience and service, many times above and beyond protocol. I write this review because it's the first time I have ever agreed to leave a $20 tip on a$400 bill. THATS how bad the experience was. It was a terrible table that we're were sat. The service was unacceptable. This is supposed to be a high end scene but it's completely run like a second rate operation. Trying to get the most money per square inch is what inspired this review.

The servers were able to speak extensively about their wine list, liquors available and preparation of menu items.I started with the grilled octopus and it is the best I have ever had- and I have had it a lot Their braising process before grilling resulted in the most tender and deliciously seasoned octopus!For dinner I had the beef medallion with Oscar on top and it was delicious and beautiful! The lobster and crab were tender and flavorful, the sauce was not too much, and the asparagus were freshly steamed.

We sat patiently the first hour had a couple of cocktails and then started asking the hostess when we would be seated, 10 minutes turned into 40. I spoke with the manager who said he could not remove the people sitting at the table, they were done for sometime and offered a round of free drinks.... Overpriced at that.Finally we were seated 1 hour and 45 mins after our reservation given the round of drinks which I refused mine after 2 Martinis with no food I was already feeling tipsy and wanted to enjoy the meal I asked them to remove a drink from the bill, nevertheless they brought the extra a left the charge for 2. A bottle of champagne was poured as a gesture of good will , only to assume this was what was meant when the manager kept saying he was taking care of us. The bread was good, keep in mind I was ravenous at this point. We ordered a few appetizers to share, mini sliders good , grilled octopus did not taste grilled and had the wrong texture. I ordered the 20 ounce bone in rib eye rare, the temperature was correct. The steak was slightly tough I had a hard time slicing it, especially without a steak knife which you would think in a steakhouse would be supplied. The side of jalapeño cheese grits were good again not worth it. More comped shots came to the table I believe of cafe patron , had enough alcohol skipped on the dessert and wanted out.

We got there around 8pm and though the tables were full the bar was pretty empty.  Typical for NYC.   For starters we had the sliders and a seafood tower. The sliders were cooked to perfection and all of the seafood was fresh and delicious. One negative to the restaurant was the fact that I ordered 4 different bottles of wine before we found one they actually had in stock. I enjoyed a bone in rib eye while my girlfriend had the bone in fillet. Both steaks were very good, cooked well and good quality meat but I have to say they were seasoned a little too much with salt. I did have mine topped with the foie gras butter so that may have contributed to the saltiness. The lobster Mac and cheese (I think was a special) and the Parmesan truffle fries were excellent. We had some dessert but I can't recall what that was.   Afterwards we went to the bar to meet some more friends and at that time the place was packed. Overall I have to say the atmosphere was great, the service was above average and the food was pretty damn good.

348,ZqIzbOuM9m13TquNdoLVkw,Christopher K.,5.0 star rating,"It almost pains me to write a 5-star review for STK because I'm forced to travel to the always-annoying, always-pretentious Meatpacking District to eat here.  But the truth of the matter is that STK consistently delivers one great meal after another every time I dine here with friends. First things first.  STK is not *the* best steakhouse in New York City, though they are up there with the best.  Some people might take issue with that statement, but I've been to every steakhouse imaginable, and STK cooks a great steak that I and my friends thoroughly enjoy each and every time we eat here.  As for ambiance, STK is definitely not for everyone.  On any given day of the week, the place is bursting at the seams with people.  And it's loud.  Really loud.  A DJ typically spins tunes right in the dining room, making the place feel more like a club than a traditional restaurant.  So if that's not your thing, you might want to think twice before coming to STK.I enjoy coming to STK for several reasons. It's a great place to come with a group of 6 or more people who want to make a whole night out of a single meal.  At STK, you will eat and drink for hours, over multiple courses, and still have room for dessert.  I have never been rushed by their attentive, professional staff, but that may be because we spend a lot of money when we come here.  When you're a large group of people, a loud, boisterous scene can be fun, and the DJs seem to always keep the crowds pleased with a good variety of music.  It's a great people-watching place too.  All the beautiful people hang out here.  (That can be annoying too, of course, but I don't mind that when I come here.)What I love most about STK is the variety of food you can dine on.  At most steakhouses, it's all about a gigantic steak.  All other apps and sides are secondary, and you end up with 20 ounces of steak piled in your gullet.  At STK, steaks are just part of a larger dining experience.  You don't have to order a giant steak here.  They have all different cuts of meat at all different sizes.  A 6-ounce skirt steak?  No problem.  Want the whole cow?  Go for the 34-ounce cowboy ribeye.  When we went here last, 6 of us shared a porterhouse for 4, with a sampler of all the sauces they serve on the side.  We also got every side imaginable, including their killer mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, grilled asparagus, and the absolutely not-to-be-missed lobster mac and cheese with shaved black truffles.  This food is to die for.  Literally.But before all that even happened, we started with two rounds of appetizers.  The first included their foie gras french toast.  I had never tried foie gras and never planned to, let alone in a french toast preparation.  But I'm not lying when I say I died and went to heaven after eating he first perfect bite my friend assembled for me.  Oh. My. God.  And then there were an assortment of sliders -- kobe beef sliders to be exact, dressed up like mini Big Macs, each topped with a piece of seared foie gras and black truffle shavings.  This is serious eating, people.   Round 1 was followed by two dozen oysters, and the porterhouses and sides all followed.  Dessert included little mini ice cream cones and more stuff I can't even remember. Not a single morsel was left after any course.  We ate it all and everyone raved about the experience.The night set us back almost $200 per head, but it was money well spent.  Our last trip was on a Tuesday night, when the surrounding area and clientele seem to be much less annoying.  I recommend going on an off-night as opposed to a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night.  These guys are doing things right over here.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

The ambiance is great, beautiful decor, spacious tables (hard to come by in NYC), and the DJ that spins starting around 8pm was really good! The music wasn't too loud either. We ordered the lobster Mac and cheese, amazing! The little crust on top is really good. Get the sliders as an appetizer, succulent and a hint of truffle oil, yum. For the steak, I got a special for the night which was a 20 ounce aged steak cooked medium rare. It was descent but I've had better. You can add sauces, the blue cheese butter sauce is good or the horseradish (doesn't have the strong kick some other horseradish sauces have). I will be back to try their oysters and the braised short rib for sure. Good waitstaff and nice management too. After dinner we went up to the rooftop, which we didn't have to make a reservation for, awesome! It was a little chilly, but they have pashminas you can borrow, very nice touch! If you like a fruity drink, try the pink elegance drink. They make drinks very well and they are strong:)Oma windy night, the smoke from the grills up top can be strong.

350,m6y08dVDyMWQdxjFwkIrxw,Nathan P.,2.0 star rating,"Here is an honest review of this establishment.Friday night 8pm...Lets start with the food here because reading the reviews below you would think that these people have lost their sense of taste and smell.  Frozen steaks and frozen tuna steaks detectable instantly. Anyone who can taste the difference would be appalled despite how yummy the mash potatoes in a cup are. The little bread cups are not only taste-less but also useless since no one could guess that it was bread to begin with. Touching it felt like it was a weird presentation of a glased donut. No idea what people are talking about when they say the bread is amazing. Perhaps the bread was changed recently. Plate presentation was very nice and simple, not too busy. Food quality for what we ordered was tasteless. It's no surprise they offer you a dipping sauce that comes with your frozen steak and don't get me started on the frozen tuna steak. Food quantity was poor for the prices they ask. Epic failure: This establishment tries to be many things at once. A bar, a lounge, a steak house and family style seating which wastes so much seating space in their 1st floor area. There is literaly enough room to dance virtually anywhere you wish. All they need to complete the disaster is to offer karaoke. Apparently there is a roof top thing as well. I would break the walls, keep the DJ, fire every single god forsaken useless manager and the brainless host and open a club. Seriously the security was more usefull than the managers and a million times more polite. I really feel bad for the wait staff for having to put up with the managers and hostess and for the kitchen staff for having to put out food that honestly tastes like stale paper back, no fault of theirs.  This place is not conducive for dating, romantic evenings or family gatherings due to the immensly loud music provided by an on site DJ making it very hard to speak to eachother let alone to your wait staff. Last but not least after an hour and a half management came to our table, interrupted our conversation and asked us to hurry up and leave completely ruining our evening, although the seating area upstairs was empty, apparently reserved for private parties which we found out later no one reserved that day and it could have fill up easily with the line waiting outside to get in.Owners here need to decide what they are doing with this place and choose a singular or a maximum of a dual direction and management needs a firm whipping and a brain.  Food quality and quantity need to be reviewed and fixed.Serving staff was attentive and polite. Kitchen was fast to deliver the orders and food arrived to our party grouped. DJ's music choices were spot on and was groovy. Tables and seating were comfortable. Apparently there is a set max time you can sit and enjoy your meal and managment informed us that 2 hours was the maximum time. Utensils are utterly useless since they are unbalanced and when setting them down on your plate you'll find they fall off due to the heavy end handles. The trickiest to place are the knifes, go figure... The menu was small and simple. Bathroom is clean and roomy with an attendant on staff. Decor was simple and clean. A bit too dark for my taste. Our dinner, 4 adults: 4 main coarses, 3 appetizers, 6 alcoholic beverages, 4 soft drinks, 1 bottle of water = $497I left not only still hungry but also utterly  speechless with ears ringing. Good luck fellow restaurant patrons. If you dine here I hope your experience will be better than mine.

So first I will address everyone who gave this place less than four stars.You mention it's too loud.. Sorry but it's a young and trendy place in the meat packing, take your steak experience to Peter Lugers if you want quiet You mention it's over priced... Quality steak usually comes with a hefty price anyways, and your paying for the overall dining experience. Soak it in.. Or buy your steak at the super market and enjoy your ""cheap"" steak.Lastly you mention the wait.... I get it, if you have a reservation you want a seat and you want it yesterday. But sometimes it doesn't work that way, so let's take the New York City demanding attitude elsewhere and cooperate with the staff. They work hard and you will get your seat before anyone without a reservation.. So let's be grateful.All the good has already been mentioned so I will skip the deliciously over priced drinks and steaks and remind you not to skip on sides!Lobster Mac and cheese, wild mushrooms, octopus salad, and Parmesan fries were amazing on their own.Just remember what your getting into and weigh out to yourself if you think it's worth it.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

My steak came out VERY over cooked.  Our second round of drinks took 45 minutes.  It was just a complete mess.The staff was completely new for the Rooftop, as I would expect.  Except, they needed much more training before opening up.  They should've mixed in some of the fantastic and skilled downstairs staff to help out until all of the kinks were worked out.They did buy us 2 or 3 rounds of shots and a round of drinks and after my steak came out over cooked, they ended up comping almost the entire bill.  (They charged us only for 1 round of drinks.)  We were given business cards of the manager and hostess and asked to contact them directly before making our next Rooftop reservation.I will give this place a second try but for brunch, not dinner.  I'll stick to downstairs for my usual favorites.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

I was really excited to come celebrate my good friend's birthday and also try out one of her favorite restaurants.I saw the usual key elements of a restaurant in MPD here: beautiful space, dj booth spinning mood setting music. ample areas to order drinks, trendy/ stylish restaurant goers which look like they strolled off the pages of a Bergdorf Goodman catalog... which are all good in my book for the complete MPD dining experience! My huge reason for not giving STK a higher rating is that I was about 10 minutes late for the reservation, regardless, we had a reservation for 9:30pm. Most restaurants have that 10-15 mins grace period, even if it a higher volume restaurant. No tables cleared up until past 10pm... What's the point of the reservation if we can't be seated around the time of our intended slot? Anyway, on a better note- we had a great waiter, he was attentive and made great selections to order. He also kept the drinks going and made sure my friend got a birthday cake at the end of our meal- you're awesome! I really think the service here is amazing, especially with how crowded it gets at STK. For dinner, I had a skirt steak with the foie gras butter, but when it came out it was slightly cooler than I would prefer for a steak. We ordered some sides for the table, my favorites were the truffle fries (also on the smaller side) and the creme of spinach. Throughout dinner, the dj played fun music and sometimes restauranters even got up and started singing/ dancing to the music which was really fun! Overall, STK has some great elements, I just don't think for the price we paid or how long we had to wait to be seated that it was completely money well spent. I'd like to come on a less busy night.

STK is NOT old school - it had a ""clubby"" ""hip"" ""see and be seen"" vibe but I loved it. And I loved the fact that there were actually more men than women...Everything I ate was fantastic. My friends and I called the bread ""heaven in a pot"" because it was heaven in a pot. SO good. I had the tuna tartare appetizer and it was fresh, delicious and a decent sized serving.  I shared the 24 ounce Porterhouse steak medium rare and it was incredibly tender, perfectly prepared and juicy. Although I ordered the horseradish sauce, I didn't even need it because the steak was perfect. The serving was gynormous and although I tried really hard to eat my entire half, I didn't succeed. For the table, we shared the asparagus, creamed spinach, prmesan truffle Fries and mac and cheese for sides. All four were amazing.  Then for the piece de resistance, the waiter brought out six mini ice cream cones for dessert. Although we didn't order them, I am guessing they came with the deal my friend had bought.  Finally, the waiter also comped us an extra glass of champagne. It was pouring out and my friends and I joked that we might have to stay all night to avoid getting drenched or struck by lightening. Truth be told, between the crowd, the food and the friendly staff, I would spend time at STK even on the sunniest of days.  If not for the fact that my bank account just isn't big enough...the place is costly even with the deal we had ordered.

The service on a slow Sunday was fast and the food was all as requested.  The hostess looked like crap and should be told not to wear her Sunday night couch clothes to work.   She couldn't find our reservation and made it sound like she was going us a huge favour by finding us a table when they were half empty.  The bone in rib steak was one of the best I have ever had.  The sides were delish, but avoid the tuna tartar.  It comes in some sort of sauce that was over powering and tastes of strong liquor.   Over all it was nice.  But I prefer the staff and atmosphere at Vegas, Miami and mid town locations.   I will be back to see this rooftop patio, but in the winter stick to midtown.Return visit.  Sooooooo talk about night and day. STK upped their game substantially and earned another star.  Adding A5 wagyu to the menu made a huge difference.  The staff were awesome, except the rude host.  Hey always make it seem like they are making room for you, even when you had a reservation for weeks.

If you know me, you would know that my second favorite dessert of all time is Strawberry Rhubarb Crisp. So you can only imagine my delight for the martini. The rim wasn't salted, it was graham crackered!! F*ck yeah!! It was a dessert and drink all in one--just what I like. Still waiting for someone to invent the Sticky Toffee Pudding Martini. The dildos on the wall did uber-creep me out (although come to think of it, maybe they were going for the elephant tusk look--well, that's kinda creepy too), but overall, the place was great. Not too pretentious a place and a nice diverse crowd. Seemed to be older, but I can never tell how old white people are (no offense!).

396,EadtBkWuYMLPA0krnJ9NRA,Diana M.,3.0 star rating,"While I'm don't often find myself dining in the meatpacking district, I do find myself at high-end restaurants due to work quite a bit. Given the high prices on drinks ($15+ for cocktails) and food ($20 appetizers and an average of mid-$30+ for entrees), one should expect high quality in both service and product. And, that is what you get. FOOD:Price aside, as I am usually not the one paying, the food was top notch. We started with the oysters and the hamachi crudo. The oysters were fresh (we had both east and west coast oysters), and the hamachi was dressed ever so slightly and absolutely delicious. Next up was the foie gras. While the foie itself was cook just right (a little pink in the center), the ""french toast"" underneath was a bit too soggy and too sweet. I prefer to have foie with a bit of toasted bread to contrast the soft texture - soft on soft was a bit too creamy for my liking. We also had the waygu burgers which were good, nothing out of this world but very solidly done. As they're known for their steak, we ordered a few and they were a perfect medium rare and left alone to let the quality of the meat shine.We also ordered the flour-less chocolate cake and the ""menage a trois"" (carmel corn, cotton candy, and funnel cake) --- all delicious and executed well. COCKTAILS:Most of the items on the cocktail menu, particularly the rooftop cocktails, were sugar ridden to mask the taste of the alcohol. If you love fruity drinks that tend to be on the sweet side, then STK and STK Rooftop should be high on your list of cocktail bars. Not really for me. Meanwhile, their bartenders are competent  enough and can make your desired drink on command. They also have great wines and champagne on the menu - just expect to pay $$$ for it.ATMOSPHERE:The decor is pretty sleek and sophisticated. It's not garish like some restaurants of its size tend to be (see: Tao). It's a big finance hang out so it is always filled with bankers, women that want to marry them, and bridge and tunnel 40y/o cougars looking for their next prey. If you come on the early side, you may catch some families dining here... but after 7:30 or so the crowd for pre-party drinks trickle in and the volume increases significantly.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

The line was for the rooftop bar rather than the restaurant - there should be two lines really rather than making people wait outside while the security staff card people for the roof top bar. I certainly do not appreciate waiting outside in the 90F+ heat of a New York summer to go into a restaurant.From the decor the place is clearly attempting to be upmarket and coupled with the security staff on the door it gives the place a very pretentious feel. It could also double as a set for a medium budget adult film.  Our waiter was perfectly pleasant if not a little vacuous, he was clearly hoping to be destined for the silver screen. Oddly, no bread was provided as is the norm in steak places.I opted to start with the Tuna Tartar which was totally overpowered by a soy sauce mix that was poured in at the table by a waiter. It felt a little gimmicky.For a steak place they have a poor selection of steaks and sizes which surprised me. I had the 10oz fillet mignon with the STK Bold sauce which tasted like A1 with a bit of spice thrown in. We ordered a number of overpriced sides at $12 a pop - the mac and cheese, twice baked potato and the wild mushrooms. All were pretty unremarkable especially the baked potato which was ruined by a particularly nasty runny bland cheese that what was daubed all over the potato. The mac and cheese could have easily come out of a packet.Their tagline is ""Atmosphere. Temptation. Steak"" - it's clear that steak is actually way down their list of things the place stands for.

I was disappointed when the host ATTEMPTED to seat us right in front of the kitchen area. We refused the table and waited for something near the views. The smoke and food smells where so strong you walk out of there as if you where cooking your own meal. I would seriously reconsider the layout.

But we stayed and enjoyed the view and general atmosphere of the place. I ordered the octopus, which was very good and lean, but nothing like the waiter described. C ordered the eggs benedict, but asked for lox instead of the canadian bacon, for which they upcharged us $6. I have to say, those eggs were cooked perfectly, and the bun/toast they sat on soaked them up great. But, the potatoes came out with red peppers, which C is allergic to, so we asked if they could replace them with regular home fries - he took the plate away, and then returned it with no potatoes, and apologized that they couldn't do that as they are pre-mixed (are they really?). I was a little annoyed as I would have eaten them. Anyways, we also ordered the watermelon and heirloom tomato salad to split - I am glad it was to split. I can't believe that they have this on the menu as an entree - it was two small pieces of watermelon with a little tomato wedge on it and some goat cheese. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but if I had ordered it as my only entree I would have been pissed. Overall, I was surprised by the quality of the food for such a lounge.

They failed to mention that there was going to be a limited menu which I blame on STK/Gilt. Here's my recap:The Good:Bread- OMG the bread. They served these hot, salted, garlic rolls with the best basil oil I've tasted. Highlight of the meal.Steak- It was cooked pretty close to perfect which is not always the case at some steakhouses.Scallops- Pretty tasty appetizer for being on their low cost voucher menu.The Bad:Drink prices- I'm pretty desensitized to the cost of alcohol at restaurants in NYC, but $17 dollars for your cheapest glass of wine is absurd.Seating- We were placed at the smallest table (looked like it was meant for bottle service) next to a bar, and nearly all the other tables around us were overflowing with people squeezed in. Not the most comfortable or visually appealing atmosphere.Tuna Tartar- The tuna could have been served much colder- it was room temp.Menu- I really hate limited menus unless I know what I'm getting into. Offering one dessert option is pretty pathetic.The Ugly:The service: You are not winning me over with attitude and treating me like a second class customer because I have GiltCity voucher. We still spent over $200 for a dinner for 2. Also, I am pretty sure I am the type of customer you would want in your restaurant not the euro/tourist following they have going on.Cold food: Our grilled asparagus and mac and cheese (which came in a cast iron dish) was cold. I don't know how something in a cast iron dish could be served cold.It's too bad we had such a bad experience because I would have liked to try some of the other things on their regular menu.

Although I despise the Meatpacking District of NYC, I was impressed at the ambiance, crowd and staff at STK. We had to wait to be seated, but we were a large group of 10. Our waiter, who looked like a cute Latin version of Justin Long, was the nicest, most patient and attentive waiter. We had a group of girls who requested very specific instructions for their meals and boys who were downing their drinks like water, yet no one waited too long nor had to complain about anything. The place is very dimly lit and pretty loud so it makes it difficult to find the lip gloss you drop on the floor or listen to friends on the other side of the table. Didn't matter to me though. I was eating delicious steak, fantastic music, people dancing in their booths all over the restaurant, everyone in a great mood, and then  a surprise birthday cake for me and my friend.

Its a fun place to go with a large group of people. We got comped several appetizers by the chef, which was a nice touch. The service was excellent. Our server was attentive and helpful the entire meal. The DJ played an array of different genres during dinner service. The drinks are pricey, but you are paying Meatpacking prices, so be realistic about where you are and how much you are spending.

The reservation got screwed up and my 2 friends and I got there early before the rest of the party arrived so the hostess told us to wait by the bar. My friend ordered a diet coke and the rest of us water and the bartender proceeded to mock and ridicule us for not ordering alcohol. Sorry if I didn't want to have alcohol as the first thing in the morning after a bachelorette night out! They then gave us some free shots and essentially forced us to have their alcohol (i know, it's free, but we didn't want it after they berated us) . After the rest of the party arrived, we were getting seated and realized one of the benches was broken. As in, if you sit on it, the bench is going to collapse. Instead of apologizing for this, the hostess wanted to try and fix it (even thought it's clearly not fixable) and then gave us an attitude like ""ugh, why did you break this!?"" They swapped it out and one of the waiters goes ""try not to break this one too"". The food wasn't great. I ordered the chorizo benedict. The chorizo was dry and hard. Not enough hollandaise sauce and the skillet potatoes were average.

Came here with  a group and we got to sit at a round table which was perfect. The meal started off with complimentary bread that came with an herb aioli. This was a decent start. There were six of us and we shared the shellfish platter for four. There was tuna, crab claws, and shrimp that were all fresh and tasty. I sampled my boyfriends pumpkin soup that had shavings of truffle on it and it was delish. For entree, I had the wild striped bass which was my least favorite part of the meal. It smelled fishy and tasted fishy. I ate half and thankfully did not get sick. It came with cabbage that had truffle on it so that made up for the smelly fish. Some side dishes that I sampled were the creamed spinach, truffle parmesan fries and mac and cheese. All of these sides were good except I wish the fries were crispier. For dessert, we shared two orders of the ice cream mini cones and the birthday cake. The birthday cake was the star. It was so whimsical looking with a caramelized piece of sugar that had sprinkles inside and cupcake frosting on it. It also had rainbow fruit loop looking pieces on it that just made the dish really pretty.

I decided to dine with 5 friends at STK in the ""meat packing district"". I was a tad bit early for my reservation, so I sat at the bar for a few drinks. The bar tender asked me what I would like to drink, I responded ""A patron margarita on the rock's"" He made the drink, which actually was much too sweet for a patron margarita, but I didn't complain thinking to myself  ""the next one will be better "". He then took my credit card and closed my $17 bill without asking me would I like to start a tab, but that's okay I'll just keep pulling my card out per drink I have. I had a 30minute wait until my seating time and was looking to order at least 3 more drinks, so I didn't leave a tip on the first bill, but I will do so on the last bill for the bartenders service's. 2 minutes had passed by and I was now ready to request my next drink. I requested the same drink from the same bartender. To my surprise his answer was ""no ! I won't serve  you  another drink"". I asked him why and he said "" do you work for free ? Do you work for free?  Well I don't either"". I explained to him that I was planning to have a few more drinks and had every intension on tipping him along with my last bill, since he didn't start a tab for me, but I suddenly had a change of heart!  He then said that he doesn't care and insisted that I was done drinking, and went on to tell me"" my cologne was too strong anyway and it's giving him a headache"" . I didn't wear cologne at all. Now extremely pissed about the service I just received, I went to find a manager who was ready and willing to rectify the situation and offer me complimentary food and drinks. I declined because of the level  of dissatisfaction I had within my first 10 minutes of being there. I was just ready to leave ! I've dined at STK midtown and the drinks and food were amazing! So I thought I'd try another location. It was the wrong thing to do ! If your going to an expensive restaurant like STK and your paying $17 per drink and $100 per meal, one can argue that it's safe to say tipping a few dollars Won't effect your pockets at all !

416,s_UJ8E3pUE_d34BgnDOz4A,David K.,2.0 star rating,"Good food in one of the douchiest atmospheres one could imagine. I'm giving them an extra star over just one star because the food was actually pretty good: kale salad, octopus appetizer, candy bar dessert, all really nicely done and tasted great. Good portions too. The steaks/entrees were pretty good (I rate 6.5-7.0 out of 10 on the steak, in my experience). I've been here twice, once flying solo when I just wanted a good steak, and my most recent experience was taking my wife here on her birthday because I thought it would be a nice departure from a lot of the more traditional steakhouses we frequent.A big gripe I have with STK is with the atmosphere. We were seated in this weird little booth that kind of had us hanging out over a major walkway. It was a bit more exposed than I like to be at a restaurant. The booth was next to the bar where a group of guys were scream-talking to each other (they were trying to talk over the really shitty DJ's mix of dance music from the '90s that was playing way too loud for a food setting -- completely inappropriate). That was a bit of a bad start to the meal. But they eventually got seated and we got a brief break from the screaming people -- until the end of our meal when this chick with a voice that can only be described as some type of weapon showed up. She was scream-talking so loud while standing behind me (facing the back of my head, about 6' away from me) that when I tried to speak, loudly I might add, the horrible noise from her voice would just eviscerate the sound coming from my mouth. It was incredible, and it gave me digestion issues. This place needs to decide whether it's a singles club or a restaurant. If it's a singles club, it was a total sausage fest, and the women that were there (about 20% of the room) were pretty mediocre, and highly annoying (if the stentorian female at the bar was any indicator). And if it's a restaurant, eating while there is a deafening din surrounding you (be it from DJs or people scream-talking over a DJ) is the worst thing I can imagine.Further, they should get rid of the bathroom attendant. Having one is creepy and annoying. And this place is too expensive to have someone fawning for a dollar or two in the bathroom. Finally, the service was _good_ I found it neither exceptional or poor. I generally always give 20% unless something stupendous happens, or they comp me something they didn't have to, etc. 20% might seem parsimonious by some people's standards, and maybe it is. I don't think it's terrible, and lots of people I ask seem to think it's above the national average. Anyway, when I was walking out, our server, Shauna, gave me a dirty look when we passed each other in the walk way. I hope I read her wrong and maybe she was just farting discreetly and wasn't paying attention to me or something. But the timing -- and the weird, wry smirk on her face --seemed to point to her being disappointed in the $50. I left on a $225. bill. That really left a bad taste in my mouth when I was leaving -- and motivated me to write this review. I'll never go back or recommend this place to anyone.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

If you have ever described yourself as a foodie there are at least 6 other steakhouses in the general area that you should visit first. The STK steak experience varied dramatically by cut, something the should not happen at a specialty steakhouse. The skirt steak and bone in rib eye were exquisite while the bone in filet and loin strip were sub-par. Actually the loin strip was nearly impossible to eat.  The sides and apps were top notch but not good enough to make up for the disappointing entrees.  All in all, if you are in it for the trendy atmosphere and  scene seeking crowd you will be impressed enough to take a selfie and alert your network of your where-a-bouts.

I ordered the skirt steak well done with the parm truffle fries (yay they are gluten free). The fries met and exceed all my expectations. The steak was meh. I say this because I hate pink meat. It just freaks me out even if it is supposed to be that way - and my 'well done' steak was thoroughly pink.

I thought this was going to be one of those places that served you super small portions as everyone around me seemed to be stick thin and frail... skinny girls skinny food? but no it was all portioned generously and we all left food on our plate not because it wasn't delicious but because we were just too stuffed.

Simple.When the meals arrived there were potato chips served with our burgers PLUS a full green  salad and truffle fries and our friend's caesar came with an entire lobster tail in the shell. Typically when you order a burger and ask for a side salad or side of fries that means that the chips go away and are replaced with a little side or fries or salad for, whatever, $4-6.  Likewise with Caesar- typically $10-15 for a little lump lobster.""Great...."",  I'm thinking,  ""we just got charged a crapload for a bunch of extra food we didn't want...""Was I correct?  YES!  We received the bill and were charged full price for salad and fries and $33.00 for the lobster (in addition to the $13 salad)...  in the end it wasn;t a big deal- we paid maybe $30 more than we should have. Price isn;t the point- it's the principal...I worked in casual and fine dining all over the country and I GET IT.  If you're going to upsell, suggestive sell, whatever,  then tell the patrons what they're getting and what they're being charged. It's simple.  It's called communication.  That way expectations are managed formt he start.When the check arrived I mentioned to the  waitress that she should really let customers know when she's upcharging so that they don't feel screwed when the bill arrives.  She apologized profusely but, what I wish I said and am saying now is: ""Don't apologize after the fact- do your job correctly so you don't have to apologize.  COMMUNICATE AND HELP YOUR CUSTOMERS TO ENJOY THEIR MEALS!""I suspect the servers are trained to upsell becasue the management/owners are in it for the money and not to provide customer service.  That's sad.  Plently of great restaurants in NYC.  When i sit down at your establishement don't find ways to F*** me in the piehole -  think of ways to help me enjoy our experience so we return.We tipped her 18% instead of 20%- she still has to make a living.  Hopefully a manager will read this and re-think his training techniques.

452,4FcDZb3wietEsaQ9krMPJA,Eddie H.,4.0 star rating,"The Rooftop at STK is great. I can't believe I haven't been there sooner. When I think of NYC rooftop bars, this is this first place that comes to mind. The ViewI wouldn't say this place has the best views (the rooftop is on the 4th floor) but it definitely has a great vibe to it. The CrowdsThe crowds are good looking, mature professionals for the most part. Other rooftops usually draw troublemakers, rowdy/obnoxious young males and females which totally kill the vibe; I have yet to see that here. Whatever management is doing to keep these folks out, keep it up.The FoodI've been both for drinks and also brunch but I would have to give a nod for drinks here. The service for brunch was terrible last time I went (hostess was MIA for a good 20 minutes; not even the other hostesses could explain here whereabouts). I had to cancel my orders because I did not want to wait anymore. Nonetheless, I am not going to let one bad apple ruin the view of this place. I would recommend reservations for brunch and I would also confirm again just to make sure they get your name and time right ; ) Food on the rooftop is more of an ambiance thing; if you want better service, eat downstairs.The DrinksAs for drinks, the prices are fair even by NYC rooftop bar standards (I haven't checked, but it seems quite possible to order drinks from downstairs and bring them up when the lines upstairs are long, but don't quote me). I highly recommend coming here after work right around sunset for some magnificent views of the sun hitting the river out in the distance - can't beat it.If you segment the reviews by food vs. drinks, you will see most of the poor review specifically mention the service for food / quality of the food.

You would think that your appetizers are coming out after that too, but no.-Pass on the grilled octopus, was not even grilled or tender. Don't even bother trying it. Woof.-The tuna tartare was not bad. The dish overall was fair.-STEAKS; there was three of us and all the orders they got wrong. A steak that was ordered well done came out bloody, real red. I mean the thing was still moo-ing. They took them back and took care of it but the orders were not complicated and it took a while for the food to come back out. (If you're ordering a steak you have to get the truffle butter) The steaks are below average. If you want a real steak go to Del Frisco's or Peter Lugers, delicious.ProsThe lil' burger were delicious, must get.The mac and cheese and lobster mac and cheese were amazing.The drinks were stiff but totally bearable and enjoyable. So good.I asked for a table with a view, and they gave me the smallest table with no view. (Made the reservation over a month ago) Save you're money, or take your business down to Dos Caminos which is a 3 minute walk away.

STK for your price you need to invest in a new chef, the one you have cooks like an amateur. His has no palate, seems like all of your food is cooked by some one with no understanding of spices or portion control. We ordered some appetizers they we're actually ok, extremely small portions. I ordered Tuna Tarter, it was ok a little too much Ponzu Sauce and the chips have no flavor, need salt. Suggestion: mix the tuna with the sauce before finishing the dish. Would round out the flavor.  For entrees what ever you do stay away from the Beef Short Ribs, it looks good on the plate but taste like cardboard? Very, very dry,  disgusting and I would be embarrassed if I was you Chef Humberto Leon to serve that filth and charge $45, really.   I ordered the lamb, it was cooked ok but the sauce that was used on the veggies was cold and thick, it did not go with the lamb and then they paired some meat sauce on top, sauce over sauce. Disgusting.The sides.Parmesan truffle fries, really, the truffle oil that was used tasted artificial. The amount of Parmesan was overwhelming and the fries were very Mushy.Creamed Spinach, what can I say, it was unpalatable, thick cream, pure salt, with a side taste of raw oysters. OMFG what a horrid dish, thank got it came on a micro plate, so there was not a lot of it. But still cost $12 Chef do you taste what you serve, because I don't think you do, or you must be drunk if you think it's ok to serve what you do. Mashed potatoes was probably the most palatable dish but or still had a strong taste of cream.Service.The waiter mixed up our dishes brought a different dish. Then we saw that they charged us an extra $ 45 for it.  We paid with a split of cash and credit card. We told him to split it 50/50, easy right. We get back the credit card receipt and the waiter took the cash and charged the full bill on the card. Management needs to test the waiters on basic math principal, because they seem to lack them or just don't care.  They seem to hire their waiters base on appearance and them being in the right demographic. Good points.The music was cool, made it easier to deal with the horrid service.Decor very cool.I don't think I will comeback unless my wife makes me.They are attracting customers because of location, they would not last if they had to compete only on food. The reasoning is simple, they will charge these outrages prices and not change a thing as long as we continue to be ok with paying them and continue to be sheep and go with the crowd.

          Simply put... 
                                 ...unreal.

For those of you foodies out there always looking for a posh/sumptuous place to dine out, you'll enjoy being infatuated by the menu selections and romanced by the rich inviting interior that will leave you equally as speechless.

I was fortunate enough dine several times at this SOON TO BE -NEW HOT SPOT, and can honestly say that you will be impressed. 

Walking into the restaurant I was delighted by earthy tones and modern architecture which left the space open, functional, and pleasing to the eye.

The 2nd & 3rd floors make home to a variety of private dining rooms -rich with streaming media content capabilities, and custom music selection there is nothing like this available in this part of town!  These private dining rooms are sure to book up fast for events and with the Holidays just around the corner STK couldn't have had better timing!  20-500 people your choice!

Even more impressive than the private dining rooms will be the ROOF TOP BAR that spans the entire length of the building. Lounge, drink, spend time with friends and enjoy the water view from this beautiful location.  

    THE MEAL
    - After having a late lunch and coming in take a look around I considered coming back another time to try the food at STK as I was quite content from before.  However... Romanced by my glass of  remarkable Cabernet and a heavenly bite of STK's Skirt Steak (out of this world) I was quickly convinced that this was not something to simply pass by.

      I decided to indulge.

With A LOT MORE THAN JUST STEAK ON THE MENU  it was a tough choice all around but the bartenders quickly provided assistance in selecting some of their favorite dishes to try.

    MY APPETIZER SELECTIONS
    - Roasted Beets, with Coriander, Micromint, Yogurt, and Curry
    - Fruit Salad with Rosemary, Black Pepper, and Virgin Olive Oil.
    - Meat and Potato Soup, with Braised Beef, Potatoes and Roasted Onion.
    - The Bartender Poured a Taste of their House Chardonnay to accompany the selections above. Impressive for a ""wine by the glass,"" and quite compatible with the appetizers - a good choice.

     The Beets were delicious (I'm a fan, this you know if you have read my previous reviews), very simple and delicate.  Beautiful and not too rich in flavor.
 
     The Fruit Salad *is a must try! If you're venturing down here YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS THIS DISH. Surprisingly not too sweet, who would have thought combining rosemary and olive oil with fruit would be that incredible?? I have never had anything like it in this city before! Truly amazing. Bravo STK.

  I really did not think that the fruit salad could be topped - but like Verruca, in Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory, I for the first time experienced something so light and not filling but SO unbelievably full of flavor that my eyes nearly rolled back in my head! I was shocked!  VERY UNIQUE! This will make you want to come back for more.

    Imagine if you will a cappuccino with foam on top, substitute the coffee with a delicious braised beef soup and substitute the foam with potato foam - do not stir the layers, and scoop some of both onto your spoon. You will be amazed too! ANOTHER DO NOT MISS APPETIZER on one amazing menu. 

   The portion sizes of the appetizers were VERY generous but left plenty of room for both drinks and ordering a main course.

   MY MAIN COURSE SELECTION
    - The Duck Breast with Fennel, Shallot Ginger Confit, Belgium Endive (prepared: Chef's Choice)
    - Bartender selected the house Shiraz and the Zin

   Far from ""Gamy"" the Duck was PERFECT! Succulent, sweet, and quite filling - I could not have been happier with this selection.  The wines both complimented the Duck extremely well, though the Shiraz was a little more Tannic, your preference.
       
Date Rating: OFF THE CHARTS!!! 10++
Pick up Scale: Definitely going to be a 10!


Strong Suggestions: Make a reservation in advance and go with a group so you will be able to try as many dishes as possible. REALLY AMAZING MENU and VERY TALENTED CHEF! THIS IS A PLACE YOU CAN TAKE A DATE, CLIENTS, FAMILY, FRIENDS or just about anyone and THEY WILL BE IMPRESSED!

If you have food allergies make sure you tell your waiter.  The Skirt Steak Sauce has Shellfish in it. The Chef will adjust the menu to accommodate your needs (even if you are vegetarian).




UPDATE 9/30/06 

Went back to STK last night with a party of 9 and had almost everything on the menu.  IT WAS UNREAL AGAIN! 

Was able to try all of their SIDES - the CREAMED CORN & ASPARAGUS were completely untouchable! The Mashed Potatoes & The STK version of French Fries were also amazing.

This service, food, and atmosphere was HORRIBLE. The DJ was a disgrace. As a DJ my self, this guy was literally a bro wit a laptop and he was letting his friends take turns ruining my dinner. Then we order, the waiter didn't come back for at least 20 minutes. At this point, he tells me he is out of the bone in rib steak and the del monico steak is equivalent and just as good. That was obviously a lie because I am a big steakhouse guy and I know the difference between steaks. The steak was all fat and no meat. Then he forgets my sides and by the time he comes back with them we are done with our steaks. Then to top it all off, 2 women sit next to us and think who the hell they are. The head chef comes out and tells them he's gonna cook them a special dish and don't worry about it. He says this in front of every one. What's so special about these 2 girls? Why aren't I special? Why didn't the chef come out and greet me? Even the couple next to us was baffled by this. They also waited 30 mins for 2 overpriced cheeseburgers. This place was literally a joke, and I will never EVER go back to ANY of their establishments or associated ones. Also the prices are INSANE. You can go to BLT or Del Frisco's for better quality meal and it's a little bit cheaper. You are basically paying for the ""view"" which is blocked by umbrella's most of the time. The only good thing about this place was the drinks. That's about it. That's the only reason why it gets 1 star. I wish I can give no stars.

The meat was done perfectly, tasted perfectly, the sauces were excellent, I really have nothing to comment about how to improve on that. Yum. We had the fillet and the bone-in rib stk. The au poivre sauce, though not so traditionally made,  was excellent. The service was great - our waitress, Karina, was great and made it an excellent experience including some small-talk we had with her and her assistance with our menu selections. The ambiance is excellent - not too bright, not too dim, excellent music (DJ DUB-L), very pleasant. The appetizers - they were a bit disappointing. I'd say that if the appetizers were better and the price a bit lower it would have been a five stars, and a strong five stars. But as is, it is a strong four starts, and a place we'll be happy to go back to once our bank account will get some breathing time....go if you can spare the cash, it is expensive, but the steaks are perfectly worth it in an excellent environment and excellent service (thank you Karina).",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

I had been here multiple times to have a cocktail or go to the roof, but this was my first dining experience with STK.  We started with the scallops and moved onto the steak with truffle butter. I have to say the steak was cooked to perfection. I tend to prefer a warm red center, which to STK is considered rare (many other places this is med rare). I think that is important to note. The truffle butter and mushrooms and spinach sides were also very good. Not to forget, if you are doing the STK thing you might as well have some wine, and they have quite the extensive list.

We also had the Brussels sprouts & they had a tangy sesame gingery sauce that did wonders to the entire meal !

On a good note, the decor is chic and trendy.  The staff was certainly very good looking.  HOWEVER, most of the crowd that ate there looked like they were bridge and tunnel people.  It was definitely not my scene even if it is in the meatpacking district.  Not my type of place, and I'm sorry we went there.  I wasted 4 hours at a restaurant that first starved me, then filled me up with second-rate steaks, all while charging me over $150 for it.  No thank you...ever.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

I find that this place is more about the hype then elegance. Came here on a Saturday night with reservations for 2 people at 8pm (which had to be made a month in advance), my boyfriend called the hostess to tell her we were running a few minutes behind. She gave the typical answer ""we can only hold your table for 15 mins"" which left a sour taste with me. After rushing to get there, my mood became even more sour when the hostess said, your table will be ready shortly would you like to have a drink at the bar? LIKE REALLY!? You just told us 10 minutes ago you couldn't hold our table but now its not even ready? Onto the actual place, on a Saturday night (and many other nights I'm sure) this place was filled with rowdy douche bags. I go to steakhouses for a nice, elegant dinner, but this place was filled with a bunch of people acting like they were in college and were given their rich friends' dad's credit card for the evening. Grown men and women screaming at the dinner table acting like they were at a college frat house. The service, well, I felt it was no different then going to a TGI.Fridays. Nothing special, the waiter knew the menu but didn't feel overly welcomed. Also, when ordering our appetizers he said, ""I don't want to rush you, but I need to put the whole order in at the same time"". Again, like really?! Do not rush me. Another thing that ticked me off was we had to ask for the waiter to bring the bread AFTER the appetizers came out. The food itself was better than I thought it was going to be. 10oz fillet was cooked very well and tasted delicious. I had the fries which were good but what really wowed me were the Haricots Verde...sautéed to perfection...so delicious! Another thing that was absolutely to die for was the chocolate brownie dessert (might be better than Tao fortune cookie). So rich and chocolately, I would probably go back to STK  for that dessert alone.

This October in NYC has been warm so my friend & I wanted to enjoy the weather as long as it stuck around. I had the tuna tartare app, which comes with avocado and taro chips surrounded by a seasoned soy sauce. It's their most popular app. My drink of choice was their signature ""Summer Fling"", which was a mixed drink that included some of my favs like St. Germaine and Rose. For dinner I enjoyed the filet mignon and mac & cheese side. The mac and cheese side is to die for; it can be shared, because it is a hefty portion. The fliet mignon was so succulent and well seasoned. We were too stuffed for desserts. The rooftop offered amazing views! The entrance is unnoticeable, unless you know that your destination is STK in particular. It reminds me of an entrance to an old school loft/nightclub. The restaurant is in the vicinity of Diane Von Frustenberg, The Sugar Factory and the Standard Hotel if that helps in visualizing the neighborhood. Our waiter was so kind! I forgot his name but he was medium height and blonde. Also, the bread they serve before the meal is outta sight! You have to eat at STK Downtown.

510,DJLtG3oRWGHVGTu5O39vqg,Neil R.,3.0 star rating,"Overall, I found this to be a pretty average steakhouse - although the service was excellent which does elevate the rating/experience.  There were four of us and we ordered the Cowboy Rib Steak and Beef Short Rib to share amongst us.  They were  decent but pretty much average in relation to the many other steakhouses I've been to in the past.  The sauces provided were OK.  They also provide complimentary bread - its warm and soft, and was pretty good as was the mint sauce it came with.  The steaks were priced in range with other high quality steakhouses, but I would say there are likely better options for these prices.  In terms of sides, we had Mac and Cheese, Brussels Sprouts, Creamed Spinach and Wild Mushrooms.  The Mac and Cheese was pretty good - probably the best of all these items.  But as for the others, I did not  find them above average - especially  Brussels Sprouts, which I was really hoping would be better. The drinks were not too bad - as you would expect, they are little pricey but they are pretty good.  The atmosphere is very trendy, ritzy and quite spacious.  Its definitely a fun experience but for the price and food quality, I feel like there may be better options to explore.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

I came here with a couple of friends for a birthday celebration. We were seated at a table for dinner after waiting by the lounge area which was fine. Since it was a late dinner (around 9:30PM), I didn't not feel like eating too much so I didn't want to order a large entree. This is when the highlight of my night occurred. The waiter was disgusting and got in my face because I wanted to order an appetizer. He said that since it was a dinner reservation, we should order AT LEAST an entree. Meanwhile the table next to us were a group of 5 men that only ordered drinks and I didn't see him screaming in their faces and getting nasty for not ordering large quantities of food. My other friends did order entrees and drinks so I don't understand why he was so rude and condescending. There is no where on the menu where it states a minimum order and there's no reason for a staff member to act disgusting and mutter things under his breath. Food was overrated and mediocre.

The first time, the food was good, but my organic chicken was chewy, the music was booming and people were in the middle dancing - a huge crowd not an embarrassingly one or two people.  Tops 40s music, a Dj I believe. I came back again because my London Town cousin paid me a visit and wanted to go to the meat packing district and STK was open late for food. Drinks were good, my steak was salty, Mac and cheese was good, a little overpriced but expected. Blah. The hostess' were very rude to the point that I quickly snapped back at them. They had a snotty attitude and I got the vibe that they didn't think we could afford to be there. When asking if we could actually be seated on the rooftop they said ""that's a different restaurant and you need a reservation"" with an attitude. Umm, it's called STK ROOFTOP, just take me and my $800 shoes to my table bitch. My cousin, was shocked at their attitude and it left her very sullen for the entire meal but we ate up, drank, received sub-par service and still left 20%.

Why would you have someone at the front door letting foreigners in on a Saturday night if you know this person won't be allowed to buy a drink??? You suppose to get people in and let them spend their money, right? Or your management is working some other way?? (good luck with that). 2.

Beautiful roof top and decent happy hour scene especially if you enjoy the grown and sexy scene.  On June 23rd my bf and I decided to check out the place since I was looking for space to do an event for our firm. The bar was full so we sat on table 223 to grab drinks and dinner. Our waiter Ryan seemed a little annoyed and a bit stressed out.  We wanted to order appetizers and drinks before we order dinner but Ryan quickly let us knows that will not make the chef happy and we must order everything at once.  I was in the service industry in college so I understood  Ryan's concern so we had to order a bunch of food at once(However, we are  not here to please the chef, if I want to get my appetizers and dinner all at once then I can just walk down to PJ. Clarke's and save myself couple of zero's on my bill). Appetizers were great, I recommend the Tuna Tartar. Steak was over cooked this time but I will have to admit, I have been to this place multiple times and they usually do a decent job on a steak. After dessert, I went down stairs to check out their event space , while my bf was waiting at the table, right after that I came back to grab my belongings and started to head out, leaving my expensive pair of sun glasses inside its case on the table. Waiter and his support team started cleaning the table right as we were walking out. No table was seated near us to let me assume someone grabbed it. Non-of the staff flagged me as I was waiting for the elevator. I was traveling the next day so I couldn't make it back to STK to ask for my pair of glasses but I called every single day for 6 days and sometimes two three times a day. I left over 10 messages with the receptionist Michelle and few others.  I couldn't get a single manager on the phone.  People on the phone have absolutely no respect and I couldn't get a single manager to give me a call back despite the receptionists promising to pass the message along to at least acknowledge that they weren't able to track my glasses. I was also interested in booking their small ball room down stairs and I have yet to get a call or an email back. For such a large and reputable establishment as ""STK"" their service is extremely disappointing. Let's just say they will never get my personal or my firm's business. If they want to charge a pretty penny for their food and service they need to provide one. I will give 3 stars for their food and 1 star for their service.  There are plenty of Michelin star awarded restaurants in NYC with implacable service and food.

It seemed like the it was the waitresses first time ever taking an order. After we finally got the order in, we waited a while until the food arrived. Of the 6 steaks that we ordered, only 4 arrived at the table. The waitress then proceeded to explain to us how she doesn't know what happened but she tripled checked the order 3 times before submitting and she's so confused how this happened. To compensate the 2 of us who didnt have our food, they brought over a platter of chips - which were awful. After 15-20 minutes, the steaks finally arrived. The food was fine, nothing special, but the service was just bad. Drinks were also pretty terrible.

I had the 10 oz filet and added the blue butter sauce, and the sweet corn pudding was TO DIE FOR. Also a nice touch - the bread & spread you get pre-meal was among the best I've had.

Ok great, we'll have a seat over by the bar and await our table. 20 mins passed rather quickly, no table no follow up, another 15 minutes passes and with 3 separate groups being seated and not us.  Finally my Father goes back to enquire about our table to be told a few minutes.  Another 15 mins passes and again he is told a few more minutes.  Now after waiting an hour I approach them and asked about our table since my father had been here twice and was told ""the table I was going to give you they aren't finished paying yet, when they're finished then we can seat you.""  I was shocked by such a response, on my way back to the bar area, to tell my father and brother, I stopped a young lady to ask to speak to a manager and low and behold she was one! As I began speaking to her, to our surprise our table was magically ready! (insert sarcastic face) It is ashame that is what it took to get a table! The food was delicious, the waiter was excellent and the manager continued to check on us (as well as the other patrons). My father had the Lamb, my brother had the skirt steak and I had the market fish, we also shared the sweet corn pudding (to die for!), mac and cheese, cheedar grits (loved it), broccolini and the spinach.  We had 2 appetizers, that I can't recall because the entree and sides were so great that they overshadowed anything else.  We ended the night sampling 2 desserts: the banana cream pie in a jar and the cheesecake, but being unable to finish because we were stuffed from dinner.  All in all dinner was good, but the treatment or lack there of, from the hostess put a damper on the night.  I have had great experiences at STK especially the one in midtown, but I would probably be hesitant to return to the downtown location WITHOUT a reservation.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

You walk in and the restaurant is VERY impressive and beautiful. We sat at a big table in the corner..a bit too big for our party. The only downside to our meal was the server..the sommalier was apparently on some kind of methamphetamines and could barely manage taking our order. He was very nice, but very slow and erratic. He's EXTREMELY lucky we weren't doing an eye spy review on the restaurant. Back to the food, they have the most AMAZING bread. We had plenty of appetizers including the sliders (soooo freaking good!), shrimp (way too expensive- thats a no go),  tar tar, (ok). You really don't need appetizers if you are going to order steaks and side... Its just too much!I split a 10 oz filet mignon with my friends, about $48. And I couldn't finish is after all of the sides we ordered. Spinach, mac and chesse, asparagus, mushrooms. We had it all. Luckily my friends were nice enought to split our $700 tab. The service was not good, but the food was excellent. The drinks were amazing as well. I had the best dirty martini i've ever had.We also had the most amazing Chocolate lava cake. yummmm.

586,jmehdPi3jheuKfx0hIELlQ,Kayla C.,4.0 star rating,"I came here the other night for a Holiday Soiree for one of my husband's clients and had a really great time- STK is definitely a great place to host a group gathering/dinner. The event itself was held upstairs, in the Tempest Storm Room, named after a famous burlesque star and had a loungey/dark feel which could be expected, but great for a night event. I'd say there were about thirty people at this event and STK did a great job of hosting it. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with a glass of champagne and the wait staff did a wonderful job of passing around delicious apps- my personal faves were the sliders and crab cakes. They had a great bartender serving up our drinks the entire night. The room itself is set up very well in that- the first two hours were spent standing around mingling on one side of the room enjoying drinks/apps and the other side of the room had two long tables set up for a formal sit-down dinner. Once it was time for dinner, they made sure to have multiple bottles of wine and our glasses were never left empty(thank goodness they provided us with delicious pop-over like bread while waiting for our meals to be served because they really didn't want any empty glasses of wine). For starters, we were provided the option of either the tuna tartar, hearts of romaine, or blue iceberg salad. I went with the hearts of romaine which was flavorful and had a fresh/lemony dressing. I personally wouldn't say that it was worth the price listed on their website($14) and wouldn't have gotten it had it not been free(it was typical hearts of romaine with croutons and dressing- nothing overly amazing).  One of the wives sitting next to me, had ordered the tuna tartar and said that it was delicious. For mains we were given the option of filet, chicken, and something else I can't remember. My husband had the filet- he said it was delicious, tender and cooked well(he gave it a 4/5). I went with the chicken which was moist and absolutely delicious- very flavorful with the corn/pancetta jus!! They also gave us a bunch of different sides to share that were basically the highlight of the meal as each was delicious-- sweet corn pudding, mac&cheese, creamy mashed potatoes, and  parmesan truffle fries. For dessert, we were given the option of the birthday cake or a chocolate brownie. Not going to lie, dessert fell short. My husband and I got one of each and neither were particularly good. I could have bought both desserts at my neighborhood grocery store and they would have been far better. I must admit, overall, it was a really great time. The food was very good(aside from dessert) and the drinks were all made strong. The venue itself was perfect for hosting the holiday party and I'd definitely recommend it to other people trying to hold an event. I will look forward to trying the restaurant downstairs for dinner sometime.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

The bar tender kept serving them and as they got more raucous chairs were knocked over at least three times, pants were unzipped, and very suggestive motions including one screwing the other with a strapon were performed in the center of the bar area. Since there were no other customers there everyone had a good view of this. While I love erotic anything, this in the center of a very expensive restaurant where we were entertaining senior business people from China is just plain unacceptable.

The steak was fantastic and cooked to perfection. The mushrooms were packed with amazing flavor and a perfect pairing to the steak. The fries (which were highly reccomended to me by friends prior to this dinner) were all parmesean to me, and barely a hint of truffle oil.

627,ULlOcX5apiSM8AKe0PolVQ,Me Put That Meat Inside C.,2.0 star rating,"I came here because i heard it helps people get laid. Well the place is expensive enough. It's overpriced enough to impress the hell out of any skinny skank that drags you in here. But lemme go on about why it's NOT an enjoyable place. This is a club/restaurant, where the central theme is fine dinner (steaks) in a trendy club atmosphere. Sound Douche-y enough for you homes? Getting in is kinda like getting into a club. There will be a wait, there will be a line, and it's not moving at an efficient rate. The tables here are not what you would expect in a dining establishment. These are the round sort of booth seats you expect in a midtown club playing house music....so you sit...side by side.... and eat your steak...and loook sideways at each other or stare off in front...like a trendy version of the subway. The music is played right above comfortably loud; so you have to yell at your date like ""WHEN AM I GETTIN LAID??"" The lighting is atrocious, lit up by a small tealight candle. You'll pass that solitary candle back and forth to read your menus, so hang on to that. They start you off with a cloud of soft rolls in a butter spread which is tasty. We had the 32oz. porterhouse for 2, and it was mehhh. The price was $99 so I was expecting something around that caliber, i guess. But very mehhh....We had the mac cheese and cream spinach at $11 a side, and they were really good. The spinach was real leafy spinach and they didn't chop it into a dip like they do at say, an Applebee's. The mac wasn't typical macaroni, but like a fancy-ass spaghetti-os type of pasta consisting of thin macaroni segments that coat and hold the cheese well. We opted to get the side of Foie Gras butter to dip our steak in. It tastes very buttery and less Foie Grassy which was good....sort of like a subtle truffle butter. I'm sure some people are reading this like WTF, Mate? but i'm sure if you tried the foie gras butter and I told you it was truffle butter, u wouldn't even know. In fact, if I told you it was melted parkay butter and you spread it on a bagel you still prob wouldn't know it was Foie Gras butter. That's how good this place is. They'll charge $7  for a side of butter that tastes like butter but its pronounced Foi Gras Butter. They also spell string beans as Haricot Vert. Go figure. All in all, it really is a wonderful looking well-designed place. But the food is below meehhh (especially at the prices they charge) and the seating is uncomfortable and the atmosphere loud and imposing. Some ppl on this review said it's the price you pay to be seen. Seen? by who? Does anyone give a crap that I've been here and am now writing a review on yelp? Get over yourselves, gossip girls. Also, i have to point out the staff was not as rude as it states on these reviews. Waiter was helpful, a little limp in the wrist, enjoys a lot of theater type of brother but very pleasant and not at all pretentious. There was an asian chick struggling training to be a server and she was cute and attentive. The mexican busboys were quick to fill up your water at half full without asking even tho it was swamping busy. In my book that's at least an ""above average"" for service.

629,uMXTRNIR2yoCiFa5zLCJEQ,Annabel A.,4.0 star rating,"STK has the most unusual setting for a steakhouse. The place was a little hard to find in the Meatpacking district, and true enough the place was PACKED. With the dim lights, and pumping hit-music (great soundtrack btw that makes you want to get up and dance- from jessie's girl to living on a prayer only to name a few..), it feels as if you're in a huge, spacious lounge. But this is actually a steakhouse. The food is pricey for what you'd expect in this area of NY, but it is delicious! I tried the shrimp rice krispies to start, the filet mignon au poivre, the mac and cheese and the truffle parmesan fries. The shrimp rice krispies was pretty unusual- two pieces of shrimp on a bed of rice krispies, and when you pour the lobster bisque it pops and crackles (i loved it!) The mac and cheese and truffle parmesan fries were amazing- pure comfort food. As for the filet mignon, it was good, but I think other more ""traditional"" steakhouses do their meat better. I initially thought that the service would suck, seeing as the place was so crowded and it does have a  slight snobby NY glamour feel to it. However I was surprised that our waiter was really down-to-earth very attentive. I would definitely return- especially to try dessert next time since everything on the menu sounded glorious (warm molten chocolate cake/chocolate smore/cheesecake lollipops and tres leche cake!). However, i would not recommend this if you're looking for a regular solid, conservative steakhouse.

I took a trip to NY to celebrate my birthday and ended up having dinner here on a Saturday night around 8pm.First thing you notice is this place is jumpin. Plenty of people both outside and in. Only problem is there is not enough space inside to accommodate all those people. I dont like having to fight my way to the bar so this was a problem for me. The lighting is perfect and you cant help but notice the main bar as soon as you walk in. The environment threw me off a tad. The music was bumpin, people where dressed up, and all of a sudden there's a dinning area. Now I have been to a few fancy restaurants with possibly jazz or a soft melody playing in the background, but this place turned that idea completely on its head. We were seated in the very cramped dinning area by the fireplace. I did enjoy the fireplace seeing as it isnt something that you exactly find in between a lounge and dinning area. The positioning seemed random but worked quite well to separate the people eating dinner from the people hanging out. After we sat down I ordered myself a Mojito. I usually guage a bartender off their mojitos as well as how they poor a scotch. The mojito could have used a bit more rum....but was certainly on my list of best mojitos ever. I was not impresssed by my double Macallan. The fact it was in a small glass was depressing but that should have visually made it seem like there was a decent amount of scotch in there...which there wasnt. I basically got a single shot of Macallan. The service was average. Not great, but not bad in any way. It was pretty average taking into account how packed the place was. You cant down the place for having a good business so I wont knock the service. Good guy, and you can tell he was on his toes which is all you can ask especially on a Saturday nightThe food was phenomenal. In the event that I ever have a terminal disease I want to be treated with high doses of the duck spring rolls followed by daily 32oz porterhouse regimins. We started off with the duck spring rolls and the first bite i went into the twilight zone. I looked at my brother and for a second in confusion, then he realized what I was implying . The table immediately went quite while we tried to fathom how something could taste so good. This was obviously going to be a hard act to follow. The 32oz porterhouse for 2 with a side of wild mushrooms completed my evening. Perfectly cooked steak. I wouldnt dream of being critical here seeing as this is my new benchmark for steak. Paired with the wild mushrooms, this main course sealed the deal for me. Life could have ended right then and I would have no complaints. Overall, I loved this place. You feel as if your in a night club while at the same time enjoying an amazing meal. There may be too many people at the bar and in the lounge area, and the seating may be cramped, but the food was phenomenal, the DJ was on point, and STK forever left an imprint on my heart (and stomach).

We had a drink at the bar and sat down at around 6.30. The place was empty when we got there since they open at 6 but by 7.30 PM the restaurant was packed. Very interesting crows, downtown NYC, a lot of young people who go out because they want to be noticed:) We ordered a bottle of wine some appetizers and then main course. I remember the tuna tartare being very good and the kobe beef was amazing. We also ordered the sirloin and the lobster mac and cheese and the skirtsteak. After tasting the kobe beef no steak tastes better...Everything was really good and the meats were cooked at the perfect temperature as we ordered them. The service was not really that impressive, our server was quite cocky, we asked him not to tell us the prices when he mentiones the specials but he did anyway. It's not that he was rude, i guess it's the personality and they way you present yourself. We asked for a desert wine at the end and i believe he was very busy at some point and the wine took a very long time so one of us had to actually go in the kitchen and grab our server to remind him of the wine. We also ordered a desert, i believe it was a brownie(i looked amazing, but i am not really a desert person so i did not taste it) but my friends said it was very dry and tasteless. Other than that the food was very good. I am giving this four stars because of the service...after all it is one of the most respectable steakhouses in the Meatpacking district.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

The concept sounded cool, then you saw the fugly thing and you went back for the BMW/Jag/Merc/Mustang/rent-a-car? That's how I felt about STK.Ok, first the negatives. If I'm going to a proper steak house, I expect it to be about a dining experience that is centered around the food, and not around the crowd. If this wasn't a steakhouse, it would get flying colors for a yuppie pick-up spot or after-work joint. Very trendy looking, decent atmosphere, etc. But as a steakhouse, it was a bit overwhelmingly noisy, tight-packing, such that I couldn't even have a decent conversation with my friend because of all the concurrent conversations by the goombas on my left, and the anal-retentive bride-to-be and her parents on my right with barely any elbow room. It sort of reminds me of Mercer Kitchen, but nowhere near as fun. The food got mixed reviews. I had the foie gras crackers and my buddy had the hearts of romaine salad. My dish came out ok, but they shi-shi'ed it up too much with what looked like miniature french toasts, overwhelmingly sweet honey-like sauce, such that this tiny tasty piece of foie gras felt like I had just swallowed a piece of hardened molassis dipped in melted crisco. The salad was over-done with parmesan that looked like Andre the Giant had a bad case of dandruff and flaked all over the dish. The steak? I had the 8-ounce strip loin, which was actually pretty damn good. That was the highlight of my meal. My buddy had a boned ... something... filet? He said it was very good. The creamed spinach was decent (c'mon, if u fuck that up you're complete cannon fodder). However, the recommended truffle fries I got were disgusting. They were layered miniature potato bricks that I think were the lost cousins of the liver-flavored molassis I had for appetizer. I was by no means full at the end of the meal, but was so unhappy we skipped dessert and just left.I'll never come back here for a ""steak"" experience, but I could see myself coming back for a drink at the bar, or maybe a snack with a group of friends that don't really care about food. The atmosphere, sans steak focus, is not bad for a drink and hors d'ouvres.I did enjoy the music though.

668,_Ft9WbScSu3SH-PIq8ScdQ,Danielle M.,3.0 star rating,"So I've been to NY about as many times as I have eaten at a nice steak place. My boyfriend and I were in town to Fashion Week and wanted to have a nice Pre-Valentine's day dinner. STK was a recommendation for a few people and seemed like it'd be right up our alley. We had an 8pm reservation on a Saturday night. We were running a bit late due to the lovely snow storm and slow cab so we called it was 8:05 and they alerted us they only hold reservations for 10mins so hope we get there. (I get it but really?) Anyways, we get there at probably 8:12, no problems...coat check was downstairs so we bypassed that, I was HUNGRY and annoyed by that for some reason.  The place was very nice, more club like feel which I expected. It was loud but normal. On to the food, The Lil Burgers...we decided to get Foie Gras on top...they were delicious. I would order these a million times over. We each got their Cobb Salad...it was very good and standard. For the entree I ordered a Filet Medallion and my boyfriend got the Porterhouse with Lobster on top. I thought my steak was good, it wasn't the best I've ever had but it wasn't bad by any means. I did not appreciate the whole idea of serving a sauce. I know that the sauce and topping on a steak is there thing but I feel it sort of is a mask for a good piece of meat.  I ordered the Spice  STK sauce just because, was not a fan. My boyfriend really enjoyed his steak and lobster. He ordered the Blue Butter...it was good for the lobster but too much.  For sides we ordered the brocollini and the truffle Parmesan fries.....the brocollini was very good and well cooked. The fries were dry and disappointing. DESSERT was definitely a highlight. They had a very whimsical option that had funnel cake and cotton candy. It was fun sounding but I opted for their Bread Pudding and my boyfriend got the Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup...my Bread pudding was delicious and I could eat again and again.  On to service and to why I give 3 stars. First...the waitress was OK. She never introduced herself and was very impersonal. She didn't do a terrible job by any means but she did really bother us. To begin I let her know at the beginning of the meal that we do not drink so we wouldn't be needing the drink menus etc. I absolutely can't stand when servers constantly suggest drinks we someone shows no interest. We have no intentions of stiffing you on a tip or being cheap skates just because we are not drinkers, so the way we get treated sometimes is bothersome. Later in the meal I ordered the BOURBON Bread Pudding...in which she warned me like I was an idiot that it was SOAKED in bourbon and remembered I said we didn't drink. I am not an idiot. I don't drink but things cooked/flavored with alcohol of some sort is an entirely different thing and I can obviously read. Thanks.  Then halfway through our dessert....she dropped the check. That was the icing on the cake. We were like really? We weren't even finished, she didn't ask if we wanted anything else or even say thank you.  The manager must have saw we were a bit upset because they came over and asked how everything was and we were very honest. The food was great but the service was very disappointing. He apologized and said that is now how things are done there. The waitress comes probably 5mins later and apologizes and says that dropping the check mid dessert was policy and that she ASSUMED because we said we didn't drink we didn't want anything else. Great...I guess assumptions get you far  working in customer service. I had no idea. All in all dinner was great....nothing to rave about. Service would bring this place down to a 2, but the managers on the floor were really helpful and the dessert was good.I can't say we will be back.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

684,SfUpXTZn7Tkoler7UnLTjw,Patrick D.,1.0 star rating,"Everyone deserves a second chance...and they blew it.I live two blocks away from STK and have been privileged enough to have it as my local dinner spot on average three times a month for several years.  The proper STK restaurant is fantastic and the standard stays consistently high in their Miami, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles locations as well.  However, STK Rooftop is NOT the STK restaurant that it is seated above!!!  From all accounts, STK Rooftop is a bottle service club and not just a different restaurant experience so perhaps this is why so many people are as disgruntled as I am after seemingly misunderstanding this.  This review is being written after giving Rooftop a second chance from my first lackluster experience.  It's a year later and they still don't have their act together.  Worse is the fact that the overall attitude here is that you are just another member of the endless Meatpacking District bridge and tunnel mob so not getting your return business doesn't seem to be much of an issue with these folks.  This second time around I was entertaining business friends who thought that some steak with a great view from a rooftop might be a fun night.  We arrived to the restaurant doors being roped off with a bouncer and door-woman doing nothing to wrangle the throngs of punters clogging up the entrance just standing there on their cell phones apparently calling ""someone"" that would get them inside.  We pushed through to announce our reservation and were eventually let inside to wait several minutes for the elevator only to have my guests unceremoniously shoved aside by a member of the Rooftop staff ushering in an obviously more important group of young women who were just pulled from the line.  We were told that we had to wait for the next trip.  Another several minutes goes by and we now have to walk AROUND the elevator bouncer who refuses to take a step aside from the dead center of the elevator door.  Really?  MAYBE I could see trying to swing your proverbial member at the men in the group but it was outright rude to the two 95 lbs. stilettoed women that were with us.  Once we're past the creepy gate keeper we get up to the rooftop where there's seemingly downright chaos going on.  It's lively.  There's a DJ playing mashups.  The crowds jumping.  This all looks like fun except the few identifiable staff members just seem to be one step away from panic trying to do their jobs.  We wait several more minutes to finally get a hold of a hostess who starts to grill me about having all members of my party present as if Gozar the gatekeeper would've let us up as a partial group.  She announces that she's going to get our table ready and proceeds to leave for about eight or nine minutes.  During this time we are left in the 20 sq ft elevator area putting up with douchingtons both coming and going, every one of them with a major nightclub attitude of thinking who they are.  Drunk guys rubbing up on the women in our party and all.  Just as things are getting heated we're called for our table.  The table's fine, we're directly behind the DJ's speakers so things are a little loud but all to be expected here.  There's a clear definition between the area for those who have ""dining"" reservations vs. the bottle service crowd.  Unfortunately, that line is also drawn with a gaggle of rather low umbrellas over all of the tables.  You're on a rooftop and exposed to the elements so umbrellas are a logical accessory.  Just be forewarned that unless you're having bottle service on the west side of the rooftop, all of those umbrellas completely block out any beautiful view of the Hudson River sunset.  Your view will be relegated to The Standard hotel's drapes for most of your time here.  Staff continues to be rather flustered with the exception of our waiter who happened to be charming and rather attentive.  He was a COMPLETE contrast to the rest of the staff and I wish we had seen him more often.  Food came out incomplete and either undercooked (shrimp and a steak) or severely overcooked (hamburger).  Some of it went back while some of us just dealt with it knowing what we were in for by now.  The crowd is what you would expect for a bottle service rooftop experience with a loud DJ playing ""Ice Ice Baby"".  Yes.  You read that correct.  He played ""Ice Ice Baby"" at one point and that combined with the plastic drink ware on our table should give some indication as to the clientele clawing to get up here.  As I said earlier...this is NOT the restaurant downstairs with it's great service, exceptional food, & beautifully refined clientele.  Unfortunately, the prices are the same, if not higher, than those downstairs.Bottom line...don't come here expecting the same level of quality that you expect to receive at the proper STK restaurant chain.  This may share a kitchen and real estate but it is vastly under par in comparison.The One Group, you're sullying a good name and you should be ashamed.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

A friend and I got there earlier than expected for a friend's birthday, so we didn't try the food at the bar. Not sure how much dinner would impact our pockets, so we started with some drinks to get our buzz going. We knew the steak would taste much better with a glass of red already in our palette.I didn't even know the STK in meatpacking had a rooftop, and I was speechless when we made our way to the table upstairs. It was an absolute sight for the eyes. The atmosphere was brilliant, and the rooftop wasn't so crowded so it really felt like our own little get together. Friends had their eyes on the famed mac and cheese appy, but my heart was set on that filet. It didn't disappoint. Not the best steak I've ever had, but definitely a top 5.The service, while very pleasant for the customer, did take some time, but I'll have to credit that to the party. I didn't expect not to be full once we got up from the table, but the feeling was welcome since we got ready for part 2. Once the music started picking up I was all in. I just loved the atmosphere, it was picture perfect. We had a private guest list so getting drinks wasn't a problem, and I ended up seeing a bunch of people I know from work and a couple other friends. I was migrating from top to bottom and I couldn't keep my feet planted. I was smiling the entire way through.I didn't come in with any expectations, but if I did STK would have exceeded them. A server told me they're expecting big things for the upcoming New Years party, and she offered our group some incentives to come. I already bought my ticket, and even though I've only been there once, it seemed like a crime not to go back.

In fact, it was so good my neighbor asked me for half of my portion! (I gladly obliged) Oh and they didn't laugh at me when I ordered my steak 'cooked through' (or Persian Style as my neighbor says). The cheesy, garlic bread they brought prior to the meal was also delicious.

Started out the night on the rooftop: beautiful views of the High Line, the Standard, the Hudson, and the sunset. Oh, and New Jersey. DJ was spinning retro hip hop and pop, the crowd was still going on late brunch fumes and the party was a-poppin'. A few pitchers of margarita/ mojito got us going proper. Then the sun sets, and the party moves to the restaurant downstairs. The group is 8 strong, so we're going all out: trying all the appetizers, most entrees, all the sides, and all the desserts. Yes, no point in being shy. The waitress, whose name I don't know but I wish I could recommend her (she's Asian), is an amazing straight-shooter steering us through the outstanding versus the average stuff. The beef tartare is unusually lightly dressed, but the beef quality is so high that it's actually better that way. The lamb rack with date glaze is delicious, and so is the duck. All the beef cuts are amazing, as the name STK would suggest. Every single side was spot on, and the desserts were good to the extent we were actually able to dig into them while feeling completely bloated at that point. One last word on the wine list: very big and impressive, like a proper upscale restaurant: on the expensive side, but we were able to find bottles in the $55-65 price range which would normally blow the socks off any competition in NYC.

Stay away from the mac and cheese and truffle fries. Actually those fries are not good at all, and I was looking forward to eating those. The service here is horrible. I wonder if a requirement to work here is that you have to be rude and act like an ass. The nicest person working here was the bathroom lady who hands you the towels, she has a great personality.

We started off with some drinks that were kind of outside the box. I had the strawberry cobbler and dirty pearl martini (the olives were stuffed with blue cheese). Booth were very good - but extremely strong. We then moved on to appetizers - we got the shrimp app, which was just so-so. It was not at all what I expected. It was basically two shrimp that laid on top of rice crisp with some type of sauce on top. The shrimp were kind of hard and the rice crispies were very soggy. I would not recommend getting them...especially for $16 (which was a rip off).For dinner I had the skirt steak with the blue butter dipping sauce. Yum Yum Yum!!! Both were amazing! The steak was so tender and well seasoned that you didn't even need any dipping sauce. It was perfect just the way it came out. For sides we split a couple - mac and cheese, creamed spinach and Parmesan fries. The mac and cheese was good - but didn't taste like your typical mac and cheese. It was made with Parmesan so it had a bit of a strong bite to it. The creamed spinach was decent - not as creamy as I was hoping for and the Parmesan fries were very very good. They just melted in your mouth - especially when you dip them into the blue butter :-)For dessert we all shared the chocolate smore - warm fudge brownie, with toasted marshmallow, gramcrackers and vanilla ice cream. Although it was good - I wish we had tried the ice cream cone sampler or cotton candy. We saw them both come out to the table across the way and it looked so fun!!! Next time I come back I'm trying them!Other than the food - the place looked amazing and the music was old school 90's (I just can't believe I called the 90s old school)!!!! The service was nothing special - our waiter was attentive but not friendly. Oh and one more thing - after dinner we were sitting there talking and the manager came up and asked us if we could leave the table since he had people waiting to eat . He then went on to say that he would buy us all a round of drinks since we were being inconvenienced. WOW!

The rooftop was empty except for 5 tables, but we were told we can only be at at one of the high-tops, ""no chairs"", etc etc. We reluctantly agreed, and I asked the two ANTM aspirants pretending to be hostesses to show us to the tiny, elaborately described area to which we were supposed to confine ourselves. As we started walking over to the high-tops, these two decided that we were no longer welcome and made up a dress code which changed each time they repeated and which included complex combinations of ""shorts are ok, but only if you are wearing a collared shirt and topsiders"".

Walking past the cozy, glass encased fireplace and through the bull-horn inspired art adorning the walls behind the bar elicited feelings of fancy restaurants seen in Las Vegas. Upstairs are semi private rooms to accomodate much larger parties.  The restaurant itself is definitely fitting for the meatpacking district.  Half of the clientelle looked to be tourists or businessmen and the other half looked like they came straight out of the Sorprano's. Literally. My table sat next to Johnny ""sack"" Sacramoni and AJ Soprano. I came *THIS* close to walking over to AJ and advising him to measure the rope more precisely the next time he chooses to try to end his life by drowning himself in the pool. I mean...duh.Star sighting aside, the crowd wasn't too diverse, typical of what you would find in a meatpacking district restaurant.I got here a ltitle late for the dinner party and so only had desert and some samplings of the corn pudding and truffled mac and cheese. The corn pudding was tasty, but nothing innovative. The truffled mac and cheese was great as well, but didn't stand out more than similar dishes at other restaurants. The entrees served at the table included steak and the skate. Both looked yummy and were devoured clean by the table.  The desserts were a taste of chocolate covered heaven. I had the S'more and did not want to share!

We only waited for our seats for about 10 minutes (some of the group had gotten their early) and stayed by the bar where we ordered a round of cocktails. I got the Tea Time - one of the best cocktails I've had in a while! Earl Grey tea with mango-infused vodka, or something like that.We were a large group of 7, and were placed in the back in a great corner booth. Our server was very friendly, knew a lot about the different cuts of steak, and attentive. Music was good and the whole place had a great atmosphere!The food:Appetizers - we started out with the Fried Oysters (special of the day), Tuna Tartare w/ Plaintain Chips, and ""Lil' Big Mac"" Sliders. All were absolutely AMAZING. If you had to go with one, though, I'd say go with the Sliders. There was definitely a hint of truffle on them, which made them extra good.Steak - I ordered the Medium sized Bone-in Rib Eye topped with Black Truffles, cooked medium rare. The steaks, which are aged cuts of steak, was perfect, and the truffles were divine!! The meat was cooked just right, with that nice crispy charred texture on the outside. It was a great size (I'm small, so I couldn't finish), and the flavor of the truffle combined with the beef was delish. Also, if you ask, they'll bring you out a whole set of sauces to go on the steak, from red wine sauce to blue cheese with garlic, to steak sauce, and many others I can't remember. Sides - For sides, we ordered the Mac & Cheese, Creamed Spinach, and Truffle Fries. Mac & Cheese was the best, but they were all great additions to the meal. And a side note, but the Truffle Fries really resemble more  little bricks of potato than fries.Dessert - By dessert-time, we were all so ridiculously full, so we just ordered the Cotton Candy (since one of my companions said it was ""just like whipped sweet air"". Fun and delicious, it came with two chocolate covered strawberries.As you can probably imagine, everything was spectacular and I'd definitely recommend it.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

This was understood, however the restaurant had another agenda. After we finished eating, one of the STK staff came in to our room and stated that they could not ""accommodate us"" on the rooftop because there were simply too many of us (13 of us) and we could not all ""fit"" up there at that time. That was BS. Needless to say, after another additional hour in our private room, we decided that we were going to go downstairs and speak to the manager to go to the rooftop. First off, downstairs was a zoo. EXTREMELY loud and disorderly people. After we all weaved ourselves through the crowd, we made it to the elevator to go to the rooftop. We explained to the staff woman there our situation and she made the same comment as the previous staff ""we cannot accommodate you all"". Strange, because as I stood there watching the elevator, a group of 7 guys went up. After our rejection, we asked for the manager on duty- Matthew Rosen. Matthew came over and 3 of my friends began to talk to him again about our situation. As they talked to him, I watched another batch of people go up- total count, 9 people.

Unfortunately the experience with the hostesses made me feel that I will most likely NEVER come back here!Upon purchasing the voucher, you were required to pick a date and time for your reservation. I had picked a Thursday night in April. Unfortunately, due to the NY spring being quite a cold one this year I fell sick a few days earlier and called to see if I could reschedule. When I talked to the hostess / receptionist, I specifically mentioned that if it was a problem to reschedule I would still come in (although I was much too sick to be out drinking and dining). I was told that it was perfectly fine to reschedule and rescheduled for 2 weeks later (the week in between I had a client in the office which I knew I would need to work late for). When it finally came the night to use the voucher, I came into the restaurant mentioned my name and reservation time and that I will wait at the bar (as I knew I had arrived early). The hostess immediately told me that they do not accept Gilt City reservations anymore and that they would not take me (although someone had called the day before to confirm my reservation). I told her the reason why I had made another reservation after my original date (that I was sick and that I had rescheduled the date, AND since they allowed me to reschedule I can only hope that they would honor the voucher). This is when 2 of the hostesses started to talk to each other in front of me telling each other that they can't do that and then another stepped in and told them to get a manager. The manager came over a few minutes later and I spoke to him about the reason why I had cancelled my previous reservation and that I would still expect the restaurant to honor my voucher as they had originally said they would. He was more than happy to accept the voucher and explained that I should just wait at the bar until the hostess comes to seat me (and my guest). Although it had annoyed me, the way that the hostesses had treated me, I was just fine with leaving everything behind and having a great time. As I mentioned before, I've been here multiple times and it always has been a good evening filled with good food, amazing drinks, and a great atmosphere. However, what ruined my night more was that after this the hostesses continuously came over to me asking if I was a certain reservation (asking my name) and when I wasn't, their response was ""Oh, you're the Gilt City reservation"". After early 5 times of this, I was near to say:""NO! I'm not the Gilt City reservation, I'm Melodie and I have a reservation at 9:15"". When I was finally sat (45 minutes after my reservation time), I was told that I wasn't going to get menus because I had a Gilt City reservation and they did not have the Gilt City menus anymore as she walked away.Thankfully the waitress made my night much better when she brought over menus and explained that although we do not have the specific menus she would point out what on the main menu was available to me. The only reason I would come back here is because she made me feel much better. The service was great (as it usually is) and the food was amazing. The fact that I had a Gilt City reservation does not make it acceptable for a place to treat me like I was different.

The place has a very hotel-y feel to it. There was music playing but not overly loud- I was easily able to have a normal conversation. For appetizers the Fois Gras French toast is very savory- and comes with apple and sherry. The Tomato/ Prosciutto dish is nice too since they are heirloom so you get that organic feel. The steaks are good but nothing amazing.  I have trouble telling the difference between the cuts but last time had a filet and it was good.  What stands out more are the sides... the parmesan truffle fries, mac and cheese, broccolini, and mixed mushrooms are all delicious.  My favorite is the sweet corn pudding- DON'T miss out on this one! Cocktails are well made, I like the Strawberry Rhubarb Cobbler and Cherry Cosmo. My only complaint is the cocktails were too strong especially paired with dinner- the second one was like drinking vodka straight with a dash of cherry flavor.  Then again, that may be a bonus for someone else...*Note: No reception with T-mobile.

748,Xf7uN2SbNbCkvJiL1E-iVg,Anthony Y.,5.0 star rating,"We found ourselves in the Meatpacking District looking for STK (pronounced Es Tee Kay) the restaurant I had originally planned for on Friday night. Since there was no sign on the outside we walked passed it twice. Eventually we found it & strolled in and went straight to the bar, sat down and looked at the drink list, very niiiice.Their cocktails were all handcrafted. Meaning, house made bar syrup, house made sour & fresh ingredients. I Love places with this much emphasis on details in their cocktails (see my blog about the Ususal). A few of the cocktails we sampled I listed below:""white orchid""ketel one citroen ginger cosmo with canton, white cranberry juice, and candied ginger""gin fizz""oxley gin with fresh lemon & lime juice, sliced cucumber (mudled) , topped with soda water""rediscovered cherry cosmo""smirnoff black cherry vodka, triple sec, white cranberry juice, fresh lime, dried cherry""tempest storm""absolut berry acai, limoncello, muddled blackberries and fresh sourI won't go into too much detail but to answer your question, yes they are all as good as they look. All had very different flavors and every sip was a good time. Our bartender was amazing. He was an actor  doing Broadway and had just gotten into Harvard, pretty impressive right? We told him we had just gotten engaged and he took care of us which was very nice. He was genuinely happy for us and wanted to hear about it. He knew when to talk to us and when to let us enjoy ourselves. His cocktail recommendations were spot on and he killed it on the food endorsements.He urged us to try the lil' Big Macs, he said, ""every time the a guest orders them at the bar, all the bartenders wish they could have a bite."" Done. Send 'em right over. Before that he brought us a pan of bread with a side of chive infused olive oil. It was a green color and a little scary to look at but had great flavor when the bread was dipped in it. The bread was apparently fresh baked by a local new yorker that came in every morning, which made it taste that much better. Then came probably the best thing I put in my mouth all weekend, the Lil' Big Macs: Japanese Waygu, special sauce, sesame bun & a white cheese that I couldn't put my finger on.Japaneese Waygu: basically Kobe beefSpecial Sauce: not just your ketchup and mayo special sauce but your good burger special sauceSesame bun: Fresh Baked by the same lady who cooks the breadThe first bite was unexplainable, so good, so flavorful and so tender! As I was chewing I looked at Sol, then the bartender, I didn't have to say a word. He said, ""I know..."" - Sol dug in as well and if we hadn't planned on continuing on for another few cocktails we probably could have eaten ourselves in to a coma. But I will never forget the way that tickled my taste buds.

758,5glaB4fxnhpqYOZHvAZZ_A,A L.,1.0 star rating,"I did not even get to dine here. Here's why: I made a reservation for a party of 5 for memorial day on the rooftop. 3 of us showed together and 2 were 10 minutes away so they would not seat us until our whole party was there. Not sure why this was the case as we were ready to start drinking/eating. But not a huge deal. I asked where our table would be when the rest of the our party showed up and the hostess pointed out a table that was 80% in the open blaring sun on an already VERY hot day.  I asked her if they could place an umbrella over the table and she told me that was not possible. So a rooftop bar didn't have a single umbrella? That seemed especially strange to me. So I told her the table was not going to work as it was way too hot for 4 out of 5 of our party to be caught sitting in the open sun on a rooftop. There was another table in the middle of the space that was completely covered in shade so I asked her if we could have that table instead. She replied that table was RESERVED (n that exact tone). I said, ""but we have a RESERVATION."" Again I was told that was not possible. So I had enough and went across the street with my friends to a beer garden where we were immediately seated in the shade and had a FABULOUS time.  I don't need attitude from an unprepared staff of a rooftop bar, where i made reservations, about the fact that my party doesn't want to sit in the blazing hot sun. Why is a rooftop bar not prepared for shading their customers and why did we get attitude about it? Just WAY too much negotiating for my taste.

This got us booted from the booths and seated at a square 4-top with the leaves pulled out to make it circular. I would have left then (especially since parties of 5 could be seen in the boothes), but others were getting hungry.The server started by asking us what kind of water we wanted. Tap was the preference, but Fiji was served. Maybe an honest mistake, since the place is loud (there's a reason that other reviewers have described it as being like a nightclub, and if you are one of those that like to have expensive meals in nightclubs, then this place is for you).Not a great start. We ordered our appetizers, 6 different sides to share, and our mains. I had the shrimp rice crispies. Interesting concept and presentation, but pretty underwhelming flavor in the bisque and rubbery/overcooked prawns.The sides were also hit and miss. We ended up getting an order of lobster mac & cheese that no one had ordered (again, the noise), as well as the truffle cheese fries (overwhelming truffle oil: when 6 people don't finish a single side of fries something may be amiss), haricots vert (virtually raw and barely touched), creamed spinach (not my thing so I can't comment), mac & cheese (liked by some, but I thought the parmesan overwhelmed it), mixed mushrooms (barely touched, perhaps because it was an interesting combination including enokis as well as shitakes that dominated the others -- definitely not the mushroom side one might expect in a steakhouse), while the most popular was probably the asparagus.Three of the four red-meat dishes were overcooked. I returned my ""rare"" lamb that was only approaching rare in the very center, while a friend had to saw through his very well done ""medium-well"" sirloin. Another steak was also overly cooked. Seems kind of weird that so many places, especially steakhouses, cannot cook meat properly. This is even weirder when you consider that you can order a rare burger at the Parker Meridien's Burger Joint and actually get served a truly rare burger that is properly cooked to order in a way places like STK apparently can't master.Probably the best (or most appreciated) parts of the meal were the bread and the deserts, which were widely enjoyed.It was also interesting to note that although our party wasn't big enough to qualify for a booth, it was large enough to qualify for the automatic 20% gratuity. Funny how that works out.From the NYT review:""Is this a restaurant or a nightclub? In the meatpacking district, where STK fittingly makes its home, that's often a distinction without much of a difference. STK attempts to do for filets and T-bones what some of the city's Asian funhouses have done for sushi and spring rolls: turn them into edible accessories for a naughty expedition to the other side of midnight. It's two kinds of meat market in one.""""Almost every steak was crowned with half a cherry tomato, which evoked the cherry on a sundae, and some steaks were pretty good.

A nice place for getting dressed up and meeting up with friends for a Friday night out. When you come to STK, you're definitely paying for the vibe and name. We were a party of 4 and was seated in a booth. While the food is good, it's clearly not the star here.

The steak is no exception, even a small sirloin is worth it, with all the sides you're bound to fill up quickly. But be sure to save room, the dessert is what makes me smile the most.

They offer cotton candy, depending on the day you go, they offer different flavors but I assure you it's in abundance so don't think it's just a small portion.

Next morning on saturday- we woke up to him with food poisoning. Its now Monday and he still can't eat anything.  We know that was thinly thing that it could have been because we both ate the same thing, only difference was i had an Idaho steak cooked ""Well"".We should have known better, but when you get told the waiter recommends it this way- and you are paying about $75 for a steak, you want to make sure you eat it how it was meant to be.  Other than that i do love STK, just be careful!",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

I dislike the neighborhood and read some average reviews.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here.Service: I was a bit turned off by the service when we initially arrived. They couldn't find our reservation at first and turns out the person who took down our reservation had us down for the following Sunday (17th instead of the 7th) a bit annoying considering they were rushing when we called to make the reservation. On top of that, the restaurant was half empty but were asked to wait at the bar as they could not seat us until the last person in our party of five arrived.  Our servers were good. During our meal we ran out of water but no one was in sight so we had to wait until after we finished our food to get a refill.Food: I was surprised by the food - much better quality than I had expected. Like many of the previous reviews, we opted to try the sliders with truffles. As tiny as they were, these may be one of the top 5 bugers I have ever eaten.  The tuna tartar was fantastic - well seasoned and the plantain chips that accompanied the were a great contrast.   We got the shrimp appetizer - they were some if the largest shrimp i have ever eaten. The sauce was a spicy cocktail sauce which I enjoyed considering I don't usually enjoy cocktail sauce.  Lastly, we tried the fois gras - I am not a huge fan of liver but tried it.  The toast & syrup that was drizzled on top was great.  As expected, I didn't care for the liver. I'm not a huge fan of the flavor but I'm glad I got to try it.Now on to the entrees - we all got the bone-in 14oz filet. I got mine medium rare but it was more on the medium side. My friend asked for medium well and ended up getting medium rare.  The meat was good quality.  However, I had asked for the peppercorn steak and it turned out to be way too seasoned. I usually over pepper my food - I love pepper on everything.  In this instance, it proved to be too much. If I ate it as is, my mouth was burning so much I couldn't appreciate the other flavors. So halfway through i started cutting off the outside part so I could enjoy the unseasoned meat inside.Sides:Sweet corn pudding - my favorite of the assortment - fresh corn with a delicate pudding that went well with the savory part of the meal.Cream spinach - not the best I've had. They used full spinach leaves instead of chopped spinach which I enjoyed. Not too seasoned so mostly tasted like spinach.Creamy mashed potato - well seasoned but a little too mashed for my taste. This was more like a paste than potato consistency.Asparagus - great side! Well prepared and not overcookedTruffle fries - was hoping for shoe-string fries but turned out to be little blocks of potato. Enjoyed the crispy outside and perfect balance of truffle oil.Mac & Cheese - I tasted truffle oil in this as well. My friend thought it was too salty. I thought the truffle was overpoweringDessert: my friend got the tres le ches which was fantastic. It was light with a light hint of coconut flavor. I opted for the cotton candy which was huge. I think it was strawberry lemonade flavor as parts were strawberry and others a sour flavor.Overall, the meal was enjoyable.

It's as true as the sun setting in the west.  The best part of these upsets are the raucous fans chanting ""Over-rated! Over-rated! Over-rated!"" I felt like one of those chanting fans last night after eating dinner here with other colleagues for our holiday party.This place was packed! Why (I asked myself)?  The answer to this question couldn't have been any more obvious - young b&t folk/Wall Street types decide to impress other Staten Island/Long Island wenches by taking them to a restaurant that must be cool with a name like STK.  ""Dude, it's like steak without vowels, this place has to be awesome and it's in the meatpacking district...it's a sure thing like your mom is after a drink and a roofie.""  This is a third tier steakhouse surrounded by landmarks like The Old Homestead.  STK shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence. It would be like comparing Harold Minor (""Baby Jordan"") to Michael Jordan (His Airness), which is to say it would never happen.The quality of food here is not very good at all, but they seem to have no problem charging an arm and a leg for mediocrity.  I was in my normal drinking haze (read work function), when waiters began the food barrage.  They started walking around with appetizers including sliders and fries, shrimp tempura, vegetarian skewers, and beef on a stick. Nothing noteworthy here all of the appetizers were bland and lacked creativity.Three drinks later we sat and ordered dinner from the abbreviated menu.  I ordered shrimp cocktail, filet mignon (medium), and the chocolate volcano cake.  The shrimp cocktail was completely lacking any taste, granted they were the jumbo shrimp, but others like the Palm and Old Homestead serve bigger shrimp that are deliciously sweet.  A good steak can truly stand on its own sans sauce, however this filet required their silly blue cheese to dress it up and mask the true quality (or lack thereof) of the meat.  The desert was fairly decent but again lacked creativity, however the cake was hot, which was positive.Why two stars then?   1 star: because I didn't have to pay the bill.+ 1 star: some of you b&t girls are smoking hot eye candy and make me want to take back all of the offensive dribble that I've said about you in the past (saw my first fake boob in NYC up close and personal here)----------------------------------------------------------2 starsYou won't catch me here on my own free will.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

I had the opportunity to visit this new restaurant in the Meat-Packing district on Friday night with a group co-workers.  The restaurant is huge, sleek and trendy, with a clientele to match.   It's equal parts bar, restaurant and lounge, and orchestrating the crowd in this place requires a staff of many, with headsets and all - not unlike a Madonna concert.  The sheer volume of patrons demands a huge coat-check - so big the coat-check girl has to take an elevator to get to it.  I picture a vault the size of Area 51 and a sea of cashmere-wool blend coats, all in black.Dinner for 9 got us a banquette right in the center of the restaurant.  It also offered a special and specific kind of eye-candy - a celebrity sighting.  Adam Sandler was seated at the table behind us, with a group of his friends.  Yep, me and A.S. kicking it at STK - that's how I roll.The food and drinks are big and decadent, as you might imagine.  I enjoyed two RARE STK gin cocktails which were so strong I nearly floated through dinner.  We shared many appetizers - and the best ones were the steak tartare, tuna tartare, foie gras...and my absolute favorite, corn pudding.  For dinner I had the bone in-ribeye, which was delicious.  And huge.  Flintstone-car-toppling-over huge.  I could only eat half, which felt more like half a cow than half a steak.Our service was great - the waiter was extremely personable and handled our group very well.  All of his recommendations were spot-on, which I appreciated.If you feel like going BIG, go to STK.  There is nothing subtle about this restaurant, and it celebrates its extravagance in style.  The food is very good, and has good choices for both red-meat eaters and their non-red companions.  Don't forget to look around when you're there, because there just might be someone famous sitting next to you.  Or maybe you're the famous one - it's hard not to feel that way at STK.  So hike up that dress, slap on those stilletos and enjoy.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

Really though, we went here on a Thurs night after dinner around the corner, and it was really crowded when we arrived (it thinned out considerably after midnight). The crowd in there is typical of the Meatpacking district, if you know what I mean. I have to say, aside from the lovely bartenders and the alcohol in my glass, there's not much I liked about this place. Some of the people in there are downright lame, esp the woman who was back-to-back with my friend, who was sitting on a bar stool, and kept trying to share his seat with him, uninvited. And then there was the group of Euro-trash girls who kept trying to squeeze themselves up to the bar without even a thought about the people they were pushing around.

Upon arrival we had to walk through the restaurant to get to the private room. I was shocked at how PACKED this place was. It was above and beyond the normal business at a restaurant. There were people everywhere! It felt more like a club than a restaurant honestly. Very fun vibe. 

Finally got to the private dining room. Beautiful room, but absolutely freezing! Between the arctic temps in the room and the fact that I had just landed at JFK an hour and a half before, I started up those cocktails quick! 

The food overall was pretty good at STK, however, the service was really terrible. The waiter was very kind and I could tell he was trying, but he could not alone handle our table. That many people with so many drink orders going etc., management should have designated two servers to the table and not leave this poor guy to fend for himself. 

We ordered about 4 seafood platters with crab and shrimp cocktail, oysters and sashimi. It was ok. Not the best  I had ever had. Caesar salad was delicious. The strip steak itself was tasty and very large in portion. Dessert, I wasn't thrilled.

From what I hear, going on a Monday night is VERY different from going on a weekend night. I went Monday night so it's more subdued, less crowded. If you go on a weekend, it supposedly is loud, long line, and just happening with people everywhere which makes it cramped/crowded. Anyway, when you walk in, it's very sleek and black. You can tell you are in a Meatpacking place (the club TenJune is downstairs).The service was exceptional. I loved my waiter. He gave great recs, was attentive and very fun. We had the shrimp appetizer and the french toast foie gras. Both were excellent. We then had the cowboy steak (ribeye cut) with 2 diff sauces (blue cheese butter and some house sauce). The steak didn't need the sauces, it was very good. We also had the parmesan truffle fries (just ok), asparagus (fine), Corn pudding (AWESOME).

You do.  I am not a fan of their desserts, last time I had their Bread Pudding; it was too much on the sweet side, but they gladly removed it from my check when they saw we didn't try but two bites.  Great service, full of hardworking people.  Of note, always come here with a reservation, I've seen people wait 2hrs on weekends to get a stab at this fantastic venue.  Also, when at STK, feel free to take a minute away from eating and sing along to some 80s pop rock.  Good times!",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

Everyone complained that the shrimp were too large and didn't have good texture. I didn't partake in shrimp, but my oyster and tuna were delish.We had a set menu; I selected the Tuna Tartare appetizer, Filet Mignon entree and S'mores dessert.The Tuna Tartare was excellent. It was a very generous portion, and came with a pickled pineapple relish, crispy fried shallots, some sort of spicy sauce and perfectly salted plantain chips. Yum! I wanted more when I was done.The filet was very typical, nothing special. There was 1 random osyter mushroom off to the side on the plate, and the roasted (I think) shallot was under-roasted. The potato puree was great, very creamy and rich.The S'more dessert was good, just not quite what I expected. I expected 2 graham crackers around marshmallow and chocolate. Instead, I received a HUGE brownie with some sort of peanut butter-caramel sauce and marshmallow on top, and a small scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side with graham cracker crumbs underneath.

I'm just indifferent about meat, it never call my attention enough to choose it in my meals except for Carpaccio. I'm maybe the less qualified person to write this review but just want to point out that I needed 3 years to get excited about a Steak. From indifference I switch to temptation when I first saw it in the plate of 2 guys seated adjacent to me last week at STK; and so, 2 days later I booked a table for the following sat night.  BoNe-in RiB STeaK (20 oz, $40) for 2 people. Medium cook. Blood-red  inside; thin brown layer outside; perfectly cooked, tender and juicy, barely seasoned. And now I'm glad I didn't resist; bring me to the hell if you want. I haven't change my mind of how I feel about meat. I maybe don't eat Steak next time I come back. I maybe come back just for the soft-semisweet-cake kind bread served with basil infused olive oil in a small iron-pot. Or I maybe come back just for the tuna sashimi: fresh, barely seasoned with kosher salt and some herb that I couldn't recognize. Delicious. All enough good to be confident about the rest of the menu, which is quite interesting,. or maybe I just come back for the dessert; they should easily call themselves  SWT (Sweet house) instead; I saw some of the desserts in other tables.. omg... but we opted for Tres Leches Cake (dulce de leche - coconut sorbet - crispy macaroon).. speechless.   and life is funny... being a not meat eater the only thing I didn't like was the creamy spinach as side coming with the Steak. The service and the noise level don't deserve more than 2 stars.

849,H3vw9k6TTMa63vYcf9FyCg,Marshall H.,4.0 star rating,"(from 04/18/2008 via Citysearch)A group of people from work decided to celebrate a recent success at STK last night and we were pleased with our choice. STK offers a steakhouse menu combined with a fairly typical Meatpacking vibe. My 10 oz. filet was up to par, although not the best I've ever had... I'd rate it a 7 out of 10. We split 6 side dishes and they were all solid... the best by far were the parmasean fries -- basically a very interesting and delicious version of french fries. For an appetizer I went with a half dozen oysters, which were nice to start the meal but I've had much better oysters at some of NYC's finer restaurants that specialize in seafood. The wine list is actually reasonable and we had two bottles of pinot noir, priced around $60 each. That made the experience more affordable and kept the wine flowing throughout our meal. Dessert was probably the best part of our experience... banana bread pudding was superb for me but the true winner was the peanut butter s'mores -- we actually ordered 2 of those. The molten chocolate cake was another success. The resaurant is trendy and in general STK has something for everyone. It wasn't the best steakhouse I've ever been to, but it was certainly the youngest-feeling steakhouse I've been to. STK says it caters to women and that is clear because the restaurant's main dining area was totally filled by 8pm and I'd say it was at least 50% women. Being a guy, I was of course okay with this. Unfortunately the crowd can be a little bit touristy due to the restaurant's reputation and location, but I got over it. Music selection in the main dining room reminded me of a playlist you'd hear at an NYU-area dive bar, but again as long as you don't expect the 'typical' steakhouse experience, it's a fun time. I'd go back to STK but only with a group and not simply to satisfy my urge for red meat... upstairs private rooms would be great for parties I bet.Pros: Fun, Trendy, Lots of Women, Good Steak, Good Food, Good Service, Reasonably-Priced WineCons: Better Steak Elsewhere",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

I'm not actually fussed about the price, but the reality is that they put themselves in the big boy's leagues at those prices and the reality was far from it. I had the fois gras with French toast,. It was very, very sweet and had a huge amount of cinnamon in the apples. Might as well have not bothered with the fois gras to be honest; broken pallet on behalf of the chef or didn't taste before serving. In any case, very poor. My wife had the blue cheese salad and again, poor pallet on display. Basically a plate of blue cheese. We shared the Porterhouse sharing steak which was good but not great, basically, the texture was good but the flavour was missing. We also had the Parmesan truffle fries which were undercooked. The Parmesan tastes like pre-shaved from the local supermarket to be honest. We didn't bother with desert after all that.On the positive side, the Malbec was nice as were the green beans.So basically - go somewhere else if you've got 350 bucks to spend, there are plenty of places in NY that will do you well for a steak.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

Definitely NOT dry-aged, which was specified by the server, no char what so ever, and no seasoning.  It was horrible.12 oz. Skirt steak, decent, after much needed salt and chimichurri sauce that was actually just herbs and oil.Truffle fries- bland, not crispy, no apparent truffle oil, and the insides were almost raw, but definitely really dry.""Roasted Brussel Sprouts"", came covered in some kind of syrupy honey sauce and bacon which were both not specified on the menu, we wouldn't have ordered them.We got the check and got the hell out of there.  When you pay $49 for a steak (ribeye) it better at least be decent.  If you go to Porterhouse in the Time Warner Center and get there $49 Brandt Ribeye with chili oil, AMAZING.Lets get to why this was so disheartening; The Chef and the guy in the suit who wouldn't check my coat, were in the bar chatting the entire time my wife and I were there for dinner!  Maybe he should be in the kitchen watching his food.",STK Downtown,3.5 star rating,$$$$,"Steakhouses,, American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars"

We had to make reservations when the entire place was pretty much empty. After the hostess seated us our waiter was friendly. Then after taking our order his attitude completely changed.

We ordered the parmesan truffle fries which was the best dish for the night, skirt steak, Foie GRAS French toast, beef short ribs, and 2 glass of merlot. I asked the waiter what Foie GRAS was and he said finish the dish first and then I'll tell you. Excuse me what kind of attitude is that. I explained to him that this was my first time eating Foie GRAS and was expecting him to be a little more helpful. The Foie GRAS taste mushy and disgusting. We wanted our skirtsteak medium rare but when it arrived at our table it was badly presented. My first bite of the skirt steak was dry and cold. I was seriously disappointed since this restaurant had such good reviews. Then I tried the beef short ribs and it was cold and dry too. This was the worst experience at a steakhouse the food did not meet expectations. Then the waiter refuse to give us our check. I asked for the check 4 times. The first time he refused and said we need to get desert. He brought us the dessert menu after I made the request for the check. Then he made his way around again. After I continue to express no interest in ordering dessert he reopened the menu and insisted that I order something. I was shocked and didn't understand what was going on. I never experience such rude service and didn't even know how to react I thought it was a joke but he didn't apologize. First impressions are very important.

Yes, an hour and a half after our reservation.  And they have the nerve to say they can't seat you until your whole party is present, but when they are present, they make you wait 90 minutes?  We checked in with them about 5 times and every time it was the same response: ""Please wait at the bar.  Your table will be ready soon"".  This is CLEARLY a strategy (they overbook), and a way to get the place crowded, and to get people to spend money at the bar.  Disgraceful.  Others we spoke to had the exact same problem (a guy who had a reservation for 9pm did not get seated until 10:30pm).  I guess I could see why they did it because by 11pm the place really started to clear out and there were empty tables everywhere.  They may be losing grip on being the ""cool"" place down there so maybe  they are overbooking to still try to have that busy feel.

It was empty yet took us 20 minutes to be seated. The waitress got half our drink orders wrong. No one came to take our order for over 45 minutes. We ordered sides for our steak and someone ordered crab to go on top of their steak and both of these came 25 minutes after our steaks and ended up being served to us at the same time that we were given our bill! And they charged us for the sides and the crab! Plus, there were no apologies from the staff. We were so pissed that we were tempted to leave no tip but decided against it. Instead, we told the bouncer downstairs how horrendous the service was and all he said was ""Oh I've heard that from several people"".

That was the one and ONLY strike about STK. We finally got seated around 8:45 and everything else afterwards was just perfect. The food was surprisingly GREAT! STK isn't a typical steakhouse, its more for the scene and in the meat-packing district, therefore i wasn't expecting great food. Their sides are made to share so we ended up getting 4 sides plus our own entree and it filled us up! The portions were good as well. Their cockail menu is also FABULOUS!! Kind of pricey though. The best part of the whole experience was the fact that they had a live DJ at the place and he was playing GREAT music all night long, so it made the ambionce even more enjoyable.

In my experience, this place hires young girls who spend a substantial amount of time on their hair, then they pretend to be restaurant servers. The three of us stopped in for lunch. When my friend asked about the type of bread used to make the sandwich, she shrugged her shoulders and said ""White ?"" . She was clueless. The least she could have done is ask someone. That was the first red flag... Then, after waiting 45 minutes, she stopped at our table and said that there was a problem with our order, but it would be right out. That was the second red flag. We ordered the easiest item off the lunch menu, three sandwiches, and made no changes or special request, so how could there be a problem with the order. And there was only one other table with customers in the restaurant. The sandwiches were just ok, had much better quality at Cosi and Au Bon pain. The third and final red flag was the bill. $100 for three sandwiches with gratuity.

Arrived about 45 mins early hoping to get seated since normal people don't usually eat dinner at 10:45pm.. We were seated about 15 mins later... Service: sub par.. Food.. ehhh sub par too.. Our waiter was NOT friendly.. We wanted to start our meal off with the raw seafood platter and then decide on our entrees. Waiter claimed he had to put the entire order in at one time. That was pretty strange since there is such a thing as appetizers.. Anywhoo.. In addition to the raw platter I ordered the lil Big Mac's with a side of parmesan/truffle fries and the creamed corn pudding. My friend ordered the crab salad.. The sliders were pretty good. Next time I would probably add the black truffles to the burgers.. Fries were excellent.. Although they were more like thick cut potatoes and not crunchy french fries. Still good. And the corn was fantastic. The salad was good and the crab was fresh. Nothing really stood out about the meal.. After dropping off our food the waiter never returned to ask if we needed anything else.. other then than to bring us the bill (which we didn't ask for)..Despite the poor service I would probably return..

I actually found the pineapple garnish too overpowering, which is probably helpful for those who aren't really a fan of the raw taste, but the tartar alone with the spicy sauce was amazing, and the fried plantain chips on the side were a nice touch. I also have to say again, the yukon gold mashed potatoes are fantastic, so buttery and sinful and worth the clogged arteries. For dessert I tried their mango sorbet, which was light and sweet without being too sugary, a great end to what was a pretty heavy meal.
