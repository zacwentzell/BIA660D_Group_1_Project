I could say that it seemed like the sauce they use is the same on everything. I like a variety but either way it's good.",Chun Wai Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

Hot & Sour Soup, Veggie Soup, Veggie Fried Rice, Moo Shoo Veg, fried chicken, spicy cashew chicken, cheese wantons, egg rolls, and spring rolls are our favorites, but so far everything we've tried is delicious and delivered fast & hot! Great stuff!",Chun Wai Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese
