Low key dive bar but they have an awesome Sangria special--$10 per pitcher (red or white). AMAZING! Had a pitch I split with friend and it wasn't too bad, not as strong as say a Portuguese place would have but still tasty and alcoholic. The appetizer sampler is really good too! We had an order of two for 4 people which was more than plenty of food, though we may add an order for the chicken quesadillas to fill us up.The food was typical bar food but still tasted really delicious. Wings weren't too well done but still crispy and meaty. I love wings with the bone not those gourmet chicken nuggets that are called boneless wings. The onion rings and mozzarella sticks were my absolute favorite! I will definitely be coming back here on another Sunday Funday for the Sangria special and order a few different appetizers to munch on. The staff was really attentive and quick with the orders.

Instead of ordering two entrees, my boyfriend and I decided to split three appetizers -- the buffalo calamari, the tomato and mozzarella salad and the spinach and artichoke dip. Let me just say now that each of these appetizers was incredible. The mozzarella at Mikie Squared is homemade, and you can taste the effort put into making it. The buffalo calamari is also a unique spin on regular fried calamari; combined with the creamy dipping sauce they provide, this was by far one of the best appetizers I've ever had -- especially since as a pescetarian, I never get to eat buffalo wings and this is a great substitute.

The food is good, especially for a place that looks like a bar (loud music, lots of TV's).  The first time I had the ""Cindy's always on a diet"" and I really enjoyed it. The honey balsamic side it comes with isn't my jam, but it's ok because you don't need it, the chicken is moist and the veggies are well seasoned. Maybe not worth $13-14, but coupled with cheap wine, it made a decently priced meal. Last night I had the special, which was a corned beef sandwich. I'm no corned beef connoisseur (mainly because it's usually on a reuben with two of the grossest things someone can put on a sandwich- swiss cheese and sauerkraut), but I really enjoyed it. It came with chipolte mayo, which was kind of a weird addition but seriously amazing. Like, I could put that on anything. Even the cole slaw was worth eating by itself. I like that there was no upcharge for getting a side salad instead of fries. Salad itself is just mixed greens and two tomato slices, but it was fresh and well dressed. They have half priced wines on Wednesday, which is always welcome. They also have trivia...I didn't play either night but the questions weren't ridiculously hard and it's well paced.

The food is good, especially for a place that looks like a bar (loud music, lots of TV's).  The first time I had the ""Cindy's always on a diet"" and I really enjoyed it. The honey balsamic side it comes with isn't my jam, but it's ok because you don't need it, the chicken is moist and the veggies are well seasoned. Maybe not worth $13-14, but coupled with cheap wine, it made a decently priced meal. Last night I had the special, which was a corned beef sandwich. I'm no corned beef connoisseur (mainly because it's usually on a reuben with two of the grossest things someone can put on a sandwich- swiss cheese and sauerkraut), but I really enjoyed it. It came with chipolte mayo, which was kind of a weird addition but seriously amazing. Like, I could put that on anything. Even the cole slaw was worth eating by itself. I like that there was no upcharge for getting a side salad instead of fries. Salad itself is just mixed greens and two tomato slices, but it was fresh and well dressed. They have half priced wines on Wednesday, which is always welcome. They also have trivia...I didn't play either night but the questions weren't ridiculously hard and it's well paced.

Our favorites are: Chicken Quesadilla, Alyssa's Everyday Chicken Wrap, and Onion Rings (super crispy, greasy, and delicious)...and Yuengling :)The Stevens college crew used to dominate this place, but now it is much more hipster/yuppie Hoboken types, which is actually better (weird to say). Service is fast and attentive, they bring you water right away without having to ask which is nice, and don't mind filling it up versus other places that expect you to only drink alcohol the whole time.  If you stay hydrated with water, you actually drink and spend more, so good job Mikie Squared!I will continue to be a regular here.",Mikie Squared Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Sports, Bars"

However, they have a handful of tables inside and outside and even have a large window that they open on nice days (so you can sit inside be feel like you're outside). Overall, it's pretty dark inside but that just makes it easier to see the bunch of TVs they have that are showing any kind of sporting event on at the time. The actual bar itself is pretty sizable and runs the length of the front room.Bathroom: unknownStaff: Our waitress was nice and kept our water glasses full almost the entire time.Food: We just had lunch, so no drinks. But many others were boozing away during Sunday brunch. We started with the Lobster and Corn Chowder (yum!) and then had a salad and wings.

Honestly our only complaint was that they brought our dinners out while we were still working on the apps and there was no room on the table.

I placed my order and passed the time by reviewing my lunch from the day before lol. The burger came out pretty quickly (I mean I was basically the only customer) and was a perfect medium (secret: I've taken to ordering my burgers medium-rare cause just about everybody seems to over cook them). I thoroughly enjoyed this burger! It was a nice size and indeed pretty damn juicy. It had a great sear and pretty pink center. The cheddar cheese was melted and yummy.

I had some trouble physically cutting it at first, but once I got in there, it was juicy and flavorful. The over easy eggs were cooked perfectly and the breakfast potatoes were crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, just as they should be.Sat outside both times.

This is a bar before restaurant, and there are a better spots in Hoboken for food, but sangria sunday is a great way to get a buzz on before you start your week.",Mikie Squared Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Sports, Bars"

I love the fact that it's consistently a fun, nonpretentious atmosphere with a little something for everyone. it doesn't strive to be one of the many tropes that some other Hoboken bars fall into. a few TVs with various sports games, but not too many that it drives you crazy because you can't focus on one. coming here on game days is lots of fun. there is a positive vibe and not just drunk people looking to smash something when their team loses.a decent beer list (they've got Magic Hat, Blue Point, Woodpecker Cider, and some other good brews in addition to the usual big names) and excellent mixed drinks.GREAT food. the filet mignon tips with the lime/cilantro sauce and the nachos are my favorite appetizers (the filet mignon is also availabe in sandwich or wrap). for entrees, besides the great variety of wraps and burgers, I highly recommend the ""drunken caveman"" pork chops made with cranberries and JACK DANIELS SAWWWWCE. if you're looking to eat healthier they have various salads and a fair amount of the menu is grilled. they're also very accommodating to modifying your order.various specials and events throughout the week. $5 martinis, trivia nights, holiday parties, $2 Yuenglings after 11 on weekends, and of course, Sangria Sundays ($10 pitchers).the service can be a little lagging time-wise, but it's never terrible. understandable, since it's usually a busy place, at least when I go. the staff are friendly too.it's not a perfect bar, but it's still very good - and that's really all you need to get things going for a wild night in Ho-ho-hoboken...",Mikie Squared Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Sports, Bars"

It was visually beautiful in presentation and equally as delicious. My friend had the bambino omelette. The way the food is presented opens your appetite.

""GET OUT OF MY WAY UNLESS YOU WANT BEERS SPILLED ALL OVER YOU"" (Of course, we were only in the way because the host was taking us to her section to eat.)  She was much nicer then.   Why do I give this place 3 stars?  Because everyone else is really nice!  I really love the Tropical Chicken sandwich and Sangria Sunday is awesome.

All though everything about this place sucks, it is still a good spot to watch a sporting event. I went to this place with 5 of my friends. When we sat down 3 different servers came up and said the server would be right over. 15 minutes later she showed up and we knew it was going to be a long night. My girlfriend ordered a strawberry mojito and everyone else had ordered beers. First of all, it took 15 minutes for her to grab the beers and mojito which was very long for the amount of people in the restaurant. I would say there was maybe 2-3 other tables in the entire place. The strawberry mojito was easily the worst drink I've ever seen in a restaurant. It tasted like 6 oz of Malibu rum, soda water and there were about 5-6 limes in the drink? Tasted absolutely terrible and we returned it. So at this point it has taken us 20 minutes to get draft beers and some shit mojito drink. Our food then came out. My gf and I had the buffalo chicken wrap and the chicken fajita wrap aka a burrito that they tried to give an cool name. Both were awful, we each took about 3 bites and called it a day. This establishment sucks. Service was beyond bad and there were no systems. It should never take 20 min to get a draft beer when there are 3-4 tables in the restaurant.

They also told us that at lunch time the wrap would be $8 but at dinner time it increases by $6 (almost 50%) for literally the exact same item, exact same portion size. So pricing is based on what time I order?

I think I just found what people call ""the typical jersey crowd"". Aside from that the place was alright. My Tuesdays just became my Saturdays because of my work schedule so I was looking for a new place to hit up and meet some people. Since it was a Tuesday night, I understand that it was not the best night to be there but still the place did not impress me that much. They had some sports on the TV which was cool but that was pretty much it. The bartender was not talkative at all and when she was not doing a quick sweep of the bar she was in the corner chatting with the other employee there. With all that going on I finished the one beer that I ordered and headed for the door. Overall I gave this place a three star rating because of what I described above. I would have given it a two star but like I said earlier, it wasn't exactly a Friday night so I understand it was not that bumping.

We had planned on hopping all night, but wound up staying here a bit longer than we anticipated (with good reason - plenty of TVs on so we could watch some Hockey)The bartenders and servers were pleasant, and the drinks were reasonble. (with $3 SoCo Lime shots, you can't really go wrong, plus a bunch of other great drink specials)Only issues we ran into were as follows:The bartender, or maybe it was just the server, didn't know what/how to make a liquid cocaine shot despite how many times my friend tried to explain/order it. (I think our server thought we were joking or something) I had ordered a Long Island Iced Tea for a few girls that were with us, and though it wasn't bad, It wasn't one of the best I've had.

I have never had huevos rancheros before so i do not have anything to compare them to. I went there today for brunch with a friend and after looking at the small menu for a couple minutes decided on the ""eggs of the ranch"" i think that is what it means...hahaha..little blogger humor there. To me it was like an egg taco and it was tasty! They (2) were topped with some cheese and guacamole and i ate them very fast. The home fries that came along with it almost stole the show. Most time when you receive potatoes with your breakfast plate they are either the hash brown style or the cubed pieces of potato. In this case pieces of potato. They were cooked with some red peppers and onions like many you mike of had but for some reason these ones tasted like they were cooked by the hands of Jesus. I had a so so bloody mary along with my eggs. Bottom line...it was a one time deal, but hey gentle hands of Mikie treated me right and produced a breakfast/brunch dish i will remember for a while.

178,9ZFOdE2txwc_lAnOO05zvg,Allison B.,3.0 star rating,"Sports Bar ~ Laid Back ~ Good Drink SpecialsThis place is good for that random Monday night when you want to get out and watch the game, eat pretty good bar food and wash it down with $2 drafts. You come here mainly for the atmosphere, the good drink specials and to root for your boys in Green, or whichever you prefer ;) FYI the owner Mike Fasciano also owns Margherita's Pizza and Cafe in Hoboken and is straight off the boat from Italy. Alli's Report Card:Food: The food is pretty good but nothing amazing. Mikie's goes a step above traditional bar food and offers seafood dishes such as Lobster Ravioli ($16) very good burgers and an extensive wrap menu ($10 - $14) I'd stick to the burgers and capitalize on the cheap drafts and $10 Sangria Pitchers, which they also have Monday nights, not just Sundays. Apps: Nachos Grande (($10) were eh, not very good the beans weren't good and the cheese didn't fully cover the chips which is no bueno. Entree: Crab cake sandwich ($13) was ok, cooked well but didn't seem super fresh, might have had something to do with the fact that Hurricane Irene tore through Hoboken two nights prior, either way I was pretty adventurous to try it. The Maxx Burger ($14) was very good, juicy,  fresh avocado, bacon smothered in cheese, yum. Sweet Potato fries were very good cooked very well with a slight crisp, just the way it should be. Booze: $2 drafts and $10 Sangria pitchers. Sold.Service: Very good, Juan rocked it but I think its hard not to since the place is small he was always within earshot. Decor/Layout: Decor is your typical sports bar decor but not super nice. I added layout because I wanted to point out this place is long and narrow, I don't love when bars are long and narrow, and this place is kind of small. If you want to watch the game you have to sit at the bar. I had to move locations because the table I was at I couldn't see the screens. Plating: C - Not the focus of this place but not bad for a sports bar. Date Night: Unless you want to impress him with your football knowledge and chug a few cold ones, take him somewhere less sports-barish. Girls Night : Yes if you are all sports fans.Large Party Gathering of Friends: Yes, this place is somewhat small but can accommodate.",Mikie Squared Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Sports, Bars"

I like having my sandwich with bread on both sides, I don't like my bread to substitute as a second plate. Oh well. It was pretty tasty.

We were in town visiting and the strip of Hoboken with restaurants and stores had been recommended by a coworker as a cute area to walk around. We ended up at Mikie Squared due mostly to a close parking spot and our being too lazy to walk very far. We were seated immediately and while the quarters are close, it is not stifling. They seemed to have a drink special for every day of the week and it looked like Ladies Night is every. single. night. We ordered some beers and nachos. I was pleasantly surprised by the nachos and our waiter was great at refilling our drinks with little to no prompting. This just seemed like a nice little neighborhood bar. I will say that if there is a Yankees game on and the guy who was sitting at the bar is there, you may want to leave. He is obnoxious.

Our food was brought out within minutes of ordering and boy! It was delicious, not what I was expecting for typical bar fare. The wrap was made with fresh ingredients and had a homemade chipotle mayo inside. The wrap was then grilled so it had wonderful flavor.

199,42qLOul-_dL2lalySaG0UA,Jennifer C.,1.0 star rating,"I've only been here 3 times, but I'd never go back, especially with all of the other options in Hoboken.  How does this establishment expect to stay competitive with all of the new bars opening in the area?My 1st visit was a year ago, which wasn't too memorable.  I think I returned for drinks the 2nd time and my 3rd and final visit was this past month.On all visits, I would say 50-75% of the barseats were filled and it was extremely hard to get the bartender's attention.  The majority of his time is spent on making drinks for the service bar.  Occasionally, he steps away to grab something from the customers' end of the bar and this is when the bar customers have an opportunity to put in a drink order.  After that, he always retreats to the service bar corner.  This happened on each visit and it wasn't always the same bartender.  It's just frustrating to have a bartender within reach, yet his priority is not his bar customers...it's the waitstaff & THEIR customers.  As a former bartender, I think it's important to multi-task and prioritize (your bar patrons are priority...and if they're not, make it appear that way).  That being said, if you plan to visit, you're probably better off requesting a table.  I can guarantee you'll get your drinks faster than at the bar.On my last visit, I saw a duo next to me eating nachos.  In general, their food is not fantastic, but the nachos looked good!  So after I finally flagged down the bartender in the midst of his service bar duties, I put in the same order.  It didn't take long and the appetizer came out.  My bf and I finished the first layer, but everything beneath the first layer was submerged in a soup of chili.  I glanced over to the couple and their nachos were dry...down to the very last layer.  So maybe I (or the busy bartender) accidently ordered chilaquiles (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch…) instead of nachos.  So I asked the bartender (btw, a second guy was now behind the bar) if these were the same nachos, and he said YES!  Even though I rant on yelp, I'm definitely not the type to complain in restaurants unless absolutely necessary.  I explained very politely that I was a little upset that my order came out like soup while the other couples' looked appetizing.  And the bartender proceeded to give me all these excuses as to why they were like so:  1) He didn't make them. It was the cook (no $hit),  2) the cook just put too much chili (no $hit), and 3) I'm sorry, i understand it should come out the same (stating the obvious).He didn't even attempt to rectify the situation, instead he just gave me a string of pathetic excuses.  Eventually, he cleared the plate after he noticed we weren't eating the dogfood he had just served.  He presented the check, we paid for the bill in full, and didn't stiff him a penny on the tip...as you might suspect that I did.  You know, Mikie's Squared might have preserved their profit margins that day by charging us for everything.  That's fine and I understand they need to run a business.  I may not be a regular, but they lost a customer.  Not only that, I find myself telling people about this experience, especially to those that live in Hoboken.  It's not because I hate this place, but because I want to save my friends from having an equally bad experience.  They're losing future customers, too.  I hope they accept this evaluation as constructive criticism and learn to pull it together, re-train their staff (both front & back of the house), and strive for consistency (you can be consistently bad, but at least you're consistent...haha).",Mikie Squared Bar & Grill,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Sports, Bars"
