0,sgk0J9CJiA9jaeZBNqCEhA,Steph R.,5.0 star rating,"I like this spot for a quick ""healthy"" snack. I've been coming here for years now and the items are always on point. My favorite items are fried crispy chicken wontons that are $1.75 for twelve it's delicious I'm getting hungry just thinking about them. I also get French fries I like that there salty and I put ketchup on them one by one... it's like a fun activity. I've tried the house special rice and chicken with broccoli and it's all good. They also have tostones which I also love and other American options like cheeseburgers.",Lee’s Chinese Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

Mrs Lee and Johnny are also really cool to talk to and really remember every customer.",Lee’s Chinese Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese
2,gjQvWPOi-FEhN35YPnB7Pg,Barbara M.,1.0 star rating,"The delivery experience was good.  I felt bad for the man, his hands were nearly frozen and I have him a pair of gloves. He was appreciative.They forgot my sodas.They returned with the two sodas.The steamed dumplings were pretty good, the right amount of ginger was there in every bite.  They seemed to be under steamed so I put them in the micro wave so that I won't catch some sort of bug.The shrimp egg foo young was HORRIBLE!! over fried, burnt to the point that the small shrimp were hard as little pebbles.  They were paper thin and disgusting.The rice was also over cooked and stuck together like rice paste. This staple was done poorly.I called and was offered another order.  I passed.The feeling for the meal passed.Not sure if I will go for another order there again or not because the food is what matters and they didn't deliver the taste and quality food.",Lee’s Chinese Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

5,TAqXaSMHpmjbk_Fp10R8Fw,Jose S.,1.0 star rating,"Thought this place was one of the best Chinese food spots?!?!.....WROOOONG I called N they didn't pick up. So I would walked over n in front of the register I called to see what they would do. They didn't even budge to pick up the phone and say give me a minute please, letting the phone ring and ring. I understand when a business is busy, but have some courtesy. The lady was extremely rude when I finally was able to get my order in. There are  better Chinese spots around.",Lee’s Chinese Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese
6,YlHfPPRKUeQC6L344RXLDg,K P.,3.0 star rating,"The food here is amazing but lee's attitude sucks. Some days she nice, other days she yells. Some days she delivers to my house, Some days she doesnt. She also treats her employees very poorly. Great food, horrible service. Wish i could've given the five stars, but how well u treat paying customers is a deal to me.",Lee’s Chinese Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese
7,6YcE0iqnqoayP6JgsqvZkA,Ewen Y.,5.0 star rating,"This place should be at the top of the list for the area.  There are many Chinese takeaways to choose from around here and I've tried most of them...Lee's is the one I go to from choice.  Admittedly I am not very adventurous when it comes to Chinese takeaway food (usually it's either curry or sweet'n'sour chicken), therefore I'm not the most qualified for an opinion on anything much else on their menu.  However, I am a bit of a food snob in general (meaning that I don't settle for terrible food, not that I'm a snob on what establishments I'll go to).  I love the Lees' curry.  Spicier than the usual Chinese takeaway curry and almost bursting out if it's container.Ms Lee recommended the dumplings to a friend, so we got some.  I thought they were amazing and just as good as anything you can get in some famous establishments in Flushing (which I've been to).  I always pick up a few now when I pop in for my curry.I Read some other reviews (the couple of negative ones that have really hurt the overall rating, which is a shame) and can't but help think ""are they referring to the same place?"" The only downside, from my experience, is that they're kind of a victim of their own success.  This place is very popular for deliveries.  There usually only seems to be one, sometimes two, people cooking and therefore you can be left waiting a very long time.  For me, I just make sure I'm not in a huge hurry when deciding to go there but it certainly has always been worth the wait.",Lee’s Chinese Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

9,YMnw_Uc1IjCKz0FiBYP_rw,John G.,4.0 star rating,Great food. Especially the breaded chicken..my only complaint is that they RARELY answer their phone to place an order. You have to call them 20x before getting through.,Lee’s Chinese Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese

11,ym5S0PrXOcXU5bcO_Z8ORA,Angelica S.,4.0 star rating,"Breaded Chicken with Pork Fired Rice, no other Chinese spot can make this dish like they can. Kitchen is clean. unlike other spots where they have the kitchen behind closed doors so you can't really see whats going on while your food is being made.",Lee’s Chinese Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese
12,RD7wcRPjrmC1uEEY-V--tw,Ocean C.,4.0 star rating,Really decent little hole in the wall.   Cheap authentic Chinese.     Definitely a takeout place as there is zero ambiance but the foods good and cheap.   Worth a try for a Chinese craving delivery or pickup.,Lee’s Chinese Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese
13,RLA20Yz0cdeguVHW9IeFfw,Lynn G.,1.0 star rating,"Ms. Lee is RUDE! The food is good but after complaining when I found long black hairs (yes, plural) in my breaded chicken she didn't apologize or even offer to give me my money back. She literally hung up on me. I will NEVER eat from this place again.",Lee’s Chinese Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,Chinese
