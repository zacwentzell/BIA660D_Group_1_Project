My girlfriend and I decided to dine in last night, so we brought a bottle of wine (Nana is BYO friendly). The dining room was practically empty, just us and another couple. The interior space leaves lots to be desired (bright overhead fluorescent lighting, bicycles scattered all over the place), but the food makes up for it. I've tried almost everything on the menu, but last night we started with the Thai Sui Mai which was really tasty, especially for the low $4 price tag. I had the Thai Basil with Chicken $9 and my girlfriend got the Drunken Noodles with Beef $11. Both portions were huge, spicy, and satisfying. Our server was friendly, but being that Nana only has one front-end person working per shift, you could tell she was overly busy with takeout orders to really be attentive. Overall, I would stick to take out and you won't be disappointed.Dine In experience: 3 StarsTake Out: 4 Stars",Nana,4.0 star rating,$$,Thai
1,giBAIlOAp85OMHOEDoifew,Annie C.,3.0 star rating,"First night in NJ and I chose to eat dinner here as there were not a lot of vegan/vegetarian restaurants  in the area of our our hotel. There's plenty of street parking and we found one right in front of the restaurant. It seems to be a casual restaurant, we walked in and sat ourselves. Note: it was chilly inside, we ate with our jackets on. We ordered spring rolls, tofu soup, red curry with tofu and Pad Thai with tofu (no eggs). + spring rolls were filled with veggies and perfectly crispy on the outside. We liked it enough to order a second plate. + tofu soup was big enough to be split between two and had big chunks of broccoli, carrots, bok choy in a tasty broth. + red curry tofu was served with white rice piled into a cone shape. If you like Thai curry this was a good dish. It was spicy enough to keep it interesting without needing to drink lots of water. There was also a good amount of different veggies that were cooked enough to keep the greens crispy + Pad Thai was sweet with a spicy kick. I was assured it was not a spicy dish but my poor kids were surprised and eventually didn't eat it. If you're not a fan of when the slightest spiciness this would not be the dish for you to try!At the end of the night it was a good meal, but not the most comfy atmosphere.",Nana,4.0 star rating,$$,Thai

We ordered at 7 PM (already pretty hungry) and the delivery time was between 8-8:15.  We ordered 2 chicken drunken noodles, crab rangoon, and chicken tom yum soup.After waiting patiently while being completely famished we realized it was almost 9 PM and still no sign of our food. I thought it was completely ridiculous that it took 2 hours just to get our food on a Sunday night. After the food was finally here, the driver told us the restaurant sent them to Hoboken first even though we lived just a few minutes away in Jersey city itself. How irresponsible on their part?!So we finally opened the bag only to find that the brown paper bag was completely wet and the soup was leaking everywhere. Review of the food:Crab rangoon - was actually good.Chicken tom yum soup - I ordered spicy and this was probably the most mildest and watered down bland soup I have ever had. I just threw it out.One chicken drunken noodle was mild while the other one I ordered was spicy. Again, the spicy drunken noodles tasted about the same as the mild almost. No spice at all even though I could see red flakes. The flavor was overall okay but not what we were expecting based on the 4 star + rating. It really sucks that there are hardly any decent Thai restaurants in the area.A 2+ hour delivery is definitely unacceptable no matter what time of day it is.

The food always arrives on time or, more often than not, early. My favorite dishes are the Thai Basil and the peanut curry chicken, both with chicken, but I have yet to try a dish which I did not like. As a spice addict, I enjoy Nana's ""extra spicy"" options.

They weren't gratuitous. The greean beans were crisp, the carrots were soft but still had bite. Very nice. Rice was good, and a good amount of chicken.

Called 10 min after eta and they said the food was ready, but driver was not there. They said they'll make new dishes if the food is cold later on, but they did not. First time ordering here, and probably will be the last time.& the food was definitely not worth waiting two hours. Terrible restaurant with horrible service and food.",Nana,4.0 star rating,$$,Thai
45,f3PWUWMKrO5JPORyiYanjg,Archana R.,5.0 star rating,"This is probably the best Thai place in Jersey City now. A hidden gem in the Heights, this place is going to blow up, I feel it! I've been here about 3 times now and I've had their Drunken Noodle, Green Curry, Green Noodle and everything has been exceptional.  Writing this review right now while looking forward to my Panang curry! Don't miss their refreshing Thai iced teas either. I think this is a family run operation since I've only ever seen the one server talking to one chef, so service can be a bit slow at times. But I'm still loathe to knock off any stars since the food has never been less than exceptional",Nana,4.0 star rating,$$,Thai
46,FWGKud1x3J0hHuq3W1HkRQ,JP S.,3.0 star rating,"Wondered what Thai and Spanish fusion would taste like so we tried it. Nana is at the most part Thai, not a lot of fusion-y choices. The Thai part is standard but good. We ordered a pa tai, fried rice and curry dishes to try. Fresh ingredients and all well made. Two things.1. Can of soda is 1.50. Mark up is understandable but still...2. Foodies with shell fish allergies, there is shrimp paste on everything. Be careful or avoid.Normally the rating would be 2 stars but the waitress was really nice and was serving the whole restaurant on her own on a Saturday night. She gets a star.",Nana,4.0 star rating,$$,Thai
47,_BN_xtMWmPtjhpglv7yi2Q,Melinda A.,5.0 star rating,"Do yourself a favor and go here. This place is real Thai food. If you are looking to taste Thai dishes that aren't dumbed down for the western world, this is the place to go. I lived in Thailand for close to 10 years and have struggled to find anywhere that has an authenticity to their food since I left. Nana really has it and it's on my doorstep!The staff are amazing and the chefs are incredible.  I really can't recommend Nana Restaurant more.",Nana,4.0 star rating,$$,Thai
48,ZOnUxO42iWFNSnMlaLXOZg,Rachel T.,5.0 star rating,"As Noodlefan devotees, we were a little skeptical that this place could hold a candle to our favorite Thai spot in JC. Don't make our mistake. Believe the hype! As it turns out, this place is great. We went in on a Saturday afternoon. It was dead inside (we were the only sit-down patrons), but that just meant the service was super prompt. Our waitress was very sweet and accommodating. Plus, the vibrant wall colors made for a nice atmosphere.HIGHLIGHTS:* Crab Rangoons -- Now, I don't know if you're like me, but I grew up in MA, where we have a very specific type of crab rangoon: thin, crispy dough with *lots* of creamy filling. It's been extremely difficult to find a replica of my favorite appetizer anywhere outside of MA... Do you see where this is going? Nana's crab rangoons turned out to be exactly what I've been searching for! I can't overstate how thrilled I was when I took my first bite. * Green Curry -- I'll admit, I'm a rookie when it comes to Thai-style curries (I always get noodle dishes at Thai restaurants). But that rangoon experience must've had me feeling some type of way, because I took a leap of faith and ordered the green curry on a whim. And guess what? I'm so glad I did. It was definitely spicy, but I love spicy. We also ordered:- Papaya salad- Drunken noodles- Thai iced coffeeThose were all delicious, too! All I'm saying is, don't sleep on this place. They deliver, so the next time you're hungover and planted on the couch, give this place a call.",Nana,4.0 star rating,$$,Thai

Not this place ... Really good Thai food with usual menu.  and extremely friendly group of servers, owner and chef(all separate)  .

50,_ngoTUOawk5k002r9kGRKg,Alma M.,5.0 star rating,"I always leave Nana Thai happy, satisfied and plotting my return. The flavors are so fresh, layered and complete. Their crab rangoon appetizer is pleasing to the eye, as well as the stomach. It is a generous portion of these adorable tiny purses, bursting with flavor. Be careful, though, past that perfectly crispy pastry is a molten cream cheese and crab filling. That's how quick it comes to your table from the stove. Approach with caution. It is the only place I know that serves khao soi, a northern Thai/Burmese dish. Their khao soi is ridiculously rich, full of flavor with so many mouth-pleasing textures. It is comfort in a bowl. After the 2nd bite, you're wondering when you can devise another opportunity to come back to the bowl. Did I share that the khao soi is not even on the menu? It's one of those secret dishes that the chef and cooks eat. And if you didn't know this already, the best dish out of any restaurant kitchen is the one they serve as ""family meal"" for the staff that appears on no menus. To have the privilege of sharing what the cooks eat, is the best part. Tonight I could not get my khao soi, so I got a big bowl of beef red curry noodles. The rice noodles swim in a silky coconut milk curry with a subtle hint of heat, lying at the bottom of each bite.  Though I have been to Nana Thai a handful of times, I can't attest to more than these three dishes, because they're so perfect I have not managed to order anything else. Next time, I'll try something unexpected.",Nana,4.0 star rating,$$,Thai

54,2dBgvYy3ZVK4ZrlYRuieyg,Jules J.,3.0 star rating,"This could have potentially been a five star review - delivery was prompt, food was flavorful, ingredients seemed fresh - however...it was waaaay too spicy! I selected mild from the drop down menu on my Pad Thai, and it was so spicy, I had a tough time eating it. Like, lips burning ten minutes later kinda spicy. If you're a hot hot hot kind of person, order away. Going forward, I hope the chef follows the mild request for those of us that actually want to experience flavor instead of just pain!",Nana,4.0 star rating,$$,Thai

I was one of 2 tables and a man placing a take out order at 9pm on a Saturday night. Eventually I got up and asked the girl if they were still open. It says 10pm but since she was ignoring me, I thought maybe I had wandered in at closing. She said yes and then went into the kitchen. Once she came out she started counting the register. A few minutes later she got on her phone. At that point it was over 10 minutes of her ignoring me, so I headed out to find a restaurant interested in providing food for people!",Nana,4.0 star rating,$$,Thai
