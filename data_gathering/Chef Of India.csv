Little did we know the restaurant was closing in 20 mins and that they may not be able to deliver on time due to closing, etc. We ordered Chicken Chettinad and Chicken curry with naan.

Can you imagine our frustration? That's right.... We were absolutely pissed/hungry/whole nine yards...Reached out to Eat24, they eventually got a hold of the manager... This is where the experience changes from horrible to amazing! Manager, call me directly and apologized to me a hundred times. Really amazing guy, he told us the delivery guy might have messed up something and this is not how we expect the deliveries to go. Restaurant is already closed at this point (it's 2 AM now) he told us he is opening the restaurant back up and will be cooking. Fresh order from scratch and will deliver it to us himself.

From a very dissatisfying experience, the manager (Karthik, I believe is his name) decided to accept his mistake, apologized, and on top of all that, went ABOVE AND BEYOND, To make sure no customer will ever have such an experience from his restaurant. To me this restaurant deserves the utmost respect for how treated us, and the food we ordered. Not only did he win us over, I think at this point he just one a lifelong customer. Not many restaurants or companies go above and beyond at this day and age. And this was really admirable. (And we got down desserts we didn't order as a thank you).

52,OMJwlCECjqBtY3cCxhpqyw,Venus R.,5.0 star rating,"What a gem! I am such a fan of Indian food and I'm so excited this place opened up down the block from me and my fiancé. Service: To start we walked in and placed an order for delivery. The gentleman that took our order was so great, very friendly and made us feel comfortable. To be honest, me and my fiancé tend to feel the eyes stare at us when we go into an Indian restaurant.  It was a nice welcoming feeling and was very appreciated. Food: I had the dal makhani a vegetarian dish made of beans mostly red kidney beans and black lentils, Order came with white rice. This is usually one of my favorite dishes. The spice was perfect. The texture was so nice and creamy and the beans so tender. I don't tend to eat white rice but we had an order of garlic, which I'm guilty of dipping. Perfect compliment to my fish. Also they gave us a yogurt sauce which I personally loved and added to my dish. It is a little grainy and turned off my fiancé, but hey more for me. My fiancé had the goat biryani, which was together with a buttery rice and a hard boiled egg. He enjoyed the dish, said there was nothing really special about it, but was enjoyable. Portions were big so We think you get a good bang for your buck. They also included two donuts in a light syrup. Nice and light not too sweet. Suggestion: Although, this is a place I will surely revisit, just wanted to make a suggestion that can be of some help. Jersey city heights is a predominantly Spanish area. There are an abundance of Spanish restaurants. So having a new restaurant come along that some people would be afraid to try, I would just like to suggest to have the food descriptions under the names of the dish. For many ppl going into a restaurant they do not know anything about the food or culture can be intimidating. When I first started eating Indian food the places we would go to always had a description and made it easier for us to start trying dishes. Makes new customers more comfortable knowing what to order and may gain more business since ppl won't ask. This is a great place I would love to see stick around!",Chef Of India,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

We found Chef of India on Yelp, ordered and crossed our fingers that this was going to be our go-to Indian restaurant. Except it's not.Two things that really bothered me. One: delivery man unwilling to come inside the building to drop off our food. Let me rewind a little bit. We get a delivery estimate right after we order: 45 to 60 minutes. Whenever I get an estimate, I always assume the later time, so we are expecting a 60 minute wait. Once an hour passed, our driver called and said his car broke down and he needed another 30 minutes. Okay, things happen. I get it. We wait for another half an hour. Then the delivery guy calls back and asks us to come down and pick up our food. We order delivery on a weekly basis, we have not had a single delivery guy ask us to come down and get our food. There's a process for delivering food in my building. Every single delivery we've gotten has followed it, regardless of what we order: Chinese, Italian, Indian, Korean, etc. The delivery guy refused to come up and told us that if we wanted our food, we would have to come down and get it. Talk about poor service. That was a huge turn off already.Second: the garlic naan was the most bland thing I've ever tasted in this world. It's like eating paper. You don't taste a thing when you eat it. I see the garlic on the naan, so the spices are there, it just doesn't taste like anything. My fiance agrees too. Garlic naan is a staple when we order Indian, so it has to be done right, otherwise, we go elsewhere. Unfortunately, we have not found our go-to Indian restaurant yet. Will continue searching in the JC area and most likely won't order from here again. Don't want to deal with the hassle of delivery, just because the driver is too lazy to come up to the apartment.",Chef Of India,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

It's a storefront and they're building their business so it's a little too casual and low budget.I've ordered the tandoori chicken a couple of times now and oh my goodness it is delicious! They serve large portions and pieces of chicken. It's a little over Lee's spiced for my taste but I'm impressed with the portion size and the cost.I've also had the Collie flower and potato entrée and each time I've had it it was overspiced, too much chili pepper and too hot on my palate despite me saying I really want my old spices. So that's a little annoying.We've ordered a number of vegetable dishes as well and the same thing holds true with the level of spice again we ask for little to no spice and it usually is too much for us to handle. In fact one time we just threw the entrée away and then we said we wouldn't order again. But we have hoping they'll get it right the next time.We want so much to support a local business in our neighborhood and we hope they do fine but they have to listen to their customers and make the orders as we request them.I like that they are connected to seamless and eat 24 and that they are on yelp.

(just under 4 miles away).  They've commented on the distance before and took 2.5 hours to deliver in the past so this wasn't an isolated incidentToday we ordered again and while it was outside the estimated delivery window (took about an hour and forty minutes) we don't generally mind that as it is has been our favorite Indian food thus far.Unfortunately today the food was very bad. Pains me to say this because we really liked this place and tried a lot of the other Indian places in the area and always felt this restaurant was leaps and bounds better.  The food has always been great and the delivery people have always been so nice.  Today, my butter chicken only had two pieces of chicken in it.  The sauce was not the same consistency or flavor and my garlic na'an was crunchy stale.  They had to have known the na'an was stale and crunchy because it was packaged in crumbles and broken pieces on top of each other, not next to each other as a single piece would have been.Waited almost two hours for delivery and now have to go out and get another meal. Usually I overeat their food because it is so good.We also ordered Chicken Tikka Masala with regular na'an.  This order only had three pieces of chicken, but the na'an was fresh and was not stale.  The sauce was also good as is typical.  It's unfortunate my meal was so bad.  The only thing I keep thinking is that perhaps they sent the food out bad intentionally because they don't want to deliver out to us anymore.  This is our first bad meal here and unfortunately it will likely be the last attempt.  It doesn't seem to be an accident.  So long Chef of India, it was great while it lasted.  We will miss you.",Chef Of India,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

The chicken with Fatty, dry and overcooked. Vindaloo sauce had so many strange objects in it I couldn't even crunch and enjoy. It had numerous clothes, leaves other weird things that were unidentifiable. I have eaten Indian food all over the world so I know what chicken vindaloo is supposed to taste like this was not even close.  Asked for Pappadam and the person on the phone did not understand what I meant. I had to Google it and read it to him then he finally understood. Also they did not have any mango chutney which I find very odd for an Indian restaurant. The Gobi Manchurani consisted of stale Cauliflower  and overly greasy sauce - and on top of that as I mentioned I was ice cold when it arrived. Only good part about the meal with the mint yogurt sauce which we dipped the freezing cold soggy Naans in. Had high hopes for this place because it difficult to find a good Indian restaurant that delivers. We were let down, like anticipating Tom Cruise on a blind date yet actually meeting someone who more resembles Danny Devito instead. Sigh. Ps. clearly they entered my phone number into their system when I called to order because 90 minutes later when I called to ask ""where is my order?"" they did not pick up.   I called a couple times.

95,Fa1zCHg_St2-_08-DuysKA,Dawn C.,5.0 star rating,"I almost do not want to write a review because this place is so dern good.. It is very unassuming... I went in (for a carry out) on a Friday night... EVERYONE was in the weeds, but were trying their darndest to keep everyone happy. This was my first time here and was starving, but since I have been a server I get it. It is not sexy inside, but the food makes up for it. I ordered the Punjabi Spring roll, garlic Naan, Punhabi Paneer Tikka Masala and the guy had Chicken Chettinad. It did not take under 30 minutes as promised... Still everyone was so nice. 45 minutes later I had a FULL BAG of food for 30 bucks. I RAN home with my goodie bag and BOOM! Happiness. First up - this is the first Indian restaurant where they give you rice! TONS of yummy rice!The apps were crunchy and DELISH!  The chutni was fresh tasting. My Tikka was not very paprika  heavy.. it had a lighter and lemon flavor.. VERY yummyThe Chicken Chettinad was a new dish for the guy. At first, he was not happy with the oily look to it. When he tasted it, it was full of flavor. Full of hot peppers and curry leaves. Very spicy!! he was sweating out the goodness and could not stop. He said it tastes muuch better than it looks. And we enjoyed the Naan.. it was thinner than most which was enjoyable because we did not overstuff when we dipped it in our sauces. Four thumbs up",Chef Of India,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

Firstly I think their idea of welcoming guests and looking after them throughout the dining time is really touching !! Coming to the menu , me and my friends thought that some of the vegetarian appetizer options were different and wanted to try them , so we ordered the Guntur mirchi bhajji and bengaluru aloo bonda both were mouth watering and crispy .. We also tried the Madras vegetable curry and garlic naan which was done perfectly by the Chef . Great food!

He personally came home to deliver and we had a great conversation.He has invited me and my wife for an in-person dinner as well in the restaurant.I am extremely pleases by the effort that the owner put in regarding: 1) Getting back to the customer, acknowledging the issue, fixing the problem and getting back with the updated changes2) Taking personal interest and making sure everything is customer and feedback-centricThe food was delicious as well and prepared according to our instructions. Its very rare you as a consumer have a change of heart and become loyal again when it comes to restaurants - but this has happened with me and Chef Of India definitely joins the ranks of my go-to places for delicious, affordable Indian food in the Jersey City area.To the owner and team at Chef of India - Keep up this spirit!",Chef Of India,4.0 star rating,$$,Indian

It took ~1 hour and the food was of average quality.Now, please look at Sheesh S.'s review from 8/14/2016 and you'll find exactly the same comments that I was about to provide. The order was well over two and a half hours late. Following three calls to the restaurant, and three assuarances that the order would be delivered ""within 10 minutes,"" the manager had to come himself to deliver the food. It had clearly been sitting out for a long time, as it was cold and bland.Unfortunately, we will not be ordering from Chef of India again, and I certainly hope that the management team is able to resolve their delivery issues, as the present status has me extremely concerned that there's an issue with the long-term viability and quality of this company.

If you are not used to that stick with the mildly spiced items or make sure you get low spice.Another issue is the quantity of food via delivery when I got the buffet.

I called and they said it would be a long time before they could send it and they would give it to me with my next order. I said I wanted a refund for that item. They tried to talk me out of that, but I said they needed to refund money for something they did not provide.

During a weekend long tour of JC's India Square, my friends and I decided to stay close to home one night. The host/owner was warm and welcoming. The Mumbai style street appetizers were fresh, well dressed and on point. The chicken tikka masala was a bit too mild in capsicum heat and spice for my taste but this was at the request of one of my friends. The grandma's paneer was similarly mild. The goat rogan josh was rich, piquant and loyal to traditional flavor. The mango lassi and buttermilk were both divine. Four adults were pleased and full for a mere $50!

What surprised us was that mango lassi was not mentioned on the menu anywhere.  We were confused as to from where this came? Anyways, I don't like mango lassi so I really didn't care. My husband enjoyed it. Samosas were very good.  very nice and fresh.  Butter roti was good.  Garlic naan was amazingly well cooked and well made. Paneer tikka masala was very average.
