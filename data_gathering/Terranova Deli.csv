Simple, soft roll, tomatoes, oil and vinegar, a little salt & pepper, prosciutto and mozzarella. The fresh mozzarella made it awesome. The creamy mozz offset by the salty prosciutto and the tang of the vinegar. I'm having a moment here! You have to know I'm coming back!",Terranova Deli,5.0 star rating,$,Delis

I've been living in the heights since 2000 and I could never really get any breakfast sandwiches or great deli sandwiches. We have 2 great Italian Deli's but terranova is very well rounded with their menu and is a true deli. The people are great and service is phenomenal. Delivery is super quick, I totally recommend this deli for anyone looking for a New York type deli! You will not be disappointed. I just wish they were opened earlier, I would love to have their breakfast before going to work. There hours are from 9am to 9pm.",Terranova Deli,5.0 star rating,$,Delis

Terranova Deli seems to use good quality ingredients and what they do better than some of the other local spots is accept credit cards and have a quick delivery service.",Terranova Deli,5.0 star rating,$,Delis
