He doesn't just slap his name on this eatery and call it a day, however. He was actually there working the grill.Burgers weren't horribly priced. $6.50 for a regular burger with lettuce tomato and onions, up to about $9.50 for more elaborate burgers. I got the Kentucky burger which also had delicious pulled pork on top of it. They also have a lobster roll for $16.50 which was out of my price range, but I saw someone eating it and it looked great.My only complaint was that they were stingy with the napkins. I got one napkin for two burgers (one for my wife and me) and the kid behind the counter was confused as to why that wasn't enough.You can find On the FlipSide at the Garden Street Mews Hoboken Family Famers Market (I know, that's a mouthful) every Saturday in the summer. Pair your burger up with a fresh limeade concoction from Lizz's Limeade a few stands down. The cucumber and basil infused limeade was amazing.",On the FlipSide,4.0 star rating,$,"Hot, Dogs,, Street, Vendors,, Burgers"
