There was just one other table (it was early...like 6:15) and I received my food very quickly after ordering from the little kiosk. I got the chicken flat top platter with the cracked wheat and shepard's salad.  The chicken was awesome, great flavor and very juicy. The cracked wheat reminded me of mexican rice, a tiny bit oily with a light tomato flavor, it delightful all on its own. I'd skip the shepard's salad next time, it was just too onion-y for me (but I'm not a huge raw onion fan). The yogurt cucumber sauce was delicious and the bread was pretty good, nothing overly special but good with the meat and sauce.I don't have access to a refrigerator, but I could have easily saved half for lunch tomorrow.

Smoothies, salads, falafel, fries, eat in or take away, or delivered quickly to your door. If you want fast, fresh, local, high quality, affordable, delicious, home made, and spot on - this is your spot!! Flat bread grill is owned by three local women (literally they live down the street) who developed and executed this concept at their first location in the nj burbs.  They brought their spot to Hoboken to be closer to home and capture a growing market. This is the kind of place I LOVE to support, a small business that cares about their food, cares about their customers, and cares about their community.  These women built the grill from the ground up and work extremely hard to keep the quality consistently amazing.  They have taken falafel to the next level. I have been following flatbread grill online and since their days in Montclair - and I'm a huge fan because their Pitas are the most amazing ever!  Plus Watching these women entrepreneurs come into their own via their web-series has been such an endearing journey I feel connected to!  I have traveled all over the world to turkey and the middle east as well, and I've never had more flavorful middle eastern food than just right at home at flatbread.  It's funny how sometimes when you're up early you might see trucks delivering daily supplies of bread or frozen stuff to restaurants.  Well you won't find that at flatbread grill bc they are literally up at 3 am every day Home making all the breads!! Also this place is a vegans dream or anyone who is a micromanager about their ingredients.  You can control everything here and their menu is allergy friendly, extremely clear, and very well thought out.

One of the new places I had yet to try, was the new Flatbread Grill and I was really excited since Pita Grill has been slacking lately (which is unfortunate because I used to love their rice bowls). Clean and modern interiors, rightfully so because its new. There is a self-serve kiosk if you don't require any accommodations to your meal, which is nice. I came in super early for dinner (5pm) so there was only 1 other patron. The piattas (pita) and thumb bread are made fresh daily and are delicious! I ordered the Shepard's salad then added beef and a side of the yogurt-cucumber sauce just to try it. It took a little less than 10 minutes for my food to come out and just by looking at it, I could tell how fresh it was. The beef was hot - right off the grill, the salad was refreshing and not wilted at all. The meat was tender and flavorful, and the salad was light and filling. I got a whole wheat piatta on the side to dip with the yogurt sauce, and it was perfect. Not too heavy.For the amount and quality of the food, the value is great and it's a necessary addition to this, otherwise lackluster, mid-town strip of Washington Street. Very much looking forward to my next trip.",Flatbread Grill,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Turkish,, Middle, Eastern"

Fast casual where you use a touch screen kiosk to place your order (in-store).  Marinated grilled chicken was fantastic as are the sauces. Both piatta and thumb bread are great. Shepard salad is the pico-de-gallo of this cuisine. Really good.  Everything seems to be cooked and prepared fresh to order, which is nice. Cons: they seem to LOVE to nickel & dime you for everything, and the side dish quantities are quite small for the price they demand. Not a very friendly or warm place. They also seem pushy (desperate) to franchise their business, which they aren't ready for in my opinion.",Flatbread Grill,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Turkish,, Middle, Eastern"

I ordered the rice platter and this comes with 2 options (whole wheat rice or white rice). I got the whole wheat rice platter with falafels, pita bread, french fries, with green tahini sauce. The falafels were a little overcooked in my opinion, it was good but the texture was a little rough for falafel and it didn't taste as fresh as I would've liked. I was a fan of the tahini sauce and the hot sauce it came with (tasted similar to frank's red hot but better). I did not try the chickpea salad but that looked really good.

This means they did not deliver the order i had placed last 5 times!

I also find that the portions are very small for the prices that they are charging.   They are extremely cheap to the point of petty with regard to Bread and Sauce. For the prices that you are charging it is insane that you charge extra for a small amount of extra sauce.

I like Mamouns, but you need to really be in the mood for that much spice. This was not overpowering and all of the flavors in the tender rice and hummus went well. They make their own pita which was delicious. I'm used to the pita in the bag from Damascus (nothing against them), but this was so much better. You can taste the olive oil in the crust and it was a little crispy. My only complaint is that the platter only came with one pita. I will order an extra next time which will hopefully be soon.

Had the veggie pita pocket with their hot sauce and a 3-piece side of falafel with their ""green tahini.""  Food was fresh, decently prepared, and rather bland, which unfortunately a lot of people seem to think it must be to be healthy. Not sure what was 'green' about the tahini, thought there were some little flecks in it that might have been dill.  No noticeable tahini taste. Mild and inoffensive, a little like watered-down mayo.   Pita bread was fresh with a slightly different texture than I'm used to. Unfortunately something in the sandwich made it soggy on the bottom (maybe the dressing?). It might have tasted OK but I have an aversion to wet bread for any reason so tore it off.  Falafels were pretty good.  Hot sauce actually had a little kick to it, which was a pleasant surprise considering how bland the rest of the food was.Pricing is not the same in the print menu as online. (There are 2 online versions of the menu on the website, one on the page itself and a downloadable PDF.)  The PDF has the highest prices (so of course that's what I was charged): $7.25 for the veggie pita and $3.50 for a side order of 3 pieces of falafel.  The online menu on the web page (not the PDF) and the print menu--which is right there on the counter so you'd think they'd be aware of this--gives the prices as $7.00 and $2.00, respectively.  So it was annoying to be charged more than that.  And sloppy that the 3 aren't in sync.",Flatbread Grill,4.0 star rating,$$,"Mediterranean,, Turkish,, Middle, Eastern"
