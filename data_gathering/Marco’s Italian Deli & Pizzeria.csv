1,xTEtfWlrAH5T3Fgn6ncdeg,Sara H.,2.0 star rating,"Given the high rating on both Yelp and Seamless, I was excited to try this pizza place.  We ordered a meatball pizza, margherita pizza, and mozzarella salad.  The meatball pizza was standard and edible, but nothing out of the ordinary.  The margherita pizza looked like someone dumped an entire container of oregano all over it.  First, margherita should be simple and be focused on basil. But more importantly, there should never be this much seasoning dumped on any pizza - I could only smell oregano the second it was delivered.  To top it off, the mozzarella in the salad (caprese, not lettuce salad) was rubbery and had no flavor.
