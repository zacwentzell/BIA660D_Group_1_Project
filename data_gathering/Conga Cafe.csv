I must say I've never been to Ricky's because it looked so dated from the outside. When my husband and I first walked in we were pretty surprised how refreshing the decor and ambiance appeared to be. They have lunch specials 11-3pm Monday thru Friday. We wanted to try a couple of things so we stuck to the small plates. We ordered camarones al alijo, pástelon, empanada sampler, chichArron de pollo, arepa con ropa vieja and papa rellena. I must say they were all delicious my favorite was the arepa con ropa vieja and the pástelon so full of flavor. As drinks I had a coconut mojito which was such a treat. Not too sweet or overwhelming. Also had a cucumber mojito that was really refreshing. Can't wait to go back and try more! Definitely recommend! FYI-they also do fun events for customers. They had salsa classes with a live band on Thursday! So it's a great experience overall!",Conga Cafe,4.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, Latin, American"

However, the bartender, Rob, is really attentive and friendly. He also makes a really great coconut mojito.  Service was A+++ Overall, I give this place 3 stars. It's a restaurant... the food should be a lot better. There are a lot of Cuban restaurants in the area with a similar menu, but with better quality food and flavors.  On a positive note, the decor is quite lovely and the service was impeccable.",Conga Cafe,4.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, Latin, American"

The drinks are always tasty and the food is delicious.  My favorite is the milanesa de Mimi and the paella!  We like to go on the weekends and stay late for a drink after dinner, don't be surprised to see a full room of people dancing and enjoying great live music!

3,a0f1WawCbZmmupTjSd099g,Jadira Q.,4.0 star rating,"I definitely see why this place has such high ratings...The second you walk in you are taken back by the pretty decor.  The place is nicely laid out with long tables by the wall and windows and as you go towards the back there is a mix of high tables and low tables by the bar area.  There is usually live music in that section but when we went Saturday afternoon so we didn't get to experience it.We chose the high table and then started to take a look at the menu.  Everything looked amazing and the smell of the food that was being prepared had us salivating!   We started with a pitcher of Red Sangria while one of our male friends who is obsessed with Mimosa opted for his orange juice and champagne instead and we also got appetizers.For appetizers we just ordered some Tostones that where perfectly fried, cripsy and thin along with Chicharron de Pollo.  These were actually really good because they were chunks of golden breaded chicken and had really great flavor. It reminded me more like Masitas de Pollo.  The portions were not that big for all 4 of us but we were saving our appetite for the entrees anyway lolFor our entrees we got the Salmon with Mashed Potatoes, the Churrasco, the Vaca Frita (Pan seared shredded flank steak sauteed with onions) and the Bistec de Palomilla (Marinated sirloin with caramelized onions).  I had the Bistec de Palomilla and I thought it lacked a little flavor but it was still good.  I tasted the Vaca Frita and yeah I should have definitely ordered that instead.  It was full of flavor and it was not overly fried where it was super crispy and I thought I tasted something sweet in it.  Everyone else really liked their meals.From the Kids Menu, we also got the chicken with fries.  Fries were amazing and we kept picking from this poor boys plate lol and the chicken was more like Strips of Chicken Milanese.  Great flavor nonetheless.Only disappointment was the black beans.  They were a bit too watery and the portion was small.  I'm use to them being a bit thicker in consistency but overall we were satisfied with our meals.The waitress was also super patient with us while we were placing our order and because the Mimosa took so long to come out, she came back with two.I would definitely return to try some more of their dishes and see how it would be for dinner and the live music :)",Conga Cafe,4.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, Latin, American"

I had the ropa vieja and tostones (substituted the rice) and my friend had the masitas de puerco with tostones as well. We loved both plates! Kind of filling but could be bigger in my opinion. Overall loved it. And we tried the classic mojito, coconut mojito, the strawberry lemon mojito and the passion fruit mojito!

A small dining area and bar to the left of the entrance for those looking for some intimate date night spots. We sat in the larger room off to the right. Looks like it could be good for groups. For drinks we had a 1/2 carafe of the house sangria. Just enough for about 2 glasses each & not to sweet at all.An appetizer was shared between us called  a conga sampler. It was a combination of small bites of empanadas, croquettes, tiradito and sautéed chorizo. Quite tasty.Main courses. Wifey tried & enjoyed the boneless chicken breast in a garlic sauce accompanied with a side of Moros. I ordered a seafood dish called paella conga. Portions are large for dinner at least. Neither one of us was able to finish off our meals. Prices are very reasonable. They even give you the check in empty cigar boxes. Parking is not a problem anymore with a added lot across the street.

Let me start off by saying how attentive and genuinely friendly everyone we came in contact with, the waiters, hostess, managers! My husband and I were indecisive if we wanted to wait or sit at the bar for drinks or dine in while we waited for another couple to meet us for dinner. They have a small wait area and while we waited our friends cancelled on us so we decided we'll just hit the bar. The hostess gladly escorted us to the bar. Not bad! Normally restaurants would give you the sly eye and have you fetch your own bar seat. Perfect, we sat at the bar and ordered two drinks, coconut mojito and CHA CHA CHA... both were YUMMMMY... Coconut mojito is a DESSERT IN GLASS!! Food: we ordered a steak quesadilla and my husband ordered garlic chicken with rice and red beans... (sorry the pics may not do it any justice but trust and believe it was delicious) the chicken as was the steak were both incredibly tender and flavorful.

43,ornb1UYCzFd2u9Y_ldGvPA,Nicole R.,5.0 star rating,"Union City aka ""Little Havana"" has finally added another Cuban gem to its town.  What makes this location a hit is where it is located.  Downtown UC (if familiar with the area) does not offer a lot of good quality restaurants especially in the Cuban food department.  Conga Cafe decided to open where it was needed most.Let's start with the decor which gives off such a classy feel as you walk up the steps.  Upon our arrival, we were greeted by a pleasant hostess who seated us into the main dining area.  I didn't have the chance to go for a tour but did peak around and notice the Cuban accents and wide open area.  It screams ""Havana"" when you really take in the bright colors and lighting.  For an appetizer we ordered the empanadas.  They were all really good.  I was a little surprised by how tiny they were in comparison to other places I have been to.  It was definitely a perfect order for 2-3 people.  Any more you would need another order.  I came to Conga Cafe for lunch so I have yet to try their dinner menu.  I ordered a chicken sandwich for $5.95.  The toppings included are lettuce, tomatoes, and onions.  They do not fail to leave out any important component of this really good sandwich de pollo. The fresh Cuban bread is the best part! What makes this sandwich as a standout compared to others was the bread and flavor of the chicken.  I tasted the mojo seasoning they used after every bite and was in a happy food place.  The sandwich doesn't come out pressed like a panini which is a plus because it allows you to enjoy the bread itself.I am so happy that Conga Cafe opened because it adds more to the list of local Cuban restaurants we have in the area.  This will certainly not be my last time eating here and I look forward to coming for dinner and many evenings to try out their sangria.",Conga Cafe,4.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, Latin, American"

The day I went there was a party on the second floor, and while the music seemed a little too loud, the food made up for it. I had the chicken in garlic sauce that was delicious! The beans were flavorful and the tostones so good! Staff was very nice and drinks were on point. I hope they keep up the serve and the quality of the food. The only bad thing is the valet parking. It's a small lot so unless you street park, you gotta use the valet.",Conga Cafe,4.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, Latin, American"

The town of Union City was missing the idea of a restaurant that embraces the culture but also feel ""upscale"". This is a great place to bring your family and friends; for dinner or a drink at that bar. The decor feels vintage, warm, but also comfortable. The music choice flows with the environment. Parking is simple, valet or self park. The food is amazing; the breaded chicken and the churrasco have been the best I've had. The menu is simply simple.

The decor is so unexpected that you feel like you're in a completely different area of town. Drinks (especially the coconut mojito) were amazing and the food was just awesome. You go up to the party room and now you're transported yet again to a completely different place! Very classy, super spacious, 3 bathrooms and it still smells like it's new!  I booked a surprise birthday party for my husband and we had the party just yesterday. Prices are very reasonable, and the manager was super helpful. From setup and decorating ideas to food choices, I was helped all along the way. And the party itself exceeded all of my expectations! Empanadas, croquettes, chorizo and papa rellena for appetizers-- everyone LOVED them.  Main dishes: salmon in lemon butter sauce, chicken in mushroom sauce and masitas de puerco (every time I come to this place they are ALWAYS juicy, and they delivered again!). Maduros, moros and yuca.  Dessert: flan and tres leches. All throughout the party, our glasses were never empty, everyone enjoyed their sangria and specialty drinks, and all of the servers were super nice. I highly recommend this place for a night out with your significant other or friends, and a definitely recommend it for parties! Oh and another important word: PARKING!!!

My friend & I had a hard time listening to each other other towards the end of the night. Then I was disappointed at the sangria pitcher..waay too small for a pitcher... it shouldn't be called that...it was an en extra large glass...& $12 each!

My dish was tasty as well but my yuca portion was literally one piece. Waited 30 min to place appetizer order. Than another 30 min to place entree order. We had a party of 7 had to ask for bread after 30 min of sitting. Once we got bread the pieces were counted. Not enough bread for all of us. Service was non existent. Waitress was overwhelmed. Place was very busy making plenty of money. The establishment can certainly afford to hire more staff. Waited 45 min for dessert. Was not going to complain about anything  but the dessert was the final strike. Went to the owner and told her I was waiting 30 min for my dessert and then had to wait another 15 min afterwards for dessert. No apology given about poor service. This is my first time posting a bad review about a business. We eat out all the time have had good and bad experiences have never posted a bad review. Food was not bad. Service was the worst I've ever had. Gratuity was already included in bill. Was not completely servers fault. Management was poor and not aware of situation. Once again food was not the issue.

I appreciated their enthusiasm and helpfulness. Food was very tasty.  My group shared so I got to try - Guacamole with marequillas (sp? It's basically long plantain chips). Guac was perfect.  Just the right amount of acidity and chunky but with a smoothness.   - Flan was creamy with a light sweetness.  Not as sweet as Dominican flans (I prefer less sweet).  Wish it had a touch more of the syrup. Also, it was a bit more thick than flans I'm used to.  - Piccadillo was very tasty. Not overly salted (like a lot of Spanish places that serve this dish)  - Rice - shiny and delicious- Black beans - good texture but no outstanding flavor or defining feature.  Parking - they recently started renting the lot across the street so now they have 2 lots for free parking.   I had read a review here that they have valet parking but the staff said they do it sometimes on the weekends and when they do, it's free of charge.

There has to be a best restaurant in the area, this is it.   I rarely write long reviews, but this place was fantastic.  From beginning to end, let's start;Parking - more than ample, about a dozen right in front of the restaurant.  Another 30-40 spots immediately across the street, and I was told there was even more parking around the bend.  Entrance - very inviting, the staff and greeter were very amiable.  Atmosphere - Music was at a perfect level and it was Cuban themed, just as you would suspect.  I can only assume that it went back as far as the 1940's, but I can assure you it played all the way to present day.  Very good mix.  The décor was superb.  The street scene in the main dining area is actually 3D.  It was Saturday, early evening, so I did not know how much better the night would be.Drinks and Appetizers - My wife raved about the Mojitos, and they were very good.  I ended getting one of my own.  The Appetizer menu was very generous.  I settled on the pastelon (a favorite of mine since childhood) and it was spot on authentic.  My wife could not resist on trying the garlic shrimp and loved it.  Meal - The plates were plenty big.  My daughter is very critical of Ropa Vieja, on this day she said in no uncertain terms ""This is the best Ropa Vieja I've ever had"".  Enough said about that.  I had to try the Masitas de Puerco (sautéed pork chunks, again a favorite since childhood).  It was authentic beyond words.  I had always had it with white rice, I decided to go with the moro this time and it a good choice.  My wife went with Milanesa de mima,, I grabbed a mouthful just to test, it was great as well.  Halfway through the meal, the crowd started picking up, and alas live music from the part of the restaurant I did not explore.  A good solid crowd dancing the night away, singing to the music.  A happy scene.  The music was great as well.Dessert - This is where we should have slowed down, but we decided to plow ahead.  My wife went for the Flan de mama beba.  She said it was as good or better than any she has had in the past.  High praise.  I wanted to be strong, but the menu hit my weakspot, Tres Leche.  Very good, I lived in Miami and had become used to the quality of  this dish as made by the Cubans.  It was better than many of the places in Miami.  Like I started off saying, this place is max-review all the way.  Now that my work brings me into the area, I will try a lunch every now and again.  I am sure it will be good.",Conga Cafe,4.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, Latin, American"

82,L6jnoxDu-saoL4Q9GhT1Og,O G.,1.0 star rating,"We went to Conga Cafe in Union City tonight for the first time and I must say that I rarely write a review, but felt I had to this time.  The restaurant: nice, with valet parking, which is always a plus.  So we get seated where I guess is considered the main seating area.  There were two separate parties consisting of approximately 20 people in each party, with unruly kids running around with balloons around us, ( at that point we should've left), but my husband wanted to give them a try.  I asked to be moved to their other room which is smaller and away from the parties and was told that all the tables were reserved for 7:00 and 8:00 pm reservations, this was at 5:10pm.Drinks and food:  first a small basket of the thinnest slices of bread with the worst butter-marmalade was placed on our table, then, we ordered a small red sangria which had a bit of red wine with lots of club soda, the worst I ever had.  Now, seeing what was going on, of course I asked if the kitchen was backed up.  Our waitress, (by the way very nice young lady), checked with the kitchen and was able to tell us if we ordered right away we wouldn't have to wait long.  Without even looking at the menu I ordered the first thing that came to mind.  We both had breaded chicken steak (a la Milanesa) with tostones.  The breaded chicken although a little thin was tasty and the tostones were great!  Now my personal experience, As a former West New Yorker, I recognized the manager from town and Memorial H. S. Avelino.  His father was the owner of St. Barbara Restaurant, (best breaded steaks I ever had).  As a manager, he was quit rude as he never lifted his head to greet the customers (in this instance us), when we walked in or left. There were three other families that were seated in the main dinning room like us that walked out, something we should have also done.  He never walked to our table or any table not related to the party for that sake to ask if everything was ok.  My opinion:  as long as this guy keeps in head in his turtle shell, I don't see much business.  What should have been a relaxing dinner after a long day of worked turned out to be a dump.",Conga Cafe,4.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, Latin, American"

Ambiance was fantastic (even for a mom of a toddler) as they have a DJ that also lets you karaoke from time to time. My daughter didn't not want to leave because of the birthday chants and music provided to the celebratory guests. Lastly, I ordered a churrasco which was utter perfection but my mom ordered the BBQ ribs with the guava sauce that was to die for! Definitely coming back for MORE!",Conga Cafe,4.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, Latin, American"

The food was absolutely delicious from the amazing Drinks to the delicious Tapas, you will be extremely satisfied.  The minute I got there, I was nicely greeted. The waiter Andy was truly serviceful and a true gentle to all myself but most important my female friends. The owner was very friendly and made sure we were enjoying ourselves. As a group we were able to see the upstairs party lounge and looked extremely classy. Planning our Welcome back party here for sure. Lastly,  I highly recommend this place.....go visit you wont regret it.",Conga Cafe,4.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, Latin, American"

We waited about 15 mins for water to get poured in our glasses, another 20 mins for an appetizer....bartender never apologized for spoiled drink, the lady playing music was having a loud conversation on the phone on how she was losing clients and would sporadically loudly ""check her mic""Never again....",Conga Cafe,4.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, Latin, American"

The place doesn't seem to have a lot to offer while you walk by it but it is a true latin/cuban culinary experience! Everything we tried was great and fresh. The service was great and guess what; they don't try to get you our of there before you have taken your last bite. I.e., you have to ask for the check if you want to leave :) the place has also great ambiance and it is good for any occasion really.",Conga Cafe,4.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, Latin, American"

It was always ordering takeout or having to pay for an overpriced dining experience in Hoboken, but now (FINALLY) there is something worth going to nearby! This place is just awesome in every possible way. From the greeters/waiters/bartenders to the decorations, music, food options, and drinks, I'm in love! I've gone about 7 times in the last 2 months and have recommended so many co-workers and neighbors to it and they all agree! The employees are so catering and it's super affordable! The portions are very generous and I always have leftovers for the following day, so you definitely get even more of your money's worth. They even have a parking lot so you don't have to worry about finding parking, making it so much more convenient and enjoyable to go out to eat here. Overall, I think it's an amazing addition to Union City and I can only hope others follow these owners in creating such a beautiful, delicious, and affordable restaurant in Union City!Pictured is a picture of the Guava Sangria and Mama's Beba Flan",Conga Cafe,4.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, Latin, American"

Maduros wrapped in bacon and shrimp in garlic sauce were delicious.  The churrasco with rice and black beans were also very good.  Love the feel and look of this place and the service was exceptional.  Our waiter Raul was awesome and several people that came by to make sure everything was ok (owners and even the hostess) were extremely nice.  Lastly, the cigar box as a holder for the check was an excellent touch.  My family loved it and we look forward to eating here again!",Conga Cafe,4.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, Latin, American"

We decided to celebrate my FIRST Mother's Day here . What. A HUGE mistake !!! We made a reservation for 4 pm for 9 people . We were sitted by 4:15 , it's now 6:19 we placed our dinner orders at 5:20 because the waiter didn't want to take our orders before because he was busy . Granted he said he had 3 other big tables . The waiter is walking in circles doing NOTHING . Still sitting here they said it would be another 20 minutes for food .. I would have walked out but I'm with my parents and family and do NOT want to ruin this evening even more .",Conga Cafe,4.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, Latin, American"

I think this was the old Ricky's Frontier Steak House but they transformed it into a trendy , modern Cuban restaurant with two floors. I like the set up and flow of the place and I know on weekends they have the live music playing. Since discovering the spot, I've been here a couple of times.

The skirt steak was tasty and tender, cooked to perfection.  But what I was most impressed with was their guava and cheese empanada.  OMG!! If you come here you NEED TO have those. The ambiance was also on point.  The place is clean, the music is just loud ""enough"" where you heard it but you can also have a conversation.  The staff was very friendly, and the hostess came around several times to make sure everything was to our liking. I will be going back.",Conga Cafe,4.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, Latin, American"
