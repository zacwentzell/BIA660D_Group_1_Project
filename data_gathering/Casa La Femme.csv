Unfortunately, it snowed the night of our visit and a number of friends canceled at the last minute, but the group of us who attended had a very nice time.I don't know how thrilled the birthday girl and her family were with the second table being taken away due to the cancellations, especially since they had already paid for that number of attendees.  We could have used some extra room because were were shoehorned in pretty tightly. I think there were about 15 of us all together, and had one long table placed up against one of the corner, circular booths. The food was served family style with large platters that were brought out by servers. They would put things on everyone's plate and then leave the rest on the table so we could pick. The appetizers alone were very filling. I loved the chicken, the lamb chops were great, and the hummus & baba ghanouj were nicely done. One of the appetizers was a crab cake that was put on my plate before I could ask if it had crab, so I was a little ticked about that. I tried to ask and the server walked away. The woman next to me tasted it, said ""yeah, it's crab.""  I can handle my allergy but give me a second to ask. The nurse sitting across from me grabbed my plate and handed me her clean plate in exchange. We were told the belly dancers would be out at 9 but they didn't go on until sometime between 10:30 & 11. Once the show started you really couldn't leave because you'd be in the way, so I felt a bit captive at that point. The guy in charge said it was because of the snow but someone else said this happens all the time - they wait for the place to fill up with a late-drinking crowd.So, food is good, management seems a bit disinterested, I won't judge based on how they did or didn't handle the party since the birthday lady's family was handling that, and it does look like a nice place for a romantic time out. I'd go again, I think, but there are other Middle Eastern places I like more.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

On my last visit, they were very accommodating when I needed to switch the time of my reservation. However, they told me that the belly dancer would be coming at a specific time, so I booked my reservation around that.

Since I have been told over the phone several times that the performance  is at a specific time every night, I wondered if they delayed her dancing, in order to get more tips. Which leads me to my next point:Warning : highly recommend coming without children. It's a quiet, Romantic vibe here, with a nightly belly dance show that can include quite an eyeful, and the dancer usually has dollar bills tucked into her skirt/belt... fine for adult audiences, but I prefer not to have little ones getting into the habit of tipping dancing girls a dollar at a time.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

Cons: I made a reservation, and still had to wait nearly 10 minutes before I was seated... despite the place being empty. Be prepared to pay for basic things... such as still water (that should come to the table free of charge because it's from the tap), and pita. Another con is I was handed a prix fixe menu when an a la carte menu was available. I feel like the entire time I was trying to be upsold on everything I asked about on the menu. This is not the experience I was expecting... and not in a good way. There is a relatively good variety of menu options. I'm vegan so it's difficult to eat out sometimes... I suggest asking for the yogurt sauce (garnish) be removed from mezza platters. As beautiful as the ambiance and authentic decor is, I probably will not visit again.

Belly dancing every night at 9.30pm or so. Carlos the manager made our night special by being very attentive to our needs. We had the 4 course Prix Fixe Menu.  Starter was the trio of mezzos of hummus, babaganoush and fuul medames. All were great but loved the babaganoush and hummus the best.Appetizers were crabmeat kofta and felfel mashi. Both were flavorful and tasty. Loved both but the crabmeat kofta was my favorite.Entrees were salmon mashway and samek mashway which was the branzino. The branzino was definitely my favorite. It was cooked with onions tomato and basil. So light and flaky it melted in your mouth. Salmon was excellent too.Egyptian style french fries are a must try. They are seasoned with sumac which is out of this world.We also got the basboussa and baklava for dessert. Baklava was light and crispy.

VERY sketchy, and even as we were getting up another waitress tried to make us stay and order dessert and after we said no we saw her leave and whisper something to the manager.

It was Monday so we were seated immediately & their Egyptian canopy style tables were very elegant, made us feel like we were in our own little VIP section. The 4 course meal was a tad confusing at the beginning, but it was more then enough food. They were all presented well. The waiter allowed us to have happy hour prices even though we were not eating at the bar also a PLUS, especially since they were cheat with the alcohol  I had the chicken dish which was delicious, but for next time I'll be having the brown rice my mom had with her dish (yummmmm) Overall great ambience, scrumptious baklava (though portions were too small) & waiters that knew the food well.

As soon as we sat down the waitress was annoying and kept trying to make us buy and order more than what we wanted (she even told us to stop ordering pita for our mezzas because then we won't order entrees)....and then we saw them charge another table for extra items that were actually supposed to be on our bill, and the other table didn't notice....but we ended up having to pay for our items anyway so the restaurant made double. VERY sketchy, and even as we were getting up another waitress tried to make us stay and order dessert and after we said no we saw her leave and whisper something to the manager. I just got a weird vibe after leaving there and I don't think I'll go back again, which is a shame because the food was decent.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

The service is quick. The waiters were always around and the food came out quick. The food was great and delicious. The bread was amazing. In fact we had so much food that we couldn't finished everything. We had the pre-fixed menu. I am a vegetarian and my date got the chicken. The belly dancer was really good and she danced around to every table individually and even encouraged some diners to dance with her. Parking was easy.

54,WlqGTB2iv7bgyikWzCA0-g,Yesenia R.,1.0 star rating,"I really really wanted to fall in love with this place, but actually feel ripped off. I made a reservation though open table for 6pm because they claimed they had a belly dancer show at 7:15pm and 9:15pm. Took my friend to the 2pm show of Aladdin for her birthday and said there no better place to take her for dinner than to this place that fits the theme. First they kept changing the time of my reservation throughout the three weeks. Then yesterday before arriving we called to confirm the show time. They said yes at 7:15. When you arrived you fall in love with the atmosphere of the place. Everything is lovely and elegant, its very romantic. We had asked to sit under one of the tents. In order to sit there you have to get the pre-fix 4 course meal for $60. Which sounds like a bargain but its not because almost everything we ordered had a surcharge. First it took about 25 minutes to get to order drinks, mine you they only had another couple there. Second the drinks taste like you were chewing on a lime had to ask to change it to another drink and they kept sending the wrong one back. The Pita and spread were delicious. 40 minutes later we got the apps. Both very tiny and definitely not worth it. The main course was decent but nothing out of this world but we are still waiting to be amazed by the show. Finally i gave up and asked the waiter when was it gonna start since it was well past the time of the first show. He looked at me confused and said ""the first show starts at 9:15 but I will get the manager to come talk to you"". When he came it was the same person who told us the show would start at 7:15. He said the dancer had a hard time getting to work and that it has to be cancelled. Complete bull. Since they were not busy enough they decided to cancel as a friend who goes there a lot let me know. They only do the show when they have a full house. Then to top it all off the waiter asked if we really wanted our last course which was desert. YES didn't we have to get a four course meal. Definitely not worth it for a 230 dollar dinner. Portions are small. The staff take 30-40 minutes between coming to your table.

As I was chewing the second bite of our order of squid I suddenly feel a poke in my cheek. I reach into my mouth and pull out not one but two thin pieces of shredded metal, about a toothpick in length and thickness. I immediately walk into the restaurant and inform the manager. He hands me a napkin and asks me to give it to him so he can go to the kitchen and check it out (I have zero clue what this was supposed to accomplish). A few minutes later he returns and informs me that he checked the kitchen, that nothing is amiss in there and that this metal must have fallen from the construction platforms overhead us (seriously how dumb do you think we are?). Furthermore, he proudly states that they have taken the squid off our bill (no kidding buddy, we ate four bites of it and sent it back, do you seriously think you're doing us a favor by taking it off the bill?). I ask him if that's the only thing he is going to take care of due to our experience, and he says yes; the conversation ends shortly after. My friend and I sit and stew for a few minutes about how inappropriate a response that is, and then my friend walks in to see if he can talk some sense into the manager. Shortly after the manager returns and says he will take off 25% of our bill. I laugh in his face and tell him no thanks, you guys clearly need it so just bring us the full bill and we will be on our way. His response is to request that we both put our 3/4 full drinks down and leave the property, and that if we do so he will not ask us to pay. I reply that I would love to do so, and stand up to walk away. At this point the manager walks up to me and starts accusing me of lying to him and scamming them. I got so upset and flustered at this accusation that I forgot to remind him that I *JUST* offered to pay 100% of the bill in response to his 25% discount offer, and basically just started yelling at him about how dare he etc etc. I've never been treated so rudely by a manager at any restaurant and have certainly never been accused of trying to scam a restaurant for a bill (a $60 check, no less). TLDR: found multiples pieces of sharp shredded metal in our order of squid. Manager tried to pretend the metal fell out of the sky and had nothing to do with his kitchen. First refuses to comp anything, then offers 25% off, I decline and say I'd rather pay the full bill, he then kicks us out of the restaurant and questions my integrity several times, outright calling me a scammer to my face.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

Getting hookah along with dinner just added to the Egyptian  atmosphere. The drinks were sweet, maybe would just stick to wine next time. We asked the waiter when the belly dancer was back on and he said 12 which we were out and done before 12 so we didn't get to see her total full performance. They charge for water which we weren't aware of and also change for extra pita bread. Would of been nice to know that prior to the check.

They seemed to be a bit short staffed which was strange for a restaurant on a weekend. Nevertheless, the first course appetizers were great! The babagonoush is literally to die for! I would definitely recommended this place for vegetarians. I had a salad for the second course appetizer. It was nothing to write home about. The belly dancer came on at 10PM and she was amazing! So gorgeous and talented! She came over to our table and danced with my friend. She did a great job making her feel special on her birthday. The entree part wasn't so great for me. I ordered the tagine khodar which comes with couscous and a vegetable stew and all was well until about 5 minutes into eating it. I felt so sick that I wanted to pass out. There was definitely something in there that didn't agree with me. We took dessert to go as we were in a rush. Overall, I probably wouldn't come here again as I don't really feel as though I got my money's worth.

First it was 150 dollars a head. Flat fee- pre fixe - standard new york city overpriced BS. We are used to this. But when we arrived to the mostly empty restaurant they sat my 6 foot 4 inch boyfriend and I at what can only be described as a toddler sized table. We arrived at 730 pm. They bring out a basket of bread and a very small cup of hummus. By 8:30 they had failed to bring out any of our actual food. Fail number one. The waiter was insistent and pushy about us ordering drinks, not included in the ridiculous price. He kept trying to guilt my boyfriend into getting wine etc . It was embarrassing. After several no thank you's he tried to guilt us again when i finally shut it down and ordered a hot tea.  We don't drink. Fail 2Finally our appetizers come out- child sized portions- of course because new york. But mine - the vegetarian option was at least hot. My poor boyfriends meat skewers were like icicles on a stick. He was so hungry at this point that he just ate it.Then they cleared our tiny table which was so small we had to finish our tea hastily to make room for the food we were waiting over an hour for. Then we wait some more. 15 minutes go by and the waiter comes over confused as to why we havent had our main course. They bring it out. Mine again is fine, my poor boyfriends is two ice cold lobster tail halves and a fist sized portion of cold pasta.

The salad is a tiny lump of shaved carrot with lemon - $13. The crab cake was the tiniest I've ever seen and tasted more like shrimp, yet was $15 for 1???? The service was terrible. The moment we asked for an a la carte menu, the server gave us attitude. He didn't even bring us 1 for everyone - just 1 for the table. Idiot. I tried to be patient and understanding but he was a jackass who didn't fill our water and it was too hot in there. If a restaurant is that expensive the service should be impeccable. It was the worst. I ended up spending $70 and didn't leave full. The only thing I liked was the lamb. But still... $30 for three tiny pieces and no sides???? There are so many amazing restaurants in the city with great service and vibes... I'll never go back here again. Do yourself a favor and go to souvlaki gr instead which has good food, great prices, beautiful atmosphere.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

The pita bread was fresh and on point; however the main courses were the issue. now people come for the lamb chops but I warn you not to come here for the lamb chops. The Lamb Chops were dry and boring!!! The chicken tasted simple for the price you would think it should blow your mind unfortunately that didn't happen!!

77,X0vI4_AEUtvBdL9EecWp6g,Laura R.,3.0 star rating,"Came here on March 26 as part of a group of 7 people.  The manager was extremely accommodating considering our group was an hour late.  My first complaint which isn't a big deal is that they pushed 2 tables together to accommodate our group but they were two different tables that were not the same height so that was a little odd.  The food was really tasty.  Nothing was spicy though.  We had a Groupon for a 4 course pre-fixed meal which was really only 2 courses.  The first course was warm pita bread with 3 different dipping sauces.  That should have just been a given.  Most places have some form of bread on the table while you wait for your meal.  That shouldn't have been considered ""a course.""  For my second course I had the Crabmeat Kofta (lump crabmeat, shrimp, leeks and scallions).  You taste more shrimp than crab.  Tasty either way.  Third course I had the Grilled Whole Fish of the day (Branzino).  Very tasty and meaty.  Nothing else was on the plate.  Just the fish.  Honestly would it have killed them to put a tiny portion of starch and/or vegetable on the plate?  I didn't stay for dessert but I heard it was 3 little mini ""something's"" that should not have been considered a course.The belly dancer was awesome!  On Saturday nights the belly dancer performs at 7:30 and then again at 9:30.  I would say her performance is about 30 minutes long.  She really engages with the crowd.  She moves through the room and invites diners to get up and dance with her by their table.  Everyone is into it.  The overall décor of this place is very romantic.  Love the bathrooms.  I would bring the hubby here if we were in the neighborhood.One last negative is that the courses took too long in between one another.  The service should have been a lot quicker.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

On September 2, 2017, I celebrated my birthday dinner at this restaurant with four girlfriends and what a blast we had!  From the moment you enter this establishment, you are entertained. The staff greets you like you are the star of the night, the bartenders and wait staff are real and engage with you the entire time!  And our dinner was incredibly tasty and like nothing I've ever tasted before!  Served hot, perfectly seasoned, insane presentation and colorful and imaginative dishes! Truly a culinary experience.  And if this wasn't enough, being a gluten free, vegan, I'm a nightmare to every wait staff so I always apologize in advance and ask them to just please make me anything that fits into this category as I don't want to be an added problem. Most places comply and throw something together, but not Casa La Femme, nope, when I asked for a dish minus the couscous, they instead replaced the couscous with delicious coconut rice...without me asking!!! And given that it was my birthday and my friends asked for a candle on  my desert, they, on their own, put a candle on a dish of fruit (which was not on the menu)!! I was so floored and touched by their attention to the smallest detail and how they went out of their way to make me, and each of my friends feel so special. Unbelievable. Now, lets get to the décor, in one word...GORGEOUS!  The restaurant design is one of which you expect I Dream of Jeanie was filmed, the grass on the floor took you out of New York City and into a vacation like setting and the bathrooms are ones like HGTV.I can't wait to go back here again and again and again.

After agreeing to a prix-fixe price over the phone, we were told that we will have to pay about 30 dollars more per head upon arrival. I would not have minded if the food was even worth 30 dollars to begin with. The food was no better than the cheap stuff served in shady hookah lounges in the East Village. Next was the service, half the table was served and the other half waited an extra 20 mins before their dishes were brought out not to mention the three wrong orders and the attitude we received when letting the server know.

Although the waiters/bus boys seem to be very trained ""by the book"", they seemed to lack common sense(if that makes sense). I was with a party of lets say 10, pre fix menu. When it was time for the main coarse everyone received their dishes. The person that sat next to me was given his food, and began to eat it. (It was suppose to be a seafood dish, which it was). It was his first time eating at the restaurant . About 15 minutes later , as most of his food was eaten either the manager or the waiter approached him accusing him of eating someone elses dish. Okay?? he did not know. In any case, this accusation was so rude , and I honestly was in shock. Although they gave the proper dish to the person which ordered it, the way they treated the person who accidently ate it was disgusting.Now the food:Dips -were okay.Chicken and rice- the chicken was bland, the rice was sour (from lemon juice?)I barely ate my food.

86,SK5P1vs-Wh_k0wNDe25dQg,Camille H.,4.0 star rating,"I've been here twice - both times on dates with different people. The first time I got to see the bellydancers perform (there were two of them) but we came on a Sunday and the restaurant was pretty much empty (maybe 2 other tables were occupied) so the atmosphere was lacking a little bit. The belly dancers did interact with us (they pulled both me and my date up at separate times and showed us a dance). The tables are arranged in a circular formation so that everyone can basically get a good view.The second time I went there were no belly dancers or show, so that was disappointing - and the restaurant was a little bit more crowded, making service a little less personalized.Both times I recall the food being good, albeit very expensive (we got the a la carte). I think the food I tried were: the baklava, crab cakes and some eggplant dish. The service was professional / fine and the bathroom was exceptionally clean and comfy. To be honest, the entire opulent decor of the restaurant is what makes this restaurant so special.Parking is really tight around here but it's a great date spot because you get to luxuriate behind curtains in your own little romantic nook.TIP: If you are on a date I'd recommend going on a romantic stroll to the water (just two or so blocks away) after dinner and making sure you book whenever the show will be on.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

When we arrived, my reservation was not in the system for some odd reason but we were still seated promptly. I reserved a tented sofa area and we were seated at a tented table instead. While we enjoyed our evening, I would have been more comfortable in a sofa area because I had planned on a more lounge-like dining experience with my group.  I also thought the sofa area was prix fixe only and the tables were a la carte or prix fixe. We sat at a tented table and were still required to order from the prix fixe menu. Not a big deal for us but I just found the menu and seating policy a little confusing. The food was great. Yes, the portions are small but the prix fixe menu included three or four courses, which ultimately filled our bellies. I would recommend the grilled octopus and the grilled branzino. Both were well-seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The décor is very exotic and romantic. The belly dancer was a lot of fun. I only wish they would extend her performance or add another dancer to the repertoire. The dancer performs for only 25 minutes during the evening. Our host and servers were very friendly. I asked them to put a candle on our dessert to help us celebrate my friend's birthday and they did.  The host was even kind enough to take a few photos  of our group before we left. I have to mention the bathrooms  because they are large and beautifully tiled.  Loved the woodwork and decore in this restaurant. Just a heads up that Casa La Femme is definitely more of a romantic restaurant than a lounge, which was my first impression after viewing its website.Overall, we had a great time and it was a good choice for group get together.

I must reiterate and add that the meat was sliced so thin there's no way they could have prevented it from becoming anything other than well done - he ordered it medium rare - I sent the slop of tomatoes and some sort of cheese back - my husband's salad was drenched in salt - oh and I forgot to mention they poured salt on his lamb as well (that's what I meant by ""saltier than corned beef"" (my husband's still drinking water - ""I'm dying of thirst,"" he just said - it was a very hot day)  ... what they called pitta isn't pitta - it was hard, crusty, impossible to dip into the tahini and babaganoush (I actually ordered their plate of 3 dips together - she only brought 2 - but when I asked her the difference in price I realized it was more expensive to buy the ""special"" than to buy these dips individually - I wanted to taste Egyptian food - this was just the same NYC ""let me rip you off"" routine - and the tahini was watered down almost to the point of being tasteless - the babaganoush was okay (i sure didn't finish it - in fact I barely ate at all (all for the price of $95) - and right - I forgot to mention the service - first there was water all over the table - I asked twice for it to be cleaned up - over appetizers and a drink the waitress asked us if we were ready for our dinner ""No, thank you - we came here to rest and talk and then watch  the sunset - ) did she hear us?

""I'm sorry,"" said the waitress, ""but the chef already made it."" That's when I told her to take the tasteless glob of some sort of cheese (minimal amount) and crushed baby tomatoes (cheap kind) ... the waitress came back and said ""the chef wants to make this salad again. He'll make it right"" - I said ""okay"" because I hadn't eaten all day and I was hungry and I wanted to be hopeful - the sun would set soon - I wanted to eat - Well, the waitress never came back with this salad she promised me - are you asking yourself if the place was busy? If she was overworked? - guess what? There were only 2 tables - us and some other unfortunate suckers who thought, as I did, that a place close to the river with velvet chairs, claiming to serve Egyptian food ... okay ""I'm sorry.

Obviously the latter is a bad sign for somewhre on a sat night in the west village.We decided to opt for the a la carte menu as other reviews had mentioned the prix fix wasn't worth it.The waiter offered us some mixed appetizers.  Big mistake.  Each one came with one piece of pitta despite us being a table of 5Its now 10 pm and we enquired about the belly dancer. She is late was the repsonse. Brilliant so lots of dips and nothing to dip with and one absent belly dancer. Now the entrees. The server suggested lamb chops as being the most popular dish and their speciality.Ok 29 bucks ain't bad but  none of the entrees come with a side , not even a slight garnish so we order a stack of sides. The lamb chops come arrive and what were supposed to be medium rare are extremely well done and charred. When they do cone back out  with med rare ones 15 mins later all the sides have already been eaten or gone cold. But the manager assures me of some rice.  Of course this never came.Finally a belly dancer appears for 2 mins and then sadly she dissapears again.

Five of us started with hummus, babaganoush and zabadi yogurt which were all great - served with large warm pieces of pita. Then we split moussaka and a vegetable tagine - both flavorful. The side of mushrooms was my favorite dish - tender, juicy and absolutely delicious.The space is huge and very cool. The front bar area is funky with grass on the floor, open air almost like a terrace setting. The back of the restaurant has lots of seating with ""tents"" lined along the wall. Loud music pumping, very crowded and has a party vibe.Negative: We received really really bad service from an extremely snobby waitress. We went here for a bachelorette dinner with reservations for a regular table but they seated us in a tent where it's a mandatory 4 course pre fixe. We weren't that hungry so when we asked if we could just order from the regular menu, the waitress gave us a really hard time about. ""Tents are pre fixe only, everyone has to order from this menu, I don't think we can sit you at a regular table here, maybe just in the front bar area blah blah"" We had reservations so only after we spoke to the hostess did the waitress magically have a regular table ready for us. (It was only 6pm super early for NYC dining so the place was pretty much empty)Like I said, we weren't very hungry so we decided to split a bunch of dishes and that was when the service took a serious turn. Our waitress literally rolled her eyes at us when we ordered making snide comments such as ""That's it? Well, if you think so. That won't be enough but whatever...""And then when we didn't order any drinks, she said ""you're not drinking?! Come on really? Aren't you out for a party??"" and rolling her eyes again.WOW. Just wow. Who was she to criticize us for splitting dishes and not wanting to drink at that time? Not that it's any of her business and we didn't need to justify our order but we already have been pre-gaming with drinks and snacks before. We wanted to take a break before partying the rest of the night.She was mad because we weren't spending enough so she could get a bigger tip. It was ridiculous as she was extremely friendly with other large tables - even holding another customer's baby. She never came to check on us, even when we were missing a dish, never refilled our water. It was as if our table didn't exist. It made for an extremely disappointing dinner. Servers should treat all table with the same courtesy no matter how much or little they spend.On our way out, we stopped to talk to the manager who was very apologetic. He took my friend's phone number to speak to her privately another time, said sorry a bunch of times and hooked us up with a free bottle of champagne and hookah. I'm glad the manager was responsive to us but am not sure if he went to speak to the waitress right away or at all (it was very busy by that point) Therein lies the mixed feelings, I enjoyed the food and it is just one waitress and the manager was responsive but I can't get over how rude she was. And in a city with so many restaurants, it doesn't make me want to head back there.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

I was so excited to take him. Being of Egyptian decent, I loved that I had a special Egyptian restaurant I could enjoy. Not much around except Steinway in Astoria. And they have nothing there to compare to this caliber of dining. I've been a patron since before they moved from their location by the 59th street bridge. What I loved then was the ambiance. I felt as if I was in a palace in the Middle East. It felt much more authentic years ago. The decor may still be the same but a lot has changed. Now it feels very gimmicky. The waitstaff was nice but there seemed to be a lot of miscommunication. First, we weren't given a water choice of tap water. Off the bat charged $8 for their fancy water. Our waiter was very attentive however. But perhaps too much. Every 5 minutes he checked on us. Tried to take dishes from us when we were still picking. We felt soooo rushed which is very disappointing considering this is not a cheap meal. We did the prifixe menu (4 courses) and were rushed through every course. We maybe had 10 min to try to enjoy each course. And while being rushed through our meals we listened to mainstream music like Justin Timberlake and Rihanna. Not exactly fits in with the beautiful tents and Egyptian decor. The only time Arabic music came on was when the belly dancer performed. Do I even mention they sat us behind a huge pillar so we couldn't fully enjoy the show?  I've recommended this place to many throughout the years. Sad to see this restaurant lose itself.

You have the option of staying int the front/bar area, with access to views of the sidewalk, or settle in on one of the dining tents in the back. The staff was accomodating and attentive. It's rare that I find myself not having to ask for our tables glasses to be refilled; Service was definitely at another level. The glasses of wine and mimosas were a welcome thirst quencher. With the level of attention and detail, the staff never missed a beat.The food was exquisite and delicious.

I read many of the bad reviews regarding the terrible service they have and trust me, they were so accurate. This place is extremely bad in some many ways:1) extremely slow and bad service2) we were sited on a corner table next to the stairs that take you to the restroom. According to the hostess, the belly dancers were supposed to come to our area (never happened)3) bad service again4) music (aside from the one played during the show) is worst than the one played in an elevator from the 80's. Seriously, consider using Pandora or Spotify but your music can really make you feel so depressed.5) after we finished our dinner, we must have waited like 45 min to get ""desserts"" and coffee (Turkish coffee that supposedly takes 15 minutes to brew due to the highest quality) that was never brought to the table but included on the check.6) desserts that my 5 year old daughter could bake way better, let's just say that a cornbread mini muffin with orange sorbet on top is not exactly something appealing.7) did I mention terrible slow service????8) after desserts, another waiting time of 45-50 minutes to get the check9) check was incorrect, so let's add another 30 minutes to finally get it......still incorrect!!!! Are u fucking kidding me???? On top of that, the waiter just limited to apologize and mentioned that he was trying his best but they were short on staff. My bad for choosing a place that is not capable of offering good service to everybody that decides to spend money on their business.10) forgot to mention that the show that we couldn't see, lasted maybe 30 minutes. We spent 4 hrs and there was only 1 show with one woman. I was expecting something else to be honest.11) we decided to asked for our coats as the waiter didn't come back to our table with the correct check. Basically he found us at the main entrance with another incorrect check.12) manager came but didn't really offer any solution and we decided just to pay and leave.We went to this place because some friends got a Groupon.

It was such a bummer and we spent $250 on bland food.  Not the same ambiance without the music and dance. Try it on Saturday otherwise go somewhere else.

Since my birthday was just a couple months later and it seemed like a place to celebrate a special event, I decided to have my family birthday dinner at CLF. My party of 4 came here on a Friday evening and the place was completely empty when we arrived. We were not asked what type of table we preferred but we were seated at a lovely tented table which we were happy with, until we later found out (after we had already eaten and thought that the prix fixe was the only option they had) that the tented tables are prix fixe only and you can order a la carte at regular tables. While you get a lot for what you are paying, my party and I would have greatly preferred the a la carte menu as I wanted to get a bunch of appetizers rather than one appetizer and a main course (I am a vegetarian and did not like any of the options they had for the main course). I was finally able to eat the falafel I had come here for and while delicious, I was so disappointed that only two falafel balls came with the appetizer. The restaurant did not start filling up until after 8 pm, when we were nearly finished, and we found out that the belly dancing would not start until 9:15 pm. I was SO disappointed by this as one of the major reasons I chose this as my birthday spot was because the ambiance looked amazing, however we never got to experience it. I would like to come back later at night just to get a feel of what it's like when the restaurant is actually busy and to hopefully order from the a la carte menu to get more falafel, but my first experience here was a bust.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

The service was slow and the dancer came over for a total of 30 seconds to collect a dollar at the end of the dinner. The entertainment was not worth it.The food was one of the worst meals I've had in a long time. First, let me start with the fact that they MAKE you get a pre-fix menu for parties of (6?) and more. The bill came to over 100 dollars a person for HORRIBLE food. Second, do NOT get items that are marked up extra on the menu. For example, why did I pay 5 dollars extra for a chewy rubbery borderline inedible octopus? Why did I pay extra for dry/fatty lamb chops? Some in our party got ""well-done"" salmon which came out medium with a gallon of salt pored all over it. I don't even want to mention dessert because it was gross.This was a god awful experience.

It made the stay very enjoyable. As for the food, it was not mind blowing but def above average. I would have liked it better if the portions were bigger.

Many months ago I was e-introduced to the events manager at CLF by the head of Autism Speaks as a great place to host a fundraiser event. We never met up - mostly due to my schedule. Upon making reservations here for a Saturday night dinner, I reached out to the woman who had been so eager to meet. Two weeks later- no response.  Ding.We had 7 girls for dinner pre-bachelorette party. Several have strict dietary concerns. Thus,  3 times it was confirmed we were doing a la carte - not prix fixe. We were seated at a fancy corner table with the hoop and tent hanging above us. Told this was a ""special"" table. Then told by a waitress and later a manager we must do prix fixe. Um no - we must NOT do anything we confirmed multiple times. We were treated with attitude and confusion. Also, the hoop and gauze thing didn't work for us. It took 15 minutes and a lot of laughter to have the servers help clip it up so we could see each other.We went to order a bottle of champagne for the occasion. On the list was a $30 bottle and next price point was $115. Considering the fact we were already planning to order $15 cocktails (yes - $15 for no great shakes), we said we'd try the $30 bottle (and could get a few at that price). ""We don't have that in stock."" Wait, seriously? You already argued with us about the menu and table and then you have the gall to have such varying price points and not have the only one under $100? This really annoyed me.Dislikes: Lack of communication. Being treated like a 2nd class citizen (even though I am a customer). Grass carpet (stupid for stilettos as they get stuck and can see people tripping). Champagne list and price points. Fish of the day with bones all over.Like: Octopus. Scallops. Dessert.

When I go to this restaurant, I find that I am enchanted by the charming ambiance, alluring tunes, and winsome waiting staff. It is a top of the line restaurant in NYC that still makes me giddy in reminiscence. I was absolutely enthralled by the elegance, vibrancy, cocktails and cuisine at this restaurant.The first time I went, upon arrival, after maneuvering past an oval bar, I entered my oasis - the main dining area. Table seating is in the middle; however, I had preferred to crawl into the private peripheral seating areas and declare one enclave as my territory, guarded by the protective drapes. Prior to that evening, aware of this seating option, I had contemplated doing one of two things - blanketing myself in the love of a significant other for a night of indulgence OR acting as a queen on my throne, served to my desire. That night I went with my brother and father, so it's safe to say I engaged in the latter activity with ease. Not because I'm self-righteous and haughty but because the service had me feeling like royalty.On that particular evening I had a few dishes from the a la carte menu. We all started off with a cocktail and then we were served mazzas with pita bread to our liking. I order the grilled octopus as an appetizer, the Grilled Bay Scallops as an entree and had a taste of my father's branzino. We topped the meal off with the baklava for dessert.  I'll admit, the food didn't have to be mind blowing because the fully immersive experience of entertainment, cocktails, quality service and fine cuisine filled me with joy. Although Casa La Femme is pricey, it's worth every penny! Try to go when the belly dancers are performing, which I assume is either every evening or only weekend evenings. Also, the draped area seating must be reserved beforehand on a busy weekend so I'd recommend calling much earlier than your planned dinner date.For more of my personal restaurant reviews, check out my blog! thechiclush.com",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

146,IvP8j68DMD3ZYfee57DIQw,Laurel M.,1.0 star rating,"The atmosphere of this place is pretty cool! And that's the end of my positive comments about it. When my boyfriend and I arrived we were asked to wait for a table- totally understandable. But after 15-20 mins of waiting, the hostess came to get us and said we would be sat very soon that they were just waiting on the table to be cleaned and they needed to seat the bar table we were at. She clearly lied to us. We waited another 15-20 minutes for her to find an open table and were finally seated 30-40 mins after being there. Upon reaching our table, we realized we were being seated and asked to eat at, essentially, an end table that we would have had to bend in half to eat off of. Thankfully, they switched the table for us. 10 mins later we had water and a glass of wine. 20 mins later we had our first course45 mins later we still hadn't even seen our APPETIZER. I'm generally a very patient person in restaurants. I served for many years. But this was unacceptable. A NYC restaurant should be ready for high volume in their dining room and at this point they weren't even that busy. A complete disappointment in terms of service. We never saw our appetizers so after waiting 30+ minutes, we got up and left. Worst service ever and for the prices they were asking I expect 10x better service. I would suggest trying to Cowgirl. That's where we are now. Much better!!!",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"
147,iUF73VhUE82iYimDu_MHyg,Abigail T.,2.0 star rating,"Came here for a birthday celebration. Birthday girl picked it. Most likely for her husband since the men enjoyed it more than we did lol.Reservation was for 10. We were given a table for 7 with a separate table for the other 3. Ummm. Hmmmm. I guess since we arrived later, we sat at the separate table like we did not belong to the same party. Needless to say that put a little damper on our night. Birthday girl wasn't happy about that. We ordered 3 bottles of wine, some cocktails, appetizers and entree. Grilled octopus was ok. When it arrived it was covered in arugula. You literally have to dig through it to get to the octopus. It was ok. The hummus, babaganoush and another trio served with pita was great. I recommend getting that. My grilled scallops was ok, it also came covered with arugula. Not a great presentation. Bf got the grilled whole fish with a side of their rice. The Branzino was perfect . Moist and seasoned well. Service is horrible. Given we're  a pretty big party. I would think as a waitress she had devised a system on handling big orders like ours. I guess not. She had her paper and wrote down our orders. Repeated it. And then came back to verify our order according to our seating. When the appetizers came, our orders were set at the other end of the other table. It was all over the place. We asked for another bowl of pita. Again they bring it to the other end of the other table. And after repeating our entree orders quite a few times, she comes to my bf to say she thought he wanted the salmon instead of the Branzino. Only redeeming factor about that booboo was that he was happy about the fish. Other than that, she's a ditz! #sorrynotsorry. To make matters worse, we paid with 5 credit cards and cash. Not our fault that she took the cash and did not swipe all 5 cards we gave her. She came back to our group, complaining about her tip. With her service everyone thought 15% is enough for her crappy service. She couldn't explain herself well and we were under the impression that our bill was paid in full and we gave her a decent amount of tip. She left our table slamming the pitcher of water she was holding down the table. The manager came and sorted it all out for us. And she never came back.For over $100 per person, that night wasn't worth it. I will never ever pick this place for anything in a million years. 2 stars for the whole fish. Minus a million for service.PS. If you did not heed my warning and still came to this place and you get the waitress who cannot describe their food other than ""it's to die for"", ask for someone else.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

But  on the other hand, I was not disappointed in the quality of the food. And the ambiance was spectacular. And the belly dancer was quite entertaining too!The first time I went here, the service was impeccable. They knew it was my first time and really catered to me and my girlfriend. The second time I went here, the service left a lot to be desired. It was more crowded this time and the service was slow. In addition, both my girlfriend and I had a complaint involving our drinks. It was too strong and not to our liking. It tasted like medicine. It appeared that it took alot of effort to get it changed and it seemed like they were annoyed. When the drinks came back, it didn't seem like they changed it at all. Just added more ice! Then when our waiter came to ask us if everything was fine, we just said we were ok. He seemed concerned at first and asked us to tell him what's wrong. When we explained to him about the drinks, he quickly seemed like he didn't care and walked away stating that there is nothing he can do about that. Then why did you keep prodding us to find out what was wrong then??!!As I stated, the food is very good. But make sure you do not have a problem with your food or drink because you will be treated like you are annoying them and will have to make them work more to satisfy you.

The inside of this restaurant had a dark classy/fancy environment. There were chandeliers hanging from the ceiling and the floor had indoor grass. I didnt like that much because i was wearing heels and the glass felt wet. The bathrooms were very classy as well with chandeliers. The overall decor of the place is very nice, maybe a little more light would make it a bit nicer. When it comes to the food, i ordered there chicken shish kebab and a side of sautéed veggies. The order took forever to come, but  i enjoyed my glass of wine and the belly dance show during my wait. The dancer was very talented and even did sone crazy dance moves with a bunch of candles. She literally had a big plate with lit candles and was dancing with it on her belly, her legs, her head omg crazyFinally the food came and that chicken kebab was soooo good! It was two pieces of chicken it was so tasty so tender, superb! Then the side of sautéed veggies complemented the chicken and it really made up for the long wait to get served.

Brunch Time:The Egyptian Oatmeal is fresh, delicious, and unexpectedly good!  I would have that for a morning meal every single day.Dinner Time:The pita and hummus is to die for!  The lamb is well cooked and tasty.  The chicken is delicious and tender!  They also have these Egyptian sausages called Beef Kofta, although it can leave your breathe a little oniony, it is really delicious.The portions may be small as some people say, but if you do the Pre-Fixed menu you get four courses that may not seem like it will fill you up at first but it definitely will.  Plus, you get to sit in a tented table and truly experience the restaurant.Decor:The restaurant is absolutely beautiful and you feel like an Egyptian Goddess walking into the restaurant.   Belly Dancing! Need I say more? The women they use for the show are seductive & beautiful.  Customer Service:I have went to Casa La Femme multiple times for parties and dates.  Sarina is the event coordinator at Casa La Femme and I have booked multiple parties with her.  She is the best event coordinator I have worked with. She is amazing at her job, truly attentive, and if you want she will even enjoy the party with you and make sure everything goes smoothly.  She is upbeat and knows how to get the job done!  She has been working for the company for an extremely long time and knows the ins and outs of Casa La Femme.  She is very detail oriented and makes sure everything is perfect.  If you ever need or want to book an event...Sarina is your woman!I have also had the pleasure of working with Luis who is the manager at Casa La Femme.  He is extremely professional and addressed any concern I had.  He made sure every event and date I had at Casa La Femme went smoothly.  He always made sure there were beautiful flowers and alcoholic beverages flowing at every table!   He is very detail oriented.  He is very upbeat and wants to make sure each customer has an amazing time at the restaurant. He is always a pleasure to work with at any of the events. The best server is Mario!  He is attentive and knows the menu well.  He looks out for his customers and makes sure we receive the best service possible.Owners:I've had the pleasure of meeting both of the owners of Casa La Femme.  Anastasi & Medhat.  Both are amazing people.  Anastasi is funny, a perfectionist, and he can DJ! He DJ'd one of the parties I threw at Casa La Femme.  Let me tell you, he is an owner that parties hard!

When I explained to the manager that on his website no where does it say that and we chose the a la carte menu, he didn't want to work out a compromise, was very rude, and told me he couldn't do anything about it and I should just cancel.

When we got there we asked to sit by the main inner part of the restaurant and he the manager mentioned he has a lot of large parties coming in so we can put you in the back....meanwhile we were there for four hours and not a single party came in, there were over 5-6 large tables available and still they let us sat in the corner with bad angle. They served us free dips after waiting an hour for them, the food was okay nothing special. The belly dancer was only out there for 5 mins! The hooka only came in one flavor!!!!

My friend and I decided to go with the Prix Fixe menu to experience being in a private 'tent', which really wasn't worth it. First came the pita bread with dip, which was probably the best part of the meal. Next I had the Goulash Bil Gibnah, an Egyptian pastry stuffed with leeks, mushrooms and herbs - that was okay. The grilled fish of the day had WAY too many BONES, tiny, small and large! It was like a minefield, where I was having to maneuver away from bones and spit them out after every bite.Lastly, the dessert was the biggest letdown. There were no choices to pick from, so my friend and I were both served the same pudding (tasted like quick mix) dish with a few slices of fruit place on the side.We finished dinner around 9 and wanted to at least see the belly dancers who had not yet come in. The waiter asked if we wanted more wine, to which we declined. Then we asked him when the belly dancer(s) was coming in and he said in 15 minutes. After about 5 minutes, the hostess came to tell us we had to leave our table, because there were others waiting. Um, actually, NO, the place was pretty EMPTY? Just because we didn't want to waste more money on drinks and crappy service, we were forced to leave. She actually had the nerve to say we could just stand in the lobby and wait for the belly dancer to arrive!Don't WASTE your money on crappy food, prices and service!!The interior isn't even that nice...the pictures online are very deceiving.

The place is huge and gorgeous. They have done a great job decorating it so well. Until our table was ready, we hung out in their pretty spacious bar with the friendly bartender. I ordered a dirty martini and my friends got negroni and the house special cockails from their elaborated cocktail list. We were given a choice of sitting in their private booths with prefix menu, but we decided to decline that offer. We got a bottle of tempranillo the bartender reccomended for the table. It was pretty delicious. The food was definitely not cheap compared to the taste and portion they served. The servers weren't the most attentive either. They missed out on one of our main course items and didn't bring it out until the rest of the table was done eating. For appetizers, we got the babaganoush and Goulash bil Gibnah. They were mediocre. The Tagine Alexandria was pretty good, but hardly any seafood. They had branzino for fish of the day, that was delicious. Two of my friends got the 'Riash Mashway'(the lambchops). This dish arrived extra late, but they looked like they enjoyed it. The belly dancer on the other end was pretty entertaining. I even got up and danced with her for a min. The place was nice enough to check it out once, but I do not plan to make another trip.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

This place has a great atmosphere with moderate volume music in the background and comfortable cushioned chairs. Though the belly dancers don't come out often, when they do, they are beautiful and friendly and well worth the wait! We had a birthday boy in the group and she spent a good few minutes dancing with him and taking photographs with us! So why the lack of stars? The service, though it seemed friendly at first, was terrible. The waiters seem to have a deal for people who have special birthdays or events because then you'll get a small discount on the pre-fix menu. However, we arrived at 8:30 and didn't leave till 11. Our waiter completely disappeared on us for a good half hour. Instead his focus was on the huge table next to him. Our water wasn't filled until two hours after we sat down, and the food came out 45 minutes after the appetizer. Dessert took another 45 minutes after the table was cleaned. When it came to the bill we asked two times, and in return they asked US 3 times ""did you get the bill yet?""  How strange!  After we got up ready to leave the waiter leaned over the balcony to the center of our table to reach the bill. I would give less stars but I don't think it would be fair to base the reviews on 1 or 2 waiters. My suggestion is to teach the waiters a little more manners and customer service quality and I'm sure the reviews would be better rated. Oh, the food itself is okay. We each ordered different appetizers and entrees to get a sense of the food overall. The chicken is really juicy and the beef appetizer is flavorful.

First, there is not one single employee in the restaurant that is Egyptian (not a good sign). Our reservation was at 6:30 and we were promptly seated. It was a Sunday night, so we were one of only 3 tables. We ordered the prix fixe meal, and our first course was not brought to the table until 7:30. I was disappointed by the extremely small portion sizes. We got a couple tablespoons of each spread and a pita the size of a saucer. When we asked for more bread, we were charged extra. Our second course was no better. The soup was cold and when sent back to get it warmed up it took 15 minutes to get it back. Really? The main course was OK, but most came a la carte so we had to order additional sides. I had the lamb chops which were very well done/overcooked (not uncommon in Egyptian restaurants). The odd thing was they were served in a bowl with rice in the bottom. How do you cut meat in a bowl? The tagine was just OK, not worth the $10 up charge though. We also ordered grape leaves, which ended up being the tiniest I've ever seen! They were about the size of my pinkie finger.The dessert course was a trio of very small traditional desserts. The basbusa was dry, but there was a small dollop of ice cream which made it passable. We didn't get our tea until after the dessert. It took 30 minutes to get our tea. We finally figured out the reason behind the extremely slow service- they had a belly dancer performing at 9:15 and they wanted us to stay until then. I was irritated by this. We should be able to make that decision, not be held hostage to be audience to an entertainer. She was very good, and it was an enjoyable performance.My overall impression was the restaurant has nice ambience, but the portions were very stingy and service was slow. The prices were astronomic. Overall not worth the very high price.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

Unfortunately, unlike most Egyptians, no one in the restaurant understood what hospitality means; at every stage, we were met with issues from the generally unfriendly staff.Our group of five had to wait at the bar for around 20 minutes even though almost half of the dining room was empty when we were finally seated. Just minutes after being seated at a table by the hostess, we were told that we had to move to a different table because a large group was coming in, and they needed the table where the hostess originally seated us. Once we were actually looking at a menu, we had multiple issues with the waitstaff in terms of ordering and received and returned wrong drinks at least two times. To top it all off, we were barely through our dessert platter for my 30th birthday when we were given the check and ""reminded"" that gratuity was not included. Then, moments after we paid, we were told we needed to leave because another reservation was coming in. This was despite the fact that we had overlooked the terrible service and tipped over 20% on a large bill of dinner and drinks. I was mortified! I couldn't believe that this was the type of place I chose to celebrate my birthday with family and friends who were visiting me in New York.It is a shame that all of the issues with service ruined what would have otherwise been a good meal. The food was great! The group was mostly Egyptian with others who are very familiar with Egyptian and Middle Eastern food. We all agreed that the food was authentic and delicious. The grape leaves and the branzino were especially tasty. The only caveat was that the portions were quite small, especially in comparison to the cost.All in all, I would have been excited to return to Casa La Femme for the food, but will never go back because of the service.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

For $60 a pop (plus an additional $8 if you wanted the lamb or fish), we got very bland, unexceptional food, and very little of it too - would it kill them to throw some rice on the side without charging an extra $7? I ordered the vegetable tagine and it consisted of carrots and barely cooked green pepper. I was promised eggplant but it was nonexistent. I could've gotten something 10x better for under 15 bucks from any takeout joint. The appetizers were good but the dessert was a very underwhelming small pastry. Overall, we got jipped - on taste and value. I'll never forgive the friend who recommended this place to us.Oh, and let's not forget the waitress who tried to upsell us on absolutely everything!

YES THEY ARE THAT GOOD!!!4) Belly dancer and the music was pretty good.  Kept us entertained.CONS:1)The customer service was probably the worse I have ever experienced for the price point.  2) About 1/3 of the glasses and/or silverware were dirty on the table.  3) Bathrooms were untidy and not as clean as I would expect.4) Wait staff was very inattentive.5) Dessert was deplorable.....Actually it was an insult to the 4 course menu.  It just does not belong. It's like it was an after thought.  The entire table was displeased with the dessert.6) I asked for my left over food to be wrapped up.  Some how since they liked me so much, they decided to give me a bonus and give me someone else's chicken.  NO ONE AT OUR TABLE HAD CHICKEN!!!!  EWWWWWWWW..........................7) After complaining, they gave me a new dish to take home.  I checked it again and it looked okay, but when I got home to re-heat it I notice some doughy like items in my jasmine rice.  I am absolutely  DISGUSTED.I'm DONE........(drops the mike and walks away)",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

I visited this spot almost a year back so things may have changed.About a year back, I went here for a girl's night with my lovely roomies. We had made reservations of the white tents. Ambiance: Sultry, sexy, swankyDrinks: exotic, delicious but pricey.Entertainment: This is where it gets its' most stars. The belly dancer from that night. OMY. She was so damn good. If you come here make sure there is belly dancing going on! She really got the crowd going!Seating: here's where it loses the point. I had specifically inquired about the white tent. All that entailed was told to me. But upon arrival I was informed that EACH member of the party apparently had to do a prix fixe.  So in a group of four if three people are doing a prix fixe and one isn't that is not allowed. Thus we weren't given the tent. See I think that was ridiculous. That tent would have easily been given to a couple. We had at least 2 people out of our group of four ready to do a prix fixe! So instead we seated at a regular table which I begrudgingly have to admit was a fairly nice alternative. Food: It's tasty. But portions are small. So keep it in mind. HOOKAH: is served here! $35 practically no flavor options. BUT it is served here!I have to say we loved the experience at this place. We knew we'd have to part with a pretty penny that night but that was the whole plan anyways. A night of awesome fun and a little indulgence. It was great!P.s. it's also a great date spot.

""No problem,"" she says, ""just sit at the bar (NOT in view of the belly dancers), and when everyone is here we'll seat you."" Pet peeve: other people saying NO PROBLEM when it IS a problem. Minus one star for that!After a bit of masculine whining, we got a table just down a short set of stairs from the dancers. Better, but it was a real neck strainer seeing the action. Then comes Rose! ""Hey you guys,"" she says, ""come on upstairs where the action is.""She gets us a table in the main room, the belly dancer comes over and it's all uphill from there. Rose wasn't even mad because the other 5 people I'd promised didn't show. It is a great place. The belly-dancing is just the icing on the mid-Eastern cake. The food was delicious. We had the seafood tagine... which wasn't served in a tagine, There were only two GIANT shrimp, but the seasoning was perfect. Likewise we had the pita with various toppings, all excellent.

224,Ne88GxQQZAEi9SYmC8DNvw,Dania S.,1.0 star rating,"Let me preface this review by saying that Casa La Femme is one of the most gorgeous restaurants I've been to. All of the decor, from the tables and chairs to the chandeliers and flowers are truly beautiful. Even the individual bathrooms are immensely spacious with armchairs in each one. The entire place has a very romantic feel to it, perfect for a date night or a girls night out. HOWEVER...... this is as far as my praise for this restaurant can go!I came here on a Saturday night with a group of 9 girls to celebrate a birthday. I had specified on open table and on the phone when they called to confirm that I did not want the tented seating because I wanted to be able to order a la carte. When we arrived, the waiter tried to push the prix fixe menu on us anyway. Clearly this is what management tells them to do. We chose a la carte and ordered the hummus, babaganoush, and fava bean mezzes for our apps. We also got the crab cakes and their supposedly famous peasant salad. The mezzes were the only good thing we ate all night. The crab cakes were subpar and that ""famous"" peasant salad was a total joke. I could've made that myself and made it better. We didn't fare any better when the entrees came. The lamb chops were overcooked, dry, and rubbery. The moussaka was bland and tasted nothing like its description. The vegetarian tagine was just as mediocre. The salmon was the only dish that was semi- decent. Overall, all of the food was pretty flavorless and felt like it was missing something.I would've loved to end the night at this point, but since it was so cold out and we didn't feel like walking to another spot, we decided to get 2 hookahs for the table. They only have 1 flavor which is apple (pretty ridiculous to not offer more variety than that). Now, I've had a lot of hookah in my life, but I have to say this was by far the absolute worst I've ever had. It tasted nothing like apple and actually had a licorice flavor to it. It was rough and tasted downright disgusting. In October I came here just for the hookah late on a Saturday night and we had a bad experience then too. At least it tasted like apple that time, but again it was poorly made and very rough. The hookah's are also really small, but they charge the same price that the larger ones are at other lounges. We complained and they did take 1 of them off of our bill. My friend also had a very bad experience with their restrooms. They have at least 6 or 7 individual bathrooms and all of them, while decorated beautifully, were not clean. They could certainly afford to keep an attendant there. A customer should not have to forego using your facilities because they're too dirty. I would like to make a note that the restaurant did call me a few days later and left a voicemail asking me for feedback on my experience. I did call back, but no one picked up. Needless to say, I will not be coming here again. Yes the decor and ambiance are certainly pretty, but at the expense of basically everything else? Sorry, but you'll have to find another sucker.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

Me and my girlfriend went on a date and had a reservation. We sat 20 minutes after our reservation which i just chalked up to a busy night. Then we sat for 40 minutes without even getting a menu.

Venue:  overly decorated with chandeliers, velvet wooden seats, private tents, very pompous...with the crowd to match. DJ promoted a nice, clubby ambiance. Belly Dancer only showed up at 9 and 12am, wasn't too engaging, probably 'cause we were mostly a female table. At the bar waiting, paid $14 for a mediocre glass of white wine, the ""best they had in the category"". I had better wine from Tj's in my fridge. Poor wine choices me make angry. Like someone else mentioned, there is no bar menu with the list of prices, so be careful when ordering. On to food: seems like the only menu they have is $55 prix fix. Was dismayed by the small portions. Even the Pita bread with dips (w hummus, babaganoush, bean puree) was considered a ""first course"". You get 3 in one bowl, so in a crowd of 4-5, you're really eating 1/2 a bread minimum. It was very fresh and I felt it should have been available throughout the courses.2nd  course (really the appetizer) Ordered the Crabmeat Kofta Crab, basically consisted of two small crab meat patties...just that. it was OK. People who ordered the Felfel Mahschi (Jasmin rice) seemed more disappointed in their dish.3rd course: I paid the extra  $5  for the chopped lamb which turned out delicious. I'm glad they didn't screw it up, since lamb is a Middle Eastern specialty. Though I wish it came with a better side, other than plain white rice.Dessert (Baklava)  came in tiny portion but good.

By that time, I was pretty tired and had had my fill of drinking. But I was pleasantly surprised by the vibe of this restaurant/ lounge. I'd be lying if I said I could remember exactly what I ate because truth be told, the bachelorette party was a few years ago.What I can remember vividly was the enchanting decor that made me feel like I was Egypt, leisurely dining on yummy food (I think I had the tagine, but again I'm not positive) while enjoying some fun entertainment. As a latin and ballroom dancer myself, I have a deep appreciation for all types of dance. And since I did at one point begin taking belly dance classes (until my salsa instructor told me it would interfere with her teachings, but that's another story), I was all the more enthralled by the beauty with which Casa La Femme's dancers executed what I consider to be one of the most beautiful dances there is. I had mentioned the vibe earlier. It's difficult to put into words, except to say that your time at Casa La Femme will be a sensory experience from the moment you walk in. In the main dining room, the central seating area sits on a slightly sunken level, with a large fire pit serving as the focal point of the whole restaurant. Flanking this area on an elevated level are tables partially covered in organza-white tents, with hand-laid glass tiles on the floors and authentic Egyptian woodwork adorning the walls. The restaurant is filled with the smells of herbs and meats cooking, and though your dining companions are obviously super fun people, you'll enjoy the distraction when the music is pumped up and those dancers get out into the dining room, engaging men and women alike to create a communal sense of celebration. The one thing that marred my experience had nothing to do with the restaurant - I somehow managed to totally get screwed into paying $100 in a table of, like, 10 girls, even though I had an appetizer and entree with no drinks at all. Again, not the restaurant's fault, but when I do return, I'll be paying with cash ... and going with a smaller group.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

FOOD: When sitting at the tents, you must order from the prixe fix menu. $60 for four courses isn't bad so no complaints there. Our first course was the Mazza - three dips with freshly baked pita bread. For the second course, my husband ordered the Crabmeat Kofta - which tasted more like Conch in our opinion. Thick and chewy, yet if you love conch, you'll love this! I ordered the Sogo - beef sausages which were amazing! For our third courses, we got the chicken and the grilled salmon. The chicken was amazing!! Very flavorful and tasty! The jasmine rice was delicious as well! The salmon come atop couscous and neither one of us were a fan of the couscous.

I truly felt like a Middle Eastern princess! Most places make up for not-so-great food with a chic ambiance but Casa La Femme had the total package. My friend and I had dinner from a prefixe menu. We received a spread of various hummus flavors and fresh, hot pita bread as an appetizer along with some type of home made sausage and grilled octopus (delicious!).

We were escorted through a beautiful, dimly lit dining area reminiscent of Arabian Nights and ensconced in a booth that looked like I Dream of Jeannie's boudoir. The decor is flat-out gorgeous. The service was attentive most of the evening and the food was good, but as many other guests have mentioned, way overpriced. It's a $55 pre fixe menu that consists of four courses. You might think that is a lot of food, but the portions are French style. I don't even mind small portions to be honest and I knew about the price going in. The belly dancer completely ignored our table. She shook her wares in front of every other table except ours. We found it kind of odd, but we are not complainers so we enjoyed our meals without much of a fuss. Now the reason I am giving this restaurant a 2 star review is as follows. I went home wondering why it had cost $200 for two people who ate from the pre fixe menu and had two drinks. The reason: There is a whopping 20% tip included in the price that they don't tell you about. We wound up leaving an extra $30 tip thinking it was not included. Buyer beware. You live, you learn.

The busboy or whoever poured water into our glasses as we sat down, spilled water all over the table getting it onto my bag and phone. No apologies were made so I'm assuming he did not notice. Halfway into our entree and my side still had not arrived, I spoke to the waiter about it after finally getting his attention and he said they had forgotten to bring it out. ""Good call"" he says, when that is his job to realize. Upon paying our check, some lady who I'm assuming to be one of the managers, picked it up and asked us if we would like our change back. My boyfriend and I were dumbfounded. That is a ridiculously improper question to ask your guests, you simply just bring the change.. it's basic etiquette. And of course, the cherry on top, as we exited there was no one to even provide a simple ""Thank you, enjoy your evening"" because they were talking amongst themselves instead.I've been looking forward to this evening at Casa La Femme for two months, such a shame to have been so disappointed.

The pita bread is made fresh (takes about 15~20 min to bake). My friend who is Greek loved her lamb chops.  Try the sogo! I really liked that they use natural grass feed beef/chicken/lamb for their dishes.  If you're going a la carte, skip the dessert!! The pre-fix menu came with something that tasted like corn-bread with ice cream on top. It also had something on the side of the dish that looks like a mini-egg roll. It was stuck to the dish and then after I managed to break it in half to try, it stuck to my teeth/ mouth. Pity as it was the last item we had in an otherwise wonderful meal.

We had a big group for a friend's birthday. My friend was the organizer and she told them 16, give or take 1. They set 15 seatings. One person dropped out last minute, which is good because we couldn't squeeze another in. The chairs in the main dining area are bulky, heavy, and wooden. Movement is difficult. Try not to drop anything because it's almost impossible to find anything on the carpet/dark lighting (my friend dropped her credit card!)Since we had a large group, they gave us a prix fixe menu. $45 for shared appetizers (yummy), another appetizer, and a main. I tried the crabmeat cakes (they were TINY) and lamb chops. The lamb chops was a very popular choice... 90% of our table got it. It was too salty. They give the table plenty of plates of rice so that helped balance out the saltiness. I think the belly dancer performs around 9 and 12:15. It was entertaining. The one who came out around 12 had amazing abs. We were gawking. There are plenty of tented areas - some with tables, some with low lounge chair for two. This couple near us had their curtain closed completely but failed to realize that they are SHEER and it looked like the guy was giving the girl a lap dance. All in all - great for a romantic date. We left around 1 and there was a decent crowd in the front, bar/lounge area. One negative thing is that the location is a bit off the main streets.

Positives: First off, the bar area was beautifully decorated, real grass on the ground, and cool intament seating areas.  The sights, sounds, and smell of the Resturant tells you you're not in Kansas anymore. As we were being seated the belly dance began the entertainment. She was great getting the guest to be part of the Fun, fun, fun. The food was very good. We shared the octopus salad. The octopus was cooked to perfection, not chewy at all. The dressing complimented the arugula and blended the flavors very we'll. My friend ordered the lamb, but also had to order a side since it did not come with the meal.  She said the lamd was delicious after 10 minutes of waiting for the tazenie sauce.  I got a vegetable stew that paired well the couscous. It wasn't to bad. Would I order that again, meh.  Okay, the las few sentances we're not to positive I know, but it leads us into where improvements can be made.Others:  I hate saying negative because there is always room for improvement. Service! OMG! Service, service, service! 10 minutes on water,  and forget about getting that glass of water refilled. For the conviant of the staff and guest, leave a carafe of water at the table! Still we haven't ordered. 15 minutes after the waters arrived we tried placing our order, with the water boy. Okay, now we're getting hungry and agitated. So he runs off to get the server.  She takes our order and brings us another drink. 20+ minutes later, we had to ask if we where ever going to eat. Sine I was seated facing the curtains where the food was coming out of, I noticed the kitchen manager would come out every few minutes with plates looking confused to where the server is or where the dishes were to go. To make this short, they are short staffed, untrained (water boy who gets distracted), and where is the manager? Oh, BTW, the tazenie sauce my friend asked for, $8 crazy dollars that was served in a small shallow sauce bowl ( the size you pour the soy sauce in at the sushi Resturant). So, if you decide to try this out, beware! Do not go with an empty stomach. Do drink a lot so you don't notice your food taking ages to get to you.

I'm assuming previous comments were read by the staff and maybe some changes were made because the bill was accurate and the food was fair, which were my two biggest concerns based on so many reviews.  Sure, the food is stupidly overpriced for the quality, but it was a girls night out, so ambiance was far more important, and this place delivered.  The belly dancer was great and made her way to every table, and the decor alone is worth a visit... I wasn't a fan of the grass carpet, but it was novel.  The reservation was for 12 people, however only 10 seats were at our table with only 9 place settings; it was taken care of quickly, so it wasn't a problem.  The rest of the service was fine; not great, but not terrible either.  If you're planning a party (for nearly anyone but foodies), this place is a good option.  A 9pm reservation was perfect- drinks were served just before the dancer made her way out.  Just keep your expectations in check- it's not about the food here.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

Would not recommend going with large groups or special occasions.Pros - The food was good, we had a wide variety on the table and everyone enjoyed their meal. The lamb chops, whole fish and salmon entree were really good. The pita breads are fresh from the oven, the grape leaves and grilled octopus were quite delicious. The ambience was really nice in the bar area when you enter.Cons - Service and staff! We were a large group and they didn't tell us ahead of time that they would not seat us till all of the party had arrived (they called to confirm the reservation and that would have been a good opportunity to inform us). We waited at the bar but no one from the staff checked in our updated us for 15-20 minutes. When we went to ask about the table the host was really rude, herded us back to the bar saying we are working on the table, go back to the bar.The lady waiting on our table had a similar attitude, really loud, rude and kept forcing the pre fix on us. It gets loud when the belly dancer comes in so not great for conversation either.All in all, bad for large groups because the service and attitude of the staff is just not worth ruining your special occasion.

There were some things that couldn't have been better and there were some things that were me thinks not! We had a 7:00 reservation on a Tuesday evening. When I arrived my date was already at the bar. I will agree with the other reviews in that the space is really nice. They had the front open so at one point with the breeze, the music and the decor I did feel like I was on vacation someplace exotic. I couldn't decide what I wanted to drink and the bartender could not have been more helpful. He said he could make a lemonada without the sweetest and he did an outstanding job. 5 stars for him, no stars for our next encounter with the hostess. My date approached her and said we were ready to sit down and she said she couldn't find our reservation. The restaurant was only half full so just seat us anyway. She then proceeded to lecture my date about how dismissive he was when he walked in, really? The manager then came over and sat us at one of the tented tables, I guess it pays to know people. Our waitress was really informative if a little pushy on having us order the pre fixe. We both felt it would've been too much food so we decided to go a la carte. When I looked at the wine list not only was it very limited but the first two bottles I ordered they didn't have. I finally ordered a Dolcetto D'Alba that was served too warm and I don't really think it was the bottle listed on the menu. On to the food. We started with the Fuul Medames with pita and this was probably the best part of the meal, the dip was excellent. We then split the octopus which was also fantastic. This was one tentacle charred with a nice spice served over arugula and cherry tomatoes. For entrees I went with the whole fish and my date had the lamb chops. My fish was branzino which was perfectly ok but I've had much better. There wasn't much meat on the fish and it was a bit unevenly cooked. My date thought the lamb chops were good although I can't comment as I didn't try them. All the entrees are a la carte so I definitely think the prices are a bit steep. We also ordered the Egyptian fries which were good but just tasted like regular fries to me. The meal ended with a complimentary dessert which was a nice touch. All in all the atmosphere is great, food meh.

We finally got our tent and the place is really nice looking.  I was impressed with the decor.  But my awe for the place did not last long.  As soon as we sat, they asked us what we can get to drink.  The waiter INSISTED that we have wine...he almost didn't take no for an answer.  Mind you, it is against my boyfriends religion to drink.  After the waiter left, we were borderline harassed to order a drink by three other people who came to our table who all asked about five times each.  I am just SO shocked that in an Egyptian restaurant not having an alcoholic beverage was such a big deal.  The waiter then gave us the menu and rushed us into ordering, he actually said, ""ok, I have to take your order now""....WHAT.  We were sitting there for less than ten minutes and it was Valentines.  There were so many things I wanted to say to him at this point but held my tongue because it was Valentines.  Here is a review of the food:1st coursePita Bread with Hummus and two other dips.  Nothing special.  I say, ""two other dips"" because the little boy who brought it over to our table had no idea what the other dips were.  I'm guessing this was because the rude manager didn't get a chance to train everyone before his customers arrived.  Throughout all of the first and third course, the manager was training his staff right next to our table...romantic, I think not.  I didn't come out to listen to how to work the POS system for an hour.  But thanks for the tutorial, I worded in the service industry and it's not rocket science.  Learn the day before.     2nd CourseOk, This was the worst course.  How can it be for two people if there wasn't enough food to divide evenly between two people????  No, I'm serious.  The man who divided the food onto our two plates had no possible way of dividing it evenly because there wasn't enough food.  Not to mention, the sausage was so burnt that it looked like what comes out of my dog...that's right.  It looked like I had a turd on my plate.  At least dress it up a little...drizzle some sauce on it.  Come ON!  Presentation is everything in a restaurant and they did not have it.  3rd CourseOh no wait, THIS was the worst course.  We ordered lamb.  Maybe because it was that I was already feeling sick at this point, but the little lamb I was able to eat once I took off the 3/4 fat...I just wasn't feeling it.  Oh, and it came with FRIES.  What???  When we were ordering, the waiter INSISTED we order EXTRA fries because they were SO GOOD.  Umm, it's a fancy place.  I DON'T WANT FRIES.  And secondly, when I say no, thank you.  It means NO.  Don't ask me over and over again until I feel badly for not ordering some soggy fries.  4th CourseDessert.  THEY PUT THE DESSERT ON OUR TABLE WHEN WE WERE STILL TRYING TO FINISH THE FRIES!!!!  I was shocked beyond belief!!!  Talk about BAD service.  Then I order tea, which took ten minutes to get.  And by the times I got it, it was luke warm.  You have got to be kidding me.  Rush me to eat dessert and don't even give me hot tea to enjoy.  THEN the waiter came up to me WHILE I WAS STILL WITH A FORK IN MY MOUTH asking if I was done with dessert.  I was polite and said, ""no, not yet"" and HE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND SHOOK HIS HEAD IN FRONT OF ME!!!!Disgusting service and disgusting food.  Whoever recommends this place clearly has no taste in anything.  Listen to it from someone who knows what good food and service is...DON'T GO!!!!  Another side note...super expensive.  I saw the wine list and umm...they have nerve charging that much for those kind of wines!!!  Go to any other place and those wines are a fraction of the cost (and I bet they have better service too!).  ALSO...whoever was in charge of the music that night....WTH!!!  It went from Egyptian music to like bad songs you haven't heard since the 80s and 90s.  We were so confused.  It was like a little kid was controlling the music and just saying, ""ok, now I want to hear this song.""If there is any happy ending to the story...it was when we left and the cool pictures we got with the tent.  Oh, and me and my Valentine got a good laugh out of this joke of a place.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

303,EMVjWZepyXH8hgSqEiqFwg,Karen Y.,5.0 star rating,"One of my former co-workers recommended me to Casa La Femme. A group of co-workers and I decided to go one Friday evening after work. I went some time last year so the details are a little fuzzy. A bunch of us carpooled and drove into Manhattan. I was surprised there were a few parking spots on the street. I think we ended up parking on Christopher St two blocks away. We had a 7:00PM reservation, but we were a bit early. After waiting around outside the restaurant for fifteen minutes, a hostess led us to our table. At this time, there were barely any customers.The interior of Casa La Femme is luxurious. I love the private couple table canopies along the walls. There is a small square space in the middle for belly dance shows, which start around 9:00 or 9:30PM (I forget.)Casa La Femme specializes in Northern Egypt cuisine. Even though the prices are expensive, you get what you pay for. I didn't regret dropping $40+ dollars overall for dinner.For appetizer, our group shared different types of hummus ($6.95), which according to the website, is puréed chickpeas with a touch of spicy harrisa. It was really delicious. Our server for the night enthusiastically explained the menu very well. The cocktails sounded so amazing so I felt I had to try it. I ordered a cocktail with Godiva chocolate in it. It tasted heavenly and it was a drink that is to be tasted a little at a time. For our main course, I believe I ordered Tagine Samek, which is filet of fish of the day stuffed with crabmeat kofta ($22.50). When the entre arrived, I was disappointed in the portion. It came in a large plate with a small cylinder shaped meal in the middle. My disappointment quickly disappeared when I tasted the fish. It was simply amazing and I ate the whole thing in no time. My co-worker allowed me to try her Riash Mashway entre ($26), which is Grilled Natural grass fed lamb chops. Normally, I don't eat lamb chops, but after tasting a piece of lamb chop, I wish I ordered that dish too. It was really delicious! When I saw Batatas Mahamora ($6.95) on the menu, I simply couldn't let that go. I am a fiend for French fries and when I saw ""Egyptian style French fries seasoned with sumac"" on the menu, I couldn't pass it up. How often will I get to eat here anyway? The Batatas Mahamora was served in a paper cone cup on a stand. I thought the portions were small for $6.95, but when I tasted it, all my negative feelings changed immediately. The food here is so good, I'm willing to splurge on the entire menu.After our entre, my co-worker ordered a few hookahs for us. They come in flavors like apple flavor. I've never heard of a hookah in my life so this is a very new experience for me. The hookah is a water pipe where tobacco passes through. It reminds me of what the Caterpillar smokes in the Alice in the Wonderland story. We each get a mouth piece and then breathe the hookah using the hose that is attached to it. It was fun, but I wasn't very good at it. One of my co-workers can make rings with the smoke in her mouth.At around 9:00 or 9:30pm, the belly dancer appears on the scene to dance for about a half hour. I was disappointed to see her dance for only a half an hour when we waited the whole night for her to appear. She dances throughout the entire restaurant so everybody has a chance to see her up close. Once she makes her rounds, it is over and she immediately goes back to change. I think this is a very special part of the experience and I wish the restaurant would extend this feature more.Overall, this is a very special restaurant and I can't bear to not give it a full five-star rating because with each disappointment, I am still thrilled. This restaurant offers everything to delicious cocktails, appetizers, entres, hookahs, belly dancing show, great atmosphere, great service, and optional private cabanas for couples.

The second round of drinks took approximately 35 minutes and the third round not too far off that beat.

305,VyISamA3qcwTCRdAaPPcrA,Emme P.,2.0 star rating,"If I was to only judge Casa la Femme on their food then I would give this place 5 stars. The food is delicious. The service...SUCKS! It's Manhattan, and you have to have a lot more going for you than just good food. Let's start with the bar. Instead of presenting me with a menu, the bartender told me that they had red or white wine. I wanted something sparkling and so after expressing this I was informed about the champagne they were serving. I ordered a glass and right before the bartender goes to pour my glass he says, ""It's $16. Is that okay?"" Had I not heard him say this earlier to a woman seated a few seats down, I would have been totally offended instead of being mildly offended. In my opinion, that was very gauche.After my dinner party arrived and we were seated, I spied our waiter Yusef on his cellphone for a few moments. Now granted, the dining room was empty when we sat down, but don't check your cell phone on the dining floor. He also made the following horrible mistakes:1. He couldn't pour water and so the table always had little puddles of water.2. He doesn't  understand the consequence of food allergies. For instance, my bestie has a nut allergy and so when they brought to the table a dessert that had nuts, he suggested that she just eat the ice cream, which didn't have nuts (but was resting atop almonds). Had she listened to his life-threatening advice, she may have had to use her epi-pen. Not fully understanding the importance of food allergies is such a liability in this day and age when so many people have food allergies. It is just irresponsible on both his part and Casa la Femme.3. The second most grievous offense that he committed was his lack of skill in opening a champagne bottle. His ""skill"" in opening the bottle resulted in at least a glass spilling out upon uncorking. When we complained he said with a shrug of his shoulders, ""It wasn't that much."" The nerve!4. He also did not know how to properly pour the champagne. There was too much head in his pour, with the first glass almost spilling over. Needless to say all of the ladies at the table are champagne drinkers and we were all VERY annoyed!Another gaffe; some of the crew that assisted throughout the evening, seemed well... like Yusef trained them. One server's tie even went into my friend's glass of water. I mean really!While Yusef and crew can (and should) be held responsible for their level of service so should the managers for not properly training them. There is no excuse for what we experienced tonight and I have little tolerance for a place in the West Village marked as $$$ to have such mediocre service. I did not go in to Casa la Femme with any expectations but left with a poor taste.The crowd was MEH. On the positive side, the decor is fantastic and the bathroom's comfortable. The belly dancer was amazing as well. The food was delicious but I question their pricing strategy. We ""had"" to do the prix fixe, which online is $55 per person but the menu that you are given states $65 per person. The first and fourth course you have no choice in what you are eating. The first course was delicious pita bread with three dips, hummus, babagonoush and pureed fava beans. Why we had to pay for this I'm not sure, especially since most Middle Eastern restaurants that I've been to, provide this free but whateves. I had the grilled octopus, which was very tasty. I really liked that. For my entree I had the lamb chops. I love lamb and this was good but not amazing...and there was a fair amount of fat on my chops. Lastly came the dessert of which I only ate the vanilla ice cream (I don't really eat much dessert).All in all, if you want great Middle Eastern food give it a try but for the money this place charges, it is so not worth it!Cheers,emmebloggeremme.com",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

Waited another half hour and only when we started leaving he brought the bill, which was adjusted manually and still wrong. By this time we are in the front with our coats on.

It received a 3.5 stars from 128 reviews on Yelp.I had dinner and drinks here last night, which was a Saturday, arriving at around 7 PM, I was informed by the hostess that a lot of people book and reserve this place months in advance. My company wanted outdoor seating and we were told they did not have any outdoor seating, however they accommodated our requested and created outdoor seating for us, in which we got to sit in their birdcage seats, usually just used as decoration, while we had our drinks. Such an outstanding staff, going out of their way to please us. The place started to get packed with residents from the Upper East Side around 8 PM (as my business partner pointed out, their outfits say it all). The crowd is not of this trendy village, but uptowners coming downtown for their weekend night out, dressed to impress from head to toe, I believe I was the only casually dressed bon vivant there. (That's to unplanned, fancy food outings!)For drinks, I ordered the Quitini ($12-14) which consisted of grapefruit and a plethora of other flavors.For my entree, skipping an appetizer, I had the Tangine Alexandria ($35), which was absolutely fantastic! It comprised of scallops, shrimp, squid, potatoes and other vegetables and spices drenched in an Egyptian curry-like sauce, full of flavors and zest! The dish also came with a side of brown rice and was indeed quite filling.Overall: a 4/5 stars from me!

Too bad they haven't focused on any other aspect of the business. The food is mediocre at best. I had chicken which tasted much worse and cheaper than the one I would have at a casual eatery. When we wanted to sit at the more ambient section of the restaurant, we were told that we would have to order the $55 prix-fixe menu to sit there. That was an immediate red flag, a very shallow upselling technique I wouldn't expect someone to use in that context. And until we finally placed our orders, the whole staff was trying to upsell us that uninteresting prix-fixe menu, which didn't really seem like a bargain. If you ordered the items in that menu individually, it would probably come up to the same or even a lower price. And trying to upsell that to someone that clearly states to you that is only interested in grabbing a bite, is definitely rude.

321,PG1sGQlkZMjsA_VyiV7jLg,Stephanie Y.,3.0 star rating,"Wish Yelp gave half stars! Really warrants a 3.5 but I would not give it a 4, the food's hit or miss and it's more just the novelty and experience.  Offbeat cuisine but it's just Middle Eastern (Egyptian??) You have to order the right stuff... that's why you have my long, flowery Yelp reviews... :).. onwards.. Came here for a bachelorette party.  It's lavish, and has gorgeous decor, and it's really girly- so perfect for groups, a girl's night out and they say a date but I say it's too loud.  (Though those twotops with the Egyptian drapes in the darkness are sexy! If I were to come back, I kind of want to sit here and make out in public). Plus the belly dancers were fun (not the best I've seen, looking or talent wise) but I got to dance too, fun!It's unique, but in a weird location- in the residential heart of the West Village, though it has that  Meatpacking vibe. The intial mishaps were Casa Le Femme's fault but from my understanding, we made a reservation one week ago for 5 and it branched into 8.   We sat in the front, outside bar area.  Give them credit for the real grass and the serious drainage system they must have spent money on. Downside: it got hot.  Seating was tight (yes the funiture is nice, and fits the Egyptian theme,  though a little bourgeoise for my taste)  but we all made it.  The waitresses were good hosts as we were a little roudy and kept changing seating, so I don't hold their confusion that against them.  I propose a redo wearing Cleopatra headdresses. I think most people are sore about Casa Le Femme being too expensive- and also really stealthy about their prices (sketcharama).  As mentioned, their drink menu is price-less, and I don't believe a lot of the wine bottles are marked... hmmm... We had to order from the 3 course pre fix at $55 a pop.  I guess that's not really steep but then again you can't compare this place to a JG... this place is more trendy than anything, a facade of fine dining laced with lots of B&T.  We got to choose an app,  and a main. I was annoyed that the first course was actually the hummus and pita bread (which was bland, and the hummus didn't taste fresh) because it should basically be free as the bread basket! Totally a rip off..  there was just regular hummus, babaganoush, and fava bean puree..tasted no difference between any of them. Just the sour taste of bad hummus.The pita was not even warm and fresh, but tasted hard and chewy.  Bigtime boo for my carb-loving self. Among the apps, I got the argula salad.. nothing special.  It was nice fresh greens, some cherry tomatoes and some Egyptian cheese which tasted like mozzarella. Weird choice of cheese but the salad was sweet and simple.  Nice simple olive oil and seasalt dressing.  No complaints here. Other notable starters: spicy Egyptian sausage, and the sweet bell peppers stuffed with rice and herbs.For the main course, I opted to get the prawns- mainly because I didn't think anything else was appetizing. I don't eat lamb which I know is a Middle Eastern speciality but most of the other girls did. I heard it was just ok and very gamey.  My sister got the stuffed fish... I can't remember what it was but from what I gathered it was tilapia... stuffed with crab meat. Weird how they don't say on the menu. Way too heavy.  If you're opting for this to be healthy, don't.  I asked the waitress if the prawns were cooked with the shell- and she said they were, which made them really messy to eat.  But, she explained that this gave them more favor (plesantly surprised she was more informed than just any waitress but naturally I knew that already!)  And the prawns did have flavor!  They were a mess to eat but it was so dark and everyone else was so hammered I figured no one would care if I used my hands.   The sauce was very flavorful-  a sweet/spicy sauce paste, and even more banging was the cous couse it came with.  It had some kind of nutty flavor. Yum. I'd say I like my dish more so than everyone else like theirs.  If I were to go back, I'd probably opt for the chicken as that looked pretty good.. with sumac.  Love introducing the taste buds to some unique spices... (wow serious food nerd...*feels sheepish*)  Portions sizes are good.  We finished with dessert, which we needed to order a la carte (this should have been in the pre-fix, grr) . We got what I thought was the best baklava I've ever had... and I actually hate baklava.. it's always too sweet , sugary and greasy.  This baklava- infused with coconut was the bomb!  It came in small little pieces too (which they added just for us, undoubtedly not without charging an arm and a leg extra); because those little pieces looked too perfect to be actually cut. And another coconut flan thing- that was good too. But the bak was the best! I'd come back for someone's party but being that we ordered 3 bottles of unmarked wine (one Spanish one good)- BUT don't think this is not going to cost you!!",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

A must try is the crab appetizer, skip the sogo(sausage). I do need to go back & try the squid salad as I noticed many ordered that dish.

It is a large area in the back with tented tables and a big fire in the middle. They do allow hookas which are actually not bad seeing as I don't smoke and don't really have a desire to. They're flavored hookas and not harsh at all. The lemonada = fantastic! You can't even taste the alcohol its lemonade with citron vodka and muddled mint. Fantastic. There martini's looked delicious as well. Anyway on to the food: The pita bread and the sampler of dips was delicious. I could have eaten the entire thing myself. Then we got some appetizers; grape tomatoes with feta cheese which was delicious and fresh. We also had the egyptian sausage which looked a little awkward but it was good. For dinner we had chicken, pork chops, rice, and prawns. I don't know how to eat praws properly and don't really like them anyway. The chicken was really good, tender and not too dry. The pork chops were fantastic if you got a good one, some of them were a little fatty. If you're a very jealous woman - don't bring your boyfriend here.

I booked a reservation for 12 people at 9:30. I figured dinner would be finished my 12:30 the latest and then we had plans to go out to drink after. However, as soon as we got seated, the waiters forgot we were even there. We had to come up to them twice to get menus. We got the prix fix Menu for 55$ a person.After we got the menus, it took them another 30 minutes to take down our order. After we placed our orders(finally) the waiter comes back and says there are no more scallops left. 3 people at the table ordered that dish. We had to reorder. When we ordered mixed drinks, we had to ask each waiter to bring them a minimum of 3 times until they finally brought it. We got tap water for the table and it tasted like it was straight out of the toilet. After our appetizers and entrees, the waiters did not even bother to clean off our tables. When we got the ""dessert"", the table was covered in food and dirt. The ""dessert"" was supposed to consist of a variety of Egyptian deserts, however they only brought out ONE desert. Also, my friends asked the waiters 3x to bring me out a desert at 12. no one ever came. At this point, I couldn't get up any more to complain and we were rushing to get out because it was already 1:30 am and we were running late to make it to go out. when they brought the check, it came out to be around 100$ a person.  I thought that this meal should have came out for free after this horrifying experience. They ruined my 21st birthday. Not only was the dinner the worst dining experience I've ever had In my life, but by the time we made it out of the restaurant, all the lounges we planned to go to  were closed (2 am) They gave me the worst 21 st birthday of my life.

346,idQcFYBnweg_Ft8Ds-T_Aw,Rebecca F.,3.0 star rating,"I ate at Casa La Femme on a Friday night for a friend's birthday in a group of 8. The hostess wouldn't let us sit until the entire group arrived, but other groups were allowed to do so (she wanted us to buy some pre-dinner-$15 cocktails.) The decor of the restaurant is impressive and opulent, if not overly gilded. The lights are dim, and the mood romantic. Our waitress was ""saucy"" and reticent to communicate: we had chosen the prix fixe menu without dessert but she was insistent that we pay an extra $10 each for that final course. Eventually she relented. For $90 one can buy a pitcher (9 drinks worth) of any of the cocktails on the menu. Overall, the drinks were overpriced-even for New York. We had two: a lemonada (mojito but with vodka instead of rum) and one with grapefruit juice and tequila. The latter was much better. The waitstaff recommended the lemonada, but I found it almost two sweet to drink. The first course was a trio of Middle Eastern dips: hummus, baba ghanouj, and foul medames. The last was the most delicious, but all three were satisfying along with the warm, buttery pita bread.The appetizers arrived slowly, but were all satisfying and hot. Between the appetizers and dinner we were entertained by an eager belly dancer who flirted with all the groups. For a birthday, it was a lot of fun. The main courses were also good. Several in our party ordered the rack of lamb, which was overdone despite its great flavor. The vegetarian option, a vegetable tagine, was not special, but cooked well and had a lot of flavor. Overall, the night was fun and the food enjoyable. But not worth its even more impressive price tag.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

When we were seated we were given pre-fix and once we advised that we wanted to order a la carte we were advised that the section we were seated did not have that option. The server then came back after discussing it with his manager and said they would make an exception for us. We were then told we couldn't order appetizers and then afterwards put in our entree orders since the kitchen needed to know what we wanted in one instance. Then, about a half hour after taking our order, we were advised that there was another party that had our section reserved and that we would need to finish our food before they got there. Then when the food came. Everything was articulated very well however the food was only mediocre, and overpriced for the quality. One of us ordered the eggplant  entree, which cam with cheese but it didn't cover the entire dish, and when we asked for more we were advised that it would be considered an $8 side, which the server added onto to bill. Finally, the bill arrived and it had an extra drink charge on it and needed to be redone.

They just bring out some pita and Sabra hummus and Costco baba-ganoush.I actually had the problem of not knowing what to get on the menu because nothing really looked all that appetizing. The only things i wanted costed extra on top of the prix-fixe (which defeats the whole point of prix-fixe in the first place).The 50$ bottle of Rioja we ordered retails for 8 bucks and basically the whole operation here is about markup.  If your looking for good food or good value, this is not the place for you.  If you are looking to spend your bonus money on belly dancers, you should probably just go to a strip club.  Everything else about this restaurant is totally forgettable - except for the check at the end of the meal which makes you wonder how they can get away with charging what they charge.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

We ordered bottles of wine which yes are a bit pricey but you go there KNOWING that things are going to be pricey.. it's NYC.

A friend came very late, just as our 3rd courses came out and they were accommodating in seating him at our table and putting in his order quickly. The belly dancer was supposed to come on at 9 originally, then 9:15, it was about 9:45 when she finally did- which was a tad annoying considering i picked this place specifically for a belly dancer entertainment . I was hoping for a more exotic dancer and not a white girl with blonde hair.

Funny, that I didn't know this place existed even though I live a block (or two) away from it. Apparently it's been opened for 5 mths already (having taken over the lease from a previous gym).So, I was really enthralled by the exterior of this place and the overall bar area just looks soooo chic. I'm not exactly a huge fan of the carpet grass all around the bar area (yep ladies, grass - whether real or carpet just doesn't do that well with heels right?) ... but it wasn't a huge biggie for me. I loved the chandeliers and upscale look of the bar. Since the place is relatively new, it does not yet draw a specific crowd and while some in earlier reviews have mentioned the well-dressed and well-heeled frequenting this place, it really is still buidling up on that. The night I was there, there were groups of regular women celebrating a birthday, chatting and then there were a few fabulous looking women hanging at the bar and outside.Beyond the bar area, is the dining area. This place is HUGE if I didn't mention that already. However, while I give them props for the bar area, I'm not exactly a fan of the entire concept. For one, the whole belly dancing thing and shisha thing just does not go hand in hand with the look and feel of the bar. I'd say the place would do well without the former.... kind of brings it down a notch with the whole mish-mash image / offering thing. Drinks were pretty good but prices were rather steep (at $16, it's on par with The Carlyle when it should really be in the range of $12 for similar establishments). There are no menus and therefore it was a mouthful for the waitress to go through their cocktails.

When you walk in you are told if you want to eat from the a la carte menu you can sit in what is sort of an unappealing area on the other side of the bar. If you want to sit in the very attractive dining room with the tented tables its the prix fixe menu. Ok we were there for a ""fun"" night to cap off a birthday weekend. Bring on the $55 per person menu. They brought a menu but actually as others stated the five courses is hooey. You really choose a stater and a main course. None even mediocre. Four people got four different things and nothing was decent. They also unk down a crappy miniscule baclava and minicupcake for dessert. No onone at our table ate it- it was that bad. Most galling however was the waiter who acted as though he hated us from the start. The table next to us was large and loud and our waiter spoke in a whisper- making it hard to hear how things were prepared etc. when we asked him to repeat he seemed more annoyed. The waiter at the next table offered his group wine and sides with their meals our waiter - 20$ fruity drinks and a sullen attitude. So if you want to feel like a tourist on a tour getting taken advantage of- this restaurant will give you that experience.

The decor was phenomenal and, say what you will about the floor being made of grass, but 1) it's actually real grass and 2) it's clean...so if you are looking for a dark Hookah-type experience, this is the place for you.Unfortunately, the ambiance is the only plus side of this place. The drink prices are outrageous (the cheapest bottle of wine is $65 and cocktails are $16) and the service is actually laughable. We ordered 5 main plates, 5 appetizers, 5 drinks and a Hookah. After 2 hours, 3 main plates and 2 appetizers arrived...to the point where we just said forget it and asked them to take it off the bill. Cool for something different? Definitely.

In terms of food, the entrees were my favorite part.  The lamb chops and chicken were AMAZING and the spices on them out of this world.  My vegetarian friend also said he was happily surprised by how good the tagine was.  In terms of decor, the restaurant gives you the feel of an Arabian aristocrat enjoying a pleasant summer day.   Although we did not sit in the tents, it did seem like they provided a good romantic getaway for some of the couples that were there.  Even the bathrooms were really cool and modern (you'd have to see it to understand what I mean).Would I come back? DEFINITELY.  It seems like the place I can take my girlfriend for a romantic dinner or even to hang with my buddies before going to a club.  I can agree with other reviewers that the place is a bit pricey, but you are not going to find another place this cool in New York and maybe in any other city.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

If you look at the menu you'll be impressed by the prices for the a la carte--entrees are all under 30. but as other reviewers stated, expect to be spending at least 75/person if you order food and drinks. there is not a single wine on the list for lass than 50 and the cocktails are all at least 15 bucks. if you order a hookah, which is a nice treat, its 35 bucks, FAR pricier than the many hookah bars around the city. the other thing is that the entree portions are small; even the hummos mezze was basically 2 pitas but the hummus came in a tiny little condiment cup.so, the food is great, the atmosphere is better, but be ready to dish out some dough--save this for a special night and you'll certainly enjoy.also, when we called to reserve, we were asked whether we wanted a table or a tent--if you get a tent, you HAVE to get the prix fix option. we got a table, and the tables are just as nice, so unless you really want the prix fixe, go with the table.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

We went for the fixed menu, which was $60 pp. The waitress said all the snacks listed were included, so she asked us to only choose the appetizer and entre. Nothing in the menu options seemed appealing to me, and if it was ""fixed"" how come some dishes had additional charges? made no sense to me. I ordered the grilled octopus as appetizer and the scallops. The octopus was $5 extra, and the scallops $15. The wine was horrible, so I  assumed our bill would be moderate over the $60. It ended up being $99/pp!!! The appetizers were just tiny little bowls with 3 different spreads. They were not enough for the 10 of us. We all just got a smear of each. The pita bread was not served pre sliced, so every one was ripping them apart with their bare hands. I think that's disgusting! It should've been sliced. And by the way, there wasn't 10 slices, one per each, in case you were wondering why didnt each got his own bread.The octoups was one tiny tentacle. The scallops only came with endive. no side of nothing. The dessert were tiny little squares of cakes. Nothing to write home about. I left the restaurant hungry and i had to stop at walgreen's for a sandwich.The music was really loud. The belly dancer was talented. I give them that!The service was below mediocre.

Needless to say we were all starving at this point. They forced us into ordering ""family style"" which meant THEY choose what they will be serving us from the menu. Their excuse was if we each ordered it would take too long..I found THAT amusing at this point.So the first course was pita a three dips..Probably the best part of the meal.  They brought out 4 orders for 14 people which was gone in 30 seconds since we were all starving. We actually had to ask for more...seriously????Second course..not too exciting..salad was bland, rest was so so.At 1 am we still had not received our main course.

It's a bit of Vegas in a neighborhood street, with a tented, mosaic'd and bellydancer'd ambience - hey, I welcome a bit of diversity, kitsch and theater in my neighborhood, I mean, one day you're gonna die ... The staff tried quite hard to be nice, but were sadly sabotaged - in a 7/8 empty place at 11pm on a Monday night  - the dessert took HALF AN HOUR to arrive. The excuse?""We had to make the dessert from scratch.""Now if you know you're slow, best to tell people that 'it will take half an hour (or more) - especially on a Monday night approaching midnight. This is neighborhood New York, not neighborhood Cairo, and unfortunately, if you want to stay in business you need to get with the program. I'm not sure WHY it would take so long; the two dessert items - an egyptian custard (which I liked a lot) and a dense cupcake, both topped with ice cream, were ostensibly just nuke warm and definitely the kind of thing you could make in advance. But the real killer was how the mint tea - basically hot water some tea leaves 2 mint leaves - arrived AFTER dessert was over - more than half  an hour after we sat down, because ... ""We had to boil the water.""Translation: ""we had to drill for the water""The desserts by the way, were $8 each, the tea $4 each, spendy, but acceptable if brought out in a timely manner. With so much spent on the ambience - and cool Cairo-techno or whatever was playing - seems that a simple thing like tardy service will spoil everything, everytime.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

They bring you the food then you can close the curtain like tent which is great for a date so you can conversate. The food is great and the ambience fits the scene.  I went to their original location years back in soho where the floor was real grass but this new location is a little more dressy than the old location and no grass floor.  But overall it was great except for the $100/head price tag.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

419,5LIMTvSHo0NX1j3wer_QVA,ella k.,3.0 star rating,"the venue:love the decor. good vibe. we had a nice little private tent; although fitting 6 people around the tiny table was uncomfortable, it was a cool ideathe service:we had to ask for the same drink 5 times before it finally came. they did not once come up to see how everything is or if we need anything else. I think they are desperately understaffed. That being said, it is still no excuse for the lack of professionalism. we had to sit and wait for forks after the food arrived. we wanted to order appetizers first and then order entrees. the waiter said we have to order everything together and then walked away! we were ready to order both if he would have waited for our response. when we finally caught him again, we told him we want to split the appetizers. it would have been nice for him to mention that each appetizer comes in the smallest portions ever and meant for 1-2 people, not 6! ok fine... then come the entrees, we were not really hungry. mostly came for drinks and to celebrate a friend's grad school acceptance ... the waiter blatantly stated that the restaurant has ""a policy"" that each person has to order an entree. i've never ever in my entire life heard of any restaurant having such a policy. that is beyond ridiculous. so depending on the number of people is the number of entrees you are REQUIRED to order. the food:delicious. no complaints except for the appetizers. wish we would have known they were so small. you have to order sides because whatever you order, thats it. I had lamb-chops and couscous, my boyfriend had the fish of the day. both were delicious. the belly dancer:very entertaining.overall: will return but probably for just hookah and drinks",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"
420,0pFlZQ2t_uqbl2uPcyLthg,Nancy C.,5.0 star rating,"Wow is how I'll begin this review. Truly a great spot!  The folks that make this place up are beyond wonderful.  I think my friends and I spoke to everyone in this restaurant which ranged from the hostess, bartender, waiters, manager and belly dancer and can say nothing but great things.The place is beautiful and they didn't' miss a step on detail from every chair to the floor and chandeliers in the restrooms.I had the house recommended drink of lemon lime and champagne which came in a greatly sized glass with fresh mint. We enjoyed tent seating that only added to the evening's mood.  Our waiters were kind enough to pop by and make sure our tent was opened to see the belly dancers performance. The dancer was engaging and stopped by a couple of times to get our party up and dancing.The food was good.  Some favorites from last night that you may wish to try are as follows: Desserts: Kunefa, the shredded phyllo dough, stuffed with Egyptian custard was just titillating to ones taste buds. Not one bite escaped and no sharing of this delightful dessert.  One is in store for the smoothness of the custard and crunchiness of the shredded phyllo.App's: Felfel Mahschi and Crabmeat KoftaMazzas select the trio Entrées-Firakh Mashwaya and Tagine Khodar.  The couscous is delicious, I can't recall the last time I enjoyed it as muchSides- we were big fans of the Fatta, the Egyptian style fries were also good (Batatas Mahamora).5 stars for the food, the accommodating staff and the place.  This is a venue that I would visit again without hesitation.Parking was a breeze; I found a street spot in front of the place the minute I got there.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

422,YQuVfjTZ5Sn1WfqmVzUe0Q,Kelly S.,5.0 star rating,"I attended a small gathering for a friend here last evening that was absolutely the best evening I have had out in the city in easily five years.  We started at the bar with a few drinks while we waited for our entire party to show up.  The bartender as well as the hostess were friendly, approachable and really great with their service.  I really enjoyed the bar area as it had nice comfy chairs set up at an angle that my entire party was able to stay a part of the conversation (it is my biggest peev when people get cut out of the conversation).  Once we had our entire party, we moved over to our table which had an ambiance similar to the middle east - where I have frequently visited.  Its setting really allowed for a very intimate experience with our party.  Every person in my party that evening has very different tastes in food, VERY different.  By the time the last course was served every person at the table had the ""I am full and this was delicious"" grin.  Our server Steve got a kick out of that (if you get him when you are there - you are a very lucky table!).  Finally, and probably most important was the desert.  If Lynette C. actually popped by for dessert on her stroll home - there is no way she could have given it two stars unless all joy has been taken out of her life.   Our desserts came out by three different wait staff, led by Steve, and we were given the desserts with explanations of where they came from and how they were made.  After dinner we ended up staying at the place until the wee hours of the morning. Saturday night was packed, but in the food area you didn't even realize!    My friend had an amazing birthday and all of us had a great time.  The people on this site who have given it a bad review either lack taste themselves or are miserable people who need to find something more valuable to do with their time.We had a blast.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"

430,e-alE83pIdvpUTc0gyovww,Kerry A.,3.0 star rating,"A few of us visited Casa La Femme on Charles St. on Monday night (August 31). To begin with, I have to say I was really impressed with the ambiance. The decor was beautiful and romantic. I mean, really, it was the best part of the evening. The food was decent as well. Not the best Egyptian food I've had, but good enough and reasonably priced.The service was slightly off. We already had our drinks on the table and had ordered our food before water was poured for us. Another small quibble--I ordered the Glenlivet 12, and when the waiter brought my drink, he informed me that they were out of 12, so he brought Glenlivet 15 instead. Typically this means they are charging for the 12-year, or they would have asked if I wanted to pay the upcharge for the 15-year. When I received the bill, I was charged for the 15-year.  I chalked it up to inexperience, and otherwise the evening was nice. It was very dead in the area we were sitting (no belly dancer, no hookah pipes), but it was Monday night, so I guess it's to be expected. Overall, it was fine and I would probably go back.",Casa La Femme,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Egyptian,, Moroccan,, Mediterranean"
