0,d6HM-nXGGz_yoJZ-IZcxQQ,Rob A.,5.0 star rating,"Had this bookmarked for a while and was excited to try it when I was in the area.  This place did not disappoint, as I enjoyed the concept and layout of the restaurant.  Philipino American style food with a Mexican twist to it.  This spot is small but has a real cozy feel to it.  I really enjoyed the decor of it as It reminds me of Cali a bit. The bartender/waiter was super friendly and attentive while bumping some hip-hop music which I always enjoy.  I originally bookmarked this place for the Flip-N-Out Burger ($10.95) but went with the Cal burrito ($9.95) which was so good.  Loved the combination of the pork belly, pulled chicken, crispy fries, sour cream and avocado.  None of the foods were too overpowering and complimented each other well. They also have three different sauces you can try with the burrito.  Neither of them was too hot but they do offer a spicy sauce upon request. Next time I come here I'm going with the burger and probably something else.  The prices here are very affordable for both the food and drinks.  I also want to try their fried chicken sandwich, which is currently their special for the month of February.  Each month they have a featured sandwich or dish.  If in the area or even if not, I recommend coming here and trying a few things off the menu as all their food looks delicious.  There's also a takeout section for those who want to grab & go.  I'll be back to get that burger along with a few other items.",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"
1,W4C2hx1NqhoVHS4YVl_QCA,Annabelle V.,4.0 star rating,"This is the spot for meat lovers. The meats take the front seat- well seasoned and well cooked, so all the meats are the soft-melty kind. Honestly wasn't planning on ordering when I came here with friends, but the food smelled so good I had to!The bi curious tacos are HUGE and come with two corn tortillas each so if you're only wanting a snack, you can share those with someone because they are definitely a meal. The short rib is great, super flavorful. The adobo chicken is very juicy and well seasoned. You have to use all the sauces- 2nd base is the best. It's vinegary and punchy and brings brightness to the heavy aspect of the meats.The Cali burrito is allegedly their most popular, but it was kind of underwhelming. It was sadly quite thin and had probably three soggy French fries in it. It also had tons of cheese and no sour cream, differing from what the menu said. It's still good, yes, but doesn't stand out. The tacos let the flavors of the meat stand on their own- get those. For $8, they're a pretty good deal.Come here for a quick bite with friends before you wander out somewhere else- it's a tiny shop and gets super crowded. They do have a bar and make cocktails in addition to beer and wine if you're wondering.",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

4,G_LDNA0fuHyiw79sRm3kaQ,Edward W.,4.0 star rating,"4.5 starsI came on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and was immediately able to snag a seat near the bar. I ordered the Cali burrito per the recommendation of the bartender. Nice thing about ordering for here is that they have three different sauces you can try with the burrito. The sauces were mild, vinegar, and hot. The mild sauce was the thickest and easiest to apply to the burrito. The vinegar and hot sauces were very liquidity, oily and quite messy. All three sauces went well with the burrito, and the hot sauce wasn't actually very hot. What makes it a Cali burrito are the fries. The carnitas is very flavorful and not overpowering. The avocado sour cream doesn't even really taste like sour cream. I don't like sour cream and it was good. Burrito almost a bit bland without the sauces. I thoroughly enjoyed the burrito here and look forward to trying their other specialities.",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

We only got take out and didn't dine in.I ordered the bi-curious tacos($7.95),plan b-rito($9.95) and the nice buns($7.95). The order was available for pick up in about 25 minutes. Once I got home, I excitedly opened up my food.First thing I ate was the nice buns, which were crispy fried pork belly on a nap bun. The pork was fried nicely where it was slightly crispy but the meat still juicy. The bao was pretty standard but the main selling point is the pork belly, which tasted great.The best thing to me out of the whole order was the plan b-Rito. It is a meat lover's dream with longanisa, eggs, cheese, ham, hash browns and bacon. While there is only ham and bacon, they provide chunky amounts of it. The eggs and hash browns give it a breakfast feel and he cheese is the finishing touch on it. It looked small in the box but was definitely very filling.

Fries were crunchy.... It was just ok.I would try it again if I'm around that area .....the tacos sound really good.  My daughter enjoyed the Plan B burrito.  Staff was very friendly, good music, calamansi juice was on point.  Just beware....its more of a take out place....its tight if you eat with the family especially with kids.",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

The ONLY thing I would've liked to know is that the food we chose some of it was super spicy and I'm not a fan of spicy food. I could definitely tell the food would've been amazing if it wasn't so spicy. My favorite was a California burrito, it was delicious!!! The ube ice cream was delicious too.

They dont even have Shanghai lumpia. Definitely go all out and will return back to try their food again as their menu seem interesting.Ordered their Dan Dan Noodles.   Was not good.  Not much flavor just spicy.  Noodle was like instant noodle type loaded with meat and grease.  Do not recommend this even though it was $8.Adobo Rito-  Very flavorful.  Chicken was very juicy.  Add hot sauce married.   I was impressed how the burrito came out really hot and fresh.Calamansi- Filipino lemonade- very good and light. Overall we had a great vibe with this place which left in curiosities about their other food trying to figure out the Filipino part of it. Definitely in confusion.  Definitely go back their taco and bowls.  Hope we can get seats. Torn between 3 or 4 stars.,Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

Its a tiny little restaurant and it was packed when my friends and I arrived but we were greeted with a warm welcoming and they made room and got us some stools so we were able to sit immediately. The menu had good options, there was Filipino food with their own flare on it, which we were excited to try. The food was very tasty and we loved everything for the most part. The ONLY thing I would've liked to know is that the food we chose some of it was super spicy and I'm not a fan of spicy food. I could definitely tell the food would've been amazing if it wasn't so spicy. My favorite was a California burrito, it was delicious!!! The ube ice cream was delicious too. I will definitely be back to this place, it was cute, and the staff was very friendly..I would just ask that my food isn't so spicy.

39,LxRKgAcFhIBzHSzEL3gffg,Jenny G.,3.0 star rating,Went for a late night snack so call.   Very cozy area place.  Bar seats and a table by the window.  The waiter was very nice and chatful.  Some Filipino fusion confusion!  We had Filipino food many times and love it.  Trying to figure out what is so Filipino about this place besides for their name of food. They dont even have Shanghai lumpia. Definitely go all out and will return back to try their food again as their menu seem interesting.Ordered their Dan Dan Noodles.   Was not good.  Not much flavor just spicy.  Noodle was like instant noodle type loaded with meat and grease.  Do not recommend this even though it was $8.Adobo Rito-  Very flavorful.  Chicken was very juicy.  Add hot sauce married.   I was impressed how the burrito came out really hot and fresh.Calamansi- Filipino lemonade- very good and light. Overall we had a great vibe with this place which left in curiosities about their other food trying to figure out the Filipino part of it. Definitely in confusion.  Definitely go back their taco and bowls.  Hope we can get seats. Torn between 3 or 4 stars.,Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

The only other seating is at the bar. On our first visit, my mother and I shared the off-the-menu item - a tortilla filled with short-Rib and cheese that was then grilled to crunchy perfection. It's was $12 and huge - filling for both of us. And that short rib was super tender and flavorful!Mom was then email a $5 off coupon, so we were happy to return again. This time we got a burrito filled with Pulled chicken, pork belly, avocado and cheese. Talk about awesome! The chicken had some kind of sauce that absolutely punches you in the face with flavor - so good!!

So when I stopped by for lunch last week, it was no surprise that I ended up jamming out while eating my pork buns and tacos lol!Pork buns we're nicely cooked, juicy with the right amount of sauce. Adobo tacos were on point and if you add their garlic vinegar sauce... Money!! So good. Moving on to the Cali burrito.. definitely a bit on the heavier side, but all the workings of fried delicious unhealthily goodness are wrapped up in a tasty tortilla. Would no recommend ordering it along with multiple other dishes. (I ended up sharing all 3 dishes and left stuffed)The joint is a bit small but the decor is fun and welcoming along with th staff.

Prices on all the items were inexpensive.  There was no wow factor with the flavor. I was disappointed with the pork buns, the kimchi fried tasted sour (we left it), and the short-rib tacos were okay. Our server was really friendly and he made us feel welcomed.

I never got the time to come make my way over here, but saw their monthly special was a Filipino style ramen and I had to check it out.Unfortunately they sold out by the time they got there, but it didn't matter because I was eager to try something else from the menu as well, called the ""Cali Burrito"". My group of three took the seating by the window, it was pretty cold but the waiter was so accommodating in plugging in the heater for us.So all together we ordered a side of fries, the Flip -N-Out Burger, Chicharrones, and 2 orders of the Cali Burrito.Everything was really delicious, and as a Filipino-American, I can say that this isn't authentic Filipino food, but it's a great fusion of it with some Mexican inspiration as well.The main star was the Cali burrito which is chicken adobo and pork belly with pico de Gallo, guacamole, French fries and cheese and sour cream. I've had Cali burritos in Cali and this is a great rendition of it. Even my boyfriend who ordered the burger preferred this burrito over the burger.The burger was really good and had nice flavor, the only complaint was that the burger patties were relatively small compared the the actual bun and it just seemed a little smaller than what I've seen from other pictures. It's supposed to be a double stack, but it still looked like a single patty ? That's the reason for 4 stars.The burrito itself is something I am willing to come back for all over again.

The nice buns were good too. It was pretty good flavor but I thought the pork belly itself was a little dry.The best part of the meal was definitely the ube ice cream!!

Be sure to experiment with their three sauces, I had a lot of fun, trying different combinations for each bite...haha. The adobo chicken was on point also. Super balanced and nice with the rice.

Although Orlando has some great food options, we are lacking when it comes to Filipino food.     We stopped in on a Monday afternoon for lunch and sat at the bar. The server got right over to us and told us about the specials. We both ordered drinks (nothing like happy hour on a Monday). There were a decent amount of happy hour specials, including the calamanci margarita. I ordered this for my first drink and really liked it. For my second drink, I did calamanci with vodka. I don't drink calamanci on a regular basis, but it reminds me of childhood (minus the alcohol!).     For food, my husband ordered the cemita style sandwich, which was one of the specials. It was a good size sandwich and really yummy and juicy. I ordered two tacos- chicken and fish. I love fish tacos. These fish tacos are totally different than any kind of fish tacos I've ever had, but in a good way.

It was full when I arrived, so I ordered to go and took my goods to the small park two blocks up. I ordered the Nice Buns, the Cali Burrito and a cup of lemonade. The food came out pretty quickly and the service people were super warm and friendly.The baos were very delicious with a great meat to fluffy bun ratio, plate-licking worthy sweet/tangy sauce and fatty pork belly. The Cali burrito was pretty yummy but on the greasier side, which made me not really want to finish it all (blasphemy to the burrito gods I know!) The combination of ingredients (porkbelly, pulled chicken, sour cream, French fries and avocado) was kind of unusual (akin to something a drunk/high person might throw together at 3am on a Friday night). But they go perfectly together! I also tried all 3 of their salsas and preferred the first base one (mild) as it wasn't too spicy for my weak ass (lol the third one did really kick haha) and the second one was too vinegary for my salsa needs. The lemonade was decent - not too sweet and not too sour. Overall a very solid place.

The teriyaki sauce that accompanied it was to die for.Pork tacos - also very delicious with a little bit of the green tomatillo salsa and the right kiss of ginger and great tortillas led to my devouring this entire dish.The Nachos - the mango salsa was really good and the chips were really well cooked... at least I am telling myself that the chips were housemade... if they weren't tell me where you got them from please. Crema and guac sauce on top led to one of the better bites I have had this trip.THE VERDICT:This is a really short review for me... but this team does food right so there is little to critique and little else to say besides... so delicious!

The Shortrib taco had some tender meat and some tart notes from the tamarind slurry topped with fried chicharrones.

I got super excited to share a bowl of garlic rice, adoborito and the California burrito. Followed by two Montauk summer ales and you can't go wrong...right?! Well, for starters the garlic rice didn't have any taste to it. I had talked it up so much to my husband that all he could do was give me that disapproving side-eye.

Not the same marinated flavor it contained on our previous visit. The California burrito was pretty tasty but the fries weren't very hot when we received it so that first bite ended being a lukewarm/coldish, minus that crisp texture that the fries and melted cheese would've blown out of this world. 5 stars for taste/service via our 1st visit; 3 stars on taste for our last.",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

Buttery fried rice with kimchi/veggies/egg mixed in; solid with a bit of hot sauce. Tacos are flavorful - helped by the trio of sauces placed in front of me.

We got the happy hour margarita ($6) and the bicurious tacos, nice buns, ($5each) and the plan Brito ($10) which is only offered on the weekends so obviously we had to get it. The names of the items on the menu are so great and have that new york humor only new yorkers can laugh at but everyone else finds offensive. The margarita was xtra strong. I didnt know where the mixer was in my drink because it tasted like straight tequila. The solo cups they put your drinks in arent plastic either its a ceramic cup made to look like the red beer pong cups and i found that really cute. The tacos were good but the tortilla fell apart once i picked it up and i wished they double layered the tortilla just to hold up the protein in it.

The longanisa is delicious! - Nice Buns: love the crispy pork belly, the sauce is yummy too- Tacos: had the short rib and adobo chicken tacos, they really pile on the meat which is awesome- Flip ramen: January special. The crispy pork belly is awesome, but the broth was really salty and the bok choy seemed to be missing from my bowl. A little disappointed. - Ube macapuno ice cream: very natural ube flavor, not artificial tasting at all, and not too sweet, love it.

Also heard them tell someone on the phone the same thing about the secret menu. I guess it could be a little frustrating but it's all part of the fun.

They figured out how to put a Filipino spin, for the better, on some of the best food joints throughout California! In-And-Out, L&L Hawaii, and Alberto's Mexican Restaurant...watchout!!I honestly was extremely skeptical of this place because I've tried dozens of Mexican restaurants in NYC that claim to have a ""LA"" or ""California style"" burrito. I've also eaten at the overhyped ""Marharlika"" in the east village. None of these places even came close to how delicious the food was at 2nd City.One thing I wish they had was a carne asada California Burrito but glad they don't add rice as filler in their burritos like every other Mex restaurant in NYC!",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

My friends ordered the tacos and the off the menu item. I got their signature bowl. I was expecting more flavor. The portions were big but there was barely any flavor. They have a variety of hot sauces on the side for you but for me it ended up tasting strange with the bowl. They have a variety of Filipino drinks. It's interesting to try but I am a lover of Filipino food and was not impressed. Overall it was a bit more average than I would have hope as I was extremely excited to try it when I found it on yelp.

Pricing was fair and staff was friendly and they played 90's music (throwback for all the 90's kids). Very chill vibe, I love it! So many vibrant colors!They had three sauces available and I suggest using them. The fish taco was pretty good, but the short rib taco was super juicy and flavorful. The Sinigang Bowl can use a bit more flavor. I had to use some of the sauces (continuously) to be satisfied with it. Their burritos are bomb though, especially the Adobo-Rito.

This restaurant has been on my bookmarks for a while as I love trying different takes on Filipino cuisine and fusion cuisine.The spot itself is very cool, with mostly bar seating and a small table by the window. This is definitely not the best spot to come with a large group because seating will be a struggle. The menu items are written on some skateboards displayed on the wall, which is a really creative and unique decor idea. Based on the reviews from Yelp, I ordered the Bicurious Tacos (any two tacos - I chose adobo chicken and short rib) and my fiancé ordered the Sinigang Flip Bowl (because he loves anything involving garlic fried rice). The food came out really quickly, which is a plus. My tacos were smaller than expected which is fine because I wasn't too hungry, but someone else might not be able to make a meal out of them. The flavors were very bold but the adobo chicken and short rib tacos tasted exactly the same... maybe they were the same? I really couldn't tell the difference. The winner was the chicharrones sprinkled on top which added the perfect amount of crunch. My fiancé said that his bowl was good but nothing to rave about. We washed it down with some Montauk beer served in cute red Solo cups. Price is very reasonable in spite of the smaller portion sizes. Our servers/bartenders were friendly and prompt but engaged in some pretty unprofessional conversation (i.e. lots of profanity) while we were eating. This didn't personally bother me but might not have been everyone's cup of tea.

Sinigang is a Filipino classic: tomato-y sour soup with veggies and either pork or fish or some type of protein. For this bowl, the sinigang was dry! They sinigang'Ed the vegetables and put it over rice with a good tasty serving of beef short rib. Definitely a must-try. The chicharron appetizer served with suka (vinegar and spices) was bomb too.

Although the space is small, we were able to find a seat immediately and were greeted by what seemed to be genuinely cheerful hellos. We tried the sinigang bowl, Cali-rito, and ube macapuno ice cream. The sinigang was very tasty with large helpings of meat and veggies. The Cali-rito has so much potential, but was a total miss today. First off, the left half of my burrito was visibly burnt. Secondly, the fries (it comes with fries inside) tasted like they had been sitting in the deep fryer all day and dunked again in hot oil. Lastly, the description said it came with avocados or avocado crema - the entire reason I ordered the Cali-rito to begin with - and avocado taste was non-existent. Again, I will be coming back, probably to order another bowl. Also, if you order the ube ice cream, you have to specify that you want it on a cone, which may seem obvious to others, but we didn't see serving options on the menu and received our scoops in a flimsy plastic cup that unfortunately made me feel like it should've been half the price.",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

The place itself was a lot smaller than I expected but since we came so early there was no wait for seating. Most of the seating was ""bar"" type seating. The place itself was super cute and hipster. The workers were really friendly and they had red solo type cups for water which I thought was pretty cool. The food menu isn't huge and they do not have a million options but then again they are a pretty small place. I had really high expectations for the food but it fell short of my expectations. -Poke Me: This was the dish that I got and the tuna itself was really tasty and flavored nicely which I really enjoyed. However, I felt like the overall taste of the whole dish wasn't amazing and it did not really blow my mind. It just tasted alright in my opinion. -Adoborito: My best friend got this and it was pretty bomb in my opinion. Very tasty the flavors went extremely well together. This was hands down the best dish of the night. -Sinigang Bowl: My other friend got this and it was very meh. The flavors did not really go well together and it just was not that tasty.

Though the Plan B-rito was good, due to the weekend availability only (always count on limits to generate hype), I thought the always available Adobo-rito was better. The Plan B consists of sausage, ham, bacon, egg, cheese, and avocado. However, the sausage and hash browns stood out the most, being the dominant flavor profile of the dish and overshadowing the other ingredients. Eventually, the hash browns win. Don't get me wrong, it's a good first few bites, but eventually texture wise, it's all mushy. The Adobo-rito on the other hand had a great flavor dimension going - no flatness here! You get the tartness from the kimchi fried rice (they do not skimp on the kimchi taste here!) and the sweetness from the soy chicken. My only compliant for this burrito would be the chicken to rice ratio - I wish there was a lot more chicken. 3/4 of the time I felt like I was just eating a kimchi fried rice burrito (not that that was a bad thing), but every time I had a bite of chicken, it was delicious.

Waiters very friendly. I got the adobo-rrito and put that 2nd base salsa all over it. Yum! I ordered the secret menu 'tap that ube', which is ube macapuno icecream sandwiched between pandan puto! Sooo good! Love that there are free refills on the calamansi juice (my fave)... The waiter even gave me some to go :) I've been here more than a handful of times since and have received the same great service, and food is consistently amazing! The plan b burrito (available on weekends only) is delicious--one of the best breakfast burritos I've had. The flip n out is just like in-n-out but better!

This place doesn't have too many seats available so the wait may be long if you're looking to sit and eat. The vibe is definitely an beach vibe and so it's a great place to grab and go. The bartenders and waiters are always nice and attentive. I would recommend the pass the bowl and nice buns (bao). The pork is absolutely delicious in the bao or the nice buns as they call it and the bowls are made with fresh ingredients and a flavor blast in your mouth. Your taste buds will thank you.

104,CdyOXJQg0e9Q8o_zFvvqlA,Julie C.,4.0 star rating,"Funky and casual spot near West Village serving Asian and Mexican-inspired bites! I came here a couple times, once with a friend to catch up and once to get takeout with my boyfriend (because they didn't have available seating). The decor and vibes at the place are spot on, and it's super close to the Highline so it's a great location! I think the food warrants a 4/5 -- it was tasty and came out fast, but was definitely not the best Asian tacos/sandwiches I've ever had. I had the Nice Buns, which were some tasty pork bellies in buns and satisfied me but didn't wow me. Also tasted the Hot Fili chicken sandwiches, which I think were a bit tastier than the pork belly. That said, I'd definitely recommend the purple yam ice cream, which was delicious. It tasted a bit like cold mashed taro, in a good way, and it was really creamy and had bits of yam skin in it which I liked.This is a good spot for either a quick meal before a walk on the Highline, or if there's any free seating, a nice long hangout!",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

Seriously loved. The flavors, the meat, the tang, the spice, and the rice. I used - Hot sauces - they got three - first base, 2nd base, and third. All are good and specific ones kick up the flavor or spice with the dishes they complement. just ask the servers for whats good with what.- Hot fili chick - love that they come in twos so you don't have to share!

Calamansi Lemonade: A not too sweet lemonade that was truly refreshing! Poke Me ($14.95): Being on the hunt for the best poke, I figured I should try it here as well. A hearty portion of tuna, scallions, carrots, wontons, avocado and pickled red onions lay upon coconut rice topped with sweet miso. It was interesting. I felt the sweet miso overpowered a lot of the ingredients leaving my tastebuds struggling to taste the quality of all the ingredients, especially the tuna. Bi-Curious Tacos ($8.95): For one small butter poached barracuda and slow braised short rib taco, I wouldn't say for the flavor and size it was worth $8.95. The butter poached barracuda had a kick of spice that left me wondering, WHY?? It overpowered the quality and taste of the true star. The short braised short ribs also left me asking, WHY?? As I took a huge gulp of lemonade to rid the taste of overpowering pickled cabbage.  UGHNice Buns ($7.95)The menu states crispy pork belly. What I had was a charred and dried pork belly slice between buns that's overpowered with an overly sweet sauce.  ERGGGG. It was a good concept I just don't feel like it was executed well. Ube Ice cream:Different textures incorporated into this scoop of yummy purple yam ice cream made this the WINNER. From the coconut flakes to the purple yam that wasn't overly sweet, this reminded me of red bean ice cream I ate as a child. This small restaurant has a variety of dishes and while the ideas are creative, execution left me disappointed. Enjoyed the decor and ice cream but most likely won't be back.",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"
112,uvI5nOW0fTcV4AV02Q8-wQ,Eric J.,4.0 star rating,"There was quite a bit of hype coming into this visit, and I have to say, 2nd City performed admirably. I wasn't sure how casual it was going to be, even after researching on Yelp, so we decided to just go on a Sunday night, and it worked out well, because the place is SUPER casual. There's mostly just bar seating, as well as a very small area for tables, so you don't necessarily come here for a long meal. The bar comes with different spicy and sweet sauces, for your dipping and burrito-filling pleasures. Phrasing? My experience with Filipino food (or Filipino-fusion) is relatively limited, but I do like the flavors that I've had before.We ended up getting the pork belly buns, the Plan-B Rito, and the Adoborito, which were all the menu items that came in highly touted. The pork belly buns were pretty standard with the pickles and scallions, but at least fairly filling and not completely fatty, like some other places *cough* Momofuku *cough*. Both burritos were excellent, but I'd have to say that I liked the Plan-B Rito better, as it had eggs, which I'm always a fan of, and the sweetness from the longanisa (sausage) made the entire burrito have a very unique flavor profile. The Adobo-rito was still very good, and had a lot of sour notes that went well with the fried rice and chicken. Perhaps it was that the Adobo-rito used a leaner cut of meat, but I would still prefer the Plan-B rito (only served on Sat and Sun) any day.Service was very attentive and quick with water and our food came out relatively quickly. The prices were great for the amount of food, with the burritos at about $9, which is impressive compared to the likes of Chipotle and Dos Toros. If you want to switch up your usual Asian fusion fast-casual game, look no further than 2nd City. I can't speak for the authenticity, but the food is tasty, and the casual atmosphere and competitive pricing make it a place to visit right away. I'll have to come back for the Ube ice cream and try some of the other offerings, but I really like what I've seen.",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

However, the service here is awesome! The guy working at the bar took our order and really catered to our needs. My friend and I weren't really that hungry so we had an order of the bi-curious tacos (two tacos of our choice) and the famous ube ice cream. For the tacos, we got the short ribs and fish taco. The fish was very soft, fresh and lightly breaded. I would've liked it more if it was more seasoned but nothing a little hot sauce couldn't fix. The short ribs exceeded my expectations! It was juicy and flavorful. They also did not cheapen out on the portion of meat! I LOVED the ube ice cream :) It really tasted like yam and is much better than any ube ice cream I've had. There were coconut flakes that were mixed inside which went really well with the ube. However, I thought it was really small for $5.

118,6Aio3j0rfgqMAW6QrGo6Rw,Mark T.,3.0 star rating,"Stopped in here for the bao, but ended up getting the Curry Bowl instead. I'm terribly sorry to give only 3 stars, especially since this is a spin on the owner's grandma's dish. The dish was a perfect portion for lunch! It will not fill you, but there's just enough to hold you off until dinner! I could tell that the dish was made with love, even though it is served in a restaurant setting. I also realize that curry is like whisk(e)y, not everyone loves or even likes it. That said, while the flavor didn't fully agree with me, I DO realize that this is more a matter of personal taste than something being wrong with the dish. The dish was very simple, there was rice, potato, chicken, and sauce. Four wonderful, simple, fresh, perfectly cooked ingredients. Unfortunately, this comes as a double edged sword, in terms of variety of flavors, and in terms of texture.Again, everything was soft, tender, and perfectly cooked, and the curry brought everything together! But, the consistency of the dish was rather uniform. Sure, there is some distinction between the texture of the rice, potato, and chicken, but not very much. I would have liked something extra, even if on the side, to add a different texture dimension. Because of the lack of vegetables, a small side salad would have been perfect!  My issue with the flavor is similar, while the sauce does bring everything together, because the potatoes, rice, and chicken have very mild flavor, and the sauce itself was very mild, the flavors were like the consistency, very uniform. When I enjoy a dish, there is a multitude of flavors working together in my mouth. Because of the way this dish was structured, there wasn't a multitude of flavors working together, as there was generally only one flavor. By themselves, these would not be significant issues, however, when they are combined, the uniform texture AND flavor is what hurts this dish the most.I will say that they do have hot sauces on the counter, but the reason I did not allow this to cover it is that while these sauces were quite good, I did not find them too exciting. They do add a new dimension of flavor to the dish, yes, but I still found myself really desiring that this came from the dish, and not my adding of sauce.Also, they were in the process of introducing a mango habanero sauce, which unfortunately they did not have at the time.

Their ube ice cream is all over social media. that purple ice cream is a fantastic photo opportunity but for me, i didnt taste what everyone else is raving about. And as for the food, i could put both tacos in my palm, it was so small, i couldnt taste if it was good or not. Well, i know it wasnt bad, but i couldnt get a second taste to see if its good. And it was $9. I think it would have been nice for the waiter/waitress to warn the customer about the size, to give them a headsup that they are not big and that if you are hungry, you may want to order additional items. The pancit bowl (which is a side actually) was larger than my tacos entree. The pancit bowl was actually very tasty and im actually happy that it was recommended by a fellow foodie (foodmento). Not every restaurant feeds you til you are stuffed and if i wanted to be stuffed, i wouldve went to a buffet. But spending $$ and leaving with a half empty stomach isnt my kind of meal either.  The star of the place is their ube ice cream. im not a crazy ice cream fanatic so i cant really judge but i wasnt blown away by it.

WTF!?  Are they trying to create artificial scarcity and ruin my binge/life?  Crestfallen, I patiently waited for the weekend to come and then made it my business to go (told the gf I was just going for a walk since we had recently started a diet/healthy new lifestyle).    The owner/chef is a friendly guy (impressive head of hair) and the service was excellent (despite this awkward moment:  the server gives me this ice-cold lemonade, I say thanks and start drinking it --thinking she was just being nice or trying to get into my pants, as I had not ordered one-- turns out it was for the guy sitting next to me.  Maybe I should have told her I did not order it, but I was kinda busy enjoying the deliciousness of the food and all the blood by that point had rushed to my belly, plus I'm not one to turn down a refreshing bev.  Anway, after realizing her mistake, she just made the dude another drink). The Plan B Rito was very very good (only thing is, I don't really like ham, and there was a thick  piece of it inside, so next time I will probably order it without). The pics of it online are 100% food porn at its best.  I definitely want to go back and try the Adobo Rito, kimchi fried rice, and a few other things (ask about the ""secret"" menu). They don't accept cash (kinda odd, who doesn't want a cash biz?).  Speaking of money, the prices are very reasonable.  The place is small so it might be hard to get a seat (although I walked in and got one no problem).  The ice-cream looks delicious (unfortunately, it has Carrageenan in it, so probably not a good idea to regularly consume).  Overall, I'm a fan and you should definitely try 2nd City!",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

One thing that sticks out is the price. The price range is about $7-15. While looking for food places around the gansevoort/downtown area, this place was notably cheaper than many other places. Also, their food is great! I've tried their adobo-rito. It's a great value for the quantity. It's quite filling. It taste great as well. I highly recommend it! And it's great with the different types of sauces that they have. Some of the other choices may not be as filling such as the tacos and pork buns (unless you choose them as appetizers). Service: The employees are very friendly. You are seated up close around the bar-like counter table, so service is very quick.However, it is a small store with about seating for about 9-12 people. So if it does get full, you might have to wait a while.

Everything was reasonably priced and the portion size was perfect!I tried the Adobo-Rito and the Nice Buns. The Adobo-Rito was a bit messy to eat but it is packed with flavor and a bit saltier than I would have liked. It didn't really need any of the additional sauces but I wanted to try them anyway. My favorite sauce is 3rd base, which has a nice kick to it.The real winner of this establishment is definitely the Ube ice cream! The Ube (Purple Yam) ice cream has an interesting texture and taste to it. I like that it isn't too sweet and consists of a beautiful shade of purple. Also, there is Macapuno (shreds of coconut) inside. I would come back in future to try the other items on the menu. They only opened about two month ago and has already gained popularity.

Even the most lactose intolerant person will still like ice cream. How it comes out of you is a different matter...Okay, enough dirty talk. Onto the food.The UBE ice cream is similar to the ones that I miss from my trips to Hawai'i. Ube is basically purple yam (Japanese) but the Ube at 2nd city is mixed with coconuts. The taste was quite delectable and unique. A must try if you've never tried.The BI-CURIOUS TACOS were pretty good. I'm a taco fanatic so I was judging these strictly. The short ribs were moist and flavorful. The sauces didn't really bring out or take away any flavors of the tacos in my opinion. But a good pour of sauce #2 (tangy Filipino light sauce) and sauce #3 (spicy chili sauce) did the trick. I skipped sauce #1 (Chipotle Mayo like).PLAN B RITO served ONLY ON WEEKENDS. So I will have to try this out next time. But everyone is raving about this so if you happen to be there on a weekend instead of a weekday, do yourself a favor and just order this.HOT FILI CHICK is basically moist chicken wedged in between 2 slider buns topped with cole slaw. It was simple but oh so delicious.ADOBO RITO was a pretty good burrito but I thought it could have used more flavors, the pulled chicken especially. The kimchi fried rice was good but the kimchi wasn't as pungent and sour as I would have liked it. Fortunately, nothing a little or a bit of sauce #2 and sauce #3 couldn't fix. : DI decided to order the KIMCHI FRIED RICE as a side as well to see if there was a difference compared to what was in the burrito. No difference, same lack of kimchi pungent and acidity. The eggs served sunnyside up was good though.The service was really good. Everyone was very friendly. The manager was on hand to help with any questions and to ensure that quality of food and portion was up to par. Price wise it is a little more expensive than getting Filipino food in Queens or other areas but it was well spent. THEY DON'T TAKE CASH HERE. Everything is done by card which is both a convenience and a convenience. You heard right, double convenience. Unless your card declines...Don't let that be you.The space was small and it seats about 8 comfortably including the couch like area by the door. Great decor. They do plan on expanding to other areas of NYC including Brooklyn so if you can't find the time to make a visit to this location, you can always wait until their other locations are opened.

He told me I'd have to come back and let them know how it turned out.I don't eat pork, but I wanted a breakfast burrito. I asked if they could substitute the pork for something else, my first suggestion was the adobo chicken in their other burrito. I've had an adobo chicken breakfast burrito before, so it wasn't something that I considered revolutionary, though the server looked at me as though it was. He warned me it had never been done before, and I said I'd pay extra for a different protein. Though, now that I think of it... both the burritos are the same price on all the menus I'm finding online, so I probably shouldn't have been charged extra. It was $9.70something for the whole thing.Full disclosure: I am HIGHLY particular about breakfast burritos. For me, a BB should always include eggs and potato, preferably cheese but there are exceptions.For takeout it was fine, aside from the fact they forgot the eggs. Goddamnit. I also think toasting the tortilla a bit more, as well as leaving it as a whole burrito and not cutting it in half (why on earth would you do this?) may help it travel better. It only included: - a meager amount of hash browns that had great flavor but lost any crunch it may have had to begin with- a bite of avocado and- a whole lot of flavorful (though fairly overcooked) shredded chicken adobo. I'd love to give a higher rating mostly for the extremely friendly service and two KILLER vinegar-based salsas that came on the side. The regular tomato-based salsa didn't taste like anything at all compared to the other two.Verdict: Substituting adobo is great! But needed a better balance of hash browns to chicken.

A small, quick, and to the point Filipino Taqueria !  The place itself just has bar seating and a small table on the side.  I would definitely suggest take-out during some of its peak hours.  A nice little touch is that there are USB charger outlets all around the wall (in addition to some nice artwork!) so you can charge your electronic devices as you wait and/or eat!I had the pleasure of coming by to this very small place that recently opened up.  I am honestly very critical about Filipino food since that is my background and I have to say that Jordan does a great job with the food here.  What you have to keep in mind is that this is NOT a traditional Filipino restaurant to say the least, this is a more Americanized, fusion-style place that introduces bits and pieces of Filipino food to the masses.  They also ensure that they promote the fact that this is not a traditional Filipino restaurant, to make sure the purists do not come in and be very critical about it.I sat down at the bar and began by having a drink of the Calamansi lemonade.  This drink was very refreshing, as they had a good ratio of calamansi juices in the lemonade to just have the right amount of sweetness and acidity in it.  I then got the Adobo-Rito which is braised chicken burrito with Kimchi fried rice and shredded romaine.  The chicken was cooked well and the ratio between the flavors of the rice and chicken was well established.  Nothing in the burrito was very overpowering and it was a very balanced meal.  I also was able to try a braised short rib Bi-Curious taco.  If you are Filipino, you will taste the flavor of sinigang in here.  No it is not soupy, but it is more of a sauce, or if you could imagine the based short rib in the sinigang broth and you just fish it out to place on the taco.As for dessert, this was easy, as there was only one thing here, homemade Ube ice cream!  I spoke with Chef Jordan about this and he went through a couple rounds of taste tasting to try and perfect the flavor, as there is also macapuno (coconut) in it and he wanted balance out the flavors best as possible.  I have to say that the hard work paid off, since I enjoyed this dessert. Yes the menu is not huge, but the items are very interesting to me and I shall be back to try more.  A major plus here is the very affordable price point!FYI, as of 5/25, they only accept credit card at this time.",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

Ever since someone posted about their off the menu item....ahem....""fuc me"" on instagram, I've been dying to try it. Unfortunately, I had to wait for a few months, as I was living abroad. Finally, the day had arrived when I could finally devour this! I was so excited. So I finally ordered it. I liked it but I also didn't like it.... It reminded me of what Taco Bell had/has? going on with their crunch wrap supreme. So although the ""F"" in ""fuc me"" stand for Filipino, I had no idea what was Filipino about this order. Regardless, on its own, without the Filipino aspect of it, it was alright. I think it'd be better with a bit less cheese. And the avocado in there was a really nice surprise. Oh, and wtf is up with their fries??? I love fries so when I see them on a menu, I can't control myself and order. These fries were ridiculously bad, and for that price?? McDonald's dollar menu fries taste better than what we got. That was really disappointing. I know this place doesn't specialize in fries but c'mon, if it's on your menu, serve it well.

It's a small shop with bar seating on the right and a takeout out window in the back. I had the pork buns and it was extremely dry on the point of being almost burnt. The pork had no flavor at all as it seemed to be in on a warmer for a while. With the dryness of the pork and then the bun it was just too hard to complete eating of the whole pork bun. I also had the adobo chicken kimchi fried rice. The sunnyside egg was overcooked and had no runnyness and the kimchi fried rice was a bit too wet for me as it almost seemed to be a rice porridge at times. The only items i thought was good was the side sauces. All 3 had good flavor and a spicey kick and i would definitely buy them if they were bottled and can take home. Also the calamansi drink was refreshing cold and a great drink to match with the spiceyness. For my visit here it was a miss.,Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

Instead of lime green, ambiguously flavored jello from a divey Polish bar, however, the Calamansi jello shots were both strong (tequila?) and delicious.The place is pretty tight, but given how fast the food comes out I'd wait around for a little bit until a seat opened up at the bar or corner table. For the fusion Filipino style that seems to be the angle of most of 2nd City's peers, it certainly isn't bad. Everything is probably $1-2 more than it should be, from the bao buns to the beef adobo tacos, but I can't say that they weren't delicious.With a few beers on tap, a few cocktails, and a decent deconstructed Sinigang over rice, its not a bad place at all.

Anyway on with the food:We ordered a few items on the menu. The poke on their tostada special was super flavorful. The tuna was fresh and their miso sauce was spot on. Their gauc/pico de gallo slaw on the bottom was creamy and fresh, and came with a kick. Between the crunch of the taco bottom and the fresh, cold creaminess of the fish and slaw, it was perfect. We had the chicken sliders. Its solid and tasty, but profile wise it was pretty generic. ( imagine fried chicken with mayo and slaw in a potato bun.......yep that's exactly how it tastes) I gotta give credit to the adobo-rito. It's worth a try just because it deviates from your everyday burrito....and it's actually pretty freakin awesome. Ube ice cream - not too sweet, flavorful and creamy. Don't be cheap, order it and share this one, after all that food it's the perfect wrap up. Did I mention we had calamansi and rum?? I can use another one right now as a type this.

195,wRtEn5o-8SgHs_xtGzBS2w,Jenny C.,2.0 star rating,"2nd City has exploded onto the social media scene recently. I see it constantly on my Facebook feeds and on Instagram - and everything looks so dang good. With my new discovered obsession with Filipino food, I knew I had to try it. I arrived around 2:30pm on a beautiful Sunday afternoon and this place was poppin'. This restaurant really is tiny. Not a single booth seat available was available even so late in the afternoon. There are some tree benches outside where you can enjoy your food on a nice day. A bunch of hipsters were hanging inside and outside the restaurant waiting for their food. We placed an order for the pancit, adobo-rito, and the ube ice cream. Interestingly when the lady was making me my ice cream, she asked me if I wanted one or two scoops which confuses me because there is only one set price - odd. Next I was confused when I was given the ice cream in a clear plastic cup instead of a cone that I've seen in all of the pictures. I wasn't given the option and I actually would've preferred the cone but no big deal I guess. I am not too familiar with the ube flavor and quite frankly did not know what to expect but it tasted like a much subtler version on taro and this had bits of coconut flakes which I enjoyed. We waited outside for our pancit and adobo-rito... and waited... and waited. 33 minutes later it finally arrives and no apologies were made. It better at least be worth it I thought. I've only had pancit one other time at a restaurant in Queens and it was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth, so yes my expectations were high. However the pancit was far from what I had - these noodles were, like another reviewer had said, WAY too salty. It is just noodles doused in tons of mysterious salty Asian sauces. Total disappointment. Portion was small too. I tried a few bites of my husband's adobo-rito and thought it was lacking in flavor - it was just meh. He wasn't happy about the food either. We couldn't help but to wonder if we had ordered the wrong things?I am glad that I got to try 2nd City nonetheless and the prices are quite reasonable. The restaurant is cute in terms of decor and the employees are full of energy. However I would not come back.

Would have gone in to the actual place but it's been way too cold lately.Anyways, to start I've been wanting to try this place since it opened, I really like filipino food, and put a little fusion into the mix and you've got yourself a customer. So it's like 20 degrees outside and I'm searching through seamless for something that I recognize, finally after scrolling for a few minutes I see 2nd city. It has an extra fee but F it, I'm hungry and want some good food. I ordered the pork belly buns and the adoboritto. Pork Belly Buns: got a bit messy in the to-go container and overall they were just normal buns to me. One piece was almost purely pork fat, and the sauce was alright. Honestly was a little bit disappointed since all the pictures look really good but I probably wouldn't order these again.The adobo-rito though was pretty great. The braised chicken works really great with the kimchi fried rice, the only thing is I wish there was like a hot sauce or something to go with it, maybe a ssam sauce would be dope. Anyways I would order this burrito over and over. I'll definitely be hitting up 2nd city again there are a few other things I've seen on the menu that I want to try out.

198,9QBmszzwsgJuD5WgvLChxA,Tracey M.,2.0 star rating,"My rating is solely for the poke bowl which I honestly was not a fan of. Me and a friend came here just for this as we saw it advertised one day (play on Pokemon on the sign outdoors) as we walked by. It's possible that I'm simply comparing it to Hawaiian poke and west coast poke, or just really fresh poke I've had many times before. 2nd city poke is served with pickled onions, shredded carrots, avocado and crunchy wonton croutons on top of a sweeter (notes of coconut milk perhaps?) white rice. It's topped with raw tuna which tasted marinated or cured in some way.I would have preferred:- tuna without major marination as it was sour, and that clashed with the pickled onions and suka sauce which I did add- carrots to have been cut smaller as they were difficult to eat- the rice was overly sticky- maybe a variety- choose the poke over rice or a salad (as long as it's bouncy and has body)Overall it did not taste well rounded, the dish felt like it wasn't truly a bowl since I found myself wanting to eat everything separately. I was expecting more savory-possibly-sweet and for the fish to shine, but was disappointed with the fish quality.My two cents would be to improve this item since it is really something that isn't common to find in restaurants and will attract customers in the city (it also comes up as one of the top 10 options on a basic Yelp search) Though admittedly, 2nd city was not strong enough to make me want to return to try other things on the menu.

Staff: The group that was working at the time were lively and attentive. Food: I had the Pancit bowl with Chicharrones on the side. The Pancit bowl was a twist on the traditional noodle dish I've had in the past, so it was a little stronger in flavor, but I think if there were more noodles in the dish, it might have a better balance. The Chicharrones were great. How could you not like fried fatty pork :). My roommate got the fil-n-out burger and was super happy with it, though he didn't think there was enough banana ketchup.

207,4tixHVl3dS5fTDzx5-k1kQ,Nicholas K.,5.0 star rating,"It's such a rarity to find a restaurant where the owner is the chef, bartender, server, everything-relevant, but that doesn't seem to stop Jordan from being the kindest, most enthusiastic person to his customers. The interior gives off such an energy that, without a doubt, emanates from his personality -- it's a combination of old school and new school but everything integrates so perfectly yielding a fun, down-to-earth, clean restaurant with some funk.I tried out the special ""Lola's Curry Bowl"" which, if you're a fan of the chef's, you'll see tons of pics all over his and the restuarant's IG and my gawd was it fantastic. He explained that it's his grandmother's recipe and somehow he still managed to capture the homey, warm, comforting elements of the dish that aren't exactly tangible. What's even better is that the dish was complimented so well by his hot sauces - 1st, 2nd, 3rd bases - which are mild to hottest in that order. 1st base was more of a salsa, tomato paste consistency and gave wonderful flavor. My favorite, 2nd base, had a vinegar kick to it. And 3rd base was more of a pickled chili-esque. As an Asian, none of the hot sauces were exactly ""hot"" to me but they offered different flavor profiles that complimented the dish in their own ways.I also had the ""Nice Buns"" which were, in my opinion, a bit disappointing especially considering it's one of the signature dishes. The pork belly was dry and sinewy and it was absolutely drenched in the BBQ sauce making it near impossible to taste the scallions and pickles. Perhaps it was a bad batch, I'll definitely give them a second chance.Overall, this place is definitely worth trying out. If the funky vibe or boisterous guy behind the bar won't win you over, I can guarantee the food will. I'll be coming in here frequently to try their burrito, burger, and famous ube ice cream.PS: They started going Happy Hour now! I believe it was Monday-Friday 3-6 PM.

I've never tried any of the other modern Filipino fusion type restaurants in the city, so this being my first time was great. Service was awesome. The general manager was telling us all about the menu, what the popular items are and what his favorite menu items are. He also told us the history of the place and the meaning behind the design and what the future goals of the restaurant are. My friend decided to go for the Poke Me bowl and I went with the Bi-curious tacos. We both loved our dishes. The flavors of the tacos were perfect and filling without being too heavy. The fish went so well with the bok choy in the tortilla, it reminded me of a sinigang flavor. The chicharron was a great added texture on top of the short rib taco. The tacos were both so flavorful, I didn't need to add any extra sauces to the dish. It was also my first time trying calamansi lemonade, refreshing and sweet without being too overbearing! I wish I knew the name of the secret menu item, that resembles taco bell's crunch wrap before I made my order. The manager gave us the tip that some people have posted it on Instagram and Yelp, and after digging thru I was able to find the name. Won't ruin the mystery for you guys as that ruins part of the fun. I would definitely love to try it next time. I also wish I could try the Plan B-rito, but it's only offered on Saturday and Sunday. It's truly such a great idea to have a Filipino taqueria. It's a great way to have the Filipino cuisine become more part of the mainstream market, where other Asian cuisine has dominated for so long.

Very flavorful and tender.  Delicious sauce.  The Adobo-Rito had the perfect kimchi fried rice to chicken ratio.  I wanted to save room for the Pancit, so I just ate the inside after a few bites.I loved the Pancit at first, but then it became overwhelmingly too saucy. I am a big fan of sauce, but this was way too much.  So much that the noodles were too wet.  The flavors were all there, but I think if you decrease the sauce just a little.. it would also take away all the salt that I was tasting as well.I liked all of the salsas, but I think the 2nd Base Salsa - serrano chili, onion/garlic vinegar was the best one.I need to come back to try the ice cream!BTW - service was great.  Bartender/server was very attentive and friendly.

It packs a lot of flavor with a great balance of savory and saltiness. Add any of their signature sauces to give it an extra degree of bitterness or spiciness. The pork bao are delicious too. I'd highly recommend these as well. The pork is crispy on the edge yet soft on the interior. The sauce adds sweetness and savoriness. I like the addition of scallions adding elements of freshness, crispiness, and a touch of bitterness. It all came together well in the freshly steamed bun.We also ordered the poke bowl with short rib instead of tuna because they were out of tuna.

In my book, its a pretty big sin to have a burrito without cheese but Joe insisted on me ordering the adobo burrito if i was a fan of burritos (which i obv am) and it did not disappoint. There are 2 major ingredients in this burrito- kimchi rice and adobo chicken. The kimchi rice was amazing! Seasoned and cooked for just the right amount of time. Now, getting chicken in a burrito usually scares me because 9 out of 10 times the meat is dry but the adobo chicken was the complete opposite. Spiced to perfection and perfectly moist. They also had a decent selection of hot sauces, although i'm hopping they will come out with a hotter one that is less vinegaryOh and did i mention how cheap it was ($8 for a very decently sized burrito)I will definitely be back for the ""secret"" menu items.

Since there's really not much space for waiting inside it was a bit awkward standing behind the people at the bar while we waited for the server to scoop our ice cream (luckily it didn't take very long). The ube ice cream itself is very interesting for lack of a better word, and might be off putting to some. Ube is purple sweet potato and the ice cream had a powdery texture very reminiscent of the actual potato. It's a bit similar to taro, and also has coconut bits in it. They're very generous with the size of their scoops.Determined to try their food, I came back again about a week later except at a later time (around 9pm) and lo and behold, there were open seats! I got a calamansi lemonade, which was really nice and refreshing to sip on while I waited for my adobo-rito to come out. It's kind of like a pseudo lemon/limeade, but with a lighter flavor and more sweet than tart. The adobo-rito was great - the kimchi fried rice goes surprisingly well with the chicken adobo. They have three hot sauces (1st, 2nd, and 3rd base); my favorite was 3rd.The two servers (Josh & Josh) were super friendly, helpful, and easy to talk to!

First and foremost.....be warned that this is in fact a very small and intimate space, so I would not come with a huge party. The size is actually one of the features that I liked most about 2nd City. Next comes the service, every employee that I spoke with was very nice. When I first arrived I ordered a margarita, which I was not too much a fan of because I felt as though it was a little too much juice to liquor ratio. The bartender was very understanding and she helped me select a beer from the Philippines which I happened to enjoy very much. I knew I wanted to order the burger and I was very happy as I took my first bite. The patty was juicy, the kimchi sauce was tasty, and the whole combination of what was on that burger just worked very well together. Next we had the Bi-Curious Tacos. Both the chicken and short rib were very tasty, but the tacos just weren't for me. My friend happened to enjoy them. The nice buns were yummy as well......but still did not top the burger though in my opinion. During happy hour the tacos and the nice buns were $5 each, which was a great price for the portion given. Last but not least, the ice cream. This was a new experience for me because I had never before tried an ice cream made from a sweet potato root. I was pleasantly surprised. Be warned, there are a lot of coconut shavings in this ice cream if that is not something you enjoy. I like coconut shavings so it did not bother me that much. This wasn't my favorite ice cream; however, I really enjoyed experiencing it! Overall, I enjoyed my visit to 2nd City and I would visit again :)",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

However, I was happy to be surprised.What makes the adoborito different from home cooking is the kimchi fried rice which adds a different flavor as compared to a typical Filipino garlic rice. The variety of sauces were also good complements to the burrito. I also had the nice buns which were named appropriately.

Well granted I didn't have the ""tap that ube"" so I will be back, but for now .. holy crap everything is over salted.I had the adobo-rito and had high expectations. Growing up I had a lot of Filipino friends that attended my school and they always treated me with amazing lumpia and adobo, so I'd like to think I know the Filipino food profile pretty well and boy was the Adobo-rito disappointing. Just so salty that after my first bite I had to keep chugging water to keep up with the meat the seemed to ooze salt. The second base sauce was excellent, so maybe I'll drown it in that next time.That being said, I was able to taste the plan b-rito and that was excellent, so I'll have to write off the adobo-rito as an exception rather than a rule. Was fortunate enough to try the ube as well and while the coconut pieces were nice in the ube. Again, I'll have to go back to my child hood days of having ube and halo halo ice cream in San Francisco and can say this was a barely passable attempt. Go to Mitchell's in San Francisco for their ube and you'll know what I'm talking about. Anyways, I think I have to be wrong about the hype here, but I'll come back and check out the pancit bowl and something else, but for now, disappointing.",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

It's a very clean and chill type of restaurant. Super friendly and cool staffs. THE FOOD:ADOBO-RITO - filipino twist on the regular burrito. It's loaded with flavor and had me wanting more with every bite. It's stuffed with finger licking good meat and some lettuce. The ratio of meat to lettuce was fabulous. BI-CURIOUS TACOS - one is short rib and the other is fish. Super juicy and delicious. There are 3 sauces and they're 1st, 2nd, & 3rd base. The higher the number the spicier the sauce. Definitely give those sauces a try. It pairs extremely well with the tacos and the adobo-rito. It brought out even more depths of flavor. DESSERTS:MANGO ICE CREAM - has small slices of coconuts with every lick/bite. It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. It's a light yellow scope of happiness on a cone. Love the coconut slices within every scope, It's combined smoothly and paired up nicely together. UBE ice cream - what a WONDERFUL HIT! So delicious. The flavor really reminded me of just eating a purple yam that was freshly cooked. It's flavor was well received as an ice cream.***HIDDEN GOODNESS***TAP THAT UBE! - This is an off the menu dessert! It's an ice cream sandwich. The sandwich is made of green fondant cake. Then it's layered with this thick and rich coconut cream. In the middle is a scope of their greatness, the ube ice cream. Such a beauty to look at and definitely very very tasty. Tip: You can only order Tap That Ube ONLY if you say those three words. So tell their fantastic staffs that you want to ""Tap That Ube.""",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

Jordan, the owner/chef, was working at the bar, and it was an awesome experience to talk to the person that designed the menu. It's a nice personal interaction that you don't find very often in the city.We ended up getting the Nice Buns, the weekly special (a braised beef burger/torta), and the Poke Me bowl. Food came out really fast, and it was very delicious. There's a lot of thought behind all the flavors that go into each dish.Nice Buns: Jordan mentioned working on getting the Asian bao buns to the same standards as Ippudo's buns, and the hard work definitely paid off! I like that the pork belly here is a bit meatier than the more fat-heavy pork belly I typically see at ramen places that serve similar pork buns.I also got the Calamansi lemonade (it's house made!) and the ube ice cream, both of which were truly their own flavor experiences. The lemonade was just the right balance of sweet and tart, and the ube ice cream was nice and creamy, with coconut pieces blended in to give it some texture.I'm very glad I made the trip downtown to try 2nd City out.",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

Josh explained the menu and was super helpful. I got the adobo burrito which I personally thought was too salty for my taste. The kimchi fried rice added a great flavor and the crunchiness of the lettuce was perfect. I don't think I will order this again if I come back though. My friends got the tacos and the plan b-ritto and enjoyed it. They especially liked the flavors in the taco. The plan b-ritto is available only on the weekends and has hash browns in it. You can do no wrong when potato is inside your food!Things on the menu I will come back for will be the Poké bowl and the pass the bowl which seem like the healthier options available and less salty with lighter flavors. Through the suggestion of another reviewer we also tried the 'tap that ube' dessert which is a two pandan cakes with ube icecream and coconut cream in between. DELICIOUS you must try.

Staff is very warm and friendly.  There are about 8 seats at the bar and a small table along the window which seats 3 people.  Sauces - there are three sauces named first second and third base on the tables that all have a differing levels of spice (ascending).  I don't remember what's in each but the staff would be happy to explain. They also have recommendations as to what goes well with which dish. Adoburrito - marinated adobo chicken with kimchi fried rice wrapped in a burrito.  Goes surprisingly well together.  5/5Poke me - tuna sushi, avocado, deep fried crispy chips over a bed of rice. There's some type of sweet sauce on top.  Lovely dish. 5/5Pancit bowl - Filipino noodle dish in a soy sauce with shrimp and sausages. They put too much sauce in our dish I think, making it really salty towards the bottom of the bowl.  4/5Nice buns - pork belly buns, doused with sauce, too much for my liking and it was hard to eat since the marinade was overflowing from the bun. 3/5Plan B-rito - a breakfast burrito with a Filipino spin and only available on the weekend.  This was my favorite. Ham, eggs, cheese, longanisa (sweet sausage), bacon, and hash browns all wrapped in a burrito. 5/5Ube ice cream - taro ice cream with coconut shavings in it.

Got here at a good time on A sat evening. Was actually pretty surprised we didn't have to wait long. The place is super small and intimate, but the vibe is really great. The overall service is pretty decent. For some reason they forgot to bring out my side of fries with my burrito. So i ended up eating my burrito without the side that I had ordered which was pretty lame. Luckily the flavors here were so good I didn't even care anymore. I had the Cali burrito and it was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Seared Pork Belly, pulled chicken, french fries, guacamole and sour cream. The most perfect combination. The flavors just jump out at you and the food is hot when it arrives. I hate going to restaurants and the food is just warm. It just bothers me, but Flip Sigi brings u hot dishes with great flavors. The pork belly was succulent and the pulled chicken to die for. The entire burrito just gave me a warm feeling inside. Everything was cooked to perfection.  All of the food we tasted was great.

It's rare to get Barracuda though, so that deserves some bonus points.I would return for the Ube ice cream. It's thicker and melts slowly compared to other ice creams.

It's a small spot, definitely more ""dive-y"" and they made such good use of the space. They've got a cute set-up by the window, kind of like a window banquette which can be used to seating, I believe.   They've also got about 10 seats at the bar, and a grab-n-go window in the back.The decor is definitely hip, soulful, and apparent that owner is California-based, with the cool skateboard menus and graffiti art work.  Obviously the place is clean being that it's a new business, but it's also vey neat; there's a difference, I think.The three awesome guys in the floral shirts are awesome! One was the owner, the other was their GM, and the third guy was a rockstar server.Onto the food!Pancit Bowl ($6.95)This was a side dish so I was definitely not expecting it's wow-factor to be so wowful!  Best Pancit ever, hands down.  Didn't skimp on shrimp #rhymes or the Chinese sausages. The sauce... absolutely delicious. It kind of strays from the traditional Pancit because of the amount of sauce but screw it, it was good. Also appreciate the noodles being cut up into smaller pieces so I'm not having to slurp it like ramen.Nice Buns! ($9.95)These buns were super tasty, and I like that they specified that it's supposed to be crispy. I normally look for a melt in your mouth texture, but know beforehand that they were crispy made me appreciate the dish properly.  Bao's could've been warmer and fluffier though. Bi-Curious Tacos ($8.95)1 butter poached barracuda taco and 1 braised pork taco! I definitely loved the braised taco more, I couldn't really appreciate the fish taco to the fullest, cause I love me my crispy beer battered fish tacos. But the barracuda fish was super tender.Ube Macapuno Ice Cream! ($3.95)These were delicious! Creamy and dense ube cream with tons of macapuno pieces. I don't mean to be a Fatass, but I do wish there was more of it on my cone!Did I mention they make their own sauces!? They call em, 1st 2nd and 3rd base!  I'm gonna have to go with 2nd base and stay true to the motherland. It's their take on Suka (vinegar) w/ Serrano chilis.

Needless to say, I bookmarked this place and decided I had to stop by to try the ice cream.I stopped by during the afternoon and was surprised that it wasn't packed. However, people started coming in later. The interior was beautiful with a wall of graffiti and the menu was written on skateboards (very cool). There is limited seating (a bar with seats and table with a couch and some chairs). I was met with excellent service by Josh, who was attentive, friendly and helpful. Something to note is that they don't serve alcohol yet, but it is coming soon. I didn't try their calamansi lemonade, but I could tell it was popular because everyone else ordered it.Here's what my friend and I ate:- Hot Fili Chick ($9.95) - So good, but so small. This is definitely a nice way to get an appetite for more food. My friend and I actually weren't too hungry, but it was a good preview of the food to come. It has chicken breast with a slaw in  a potato bun.- Adobo Rito ($7.95) - I shared it and I would have gladly ate the whole thing. The adobo rito is a burrito filled wih soy braised chicken, kimchi fried rice and lettuce. The thing that stood out the most was that the rice was crispy and crunchy. I used the 2nd Base hot sauce which tasted great with the burrito. The - Ube ice cream ($3.95) - The ice cream is homemade (that's always a plus). Also I got the chance to meet Jordan, the chef. It was impressive to learn how long it took for him to create the the recipe. It was good, but I was more like in love with the food at the end.They also make their own hot sauces!

I was expecting a burger that was one of the best or tastiest in NYC- similar to bareburger or umami burger. The flavor of the DP burger was also pretty tame/mild for me. I just didn't feel that the Filipino or Mexican fusion nuance came through for me. I maybe needed something with a little more kick or richness to it. I would say the pork flavor was great though, I just wish I could have had more of it. The fries were extremely bland, needed more salt, and just not worth $4.95 at all.

Such a strong flavor in regards to the adobo, it's definitely more salty and more seasoned in this dish as opposed to regular adobo most probably because it's in a burrito and needs to stand out. Which it 10000% does. Matches perfectly with the pickled veggies. If for whatever reason you don't finish it TAKE IT HOME it tastes even better as lunch leftovers. Also little note, the place is so tiny so expect some sort of wait to sit down. Unless you're ordering to go. But the owner of the retardant is the guy who was serving everyone their meals.

271,pc5C0bwdOs-dI-HPOSfoIA,Devonne C.,3.0 star rating,"Love the location and casual island feeling of this fast causal restaurant. Staff is friendly and the head chef is quite charming.I'm used to having homemade Filipino food, so I was so excited to try this fusion restaurant. The food here is okay, and much better than what I've had at some other Filipino places in the city. What to order when you're here:Calamansi lemonade - when the weather is hot having a drink that's tarte, sweet, refreshing and cold is literally godsend. Hot Fili Chick sandwich - this crispy chicken sandwich is well seasoned and has a great play on texture with the crunchy chicken and the soft bread. This is an upscale version of a chick-fil-a sandwich. (And as I write this review, I'm craving it again)Other items ordered, but I'm on the fence about:Pancit - The shrimp is plump and the veg is crunchy. I liked this dish but it was a touch on the salty side.Bi-curious tacos - Love the idea of these tacos, but the fish in my taco was a little over done and the braised pork was a little tough. It was also a touch on the salty side. For Filipino food on the go this is an easy -- and busy -- place to hit up. I can see why people like it and think it's definitely a place I would try again now that I know exactly what to order.",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

We ordered the Plan B-rito & Adobo-rito to share. The Plan B-rito is very tasty and I would highly recommend it, albeit messy to eat. The adobo chicken burrito had good flavor from the chicken and kimchi rice combo, though I wish there was avocado in it. Definitely give their three house made sauces a try with your food!

It only comes with 2 tacos. I should have ordered 4..... yes it was that good. I definitely must order again, its too good!3) Pancit bowl was good too, it had a lot of cabbage, which tends to have... ummm......

They gave me a box of tortilla chips to amend for their mistake, okay I'll give them a second chance (coming up). The sliders were good, and priced okay for the area ($9.95 for 2). It seemed like the only thing worth getting.Coming here a second time, I order the Bi-curious Tacos ($8.95 for 2, 1 butter poached barracuda taco, 1 slow braised short rib taco). I'm not sure if my memory serves me correct, but I remember the tortilla being smaller than your standard Mexican corn tortillas. The filling was small, that's for sure. As I took a bite of the fish taco I end up chomping a big set of fish bones with it. It was a good thing I caught it then, before I ended up swallowing it.

It didn't have any other flavors except salty. The noodle dish was not appetizing and was coated with sauce. The kimchi fried rice burrito was the only thing that was somewhat edible. It was bland, but the hot sauces on the counter helped. We also tried the special ube ice cream sandwich. It was a weird green cupcake/cookie like top with the ube ice cream. The ice cream was good, but I could've done without the weird green top.

What a deal. Incredibly filling as there is a hefty amount of succulent chicken adobo and kimchi fried rice. I wouldn't have minded a slightly stronger kimchi taste but maybe it was toned down for those unfamiliar the fermented cabbage taste? Regardless, still a tasty burrito! I got a sampling of each of the 3 salsas too. I have a hard time decided whether I enjoyed 2nd base or 3rd base salsa more with the burrito. 2nd base had more of a sour spice due to the vinegar while 3rd base was just good ol' spiciness without making your mouth burn.

The ""Adoborrito"" is what I usually go for because one: it's big, and two:  it's incredibly delicious. The ""Hot Fili-Chick"" is also extremely tasty and one of my go-to's. As far as price goes, it's really hard to find better value in the neighborhood. The portions on the ""Nice Buns"" and the ""Hot Fili-Chick""are a little on the small side to be honest, and I usually make lunch my biggest meal of the day, but the ""Poke Me"" and the ""Pass the Bowl"" and the ""Adoborrito"" are all pretty substantial. They also have a reward program where if you buy 5 meals you get a free ""Hot Fili-Chick"" sandwich, and they do a trivia thing where they write a question (usually about 1990's and 1980's pop culture) on a chalk board outside, and if you come in and answer it correctly get it right you win free food!One of my favorite aspects of this restaurant is the staff; they're all really laid back and friendly and accommodating.  For example, today when I went in to get my usual burrito, they told me they had just run out of adobo chicken so they apologized and made me a burrito with short rib instead for the same price. Needless to say it was amazing. Furthermore, Jordan, the owner and head chef is often there and greets everyone and makes conversation with the guests.

It's definitely not your grandma's old pancit recipe or auntie Baby's chicken adobo. Of course not, it's a fusion restaurant! 2nd city took Lola's and Auntie Baby's homemade dishes and turned them into something fabulous!The must-have: those pork belly siopao buns! It's so damn basic but so damn tasty! Loved every bite of it! Tried a side of pancit bowl but honestly the bowl is big enough for an entree. It has a little spicy kick to it and if I'm not mistaken, a little hint of something sweet.. Pineapple, maybe? My sister had the adobo-ritto but coming from California where we have Filipino burritos, it wasn't that va-va-voom to me. Also had the calamansi lemonade which is a tad sweeter than your average all-American sidewalk lemonade but that's how us pinoys like it.Definitely recommended and there's likely a wait when you get there unless you go right when they open because the place is TINY.

Such a friendly greeting by both Joshs - made my solo meal a little brighter! I was recommended the Plan B rito but since I didn't feel like hash browns or scrambled egg in it, I went for the Adobo rito with kimchee fried rice, soya braised chicken, crunchy lettuce, gochujang sauce... It was really good, exceeded my expectations. Fresh, tasty, although I would have preferred the kimchee rice to be a little stronger in taste :) as I am Asian. To top it off, awesome calamansi lemon juice - service is friendly, fast, and they are just a lovely bunch - showed their appreciation when they found out I came from BCN to check them out.

Right from when you walk in, you can tell what kind of place his is going to be. It's a clean and bright. There's a mural on the wall paying homage to the owner's mother, but there are also chalkboard skateboards as the menu. It's hip, serving their drinks in mason jars. It's homey, with the different accents that they have. There are definitely a lot of interesting things to look at in this small space. As a FilAm, I love that places such as this are popping up and putting Filipino food on the map! Most often, these restaurants are modernized twists on Filipino classics. I like that they're putting their own spin on things. If I wanted something authentic, I would have my mom's home cooking or head to Woodside. One thing that doesn't change, whoever, is that sense of hospitality. The employees introduced themselves, gave us a little background and were overall just really friendly and genuine. The owner seemed eager to please and checked up on us twice even though he was busy. ANYWAY, on to the meal - - Pancit Bowl ($6.95): actually my favorite menu item. Compared to the traditional pancit, it's a lot saucier and more savory. I kid you not, this is the best pancit I've ever had. I even got one for the road! - Nice Buns($9.95): the Baos were warm, and the pork belly had a great BBQ sauce on it. - Calamansi Lemonade: I don't know why I did think of this myself. It's sweet from the calamansi, and the lemon gives it that extra acidity, making it super refreshing - Bicurious Tacos ($8.95): one barracuda and one braised short rib taco. I prefer the short rib over the fish one. There was actually a large serving of meat (compared to the size of the tortilla)- Ube macapuno Ice Cream: I appreciate that they have their own ice cream, not something that's just store bought. They mentioned that they went through a lot of tastings to make sure that it was just right, and it shows.

I ordered the bi-curious tacos which was by far the best item on the menu. I also tried the kimchi fried rice which was good but could've used a little more flavor. Another great choice is the plan b-rito! The combination of hash browns and longanisa was perfect.

Calamansi juice: fantastic - felt like I was back in the Philippines!Bi-curious tacos: I was really excited to taste the singing but unfortunately I couldn't taste the flavor he explained in either of the tacos.Nice buns: to be fair, I'm pretty tough to please when it comes to pork belly. Their pork belly could have been more tender, and he sauce was a little overpowering. But overall it was ok.Ube Ice cream: loved it!

The chicken was juicy but still maintained the crispy outer layer for each bite. It went well with the mayo and calamansi flavors. The Cole slaw on top was a nice touch to add flavor and texture as well.The bi-curious tacos were also a good mix with one being soft buttery barracuda taco and a slow braised short rib taco. The tamarind was a nice touch on the taco to give a nice touch of sweetness that didn't over power the rest. They also 3 salsas or sauces you can add to any of the items on the menu.The kimchi fried rice was also a surprising dish. Now I mean, how special could kimchi fried rice be?? Well this one was done just right! It even had the crispy rice that would usually happens when you prepare it in stone bowl. It's a simple thing to add but made it worth it.The finally was the ube macapuno ice cream. We all got two scoops and it was a great way to end the meal. The coconut combined with the ube almost makes it taste like halo halo.Overall, service is friendly and attentive, food was delicious, and the restaurant has character. You can tell the owner and chef really put a lot of thought into the whole process.I'll definitely be back on Saturday or Sunday for that breakfast burrito!",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

Went with a few friends and we split the pork buns, poke bowl, and of course, the plan B burrito. And let me just say...I could not pick a favorite! The pork buns are classic and delicious (got them the last time) the Poke bowl (Poke Me) was fresh, with what I believe was coconut rice, crispy wontons, and a bunch of other delicious goodness. Last but not least, with no need for an introduction at all...was the plan B burrito. Basically, the most amazingly delicious, perfect breakfast/hangover burrito you could ever ask for.

The place is small, but luckily it was only half full (around 3pm on a Tuesday) so we were able to sit down and eat. I can see it becoming a shit show in terms of seating when this place becomes busy. Our server was very nice and enthusiastic, explained the menu and the restaurant's ""mission"" to us. The owner and chef also introduced himself to us - you can tell the team is making an effort to make some personal connections with their customers. THE FOOD: we ordered the adobo burrito and a pancit bowl to share. I cook adobo all the time so I'm familiar with the taste and honestly, it just wasn't all quite there. It was good, but not great. I was expecting an explosion of flavor but was shorted. :( If the hot sauces didn't come on the side, the burrito would also be pretty dry (needs a sauce of some sort). The pancit was also different from what I'm used to but it wasn't bad. It included Chinese sausage which is always a sure way to my heart. Given they were only open a little over a week when I stopped by, I understand they have things to work out.

Prices are usually ridiculous for what you get, and there's always those nagging comparisons to mom's cooking. On the other hand, I love Mexican food so hard, so I wanted to give 2nd City a shot. With an open mind, I decided to come in with a friend during opening week. We decided to split the Adobo-Rito and Poke Me and each got the Calamansi Lemonade. 1) Adobo-Rito --- SO GOOD. This hit the spot, especially paired with the 2nd Base Salsa (basically suka). The kimchi fried rice worked perfectly with the vinegar/soy flavors of the chicken. The many burritos from my past have never made me feel this emotional. This is me in food form. 2) Poke Me --- Tuna was delicious, especially in the sauce it was tossed in. All the components worked really well together. Only complaint was that the coconut rice seemed a bit tough (this was opening week, so things might be different now). Other than that texture, this poke bowl worked for me. 3) Calamansi Lemonade --- I used to make this as a kid using calamansi from our tree in my parents' backyard. 2nd City's version tastes just like my childhood. I will order it every chance I get. All in all, 2nd City is a winner in my book. Flavors are there and prices are fair.

They've finally worked out their gas problems and are open for business. Nice space with a cool skater vibe. Not much seating inside so we opted for take-out. Either way you go up to the window to order. We ordered:Pancit Bowl- Thin rice noodles with shrimp and scallions and small pieces of sausage. Significantly more sauced than other pancit I've tried in the past and had a bit of a spicy kick.Poke Me- Raw sushi grade tuna w. carrots, fried wonton skins, pickled onions, rice and avocado. Pass the Bowl- One of the only vegan items on the menu, it consisted of mango, avocado, scallions, and tomato over calamansi dressed quinoa. Also available with a choice of protein on top. The kimchi fried rice looked great and (served with a fried egg on top ) as did the Ube ice cream.Be sure to try their homemade hot sauces. Perfect if you like the heat. Serious food porn here. More than a few customers appeared to spend more time posing with their food and taking selfies than eating. Makes it difficult to navigate the small space and frustrating if you're hoping to sit and eat. When they start serving alcohol I suspect getting a seat will become even more difficult.We need more places like this. 2nd City brings great food and much needed life to an area plagued retail vacancies.

Make sure you pair that with the #2 sauce (recommended by the chef).The chef/manager is a really nice guy, very enthusiastic about his business. Love the whole theme of the place and the names of the menu items. I died laughing when the guy next to me asked if he could get a ""pass the bowl"". Got some ube ice cream for the way out and really enjoyed it. It almost reminded me of macadamia nut ice cream I used to have back in Hawaii but with more of that ube texture, must have been the coconut.The prices are amazing for west village.

Unfortunately, the food was objectively fine but fell a little short of my expectations. The poke bowl would have been great, but was it just me or the coconut steamed rice just not cooked right? It had the consistency of not being fully cooked, which was highly disappointing. The pansit bowl was good but not mind-blowing either. Also, the ice cream does not deserve the accolades it's been getting left and right. Both the ube and macapuno flavors were barely perceptible, and the milkiness of the ice cream overshadowed the flavors. The best part of the Tap That Ube dessert was the pandan cake.Great and friendly servers though, that I appreciate.

412,vqHiV0TEBvVtBumF9CRgww,Caren K.,3.0 star rating,"Came here one weekend with 3 other friends. The place is tiny so larger parties are going to have a hard time finding seating. I literally raced a woman for a chair. I emerged victorious and was able to enjoy my plan b-rito sitting down. Only available on the weekends, the plan b-rito is filled with ham, bacon, longanisa, hash browns & cheese. A delicious combo of ingredients. Three of us had the plan b-rito and were happy, but the fourth member of our party who had the nice buns was underwhelmed with his food. He said they were decent, not the best pork buns he ever had and not the worst. Maybe all the hype and social media excitement set the bar a tad high for him.Although trying to order dessert was an annoying experience. We saw so many customers come in and order the ice cream sandwich, so I asked a staff member about it. I was told that it was a secret menu item that could only be ordered if you knew the name of it. He then informs me that someone either has to tell you (apparently ""someone"" wasn't going to be him)or I should try to find it on Google. As I try to explain that it is our first time and I just overheard someone order it, no secret name involved, he says he needs to serve another customer and takes off. Seriously? Thanks for the dismissive attitude. Another staffer offered to make it for us, but I didn't even want it anymore. I don't want to jump through hoops for something, especially since I am a paying customer. If the whole dessert fiasco hadn't happened, I would have been really happy with my meal. For the most part the staff was friendly and what I had was tasty. If I was rating on my food alone, it would be 4 stars, but I left the place pissed off so that is my last impression of the restaurant.",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"
413,elxBoXVCqrk2xX2r4aFW_A,Viviann L.,3.0 star rating,"Good food at reasonable prices, good service too and quite fast but so many people like their are barely any spots to sit inside and no sits on the outside to start with and with how many people there are it is just impossible. Luckily when I went with my boyfriend and his friends it wasn't raining and the weather was nice just a little windy, but if you are planning to eat outside and find yourself a bench you better hope for a good weather. Their burgers ran out fast though because it is very popular and they want you to come back next time so if you really want it or if you came all the way to eat it (like you live far or out of town) you gotta be there early and hope you didn't just miss the last one. Great food though and the meat aren't too dry or anything which is good, the quality of their food is fine as well so you can happily and safely enjoy your food. Unless for takeouts I don't suggest bringing kids especially in the evening because the kids might not want to eat standing up or have a hard time finding benches.

It's nice to have a casual filipino food place in the city that's cheap and tasty. And Big props for the ube macapuno ice cream!!!!! Sometimes you just want to eat some ube anything and not have to go to Williamsburg and pay a ridiculous amount of money for a hipsterized ube flavored thing... you guys know what I'm talking' about!!! C'mon, ube is the food of the people, it's delicious, fun and cheap. Don't try to make it stupid fancy and charge and arm and a leg for it. 2nd city is small, basically just a bar and a take out window on the side but it's cozy and comfy and the super friendly and helpful staff helps! you cannot beat unlimited calamansi juice. If you haven't tried it, it's the best lemonade you'll ever have! I can't wait for their liquor license and for them to create cocktails with the calamasi juice!!! The menu is short and sweet, no fuss and everything looks delicious. I got the adoborito...who doesn't want soft succulent chicken adobo with kimchee fried rice in wrapped in a tortilla!!!? It was sooooo good. The adobo was flavorful and they give you three sauces, the filipino vinegar, the spicier one and the other garlic one. I like the first two and goes well splashed in the burrito. Got the pandit bowl as well. Lots of shrimp, a saucy version of pancit with chinese sausage and veggies. Also really good. for dessert I got the ""Tap that Ube"" which was an ube Ice cream Sandwich. Ube macapuno (sweet coconut) with coconut cream between two slices of buko(coconut) pandan cake. Amazing.I already told all my friends to check these guys out and if you're a newbie to filipino food, don't worry their dishes are totally approachable. The food is good, the prices are cheap and service is excellent. Get there before the lines start going around the block this summer!Also they have 16(?) secret menu items that no one really knows about yet except for one...  I'm dying to find out the rest so I can try them all!",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

Both were delicious and refreshingly unique. The sauces provided also hit the spot. The right amount of acidity/heat. Can't wait for this place to serve some alcoholic bevs (a banana ketchup fueled michelada, fingers crossed?) , and can't wait to watch the menu evolve.

This place opened only about a month ago and I have a feeling the buzz is gonna spread real fast. Prices are extremely reasonable (not as high as you'd see if you ordered Filipino food on 1st ave, but not as cheap as if went to Jersey City or Queens) and the service guys were so friendly! We ordered the Plan B-rito, which is hands-down my new favorite burrito, and a secret menu item that you can only learn of through word of mouth. I saw someone post a photo of it on here, asked the server about it who said unfortunately they are only allowed to tell select regulars, but that those people usually spread the word. I ended up being given a riddle by a regular there who overheard our conversation and actually did know how I can order this ~secret~ item (thank you kind stranger!) and what we got was really good and definitely shareable amongst two! I was way too full to try to ube ice cream but I already knew I would be making multiple return trips in the future anyway. Keep in mind this is Filipino FUSION. Also seating is pretty limited but I've seen people ordering for takeout to eat right outside. PS. The music they were playing that day was old school 2000's hip hop.

Not going in details on the dishes since like previously stated authenticity is questionable but it is fresh and tasty. The place is new so needless to say very clean.

Meat smelled and looked good, so I was stoked to try it. The bowl was basically ALL rice, and the rice was super mushy. It was supposed to be garlic fried rice - nothing was garlic or fried about it.

The bartender / server was an eye candy with a bit too much chest hair exposure, but he was friendly and attentive. Bi-curious tacos were super spicy (which we were not aware of...) and 'nice buns' were very sweet.  I have to say kimchi rice was the most appetising flavour and the best of all the dishes we tried.  Green sandwich for the Ube ice cream is simple green food colouring, so don't expect it to be something like 'pistachio' flavour if you fantasised it so like I did by looking at yelp photos...

(not all at the same time)The Poke Me Bowl was a sufficient Poke bowl. The tuna and the vegetables were fresh and the meal was filling but the item pales in comparison to other choices on the menu, especially since this is the most expensive. The Hot Fili Chicks were great! The chicken was crispy and the tamarind slurry went well with it. The Pancit Bowl is great. Sometimes there is shrimp, sometimes longanisa (filipino sweet cured pork sausage), and sometimes Chinese hot dog just like mom used to make! It's a tie as to which I like the best: the Adobo-rito, or the Plan B-Rito. Plan B is certainly heavier: Eggs, longanisa, hash browns, cheese and avocado. But my heart is quite soft for anything that combines chicken adobo (chicken stewed in soy sauce, oyster sauce, vinegar and garlic) and kim chi fried rice! Both are simply wonderful and I would recommend taking a friend so you can have both since the burritos are conveniently served cut in half. Additional notes: the ube ice cream is the best I've had in the city. There are small pieces of coconut in it that give it a nice texture. It's nice and light, and not too sweet. if you're looking for sweet, tell your waiter/waitress that you want to ""Tap that ube,"" and they'll serve you a nice concoction of ube ice cream sandwiched between buko pandan cakes and topped with condensed milk. it's always a little too much for me, so I tend to go for just having the ube ice cream melt between the spaces left in my belly after consuming all the burritos. The Calamansi juice is great, and comes with alcohol if you want it to. I prefer it without. The place is super small, but there's a nice little bay window seating area that works well when I come with my 2 year old. The service is great! My husband has spoken to the owner once and he is very nice and friendly. The staff is also very nice, and seem pretty happy to be there.On top of the great service and delicious food is that the price points can't be beat! 7.95 for what is likely the best burrito in the city?

The burger was another sad story.

Besides that, everything is perfect. The food tastes super delicious. I ordered the nice buns and my friend ordered Adobo-rito. She told me it tasted better than Chipotle. The pork in the nice buns was super tender, juicy and creamy. I would definitely come back and try out other food in the menu.",Flip Sigi,4.5 star rating,$$,"Filipino,, Asian, Fusion,, Mexican"

Inexpensive but delicious and creative food served by the happiest and most personable staff who are clearly proud of their craft. The Poke Bowl was fresh & filling. The Bao buns are yuuuummmyyy and of the 3 sauces, the hot sauce (3rd base) was my fav. If you can snag the window bench seat do it, drink cocktails, order a few dishes, and linger.

I most especially enjoyed the ube macapuno ice cream. The ice cream was the most Filipino thing there. The calamansi lemonade was refreshing. The poke bowl was fresh and delicious. The pancit doesn't exactly taste like the usual pancit your grandmother makes, but then again its fusion so thats expected. Regardless, it was still good, but a little bit too salty for my taste. Overall, I'll definitely be returning to try the rest of the menu.

The man who answered the phone said that yes they have barracudas now. Excited, I went to 2nd City in hopes of trying barracuda for the first time. I arrived at 12:30PM. I ordered the bi-curious tacos which contain barracuda. The man said to me that they are out of barracudas. What the fuck? On the phone you just said that you have barracudas. The man said don't worry and they will stock on barracudas this afternoon. Fine. From 12:30PM I have been waiting and waiting. I waited till 5PM and still no barracudas. Seriously?
