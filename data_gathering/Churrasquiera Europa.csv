I can't say I would be back if I am craving portuguese or spanish food but if I was starving, I may just venture back in here.

2,qQylrtpwAMs8jrS7m-BOdg,Magy Y.,1.0 star rating,"ALERT ALERT DO NOT EAT HERE I REPEAT DO NOT EAT HEREI came here to eat with a friend yesterday 10/8/17 around 10pm. Took a minute or two to be acknowledged but eventually we were seated and given menus. We ordered two glasses of water and our waiter came back with a pitcher. I guess he couldn't be bothered with refilling but whatever. For our meals, we ordered the skirt steak for one and the mariscada in red sauce. After about 30 minutes, we received our food. It was A LOT. There was at least a pound of rice but hey the more the merrier I guess. Anyway, my friend and I eat as much as we could and we end up taking the leftovers home. So here I am 24 hours later heating up my leftovers about to eat some rice, shrimp, lobster, and whatever else was in the mariscada. As I'm eating, I notice the shrimp was falling apart a little so I peeled off whatever it was. Once peeling the shrimp, I was shocked when I saw this thick black line right in the middle of the back of the shrimp. I was like ""Oh my god, they don't devein the shrimp. THEY DON'T CLEAN THE SHRIMP. OH MY GOD. HOLY F***"" So obviously I freaked out. If you aren't aware, all shrimp have a vein in their backs but it isn't actually a vein, it's their digestive tract which basically means there's feces or poop in that tract. The darker it is, the dirtier and if you look at the photo I've included, you can see that this vein is practically black. So anyway, after I was done freaking out, I began to check all the shrimp for this vein (which wasn't much because I had already ate most of it) and of course, I found the vein in every single shrimp. I was absolutely disgusted and told my friend ASAP and luckily she hadn't eaten her leftovers yet. I wasn't so fortunate. I came here to write this review but before I did this, I swiped through other reviewers photos just to see if anyone else had shrimp that was also not cleaned and right away, i noticed that every picture with shrimp was not cleaned. you can tell because the back on the shrimp is not split and displaying that butterfly effect that clean shrimp have. go ahead and look through the pictures and you'll see what I'm talking about. The most shocking thing is how far back the pictures go where the shrimp are not cleaned. This tells me that this was not a mishap or a bad batch of shrimp but actually it's normal practice for them to serve dirty shrimp. Just appalling really. Whoever preps the food needs to be fired and retrained.OVERALL: terrible experience. It was my first time there and obviously my last time. Same goes for my friend. If you still choose to eat here, completely avoid the shrimp unless you like  sh*tty shrimp.",Churrasquiera Europa,3.5 star rating,$$,"Brazilian,, Portuguese,, Spanish,, Southern"

Two of the things I am not crazy about is one they have a juke box available for music purchase which means that if no one is feeding the machine to play there is no music and all you hear is loud noise from conversations at other tables. It can be very annoying. And second the service. Mediocre at best. The place is most of the time is always busy and they still only have two waiters doing the seating, orders, drinks, food, and clearing of the tables.

Locals love to catch the game here and have a couple of drinks. Although they do have about 7 tables and a private room you can reserve in the back. (there was a birthday party there last time I went) The food is definitely why this place keeps the locals coming back. The staff are nice and down to earth. Don't come here if you are in a rush. The service and food take a bit to cook. The food is Brazilian/Portuguese and tasty! It's your typical brazilian style steak, the steak on the stone is always tasty and you can cook it how you like on the stone.

I have been here quite a few times and my biggest gripe is the service is EXTREMELY slow. The servers are very friendly so it makes it a little more bearable but every step of the service was slow. From the time it took to even get our order placed to the time it took to get the servers attention for more drinks (we had to repeatedly ask) to waiting nearly 30 minutes to get out check after we were finished.

The flan was dark and more firm than I am accustomed to.   The cafe con leche was spot on !!The staff were very nice.  The ambiance and decor were drab and dreary.

So fortunately got a chance to try out this excellent choice for lunch :-) For lunch they have a pretty nice lunch buffet for under $10. This is basically a bar with tables where services are more on the minimal side. But for lunch its definitely not a big deal as I was by myself and didn't mind just sit at the bar stool. The food was pretty good although I didn't feel a lot of Brazilian food choices. Their best selection in my opinion was the Paella where the lobsters and clams were pretty fresh. Other selections felt more like an American buffet with chicken wings and ribs and fries and onion rings. Nothing too special but for the few good items I think it was worth the price.Definitely try their flan as well, really nice portions and delicious. I think most of the reviews are for their entrees, for lunch buffets its a 4 star for sure.

Wasn't bad but after a few more other shots and sangria I was definitely content with this place!",Churrasquiera Europa,3.5 star rating,$$,"Brazilian,, Portuguese,, Spanish,, Southern"

I am not a big fan of Mozarella sticks which became cold and tough.Rice and blackbeans are good fillers.There are more meat items... plenty for the hungry.The coffee chocolate gelatin cake was amazing with coffee bitters and caramelized top. There are also couple of fruit items for desserts in addition.Dont expect much from service perspective, they are nice however.

100,9OYQJ6eA_v9rMLh72QhVGg,Richard F.,5.0 star rating,"This review is only for the $10.00 lunch buffet. Discovered this place in 1999 when I got a job near by. I don't have a lot of time for lunch so the buffet is perfect and surprisingly good for the price! Wait, not just good,..delicious! It is always well stocked and refilled while the crowds pick away This buffet is the best lunch deal in Jersey City period!  In a city that is in the process of gentrification, cost of eating has gone up over the years, but Europa has kept the price of the buffet cheap! Good vibe inside, but very no frills decor.  The service is fine, but can be a bit aloof, however, for the buffet its never a problem. Street parking is very tough, but if you drive around, something usually opens up. Try this self serve, fresh, and convenient lunch feast and you will be coming back regularly like me! Come on, paella for lunch at these prices?!?! I think I'll go up for another plate!",Churrasquiera Europa,3.5 star rating,$$,"Brazilian,, Portuguese,, Spanish,, Southern"

I brought my family here for my dad's birthday this past April (overdue review) on a Saturday night and I was very disappointed considering the strong reviews on here. We were placed in the back for an extended dining table. The sangria was weak (must've drank 4 cups and completely sober afterward) and their paella was bland with stale-tasting seafood.

I glanced at my husband and he quickly said if theres any leftovers we will take them home, we would like 2 orders please lol. About 10 minutes later or entres came out, huge steak on a sizziling stone with 3 different sauces. Then the rice potatoes and veggies. We ate, ate, and ate some more. So good.

Next thing that we ordered was the T bone steak with lobster tails, it was so juicy and the lobster was cooked into perfection.  They offered bread that was served hot and we really like the greens...this is our 3rd time and will definitely come back soon!!!",Churrasquiera Europa,3.5 star rating,$$,"Brazilian,, Portuguese,, Spanish,, Southern"

I got Carne A La Piedra, a rare steak comes out on a piping hot stone and you cook it to your liking.  This was dope and the first time Ive seen it.  30 min go by and I can still cook that big ass steak on the stone.  Very good flavorful steak (huge) with niccce sauces on the side.  The table had the the clams in garlic sauce, gorgeous... Shrimp, plentiful.. and the stuffed shrimp which was not really the good, not sure what it was stuffed with Im sure they didnt mention bread.  Came with rice, black beans,  and sliced potatoes...  Everything was real good and I thought it was cheap but $122 for 4 ppl?  I duno how that happened didnt see the check but my steak was $17...  4*s easy, go here, can go wrong.  (saw a niccce seafood paella at the table next door btw)",Churrasquiera Europa,3.5 star rating,$$,"Brazilian,, Portuguese,, Spanish,, Southern"

113,DhZ8WqOd5OfwA-dNvfVK9A,Mega M.,4.0 star rating,"This place is right near where I work and during my obese days I used to frequent this place 2-3 times a week. ( I lost 108 pounds a couple of years ago) I go to this place once every 6 months but it is exactly the same as I remember it. This place can best be describes as gluttonous ecstasy. This is not for the weak of heart or stomach or for the calorie conscious. This will cause your belly to explode. Everything is sauced, fried, smothered and drenched in something you shouldn't have or at least have in moderation. However, it is amazingly good food at a reasonable price.Food: 4 and a half stars: They serve a hot lunch buffet that is very reasonably priced ($8.95 and it comes with soda and or coffee) with an amazing variety of items. Here are some of the highlights:* They serve traditional bar food such as chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, meatballs and calamari. The mozzarella sticks are really good. They come steaming hot and the cheese melts in your mouth. The calamari tastes a little bit too oily for my liking. The Chicken Fingers are well breaded and seasoned.  The meatballs are good but taste more like Swedish Meatballs than Italian. The marinara sauce is pretty good actually.* The hallmark of this place is its Brazilian Traditional Spanish food which is decadent and delicious. They serve Portuguese style chicken and ribs which taste rotisserie style. The ribs come with a well-seasoned crust that adds a lot of flavor. They also serve a lot of fresh seafood dishes like squid with vegetables which are quite good. * The Paella is as good as any in a Spanish Restaurant. Chock full of seafood and the rice is tender and flavorful.  * They offer a series of salads such as Pasta salad with Ham, Ambrosia salad, and a traditional salad bar with condiments* For desert you can get Flan, mixed fruit and sliced peaches in syrup which while good tastes canned.Besides the Buffet they have a whole series of lunch specials and a full menu. I have ordered a few things from here and was satisfied with my choices.  Ironically enough, I once ordered Chicken Parmesan here ( I have no idea why?) that was really good. They also have a full dinner menu. I have never ordered their dinner specials but it could turn this into 5 stars if they are equally good.Service: 3 Stars: The waitress will bring you bread upon request. Service can be a little slow for drinks.Atmosphere: 3 stars: Although this is a restaurant, there is a long bar that runs the length of the restaurant. It is definitely not upscale. It looks like a dive that needs fixing up. Conclusion: This is a great place to go for lunch and possibly dinner. The buffet will literally make you gain 10 pounds and you won't feel that guilty LOL. It's worth a visit.",Churrasquiera Europa,3.5 star rating,$$,"Brazilian,, Portuguese,, Spanish,, Southern"

117,OhXLzBjxPUai4loKY8OiMQ,Roslyn C.,4.0 star rating,"Big family portions. I definitely recommend their paella. Their paella marinera never disappoints. We've called in to order just that for take out on many occasions and its always been piping hot and they have never skimped on the seafood. Recently, I got to try something else on their menu.. the churrasco argentino (skirt steak) w/ shrimp, and their sirloin steak w/ shrimp & mushrooms. I enjoyed the skirt steak. I just wish it had a little bit more flavor. Maybe if it was marinated a little longer? I don't know.. or maybe sauce on the side? I would have probably enjoyed it with more chimichurri sauce. My bf got the sirloin steak with shrimp and mushrooms and it was a nice big, hearty portion. Really good, but the steak was smothered in too much of the mushroom sauce. Mushroom, sauce, and all were good, but it took away from the natural flavor of the steak. We came here on a sunday night, and service was a bit slow but the place was full. Originally, I wanted to order their sirloin steak on a hot plate but they didn't have it on their menu. Not sure if they took it out or they just have a different menu that they do for weekends.",Churrasquiera Europa,3.5 star rating,$$,"Brazilian,, Portuguese,, Spanish,, Southern"

The food is delicious, the portions are huge, and the waiters and bartenders are REALLY nice. Admittedly, much of the flavor in their food comes from salt and fat, and, yeah, they're probably not using any fancy ingredients, but I can't imagine anyone coming here and being disappointed. My favorite meal so far has been the Argentine skirt steak. I also love the paella. And the sangria. Some people have commented on the ambiance, or lack thereof. While I agree that it's not quiet or romantic, I really enjoy the casual and friendly atmosphere. I eat here with groups of friends all the time, but it could also be a fun date spot, if your date is cool.",Churrasquiera Europa,3.5 star rating,$$,"Brazilian,, Portuguese,, Spanish,, Southern"
