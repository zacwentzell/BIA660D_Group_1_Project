My go-to menu items are the Grandma Patti & Buffalo Chicken pizzas, Ole & Bad Leroy sandwiches, and any of the jumbo wings. I'm a regular and have tried most of the menu items, including Tony's Taco Tuesday Pizza. The lunch specials are great during the weekdays if you work or live in the neighborhood too. The owner, Mike, is very friendly and his staff is accommodating to everyone. This place is packed on weeknights and weekends!!",Tony Boloney’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Pizza,, Sandwiches"
1,ivP6tYBquiIsT334Be-E2w,Marg R.,3.0 star rating,"They definitely got the social media hype food going for them. It is what got me to travel to Jersey for some pizza.Taco Pizza: Great idea. I mean 2 of the greatest foods ever, but I was a bit disappointed when I tried it. The pizza itself was soggy from all the guacamole and sauces from the tacos.  Not really edible.  The tacos themselves were OK as well. Combined, it just didn't work for me. Maybe because I was sober I was disappointed. OK, it was definitely because I was sober. It was $8 for the slice. Ramen Pizza: So I came for ramen pizza. On the website and social media, they made it seem like they would have it everyday for a limited time. I was bummed to find out they weren't serving it that day. Like seriously. I went with one of their specialty slices. It was pretty good. It was around $8 for a slice and a drink.Overall, the normal pizza was good, but not worth the trek for and a bit pricey.  I'm glad I got to try their taco pizza, but I probably will never go back.",Tony Boloney’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Pizza,, Sandwiches"
2,OLwqP0VuZ8aF5dS9N1AqRA,Brendalynne F.,3.0 star rating,"I was here last weekend to grab a slice of the super Facebook-popular pizza bagel - only available in the Hoboken location on Fridays. Here's the website description of it: ""Massive pizza bagel pizza. Everything bagel, vodka sauce, smoked pepperoni, fresh mozzarella. Vegetarian available too."" Sounds pretty delicious!However, I was a bit underwhelmed. Maybe the pizza was out for too long, but the bagel base of my slice tasted stale which is a shame because the bagel base is reason for all the hype and uniqueness. The toppings, however, were very flavorful. If those exact toppings were on a regular dough (not a bagel) base, I think it'd taste fantastic.The slice was $8, but it's very thick! I could barely fit it into my mouth lol. So for what it's worth, the portion justifies the price. I probably won't come back for the pizza bagel, but I'll definitely be back one day for the Truffle motz sticks and the taco pizza!",Tony Boloney’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Pizza,, Sandwiches"
3,4kdSh2lkelfHpXOQAPF4rQ,Michelle C.,2.0 star rating,"Taco pizza video is all over the internet and I've been wanting to try it for some time. For my husband's birthday, I pre-ordered taco pizza on Wednesday for Friday 7:30 delivery. Boy, it was a mistake... so what went wrong?1. The order arrived 50 mins late. I called them at 7:50 and the girl said the delivery person should arrive any minute. I called back at 8:05 and 8:10 and both times, no one picked up and I was on hold for 5 mins both times! The order finally came at 8:20.2. Taco pizza came in a regular pizza box so the tacos were all squashed. 3. The pizza came cold so the tacos were soggy.... Overall I am so extremely disappointed. Why allow your customers to pre-order food if you cannot meet the delivery time? All can be forgiven if the food is good. The taco pizza was boxed in the short regular pizza box which caused the tacos to be squished AND the taco pizza sat out for too long causing it to be soggy!Side note: We also two large order of fries. Their fries are really good but don't order for delivery. They were so soggy that no one touched them.",Tony Boloney’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Pizza,, Sandwiches"

We love their truffle mutz in particular but they have a rotating selection of flavors that are all great in their own way. Definitely check out their station if you can make it to the Hoboken Mutz Fest (yes, that is a real thing).Tony Boloney's pizza is also great, but my recommendation is to have the slices in-house and eat them while they are hot and fresh. Every good slice I've had of this pizza has been right out of the oven or from a freshly delivered pie. Every mediocre slice has been one that I've either ordered a-la-carte for delivery (room temp for whatever reason) or from the Hoboken Pizza Festival (room temp as well) (yes, another real festival). My very favorite pie is the moonshiner, which is a vodka sauce pie with smoked mozzarella, asiago, and basil - seriously fantastic. I highly recommend ordering this pie in if you're having some friends over and what to try something other than a classic cheese pie. Sometimes you just want a good cheese slice, and this one is truly just a cut above the rest.",Tony Boloney’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Pizza,, Sandwiches"

I stopped by last Tuesday with a few friends to take on the popular pie and was so happy I did. I was convinced that I could easily finish my 1/4 of the pie, but beware, this meal is no easy feat. Some things to remember when you make your way down to Tony Boloney's 1. The taco pizza is only available on Tuesday. 2. They do offer just slices, but if you opt for a whole pie it is a bit pricey, $80.3. The restaurant is small and seating is limited. It looked like the majority of business was take out. 4. They have a huge menu with everything from specialty pizzas, sandwiches and salads. 5. If you're not from Hoboken, and driving in, parking in this area is tough. 6. I found the best method to be eating the tacos first and then the pizza. Trying to do it all at once can get very messy. 7. Enjoy!

10,gX3GV7sYm3QlPasge-bBbA,Caitlyn G.,3.0 star rating,"Tony Boloney's is in the busy city of Hoboken. The parking is street parking but you have to pay. The place is pretty small with indoor and outdoor seating. The place had some seats available, but it was still busy. I've been here twice. The first time, the pizza slice I got was pretty good. I don't remember exactly what flavor though so I came back today to try out this place again. Today I ordered the ""Bangkok boardwalk"" slice. It has spicy thai sauce, hand battered fried chicken, fresh jalapenos, cilantro, crushed honey roasted peanuts & black toasted sesame seeds. It tasted good for the first few bites, but then it tasted alright. The pizza is pretty oily and the crust was hard to chew on. I came here close to 2PM and there wasn't that many good slices of pizza to choose from. They didn't even have a regular slice. I'm sure the fresh pizza is great and looks amazing. However, the slices that are sitting out all day are alright. The prices here are also a little more expensive than usual.

16,GELES1sNWibMEdOVLrBPmA,Andrew S.,4.0 star rating,"A place known for Taco-Pizza, Waffle-Pizza, colorful rainbow mozzarella sticks, and of course regular slices. I recently had the chance to try their Beef-Patty-Pizza. It's like a pizza sandwich. The bottom pie looks like an average pizza crust, while the top looks like a different type of dough is used. It looks like a regular pie topped with a centimeter or so of meat with melted cheese or a cheese-sauce and the top part of the pie made with a -different type of dough- is slapped on top of the meat and patted down. I'm not sure how they made it. But it binds well all together to get a lightly thick slice.How does it taste?Though, not great, pretty good!Though, nothing like a Jamaican Beef Patty, having a crunchy shell (which appeared in my head when I heard the name), I say it's more like a beef pizza sandwich or a cheese burger in pizza form. Nothing crisp, nothing crunchy, not much bread-like dough. It's pizza dough, pizza crusted.The meat is not highly flavorful or spicy. I can taste a light flavor spice to it, though. If not liking it for any wow or great flavor/taste aspect. I like the concept, I like the taste, I like how semi-thick and filling of the pizza.I think it deserves more than three stars but not sure it deserves a four star either.

I have just had the WORST customer service experience of my life at the hand of this unprofessional establishment! I will NEVER eat here again and I will be sure to tell everyone I know not to either!I ordered food at 6:30pm and it did not arrive until close to 8pm.I ordered garlic cheese bread-which arrived soaked in grease and burned to an inedible state and they forget to bring me the dipping sauce that came with it, matzo ball soup-which arrived with dirty carrots that still had the skin on them, and french fries--which were soggy, greasy, and cold.I called to kindly request my money back and the manager, Eddy I believe-told me he would send a delivery person to pick up the food I requested my money back for. REALLY???? As if this was not strange enough, I am sick (I told Eddie this). The manager said they would come pick the food up and THEN issue me a refund. I just looked at the refund and they were CHEAP and did not refund the soup because I picked the dirty carrots and meat out and sent the unwanted items back to them as they requested.I fell asleep waiting for delivery person to come back and pick the unwanted food up-remember, I am sick-I mean I was in urgent care today and left work early. OH, but none of this matters to the insensitive people at Tony Boloney's-they make their sick customers walk burned, greasy, disgusting food bak out to delivery people...The second delivery person WOKE ME UP after 10pm calling to get the food back. Let's recap: -Ordered food at 6:30pm-It arrives close to 8pm-I call the restaurant to kindly request a refund at 7:42pm-The second delivery man calls and wakes up a sick sleeping woman to collect the unwanted food at 10pm-Tony Boloney's restaurant only refunded me for the bread and fries.SO, I called back and spoke to an associate named Aidy (spelling) who informed me the manager ""stepped out""-how convenient :-/ Supposedly I will receive a call back from Eddy but I doubt it... I can't believe I had to go through all of this to try to get my money back. Furthermore, I cannot believe I did not receive a full refund! Give me back ALL of my money! NEVER EAT HERE!!

Nothing crisp, nothing crunchy, not much bread-like dough. It's pizza dough, pizza crusted.The meat is not highly flavorful or spicy. I can taste a light flavor spice to it, though. If not liking it for any wow or great flavor/taste aspect. I like the concept, I like the taste, I like how semi-thick and filling of the pizza.I think it deserves more than three stars but not sure it deserves a four star either. But since it surpasses the 3.5 average side, a 4 star it gets.",Tony Boloney’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Pizza,, Sandwiches"

I have just had the WORST customer service experience of my life at the hand of this unprofessional establishment! I will NEVER eat here again and I will be sure to tell everyone I know not to either!I ordered food at 6:30pm and it did not arrive until close to 8pm.I ordered garlic cheese bread-which arrived soaked in grease and burned to an inedible state and they forget to bring me the dipping sauce that came with it, matzo ball soup-which arrived with dirty carrots that still had the skin on them, and french fries--which were soggy, greasy, and cold.I called to kindly request my money back and the manager, Eddy I believe-told me he would send a delivery person to pick up the food I requested my money back for. REALLY???? As if this was not strange enough, I am sick (I told Eddie this). The manager said they would come pick the food up and THEN issue me a refund. I just looked at the refund and they were CHEAP and did not refund the soup because I picked the dirty carrots and meat out and sent the unwanted items back to them as they requested.I fell asleep waiting for delivery person to come back and pick the unwanted food up-remember, I am sick-I mean I was in urgent care today and left work early. OH, but none of this matters to the insensitive people at Tony Boloney's-they make their sick customers walk burned, greasy, disgusting food bak out to delivery people...The second delivery person WOKE ME UP after 10pm calling to get the food back. Let's recap: -Ordered food at 6:30pm-It arrives close to 8pm-I call the restaurant to kindly request a refund at 7:42pm-The second delivery man calls and wakes up a sick sleeping woman to collect the unwanted food at 10pm-Tony Boloney's restaurant only refunded me for the bread and fries.SO, I called back and spoke to an associate named Aidy (spelling) who informed me the manager ""stepped out""-how convenient :-/ Supposedly I will receive a call back from Eddy but I doubt it... I can't believe I had to go through all of this to try to get my money back. Furthermore, I cannot believe I did not receive a full refund! Give me back ALL of my money! NEVER EAT HERE!!

Every Tuesday they have a Taco-Pizza or Pizza-Taco, and you can pre-order a pie or just get it by the slice. Prices are pretty steep, an entire Taco Taco Taco Pizza (yes, that's the name!) will cost you $80. Resturant also is known for subs, salads and mutz sticks. The mutz sticks are crusted with Pennsylvania Dutch pretzels and delicious! My personal favorite is the Boken Girl Salad which has baby arugula, Sicilian soppressata, homemade sweet smoked mutz, chopped tomato & hand breaded chicken cutlet w/ a lemon vinaigrette dressing. It makes my mouth water thinking about it! Open late which is a huge plus. Gets pretty crowded after bars close but definitely worth the wait.

I was impressed with the amount of different pies that they had to offer. I was beyond indecisive after seeing so many different specialty pies so I had asked the girl behind the counter which one she would recommend and she told me this s*** faced was her favorite.  Me not being totally sold on it I asked a customer which one she recommended and the s*** faced was her second favorite so I went ahead and ordered the s*** faced slice. In all honesty I wasn't impressed. It was good but nothing to write home about. Tasted like an average slice of bbq chicken pizza.  Maybe my expectations were too high. I have to guess that maybe part of the problem was the fact that I ordered my slice at 2:30 so I don't know when that pie was actually made and it was slightly warmed up.. it may have been better if it was warmed fully. The staff was very nice and I will say I think the place is a cute little place. I have a feeling though they're going to eventually move into a bigger spot because the place is so well-known. Although my first visit left me unimpressed at some point I will return because I have to try that taco pie!!!,Tony Boloney’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Pizza,, Sandwiches"

Then you get your food and your mouth continuously waters?!  Yeah... well... expect that this place will not achieve that, and WILL disappoint and leave you feeling angry and dissatisfied.Let me just start off by saying - I never complain about food especially to people who work there because 1.) that's a first world problem & many people are starving around the world and 2.) subpar food is still edible. But this tonight's experience at Tony Boloney's really set an all time low.This place is overhyped, disgusting, and NOT worth your money. Even if I was drunk with no sensitivity to taste, I would be better off ordering a slice of pizza from a generic pizza place.Ok first - my friends and I wanted to try this place because of the colored mozzarella sticks. We didn't end up getting it because it's just mozz cheese with a sh*t ton of food coloring. For $20, you can make it at home (TRUST ME). So collectively we ordered 2 small pizzas (Moonshiner and 1900s), fries, cobb salad, Ganja wings, Gravytrain steak sandwich, and Carney Balls. Carney Balls came out first. Stale/chewy, hard, cold. Didn't mind it at first because I have all my REAL teeth and it was doused in hazelnut chocolate sauce. But the more I ate it, the more I realized they were most likely cooked earlier this morning or maybe the day before and just carelessly thrown in a puddle of sauce. These would've been tasty if they were fresh from the fryer.Cobb salad was ok. Good. It's hard to mess up cold salad.Gravytrain sandwich... The meat was cold and the bread was stale. The mozzarella was still hard and not melted at all. The girl at the front said that it's fresh mozzarella and that it's supposed to be like that. Wait, what? If a customer is ordering a hot sandwich, why is the meat cold and why is the cheese not melted? This means that the cooked meat was refrigerated, barely re-heated, and served because nothing that touches a stove/grill top will be cold. Needless to say, my friend threw out the entire sandwich.Ganja wings come out.... COLD TO THE TOUCH.... not an exaggeration!!! Ridiculous!!!! You are meaning to tell me that there was COLD cooked wings back in your kitchen and you just tossed sauce on it and served it to a customer????!? We took it back up to the front, and yet again the girl said ""it's just cold bc of the sauce""..... You're joking right? How does the sauce make an ENTIRE chicken wing cold? They took it back and most likely reheated it in a MICROWAVE or some sort of microwave oven. We got the wings back. Opened up 4 out of the 5 wings and there was blood still bright pink in the inside close to the bone. Yet again, we bring it back up. A guy this time in the back said ""No it's just a little blood. No big deal, you'll be fine"" ......WHAT???!?!?!!?!? You not only serve COLD chicken wings, your food is PREMADE and you just reheat your stale food in a MICROWAVE?!?!?? Then try to justify it?The fries were meh. Ok, but had better. Nothing amazing.Finally, we got our 2 pizzas. The 1900s was so GREASY GREASY GREASY!!!!! SOOOOO OILY!!!!!! Tasty, but OILY!!! They topped it with cubed mozzarella. Which I agree with a review below, tasted like playdoh. Should be a little melted if you popped it in an oven right? Yeah.. no. The Moonshiner was nothing short of way below subpar.You are better off saving your money and buying a slice of pizza across the Hudson in NYC.

My boyfriend and I usually get one whole pizza and two orders of wings (smallest is 5 wings). The slices are huge and so filling. I've had a few other items on the menu that are pretty good too. I once ordered the TRUFFLE MOZZARELLA sticks (but they gave me the original on accident). Pretty good, but nothing crazy. My boyfriend's gotten a few of their subs and they're delicious as well.

74,U_UvZKuqTV35_R_QaUsVPA,Christina G.,3.0 star rating,"i've stopped in here and ate slices, and i've also done pick up. the place always seems to be busy with a steady flow of customers. they have a ton of fatty food on the menu, prices are at a premium. one time i had a special slice, it was essentially like a garlic bread cheesesteak. it was tasty, but very greasy and definitely upset my stomach later. i also tried the mexican mozzarella sticks. they go for around $12 an order. the cheese sticks are huge! and i really liked the spicy ranch dipping sauce they came with. wasnt sold on the seasoned breading they were deep fried with though... think i prefer the classic style, which unfortunately tony's doesn't have. they do have a pretzel mozzarella stick option that sounded intriguing. for take out we ordered wings and i believe a taqueno salad. the wings were pretty delicious, but a bit expensive. very saucy. the salad was a large portion and the dressing it came with was really spicy! it was supposed to have cotija cheese in it, but it tasted more like mozzarella. will definitely come back here to get more wings and try more of the pizzas!",Tony Boloney’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Pizza,, Sandwiches"

I'm so used to $1 slices or dominoes, that I forgot what good pizza tastes like. We ordered two pies for a work lunch and they were so delicious. One is called the 1900's and it's a white pie with different cheeses on top including ricotta, mozzarella, smoked mozzarella, muenster and more! There was also a basil like sauce on it that was too die for. It was so fresh and delicious and the herb sauce tasted amazing. One of the best white pies I've ever had! The second pizza was Mother Italy Proud. This pizza has ravioli on it!!! It is seriously carbs on carbs on carbs. I'm usually not a big fan of pasta on top of pizza but the ravioli was so good. It's made with a homemade spicy vodka sauce that gives it a nice kick. There basil adds a touch of freshness to it. So good but I could not eat another slice, I have to draw the line somewhere carbwise. Definitely coming back  to try more of their pizzas.

The sauce on the Margherita tastes so fresh and original. Perfect amount of flavor for sure. It's not too sweet and very savory. I swear I was humming with each bite. The pizza could have used a bit more mozzarella cheese but not really because the crumbles of Parmesan on top just really made it perfect !!! That pizza was so TASTY. The bottom was a bit charred but the toppings were just over powering it. The plain slice was good too. A big pizza but somehow two can still be eaten in one sitting.

It looked as though all 3 things were just thrown together without thought to flavor. It was very disappointing as I really wanted to like it!

The reason why we came here is cause we heard of the pizza Taco that everyone is raging about and we really wanted to see what the hype was really all about. As soon as we got there we asked if we can order the pizza taco and they said that they only served it on Tuesdays which was a huge bummer. Hence ""taco Tuesday"" and we were really disappointed cause we walked all that way for nothing. Since we were already there we still decided to order pizza cause why not? I wasn't sure what I wanted cause there were so many things on the menu to pick from so I ended up getting a Buffalo chicken pizza. The pizza was alright but it wasn't amazing and the only thing that bothered me a little bit about it was that it had chunks of actual blue cheese in it and the texture of that with the pizza itself kinda threw me off.

My order consisted or 2 sandwiches and some mozz sticks, which was placed around 6:20, We took a seat and waited while people came in and got their food and left. At 6:50 she finally asked what my husband and I ordered, only after another customer said she had given them the wrong thing. We told her if the order wasn't ready yet to just cancel it and refund us because we had to leave. She then suddenly decided to check a bag that had been sitting on top of the oven for some time, saw that it was ours, didn't say anything, but instead took the bag to the back, pulled the receipt off and brought it back. My husband asked her if it had been sitting there the whole time and she responded with ""no it hasn't"" after we watched her take it down, then followed it up with an incredibly attitude filled""it's still warm.""

Their fountain machine was broken also, so we opted for bottle soda (creme soda was pretty good).Again, the food is not convincing. Not sure what it is, but nothing stands and it leaves you feeling full but not satisfied. I had the steak olé, which I ate half of, it was alright. I removed the lettuce and tomatoes, the sauce used was a little weird to me but the sandwich had a kick which helped to a small degree. The fries were good. Fresh.I was told the 500 club rang the same ""just OK"" bell, although there was a complaint of the inside of the sandwich being too big for the roll overall causing everything to fall out when you try to eat it (i assume this annoys a lot of people).Coming back to Tony's would literally have to be a last resort for me.

125,ceqimtWuS2-pSclnigGxog,Tim R.,1.0 star rating,"As a regular customer of Tony Bologney's, I was disappointed after  recently purchased one of my favorite pies, The Grandma Patti. I've ordered the pie several times and always end up snapping a picture because the pies are always that beautiful. When I ordered the other day however, I was very disappointed to open the box to discover something unrecognizable to what I've gotten in the past. The pizza, which was supposed to include ricotta & fresh mozzarella cheese, had neither and some of the ingredients that were on the pie, looked anything but fresh. I immediately called the store once I received the disappointing pie and voiced my complaint but was told that the manager was not in but would be in contact with me. It has now been two full days and have yet to hear anything back from management and was never given an option of receiving a replacement for my $32 pie. I feel that the store has become more concerned about going viral with instagramable pizza like their taco pie than their regular customers satisfaction.UPDATE:After writing my review, I was contacted by the business owner, Michael. I really appreciated him personally reaching out and offering a gift card which he said he'd send right away...Except it's now been over a month and no sign of a gift card. Not even a response when I messaged him back over a week ago. He said that he ""really values his customers and personally wants to make sure they're taken care of.""

Shanghai Shuffle pizza !  -spicy, sweet & sour asian fried chicken with sesame seeds & scallions. I wish it wasn't so thin and 1 was definitely not enough. A small '12 inch pie is $15 and I think an extra large pie '18 costs about $25. It's small inside, only 3 wooden tables, so I'm sure most people are doing delivery/pick up or coming by drunk (open until 4 am -Fri/Sat) to get their famous cheesesteaks ole.They do deliver to JC* ($5 fee). I keep hearing awful things about their delivery estimates so I'm not taking my chances yet. I rather go pick it up myself ...

Oh yeah I know why, because they don't go Jersey City after 4 PM :/ The menu is extensive and at times exotic, which is unique for a pizza restaurant. I've had the Uncle Pennybags sub ($10.50) which I thought was okay, but less flavorful than I was expecting it to be considering the ingredients (mushrooms with ricotta, pesto, broccoli rabe, red peppers, mozzarella) and the Nero Salad ($12) which was really good. What I really like about Tony Boloney's is how vegetarian friendly their menu is; many of the subs list a meat protein and also a vegetarian option. As a vegetarian I really appreciate this, and like that I can order most things off the menu.  That and a fanatic salad menu has me wishing they had opened in JC instead of Hoboken.",Tony Boloney’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Pizza,, Sandwiches"

The cold cuts were real ""porky"" which some may enjoy but combined with the onion and the sweet sauce made my stomach turn.  Sweet, raw oniony meat.  Blech!!!Why the 3 stars?  Because we also ordered a sausage small pizza and that was pretty good and the delivery was relatively quick.  One more try, tony boloney!",Tony Boloney’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Pizza,, Sandwiches"

The food came hot and it tasted delicious! The only thing that was off was that they delivered the pizzas, garlic knots, and salad with plates and napkins but we never got plastic utensils. Overall the food tasted amazing and they were so easy to deal with and the pricing was great.

Now, it's new and they need to work out some kinks still so maybe I'll give it some time. Placed an order for delivery and it took over and hour and a half for one buffalo chicken pizza which needed to be microwaved when it arrived. It was good but not the time of wait good. When we called we got the old ""on the way"" routine. And if you're going to charge me a $2.14 delivery fee, I kinda expect the pizza to be warm at least.This last time I placed an order for pick up and it took a good 45 minutes, the fries we ordered were out about 25 minutes before the pizza so they were nice and soggy. We got the Ole pizza, which was delicious but man was it greasy, it was literally dripping off. We got the fries with old bay and mutz, they were ok but also trenched in grease and like I said soggy by the time the whole order was complete. While waiting forever for this order I saw a ton of people come and go while I waited. I even heard, what I think was a manager, tall guy with a short beard, say ""nah he didn't get a pizza"" the cashier said ""yeah he has an ole"" at that time about 20 minutes into my wait is when I think my pizza got thrown in to be made on the fly. I kept getting ""it's coming up soon."" Dude, just tell me you didn't throw the pizza in and I'll appreciate your honesty. There were also 2 younger employees obviously not on the clock yet, but they were acting like a couple high schoolers making out and goofing off and taking up a whole table while not eating. They acted like they owned the place, I got the feeling that the girl  may have known the owners or be related to them. They were flat out just obnoxious. You could tell that customers were uncomfortable watching  them use the small dining area as their living room.Food, pretty good albeit greasy.

My roommate and I order this thing usually at least once a week. This pizza has breaded fried chicken, queso fresca, black beans, mozz, cilantro, and probably some other toppings that I'm forgetting, but DAMN what a good pizza. The savory of the queso and chicken is so well complimented by the cilantro, and the black beans just adds such a nice dynamic to the flavor. They really hit it out of the park with this one. I'm also a big fan of their sicilian style square pie. It reminds me of the pizza my right-off-the-boat grandmother made for me when I was small.The bad.This place has some wacky combinations for grinders, fries, and strombolis. Some of them are pretty tasty, but many of them are way off base. We tried a couple of the 'late night' strombolis that had things like mac and cheese or chips in them, and they were straight up gross. As far as the grinders are concerned - my problem with these is that they are inconsistent. I've had their chicken and meatball parm sandwiches when they have been great, and when they have been terrible. Sometimes they'll arrive as a gross soggy mess. Same thing with the fries.Overall, this place does pizza very very well. It's a little on the pricey side, but I'm willing to pay for what they're offering without it being being a problem. I'm not going to stop trying their weird combinations of sandwiches and other items because, while some are absolutely gross and should be removed from the menu, others just knock it out of the park. This place would be 5 stars, if it werent for lack of consistency, and some gross menu items.",Tony Boloney’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Pizza,, Sandwiches"

On the upside, some of their gourmet sandwiches really hit the spot late night (open till 4am Friday & Saturday). My favorites are the 500 Club and Ducktown Melt. Don't try and give too many special instructions to your order because odds are they won't get it right. By far the biggest disappointment was when I recently ordered the Gluten-Free Grandpa Charlie with Sausage. My boyfriend (gf diner in this scenario) had envisioned this big square pie that we could both share and still have a ton left over given the whopping $25 price tag. But to no avail, it was a small 12"" or so round pie with minimal toppings. The cherry on top: we waited over an hour and the pizza was ice cold.

Secondly, the sandwich is ALL NOODLES, flavorless at that, with tiny amounts of chicken and scallion. No spicy thai sauce, no sesame seed, no cilantro, and no peanuts.

I had a menu from Tony Boloney's and loved the creativity of their menu, so my family decided to give it a try.While we heard good things from friends and the reviews on here in regards to their speciality pizza, we decided to go with a somewhat normal pizza with a few toppings because of my brother being picky.The excitement I had to try this pizza was immediately met with disappointment when I opened the box. While it didn't look too appealing (toppings scattered throughout with some slices having too many and others having none) I remained hopeful. And then I tried pick up the slice after cutting it, the dough seemed somewhat undercooked for one which probably was the main cause in the pizza literally folding instantly knocking all the toppings and cheese off the slice.The dough like I said was undercooked, the sauce was strong and very overwhelming. The taste just was not good, and it was hard to even get a bite with all the elements together as the pizza would fall apart. I had never been more disappointed in a pizza, so much now that I actually could say there is such thing as a bad pizza in this world, which I did not think was possible.I also do not recommend ordering cheese fries, they come very soggy and had a sort of taste that seems to come from the use of old oil.

Decided to order another day with coworkers and we were shocked to see a delivery fee of $5, from Hoboken to jersey city. A little steep but we still decided. 1 hour after ordering, I received a phone call from the delivery guy saying he has my order but is delivering in Hoboken first and then will come to Jersey city. He said the restaurant gave him my order thinking it was in Hoboken. We ordered 2 sandwiches, 1 wrap , a slice of pizza, and a salad and so I didn't want the sandwiches and wrap getting cold. I called the restaurant to speak with the owner who was rude and immediately said I put Hoboken as my address. I immediately pulled up my seamless email and verified i put the correct address. He then said he'll talk to the delivery guy who then later called me back and said he'll deliver my order first now. Ok great! 25 minutes go by and still no food. I called the manager again saying that we pay a delivery fee and expect food in a timely manner and warm. Finally the food came an hour and a half later, however the food was cold and there was no slice of pizza. I immediately called the restaurant and spoke to the same manager who gave me a huge attitude and said ""what do you want me to do?????"" He refunded us half the cost of the order but I expected more. They forgot an item off my order, was late in delivering, blamed me for the address (when it clearly said jersey city), and the food was cold. I didn't tip the delivery guy (charging $5 for delivery fee and then being late, I don't think he deserved a tip). So of course he gave me an attitude.

Burnt food is probably my biggest pet peeve food-wise.I know the fries are good here but they packed them in an airtight container, which traps them moisture and makes them horrible and soggy by the time they get to you!! I've seen soooo many places succumb to this and it is such a goddamn shame. It's simple: trap moisture, ruin fries. I don't know why so many places fall victim to this. I truly thought TB's would know better, given that they are a multi-location buisness. Also, they forgot the aioli. R u KidDInG me. That's practically why I ordered the stuff.These aren't necessarily the worst mistakes imaginable, I know. But you also have to account the price. This place is, already in an expensive town, pretty steep unfortunately. Had it been cheaper with these mistakes, I probably wouldn't have too much issue, likewise if the mistakes hadn't been made. But both of these things together ultimately bring me to a 2 star rating.I really want to love you Tony, but it seems like this is a one way relationship.",Tony Boloney’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Pizza,, Sandwiches"

LOVE their thin crust that hosts a seemingly infinite variety of toppings & new offerings, like cheesesteak pizza. Most of these can be Subs too. Ours was the freshly crushed Margherita with jalapeños & the Ole Sub, which provided an endless stream of smooth and thorough flavor but without being punched in the mouth. We also had the Pancho Franco (chicken with avocado, queso oaxaca, jalapeño crema WITH POTATO CHIPS!)  They also have a bounteous melange of fresh salads, subs, pies, slices, fries, soups, wings, mozzarellas, sweets and seasonal ingredients. Phew! I USUALLY run for the hills when a menu is THIS busy but TB's is THE EXCEPTION to the rule!

I was craving good vodka deliciousness!  The wings were really bad, I'm an upstate NY (near buffalo) native, so I have high wing standards, but no. I'm fairly sure they sauced them and thew them back in the fryer so the sauce was just oddly caked/burnt on. I really don't know how to describe it but we really couldn't even eat them (and my husband will eat almost anything). Also, now I'm getting picky, but the blue cheese does not resemble blue cheese sauce, at all, I could hardly tell if it was just a gross ranch or what.Idk what happened, sometimes it's great other times it's a big miss.

I've also had their pepperoni pizza and a few of their wing varieties - all of which are pretty tasty and portion sizes are pretty generous. Pricing is pretty much on par with most establishments in the area. I think they've raised it a bit since opening.That said, the menu here is a little overwhelming: pizzas, fries, sandwiches, etc. I tend to stick to what I know and like.

Besides the slow delivery, we've frequently had pizza sizes upgraded for no extra charge, and the food usually arrives warm anyway. Their mozzarella sticks are the best I've ever had (seriously) and we love the different flavors of pizza. When it comes to their more traditional pizzas, I've had better for sure, but some of the more out-there flavors are worth it -- for instance, the Pancho Franco, which tastes great when you order and somehow amazing the next day, and the Iron Mon, General Khan and Ducktown. I'm 100% not a taco pizza fan and it just seems gimmicky to me but I definitely recommend their other flavors. Pizza definitely wins here.

I recommend ordering the Oriental Ave - chicken cutlet, arugula, soppressata, smoked mutz, lemon and EVOO. Delicious melding of flavor. I really love the crust on all of their pies, too.

I've tried several different kinds - the buffalo chicken, barbecue chicken, panko Franco, and more. And they're all great - super rich in flavor and very tasty. The one caveat is that it upsets my stomach every time I eat food from here. It's just mild pain, and don't think it's from bad ingredients, as most of my friends haven't experienced this (just one other friend). I think it could be how heavy their pizzas are, or how oily. All the other pizza ice eaten has never had this effect on me, but every time, this happens to me at Tony Boloney's. This place would totally get my fourth star if it weren't for this little problem. I've begun opting to go to other pizza places in town because of this, but if it's in front of me (aka my friends or roommates brought some home), I can't help but eat Tony Boloney's pizza in all of its delicious, rich, heavy, sickening glory.Service: C+They're friendly, no real complaints, but not incredibly great at making recommendations or being super quick.

Having recently moved from Philly, I was a bit nervous about the cheesesteak.  The meat was actually pretty close to legit, though dry in some areas which seems incomprehensible for a cheesesteak. The cilantro in the chimichurri added brightness to the buttery mozz and salty steak. The bread somehow didn't seem to stand up to the sandwich, making it a huge mess. As for the pizza, I'm just not that into pizza, but it was also good. Enough heat, tasty crust. Could have been cooked a smidge longer, but that's splitting hairs.Take 2: chicken sandwich with roasted peppers fresh mozz and pesto and same pizza. The sandwich was extremely messy again but great until... Gristle. Ugh. Then gristle in another bite. Total turn off; I tapped out. The pizza was delivered with the blue cheese, which my man won't eat. So we called and waited an hour until they delivered a fresh one. The crust was crispier than the first foray, and really tasty.

It might yet just be the best pizza in Hoboken.Previously my two favorites were Napoli's and Grimaldi's. Both are brick oven pizza, and my ""go-to"" pizza places. If you are a fan of Benny Tudino's Pizzeria, I would suggest you do not eat here. Its like someone who likes White Castle trying to critique Shake Shack or Bareburger.Pizza, in a classic form is just dough, sauce and cheese. Tony takes it to the next level by creating some cosmic creations that I never saw before - with toppings that sound crazy on paper, but taste great in your mouth. I personally love the Hawaiian Pizza, with ham, bacon and pineapple. Also I got to try their sandwiches - the Ming's Parm is their spin on a chicken parm sandwich, but with ricotta & pecorino cheese in there with the mutz, along with fresh basil - make this your first order and thank me later. I love my cheesesteaks and tried ""Rolling Za"", which is their spin on a Pizza Cheesesteak with steak, marinara, mutz, pepperoni, lettuce and tomato with garlic mayo. Lettuce and tomato on a cheesesteak? Sounds like hersey, but you will be a convert after you try the Rolling Za.If you are looking for ""healthy"", I would have you try the Uptown Cobb salad. First of all, its huge. Even for a big guy like me, I was totally satisfied after eating it. Big fan of the Joe's Iced Tea they have - especially the Peach Iced Tea.Lastly there are three ""misses"", but considering how much I loved their pizza and their steaks and sandwiches, i'm hard pressed to drop the number of stars here.I tried their Irregular ""House Italian"" sandwich, and wasn't impressed. Vito's Hero is better.I also tried their thai wings, can't say i'm a huge fan. I like my wings more crispy. Maybe sauce on the side next time?Lastly I had their fries. Definitely needs salt & pepper before eating. I ordered the cheese fries and they come out limp. They need to learn how to ""double fry"" their french fries.Three strikes doesn't make an out for me here, the pizza really is great, along with the subs I tried.

I liked the chipotle sauce and steak and bread but I'm not sure I like the lettuce and tomato on it. Might just be me as it won the cheesesteak challenge on food network.Brotherly love has great homemade cheezwhiz. Bread was slightly soggier than the ole's. Again seems like they forgot an ingredient, didn't see long hots, but the relish was great.Thai wings were overcooked. The seasoning was good but thin.

We received a call a day later from someone who took down all the information needed. He seemed very thorough and had everything fully ready to go. The delivery was supposed to come at 6:00 on Sunday for 18 people.That's where the good news ended. The Super Bowl came, and the food was nowhere to be found. 6:00 passed. Then 6:30. At 6:40, I decided to call. First, I called their main line. I waited for 10 minutes, hung up, waited 10 minutes, and nothing. It went to an automated hold message and just left me on hold with a song in the background.I tried calling their catering hot line. No one picked up, so I left a message. You'd think on Super Bowl Sunday, their Super Bowl catering hotline would have someone. But nope.Finally, an hour and a half later and no response, call back, or anything, we gave up. We ordered somewhere else and got our food in an hour. This was as bad of customer service as you'd find. To take our order, yet not have an active phone number to contact is a complete joke. I will never be ordering from this place after the complete let down of not having food delivered to my party.Just a bad job, and I'm just so curious how an order could not just be forgotten, but how no one could be contacted the day of  a big ordering event.",Tony Boloney’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Pizza,, Sandwiches"

We started off with the basics - Grandma Patti pizza for my boyfriend (+ Boylan's soda) and a gluten-free OldMan Brooklyn pizza (+ Puck's black cherry fountain soda) for me. A tad bit pricy, but the quality stood up to the price. Around us, we could hear other diners emphatically saying how great their food was, too - so a good sign for the rest of their menu. Can't wait to try their other offerings.The place itself has a cool vibe, but could use more seating aside from just three 4-people tables and three bar stools - love, though, how the whole front wall can roll up to the outside for some fresh air.

I attempt to try a different kind of every time I come here (which is a lot) because they have the most creative topping combos that are ever changing.

I was already hooked when I tried their Atlantic City location, but now I can get my fix whenever I'm craving delicious cheesy meaty flavorful goodness.First visit to this location was during opening weekend and the owners actually remembered me from when I visited in A.C. Very nice guys. They sat down to talk and asked for my feedback, wanted to ensure the quality and taste is just as good as A.C., which it is. You can tell they take pride in their food and service.I've already made the trek from Brooklyn twice since opening. It's not a bad trip to make, take the train to WTC and then hop on the path. Usually takes me about 40 min. I make an excursion out of it: try a different slice each time to go with my must-have chicken or steak ole and some pucks sugarcane soda, and then have a picnic in the park next to the terminal looking across the water at the Manhattan skyline. If you live in Hoboken you have no excuse not to order at min once a week. Haha.

We got the Commodore, Pancho Franco, Steak Gauchito, and a special I believe was called the Pablo Pasaro, which was my favorite.

The salad was good and it was the type of Cesar dressing I loved, so I knew it wasn't cheap! They had garnished my sons meatball sub with basil I believe, which was a nice touch, but of course he picked off. The seats actually have outlets near every one, which a girl in her twenties would appreciate to charge her device and her sons tablet! :) Their are many pizzerias in this area naturally, but my son and I wanted to walk a bit before settling down to eat. They do accept card , which is always a plus, and I like the fountain drink selection, such as cheery coke and cream soda. The girls at the front were kind, and told me to pay after, since I was struggling to find my wallet while keeping an eye on my seated son. Bathrooms are unisex and unlocked, which I adore.

My bf had of course the cheesesteak ole' because it had a food network mention and it was the first thing on the menu. It was sooo good. I had a very difficult time trying to pick something so I asked one of the guys and they said no to both of my options and suggested the Boken-boy and I was very happy with that. I loved how all the flavors came together and at the end of your bite you have this fresh lemon taste. I would def recommend it. The onnnnly thing I would change is to toast the roll.

The 'Boken Boy was a good sandwich, but could have been assembled more quickly and/or with care. The buffalo chicken pizza -whatever the clever name for it was - was fantastic. The ten cheese pizza was doing too much and not better than a normal pizza.

Ordered $80+ of food online, only for it to come over 2hrs later, cold and congealed. Tried calling the place numerous times after being 30-40 mins late, and no one answered. So, pretty much the delivery guy made $15 on tip(included already when I ordered online), on top of their $2 delivery charge(despite taking over 2hrs to deliver cold food), and there's no one there who wants to pick up the phone to discuss the order.

357,cWL2Nn40pxyppPUPDcgu4A,C K.,1.0 star rating,"Over the weekend, we tried a Grandma Patti pie. While it was certainly flavorful, it was nearly impossible to eat. The pie itself was so soggy, that even a fork and knife didn't help in eating it. It was like pulling apart a sponge. Last night, willing to give it another shot, we ordered some wings and a sub and some fries, to see if they were any better. Hard to believe, but it was even worse. Who would have thought you could mess up a cheese steak with bacon and mozzarella on garlic bread to the point of being inedible?  The steak was so over cooked that it was dried out. It tasted days old. And the ingredients were so poorly mixed that I ate an entire bite of parsley. Not even sure how that happens. The only thing that was edible was the bread. The fries were also so over cooked that they were also inedible. The were mostly burned. How can you have 6 cheeses on fries and have them still come out dry? The bacon was also something you'd find in a diner after sitting on the grill for 10 hours. Lastly, we tried two types of wings. The Bayou and the Shitfaced. The Shitfaced ones were actually good. Really good, in fact. But the Bayou ones --- I dont know what I was expecting -- but I'm pretty sure they forgot to put the sauce on them. They were 100% dry and tasted like bland fried chicken.With so many choices in Hoboken, these ""faux gourmet' pizzas aren't going to cut it. Back to Philly's for steaks, too.",Tony Boloney’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Pizza,, Sandwiches"

360,9uzcsNA0CGK_339z56__HQ,Vic L.,3.0 star rating,Food is ok and priced too high for what they give you IMO.  Had the pesto chicken sandwich which was drowned in pesto and the chicken was kind of chewy.  Pizzas are all pretty cool/different and a good size. Kind of mayhem in there when ordering/getting food.I think they should cut their menu in half and make it better quality.  Not sure if I'd go back with the million authentic delis and pizza places in Hoboken already.With that being said it is GREAT after a night of drinking.,Tony Boloney’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Salad,, Pizza,, Sandwiches"

All in all, I wasted $20 for a really small 15"" pizza, that I ended up throwing half away.
