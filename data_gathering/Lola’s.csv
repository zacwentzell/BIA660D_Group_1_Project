We ordered up other tapas like the sausage and grilled pulpo!  I like the perfect crunch to my grilled pulpo as it was nicely drizzled with oil and dressing! Sausage plate was okay - noting, a typical fajita with grilled bell peppers in the mix.I like how they offered amuse bouche in the beginning.  It warmed up my liking to the whole experience.",Lola’s,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Spanish,, Tapas, Bars,, Wine, Bars"

The service was great.  It seemed like we didn't have one waiter, but everyone just helped out.  I think it is a great system.  If they see something in need, they helped out.  They kept the water filled and bread in the basket.The food was really good.  All the seafood dishes we had were great.  The shrimps and the fish dishes were the best.  I would just stick to seafood there.  If you get a steak dish, stick to the skirt steaks.  They were seasoned very well and were tasty.  The filet mignons were meh.The food is tapas which I believe is difficult for Americans.  I do think this place is expensive.  We had 7 tapas for 4 people and it wasn't quite enough.  We were satisfied, but not full.  I try not to eat like an American, but it is hard.  If you are a big eater and starving, do not come here.  If you want a different experience from most of the Hoboken restaurants, then come and try it out.  The food and service was great and I would definitely recommend coming here.",Lola’s,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Spanish,, Tapas, Bars,, Wine, Bars"

My girlfriend and I went out for a night in Hoboken and stumbled across Lola's. We decided to give it a shot.  We sat at the bar. Keep in mind, there was only one other table besides us in the restaurant. My girlfriend leaned in for a kiss and put her hand on my lap. Moments after, we were disrespectfully screamed by the owner. He said that we needed to stop this ""behavior"" because there are other tables in the restaurant who feel uncomfortable.  It was clear that his intentions were discriminatory. It was embarrassing as we felt judged by everyone in the restaurant. All eyes were on us. Not something I would expect in Hoboken in 2017.

You could not taste anything close to what a sangria should taste like. In fact we ordered the red and it looked pink. Very disappointing. For my dish I asked if I could have the Paella Valencia and if they could substitute the sausage for chicken as previously done. My waiter quickly said no that it couldn't be done. Even after I explained and showed pictures how they kindly made the change for me on my previous visit. The answer was still no.

Not bad but nothing special-squid w blank ink rice is one of my favorite dishes but was just ok here.  -octopus was rubbery and the sauce that came with it wasn't very good. Also not a good value at $16.  Essentially, everything was passable but nothing memorable.   There wasn't a single dish that I was like damn, we have to come back here for that.    Throw in the mediocre sangria and service and the prices being a coupe of bucks more than it should per tapa, and this isn't a recipe for a repeat visit.  On the plus side, I did see a sign of they have happy hour M-R till 11pm.  Hard to argue w HH till 11pm, even a mediocre one.",Lola’s,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Spanish,, Tapas, Bars,, Wine, Bars"

Let me say the pours were awesome, they were large pours and I can appreciate that. Also, our server Saul* ( I may be misspelling ) was the reason our experience was so good. He was on his game, he kept coming over making sure we weren't empty on our glasses. This man gave us fave star service but the food was a 2.5-3. We had the octopus and the avocado stuffed with crab. The octopus had a nice char on the exterior but it was a bit too chewy. It was in a vinegar sauce that was complimentary but could have been executed better. The avocado dish was eh, didn't love the flavor profile. It was under seasoned and felt like imitation crab meat and the shrimp seemed out of place. I wouldn't order that again.

He played ""here you go... just kidding"" with the menu for a minute (pretending to hand it to us but then pulling it back). Once we were handed the menu we noticed it was for food. We again asked if they had a wine list, when the old man said to us ""do you like Italian food? You know they have good Italian food across the street"". He then walked away and we were left standing there looking at each other in disbelief... did he actually just say that to us?!

A year later, we passed by here again and thought we'd give it a second chance, the venue itself is pretty charming and it has a few out door seating tables, so we decided to sit outdoor to try again. But once again, we didn't enjoy the food at all. This time we ordered Seafood Salad, Fresh Tuna in Tomato Source, Rib and Seafood Paella. I ordered the tuna to be rare, it came out medium, it was very chewy and salty. I only had 2 bites and couldn't eat it anymore. The seafood salad was not great, either, it felt the seafood was sitting in the source for way too long, all very soggy. Rib was kinda of ok, the paella probably was the best one out of all, but also very salty.The service was pretty good and friendly, but it really didn't make up for the taste of food....

You step in and immediately feel like you're in another place - it has a distinct Spanish decor. We grabbed two seats at the bar (it wasn't overly crowded for a Friday night) and asked the bartender for a drink suggestion. We needed up ordering a small carafe of the mango sangria, which was AMAZING. He bartender made it right in front of us, and in total we each had 3 glasses for $19.99 - unbelievably reasonable for Hoboken drink prices. To top it off, the staff brought us complimentary tapas that were delicious! Can't wait to go back and try another flavored sangria.",Lola’s,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Spanish,, Tapas, Bars,, Wine, Bars"

Our table of five was seated quickly and the staff could not have been nicer. Sensing we were hot they brought over water immediately. We got a pitcher of white sanrgia it was very tasty. If you closed your eyes you would swear you were in Spain. The decor transported me right back to Madrid. We did not just have one waiter we had two. They kept the water and bread basket full.  We were also served a garlic potato amuse bouche. We tried a few different dishes, Chicken, Beef, Tortilla espanola, Avocado stuffed with crab and lobster and another potato dish. All was great to share and the right amount of food after the festival. One of the older waiters was a real jokester. A taller distinguished gentleman I assume the owner came over to see if we enjoyed our meal. At the end of the meal they brought us some tasty shots with whiskey, cinnamon and milk. Still not sure what I had but it was very good. the restaurant started to get full as we were leaving. I believe this is a hidden gem in the Hoboken dining scene.

The portabello mushrooms were addicting and the stuffed avocado and bacon wrapped scallops were good too. I just probably wouldn't come back because it was way overpriced for hoboken. Not being a byob doesn't help. We got 3 tapas and 2 glasses of wine each (so 4 glasses total) and our bill was around $78 before tip. It was barely a full meal.

That being said, I would not call this a Spanish tapas place given that their most recommended dish is the lobster ravioli in lobster sauce. The wine list is huge here (both figuratively and literally) and lots of options under $30. We did a bunch of plates and were mostly pretty pleased. Patatas bravas - skip this guy. Just potatoes in tomato sauce. Chipirones en su tinta - this was so unique and delicious. The rice was cooked in squid ink and the calamari itself was cooked to perfect tenderness in a red sauce. Really tasty and I highly recommend this. Gambones a la plancha - good, but nothing special. Your basic shrimp in a garlic sauce. Mejillones en salsa verde - this was pretty tasty and different. Mussels were well prepared in a flavorful, not spicy, green sauce. Churrasco con setas portobello - super tender skirt steak and mushrooms. This was a generous portion of perfectly cooked steak. Get this if you like dead animal. One thing to note on the service: I accidentally ordered the wrong shrimp dish and when they brought it out and we told them we meant to order the other, they switched it for us, no questions asked, no charge.

Not a great selection by any means but what I did have was good.For food, we ordered the small cheese plate which was really good. It's one of my go to dishes here to start. We ordered 4 plates: 2 veggie (mushrooms & Spanish tortilla), 2 meat (pork skewers & bacon wrapped scallops). The meat came out first which surprised us. When we finished that the waiter asked if we were done to which I informed him that our other two dishes never came. They promptly fixed that and brought them out after we were already pretty full.

We started with a pitcher of white sangria, which was just OK for me. I will definitely try the red next time. The first thing I noticed was that the restaurant was incredibly smoky - the table next to us had ordered some kind of dish that comes ""volcano style"" - literally, on fire, and it seemed to take forever for the fire to die out. The smoke was thick and stinky and ridiculous - it made me cough even after it had gone out. For the sake of the other diners around you, don't order that, whatever it is. Rude. We went with a bunch of dishes:The Avocado Stuffed w/ Lobster meat and Shrimp was my favorite by far. It was so good, the combination of flavors was so interesting and delicious. The Goat Cheese w/Wild Mushrooms over Pita Bread was also incredibly good. It was the perfect mix of sweet and savory with just a light drizzle of olive oil. Scallops with bacon over raspberry sauce with almonds was also good. I liked the combination of the savory scallops in bacon with the sweet raspberry sauce - could have done without the almonds though, they were kind of pointless. We also got Chicken cooked in a whiskey sauce - it was good, but nothing too special. Same with the Filet mignon with peppers and onions - good, but not outstanding. We decided not to stay for dessert, mostly because it took so long for our waiter to get to our table after we were done eating.

Upon walking in we were greeted immediately and sat down at a table. We ordered a pitcher of sangria, which was mediocre and priced rather high at $28. After looking over the menu for a couple minutes we had a couple questions which our server had no problems answering for us. We placed our order and waited for the food...First up was the small cheese plate. I believe there was 4, maybe 5 slices of cheese total which came with a couple pieces of dried fruit and grapes which had seeds in them (surprise!). The cheeses weren't very tasty, but I wasn't going to let it bother me. Next up was the avocado stuffed with lobster and shrimp ""special"" that I've read some nice reviews about. It came out looking delicious, and we both dug right in. Yummmm. Then, it happened. As I was eating my food I came to find a rather long hair in my mouth (surprise #2). We sent our plate back and kindly asked for another. Five minutes later another plate came out and all was good, or so we thought.  As soon as the plate was put on the table I knew something was wrong. The food wreaked like it was spoiled. One sniff and it was confirmed. We called back our waiter and explained the situation. We asked him to smell the food, which he declined and brought back to the kitchen. Needless to say, we didn't ask for a third try and it was taken off our bill. We ended with the filet mignon with peppers and onions in a red wine sauce. Luckily, everything was fine with that plate and we ate it up because we were both still very hungry. We quickly finished the rest of the sangria, paid our bill and made our way out of Lola's.

We ended up settling in at the bar and decided a table wasn't really necessary. The bar tender was nice but not overly talkative or attentive, she seemed to prefer to blend into the background or speak with other customers, which was fine because we kept ourselves well occupied.I decided on a house red wine to start and then transferred over to the sangria. The sangria wasn't too shabby, but it wasn't too fantastic either, whereas the wine was excellent. When we finally got around to ordering we went with three tapas - the names of which are hard to remember... one was a chorizo or sausage, which came in little links. We also ordered a steak with cheese and some sort of baked egg/omelet/potato-y thing. Everything was tasty, but nothing stood out and knocked us over.

But, I think it's pretty fair to say that nothing is special about the food here. It was all cooked very well, but the sauces and garnish did absolutely nothing to compliment the food at all. The chicken in whiskey sauce tasted like plain chicken. The chef's swordfish tasted like plain swordfish. No additional flavor to it. Nothing unique.That being said, I wouldn't be opposed to coming back to grab a glass of wine at the bar. Just be prepared for the comically large wine list if you plan on dining here.

For dinner, my husband and I ordered: the goat cheese special which was goat chesse on pita bread triangles with a pesto-ish (?) sauce, meatballs, bacon-wrapped scallops and patatas bravas. The scallops were my fav: wrapped in bacon with a raspberry sauce base. Too deelish! For dessert, my husband ordered the cannolli cake while I opted for the flan. I should've gone with something else b/c I have very high expectations when it comes to flan and this one did not make the cut. The cannolli cake, however, was tasty. Unfortunately, I can't speak to the wine that we had because even though I ordered three glasses of the same wine - I never got the same one twice. Same thing for my husband. Not sure what's going on behind the bar here but it's a bit disappointing to enjoy a wine enough to order a second glass only to discover it's something else.

The other dishes went from bland (buey) to average (tortilla and chipirone). We also ordered the red velvet cake to split at the end - it was yummy until the green food coloring turned our mouths green. They sat the slice of cake on top of a pool of vanilla ice cream mixed with a tablespoon of green food coloring. Completely unnecessary. I didn't like the sangria very much at all.

Its a great place for groups -- and I never had difficulties making a reservation for 8-10+ people more than a week in advance.As many of the reviews reflect, the service is spotty.  On the first of my recent visits, the bar tender was friendly and attentive as our group waited for everyone to arrive.  Once we moved to the table, the service was certainly adequate, but nothing to write home about.  The last visit was not as good -- was hard to find someone to seat us and service was lackluster.Yes, the tapas are pricey -- but most tapas restaurants I've been too are similar -- you order all these small plates and before you know it, the bill really adds up.  But in general, the food is pretty good and they certainly keep the sangria flowing.I gave it 3 stars because as I mentioned, it really is good for groups.  Don't think I'd go out of my way though to go to Lola's with a smaller party.",Lola’s,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Spanish,, Tapas, Bars,, Wine, Bars"

For dinner we had the Lobster Ravioli (which I found a little salty); Croquetas del dia, a spinach and cheese croquette (really delicious) and Pollo al vino Ribiero (while good flavor wise was a little overcooked).

142,E-IpggfDuur0TyMPQZdXEg,Elizabeth R.,3.0 star rating,"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon Lolas last night, on our way to another restaurant for dinner. We decided to take a chance and try something new. We lived in Barcelona for 6 months and whenever we see a tapas spot it catches our eye, hoping it will bring back memories of life in Spain. It was a gorgeous evening so we grabbed a table outside, the server promptly came over handing us menus and asking if we'd like a drink. Considering its a spanish place with tapas, Sangria was in order, so we got a pitcher for the 2 of us to share. It was HUGE, seemingly bottomless, good thing, considering when we got the check it was $27! It was alright, lots of fresh fruit, but obviously cheap wine, lacking depth, and it was not strong at all. After finishing the entire pitcher you'd think we'd be feeling it, nope. A basket of nice quality crusty bread was delivered with a choice of 3 dipping oils; garlic, basil, or rosemary, so not spanish, but it was a nice thing to have on the table. On to the food, we ordered 3 tapas to share. To start off, tapas are small bites, and these items were much larger than traditional spanish tapas, and the price reflects that. It was not as authentic as I had hoped but it was ok. The shrimp with garlic, artichokes and serrano ham had a nice flavor, but the shrimp were slightly over cooked and small, and the ham was cubed and chewy, definitely the lowest quality spanish ham they could have used. We also ordered the spinach and chickpeans, which had a curry flavor, a little odd for a spanish place, and then the skirt steak in sofrito, which was really fantastic, the most tender piece of skirt steak either of us had ever had. It was really nice to soak up the broth and sauce with the bread at the end. We chose to skip dessert and just sip on the sangria. Although, Lolas seemed to have several options, definitely not traditional spanish desserts, and made off premises, or ordered from another place. Not a fan of that. One of each dessert was displayed on a tiered cake plate, that is brought to the table, they had obviously been sitting out for atleast a few days and looked shriveled, and old, hardly appetizing. Skip dessert here, but if you're going for a casual date or light dinner with friends, its a cool place.",Lola’s,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Spanish,, Tapas, Bars,, Wine, Bars"
143,cxbDYAd0sgbr4jCa-barRQ,Megan L.,3.0 star rating,"OK here's the thing about Lolas - it has more strong points than weak.  It really does.  My bf lives a couple blocks down from the place so its actually one of a few ""date night"" locations for us.  I've been there about 5 or 6 times...so why would you continue to go to a restaurant you only give 3 out of 5 stars for date night you ask?  well...  It's very romantic in there - dimly lit, small dark corners w privacy...it makes you feel like you're in a medieval spanish wine cellar.  i love the decor and ambiance.  if i was judging just that i'd give it 5 stars.I would even give its staff a decent rating: for the most part they're pretty fast and attentive.  no worthy complaints there.But, I'm not impressed with the food.  Being seriously addicted to seafood, I always have to try whatever ceviche dish spanish restaurants have.  So that is what I instinctively did at Lola's...and is not good.  Actually kinda bad.  Although they used a good variety of seafood in the dish (shrimp, mussels, clams, squid, etc) the dish is drenched in oil and the taste is overpowered w nonsense.  do.not.order.it,  I have forgotten how awful the ceviche is at Lolas and I order it anyway and it pretty much ruins my night.Their chorizo and peppers were kind of overcooked and they couldve been a little more generous w the chorizo.  And I've also tried the salmon w mustard dressing and it had way too much dressing.I will tell you what is good at Lola's though and it surprised me too: their leek soup.  I'm about as Irish as they come and my bf, who is Welsh in descent and grew up on the stuff, well we have a high standard on food that usually belongs to our ancestors.  but lola's soup is just the right balance of creamy and sweet.  it's delicious.  my bf and i love the stuff.  the soup also gets 5 stars.What's NOT good is the fact that i have seen not one but a couple break up dinners at lolas - those are very uncomfortable to be within hearing distance of but fun when you get to guess what they're saying and how they're ending it.  Kind of like a real version of the TV show Blind Date.  But seeing that twice in a relatively short period of time makes me ask myself if this restaurant is marketing themselves on being ""THE #1 break-up restaurant of Hoboken"".  End tangent, more about food.Lola's does have a pretty extensive menu though and their portions are so big its hardly a tapas and more an entree.   and I have to say that a lot of its items are somewhat affordable (the seafood is a huge exception to that)  Their wine selection is pretty good as well.  Overall I would recommend this place for a quick nosh with a safe tapas but not a full meal where you show up starving.  But, maybe the ideal break-up restaurant?",Lola’s,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Spanish,, Tapas, Bars,, Wine, Bars"
