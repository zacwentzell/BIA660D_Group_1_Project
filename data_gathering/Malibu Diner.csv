Diner food has a special place in my heart. Breakfast served at all hours of the day, fluffy waffles, crispy fries, satisfying Reubens, and let's not forget, a classic Greek salad. Friendly staff, a familiar hustle and bustle, and creamy milkshakes. Classic.Unfortunately, Malibu doesn't fit the bill. I've tried to order a range of food here: penne vodka with shrimp, fish and chips, Belgium waffles, French onion soup, Manhattan clam chowder, Reuben, burgers, crab cake burger, omelette, sizzling skillet eggs, onion rings, fries, salads, and more. The only reliable meals here are limited: (salty) French onion soup, a waffle, and an omelette. Beyond that, you're taking a risk. Other items on the menu are low on flavor, over cooked, soggy, and sad. Worse, it's extremely overpriced. For a waffle, eggs,  soup, and two hot drinks, I've just spent $38. Ouch! Unless you're craving a plate of fries or chicken wings and a waffle, save yourself the disappointment.",Malibu Diner,3.0 star rating,$$,"Diners,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Sandwiches"

I had ordered the eggs Benedict with the salmon and I was extremely excited to try it out. Once it arrived I saw how the first egg had a lot of raw spots where the clear or the yolk was showing. I didn't want to be picky so I tried my best to eat around it. Once I got to the second egg, however, it was impossible to eat. The whole inside of the egg was clear and uncooked. I had our server take a look and he agreed and apologized. My stomach immediately began to hurt and although my order was remade I just decided to go home and take it to go.As I got hungry throughout the day I decided to eat the order they made for me to go. Hours later the stomach pain turned into far more worse. I have the worst food poisoning ever. Going on 20 hours of severe stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.

We didn't want wine even though it was part of the Friday night special, so we got soft drinks instead and everything was swell when it was our entree, soup, and salad. My boyfriend ordered the French Onion soup since he's been on a French Onion soup kick, but sadly the French Onion soup was not on par. It seems no effort was put into trying broil the cheese. The cheese wasn't broiled at all. I ordered the Shrimp & Chicken Francese over rice, but the shrimp lacked flavor and taste, definitely too much breading. After eating our entrees, we had to ask the waitress about dessert and she also failed to mention there was coffee and tea offered. I think as customers we shouldn't have to ask if something is offered and she or the staff should know this. It feels as though the staff has changed and so has the service.

Toast is super generic barely soaks up my eggs5. Cookies and brownies are awful, expensive, inedible",Malibu Diner,3.0 star rating,$$,"Diners,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Sandwiches"

It has always been consistently mediocre diner food (with a parking lot) to have late night disco fries or an anytime breakfast. Well this relationship is no longer working. The service is the only redeeming quality at this point. The staff is always quick, friendly and a lot of the wait staff has been there forever. The food has consistently gone downhill (from the middle of the hill to begin with...). What used to be a decent diner breakfast, is all frozen or from a can. The corned beef hash is cat food. I've never seen anything more disgusting. The owners could turn this place around so easily. They need to cut the menu down and focus on making fresh food with better ingredients. They need to get rid of the frozen sausage and hash browns... And are those even real eggs? With the menu changes, this place would be packed for breakfast and dinner. Some fun dinner specials that aren't soup from an economy sized plastic bag or mystery meatloaf would attract us for dinner. Honestly, I don't even feel safe eating the food. I always feel like I am one bite away from a vacation to the food poisoning spa. The prices are outrageous. Breakfast for two can easily run up a $40 tab.... For frozen, canned food? Yeah, no thanks. Here's an idea - how about making some menu changes, which would increase volume and then you won't have to monetarily rape your clients for crappy food? All of my friends have stopped eating here also. There are many better options in town these days. Please wake up Malibu. The atmosphere is prime for a great Hoboken diner experience.

The food was mediocre but nothing spectacular. When going up to the counter and paying, we were all puzzled at the fact that they had Already included 20% gratuity when We had barely received any type of service that would be worthy of that. When we explained our experience to the manager, he blankly stared at us (with unapologetic gestures and eyes) and said nothing. We were forced to leave the 20% gratuity tip and did not even receive an apology from the manager, he literally just walked away after we explained the service and looked annoyed with us.

My dinner companion didn't fare much better.  Her steak was cold and had to be sent back to be reheated. How can you not tell that food is cold when you bring it out?You have to ask for bread.  They don't bring it automatically. And anything else you might need.I had a couple of bites and gave up.  Brought it all home in a doggie bag.  My pets liked the marinara sauce.

The best cheese steak he's ever had! Last but certainly not least, grandma opted for the classic chicken parm sandwich.

First of all, it's Hoboken that we're talking about, so you know right away that the prices are going to be higher than some other outlying towns.We ate there after a Friday night event, around 11ish, so there wasn't much of a wait. Rather, we were seated instantly seeing that the place looked like it was looking for business. For a diner, I have to say that it's modernized when it comes to decor and ambiance. Honestly, it looked like a diner - something that I expected. Clean I might add.I ordered a chicken pesto panini with sweet potato fries substituted for the normal ones. I really can't say that the sandwich stood out from other things I've tried at other diners, but it certainly was a smidgen better. Satisfying from beginning to end, the chicken pesto panini was evenly portioned and cooked to perfection - and I have to say that the presentation was nice. As for the sweet potato fries, they too were perfectly cooked and presented. Thankfully, they didn't look too greasy, plus, they didn't smother it in salt, which is wonderful in keeping its ""healthy"" aspect intact.For a diner, the food was good, but not great. However, the only downside is that I could've probably ordered the same exact panini at another diner for less.

At the supple age of fifteen she left her home, with nothing but a cloth rucksack and an advanced case of psoriatic arthritis which made her really hate those Phil Mickelson commercials.Fatefully landing at the Malibu Diner, she quickly fell in with the wrong crowd. Bikers, mostly - just causing havoc, nothing illegal. Once she discovered her uncanny ability to pour consistent portions of pancake batter she saw her way out of the struggle. She left her man, Chazz, and started a new life, away from the perils of the streets, pouring one pancake at a time. You only do two pancakes, she used to tell herself, the one you go in, and the one you go out.Bottom line is, Tina's an idiot and always burns the pancakes.

Last time I was there they had a peanut butter banana pancake that was amazing! For your morning to begin I would also recommend the French Toast, Waffles or Eggs Benidict. If lunch or dinner is more of your style you can never go wrong starting with the super sampler. I would recommend any of there sandwiches esp a Burger or the Pastrami Panin. If you are in the mind for something larger try the Linguini con Camberi or even Roast Sirloin or Beef, Au.

The green beans tasted like canned and the mashed potatoes were from a box.  Only the salad was palatable.  To make matters worse, the owner was nasty, even though our waiter did his best to make everyone happy.

I also ordered some soup (whatever the soup of the day was) and it was much worse than what you can get from a decent can of Campbells or Progresso. Decor was tacky, but the place was relatively clean.

My sister and I were craving a corned beef sandwich so we went on a Saturday afternoon. I suppose most people are dining at a cafe of some sort down Washington and such, so it wasn't too busy - meaning quick to get seated and served. two stars for that. We ordered a milkshake to share. The portion is just right for one person; not super big like typical diners where you expect to share liberally between two people. Our waiter took our order for two corned beef sandwiches. I wish he had told us that it would be SUPER dry and to consider getting a reuben sandwich instead. It literally was just slabs of meet smushed into two pieces of dry bread, no cheese, no sauce, nothing else. I suggest that you order a reuben instead because the regular corned beef sandwiches were too dry. My sister ended up doggy-bagging one half of it for our dog at home! Not a fun meal. We got a side of cole slaw and pickles which partially helped to moisten our parched mouths. Total for two sandwiches, a milkshake, a side of fries totalled out to 20 bucks. Not bad but not sure if we'd go back here.
