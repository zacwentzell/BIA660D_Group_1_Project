0,MBBOjG21Oe9iIYJNLdcHnA,Tara M.,4.0 star rating,"So, let me start by saying its been well over 10yrs since i ordered from John's. I used to order and eat here as a teenager when I attended high school nearby. I ordered the Breakfast Burrito and actually it was pretty good, I was extremely skeptical about the cream cheese being on the wrap but it wasn't half bad. It was good not great, and the salsa that I had thought would be inside the wrap was in a separate cup. My order was complete rather quickly and was not costly at all. All in all my breakfast was good and prepared in a timely manor which I am grateful for seeing how I work in a hospital and time is of the essence lol.",John’s Lunchonette,4.0 star rating,,"American, (Traditional),, Cafes"

2,3vFDtKvDgju9iCEdAqM9YQ,Rena K.,2.0 star rating,"0 stars for service and delivery, 3 stars for the food.I placed an order for a chicken sandwich, turkey sandwich, soup, and a salad from John's Lunchonette via Eat24 (Yelp's delivery service) and didn't receive my order until 1 hour and 45 minutes later. The estimate of the delivery was 45-60 minutes. I get that lunch is a busy time for restaurants, but I do expect a call or some kind of notification if my delivery is going to be so over the estimate.I've had really late deliveries before and didn't think that it was a huge deal, but they ended up forgetting one my sandwiches too. When we called in to ask for a refund for that sandwich as we didn't want to wait another 1.5 hours for the missing sandwich, the lady accused us of lying. She basically put us on hold for several minutes, but didn't mute the phone so we could hear her and her boss talking about how we were lying about the missing sandwich. If I were to lie about something, don't you think I would've chosen to lie about the most expensive thing that I ordered, not a $5 sandwich??The sandwich, salad, and soup were decent, but the rudeness definitely put a damper on this experience and I will not order from here again.",John’s Lunchonette,4.0 star rating,,"American, (Traditional),, Cafes"

4,tUd381aBNX_dczcR8ZgKIQ,Arslan Z.,5.0 star rating,"I took the western omelette with homefries and toast. It was an extremely generous portion with fresh vegetables and cheese. Coffee was excellent too. Overall, great service, very friendly staff; with genuinely nice people and to top things off, the total was very reasonable!",John’s Lunchonette,4.0 star rating,,"American, (Traditional),, Cafes"
5,ek4FZeEunXXMO7syvmXGeg,Nick G.,5.0 star rating,"We were completely blindsided by this place. It looks like they're should be a line cook back there, but no mistake, that guy is a chef. Our genuine reaction when the food was put down was ""what the Fuck"" because it looked like food from a another, much more expensive, restaurant was put down.The mozzarella in the omelette is fresh, the coffee is excellent, and the hash is otherworldly. Eat at this place.My only regret is I have but five stars to give.",John’s Lunchonette,4.0 star rating,,"American, (Traditional),, Cafes"
6,cYolrOJ6x-qVPLm2jat5Ww,Sophia B.,5.0 star rating,"Have only been for breakfast but they certainly do this well. It's sparse inside and can be chilly but portions are generous, prices reasonable, ingredients are fresh and the staff are so friendly, especially the chef. Recommendations for the French toast, anything with the home fries which are out of this world, and the bacon.",John’s Lunchonette,4.0 star rating,,"American, (Traditional),, Cafes"
7,CLby1rP4dKTsPX0h32FMCA,Mia M.,5.0 star rating,$10 min on card. Place is packed with HS. Kids during the week lunch hours. Love the lunch specials on Friday: seafood! Had the seafood in spicy sauce over choice of pasta. It was well done and delish. Must try other things but since this was so good might stick to it every Friday!,John’s Lunchonette,4.0 star rating,,"American, (Traditional),, Cafes"
8,h333mMU7mev4a5BD-JDgHg,Allison B.,5.0 star rating,"Came here on a lunch break from jury duty. Immediately after we ordered our food, the place became packed with high school students. The staff did their best with serving a huge volume of people as efficiently as possible. The food was very good. The staff even gave us (huge!) pieces of complimentary dessert, for being patient during the short wait for our lunches. The carrot cake and cheesecake were great. Thanks, John's!",John’s Lunchonette,4.0 star rating,,"American, (Traditional),, Cafes"

Im pretty sure they are only open for breakfast and lunch, but they deliver both!Delivery does take some time but they tell you that. I plan ahead, an hour later delicious hot brunch.

The pasta salad that comes with them is pretty good too.decent prices.",John’s Lunchonette,4.0 star rating,,"American, (Traditional),, Cafes"
10,1Rm5i5k5QnkUx07qklNjMA,Nicole R.,2.0 star rating,"The food here is just ok, but the prices are reasonable. My biggest issue--the pancakes had an option for fruit and nuts, which was extra money bs plain pancakes, of course. They had us choose between strawberries and pineapple. When the food came, they had given us a mixture of oranges and cantaloupe--neither or which belong on pancakes. Oh and no nuts at all. Pro tip--don't get the fruit on the pancakes. It was a rip off. The fruit was totally inedible too. Also, my fiancé got the breakfast burrito which came with cream cheese. We thought that was weird and assumed they mean sour cream. Regardless we requested sour cream instead of cream cheese. Needless to say, it came with cream cheese. It was weird. In addition they gave an option of whole wheat or white toast. Chose whole wheat, got white. Don't give people a choice if you're not going to actually listen. I feel like ordering from here is a crapshoot and they really don't care about your requests at all. The food is cheap though. So there's that. Prob will avoid in the future unless desperate.",John’s Lunchonette,4.0 star rating,,"American, (Traditional),, Cafes"
11,bVJta1O3X3UG0OvXIKqV0g,Claire P.,2.0 star rating,"This review is for John's Luncheonette at 553 Newark Ave- I assume this is the same place because the full name is not locatable on Google Maps.Because the quality of delivery around this area of Jersey City can be so iffy, I ordered a range of different dishes from John's today, in the hopes at least one of them would be at least worth three stars itself. This did not happen.The ONE thing I gotta give credit for:John's willingly (and within a reasonable 45 minute range between ordering and delivering) delivered a number of lunch foods to me at 10AM. They also have a breakfast menu, but unlike many places around here, did not make a fuss about me not ordering from it during the very-obviously-breakfast time.Now, everything else:- The WORST was the fact that I paid $6.50 for ""Buffalo Calamari,"" an appetizer which was supposed to be calamari tossed in buffalo sauce. Sauce coming on the side is no problem- but the squid wasn't even breaded! That's actually a totally different dish and not one I would have paid ANY money for-- it's the equivalent of buying onion rings and instead receiving only a mass of cooked onions. - The main title ingredients of the Chicken and Vegetable soup were overcooked and bland, and floating in a very greasy broth.- The chicken parmigiana was technically edible, but pretty meh taste-wise and not in any way worth the calories.I ordered bacon to be added as an extra for extra money, and had to remove it because it was undercooked. There was little to no marinara sauce, and I was pretty creeped out trying to figure out what parts of the chicken had ended up breaded and in the sandwich...If none of that bothers you, know that the sandwich was at least well-stuffed.- I'd give the Italian Express Grinder a 3 out of 5 stars. It definitely had the potential to be a good mix of ingredients, just needs someone with a trained palate to taste-test the recipe. The cured meats overwhelmed the other ingredients a tad too intensely, and the melted cheese didn't seem right (not sure whether it was the melted quality or its taste or both).When I removed the majority of the cured meat, and, from my own fridge, added some mild smoked ham, a little mayo and some mustard, it became relatively good. I would also recommend John's add some fresh herbs. Overall, I do not recommend this place.",John’s Lunchonette,4.0 star rating,,"American, (Traditional),, Cafes"
12,W2RoXCttIqFcw1CJKaNPKA,David B.,2.0 star rating,"Good food, but don't order delivery.  They cannot deal with volume delivery so if they are busy expect an hour plus wait.  Also, anytime it has been an order for four or more, they screw it up.  If the girl answers the phone, just order from somewhere else.",John’s Lunchonette,4.0 star rating,,"American, (Traditional),, Cafes"
