0,z7dilHN7EWd3l2gTvdbdCA,Carlos D.,4.0 star rating,I am so happy that it was my first time trying out their classic burger! And I may say it was phenomenal. The fries were a little cold but it was no big deal. I had one big issue which was the temperature in the building. Downstairs it seemed pretty good but when I got upstairs I could not stop sweating! It was incredibly hot upstairs. Including the small space we chose and the little tiny chairs the heat of the upstairs made it very uncomfortable. Thank you for the amazing food,The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

We started with excellent bloody Mary's and some deviled eggs- both were very good. Very main course I had pig's cheek hash with poached eggs- it was very good- eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash was tasty. My friends got the burger w shoe string fries- they said it was real good. It def was big and juicy, and cooked perfectly. Food and service were both very good. It is tight in there and it can get very crowded. Food and Drinks were all very good.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

3,IVYnHsB6y-tUNXxdp0dcIQ,Melanie Z.,4.0 star rating,It is definitely different without your classic lettuce and tomatoes. I would admit it might not be for everyone.

4,F1tGD2s3FoPxHfiorlVDVg,Joyce C.,3.0 star rating,"I've heard about the Spotted Pig for years and finally got to go this past weekend for brunch. The food was definitely delicious, but nothing eye opening like its price point suggests. For value, I've been to better restaurants. I ordered the **Sizzling Sisig** ($17) their take on a Filipino classic. The richness of the pork fat was balanced by the tangy sours marination. It wasn't the best sisig that I've had, and for the price point of $17 (sisig usually goes for much much less), I was a disappointed. My friend had the **Two Poached Eggs and Pork Hash** ($18). The hash had an underlying sweetness which was great with its general meatiness, but again, not novel enough to justify the price tag. The staff was very kind, not only were we seated immediately but they were very accommodating in the small space.  The aesthetic of the restaurant was definitely cozy and bed-and-breakfast-in-the-countryside-y.  I'm glad I came here because I've heard so much about it, but alas, it was not a value experience that I would repeat again.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

With such a long  wait time, we figure we would have a little more time to get back to the restaurant.  Little did we know we came back and our table was given up. Irritating but understandable.  So we gave it another try the following day for lunch services, went with their famous burger and fries. The burger we decadent and rich, shoestring fries was on point, perfectly salted and fried with herbs and garlic.  Somewhat overrated but a must try if time permits.

8,pBrC08aM-pkqEVjIluBNjA,Emily M.,3.0 star rating,"I think this place is very overrated. The food was fine, but there was nothing that felt special or worth the insane waiting time. Their website says they open at 5:30 so we arrived at 5:37 thinking the wait would be quick, but it was still an hour for two people. There are about 10-15 tables which is why it takes so long to be seated, but the wait for food was also crazy. We were seated in front of the open kitchen door, with glaring fluorescent lights in our face and people constantly brushing up against us. The cocktails were fine, but tasted like juice nothing more. We ordered the gnudi, cockle special and the burger. After waiting almost an hour for the appetizers we were sent almonds as an apology for the wait. The gnudi was a good texture but very salty. After almost two hours the burger came out. It was cooked perfectly but again was very salty with nothing to cut the richness of the overpowering salty Roquefort.

The thing is I've been craving Spotted Pigs food -- specifically the deviled eggs for yeaaaars and I finally came back with my fiancé because I raved about them and needed a second opinion. Of course the consistency of the food here is amazing and they tasted just as I remembered them!!! The 3 stars are strictly for how great the food was. Chicken liver toast -- decadent Hanger steak -- mouth watering Gnudi in brown butter -- creamy And sautéed kale -- lightly seasoned and healthy portion !!!Now the service.............. might of been where the experience feel a little sophomoric. Our server seemed very ""off"" ... he recited the specials as a joke and laughed a lot and almost looked like he didn't really want to engage. And for such a small spot you'd think each guest interaction mattered. Anyway, he forgot my wine and when I told him he was like ""oh yea..."". After the food started coming out he NEVER QUALITY CHECKED A THING. No exaggeration, we didn't see him until he dropped th check off. But literally he was talking and accompanying friends at the bar the whole time and left his section untouched until a new table arrived next to ours.

15,EYmljXzTUytC1XPF51NLCA,Justin C.,4.0 star rating,"I can imagine its tough being the Spotted Pig. On one hand, you got a great establishment with overwhelming demand, on the other hand, that demand creates a bottle neck in service. Not to say that service is bad at all, if and when you do get serviced it's top notch. Wait times can be ridiculous and bar seating is first come first serve, so prepare to throw down some bows if necessary. The atmosphere is dark, fun, corky, loud, and sometimes pretentious, but with all these negatives, this place will win you over with their food and cocktails for sure. A bit bougie and upscale prices paired with the fun and laid back casual dive feel, this place serves up some serious cocktails with a true mixologist behind the bars that you would expect at a speakeasy. Perfectly crafted and executed drinks that will put hair on your chest, but it comes at a price. The nitty gritty britty food will definitely set the bar high for a gastropub. It's got that flair that makes you question if complex elevation techniques are necessary to make great food. The balance in quality ingredients with precise executions is what I feel that sets the Spotted Pig apart. The chicken liver toast is a favorite here and I would agree. It's got a really light creamy texture with all the right balance of sweet and savory. I'm a sucker for fries and the shoestring fries here are delicious. It's light and airy with perfectly fried rosemary bits and garlic slices to give it that zing. The famous burger is a solid choice but not quite worth the hype in my opinion especially at that price point. Overall, this place has its quirks that many reviewers have mentioned, but to take away from this place because its just too busy is a little harsh. It makes sense to be frustrated with wait times in NYC, it's just in our nature, so the real question is, is it worth the wait times? I guess you'll have to figure that out for yourself.

Seating is incredibly tight, I suggest the bar or anywhere not on the right side of the restaurant. They had to move the table for 1 person to get seated on a bench. Not comfortable. Menu is small, but I came for the burger and shoestring fries. If you are not fond of bleu cheese, the burger is not for you. It is heavy with cheese. The fries however are delicious, so thin and crispy. Food came out pretty quick.

18,LFnWmO-SdntnugRRqj2nDw,Brittany T.,4.0 star rating,"Really 3.5 stars, I was torn because it was better than A-OK but I'm not sure I'm a ""fan.""WAIT: No reservations means we got there at 5:27 hoping to get in quickly.  Although their hours don't reflect it, they dont start serving dinner until 5:30pm (but I think you can sit at the bar?) so we put our name down and they said for 2 people it would be about a 15 minute wait.  We sat outside waiting and around 5:48 pm or so they called us in.ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant is pretty large even though it looks small because there is an upstairs.  It's very eclectic and fun inside, not what I was imagining.  It does have white tablecloths and nice candles but the decor is very fun and witty.  Lots of pig related items.  There are small nooks and crannies to the restaurant which is nice.  We sat at a table where you sit next to each other and the table is in front.  It was a nice alcove. I could see you coming here for a date or with a girlfriend.FOOD: Of course we came here because we watched April Bloomfield in Mind of a Chef.  We knew the burger was good and after going to salvation burger wanted to try the original.CHICKEN LIVER TOAST - torn between this and the Gnudi, I went with this because it was half the price of the Gnudi! It comes with 2 pieces but is well enough for 2 people.  The bread they put it on is a nice rustic, crusty, fresh loaf.  It's thick too! Very good.  The pate itself was one of the best I've had...it wasn't overly ""liver"" tasting and the herb on top (I'm not sure what it was) gave it a meatball-ish taste.  My husband couldn't finish all of his because he said they really piled on the pate so it was too much for him.BURGER - got it medium rare, which is usually perfect for us but I think for here...I would get medium next time.  The medium rare was almost too rare where the burger was a little cold and the meat was mushy.  It wasn't like other burger places where the meat is a little more crumbly.  It comes with shoestring fries and is enough for 2 people to share.  The burger itself is pretty plain unlike some that we've had in the past.  It has the patty, the bun, and cheese.  The cheese tasted a little like a bleu cheese and was the most flavor we got out of the burger.  To the point where it overshadowed the meat.  The bun was forgettable, not super crisp on the outside but more spongey.  The shoestring fries were good, they were more like really thin, long, potato chips.Overall, I came in with low expectation since I heard it wasn't mind-blowing and Salvation Burger was good but also not amazing.  I don't think I'd come again, but it was fun to experience April Bloomfield's restaurant.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Staff was friendly, but extremely slow, which I wondered if that explained the two hour wait. For instance, it took over 40 min to order our meal and another 40 min to get the check. We did mention that we are not ready yet, but then he never checked back. Perhaps we interpreted as us wanting to be left alone but thought it was a bit long. When the burger finally arrived, I was excited to try it! It was very rare (my fault; I ordered it this way). The shoestring fries were basically salty chip strings. It was so salty, it was hard to eat.After waiting two hours and having an extremely slow and not impressive meal which I literally slept through at the tail end because I was so exhausted, I was a bit disappointed.

It's got a really light creamy texture with all the right balance of sweet and savory. I'm a sucker for fries and the shoestring fries here are delicious. It's light and airy with perfectly fried rosemary bits and garlic slices to give it that zing. The famous burger is a solid choice but not quite worth the hype in my opinion especially at that price point. Overall, this place has its quirks that many reviewers have mentioned, but to take away from this place because its just too busy is a little harsh. It makes sense to be frustrated with wait times in NYC, it's just in our nature, so the real question is, is it worth the wait times? I guess you'll have to figure that out for yourself.

Seating is incredibly tight, I suggest the bar or anywhere not on the right side of the restaurant. They had to move the table for 1 person to get seated on a bench. Not comfortable. Menu is small, but I came for the burger and shoestring fries. If you are not fond of bleu cheese, the burger is not for you. It is heavy with cheese. The fries however are delicious, so thin and crispy. Food came out pretty quick.

38,LFnWmO-SdntnugRRqj2nDw,Brittany T.,4.0 star rating,"Really 3.5 stars, I was torn because it was better than A-OK but I'm not sure I'm a ""fan.""WAIT: No reservations means we got there at 5:27 hoping to get in quickly.  Although their hours don't reflect it, they dont start serving dinner until 5:30pm (but I think you can sit at the bar?) so we put our name down and they said for 2 people it would be about a 15 minute wait.  We sat outside waiting and around 5:48 pm or so they called us in.ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant is pretty large even though it looks small because there is an upstairs.  It's very eclectic and fun inside, not what I was imagining.  It does have white tablecloths and nice candles but the decor is very fun and witty.  Lots of pig related items.  There are small nooks and crannies to the restaurant which is nice.  We sat at a table where you sit next to each other and the table is in front.  It was a nice alcove. I could see you coming here for a date or with a girlfriend.FOOD: Of course we came here because we watched April Bloomfield in Mind of a Chef.  We knew the burger was good and after going to salvation burger wanted to try the original.CHICKEN LIVER TOAST - torn between this and the Gnudi, I went with this because it was half the price of the Gnudi! It comes with 2 pieces but is well enough for 2 people.  The bread they put it on is a nice rustic, crusty, fresh loaf.  It's thick too! Very good.  The pate itself was one of the best I've had...it wasn't overly ""liver"" tasting and the herb on top (I'm not sure what it was) gave it a meatball-ish taste.  My husband couldn't finish all of his because he said they really piled on the pate so it was too much for him.BURGER - got it medium rare, which is usually perfect for us but I think for here...I would get medium next time.  The medium rare was almost too rare where the burger was a little cold and the meat was mushy.  It wasn't like other burger places where the meat is a little more crumbly.  It comes with shoestring fries and is enough for 2 people to share.  The burger itself is pretty plain unlike some that we've had in the past.  It has the patty, the bun, and cheese.  The cheese tasted a little like a bleu cheese and was the most flavor we got out of the burger.  To the point where it overshadowed the meat.  The bun was forgettable, not super crisp on the outside but more spongey.  The shoestring fries were good, they were more like really thin, long, potato chips.Overall, I came in with low expectation since I heard it wasn't mind-blowing and Salvation Burger was good but also not amazing.  I don't think I'd come again, but it was fun to experience April Bloomfield's restaurant.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Staff was friendly, but extremely slow, which I wondered if that explained the two hour wait. For instance, it took over 40 min to order our meal and another 40 min to get the check. We did mention that we are not ready yet, but then he never checked back. Perhaps we interpreted as us wanting to be left alone but thought it was a bit long. When the burger finally arrived, I was excited to try it! It was very rare (my fault; I ordered it this way). The shoestring fries were basically salty chip strings. It was so salty, it was hard to eat.After waiting two hours and having an extremely slow and not impressive meal which I literally slept through at the tail end because I was so exhausted, I was a bit disappointed.

When we walked in the hostess refused to seat us at a table claiming that the kitchen was not yet open. Only when pressed did she offer high top seats near the bar at which we sat ourselves. When I asked if I could give her my phone number or if she could let us know when a table became available (there were many available at 4pm on a Saturday) she refused saying that they were only for customers ordering food (which we eventually did). We sat ourselves at the high top and had to ask for a drink menu -- a request that made a server roll his eyes for some inexplicable reason. We had two rounds of cocktails and eventually ordered oysters and French fries. The drinks and food were great. However it is baffling to me how an establishment presumably attempting to recover its reputation after a major scandal would treat its patrons so poorly. Not only was the service slow but our server also answered our questions about the food menu with attitude and nearly refused to make any recommendations. To top it all off I was told that I was drunk when I kindly informed the bartender that the light was off in the restroom in which I had just needed the flashlight on my phone to use.

Like my logic!? We went at 12 on a Monday (today)for lunch. We were the second people seated and approximately the 10th table served - burgers arrived at 12:50. I did order an app - it was actually the (balsamic)roasted beets side - so friggin good! They have a little lingering heat that was in the greens. But I was done, not done but clearly set them away from me to indicate that I was moving on, for a solid 20 mins. To their defense, the app may have caused the kitchen to delay our entrees but it was too long. We were in clear sight of multiple members of the waitstaff. My husband didn't get an app and was starving! Now let's get to why you are searching this place out on Yelp- the burger. It was really good but I didn't say, ""that was the best burger I've ever had!"".  It was very tender but the flavor was ok. I actually thought it was a little salty. I don't know if that was the burger or the cheese? I always cut my burger in 1/2 so scraped the cheese off the second 1/2 to see if that was it and still felt it was salty. The fries were ok. I do like crispy fries and they score high there but since they are super thin, there's not much potato. So it's just really too greasy tasting. This is down to preference and the size you like your fries.A good burger. A $26 burger? I say no. I've had cheaper burgers that are equally or more satisfying.

No reservations here.  This time we came on a Friday with a decent size party (6) and was told the wait was 3 hours. We waited.We went to bars like The Happiest Hour and White Horse Tavern to kill the time. We were seated pretty quickly when we came back at 11pm for our reservation. The service was just ok, nothing special. It felt like an upscale bar / pub overall. But lots of cute decor - lots of spotted piggies!We were seated upstairs in a corner section. The table ordered deviled eggs and a pot of pickles (not really pickles, but a pot of pickled vegetables) which I chose not to enjoy. My fiancé and I split the famous chargrilled burger ($26) and sheep's milk ricotta gnudi ($23).  The gnudi was AWESOME! I loved it. Basically it's giant delicious gnocchi.  Now, I did not appreciate the burger which is surprising because I am a huge fan of the simple burger. About half of our group loved it, and the others did not like it all. So that brings me to the consensus that whether you like the burger or not is extremely personal.All in all a great night with friends, though I think I've crossed this spot off my to do list and not sure I need to return.

I can't say it's not worth the price, because it is a really good burger, but the cost does certainly raise the bar for how good the burger has to be -- as does the typical long wait time to get in. Part of me would love to try other stuff here as well, but is the other stuff worth waiting an hour and a half for?

Yes, we did stay after seeing the ridiculous prices to give the benefit of the doubt. We should have listened to that doubt!! For starters we chose the ""Deviled eggs""...well....One EGG, CUT IN TWO....$5.00. Even some very posh restaurants sell Deviled EGGS, where the customer gets at least three eggs for $8.00. Moving on , My friend had the EXTREME let down called the ""Cubano"". One thinly sliced small price of ham between a two peices of baguette five inches long and indistinguishable from deli sandwich ham with a slice of plain cheese.No chips or fries but only a little arugala on the plate. $23.00!!! My burger came cooked to order but when asked if I could get any cheese besides what they offered the server said ""no substitutions are made but he could put the cheese on the side"". I asked if I could get mayonnaise and  they informed me that the ""chef strickly forbids any change to HIS choice!"" No onion, lettuce, tomato, only ketchup was offered. The price of this burger was $26.00!

I would've liked the burger a lot without cheese (or a better cheese). Beware of Roquefort!!! Service and environment: staff was extremely friendly and helpful.

The fries are more like the fried onion pieces on green beans at Thanksgiving, but potato. The place had a lot of things to look at - owl and pig figurines, Christmas lights, other people.

When my dish came out (I got the biscuit and eggs) it was well just that a biscuit and some eggs, it was barely enough to fill me and honestly the biscuit tasted like something from Mr. Pillsbury himself had thrown away. The jam that came with the biscuit was decent, but it was just so bleh. I almost wish I had complained about the dish because everything else on the menu just sounded great.

It's a very good burger, but *probably* not in my top 10 for NYC.First, know that the waits for a table, especially during weekends and weeknights, can be very long. Fortunately, you can arrive early, put your name down, and have them text you when your table is ready. I put my name down for a party of three on a Saturday at 5:15pm. They said the table would be in ready in a hour and a half; it was ready by 6:15ish. Major props to managing expectations well!The Spotted Pig is a small restaurant, but cozy and cutely decorated with figurines, paintings, and photographs of pigs. The service is friendly and prompt, and my ""Sexy Animal"" rum cocktail, while pricey ($15), was quite tasty and strong. Definitely recommend.Now to the food. We started with the sheep's milk ricotta gnudi (think pasta balls filled with cheese), which was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Seriously, *this* is the dish that should be getting the hype. The cheese was rich, and the pasta al dente, all doused in a rich brown butter sage sauce. It was like Italian mac and cheese in its highest, most sophisticated form.Next, the talk-of-the-town burger. As big a burger fan as I am, I tried to forget the hype and focus on the meal. The burger does look as amazing as it does from the pictures, and seeing that bushel of shoestring fries next to a perfectly cooked burger on a chargrilled bun does make for an Instagram-ready picture. And...the burger is quite good! The sharp Roquefort made for an ideal complement to the juicy (but somewhat under-seasoned) patty, and due to its richness, you didn't feel bad not having other toppings on the burger. And the garlic fries were also tasty, although a little hard to eat due to their thinness and curly nature. You definitely leave the meal full and satisfied.BUT...this burger is good, but not $26-level amazing. The patty's seasoning just isn't memorable enough for me to be ready and willing to pay that much. That for me is the gap between 4 and 5 stars here - the high prices and the long wait. That being said, I still had a tasty meal at Spotted Pig, and look forward to returning to try some of their other options.

Got it medium rare. Meat is juicy and patty is decently sized. However the flavor complexity wasn't up to par with the black label at minetta which still stands as number one burger for me. blue cheese somewhat overpowered the burger meat as well. Ppl at the table also not a fan of the shoestring fries as they were quite difficult to eat. Star of the dish was the HOMEMADE KETCHUP, def not heinz. Particularly loved the hint of spiciness. #Chicken liver toast: perhaps the best dish of the night, this I highly recommend. 2 large pieces of toast with heaping of chicken liver, a must try.#flowerless chocolate cake with dap of ""creme fraiche"": really decadent and an excellent end to otherwise lackluster meal. creme fraiche was necessary to cut into the thick rich choco. Forgetables: meh muscles dish, meh skate. friend was skirt steak was also only ok.  Veggie sides: the brussel sprouts were a little bit too on the bitter side and not infused with the caramelized flavor. Large chunks of bacon were good but didn't blend with the sprouts enough. ####Carrots were solid with good thyme flavor and roasted garlic and a nice char.

The burger took 40 minutes to arrive (but ok, it's the holiday season, I understand) and could be warmer when I bit into it. It was a minimalistic burger with a set of pretzel buns, a beef patty, and some cheese. A week later, now that I am writing about it, I can't even think of anything that stood out particularly, leave alone the emotions it evoked, which was non-existent. The shoestring fries were spiced with rosemary and thyme and were crispy and airy. They tasted like your regular fries with some interesting texture...the interest soon faded as I realized that I was eating another hype. Of course there was no special dipping to distract me from the supposedly deep essence of the burger and fries. Chewing on my dry fries and lukewarm burger, I wondered if everything would be different if I were more drunk and not single. Anyways, the decor was rustic and cozy. The gastropub is famous. The burger was $18 before tax - mildly impressive if you want to impress.

It should be known that I was very excited to try this restaurant after hearing its praises from celebrity chefs and those ""in-the-know.""I gave this much-hyped restaurant two stars because I would have given it three stars if the meal was half the price. We had two deviled eggs ($5ea.) for a starter, they were great!   My girlfriend was not very hungry, so she ordered the pork rilletes ($20) which was dry and unseasoned under a thick layer of lard. The accompanying pickles and mustard were to her liking, as was the crusty bread that came with it. I had to go for the famous burger.  A good burger?  Yes, but not a great burger, under-seasoned as it was, and definitely not worth the $26 price tag.  It's not even in my top 20.  The shoestring fries that complete the plate are tasty, but difficult to eat: it's weird to eat them one by one because they're so small, and hard to shove a handful of them in your mouth without getting salt all over your face.  Drinks from the bar were decent, and well executed.  There was an inch of water on the floor in the bathroom. Price for a burger, a few drinks (2 mixed and a beer) and a few apps for two with a tip: $130. I wouldn't eat the meal again for half the price, which is a shame.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

We were there right when it opened and there was no wait. I tried the burger (I had to after all of the hype!) and it was okay. Like it was a decent burger but really nothing special. I've definitely had better burgers in nicer settings (looking at you Nomad). We had the special which was braised pork cheek on toast. This is probably a better showcase of what the chefs can really do. It was very good with a perfect amount of spice, but again nothing great. For what it's worth the fries with the burger (with fresh rosemary and I believe shallots) were seriously excellent. The hit of the table. The cask ale was also good if you like cask ale.The service was personable but it was definitely a wait even though we were seated right away. It certainly was a good meal and I actually found the price point fair. It wasn't that expensive for what it was and is. However, I just didn't find almost any of the meal memorable. It could have been a dozen other restaurants in New York and if I didn't know it was the spotted pig I would have left satisfied.

115,oiEXgokoWmsZH-ViT4N0TQ,Patrick M.,3.0 star rating,"I will preface this review by stating I was excited to try The Spotted Pig. The restaurant regularly comes up in friends' lists of places to try while in New York usually couched with the statement, ""...and try the burger it is the best in NYC!"" So we lucked into showing up and being seated immediately. We started the meal with some epicurean bites (chicken liver toast, deviled eggs and devil's bareback,) which were novel and good quality. The devil's bareback is their take on sweet and savory. The bar bite is a fig stuffed with peach purée all wrapped in bacon. The fig proved a good pairing with their sazerac and set an optimistic tone for the main course. Shortly after our bar bites, the burgers arrived and they looked fantastic. Unfortunately, the excitement stopped at the appearance. The burger is good...but not great. It is good quality meat, but too lean and the burger suffers for it. The lack of a juicy flavorful patty leaves the Roquefort cheese driving the flavor profile, which, for me, is underwhelming. The redeeming element of the burger is the shoestring fries. The fries are excellent notes of rosemary and garlic are wonderful. Overall The Spotted Pig provides good food, but suffers from its own hype. Perhaps the burger was better two years ago, but I have had better burgers in the city for half the price of TSP's offering.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

We were texted just at 30 minutes and were seated upstairs in a corner spot at a very small round table for two.  This little corner of the restaurant somehow sat 12 people but we still didn't feel crowded.  Took the menu - but we were here for the burger.  Period.  Yes it is $25 and we knew that going in - but worth every penny.  We both got the burger which was on a grilled bun and smothered with Roquefort cheese.  It truly needed nothing else.  Every bit was mouthwatering and it was cooked to our request.  A heaping portion of shoe string fries with garlic and rosemary accompanied the burger and were an added bonus to the meal.  They were delicious - just hard to eat with a fork, so we used our fingers, but they broke easily and well..... as messy and hard to eat as it may have been...we did not leave one on our plate.  The glasses of wine and beer were perfect with the meal and it was enough that we did not order dessert.  This had been bookmarked for some time and knowing the prices - it was worth the wait!  I would love to save and go back again!",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

The chargrilled burger was really, really good, but I'm annoyed to have paid more than $25 on it, in a city home to Shake Shack and Burger Joint. The Spotted Pig was taken off the Michelin guide last year, which was a big deal for some people. I last visited before that (this review is a couple of months late) and we were very lucky to have standing room on the edge of a counter upstairs -- any table for our group would have taken over an hour. Shoestring potatoes are fun (do order those), we ate the entire bar menu, and we had a few beers each.

121,o8VqJdeJK6X-RU22hFcWfw,Ed U.,4.0 star rating,"Believe it or not, I tried coming to April Bloomfield's ridiculously popular West Village spot twice before and failed. On both occasions, it was after attending some Broadway musical, and knowing that they are open until 2AM, I just figured I could waltz right in around midnight and grab a bite since it is after all, a simple gastropub that doesn't accept reservations. The first time I was simply snickered at for making a futile attempt as the bar was fully packed. I had more hope the second time around since the host told me it would be just a half-hour. An hour later, I gave up and went to the nearby and aptly named Swine where drunk hipsters simply stared at me while I ate at 1:30AM (review: bit.ly/1YnEOm2). Well, it turned out the third time was a charm.This time, Jamie W. was with me, and he wisely suggested we stroll over from our SoHo hotel at around noon when they opened rather than before they closed. Smart move as we waited only fifteen minutes for the perfect table for two, while there were other couples who had to sit at a tiny counter around a brick column. While the skirt steak and skate were not available, the brunch menu is pretty robust with Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and Dutch Babies offered alongside Oysters and Pork Rilettes (photo: bit.ly/1tnMWXO). Yummy-sounding stuff even if it is standard brunch fare but mind you, rated with a Michelin star. Choices came surprisingly easy as we started with the $5 Deviled Egg with the deviled yolks were whipped to attain height with the chives sprinkled liberally (photo: bit.ly/1tnM31J).Then came the $6 Pot of Pickles, the pot turning out to be a bevy of pickled vegetables with a nicely sour edge (photo: bit.ly/1tnMl8M). Even though the portion was a bit paltry, the $16 Bibb Salad with Shaved Radish and Mustard Vinaigrette was refreshing with a nice tang (photo: bit.ly/28AMSEF). Jamie and I then diverged on our main plates. He went for the $20 Cubano Sandwich with Arugula Salad (photo: bit.ly/25UrFGU). A crusty-good, flattened bread roll was offset by the meltably good pulled pork with the lightly dressed arugula leaves providing a nice peppery flavor. I ordered their classic $25 Chargrilled Burger, which turned a half-pound mixture of brisket, sirloin, short rib and chuck into a luscious, medium-rare patty caught in a cross-hatched brioche bun topped with Roquefort cheese.The addictive aspect of this plate is the mile-high pile of shoestring fries which really requires at least two people to devour with gusto (photo: bit.ly/1VWEB9h). Satisfying as all that was, nothing quite prepared us for the $10 Seasonal Tart which was an artful delicacy with rhubarb and crème fraîche that was simply indescribable in its deliciousness (photo: bit.ly/25UpWBI). This was Bloomfield's artistry at work for sure. So congratulate me, I finally made it to The Spotted Pig and now I get why this is such a big draw among hip, young New Yorkers seeking peer approval for their dining choices. I've learned my lesson in not looking for a table at the midnight hour unless I'm really drunk or very patient. Trust me I'd be more likely the former than the latter.FOOD - 4 stars...Bloomfield's talents are in full force on the tart, the other items amount to solid pub grubAMBIANCE - 4 stars...a bit crowded but great people-watchingSERVICE - 3.5 stars...attentive enough even if there was a tinge of been-there-done-that in their approachTOTAL - 4 stars...third time's the charm and it was worth the effort...do Jay Z, Bono and Mario Batali really co-own this place? wonder what the management meetings are like",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I, too, had heard of this burger and I was ready to try it. We got there at 6pm on a Thursday so we were seated immediately, even though the table was less of a normal restaurant table and more of a square piece of driftwood shoved in between a pillar and what was probably the original exit for the restaurant? Either way, it was dark as hell, cramped and all three stools at this table just felt in the way for every other real table around us. OK, fine, ambiance, got it. The restaurant itself is cute, the servers are all friendly and I like that there are just hooks -everywhere- around this place for your shit. It's actually kind of great. Though in winter the downside is that it starts to feel like you're eating in a coat closet because you're literally surrounded by everybody's shit.Our burgers get served and they sure do look purdy- those shoe string fries are piled up like a mountain, and the buns have those perfect grill marks and it all looks like you're about to eat a magazine. Then the problems start.... First problem - The burger tastes disgusting. Like, I don't know, first bite you're like ""woah, okay"" and then second bite you're like ""is this just salt? Is this a gallon of salt?"" and then third bite you're like ""fuhhhk I gotta finish this shit because I paid too much for it.""Second problem - Those fries are great but they're impossible to eat. How do you eat these damn fries?? You can't pick them up because they're so thin and go everywhere and my mouth isn't big enough to just shove an unruly bundle of potato sticks in there. Like, unless you eat them one by one, you can't pick them up. So I tried with a fork which was strangely easier, but still hard. I gave up half way through because I was already out-salted by that horrible burger so I couldn't handle more fries even though they were 10x better tastingThird problem - It's so goddamn dark it was impossible to see what I was eating... I asked for chef's choice on how the burger was cooked and they said that was medium-rare. Ok, sounds good. But even in the darkness I could tell this was more 'rare' than 'medium' which just became a texture turn off, eating some wet ball of salt in the dark. (This also makes me wonder if this was related to my fifth problem coming up...)Fourth problem - Considering how damn salty this dish is, it's a bummer that the water carafe no longer fits on the tiny-ass table once your actual meal is served.Fifth problem - Look, I'm not saying that I woke up at 4am and threw up this burger but ............ I woke up at 4am and threw up this burger. I don't know what caused it, maybe it was the two beers I had later that night, maybe it was the way the moonlight reflected off of the ocean, maybe it was a huge pit of grease and salt that was STILL SITTING IN MY STOMACH 10 hours later and my body was like ok screw this thing and ordered me to deposit $25 into my toilet the wrong way.I was like ok with the concept of paying $25 for a burger that you get to eat on a stool in a dark and crowded coat closet, but I was not prepared for the disgusting saltiness of that thing. I don't know what happened here, maybe this place was great a couple years ago or something, maybe they had an off night, maybe -I- had an off night...

I'm so glad that I did!Even on a random Thursday, this place was pretty busy, about an hour long wait, but that gave me a chance to walk around and explore the neighborhood and chat with folks while I waited for a seat.I don't generally go out and eat solo, so I wasn't sure how they would respond with me taking up a table, but the service was terrific. They were friendly, helpful, and very polite throughout the entire meal.I started with the olives, they were good, but nothing special, just three or four different types. The real treat began with the ricotta gnudi. They were just a touch chewy on the outside with a delicious creamy inside. They were bathed in a white sauce and topped with just a bit of bitter pesto. When you had a bite with all the flavors, including the walnuts, it was divine.For my entree I decided on their steak. It came out perfectly medium rare with charred onions, broccoli rabe, and topped with a romesco sauce. The meat was easy to slice, flavor and when combined with the smoky flavor of the onions or broccoli was absolutely terrific. I tend to have steaks out when I can, since I don't cook them at home too frequently and this was one of the best ones I've had in a very long time. The flavors were always perfectly balanced so each bite was an utter joy.I decided to splurge and have dessert, and went with their flourless chocolate cake. This was the richest, most decadent chocolate cake I've ever had. It tasted like the just melted down the darkest chocolate that you can find and reshaped it into a softer block of delicious chocolate goodness. It was paired with a very sour creme fraiche that was great to help cut through the denseness of the cake. Paired with an Averna, this was a pure delight, one that I probably didn't need to finish, but I did because it was so tasty.The other items looked good, most tables had the burger which made me a little envious until my steak arrived.

On a freezing Thurs evening our group of six still ended up waiting over an hour for a table, even putting our name down at 6pm. We decided to post up near the bar downstairs and have some drinks. Wine per glass was a bit pricey ($14). We got sat upstairs and crammed/ cozied up to one another while hunching over on low stools, not the most comfortable. We ordered a round of burgers, some deviled eggs, almonds, Brussels sprouts and stracciatella. I think the burger was my least favorite thing we got, and that's why we came! The quality of the burger patty was excellent, full of juicy flavor, but I found the Roquefort to be aggressive and combined with the bun made the burger dry. Definitely had to add a heavy layer of the delicious house Dijon mustard to burger. The shoe string fries frustrated me, I've never felt more like a human shovel then trying to eat those things.

The management staff are great, the host staff are great, the bar staff are great, the runners are great, the servers & back waiters are great. The kitchen is SHOCKING. At a table for two which could barely hold a single entree plate and two bread plates once all our glasses and wine bottle were on it, they actually tried to serve us three dishes simultaneously! They took away our table water (and then never filled the glasses again), and we put the wine on the floor (which the hipster jackasses eating cheeseburgers at the table next to us kept nearly kicking over) to make room for the second one, but we insisted they take the third one away. Near as we can tell, this crashed the kitchen; by the time we left the couple on the other side of us had been waiting 20 minutes for their second course. So much for whomever expedites the kitchen. The food was completely mediocre. Four courses: The gnudi were harshly over-seasoned and otherwise unremarkable in every way. The skate was somehow both overcooked and seemed raw at the same time. It had no color, no texture, was also over seasoned and the sauce and garnish were bland. It was a huge plate of white, gummy salt. The squid on toast was completely under seasoned. The toast had been allowed to go soggy. The pork cheek, when we finally got it, was a joke. Unmistakable from short ribs (by which I mean beef) and swimming in a pool of runny grits which were supposed to be polenta. If Chef April has not checked in on this kitchen recently, she should.

Well, the limited menu selection -- approximately 3/4 menu unavailable -- that Saturday afternoon at 3:45 pm and the hefty wine by the glass prices made it difficult to give it a full 5 stars. But why dwell on the negative, right? Right! Let's talk about the positives.The burger, corn soup, and salad were all excellent, as was the service, which was attentive, friendly, and professional. As a former hospitality professional of 20 yrs., good service can make up for many failings, including a depleted menu. Besides the aforementioned pluses, a BIG plus goes to the entire staff who made us -- 4 adults and a 3 yr. old --feel welcomed. Far too often establishments that have achieved such acclaim are unwelcoming to guests with small children.

The bun is grilled nicely for some crisp while the inside has some melted cheese and juicy beef. The shoe string fries are good, a little thin, but good.

The night began with my boyfriend and myself knowing that they didn't take reservations, so we went to put our name in before heading over to Employees Only for a few drinks while we waited. The hostess told us it was a 2 hour wait, and that was fine with us considering it was a Saturday night and we arrived at 7:45. Fast forward 2 hours- we went back to the Spotted Pig to check on our reservation, as it had been 2 hours and at this point was quarter of 10:00 and we were starving. The hostess proceeded to tell us it was going to be another 40 minutes for a table for two people!!! We had already waited this long but is any food (particularly ""fancy"" bar food) really worth a 3 hour wait?! So we proceeded to the upstairs bar to kill more time where we ordered bar snacks ( FYI- the deviled eggs is literally one whole egg. $5 for one whole egg.... not sure why this offended me in the dining world of NYC but it did...)The best part of the story next- we were finally seated after a 2 hr 20 min wait and we put in an order for our food. We ordered the Shisito peppers to start, which is the only reason I'm even giving this place one star because they were good. My boyfriend and I put in our order right away and each got the burger ($26), as that's what this place is known for. We then proceeded to have a front seat view of watching our waitress catching up with what looked to be a friend for 30 mins while we still didn't have our dinner and at this point it's 11:00 at night. I had to get a girl who was bussing tables to get our waitress's attention to tend to us and tell us where the heck our dinner was. Finally after getting her attention and asking, she comes out with our food, that was ~obviously~ sitting in the kitchen ready to be brought out. As for this ""epic burger,"" save your $26 each and go to McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's.... you catch my drift. Simply a beef patty with blue cheese, nothing else and so extremely disappointing. By this point, you can tell that my boyfriend and I would never go back to this place that has supposedly won a Michelin Star for the past 9 years. The worst service I have ever experienced in any restaurant, even more so one that charges $5 for an egg and $26 for a hamburger. Save your money and do not ever go to this place.

144,GTqFigJMVKddDRC5uImkSg,Millie S.,5.0 star rating,"The Spotted Pig is tucked into a quiet corner at 11th and Greenwich, so covered on the outside with greenery and flourishing plant tendrils and upward-creeping vines that you might inadvertently pass it on the first go. Walking in, you get the oddest sensation of having entered an uncanny mix between your fusty grandmother's house and a proper English pub. The curtains and stool coverings can't quite decide if said grandmother misplaced them or if they're just 'vintage'. There seem to be all sorts of ovine, bovine, and porcine paintings, drawings, and plates hung ever-so-slightly carelessly on the walls in whatever spaces will fit them. Plants, both real and illustrated, cover the rest. All of it is charming. It's cozy and smaller than expected, and certainly different than expected. For years, I'd envisioned The Spotted Pig as a stereotypically dimly-lit tavern-esque deal. And, well, maybe it actually is, at night. But I stopped by at 3pm when the windows still let in the afternoon light, and the first floor somehow made me feel as cool and hip (and ok, slightly kitschy) as stepping into any of today's trendy Australian cafes does. As for the food? I started off with the chicken liver toast, which it turned out to be incredibly delicious, if also incredibly salty. I'm not usually much one for offal, but the liver was creamy, not overpoweringly rich, and paired perfectly with the crisp toast - add a squeeze of lemon and a dab of Dijon, a passing waiter told me with a wink. He was correct (listen to your waiters, I've long learned). If only it were less salty! I ate my two toasts, then gulped down a full glass of water.Finally, the long-awaited burger and the infamous heaping pile of shoestring fries. I didn't even get a proper picture because I was so eager to try it right away, and it was easily the best burger I've ever had. Thick, juicy beef. Creamy, melty, stinky, salty Roquefort dripping down the sides. Fluffy yet sturdy grilled brioche holding it all together. And that's it. Just meat, cheese, and bread; no need for lettuce or tomato or anything else, because it simply didn't need anything else. The patty didn't do the dreaded backslide (you know, where it slips out the back of the bun until you have a burger mullet - all bread and business in the front, beef party in the back) until the very end. It was almost too salty as well, but a small swipe in the Dijon from earlier remedied that quite nicely.I wasn't sure how exactly to eat my leaning tower of rosemary garlic fries - they really put 'string' in shoestring fries, and you feel a bit silly eating them by hand (imagine eating a salad by hand, it's the same floppiness level), and I didn't want to be that person looking clueless over how to eat a plate of fries - so I used a fork. My hat goes off to the person in the kitchen in charge of julienning the potatoes.

We arrived around 7:00pm on a Friday and were quoted 2 hours. We sat down at 10:15. We're good at passing time and actually had quite a ""night"" or whatever you want to call it when you go barhopping at that hour.I really wish they had a texting system where you give you phone number and they let you know when you're table is ready because we had to keep checking in which was fairly annoying. Finally, however, our number was called (not literally, of course) and we snagged a table along the window.I'd describe the ambiance as intimate and charming. There's an old school feel to the place and it's definitely a bit tight...not ideal for private conversations or first dates.It took a while for our waiter to come take our order, though this was no problem because we were well-prepared as we'd been studying the menu all week. First up was the deviled eggs. The whites were perfectly boiled and the yolk-stuff was perfectly creamy - a great consistency and great flavor.I'm sure you want to know about the burger, though. It's served with Roquefort cheese (which is a type of blue cheese) and that's very important to know. Personally, I hate blue cheese. However, I also absolutely insist on enjoying famous dishes the way they were intended to be enjoyed. I will say that the patty and the bun were both marvelous. Though I didn't enjoy the cheese, I can confidently say that anyone who DOES enjoy blue cheese, or even just doesn't hate it, will thoroughly enjoy this burger. I think it is well worth the wait. They aren't stingy with the shoestring fries either, which are nothing short of delightful. Peppered with rosemary and garlic, they're crunchy and just perfect.As long as you're prepared to wait and know what you're getting yourself into, this is a stop worth making.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I do not normally write reviews as I am writing a book about my quest and it'll contain my reviews in detail BUT I am making an exception here and I'll make it short. I have not seen a more overhyped burger place like this since Shake Shack at its rise. While Shake Shack earned that hype for a while, this place did not. I have been planning to visit since 2010 and I finally did today. I've tried burgers from 1$ to 50$. For a 26$ burger, I expect that burger to be made of a holy cow, the taste of which is unrivaled by the likes of other cows. I expect the burger to call my name. Instead, I got a burger that Wendy's burger (which I had for 2$ with tax) was far better. Although I must be fair to the chef for cooking the burger to medium in a perfect manner. Hence, the second star. Will I ever be back again? Absolutely not.

Later we found out they charged us $14 for two bottles of flat water, which at no point did they mention they would be doing.  We ordered a side of olives and received a small handful for $8. The entrée choices on the menu were small. Both me and my dinner date ordered the hamburger with the shoestring fries because it seemed like the only reasonable thing to order. Despite the hype, there was nothing fantastic about it.  There was some garlic in the fries, and interesting grill marks on the bun, but that's it.  However for $26 a plate it was not worth it, and I hate to say it, I have had better at fast food restaurants.  In total, our bill was $90 for two hamburgers, a fistful of olives, water, and backache from uncomfortable seating.

There's isn't a lot of toppings, or even ingredients it seems like, but the meat is cooked in such a superior manner, this is all that's needed. Furthermore, the amount of fries given are so generous that their is practically a haystack of rosemary and garlic fries atop your already ample sized plate.

They don't take reservations, but if you come early or after 10pm there should be no wait. Food is quite delicious and the service is great too! My favorite item on the menu is the steak with kale and mushrooms. It's just so tasty and cooked just right! Their deviled eggs, oysters and the chowder are also really great, especially the chowder. Cocktails here are also divine...I really liked the Battle of Marciano. Oh yeah, and their seasonal desserts are great! If you saved room definitely try the flourless chocolate cake!! I've been here a few times and prefer the upstairs to the downstairs. The ambiance is that of your eccentric uncle's house who collects pig-related items and antiques. Really cute and inviting.

The wait can be interminable but they will text you when your table is ready so, do not be deterred. We went for the burger. We ended up ordering much more - chicken liver toast ($9) and roasted almonds ($4).The chicken liver toast ($9) with two slices is enough for four. Two thick slices of baguette arrive grilled with a slurry of chicken liver spread across the bread. The bread gives that burned, crusty taste while the chicken liver is buttery, rich and thick. Get two orders. The Cubano ($19) is mediocre - do not order it. A thin layer of meat which is dry and mealy is sandwiched between two hard pressed pieces of baguette. The cheese is almost absent. The whole sandwich is dry and lacking in any fat - mayonnaise, grease from the grill, butter? Please?The chargrilled burger ($22) is overpriced for what it is. The beef is delicious: rich, fatty, hearty and tender. Albeit, somewhat gristly - see photo of chunks on plate. I am sure it is a complex blend of beef but it isn't as juicy as it should be for $22. Check the photo - the juices of a halved burger were not nearly ""flowing.""Cooked to the requested medium rare, the roquefort cheese is overpowering. An american or cheddar or gruyere would be more amenable to the meat underneath. Anything would be better. I suppose that it's my personal preference to never have blue cheese on a burger - I think the stinky element of most blue cheeses overwhelms the rich, fatty beef in almost all burgers. A gorgonzola is a slightly milder option which I think would work well here.The bun is a large, egg coated brioche bun that is grilled but again, lacks any fat.Fries with rosemary shoestring are excellent. They are crispy and well salted. String cut. Soaked in water overnight? Almost certainly. The service professional and quick. The drinks are delicious. The atmosphere is hopping but subdued at the same time. Two levels of worn and grooved, wide plank floors await. Enjoy.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

We were really keen on trying it because my boyfriend thought the burger looked good. Plus, this is one of the most affordable Michelin-starred restaurants in NYC. It's understandable why Spotted Pig is notorious for having a really long wait. We were lucky enough to think ahead and arrived at about 4 PM for a ""late lunch."" There is a late lunch menu, which is the same are the regular lunch/brunch menu except there are asterisks by the items you're allowed to order. This menu was very limited but still included the burger my boyfriend wanted, so we went for it. There was no wait at all when we arrived, even though it was already pretty full. We were seated upstairs at a table that was so close to the other tables that it felt like communal seating. The waiter dropped by a grand total of two times: once to take our orders and once to bring our check. We had to wait a loooong period of time between receiving waters (which we waited for for several minutes before we were even acknowledged), taking orders, receiving food, getting the check, and waiting for them to actually pick up our credit card. Service was cordial and not by any means rude, but inattentive. My boyfriend ultimately said the burger was good, but he was a little underwhelmed by the fries and was disappointed by the $25 price tag. They definitely inflate prices here because of the Michelin star and unexplained popularity. They can get away with it. I wish we had made it in time for the brunch menu because it looked a lot more intriguing and promising than the limited late afternoon menu. There's a lot of great food to eat in NYC, so this won't make our list for future visits.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

The complete experience (super sweet and attentive waiter) is really deserving of 5 stars but the overall food seemed to be quite mediocre...  For the appetizers we ordered the Devils on Horseback and the Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi. The ricotta felt a little too heavy and kind of like I was eating a straight cheese ball. I was much a bigger fan of the devils on Horseback, it was an explosion of various tastes/flavors with each bite - juicy and rich with flavor from the bacon but sweet and potent taste from the pear. For my entree, I opted for the special - pot roast baby chicken. The chicken itself was super tender and just melted in your mouth, the definition of how pot roast should be cooked. I wasn't a huge fan of having to navigate all the tiny bones that accompanied the baby chicken... It was also swimming in vinegar which had a tendency to splash and make a little bit of a mess. My sister did go with the burger so I had the opportunity to try the burger and shoe string fries. The burger was superb but not amazing in comparison to the most recent burger I've eaten at Whitman's - I'd definitely give the nod to the Whitman's burger.

I had to dump ketchup on the fries and used my fork for this finger food. Only upside is the fries were very crispy and flavor was enhanced by the simple herb: rosemary. Not impressed at all.Also had order the crispy pigs ear salad and ricotta filled pasta dumplings. Crispy pigs ear salad was mediocre. One cartridge ear, battered, and deep fried. Very oily. The ricotta filled pasta dumplings were the best. Deliciously covered with a pesto sauce. However, the price is very steep for just 7 dumplings ($20).

The blue cheese is strong though and towards the last few bites it does become monotonous. I really love the taste of the meat and how it pairs with the blue cheese for the most part though. Additionally, the sides of spicy mustard give the burger a nice pop or can be a good pairing with the shoestring fries. The environment is really trendy and very interesting because it is compact and always full and vibrant. I think the fries are delicious and are a great compliment to the burger! Despite the crowdedness the ambiance is very unique and makes for a great overall experience to enjoy some very tasty food. The menu has some amazing food choices for both dessert and dinner options that make the place very enticing. Despite a very high price point for a lot of things on the menu, it is worth the experience if you can afford to shell out more cash than usual for a nice meal.

I mean this was a table for two that they turned into a table for three. Plus you are seated on short squat stools instead of chairs. Cramped and uncomfortable to say the least. I did love the decor, though, and every piece in this restaurant seems to fit perfectly into the dark, cozy pub theme.For food, we started with the deviled egg, marinated olives and devils on horseback (bacon wrapped date). The olives were nice and the egg was very tasty (drizzled in olive oil, herbs and salt), but I did not love the dates. They simply weren't sweet at all and seemed to lack flavor. Next came the goat cheese gnudi and the burger. I have been hearing about these gnudi for YEARS and I just wish I had managed to get them when they came served in the butter sage sauce. They are now being served in pesto and I really felt the salty taste of the pesto overpowered the soft, airy goat cheese. The texture was unbelievable, however, and superb.

For a cramped Gastropub I would not expect such an attentive, patient, and well trained waiter. This young man even folded napkins when one left their seat! Wonderful! I first got the pig ear salad - which I highly recommend! The pig ears are quite fatty, so there are small lemon pieces in the salad to cut through the fat. When you composed a perfect bite of the appropriate lemon, bitter green, and fatty pig ear - it was quite the experience! Thankfully, the individual components were delicious as well - which is very important. Everything was very fresh and I assume local. I also tried that famed burger. I ate half of it, which was quite a feat as it is very rich. If you eat the burger patty on its own you realize it has the potential to be the 'best burger ever' - but as it comes out, unfortunately, I wasn't super impressed with it. Firstly, I think the intense crunchy and salty flavor of the fries make the paired burger almost seem lacking... As I ate I kept wondering, what does this need? It needs something! I thought, well, blue cheese is not my favorite, perhaps if it was cheddar? No, it needs some other texture or flavor... THEN, without warning, my dinner partner slapped his bun on the fries and pulled up a layer of them to enjoy ON his burger! BURGER-ELEVATED! So, if you are not super impressed by the burger, put your fries on it - it's delicious! (sorry, chef!)

The restaurant is really cute, has a nice sized upstairs which seats a lot of customers for a West Village restaurant. The place has a very home-like feel where everyone is seated close together, but I didn't feel cramped.What we ordered: 2 Chargrilled Burgers w/ Roquefort Cheese1 Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi w/ Pesto1 Plate of Market VeggiesThe gnudi was fantastic, and had an amazing smooth, creamy ricotta filling. The veggies were also delicious, perfectly seasoned and cooked. There was a unique selection on the plate, but to be honest it was all mixed together so at times I didn't know what I was eating. It was all devoured. And lastly, my reason for coming here: the burger. It was cooked medium rare, which is fine with me, but it wasn't melt in my mouth amazing, or anything special. Maybe it was the Roquefort cheese, which is not my favorite. I also wasn't a fan of the ""shoestring fries"" which my friends and I all compared to potato stix.

I'd been watching her in the series of Mind of a Chef and was dying to visit the spotted pig when I came to NY. However...this place let me down. I think that everything that we had was a bit one-noted. Very muted in terms of flavour profile. Although we did not have anything that wasn't palatable...I can't find a reason to want to revisit considering the price tag. Gnudi (4/5)Most impressive thing on the menu. And as promised ""fluffy pillows of delight""...but not after the first 3. This is something you have to share as it is super rich and creamy despite being pillowy in texture. Pigs Ear Salad (3 out of 5)It was crispy the pigs ear (as you would want it to be) and the dressing was tart which helped cut through the greasy ears. It was served with raddichio, frisee and other greens that were bitter to counter the acidity and the grease. Although balanced, I did not really care for it.Chowder (3 out of 5)The homemade crackers were a nice touch but I guess with the price of the chowder I expected to be blown away. The chowder was peppery, creamy and...a lot like how I could have made it at home.Chicken Liver Toast (3 out of 5)Ok, a lot of people here sayin' that the chicken liver toast was good even if you don't like liver. LIES. I don't like liver, but I can occasionally appreciate a good pate but after the first few bites, I was a bit overwhelmed by how liver-y it was.

Unfortunately a pint was $10, which is quite expensive for beer. I'm also not a huge fan of the setting here.

Because it was so hot outside, we were able to be seated right away with no wait even though it was the weekend.For our meal, we started with the pickle plate and then got an order of the Bibb salad and the famous burger.The pickle plate was nothing special--a good variety of veggies, but definitely on the lower end of pickled veggie plates that I've ordered.The Bibb salad was also just alright, but lacked excitement and just seemed sort of plain--and at $17, was a bit of an overcharge.We had high expectations for the $25 burger, and while the fries were very good, we felt that the burger did not even come close to living up to the hype. It was cooked well, but just lacked any sort of flavor that I could tell. Even the cheese did not add much to the overall dish. I am a burger snob for sure, but this has got to be one of the most underwhelming burgers I have ever add--especially considering the high price tag.Overall, the service here was spotty and I wasn't a huge fan of the backless chairs, but I guess that's their schtick.

226,C7FmAMSIsn0006w6gCh1MA,Jaci H.,4.0 star rating,"As a New Yorker, I'm ashamed to say it took me all this time to stop by and check out their famed burger. My husband and I were in the area and figured ""why not?"" It was a steaming hot Sunday and we arrived around 6pm. They open at 5:30, so we figured there would be a long wait but we weren't that hungry yet. The spot is cute - a lot more casual than I anticipated. I would have passed by had we not noticed the little pig sign hanging outside. The hostess was nice and asked for a name and phone number explaining that we'd receive a text when a table became available within the next hour or so. An hour wait wasn't a huge deal for us, but then noticed a bunch of people left the bar to head to their table. SCORE! We ended up just sitting at the bar and hanging out with the really awesome bartender. We drank a few beers before even placing our order. It was very chill, we had AC and cold beers - exactly what we needed. We shared the crispy pig ear salad, which was recommended to us. Neither of us had ever ventured into pig ear territory. It was battered and deep fried and reminded me of bacon in flavor. It was strange but I thought it was really tasty and lends itself well to the salad that was very tart from a lemon, caper vinaigrette. Definitely worth a shot if you want to try something different. My husband didn't like the texture of the pig's ear so it was mine, all mine! We saw everyone ordering the burger and realized it was larger than we anticipated, so we shared this. We ordered one with the Roquefort cheese on the side and cooked medium. It arrived about 20 minutes after our salad, which was a little long but expected due to the crowds. (This place is always crowded). It arrived perfectly cooked with a little dish of Roquefort on the side and a giant pile of shoestring french fries. The burger was delicious with a little ketchup and mustard. I honestly should have just ordered one myself and felt like a total glutton. My husband was glad the cheese was on the side since it was too strong to taste any of the good quality meat. It just overpowered the burger, so he had to scrape it off. The fries, although tasty, are a pain in the ass to eat. It's a terrible waste since most people end up ignoring them because they're so tiny and crispy that you can't pick them up and dip them in ketchup. You can dab your fork in ketchup and then stab your fork to get a nice bite, but it was just super annoying. We did eat them all, but we think these fries are a total fail. Next time I'll ask if we can switch the side cause I wouldn't want to deal with them again.Overall, it was a really yummy dinner and we didn't really have to wait to be seated. My advice to people looking to go, is arrive early and be patient. Sit at the bar and chat w/ the bartender! Everyone waits for a table, so expect at least 60 minutes at a minimum. If you have that expectation you're not going to be pissed off when you find this out in person. Also, it isn't a huge spot, so come with a smaller group for a better chance to grab a table.

I also saw the few comments that mentioned the food was salty which I chose to overlook The staff was nice and the place has character but the booths were dirty and my seat was sticky. We ordered the burger and a side of broccoli rabe to share. We were planning getting dessert here and wanted to make sure we had room for it. I don't mind ""stinky"" strong cheeses but the cheese on the burger overwhelmed my senses that I couldn't taste the meat of my burger. Both my friend and I scraped off the cheese. Even after getting rid of most of the cheese, the saltiness of the cheese still dominated every bite. The broccoli rabe didn't help mitigate the saltiness. The veggie was also loaded with salt. If I rinsed my broccoli rabe my soaking it into my glass of water, there would still be a sufficient amount of salt but probably just the right amount afterward. In the end, our sub par experience deterred us from ordering dessert here. We ended up waking a few blocks to Magnolia for dessert.

Basically all I could focus on was the dry grit in my mouth. The fries included with the burger were equally disappointing.  They were physically a chore to eat due to their cut(Though it was somewhat fun watching other patrons trying to eat them without looking goofy,) and they primarily tasted like Rosemary.  Where I find Rosemary an excellent complimentary herb, I don't want it to be the sole flavor I taste.

It is a small restaurant with small tables which adds to the ""we are all friends atmosphere."" The menu is small but delicious. My husband and I shared the stracciatella cheese appetizer, which is similar to burrata but pulled so it is more stringy. It came on toasts with fried mushrooms. It was amazing! There were not many vegetarian options beyond getting all sides on the menu so I settles on the ricotta gnudi. It was very good but VERY rich. I had a really hard time finishing it all. In fact I couldn't. My husband had to help me. He was not upset about that at all. My husband got the famous Spotted Pig burger and LOVED IT. I tried some of his shoe string fries and they were great; crispy, flavored with salt and rosemary and fried onions as well. Delicious! We didn't try any desserts.The food is good, but expensive.

Luckily there was only a half hour wait (walked to Big Gay for ice cream in the meantime, ohhh yeah) and were seated in the lower level. I loved the decor of this restaurant. Somehow it's filled to the brim with an eclectic hodge podge of pictures and knick knacks without feeling too stuffy or crowded. It's a very cozy corner location.We sat near the kitchen whereupon I witnessed what seemed like thousands of the Roquefort burgers being churned out one after the other. Of course we also ordered the burgers and then waited for a looong time. The service was poor. During the entire stay we had four different servers and everything took an unusually long time. Drinks took over a half hour, dinner over an hour, and then we sat for another 45 minutes waiting for the bill. The food itself was underwhelming. The best part was the fries, but like mentioned previously, they're so hard to eat! The flavor is there, especially with roasted bits of garlic throughout (be sure you like rosemary if you order these though), but the stack of shoestring fries was impossible to eat. You really have to have the pinch, head tilt, and drop into the mouth technique perfected. It was pretty annoying. I REALLY wanted to love the burger. I ordered mine medium-well and it came out practically rare. The place was so dark, which in and of itself I don't mind, but I couldn't even see exactly how rare it was until I brought half of it home. The Roquefort cheese was okay, but there was too much of it. It just wasn't a good balance and while the burger does come with a sauce on the side, it just needs more. Something to balance the salt and add texture. For all the hype this place generates, and for the price, it was a significant letdown.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"
244,htP0OJcySxNex2YOurTh9g,Richard L.,4.0 star rating,My friends and i showed up after they lost a bet to pay for my food.  So we decided on The Spotted Pig for brunch since we've heard great reviews.So for brunch the brunch drinks (while a bit expensive) were really good.  I had the bourbon ice tea and that was awesome!  Cynthia had the all important brunch Bloody Mary and she said it was very good but at $15 a pop it was on the pretty high side of things.So for brunch i had the sizzling sisig with jalapenos and egg - and this was pretty fantastic.  Sisig is a philipino dish of pork jowel (a fatty pork cheek) cooked somehow with all this amazing flavor! Since that's the only thing i had that's all i can comment on.  next time i'll be back for April Bloomfield's burger.  It's something i've heard way too much about.,The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I never understand when a restaurant says ""no,"" particularly when its about something simple. That just defeats the purpose of eating out in my opinion. So they sat us elsewhere. When another table opened up that looked more convenient for us, we asked to be seated there, but then the waiters started making rumblings with each other so I just said to forget it if they were going to make a big stink about it. Also, they don't carry mayo or anything similar, which is beyond my understanding. It must be me though. The burger was pretty good but overpriced. The waiter was a bit snooty.

Apparently he's been raving about it and telling folks to meet him there for a burger. Now, I've only been here once but I believe it is the start of something really special. There's a lot of buzz around this place so I know it can get crowded. However, we came on a Friday around 3pm (just past the lunch crowd and before the dinner rush) and we got a table with no problem. It was late March but i it was a blizzard outside so coming into that particular space was very welcome. It's so so very cozy in there. In New York cozy sometimes means small but I mean it in the traditional sense: ""giving a feeling of comfort, warmth, and relaxation."" We sat upstairs in a booth type thing and watched the snow fall outside. Lovely! The inside is quaint little mishmash of an English cottage, lots of tiny stools, lots of My fiance and I were pretty hungry so we ordered a couple of appetizers and a burger each off the lunch menu. In retrospect we probably could have split a burger (HUGE portion) and been totally fine but c'est la vie. To start we had the deviled eggs and the roasted almonds. I thought the almonds might be a little boring but they were fantastic. They had a bit of a kick but nothing this weakling couldn't handle. The deviled eggs were also good but not all that memorable in the long run. But the burger? Yeah, that burger. We both ordered it as recommended (medium rare) and it was delicious. So huge and a bit hard to eat but power through, friends. You've earned it. Topped with roquefort cheese it's got just the right amount of funky tang to it and the shoestring fry mountain served with it is awesome. Now, I love a shoestring fry so these really got my motor running. Loved the rosemary thrown in and those bits of crunchy fried garlic were a real humdinger! So yes, Kanye.

I remember the place to be very crowded when I used to live in the city (maybe 2 years ago) but found it to be much more quiet and calm during my last visit.

I know some people believe the Spotted Pig is past its prime, however they still make one of the greatest Whiskey Sour in NYC, and personally I still love this venue.

It's one of those places that I know regardless of its review (which was 3.5 when I looked it up last week) will still have at least a 1 hour wait for brunch on the weekends and some people will mindlessly love it just because.I didn't know any better at the time, and perhaps I have not been disappointed like this in a while, so I have forgotten, but I really wish I had done a bit more research before ordering blindly here expecting everything to be wonderful. I can be an optimist like that sometimes.Let's start with the good. Out of the 4 things that my friend and I ordered, only the liver toast really stood out. Fresh, chunky pieces of liver, seasoned well, on top of a crusty piece of toasted bread with fragrant, crisp parsley on top? Yes, please. This alone would probably have skyrocketed this review to 5 stars for me.Unfortunately, we were pretty hungry after waiting about 45 minutes (I have to admit, this is a short wait for a Saturday, and they text you when your table is ready so you can go for a nice walk, and the hostess was so warm and nice that when I first walked in I thought maybe I was in California, and not New York City. So not all is lost but this review is really for the food) so we decided to also share the Burger with the shoestring fries and the poached eggs over the pork cheek hash. It is with great sadness that I report that neither of those dishes knocked my socks off. The burger was under seasoned and depended way too much on its thin layer of roquefort for flavor. The shoestring fries, although cute in concept, were tedious to eat, requiring all hands ( literally ) on deck. Each time I tried to dunk them in ketchup, they would break off and drown, leaving me to save it with my fork. What's the point?The pork cheek hash, which was my choice, was so unflavorful, so unremarkable in its combination of textures, that I actually felt a bit embarrassed to bring it up to my friend, hoping she wouldn't notice.

The burgers were absolutely delicious, but my favorite were the lobster rolls. It was not too heavy on the mayonnaise, and with cucumbers and dill provided just the right amount of refreshing to an otherwise heavy-ish dish. I wasn't a huge fan of the scallops, which didn't taste like scallops in the first place. However, the quality was still there so it's more of a personal preference.

The evening even started on an auspicious note when we found a parking spot right in front of the restaurant. We had an hour plus wait, but it wasn't a big deal because we just went around the corner to have some drinks at the venerable White Horse Tavern. We ended up being sat upstairs in a cramped corner, which is fine, it's NYC, but we were right under the radiator and it was uncomfortably warm. For a place with the word ""pig"" in the title, they offered very few items with it on the menu. We ended up getting the market salad, the bass, and a pork belly special. (We had decided not to order the burger because, c'mon, we live in Texas.)The salad ended up being the best dish of the night: super fresh with a great variety of greens, a bright dressing, an ample amount of cheese, and the ideal amount of pomegranates not to make it too sweet. Perfection. The bass was not well-salted, but when we got some salt on it, was somewhat better. The pork belly was the biggest disappointment of the night, which was not soft enough and had little to no flavor. Its side of polenta had some bizarre reduced tomato situation on it that tasted like tomato paste. It was shockingly bad. For dessert, we had the ""bananofee."" It was just OK. Drinks were fine: we enjoyed the spotted pig bitter and the mulled wine, but the stupidly named ""sexy animal"" wasn't that great. Service left a lot to be desired. Our waiter was attentive when he was present, but he was also missing for large swathes of the evening (i.e. It took over 20 minutes for someone to clear our dinner plates).

They don't take reservations so be ready for a certain wait depending on when you get there. Our meal consisted of the favorites that everyone else raves about: deviled eggs, sheep's milk gnudi, chicken liver toast, and the famous burger. Deviled Eggs: simply incredible. You get 2 for 4$ and definitely the best deviled eggs I've had. Beautifully creamy without the overwhelming taste of mayonaise that most deviled eggs come with. Sheep's Milk Gnudi: this is basically gnocchi filled with ricotta instead of potato. Usually a 20$ entree but got a plate to share. You get 7 gnudis on the dish and each one is amazing. Amazingly creamy with a great herb flavor from the sage. The sauce is so good you'll want to lick the bowl after you finish the gnudi! Not filling enough for one entree, but great as a sharing dish. Chicken Liver Toast: you get 2 pieces of toast for 10$. The toast is very sturdy with the chicken liver paste smeared all over it. I'm not a huge fan of organ meat but this dish was unlike most liver dishes I've had. The toast was a great contrast to the smooth chicken liver which had a great sweet aftertaste from the caramelized onions. Burger: 25$ for a chargrilled burger with Roquefort cheese. Very simple but a word of caution: you may not like this if you don't enjoy stinky/ pungent cheeses like Gorgonzola. I enjoyed the burger but felt like the cheese was somewhat overwhelming at times. The fries are good but there's literally a ton of them; they're Shoe string fries so they're incredibly thin and somewhat redundant on the plate. I also got my burger medium rare and felt like it was a little more on the rare side than I would've liked. All in all, a great experience. Definitely pricey but the food is worth it.

It got better: the pork rillette with mustard and toast met with approval, but the smoked fish chowder with pancetta and homemade crackers was the show stopper: it was really really good.

We got there just after the doors opened - maybe the fourth or fifth party to be seated. Got seated right away, then the waiter tells us there's no gnudi all day. Sucks, but okay. Waiter takes our order - tea, pancakes, and french toast. Five minutes later he comes back because he stopped to chat with the bar tender (we could see him) and he forgot the order. We tell him again. Ten minutes pass. Twenty. Twenty-five. He comes back to apologize but says he can't find any teapots. (Again, the restaurant had just opened, so they all should have been ready to go.) At the thirty minute mark, he brings a teapot without a lid because he couldn't find one, but forgot the milk to go with it. At the forty minute mark, our stomachs are seriously rumbling (and there's still only one other group in our section, so it's not like the kitchen was slammed.) The waiter hasn't even stopped in our area in the last 15 minutes, let alone come to apologize for the wait or explain what's taking so long. 45 minutes in and we finally manage to flag him to ask if the food is EVER going to come out. Finally, nearly an hour after order, our food arrives (and fyi, the pancake option is literally one single pancake. It's more than enough, it was just a surprise.)The food was fantastic--probably the best pancake I've had in the city--but it wasn't good enough to make up for the service. My friend and I have both worked in restaurants, too, so we know what it's like. If the kitchen screws up, fine. But not even bothering to check in, try to explain what was happening or apologize? Seriously? And the kitchen's couldn't have been slammed--again, we were probably the fifth party there. How badly is your kitchen run that it can't handle five tables? My friend thinks it's more likely that the waiter just forgot to put in the order, but I don't know.

The waitstaff are man-bunned angels. I really enjoyed my late night meal here.The Food/Drinks --Mulled wine: This is the best mulled wine I've ever had, no hyberbole. The spice gave it a solid kick without overpowering and the wine itself was fruity without being too dessert-like. This is a MUST try!Devils on Horseback: bacon wrapped dates that were the perfect blend of sweet and savory. The bacon was melt in your mouth good and was complemented by the sweetness of the dates. The balsamic reduction (I think that's what it was) tied it all together very nicely and interestingly. Definitely a dish worth trying.The Burger: Now I've read some other reviews on here and have gathered that the burger is a polarizing experience. I'm in the ""I found the holy grail"" camp of tasters. This was an impeccably prepared burger. I'm known to be something of a burger snob and I was speechless after this. The meat, like the bacon in the dish above, just melted in your mouth, bursting with flavor. It was so simple and beautiful with the blue cheese and soft grilled bun. I almost didn't want to use their housemade condiments but I was glad I did. They're different and certainly with checking out. The shoestring fries with garlic and rosemary that came with it were a triumph all on their own. They go amazingly with the housemade ketchup. This is a definite MUST TRY!The Service --I was very impressed with our server. The owner had a personal friend coming in with a party of 20 going straight to our spot. He was very respectful, polite, and friendly with us. He was so nice and communicative that I almost wanted to help him set up for the big party too. When we ordered food later than we said we'd be there, he said ""no problem, we'll make sure you get it"". This was great service.

288,uFdkUQKqT60USnDmAuwLEg,Tory K.,1.0 star rating,"The Spotted Pig was my favorite brunch spot in the city until it completely shattered all my love for this joint yesterday. I absolutely hate it when a restaurant I love becomes an overpriced sub-par place, and it sucks even more because I hosted personal events here many times in the past. FOOD: The go-to dish here for brunch is the burger with the shoestring fries, but the unique brunch dish that I absolutely fell in love with since the first time I came here is their pork sisig. However, their sisig, compared to 1-2 years ago, has completely deteriorated in its quality and my dish yesterday came with quarter of the skillet full of oil. The burger also became mediocre, and now makes it feel and taste very overpriced. Their shoestring fries are still good, but we've ordered a few batches and the texture wasn't as consistent. Overall, the food here was easily one of the worst brunch meals I've had in the past 3 months.SERVICE: My party arrived when there was no wait, but we ended up waiting for about an hour. Their exact words when we came in were ""We have a table that is leaving, we can get you seated in about 10 minutes."" This became an hour, and about 7-8 tables that came after us got seated first. I feel like the restaurant could have managed the situation better by putting some tables together (done in the past from my previous experiences at this place), but they were fixated on putting us in a specific spot. To make matters worse, our food came out SO LATE, and one of our side dishes came out when we were almost done with our main. I'd expect a restaurant to pay extra attention and care to a party that unnecessarily waited for an hour (hosts and servers kept apologizing as we were getting seated), but their service was sub-par. We weren't a large party, and the restaurant seem incapable of resolving issues at hand. Overall, I'm really saddened about my experience here. This used to be one of my favorite joints in the city, but the quality of the food and service that I've experienced was way too damaging for me to go back here any time soon.

I've been meaning to go to Spotted Pig since I moved to New York 5 years ago and still had yet to find the right time. We thought July 4th might be the time to try the famous British gastropub given how many people vacate the city but we were still quoted a 90-minute wait. No biggie, we were prepared for that and headed to the Otherroom for drinks. Unfortunately we had just opened a bottle of wine when - 20 minutes after we put our name down - I received a text that our table was ready. Luckily our bartender friend was happy to hold the bottle for us, and we headed back, but the disconnect between the predicted and actual wait times was a little annoying. We split a few things to start - the deviled eggs and the gnudi - and both were delicious (and I don't even like deviled eggs). The gnudi were served in some type of rich buttery sauce and my only regret is that we didn't have any bread to wipe the bowl clean. Then, obviously, we each ordered the famous burger. I requested it medium rare, but I think my dinner date's request of ""how the chef prefers it"" was the better way to go (medium). It's a LOT of beef, so much that even though the Roquefort serving was pretty generous, it was somewhat overpowered by the meat. I'm not a huge shoestring fry person but they were pretty good too - note that they do not serve mayonnaise at all, it's strictly a ketchup and mustard place. I also had a bloody mary (weird time of day but I was craving one) and that hit the spot. I probably will not be back - the burger was not really worth a return visit - but i can't wait to hit up Salvation Burger and White Gold, April Bloomfield's newest spots, for some more excellent meat and potatoes.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I split the Burger and the gnudi.  The burger presentation is on point with the black charred marked.  I thought the Roquefort was a bit much, but I am also not a huge fan of it, so a little goes a long way for me.  The accompanying fries were crispy and had rosemary and random fried garlic chips hidden inside- YUM! The gnudi was rich so I would recommend splitting the dish, but I thought it was delicious with the butter and sage. I got a glass of wine- Beaujolais ($15).

It was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious. The skate was good, except I didn't realize it came with the bones in it, which was annoying to pick out. And when I say there were bones there were a LOT of bones. The sauce was also pretty good. Ah, the burger. I don't understand why it is so famous. Granted we did get the cheese on the side but it is a very, very smelly cheese. I put a little bit on and I could taste it in my mouth all night. Without the cheese, it was a very plain burger.

The gastropub movement has gained so much momentum that you can find tastier, more thoughtful menus at newer gastropubs that are looking to develop the genre instead of serving the same old same old. That said, I do have enormous respect for those restaurants that have the same unchanging small menu that they execute flawlessly time after time. This, however, was plain boring. We arrived during their busiest time and waited at the bar for a table. Fine by me. Saw some dishes come out of the kitchen, including the enormous burger other reviewers wrote about. Honestly looked pretty boring to me. When we finally sat down, our waiter was rude and impatient. None of the entrees looked particularly intriguing so we opted to order a bunch of bar snacks and plates instead. We usually order as we go when we go out to eat, which has never been a problem in the Bay Area (where we live), but our waiter informed us that we needed to order all at once. What? Seems to be an NYC thing. There were empty tables as we got halfway through our meal so they didn't appear to need the table sooner. Whatever.The deviled eggs were incredible. Wish we had gotten a double order. We also ordered oysters (with a lifeless mignonette), the apple and cheddar salad (mildly interesting but not revolutionary), the ricotta gnudi (incredibly, incredibly rich and delicious), the mackerel (sounded interesting but was a strange dish), and a side of fries (is that much rosemary necessary?). Really nothing spectacular. Especially not for such a long wait, huge hype, and expensive bill. To top it off, the service was atrocious. Our waiter didn't come back to our table after taking our order, but continually checked on the tables next to us. In a tiny restaurant, it's easy to tell when your waiter is paying more attention to the old white guys in suits. We couldn't even order more beer because our waiter so intently avoided us, even when we tried to flag him down. His loss -- the bill was smaller and accordingly so was his tip. In sum, the food isn't bad, but it isn't going to be the showstopper you expect it to be. I imagine it's really only visited by tourists at this point. Go find something more exciting out there.

The flavor was ultimately very mellow. It's a great precursor to the main event.Chargrilled Burger -- A crowd favorite. Heck, Google their famous burger and see pages and pages of sites describing their infatuation and even recipes in hopes to replicate the item at home.The patty was remarkably thick, easily one of the thickest burger patties I've ever had. The bun was heavy and firm, somewhat crunchy around the edges. The one ingredient that completely changed the burger was the Roquefort Cheese. It's a sheep milk blue cheese which altered the taste of the burger. I, for one, am not a fan of blue cheese. It makes me think that the cheese is far past the level of expired and, in the end, makes me feel ill. All I could taste was the cheese. It really took away from the flavor of the meat.

311,XOZaHpEkJJ4THWVqZITksw,Lindsay H.,2.0 star rating,"Wow. And I mean that in the worst way.I literally left the restaurant tonight and went home to double check that they actually had a Michelin star, because it was that bad. I figured I had made a mistake.My husband and I showed up around 4pm, knowing dinner didn't start until 5:30 (fine with us!!) -- we wanted to have a few cocktails before dinner.  We each had three fantastic cocktails, and the bartender was wonderful.  She, alone, is the reason for the two stars.  Drinks were nice and complex and not overly sweet.We were seated for dinner about ten minutes after the seating started.  We ordered four dishes to split -- the ricotta gnudi (a menu standard) and three of the four off menu specials for the night (a squid dish, a skate dish, and a pork cheek dish). We also ordered a bottle of wine.About ten minutes after ordering (maybe 6pm), the ricotta gnudi came out. It would've been delicious but was heavily over salted.  We are not the type to send dishes back, but we should've. It was sooo over seasoned.  The underlying components were nice, though.About ten minutes after that, the skate came out. Really moist and tasty -- but, again, super salty.  The skate itself was over salted and then was also covered in capers, adding even more salt.  The greens were yummy, though.Then, not even five minutes later, the squid came out.  Not sure why -- it was obvious we were sharing everything and we can only eat one dish at once!!  But more importantly, there literally wasn't room on the table for it. Their two-top tables are TINY. They took away our water from us (to make room for the food) and had to put our wine on the floor to fit the two dishes on the table at the same time (our wine, by the way, came reaaaally close to getting knocked over by people sitting at the table next to us, who were so close they may as well have been sitting with us).Then, not two minutes later, our pork cheeks came out. The poor back waiter who brought it out looked mortified when he realized there was nowhere on our table to put it. Clearly, whoever was expediting and/or running the pass in the back was way over his or her head.  They should've known their two-tops can't accommodate three plates at a time.  They had to take it back because there was just no way to put it on the table (though, boy did they try to figure out where they could stick it) given we were still eating the squid and skate.It took us about twenty minutes to finish our squid and skate. At that point, they prepped our pork cheeks. To their credit, they definitely didn't try to serve us the same plate that had been prepped thirty minutes prior and sent back to the kitchen -- it took a reasonable amount of time to come out. And it was, to be fair, delicious.  Actually, so was the squid.  But the skate and gnudi were just toooo salty; honestly, it felt like the head chef (by which I don't mean April, I mean whoever she leaves to run the restaurant in her stead, as I assume she isn't generally there) didn't get there until about 30 or 40 minutes after dinner service started, and so he or she was checking the seasoning on our last two dishes, but that someone less experienced was handling our first two (which came out before then).All in all, the bartending staff and all the front of house staff was fine. But the kitchen was frankly in the gutter tonight.  The poor guys sitting next to us waited forever for their food, which was disturbingly comical given that ours felt like it was being shoved down our throats to turn the table over as fast as possible.I didn't go here expecting fine dining. I just wanted good food.  But that didn't happen.  At least the drinks were good.Assuming our experience was typical (and not an unfortunate fluke), I doubt they'll keep their star for long.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

315,TWxdVIudrC5CnrGnO8k1JA,Sally L.,2.0 star rating,"Came here on a quest to find a burger in NYC that beats shake shack. According to the reviews, this burger is HEAVELY. I don't mind waiting for good food... so we put down our number and went to another bar for 90 minutes until our table was ready.The Spotted Pig is TINY. It's super difficult getting in and out of the tables and you're up close and personal to your dining neighbors/can hear all their life problems/whatever intimate conversation they're having and think you can't hear. If you have to go to the bathroom and you're sitting on the inside, be prepared to inconvenience everyone and move out slowwwlyy. Anyway, all this would be fine if the burger was amazing, but it was not. We got the skirt steak and the famous burger with shoestring fries to share. There was a 40 minute wait for the burger.. but no worries, we already waited 90 mins. The skirt steak came out first and it was actually cooked very tenderly and flavorful. It came with some sort of butter/cream cheese and I happily cleaned up the plate. After another 20 minutes.. the burger came out and as I feared... I was pretty disappointed. First of all, I don't like blue cheese and there was some kind of blue cheese spread which I wasn't a fan of (and scraped it off). The shoestring fries were annoying to eat but it was not awful. I made sure my last bite was the skirt steak and not the mediocre, unimpressive burger. We got the creme caramel (basically flan.. why didn't they just call it flan) for dessert. This was pretty good, but almost like any other flan I've had. Hard to mess it up.Oh, idk if it was just the day I was there but I think the bathroom is literally a sauna. If you plan on taking #2, then make sure you bring a towel in there cause you'll have to wipe up sweat afterwards. You could barely MOVE. Not a fan at all.Why was the burger so overrated?? I know this is NYC, but why was everything so squished together?? I think you can probably get rid of a table or two and make the bathroom a little bit bigger. I'm really not overweight but JESUS, please do something to accommodate other people..Wait.. how does this place have 1 Michelin Star??!?!?!?Best burger in NYC?

The Thai broth didn't make me want to soak up with a bread. How mussels could be tasteless. I guess no seafood on Monday applies here. I want to believe it was their worst day but I felt bad for my friends from Tokyo to treat me for this lunch.The famous burger - perfectly cooked, medium. It was good but not that special especially for the price. It was good as Umami Burger except the price, $21 vs $15.5 (Classic $12 + fries $3.5) and you get your choice of fries. To my surprise, I did enjoyed the string fries with rosemary.Cuban sandwich ($19)-I read a good review but what we got was just okay, nothing very special. Tasty Prosciutto de Parma and the aged gruyere didn't help this gamey pork that was in the sandwich. Usually acidity from piickles help  a bit but not this one. Crème Caramel ($9)- everything we had, so far, were below 4.5 start so we didn't expect much from the dessert but it was excellent. We all loved this gelatinous Spanish-like firmed custard pudding with a light caramel sauce.We did not understand why we needed to wait for a table even the place wasn't packed for early Monday lunch. We waited outside for good 30 minutes but no one check us but we noticed may customers were showing up. I found that waiting outside was not a good idea because people after us got their table before us. I checked the name list that was left unattended and the name after us were erased. I suggest do not wait for your table outside.Big group of French tourists next to our table were waiting for their food and they were very chatty, high energy and being very French.

We were told the wait would be over an hour for a table, so we decided to sit at the bar and order food. Not even 30 minutes later, a table opened up so we were able to sit. Unfortunately it was a slow day in the kitchen, and us and tables around us were waiting over an hour. The wait staff felt bad for the inconvenience, and offered to give out free drinks until our food arrived, and even provided some bar snacks.When the burgers came, I soon realized it was WELL worth the wait, and one of the best burgers I have ever bit into. It was perfectly cooked (medium rare), and the bleu cheese (although uncommon for a burger) gave it such an interesting flavor. The shoestring fries were piping hot and also increadible. I finished every morsel of food on my plate. So delicious.Despite the long wait (it was an off day), the service was excellent and burger even better.

Came here while a bit hungry after watching a 2+ hour movie.  BAD idea to come even if you're a bit hungry, you will be hangry from waiting and leave disappointed.  Waited close to 45 minutes for just 2 simple dishes (pork cheeks with fried egg and cubano sandwich with small arugula side salad) and they weren't good enough to be worth the wait!  Come on, the place is called ""The Spotted Pig"" and naturally you would think their best dishes would be pork.  The sandwich was trash (only half was eaten), definitely not worth anyone's $24 even if you're filthy rich!  While waiting for the food no one came by our table to check in and let us know how much longer it will take (many restaurants do this when waiting long).  I had to frantically wave my arm like a crazy person to flag down a waiter to ask where are they with the order, but before I could even finish my sentence he cut me off and said ""It's coming"" in the worse attitude EVER.  You would think a restaurant that has been around for 10+ years and awarded so many accolades should have perfected some kind of system between the dining room and kitchen to provide impeccable service.  Guess not.  What's up with the waiters/waitresses adorned with tattoos having the nerve to walk around being all pretentious??  I guess they don't care about the service or food quality anymore.  Service to get food is slow AF but they came to collect our plates literally 10-15 min after we got them.  We didn't clean our plates since the food wasn't that great.  I can honestly say the food and service is not as good as it once was.  It's now just a tourist trap with crazy overpriced mediocre/bad food.  There are plenty of other places that can make better food for a lower price with much better service for its patrons.  Sadly this place has lost its touch and I will no longer be coming back.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

My mouth waters just thinking of their masterpiece of a burger...Wife and I were touring around NYC on a trip last June, and ended an afternoon saunter down the High Line with a stroll through East Village to the Spotted Pig (so we're tourists... there I said it).For some reason I assumed it would look like the same blaise, faux-rural, exposed lightbulbs, reclaimed wood bullshit that everyone and their brother (or is it mother?) are opening up these days. However, I was charmed by the homey look and feel of the place; we thought it looked like an English grandmother's garden shed and loved everything about it. Sat at the bar with a few drinks taking in the decor and chatting with our bar neighbors. Then the burgers came and my life changed.The burger patty itself was wonderfully juicy, cooked perfectly and overall was just top notch. Like some other posters, bleu cheese isn't really my thing, but it's easily scraped off. I ate about half with, half without it and enjoyed both equally. I advise eating it in small bites to really savor it. The fries also surprised me and I loved how garlicky they were.In short, despite of the huge number of great dining options for visitors to explore in NYC, whenever we're in town again we'll be back to the Spotted Pig for round two.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I had a group of around 8 clients looking for a late-night snack. It was an immediately frustrating experience because we went upstairs to the bar, but then I had to go back downstairs to get seated at a table. The worst moment though was how rude the waitress was. Right as we were first seated, I was trying to be nice, and make sure my clients were well-taken care of. When I asked the African-American waitress her name (she had long dreadlocks & glasses), she rudely and sarcastically replied ""I'd rather not."" After that snide comment, she was impatient with everyone as they placed their orders and didn't even pretend to be nice. I was aghast by this happening to some of important clients. I was clearly going to be spending a lot of money on dinner, and she didn't seem to care at all. #onlyinnycI hope the restaurant reconsiders her employment; it was one of the worst customer experiences I've had in my 8 years as a NYC resident.

Justine, the hostess, came up and told us there was a spot open at the bar and if we acted fast we would be able to grab it! We absolutely loved her for that. Theresa was our server and she was absolutely amazing. My girlfriend and I ordered two specials, Pumpkin soup with farro, pancetta, and sage; and the Romesco cauliflower. Both came out hot and delicious. They were swamped and super busy so it did take some time for our food to come out but it was worth the wait and when Theresa was able to stop by she was very attentive, present, and friendly. We also had the hanger steak entree which my girlfriend is now obsessed with. It was cooked perfectly and the mushrooms were amazing. ""Literally the best thing I've ever put in my mouth.""

We tried to get in on a Friday night and the wait was literally 4 hours, so we tried again the next night (and started earlier). We were able to get a table pretty quickly, even though it was super duper crowded and literally directly next to the bathroom door. I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of the incredibly dimly lit restaurant scene mostly because a) I'm one of those people who likes to photograph their food and I could get zero pictures here and b) I could not see my friends at all. Also people kept whacking me in the head with their bags because the space was so limited upstairs, I'm not sure about the downstairs area. We also had a super weird server/waiter experience, where we were both served by about 4 different people and the guy who took our order, the woman who came to check on how our food was doing, and the three different people who bussed our table did not seem at all interested in refilling our water or getting us another round of drinks. Our first waiter seemingly disappeared but maybe just switched tables? Because he was still there waiting on other tables, but then a different waiter came to ours. It was super super confusing and for a restaurant this famous I was expecting a bit more.I had the chicken liver toast (which was not brought out to me initially until after people had finished their entrees, I then asked for it twice from two different waiters because we had no idea who ours was anymore, and it was brought out after the main course--not cool). This was truly delicious and I never thought I would be a chicken liver person, but I am if it always tastes like this! I of course also had the gnudi, which this place is known for, and 100% lives up to the hype. At first I looked at it and thought the portion was a little small, but then diving into it I could barely finish it due to the richness. We also had the broccoli rabe and the polenta with nettle puree, the first was pretty basic but still delicious, and the polenta was such an interesting flavor--I had never had a nettle puree before and it was such a great addition to the polenta.3 stars for service (come on y'all, step it up a little...) and 5 stars for food.

I am a very patient woman. Sadly, no celebrity spotting at this evening but their delicious apps and entrees made up for any sorrow for not seeing Beyonce and Jay-Z. The ambience was fun and kitschy: pigs lining the top windows, pigs hanging from the ceilings, pig made out of twine outside the restaurant. Our friend loved the pig theme. For starters, we ordered the deviled egg (flavorful, fresh, serves 2), devils on horseback (dates, bacon and hint of spiciness), and chicken liver toast (amazingly moist due to liver mixed with olive oil, sprinkled with sea salt: delicious but not very photogenic). For entrees: sheep's milk ricotta gnudi with basil pesto (the buttery basil pesto was amazing!), their famous burger with Roquefort Cheese and shoestring fries. I must stop and say the burger is perfect if you split it with 3 other people. Its a great taste with the strong pungent cheese, medium rare juicy beef, very nice. If I were to eat the whole burger, I would not have the same review. And those fries! We could not get enough of them! They had slivers of garlic crisps and rosemary mixed with the fries. My new favorite fries! So aromatic! We just smelled fried rosemary and rosemary all night long. Loved it! (Also we were seated next to a rosemary plant). Last entree: Pig cheek sausage with fried pig ears. Loved the crispy salty fatty cartilage of the pig ears. The pigs cheek was perfectly done, falling apart into the rich savory salty sauce.

Both of us chose the chargrilled burger with Roquefort cheese and shoestring fries and a Bronx Brewery Summer Pale Ale.The burger (medium rare) was absolutely superb, the cheese giving it a tasty complexity. One of the best examples I'd had in my 10 days in NYC. The shoestring fries were a novelty, but damn hard to eat without you resembling a farm animal scoffing a load of straw.Service was a tad hit-and-miss - starting well but then our waitress disappeared when we were ready to pay and even waving a credit card at other staff members didn't illicit a response.

So many people got here before me. So first, we decided to grab some drinks at the bar. Since the places started to pack up, people were standing in the aisles (no where else to go) and one of the workers was clearly super aggravated about all the people. She was so rude and pushed her dish bucket into people and made a path to get to the kitchen...yes, just what people want on a Friday afternoon. She was snappy and just absolutely did not want to be there. This kind of pissed me off bc she knocked into me as well. The food: we got a few appetizers and of course, the famous burger. For appetizers we went with the gnudi, devils on horsebacks, and chicken liver toast. My group of three thought the appetizers were ok, but not as good as the hype. The saddest part comes next.. we were all soo excited for the burger so we each ordered our own and I purposely took my cousin (a burger aficionado) here... he, like the rest of us thought that it was okay. I was actually really surprised about how strong the roquefort cheese taste was..it overpowered the whole burger and all I could taste was the cheese! This was disappointing. The fries on the other hand, were absolutely to die for. SO good. Glad I got to try it but not sure if I would return.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

We ordered a Margi (7.5 out of 10) and the Don Vito (10 out of 10). For appetizers we ordered the deviled eggs (8 out of 10) and the devils on horseback (8 out of 10). My wife makes a mean deviled egg so we were anxious to compare the two. For entrees, we all went with the burger and fries. Three at the table got the cheese on the side after finding out that there were not any other cheese options (Roquefort isn't a family fav) for the burger. The burgers took all of 45m to get to us. In the meantime we ordered another round of drinks. The burgers were cooked to perfection. I had the medium rare and the balance of the table went with well-done. The fries, because they are the width of a shoestring, are a little challenging to eat. Also, we asked for a second portion of ketchup when the food arrived as I knew we would blow thru the 2 oz portion that came with each burger. We skipped dessert as its a big meal, even for those that skipped lunch and had snacks throughout the day.

It took awhile to get the food out. Review on food: the chargrilled burger with Roquefort cheese and shoestring fries.I believe that the cheese overpowered the burger and the bun was surprisingly tougher than I imagined. I do have to say that the star of the dish is actually the fries.

We finally were seated upstairs after an hour or so. Server was busy so service was a bit slow. We had drinks in hand and each ordered a different salad. The roasted carrot salad with avocado and orange was probably one of the best salads of my life. The roasted carrots were just perfect. Huge chunks of avocado and juicy oranges with the perfect amount of the vinaigrette, which was to die for. Fresh herbs made this simple salad a masterpiece. My friend's bibb lettuce salad was just ok. Mine was the star of the show. Just wow. Order it.We split the deviled eggs which were good, but had a weird celery-tasting liquid on it. Wasn't crazy about these. We split their famous burger and yes, it was completely worth $21. It was a huge burger with the perfect ratio of meat to bun. Roquefort on top of the juicy meat was just to die for. Seriously another amazing dish. Shoestring fries with fresh rosemary. OMG those fries.

Since Spotted Pig doesn't take reservations, we decided to come around 6pm before the normal dinner crowd, and we were seated right away. Host was kinda rude and dismissive, but we barely had to deal with him, so it didn't matter too much. We were placed in a circular booth, nearly sharing a table with another party, but it wasn't too terrible. I will say that I can definitely see it getting crowded here when busy.Felt kind of embarrassed to just order 3 burgers, but we did it anyways, as well as an order of the chicken liver toast. None of us really felt a burger was a dish that you could share. This is America, after all. The chicken liver spread was seasoned well and just the right consistency, and for $7, not bad. It was a good primer for the long-awaited burger. So I'm not sure if I just over-hyped it for myself, but the burger just did not meet my expectations. The roquefort was definitely way too overpowering, and the burger itself was a bit bland. The meat was cooked a perfect medium rare and the brioche bun was just the right texture, but flavor profiles were just a bit rough on the edges. I was a bit disappointed, but happily ate the burger anyway. Conversely, the fries had great flavor with the rosemary, garlic, and salt, but were more like potato sticks than actual fries, so you don't that substantial mouth-feel you get with thicker fries. Ha, substantial mouth-feel. Bet you hear that one all the time. In all, I can't say that it was worth the $21.Service was pretty attentive and friendly, and while  the food took longer than usual, the waitress was quite quick with water and beers. Beer selection is decent, although I'm usually not a big fan of $8 beers.Anyways, the experience itself was pretty good, and I can definitely see myself coming back to try the other dishes, which, from the reviews seem like they're pretty good.

The spotted pig biter was great with the legions of meat. The food was all incredible. Unlike other great restaurants, the entire menu was stand out, not just a single item. The chicken liver spread was amazing with a sweet note that went so well with wine. The devils on horseback, Bacon wrapped dates were also a great balance of sweat and salty. The gnudi were chewy and cheesy. The mussels with Thai Green Curry and cocunut milk were so good with a great tangy flavor. The pork cheek and liver dumplings were so good, no wonder they have pig paraphernalia everywhere. The cheeks were so crunchy and chewy but flavor packed. The dumplings were tender and succulent. The burger is also truly superb. The meat is so flavorful and tender and seasoned so well. The fries were also great with rosemary making them seem fairly light.

I thought this was pretty unfair not to give the place a chance and only base it on that, but my view changed.We arrived at Spotted Pig at about 715pm (so about prime time) and were told that it would be a 45min - 1hr wait. When we came back, they still weren't ready for us and told us that there were 3 more groups ahead of us. We decided to go upstairs to their bar but after seeing how packed it was, we just decided to wait outside. Also, when we walked around upstairs and peered into the dining area downstairs, we noticed MULTIPLE empty tables. Why? I'm not quite sure, but maybe the kitchen can't accommodate that many people since it is so tiny. So we waited and finally after nearly 2 hours of waiting we got our table. All the tables for 2 were super close to each other, but we lucked out and got a corner booth table! Most tables don't even have chairs, they have stools - not the most comfortable way to enjoy a nice dinner.This place was on our radar because we were told by friends that it had 1 Michelin star and that their burger is really good. So, we decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, we had to wait yet another 30-45min for our food to be prepared. It really is an entire evening ordeal. I asked for my burger to be medium and it was not cooked enough at all. My boyfriend asked for medium-rare and it was definitely on the more rare side.

We were seated immediately at the bar and then offered an upstairs table. Used to a long wait here since they don't take reservations, that was surprising and super nice, although we discovered that the bar/first floor was much cooler than upstairs with a broken air conditioner. Stuffy air, close quarters, sweaty bodies; this is how people must've felt back in the Revolutionary War days when this building was probably built.Four of us ordered the burgers and shoestring fries. I thought the burger was ok although I ordered a medium and received medium rare. I like medium rare beef, but not on a burger due to Mom warnings (she's always right). The food runner probably mixed up the plate placements since the four of our orders were flip-flopped. Maybe they should have those little ""Medium Rare"" sticks on them... The burger tasted a bit too salty, maybe because of the roquefort cheese and over-seasoning of the meat.Each order came with a huge mound of shoestring fries, and although everyone else finished theirs, I could barely get half in my mouth. To me they were way too salty.You probably won't spot me here too much in the future, unless out-of-town friends put this on their Must-Do list.

This is under rated at 3.5 stars on yelp, and well deserves the Michelin star that it carries. I love the atmosphere here, cosy without feeling overcrowded. The cocktails are fantastic, I have never been disappointed. Beer selection is great too, always a few cask selections on tap which I love for a change. The burger is my go-to, the meat mix is fantastic and the roquefort blue cheese is always such a treat. People that are giving this burger tepid reviews are likely confused about the cheese - I have spoken to people that are... The deviled egg appetizer is also phenomenal, we usually start with a few of them. Mussels were great, pig ear salad is always good. Combine it all with great service and this place is a no brainer. Helpful tip: We (party of 2) have never waited more than 10 minutes for a table. We last ate this past Monday night at 10pm. The trick is to put this on your list of restaurants when you are eating a little later than you normally would.

As for the burger...don't get me wrong, the patty was cooked to perfection just how we wanted (medium rare - which made me wonder, why did it take an hour to get our burgers when we asked for medium rare??), and the bun was also great, but the blue cheese was really not cool. There was definitely too much blue cheese to the point where it dominated the burger and left a repugnant taste in my mouth. My boyfriend kept looking at me, fully aware of my dislike for blue cheese, and was anxiously waiting for me to blow up. Fortunately, I didn't. I doused my burger in ketchup and mustard to mask the taste of the cheese, so it wasn't too bad.The shoestring fries were pretty good - crispy and flavorful, and that's about it.Do I think the burger was worth $21? Absolutely not.Will I ever return? Oh, hell no. Not if I have to wait an hour for a damn burger.Remember the waitress who took our orders in the beginning? Well, the only time she ever returned was to take the checkbook. It doesn't matter if your restaurant is extremely popular - your customers should always be your top priority. It should not take an hour for us to receive our orders, and our servers should not be checking in with us just to take our order and give us the bill.Maybe this would've been slightly justified if the place was super cheap. But it wasn't, so everything that happened is not okay.Yelpers, you let me down.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I chose the burger and fries, and so glad that I did. I'm a burger snob because I I love great meat and charbroiled backyard grill taste, and this burger more than met my taste. It is served on a brioche bun that also was grilled, and just perfect. The burger is accompanied by shoe string fries (actually even smaller) that were not too greasy and very tasty. I chose an Allagash wheat beer for my drink, but I will have to say that I felt the beer prices were quite hefty for beer that is pretty widely distributed throughout the Northeast ($10 for my small bottle).We were seated quickly, and I loved the team approach to service here. Every waiter in the restaurant was paying attention to our table, and we were never without water, drinks or food during our whole experience ... even at midnight.I only have one recommendation for improvement: The restaurant seems to take some weird pride in not serving mayonnaise, and only ketchup and dijon mustard. Dear owner or GM, get over it :)  Some of us like mayo with our burgers, and I personally don't like dijon. At a casual restaurant like this one, it's a policy that just makes no sense, and it's more of an irritation to your guests than a practice that any of us are impressed by.

I don't know what the wait time is on an average night here.. but you can't make a reservation. It was a Saturday night. We were quoted 2-hours for a table by the hostess. There is no reason to EVER wait 2-hours for a meal. So we wait for seats at the bar which still took about 45 minutes. People are HAWKS. And mind you the bar isn't exactly a pleasant experience. People behind you squeezing through and splishing around drinks. I was facing a wall. Whatever. Had planned to come with some friends and now we were here.. we were seated.. and we were gonna order.I ordered THE burger. It was good.. but it was just too much. I love cheeseburgers as much as the next gal... I need cheese on a burger (unless its Minetta Tavern) but this was overkill. It was like roquefort on top of roquefort on top of roquefort on top of an already oily burger. I have a stomach of STEEL and I felt sick the entire next day. If I was a fat man I'd probably have had a heart attack The place is known for their shoestring fries. And again they are good. But they're too skinny to pick up with fingers. And damned near impossible to pick up with a fork.. just ended up feeling like they were more work than they're worth.The sheeps milk ricotta gnudi... it was just also so rich. I maybe had 2 gnudi's and I was done. Everyone loves it.. because they taste delicious. But I can make anything taste delicious if it is straight saturated fat in butter sauce.Went upstairs afterwards to have another drink. Ended up leaning against this door to a staircase in the back that all of the waitstaff walk up & down from.

430,aacSlcZwmfNIv3c1YmrZ4Q,Raymart D.,3.0 star rating,"Oh, the Spotted Pig, I expected more but you did not deliver. I've heard about this place because of I April Bloomfield and only until my friend suggested we have dinner here that I decided to finally check it out. Lets start off with the food. We ordered the Devils on Horseback to share which were bacon wrapped prunes. Curse you bacon for making me order everything with you. I don't like prunes. They're weird and also associate them with old people (no offense to prune fans or the elderly). The prunes were too sweet and considering they were wrapped in bacon, completely overpowered the smoky fattiness of the pork. My friend and I both ordered the burger with shoestring fries. These fries were potato sticks and while they look all pretty on a plate as a bundle, it isn't practical if you want to dip in a sauce. Why April Bloomfield why? I like my fries thicker thank you very much. Also you have to sift through the rosemary pines once you get through most of the bundle. The burger while having gorgeous grill marks on the bun and cooked to the right temperature, the roquefort cheese was too strong of a flavor. The balance of flavor is off with the pungent blue cheese and the meat. It needed something else. Its a simple burger but unfortunately in this instance, simple isn't better. The fact that the burger and fries are $22 doesn't help its cause. I'll give The Spotted Pig points for decor with the cabin in the woods vibe with a mix of paintings, log wood, and warmth. Other than that, that's all I can recommend. Happy eating and remember: Don't deny, satisfy!",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

We were told that it was going to literally be a 2 hour wait for a table and this place does not take reservations. Assuming that it would be worth the wait we decided to go somewhere else down the block to  have some drinks and to try to snack on something in the meantime. It was literally a solid 1 1/2 hours later maybe more before we received a text that our table was ready. The service was  good and so were the drinks but at that point I was just anticipating the food. I decided to go with the cheeseburger which is popular here and the Sheep's milk ricotta gnudi with brown butter and crispy sage, sounds delicious right?! I thought that the cheeseburger was good but the gnudi was mediocre. Overall it was not worth the long wait. Service in the front is pretty unapologetic about how long the wait is. Its kind of  a ""like  it or not"" mentality. Which if your business is booming I guess you can do that but thats not cool at all.

I barely use/need any salt while cooking for my boyfriend and I. So, my point is, this food was SALTY for me. At least in what my boyfriend and I ordered. We watched all three seasons of The Mind of a Chef and we were excited to visit this place after watching 3rd season chef Amy Bloomfield. Super cool, down to earth Chef. She mentioned in one of the episodes that she wanted people to feel like they're at ""home"" when they visit The Spotted Pig. Super cozy building with cute little pigs and other knick-knacks placed in every nook and cranny. We enjoyed the ambiance.   We got to The Spotted Pig around 6:00PM on a Sunday night and it was packed. We waited for about 1 hr 45 mins at the bar upstairs (we found a corner to squeeze and stand into). The bartender, Alex, was very friendly and a cool cat! We really enjoyed chatting with him and he took very good care of us, while we were waiting for our table. WE ORDERED 3 DISHES WHILE WE WAITED:Chicken Liver Toast - very tasty. Salty, garlic liver spread.Deviled Egg - My boyfriend said it was one of the best he's ever had (I'm allergic to eggs :( , so unfortunately I didn't get to try it). Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi with Brown Butter & Sage - This was very tasty and savory. Again, a little on the salty side for me, but I enjoyed it with my beer!FOR DINNER: We had the Skate, which is the fin of the Skate Stingray (I don't see it on the websites menu?) with the Beets & Greens. The Beets & Greens were awesome. TONS of flavor. We really enjoyed the ""warm"" flavors that oozed from this dish. We never had Skate, so we had a go and tried it. It was interesting that the meat slid right off the cartilage/bone with little to no effort. The texture is softer (almost slippery?) than most fish, so keep that in mind. Overall the staff was very friendly and we enjoyed the homey, cozy feel of this restaurant. Even though the food was a bit on the salty side it did make me drink more beer, which I'm sure has something to do with their evil plan ;) haha!

We figured we would grab some drinks and wait inside, there were seats around ""the column"". There were some special beers listed on the board but I wanted some sort of a cocktail, so I asked to see a menu. So far so good. The people I was with decided to get something to drink, went up to the bar, came right back with drinks. I got my menu, decided what I wanted, went up to the bar said hi to the bartender while looking right at him, then he turned around and started talking to some of the people seated at the bar, OK,I'll wait until he's done, he can see me he's turned to my side, but then turns his back to me and talks to some other people. OK, they were there 1st maybe they asked for more drinks. no, he's not making anything. He rings up a tab, OK I get that too. But now I've been there about 10-15 min. Finally he turns towards me I ask for my drink, he makes it, a waiter comes up he makes a drink for him and then rings me up. I don't know why it took so long, it did seem as if I was being ignored, but hey I'll let it go I finally have my drink and it's good! We get seated, mind you the place is small and busy but it was comfortable, I didn't feel crowded, so that's a plus too.I probably should have looked at the menu before hand but didnt. So I am between 2 pork dishes. I ask the waiter, who was very friendly, great service which he would pick, he says they are both good but one of the dishes  is a cold dish so I go with the sizzling sisig. I really should have known what it was before I ordered it, and that's on me. There is a lot of gristly bits in it, it's the nature of the dish. Had I known I would have ordered something else, BUT it was very flavorful and the meaty bits were good, I just couldn't eat the gristle. But here's the kicker 1 of us is vegetarian, so she asks him for a recommendation, guess what he is a vegetarian too!! so how did he know both pork dishes were good???? I don't know, wish he would have told me. Anyway we got the deviled eggs, they were really really good. Someone had the burger, said it was good, I tried the potatos that came with it, they were ok, more like chips than fries. I guess my expectations were too high for what the whole experience was.

Of course they're known for their sensational burger and shoestring fries but everything else on the menu is just as amazing as well.

One thing that really stands out to me when I come here is that the staff don't remove plates from the table until everyone has finished with their meal - that is true etiquette and I don't see happening a lot in NYC restaurants! If you're coming here because you're in town make sure you try and arrive just before 7 or you will most likely be asked to wait for your table - there is a bar to drink at though.

Go figure! We had plans to go for sweets elsewhere so we skipped dessert. The bathrooms are tiny, very dark and UNISEX which was really odd. You can't wash your hands without rubbing elbows with the guy or girl next to you. That was interesting.All in all, this was a wonderful little spot that is full of character.

Set in sickeningly cute West Village, you say? Burgers for breakfast, you say? All true, all needing to be experienced in person.Being from San Francisco, we take our brunch pretty seriously. I had high expectations for this place, having heard about it from multiple sources, all with sweeping positives reviews. Get there a tad before open at 11:00am and you'll be guaranteed a table. Your whole party must be there or they won't seat you. Show up any later and you might be waiting 1-2 hours. I understand you New Yorkers don't like to wake up until noon on the weekend, but sacrifice an hour of sleep just this once - you'll be glad you did.Service was friendly and attentive. Our food took some time (understandably with the kitchen getting backlogged from the first seating), but still no longer than ~30 minutes. We sated ourselves with a few morning cocktails and deviled eggs, which were sweet, creamy, divine.Our party ordered the croque monsieur, the sizzling sisig, the dutch baby, and the two poached eggs with pig hash. They're obsessed with pigs at this establishment, and their passion shows through in their food.Croque Monsieur - a giant, buttery, delicious ham, egg, and cheese sando. Eat half, take the rest home - unless you dare have the butter sweats the rest of the day.Sizzling Sisig - described by the waitress as ""Pork Face"" with eggs, meaning everything from a pig's head in a cast iron skillet. It was delicious. She undersold it - I'd rather just eat the sausage and not know how it gets made. Dutch Baby - a cross between French Toast and a pancake. With maple bacon syrup. Nuff said.Pork Hash - This was fantastic. Eggs were runny inside, yolks a healthy bright orange. All oozing over a pile of sautéed vegetables, potatoes, and a mountain of pork. All together the bill came out to ~$50 per person, which for the appetizers, drinks, and large delicious portions in the West Village is perfectly tolerable.

456,exHYmPL9NvElHKG5YhgdWQ,Joyce C.,2.0 star rating,"I kept hearing about The Spotted Pig over the years and after seeing April Bloomfield in a Fall New York Magazine article about NY's top Chefs and recently on a Mind of a Chef, I finally made it there on a Friday night. Wait for a table of 3 at 6:30pm was still about 45 minutes. We had just gotten there at the start of service and waited near the bottom of the stairs (slightly out of the way, but still not since the Staff come up and down the stairs with platters and exit through the side door to probably get supplies?). FYI- there's very little waiting room except for a window counter, of if you're lucky, to get a seat at the Bar. To sum up The Spotted Pig, their main ingredient: SALT. Everything was SO salty! Yes food needs to be seasoned, but even just after having the Deviled Eggs (interesting appetizer, freshly made with a kick of spice. One is just enough to fill you up), it's crunchy salt in the yolk dehydrated us instantly. Friend and I split the Burger and Shoestring Fries and the Ricotta Gnudi in sage brown butter sauce. The burger was Huge, and definitely recommend getting it medium or more rare. We got it medium-well and it was a little by dry and too much rich meat to handle. Although very fresh. The fries were awesome, but yes, there it is again: SALT. The little fried bits of rosemary (THAT was why we kept smelling whiffs of delicious rosemary!) was a nice touch, but we couldn't finish it due to all that sodium. The Gnudi was definitely a standout and highly recommended. If I'm going to to make the effort and spend hard-earned money eating out, it'd be great if it was something that I don't know how to make, or something that I've never had before. Their Gnudi process is apparently specific to The Spotted Pig, the chef uses goat's milk and lets the gnudi rest in semolina flour for a few days, forming a crust around each ball. Each piece was a soft little pillow of deliciousness, wrapped in a thin little pasta. The sage and brown butter was the perfect compliment. This dish is a little heavy to eat as an entree (for about 6-8 pieces), I would recommend it to share. Also recommend eating it before it cools off, as it doesn't keep the same consistency. We split a Banoffe pie and it was just alright. It tasted super fresh and like it was just made. But that pretty much describes it: just made layers of dulce de leche, sliced bananas, whipped cream, and espresso dust. It seemed to need more time for the flavors to meld- or maybe that's how it's supposed to taste?For 2 burgers & fries, 1 Gnudi special, 2 deviled eggs apps, 1 banoffe, 1 hard cider, it came out to about $160 (including tax and tip). Not sure if I would go back, due to their long wait times and cost of the meal. If I do, I'd definitely try to sit upstairs, the downstairs is fairly cramped. Downstairs definitely feels like a pub, the upstairs feels like brunch. The service was okay, although the hosts a the front kept changing their posts, but didn't seem like servers?

The interior of the restaurant is very cute with an apparent British pub influence. Heard this is one of Kanye West's favorite restaurants to go to in NY so my expectations were high (obviously cause Kanye is Kanye). Also this restaurant has a Michelin star, so I was looking forward to the taste and quality of the meal.  First things first, the service was great. The servers were attentive, friendly, and well informed about the ingredients and what exactly they were giving their customers. We started with the CHICKEN LIVER and the DEVILED EGGS. The Chicken Liver was tasty and a bit sweeter than I was expecting, but delicious nonetheless. But, the Deviled Eggs was the dish that stole the show today. I would come back just for the Deviled Eggs...probably the best I've ever had. Great combination of mustard, mayo, cayenne pepper, lemon, chives, and salt&pepper to taste. The next dishes that came was the CHARBROILED BURGER WITH SHOESTRING FRIES and the CUBANO SANDWICH WITH AN ARUGULA SALAD (I was hoping to order the grilled cheese but it was sadly sold out which was very disappointing). The burger had a lot of blue cheese that kind of overpowered the flavor and it was a bit much. Also, they should note that there are no vegetables in the burger...its just a patty and blue cheese. The shoe string fries were delicious with its touch of rosemary and on the crispier side (which I prefer). The cubano sandwich was good as well with its capers and pork. However, it definitely didnt seem like anything special and the side arugula salad was very small and only dressed with some sort of lemon juice. All in all, the food was very so so. The sandwiches/burgers were underhwleming and seemed like something I can get at a local deli or burger shop.

Last night as we walked up to the restaurant my heart dropped. Line out the door to talk to the hostess.. No such luck. So we went and posted up on a stoop down the street to figure out our next move. I had a feeling that maybe we should go check the bar seating in the spotted pig again justttt in case. We walked back up and the crowd was gone. We walked to the bar and two ladies were JUST getting up and offered us their seats. It was a miracle! We were so excited we literally high fived each other in the middle of the restaurant :)Ok now to what you really care about.. The food. My expectations were high and I was not disappointed. First we started out with 6 oysters from Washington. Mmmm they were meaty and briney and delicious. Next up was the Devils on horseback aka bacon wrapped dates. The sauce they came in was smokey and delicious. I could have eaten a full plate of these. Next up was our bartenders recommendation. The burrata appetizer with roasted mushrooms. Wow this was delicious. The mushrooms were perfectly cooked and went perfectly with the crusty toast and I think arugula salad.Now I have heard that the ricotta gnudi here would change my life and I was not disappointed. Wowwww is the only word I can use to describe it. I mean the sauce is essentially butter and more butter but I could have licked that plate clean. Best gnudi I've ever had hands down. Lastly we had to order the famous burger. It was our first time here and those shoestring fries looked so good. What can I say about this burger? It was good. Nothing to write home about or go out of my way to get. I've had better burgers. The shoestring fries were the real star here. Tossed with rosemary and crisped to perfection. I can tell why this place started the upscale gastropub movement in NYC. It really is a special place.

David Schwimmer, Michael Stipe or Luke Wilson among others.It is worth the wait.  We, however, got lucky and were able to get a table right away (a late Tuesday afternoon.)  Our table felt more like we were dining in a garden.  Potted plants and flowers line the window sills that mirror the entrance.  A tiny bar and dining room downstairs and a bigger bar/dining area upstairs.We were having a girls lunch out and we couldn't have picked a better spot.  Order a pot of pickles, a plate of deviled eggs or the Chicken Liver Toast while you wait for the main course.My companion (my Mother) has come back for the Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Mustard and Onion Marmalade.  This is not your average grilled cheese- toasted on thick bread with gourmet cheese dripping down the sides (don't even know what kind of cheese they use but we didn't care- it was delicious.)The fries are a la carte.  But the portion is enormous so no need to have everyone at the table order their own.  Thin shoestring fries served with fresh rosemary.  Go ahead- dip them in the side of the onion marmalade or the spicy mustard that came on the side of the grilled cheese sandwich.  Your taste buds can thank me later.  You're welcome.I ordered the Burrata with Wild Mushrooms on Toast.  Burrata is a soft Italian cheese made from Mozzarella and cream that just oozed across my thick cut toast.  Topped with a variety of wild mushrooms including the Maitake or the ""dancing mushroom"", this was comfort food at its finest.We also ordered a side of the beets and greens.  Whole baby beets, roasted and mixed with bitter greens.  You will never turn up your nose at beets again and  I can now say I have experienced bitter greens that literally melted in my mouth.Forget I even mentioned Jay-Z.  British Chef April Bloomfield was recently on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon as well as the Today show. The Spotted Pig has been featured in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The New Yorker, The Los Angeles Times, Bon Appetit and now, lucky for them, here on The Hungry Sprout.  Or I guess lucky for me for being able to experience this.Did I mention they have even been awarded a Michelin star which is a top honor given to only the best of the best restaurants in the world?  Ya, they have one of those too.My only complaint is the lack of space for tables.  Some of the tables are very close together and you may find yourself sitting almost on top of the strangers sitting next to you.Then again, forget you read this.  I don't want to have to wait for a table in line behind you.......",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

When I eat food at my father and stepmother's house, I get sad. Their food is chronically undersalted in a healthful way, and I struggle through it. I literally will eat Maldon flake sea salt on its own when I'm cooking with it. And I could practically drink soy sauce. I just love salt that much. Ok, so I love salt. But the food at The Spotted Pig is so insanely salty, it verges on inedible. It's a delicious proximity, taking me right to the brink of salt sanity. But in the end, it's just way too freaking salty. And this is from someone who loves salt!I used to live around the corner from this place 7, 8 years ago. I thought back then it was too salty. I distinctly remember my last visit just being overwhelmed by salt. So I took a hiatus, moved to another borough, and stayed away from the Spotted Pig for many, many years. A few weeks ago my husband and I found ourselves starving after a trip to the Whitney and I said, ""Hey, how about the Spotted Pig?"" The salty memory of my last visit was burned in my mind, but I so badly wanted to give it another go. I had loved it so much when I lived nearby.We had the burger, and the smoked haddock chowder (gotta love how the menu does not change here, this was another one of my favorite dishes back when), and some deviled eggs. But again... the food was...SO SALTY it verged on inedible. How does someone who does not love salt like me even eat this stuff? (I'm literally sitting here salting my food as I write this. I cannot overstate my love of salt.) I thought maybe my last visit was a bad day in the kitchen but fast forward 8 years and everything's the same... the decor, the menu, and THE SALT!!!The burger was solidly good and cooked to perfection but the bun really left something to be desired. It was so dry. And the cheese. SO salty. The chowder was ace. But so salty. Actually the deviled eggs were great.

The last visit in particular, was largely the most unpleasant dinner experience I have ever wrote about on yelp.It was a weekend night. The staff was running around completely overwhelmed. The host at the entrance didn't know what he was doing. Called us back 2 hours before he had initially predicted, but then made us wait for 40 minutes in the middle of staff hurrying back and forth before giving us our table. He passively-aggressively suggested that it was our fault, for taking 12 minutes to walk back to the restaurant, while they allow 10, so our table had been given away in the meantime...Take away message: we're trying to cram every inch of our establishment with as many wallets as we can, and squeeze every wallet as hard as possible.Once at the table, the waitress said they had no specials for the evening. Another disappointment that seems very indicative of what is going on generally in the restaurant: an absence of creative drive, no interest in captivating the guests, in one word, laziness. Take the burger for instance. Come on. It is neither great nor original. It is just a lazy attempt of being mildly provocative and imaginative. The shoestring fries do create a whimsical presentation, but they completely saturate both taste and texture. The same is for the burger itself: the outrageous amount of roquefort is not creative, it results is something heavy, boring and mono-dimensional. The meat is there only for the texture. Its taste is completely masked by the cheese and the absence of seasoning. Lazy, lazy, lazy. It's sad. The Spotted Pig we knew and loved has become a lazy flatulent swine stained with greedy disrespect towards the basic honest tenets of hospitality.

I was looking for a casual dining experience where no reservations were necessary. We went later in the evening and were lucky enough to walk right up to the downstairs bar and score the corner spot. We ended up talking for several hours and sharing some bites with the other patrons and the bartender and had a lovely dinner and some delicious cocktails. I would highly recommend this funky little spot on your next trip to the City. The deviled egg and angels on horseback were yummy and the gnudi was delicious!

477,hE5wEu8Sa1NkMLmPSWHrMQ,Pierre C.,1.0 star rating,"Why Spotted Pig:I was in the area for a hair cut and it was late, so I decided to meet a friend at Spotted Pig. I decided on Spotted Pig out of convenience rather than quality and atmosphere. I've been to Spotted Pig before, so this wasn't my first time dining and drinking at Spotted Pig. Wait time:We walked in and waited 15 minutes before being seated. We ordered some libations at the bar while waiting. Side note, the maitre d (I use this term loosely) was hunched over looking down the entire time he took our name and asked us to wait.  Overall impressions:The place is a dump with service equivalent to a junior high school cafeteria staff - I apologize for comparing the wonderful cateteria staff to those at Spotted Pig. Outside of the bartender, who was professional, the rest of the staff looked miserable and indifferent. Perhaps Spotted Pig is a stepping stone to bigger and better things. I don't think it is difficult for someone to just do their job. I don't expect any extra service, but I do expect someone to make sure my food is eatable, satisfactory, and hopefully not insult me.Atmosphere:Mostly tourist with a few locals - 80/20 respectively. Since I'm not a regular my comment is base on the 90 minutes while in the eatablishment - Sunday late afternoon.Service: Bartender was great, she was very professional. Our male waiter was a dud. I hope he finds peace in his life. Beside our table he was indifferent towards all the table tops in his zone. Since all the other table tops around us were tourist, they didn't mind his attitude.Would I return or recommend: Never....not even during a zombie apocalypse and Spotted Pig is the only a safe zone within 100 mile radius.The menu is stale and hasn't been updated. I just seems I've seen the same dishes on the menu and they get worse every year.Food: Thing we ordered:Haddock Chowder with Pancetta ... Impression, if this dish was a car it would be missing an engine and wheels. I couldn't see any remnants of a fish and pancetta. Ironically, pancetta is salty and has a strong flavor when added to soup base.  My dish has as my bacon as a veggie burger. This was the worse chowder I've eaten. I would have been better buying a can of soup from the local market and microwaving it. Pork Rillette with Mustard, Pickles, and Toast: The pork rillette was the best dish we order. The rillette has a good consistency and nice flavour. Downside, the toast was burnt... not char but burnt like a fire log. We asked the bust boy for another side of toast.  After waiting 20 minutes for our new side of toast we realized it was burnt too. Again, not char which is the proper and expected result... but BURNT like a fire log. I would assume after several years of this dish being on the menu the kitchen would know how to char toast. More important and a comment about the service staff, they served burnt toast to a customer.  If you perform a statistical analysis and moved your alpha to .01, i don't think you would have anyone in a sample who wants to eat burnt toast.Chargrilled Burger:Nothing special.  The shoe-string fried are too greasy and lack flavors. Fires were the worst part of this dish. Overall, they dump a bucket of greasy shoestring fries on your plate. They should be ashamed for dishonouring the term gastro-pub. How much does it cost to combine some herbs, salt, and peppers to make a bucket of seasoning.Drink: Stated earlier. Drinks are not too bad. We ordered a total of 4 cocktails from the drink menu. My favorite drinks were Nelson's Folly and Don Felipe.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I will put out that disclaimer that I felt like the roquefort cheese on the burger has a similar taste to a stinky old bleu cheese, so if that's not you're thing then maybe give something else on the menu a try. Personally, I really liked it but I know that's not for everyone. My date opted for the scallops which were really tasty and a great lighter option to balance out the heavy burger.As good as the food was, my favorite thing about this place is the ambiance. We were seated upstairs which was so charming and full of life. On a Friday night the bar was packed with people grabbing drinks and every seat in the restaurant was taken. This made for some great people watching, perfectly back dropped by the cute and kitschy decor.

To start off there will always be a wait for brunch so be prepared to maybe do some shopping on Bleeker to kill time. Seating definitely isn't the most comfortable as my mom and I were crammed in between people and I was left to sit on an actual stool... We order a bunch of things: The chicken liver, Grilled cheese, deviled eggs, and the burger. I will say the chicken liver over toast was so good my eyes rolled back lol. I live pate and foie gras and that was probably the best liver I had ever had. The devil eggs (don't really eat them ever) were also delicious. My mom's grilled cheese was killer especially with that onion jam spread... What a home run dish! Now when it came to the burger the patty was good and cooked perfectly... but definitely not worth$25! I mean it was just a good patty and I didn't have that cheese on it cause I hate blue cheese. But I am also a fan of all kinds of toppings on my burger so to me it was very bland (would give the burger 3 stars by itself)...

My friend had to pull the table so I could get out of my corner. The famous roquefort burger which 75% of patrons order was interesting at best and mediocre at worst. I actually love roquefort cheese but I just didn't like it with the burger. The fries were actually pretty good and unique. The burger was massive, no actually the whole plate was ginormous. But the only reason I was able to come close to cleaning my plate was the hot sauce I smothered my burger and fries with. Without that hot sauce, I would've stopped 5-6 bites in.The devil's horseback, plum wrapped in bacon, was also disappointing.

I decided that I wanted to try The Spotted Pig for brunch for my first time. Upon arrival, of course there was a wait. Luckily we nabbed a spot by the window. It was a little tight but perfect for the two of us. Unfortunately, we had to watch trash being taken out and cooks bringing food in and out, but given that there was no wait time involved, we counted our blessings and were grateful to eat soon. We started with bloody marys, which come with some nice pickled veggies, and some deviled eggs. The deviled eggs were a little oily albeit delicious. We ordered the infamous roquefort burger with shoestring fries and knew we wanted to share, but we wanted a little something else. Our waitress recommended the burrata with roasted wild mushrooms to start. Best. Decision Ever. The burrata was soft and delicious, and the wild mushrooms were so aromatic with the perfect hint of acid to bring a bright flavor. We had ordered the burger medium rare, and unfortunately The Spotted Pig loses a star for serving us a medium well burger. Huge pet peeve of mine, especially when you're paying over $20 for a burger. Don't get me wrong, it was still delicious, and we're not the type to complain to our server (considering how long things can take in NYC). While the first couple of bites of shoestring fries are crisp and delicious, when you get a huge pile, the bottom is always lackluster by the time you get to it.

Seriously, it's not good or even worth waiting hours for. I had to wipe off all the blue cheese from my burger just so I was able to finish it. Also, the large portion of fries is impressive, but it's so difficult to eat because they're way too thin.

490,1sxXLUKn6qCCVRJPhRNVYQ,Ken S.,4.0 star rating,"KenScale: 8.5/10The Spotted Pig is probably the most well-known gastropub in NYC, period. Getting a reservation at this restaurant helmed by chef April Bloomfield is notoriously difficult at this restaurant that doesn't take reservations (last time I checked in, I was given a wait time of two hours, so I didn't get nearby since then knowing that, although I would be more than happy to wait, my friend(s) who join me would probably lose patience). Lately, I had a opportunity to go on a pretty early dinner, so I decided to use that opportunity to finally check this restaurant out. The dinner time starts at 5:30 p.m., and I walked in for some beer and wrote my name down at 5 p.m. I was not impressed with the other restaurant led by chef Bloomfield in the city (The Breslin) other than their famed lamb burger, so I tried to manage my expectations, Fortunately, there were truly outstanding winners coming out from the kitchen, and the best dish wasn't the famed burger.I started out with a bunch of bar snacks. Deviled egg was tasty and so were the greasy devils on horseback wrapped in bacon. My winner, though, was the chicken liver toast that was absolutely delicious with great balance of flavor. While everyone is talking about the burger here and all the tables I've seen ordered at least one (more on the burger later), my favorite dish of the night was the simple-looking yet truly outstanding sheep's milk ricotta gnudi with brown butter and crispy sage. The ricotta inside was just pure decadence and I can't stop thinking about that dish with soft texture with bold flavor. Yes, the burger was also great, but I think it could've tasted even better without the roquefort cheese whose strong flavor somewhat undermined the juicy texture of the meat. While I understand where the hype is coming from, I wouldn't call this burger the best thing that happened to NYC. I was beyond stuffed by the time I finished the burger, but wanted to try at least one dessert. I'm so glad I did because the seasonal tart that came with bananas was one of the best tarts I've had in a while, with awesome flavor working very well with the silky smooth bananas without being overly sweet.Your best bet to get seated at The Spotted Pig is to show up 1-2 minutes before 5 p.m., write your name down and hope for the best when the dinner service starts at 5:30 p.m. There is just no other way! I liked the charming, divey gastropub feel of the restaurant with tons of pig figures on the wall. The restaurant has a full bar with nicely prepared classic cocktails (my favorite was Manhattan), so either go with some cocktails or brews to wash down the food. The Spotted Pig certainly lived up to its expectations, and I'll certainly come back next time I want to have a casual pub food night with bold flavor and skillful execution.

Also, those shoestring fries are absolutely worthless.I almost felt like this was 3-star worthy, but that was mostly because of the slight let down feeling I had after reading endlessly about this burger on every list of best burgers ever and seeing all of the rave reviews about the restaurant everywhere you look.But the food here is actually really good. Except for those silly shoestring fries (sorry, I just really don't get those).With the reputation preceding this place, I thought I was slick going on a Monday to avoid the crowds and the long waits, but no such luck. Well, we actually got there at a little before 1 PM, and had to wait about 25 minutes for a table, which I guess could have been a lot worse if we went during the weekend. Actually, toward the end of our wait, we already heard the host quoting 45 minutes to an hour wait times even for parties of two. Insane.It's a very hip atmosphere. The stools in place of proper chairs for all the seating is always a dead giveaway for that. My wife likes a back to her seat when she eats, so she was pleased when we were led to our table on the second floor in a cozy little area of the restaurant where there are some benches for same-side table seating against the walls. The entire place also has a nice fun motif of pig decorations everywhere, from nice pig paintings to little pig signs on the bathrooms. The place happens to pull off a kitschy vibe while also being classy/hipster at the same time.So if you come here and don't order the burger, you are a failure. To start, it also seems like the other thing people can't stop whining about is the Deviled Egg ($4). This was OK I guess. Mad oily, and nothing mind-blowing (yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…). We also got the Chicken Liver Toast ($6). This was also extremely rich and heavy, but was delicious.Now, the burger. It's a really thick, sizable patty which is great. The roll is nice and thick and tasty, which is great, and very important so it can soak up all that juice from the meat and not get soggy. The Roquefort cheese didn't really do it for me. It was a little too funky. That little bit aside though, I do concur that this is a very excellent burger. But its not as transcendent as all of these other chefs and food bloggers would lead you to believe.The shoestrings fries are a real waste of time and stomach space. Aside from the huge pile of them looking kind of cool and making for a pretty picture next to the huge burger (yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…), they really have no culinary or enjoyment value at all. They're really hard to eat and are not particularly tasty. To even taste them, you've gotta get a good fistful of them in your mouth at once since they're so thin on their own, which is a real mess and pretty embarrassing as you can feel the other hipsters watching you make a pig out of yourself.Another reason I came on Monday instead of the weekend was to try the Cubano Sandwich ($18) since I love Cuban sandwiches and this one looked really good and they don't have it on the weekend brunch menu. It did not disappoint. In fact, this might have been even more enjoyable than the burger for me, though it came with an equally forgettable side that was also a waste of time, some greens dressed in oil.Lastly, we ended with the Banoffee Pie ($8) (yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…). This was truly incredible. Composed of layers of dulce de leche, pastry cream, sliced bananas and whipped cream, this really shows that they know what they're doing here. One of the tastiest desserts I've had.This probably sounds like a lot of complaining for a 4-star review. But it's just that I expected more after all the hype. All of the food really is excellent. You definitely need to come here at least once to try that burger (don't waste yourself on the fries though).",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"
504,oZ4iTR4Yc2ZCdohN2P3ytw,Jennifer M.,4.0 star rating,"Came here with a group of 6 on Saturday night around 6pm exact, and was told that the waiting list for a table was 2 hours. Of course our party didn't believe it. They were plenty of tables open on the second floor so we knew that they were pretty conservative about telling people how long they would have to wait. I'm pretty sure it's also a tactic so that it turns a few percentage of people away because of their no reservation policy. So roughly about an hour later we get seated upstairs by the bar. I totally understand why some people get a little annoyed at the seating arrangements. It's a little too close for comfort, but I didn't really mind it since I was with family. Overall food impressions? Food was really good!!!!  The CHICKEN LIVER TOAST, the OYSTERS, CRISPY PIG'S EAR SALAD, they were all amazing. I had shared the LAMB SHANK FOR TWO with a cousin of mine and it was phenomenal! I don't usually order lamb or eat it for that matter, but it was fall off the bone amazing! NOTE:*******I did try a bite of their BURGER that everyone seems to notoriously order here. Although it seems to be the plainest thing on the menu, that Roquefort cheese is mighty powerful, So I highly don't recommend it if you're not a stinky cheese person. There are so many things on the menu that are actually better than the burger.Drawbacks to this place? Service is a little long between courses.Torn between the Spotted Pig and the Breslin?

We were fortunate to find spots at the bar upstairs and ordered skimpy $15 mimosas. Got a table on schedule. I ordered a burger and was anticipating the delicious mound of shoestring fries. After another 45 minutes our food arrived and my burger that was ordered medium . Came out very rare. Though by this time I was famished, I sent it back.  The waitress seemed pissed. When it finally returned it was dry well done and  on a charred bun without any dressing or condiments. I finally found someone to ask if I could have the blue cheese that was supposed to accompany it.  I was brought a small dish of blue cheese.  Overall lousy service and the worst burger I ever had( didn't eat).

Finally. We quickly ordered two burgers with fries that was apparently so good and famous. When the food came, I ritually took several pictures and posted on Instagram with a caption ""better be worth the wait""I took a huge bite out of the burger expecting something amazing. Then I proceeded to add another comment to my post, ""not worth it.""The cheese was too strong for me. I probably would have loved it if it wasn't for the cheese.

517,-eQIn-rYsqG9zLTNA0xvAg,Shannon W.,3.0 star rating,"What a cool, fun, trendy, hip, very 'West Village like' spot. I loved the large pig posters that align the entire restaurant. My only gripe...it's so crowded you can't move and it seems there's always a 2 hour wait here for a seat. Plus, the upstairs bathroom is super small & hard to find, 2 stalls, coed, and dark. Neither here nor there. Moving on, we walked in on Saturday around 6pm and I thought, it's early enough, there should be seating...haha. There was a ton of seats available too, but they told us there was a 2 hour wait. Since the downstairs bar was packed, we decided to walk upstairs and hover over some people at the bar until they left. I ordered a Novo Mundo cocktail to start, the bartenders here really do know their drinks and know how to make a mean cocktail. The drink was awesome. We also ordered the ""Devils on Horseback"" app to start...(date stuffed with a smoked almond  wrapped in bacon), they came 4-5 to a plate with a tasty brown sugar, ginger, sauce on the side. I'm not a huge pork fan, but with a name like the Spotted Pig, you have to assume everything is coming with bacon. The bacon was a bit fatty for my liking, but the app was tasty. I paired the dish with a glass of Sauv Blanc, which was delicious. We also ordered the chicken liver toast with came with 2 pieces of toasted bread and a ton of chicken liver mousse on top. It was tasty. Again, would not  advise coming here if you're a vegetarian. I thought it was interesting how they have a woman at the bar upstairs putting food together and a little oven to cook food, so that it comes out right away. After about an hour two girls left and we snagged their bar seats. (There are maybe 8/10 bar seats max). We then ordered the Seared Mackerel with sweet potato mash for a main meal (I .don't eat beef but if I did, I would have ordered the burger as almost every person here had ordered the burger) The fish was flaky and fresh and the sweet potato mash was tasty. I didn't think the bacon they put on top of the fish was really necessary and the bacon was a bit overcooked. I like bacon crunchy if I'm going to eat it. We also ordered the brussel sprouts as a side dish, it was okay. I thought the brussel sprouts could have been cooked a little bit more and overall, they were a bit bland. The dish also came with pieces of pork, I think small pieces of crunchy bacon would have been better. I had the mulled wine after dinner which was absolutely delicious, especially on a cold winter day. Hot spiced wine with brandy, orange, and winter spices. Delish. While we were sitting there, the bartenders were making a ton of unique cocktails, I wanted to drink the whole bar! Overall synopsis: Young, trendy crowd Food is good, very meaty.

Thankfully, they have a texting service, so went around the corner to the historic (cash only) White Horse Tavern for a drink while we waited.

The service was good, though, and despite the volume, was quick.We started out with Devils on Horseback (prunes wrapped in bacon) and an unlisted beef medallions in a cheese sauce. Our friend got the Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi with Brown Butter & Sage and my wife and I each for the Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestring Fries.

The food was hit or miss. Burger is decent, though I am aware it's touted as one of the best. The meat is very good quality, seasoned well and cooked to order, but was overshadowed by the generous smear of roquefort cheese. The fries are more like potato stix and, while plentiful, were cumbersome to eat. Even so, I ate it all because it's potatoes and salt and why the hell wouldn't I? We had the pot of pickles and brussels sprouts as appetizers. Both were very small and I think not worth it. I'd still go back for the food, but this is the type of meal that makes me think of restaurants that rely on their hype to drive business and prices, instead of the quality that caused the hype in the first place, as restaurants in NYC are wont to do.

But since this place has been on my ""To-try list' for quite some time now, and we weren't thatt hungry, so we decided to just walk around the serene neighbourhood, while join the hype to be on the waitlist.When it was our time to get seated, the hostess greeted us with an annoyed attitude. I get it, I would be too if I have to deal with this amount of people all day long - but it just wasn't a pleasant experience for any customers; especially right after we have waited 90 minutes for a table! Anyways, I were sat at a dark corner at a small table, it was small and cramped, and the only light source was from this tiny candle on our table, I could barely tell the colour of my water. At this point, we already know the wait was not worth it, but we tried to make the best out of the night, and ordered the most praised items: the chicken liver toast and the center-of-attention Burger with shoestring fries. The chicken liver toasts were good, it was the right amount of savory and saltiness, it also has a good texture and wasn't too pasty. After that, we waited 45 minutes for the burger to come out, and it was again a disappointment. The burger was just a regular burger with roquefort cheese, it created a nice mix of salty, and tangy flavor to the burger, but it really isn't that amusing and is far from the best. They also seemed to mixed fries from different batches, some are crunchy and fresh, while some are cold and soggy. After 2 bites, we dashed out of this place, it wasn't worth the time.

I love the decor of the restaurant. It's laid back in here. We started off at the bar but as tables started to clear, our server moved us. That was sweet of her. She was friendly and quick. Service was not all that attentive but nothing too bad. Everything we ordered was memorable. The Deviled Eggs were excellent. Soft and smooth egg seasoned to perfection. The creamy filling had a slight tang. The Lemon Ricotta Pancake with Candied Almonds had a lovely consistency. Lightly crisp on the edges, fluffy/cakey middle, not too heavy and sweet. The almonds added a nice crunchy consistency. On top, dollops of creamy ricotta. Completed with a dust of powdered sugar and thin slices of mint. Gave the dish a sweet and cooling element. Highly recommended.With so many reviews mentioning the Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese, I was a bit afraid of the hype. My fellow Yelpers didn't let me down. It's delicious. It's not super dressed up with tomatoes, lettuce and onions. The toasty bun is soft in the middle. The meat patty is nicely charred which gives it a beautiful smokey flavor. Juicy in the middle and well seasoned. The meat patty is topped with creamy, sweet, salty and smokey Roquefort Cheese. Simple and delicious.

My suggestion if you're not a blue cheese fan is to ask for the cheese on the side. It let me try a bit of it and I could how much (or little) I wanted to the burger. We ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. Patty quality was great. Cost is $22 so it's not cheap, but a better burger than I've had at other spots that charge even more.We sat downstairs - really cute place when it's quiet and I'd suggest going early as they don't take reservations. Definitely will come back to try other items on the menu - but this burger is on my top NY-burger list.

538,UGplSQK4-sZDCW38HtK5Xg,Katrina C.,4.0 star rating,"Went here on a busy Friday, about an hour's wait for 2 people. Not horrible for a Friday at a popular restaurant, so we meandered around the village for a while which is easy enough as there's plenty of shops to check out in the area while you wait, not to mention the Gansevoort market if you don't mind being tempted by lots of delicious food while you wait for your table to be ready. First off, the ambiance is very cute, the lighting is pleasantly orange. However, the seating is downright awful. You are going to be sitting on a backless stool while you eat your dinner. I can deal, but dang was that uncomfortable. They have a few booths to sit in, but there's no guarantees which table you'll get. Second off, it was a fairly warm autumn day in the city, but the restaurant was quite warm inside. I was wearing a sweater dress and I had to tie my hair up and roll up my sleeves so as to not overheat. The food was pretty good. The chicken liver toast was probably my favorite part of the meal, and the shoestring fries that came with my burger were a close second. I could eat those things all day. The burger itself came rare when I asked for medium, but I can deal with that. Someone less forgiving than me may have sent it back, but whatevs. It was tasty, even though I'm not a big fan of Roquefort cheese. In the end I took the cheese off the burger. And everything was so, so salty. Fortunately they are very good at refilling your water glass! We got the gnudi as well, which was tasty and the presentation was very pretty. Be forewarned though, the cheese in the gnudi is very very strong. Overall good, not mind blowing, but a tasty meal.

According to the website, dinner service starts at 5:30. Me and my boyfriend got there Sunday evening a few minutes after 5:30 not expecting too much of a wait. In fact, it was a 30 minute wait. However, the host took down my phone number and they would text me when my table was ready. The bar was pretty crowded so we went to a wine bar nearby for a drink. The wait ended up being less than 30 minutes.Me and my boyfriend were seated upstairs in an alcove area that had 6-7 tables of 2, but it seemed like an area where they seated all couples. Service was really slow, which is where they lost a star. The waitress brought around water fairly quickly, but soon after that is where service went downhill. It took a while for them to take our order. None of the appetizers on the menu appealed to me, but after sitting around and waiting for my burger, I looked around and noticed the board with the specials written out that was out of my sight. I definitely would have ordered some of their specials, but the waitress did not mention anything about specials to us. The wait to get our burger was really long - waited upwards to maybe 30 minutes. I had my burger was served with no cheese. Just the beef patty and bun. The patty was so juicy and tasty, meeting and surpassing my expectations. I usually like ketchup on my burger but this didn't need any. The shoestring fries were crispy and delicious. Besides the service, I have no complaints about the food itself. I would definitely recommend getting here early.

I would have rated my first time 4 stars based on the food and drinks. I now give it one star because of the horrendous customer service experience me and my friend received the other night. A group of our friends arrived earlier than us and were seated. Getting a seat for me and my friend turned out to be the issue. The hostess was extremely rude, taking out her frustrations on me and my friend based on my other friends demanding attitude which I came to find out later on. My friend told us to sit at the table next to theirs. The hostess snatched the menu out of my friends hands and said that we shouldn't have sat ourselves. **Just thinking about this boils my blood**....anyway...My friend asks to speak to the manager to explain what just happened.Manager comes over, straight faced, and my friend reaches out to give him a handshake and introduce himself. The manager completely ignores it. My friend proceeds to explain what happened and the manager asks ""what do you want me to do?"". My friend explains that usually when a customer is having a bad experience, it is customary to advise the manager (stating the obvious). The manager then says, ""okay is that all?"". Me and my friend were shocked and confused. We literally could not think of anything else to say. What else can you say other than your basic instinct to curse them out! The manager ends with saying ""have a great dinner"". Nothing was done or resolved. We got up, left our friends, and ate a pub nearby (which turned out to be a good experience). We REFUSED to spend a penny at that place. I will NEVER go there again just based on that experience alone. There are so many great restaurants in the city to take my out-of-town friends and family.

We sat along the window, a small cozy 2 top. The seats don't have backs, which could be uncomfortable if you plan on sitting for a while (we were there for 2 hours).$14 for an okay Negroni seemed ridiculous, but the $10 mug of cask beer was on point.

I went on a Sunday around 11:30 and we were incredibly lucky that they had a table for us at that time, since it's super popular and super small. I didn't have anything to drink but if I was interested in a cocktail, that bloody mary looked deeeeeelicious. Plus they're meant to have cool drinks and good beer. The chicken liver toasts were like dinosaur liver toasts. Sean ordered the Dutch pancakes with bacon and maple (which is something he would never normally order) and I wanted to try the burger and the frittata and grilled cheese so the rest of us ordered those to share. Plus I ordered the chicken liver toasts for the table because that's like a thing here. THEN Sean saw the chicken liver toasts and he was like ""oh, perfect I'm going to eat this instead and not eat any of the thing I ordered which nobody else wants ok cool this is great that worked out so well for me"" and I was like ""um, whatever I don't even like liver"" so it was fine. But I was like...c'mon son. The ""fries"" that come with the burger are more like the potato sticks that I used to eat when I was little at my grandpa's house. The ones that come out of a can. Yeah they're mostly akin to that. They are not fries. Next time I'll try a different side that I will actually eat. They look more beautiful than they taste and more beautiful than I can ever look while attempting to cascade tiny ass light ass shoestring ""fries"" chip sticks into my mouth. The burger was undercooked but still delicious. I'm pretty sure the grilled cheese was made by like a priest or some sort of holy figure.

Getting a table was a cinch late on a Tuesday evening - we walked right in! True to the name, the place is so cute and porky. Lots of piggy trinkets everywhere, low lighting, and a very laid-back vibe. The service was instantly wonderful and remained so throughout the meal. I immediately ordered a Manhattan, which was perfection, and perused the menu. We ordered a soup special with butternut, barley, and lovely spices. It was the best squash soup I've ever had! Next was the stracciatella, a thick slice of grilled bread covered in melty cheese and luscious mushrooms. One of my dining companions who typically hates mushrooms was as in love with this dish as I was! We also shared the burger and the seared scallops with crispy kale and delicata. I can't say anything more without professing our utter obsession with the amazingly crispy garlic rosemary shoestring fries! They were so good that we ordered a second round. The texture and flavors were intoxicating, from the fragrant rosemary to the salty and ever-so-light potatoes. I hate to say it but they overshadowed the burger, which was good but not memorable. It's a plain burger with a smear of stinky cheese on a grilled bun. My companions didn't like it at all, but I ate a quarter of it and enjoyed it.Can't wait to return next time I'm in the city!

When I had about a fourth of the burger left, I scraped off the cheese because I just couldn't handle it anymore. The bun was nothing special.The fries were OK, but they were more of a nuisance than anything else. How does one eat those fries without looking/feeling like a crazy person? At some point, you end up shoveling fistfuls of fries in your mouth like a barbarian. Not attractive.The deviled eggs were great though! And so was the service.

If you like your burger like you like your (wo)men - strong, intense Roquefort cheese, totally bare bones with no lettuce or tomato or onion.

The Burger: A salty bomb of deliciousness that melts instantly as it touches your mouth. It's on par with the Breslin burger, which came as no surprise after reading the chef bio's. This alone is worthy of one of their Michelin stars.Fries (come with burger): Perfectly salted and crisp. The fried rosemary and garlic adds a flavorful pop without being overpowering. The Market Salad: the lettuce was fresh and the pomegranate was a nice touch, but I found the salad to be boring. It was missing the flavor of a good dressing. Would have tried a different salad if choosing from the dinner menu. Service: I love that we were able to be seated so quickly. Definitely picked a good time to stop in.

The deviled eggs and devils on horseback really don't get much better. The burger was very good, but was a little surprised that it has gotten so much hype. That said, the fries are the star.

This place has been known to have insanely long wait times, but if you come for brunch or lunch right when they open you may get lucky like us and the restaurant will have lots of open tables.Order the Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestring Fries. It's made from marbled chuck, short loin, and brisket.  They char-grill this patty and top it with Roquefort blue cheese and snuggle it up with a charred brioche bun.  I'm a sucker for bleu cheese and the kind they use here is possibly the best I've ever had.

Once it was 10 seconds to midnight, one of the employees started counting down. As we were looking around expecting champagne, she rushed to the kitchen. All the servers and kitchen staff were in there, with champagne in hand. For about 10 minutes, they drank champagne and celebrated, while we watched them. Nothing for the custumers. It was ridiculously unprofessional. Half an hour later, when we could finally get a hold of our server, we asked her what happened with the champagne, she was like ""oh nobody served you? Sorry about that"" as if SHE wasn't our server. She brought three glasses. All the sparkle of the champagne was gone. Probably the bottle was opened hours ago.

April Bloomfield's charming space in the West Village is regarded as NYC's first gastropub.

This simple concoction is sandwiched between nicely grilled Brioche buns and served with fries. Whoa! This is a great burger. It's juicy and packed with flavor, mostly from the cheese, but nevertheless, this more than hit the spot after a drunken debauchery.  But what really, really made me happy was the mountain of shoestring fries.  Endless strings of salty, rosemary herbed potatoes!!!  You pick up a bunch, tip your head back and let the crunchy potatoes sink into your mouth.  Sooo superbly addicting, we ordered another one, since obviously, one mountain of potatoes isn't enough for me.

This was a very smooth tasting burger. However, this was only determined by eating parts of the burger not covered in the Roquefort cheese. The cheese overpowered the mild beef. The seasoning was appropriate to the mild flavors of the beef. The savory blend was applied as the patty cooked, and and it served to round out the mild flavors of the carefully constructed burger.

Didn't try the renowned burger but I saw it all around, topped with hills of stringy fries.  Looked delish.  People seemed to enjoy putting in their mouths.Dessert is a no brainer:Banoffee pie.A British invention, it's a banana toffee pie and it must be ordered despite its ridiculous and ambiguous name.  (Ambiguous because, lacking any other context, it could be a banana coffee pie and... wait, why is that not a thing?  That sounds great.)  Things like this pie are one of the many reasons our stomachs are flexible.  Whatever you ate and drank beforehand, however you feel, however bad an idea it may be to order a dessert, just shut up and order it and then shove it in your mouth, safe in the knowledge that your stomach will almost certainly stretch to accommodate it.  Someday, perhaps someday soon, all hell's gonna break loose.  Political or environmental disaster will be upon us.  Cities will topple.  Land masses will flood.  Regimes will rise that will most certainly not be pie friendly.  And you--YOU!--will be left cold, scared, perhaps injured and perhaps alone, and you will stare out at the apocalypse around you and note the chemically and syrupy atmosphere, and your heart will sink with the recognition that on top of all the other things that are horrible, it is now also true that you are unlikely to ever again have the opportunity to eat this pie nor, indeed, any other pie.Anyway Spotted Pig's a cool spot and I'd come back for lunch or dinner.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Let me preface this review by stating that this delicious gastropub is expensive ($25 for their famous burger). However, if the food I'm paying for is amazing, I'm not going to knock stars off simply for price. My boyfriend and I started the night off at the bar downstairs - I ordered a cider and he the Speckled Hen. My boyfriend was ecstatic that they had the Speckled Hen on tap. We spent a few months living in London and the Speckled Hen was one of his favorite beers from the U.K. I'm not a beer drinker, but he said it tasted exactly like it had in London and was very happy to start off our dinner with it. My cider was delicious and crisp and when I hadn't finished it when it came time to be seated, the wait staff brought up my glass (and our tab) with us when we moved to our table upstairs. My boyfriend and I started off with the cheese platter special and the fish chowder. The cheese was good, noting to blow your socks off. However, the chowder was one of the best chowders I've ever had, hands down. We had agreed to split the chowder as an appetizer, but we almost ordered another one - it was that good. For dinner my boyfriend ordered the steak and I ordered the burger with shoestring fries (I asked for no bun). My boyfriend loved his steak and was excited by the unusual but delicious flavors paired with it. My burger was unreal. No ketchup or mustard needed, the cheese and seasoning on it is perfect and they cooked it exactly to my liking (medium rare). The fries were also delicious and fun to eat - the mustard they give you for dipping is spicy, but so good I couldn't stop myself, even though I can't handle spice.

So me and my friend finally made it here and waited around an hour and a half on a saturday night as they don't take reservations. We expected that sort of wait so we didn't mind and did what anyone else would do with time to kill, find a bar and have a drink. We were seated and I was a bit surprised at how small the place is but by keeping it small they can keep their eye on what's important which is the quality and taste of the food. So I made the best life decision to get the chicken liver toast, I really really like chicken livers and my father makes the best but this place makes a chicken liver to rival the best. It was just out of control! Even if you are grossed out by the thought, be adventurous and try it, you will be rewarded with such amazing taste. For dinner i went with the burger which was so big and juicy and all sorts of yummy. I'd have to say this was one of the best meals I've had lately.

Burger was ok but at 22 bucks and with greasy unhealthy shoe string fries (nicely accented tho by fresh rosemary in the oil) - think of potato chips with a glass of Mazzola - no veggies and a butter pat of cheese all I can say is NO.

Ok what's 4 bucks but for 6 olives?  Ditto for ""pickle jar"".   Stingy portions but most perplexing why on earth have these exotic dishes with great ingredients in a dive bar setting (I hate sloppy places) served by polite polished guys AND not a thing PIG on the menu except for pork rillettes.

If you can stomach the West Village princesses, the aging frat boys, and the trying-to-still-be-hip middle-aged clientele, then I would say hang in there because the food is actually worth it. No, I did not have the burger. I could tell just by looking at it that it would not be great. A good burger, sure. But not great. So I went with the barkeep's recommendation and had the radish salad as a small plate along with my gin and tonic. And it was delicious! I am not one for overspending on simple dishes like salads, but I would go back and try this one. Somehow pressed and infused with parmesan and basil, the radishes are not spicy at all. They are fresh and crisp and have a delicious watery taste that totally charmed me. Topped with wafer-thin red onion and bright, citrusy arugula leaves, I really enjoyed the salad. Also, because I couldn't resist, I got a side of shoestring fries. The side dish portion is huge! And loaded with salt. I loved the herbs (sage? rosemary? could not tell) that they used, which I think they dropped in the fryer with the potatoes. But oh my gosh can you say salt overload? Really, I could feel my heart slow down with every mouthful of crispy potato-stix-like crunch of fries. Still quite tasty and I did almost inhale the entire bowl of fries, but sometimes, like with salt, less is more. I may go back for a drink at the bar and some small plates again, maybe the ricotta gnudi, but I honestly don't think the burger (or any of the main dishes, from the looks of them) are worth the sticker price.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

And, you know, expectations play such a big part in your impressions. If we had ""discovered"" a place like this accidentally we would have been charmed. But when it's so overhyped, it never quite measures up.Went right at 5:30 after a stroll down the High Line and the wait wasn't too bad. Had a delicious cask ale while waiting for a table. Space was crowded. We were glad to get a table with real chairs. Noticed some sitting on wooden stools with no backs. Decor was cute and kitschy - lots of pigs. Waitress was super professional, really knew her stuff, but for some reason their ""policy"" is that they won't put in the appetizer order until you have decided on the whole meal. Can't see how that helps the kitchen. Maybe they they just want to close the deal on ordering so they can be assured of turning the table.But the food was excellent and the service throughout the meal was attentive.

After a few drinks at a different pub, decided an extravagant burger is exactly the late-night food I needed.Roquefort Burger ($21), Deviled Egg ($4), Nightingale Cocktail ($13). Delicious deviled egg, cold and creamy with a nice touch of condiments on top that balanced out the yolk flavor. Cocktail was small for the price, but tasted good, although not as strong as I would have hoped.As for the burger, they actually cooked the patty correctly (not as common as you'd think), but I felt the cheese overpowered the rest of the burger. I like strong cheese, but it wasn't balanced well at all, especially since most of it was towards the middle, meaning every bite got stronger. Shoe string fries felt more like a decoration than an actual part of the meal, but decent.Nice service, quaint place, but not paying for that again.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"
607,pz3Ulbuk7ZiUUbT7oFzmpA,Lori L.,3.0 star rating,"Prior to my visit to Spotted Pig, I had gone through the countless reviews, articles, and accolades focused solely on its renowned burger; I had built it up in my mind to be, quite possibly, the best burger offered in all of Manhattan. But, let's cut to the chase. Expectations, especially those built up without substantial reason, are only doomed to fail. And similarly, Spotted Pig's burger is not life-changing, but it is a pretty solid burger. I'll give it that much.Set in a somewhat isolated and quiet street in Greenwich Village, the exterior of The Spotted Pig looks nothing like a gastropub or restaurant. After a little bit of searching for the door, I managed to put my name down on the waitlist and was given an estimated 45 minute wait. One downside is that they don't take reservations, so depending on when you decide to drop by for a meal, your wait time can be nonexistant to upwards of 1 or 2 hours. They usually recommend you grab a drink or two at the bar and provided that it isn't swarming with people (which it was on a Friday night), it may be your best option as there aren't many other places in the area for your to wile away the time.The two of us returned and were quickly shown to our table where we were seated against the wall. Tables are placed nearly side by side, and it was impossible to not overhear our neighbors' conversations; there was hardly any table space to even hold our drinks and menus either. At the very least, my friend and I had no need for the menus and were immediately ready to order; after all, we had come here just for one thing: the Chargrilled Burger.In hindsight, our plates looked far more impressive than they actually tasted. A towering pile of shoestring fries is plated next to the burger, a sizable portion of beef neatly sandwiched between two toasted brioche buns with a thin layer of melted roquefort. The shoestring fries were particularly annoying for me as it's impossible to eat more than two or three at a time and the lack of substance in each bite was particularly unsatisfying. Even more of a nuisance was the fact that the remainder of the fries were inseparable from the pile of rosemary they had been seasoned with. As for the burger - I had requested mine to be cooked to a medium and found that it had actually been cooked closer to well-done. Neither could I find anything particularly notable about the patty, except for the unique use of roquefort (as I have a particular weakness for goat cheese). Perhaps the most I can applaud this burger on was the brioche buns, which were the perfect width, smartly toasted, and with the perfect criss-cross grill pattern, although these too seemed to overwhelm the actual burger.So, while I can't personally recommend The Spotted Pig's burger (Bloomfield's burger at her other establishment, the Breslin, is close to life-changing, however), it's certainly worth a try.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

That's how we had our first meal at this very lovely restaurant. I liked the interior more than I expected -- we sat upstairs in a little room to the side, and it felt warm and inviting, and very chill. The service was nice too.  Never felt rushed.We ordered drinks at the bar downstairs, then moved upstairs once our table was ready. The food came out slowly, but not unbearably so. It took us about an hour for dinner with a drink each.Onto the food: we ordered-Squid stew appetizer -Manila clams special -Burger-Banoffee pie-EspressoI know the place is called spotted PIG, but I thought the seafood starters were great. The squid stew had delicious chunks of potatoes and some big pieces of toast to sop up the sauce. The Manila clams were perfect, a balanced but rich seafood flavor, also came with big grilled pieces of bread. The famous burger wasn't that thrilling. The cheese overwhelmed the meat, the brioche bun is a bit too big in proportion to the beef, and we left about a third of the burger on the plate. The fries taste great - I especially liked it with the malt vinegar, which is NOT the Heinz version that is everywhere else. The Banoffee pie was the perfect end to the meal. Was a relaxing way to wrap up the workweek. However, I wouldn't ever wait 2 hours for this place -- there are so many other great places to eat around here so it's not worth it.

In terms of the food, the chicken liver toast was very tasty and rich, definitely worth a try. but it all goes downhill after that.......The fish was bland, a little bit fishy and the skin is not crispy enough, definitely not worth the money. The burger was a let down mainly because of the shoestring fries. There were way too much salt and the texture was poor.

I loved it, but some people might not), and our server was nice. Our hostess? Not so much. My friend asked if it would be possible for a side of pickles for the burger (she's particular). The server said no, with no explanation. We were confused, as there was a ""pot of pickles"" as an appetizer. Turns out that appetizer is pickled vegetables, BUT they do include cornichons, though that wasn't mentioned. As the server left, my table commented on the fact that we got such a hard ""no"" on the request. The hostess, listening in, inserted herself into our conversation, stating, ""the chef is very particular and doesn't like to serve anything else with her burger."" Okay, that makes sense, and we were satisfied with the answer. Until she added, ""if you want ketchup, mustard and relish, go somewhere else."" THAT boiled my blood, as it was an unnecessary addition to her point.  Not to mention, she eavesdropped on us and decided it was the perfect time to put us in our place.So, to sum up, food's great. I'd been here many times before and enjoyed the laid back vibe at such a successful restaurant. Until now. I don't think I'll be back on this alone. There are PLENTY of wonderful places in NYC that accompany their food with wonderful staff as well.Side note - when the burger was put in front of us, the bus boy asked, ""would you like ketchup and mustard with this?""

After walking the High Line, we casually stumbled upon what I knew was the infamous Spotted Pig and I knew we had to go in for dinner. Plus, it was perfect since there just so happened to be a table for two open at that moment - extremely rare for a restaurant that I hear has some serious wait times given its recent fame and Michelin star rating. I knew instantly what I had to order: the char grilled burger with Roquefort cheese and shoestring fries. It was perfect. The burger was so simple and understated yet bursting with flavor, it's the way a burger should taste if it's done right. The patty was seasoned to perfection and grilled to a juicy medium well, which still ended up having a nice, slightly pink center. There was no mayo or sauce on the bun, simply a healthy handful of sharp, tangy Roquefort atop the patty. I added just a slight schmear of Dijon mustard that they offered to the top and voila, it created a rich, tangy, slightly creamy condiment to the prime piece of beef. The bun itself had grill marks on it and was soft, buttery and slightly toasted. For a fine dining burger, it had to be the best I've ever had. I'm usually not a fan of shoestring fries, but the Spotted Pig's proved me wrong. There's were so thin and crispy and taken to the next level with fried herbs and garlic chips hidden in between fry curls. I literally had to stop myself from eating them even though I was so full.

Again this is one of the first gourmet burgers I can remember in NYC and their have been so many variations on it that this burger while really good can again get lost in the shuffle of all the pseudo burger bars around now.3) the veggies here are awesome and are so well roasted it is one of the few places I enjoy eating vegetables at.4) the rest of the menu is typically amazing.

It's a corner restaurant with ivy on the outside walls and pig-themed trinkets and decorations all around the inside. It's a tight fit on the inside, but it's better described as cozy than cramped. Be warned though, they don't take reservations so you'll have to put your name on the list, and the list gets long fast. It's worth the wait though, so grab a drink at the bar upstairs or at a place around the corner and come back excited.Culinary execution is the name of the game and The Spotted Pig does not disappoint. I mean, just look at the grill marks on top of the burger bun! Order the chargrilled burger with Roquefort cheese and shoestring fries and you're in for a real treat. The patty is perfectly grilled and is well paired with the right amount of ""stink"" from the blue cheese. Depending on whether or not you like blue cheese, you'll know immediately if this is the right burger for you. Personally, I love it. Let's not forget about those shoestring fries now - a gorgeous heap of aromatic bliss. Fried rosemary and garlic chips make these insanely delicious.So, what are you waiting for?

I mean this place is pretty small and gets packed quickly, so we tried to get there as early as we could after work on a Wednesday. We had an order of oysters that were small, but extremely delicious. My friend ordered a beer and was very pleased by the selection available. We then ordered the infamous burgers and shoestring fries. Wow-- was that underwhelming. The rocquefort on the burger was a little too strong and at a certain point, I just felt like I was tasting sweaty feet. However, I could not stop chomping on those fries. Even when I was full with a pile of fries left, my friend ate all of it. He seemed to enjoy everything.

It's so yummy, it deserves its own paragraphI've also tried their burger to which it claims to be the #1 place in NYC. Probably not the bestttt ever, but pretty damn good. It's perfectly grilled where the meat is juicy and flavorful. I love any type of cheese, so the blue cheese crumble is a nice touch. But if you are like my cousin who despises blue cheese.

The interior is like a pub and would be a fun place to hang out and grab a bite with friends before going out. We both ordered the burger since that's what they're known for. The burger patty itself was prepared perfectly - well seasoned, moist, with a nice pink center. Everything around the burger patty befuddled us though. The burger came with a blue cheese topping (and nothing else) but does everyone like blue cheese? We didn't, and when we asked for ketchup the server said the kitchen doesn't have it, since the chef doesn't prepare burgers with ketchup. Next to the burger were needle-thin shoestring fries which we were confused about how to eat. Do you pick them up in clumps, knock your head back, and mash them into your mouth or do you eat them one by one for the next hour or so?

We looked over the yelp reviews and decided to order:Oysters- enjoyed the mignonette sauce, really fresh and simpleLiver toast - LOTS of liver, if you're a big fan of liver, they definitely do not skimp. there is chunks of liver mixed in with creamy liverInfamous burger - medium rare, I had super high hopes for this burger given the reviews. I think this is the reason for my mediocre review. The medium rare was PRETTY DAMN RARE. And I (stupidly) didn't notice that there was bleu cheese listed in the ingredients (I absolutely cannot stand bleu cheese) so we immediately spit out the burger and scraped the cheese off. I could not get rid of the taste in my mouth. In addition, the shoestring fries were sooooo THIN. It could possible disappear into thin air from your very hands. The fries were super salty and I was not a fan of it. Special - Sisig dish - luckily this redeemed my meal. The cooked egg on top of the dish was amazing! The pork was super salty as well but it was a nice mix with the rice. I was definitely salivating for more. The hot plate kept the pork very crispy and warm while we ate the burger. Would definitely recommend again.Skirt steak dish - Probably the most underrated of the dishes.

It was on their advice that we ordered the Chicken Liver Toast . Thanking them still in my mind. For entrees I had the burger. Yum especially if you like strong cheese you will love this! Cooked perfectly and accompanied by the most deliciously seasoned shoestring fries. My friend got seared fish and that was also quite good.

If you come here, do yourself a favor and get something else.Moving on, their bar snacks are kind of where they shine. My favorite thing I've eaten here is the chicken liver toast, which is so, so, so good. Some other items weren't bad either, like the mussels and a squid special appetizer they had that night. Unremarkable was a pork spread that tasted like tuna salad, and deviled eggs which tasted like any other deviled eggs.

684,-xlluJgoEJMRtP6tiVEL9Q,Xi L.,3.0 star rating,"This is the highly popular 1 michelin star gastropub that you may or may not have heard about, and it is known for its simplistic burger + shoestring fries aka super thin fries. I thought the thinnest and tastiest fries i've ever had were from BJ's Brewery, a west coast chain. However, this place takes the prize for thinnest fries but unfortunately doesnt come close in taste. They are actually so thin that it is quite difficult to taste the actual potato or the density of the fry. This is kind of sad because when you dip in ketchup or any sauce for that matter, the fry breaks in half most of the time unless you are extremely careful so pick your sauce wisely. If you eat them freestyle you need to make sure you have a handful to taste much. The fries are seasoned in rosemary and lightly fried garlic flakes (super strong flavors) but the potato flavor itself, the essence of the fry is really lost.Burgerwise it is as the many many yelp photos suggests: a minimalist burger, but that doesn't mean its bad. However this one can use some improvement. It is 2 buns, a relatively large portion of beef, and a TON of bleu cheese. In fact like many others before me complained, the taste is quite overpowering. Everyone else at my table said the same thing. You definitely need to scrape off at least half of what they give you. There are no other toppings, so if you love bleu cheese this may be your thing, but for the average burger eater, you will likley be better off elsewhere. Also a friend complained that the patty was too small surface area-wise as it doesn't match the size of the bun so be aware of that (nbd to me though).",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Personally, I'm not a big fan of shoestring fries - I prefer my fries a tad fatter because I like to taste the potato if anything.

706,CtVBDAcTtYyg-G480d__PA,Michelle L.,4.0 star rating,"On a quest to find the best burger in NYC, my friend and I came here on a Monday night for dinner. We arrived at around 7:30 and had to wait about 45 minutes for a table due to their no reservations policy, so by the time we were seated, we were both more than ready for our burgers.We also decided to split two appetizers - the devils on horseback and the sheep's milk ricotta gnudi with basil pesto. The devils on horseback were dates and pears wrapped in bacon. They came piping hot, and when I bit into my first one, it was mushier than I expected because I hadn't realized there was also pear in it. They were pretty good, though I wish the bacon flavor had been a little stronger against the pear. Our second appetizer, the ricotta gnudi, was amazing. We had picked it after googling ""ricotta gnudi"" on our phones and deciding that it looked pretty good (though we weren't entirely sure what it was). Turns out it's very similar to ravioli... delicious, melt-in-your-mouth ravioli. Our appetizers came out quite fast, but we had to wait a little longer for our chargrilled burgers (or maybe it just seemed that way because we were so hungry/excited). Our plates finally arrived, each one with a giant burger and an even bigger pile of shoestring fries. Unfortunately for me, I didn't realize that Roquefort cheese, which came on the burger, is a type of blue cheese - and I hate blue cheese with a passion. Luckily it was easy to scrape off, and I transferred it onto my cheese-loving friend's burger before proceeding to enjoy the rest of my burger. The meat was super tender - I had ordered it medium, but the pinkness actually looked more like a medium rare. It was overall very yummy, and I was so full by the end that I couldn't even finish the last few bites. I also loved the shoestring fries - they were salted and seasoned nicely, and the ketchup that it came with had some kind of tanginess to it that tasted a bit like sriracha.The restaurant itself is incredibly dim and also pretty cramped.

710,WxNqupdvjLfxUr5JhczipQ,Sean C.,2.0 star rating,"Don't believe The Spotted Pig hype.It is excellently casual despite the Manhattan address and seemed like a refreshing mix of ages and cultures... although it did help me answer the question of where all the white people are in the city. I'm sure there are casual star sightings here if that's an important factor.Wait quotes seem to be blown wildly out of proportion although that's probably better than the opposite. Arriving on an early Sunday evening, ""over an hour"" became 25 minutes and I was conveniently texted and told to return within 10 minutes. If the weather was nicer and one organized a shopping trip or even just a stroll through the cobblestone streets in the West Village it wouldn't even be that large of a factor. It is, however, cramped. In order to sit down I had to pull the table out and my back was uncomfortably against a row of potted plants. I'm not sure if they really are just that hard up for space (as the bathroom is also very cramped) or it's an intentional ploy to turn tables sooner.Unfortunately the burger with roquefort and shoestring fries ($21), the primary claim to fame, was... mostly unremarkable and entirely bereft of vegetables for balance. This might be how the Brits do it? I enjoyed it but I barely remember it in retrospect.I'm not sure why the queues form here. The coziness is offset by the close quarters, it is a bit loud, and the prices don't seem justified for the quality.

My husband had it with cheese and actually said it was too overpowering. I think the chefs must really have a heavy hand. So he was disappointed.

I had passed by early that morning and there was already a line for brunch, and the hoopla of April Bloomfields signless quaint restaurant appeared justified. The small place was packed but we scored a bar stool seat by a window opening to the street.  It was a great nook for two old friends to catch up over a bottle of wine. The oysters were brilliant (6 for 16) served with a pink vinegar sauce.   Service seemed astute to purchases, as the waitress seemed to drag out the delivery of our burger until we had finished our bottle and had ordered another glass.The burger was $20 and had blue cheese, it was good as you might imagine after having three glasses of wine.  Shoestring fries always frustrate me.  It's like disguising the sinfulness of the French fry, but without a lot of satisfaction, like eating air, or breadcrumbs.Spotted pig is a cute gastro pub with a small menu.   The menu seemed over priced and the dishes looked kind of boring, but we stuck to wine and ordered fairly successfully, more of a drinking place really with good snacks. This place reminds me of the Longman Eagle in Chicago.

I love cheese but I tend to like cheeses that are on the milder side, and the pungent taste of this cheese was not pleasant. I shared a burger with two friends and we couldn't finish it between the three of us. We also tried the chicken liver toast and that wasn't good either. It tasted off and kind of on the fishy side.

That being said, I soon learned that it is extremely popular and well regarded. Hello, Michelin star. Anyways, being from Philly where I am spoiled by superfluous craft beer at every corner, I was really hoping to find an awesome gastropub with a noteworthy draft list of unparalleled quality. The Spotted Pig came up in the Yelp search for this criteria. Well, unparalleled beer list it was not, however it was an exceptional gastropub with a decent beer selection and other great beverages to boot. I'm still trying to find that craft beer haven, Manhattan. Crossing my fingers that day will come. Woe, I've become such a beer snob-I blame you, Philly.The menu was spectacular, just what we were looking for. Notably, the specials list was entirely worth perusing and honestly I think the large majority of items we sampled this evening were off the specials list. The whole trout was perfectly cooked, and the ""jar o pickles"" were just what they were labeled to be - a bar snack. And a perfect one at that. We ended up sharing 2 bar snacks, an appetizer, and a main dish, which was just a perfect amount of food for two hungry foodies. Also to note, that bourbon cocktail was damn good. If you like a boozy, bourbon based cocktail, it's a must have.Our server was a cute, friendly hipster lady who was very informed and equally as likable. She helped us out with recommendations and was always around when we needed her. We were seated upstairs in what looked like the seductive couples corner, which ended up being a really cute spot for us. Well played, Spotted Pig designer. Great decor, great vibe all around.Overall, an hour and a half wait on a Friday night was entirely worth it. I'll definitely be back when I'm visiting my man in the Village.

It's just not in the upper echelon of burger/gastropubs I've frequented.

Unfortunately, the experience did not live up to my previous visit. We waited the expected 2 hours for a table-not a problem. However, once we arrived and had ordered, it took 45 minutes to receive our food-all of us had ordered burgers so did not expect it to take so long for something so simple. Furthermore, all of our burgers had been ordered medium, and they were all barely cooked rare! The food was also not warm. Mine especially, was cold. I spoke to the waiter, and he grudgingly took it away and I can only presume put it in a microwave, as I revived the same, half eaten burger back about 10 minutes later. It was slightly warmer. On raising the issues of the cold, undercooked burgers to the staff member, the only response I got was a mumbled ""sorry"" before he ran away.

We showed up for brunch this morning, just before the restaurant opened, and a crowd had already formed.  (Who are these people?  Foreign tourists who don't know better?)  When we entered the restaurant, we were told to wait at the bar, which lasted 10-15 minutes--despite the fact that many tables were available both downstairs and upstairs, and the host and receptionist were just standing around.  When we were seated, we were brought to a table so tiny and uncomfortable we had to request an alternate option.  Our new table was not much better: small stools that certainly didn't encourage us to relax or linger over our meal.  (My guest and I are both on the tall side, though neither of us particularly large.) I came to order the burger, which costs a jaw-dropping $22 (although that is perhaps reasonable compared to my $6 coffee).  I ordered the burger medium well-- an option the waitress did not present to me (and which my dining companion thought was later met with a snarky comment-- I wasn't sure if the comment was ill-intentioned).  Anyway, I had two requests for substitutions: 1) Since I don't eat bleu cheese, could I substitute a different kind of cheese?; and 2) Since the french fries are listed as the same price on the menu as broccoli rabe, could I please make a substitution?  The waitress was unwilling to accommodate EITHER request.  I was visibly irritated, and perhaps even commented that for the steep price, some flexibility would be nice, but the waitress made no effort whatsoever to make sure I had a positive experience and left happy.  It was a big F--k you.My burger patty came and my companion was generous enough to scrape some of his cheese (he ordered grilled cheese) onto my burger (lest you think the restaurant simply didn't have another kind of cheese to offer).  The burger was fine-- but not good enough to overcome the terrible taste left in my mouth by the snotty wait staff/restaurant directives.  (I didn't eat the fries but my companion reported they were dry and underwhelming.)  I left feeling totally disappointed and robbed of my hard-earned money.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

745,0cRX_C62oslWmZkuBwoYQg,Enzo M.,1.0 star rating,"Maybe our visit was a rare fluke in service and quality given the number of accolades for this restaurant.  Here are the bullet points:1) Waited for about five minutes to be greeted by the server and given our menu when he kept checking up on the table next to us.  2) Ordered our food then waited 45 minutes for the burger and the sizzling sisig.  Our server checked up on us just once at which point I asked for bread while waiting for our food.  We got hungry at the 25th minute.  Our guess is that they lost or forgot our order. 3) Food finally came but the burger and shoe string fries were room temperature.  Sisig was sizzling hot which means the burger was done first but was not kept inside a warmer. 4) Sisig had more pork fat than pork meat and made the dish extremely oily.  Fries were very salty and the burger came with a very generous spread of  Roquefort cheese which, upon tasting, reminded me of the burning sensation in my mouth when accidentally swallowing sea water. This review is of my own experience and is not meant to bash the restaurant. It should, however, be a reminder that consistency is the true measure of long-term success, especially for a place owned by a Michelin-rated chef.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"
746,LcItX7s72ukvUvhnqTNxAw,Benjamin M.,4.0 star rating,"I was visiting the city a couple weeks ago, and I decided to finally try the famous burger at The Spotted Pig. First of all, this place is tiny--even if you include the upstairs seating area, the entire restaurant was way smaller than I expected. No wonder the wait can be crazy long around dinner rush. I arrived early (around 5pm) with a friend, and we were seated immediately. When we left around 6:15pm, a line had already formed outside.We each ordered the burger with the shoestring fries and a pot of pickles. I appreciated the simplicity of the burger--it's just a grilled bun, beef, and Roquefort. All of supreme quality, of course. It was a most delightful combination. Indeed it tasted like a $21 burger. I thoroughly enjoyed the meal, though I struggled mightily with appropriate shoestring fry-eating etiquette.Admittedly, I also wanted to eat here because of the sheer number of celebs who frequent the Pig. Just Google ""Spotted Pig celebrities"" and you'll be blown away by how many folks are regulars.

Pot of pickles never arrived. Mussels starter was good. Rilette was your average rilette, nothing to rave about. Bread was burnt (when I say burnt I mean charred black on the outside) Haven't got a clue what the burger reviews are about. The Roquefort is 100% overpowering and there is nothing to balance the whole thing out as the whole thing exists out of a bun, burger and Roquefort. Yep, that's it. And no, that is not because of the outstanding quality of each of the ingredients.In all this I'm leaving what seems to be the chefs #1 ingredient out... salt, salt and salt. I'm not your low sodium food nagging customer, but the amount of salt used on the fries was just disgusting.Looking at other reviews and the overall esteem of the restaurant one could conclude that the other dishes could/should be better.

Given that, try to time it so that you arrive to put your name in well advance of when you intend to eat. The host will text you when you're table is ready, so you can leave and roam the area or run some quick errands. Once you clear the obstacle of getting seated, you'll be treated to a cozy, somewhat eclectic dining room and experience. I have not made much headway in trying a broad selection of menu items, but did order the Cuban sandwich during my visit. I have to say that it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The bread was toasted to perfection and coated in melted gruyere cheese and stuffed with prosciutto, pulled pork, pickles and mustard.  Each of the ingredients were fresh and flavorful, and I enjoyed every bite of my enormous sandwich.

There was one more beet at the bill - one single beer. The manager didn't agree to remove it. Is it really the kind if behavior/attitude you expect from a Michelin-Starred restaurant?

The brunch menu looked most appealing to me, so we decided to squeeze in brunch here on Saturday afternoon.We spent our early afternoon in Chelsea and then walked down to The Spotted Pig from there. The website had stated that the busiest meal times were the 7-9 dinner time period, so I figured that if we arrived at 2:30 for brunch ending at 3 that we wouldn't have any problems.Well, of course, we arrive at 2:30 and were told that the wait was about 30-40 minutes... but that the brunch menu would not be served by the time that we got seated. Are you kidding me? Instead, we found two bar stools and a shallow bar top attached to a column in the middle of the restaurant so that we could order brunch before the apparently-hard-stop brunch time of 3.We both got beers. My husband is a bit of a beer connoisseur but was unfamiliar with the Allagash White Belgian Style Wheat that I ordered. It was delicious! Their beer selection seemed quite impressive and right up our ally.Neither of us were extremely hungry so we decided to split the French Toast with Bananas and Bourbon Syrup. Ummm... WOW. Incredible! The whole dish was amazing... the fluffy french toast, the bourbon-flavored bananas... but the best part was this buttery-but-sour-creamy concoction. I was cautious at first thinking that it was only fluffy butter, but we quickly realized that this stuff needed to be slathered all over our dish because it was one of the best things we had ever eaten! And on that note.. the Spotted Pig definitely deserves to be my 300th review!

The food is simply average: too salty, too fatty, too unimaginative, too beige - too middle of the road English - to be anything beyond a notch above boring. It is not worth waiting any amount of time for.

784,-ACubwURqsDNTtTTYXS87Q,Emilio P.,3.0 star rating,"First time at the spotted pig during vaca from Miami with the family; After a long day (Saturday night), My daughter Yelps and digs up The Spotted Cow. It was open late and has tons of positive reviews. We were dressed pretty raggity (tshirts n jeans) we looked tired and wasted after having spent the day at a Bronx Stickball Tournament (yes stickball tournament; that's another story). We had Chicken Liver Toast, Deviled Eggs, Custard Parm, The Burger, Skate, Arctic Char, Skirt Steak, and the Creme Caramel desert.The Toast, Skate (daughter #1 eats healthy and raved about the Skate and toast), Parmesan Custard with Speck (a custard cheese with asparagus, (speck = better than prosciutto), in a bernaise was a very good combo). The Char was awesome. Deviled eggs had a nice spicy kick. The skirt steak was ordered medium well (it looked good) but I think I shoulda ordered it well done because mine was a bit chewy. The burger was a burger with roquefort cheese (We have had plenty of burgers. Daughter #2 says RokBrgr's truffle burger beats it). The Creme Caramel is a Flan but a really really good flan (not eggy not too sweet, and really smooth). BTW the Bronx Ale was smooth and for my taste it paired well with the Eggs and Parm.The guy at the door told us it was going to be an 1.5 to 2 hour wait but we were seated after about 45 min (he and the girl that seated us were helpful). And now the downsides. First the server wouldn't get in a group pic (not a big deal doesn't bother me I understand the not wanting to be in a strangers pic); Next the wife's Arctic Char was served with greens, I asked if we could substitute the greens (server said, no) I asked if we could have a side of asparagus/bernaise (server said, we don't do sides like that). I recognize when someone's trying to simply shoo me along, Maybe it was our appearance that dictated the treatment; All's forgiven.  Lastly and most important, I walked into the bathroom to wash my hands (remember we spent all day in the Bronx and rode the subway from midtown to the restaurant).  As I walked in, a guy wearing an apron (obviously worked in the kitchen) walked out of the stall and straight out the bathroom without washing his hands.The sign on the wall at the sinks reads the standard, ""employees must wash hands before returning to work"".  I brought this up to our server. She casually says, ""oh there's a sink in the kitchen too"".  Ok look; I don't know that there's a sink in the kitchen, I don't know if the guy went straight home afterwards, I don't know if the sink in the kitchen is the same sink used to wash produce, I don't know much about much but I'm absolutely certain that having employees who don't wash their hands is an image the restaurant wants to portray.The food was good but the entire time I ate, I couldn't get the thought of the hands not being washed out of my head. If I had any inclination of absolute filth, I would've walked out. But I took what I was told about the kitchen sink and ate a decent meal.  Bottom line spotted pig, if you're gonna charge me top dollar for a very good meal, have the courtesy of informing your kitchen staff that sometimes perception is reality.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

My best, most simple shot; GNUDI = hot pillows of pan-fried ricotta. Hello.     The Nicoise salad is great for a clean, light meal. The Cubano sandwich, which is available for lunch, is an out-of-this-world Cuban sandwich. The bread is toasted to crispy perfection. The best Cuban I have had.

They don't take reservations (which in some ways is nice, you don't have to plan far in advance to come here). The kitchen opens for dinner around 5 or 5:30, so that's when my group got there to put our names down for a table. We were seated by around 6:15 or so. In the meantime we enjoyed some drinks at their bar. The menu changes every day, so they really think through their menu. We had their chicken liver on toast, squid soup (more squid than soup), crispy pig ear salad, seared mackerel with sweet potato mash & house cured pancetta, grilled skirt steak with delicata squash, hazelnuts, and yogurt dressing, and wild striped bass with roasted cauliflower. They err on the ""rare"" side of medium-rare, just FYI. Our waitress let us know this beforehand, so we ordered the steak medium and it ended up being what we considered medium-rare. Everything was amazing, well-prepared, fresh, good service, etc. The Spotted pig is laid back, cozy, and very welcoming.

Just try to fight your way to the waiting list and then assertively make your way to the bar while you wait for a table. You may actually walk by the venue because the exterior is cluttered with several potted plants and a couple of benches (similar to the Breslin) and you might mistake it for a nursery. The interior is homey, with several framed pictures, decorative plates and curtains you'd find in a country B&B. You should also take note that from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the Pig only serves its bar menu. Thankfully the burger was available and that was the primary reason for my visit. The burger arrives with a heaping mound of shoe string fries tossed with rosemary. The fries look like they're about to swallow the burger like The Blob. The bun had an attractive sear pattern and the amount of roquefort was just right. The burger itself is a hefty patty of delicious beef. It was prepared perfectly and tasted great. Resist the urge to cut the burger in half because this is a burger that should be eaten with both hands. We had some apps as well. The deviled eggs were okay but the chicken liver toast is very good. It's not dry and crumbly and they spread it onto thick slices of crusty bread. It is not a dainty amount either. This is a nice way to introduce people to chicken liver.

I curiously anticipated this seemingly over priced ""vision"" in the hopes of something interesting and new as one might expect from the Big Apple. Well...ironically enough I quite literally got a big apple, no seriously an apple cut up for $16.

I went with my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday and he's been dying to try out the famous Chargrilled burger. As you may already know, this restaurant does not take any reservations. It was a rainy, Sunday evening and was told by the host that it'll be a 30 minute wait for a table. Not so bad huh? We went around the neighborhood to kill time and received a text from the restaurant saying that they will text me when my table was ready. Going to fast-track a bit -- we got seated, ordered the deviled eggs to start which was delicious. Then, the sheep's milk gnudi with sage and brown butter sauce which was heaven. Finally, got to the Chargrilled burger. Please note, that the burger wait is just as long as waiting for a table...no idea why! It's really a simple grilled, brioche bun burger with blue cheese and another sauce mixed in which I couldn't figure out and the burger itself. It didn't really need much and I was amazed how good it was. Unfortunately, my boyfriend received his burger with a burnt bottom bun. He stilled enjoyed the fries though! The atmosphere here is awesome and laid-back. There are two floors of this fabulous establishment and I would go back.

The menu was pretty simple and there wasn't that much burger selections as I thought (in fact, there's only ONE burger). I was under the impression that this place has knock out burger --- so I had always thought this was a burger place. They do have a good amount of cocktail selections though - in case you're wondering.I did end up ordering the burger with a request to make it medium well while my friend did the same but had the meat cooked in medium. We also ordered the devil egg. It took awhile for the food to come (even the devil eggs) - unsure why but for sure the anticipation rose to the roof. When the food came through I took my bite and then---------------------meh.....The devil egg was pretty average; I mean this is a dish that is not really likely to fail to begin with so you can only elevate by deciding what to mix with the yolk. In TSP's case, it was vinegar and mayo but that's about it (at least that was all I could tasted). It wasn't really much of a surprise. I've made devil eggs more interesting than this (it was still praised to this day by friends even though it was made 2 yrs ago... yah I like to brag).  But whatever, it was still pretty appetizing.Now the burger.....Umm... first of all, it was two buns + hamburger meat + blue cheese sauce and that was the end of the story. I guess you can argue a good burger doesn't need all that unnecessary decorations - yes but I like my burger to be a bit more diverse. On top of all that...it was pretty average. Overrated? I think so. I do give them the benefit of doubt as I didn't get to try anything else on the menu but given that people have been saying how good their burger is suppose to be, it was a bit of a let down. Will I go back? Only if I don't have to wait. Side note: My friend and I both thought our meat was more raw that what we imagined to be. If you are for one who likes your meat on the cooked side but not so cooked that the meat lose its tenderness, be sure to let your server know that you want it between medium well to well done.

This is where I have to award 4 stars only because of the lack of consistency and the somewhat clique feel to it.  Some of their employees are amazing and friendly and remember your name even if you go in once every two weeks like I do... But then some servers are really just not very attentive and aren't even familiar with their own menu.  The last server I had looked at me like I had two heads when I asked if they had poussin that night and insisted they never did, which was very troubling to hear as a big fan of this restaurant.  The hostess or host on duty, which seems to turn over frequently, is typically very unfriendly until they know that you know at least one employee, which is fine for me but not recommended for the restaurant owners I suppose.  It can kind of make people fee alienated and I've definitely heard murmurs from customers outside about how they felt unwelcome.  Strange that it's never been my experience but I have seen it first hand and I do recognize how difficult it is to manage the behavior of every single employee.

IT was a great way to start the final night of 2014.I came here Wednesday night with my GF, Sasha, who happens to be a vegetarian. Originally I intended to be nice and to order something that we could share, but as you will read later, I decided to go with the steak! We poured over the menu in excitement for about 20 minutes, feeling the giddy rush of finally getting to try this highly praised restaurant, trying to find the perfect permutation of  dishes that would satisfy us, and leave us with full bellies and happy mouths. I decided to get the Hanger Steak, Garlic Broccoli Rabe (the special), and the Port Collar cocktail. I had to get the hanger steak. It was delicious. Not terribly big, but very tasty. Lately I have been getting a string of subpar skirt steaks, especially when I order them my favorite way, Medium Rare. Chewy and lacking in flavor, I was questioning if I was ordering them cooked properly. I asked if Medium Rare was recommended for the hanger steak, and the waiter said that is the preferred way of serving this steak. My GF ordered Roll Mops, the Winter Market Salad, Beets & Greens, and the Sheep's Milk Gnudi, with a special cocktail similar to the Novo Mundo.The Roll Mops were good. Sasha loved them. This was my first time trying them. A tasty mackerel dish if you like mackerel. Reminded me of canned Mackerel plate at a Jewish brunch in NYC. The next dish to arrive was the salad. The salad was tangy, and slightly acidic, but with a salty/umami flavor reminiscent of sardines the mellowed it out. I usually don't like salt, but the flavors here balanced; however, we both noticed that the salad was on the salty side.The main courses came out next. My steak was perfectly cooked and delicious with sections of grilled squash, and kale chips. Sasha's Gnudi was also excellent. Rich cheese filling lightly coded in flower. Each bite was a bite of pasta filling without the pasta. While I loved this dish, Sasha thought it was overly rich. Also by this time, my cocktail was taking effect, and I was in a rather jovial mood.The Broccolo Rab was delicious. Soft and garlicy. The beets were grilled perfectly. They had a taste I had not experienced yet. I really enjoyed them prepared this way, but there was a strong earthy quality, giving me the strong inclination that this dish is meant to be shared amongst a diners.Sasha's cocktail was also tasty.We loved the Ambiance and the warm rustic feel. The food was very rich and heavy on the Umami flavor. Everything blended perfectly to form a rich unctuous flavor on my tongue and a full satisfied belly. Pub food with a flare.The Hamburgers and French fries looked amazing. I am salivating at the thought of it, and it is on a short list of places to come back to to try. If the Hamburger and fries are anywhere near as good as they look, this will be a go to spot for a reasonable meal with a great ambiance. I really enjoyed my meal here. All in all the bill came out to be 200 dollars for the two of us, on a special occasion. I left feeling happy and that the price was well worth it.We also tried the Banna dish for desert. Yummy!!Side note, My gf was not nearly as enamored of this place as I was. She really loved the ambiance and the feel of the place, but the food was not as exciting to her as it was for me. I love strong Umami flavors and rich food. If you want something more delicate and lighter in fare, you might be disappointed.

My visit to Spotted Pig was probably one of the worst dining experiences ever. While waiting to be seated we had to ask 3 times to get drinks. If that didn't clue us in, perhaps the ill fitting Scottish bagpipe visit should have. What's up with that?! This place is suffering from an identity crisis. Once we were seated and began ordering my husband remembered his credit card was left with the bartender upstairs. In the middle of taking our order, the server stopped and went to get it, and didn't come back for about 10 minutes- without the card. Only after ordering did we discover a list of specials written on a board half way across the restaurant which were never mentioned to us. After waiting over an hour for our food (medium burgers) our server gave back a very snotty response when we finally inquired about its status. Upon delivery no apology or comment was offered, nor was any inquiry into our satisfaction after we'd had a chance to try it. We both received blood rare, completely tasteless burgers (except for the heaping pile of overbearing Roquefort cheese). Neither of us touched more than a bite of our food, but that didn't stop our indifferent server (Alexis, according to our receipt) from delivering our overpriced bill. I'm sure it was obvious we were not happy. If we could have held our servers attention long enough to let him know we were unhappy, we would have. By that time we just wanted to get out of there. I usually take every experience for what it is, but this is one where I'd love the 2.5 hours of my life (and $120) back!!! There are too many great options on the West Village.

You probably have read his poetry about haggis, but I'm sure you've sung ""Auld Lang Syne"".Well, last night was Burns's Night and The Spotted Pig threw quite the Scottish bash! The male servers were decked out in kilts, they'd hired a bagpiper to play a few tunes every 30 minutes or so, and the specials featured Scottish delicacies, such as haggis.Unable to stomach the stomach (pun totally intended), we stuck to the normal menu and ordered:-Marinated olives-Deviled eggs-Burger & rosemary fries-Ricotta gnudi, brown butter and fried sage-Market salad-Brussels sprouts with pancetta -Carrots with thymeWe shared all the food and were all really impressed with the gnudi (like soft pillows or clouds), the deviled eggs (unexpectedly vinegary and spicy), the fries, and the roasted vegetables.

The food was a bit below average - I've had better at non-Michelin rated restaurants. Gnudi was salty and shoestring fries had too many onions. However, their Spotted Pig Bitter beer was the saving grace and I highly recommend it. The ambiance was great - it makes the soul feel warm. Like, if there were a blizzard outside, it would be an ideal place to be snowed in. Dim lighting, candles, wood - it reminds me of Freeman's but a half step lower.

Good burger, but not the best as many seem to think. I ordered medium rare, and for medium well at first, but they got that fixed pronto. A+ for that. Very tasty, I liked the bleu cheese, but given the size and the fact it was medium rare, I was shocked at the lack of juiciness. Maybe I'm spoiled from the days of Ray's Hellburger outside of DC, but not enough juice, and not enough flavor in the patty itself to be among the best. The fries were excellent.

Everest on a plate, just unnecessarily massive, yet utterly outstanding.  These fries were thin and crispy, salty and the perfect crunchy accessory to that amazing burger.  The Chicken Stew was quite sophisticated as well, and definitely very hearty.  The chicken was really tender and we really enjoyed the flavor profile of the dish.  Dessert was The Flourless Chocolate Cake as well as the Hazelnut Ice Cream with Shortbread cookies.  I wouldn't recommend the cake, it was extremely dense and rich, and way too much dessert after such a heavy meal.  On the other hand, the delectable ice cream along with the crunchy shortbread cookies, was a nice way to cap off our impressive meal.Too bad our friends visiting from Cali couldn't hack another burger night since that's all they had been eating before coming to New York, because I was planning to take them here.  Instead they went with pizza (which is never a bad idea in NYC), but I tell you, I really wanted them to try The Spotted Pig and have something else to really brag about when they made their way back to the west coast.  Next time, I'll get them and so will TSP.   The Spotted Pig delivers incredibly hearty, and tasty food, in a cozy and chilled out setting.  One dinner here is a meal you will not likely forget, and for all the best reasons imaginable.  Amazing food, great service, fun atmosphere... did I mention amazing food?  Mmm that burger, Lord have mercy!!!",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

However, the arrogance of the man behind the maitre d' stand, who I think is called Liam, was oddly dismissive and rude. I suppose you can treat your customers with disdain when you have a waiting list for days, but after several great meals there, it became apparent that this man represents the enterprise as a whole. With my party of good natured relaxed gents, I waited almost 90 minutes for the table we requested. I inquired about progress, and I was told we were on the waiting list for a lower total number than we had given.  When I pointed out that they had it down wrong, the host (Liam?) laughed and said I was wrong. At this point, we were all getting cranky, having been waiting for what seemed an excessively long time. He became increasingly sarcastic and combative, insisting that we were in the wrong. Regardless of whose version of the facts was correct, I'm baffled by anyone who is so blatantly rude - and who, after 90 minutes wait time, has the bad form to try and make us the bad guys instead of simply apologizing and trying to make it right. We only wanted to patronize the restaurant.Needless to say, we left as a group and found a wonderfully kind and hospitable restaurant around the corner (The Left Bank.)I'm sad that I can no longer count The Spotted Pig among my go-to restaurants.

Sure, the burger was okay, but it was definitely not in my NYC top 20. The meat was tender and tasty enough as was the bun, but the Roquefort Cheese was a bit overpowering. Plus, I asked the waiter for lettuce and tomato b/c I generally enjoy them on my burger... and he said, ""We don't do that."" Well, they certainly have salad on their menu, so how big a deal would it have been to send out some leafy accoutrements?!?! A bit of a crazy policy, IMHO. As for the shoestring fries that are served with the burger, they are tasty... but they're hard to dip into ketchup making them more of a mess than anything else. Again, IMHO, the fries are just all hype. [SPECIAL NOTE: The food runner mixed up the ""medium rare"" burgers with the ""medium"" burgers when he was passing them out to our table, so be sure to double check before you bit down!]The atmosphere at Spotted Pig is eclectic and interesting and is probably comfortable most nights...however, on the night we visited, it was hot and humid outside and the air conditioner in the restaurant was broken.

I even signed up for Yelp just to tell y'all about it!I had only heard great things about the place and had had it on my to-visit restaurant list for months, waiting for the proper occasion to check it out: celebrating my anniversary with my boyfriend was one such event.We knew there would be a long wait going into it, so we showed up on the earlier side to get our names on the list. We were told two hours (fine, it was Friday night) and that if we didn't arrive within ten minutes of being contacted, our spot would be given up. Fine.We popped off to a nearby watering hole for just about two hours when I got the text. Knowing that we could lose our spot if we delayed, we chugged the rest of our beers and headed over.Once there, our boisterous host--who would become the ""star"" of this whole production--informed us that our table would be ready ""soon."" I mean, sure, another couple minutes, whatever.At this establishment, apparently ""soon"" is applied liberally.After ten minutes the host noticed that we were whispering to each other and were trying to make eye contact--and she immediately engaged her defenses, despite us never saying anything to her, telling us to ""settle down boys.""Seriously? ""Settle down""? Aside from the condescending usage of ""boys,"" what exactly were we doing? Having a quiet, private discussion about how we had finished our beers and rushed over so we wouldn't lose our spot, only then made to inexplicably wait ten more minutes?Another ten minutes passed and were again told to ""keep calm,"" our gracious host offering us two beers ""on me"" (except no, they're on the restaurant), helping make up for the fact that we had been waiting almost 2.5 hours at that point. This additional wait was supposedly because the host was looking for a more accommodating table for my tall boyfriend (he is over 6' but not in an extreme way)--something neither of us had ever experienced before and something we definitely didn't ask for. The host gave another couple--who had showed up after us--a table because my boyfriend was ""too tall"" and she was ""trying to be polite."" Again, we did not request some kind of special ""tall person"" table.When we did finally get the ""best table in the house"" (according to the host), it was a corner table that was arguably the worst option for two tall people--our knees were knocking together the entire time. Normally who cares! But we were made to wait an extra 25 minutes because allegedly we were being given a better table specifically for tall people.We were so hungry at this point we skipped another round of drinks and went straight for the burgers, medium-rare.When they arrived, there was nothing ""medium"" about them; in fact, they were as mushy as a baby's nose (you know, before they've got cartilage in there) and complemented by fries so thin they were practically crushed beneath their own weight.We made it through about half of our burgers before giving up (I mean, I'm not trying to get food poisoning on my anniversary). Our server (who was very nice, in stark contrast to the host) asked whether everything had not been to our liking. We told her it hadn't, but we just wanted the check. It'd been nearly a four-hour affair by then, and neither of us was interested in extending it any further.After paying, the host asked how we liked our meal, and I said it was ""terrible actually, and we're never coming back!"" to which she replied, ""Oh, that's too bad""--but I think we all knew it wasn't.I can count the number of times I've been to a restaurant so well-regarded and yet been so let down on one hand.

They don't take reservations, but since we got there right before they opened (and maybe because ""blizzard Nemo"" was upon us, we were seated pretty quickly. Our server was great - very fun and informative. A big pet peeve of mine is when you ask a server what the best things on the menu are and he or she replies, ""everything is good."" That is the lamest answer ever and most likely means that they have never tried anything on the menu. But when we posed the question to our server, he responded back quickly and confidently with his top menu favorites (which indicated that he most likely had actually tried the dishes). Some of us went with his suggestions and were not at all disappointed. The gnudi were fresh and amazing - perfect on a cold, rainy day and actually very elegantly prepared. My husband decided to try the mackerel and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. A couple of our friends got the grilled cheese and it was also good. The deviled eggs, while small in portion, were amazingly good (and spicy).  Loved the atmosphere and decor of the place. It felt so warm and homey. And the best thing EVER - the warm, spiced wine.

I arrived around 6:40pm, and the wait was only 20-30 minutes for the table. The place is small, well at least on the main floor, but it does open up a bit upstairs. However, i still think overall the restaurant is small and may be as small as Minetta Tavern. I know i do mention that sometimes great things come in small packages, and the Spotted Pig is no exception.For apps, we shared Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi with Basil Pesto and Crispy Pig's Ear Salad with Lemon Caper Dressing. The Ricotta Gnudi was made so delicately. It was a pretty refined dish for the restaurant. The pesto was fresh tasting, but it was a bit overpowering. I had to scoop off some of the pesto, so the freshly made ricotta could be the star of the plate. Overall, the Ricotta Gnudi was mildly salty and sweet, and it wasn't too heavy at all. The Crispy pig ear salad was bananas. The crispy pig ears were literally pig ears; they didn't even bother to trim the ears into small slices. The pork was perfectly deep fried, It was crispy on the outside, but when you bite into it, the juices of the melted fat just explode. The pig ears are salty and the tangy lemon dressing with mixed greens really complement the ears. The salad had endives as well as other bitter veggies, so the dish had bitterness, tang, saltiness, and multiple levels of texture. For entrees, my friend got the famous Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort & Shoestrings. I got the Pork Sausage special.  The burger was flavorful and juicy, even cooked to medium. The bun had great grill marks and it was buttery and toasted to perfection. The burger paired with the roquefort cheese was a perfect marriage. The shoestring fries were crispy and seasoned to perfection. None of the fries tasted soggy. The sausages ...i believe had no casings. I was able to cut into the sausage like it was melted butter. The sausage was also topped with shredded fried pig ears, so that was great too.

The pork belly was crispy so that was an interesting textural spin on the dish, but I love pork belly and so I expected a lot from it, and I've had better.

Scoring a Michelin Star is no small accomplishment in this town and I've been wanting to try this little corner restaurant in the West Village for a while to try the legendary burger. I've walked by dozens of times while returning from long runs along the West Side Highway, but in those moments I am rarely in the mood for a blue cheese-coated burger on a fluffy bun with a pile of shoestring fries, so my rendezvous with the eclectically decorated, ever-happening Spotted Pig was put on hold for too long. Yesterday, I am happy to say that the wait ended and I was not disappointed.I went during the frantic Sunday brunch hour fully expecting throngs of derby shoe-wearing, Ray Ban-donning, cuffed Bonobos-rocking 20-30 somethings standing around waiting for a coveted table. Either it was an off day, or the Spotted Pig just isn't a brunch hotspot, but I was able to saddle up to the bar, no problem. The pig theme is in full effect here. The vibe is fun, the decor is kitschy, the bartender and hostess were friendly and the food came out fast.As for the burger. Pretty damn good. $21 good? Maybe. Maybe not. If you don't love strong Roquefort blue cheese, it's not a good call for you. But the toasted bun and rosemary shoestring fries made it pretty special.

I literally had to wipe the cheese off the burger patty just to consume it and even then, some residual cheese on the bun ruined the experience for me. It's very possible the majority of the reviews were written by people who love strong cheese...or people who have never set foot in amazing burger places like Ottomanelli's...;) Also, with no other toppings besides that horrendous cheese, $21 is ridiculous for one burger, ESPECIALLY if it lacks bacon!The shoestring fries...are properly named. The problem is, they're so thin, I could barely taste the flavor on them. Props for cooking the fries with real chunks of garlic, though.I did enjoy their deviled eggs and the chicken liver pate, however. I am sure their other appetizers are equally great...I am just disappointed that the burger that's been raved about is actually not a big deal at all. The appetizers and the eclectic, eye-catching pork-centered decor were the saving graces  that gave this place a solid 3. That ...and our hot waiter with a sexy accent .

But all good restaurant in this neighborhood are like this. It's just a matter if the food is worth the wait at the end of the day.

So even though the place is big (2-levels, bathroom on both floors), it's still packed all the time. - Service: is quick, good and welcoming. - Burger: it's good by all means.

To be honest, after 2 hour's waiting time and some drinks, I was more frustrated than excited to try out this place.

The eggs were creamy and light.  The pickled vegetables were great, especially with our entree (yelp.com/biz_photos/3LNc…).  The pig's ear was tender with a nice, crispy coating that remained crunchy even though the salad was dressed (yelp.com/biz_photos/3LNc…).  It paired well with the salad of arugula and parsley.  Of all our starters, this was definitely my favorite.For our entrees we all chose the burger with Roquefort cheese and shoestring fries (yelp.com/biz_photos/3LNc…).  Over half the plate was filled with those ultra thin and super crispy fries sprinkled throughout with rosemary.  The fries were good, but oversalted.  The burger was outstanding.  It is served plain, with no vegetables, garnishes or condiments, as it didn't need any.  I saw that there were only bottles of ketchup at the service station, presumably for the fries.  The burger was thick and juicy and a perfect medium rare.  The bun was firm enough to hold up until the last bite without breaking apart or becoming a soggy mess.  The cheese, melted on top of the patty, had just enough tangy flavor to wave hello without taking over the lively convesation going on within the bun; the beef was clearly the star.  This was truly one of the best hamburgers I've ever had, and I don't make that statement lightly.  The pickled vegetables served as a nice break from the richness of the meat.  A pint of the local Bronx Brewery pale ale was the perfect beverage to round out this meal.All of the seats are stools.  I think this discourages people from hanging around too long, which is fine by me and all the other people waiting patiently for one of their coveted tables. Heh.  They don't take reservations so if you want to avoid a long wait come really early or really late.  It's really dark inside and the noise level is really high, but not in a bad way.  The vibe is pretty mellow and seems like the perfect spot for meeting up with friends and having a great time over a pint or two.  I love the pig-themed decor throughout.  The Spotted Pig clearly respects the pig (and the cow) and allows their very fresh ingredients to shine.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

923,GBuQamjjQyrUDJEBE3uVLQ,Stephen S.,1.0 star rating,"I will try and make this review as straight forward as possible. I'm disappointed my first review is a negative one but I feel it is important to describe my experience in hopes the restaurant (and specifically the chef) realize how important it is to keep the customer first.I went to the Spotted Pig with a visiting friend to enjoy a casual dinner. We opted to sit at the bar to avoid a long wait. The bartender was friendly. We ordered beers and burgers. I'll be the first to admit I ordered the burger without taking notice of the Roquefort cheese. When the burger came (about double the time this order should take) I realized my mistake and politely asked for a substitution. Any other cheese. To avoid the hassle of sending it back I asked to bring a slice of whatever was available. The bartender notified me that in her 12 years of working there - no substitutions had been made by the chef. I politely asked for at least a slice of tomato. She asked if I wanted to speak to a manager. When the manager arrived, he asked if there was a problem. I conveyed that there was no problem and that I had not realized the cheese on the burger and was looking for something to eat the burger with beyond just a bun and meat (with the cheese already scratched off) to avoid wasting perfectly good food and to meet them halfway. This was refused and I requested the menu for another selection. No other meal seemed particularly appetizing to me. I got the check and was disappointed to leave hungry.This is inexcusable. The customer is always right. I was not charged for the burger (I half expected an issue with this since the overlook was fully my mistake) but to not accommodate a customer's request is beyond comprehendible. I will never return to the Spotted Pig. I respect the desire of a chef to craft a dish how he/she would like (and enjoy success from many who have ordered despite reading the many reviews that expressed a valuation that deemed it not worth the wait and a general consensus that the cheese is too overpowering), but to forget that it is the customer who is the one who is left to enjoy the meal is offensive.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I love how the bun is slightly wider than the diameter of the patty, so I never have to deal with an inevitably imbalanced bun-to-meat ratio after a few bites. I love how the bun is thick enough to hold up to the juicy burger, but still soft enough to be oh-so-fluffy. I love how the fries are all crisp and no mushy fluff and flavored with rosemary and garlic crisps.

Came back recently for lunch because I heard and read that they have a burger that's pretty amazing. The place wasn't too crowded, so I thought I'd give it another chance. Went upstairs and sat at the bar. The bartender was pleasant. I ordered the Charbroiled burger with Roquefort cheese and shoestring potatoes. That burger was damn good.

936,WWptvNpAv0gs_m7aRDcsPQ,Alison H.,5.0 star rating,"With over 1,200 reviews the word about the spotted pig has certainly spread. The reviews have people trekking down or across town to check it out. The come here, they eat the burger, leave, then write their review. Many are not absolutely impressed. Who wants to wait over an hour sometimes two, pay $20 for a burger and eat it jammed in the corner on a baby stool? .........Well I do.  Yelp brought me to the spotted pig for the first time a couple years ago, I got a burger and those were my thoughts about it after. I posted a 3 star review and moved on with my life.  Now being back over a dozen times I must say that one visit and one burger for that matter is not nearly enough to from a solid opinion on this establishment. I have concluded that April Bloomfield is a genius and the Spotted Pig is my favorite restaurant downtown period. Her food it outstanding, I've eaten many things from the menu and many that have come up as specials. Michelin ratings are broken down by food, service and comfort. ( I think )  The comfort covers décor and the literal meaning of comfort. The spotted pig décor consists of ceramic pigs. The tables are super small close together and lined with paper the seating is almost all stools. The servers are on their game, they are often tattooed, pierced and without sleeves. No ties here folks. So this leaves one to deduce that her food carried her to the Michelin rating. If you have been once, go again, if you haven't been yet go and order more than a burger. Get there at 5 and be seated at 5:30 get there at 5:30 and be seated at 6:30 get there at 6 and be seated at 8.

I've had better for a cheaper price at Flat Top, Corner Bistro, etc. But I must say I really enjoyed the Shoestring Fries that were served on the side. In sum, I don't think this place is worth waiting for 2-3 hours. There are so many cheaper, superior food options in the neighborhood that doesn't require such a crazy wait.

In a direct comparison (and because $20+ burgers need to be compared) of Minetta Tavern's Black Label burger and Spotted Pig burger- Spotted Pig loses by a long shot. Minetta Tavern I would eat over and over and it was decadent and freaking unbelievably good- but Spotted Pig, I just wasn't impressed with any of the flavor and the toppings were sparse and kinda blah.

Clearly, I am not covering much new ground here. However, Spotted Pig *is* one of my favorite restaurants in the West Village, and is one of many reasons that I truly enjoy living in this neighborhood.The Spotted Pig has an amazing ambiance as you enter the old brick townhouse. Always warm, always cozy, always buzzing with people... Always busy. Always... an hour+ wait for brunch.... and Thursday nights... and Saturday nights... and always.. except that one time we went at 6:30pm on a Sunday night. But no matter! The most successful approach that I've had is to manage my expectations. If I have a large lunch, I don't mind eating at 10pm. If I make this one place the majority of my Saturday night, I can spend an hour drinking French Chardonnay at the bar. So then if the table is available after only 20 minutes of waiting..? Hooray! Plan ahead, and you'll do just fine.On to the food. I had no idea what a ""devil-on-horseback"" was, so we ordered some. They are bacon-wrapped dates, and they are seriously tasty little morsels. Savory, sweet, salty, scrumptious. We usually get a side of greens, which are always cooked perfectly, and usually with cheese, bacon, etc.., some sort of fat in it to offset the healthy-factor. I almost always get the ricotta gnudi with sage/brown butter, just because I love those little round pillows of cheese so much. I never get the burger because I don't like roquefort, but my boyfriend can vouch for its quality. It also comes with a heaping pile of shoestring fries, which I have tried, and they are consistently good.For brunch, I have tried the grilled cheese with onion marmalade. Now maybe it was because it was my first brunch back in the US after being in Japan for 2 weeks, eating fish, vegetables, and forgetting about cheese (well as much as possible), but thisssss sandwichhhhh was HEAVY. It sat on my stomach like a brick. Just know that before ordering.... that this is one. serious. grilled cheese sandwich.

Friendly, filled with mouth-watering delicious eats, and just seemingly happy to be there.We were cruising for some late night eats and drinks, and The Spotted Pig heeded our needs. A decent beer list (with unfortunateely just a handful of taps) with a very well assembled burger (thick patty with just the right amount of roquefort on toasted brioche) all within a warm and cozy pig ornament filled room did make for excellent late night dining. Only quibble is the cost. $6 garnered us a small petri dish of pickled vegetables (which is not what one imagines when ordering a ""pot of pickles""). And while that burger was certainly worth $21 in that particular time of need, this would not be the case on any given day. All in all, a tentatively strong thumbs up. Will have to reserve further judgment till I sample more foods, including their homemade ice cream.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

At least I think that's what was happening, as I have never heard her use ""fish"" and ""fantastic"" in the same sentence before.  The rest was just mumbling.I had been told that their burger was something special.

972,XYhe2a1QBF_hXLKvhBLPuw,Tony T.,3.0 star rating,"Came here for a late lunch on a weekday and had no problem getting seated quickly.Started with the chicken liver toast. The liver was creamy and rich, but a little too salty. The toast was perfect - it was neither too crunchy nor too hard. Also tried the deviled egg which was a little sour and a little spicy. The egg was good but not great.I ordered the burger and it was juicy and cooked as I ordered it (medium). The cheese that came on the burger was very salty, and the burger itself doesn't need condiments added to it. The bun was hearty enough for the meat. It was a good burger but not so memorable that I would say it is the best ever. The fries were not crunchy enough for me but had fried rosemary and garlic mixed in, which added a nice flavor.My wife got the Cubano sandwich. The pork was tender, and the cheese and jalapeños were great with the meat. The bread was crunchy and warm. The arugula salad had a little too much lemon and salt.The decor was kitschy with a lot of pig paraphernalia on the shelves and walls. The service was good and the food was good but if I had to wait an hour or two to eat, I would be disappointed.

974,25Lz9M4lEU9rdvtIkkLhSQ,Adam G.,2.0 star rating,"The Spotted pig is a very trendy and popular West Village haunt with all the trappings and decor of the cliched ""local"" from any of the British Isles.  However, the experience is more theme restaurant chain than small local eatery.Tables are uncomfortably close together, with hostesses consistently cramming 4 into a table that should only have 3, ensuring that one or two people in a party are sitting in the lap of the people at the next table.  Asking for something with more space is met with scowls and exasperated sighs of ""why are you being difficult just sit where i put you and shut up.""The wait staff are more pleasant, even jovial.  The camaraderie of the wait, bus and bar staff carries over nicely to their interactions with the guests.  Speaking of the bar, well stocked with competent bar tenders.  Even though ours was a but stumped by a drink he was not familiar with, he recovered well and with aplomb.The menu is decent, though perhaps does not represent the food particularly well.  The burger was somewhat overdone, and a bit more greasy than juicy.  This was compounded by the Mt. St. Helens of shoe string fries piled on top, which released their oil into the bun between the kitchen and the table.  The frittata was decently cooked, though either the ricotta cheese was too overpowering or the egg and broccoli rabe were too under seasoned, but only one of them was flavourful.The hash is rather a disaster.  It is primarily roasted and sautéed potatoes with a smattering of herbs and a vague smear of corned beef.  The poached eggs were horribly overcooked, the white rubbery and the yolks mostly set, and were only tepid.One bright note is definitely the beets and greens side dish.  The roasted beets were sweet, succulent, and thankfully, not overcooked.In all, this seems more a tourist trap than anything, and certainly not worth the hassle of the disgruntled hostesses, cramped seating, and lacklustre cuisine.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"
975,bcM_7AGJORWo7q8oyDcUiQ,Brittany L.,3.0 star rating,"Call me the odd ball but I didn't LOVE the burger! Thought it was good and worth the try but won't be craving it. Pros and Cons:1. Burger is MASSIVE. So is the bun. It's meat, cheese, bun.   - Personally, I felt the meat could have used more seasoning and the patty could have been smaller (I don't eat a lot of meat so I may be biased, however my husband who does had the same comment)- Way too much bread- Too much cheese! It was a very salty intense cheese (which I usually love) but it overpowered the burger2. Shoestring fries with fried garlic chips and fried rosemary were awesome but over salted. I did eat pretty much of all them. And would do so again if I went back. Cocktails were tasty but standard pricing for the area. Deviled eggs: awesome. You will wait half your lifetime for a table, but if you can snag a seat at the bar, go for it. The staff, while busy, was lovely- especially the bartender. Very cool experience, I'd recommend it to knock it off the NYC list.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"
976,zzrey3ywPW1yS2jYQiqVLg,Marta P.,2.0 star rating,"NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!!! As expected, it was busy on a late Saturday night. The three of us walked in around midnight. There was no one to greet us, Maitre de was standing next to us and completely ignored us. My husband was here before so he just took the lead and lead us upstairs. The ambience seemed really nice at first but what comes next was completely unnecessary and disgusting. A rather large garbage been filled with leftover food would be emptied inches away from tables and dragged down the stairs about every 15 minutes. No one carred to even close the garbage bag as it was dragged through the middle of the dining room. Does this place have a manager?? Inexcusable!!!Moving on and trying to forget the uncomfortable and the ambience was quite nice. Cozy and comfortable with nice decor and young business crowd. We are in early 30s and the crowd reminded us of what one might find in the meat packing district. Drinks were good but PRICEY. We got a table 45 minutes later but no big deal, we live in NY and are used to it.Food came about an hour later. The dishes had a nice appeal to it, that is until we tried it. All 3 of our dishes (2x burgers and 1x fish) were EXTREMELY SALTY. I could barely finish my burger. Shoe string fries were interesting at first but flavor was just ok, nothing to write home about. They were hard to eat with a fork and too small to pick up with fingers. Putting the saltiness aside and the burger and fish flavor was average. Sorry Pig but when I order your ""famous"" burger and with a premium price tag of $20 I expect to be impressed! Chefs, I don't care how many stars you have but if you don't try the food you're serving to your guests then you shouldn't be running a kitchen !! Restaurant is NOT CLEAN. Bathroom is dirty and there was no soap in the bathroom. (Yuk!)They forgot to bring my ordered drink so I had to drink water instead but it's not a big deal. The three of us must have drank a gallon of water after that dinner. We mentioned to our server the saltiness of our food but he seemed rather occupied with something more important as his only reply was ""oh? really?"". And then he wondered of.I gave it two stars because of nice decor and ambience. Food, service and cleanliness deserve a one star!There are just too many better and nicer restaurants in West Village. I would not recommend this place to anyone nor would I go back. There were other posts with similar issues so I'm hopping this review and others like it will either: a) provide some good feedback to the management so proper actions can be taken to fix the problem or b) educate decent folks to avoid this place and go somewhere better",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

No big deal.. It's NY on a Friday night. We found a pole with a shelf on it near the bar and crammed in. The place was packed with local hipsters. After sitting there awhile we finally waved down a waitress. She said she would take our order. I ordered a sprite and my friends ordered a Vodka Press.. Neither our waitress Rebecca or the bartender new how to make.. We explained vodka, soda, sprite, and a lime. I would have thought a bar of this standard would have known how to make one. We were served vodka and soda with lime. Not what we ordered! Rebecca our waitress never came back to check on us so we could get the drinks fixed. We sat there for 50 min waiting on our burger. Which turned out to be dry.. Dry meat, dry bread.. I finally saw Rebecca again and tapped her on the shoulder to get her attention. She never turned around and just shook her head ""no""... Then I thought maybe she was thinking I was a fellow waiter and she was busy. Then when she bent down to get something out of a small fridge I said ""excuse me.. When you have time could I get more sprite"".. She stood up and started to walk off. Then I yelled out ""excuse me could I..,,"" she cut me off and yelled in a snarky tone ""I heard you""... Then I eventually got a drink refill. After getting the bill I really struggled with leaving a tip.. She didn't deserve one at all. However I am in a tipping industry myself and I know everyone has a bad day. I left $10.. I would like to give her some advise: if you can't handle the stress of working in a bar maybe you shouldn't be a waitress. Also being nice to people that you rely on to give you a tip is probably a good idea. She and the other staff had time to stand at the wait station and bar and complain about things (I overheard their conversation) but yet couldn't take care of the customers because they were just too ""busy"".. The best thing about this place was the food runner that brought our food out and the fries. We ordered a devil egg but didn't get it or maybe we could have commented on that. But Rebecca never came around to check and make sure we got everything we needed.
