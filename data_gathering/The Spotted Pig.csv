0,z7dilHN7EWd3l2gTvdbdCA,Carlos D.,4.0 star rating,I am so happy that it was my first time trying out their classic burger! And I may say it was phenomenal. The fries were a little cold but it was no big deal. I had one big issue which was the temperature in the building. Downstairs it seemed pretty good but when I got upstairs I could not stop sweating! It was incredibly hot upstairs. Including the small space we chose and the little tiny chairs the heat of the upstairs made it very uncomfortable. Thank you for the amazing food,The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

We started with excellent bloody Mary's and some deviled eggs- both were very good. Very main course I had pig's cheek hash with poached eggs- it was very good- eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash was tasty. My friends got the burger w shoe string fries- they said it was real good. It def was big and juicy, and cooked perfectly. Food and service were both very good. It is tight in there and it can get very crowded. Food and Drinks were all very good.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

3,IVYnHsB6y-tUNXxdp0dcIQ,Melanie Z.,4.0 star rating,It is definitely different without your classic lettuce and tomatoes. I would admit it might not be for everyone.

4,F1tGD2s3FoPxHfiorlVDVg,Joyce C.,3.0 star rating,"I've heard about the Spotted Pig for years and finally got to go this past weekend for brunch. The food was definitely delicious, but nothing eye opening like its price point suggests. For value, I've been to better restaurants. I ordered the **Sizzling Sisig** ($17) their take on a Filipino classic. The richness of the pork fat was balanced by the tangy sours marination. It wasn't the best sisig that I've had, and for the price point of $17 (sisig usually goes for much much less), I was a disappointed. My friend had the **Two Poached Eggs and Pork Hash** ($18). The hash had an underlying sweetness which was great with its general meatiness, but again, not novel enough to justify the price tag. The staff was very kind, not only were we seated immediately but they were very accommodating in the small space.  The aesthetic of the restaurant was definitely cozy and bed-and-breakfast-in-the-countryside-y.  I'm glad I came here because I've heard so much about it, but alas, it was not a value experience that I would repeat again.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

With such a long  wait time, we figure we would have a little more time to get back to the restaurant.  Little did we know we came back and our table was given up. Irritating but understandable.  So we gave it another try the following day for lunch services, went with their famous burger and fries. The burger we decadent and rich, shoestring fries was on point, perfectly salted and fried with herbs and garlic.  Somewhat overrated but a must try if time permits.

8,pBrC08aM-pkqEVjIluBNjA,Emily M.,3.0 star rating,"I think this place is very overrated. The food was fine, but there was nothing that felt special or worth the insane waiting time. Their website says they open at 5:30 so we arrived at 5:37 thinking the wait would be quick, but it was still an hour for two people. There are about 10-15 tables which is why it takes so long to be seated, but the wait for food was also crazy. We were seated in front of the open kitchen door, with glaring fluorescent lights in our face and people constantly brushing up against us. The cocktails were fine, but tasted like juice nothing more. We ordered the gnudi, cockle special and the burger. After waiting almost an hour for the appetizers we were sent almonds as an apology for the wait. The gnudi was a good texture but very salty. After almost two hours the burger came out. It was cooked perfectly but again was very salty with nothing to cut the richness of the overpowering salty Roquefort.

The thing is I've been craving Spotted Pigs food -- specifically the deviled eggs for yeaaaars and I finally came back with my fiancé because I raved about them and needed a second opinion. Of course the consistency of the food here is amazing and they tasted just as I remembered them!!! The 3 stars are strictly for how great the food was. Chicken liver toast -- decadent Hanger steak -- mouth watering Gnudi in brown butter -- creamy And sautéed kale -- lightly seasoned and healthy portion !!!Now the service.............. might of been where the experience feel a little sophomoric. Our server seemed very ""off"" ... he recited the specials as a joke and laughed a lot and almost looked like he didn't really want to engage. And for such a small spot you'd think each guest interaction mattered. Anyway, he forgot my wine and when I told him he was like ""oh yea..."". After the food started coming out he NEVER QUALITY CHECKED A THING. No exaggeration, we didn't see him until he dropped th check off. But literally he was talking and accompanying friends at the bar the whole time and left his section untouched until a new table arrived next to ours.

15,EYmljXzTUytC1XPF51NLCA,Justin C.,4.0 star rating,"I can imagine its tough being the Spotted Pig. On one hand, you got a great establishment with overwhelming demand, on the other hand, that demand creates a bottle neck in service. Not to say that service is bad at all, if and when you do get serviced it's top notch. Wait times can be ridiculous and bar seating is first come first serve, so prepare to throw down some bows if necessary. The atmosphere is dark, fun, corky, loud, and sometimes pretentious, but with all these negatives, this place will win you over with their food and cocktails for sure. A bit bougie and upscale prices paired with the fun and laid back casual dive feel, this place serves up some serious cocktails with a true mixologist behind the bars that you would expect at a speakeasy. Perfectly crafted and executed drinks that will put hair on your chest, but it comes at a price. The nitty gritty britty food will definitely set the bar high for a gastropub. It's got that flair that makes you question if complex elevation techniques are necessary to make great food. The balance in quality ingredients with precise executions is what I feel that sets the Spotted Pig apart. The chicken liver toast is a favorite here and I would agree. It's got a really light creamy texture with all the right balance of sweet and savory. I'm a sucker for fries and the shoestring fries here are delicious. It's light and airy with perfectly fried rosemary bits and garlic slices to give it that zing. The famous burger is a solid choice but not quite worth the hype in my opinion especially at that price point. Overall, this place has its quirks that many reviewers have mentioned, but to take away from this place because its just too busy is a little harsh. It makes sense to be frustrated with wait times in NYC, it's just in our nature, so the real question is, is it worth the wait times? I guess you'll have to figure that out for yourself.

Seating is incredibly tight, I suggest the bar or anywhere not on the right side of the restaurant. They had to move the table for 1 person to get seated on a bench. Not comfortable. Menu is small, but I came for the burger and shoestring fries. If you are not fond of bleu cheese, the burger is not for you. It is heavy with cheese. The fries however are delicious, so thin and crispy. Food came out pretty quick.

18,LFnWmO-SdntnugRRqj2nDw,Brittany T.,4.0 star rating,"Really 3.5 stars, I was torn because it was better than A-OK but I'm not sure I'm a ""fan.""WAIT: No reservations means we got there at 5:27 hoping to get in quickly.  Although their hours don't reflect it, they dont start serving dinner until 5:30pm (but I think you can sit at the bar?) so we put our name down and they said for 2 people it would be about a 15 minute wait.  We sat outside waiting and around 5:48 pm or so they called us in.ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant is pretty large even though it looks small because there is an upstairs.  It's very eclectic and fun inside, not what I was imagining.  It does have white tablecloths and nice candles but the decor is very fun and witty.  Lots of pig related items.  There are small nooks and crannies to the restaurant which is nice.  We sat at a table where you sit next to each other and the table is in front.  It was a nice alcove. I could see you coming here for a date or with a girlfriend.FOOD: Of course we came here because we watched April Bloomfield in Mind of a Chef.  We knew the burger was good and after going to salvation burger wanted to try the original.CHICKEN LIVER TOAST - torn between this and the Gnudi, I went with this because it was half the price of the Gnudi! It comes with 2 pieces but is well enough for 2 people.  The bread they put it on is a nice rustic, crusty, fresh loaf.  It's thick too! Very good.  The pate itself was one of the best I've had...it wasn't overly ""liver"" tasting and the herb on top (I'm not sure what it was) gave it a meatball-ish taste.  My husband couldn't finish all of his because he said they really piled on the pate so it was too much for him.BURGER - got it medium rare, which is usually perfect for us but I think for here...I would get medium next time.  The medium rare was almost too rare where the burger was a little cold and the meat was mushy.  It wasn't like other burger places where the meat is a little more crumbly.  It comes with shoestring fries and is enough for 2 people to share.  The burger itself is pretty plain unlike some that we've had in the past.  It has the patty, the bun, and cheese.  The cheese tasted a little like a bleu cheese and was the most flavor we got out of the burger.  To the point where it overshadowed the meat.  The bun was forgettable, not super crisp on the outside but more spongey.  The shoestring fries were good, they were more like really thin, long, potato chips.Overall, I came in with low expectation since I heard it wasn't mind-blowing and Salvation Burger was good but also not amazing.  I don't think I'd come again, but it was fun to experience April Bloomfield's restaurant.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Staff was friendly, but extremely slow, which I wondered if that explained the two hour wait. For instance, it took over 40 min to order our meal and another 40 min to get the check. We did mention that we are not ready yet, but then he never checked back. Perhaps we interpreted as us wanting to be left alone but thought it was a bit long. When the burger finally arrived, I was excited to try it! It was very rare (my fault; I ordered it this way). The shoestring fries were basically salty chip strings. It was so salty, it was hard to eat.After waiting two hours and having an extremely slow and not impressive meal which I literally slept through at the tail end because I was so exhausted, I was a bit disappointed.

It's got a really light creamy texture with all the right balance of sweet and savory. I'm a sucker for fries and the shoestring fries here are delicious. It's light and airy with perfectly fried rosemary bits and garlic slices to give it that zing. The famous burger is a solid choice but not quite worth the hype in my opinion especially at that price point. Overall, this place has its quirks that many reviewers have mentioned, but to take away from this place because its just too busy is a little harsh. It makes sense to be frustrated with wait times in NYC, it's just in our nature, so the real question is, is it worth the wait times? I guess you'll have to figure that out for yourself.

Seating is incredibly tight, I suggest the bar or anywhere not on the right side of the restaurant. They had to move the table for 1 person to get seated on a bench. Not comfortable. Menu is small, but I came for the burger and shoestring fries. If you are not fond of bleu cheese, the burger is not for you. It is heavy with cheese. The fries however are delicious, so thin and crispy. Food came out pretty quick.

38,LFnWmO-SdntnugRRqj2nDw,Brittany T.,4.0 star rating,"Really 3.5 stars, I was torn because it was better than A-OK but I'm not sure I'm a ""fan.""WAIT: No reservations means we got there at 5:27 hoping to get in quickly.  Although their hours don't reflect it, they dont start serving dinner until 5:30pm (but I think you can sit at the bar?) so we put our name down and they said for 2 people it would be about a 15 minute wait.  We sat outside waiting and around 5:48 pm or so they called us in.ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant is pretty large even though it looks small because there is an upstairs.  It's very eclectic and fun inside, not what I was imagining.  It does have white tablecloths and nice candles but the decor is very fun and witty.  Lots of pig related items.  There are small nooks and crannies to the restaurant which is nice.  We sat at a table where you sit next to each other and the table is in front.  It was a nice alcove. I could see you coming here for a date or with a girlfriend.FOOD: Of course we came here because we watched April Bloomfield in Mind of a Chef.  We knew the burger was good and after going to salvation burger wanted to try the original.CHICKEN LIVER TOAST - torn between this and the Gnudi, I went with this because it was half the price of the Gnudi! It comes with 2 pieces but is well enough for 2 people.  The bread they put it on is a nice rustic, crusty, fresh loaf.  It's thick too! Very good.  The pate itself was one of the best I've had...it wasn't overly ""liver"" tasting and the herb on top (I'm not sure what it was) gave it a meatball-ish taste.  My husband couldn't finish all of his because he said they really piled on the pate so it was too much for him.BURGER - got it medium rare, which is usually perfect for us but I think for here...I would get medium next time.  The medium rare was almost too rare where the burger was a little cold and the meat was mushy.  It wasn't like other burger places where the meat is a little more crumbly.  It comes with shoestring fries and is enough for 2 people to share.  The burger itself is pretty plain unlike some that we've had in the past.  It has the patty, the bun, and cheese.  The cheese tasted a little like a bleu cheese and was the most flavor we got out of the burger.  To the point where it overshadowed the meat.  The bun was forgettable, not super crisp on the outside but more spongey.  The shoestring fries were good, they were more like really thin, long, potato chips.Overall, I came in with low expectation since I heard it wasn't mind-blowing and Salvation Burger was good but also not amazing.  I don't think I'd come again, but it was fun to experience April Bloomfield's restaurant.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Staff was friendly, but extremely slow, which I wondered if that explained the two hour wait. For instance, it took over 40 min to order our meal and another 40 min to get the check. We did mention that we are not ready yet, but then he never checked back. Perhaps we interpreted as us wanting to be left alone but thought it was a bit long. When the burger finally arrived, I was excited to try it! It was very rare (my fault; I ordered it this way). The shoestring fries were basically salty chip strings. It was so salty, it was hard to eat.After waiting two hours and having an extremely slow and not impressive meal which I literally slept through at the tail end because I was so exhausted, I was a bit disappointed.

When we walked in the hostess refused to seat us at a table claiming that the kitchen was not yet open. Only when pressed did she offer high top seats near the bar at which we sat ourselves. When I asked if I could give her my phone number or if she could let us know when a table became available (there were many available at 4pm on a Saturday) she refused saying that they were only for customers ordering food (which we eventually did). We sat ourselves at the high top and had to ask for a drink menu -- a request that made a server roll his eyes for some inexplicable reason. We had two rounds of cocktails and eventually ordered oysters and French fries. The drinks and food were great. However it is baffling to me how an establishment presumably attempting to recover its reputation after a major scandal would treat its patrons so poorly. Not only was the service slow but our server also answered our questions about the food menu with attitude and nearly refused to make any recommendations. To top it all off I was told that I was drunk when I kindly informed the bartender that the light was off in the restroom in which I had just needed the flashlight on my phone to use.

Like my logic!? We went at 12 on a Monday (today)for lunch. We were the second people seated and approximately the 10th table served - burgers arrived at 12:50. I did order an app - it was actually the (balsamic)roasted beets side - so friggin good! They have a little lingering heat that was in the greens. But I was done, not done but clearly set them away from me to indicate that I was moving on, for a solid 20 mins. To their defense, the app may have caused the kitchen to delay our entrees but it was too long. We were in clear sight of multiple members of the waitstaff. My husband didn't get an app and was starving! Now let's get to why you are searching this place out on Yelp- the burger. It was really good but I didn't say, ""that was the best burger I've ever had!"".  It was very tender but the flavor was ok. I actually thought it was a little salty. I don't know if that was the burger or the cheese? I always cut my burger in 1/2 so scraped the cheese off the second 1/2 to see if that was it and still felt it was salty. The fries were ok. I do like crispy fries and they score high there but since they are super thin, there's not much potato. So it's just really too greasy tasting. This is down to preference and the size you like your fries.A good burger. A $26 burger? I say no. I've had cheaper burgers that are equally or more satisfying.

No reservations here.  This time we came on a Friday with a decent size party (6) and was told the wait was 3 hours. We waited.We went to bars like The Happiest Hour and White Horse Tavern to kill the time. We were seated pretty quickly when we came back at 11pm for our reservation. The service was just ok, nothing special. It felt like an upscale bar / pub overall. But lots of cute decor - lots of spotted piggies!We were seated upstairs in a corner section. The table ordered deviled eggs and a pot of pickles (not really pickles, but a pot of pickled vegetables) which I chose not to enjoy. My fiancé and I split the famous chargrilled burger ($26) and sheep's milk ricotta gnudi ($23).  The gnudi was AWESOME! I loved it. Basically it's giant delicious gnocchi.  Now, I did not appreciate the burger which is surprising because I am a huge fan of the simple burger. About half of our group loved it, and the others did not like it all. So that brings me to the consensus that whether you like the burger or not is extremely personal.All in all a great night with friends, though I think I've crossed this spot off my to do list and not sure I need to return.

I can't say it's not worth the price, because it is a really good burger, but the cost does certainly raise the bar for how good the burger has to be -- as does the typical long wait time to get in. Part of me would love to try other stuff here as well, but is the other stuff worth waiting an hour and a half for?

Yes, we did stay after seeing the ridiculous prices to give the benefit of the doubt. We should have listened to that doubt!! For starters we chose the ""Deviled eggs""...well....One EGG, CUT IN TWO....$5.00. Even some very posh restaurants sell Deviled EGGS, where the customer gets at least three eggs for $8.00. Moving on , My friend had the EXTREME let down called the ""Cubano"". One thinly sliced small price of ham between a two peices of baguette five inches long and indistinguishable from deli sandwich ham with a slice of plain cheese.No chips or fries but only a little arugala on the plate. $23.00!!! My burger came cooked to order but when asked if I could get any cheese besides what they offered the server said ""no substitutions are made but he could put the cheese on the side"". I asked if I could get mayonnaise and  they informed me that the ""chef strickly forbids any change to HIS choice!"" No onion, lettuce, tomato, only ketchup was offered. The price of this burger was $26.00!

I would've liked the burger a lot without cheese (or a better cheese). Beware of Roquefort!!! Service and environment: staff was extremely friendly and helpful.

The fries are more like the fried onion pieces on green beans at Thanksgiving, but potato. The place had a lot of things to look at - owl and pig figurines, Christmas lights, other people.

When my dish came out (I got the biscuit and eggs) it was well just that a biscuit and some eggs, it was barely enough to fill me and honestly the biscuit tasted like something from Mr. Pillsbury himself had thrown away. The jam that came with the biscuit was decent, but it was just so bleh. I almost wish I had complained about the dish because everything else on the menu just sounded great.

It's a very good burger, but *probably* not in my top 10 for NYC.First, know that the waits for a table, especially during weekends and weeknights, can be very long. Fortunately, you can arrive early, put your name down, and have them text you when your table is ready. I put my name down for a party of three on a Saturday at 5:15pm. They said the table would be in ready in a hour and a half; it was ready by 6:15ish. Major props to managing expectations well!The Spotted Pig is a small restaurant, but cozy and cutely decorated with figurines, paintings, and photographs of pigs. The service is friendly and prompt, and my ""Sexy Animal"" rum cocktail, while pricey ($15), was quite tasty and strong. Definitely recommend.Now to the food. We started with the sheep's milk ricotta gnudi (think pasta balls filled with cheese), which was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Seriously, *this* is the dish that should be getting the hype. The cheese was rich, and the pasta al dente, all doused in a rich brown butter sage sauce. It was like Italian mac and cheese in its highest, most sophisticated form.Next, the talk-of-the-town burger. As big a burger fan as I am, I tried to forget the hype and focus on the meal. The burger does look as amazing as it does from the pictures, and seeing that bushel of shoestring fries next to a perfectly cooked burger on a chargrilled bun does make for an Instagram-ready picture. And...the burger is quite good! The sharp Roquefort made for an ideal complement to the juicy (but somewhat under-seasoned) patty, and due to its richness, you didn't feel bad not having other toppings on the burger. And the garlic fries were also tasty, although a little hard to eat due to their thinness and curly nature. You definitely leave the meal full and satisfied.BUT...this burger is good, but not $26-level amazing. The patty's seasoning just isn't memorable enough for me to be ready and willing to pay that much. That for me is the gap between 4 and 5 stars here - the high prices and the long wait. That being said, I still had a tasty meal at Spotted Pig, and look forward to returning to try some of their other options.

Got it medium rare. Meat is juicy and patty is decently sized. However the flavor complexity wasn't up to par with the black label at minetta which still stands as number one burger for me. blue cheese somewhat overpowered the burger meat as well. Ppl at the table also not a fan of the shoestring fries as they were quite difficult to eat. Star of the dish was the HOMEMADE KETCHUP, def not heinz. Particularly loved the hint of spiciness. #Chicken liver toast: perhaps the best dish of the night, this I highly recommend. 2 large pieces of toast with heaping of chicken liver, a must try.#flowerless chocolate cake with dap of ""creme fraiche"": really decadent and an excellent end to otherwise lackluster meal. creme fraiche was necessary to cut into the thick rich choco. Forgetables: meh muscles dish, meh skate. friend was skirt steak was also only ok.  Veggie sides: the brussel sprouts were a little bit too on the bitter side and not infused with the caramelized flavor. Large chunks of bacon were good but didn't blend with the sprouts enough. ####Carrots were solid with good thyme flavor and roasted garlic and a nice char.

The burger took 40 minutes to arrive (but ok, it's the holiday season, I understand) and could be warmer when I bit into it. It was a minimalistic burger with a set of pretzel buns, a beef patty, and some cheese. A week later, now that I am writing about it, I can't even think of anything that stood out particularly, leave alone the emotions it evoked, which was non-existent. The shoestring fries were spiced with rosemary and thyme and were crispy and airy. They tasted like your regular fries with some interesting texture...the interest soon faded as I realized that I was eating another hype. Of course there was no special dipping to distract me from the supposedly deep essence of the burger and fries. Chewing on my dry fries and lukewarm burger, I wondered if everything would be different if I were more drunk and not single. Anyways, the decor was rustic and cozy. The gastropub is famous. The burger was $18 before tax - mildly impressive if you want to impress.

It should be known that I was very excited to try this restaurant after hearing its praises from celebrity chefs and those ""in-the-know.""I gave this much-hyped restaurant two stars because I would have given it three stars if the meal was half the price. We had two deviled eggs ($5ea.) for a starter, they were great!   My girlfriend was not very hungry, so she ordered the pork rilletes ($20) which was dry and unseasoned under a thick layer of lard. The accompanying pickles and mustard were to her liking, as was the crusty bread that came with it. I had to go for the famous burger.  A good burger?  Yes, but not a great burger, under-seasoned as it was, and definitely not worth the $26 price tag.  It's not even in my top 20.  The shoestring fries that complete the plate are tasty, but difficult to eat: it's weird to eat them one by one because they're so small, and hard to shove a handful of them in your mouth without getting salt all over your face.  Drinks from the bar were decent, and well executed.  There was an inch of water on the floor in the bathroom. Price for a burger, a few drinks (2 mixed and a beer) and a few apps for two with a tip: $130. I wouldn't eat the meal again for half the price, which is a shame.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

We were there right when it opened and there was no wait. I tried the burger (I had to after all of the hype!) and it was okay. Like it was a decent burger but really nothing special. I've definitely had better burgers in nicer settings (looking at you Nomad). We had the special which was braised pork cheek on toast. This is probably a better showcase of what the chefs can really do. It was very good with a perfect amount of spice, but again nothing great. For what it's worth the fries with the burger (with fresh rosemary and I believe shallots) were seriously excellent. The hit of the table. The cask ale was also good if you like cask ale.The service was personable but it was definitely a wait even though we were seated right away. It certainly was a good meal and I actually found the price point fair. It wasn't that expensive for what it was and is. However, I just didn't find almost any of the meal memorable. It could have been a dozen other restaurants in New York and if I didn't know it was the spotted pig I would have left satisfied.

115,oiEXgokoWmsZH-ViT4N0TQ,Patrick M.,3.0 star rating,"I will preface this review by stating I was excited to try The Spotted Pig. The restaurant regularly comes up in friends' lists of places to try while in New York usually couched with the statement, ""...and try the burger it is the best in NYC!"" So we lucked into showing up and being seated immediately. We started the meal with some epicurean bites (chicken liver toast, deviled eggs and devil's bareback,) which were novel and good quality. The devil's bareback is their take on sweet and savory. The bar bite is a fig stuffed with peach purée all wrapped in bacon. The fig proved a good pairing with their sazerac and set an optimistic tone for the main course. Shortly after our bar bites, the burgers arrived and they looked fantastic. Unfortunately, the excitement stopped at the appearance. The burger is good...but not great. It is good quality meat, but too lean and the burger suffers for it. The lack of a juicy flavorful patty leaves the Roquefort cheese driving the flavor profile, which, for me, is underwhelming. The redeeming element of the burger is the shoestring fries. The fries are excellent notes of rosemary and garlic are wonderful. Overall The Spotted Pig provides good food, but suffers from its own hype. Perhaps the burger was better two years ago, but I have had better burgers in the city for half the price of TSP's offering.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

We were texted just at 30 minutes and were seated upstairs in a corner spot at a very small round table for two.  This little corner of the restaurant somehow sat 12 people but we still didn't feel crowded.  Took the menu - but we were here for the burger.  Period.  Yes it is $25 and we knew that going in - but worth every penny.  We both got the burger which was on a grilled bun and smothered with Roquefort cheese.  It truly needed nothing else.  Every bit was mouthwatering and it was cooked to our request.  A heaping portion of shoe string fries with garlic and rosemary accompanied the burger and were an added bonus to the meal.  They were delicious - just hard to eat with a fork, so we used our fingers, but they broke easily and well..... as messy and hard to eat as it may have been...we did not leave one on our plate.  The glasses of wine and beer were perfect with the meal and it was enough that we did not order dessert.  This had been bookmarked for some time and knowing the prices - it was worth the wait!  I would love to save and go back again!",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

The chargrilled burger was really, really good, but I'm annoyed to have paid more than $25 on it, in a city home to Shake Shack and Burger Joint. The Spotted Pig was taken off the Michelin guide last year, which was a big deal for some people. I last visited before that (this review is a couple of months late) and we were very lucky to have standing room on the edge of a counter upstairs -- any table for our group would have taken over an hour. Shoestring potatoes are fun (do order those), we ate the entire bar menu, and we had a few beers each.

121,o8VqJdeJK6X-RU22hFcWfw,Ed U.,4.0 star rating,"Believe it or not, I tried coming to April Bloomfield's ridiculously popular West Village spot twice before and failed. On both occasions, it was after attending some Broadway musical, and knowing that they are open until 2AM, I just figured I could waltz right in around midnight and grab a bite since it is after all, a simple gastropub that doesn't accept reservations. The first time I was simply snickered at for making a futile attempt as the bar was fully packed. I had more hope the second time around since the host told me it would be just a half-hour. An hour later, I gave up and went to the nearby and aptly named Swine where drunk hipsters simply stared at me while I ate at 1:30AM (review: bit.ly/1YnEOm2). Well, it turned out the third time was a charm.This time, Jamie W. was with me, and he wisely suggested we stroll over from our SoHo hotel at around noon when they opened rather than before they closed. Smart move as we waited only fifteen minutes for the perfect table for two, while there were other couples who had to sit at a tiny counter around a brick column. While the skirt steak and skate were not available, the brunch menu is pretty robust with Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and Dutch Babies offered alongside Oysters and Pork Rilettes (photo: bit.ly/1tnMWXO). Yummy-sounding stuff even if it is standard brunch fare but mind you, rated with a Michelin star. Choices came surprisingly easy as we started with the $5 Deviled Egg with the deviled yolks were whipped to attain height with the chives sprinkled liberally (photo: bit.ly/1tnM31J).Then came the $6 Pot of Pickles, the pot turning out to be a bevy of pickled vegetables with a nicely sour edge (photo: bit.ly/1tnMl8M). Even though the portion was a bit paltry, the $16 Bibb Salad with Shaved Radish and Mustard Vinaigrette was refreshing with a nice tang (photo: bit.ly/28AMSEF). Jamie and I then diverged on our main plates. He went for the $20 Cubano Sandwich with Arugula Salad (photo: bit.ly/25UrFGU). A crusty-good, flattened bread roll was offset by the meltably good pulled pork with the lightly dressed arugula leaves providing a nice peppery flavor. I ordered their classic $25 Chargrilled Burger, which turned a half-pound mixture of brisket, sirloin, short rib and chuck into a luscious, medium-rare patty caught in a cross-hatched brioche bun topped with Roquefort cheese.The addictive aspect of this plate is the mile-high pile of shoestring fries which really requires at least two people to devour with gusto (photo: bit.ly/1VWEB9h). Satisfying as all that was, nothing quite prepared us for the $10 Seasonal Tart which was an artful delicacy with rhubarb and crème fraîche that was simply indescribable in its deliciousness (photo: bit.ly/25UpWBI). This was Bloomfield's artistry at work for sure. So congratulate me, I finally made it to The Spotted Pig and now I get why this is such a big draw among hip, young New Yorkers seeking peer approval for their dining choices. I've learned my lesson in not looking for a table at the midnight hour unless I'm really drunk or very patient. Trust me I'd be more likely the former than the latter.FOOD - 4 stars...Bloomfield's talents are in full force on the tart, the other items amount to solid pub grubAMBIANCE - 4 stars...a bit crowded but great people-watchingSERVICE - 3.5 stars...attentive enough even if there was a tinge of been-there-done-that in their approachTOTAL - 4 stars...third time's the charm and it was worth the effort...do Jay Z, Bono and Mario Batali really co-own this place? wonder what the management meetings are like",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I, too, had heard of this burger and I was ready to try it. We got there at 6pm on a Thursday so we were seated immediately, even though the table was less of a normal restaurant table and more of a square piece of driftwood shoved in between a pillar and what was probably the original exit for the restaurant? Either way, it was dark as hell, cramped and all three stools at this table just felt in the way for every other real table around us. OK, fine, ambiance, got it. The restaurant itself is cute, the servers are all friendly and I like that there are just hooks -everywhere- around this place for your shit. It's actually kind of great. Though in winter the downside is that it starts to feel like you're eating in a coat closet because you're literally surrounded by everybody's shit.Our burgers get served and they sure do look purdy- those shoe string fries are piled up like a mountain, and the buns have those perfect grill marks and it all looks like you're about to eat a magazine. Then the problems start.... First problem - The burger tastes disgusting. Like, I don't know, first bite you're like ""woah, okay"" and then second bite you're like ""is this just salt? Is this a gallon of salt?"" and then third bite you're like ""fuhhhk I gotta finish this shit because I paid too much for it.""Second problem - Those fries are great but they're impossible to eat. How do you eat these damn fries?? You can't pick them up because they're so thin and go everywhere and my mouth isn't big enough to just shove an unruly bundle of potato sticks in there. Like, unless you eat them one by one, you can't pick them up. So I tried with a fork which was strangely easier, but still hard. I gave up half way through because I was already out-salted by that horrible burger so I couldn't handle more fries even though they were 10x better tastingThird problem - It's so goddamn dark it was impossible to see what I was eating... I asked for chef's choice on how the burger was cooked and they said that was medium-rare. Ok, sounds good. But even in the darkness I could tell this was more 'rare' than 'medium' which just became a texture turn off, eating some wet ball of salt in the dark. (This also makes me wonder if this was related to my fifth problem coming up...)Fourth problem - Considering how damn salty this dish is, it's a bummer that the water carafe no longer fits on the tiny-ass table once your actual meal is served.Fifth problem - Look, I'm not saying that I woke up at 4am and threw up this burger but ............ I woke up at 4am and threw up this burger. I don't know what caused it, maybe it was the two beers I had later that night, maybe it was the way the moonlight reflected off of the ocean, maybe it was a huge pit of grease and salt that was STILL SITTING IN MY STOMACH 10 hours later and my body was like ok screw this thing and ordered me to deposit $25 into my toilet the wrong way.I was like ok with the concept of paying $25 for a burger that you get to eat on a stool in a dark and crowded coat closet, but I was not prepared for the disgusting saltiness of that thing. I don't know what happened here, maybe this place was great a couple years ago or something, maybe they had an off night, maybe -I- had an off night...

I'm so glad that I did!Even on a random Thursday, this place was pretty busy, about an hour long wait, but that gave me a chance to walk around and explore the neighborhood and chat with folks while I waited for a seat.I don't generally go out and eat solo, so I wasn't sure how they would respond with me taking up a table, but the service was terrific. They were friendly, helpful, and very polite throughout the entire meal.I started with the olives, they were good, but nothing special, just three or four different types. The real treat began with the ricotta gnudi. They were just a touch chewy on the outside with a delicious creamy inside. They were bathed in a white sauce and topped with just a bit of bitter pesto. When you had a bite with all the flavors, including the walnuts, it was divine.For my entree I decided on their steak. It came out perfectly medium rare with charred onions, broccoli rabe, and topped with a romesco sauce. The meat was easy to slice, flavor and when combined with the smoky flavor of the onions or broccoli was absolutely terrific. I tend to have steaks out when I can, since I don't cook them at home too frequently and this was one of the best ones I've had in a very long time. The flavors were always perfectly balanced so each bite was an utter joy.I decided to splurge and have dessert, and went with their flourless chocolate cake. This was the richest, most decadent chocolate cake I've ever had. It tasted like the just melted down the darkest chocolate that you can find and reshaped it into a softer block of delicious chocolate goodness. It was paired with a very sour creme fraiche that was great to help cut through the denseness of the cake. Paired with an Averna, this was a pure delight, one that I probably didn't need to finish, but I did because it was so tasty.The other items looked good, most tables had the burger which made me a little envious until my steak arrived.

On a freezing Thurs evening our group of six still ended up waiting over an hour for a table, even putting our name down at 6pm. We decided to post up near the bar downstairs and have some drinks. Wine per glass was a bit pricey ($14). We got sat upstairs and crammed/ cozied up to one another while hunching over on low stools, not the most comfortable. We ordered a round of burgers, some deviled eggs, almonds, Brussels sprouts and stracciatella. I think the burger was my least favorite thing we got, and that's why we came! The quality of the burger patty was excellent, full of juicy flavor, but I found the Roquefort to be aggressive and combined with the bun made the burger dry. Definitely had to add a heavy layer of the delicious house Dijon mustard to burger. The shoe string fries frustrated me, I've never felt more like a human shovel then trying to eat those things.

The management staff are great, the host staff are great, the bar staff are great, the runners are great, the servers & back waiters are great. The kitchen is SHOCKING. At a table for two which could barely hold a single entree plate and two bread plates once all our glasses and wine bottle were on it, they actually tried to serve us three dishes simultaneously! They took away our table water (and then never filled the glasses again), and we put the wine on the floor (which the hipster jackasses eating cheeseburgers at the table next to us kept nearly kicking over) to make room for the second one, but we insisted they take the third one away. Near as we can tell, this crashed the kitchen; by the time we left the couple on the other side of us had been waiting 20 minutes for their second course. So much for whomever expedites the kitchen. The food was completely mediocre. Four courses: The gnudi were harshly over-seasoned and otherwise unremarkable in every way. The skate was somehow both overcooked and seemed raw at the same time. It had no color, no texture, was also over seasoned and the sauce and garnish were bland. It was a huge plate of white, gummy salt. The squid on toast was completely under seasoned. The toast had been allowed to go soggy. The pork cheek, when we finally got it, was a joke. Unmistakable from short ribs (by which I mean beef) and swimming in a pool of runny grits which were supposed to be polenta. If Chef April has not checked in on this kitchen recently, she should.

Well, the limited menu selection -- approximately 3/4 menu unavailable -- that Saturday afternoon at 3:45 pm and the hefty wine by the glass prices made it difficult to give it a full 5 stars. But why dwell on the negative, right? Right! Let's talk about the positives.The burger, corn soup, and salad were all excellent, as was the service, which was attentive, friendly, and professional. As a former hospitality professional of 20 yrs., good service can make up for many failings, including a depleted menu. Besides the aforementioned pluses, a BIG plus goes to the entire staff who made us -- 4 adults and a 3 yr. old --feel welcomed. Far too often establishments that have achieved such acclaim are unwelcoming to guests with small children.

The bun is grilled nicely for some crisp while the inside has some melted cheese and juicy beef. The shoe string fries are good, a little thin, but good.

The night began with my boyfriend and myself knowing that they didn't take reservations, so we went to put our name in before heading over to Employees Only for a few drinks while we waited. The hostess told us it was a 2 hour wait, and that was fine with us considering it was a Saturday night and we arrived at 7:45. Fast forward 2 hours- we went back to the Spotted Pig to check on our reservation, as it had been 2 hours and at this point was quarter of 10:00 and we were starving. The hostess proceeded to tell us it was going to be another 40 minutes for a table for two people!!! We had already waited this long but is any food (particularly ""fancy"" bar food) really worth a 3 hour wait?! So we proceeded to the upstairs bar to kill more time where we ordered bar snacks ( FYI- the deviled eggs is literally one whole egg. $5 for one whole egg.... not sure why this offended me in the dining world of NYC but it did...)The best part of the story next- we were finally seated after a 2 hr 20 min wait and we put in an order for our food. We ordered the Shisito peppers to start, which is the only reason I'm even giving this place one star because they were good. My boyfriend and I put in our order right away and each got the burger ($26), as that's what this place is known for. We then proceeded to have a front seat view of watching our waitress catching up with what looked to be a friend for 30 mins while we still didn't have our dinner and at this point it's 11:00 at night. I had to get a girl who was bussing tables to get our waitress's attention to tend to us and tell us where the heck our dinner was. Finally after getting her attention and asking, she comes out with our food, that was ~obviously~ sitting in the kitchen ready to be brought out. As for this ""epic burger,"" save your $26 each and go to McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's.... you catch my drift. Simply a beef patty with blue cheese, nothing else and so extremely disappointing. By this point, you can tell that my boyfriend and I would never go back to this place that has supposedly won a Michelin Star for the past 9 years. The worst service I have ever experienced in any restaurant, even more so one that charges $5 for an egg and $26 for a hamburger. Save your money and do not ever go to this place.

144,GTqFigJMVKddDRC5uImkSg,Millie S.,5.0 star rating,"The Spotted Pig is tucked into a quiet corner at 11th and Greenwich, so covered on the outside with greenery and flourishing plant tendrils and upward-creeping vines that you might inadvertently pass it on the first go. Walking in, you get the oddest sensation of having entered an uncanny mix between your fusty grandmother's house and a proper English pub. The curtains and stool coverings can't quite decide if said grandmother misplaced them or if they're just 'vintage'. There seem to be all sorts of ovine, bovine, and porcine paintings, drawings, and plates hung ever-so-slightly carelessly on the walls in whatever spaces will fit them. Plants, both real and illustrated, cover the rest. All of it is charming. It's cozy and smaller than expected, and certainly different than expected. For years, I'd envisioned The Spotted Pig as a stereotypically dimly-lit tavern-esque deal. And, well, maybe it actually is, at night. But I stopped by at 3pm when the windows still let in the afternoon light, and the first floor somehow made me feel as cool and hip (and ok, slightly kitschy) as stepping into any of today's trendy Australian cafes does. As for the food? I started off with the chicken liver toast, which it turned out to be incredibly delicious, if also incredibly salty. I'm not usually much one for offal, but the liver was creamy, not overpoweringly rich, and paired perfectly with the crisp toast - add a squeeze of lemon and a dab of Dijon, a passing waiter told me with a wink. He was correct (listen to your waiters, I've long learned). If only it were less salty! I ate my two toasts, then gulped down a full glass of water.Finally, the long-awaited burger and the infamous heaping pile of shoestring fries. I didn't even get a proper picture because I was so eager to try it right away, and it was easily the best burger I've ever had. Thick, juicy beef. Creamy, melty, stinky, salty Roquefort dripping down the sides. Fluffy yet sturdy grilled brioche holding it all together. And that's it. Just meat, cheese, and bread; no need for lettuce or tomato or anything else, because it simply didn't need anything else. The patty didn't do the dreaded backslide (you know, where it slips out the back of the bun until you have a burger mullet - all bread and business in the front, beef party in the back) until the very end. It was almost too salty as well, but a small swipe in the Dijon from earlier remedied that quite nicely.I wasn't sure how exactly to eat my leaning tower of rosemary garlic fries - they really put 'string' in shoestring fries, and you feel a bit silly eating them by hand (imagine eating a salad by hand, it's the same floppiness level), and I didn't want to be that person looking clueless over how to eat a plate of fries - so I used a fork. My hat goes off to the person in the kitchen in charge of julienning the potatoes.

We arrived around 7:00pm on a Friday and were quoted 2 hours. We sat down at 10:15. We're good at passing time and actually had quite a ""night"" or whatever you want to call it when you go barhopping at that hour.I really wish they had a texting system where you give you phone number and they let you know when you're table is ready because we had to keep checking in which was fairly annoying. Finally, however, our number was called (not literally, of course) and we snagged a table along the window.I'd describe the ambiance as intimate and charming. There's an old school feel to the place and it's definitely a bit tight...not ideal for private conversations or first dates.It took a while for our waiter to come take our order, though this was no problem because we were well-prepared as we'd been studying the menu all week. First up was the deviled eggs. The whites were perfectly boiled and the yolk-stuff was perfectly creamy - a great consistency and great flavor.I'm sure you want to know about the burger, though. It's served with Roquefort cheese (which is a type of blue cheese) and that's very important to know. Personally, I hate blue cheese. However, I also absolutely insist on enjoying famous dishes the way they were intended to be enjoyed. I will say that the patty and the bun were both marvelous. Though I didn't enjoy the cheese, I can confidently say that anyone who DOES enjoy blue cheese, or even just doesn't hate it, will thoroughly enjoy this burger. I think it is well worth the wait. They aren't stingy with the shoestring fries either, which are nothing short of delightful. Peppered with rosemary and garlic, they're crunchy and just perfect.As long as you're prepared to wait and know what you're getting yourself into, this is a stop worth making.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I do not normally write reviews as I am writing a book about my quest and it'll contain my reviews in detail BUT I am making an exception here and I'll make it short. I have not seen a more overhyped burger place like this since Shake Shack at its rise. While Shake Shack earned that hype for a while, this place did not. I have been planning to visit since 2010 and I finally did today. I've tried burgers from 1$ to 50$. For a 26$ burger, I expect that burger to be made of a holy cow, the taste of which is unrivaled by the likes of other cows. I expect the burger to call my name. Instead, I got a burger that Wendy's burger (which I had for 2$ with tax) was far better. Although I must be fair to the chef for cooking the burger to medium in a perfect manner. Hence, the second star. Will I ever be back again? Absolutely not.

Later we found out they charged us $14 for two bottles of flat water, which at no point did they mention they would be doing.  We ordered a side of olives and received a small handful for $8. The entrée choices on the menu were small. Both me and my dinner date ordered the hamburger with the shoestring fries because it seemed like the only reasonable thing to order. Despite the hype, there was nothing fantastic about it.  There was some garlic in the fries, and interesting grill marks on the bun, but that's it.  However for $26 a plate it was not worth it, and I hate to say it, I have had better at fast food restaurants.  In total, our bill was $90 for two hamburgers, a fistful of olives, water, and backache from uncomfortable seating.

There's isn't a lot of toppings, or even ingredients it seems like, but the meat is cooked in such a superior manner, this is all that's needed. Furthermore, the amount of fries given are so generous that their is practically a haystack of rosemary and garlic fries atop your already ample sized plate.

They don't take reservations, but if you come early or after 10pm there should be no wait. Food is quite delicious and the service is great too! My favorite item on the menu is the steak with kale and mushrooms. It's just so tasty and cooked just right! Their deviled eggs, oysters and the chowder are also really great, especially the chowder. Cocktails here are also divine...I really liked the Battle of Marciano. Oh yeah, and their seasonal desserts are great! If you saved room definitely try the flourless chocolate cake!! I've been here a few times and prefer the upstairs to the downstairs. The ambiance is that of your eccentric uncle's house who collects pig-related items and antiques. Really cute and inviting.

The wait can be interminable but they will text you when your table is ready so, do not be deterred. We went for the burger. We ended up ordering much more - chicken liver toast ($9) and roasted almonds ($4).The chicken liver toast ($9) with two slices is enough for four. Two thick slices of baguette arrive grilled with a slurry of chicken liver spread across the bread. The bread gives that burned, crusty taste while the chicken liver is buttery, rich and thick. Get two orders. The Cubano ($19) is mediocre - do not order it. A thin layer of meat which is dry and mealy is sandwiched between two hard pressed pieces of baguette. The cheese is almost absent. The whole sandwich is dry and lacking in any fat - mayonnaise, grease from the grill, butter? Please?The chargrilled burger ($22) is overpriced for what it is. The beef is delicious: rich, fatty, hearty and tender. Albeit, somewhat gristly - see photo of chunks on plate. I am sure it is a complex blend of beef but it isn't as juicy as it should be for $22. Check the photo - the juices of a halved burger were not nearly ""flowing.""Cooked to the requested medium rare, the roquefort cheese is overpowering. An american or cheddar or gruyere would be more amenable to the meat underneath. Anything would be better. I suppose that it's my personal preference to never have blue cheese on a burger - I think the stinky element of most blue cheeses overwhelms the rich, fatty beef in almost all burgers. A gorgonzola is a slightly milder option which I think would work well here.The bun is a large, egg coated brioche bun that is grilled but again, lacks any fat.Fries with rosemary shoestring are excellent. They are crispy and well salted. String cut. Soaked in water overnight? Almost certainly. The service professional and quick. The drinks are delicious. The atmosphere is hopping but subdued at the same time. Two levels of worn and grooved, wide plank floors await. Enjoy.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

We were really keen on trying it because my boyfriend thought the burger looked good. Plus, this is one of the most affordable Michelin-starred restaurants in NYC. It's understandable why Spotted Pig is notorious for having a really long wait. We were lucky enough to think ahead and arrived at about 4 PM for a ""late lunch."" There is a late lunch menu, which is the same are the regular lunch/brunch menu except there are asterisks by the items you're allowed to order. This menu was very limited but still included the burger my boyfriend wanted, so we went for it. There was no wait at all when we arrived, even though it was already pretty full. We were seated upstairs at a table that was so close to the other tables that it felt like communal seating. The waiter dropped by a grand total of two times: once to take our orders and once to bring our check. We had to wait a loooong period of time between receiving waters (which we waited for for several minutes before we were even acknowledged), taking orders, receiving food, getting the check, and waiting for them to actually pick up our credit card. Service was cordial and not by any means rude, but inattentive. My boyfriend ultimately said the burger was good, but he was a little underwhelmed by the fries and was disappointed by the $25 price tag. They definitely inflate prices here because of the Michelin star and unexplained popularity. They can get away with it. I wish we had made it in time for the brunch menu because it looked a lot more intriguing and promising than the limited late afternoon menu. There's a lot of great food to eat in NYC, so this won't make our list for future visits.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

The complete experience (super sweet and attentive waiter) is really deserving of 5 stars but the overall food seemed to be quite mediocre...  For the appetizers we ordered the Devils on Horseback and the Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi. The ricotta felt a little too heavy and kind of like I was eating a straight cheese ball. I was much a bigger fan of the devils on Horseback, it was an explosion of various tastes/flavors with each bite - juicy and rich with flavor from the bacon but sweet and potent taste from the pear. For my entree, I opted for the special - pot roast baby chicken. The chicken itself was super tender and just melted in your mouth, the definition of how pot roast should be cooked. I wasn't a huge fan of having to navigate all the tiny bones that accompanied the baby chicken... It was also swimming in vinegar which had a tendency to splash and make a little bit of a mess. My sister did go with the burger so I had the opportunity to try the burger and shoe string fries. The burger was superb but not amazing in comparison to the most recent burger I've eaten at Whitman's - I'd definitely give the nod to the Whitman's burger.

I had to dump ketchup on the fries and used my fork for this finger food. Only upside is the fries were very crispy and flavor was enhanced by the simple herb: rosemary. Not impressed at all.Also had order the crispy pigs ear salad and ricotta filled pasta dumplings. Crispy pigs ear salad was mediocre. One cartridge ear, battered, and deep fried. Very oily. The ricotta filled pasta dumplings were the best. Deliciously covered with a pesto sauce. However, the price is very steep for just 7 dumplings ($20).

The blue cheese is strong though and towards the last few bites it does become monotonous. I really love the taste of the meat and how it pairs with the blue cheese for the most part though. Additionally, the sides of spicy mustard give the burger a nice pop or can be a good pairing with the shoestring fries. The environment is really trendy and very interesting because it is compact and always full and vibrant. I think the fries are delicious and are a great compliment to the burger! Despite the crowdedness the ambiance is very unique and makes for a great overall experience to enjoy some very tasty food. The menu has some amazing food choices for both dessert and dinner options that make the place very enticing. Despite a very high price point for a lot of things on the menu, it is worth the experience if you can afford to shell out more cash than usual for a nice meal.

I mean this was a table for two that they turned into a table for three. Plus you are seated on short squat stools instead of chairs. Cramped and uncomfortable to say the least. I did love the decor, though, and every piece in this restaurant seems to fit perfectly into the dark, cozy pub theme.For food, we started with the deviled egg, marinated olives and devils on horseback (bacon wrapped date). The olives were nice and the egg was very tasty (drizzled in olive oil, herbs and salt), but I did not love the dates. They simply weren't sweet at all and seemed to lack flavor. Next came the goat cheese gnudi and the burger. I have been hearing about these gnudi for YEARS and I just wish I had managed to get them when they came served in the butter sage sauce. They are now being served in pesto and I really felt the salty taste of the pesto overpowered the soft, airy goat cheese. The texture was unbelievable, however, and superb.

For a cramped Gastropub I would not expect such an attentive, patient, and well trained waiter. This young man even folded napkins when one left their seat! Wonderful! I first got the pig ear salad - which I highly recommend! The pig ears are quite fatty, so there are small lemon pieces in the salad to cut through the fat. When you composed a perfect bite of the appropriate lemon, bitter green, and fatty pig ear - it was quite the experience! Thankfully, the individual components were delicious as well - which is very important. Everything was very fresh and I assume local. I also tried that famed burger. I ate half of it, which was quite a feat as it is very rich. If you eat the burger patty on its own you realize it has the potential to be the 'best burger ever' - but as it comes out, unfortunately, I wasn't super impressed with it. Firstly, I think the intense crunchy and salty flavor of the fries make the paired burger almost seem lacking... As I ate I kept wondering, what does this need? It needs something! I thought, well, blue cheese is not my favorite, perhaps if it was cheddar? No, it needs some other texture or flavor... THEN, without warning, my dinner partner slapped his bun on the fries and pulled up a layer of them to enjoy ON his burger! BURGER-ELEVATED! So, if you are not super impressed by the burger, put your fries on it - it's delicious! (sorry, chef!)

The restaurant is really cute, has a nice sized upstairs which seats a lot of customers for a West Village restaurant. The place has a very home-like feel where everyone is seated close together, but I didn't feel cramped.What we ordered: 2 Chargrilled Burgers w/ Roquefort Cheese1 Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi w/ Pesto1 Plate of Market VeggiesThe gnudi was fantastic, and had an amazing smooth, creamy ricotta filling. The veggies were also delicious, perfectly seasoned and cooked. There was a unique selection on the plate, but to be honest it was all mixed together so at times I didn't know what I was eating. It was all devoured. And lastly, my reason for coming here: the burger. It was cooked medium rare, which is fine with me, but it wasn't melt in my mouth amazing, or anything special. Maybe it was the Roquefort cheese, which is not my favorite. I also wasn't a fan of the ""shoestring fries"" which my friends and I all compared to potato stix.

I'd been watching her in the series of Mind of a Chef and was dying to visit the spotted pig when I came to NY. However...this place let me down. I think that everything that we had was a bit one-noted. Very muted in terms of flavour profile. Although we did not have anything that wasn't palatable...I can't find a reason to want to revisit considering the price tag. Gnudi (4/5)Most impressive thing on the menu. And as promised ""fluffy pillows of delight""...but not after the first 3. This is something you have to share as it is super rich and creamy despite being pillowy in texture. Pigs Ear Salad (3 out of 5)It was crispy the pigs ear (as you would want it to be) and the dressing was tart which helped cut through the greasy ears. It was served with raddichio, frisee and other greens that were bitter to counter the acidity and the grease. Although balanced, I did not really care for it.Chowder (3 out of 5)The homemade crackers were a nice touch but I guess with the price of the chowder I expected to be blown away. The chowder was peppery, creamy and...a lot like how I could have made it at home.Chicken Liver Toast (3 out of 5)Ok, a lot of people here sayin' that the chicken liver toast was good even if you don't like liver. LIES. I don't like liver, but I can occasionally appreciate a good pate but after the first few bites, I was a bit overwhelmed by how liver-y it was.

Unfortunately a pint was $10, which is quite expensive for beer. I'm also not a huge fan of the setting here.

Because it was so hot outside, we were able to be seated right away with no wait even though it was the weekend.For our meal, we started with the pickle plate and then got an order of the Bibb salad and the famous burger.The pickle plate was nothing special--a good variety of veggies, but definitely on the lower end of pickled veggie plates that I've ordered.The Bibb salad was also just alright, but lacked excitement and just seemed sort of plain--and at $17, was a bit of an overcharge.We had high expectations for the $25 burger, and while the fries were very good, we felt that the burger did not even come close to living up to the hype. It was cooked well, but just lacked any sort of flavor that I could tell. Even the cheese did not add much to the overall dish. I am a burger snob for sure, but this has got to be one of the most underwhelming burgers I have ever add--especially considering the high price tag.Overall, the service here was spotty and I wasn't a huge fan of the backless chairs, but I guess that's their schtick.

226,C7FmAMSIsn0006w6gCh1MA,Jaci H.,4.0 star rating,"As a New Yorker, I'm ashamed to say it took me all this time to stop by and check out their famed burger. My husband and I were in the area and figured ""why not?"" It was a steaming hot Sunday and we arrived around 6pm. They open at 5:30, so we figured there would be a long wait but we weren't that hungry yet. The spot is cute - a lot more casual than I anticipated. I would have passed by had we not noticed the little pig sign hanging outside. The hostess was nice and asked for a name and phone number explaining that we'd receive a text when a table became available within the next hour or so. An hour wait wasn't a huge deal for us, but then noticed a bunch of people left the bar to head to their table. SCORE! We ended up just sitting at the bar and hanging out with the really awesome bartender. We drank a few beers before even placing our order. It was very chill, we had AC and cold beers - exactly what we needed. We shared the crispy pig ear salad, which was recommended to us. Neither of us had ever ventured into pig ear territory. It was battered and deep fried and reminded me of bacon in flavor. It was strange but I thought it was really tasty and lends itself well to the salad that was very tart from a lemon, caper vinaigrette. Definitely worth a shot if you want to try something different. My husband didn't like the texture of the pig's ear so it was mine, all mine! We saw everyone ordering the burger and realized it was larger than we anticipated, so we shared this. We ordered one with the Roquefort cheese on the side and cooked medium. It arrived about 20 minutes after our salad, which was a little long but expected due to the crowds. (This place is always crowded). It arrived perfectly cooked with a little dish of Roquefort on the side and a giant pile of shoestring french fries. The burger was delicious with a little ketchup and mustard. I honestly should have just ordered one myself and felt like a total glutton. My husband was glad the cheese was on the side since it was too strong to taste any of the good quality meat. It just overpowered the burger, so he had to scrape it off. The fries, although tasty, are a pain in the ass to eat. It's a terrible waste since most people end up ignoring them because they're so tiny and crispy that you can't pick them up and dip them in ketchup. You can dab your fork in ketchup and then stab your fork to get a nice bite, but it was just super annoying. We did eat them all, but we think these fries are a total fail. Next time I'll ask if we can switch the side cause I wouldn't want to deal with them again.Overall, it was a really yummy dinner and we didn't really have to wait to be seated. My advice to people looking to go, is arrive early and be patient. Sit at the bar and chat w/ the bartender! Everyone waits for a table, so expect at least 60 minutes at a minimum. If you have that expectation you're not going to be pissed off when you find this out in person. Also, it isn't a huge spot, so come with a smaller group for a better chance to grab a table.

I also saw the few comments that mentioned the food was salty which I chose to overlook The staff was nice and the place has character but the booths were dirty and my seat was sticky. We ordered the burger and a side of broccoli rabe to share. We were planning getting dessert here and wanted to make sure we had room for it. I don't mind ""stinky"" strong cheeses but the cheese on the burger overwhelmed my senses that I couldn't taste the meat of my burger. Both my friend and I scraped off the cheese. Even after getting rid of most of the cheese, the saltiness of the cheese still dominated every bite. The broccoli rabe didn't help mitigate the saltiness. The veggie was also loaded with salt. If I rinsed my broccoli rabe my soaking it into my glass of water, there would still be a sufficient amount of salt but probably just the right amount afterward. In the end, our sub par experience deterred us from ordering dessert here. We ended up waking a few blocks to Magnolia for dessert.

Basically all I could focus on was the dry grit in my mouth. The fries included with the burger were equally disappointing.  They were physically a chore to eat due to their cut(Though it was somewhat fun watching other patrons trying to eat them without looking goofy,) and they primarily tasted like Rosemary.  Where I find Rosemary an excellent complimentary herb, I don't want it to be the sole flavor I taste.

It is a small restaurant with small tables which adds to the ""we are all friends atmosphere."" The menu is small but delicious. My husband and I shared the stracciatella cheese appetizer, which is similar to burrata but pulled so it is more stringy. It came on toasts with fried mushrooms. It was amazing! There were not many vegetarian options beyond getting all sides on the menu so I settles on the ricotta gnudi. It was very good but VERY rich. I had a really hard time finishing it all. In fact I couldn't. My husband had to help me. He was not upset about that at all. My husband got the famous Spotted Pig burger and LOVED IT. I tried some of his shoe string fries and they were great; crispy, flavored with salt and rosemary and fried onions as well. Delicious! We didn't try any desserts.The food is good, but expensive.

Luckily there was only a half hour wait (walked to Big Gay for ice cream in the meantime, ohhh yeah) and were seated in the lower level. I loved the decor of this restaurant. Somehow it's filled to the brim with an eclectic hodge podge of pictures and knick knacks without feeling too stuffy or crowded. It's a very cozy corner location.We sat near the kitchen whereupon I witnessed what seemed like thousands of the Roquefort burgers being churned out one after the other. Of course we also ordered the burgers and then waited for a looong time. The service was poor. During the entire stay we had four different servers and everything took an unusually long time. Drinks took over a half hour, dinner over an hour, and then we sat for another 45 minutes waiting for the bill. The food itself was underwhelming. The best part was the fries, but like mentioned previously, they're so hard to eat! The flavor is there, especially with roasted bits of garlic throughout (be sure you like rosemary if you order these though), but the stack of shoestring fries was impossible to eat. You really have to have the pinch, head tilt, and drop into the mouth technique perfected. It was pretty annoying. I REALLY wanted to love the burger. I ordered mine medium-well and it came out practically rare. The place was so dark, which in and of itself I don't mind, but I couldn't even see exactly how rare it was until I brought half of it home. The Roquefort cheese was okay, but there was too much of it. It just wasn't a good balance and while the burger does come with a sauce on the side, it just needs more. Something to balance the salt and add texture. For all the hype this place generates, and for the price, it was a significant letdown.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"
244,htP0OJcySxNex2YOurTh9g,Richard L.,4.0 star rating,My friends and i showed up after they lost a bet to pay for my food.  So we decided on The Spotted Pig for brunch since we've heard great reviews.So for brunch the brunch drinks (while a bit expensive) were really good.  I had the bourbon ice tea and that was awesome!  Cynthia had the all important brunch Bloody Mary and she said it was very good but at $15 a pop it was on the pretty high side of things.So for brunch i had the sizzling sisig with jalapenos and egg - and this was pretty fantastic.  Sisig is a philipino dish of pork jowel (a fatty pork cheek) cooked somehow with all this amazing flavor! Since that's the only thing i had that's all i can comment on.  next time i'll be back for April Bloomfield's burger.  It's something i've heard way too much about.,The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I never understand when a restaurant says ""no,"" particularly when its about something simple. That just defeats the purpose of eating out in my opinion. So they sat us elsewhere. When another table opened up that looked more convenient for us, we asked to be seated there, but then the waiters started making rumblings with each other so I just said to forget it if they were going to make a big stink about it. Also, they don't carry mayo or anything similar, which is beyond my understanding. It must be me though. The burger was pretty good but overpriced. The waiter was a bit snooty.

Apparently he's been raving about it and telling folks to meet him there for a burger. Now, I've only been here once but I believe it is the start of something really special. There's a lot of buzz around this place so I know it can get crowded. However, we came on a Friday around 3pm (just past the lunch crowd and before the dinner rush) and we got a table with no problem. It was late March but i it was a blizzard outside so coming into that particular space was very welcome. It's so so very cozy in there. In New York cozy sometimes means small but I mean it in the traditional sense: ""giving a feeling of comfort, warmth, and relaxation."" We sat upstairs in a booth type thing and watched the snow fall outside. Lovely! The inside is quaint little mishmash of an English cottage, lots of tiny stools, lots of My fiance and I were pretty hungry so we ordered a couple of appetizers and a burger each off the lunch menu. In retrospect we probably could have split a burger (HUGE portion) and been totally fine but c'est la vie. To start we had the deviled eggs and the roasted almonds. I thought the almonds might be a little boring but they were fantastic. They had a bit of a kick but nothing this weakling couldn't handle. The deviled eggs were also good but not all that memorable in the long run. But the burger? Yeah, that burger. We both ordered it as recommended (medium rare) and it was delicious. So huge and a bit hard to eat but power through, friends. You've earned it. Topped with roquefort cheese it's got just the right amount of funky tang to it and the shoestring fry mountain served with it is awesome. Now, I love a shoestring fry so these really got my motor running. Loved the rosemary thrown in and those bits of crunchy fried garlic were a real humdinger! So yes, Kanye.

I remember the place to be very crowded when I used to live in the city (maybe 2 years ago) but found it to be much more quiet and calm during my last visit.

I know some people believe the Spotted Pig is past its prime, however they still make one of the greatest Whiskey Sour in NYC, and personally I still love this venue.

It's one of those places that I know regardless of its review (which was 3.5 when I looked it up last week) will still have at least a 1 hour wait for brunch on the weekends and some people will mindlessly love it just because.I didn't know any better at the time, and perhaps I have not been disappointed like this in a while, so I have forgotten, but I really wish I had done a bit more research before ordering blindly here expecting everything to be wonderful. I can be an optimist like that sometimes.Let's start with the good. Out of the 4 things that my friend and I ordered, only the liver toast really stood out. Fresh, chunky pieces of liver, seasoned well, on top of a crusty piece of toasted bread with fragrant, crisp parsley on top? Yes, please. This alone would probably have skyrocketed this review to 5 stars for me.Unfortunately, we were pretty hungry after waiting about 45 minutes (I have to admit, this is a short wait for a Saturday, and they text you when your table is ready so you can go for a nice walk, and the hostess was so warm and nice that when I first walked in I thought maybe I was in California, and not New York City. So not all is lost but this review is really for the food) so we decided to also share the Burger with the shoestring fries and the poached eggs over the pork cheek hash. It is with great sadness that I report that neither of those dishes knocked my socks off. The burger was under seasoned and depended way too much on its thin layer of roquefort for flavor. The shoestring fries, although cute in concept, were tedious to eat, requiring all hands ( literally ) on deck. Each time I tried to dunk them in ketchup, they would break off and drown, leaving me to save it with my fork. What's the point?The pork cheek hash, which was my choice, was so unflavorful, so unremarkable in its combination of textures, that I actually felt a bit embarrassed to bring it up to my friend, hoping she wouldn't notice.

The burgers were absolutely delicious, but my favorite were the lobster rolls. It was not too heavy on the mayonnaise, and with cucumbers and dill provided just the right amount of refreshing to an otherwise heavy-ish dish. I wasn't a huge fan of the scallops, which didn't taste like scallops in the first place. However, the quality was still there so it's more of a personal preference.

The evening even started on an auspicious note when we found a parking spot right in front of the restaurant. We had an hour plus wait, but it wasn't a big deal because we just went around the corner to have some drinks at the venerable White Horse Tavern. We ended up being sat upstairs in a cramped corner, which is fine, it's NYC, but we were right under the radiator and it was uncomfortably warm. For a place with the word ""pig"" in the title, they offered very few items with it on the menu. We ended up getting the market salad, the bass, and a pork belly special. (We had decided not to order the burger because, c'mon, we live in Texas.)The salad ended up being the best dish of the night: super fresh with a great variety of greens, a bright dressing, an ample amount of cheese, and the ideal amount of pomegranates not to make it too sweet. Perfection. The bass was not well-salted, but when we got some salt on it, was somewhat better. The pork belly was the biggest disappointment of the night, which was not soft enough and had little to no flavor. Its side of polenta had some bizarre reduced tomato situation on it that tasted like tomato paste. It was shockingly bad. For dessert, we had the ""bananofee."" It was just OK. Drinks were fine: we enjoyed the spotted pig bitter and the mulled wine, but the stupidly named ""sexy animal"" wasn't that great. Service left a lot to be desired. Our waiter was attentive when he was present, but he was also missing for large swathes of the evening (i.e. It took over 20 minutes for someone to clear our dinner plates).

They don't take reservations so be ready for a certain wait depending on when you get there. Our meal consisted of the favorites that everyone else raves about: deviled eggs, sheep's milk gnudi, chicken liver toast, and the famous burger. Deviled Eggs: simply incredible. You get 2 for 4$ and definitely the best deviled eggs I've had. Beautifully creamy without the overwhelming taste of mayonaise that most deviled eggs come with. Sheep's Milk Gnudi: this is basically gnocchi filled with ricotta instead of potato. Usually a 20$ entree but got a plate to share. You get 7 gnudis on the dish and each one is amazing. Amazingly creamy with a great herb flavor from the sage. The sauce is so good you'll want to lick the bowl after you finish the gnudi! Not filling enough for one entree, but great as a sharing dish. Chicken Liver Toast: you get 2 pieces of toast for 10$. The toast is very sturdy with the chicken liver paste smeared all over it. I'm not a huge fan of organ meat but this dish was unlike most liver dishes I've had. The toast was a great contrast to the smooth chicken liver which had a great sweet aftertaste from the caramelized onions. Burger: 25$ for a chargrilled burger with Roquefort cheese. Very simple but a word of caution: you may not like this if you don't enjoy stinky/ pungent cheeses like Gorgonzola. I enjoyed the burger but felt like the cheese was somewhat overwhelming at times. The fries are good but there's literally a ton of them; they're Shoe string fries so they're incredibly thin and somewhat redundant on the plate. I also got my burger medium rare and felt like it was a little more on the rare side than I would've liked. All in all, a great experience. Definitely pricey but the food is worth it.

It got better: the pork rillette with mustard and toast met with approval, but the smoked fish chowder with pancetta and homemade crackers was the show stopper: it was really really good.

We got there just after the doors opened - maybe the fourth or fifth party to be seated. Got seated right away, then the waiter tells us there's no gnudi all day. Sucks, but okay. Waiter takes our order - tea, pancakes, and french toast. Five minutes later he comes back because he stopped to chat with the bar tender (we could see him) and he forgot the order. We tell him again. Ten minutes pass. Twenty. Twenty-five. He comes back to apologize but says he can't find any teapots. (Again, the restaurant had just opened, so they all should have been ready to go.) At the thirty minute mark, he brings a teapot without a lid because he couldn't find one, but forgot the milk to go with it. At the forty minute mark, our stomachs are seriously rumbling (and there's still only one other group in our section, so it's not like the kitchen was slammed.) The waiter hasn't even stopped in our area in the last 15 minutes, let alone come to apologize for the wait or explain what's taking so long. 45 minutes in and we finally manage to flag him to ask if the food is EVER going to come out. Finally, nearly an hour after order, our food arrives (and fyi, the pancake option is literally one single pancake. It's more than enough, it was just a surprise.)The food was fantastic--probably the best pancake I've had in the city--but it wasn't good enough to make up for the service. My friend and I have both worked in restaurants, too, so we know what it's like. If the kitchen screws up, fine. But not even bothering to check in, try to explain what was happening or apologize? Seriously? And the kitchen's couldn't have been slammed--again, we were probably the fifth party there. How badly is your kitchen run that it can't handle five tables? My friend thinks it's more likely that the waiter just forgot to put in the order, but I don't know.

The waitstaff are man-bunned angels. I really enjoyed my late night meal here.The Food/Drinks --Mulled wine: This is the best mulled wine I've ever had, no hyberbole. The spice gave it a solid kick without overpowering and the wine itself was fruity without being too dessert-like. This is a MUST try!Devils on Horseback: bacon wrapped dates that were the perfect blend of sweet and savory. The bacon was melt in your mouth good and was complemented by the sweetness of the dates. The balsamic reduction (I think that's what it was) tied it all together very nicely and interestingly. Definitely a dish worth trying.The Burger: Now I've read some other reviews on here and have gathered that the burger is a polarizing experience. I'm in the ""I found the holy grail"" camp of tasters. This was an impeccably prepared burger. I'm known to be something of a burger snob and I was speechless after this. The meat, like the bacon in the dish above, just melted in your mouth, bursting with flavor. It was so simple and beautiful with the blue cheese and soft grilled bun. I almost didn't want to use their housemade condiments but I was glad I did. They're different and certainly with checking out. The shoestring fries with garlic and rosemary that came with it were a triumph all on their own. They go amazingly with the housemade ketchup. This is a definite MUST TRY!The Service --I was very impressed with our server. The owner had a personal friend coming in with a party of 20 going straight to our spot. He was very respectful, polite, and friendly with us. He was so nice and communicative that I almost wanted to help him set up for the big party too. When we ordered food later than we said we'd be there, he said ""no problem, we'll make sure you get it"". This was great service.

288,uFdkUQKqT60USnDmAuwLEg,Tory K.,1.0 star rating,"The Spotted Pig was my favorite brunch spot in the city until it completely shattered all my love for this joint yesterday. I absolutely hate it when a restaurant I love becomes an overpriced sub-par place, and it sucks even more because I hosted personal events here many times in the past. FOOD: The go-to dish here for brunch is the burger with the shoestring fries, but the unique brunch dish that I absolutely fell in love with since the first time I came here is their pork sisig. However, their sisig, compared to 1-2 years ago, has completely deteriorated in its quality and my dish yesterday came with quarter of the skillet full of oil. The burger also became mediocre, and now makes it feel and taste very overpriced. Their shoestring fries are still good, but we've ordered a few batches and the texture wasn't as consistent. Overall, the food here was easily one of the worst brunch meals I've had in the past 3 months.SERVICE: My party arrived when there was no wait, but we ended up waiting for about an hour. Their exact words when we came in were ""We have a table that is leaving, we can get you seated in about 10 minutes."" This became an hour, and about 7-8 tables that came after us got seated first. I feel like the restaurant could have managed the situation better by putting some tables together (done in the past from my previous experiences at this place), but they were fixated on putting us in a specific spot. To make matters worse, our food came out SO LATE, and one of our side dishes came out when we were almost done with our main. I'd expect a restaurant to pay extra attention and care to a party that unnecessarily waited for an hour (hosts and servers kept apologizing as we were getting seated), but their service was sub-par. We weren't a large party, and the restaurant seem incapable of resolving issues at hand. Overall, I'm really saddened about my experience here. This used to be one of my favorite joints in the city, but the quality of the food and service that I've experienced was way too damaging for me to go back here any time soon.

I've been meaning to go to Spotted Pig since I moved to New York 5 years ago and still had yet to find the right time. We thought July 4th might be the time to try the famous British gastropub given how many people vacate the city but we were still quoted a 90-minute wait. No biggie, we were prepared for that and headed to the Otherroom for drinks. Unfortunately we had just opened a bottle of wine when - 20 minutes after we put our name down - I received a text that our table was ready. Luckily our bartender friend was happy to hold the bottle for us, and we headed back, but the disconnect between the predicted and actual wait times was a little annoying. We split a few things to start - the deviled eggs and the gnudi - and both were delicious (and I don't even like deviled eggs). The gnudi were served in some type of rich buttery sauce and my only regret is that we didn't have any bread to wipe the bowl clean. Then, obviously, we each ordered the famous burger. I requested it medium rare, but I think my dinner date's request of ""how the chef prefers it"" was the better way to go (medium). It's a LOT of beef, so much that even though the Roquefort serving was pretty generous, it was somewhat overpowered by the meat. I'm not a huge shoestring fry person but they were pretty good too - note that they do not serve mayonnaise at all, it's strictly a ketchup and mustard place. I also had a bloody mary (weird time of day but I was craving one) and that hit the spot. I probably will not be back - the burger was not really worth a return visit - but i can't wait to hit up Salvation Burger and White Gold, April Bloomfield's newest spots, for some more excellent meat and potatoes.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I split the Burger and the gnudi.  The burger presentation is on point with the black charred marked.  I thought the Roquefort was a bit much, but I am also not a huge fan of it, so a little goes a long way for me.  The accompanying fries were crispy and had rosemary and random fried garlic chips hidden inside- YUM! The gnudi was rich so I would recommend splitting the dish, but I thought it was delicious with the butter and sage. I got a glass of wine- Beaujolais ($15).

It was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious. The skate was good, except I didn't realize it came with the bones in it, which was annoying to pick out. And when I say there were bones there were a LOT of bones. The sauce was also pretty good. Ah, the burger. I don't understand why it is so famous. Granted we did get the cheese on the side but it is a very, very smelly cheese. I put a little bit on and I could taste it in my mouth all night. Without the cheese, it was a very plain burger.

The gastropub movement has gained so much momentum that you can find tastier, more thoughtful menus at newer gastropubs that are looking to develop the genre instead of serving the same old same old. That said, I do have enormous respect for those restaurants that have the same unchanging small menu that they execute flawlessly time after time. This, however, was plain boring. We arrived during their busiest time and waited at the bar for a table. Fine by me. Saw some dishes come out of the kitchen, including the enormous burger other reviewers wrote about. Honestly looked pretty boring to me. When we finally sat down, our waiter was rude and impatient. None of the entrees looked particularly intriguing so we opted to order a bunch of bar snacks and plates instead. We usually order as we go when we go out to eat, which has never been a problem in the Bay Area (where we live), but our waiter informed us that we needed to order all at once. What? Seems to be an NYC thing. There were empty tables as we got halfway through our meal so they didn't appear to need the table sooner. Whatever.The deviled eggs were incredible. Wish we had gotten a double order. We also ordered oysters (with a lifeless mignonette), the apple and cheddar salad (mildly interesting but not revolutionary), the ricotta gnudi (incredibly, incredibly rich and delicious), the mackerel (sounded interesting but was a strange dish), and a side of fries (is that much rosemary necessary?). Really nothing spectacular. Especially not for such a long wait, huge hype, and expensive bill. To top it off, the service was atrocious. Our waiter didn't come back to our table after taking our order, but continually checked on the tables next to us. In a tiny restaurant, it's easy to tell when your waiter is paying more attention to the old white guys in suits. We couldn't even order more beer because our waiter so intently avoided us, even when we tried to flag him down. His loss -- the bill was smaller and accordingly so was his tip. In sum, the food isn't bad, but it isn't going to be the showstopper you expect it to be. I imagine it's really only visited by tourists at this point. Go find something more exciting out there.

The flavor was ultimately very mellow. It's a great precursor to the main event.Chargrilled Burger -- A crowd favorite. Heck, Google their famous burger and see pages and pages of sites describing their infatuation and even recipes in hopes to replicate the item at home.The patty was remarkably thick, easily one of the thickest burger patties I've ever had. The bun was heavy and firm, somewhat crunchy around the edges. The one ingredient that completely changed the burger was the Roquefort Cheese. It's a sheep milk blue cheese which altered the taste of the burger. I, for one, am not a fan of blue cheese. It makes me think that the cheese is far past the level of expired and, in the end, makes me feel ill. All I could taste was the cheese. It really took away from the flavor of the meat.

311,XOZaHpEkJJ4THWVqZITksw,Lindsay H.,2.0 star rating,"Wow. And I mean that in the worst way.I literally left the restaurant tonight and went home to double check that they actually had a Michelin star, because it was that bad. I figured I had made a mistake.My husband and I showed up around 4pm, knowing dinner didn't start until 5:30 (fine with us!!) -- we wanted to have a few cocktails before dinner.  We each had three fantastic cocktails, and the bartender was wonderful.  She, alone, is the reason for the two stars.  Drinks were nice and complex and not overly sweet.We were seated for dinner about ten minutes after the seating started.  We ordered four dishes to split -- the ricotta gnudi (a menu standard) and three of the four off menu specials for the night (a squid dish, a skate dish, and a pork cheek dish). We also ordered a bottle of wine.About ten minutes after ordering (maybe 6pm), the ricotta gnudi came out. It would've been delicious but was heavily over salted.  We are not the type to send dishes back, but we should've. It was sooo over seasoned.  The underlying components were nice, though.About ten minutes after that, the skate came out. Really moist and tasty -- but, again, super salty.  The skate itself was over salted and then was also covered in capers, adding even more salt.  The greens were yummy, though.Then, not even five minutes later, the squid came out.  Not sure why -- it was obvious we were sharing everything and we can only eat one dish at once!!  But more importantly, there literally wasn't room on the table for it. Their two-top tables are TINY. They took away our water from us (to make room for the food) and had to put our wine on the floor to fit the two dishes on the table at the same time (our wine, by the way, came reaaaally close to getting knocked over by people sitting at the table next to us, who were so close they may as well have been sitting with us).Then, not two minutes later, our pork cheeks came out. The poor back waiter who brought it out looked mortified when he realized there was nowhere on our table to put it. Clearly, whoever was expediting and/or running the pass in the back was way over his or her head.  They should've known their two-tops can't accommodate three plates at a time.  They had to take it back because there was just no way to put it on the table (though, boy did they try to figure out where they could stick it) given we were still eating the squid and skate.It took us about twenty minutes to finish our squid and skate. At that point, they prepped our pork cheeks. To their credit, they definitely didn't try to serve us the same plate that had been prepped thirty minutes prior and sent back to the kitchen -- it took a reasonable amount of time to come out. And it was, to be fair, delicious.  Actually, so was the squid.  But the skate and gnudi were just toooo salty; honestly, it felt like the head chef (by which I don't mean April, I mean whoever she leaves to run the restaurant in her stead, as I assume she isn't generally there) didn't get there until about 30 or 40 minutes after dinner service started, and so he or she was checking the seasoning on our last two dishes, but that someone less experienced was handling our first two (which came out before then).All in all, the bartending staff and all the front of house staff was fine. But the kitchen was frankly in the gutter tonight.  The poor guys sitting next to us waited forever for their food, which was disturbingly comical given that ours felt like it was being shoved down our throats to turn the table over as fast as possible.I didn't go here expecting fine dining. I just wanted good food.  But that didn't happen.  At least the drinks were good.Assuming our experience was typical (and not an unfortunate fluke), I doubt they'll keep their star for long.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

315,TWxdVIudrC5CnrGnO8k1JA,Sally L.,2.0 star rating,"Came here on a quest to find a burger in NYC that beats shake shack. According to the reviews, this burger is HEAVELY. I don't mind waiting for good food... so we put down our number and went to another bar for 90 minutes until our table was ready.The Spotted Pig is TINY. It's super difficult getting in and out of the tables and you're up close and personal to your dining neighbors/can hear all their life problems/whatever intimate conversation they're having and think you can't hear. If you have to go to the bathroom and you're sitting on the inside, be prepared to inconvenience everyone and move out slowwwlyy. Anyway, all this would be fine if the burger was amazing, but it was not. We got the skirt steak and the famous burger with shoestring fries to share. There was a 40 minute wait for the burger.. but no worries, we already waited 90 mins. The skirt steak came out first and it was actually cooked very tenderly and flavorful. It came with some sort of butter/cream cheese and I happily cleaned up the plate. After another 20 minutes.. the burger came out and as I feared... I was pretty disappointed. First of all, I don't like blue cheese and there was some kind of blue cheese spread which I wasn't a fan of (and scraped it off). The shoestring fries were annoying to eat but it was not awful. I made sure my last bite was the skirt steak and not the mediocre, unimpressive burger. We got the creme caramel (basically flan.. why didn't they just call it flan) for dessert. This was pretty good, but almost like any other flan I've had. Hard to mess it up.Oh, idk if it was just the day I was there but I think the bathroom is literally a sauna. If you plan on taking #2, then make sure you bring a towel in there cause you'll have to wipe up sweat afterwards. You could barely MOVE. Not a fan at all.Why was the burger so overrated?? I know this is NYC, but why was everything so squished together?? I think you can probably get rid of a table or two and make the bathroom a little bit bigger. I'm really not overweight but JESUS, please do something to accommodate other people..Wait.. how does this place have 1 Michelin Star??!?!?!?Best burger in NYC?

The Thai broth didn't make me want to soak up with a bread. How mussels could be tasteless. I guess no seafood on Monday applies here. I want to believe it was their worst day but I felt bad for my friends from Tokyo to treat me for this lunch.The famous burger - perfectly cooked, medium. It was good but not that special especially for the price. It was good as Umami Burger except the price, $21 vs $15.5 (Classic $12 + fries $3.5) and you get your choice of fries. To my surprise, I did enjoyed the string fries with rosemary.Cuban sandwich ($19)-I read a good review but what we got was just okay, nothing very special. Tasty Prosciutto de Parma and the aged gruyere didn't help this gamey pork that was in the sandwich. Usually acidity from piickles help  a bit but not this one. Crème Caramel ($9)- everything we had, so far, were below 4.5 start so we didn't expect much from the dessert but it was excellent. We all loved this gelatinous Spanish-like firmed custard pudding with a light caramel sauce.We did not understand why we needed to wait for a table even the place wasn't packed for early Monday lunch. We waited outside for good 30 minutes but no one check us but we noticed may customers were showing up. I found that waiting outside was not a good idea because people after us got their table before us. I checked the name list that was left unattended and the name after us were erased. I suggest do not wait for your table outside.Big group of French tourists next to our table were waiting for their food and they were very chatty, high energy and being very French.

We were told the wait would be over an hour for a table, so we decided to sit at the bar and order food. Not even 30 minutes later, a table opened up so we were able to sit. Unfortunately it was a slow day in the kitchen, and us and tables around us were waiting over an hour. The wait staff felt bad for the inconvenience, and offered to give out free drinks until our food arrived, and even provided some bar snacks.When the burgers came, I soon realized it was WELL worth the wait, and one of the best burgers I have ever bit into. It was perfectly cooked (medium rare), and the bleu cheese (although uncommon for a burger) gave it such an interesting flavor. The shoestring fries were piping hot and also increadible. I finished every morsel of food on my plate. So delicious.Despite the long wait (it was an off day), the service was excellent and burger even better.

Came here while a bit hungry after watching a 2+ hour movie.  BAD idea to come even if you're a bit hungry, you will be hangry from waiting and leave disappointed.  Waited close to 45 minutes for just 2 simple dishes (pork cheeks with fried egg and cubano sandwich with small arugula side salad) and they weren't good enough to be worth the wait!  Come on, the place is called ""The Spotted Pig"" and naturally you would think their best dishes would be pork.  The sandwich was trash (only half was eaten), definitely not worth anyone's $24 even if you're filthy rich!  While waiting for the food no one came by our table to check in and let us know how much longer it will take (many restaurants do this when waiting long).  I had to frantically wave my arm like a crazy person to flag down a waiter to ask where are they with the order, but before I could even finish my sentence he cut me off and said ""It's coming"" in the worse attitude EVER.  You would think a restaurant that has been around for 10+ years and awarded so many accolades should have perfected some kind of system between the dining room and kitchen to provide impeccable service.  Guess not.  What's up with the waiters/waitresses adorned with tattoos having the nerve to walk around being all pretentious??  I guess they don't care about the service or food quality anymore.  Service to get food is slow AF but they came to collect our plates literally 10-15 min after we got them.  We didn't clean our plates since the food wasn't that great.  I can honestly say the food and service is not as good as it once was.  It's now just a tourist trap with crazy overpriced mediocre/bad food.  There are plenty of other places that can make better food for a lower price with much better service for its patrons.  Sadly this place has lost its touch and I will no longer be coming back.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

My mouth waters just thinking of their masterpiece of a burger...Wife and I were touring around NYC on a trip last June, and ended an afternoon saunter down the High Line with a stroll through East Village to the Spotted Pig (so we're tourists... there I said it).For some reason I assumed it would look like the same blaise, faux-rural, exposed lightbulbs, reclaimed wood bullshit that everyone and their brother (or is it mother?) are opening up these days. However, I was charmed by the homey look and feel of the place; we thought it looked like an English grandmother's garden shed and loved everything about it. Sat at the bar with a few drinks taking in the decor and chatting with our bar neighbors. Then the burgers came and my life changed.The burger patty itself was wonderfully juicy, cooked perfectly and overall was just top notch. Like some other posters, bleu cheese isn't really my thing, but it's easily scraped off. I ate about half with, half without it and enjoyed both equally. I advise eating it in small bites to really savor it. The fries also surprised me and I loved how garlicky they were.In short, despite of the huge number of great dining options for visitors to explore in NYC, whenever we're in town again we'll be back to the Spotted Pig for round two.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I had a group of around 8 clients looking for a late-night snack. It was an immediately frustrating experience because we went upstairs to the bar, but then I had to go back downstairs to get seated at a table. The worst moment though was how rude the waitress was. Right as we were first seated, I was trying to be nice, and make sure my clients were well-taken care of. When I asked the African-American waitress her name (she had long dreadlocks & glasses), she rudely and sarcastically replied ""I'd rather not."" After that snide comment, she was impatient with everyone as they placed their orders and didn't even pretend to be nice. I was aghast by this happening to some of important clients. I was clearly going to be spending a lot of money on dinner, and she didn't seem to care at all. #onlyinnycI hope the restaurant reconsiders her employment; it was one of the worst customer experiences I've had in my 8 years as a NYC resident.

Justine, the hostess, came up and told us there was a spot open at the bar and if we acted fast we would be able to grab it! We absolutely loved her for that. Theresa was our server and she was absolutely amazing. My girlfriend and I ordered two specials, Pumpkin soup with farro, pancetta, and sage; and the Romesco cauliflower. Both came out hot and delicious. They were swamped and super busy so it did take some time for our food to come out but it was worth the wait and when Theresa was able to stop by she was very attentive, present, and friendly. We also had the hanger steak entree which my girlfriend is now obsessed with. It was cooked perfectly and the mushrooms were amazing. ""Literally the best thing I've ever put in my mouth.""

We tried to get in on a Friday night and the wait was literally 4 hours, so we tried again the next night (and started earlier). We were able to get a table pretty quickly, even though it was super duper crowded and literally directly next to the bathroom door. I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of the incredibly dimly lit restaurant scene mostly because a) I'm one of those people who likes to photograph their food and I could get zero pictures here and b) I could not see my friends at all. Also people kept whacking me in the head with their bags because the space was so limited upstairs, I'm not sure about the downstairs area. We also had a super weird server/waiter experience, where we were both served by about 4 different people and the guy who took our order, the woman who came to check on how our food was doing, and the three different people who bussed our table did not seem at all interested in refilling our water or getting us another round of drinks. Our first waiter seemingly disappeared but maybe just switched tables? Because he was still there waiting on other tables, but then a different waiter came to ours. It was super super confusing and for a restaurant this famous I was expecting a bit more.I had the chicken liver toast (which was not brought out to me initially until after people had finished their entrees, I then asked for it twice from two different waiters because we had no idea who ours was anymore, and it was brought out after the main course--not cool). This was truly delicious and I never thought I would be a chicken liver person, but I am if it always tastes like this! I of course also had the gnudi, which this place is known for, and 100% lives up to the hype. At first I looked at it and thought the portion was a little small, but then diving into it I could barely finish it due to the richness. We also had the broccoli rabe and the polenta with nettle puree, the first was pretty basic but still delicious, and the polenta was such an interesting flavor--I had never had a nettle puree before and it was such a great addition to the polenta.3 stars for service (come on y'all, step it up a little...) and 5 stars for food.

I am a very patient woman. Sadly, no celebrity spotting at this evening but their delicious apps and entrees made up for any sorrow for not seeing Beyonce and Jay-Z. The ambience was fun and kitschy: pigs lining the top windows, pigs hanging from the ceilings, pig made out of twine outside the restaurant. Our friend loved the pig theme. For starters, we ordered the deviled egg (flavorful, fresh, serves 2), devils on horseback (dates, bacon and hint of spiciness), and chicken liver toast (amazingly moist due to liver mixed with olive oil, sprinkled with sea salt: delicious but not very photogenic). For entrees: sheep's milk ricotta gnudi with basil pesto (the buttery basil pesto was amazing!), their famous burger with Roquefort Cheese and shoestring fries. I must stop and say the burger is perfect if you split it with 3 other people. Its a great taste with the strong pungent cheese, medium rare juicy beef, very nice. If I were to eat the whole burger, I would not have the same review. And those fries! We could not get enough of them! They had slivers of garlic crisps and rosemary mixed with the fries. My new favorite fries! So aromatic! We just smelled fried rosemary and rosemary all night long. Loved it! (Also we were seated next to a rosemary plant). Last entree: Pig cheek sausage with fried pig ears. Loved the crispy salty fatty cartilage of the pig ears. The pigs cheek was perfectly done, falling apart into the rich savory salty sauce.

Both of us chose the chargrilled burger with Roquefort cheese and shoestring fries and a Bronx Brewery Summer Pale Ale.The burger (medium rare) was absolutely superb, the cheese giving it a tasty complexity. One of the best examples I'd had in my 10 days in NYC. The shoestring fries were a novelty, but damn hard to eat without you resembling a farm animal scoffing a load of straw.Service was a tad hit-and-miss - starting well but then our waitress disappeared when we were ready to pay and even waving a credit card at other staff members didn't illicit a response.

So many people got here before me. So first, we decided to grab some drinks at the bar. Since the places started to pack up, people were standing in the aisles (no where else to go) and one of the workers was clearly super aggravated about all the people. She was so rude and pushed her dish bucket into people and made a path to get to the kitchen...yes, just what people want on a Friday afternoon. She was snappy and just absolutely did not want to be there. This kind of pissed me off bc she knocked into me as well. The food: we got a few appetizers and of course, the famous burger. For appetizers we went with the gnudi, devils on horsebacks, and chicken liver toast. My group of three thought the appetizers were ok, but not as good as the hype. The saddest part comes next.. we were all soo excited for the burger so we each ordered our own and I purposely took my cousin (a burger aficionado) here... he, like the rest of us thought that it was okay. I was actually really surprised about how strong the roquefort cheese taste was..it overpowered the whole burger and all I could taste was the cheese! This was disappointing. The fries on the other hand, were absolutely to die for. SO good. Glad I got to try it but not sure if I would return.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

We ordered a Margi (7.5 out of 10) and the Don Vito (10 out of 10). For appetizers we ordered the deviled eggs (8 out of 10) and the devils on horseback (8 out of 10). My wife makes a mean deviled egg so we were anxious to compare the two. For entrees, we all went with the burger and fries. Three at the table got the cheese on the side after finding out that there were not any other cheese options (Roquefort isn't a family fav) for the burger. The burgers took all of 45m to get to us. In the meantime we ordered another round of drinks. The burgers were cooked to perfection. I had the medium rare and the balance of the table went with well-done. The fries, because they are the width of a shoestring, are a little challenging to eat. Also, we asked for a second portion of ketchup when the food arrived as I knew we would blow thru the 2 oz portion that came with each burger. We skipped dessert as its a big meal, even for those that skipped lunch and had snacks throughout the day.

It took awhile to get the food out. Review on food: the chargrilled burger with Roquefort cheese and shoestring fries.I believe that the cheese overpowered the burger and the bun was surprisingly tougher than I imagined. I do have to say that the star of the dish is actually the fries.

We finally were seated upstairs after an hour or so. Server was busy so service was a bit slow. We had drinks in hand and each ordered a different salad. The roasted carrot salad with avocado and orange was probably one of the best salads of my life. The roasted carrots were just perfect. Huge chunks of avocado and juicy oranges with the perfect amount of the vinaigrette, which was to die for. Fresh herbs made this simple salad a masterpiece. My friend's bibb lettuce salad was just ok. Mine was the star of the show. Just wow. Order it.We split the deviled eggs which were good, but had a weird celery-tasting liquid on it. Wasn't crazy about these. We split their famous burger and yes, it was completely worth $21. It was a huge burger with the perfect ratio of meat to bun. Roquefort on top of the juicy meat was just to die for. Seriously another amazing dish. Shoestring fries with fresh rosemary. OMG those fries.

Since Spotted Pig doesn't take reservations, we decided to come around 6pm before the normal dinner crowd, and we were seated right away. Host was kinda rude and dismissive, but we barely had to deal with him, so it didn't matter too much. We were placed in a circular booth, nearly sharing a table with another party, but it wasn't too terrible. I will say that I can definitely see it getting crowded here when busy.Felt kind of embarrassed to just order 3 burgers, but we did it anyways, as well as an order of the chicken liver toast. None of us really felt a burger was a dish that you could share. This is America, after all. The chicken liver spread was seasoned well and just the right consistency, and for $7, not bad. It was a good primer for the long-awaited burger. So I'm not sure if I just over-hyped it for myself, but the burger just did not meet my expectations. The roquefort was definitely way too overpowering, and the burger itself was a bit bland. The meat was cooked a perfect medium rare and the brioche bun was just the right texture, but flavor profiles were just a bit rough on the edges. I was a bit disappointed, but happily ate the burger anyway. Conversely, the fries had great flavor with the rosemary, garlic, and salt, but were more like potato sticks than actual fries, so you don't that substantial mouth-feel you get with thicker fries. Ha, substantial mouth-feel. Bet you hear that one all the time. In all, I can't say that it was worth the $21.Service was pretty attentive and friendly, and while  the food took longer than usual, the waitress was quite quick with water and beers. Beer selection is decent, although I'm usually not a big fan of $8 beers.Anyways, the experience itself was pretty good, and I can definitely see myself coming back to try the other dishes, which, from the reviews seem like they're pretty good.

The spotted pig biter was great with the legions of meat. The food was all incredible. Unlike other great restaurants, the entire menu was stand out, not just a single item. The chicken liver spread was amazing with a sweet note that went so well with wine. The devils on horseback, Bacon wrapped dates were also a great balance of sweat and salty. The gnudi were chewy and cheesy. The mussels with Thai Green Curry and cocunut milk were so good with a great tangy flavor. The pork cheek and liver dumplings were so good, no wonder they have pig paraphernalia everywhere. The cheeks were so crunchy and chewy but flavor packed. The dumplings were tender and succulent. The burger is also truly superb. The meat is so flavorful and tender and seasoned so well. The fries were also great with rosemary making them seem fairly light.

I thought this was pretty unfair not to give the place a chance and only base it on that, but my view changed.We arrived at Spotted Pig at about 715pm (so about prime time) and were told that it would be a 45min - 1hr wait. When we came back, they still weren't ready for us and told us that there were 3 more groups ahead of us. We decided to go upstairs to their bar but after seeing how packed it was, we just decided to wait outside. Also, when we walked around upstairs and peered into the dining area downstairs, we noticed MULTIPLE empty tables. Why? I'm not quite sure, but maybe the kitchen can't accommodate that many people since it is so tiny. So we waited and finally after nearly 2 hours of waiting we got our table. All the tables for 2 were super close to each other, but we lucked out and got a corner booth table! Most tables don't even have chairs, they have stools - not the most comfortable way to enjoy a nice dinner.This place was on our radar because we were told by friends that it had 1 Michelin star and that their burger is really good. So, we decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, we had to wait yet another 30-45min for our food to be prepared. It really is an entire evening ordeal. I asked for my burger to be medium and it was not cooked enough at all. My boyfriend asked for medium-rare and it was definitely on the more rare side.

We were seated immediately at the bar and then offered an upstairs table. Used to a long wait here since they don't take reservations, that was surprising and super nice, although we discovered that the bar/first floor was much cooler than upstairs with a broken air conditioner. Stuffy air, close quarters, sweaty bodies; this is how people must've felt back in the Revolutionary War days when this building was probably built.Four of us ordered the burgers and shoestring fries. I thought the burger was ok although I ordered a medium and received medium rare. I like medium rare beef, but not on a burger due to Mom warnings (she's always right). The food runner probably mixed up the plate placements since the four of our orders were flip-flopped. Maybe they should have those little ""Medium Rare"" sticks on them... The burger tasted a bit too salty, maybe because of the roquefort cheese and over-seasoning of the meat.Each order came with a huge mound of shoestring fries, and although everyone else finished theirs, I could barely get half in my mouth. To me they were way too salty.You probably won't spot me here too much in the future, unless out-of-town friends put this on their Must-Do list.

This is under rated at 3.5 stars on yelp, and well deserves the Michelin star that it carries. I love the atmosphere here, cosy without feeling overcrowded. The cocktails are fantastic, I have never been disappointed. Beer selection is great too, always a few cask selections on tap which I love for a change. The burger is my go-to, the meat mix is fantastic and the roquefort blue cheese is always such a treat. People that are giving this burger tepid reviews are likely confused about the cheese - I have spoken to people that are... The deviled egg appetizer is also phenomenal, we usually start with a few of them. Mussels were great, pig ear salad is always good. Combine it all with great service and this place is a no brainer. Helpful tip: We (party of 2) have never waited more than 10 minutes for a table. We last ate this past Monday night at 10pm. The trick is to put this on your list of restaurants when you are eating a little later than you normally would.

As for the burger...don't get me wrong, the patty was cooked to perfection just how we wanted (medium rare - which made me wonder, why did it take an hour to get our burgers when we asked for medium rare??), and the bun was also great, but the blue cheese was really not cool. There was definitely too much blue cheese to the point where it dominated the burger and left a repugnant taste in my mouth. My boyfriend kept looking at me, fully aware of my dislike for blue cheese, and was anxiously waiting for me to blow up. Fortunately, I didn't. I doused my burger in ketchup and mustard to mask the taste of the cheese, so it wasn't too bad.The shoestring fries were pretty good - crispy and flavorful, and that's about it.Do I think the burger was worth $21? Absolutely not.Will I ever return? Oh, hell no. Not if I have to wait an hour for a damn burger.Remember the waitress who took our orders in the beginning? Well, the only time she ever returned was to take the checkbook. It doesn't matter if your restaurant is extremely popular - your customers should always be your top priority. It should not take an hour for us to receive our orders, and our servers should not be checking in with us just to take our order and give us the bill.Maybe this would've been slightly justified if the place was super cheap. But it wasn't, so everything that happened is not okay.Yelpers, you let me down.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I chose the burger and fries, and so glad that I did. I'm a burger snob because I I love great meat and charbroiled backyard grill taste, and this burger more than met my taste. It is served on a brioche bun that also was grilled, and just perfect. The burger is accompanied by shoe string fries (actually even smaller) that were not too greasy and very tasty. I chose an Allagash wheat beer for my drink, but I will have to say that I felt the beer prices were quite hefty for beer that is pretty widely distributed throughout the Northeast ($10 for my small bottle).We were seated quickly, and I loved the team approach to service here. Every waiter in the restaurant was paying attention to our table, and we were never without water, drinks or food during our whole experience ... even at midnight.I only have one recommendation for improvement: The restaurant seems to take some weird pride in not serving mayonnaise, and only ketchup and dijon mustard. Dear owner or GM, get over it :)  Some of us like mayo with our burgers, and I personally don't like dijon. At a casual restaurant like this one, it's a policy that just makes no sense, and it's more of an irritation to your guests than a practice that any of us are impressed by.

I don't know what the wait time is on an average night here.. but you can't make a reservation. It was a Saturday night. We were quoted 2-hours for a table by the hostess. There is no reason to EVER wait 2-hours for a meal. So we wait for seats at the bar which still took about 45 minutes. People are HAWKS. And mind you the bar isn't exactly a pleasant experience. People behind you squeezing through and splishing around drinks. I was facing a wall. Whatever. Had planned to come with some friends and now we were here.. we were seated.. and we were gonna order.I ordered THE burger. It was good.. but it was just too much. I love cheeseburgers as much as the next gal... I need cheese on a burger (unless its Minetta Tavern) but this was overkill. It was like roquefort on top of roquefort on top of roquefort on top of an already oily burger. I have a stomach of STEEL and I felt sick the entire next day. If I was a fat man I'd probably have had a heart attack The place is known for their shoestring fries. And again they are good. But they're too skinny to pick up with fingers. And damned near impossible to pick up with a fork.. just ended up feeling like they were more work than they're worth.The sheeps milk ricotta gnudi... it was just also so rich. I maybe had 2 gnudi's and I was done. Everyone loves it.. because they taste delicious. But I can make anything taste delicious if it is straight saturated fat in butter sauce.Went upstairs afterwards to have another drink. Ended up leaning against this door to a staircase in the back that all of the waitstaff walk up & down from.

430,aacSlcZwmfNIv3c1YmrZ4Q,Raymart D.,3.0 star rating,"Oh, the Spotted Pig, I expected more but you did not deliver. I've heard about this place because of I April Bloomfield and only until my friend suggested we have dinner here that I decided to finally check it out. Lets start off with the food. We ordered the Devils on Horseback to share which were bacon wrapped prunes. Curse you bacon for making me order everything with you. I don't like prunes. They're weird and also associate them with old people (no offense to prune fans or the elderly). The prunes were too sweet and considering they were wrapped in bacon, completely overpowered the smoky fattiness of the pork. My friend and I both ordered the burger with shoestring fries. These fries were potato sticks and while they look all pretty on a plate as a bundle, it isn't practical if you want to dip in a sauce. Why April Bloomfield why? I like my fries thicker thank you very much. Also you have to sift through the rosemary pines once you get through most of the bundle. The burger while having gorgeous grill marks on the bun and cooked to the right temperature, the roquefort cheese was too strong of a flavor. The balance of flavor is off with the pungent blue cheese and the meat. It needed something else. Its a simple burger but unfortunately in this instance, simple isn't better. The fact that the burger and fries are $22 doesn't help its cause. I'll give The Spotted Pig points for decor with the cabin in the woods vibe with a mix of paintings, log wood, and warmth. Other than that, that's all I can recommend. Happy eating and remember: Don't deny, satisfy!",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

We were told that it was going to literally be a 2 hour wait for a table and this place does not take reservations. Assuming that it would be worth the wait we decided to go somewhere else down the block to  have some drinks and to try to snack on something in the meantime. It was literally a solid 1 1/2 hours later maybe more before we received a text that our table was ready. The service was  good and so were the drinks but at that point I was just anticipating the food. I decided to go with the cheeseburger which is popular here and the Sheep's milk ricotta gnudi with brown butter and crispy sage, sounds delicious right?! I thought that the cheeseburger was good but the gnudi was mediocre. Overall it was not worth the long wait. Service in the front is pretty unapologetic about how long the wait is. Its kind of  a ""like  it or not"" mentality. Which if your business is booming I guess you can do that but thats not cool at all.

I barely use/need any salt while cooking for my boyfriend and I. So, my point is, this food was SALTY for me. At least in what my boyfriend and I ordered. We watched all three seasons of The Mind of a Chef and we were excited to visit this place after watching 3rd season chef Amy Bloomfield. Super cool, down to earth Chef. She mentioned in one of the episodes that she wanted people to feel like they're at ""home"" when they visit The Spotted Pig. Super cozy building with cute little pigs and other knick-knacks placed in every nook and cranny. We enjoyed the ambiance.   We got to The Spotted Pig around 6:00PM on a Sunday night and it was packed. We waited for about 1 hr 45 mins at the bar upstairs (we found a corner to squeeze and stand into). The bartender, Alex, was very friendly and a cool cat! We really enjoyed chatting with him and he took very good care of us, while we were waiting for our table. WE ORDERED 3 DISHES WHILE WE WAITED:Chicken Liver Toast - very tasty. Salty, garlic liver spread.Deviled Egg - My boyfriend said it was one of the best he's ever had (I'm allergic to eggs :( , so unfortunately I didn't get to try it). Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi with Brown Butter & Sage - This was very tasty and savory. Again, a little on the salty side for me, but I enjoyed it with my beer!FOR DINNER: We had the Skate, which is the fin of the Skate Stingray (I don't see it on the websites menu?) with the Beets & Greens. The Beets & Greens were awesome. TONS of flavor. We really enjoyed the ""warm"" flavors that oozed from this dish. We never had Skate, so we had a go and tried it. It was interesting that the meat slid right off the cartilage/bone with little to no effort. The texture is softer (almost slippery?) than most fish, so keep that in mind. Overall the staff was very friendly and we enjoyed the homey, cozy feel of this restaurant. Even though the food was a bit on the salty side it did make me drink more beer, which I'm sure has something to do with their evil plan ;) haha!

We figured we would grab some drinks and wait inside, there were seats around ""the column"". There were some special beers listed on the board but I wanted some sort of a cocktail, so I asked to see a menu. So far so good. The people I was with decided to get something to drink, went up to the bar, came right back with drinks. I got my menu, decided what I wanted, went up to the bar said hi to the bartender while looking right at him, then he turned around and started talking to some of the people seated at the bar, OK,I'll wait until he's done, he can see me he's turned to my side, but then turns his back to me and talks to some other people. OK, they were there 1st maybe they asked for more drinks. no, he's not making anything. He rings up a tab, OK I get that too. But now I've been there about 10-15 min. Finally he turns towards me I ask for my drink, he makes it, a waiter comes up he makes a drink for him and then rings me up. I don't know why it took so long, it did seem as if I was being ignored, but hey I'll let it go I finally have my drink and it's good! We get seated, mind you the place is small and busy but it was comfortable, I didn't feel crowded, so that's a plus too.I probably should have looked at the menu before hand but didnt. So I am between 2 pork dishes. I ask the waiter, who was very friendly, great service which he would pick, he says they are both good but one of the dishes  is a cold dish so I go with the sizzling sisig. I really should have known what it was before I ordered it, and that's on me. There is a lot of gristly bits in it, it's the nature of the dish. Had I known I would have ordered something else, BUT it was very flavorful and the meaty bits were good, I just couldn't eat the gristle. But here's the kicker 1 of us is vegetarian, so she asks him for a recommendation, guess what he is a vegetarian too!! so how did he know both pork dishes were good???? I don't know, wish he would have told me. Anyway we got the deviled eggs, they were really really good. Someone had the burger, said it was good, I tried the potatos that came with it, they were ok, more like chips than fries. I guess my expectations were too high for what the whole experience was.

Of course they're known for their sensational burger and shoestring fries but everything else on the menu is just as amazing as well.

One thing that really stands out to me when I come here is that the staff don't remove plates from the table until everyone has finished with their meal - that is true etiquette and I don't see happening a lot in NYC restaurants! If you're coming here because you're in town make sure you try and arrive just before 7 or you will most likely be asked to wait for your table - there is a bar to drink at though.

Go figure! We had plans to go for sweets elsewhere so we skipped dessert. The bathrooms are tiny, very dark and UNISEX which was really odd. You can't wash your hands without rubbing elbows with the guy or girl next to you. That was interesting.All in all, this was a wonderful little spot that is full of character.

Set in sickeningly cute West Village, you say? Burgers for breakfast, you say? All true, all needing to be experienced in person.Being from San Francisco, we take our brunch pretty seriously. I had high expectations for this place, having heard about it from multiple sources, all with sweeping positives reviews. Get there a tad before open at 11:00am and you'll be guaranteed a table. Your whole party must be there or they won't seat you. Show up any later and you might be waiting 1-2 hours. I understand you New Yorkers don't like to wake up until noon on the weekend, but sacrifice an hour of sleep just this once - you'll be glad you did.Service was friendly and attentive. Our food took some time (understandably with the kitchen getting backlogged from the first seating), but still no longer than ~30 minutes. We sated ourselves with a few morning cocktails and deviled eggs, which were sweet, creamy, divine.Our party ordered the croque monsieur, the sizzling sisig, the dutch baby, and the two poached eggs with pig hash. They're obsessed with pigs at this establishment, and their passion shows through in their food.Croque Monsieur - a giant, buttery, delicious ham, egg, and cheese sando. Eat half, take the rest home - unless you dare have the butter sweats the rest of the day.Sizzling Sisig - described by the waitress as ""Pork Face"" with eggs, meaning everything from a pig's head in a cast iron skillet. It was delicious. She undersold it - I'd rather just eat the sausage and not know how it gets made. Dutch Baby - a cross between French Toast and a pancake. With maple bacon syrup. Nuff said.Pork Hash - This was fantastic. Eggs were runny inside, yolks a healthy bright orange. All oozing over a pile of sautéed vegetables, potatoes, and a mountain of pork. All together the bill came out to ~$50 per person, which for the appetizers, drinks, and large delicious portions in the West Village is perfectly tolerable.

456,exHYmPL9NvElHKG5YhgdWQ,Joyce C.,2.0 star rating,"I kept hearing about The Spotted Pig over the years and after seeing April Bloomfield in a Fall New York Magazine article about NY's top Chefs and recently on a Mind of a Chef, I finally made it there on a Friday night. Wait for a table of 3 at 6:30pm was still about 45 minutes. We had just gotten there at the start of service and waited near the bottom of the stairs (slightly out of the way, but still not since the Staff come up and down the stairs with platters and exit through the side door to probably get supplies?). FYI- there's very little waiting room except for a window counter, of if you're lucky, to get a seat at the Bar. To sum up The Spotted Pig, their main ingredient: SALT. Everything was SO salty! Yes food needs to be seasoned, but even just after having the Deviled Eggs (interesting appetizer, freshly made with a kick of spice. One is just enough to fill you up), it's crunchy salt in the yolk dehydrated us instantly. Friend and I split the Burger and Shoestring Fries and the Ricotta Gnudi in sage brown butter sauce. The burger was Huge, and definitely recommend getting it medium or more rare. We got it medium-well and it was a little by dry and too much rich meat to handle. Although very fresh. The fries were awesome, but yes, there it is again: SALT. The little fried bits of rosemary (THAT was why we kept smelling whiffs of delicious rosemary!) was a nice touch, but we couldn't finish it due to all that sodium. The Gnudi was definitely a standout and highly recommended. If I'm going to to make the effort and spend hard-earned money eating out, it'd be great if it was something that I don't know how to make, or something that I've never had before. Their Gnudi process is apparently specific to The Spotted Pig, the chef uses goat's milk and lets the gnudi rest in semolina flour for a few days, forming a crust around each ball. Each piece was a soft little pillow of deliciousness, wrapped in a thin little pasta. The sage and brown butter was the perfect compliment. This dish is a little heavy to eat as an entree (for about 6-8 pieces), I would recommend it to share. Also recommend eating it before it cools off, as it doesn't keep the same consistency. We split a Banoffe pie and it was just alright. It tasted super fresh and like it was just made. But that pretty much describes it: just made layers of dulce de leche, sliced bananas, whipped cream, and espresso dust. It seemed to need more time for the flavors to meld- or maybe that's how it's supposed to taste?For 2 burgers & fries, 1 Gnudi special, 2 deviled eggs apps, 1 banoffe, 1 hard cider, it came out to about $160 (including tax and tip). Not sure if I would go back, due to their long wait times and cost of the meal. If I do, I'd definitely try to sit upstairs, the downstairs is fairly cramped. Downstairs definitely feels like a pub, the upstairs feels like brunch. The service was okay, although the hosts a the front kept changing their posts, but didn't seem like servers?

The interior of the restaurant is very cute with an apparent British pub influence. Heard this is one of Kanye West's favorite restaurants to go to in NY so my expectations were high (obviously cause Kanye is Kanye). Also this restaurant has a Michelin star, so I was looking forward to the taste and quality of the meal.  First things first, the service was great. The servers were attentive, friendly, and well informed about the ingredients and what exactly they were giving their customers. We started with the CHICKEN LIVER and the DEVILED EGGS. The Chicken Liver was tasty and a bit sweeter than I was expecting, but delicious nonetheless. But, the Deviled Eggs was the dish that stole the show today. I would come back just for the Deviled Eggs...probably the best I've ever had. Great combination of mustard, mayo, cayenne pepper, lemon, chives, and salt&pepper to taste. The next dishes that came was the CHARBROILED BURGER WITH SHOESTRING FRIES and the CUBANO SANDWICH WITH AN ARUGULA SALAD (I was hoping to order the grilled cheese but it was sadly sold out which was very disappointing). The burger had a lot of blue cheese that kind of overpowered the flavor and it was a bit much. Also, they should note that there are no vegetables in the burger...its just a patty and blue cheese. The shoe string fries were delicious with its touch of rosemary and on the crispier side (which I prefer). The cubano sandwich was good as well with its capers and pork. However, it definitely didnt seem like anything special and the side arugula salad was very small and only dressed with some sort of lemon juice. All in all, the food was very so so. The sandwiches/burgers were underhwleming and seemed like something I can get at a local deli or burger shop.

Last night as we walked up to the restaurant my heart dropped. Line out the door to talk to the hostess.. No such luck. So we went and posted up on a stoop down the street to figure out our next move. I had a feeling that maybe we should go check the bar seating in the spotted pig again justttt in case. We walked back up and the crowd was gone. We walked to the bar and two ladies were JUST getting up and offered us their seats. It was a miracle! We were so excited we literally high fived each other in the middle of the restaurant :)Ok now to what you really care about.. The food. My expectations were high and I was not disappointed. First we started out with 6 oysters from Washington. Mmmm they were meaty and briney and delicious. Next up was the Devils on horseback aka bacon wrapped dates. The sauce they came in was smokey and delicious. I could have eaten a full plate of these. Next up was our bartenders recommendation. The burrata appetizer with roasted mushrooms. Wow this was delicious. The mushrooms were perfectly cooked and went perfectly with the crusty toast and I think arugula salad.Now I have heard that the ricotta gnudi here would change my life and I was not disappointed. Wowwww is the only word I can use to describe it. I mean the sauce is essentially butter and more butter but I could have licked that plate clean. Best gnudi I've ever had hands down. Lastly we had to order the famous burger. It was our first time here and those shoestring fries looked so good. What can I say about this burger? It was good. Nothing to write home about or go out of my way to get. I've had better burgers. The shoestring fries were the real star here. Tossed with rosemary and crisped to perfection. I can tell why this place started the upscale gastropub movement in NYC. It really is a special place.

David Schwimmer, Michael Stipe or Luke Wilson among others.It is worth the wait.  We, however, got lucky and were able to get a table right away (a late Tuesday afternoon.)  Our table felt more like we were dining in a garden.  Potted plants and flowers line the window sills that mirror the entrance.  A tiny bar and dining room downstairs and a bigger bar/dining area upstairs.We were having a girls lunch out and we couldn't have picked a better spot.  Order a pot of pickles, a plate of deviled eggs or the Chicken Liver Toast while you wait for the main course.My companion (my Mother) has come back for the Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Mustard and Onion Marmalade.  This is not your average grilled cheese- toasted on thick bread with gourmet cheese dripping down the sides (don't even know what kind of cheese they use but we didn't care- it was delicious.)The fries are a la carte.  But the portion is enormous so no need to have everyone at the table order their own.  Thin shoestring fries served with fresh rosemary.  Go ahead- dip them in the side of the onion marmalade or the spicy mustard that came on the side of the grilled cheese sandwich.  Your taste buds can thank me later.  You're welcome.I ordered the Burrata with Wild Mushrooms on Toast.  Burrata is a soft Italian cheese made from Mozzarella and cream that just oozed across my thick cut toast.  Topped with a variety of wild mushrooms including the Maitake or the ""dancing mushroom"", this was comfort food at its finest.We also ordered a side of the beets and greens.  Whole baby beets, roasted and mixed with bitter greens.  You will never turn up your nose at beets again and  I can now say I have experienced bitter greens that literally melted in my mouth.Forget I even mentioned Jay-Z.  British Chef April Bloomfield was recently on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon as well as the Today show. The Spotted Pig has been featured in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The New Yorker, The Los Angeles Times, Bon Appetit and now, lucky for them, here on The Hungry Sprout.  Or I guess lucky for me for being able to experience this.Did I mention they have even been awarded a Michelin star which is a top honor given to only the best of the best restaurants in the world?  Ya, they have one of those too.My only complaint is the lack of space for tables.  Some of the tables are very close together and you may find yourself sitting almost on top of the strangers sitting next to you.Then again, forget you read this.  I don't want to have to wait for a table in line behind you.......",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

When I eat food at my father and stepmother's house, I get sad. Their food is chronically undersalted in a healthful way, and I struggle through it. I literally will eat Maldon flake sea salt on its own when I'm cooking with it. And I could practically drink soy sauce. I just love salt that much. Ok, so I love salt. But the food at The Spotted Pig is so insanely salty, it verges on inedible. It's a delicious proximity, taking me right to the brink of salt sanity. But in the end, it's just way too freaking salty. And this is from someone who loves salt!I used to live around the corner from this place 7, 8 years ago. I thought back then it was too salty. I distinctly remember my last visit just being overwhelmed by salt. So I took a hiatus, moved to another borough, and stayed away from the Spotted Pig for many, many years. A few weeks ago my husband and I found ourselves starving after a trip to the Whitney and I said, ""Hey, how about the Spotted Pig?"" The salty memory of my last visit was burned in my mind, but I so badly wanted to give it another go. I had loved it so much when I lived nearby.We had the burger, and the smoked haddock chowder (gotta love how the menu does not change here, this was another one of my favorite dishes back when), and some deviled eggs. But again... the food was...SO SALTY it verged on inedible. How does someone who does not love salt like me even eat this stuff? (I'm literally sitting here salting my food as I write this. I cannot overstate my love of salt.) I thought maybe my last visit was a bad day in the kitchen but fast forward 8 years and everything's the same... the decor, the menu, and THE SALT!!!The burger was solidly good and cooked to perfection but the bun really left something to be desired. It was so dry. And the cheese. SO salty. The chowder was ace. But so salty. Actually the deviled eggs were great.

The last visit in particular, was largely the most unpleasant dinner experience I have ever wrote about on yelp.It was a weekend night. The staff was running around completely overwhelmed. The host at the entrance didn't know what he was doing. Called us back 2 hours before he had initially predicted, but then made us wait for 40 minutes in the middle of staff hurrying back and forth before giving us our table. He passively-aggressively suggested that it was our fault, for taking 12 minutes to walk back to the restaurant, while they allow 10, so our table had been given away in the meantime...Take away message: we're trying to cram every inch of our establishment with as many wallets as we can, and squeeze every wallet as hard as possible.Once at the table, the waitress said they had no specials for the evening. Another disappointment that seems very indicative of what is going on generally in the restaurant: an absence of creative drive, no interest in captivating the guests, in one word, laziness. Take the burger for instance. Come on. It is neither great nor original. It is just a lazy attempt of being mildly provocative and imaginative. The shoestring fries do create a whimsical presentation, but they completely saturate both taste and texture. The same is for the burger itself: the outrageous amount of roquefort is not creative, it results is something heavy, boring and mono-dimensional. The meat is there only for the texture. Its taste is completely masked by the cheese and the absence of seasoning. Lazy, lazy, lazy. It's sad. The Spotted Pig we knew and loved has become a lazy flatulent swine stained with greedy disrespect towards the basic honest tenets of hospitality.

I was looking for a casual dining experience where no reservations were necessary. We went later in the evening and were lucky enough to walk right up to the downstairs bar and score the corner spot. We ended up talking for several hours and sharing some bites with the other patrons and the bartender and had a lovely dinner and some delicious cocktails. I would highly recommend this funky little spot on your next trip to the City. The deviled egg and angels on horseback were yummy and the gnudi was delicious!

477,hE5wEu8Sa1NkMLmPSWHrMQ,Pierre C.,1.0 star rating,"Why Spotted Pig:I was in the area for a hair cut and it was late, so I decided to meet a friend at Spotted Pig. I decided on Spotted Pig out of convenience rather than quality and atmosphere. I've been to Spotted Pig before, so this wasn't my first time dining and drinking at Spotted Pig. Wait time:We walked in and waited 15 minutes before being seated. We ordered some libations at the bar while waiting. Side note, the maitre d (I use this term loosely) was hunched over looking down the entire time he took our name and asked us to wait.  Overall impressions:The place is a dump with service equivalent to a junior high school cafeteria staff - I apologize for comparing the wonderful cateteria staff to those at Spotted Pig. Outside of the bartender, who was professional, the rest of the staff looked miserable and indifferent. Perhaps Spotted Pig is a stepping stone to bigger and better things. I don't think it is difficult for someone to just do their job. I don't expect any extra service, but I do expect someone to make sure my food is eatable, satisfactory, and hopefully not insult me.Atmosphere:Mostly tourist with a few locals - 80/20 respectively. Since I'm not a regular my comment is base on the 90 minutes while in the eatablishment - Sunday late afternoon.Service: Bartender was great, she was very professional. Our male waiter was a dud. I hope he finds peace in his life. Beside our table he was indifferent towards all the table tops in his zone. Since all the other table tops around us were tourist, they didn't mind his attitude.Would I return or recommend: Never....not even during a zombie apocalypse and Spotted Pig is the only a safe zone within 100 mile radius.The menu is stale and hasn't been updated. I just seems I've seen the same dishes on the menu and they get worse every year.Food: Thing we ordered:Haddock Chowder with Pancetta ... Impression, if this dish was a car it would be missing an engine and wheels. I couldn't see any remnants of a fish and pancetta. Ironically, pancetta is salty and has a strong flavor when added to soup base.  My dish has as my bacon as a veggie burger. This was the worse chowder I've eaten. I would have been better buying a can of soup from the local market and microwaving it. Pork Rillette with Mustard, Pickles, and Toast: The pork rillette was the best dish we order. The rillette has a good consistency and nice flavour. Downside, the toast was burnt... not char but burnt like a fire log. We asked the bust boy for another side of toast.  After waiting 20 minutes for our new side of toast we realized it was burnt too. Again, not char which is the proper and expected result... but BURNT like a fire log. I would assume after several years of this dish being on the menu the kitchen would know how to char toast. More important and a comment about the service staff, they served burnt toast to a customer.  If you perform a statistical analysis and moved your alpha to .01, i don't think you would have anyone in a sample who wants to eat burnt toast.Chargrilled Burger:Nothing special.  The shoe-string fried are too greasy and lack flavors. Fires were the worst part of this dish. Overall, they dump a bucket of greasy shoestring fries on your plate. They should be ashamed for dishonouring the term gastro-pub. How much does it cost to combine some herbs, salt, and peppers to make a bucket of seasoning.Drink: Stated earlier. Drinks are not too bad. We ordered a total of 4 cocktails from the drink menu. My favorite drinks were Nelson's Folly and Don Felipe.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I will put out that disclaimer that I felt like the roquefort cheese on the burger has a similar taste to a stinky old bleu cheese, so if that's not you're thing then maybe give something else on the menu a try. Personally, I really liked it but I know that's not for everyone. My date opted for the scallops which were really tasty and a great lighter option to balance out the heavy burger.As good as the food was, my favorite thing about this place is the ambiance. We were seated upstairs which was so charming and full of life. On a Friday night the bar was packed with people grabbing drinks and every seat in the restaurant was taken. This made for some great people watching, perfectly back dropped by the cute and kitschy decor.

To start off there will always be a wait for brunch so be prepared to maybe do some shopping on Bleeker to kill time. Seating definitely isn't the most comfortable as my mom and I were crammed in between people and I was left to sit on an actual stool... We order a bunch of things: The chicken liver, Grilled cheese, deviled eggs, and the burger. I will say the chicken liver over toast was so good my eyes rolled back lol. I live pate and foie gras and that was probably the best liver I had ever had. The devil eggs (don't really eat them ever) were also delicious. My mom's grilled cheese was killer especially with that onion jam spread... What a home run dish! Now when it came to the burger the patty was good and cooked perfectly... but definitely not worth$25! I mean it was just a good patty and I didn't have that cheese on it cause I hate blue cheese. But I am also a fan of all kinds of toppings on my burger so to me it was very bland (would give the burger 3 stars by itself)...

My friend had to pull the table so I could get out of my corner. The famous roquefort burger which 75% of patrons order was interesting at best and mediocre at worst. I actually love roquefort cheese but I just didn't like it with the burger. The fries were actually pretty good and unique. The burger was massive, no actually the whole plate was ginormous. But the only reason I was able to come close to cleaning my plate was the hot sauce I smothered my burger and fries with. Without that hot sauce, I would've stopped 5-6 bites in.The devil's horseback, plum wrapped in bacon, was also disappointing.

I decided that I wanted to try The Spotted Pig for brunch for my first time. Upon arrival, of course there was a wait. Luckily we nabbed a spot by the window. It was a little tight but perfect for the two of us. Unfortunately, we had to watch trash being taken out and cooks bringing food in and out, but given that there was no wait time involved, we counted our blessings and were grateful to eat soon. We started with bloody marys, which come with some nice pickled veggies, and some deviled eggs. The deviled eggs were a little oily albeit delicious. We ordered the infamous roquefort burger with shoestring fries and knew we wanted to share, but we wanted a little something else. Our waitress recommended the burrata with roasted wild mushrooms to start. Best. Decision Ever. The burrata was soft and delicious, and the wild mushrooms were so aromatic with the perfect hint of acid to bring a bright flavor. We had ordered the burger medium rare, and unfortunately The Spotted Pig loses a star for serving us a medium well burger. Huge pet peeve of mine, especially when you're paying over $20 for a burger. Don't get me wrong, it was still delicious, and we're not the type to complain to our server (considering how long things can take in NYC). While the first couple of bites of shoestring fries are crisp and delicious, when you get a huge pile, the bottom is always lackluster by the time you get to it.

Seriously, it's not good or even worth waiting hours for. I had to wipe off all the blue cheese from my burger just so I was able to finish it. Also, the large portion of fries is impressive, but it's so difficult to eat because they're way too thin.

490,1sxXLUKn6qCCVRJPhRNVYQ,Ken S.,4.0 star rating,"KenScale: 8.5/10The Spotted Pig is probably the most well-known gastropub in NYC, period. Getting a reservation at this restaurant helmed by chef April Bloomfield is notoriously difficult at this restaurant that doesn't take reservations (last time I checked in, I was given a wait time of two hours, so I didn't get nearby since then knowing that, although I would be more than happy to wait, my friend(s) who join me would probably lose patience). Lately, I had a opportunity to go on a pretty early dinner, so I decided to use that opportunity to finally check this restaurant out. The dinner time starts at 5:30 p.m., and I walked in for some beer and wrote my name down at 5 p.m. I was not impressed with the other restaurant led by chef Bloomfield in the city (The Breslin) other than their famed lamb burger, so I tried to manage my expectations, Fortunately, there were truly outstanding winners coming out from the kitchen, and the best dish wasn't the famed burger.I started out with a bunch of bar snacks. Deviled egg was tasty and so were the greasy devils on horseback wrapped in bacon. My winner, though, was the chicken liver toast that was absolutely delicious with great balance of flavor. While everyone is talking about the burger here and all the tables I've seen ordered at least one (more on the burger later), my favorite dish of the night was the simple-looking yet truly outstanding sheep's milk ricotta gnudi with brown butter and crispy sage. The ricotta inside was just pure decadence and I can't stop thinking about that dish with soft texture with bold flavor. Yes, the burger was also great, but I think it could've tasted even better without the roquefort cheese whose strong flavor somewhat undermined the juicy texture of the meat. While I understand where the hype is coming from, I wouldn't call this burger the best thing that happened to NYC. I was beyond stuffed by the time I finished the burger, but wanted to try at least one dessert. I'm so glad I did because the seasonal tart that came with bananas was one of the best tarts I've had in a while, with awesome flavor working very well with the silky smooth bananas without being overly sweet.Your best bet to get seated at The Spotted Pig is to show up 1-2 minutes before 5 p.m., write your name down and hope for the best when the dinner service starts at 5:30 p.m. There is just no other way! I liked the charming, divey gastropub feel of the restaurant with tons of pig figures on the wall. The restaurant has a full bar with nicely prepared classic cocktails (my favorite was Manhattan), so either go with some cocktails or brews to wash down the food. The Spotted Pig certainly lived up to its expectations, and I'll certainly come back next time I want to have a casual pub food night with bold flavor and skillful execution.

Also, those shoestring fries are absolutely worthless.I almost felt like this was 3-star worthy, but that was mostly because of the slight let down feeling I had after reading endlessly about this burger on every list of best burgers ever and seeing all of the rave reviews about the restaurant everywhere you look.But the food here is actually really good. Except for those silly shoestring fries (sorry, I just really don't get those).With the reputation preceding this place, I thought I was slick going on a Monday to avoid the crowds and the long waits, but no such luck. Well, we actually got there at a little before 1 PM, and had to wait about 25 minutes for a table, which I guess could have been a lot worse if we went during the weekend. Actually, toward the end of our wait, we already heard the host quoting 45 minutes to an hour wait times even for parties of two. Insane.It's a very hip atmosphere. The stools in place of proper chairs for all the seating is always a dead giveaway for that. My wife likes a back to her seat when she eats, so she was pleased when we were led to our table on the second floor in a cozy little area of the restaurant where there are some benches for same-side table seating against the walls. The entire place also has a nice fun motif of pig decorations everywhere, from nice pig paintings to little pig signs on the bathrooms. The place happens to pull off a kitschy vibe while also being classy/hipster at the same time.So if you come here and don't order the burger, you are a failure. To start, it also seems like the other thing people can't stop whining about is the Deviled Egg ($4). This was OK I guess. Mad oily, and nothing mind-blowing (yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…). We also got the Chicken Liver Toast ($6). This was also extremely rich and heavy, but was delicious.Now, the burger. It's a really thick, sizable patty which is great. The roll is nice and thick and tasty, which is great, and very important so it can soak up all that juice from the meat and not get soggy. The Roquefort cheese didn't really do it for me. It was a little too funky. That little bit aside though, I do concur that this is a very excellent burger. But its not as transcendent as all of these other chefs and food bloggers would lead you to believe.The shoestrings fries are a real waste of time and stomach space. Aside from the huge pile of them looking kind of cool and making for a pretty picture next to the huge burger (yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…), they really have no culinary or enjoyment value at all. They're really hard to eat and are not particularly tasty. To even taste them, you've gotta get a good fistful of them in your mouth at once since they're so thin on their own, which is a real mess and pretty embarrassing as you can feel the other hipsters watching you make a pig out of yourself.Another reason I came on Monday instead of the weekend was to try the Cubano Sandwich ($18) since I love Cuban sandwiches and this one looked really good and they don't have it on the weekend brunch menu. It did not disappoint. In fact, this might have been even more enjoyable than the burger for me, though it came with an equally forgettable side that was also a waste of time, some greens dressed in oil.Lastly, we ended with the Banoffee Pie ($8) (yelp.com/biz_photos/the-…). This was truly incredible. Composed of layers of dulce de leche, pastry cream, sliced bananas and whipped cream, this really shows that they know what they're doing here. One of the tastiest desserts I've had.This probably sounds like a lot of complaining for a 4-star review. But it's just that I expected more after all the hype. All of the food really is excellent. You definitely need to come here at least once to try that burger (don't waste yourself on the fries though).",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"
504,oZ4iTR4Yc2ZCdohN2P3ytw,Jennifer M.,4.0 star rating,"Came here with a group of 6 on Saturday night around 6pm exact, and was told that the waiting list for a table was 2 hours. Of course our party didn't believe it. They were plenty of tables open on the second floor so we knew that they were pretty conservative about telling people how long they would have to wait. I'm pretty sure it's also a tactic so that it turns a few percentage of people away because of their no reservation policy. So roughly about an hour later we get seated upstairs by the bar. I totally understand why some people get a little annoyed at the seating arrangements. It's a little too close for comfort, but I didn't really mind it since I was with family. Overall food impressions? Food was really good!!!!  The CHICKEN LIVER TOAST, the OYSTERS, CRISPY PIG'S EAR SALAD, they were all amazing. I had shared the LAMB SHANK FOR TWO with a cousin of mine and it was phenomenal! I don't usually order lamb or eat it for that matter, but it was fall off the bone amazing! NOTE:*******I did try a bite of their BURGER that everyone seems to notoriously order here. Although it seems to be the plainest thing on the menu, that Roquefort cheese is mighty powerful, So I highly don't recommend it if you're not a stinky cheese person. There are so many things on the menu that are actually better than the burger.Drawbacks to this place? Service is a little long between courses.Torn between the Spotted Pig and the Breslin?

We were fortunate to find spots at the bar upstairs and ordered skimpy $15 mimosas. Got a table on schedule. I ordered a burger and was anticipating the delicious mound of shoestring fries. After another 45 minutes our food arrived and my burger that was ordered medium . Came out very rare. Though by this time I was famished, I sent it back.  The waitress seemed pissed. When it finally returned it was dry well done and  on a charred bun without any dressing or condiments. I finally found someone to ask if I could have the blue cheese that was supposed to accompany it.  I was brought a small dish of blue cheese.  Overall lousy service and the worst burger I ever had( didn't eat).

Finally. We quickly ordered two burgers with fries that was apparently so good and famous. When the food came, I ritually took several pictures and posted on Instagram with a caption ""better be worth the wait""I took a huge bite out of the burger expecting something amazing. Then I proceeded to add another comment to my post, ""not worth it.""The cheese was too strong for me. I probably would have loved it if it wasn't for the cheese.

517,-eQIn-rYsqG9zLTNA0xvAg,Shannon W.,3.0 star rating,"What a cool, fun, trendy, hip, very 'West Village like' spot. I loved the large pig posters that align the entire restaurant. My only gripe...it's so crowded you can't move and it seems there's always a 2 hour wait here for a seat. Plus, the upstairs bathroom is super small & hard to find, 2 stalls, coed, and dark. Neither here nor there. Moving on, we walked in on Saturday around 6pm and I thought, it's early enough, there should be seating...haha. There was a ton of seats available too, but they told us there was a 2 hour wait. Since the downstairs bar was packed, we decided to walk upstairs and hover over some people at the bar until they left. I ordered a Novo Mundo cocktail to start, the bartenders here really do know their drinks and know how to make a mean cocktail. The drink was awesome. We also ordered the ""Devils on Horseback"" app to start...(date stuffed with a smoked almond  wrapped in bacon), they came 4-5 to a plate with a tasty brown sugar, ginger, sauce on the side. I'm not a huge pork fan, but with a name like the Spotted Pig, you have to assume everything is coming with bacon. The bacon was a bit fatty for my liking, but the app was tasty. I paired the dish with a glass of Sauv Blanc, which was delicious. We also ordered the chicken liver toast with came with 2 pieces of toasted bread and a ton of chicken liver mousse on top. It was tasty. Again, would not  advise coming here if you're a vegetarian. I thought it was interesting how they have a woman at the bar upstairs putting food together and a little oven to cook food, so that it comes out right away. After about an hour two girls left and we snagged their bar seats. (There are maybe 8/10 bar seats max). We then ordered the Seared Mackerel with sweet potato mash for a main meal (I .don't eat beef but if I did, I would have ordered the burger as almost every person here had ordered the burger) The fish was flaky and fresh and the sweet potato mash was tasty. I didn't think the bacon they put on top of the fish was really necessary and the bacon was a bit overcooked. I like bacon crunchy if I'm going to eat it. We also ordered the brussel sprouts as a side dish, it was okay. I thought the brussel sprouts could have been cooked a little bit more and overall, they were a bit bland. The dish also came with pieces of pork, I think small pieces of crunchy bacon would have been better. I had the mulled wine after dinner which was absolutely delicious, especially on a cold winter day. Hot spiced wine with brandy, orange, and winter spices. Delish. While we were sitting there, the bartenders were making a ton of unique cocktails, I wanted to drink the whole bar! Overall synopsis: Young, trendy crowd Food is good, very meaty.

Thankfully, they have a texting service, so went around the corner to the historic (cash only) White Horse Tavern for a drink while we waited.

The service was good, though, and despite the volume, was quick.We started out with Devils on Horseback (prunes wrapped in bacon) and an unlisted beef medallions in a cheese sauce. Our friend got the Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi with Brown Butter & Sage and my wife and I each for the Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestring Fries.

The food was hit or miss. Burger is decent, though I am aware it's touted as one of the best. The meat is very good quality, seasoned well and cooked to order, but was overshadowed by the generous smear of roquefort cheese. The fries are more like potato stix and, while plentiful, were cumbersome to eat. Even so, I ate it all because it's potatoes and salt and why the hell wouldn't I? We had the pot of pickles and brussels sprouts as appetizers. Both were very small and I think not worth it. I'd still go back for the food, but this is the type of meal that makes me think of restaurants that rely on their hype to drive business and prices, instead of the quality that caused the hype in the first place, as restaurants in NYC are wont to do.

But since this place has been on my ""To-try list' for quite some time now, and we weren't thatt hungry, so we decided to just walk around the serene neighbourhood, while join the hype to be on the waitlist.When it was our time to get seated, the hostess greeted us with an annoyed attitude. I get it, I would be too if I have to deal with this amount of people all day long - but it just wasn't a pleasant experience for any customers; especially right after we have waited 90 minutes for a table! Anyways, I were sat at a dark corner at a small table, it was small and cramped, and the only light source was from this tiny candle on our table, I could barely tell the colour of my water. At this point, we already know the wait was not worth it, but we tried to make the best out of the night, and ordered the most praised items: the chicken liver toast and the center-of-attention Burger with shoestring fries. The chicken liver toasts were good, it was the right amount of savory and saltiness, it also has a good texture and wasn't too pasty. After that, we waited 45 minutes for the burger to come out, and it was again a disappointment. The burger was just a regular burger with roquefort cheese, it created a nice mix of salty, and tangy flavor to the burger, but it really isn't that amusing and is far from the best. They also seemed to mixed fries from different batches, some are crunchy and fresh, while some are cold and soggy. After 2 bites, we dashed out of this place, it wasn't worth the time.

I love the decor of the restaurant. It's laid back in here. We started off at the bar but as tables started to clear, our server moved us. That was sweet of her. She was friendly and quick. Service was not all that attentive but nothing too bad. Everything we ordered was memorable. The Deviled Eggs were excellent. Soft and smooth egg seasoned to perfection. The creamy filling had a slight tang. The Lemon Ricotta Pancake with Candied Almonds had a lovely consistency. Lightly crisp on the edges, fluffy/cakey middle, not too heavy and sweet. The almonds added a nice crunchy consistency. On top, dollops of creamy ricotta. Completed with a dust of powdered sugar and thin slices of mint. Gave the dish a sweet and cooling element. Highly recommended.With so many reviews mentioning the Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese, I was a bit afraid of the hype. My fellow Yelpers didn't let me down. It's delicious. It's not super dressed up with tomatoes, lettuce and onions. The toasty bun is soft in the middle. The meat patty is nicely charred which gives it a beautiful smokey flavor. Juicy in the middle and well seasoned. The meat patty is topped with creamy, sweet, salty and smokey Roquefort Cheese. Simple and delicious.

My suggestion if you're not a blue cheese fan is to ask for the cheese on the side. It let me try a bit of it and I could how much (or little) I wanted to the burger. We ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. Patty quality was great. Cost is $22 so it's not cheap, but a better burger than I've had at other spots that charge even more.We sat downstairs - really cute place when it's quiet and I'd suggest going early as they don't take reservations. Definitely will come back to try other items on the menu - but this burger is on my top NY-burger list.

538,UGplSQK4-sZDCW38HtK5Xg,Katrina C.,4.0 star rating,"Went here on a busy Friday, about an hour's wait for 2 people. Not horrible for a Friday at a popular restaurant, so we meandered around the village for a while which is easy enough as there's plenty of shops to check out in the area while you wait, not to mention the Gansevoort market if you don't mind being tempted by lots of delicious food while you wait for your table to be ready. First off, the ambiance is very cute, the lighting is pleasantly orange. However, the seating is downright awful. You are going to be sitting on a backless stool while you eat your dinner. I can deal, but dang was that uncomfortable. They have a few booths to sit in, but there's no guarantees which table you'll get. Second off, it was a fairly warm autumn day in the city, but the restaurant was quite warm inside. I was wearing a sweater dress and I had to tie my hair up and roll up my sleeves so as to not overheat. The food was pretty good. The chicken liver toast was probably my favorite part of the meal, and the shoestring fries that came with my burger were a close second. I could eat those things all day. The burger itself came rare when I asked for medium, but I can deal with that. Someone less forgiving than me may have sent it back, but whatevs. It was tasty, even though I'm not a big fan of Roquefort cheese. In the end I took the cheese off the burger. And everything was so, so salty. Fortunately they are very good at refilling your water glass! We got the gnudi as well, which was tasty and the presentation was very pretty. Be forewarned though, the cheese in the gnudi is very very strong. Overall good, not mind blowing, but a tasty meal.

According to the website, dinner service starts at 5:30. Me and my boyfriend got there Sunday evening a few minutes after 5:30 not expecting too much of a wait. In fact, it was a 30 minute wait. However, the host took down my phone number and they would text me when my table was ready. The bar was pretty crowded so we went to a wine bar nearby for a drink. The wait ended up being less than 30 minutes.Me and my boyfriend were seated upstairs in an alcove area that had 6-7 tables of 2, but it seemed like an area where they seated all couples. Service was really slow, which is where they lost a star. The waitress brought around water fairly quickly, but soon after that is where service went downhill. It took a while for them to take our order. None of the appetizers on the menu appealed to me, but after sitting around and waiting for my burger, I looked around and noticed the board with the specials written out that was out of my sight. I definitely would have ordered some of their specials, but the waitress did not mention anything about specials to us. The wait to get our burger was really long - waited upwards to maybe 30 minutes. I had my burger was served with no cheese. Just the beef patty and bun. The patty was so juicy and tasty, meeting and surpassing my expectations. I usually like ketchup on my burger but this didn't need any. The shoestring fries were crispy and delicious. Besides the service, I have no complaints about the food itself. I would definitely recommend getting here early.

I would have rated my first time 4 stars based on the food and drinks. I now give it one star because of the horrendous customer service experience me and my friend received the other night. A group of our friends arrived earlier than us and were seated. Getting a seat for me and my friend turned out to be the issue. The hostess was extremely rude, taking out her frustrations on me and my friend based on my other friends demanding attitude which I came to find out later on. My friend told us to sit at the table next to theirs. The hostess snatched the menu out of my friends hands and said that we shouldn't have sat ourselves. **Just thinking about this boils my blood**....anyway...My friend asks to speak to the manager to explain what just happened.Manager comes over, straight faced, and my friend reaches out to give him a handshake and introduce himself. The manager completely ignores it. My friend proceeds to explain what happened and the manager asks ""what do you want me to do?"". My friend explains that usually when a customer is having a bad experience, it is customary to advise the manager (stating the obvious). The manager then says, ""okay is that all?"". Me and my friend were shocked and confused. We literally could not think of anything else to say. What else can you say other than your basic instinct to curse them out! The manager ends with saying ""have a great dinner"". Nothing was done or resolved. We got up, left our friends, and ate a pub nearby (which turned out to be a good experience). We REFUSED to spend a penny at that place. I will NEVER go there again just based on that experience alone. There are so many great restaurants in the city to take my out-of-town friends and family.

We sat along the window, a small cozy 2 top. The seats don't have backs, which could be uncomfortable if you plan on sitting for a while (we were there for 2 hours).$14 for an okay Negroni seemed ridiculous, but the $10 mug of cask beer was on point.

I went on a Sunday around 11:30 and we were incredibly lucky that they had a table for us at that time, since it's super popular and super small. I didn't have anything to drink but if I was interested in a cocktail, that bloody mary looked deeeeeelicious. Plus they're meant to have cool drinks and good beer. The chicken liver toasts were like dinosaur liver toasts. Sean ordered the Dutch pancakes with bacon and maple (which is something he would never normally order) and I wanted to try the burger and the frittata and grilled cheese so the rest of us ordered those to share. Plus I ordered the chicken liver toasts for the table because that's like a thing here. THEN Sean saw the chicken liver toasts and he was like ""oh, perfect I'm going to eat this instead and not eat any of the thing I ordered which nobody else wants ok cool this is great that worked out so well for me"" and I was like ""um, whatever I don't even like liver"" so it was fine. But I was like...c'mon son. The ""fries"" that come with the burger are more like the potato sticks that I used to eat when I was little at my grandpa's house. The ones that come out of a can. Yeah they're mostly akin to that. They are not fries. Next time I'll try a different side that I will actually eat. They look more beautiful than they taste and more beautiful than I can ever look while attempting to cascade tiny ass light ass shoestring ""fries"" chip sticks into my mouth. The burger was undercooked but still delicious. I'm pretty sure the grilled cheese was made by like a priest or some sort of holy figure.

Getting a table was a cinch late on a Tuesday evening - we walked right in! True to the name, the place is so cute and porky. Lots of piggy trinkets everywhere, low lighting, and a very laid-back vibe. The service was instantly wonderful and remained so throughout the meal. I immediately ordered a Manhattan, which was perfection, and perused the menu. We ordered a soup special with butternut, barley, and lovely spices. It was the best squash soup I've ever had! Next was the stracciatella, a thick slice of grilled bread covered in melty cheese and luscious mushrooms. One of my dining companions who typically hates mushrooms was as in love with this dish as I was! We also shared the burger and the seared scallops with crispy kale and delicata. I can't say anything more without professing our utter obsession with the amazingly crispy garlic rosemary shoestring fries! They were so good that we ordered a second round. The texture and flavors were intoxicating, from the fragrant rosemary to the salty and ever-so-light potatoes. I hate to say it but they overshadowed the burger, which was good but not memorable. It's a plain burger with a smear of stinky cheese on a grilled bun. My companions didn't like it at all, but I ate a quarter of it and enjoyed it.Can't wait to return next time I'm in the city!

When I had about a fourth of the burger left, I scraped off the cheese because I just couldn't handle it anymore. The bun was nothing special.The fries were OK, but they were more of a nuisance than anything else. How does one eat those fries without looking/feeling like a crazy person? At some point, you end up shoveling fistfuls of fries in your mouth like a barbarian. Not attractive.The deviled eggs were great though! And so was the service.

If you like your burger like you like your (wo)men - strong, intense Roquefort cheese, totally bare bones with no lettuce or tomato or onion.

The Burger: A salty bomb of deliciousness that melts instantly as it touches your mouth. It's on par with the Breslin burger, which came as no surprise after reading the chef bio's. This alone is worthy of one of their Michelin stars.Fries (come with burger): Perfectly salted and crisp. The fried rosemary and garlic adds a flavorful pop without being overpowering. The Market Salad: the lettuce was fresh and the pomegranate was a nice touch, but I found the salad to be boring. It was missing the flavor of a good dressing. Would have tried a different salad if choosing from the dinner menu. Service: I love that we were able to be seated so quickly. Definitely picked a good time to stop in.

The deviled eggs and devils on horseback really don't get much better. The burger was very good, but was a little surprised that it has gotten so much hype. That said, the fries are the star.

This place has been known to have insanely long wait times, but if you come for brunch or lunch right when they open you may get lucky like us and the restaurant will have lots of open tables.Order the Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestring Fries. It's made from marbled chuck, short loin, and brisket.  They char-grill this patty and top it with Roquefort blue cheese and snuggle it up with a charred brioche bun.  I'm a sucker for bleu cheese and the kind they use here is possibly the best I've ever had.

Once it was 10 seconds to midnight, one of the employees started counting down. As we were looking around expecting champagne, she rushed to the kitchen. All the servers and kitchen staff were in there, with champagne in hand. For about 10 minutes, they drank champagne and celebrated, while we watched them. Nothing for the custumers. It was ridiculously unprofessional. Half an hour later, when we could finally get a hold of our server, we asked her what happened with the champagne, she was like ""oh nobody served you? Sorry about that"" as if SHE wasn't our server. She brought three glasses. All the sparkle of the champagne was gone. Probably the bottle was opened hours ago.

April Bloomfield's charming space in the West Village is regarded as NYC's first gastropub.

This simple concoction is sandwiched between nicely grilled Brioche buns and served with fries. Whoa! This is a great burger. It's juicy and packed with flavor, mostly from the cheese, but nevertheless, this more than hit the spot after a drunken debauchery.  But what really, really made me happy was the mountain of shoestring fries.  Endless strings of salty, rosemary herbed potatoes!!!  You pick up a bunch, tip your head back and let the crunchy potatoes sink into your mouth.  Sooo superbly addicting, we ordered another one, since obviously, one mountain of potatoes isn't enough for me.

This was a very smooth tasting burger. However, this was only determined by eating parts of the burger not covered in the Roquefort cheese. The cheese overpowered the mild beef. The seasoning was appropriate to the mild flavors of the beef. The savory blend was applied as the patty cooked, and and it served to round out the mild flavors of the carefully constructed burger.

Didn't try the renowned burger but I saw it all around, topped with hills of stringy fries.  Looked delish.  People seemed to enjoy putting in their mouths.Dessert is a no brainer:Banoffee pie.A British invention, it's a banana toffee pie and it must be ordered despite its ridiculous and ambiguous name.  (Ambiguous because, lacking any other context, it could be a banana coffee pie and... wait, why is that not a thing?  That sounds great.)  Things like this pie are one of the many reasons our stomachs are flexible.  Whatever you ate and drank beforehand, however you feel, however bad an idea it may be to order a dessert, just shut up and order it and then shove it in your mouth, safe in the knowledge that your stomach will almost certainly stretch to accommodate it.  Someday, perhaps someday soon, all hell's gonna break loose.  Political or environmental disaster will be upon us.  Cities will topple.  Land masses will flood.  Regimes will rise that will most certainly not be pie friendly.  And you--YOU!--will be left cold, scared, perhaps injured and perhaps alone, and you will stare out at the apocalypse around you and note the chemically and syrupy atmosphere, and your heart will sink with the recognition that on top of all the other things that are horrible, it is now also true that you are unlikely to ever again have the opportunity to eat this pie nor, indeed, any other pie.Anyway Spotted Pig's a cool spot and I'd come back for lunch or dinner.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Let me preface this review by stating that this delicious gastropub is expensive ($25 for their famous burger). However, if the food I'm paying for is amazing, I'm not going to knock stars off simply for price. My boyfriend and I started the night off at the bar downstairs - I ordered a cider and he the Speckled Hen. My boyfriend was ecstatic that they had the Speckled Hen on tap. We spent a few months living in London and the Speckled Hen was one of his favorite beers from the U.K. I'm not a beer drinker, but he said it tasted exactly like it had in London and was very happy to start off our dinner with it. My cider was delicious and crisp and when I hadn't finished it when it came time to be seated, the wait staff brought up my glass (and our tab) with us when we moved to our table upstairs. My boyfriend and I started off with the cheese platter special and the fish chowder. The cheese was good, noting to blow your socks off. However, the chowder was one of the best chowders I've ever had, hands down. We had agreed to split the chowder as an appetizer, but we almost ordered another one - it was that good. For dinner my boyfriend ordered the steak and I ordered the burger with shoestring fries (I asked for no bun). My boyfriend loved his steak and was excited by the unusual but delicious flavors paired with it. My burger was unreal. No ketchup or mustard needed, the cheese and seasoning on it is perfect and they cooked it exactly to my liking (medium rare). The fries were also delicious and fun to eat - the mustard they give you for dipping is spicy, but so good I couldn't stop myself, even though I can't handle spice.

So me and my friend finally made it here and waited around an hour and a half on a saturday night as they don't take reservations. We expected that sort of wait so we didn't mind and did what anyone else would do with time to kill, find a bar and have a drink. We were seated and I was a bit surprised at how small the place is but by keeping it small they can keep their eye on what's important which is the quality and taste of the food. So I made the best life decision to get the chicken liver toast, I really really like chicken livers and my father makes the best but this place makes a chicken liver to rival the best. It was just out of control! Even if you are grossed out by the thought, be adventurous and try it, you will be rewarded with such amazing taste. For dinner i went with the burger which was so big and juicy and all sorts of yummy. I'd have to say this was one of the best meals I've had lately.

Burger was ok but at 22 bucks and with greasy unhealthy shoe string fries (nicely accented tho by fresh rosemary in the oil) - think of potato chips with a glass of Mazzola - no veggies and a butter pat of cheese all I can say is NO.

Ok what's 4 bucks but for 6 olives?  Ditto for ""pickle jar"".   Stingy portions but most perplexing why on earth have these exotic dishes with great ingredients in a dive bar setting (I hate sloppy places) served by polite polished guys AND not a thing PIG on the menu except for pork rillettes.

If you can stomach the West Village princesses, the aging frat boys, and the trying-to-still-be-hip middle-aged clientele, then I would say hang in there because the food is actually worth it. No, I did not have the burger. I could tell just by looking at it that it would not be great. A good burger, sure. But not great. So I went with the barkeep's recommendation and had the radish salad as a small plate along with my gin and tonic. And it was delicious! I am not one for overspending on simple dishes like salads, but I would go back and try this one. Somehow pressed and infused with parmesan and basil, the radishes are not spicy at all. They are fresh and crisp and have a delicious watery taste that totally charmed me. Topped with wafer-thin red onion and bright, citrusy arugula leaves, I really enjoyed the salad. Also, because I couldn't resist, I got a side of shoestring fries. The side dish portion is huge! And loaded with salt. I loved the herbs (sage? rosemary? could not tell) that they used, which I think they dropped in the fryer with the potatoes. But oh my gosh can you say salt overload? Really, I could feel my heart slow down with every mouthful of crispy potato-stix-like crunch of fries. Still quite tasty and I did almost inhale the entire bowl of fries, but sometimes, like with salt, less is more. I may go back for a drink at the bar and some small plates again, maybe the ricotta gnudi, but I honestly don't think the burger (or any of the main dishes, from the looks of them) are worth the sticker price.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

And, you know, expectations play such a big part in your impressions. If we had ""discovered"" a place like this accidentally we would have been charmed. But when it's so overhyped, it never quite measures up.Went right at 5:30 after a stroll down the High Line and the wait wasn't too bad. Had a delicious cask ale while waiting for a table. Space was crowded. We were glad to get a table with real chairs. Noticed some sitting on wooden stools with no backs. Decor was cute and kitschy - lots of pigs. Waitress was super professional, really knew her stuff, but for some reason their ""policy"" is that they won't put in the appetizer order until you have decided on the whole meal. Can't see how that helps the kitchen. Maybe they they just want to close the deal on ordering so they can be assured of turning the table.But the food was excellent and the service throughout the meal was attentive.

After a few drinks at a different pub, decided an extravagant burger is exactly the late-night food I needed.Roquefort Burger ($21), Deviled Egg ($4), Nightingale Cocktail ($13). Delicious deviled egg, cold and creamy with a nice touch of condiments on top that balanced out the yolk flavor. Cocktail was small for the price, but tasted good, although not as strong as I would have hoped.As for the burger, they actually cooked the patty correctly (not as common as you'd think), but I felt the cheese overpowered the rest of the burger. I like strong cheese, but it wasn't balanced well at all, especially since most of it was towards the middle, meaning every bite got stronger. Shoe string fries felt more like a decoration than an actual part of the meal, but decent.Nice service, quaint place, but not paying for that again.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"
607,pz3Ulbuk7ZiUUbT7oFzmpA,Lori L.,3.0 star rating,"Prior to my visit to Spotted Pig, I had gone through the countless reviews, articles, and accolades focused solely on its renowned burger; I had built it up in my mind to be, quite possibly, the best burger offered in all of Manhattan. But, let's cut to the chase. Expectations, especially those built up without substantial reason, are only doomed to fail. And similarly, Spotted Pig's burger is not life-changing, but it is a pretty solid burger. I'll give it that much.Set in a somewhat isolated and quiet street in Greenwich Village, the exterior of The Spotted Pig looks nothing like a gastropub or restaurant. After a little bit of searching for the door, I managed to put my name down on the waitlist and was given an estimated 45 minute wait. One downside is that they don't take reservations, so depending on when you decide to drop by for a meal, your wait time can be nonexistant to upwards of 1 or 2 hours. They usually recommend you grab a drink or two at the bar and provided that it isn't swarming with people (which it was on a Friday night), it may be your best option as there aren't many other places in the area for your to wile away the time.The two of us returned and were quickly shown to our table where we were seated against the wall. Tables are placed nearly side by side, and it was impossible to not overhear our neighbors' conversations; there was hardly any table space to even hold our drinks and menus either. At the very least, my friend and I had no need for the menus and were immediately ready to order; after all, we had come here just for one thing: the Chargrilled Burger.In hindsight, our plates looked far more impressive than they actually tasted. A towering pile of shoestring fries is plated next to the burger, a sizable portion of beef neatly sandwiched between two toasted brioche buns with a thin layer of melted roquefort. The shoestring fries were particularly annoying for me as it's impossible to eat more than two or three at a time and the lack of substance in each bite was particularly unsatisfying. Even more of a nuisance was the fact that the remainder of the fries were inseparable from the pile of rosemary they had been seasoned with. As for the burger - I had requested mine to be cooked to a medium and found that it had actually been cooked closer to well-done. Neither could I find anything particularly notable about the patty, except for the unique use of roquefort (as I have a particular weakness for goat cheese). Perhaps the most I can applaud this burger on was the brioche buns, which were the perfect width, smartly toasted, and with the perfect criss-cross grill pattern, although these too seemed to overwhelm the actual burger.So, while I can't personally recommend The Spotted Pig's burger (Bloomfield's burger at her other establishment, the Breslin, is close to life-changing, however), it's certainly worth a try.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

That's how we had our first meal at this very lovely restaurant. I liked the interior more than I expected -- we sat upstairs in a little room to the side, and it felt warm and inviting, and very chill. The service was nice too.  Never felt rushed.We ordered drinks at the bar downstairs, then moved upstairs once our table was ready. The food came out slowly, but not unbearably so. It took us about an hour for dinner with a drink each.Onto the food: we ordered-Squid stew appetizer -Manila clams special -Burger-Banoffee pie-EspressoI know the place is called spotted PIG, but I thought the seafood starters were great. The squid stew had delicious chunks of potatoes and some big pieces of toast to sop up the sauce. The Manila clams were perfect, a balanced but rich seafood flavor, also came with big grilled pieces of bread. The famous burger wasn't that thrilling. The cheese overwhelmed the meat, the brioche bun is a bit too big in proportion to the beef, and we left about a third of the burger on the plate. The fries taste great - I especially liked it with the malt vinegar, which is NOT the Heinz version that is everywhere else. The Banoffee pie was the perfect end to the meal. Was a relaxing way to wrap up the workweek. However, I wouldn't ever wait 2 hours for this place -- there are so many other great places to eat around here so it's not worth it.

In terms of the food, the chicken liver toast was very tasty and rich, definitely worth a try. but it all goes downhill after that.......The fish was bland, a little bit fishy and the skin is not crispy enough, definitely not worth the money. The burger was a let down mainly because of the shoestring fries. There were way too much salt and the texture was poor.

I loved it, but some people might not), and our server was nice. Our hostess? Not so much. My friend asked if it would be possible for a side of pickles for the burger (she's particular). The server said no, with no explanation. We were confused, as there was a ""pot of pickles"" as an appetizer. Turns out that appetizer is pickled vegetables, BUT they do include cornichons, though that wasn't mentioned. As the server left, my table commented on the fact that we got such a hard ""no"" on the request. The hostess, listening in, inserted herself into our conversation, stating, ""the chef is very particular and doesn't like to serve anything else with her burger."" Okay, that makes sense, and we were satisfied with the answer. Until she added, ""if you want ketchup, mustard and relish, go somewhere else."" THAT boiled my blood, as it was an unnecessary addition to her point.  Not to mention, she eavesdropped on us and decided it was the perfect time to put us in our place.So, to sum up, food's great. I'd been here many times before and enjoyed the laid back vibe at such a successful restaurant. Until now. I don't think I'll be back on this alone. There are PLENTY of wonderful places in NYC that accompany their food with wonderful staff as well.Side note - when the burger was put in front of us, the bus boy asked, ""would you like ketchup and mustard with this?""

After walking the High Line, we casually stumbled upon what I knew was the infamous Spotted Pig and I knew we had to go in for dinner. Plus, it was perfect since there just so happened to be a table for two open at that moment - extremely rare for a restaurant that I hear has some serious wait times given its recent fame and Michelin star rating. I knew instantly what I had to order: the char grilled burger with Roquefort cheese and shoestring fries. It was perfect. The burger was so simple and understated yet bursting with flavor, it's the way a burger should taste if it's done right. The patty was seasoned to perfection and grilled to a juicy medium well, which still ended up having a nice, slightly pink center. There was no mayo or sauce on the bun, simply a healthy handful of sharp, tangy Roquefort atop the patty. I added just a slight schmear of Dijon mustard that they offered to the top and voila, it created a rich, tangy, slightly creamy condiment to the prime piece of beef. The bun itself had grill marks on it and was soft, buttery and slightly toasted. For a fine dining burger, it had to be the best I've ever had. I'm usually not a fan of shoestring fries, but the Spotted Pig's proved me wrong. There's were so thin and crispy and taken to the next level with fried herbs and garlic chips hidden in between fry curls. I literally had to stop myself from eating them even though I was so full.

Again this is one of the first gourmet burgers I can remember in NYC and their have been so many variations on it that this burger while really good can again get lost in the shuffle of all the pseudo burger bars around now.3) the veggies here are awesome and are so well roasted it is one of the few places I enjoy eating vegetables at.4) the rest of the menu is typically amazing.

It's a corner restaurant with ivy on the outside walls and pig-themed trinkets and decorations all around the inside. It's a tight fit on the inside, but it's better described as cozy than cramped. Be warned though, they don't take reservations so you'll have to put your name on the list, and the list gets long fast. It's worth the wait though, so grab a drink at the bar upstairs or at a place around the corner and come back excited.Culinary execution is the name of the game and The Spotted Pig does not disappoint. I mean, just look at the grill marks on top of the burger bun! Order the chargrilled burger with Roquefort cheese and shoestring fries and you're in for a real treat. The patty is perfectly grilled and is well paired with the right amount of ""stink"" from the blue cheese. Depending on whether or not you like blue cheese, you'll know immediately if this is the right burger for you. Personally, I love it. Let's not forget about those shoestring fries now - a gorgeous heap of aromatic bliss. Fried rosemary and garlic chips make these insanely delicious.So, what are you waiting for?

I mean this place is pretty small and gets packed quickly, so we tried to get there as early as we could after work on a Wednesday. We had an order of oysters that were small, but extremely delicious. My friend ordered a beer and was very pleased by the selection available. We then ordered the infamous burgers and shoestring fries. Wow-- was that underwhelming. The rocquefort on the burger was a little too strong and at a certain point, I just felt like I was tasting sweaty feet. However, I could not stop chomping on those fries. Even when I was full with a pile of fries left, my friend ate all of it. He seemed to enjoy everything.

It's so yummy, it deserves its own paragraphI've also tried their burger to which it claims to be the #1 place in NYC. Probably not the bestttt ever, but pretty damn good. It's perfectly grilled where the meat is juicy and flavorful. I love any type of cheese, so the blue cheese crumble is a nice touch. But if you are like my cousin who despises blue cheese.

The interior is like a pub and would be a fun place to hang out and grab a bite with friends before going out. We both ordered the burger since that's what they're known for. The burger patty itself was prepared perfectly - well seasoned, moist, with a nice pink center. Everything around the burger patty befuddled us though. The burger came with a blue cheese topping (and nothing else) but does everyone like blue cheese? We didn't, and when we asked for ketchup the server said the kitchen doesn't have it, since the chef doesn't prepare burgers with ketchup. Next to the burger were needle-thin shoestring fries which we were confused about how to eat. Do you pick them up in clumps, knock your head back, and mash them into your mouth or do you eat them one by one for the next hour or so?

We looked over the yelp reviews and decided to order:Oysters- enjoyed the mignonette sauce, really fresh and simpleLiver toast - LOTS of liver, if you're a big fan of liver, they definitely do not skimp. there is chunks of liver mixed in with creamy liverInfamous burger - medium rare, I had super high hopes for this burger given the reviews. I think this is the reason for my mediocre review. The medium rare was PRETTY DAMN RARE. And I (stupidly) didn't notice that there was bleu cheese listed in the ingredients (I absolutely cannot stand bleu cheese) so we immediately spit out the burger and scraped the cheese off. I could not get rid of the taste in my mouth. In addition, the shoestring fries were sooooo THIN. It could possible disappear into thin air from your very hands. The fries were super salty and I was not a fan of it. Special - Sisig dish - luckily this redeemed my meal. The cooked egg on top of the dish was amazing! The pork was super salty as well but it was a nice mix with the rice. I was definitely salivating for more. The hot plate kept the pork very crispy and warm while we ate the burger. Would definitely recommend again.Skirt steak dish - Probably the most underrated of the dishes.

It was on their advice that we ordered the Chicken Liver Toast . Thanking them still in my mind. For entrees I had the burger. Yum especially if you like strong cheese you will love this! Cooked perfectly and accompanied by the most deliciously seasoned shoestring fries. My friend got seared fish and that was also quite good.

If you come here, do yourself a favor and get something else.Moving on, their bar snacks are kind of where they shine. My favorite thing I've eaten here is the chicken liver toast, which is so, so, so good. Some other items weren't bad either, like the mussels and a squid special appetizer they had that night. Unremarkable was a pork spread that tasted like tuna salad, and deviled eggs which tasted like any other deviled eggs.

684,-xlluJgoEJMRtP6tiVEL9Q,Xi L.,3.0 star rating,"This is the highly popular 1 michelin star gastropub that you may or may not have heard about, and it is known for its simplistic burger + shoestring fries aka super thin fries. I thought the thinnest and tastiest fries i've ever had were from BJ's Brewery, a west coast chain. However, this place takes the prize for thinnest fries but unfortunately doesnt come close in taste. They are actually so thin that it is quite difficult to taste the actual potato or the density of the fry. This is kind of sad because when you dip in ketchup or any sauce for that matter, the fry breaks in half most of the time unless you are extremely careful so pick your sauce wisely. If you eat them freestyle you need to make sure you have a handful to taste much. The fries are seasoned in rosemary and lightly fried garlic flakes (super strong flavors) but the potato flavor itself, the essence of the fry is really lost.Burgerwise it is as the many many yelp photos suggests: a minimalist burger, but that doesn't mean its bad. However this one can use some improvement. It is 2 buns, a relatively large portion of beef, and a TON of bleu cheese. In fact like many others before me complained, the taste is quite overpowering. Everyone else at my table said the same thing. You definitely need to scrape off at least half of what they give you. There are no other toppings, so if you love bleu cheese this may be your thing, but for the average burger eater, you will likley be better off elsewhere. Also a friend complained that the patty was too small surface area-wise as it doesn't match the size of the bun so be aware of that (nbd to me though).",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Personally, I'm not a big fan of shoestring fries - I prefer my fries a tad fatter because I like to taste the potato if anything.

706,CtVBDAcTtYyg-G480d__PA,Michelle L.,4.0 star rating,"On a quest to find the best burger in NYC, my friend and I came here on a Monday night for dinner. We arrived at around 7:30 and had to wait about 45 minutes for a table due to their no reservations policy, so by the time we were seated, we were both more than ready for our burgers.We also decided to split two appetizers - the devils on horseback and the sheep's milk ricotta gnudi with basil pesto. The devils on horseback were dates and pears wrapped in bacon. They came piping hot, and when I bit into my first one, it was mushier than I expected because I hadn't realized there was also pear in it. They were pretty good, though I wish the bacon flavor had been a little stronger against the pear. Our second appetizer, the ricotta gnudi, was amazing. We had picked it after googling ""ricotta gnudi"" on our phones and deciding that it looked pretty good (though we weren't entirely sure what it was). Turns out it's very similar to ravioli... delicious, melt-in-your-mouth ravioli. Our appetizers came out quite fast, but we had to wait a little longer for our chargrilled burgers (or maybe it just seemed that way because we were so hungry/excited). Our plates finally arrived, each one with a giant burger and an even bigger pile of shoestring fries. Unfortunately for me, I didn't realize that Roquefort cheese, which came on the burger, is a type of blue cheese - and I hate blue cheese with a passion. Luckily it was easy to scrape off, and I transferred it onto my cheese-loving friend's burger before proceeding to enjoy the rest of my burger. The meat was super tender - I had ordered it medium, but the pinkness actually looked more like a medium rare. It was overall very yummy, and I was so full by the end that I couldn't even finish the last few bites. I also loved the shoestring fries - they were salted and seasoned nicely, and the ketchup that it came with had some kind of tanginess to it that tasted a bit like sriracha.The restaurant itself is incredibly dim and also pretty cramped.

710,WxNqupdvjLfxUr5JhczipQ,Sean C.,2.0 star rating,"Don't believe The Spotted Pig hype.It is excellently casual despite the Manhattan address and seemed like a refreshing mix of ages and cultures... although it did help me answer the question of where all the white people are in the city. I'm sure there are casual star sightings here if that's an important factor.Wait quotes seem to be blown wildly out of proportion although that's probably better than the opposite. Arriving on an early Sunday evening, ""over an hour"" became 25 minutes and I was conveniently texted and told to return within 10 minutes. If the weather was nicer and one organized a shopping trip or even just a stroll through the cobblestone streets in the West Village it wouldn't even be that large of a factor. It is, however, cramped. In order to sit down I had to pull the table out and my back was uncomfortably against a row of potted plants. I'm not sure if they really are just that hard up for space (as the bathroom is also very cramped) or it's an intentional ploy to turn tables sooner.Unfortunately the burger with roquefort and shoestring fries ($21), the primary claim to fame, was... mostly unremarkable and entirely bereft of vegetables for balance. This might be how the Brits do it? I enjoyed it but I barely remember it in retrospect.I'm not sure why the queues form here. The coziness is offset by the close quarters, it is a bit loud, and the prices don't seem justified for the quality.

My husband had it with cheese and actually said it was too overpowering. I think the chefs must really have a heavy hand. So he was disappointed.

I had passed by early that morning and there was already a line for brunch, and the hoopla of April Bloomfields signless quaint restaurant appeared justified. The small place was packed but we scored a bar stool seat by a window opening to the street.  It was a great nook for two old friends to catch up over a bottle of wine. The oysters were brilliant (6 for 16) served with a pink vinegar sauce.   Service seemed astute to purchases, as the waitress seemed to drag out the delivery of our burger until we had finished our bottle and had ordered another glass.The burger was $20 and had blue cheese, it was good as you might imagine after having three glasses of wine.  Shoestring fries always frustrate me.  It's like disguising the sinfulness of the French fry, but without a lot of satisfaction, like eating air, or breadcrumbs.Spotted pig is a cute gastro pub with a small menu.   The menu seemed over priced and the dishes looked kind of boring, but we stuck to wine and ordered fairly successfully, more of a drinking place really with good snacks. This place reminds me of the Longman Eagle in Chicago.

I love cheese but I tend to like cheeses that are on the milder side, and the pungent taste of this cheese was not pleasant. I shared a burger with two friends and we couldn't finish it between the three of us. We also tried the chicken liver toast and that wasn't good either. It tasted off and kind of on the fishy side.

That being said, I soon learned that it is extremely popular and well regarded. Hello, Michelin star. Anyways, being from Philly where I am spoiled by superfluous craft beer at every corner, I was really hoping to find an awesome gastropub with a noteworthy draft list of unparalleled quality. The Spotted Pig came up in the Yelp search for this criteria. Well, unparalleled beer list it was not, however it was an exceptional gastropub with a decent beer selection and other great beverages to boot. I'm still trying to find that craft beer haven, Manhattan. Crossing my fingers that day will come. Woe, I've become such a beer snob-I blame you, Philly.The menu was spectacular, just what we were looking for. Notably, the specials list was entirely worth perusing and honestly I think the large majority of items we sampled this evening were off the specials list. The whole trout was perfectly cooked, and the ""jar o pickles"" were just what they were labeled to be - a bar snack. And a perfect one at that. We ended up sharing 2 bar snacks, an appetizer, and a main dish, which was just a perfect amount of food for two hungry foodies. Also to note, that bourbon cocktail was damn good. If you like a boozy, bourbon based cocktail, it's a must have.Our server was a cute, friendly hipster lady who was very informed and equally as likable. She helped us out with recommendations and was always around when we needed her. We were seated upstairs in what looked like the seductive couples corner, which ended up being a really cute spot for us. Well played, Spotted Pig designer. Great decor, great vibe all around.Overall, an hour and a half wait on a Friday night was entirely worth it. I'll definitely be back when I'm visiting my man in the Village.

It's just not in the upper echelon of burger/gastropubs I've frequented.

Unfortunately, the experience did not live up to my previous visit. We waited the expected 2 hours for a table-not a problem. However, once we arrived and had ordered, it took 45 minutes to receive our food-all of us had ordered burgers so did not expect it to take so long for something so simple. Furthermore, all of our burgers had been ordered medium, and they were all barely cooked rare! The food was also not warm. Mine especially, was cold. I spoke to the waiter, and he grudgingly took it away and I can only presume put it in a microwave, as I revived the same, half eaten burger back about 10 minutes later. It was slightly warmer. On raising the issues of the cold, undercooked burgers to the staff member, the only response I got was a mumbled ""sorry"" before he ran away.

We showed up for brunch this morning, just before the restaurant opened, and a crowd had already formed.  (Who are these people?  Foreign tourists who don't know better?)  When we entered the restaurant, we were told to wait at the bar, which lasted 10-15 minutes--despite the fact that many tables were available both downstairs and upstairs, and the host and receptionist were just standing around.  When we were seated, we were brought to a table so tiny and uncomfortable we had to request an alternate option.  Our new table was not much better: small stools that certainly didn't encourage us to relax or linger over our meal.  (My guest and I are both on the tall side, though neither of us particularly large.) I came to order the burger, which costs a jaw-dropping $22 (although that is perhaps reasonable compared to my $6 coffee).  I ordered the burger medium well-- an option the waitress did not present to me (and which my dining companion thought was later met with a snarky comment-- I wasn't sure if the comment was ill-intentioned).  Anyway, I had two requests for substitutions: 1) Since I don't eat bleu cheese, could I substitute a different kind of cheese?; and 2) Since the french fries are listed as the same price on the menu as broccoli rabe, could I please make a substitution?  The waitress was unwilling to accommodate EITHER request.  I was visibly irritated, and perhaps even commented that for the steep price, some flexibility would be nice, but the waitress made no effort whatsoever to make sure I had a positive experience and left happy.  It was a big F--k you.My burger patty came and my companion was generous enough to scrape some of his cheese (he ordered grilled cheese) onto my burger (lest you think the restaurant simply didn't have another kind of cheese to offer).  The burger was fine-- but not good enough to overcome the terrible taste left in my mouth by the snotty wait staff/restaurant directives.  (I didn't eat the fries but my companion reported they were dry and underwhelming.)  I left feeling totally disappointed and robbed of my hard-earned money.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

745,0cRX_C62oslWmZkuBwoYQg,Enzo M.,1.0 star rating,"Maybe our visit was a rare fluke in service and quality given the number of accolades for this restaurant.  Here are the bullet points:1) Waited for about five minutes to be greeted by the server and given our menu when he kept checking up on the table next to us.  2) Ordered our food then waited 45 minutes for the burger and the sizzling sisig.  Our server checked up on us just once at which point I asked for bread while waiting for our food.  We got hungry at the 25th minute.  Our guess is that they lost or forgot our order. 3) Food finally came but the burger and shoe string fries were room temperature.  Sisig was sizzling hot which means the burger was done first but was not kept inside a warmer. 4) Sisig had more pork fat than pork meat and made the dish extremely oily.  Fries were very salty and the burger came with a very generous spread of  Roquefort cheese which, upon tasting, reminded me of the burning sensation in my mouth when accidentally swallowing sea water. This review is of my own experience and is not meant to bash the restaurant. It should, however, be a reminder that consistency is the true measure of long-term success, especially for a place owned by a Michelin-rated chef.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"
746,LcItX7s72ukvUvhnqTNxAw,Benjamin M.,4.0 star rating,"I was visiting the city a couple weeks ago, and I decided to finally try the famous burger at The Spotted Pig. First of all, this place is tiny--even if you include the upstairs seating area, the entire restaurant was way smaller than I expected. No wonder the wait can be crazy long around dinner rush. I arrived early (around 5pm) with a friend, and we were seated immediately. When we left around 6:15pm, a line had already formed outside.We each ordered the burger with the shoestring fries and a pot of pickles. I appreciated the simplicity of the burger--it's just a grilled bun, beef, and Roquefort. All of supreme quality, of course. It was a most delightful combination. Indeed it tasted like a $21 burger. I thoroughly enjoyed the meal, though I struggled mightily with appropriate shoestring fry-eating etiquette.Admittedly, I also wanted to eat here because of the sheer number of celebs who frequent the Pig. Just Google ""Spotted Pig celebrities"" and you'll be blown away by how many folks are regulars.

Pot of pickles never arrived. Mussels starter was good. Rilette was your average rilette, nothing to rave about. Bread was burnt (when I say burnt I mean charred black on the outside) Haven't got a clue what the burger reviews are about. The Roquefort is 100% overpowering and there is nothing to balance the whole thing out as the whole thing exists out of a bun, burger and Roquefort. Yep, that's it. And no, that is not because of the outstanding quality of each of the ingredients.In all this I'm leaving what seems to be the chefs #1 ingredient out... salt, salt and salt. I'm not your low sodium food nagging customer, but the amount of salt used on the fries was just disgusting.Looking at other reviews and the overall esteem of the restaurant one could conclude that the other dishes could/should be better.

Given that, try to time it so that you arrive to put your name in well advance of when you intend to eat. The host will text you when you're table is ready, so you can leave and roam the area or run some quick errands. Once you clear the obstacle of getting seated, you'll be treated to a cozy, somewhat eclectic dining room and experience. I have not made much headway in trying a broad selection of menu items, but did order the Cuban sandwich during my visit. I have to say that it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The bread was toasted to perfection and coated in melted gruyere cheese and stuffed with prosciutto, pulled pork, pickles and mustard.  Each of the ingredients were fresh and flavorful, and I enjoyed every bite of my enormous sandwich.

There was one more beet at the bill - one single beer. The manager didn't agree to remove it. Is it really the kind if behavior/attitude you expect from a Michelin-Starred restaurant?

The brunch menu looked most appealing to me, so we decided to squeeze in brunch here on Saturday afternoon.We spent our early afternoon in Chelsea and then walked down to The Spotted Pig from there. The website had stated that the busiest meal times were the 7-9 dinner time period, so I figured that if we arrived at 2:30 for brunch ending at 3 that we wouldn't have any problems.Well, of course, we arrive at 2:30 and were told that the wait was about 30-40 minutes... but that the brunch menu would not be served by the time that we got seated. Are you kidding me? Instead, we found two bar stools and a shallow bar top attached to a column in the middle of the restaurant so that we could order brunch before the apparently-hard-stop brunch time of 3.We both got beers. My husband is a bit of a beer connoisseur but was unfamiliar with the Allagash White Belgian Style Wheat that I ordered. It was delicious! Their beer selection seemed quite impressive and right up our ally.Neither of us were extremely hungry so we decided to split the French Toast with Bananas and Bourbon Syrup. Ummm... WOW. Incredible! The whole dish was amazing... the fluffy french toast, the bourbon-flavored bananas... but the best part was this buttery-but-sour-creamy concoction. I was cautious at first thinking that it was only fluffy butter, but we quickly realized that this stuff needed to be slathered all over our dish because it was one of the best things we had ever eaten! And on that note.. the Spotted Pig definitely deserves to be my 300th review!

The food is simply average: too salty, too fatty, too unimaginative, too beige - too middle of the road English - to be anything beyond a notch above boring. It is not worth waiting any amount of time for.

784,-ACubwURqsDNTtTTYXS87Q,Emilio P.,3.0 star rating,"First time at the spotted pig during vaca from Miami with the family; After a long day (Saturday night), My daughter Yelps and digs up The Spotted Cow. It was open late and has tons of positive reviews. We were dressed pretty raggity (tshirts n jeans) we looked tired and wasted after having spent the day at a Bronx Stickball Tournament (yes stickball tournament; that's another story). We had Chicken Liver Toast, Deviled Eggs, Custard Parm, The Burger, Skate, Arctic Char, Skirt Steak, and the Creme Caramel desert.The Toast, Skate (daughter #1 eats healthy and raved about the Skate and toast), Parmesan Custard with Speck (a custard cheese with asparagus, (speck = better than prosciutto), in a bernaise was a very good combo). The Char was awesome. Deviled eggs had a nice spicy kick. The skirt steak was ordered medium well (it looked good) but I think I shoulda ordered it well done because mine was a bit chewy. The burger was a burger with roquefort cheese (We have had plenty of burgers. Daughter #2 says RokBrgr's truffle burger beats it). The Creme Caramel is a Flan but a really really good flan (not eggy not too sweet, and really smooth). BTW the Bronx Ale was smooth and for my taste it paired well with the Eggs and Parm.The guy at the door told us it was going to be an 1.5 to 2 hour wait but we were seated after about 45 min (he and the girl that seated us were helpful). And now the downsides. First the server wouldn't get in a group pic (not a big deal doesn't bother me I understand the not wanting to be in a strangers pic); Next the wife's Arctic Char was served with greens, I asked if we could substitute the greens (server said, no) I asked if we could have a side of asparagus/bernaise (server said, we don't do sides like that). I recognize when someone's trying to simply shoo me along, Maybe it was our appearance that dictated the treatment; All's forgiven.  Lastly and most important, I walked into the bathroom to wash my hands (remember we spent all day in the Bronx and rode the subway from midtown to the restaurant).  As I walked in, a guy wearing an apron (obviously worked in the kitchen) walked out of the stall and straight out the bathroom without washing his hands.The sign on the wall at the sinks reads the standard, ""employees must wash hands before returning to work"".  I brought this up to our server. She casually says, ""oh there's a sink in the kitchen too"".  Ok look; I don't know that there's a sink in the kitchen, I don't know if the guy went straight home afterwards, I don't know if the sink in the kitchen is the same sink used to wash produce, I don't know much about much but I'm absolutely certain that having employees who don't wash their hands is an image the restaurant wants to portray.The food was good but the entire time I ate, I couldn't get the thought of the hands not being washed out of my head. If I had any inclination of absolute filth, I would've walked out. But I took what I was told about the kitchen sink and ate a decent meal.  Bottom line spotted pig, if you're gonna charge me top dollar for a very good meal, have the courtesy of informing your kitchen staff that sometimes perception is reality.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

My best, most simple shot; GNUDI = hot pillows of pan-fried ricotta. Hello.     The Nicoise salad is great for a clean, light meal. The Cubano sandwich, which is available for lunch, is an out-of-this-world Cuban sandwich. The bread is toasted to crispy perfection. The best Cuban I have had.

They don't take reservations (which in some ways is nice, you don't have to plan far in advance to come here). The kitchen opens for dinner around 5 or 5:30, so that's when my group got there to put our names down for a table. We were seated by around 6:15 or so. In the meantime we enjoyed some drinks at their bar. The menu changes every day, so they really think through their menu. We had their chicken liver on toast, squid soup (more squid than soup), crispy pig ear salad, seared mackerel with sweet potato mash & house cured pancetta, grilled skirt steak with delicata squash, hazelnuts, and yogurt dressing, and wild striped bass with roasted cauliflower. They err on the ""rare"" side of medium-rare, just FYI. Our waitress let us know this beforehand, so we ordered the steak medium and it ended up being what we considered medium-rare. Everything was amazing, well-prepared, fresh, good service, etc. The Spotted pig is laid back, cozy, and very welcoming.

Just try to fight your way to the waiting list and then assertively make your way to the bar while you wait for a table. You may actually walk by the venue because the exterior is cluttered with several potted plants and a couple of benches (similar to the Breslin) and you might mistake it for a nursery. The interior is homey, with several framed pictures, decorative plates and curtains you'd find in a country B&B. You should also take note that from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the Pig only serves its bar menu. Thankfully the burger was available and that was the primary reason for my visit. The burger arrives with a heaping mound of shoe string fries tossed with rosemary. The fries look like they're about to swallow the burger like The Blob. The bun had an attractive sear pattern and the amount of roquefort was just right. The burger itself is a hefty patty of delicious beef. It was prepared perfectly and tasted great. Resist the urge to cut the burger in half because this is a burger that should be eaten with both hands. We had some apps as well. The deviled eggs were okay but the chicken liver toast is very good. It's not dry and crumbly and they spread it onto thick slices of crusty bread. It is not a dainty amount either. This is a nice way to introduce people to chicken liver.

I curiously anticipated this seemingly over priced ""vision"" in the hopes of something interesting and new as one might expect from the Big Apple. Well...ironically enough I quite literally got a big apple, no seriously an apple cut up for $16.

I went with my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday and he's been dying to try out the famous Chargrilled burger. As you may already know, this restaurant does not take any reservations. It was a rainy, Sunday evening and was told by the host that it'll be a 30 minute wait for a table. Not so bad huh? We went around the neighborhood to kill time and received a text from the restaurant saying that they will text me when my table was ready. Going to fast-track a bit -- we got seated, ordered the deviled eggs to start which was delicious. Then, the sheep's milk gnudi with sage and brown butter sauce which was heaven. Finally, got to the Chargrilled burger. Please note, that the burger wait is just as long as waiting for a table...no idea why! It's really a simple grilled, brioche bun burger with blue cheese and another sauce mixed in which I couldn't figure out and the burger itself. It didn't really need much and I was amazed how good it was. Unfortunately, my boyfriend received his burger with a burnt bottom bun. He stilled enjoyed the fries though! The atmosphere here is awesome and laid-back. There are two floors of this fabulous establishment and I would go back.

The menu was pretty simple and there wasn't that much burger selections as I thought (in fact, there's only ONE burger). I was under the impression that this place has knock out burger --- so I had always thought this was a burger place. They do have a good amount of cocktail selections though - in case you're wondering.I did end up ordering the burger with a request to make it medium well while my friend did the same but had the meat cooked in medium. We also ordered the devil egg. It took awhile for the food to come (even the devil eggs) - unsure why but for sure the anticipation rose to the roof. When the food came through I took my bite and then---------------------meh.....The devil egg was pretty average; I mean this is a dish that is not really likely to fail to begin with so you can only elevate by deciding what to mix with the yolk. In TSP's case, it was vinegar and mayo but that's about it (at least that was all I could tasted). It wasn't really much of a surprise. I've made devil eggs more interesting than this (it was still praised to this day by friends even though it was made 2 yrs ago... yah I like to brag).  But whatever, it was still pretty appetizing.Now the burger.....Umm... first of all, it was two buns + hamburger meat + blue cheese sauce and that was the end of the story. I guess you can argue a good burger doesn't need all that unnecessary decorations - yes but I like my burger to be a bit more diverse. On top of all that...it was pretty average. Overrated? I think so. I do give them the benefit of doubt as I didn't get to try anything else on the menu but given that people have been saying how good their burger is suppose to be, it was a bit of a let down. Will I go back? Only if I don't have to wait. Side note: My friend and I both thought our meat was more raw that what we imagined to be. If you are for one who likes your meat on the cooked side but not so cooked that the meat lose its tenderness, be sure to let your server know that you want it between medium well to well done.

This is where I have to award 4 stars only because of the lack of consistency and the somewhat clique feel to it.  Some of their employees are amazing and friendly and remember your name even if you go in once every two weeks like I do... But then some servers are really just not very attentive and aren't even familiar with their own menu.  The last server I had looked at me like I had two heads when I asked if they had poussin that night and insisted they never did, which was very troubling to hear as a big fan of this restaurant.  The hostess or host on duty, which seems to turn over frequently, is typically very unfriendly until they know that you know at least one employee, which is fine for me but not recommended for the restaurant owners I suppose.  It can kind of make people fee alienated and I've definitely heard murmurs from customers outside about how they felt unwelcome.  Strange that it's never been my experience but I have seen it first hand and I do recognize how difficult it is to manage the behavior of every single employee.

IT was a great way to start the final night of 2014.I came here Wednesday night with my GF, Sasha, who happens to be a vegetarian. Originally I intended to be nice and to order something that we could share, but as you will read later, I decided to go with the steak! We poured over the menu in excitement for about 20 minutes, feeling the giddy rush of finally getting to try this highly praised restaurant, trying to find the perfect permutation of  dishes that would satisfy us, and leave us with full bellies and happy mouths. I decided to get the Hanger Steak, Garlic Broccoli Rabe (the special), and the Port Collar cocktail. I had to get the hanger steak. It was delicious. Not terribly big, but very tasty. Lately I have been getting a string of subpar skirt steaks, especially when I order them my favorite way, Medium Rare. Chewy and lacking in flavor, I was questioning if I was ordering them cooked properly. I asked if Medium Rare was recommended for the hanger steak, and the waiter said that is the preferred way of serving this steak. My GF ordered Roll Mops, the Winter Market Salad, Beets & Greens, and the Sheep's Milk Gnudi, with a special cocktail similar to the Novo Mundo.The Roll Mops were good. Sasha loved them. This was my first time trying them. A tasty mackerel dish if you like mackerel. Reminded me of canned Mackerel plate at a Jewish brunch in NYC. The next dish to arrive was the salad. The salad was tangy, and slightly acidic, but with a salty/umami flavor reminiscent of sardines the mellowed it out. I usually don't like salt, but the flavors here balanced; however, we both noticed that the salad was on the salty side.The main courses came out next. My steak was perfectly cooked and delicious with sections of grilled squash, and kale chips. Sasha's Gnudi was also excellent. Rich cheese filling lightly coded in flower. Each bite was a bite of pasta filling without the pasta. While I loved this dish, Sasha thought it was overly rich. Also by this time, my cocktail was taking effect, and I was in a rather jovial mood.The Broccolo Rab was delicious. Soft and garlicy. The beets were grilled perfectly. They had a taste I had not experienced yet. I really enjoyed them prepared this way, but there was a strong earthy quality, giving me the strong inclination that this dish is meant to be shared amongst a diners.Sasha's cocktail was also tasty.We loved the Ambiance and the warm rustic feel. The food was very rich and heavy on the Umami flavor. Everything blended perfectly to form a rich unctuous flavor on my tongue and a full satisfied belly. Pub food with a flare.The Hamburgers and French fries looked amazing. I am salivating at the thought of it, and it is on a short list of places to come back to to try. If the Hamburger and fries are anywhere near as good as they look, this will be a go to spot for a reasonable meal with a great ambiance. I really enjoyed my meal here. All in all the bill came out to be 200 dollars for the two of us, on a special occasion. I left feeling happy and that the price was well worth it.We also tried the Banna dish for desert. Yummy!!Side note, My gf was not nearly as enamored of this place as I was. She really loved the ambiance and the feel of the place, but the food was not as exciting to her as it was for me. I love strong Umami flavors and rich food. If you want something more delicate and lighter in fare, you might be disappointed.

My visit to Spotted Pig was probably one of the worst dining experiences ever. While waiting to be seated we had to ask 3 times to get drinks. If that didn't clue us in, perhaps the ill fitting Scottish bagpipe visit should have. What's up with that?! This place is suffering from an identity crisis. Once we were seated and began ordering my husband remembered his credit card was left with the bartender upstairs. In the middle of taking our order, the server stopped and went to get it, and didn't come back for about 10 minutes- without the card. Only after ordering did we discover a list of specials written on a board half way across the restaurant which were never mentioned to us. After waiting over an hour for our food (medium burgers) our server gave back a very snotty response when we finally inquired about its status. Upon delivery no apology or comment was offered, nor was any inquiry into our satisfaction after we'd had a chance to try it. We both received blood rare, completely tasteless burgers (except for the heaping pile of overbearing Roquefort cheese). Neither of us touched more than a bite of our food, but that didn't stop our indifferent server (Alexis, according to our receipt) from delivering our overpriced bill. I'm sure it was obvious we were not happy. If we could have held our servers attention long enough to let him know we were unhappy, we would have. By that time we just wanted to get out of there. I usually take every experience for what it is, but this is one where I'd love the 2.5 hours of my life (and $120) back!!! There are too many great options on the West Village.

You probably have read his poetry about haggis, but I'm sure you've sung ""Auld Lang Syne"".Well, last night was Burns's Night and The Spotted Pig threw quite the Scottish bash! The male servers were decked out in kilts, they'd hired a bagpiper to play a few tunes every 30 minutes or so, and the specials featured Scottish delicacies, such as haggis.Unable to stomach the stomach (pun totally intended), we stuck to the normal menu and ordered:-Marinated olives-Deviled eggs-Burger & rosemary fries-Ricotta gnudi, brown butter and fried sage-Market salad-Brussels sprouts with pancetta -Carrots with thymeWe shared all the food and were all really impressed with the gnudi (like soft pillows or clouds), the deviled eggs (unexpectedly vinegary and spicy), the fries, and the roasted vegetables.

The food was a bit below average - I've had better at non-Michelin rated restaurants. Gnudi was salty and shoestring fries had too many onions. However, their Spotted Pig Bitter beer was the saving grace and I highly recommend it. The ambiance was great - it makes the soul feel warm. Like, if there were a blizzard outside, it would be an ideal place to be snowed in. Dim lighting, candles, wood - it reminds me of Freeman's but a half step lower.

Good burger, but not the best as many seem to think. I ordered medium rare, and for medium well at first, but they got that fixed pronto. A+ for that. Very tasty, I liked the bleu cheese, but given the size and the fact it was medium rare, I was shocked at the lack of juiciness. Maybe I'm spoiled from the days of Ray's Hellburger outside of DC, but not enough juice, and not enough flavor in the patty itself to be among the best. The fries were excellent.

Everest on a plate, just unnecessarily massive, yet utterly outstanding.  These fries were thin and crispy, salty and the perfect crunchy accessory to that amazing burger.  The Chicken Stew was quite sophisticated as well, and definitely very hearty.  The chicken was really tender and we really enjoyed the flavor profile of the dish.  Dessert was The Flourless Chocolate Cake as well as the Hazelnut Ice Cream with Shortbread cookies.  I wouldn't recommend the cake, it was extremely dense and rich, and way too much dessert after such a heavy meal.  On the other hand, the delectable ice cream along with the crunchy shortbread cookies, was a nice way to cap off our impressive meal.Too bad our friends visiting from Cali couldn't hack another burger night since that's all they had been eating before coming to New York, because I was planning to take them here.  Instead they went with pizza (which is never a bad idea in NYC), but I tell you, I really wanted them to try The Spotted Pig and have something else to really brag about when they made their way back to the west coast.  Next time, I'll get them and so will TSP.   The Spotted Pig delivers incredibly hearty, and tasty food, in a cozy and chilled out setting.  One dinner here is a meal you will not likely forget, and for all the best reasons imaginable.  Amazing food, great service, fun atmosphere... did I mention amazing food?  Mmm that burger, Lord have mercy!!!",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

However, the arrogance of the man behind the maitre d' stand, who I think is called Liam, was oddly dismissive and rude. I suppose you can treat your customers with disdain when you have a waiting list for days, but after several great meals there, it became apparent that this man represents the enterprise as a whole. With my party of good natured relaxed gents, I waited almost 90 minutes for the table we requested. I inquired about progress, and I was told we were on the waiting list for a lower total number than we had given.  When I pointed out that they had it down wrong, the host (Liam?) laughed and said I was wrong. At this point, we were all getting cranky, having been waiting for what seemed an excessively long time. He became increasingly sarcastic and combative, insisting that we were in the wrong. Regardless of whose version of the facts was correct, I'm baffled by anyone who is so blatantly rude - and who, after 90 minutes wait time, has the bad form to try and make us the bad guys instead of simply apologizing and trying to make it right. We only wanted to patronize the restaurant.Needless to say, we left as a group and found a wonderfully kind and hospitable restaurant around the corner (The Left Bank.)I'm sad that I can no longer count The Spotted Pig among my go-to restaurants.

Sure, the burger was okay, but it was definitely not in my NYC top 20. The meat was tender and tasty enough as was the bun, but the Roquefort Cheese was a bit overpowering. Plus, I asked the waiter for lettuce and tomato b/c I generally enjoy them on my burger... and he said, ""We don't do that."" Well, they certainly have salad on their menu, so how big a deal would it have been to send out some leafy accoutrements?!?! A bit of a crazy policy, IMHO. As for the shoestring fries that are served with the burger, they are tasty... but they're hard to dip into ketchup making them more of a mess than anything else. Again, IMHO, the fries are just all hype. [SPECIAL NOTE: The food runner mixed up the ""medium rare"" burgers with the ""medium"" burgers when he was passing them out to our table, so be sure to double check before you bit down!]The atmosphere at Spotted Pig is eclectic and interesting and is probably comfortable most nights...however, on the night we visited, it was hot and humid outside and the air conditioner in the restaurant was broken.

I even signed up for Yelp just to tell y'all about it!I had only heard great things about the place and had had it on my to-visit restaurant list for months, waiting for the proper occasion to check it out: celebrating my anniversary with my boyfriend was one such event.We knew there would be a long wait going into it, so we showed up on the earlier side to get our names on the list. We were told two hours (fine, it was Friday night) and that if we didn't arrive within ten minutes of being contacted, our spot would be given up. Fine.We popped off to a nearby watering hole for just about two hours when I got the text. Knowing that we could lose our spot if we delayed, we chugged the rest of our beers and headed over.Once there, our boisterous host--who would become the ""star"" of this whole production--informed us that our table would be ready ""soon."" I mean, sure, another couple minutes, whatever.At this establishment, apparently ""soon"" is applied liberally.After ten minutes the host noticed that we were whispering to each other and were trying to make eye contact--and she immediately engaged her defenses, despite us never saying anything to her, telling us to ""settle down boys.""Seriously? ""Settle down""? Aside from the condescending usage of ""boys,"" what exactly were we doing? Having a quiet, private discussion about how we had finished our beers and rushed over so we wouldn't lose our spot, only then made to inexplicably wait ten more minutes?Another ten minutes passed and were again told to ""keep calm,"" our gracious host offering us two beers ""on me"" (except no, they're on the restaurant), helping make up for the fact that we had been waiting almost 2.5 hours at that point. This additional wait was supposedly because the host was looking for a more accommodating table for my tall boyfriend (he is over 6' but not in an extreme way)--something neither of us had ever experienced before and something we definitely didn't ask for. The host gave another couple--who had showed up after us--a table because my boyfriend was ""too tall"" and she was ""trying to be polite."" Again, we did not request some kind of special ""tall person"" table.When we did finally get the ""best table in the house"" (according to the host), it was a corner table that was arguably the worst option for two tall people--our knees were knocking together the entire time. Normally who cares! But we were made to wait an extra 25 minutes because allegedly we were being given a better table specifically for tall people.We were so hungry at this point we skipped another round of drinks and went straight for the burgers, medium-rare.When they arrived, there was nothing ""medium"" about them; in fact, they were as mushy as a baby's nose (you know, before they've got cartilage in there) and complemented by fries so thin they were practically crushed beneath their own weight.We made it through about half of our burgers before giving up (I mean, I'm not trying to get food poisoning on my anniversary). Our server (who was very nice, in stark contrast to the host) asked whether everything had not been to our liking. We told her it hadn't, but we just wanted the check. It'd been nearly a four-hour affair by then, and neither of us was interested in extending it any further.After paying, the host asked how we liked our meal, and I said it was ""terrible actually, and we're never coming back!"" to which she replied, ""Oh, that's too bad""--but I think we all knew it wasn't.I can count the number of times I've been to a restaurant so well-regarded and yet been so let down on one hand.

They don't take reservations, but since we got there right before they opened (and maybe because ""blizzard Nemo"" was upon us, we were seated pretty quickly. Our server was great - very fun and informative. A big pet peeve of mine is when you ask a server what the best things on the menu are and he or she replies, ""everything is good."" That is the lamest answer ever and most likely means that they have never tried anything on the menu. But when we posed the question to our server, he responded back quickly and confidently with his top menu favorites (which indicated that he most likely had actually tried the dishes). Some of us went with his suggestions and were not at all disappointed. The gnudi were fresh and amazing - perfect on a cold, rainy day and actually very elegantly prepared. My husband decided to try the mackerel and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. A couple of our friends got the grilled cheese and it was also good. The deviled eggs, while small in portion, were amazingly good (and spicy).  Loved the atmosphere and decor of the place. It felt so warm and homey. And the best thing EVER - the warm, spiced wine.

I arrived around 6:40pm, and the wait was only 20-30 minutes for the table. The place is small, well at least on the main floor, but it does open up a bit upstairs. However, i still think overall the restaurant is small and may be as small as Minetta Tavern. I know i do mention that sometimes great things come in small packages, and the Spotted Pig is no exception.For apps, we shared Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi with Basil Pesto and Crispy Pig's Ear Salad with Lemon Caper Dressing. The Ricotta Gnudi was made so delicately. It was a pretty refined dish for the restaurant. The pesto was fresh tasting, but it was a bit overpowering. I had to scoop off some of the pesto, so the freshly made ricotta could be the star of the plate. Overall, the Ricotta Gnudi was mildly salty and sweet, and it wasn't too heavy at all. The Crispy pig ear salad was bananas. The crispy pig ears were literally pig ears; they didn't even bother to trim the ears into small slices. The pork was perfectly deep fried, It was crispy on the outside, but when you bite into it, the juices of the melted fat just explode. The pig ears are salty and the tangy lemon dressing with mixed greens really complement the ears. The salad had endives as well as other bitter veggies, so the dish had bitterness, tang, saltiness, and multiple levels of texture. For entrees, my friend got the famous Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort & Shoestrings. I got the Pork Sausage special.  The burger was flavorful and juicy, even cooked to medium. The bun had great grill marks and it was buttery and toasted to perfection. The burger paired with the roquefort cheese was a perfect marriage. The shoestring fries were crispy and seasoned to perfection. None of the fries tasted soggy. The sausages ...i believe had no casings. I was able to cut into the sausage like it was melted butter. The sausage was also topped with shredded fried pig ears, so that was great too.

The pork belly was crispy so that was an interesting textural spin on the dish, but I love pork belly and so I expected a lot from it, and I've had better.

Scoring a Michelin Star is no small accomplishment in this town and I've been wanting to try this little corner restaurant in the West Village for a while to try the legendary burger. I've walked by dozens of times while returning from long runs along the West Side Highway, but in those moments I am rarely in the mood for a blue cheese-coated burger on a fluffy bun with a pile of shoestring fries, so my rendezvous with the eclectically decorated, ever-happening Spotted Pig was put on hold for too long. Yesterday, I am happy to say that the wait ended and I was not disappointed.I went during the frantic Sunday brunch hour fully expecting throngs of derby shoe-wearing, Ray Ban-donning, cuffed Bonobos-rocking 20-30 somethings standing around waiting for a coveted table. Either it was an off day, or the Spotted Pig just isn't a brunch hotspot, but I was able to saddle up to the bar, no problem. The pig theme is in full effect here. The vibe is fun, the decor is kitschy, the bartender and hostess were friendly and the food came out fast.As for the burger. Pretty damn good. $21 good? Maybe. Maybe not. If you don't love strong Roquefort blue cheese, it's not a good call for you. But the toasted bun and rosemary shoestring fries made it pretty special.

I literally had to wipe the cheese off the burger patty just to consume it and even then, some residual cheese on the bun ruined the experience for me. It's very possible the majority of the reviews were written by people who love strong cheese...or people who have never set foot in amazing burger places like Ottomanelli's...;) Also, with no other toppings besides that horrendous cheese, $21 is ridiculous for one burger, ESPECIALLY if it lacks bacon!The shoestring fries...are properly named. The problem is, they're so thin, I could barely taste the flavor on them. Props for cooking the fries with real chunks of garlic, though.I did enjoy their deviled eggs and the chicken liver pate, however. I am sure their other appetizers are equally great...I am just disappointed that the burger that's been raved about is actually not a big deal at all. The appetizers and the eclectic, eye-catching pork-centered decor were the saving graces  that gave this place a solid 3. That ...and our hot waiter with a sexy accent .

But all good restaurant in this neighborhood are like this. It's just a matter if the food is worth the wait at the end of the day.

So even though the place is big (2-levels, bathroom on both floors), it's still packed all the time. - Service: is quick, good and welcoming. - Burger: it's good by all means.

To be honest, after 2 hour's waiting time and some drinks, I was more frustrated than excited to try out this place.

The eggs were creamy and light.  The pickled vegetables were great, especially with our entree (yelp.com/biz_photos/3LNc…).  The pig's ear was tender with a nice, crispy coating that remained crunchy even though the salad was dressed (yelp.com/biz_photos/3LNc…).  It paired well with the salad of arugula and parsley.  Of all our starters, this was definitely my favorite.For our entrees we all chose the burger with Roquefort cheese and shoestring fries (yelp.com/biz_photos/3LNc…).  Over half the plate was filled with those ultra thin and super crispy fries sprinkled throughout with rosemary.  The fries were good, but oversalted.  The burger was outstanding.  It is served plain, with no vegetables, garnishes or condiments, as it didn't need any.  I saw that there were only bottles of ketchup at the service station, presumably for the fries.  The burger was thick and juicy and a perfect medium rare.  The bun was firm enough to hold up until the last bite without breaking apart or becoming a soggy mess.  The cheese, melted on top of the patty, had just enough tangy flavor to wave hello without taking over the lively convesation going on within the bun; the beef was clearly the star.  This was truly one of the best hamburgers I've ever had, and I don't make that statement lightly.  The pickled vegetables served as a nice break from the richness of the meat.  A pint of the local Bronx Brewery pale ale was the perfect beverage to round out this meal.All of the seats are stools.  I think this discourages people from hanging around too long, which is fine by me and all the other people waiting patiently for one of their coveted tables. Heh.  They don't take reservations so if you want to avoid a long wait come really early or really late.  It's really dark inside and the noise level is really high, but not in a bad way.  The vibe is pretty mellow and seems like the perfect spot for meeting up with friends and having a great time over a pint or two.  I love the pig-themed decor throughout.  The Spotted Pig clearly respects the pig (and the cow) and allows their very fresh ingredients to shine.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

923,GBuQamjjQyrUDJEBE3uVLQ,Stephen S.,1.0 star rating,"I will try and make this review as straight forward as possible. I'm disappointed my first review is a negative one but I feel it is important to describe my experience in hopes the restaurant (and specifically the chef) realize how important it is to keep the customer first.I went to the Spotted Pig with a visiting friend to enjoy a casual dinner. We opted to sit at the bar to avoid a long wait. The bartender was friendly. We ordered beers and burgers. I'll be the first to admit I ordered the burger without taking notice of the Roquefort cheese. When the burger came (about double the time this order should take) I realized my mistake and politely asked for a substitution. Any other cheese. To avoid the hassle of sending it back I asked to bring a slice of whatever was available. The bartender notified me that in her 12 years of working there - no substitutions had been made by the chef. I politely asked for at least a slice of tomato. She asked if I wanted to speak to a manager. When the manager arrived, he asked if there was a problem. I conveyed that there was no problem and that I had not realized the cheese on the burger and was looking for something to eat the burger with beyond just a bun and meat (with the cheese already scratched off) to avoid wasting perfectly good food and to meet them halfway. This was refused and I requested the menu for another selection. No other meal seemed particularly appetizing to me. I got the check and was disappointed to leave hungry.This is inexcusable. The customer is always right. I was not charged for the burger (I half expected an issue with this since the overlook was fully my mistake) but to not accommodate a customer's request is beyond comprehendible. I will never return to the Spotted Pig. I respect the desire of a chef to craft a dish how he/she would like (and enjoy success from many who have ordered despite reading the many reviews that expressed a valuation that deemed it not worth the wait and a general consensus that the cheese is too overpowering), but to forget that it is the customer who is the one who is left to enjoy the meal is offensive.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I love how the bun is slightly wider than the diameter of the patty, so I never have to deal with an inevitably imbalanced bun-to-meat ratio after a few bites. I love how the bun is thick enough to hold up to the juicy burger, but still soft enough to be oh-so-fluffy. I love how the fries are all crisp and no mushy fluff and flavored with rosemary and garlic crisps.

Came back recently for lunch because I heard and read that they have a burger that's pretty amazing. The place wasn't too crowded, so I thought I'd give it another chance. Went upstairs and sat at the bar. The bartender was pleasant. I ordered the Charbroiled burger with Roquefort cheese and shoestring potatoes. That burger was damn good.

936,WWptvNpAv0gs_m7aRDcsPQ,Alison H.,5.0 star rating,"With over 1,200 reviews the word about the spotted pig has certainly spread. The reviews have people trekking down or across town to check it out. The come here, they eat the burger, leave, then write their review. Many are not absolutely impressed. Who wants to wait over an hour sometimes two, pay $20 for a burger and eat it jammed in the corner on a baby stool? .........Well I do.  Yelp brought me to the spotted pig for the first time a couple years ago, I got a burger and those were my thoughts about it after. I posted a 3 star review and moved on with my life.  Now being back over a dozen times I must say that one visit and one burger for that matter is not nearly enough to from a solid opinion on this establishment. I have concluded that April Bloomfield is a genius and the Spotted Pig is my favorite restaurant downtown period. Her food it outstanding, I've eaten many things from the menu and many that have come up as specials. Michelin ratings are broken down by food, service and comfort. ( I think )  The comfort covers décor and the literal meaning of comfort. The spotted pig décor consists of ceramic pigs. The tables are super small close together and lined with paper the seating is almost all stools. The servers are on their game, they are often tattooed, pierced and without sleeves. No ties here folks. So this leaves one to deduce that her food carried her to the Michelin rating. If you have been once, go again, if you haven't been yet go and order more than a burger. Get there at 5 and be seated at 5:30 get there at 5:30 and be seated at 6:30 get there at 6 and be seated at 8.

I've had better for a cheaper price at Flat Top, Corner Bistro, etc. But I must say I really enjoyed the Shoestring Fries that were served on the side. In sum, I don't think this place is worth waiting for 2-3 hours. There are so many cheaper, superior food options in the neighborhood that doesn't require such a crazy wait.

In a direct comparison (and because $20+ burgers need to be compared) of Minetta Tavern's Black Label burger and Spotted Pig burger- Spotted Pig loses by a long shot. Minetta Tavern I would eat over and over and it was decadent and freaking unbelievably good- but Spotted Pig, I just wasn't impressed with any of the flavor and the toppings were sparse and kinda blah.

Clearly, I am not covering much new ground here. However, Spotted Pig *is* one of my favorite restaurants in the West Village, and is one of many reasons that I truly enjoy living in this neighborhood.The Spotted Pig has an amazing ambiance as you enter the old brick townhouse. Always warm, always cozy, always buzzing with people... Always busy. Always... an hour+ wait for brunch.... and Thursday nights... and Saturday nights... and always.. except that one time we went at 6:30pm on a Sunday night. But no matter! The most successful approach that I've had is to manage my expectations. If I have a large lunch, I don't mind eating at 10pm. If I make this one place the majority of my Saturday night, I can spend an hour drinking French Chardonnay at the bar. So then if the table is available after only 20 minutes of waiting..? Hooray! Plan ahead, and you'll do just fine.On to the food. I had no idea what a ""devil-on-horseback"" was, so we ordered some. They are bacon-wrapped dates, and they are seriously tasty little morsels. Savory, sweet, salty, scrumptious. We usually get a side of greens, which are always cooked perfectly, and usually with cheese, bacon, etc.., some sort of fat in it to offset the healthy-factor. I almost always get the ricotta gnudi with sage/brown butter, just because I love those little round pillows of cheese so much. I never get the burger because I don't like roquefort, but my boyfriend can vouch for its quality. It also comes with a heaping pile of shoestring fries, which I have tried, and they are consistently good.For brunch, I have tried the grilled cheese with onion marmalade. Now maybe it was because it was my first brunch back in the US after being in Japan for 2 weeks, eating fish, vegetables, and forgetting about cheese (well as much as possible), but thisssss sandwichhhhh was HEAVY. It sat on my stomach like a brick. Just know that before ordering.... that this is one. serious. grilled cheese sandwich.

Friendly, filled with mouth-watering delicious eats, and just seemingly happy to be there.We were cruising for some late night eats and drinks, and The Spotted Pig heeded our needs. A decent beer list (with unfortunateely just a handful of taps) with a very well assembled burger (thick patty with just the right amount of roquefort on toasted brioche) all within a warm and cozy pig ornament filled room did make for excellent late night dining. Only quibble is the cost. $6 garnered us a small petri dish of pickled vegetables (which is not what one imagines when ordering a ""pot of pickles""). And while that burger was certainly worth $21 in that particular time of need, this would not be the case on any given day. All in all, a tentatively strong thumbs up.

The egg was good but not great.I ordered the burger and it was juicy and cooked as I ordered it (medium). The cheese that came on the burger was very salty, and the burger itself doesn't need condiments added to it. The bun was hearty enough for the meat. It was a good burger but not so memorable that I would say it is the best ever. The fries were not crunchy enough for me but had fried rosemary and garlic mixed in, which added a nice flavor.My wife got the Cubano sandwich. The pork was tender, and the cheese and jalapeños were great with the meat. The bread was crunchy and warm. The arugula salad had a little too much lemon and salt.The decor was kitschy with a lot of pig paraphernalia on the shelves and walls.

974,25Lz9M4lEU9rdvtIkkLhSQ,Adam G.,2.0 star rating,"The Spotted pig is a very trendy and popular West Village haunt with all the trappings and decor of the cliched ""local"" from any of the British Isles.  However, the experience is more theme restaurant chain than small local eatery.Tables are uncomfortably close together, with hostesses consistently cramming 4 into a table that should only have 3, ensuring that one or two people in a party are sitting in the lap of the people at the next table.  Asking for something with more space is met with scowls and exasperated sighs of ""why are you being difficult just sit where i put you and shut up.""The wait staff are more pleasant, even jovial.  The camaraderie of the wait, bus and bar staff carries over nicely to their interactions with the guests.  Speaking of the bar, well stocked with competent bar tenders.  Even though ours was a but stumped by a drink he was not familiar with, he recovered well and with aplomb.The menu is decent, though perhaps does not represent the food particularly well.  The burger was somewhat overdone, and a bit more greasy than juicy.  This was compounded by the Mt. St. Helens of shoe string fries piled on top, which released their oil into the bun between the kitchen and the table.  The frittata was decently cooked, though either the ricotta cheese was too overpowering or the egg and broccoli rabe were too under seasoned, but only one of them was flavourful.The hash is rather a disaster.  It is primarily roasted and sautéed potatoes with a smattering of herbs and a vague smear of corned beef.  The poached eggs were horribly overcooked, the white rubbery and the yolks mostly set, and were only tepid.One bright note is definitely the beets and greens side dish.  The roasted beets were sweet, succulent, and thankfully, not overcooked.In all, this seems more a tourist trap than anything, and certainly not worth the hassle of the disgruntled hostesses, cramped seating, and lacklustre cuisine.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Burger is MASSIVE. So is the bun. It's meat, cheese, bun.   - Personally, I felt the meat could have used more seasoning and the patty could have been smaller (I don't eat a lot of meat so I may be biased, however my husband who does had the same comment)- Way too much bread- Too much cheese! It was a very salty intense cheese (which I usually love) but it overpowered the burger2. Shoestring fries with fried garlic chips and fried rosemary were awesome but over salted. I did eat pretty much of all them. And would do so again if I went back. Cocktails were tasty but standard pricing for the area. Deviled eggs: awesome. You will wait half your lifetime for a table, but if you can snag a seat at the bar, go for it. The staff, while busy, was lovely- especially the bartender.

There was no one to greet us, Maitre de was standing next to us and completely ignored us. My husband was here before so he just took the lead and lead us upstairs. The ambience seemed really nice at first but what comes next was completely unnecessary and disgusting. A rather large garbage been filled with leftover food would be emptied inches away from tables and dragged down the stairs about every 15 minutes. No one carred to even close the garbage bag as it was dragged through the middle of the dining room. Does this place have a manager?? Inexcusable!!!Moving on and trying to forget the uncomfortable and the ambience was quite nice. Cozy and comfortable with nice decor and young business crowd. We are in early 30s and the crowd reminded us of what one might find in the meat packing district. Drinks were good but PRICEY. We got a table 45 minutes later but no big deal, we live in NY and are used to it.Food came about an hour later. The dishes had a nice appeal to it, that is until we tried it. All 3 of our dishes (2x burgers and 1x fish) were EXTREMELY SALTY. I could barely finish my burger. Shoe string fries were interesting at first but flavor was just ok, nothing to write home about. They were hard to eat with a fork and too small to pick up with fingers. Putting the saltiness aside and the burger and fish flavor was average. Sorry Pig but when I order your ""famous"" burger and with a premium price tag of $20 I expect to be impressed! Chefs, I don't care how many stars you have but if you don't try the food you're serving to your guests then you shouldn't be running a kitchen !! Restaurant is NOT CLEAN. Bathroom is dirty and there was no soap in the bathroom. (Yuk!)They forgot to bring my ordered drink so I had to drink water instead but it's not a big deal. The three of us must have drank a gallon of water after that dinner. We mentioned to our server the saltiness of our food but he seemed rather occupied with something more important as his only reply was ""oh? really?"". And then he wondered of.I gave it two stars because of nice decor and ambience. Food, service and cleanliness deserve a one star!There are just too many better and nicer restaurants in West Village. I would not recommend this place to anyone nor would I go back. There were other posts with similar issues so I'm hopping this review and others like it will either: a) provide some good feedback to the management so proper actions can be taken to fix the problem or b) educate decent folks to avoid this place and go somewhere better",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

No big deal.. It's NY on a Friday night. We found a pole with a shelf on it near the bar and crammed in. The place was packed with local hipsters. After sitting there awhile we finally waved down a waitress. She said she would take our order. I ordered a sprite and my friends ordered a Vodka Press.. Neither our waitress Rebecca or the bartender new how to make.. We explained vodka, soda, sprite, and a lime. I would have thought a bar of this standard would have known how to make one. We were served vodka and soda with lime. Not what we ordered! Rebecca our waitress never came back to check on us so we could get the drinks fixed. We sat there for 50 min waiting on our burger. Which turned out to be dry.. Dry meat, dry bread.. I finally saw Rebecca again and tapped her on the shoulder to get her attention. She never turned around and just shook her head ""no""... Then I thought maybe she was thinking I was a fellow waiter and she was busy. Then when she bent down to get something out of a small fridge I said ""excuse me.. When you have time could I get more sprite"".. She stood up and started to walk off. Then I yelled out ""excuse me could I..,,"" she cut me off and yelled in a snarky tone ""I heard you""... Then I eventually got a drink refill. After getting the bill I really struggled with leaving a tip.. She didn't deserve one at all. However I am in a tipping industry myself and I know everyone has a bad day. I left $10.. I would like to give her some advise: if you can't handle the stress of working in a bar maybe you shouldn't be a waitress. Also being nice to people that you rely on to give you a tip is probably a good idea. She and the other staff had time to stand at the wait station and bar and complain about things (I overheard their conversation) but yet couldn't take care of the customers because they were just too ""busy"".. The best thing about this place was the food runner that brought our food out and the fries. We ordered a devil egg but didn't get it or maybe we could have commented on that.

I love April Bloomfield's cooking and have her cookbook, which is not for the everyday (heavy cream in everything!). We came in to the Pig around 11:00 on a Thursday, knowing there were no reservations. We only waited about 20 minutes so it wasn't bad. The reason this place is not 5 stars to me is it is sooooo small. The tables don't even have proper chairs but stools, like some sort of hobbit restaurant. Once you are sitting down you and your neighbors will be well acquainted. It is just so distractingly small that you can't fully relax and enjoy yourself (even with plenty of libations on board). The food, was delicious as expected. The highlight of the night and of my life was the sweet corn soup. Ecstasy in a bowl, my friends. We also got a salad and variety of vegetable sides and hubby got some boring steak dish. Everything was so good. Service was nice too, one of my drinks was taking a little long to get to the table and the waitress comped it- a nice touch. I would love to come back here. Be prepared to wait- it is very small and popular and there are no reservations so don't be whiny when you get there and have 30 minutes or more. It is worth it and the cramped quarters, but a little elbow room and some actual chairs would really go a long way.Just wanted to add we've since been back here. The food and drink all around just as excellent.

The burger was cooked just right (medium) so it was juicy but I didn't enjoy it as much because it had blue cheese instead of American or Swiss. I didn't read the description so it was my fault . If I had known there was blue cheese, I wouldnt have gotten it. Blue cheese has a very very strong taste; it overpowered my burger. I tried scraping it off and put more ketchup; failed. Well, at least I had good fries.Service was slow but very courteous. This is a popular place so I'm glad I tried it. I heard their muscle were good, maybe I should've tried that.

WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TONIGHT; ALL WEEK LONG YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO CHECK OUT THE SPOTTED PIG."" After 20 minutes of laying down I got dressed quickly and we were ready to go. I had decided to drive into the city from Astoria since the place was all the way on the Westside. Finding parking in this area was truly a mentally and physically challenging task in itself. After looking for parking for 45 minutes we were starving and walked over to the Spotted Pig at 8pm. Upon arrival to the Spotted Pig I then met our hostess or host? Sebastian. I nick named him Sebastian due to this Diesel Short Short Jeans, poor attitude and poor customer service skills. I do not know what his real name is but Sebastian seemed fitting for him.  Sebastian told us it would be a 90 minute wait for a table. We figured we were already here. Why not? We heard great things. I put my name down; he took my number and said he would call me. We walked around the city for a little bit and then stopped by a bar called the Dublin Pub I believe.  We got a couple drinks and then headed back to the Spotted Pig. We were hoping that the wait time was better.At 9pm we were greeted by Sebastian again. He informed us that it would be another 30-45 minutes for a table. His hands were flailing around and I let my girlfriend handle the situation. I was irritated enough already and do not do well in those types of situations. The bar and place were packed!  Every step we went people were bumping into us. Waiters would walk by with food and we were starving. Luckily I bumped into someone I knew at the bar that was also waiting hours for a table. My girlfriend would walk over to Sebastian every 20 minutes or so hoping for some good news. Sebastian was quite indifferent and did not seem to care that we were waiting for 2 hours for a cheese burger.  He was unapologetic and was doing an awful job.We FINALLY got seated at around 10:15-10:30pm. Yes we actually had to wait around 2  1/2 hours for a table!  The quarters were pretty close and we were basically sitting on top of the people next to us. There were a lot of tourists and asshole hipsters there giving us dirty looks. I am born and raised in New York City and do not care about you. We got our food at around 10:45pm. We got an order of deviled eggs and chicken liver toast for appetizers which were banging. We both ordered the burger that everyone ranted and raved about. I wasn't really impressed with the burger.  It was just a normal burger; the cheese was a bit too strong. The shoe string fries were normal fries you can get at Outback. My girlfriend said she would have preferred a burger from FIVE GUYS or SHAKE SHACK instead and I agreed with her. Over all the food was pretty good but the service and wait time were PUTRID. Sebastian needs a reality check and needs to purchase a pair of pants. I think it's safe to say that all the employees there need one (everyone else was wearing pants). If you want to get a sick burger go to the OLD HOMESTEAD. The Kobe burger is sick. It is expensive but you will get your money's worth and get GREAT service. You also won't probably wait 2  1/2 hours to be seated. I finally got home at 12:30am. 6 hours earlier I wish I would have ordered a burger from the Bel-Aire Diner and relaxed in my apartment in my basketball shorts for the rest of the evening.CHECK YOURSELF BEFORE YOU WRECK YOURSELF SPOTTED PIG!

A stroll around the neighborhood, a necklace and pair of rain boots at Marc Jacobs later and it's already time to be seated. We're lead upstairs, into a little alcove of a room for no more than eight people. Our server is warm and friendly, as is everyone that helps him out. We order various teas and coffees so extra hands were necessary to swoop them all in at the same time. We shared a salad of sunchokes, sunflower seeds, escarole and a goat cheese (I think?). It was a normal plate but we decided on it for an appetizer and woah, it got us very excited for whatever was to come. Not only had we never tried sunchokes before, adding to the excitement, but the salad as a whole  was like none other. There was a lemony dressing with the cheese so soft and getting into ever delicious bite. My main might just be the best hamburger and fries I've ever had. How could I not order that after all of the hoopla I've heard? Arriving on a shiny grilled bun along with a whole haystack of shoestring fries, I knew I was in for something good. I'm still mesmerized by those fries! Deep-fried rosemary leaves are strewn throughout them, as well as slivers of garlic. Cut so thin, the fries were like potato chips- the best chips I've ever had. The burger tasted like a burger should taste- here's the beef! I ordered it medium rare and I could really taste the meat that was moist to the point that I don't know how it stayed together. Roquefort cheese took it over the edge. Not ketchup for this baby, but I added some mustard. This would be a five star review if not for the fact I feel I have to account the table's experience as well. My sister is a vegetarian and ordered the pumpkin soup. Like any other item on the menu, a list of ingredients follows the titles. She was home free; she said this was the best soup she'd ever tasted! But then she encountered a cube of pancetta and after finding this out, she had to send it away. Word to the veggies, ask questions!

Anyway, the waitress took us to the table and dropped a bomb on us that the burger would take 40-60 minutes to be ready (are you kidding me??!).. We already waited 40 minutes so we couldn't just leave. Why didn't they say anything when we checked in?! Anyway, During the wait for their famous burger, no one apologized for the delay, offered complimentary drinks or at least given an explanation of what was going on in the restaurant. It was a total chaos. Staff running around from the kitchen to the basement through the front door, upstairs and downstairs, they were literally all over the place. The host cleaning tables, glasses/plates breaking every couple of minutes, and in the middle of all this, a waitress is standing on the booth writing the specials!!!.. I am not sure if this is an everyday situation but something wasn't right. The burger finally came and i've disconnected myself from the unpleasant surroundings couldn't wait for the first bite.

So when I called and asked about the wait for a 2-top on a sunday night, I was surprised and disappointed when the snooty host replied ""oh, it's really short tonight, you'll only have to wait an hour to an hour and a half"". Hmm, not the attitude I was expecting. I put my name on the list, and an hour later we were told to keep waiting, but without any real acknowledgment of how long, what the deal was, etc - just kind of brushed off. I'd be fine with the wait if the staff was a bit warmer. The burger was good, but not great, honestly. A pre-formed patty cooked medium, but still soft and mushy - not as in medium-cooked ground beef, but as in overly mixed, pre-pre-pre prepared patties. The only garnish of the burger was a bit of blue cheese, which was flavorful, but didn't really add a bunch to the burger. I felt the flavor was a bit masked by the blue cheese and bun, without a solid burger taste. The super fine fries were good on first taste, but overall a bit salty and over seasoned. I would have preferred half the amount of fries, with half the salt and seasoning, and hot.Love that they had the goose island on tap, and since we were seated at close to 10pm, by the time we were finished eating at around 11pm, the place had died down and was fairly chill.

For some reason, my friend and I came in around 7 and didn't have to wait at all. We were immediately seated and our waitress was super nice and greeted us with a smile.We weren't too hungry so ordered their chicken liver toast and a dozen oysters. We were kind of oblivious that their burgers were their signature dish but their chicken liver toast was the best I've ever had. It had this wonderful flavor, great consistency and the toast had the perfect crunch to go with it. After a summer in nyc eating all the great food places, this chicken liver toast still ranks very high up on my list. The oysters were also very tasty and shucked properly. Their onion mignonette enhanced the flavor of the oysters instead of covering it up like cocktail sauce does. tl;dr Get their chicken liver toast.

Finally made it there when some friends were visiting from out of town we had just finished walking down the Highline and realize that we were close to this long-awaited restaurant choice. Overall it was pretty good. Normally I would've probably gotten one of the specialty dishes but as we were waiting for the table we went upstairs to the bar and I saw a few tables having the burger which looked fantastic! so that's what I ordered and was definitely not disappointed. Before that we actually got the eggplant spread appetizer which I definitely highly recommend. I was actually expecting the entire menu to be pork based but there were barely any dishes. The ambience of this place was pretty cool as well it was very cozy. Would definitely come back and try something more unique next time.,The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Wait, let me start from the beginning...The place was packed when we arrived..(On a Monday night, who would've thought?) There was a 40 minute wait but we were willing to wait aka my friend was willing to wait and I was going to faint. So I gave them my phone number and they said they'll give us a ring when our table is ready.  We decided to go kill some time at a wine bar we passed by (see my review on Turks and Frogs).They finally called. FYI: They aren't exaggerating when they say that it is a 40 minute wait.The place is filled with so much character. Everywhere you look, you'll see something  that's related to pigs.

If you don't want to wait to dine in, GET IT TO GO. I'm serious. Plate-Seared Mackerel w/ creme friache & mint- It was perfect. Very light, so it doesn't fill us up before our entrees.Entrees-1-Hampshire Pork Belly- Ironically this was their only pork plate (yelp.com/biz_photos/3LNc…). I was expecting to go full-on swine here. Guess not. The dish was good but so was every other pork belly dish I've had. Bar Boulud is still my place to go if I was in the mood for pork belly2-Pan Roasted Skate- (yelp.com/biz_photos/3LNc…) My friend said she liked it a lot but thought it was a bit too salty from the capers.Dessert- Banofee Pie (yelp.com/biz_photos/3LNc…) It was delicious, it was too sweet and the banana didn't overpower the dessert. Whenever I get something that has banana in it, all I can taste is banana. Not in this case though. You were able to enjoy the caramel, banana, dark chocolate, cream flavors all in one bite.Oh and by the way..http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3LNcgFUGdwJil-KDQPZmdQ?select=1FU7xCkKPjNOGa2YTVao0Q",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I just can't click on two, though, not when I loved it here so much in the past. I'm hoping today was an off day for them, but in scrolling through some recent reviews, it seems like this once truly excellent restaurant is on a downward trend. All good things, right? As Vonnegut might write, so it goes. I stopped in for lunch after a morning wandering the village. I was seated right away, and the hostess was actually quite nice (before today I had never experienced a poor attitude from anyone working at the Spotted Pig). Unfortunately, the downstairs is cramped, and they seat most often down there; I've sat upstairs and it is nicer. I sat in the booth directly in front of the kitchen. My waitress came over, and...she wasn't nice. She just exuded some sort of holier-than-thou attitude. Additionally, she was a terrible waitress. She dropped off my drink right away, and then I didn't see her again until the check. A different server brought my entree, and he refilled the empty glass that she quite obviously ignored. She read another table specials she never mentioned to me. Her attitude was one of supreme indifference. I wasn't the only one receiving bad service; the couple next to me had two waiters take drink orders, and then drinks didn't arrive for ten more minutes. They were clearly annoyed, but did not appear to speak much English; they ended up eating quickly when their entrees arrived and left in kind of a huff. I saw their point.Food has gone down in quality, too. I used to be able to order something ordinary, like a burger, and have it turn out extraordinary. Today I ordered the grilled cheese and, frankly, I could have made it. Disappointing.It gave me a few good culinary years, and it was always a reliable West Village spot for lunch or dinner, but I think the next time I'm in the West Village I'll wander past the Spotted Pig in search of food.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Knowing we'd be unable to make a reservation, we planned to meet as early as possible to make sure we'd be able to get a table before things got busy. When I arrived (I got there first) I told the host that I was waiting for 3 friends, but could I give them my name so that they'd be able to get us when a table was ready. He quickly rushed me upstairs and said ""we have an important party coming momentarily so I'll find you later."" Huh? 20 minutes later, Anthony Bourdain and a few of his guests arrived and were immediately seated in what I can only guess is a private room upstairs. Fine. Obviously, my friends and I aren't highly regarded restauranteurs, but we aren't hobos either - it was weird that they were so dismissive about seating us. Even though there were open tables, it took them another 15 minutes to seat my friends and me. The seating here is an issue. They cram a lot of tables into small spaces and I ate my whole meal on a low to the ground stool with no back. Very uncomfortable. Because we'd heard so much about the burger, my friend and I both ordered that and the others ordered a steak. We waited about 45 minutes for our food which is a long time considering we ordered the same things and nothing was particularly elaborate. The burger is the SALTIEST thing I have ever eaten. I had to scrape off the cheese - there was too much and it was just so, so, so salty. Also, what is the no mayo thing? A girl can't put a little mayo on her burger? When I asked my waitress if I could have mayo on the side for my burger she literally said ""Sorry, no we don't do mayo here."" WEIRD. Service - horrendous. I saw my waitress twice. Once to take our order and once to drop off the food -she never came to ask if we needed refills on our beers or if we liked our food. About 3/4 of the way through dinner, our check (as well as the checks for the two tables next to us) was brought by a waiter and he stood to the side and stared at us while waiting for us to pay, which we were happy to do once we actually finished our food. We had planned on desserts and coffee, but if they were in such a rush, we were all happy to give our business elsewhere.

We put our name for the anticipated 1 hour wait and headed to one of the local bars for a drink as the bar at SP was a little too packed for us. Regardless, upon arriving back they seated us right away. The service was great..super friendly and helpful, as we had lots of questions about the menu but the thing that stood out here was defintely the food...OH the FOOD.. it was crazy delicious! We have lots of really good gastropubs here in Southern Cal but I have to say the food here was the BEST I've ever had at a gastropub.  We started out with the devils on horseback and the ricotta gnudi...both were delish and loaded with flavor.  We were pretty hungry so these did a perfect job of taking the edge off our hunger while we waited for our entrees. Next up was my friend's apple salad and my burger with the most amazingly delectable fries w/garlic and rosemary. OMG.. we could NOT stop eating these fries..these were seriously the most flavorful fries I've ever had in my life.  The burger was also pretty damn amazing...and let's just say not a bite was left on the plate. ;-) I highly suggest you make time for the Spotted Pig if visiting NYC...totally worth whatever the wait is... :-)",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Loved the fries but honestly, the burger I had at the Shake Shack was better.  Nothing was amazing. Maybe I went in with too high of expectations, but I think it was underwhelming. Or - maybe it was the smug, unenthusiastic service. Our server was irritated by our presence. It was a late Monday afternoon - we ordered drinks, appetizers, dessert.... the whole shabang. You would think she'd be excited. No real recs on the food - as if I was supposed to know what they all tasted like. She dropped by the table every 10-to-15 to show how annoyed she was to be working. We were not allowed to order appetizers while we decided on the rest of the meal and sorta shamed for not knowing what we wanted immediately and actually have questions about the menu.  My tipping point was the tip. Split by credit card and cash,  the waitress just assumed that the 30 percent cash was hers and charged the rest to the card as if she had done something  - like be civil to deserve it.  I would have been able to overlook the mistake but again - her response to my questioning was just snotty ,  so I made her reverse it. I waited after college and in grad so I am a big tipper.

The blue cheese is very powerful to say the least, and seeing as I'm not a fan of blue cheese, I was not a fan of this burger. The brioche bun was perfect as was the marbling of the patty itself.

She did not know much about the restaurant other than that the previous time we'd tried to get in, there was a three hour wait. This time, all good, twenty minutes and we were seated.Dining companion (to the waitress): ""So, what dishes are you known for?""Waitress: ""Well, we're a Michelin star restaurant, so...  :: blah blah blah Charlie  Brown's teacher who knows what she said after this blah blah blah... :: Ok, I get it. You have a line out the door every single night, you don't take reservations, the place is charming, the prices are decent.However, hope since you're ""Michelin star restaurant"" (gag me with a rake), hopefully you're not above some constructive criticism, but here it is overall:1. Chicken liver toast: Fantastic. Just right on that crusty bread.2. Deviled eggs: Also great, if not unique or remarkable by any means. Tip: my companion, who is gluten free, scraped the liver off her piece of the chicken liver toast and suggested I spread the deviled egg on it; there was still some liver on the bread. This was extremely tasty.3. Pan Seared Halibut with pea purée & escarole: Perfectly cooked and delicious, crusty skin on the fish, pea puree added just the right flavor, was overall excellent.4. Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi with brown butter & crispy sage: WTF too salty. Quite frankly, not that interesting.5. Creme caramel: Outstanding. Probably the best I've had in a long time.Service:Ranged from knowledgeable to overbearing. Knowledgeable: recommendations for dishes were good, detailed and accurately described dishes. However, saying that ""everything is good"" is just a pile of shit. Not everything at this restaurant is as good as everything else (see Gnudi notes above). Also, you have your preferences, I have mine, end of story. MAKE A RECOMMENDATION. Tailor it to your guest. DO SOMETHING. Don't just sit there and ride on your Michelin star. I guarantee you didn't get it through complacency.Overbearing: we were working on the Halibut slowly and also conversing, and we were asked twice within two minutes by the same server if we were finished with it. The answer was NO. Understand? EASY on that shit, k? Ask once, if they say no, LEAVE THEM ALONE for a bit. I've been a waiter in fine dining. Observation is key to success as a waiter in this class of dining. Just because someone puts their fork down for a second does not mean they're done. This is an example of a server who was not looking to see what was going on at the table.Ok, last but not least, NEVER EVER open your mouth under ANY circumstances and tell a customer you're a Michelin star restaurant. It smacks of insecurity (if not downright haughtiness), and quite frankly, means you've jumped the shark. Shut up and be gracious.

It was basically Pork Rinds on top of a bed of greens. Nothing spectacular. My friend got the Burger with Shoe String Fries and he loved it. The fries were fried with Rosemary and Garlic and it was honestly, the best fries I have ever had (so far). I ordered the Steak with Roasted Spinach & Beets...the steak was perfectly cooked and well seasoned but the veggies were a little too salty for me. Regardless, it was still way above good. The only thing that annoyed me was that it took forever to get our entrees. The appetizer came out right away but we had to wait a good 20 mins afterwards before our entrees were served. For dessert, we ordered the Pop Corn Ice Cream and the Banoffee Pie. The ice cream was so-so (basically pop corn flavored ice cream with caramel popcorn sprinkled on top). The Banoffee Pie however, was a fluffy, sweet slice of heaven. Service was awesome...very attentive and with zero snootiness for such a celeb friendly place. I wish they would make the place bigger but incredibly enough, we never felt like they were trying to rush us out despite the hordes of waiting patrons at the bar.

Indeed, the Spotted Pig serves a solid, delicious burger, unique with the Roquefort cheese.They do give you the option to have it sans cheese, as the strong, goat-y flavor may not be for everyone. It blended well with the burger (at times stealing the spotlight), as its salty & creamy nature added another textural component and made the burger very dense. While I had to scrape some cheese off near the final bites, I still think it's a fantastic burger; the patty itself is still deliciously outstanding, and can be just as tasty if ordered sans Roquefort. I had mine cooked a perfect juicy medium rare, and the mild brioche bun pulled everything together nicely.Then, I'm a HUGE FAN of their shoestring fries! The abundance of rosemary (fried & edible) really gave them an addictive aromatic kick. Since they are hard to consume without looking like a barbarian, I opted to take the rest of the fries home for a late night snack, and I was so glad I did!Oh, we also got the devils on horseback. While Spotted Pig set theirs apart by braising a cube of apple (pear?) within each bacon-wrapped date, I didn't care too much for it compared to the burger & fries.I also adore the decor and feel of the space. There are pigs everywhere, and it looks like a cool (pig-filled) flea market tornado-ed itself all over the walls so that there is always something interesting to fix your gaze upon the crazy wall. The place also gets quite loud and (very) crowded as the night wears on, but I really enjoyed the mix of the crowd, which boasts all ages and all types of people.Only complaint: long wait! It took almost an hour for our burgers to come out. Our conclusion is that they just purchased the cow as we placed our order, and we had to wait for them to slaughter & age the beef. Thankfully, our server was very kind and gave us a bread basket because she felt bad we had to wait so long for the overall dining experience.

Unfortunately we left pretty upset as our waitress Simone was very rude by the end of the meal. We waited quite awhile for burgers as everyone around ordered and got their food, and in the end when we asked to split the check, we got some very major attitude. Now I understand we needed to split the bill 6 ways which is annoying, but all of us ordered 1 entree and 1 drink, not difficult for slow lunch time, not to mention we are all in the customer service industry so perhaps I get extra annoyed by blatant rudeness. Please put on a happy face, even if you're annoyed, you work at a place that is reputable. The rudeness we encountered was so incredibly frustrating and ruined the whole experience.

The beers came out quickly (the service was NEVER an issue) and were cold + delicious. The two appetizers came out fairly quickly and were completely inedible.I mean, frankly, they were absolutely disgusting--it was absolutely shocking and incredibly disappointing. I can honestly say that I have NEVER been served something HALF as salty as either of these dishes.We didn't eat even HALF of either plate before we very politely and quietly got the attention of our waiter. We explained that the food was overwhelming salty --literally all you could taste was salt (the waiter seemed unsurprised)-- and that we wanted to cancel the burger. He canceled the burgerm no problem, but charged us full price for everything else, despite that we didn't eat even a quarter of what we were served.I want to echo my first sentiment: I'm actually sad to be writing a negative review for this place. This restaurant has been so, so good in the past-- worth waiting over an hour for a table for. Now, I don't know what the problem is/what has happened, but I feel pretty confident saying that someone else, who adores salt. is in the kitchen.

I got to join them just as they were sitting down (sweet!). This restaurant has a great atmosphere. It's cozy without being too cramped. It has a casual coolness that only can be pulled off in Greenwich Village. This is not a place to just ""eat food."" This is a place to have an experience. To savor a meal with friends. If you are in the mood for that, you will be very pleased. If you are rushing trying to get somewhere else you will not...We had the Roll Mops aka pickled herring to start. I never thought of myself as a fan of this but they were great. We then had the special which happened to be sausage. We shared an awkward moment with our waiter as he was detailing this ""special sausage"" to us. I then tried the infamous burger and it was as good as everyone hypes it up to be. It was cooked medium rare when I requested medium but the quality beef made this a non-issue. We shared several glasses of wine, beer, prosecco...

But, my party and i left quite disappointed with both the service and the food.The ambience was alright, if you don't mind sitting tight with whoever you came with (and perhaps even those you did not), as they will squeeze you in wherever, and as long as you do not mind pots of herbs in your hair (they have herbs growing in the window sill, which normally would be a nice touch, if only they were not scratching my neck the whole visit).I came early in the evening with two friends. The wait for a table was a good 30 minutes, during which time we were not offered a drink from the bar, but were greeted only with snarky stares by a number of the waiters. Once we were seated, we got to ordering quick, starting with the deviled-eggs. First mistake. The were completely overpowered with vinegar. We could not taste the egg yolks or the chives, only vinegar. I mentioned to the waitress that they did not taste good, only of vinegar, and she retorted, ""VInegar is one of the main ingredients,"" and did not offer to return them to the kitchen.Our mains were just okay. I ordered the fish and my friends ordered the vegetable platter and the burger. The vegetables were completely overpriced for the amount given and the flavor (somewhat bland), and so was everything else, due to the snarky staff, long wait, and tight seating. The kicker, too, is that at one point during our meal i got up to use the restroom. A male employee was in there, so i  waited a minute before i could get in. There are only two stalls, mind you, and the toilet in the stall i walked in was COVERED IN URINE. So, either that employee was pretending to clean up in there while in actuality doing nothing but killing time, or he is the one who urinated all over the toilet.

The previous attempts have resulted in waits that last over an hour - they do not take reservations here. If the wait is long, they do take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. Finally on a random Wednesday for dinner I was able to get a table with no wait and try their legendary burger - that some people say is the best in the city.The spotted pig looks like a regular gasgropub, the kind you see all over the city. The seating is really cozy and this place is always packed.Sure I ordered oysters, but I came for one reason and that was to try the burger. It is the burger with Roquefort cheese and shoestring fries. Let's start with the fries first and shoe string is a good description for them. I was a huge fan of them, these are not the fries you can eat one at time but these you grab in handfuls. They were very well seasoned and you are given a generous amount.Now for the burger. I can understand why some people would not like the Roquefort cheese. It is pretty much a blue cheese but way stronger. At times it really overpowers the flavor of the burger, and that will definitely turn a lot of people off. For me I freaking love cheese and yes although the initial bite surprised me, combined with the perfectly cooked meat, it made for a good 1-2. Cooked medium rare, the actual patty was absolutely delicious. It really melts in your mouth and is definitely one of the better ones I've tasted.Now this isn't a cheap burger, but you have to realize this place has a michelin star. Now is this the best burger in nyc? Not sure - I haven't really checked out that many burger places, but the burger here is different and I had no complaints.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

What a place.We showed up around 6:15 and were seated immediately, which was nice and surprising due to the fact that everything i read before mentioned the long wait times. Sitting down, we looked at the menu and decided to go with a few starters and then dinner. Our server informed us of the specials, a soft shell crab appetizer and a braised rabbit leg dinner. To start we had the soft shell crab, a plate of oysters, and of course the chicken liver toast. The CLT was so rich creamy with a wonderful crunch. It was just as good as everyone claimed it to be. The oysters were very good, growing up on the shore I get very picky about shellfish, and they came with a vinegary sauce- so good that I'll never want cocktail sauce again. Then came the soft shell crab. It was so delicious, so juicy, so perfectly cooked that it deserves its own paragraph. If this is ever on special when you visit, please order it. It is so god damn good.For dinner, my girlfriend got the skirt steak. It was cooked perfectly, and was the juiciest skirt steak I have ever tasted. It was paired with beets and baby onions, which really complemented it well. I got the braised rabbit leg with spring vegetables. Before I elaborate, I am not a picky eater in any stretch of the word, but I am usually cautious when it comes to game. But, i threw inhibition to the wind and ordered it. I am so happy that I did. It was braised in a white wine sauce, surrounded by some beautiful spring vegetables, all making the dish better and better. The rabbit was so tender and juicy that i couldn't get enough. When I was finished I told the server that I wish i could eat another one, it was that good.I will be back, probably going to order the cheeseburger (everyone around us had it and it looked oh so good), but I'm sure anything I order will be excellent.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Minor Critique: Thought the cheese was just a tad overwhelming, but maybe they put just a bit too much on mine.Also tried the skate (skippable, too salty, but tasty and filling for a white fish) and the roasted beets (awesome).

My odorous, gag-worthy neighbors aren't the Spotted Pig's fault -- but it still tainted my experience.First things first: The servers were great. Friendly. Not snobby. And they kept the French-pressed coffee coming.Our table shared the cheese beignets and pork cheeks to start. OMG. The beignets were sickeningly good. These puffs of fried cheese dusted with paprika were gobbled up in about two seconds. Next came the pork cheeks. UMMM, I think I died and went to hog heaven right there at the table. Incredible -- the pork was tender yet crispy and crowned with a runny egg. If you see this on the menu (I think it was a special when I ate there), GET IT.I finished everything off with the famous burger. Sorry to disappoint, but the burger is just a burger. Nothing to write home about -- and the crumbled pungent cheese was very good -- but a little overwhelming. I could barely taste the burger in my burger. The fries were a great surprise. I normally skip shoestring fries, but these were very special.

They refused to do that, because they can sit us at the table for three only when there are actually present all three of us.

1173,hBwM00HH7DrfQhIu_FTgOw,Annie T.,4.0 star rating,"Yes. Yes. A thousand times YES. I HIGHLY recommend coming to this place from the hours of happy hour to late dinner. This is an incredibly unique gastropub (a place that serves high end food and beer). Overall: 4.5/5 (-0.5 for the long wait)Wait: We arrived during the end of happy hour, and I have to say, if you can, MAKE RESERVATIONS. This was the first time I was there and I was thoroughly impressed at how full it already was, especially on a weekday. It's definitely a bit of a wait. The server was so kind; since it was freezing outside and the downstairs area was a little awkward/crowded to wait, we were taken upstairs to the bar. Four girl, one male bartender. Lets just say, if you're good with words you can get a few free drinks. They've got a great selection of drinks that range from all sorts of flavors including fruity, sweet, sour, spice-y, ginger-y, herby, and more. That being said, I have to thank the bartender because he made our wait seem like nothing. [PS. I recommend the dark and stormy drink...it's so delicious. SO DELICIOUS].The decor: very unique; with the name spotted pig, you can definitely expect some pig portraits, which was amusing. The ambiance was very intimate. The lights were very dim and the booths were cushioned. The noise level was a bit on the louder side, but I could still hear what my friends were saying from the across the table. Everyone is in their own little bubble at their tables. Loved it!The food: I didn't know what I was eating half the time, but man it was so delicious! As a gastropub, The Spotted Pig has fusions and unique tasting entrees. If you want some appetizers, the fries are delicious. They're not your typical fat fries with a little bit of crunch. Instead, this fries are skinny and super crunchy! They're titled shoestring for a reason as to how thin they are. You cannot leave without trying the Chicken Liver Toast. Most people get a bit squeamish when there are not so typical animal parts on the menu, but trust me, this is delicious! I hope this isn't a disgusting description, but the liver has been grounded and seasoned and put on a large piece of toast. Since the bread crust is crunchy, the bite is both mushy, flavorful, and crunchy all at once. I know. Weird, but trust. TRY IT. If you don't like it...fine, at least you tried it before dissing it! That's fair. Lastly, my entree was the Prosciutto & Ricotta Tart with Marjoram. Portions look small, but they're actually quite filling. But man it was so delicious. The crispy Ricotta tart was filled with marjoram (an herb) was the perfect about of crisp. The spinach and prosciutto gave both a fresh, yet salty taste that was not overpowering at all.  Fantastic. I will definitely recommend and be back.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

These are hands down the best fries I have ever had.  I am pretty sure if there was a competition for eating these fries I would enter and possibly win because they are soo good that I would just stop by and order fries.  They are well seasoned and each bite is great.All their highlights are quite true.  Their chicken liver toast is something you must try as it has a boost full of flavor and is quite tasty.  The food is delicious and the interior design is quite interesting.  I was seated upstairs and saw a couple of people from 30 Rock eating there also.,The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

After stepping in and putting our number on the list we spent the next hour and a half walking around the West Village searching for a similar winning combination of dark lighting, great beer, and delicious burgers and fries and we couldn't find anything else that fit the bill. The Spotted Pig is a great date spot and I can see why Piper Chapman on OITNB wanted to pay it a visit on her break from prison. This is definitely where I would want to come. The shoe string fries with Rosemary were amazing. Don't be intimated by the large pile, you will finish them. The burger was mind blowing - juicy and buttery with just the right amount of blue cheese and a perfectly toasted bun. The servers give great beer recommendations to boot! I saved half my burger for dinner the next day and was seriously upset when I realized I forgot to put in into the fridge after returning home in the wee hours of the morning. The memory of the burger was so good that I put serious consideration into whether heating the burger would kill the bacteria that may have flourished over the last ten hours at room temperature but decided I'll just have to make my way back soon.

I make them better at home.)-Devils on Horseback (4 Stars. I LOVED this dish. It was sweet, salty and just yummy.)-Chargrilled Burger(3 Stars. The burger was OK. I think it all depends on your tastebuds. The meat tasted great and was cooked Medium but the cheese was overpowering. After a couple of bites you either acquire a taste for the cheese and like it or you don't. I would of preferred regular fries. The shoestring fries were oily and very annoying to eat. I looked very silly eating them.Overall the experience left us satisfied. Take note the seating is very close.

1182,2miiGPU4GacZs123bE5S4Q,Alissar T.,4.0 star rating,"Co-owned by Jay-Z, this gastropub and celebrity hot spot was well worth the 1 year wait it took to finally get a table. I first heard about this restaurant in the summer of 2011 and have been waiting to try it ever since. Located in the West Village, on the corner of 11th and Greenwich, The Spotted Pig is famously established and is located on prime real estate in the heart of the West Village. Since they don't take reservations, and dinner waits are up to two hours, the timing had never worked out. A few Friday's ago, Kyle and I were off from work, and figured it would  be the perfect time to try to get a table. We went for a late lunch around 2PM. We still had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, so we sat at the bar and took in the quaint and cozy atmosphere. It was well worth the quick 10 minute wait  to not only finally be at The Spotted Pig, but we also got a corner booth that I had my eye on.We started with an order of the deviled eggs. It was $4, and well presented, topped with a generous portion of fresh, bright green chives. They were good-- rich in flavor, but just a tad too vinegary for my liking.  Next, we shared the Brown Butter Sage Gnudi, which is a type of Gnocchi. After eating many plates of Gnocchi while while in Italy, my standards have been set high. This dish instantly brought me back to a Gnocchi I had in Florence. Not incredibly dense and overfilling, but so flavorful. The gnudi was delightfully savory- warm and creamy, stuffed with fresh ricotta and tossed in a brown butter sage sauce. The dish is then garnished with fried sage leaves and freshly grated parmesan.....Crazy good!We then shared their famous burger, served with a massive portion of rosemary shoe string fries, that resemble a cross between a french fry and a potato chip. Nonetheless- deliciously addicting.  The burger was cooked to a perfect medium, served on a toasted, buttered bun with Roquefort cheese. Roquefort is sheep's milk blue cheese that melts beautifully on a burger, and compliments the smoky, rich taste of a burger with a distinct creamy tang. Spotted Pig also offers a full bar with craft beers and good cocktails. Great service, cool atmosphere, and reasonable NY prices.

I wasn't too crazy about the string fries but they were still good.  I would personally prefer a thicker cut, but again, still very tasty. I had a Guinness which somehow tasted better with the burger.  The decor is very West Village so I enjoyed it's ambiance.  We went to the bar upstairs which I like better because it's brighter.  The place gets SUPER packed though, so I would recommend going earlier for dinner if you can.  P.S. as good as the burger is, it isn't the best value in town and quite pricey, but, wirth it in my opinion. $20 for one I believe, but again, soooo good.

Our wait time was approx 30 mins. Not too bad. From what the other reviewers posted id say we didn't way too long at all. In the meantime you're able to wait in the bar area , which they have two of. One downstairs by the entrance which is usually packed or the bar upstairs which was not packed at all. Appetizers- chicken liver toast. It was good, but way too much of the spread if you ask me. I would tell them go lightly on the spread next time.Deviled eggs- excellent :)I had the hamburger medium rare, which was cooked to perfection and seasoned just right.  Pretty presentation. Loved the grill marks on top of the bun. Shoestring fries were ok. I could of done without them.The staff was great. Food did take awhile to arrive, but it was very busy so it's understandable. Food was overall yummy. The chargrilled hamburger was excellent! The decor was so much fun. Kept up with the theme of pigs everywhere. Very diverse group of people.

Maybe i should have prefaced this review by saying i'm from Los Angeles....where the heck is the cheese, lettuce, tomato, or some other condiment on this burger. what an overpriced burger. secondly...what are these things called ""fries"" these are shredded up potatoes placed in too much grease and fried up and labeled ad ""shoestring fries."" other problem is...this restaurant tries so hard to give a nice, cute romantic ambiance that it becomes utterly uncomfortable. my bf and i were seated in the corner of a booth with a small round table. we couldn't really figure out how to maneuver the table, our butts and our legs so that we weren't constantly bumping each other and able to actually reach our food. The services was pretty crappy also. can't really tell who's the waitress and who actually is a customer. Everyone has this hipster, ""i don't put much effort into my look""  appearance and nobody smiles.

1190,ghzPmvAEm21QwCTs5R6Mtw,Ryna D.,3.0 star rating,"The gastropub concept took off in London a decade ago where pub patrons have long lamented the lack of good food to accompany their mugs of hearty ale. New York has finally caught on in recent years but Spotted Pig is the undeniable pioneer. Spotted Pig has been open since 2004 and yet on a Friday night throngs of hungry and thirsty New Yorkers still descend upon this West Village spot. The 100-seat restaurant has kept its no reservations policy so be prepared for a wait. On busy nights that can be an hour at the least.  Chef April Bloomfield came recommended by Jamie Oliver and her simple yet memorably delicious dishes does not disappoint. Since you most likely would have downed two alcoholic beverages by the time you get seated start with the chicken liver toast. It's a savory sweet combination that will both satisfy and rev up your appetite. Then have the Pig's twist on a British classic, Devils on Horseback. Bloomfield's version has them soaking the prunes in tea and stuffed with pickled pear before it is wrapped in bacon and cooked with a dash of cayenne. Yes, it is make your mouth water kind of delicious. Also a must try is the gnudi. The ricotta dumplings are rich with butter, Parmesan, and sage but still light in texture. For more substantial entrees there is the burger with Roquefort cheese, steak, and the squid if you want something a little more different. The dishes leaned towards salty but if you think about it, these dishes are essentially bar food and what better way to encourage drinking than salty food. There's a good selection of both beer and wine but the seasonal cocktails are also good to try. For dessert, the flourless chocolate cake is satisfyingly rich and the seasonal fruit tarts are excellent. On a recent visit it was a peach tart topped with an exquisite lemon verbena ice cream. Now, while the meal was quite enjoyable there is an argument to be made that it is also overpriced. Put simply, it is dressed up bar fare, simple dishes that are executed well. So whether or not your tab at the end of the night is justifiable, especially with the hour long wait, is a question left up to each diner.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I couldn't find it till my missus pointed out the spotted pig above the doorway. And the 30 plus pigs scattered through the windows.We came in @4:30 and were seated immediately, though the place was still humming. The table was about the size of a toilet seat. Yup, two people won't get more than their plates on the table and a couple of cocktails.Service and cocktails were good, with the top cocktail using elderflower booze.We started with the chicken livers on toast which were as unaesthetic as you can imagine them, but tasty. Also had the rollmops; sweet herring with cream, onions which was great. None of these are show stoppers but well made comfort food.For mains, I had the prosciutto and ricotta tart with arugula while the missus had a Roquefort burger with shoestring fries. Both really quite good. They had ketchup and mustard on demand, but weirdly no mayo.  In a restaurant?Is this the best gastro pub I've been too? Does it deserve a rareified michelin star? While it was enjoyable, and cute with galleons of pigs scattered throughout, the answer has to be no to both. Space was at a premium, with an Asian tourist trio staring hungrily at us as they waited standing for a table in the middle of the restaurant.

As some other reviews have noted, it definitely would not have been worth a two hour wait. My one major gripe against the restaurant were some of the clientele who hung out at the bar upstairs; from the group of yuppies who were very rude to my family when they claimed we (sitting at a table) were in their way to a couple that were stroking each other's private parts right in front of us.

We got lucky and managed to cram ourselves in the bar. We decided to try a bunch of plates. I got deviled eggs, which were hands down the best I've ever had and I could sit there eating them all night. I also tried both of their specials. The pork rillete was delicious but please, please share it. The fattiness is amazing at first and then gets overwhelming; I couldn't eat too much of it. The pig's ear salad with lemon & caper dressing was good for the first two or three bites. The pig's ear is fatty but the acidity of the dressing helped cut through it-- the problem is, the dressing was TOO acidic and after a few bites it really hurt to eat more. I love acidic/sour foods and the funny way they tickle the palate, but this was like pucker sour. Like eating a lemon. I ate the pig's ear and left half the salad. I couldn't finish it and I'm normally the type to clean my plate every time.What ticked me off was that I asked the waiter at the end if the dish is meant to be extremely acidic. Obviously I expected some acidity because it is a lemon dressing, but this was pretty much inedible once the pig's ear was gone. But the waiter found a very, um, polite way to just say, ""didn't you see that coming? IT HAS LEMON IN IT!"" He tried explaining that the lemon is meant to compliment the bitterness of the greens, which I appreciate and understand, but he just made me feel like I ordered tuna sashimi and complained it was raw. It was kind of a turn-off and I was a bit disappointed that he didn't even offer to bring a different salad. I was very sad to throw $16 away.I did try the burger and thought it was good but certainly not the best I've had, not by a longshot, even compared to other gourmet/high-end burgers. The beef was really good and cooked perfectly, but the cheese was very pungent and overpowered the beef. Beef that good deserves to shine. I feel bad rating this place two stars when everyone loves it and it's a ""New York institution"". But if I'm waiting more than an hour for dinner, I kinda want to be blown away and I wasn't. I did try some of the other dishes and they were very good, but I wasn't happy with mine and I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to come here, wait for 2 hours, and potentially end up with something unpalatable-slash-inedible. Also, a fight broke out literally right next to us and the place being so tiny, we heard the whole thing.

1201,nlp5I0GB8AUYXd3YalLnaQ,Sheryl L.,3.0 star rating,I wanted to love this experience - I really did.  On a warm Saturday afternoon we arrived at 1:45pm and found a reasonable 30 - 40 minute wait.  Understanding we were just past the peak hours of Brunch it didn't seem like a bad wait.  I do like they have a system in place to text you when the table is ready so that you can walk around the West Village.  We were seated just at the 40 minute mark upstairs towards the back.  The seating is a little unusual and because we were in a corner there wasn't really room for me and my dining partner.  We've been in small restaurants around the world so it wasn't an inconvenience just not terribly comfortable.  This is where the experience took a real sideways turn.... it took the waitstaff over 30 minutes to greet us and take the order.  I don't know if there was a shift change or not but there were two other tables also in the back room with no service either.  Once the waiter came by he was polite enough but then it took another 30 minutes for our meal to come out.  So sitting over an hour waiting to eat just isn't good enough in my book.  While the restaurant was busy it seemed something was really wrong.  We ordered the French Toast (which was excellent) and of course the Burger cooked medium.  Both were well made but with the air conditioning and fan in the back room it seemed the food cooled quickly.  I don't have a solution for that just a point to make.  Our server never returned to take a second drink order which seemed like a missed opportunity.  Our intention had been to enjoy some dessert as they are know for great one's but after the crazy long experience and total lack of service we opted to pay the check and go.  So even though the food experience was good the service and timing really didn't Wow us which resulted in the 3 stars versus 4 or possibly even 5.,The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

1203,Drmw6rCcbiC9pmkyr_ZuMg,Linh V.,5.0 star rating,"One of my friends really pushed for me to come here so I was excited to try this place. They don't take resies so the wait can be quite long - up to 2 hours. But we were spoiled. One of my friends live close by so she put her name down and went back home to change. We arrived 10 minutes after they gave her a courtesy call.Before I go into the food, I want to acknowledge the terrific service. Apparently, the restaurant policy is that they don't seat a party until everyone's arrived. All but one of us were present. But when I went to the host, he didn't ask and just seated us so I thought it would be okay. It was not until a little into dinner did one of the SP people come by to let us know the restaurant policy. But after I told her that we had gone ahead and ordered for the absent party, she was absolutely fine with it and let us continue dinner.We wanted to try a lot of their dishes so we naturally ordered a lot. We started off with the Chicken Liver Toast. When I order this dish in other places, I usually get two small slices of bread with a spread of chicken liver. So with that expectation, we ordered two dishes for a group of four. Little did I know that the plates would come out with big slices of toast piled - and I mean, PILED - with chicken liver. It was soo delicious! I knew right away I was going to enjoy my dinner. Next came the Deviled Eggs since they are much raved about. No giant eggs here but they are pretty good for deviled eggs. I wouldn't wait in the cold for this though.I learned that Devils on Horseback is not my favorite. It's basically bacon wrapped around some kind of fruit, in our case, prunes. I love bacon but I don't like prunes so I didn't like this dish as much.The Gnudi is pretty much like gnocchi with cheese inside. It was soft, warm and gooey (very cheesy) but very heavy. Our friend told us a lot about how his favorite dish there was the fried pig ear stuffed with mushroom. We tried to order that but they didn't have it on the menu. Lucky for us though, their special for the night was Fried Pig Ear Salad (apparently, they have that on their menu now, so lucky you!). My favorite dish of the night! It's a big triangular piece of fried pig ear on top of greens tossed with some kind of citrus dressing. The pig ear was fried to perfection - crispy and not too cartilag-y. I still think about it sometimes... Sigh.Though we really didn't need it, we also had the burger and scallops. Super meh compared to what we already had. The burger comes with roquefort cheese (bleu cheese) and surprisingly, it was kind of dry. I had to take out the cheese because it was overwhelming my taste buds and I think I smeared some on my upper lip because I kept smelling the cheese the rest of the night, even after a scrubbing attempt. The shoestring fries that came on the side though were very good and crispy.The scallops were probably the worst dish of the night. Overcooked and underwhelming.Overall, a great experience. I love their menu so it's a definite must-visit the next time I'm in NYC again.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Jake told us the specials in short order, got us our first drinks and we were on our way to gastronomical delight. There isnt one thing negative I can say about this meal aside from wishing I could have eaten more food. The chicken liver toast blew my mind. Never have I had chicken liver served so chunky where the texture didnt bother me. This was amazing. The gnuddi, could not have provided a better way to get brown butter and cheese into my mouth. The pig ear salad finished off the meal with this level of acidity, crispness, and rich pork flavor that really satisfied the palate. Personally I would never go to a spot like this with more than 1 or two other people. The wait list might deter a lot of people yet I'd encourage you to wait.

However, you can actually enjoy seafood in great quality along with amazing appetizers with meat. **Waiting on lineChecked this place for a weekday dinner with my best company at 7:30pm ish. It seems there is always a long waiting line, so put your name on the wait list and swing by a pub next to this place for a quick pre-game drink in the meantime. **FoodMust-try appetizer at Spotted Pig is, not to mention, Chicken Liver Toast. I didn't expect too much, to be honest, but it was actually my favorite dish for that dinner. We also tried oysters and roll mops (with mackerel and cream cheese filing), both of which were really fresh and amazing. Especially the oysters, I believe, were one of the top qualities/freshness in the city. For entrees, we had pan roasted skate wings and sauteed black sea bass. Skate wings was also good as other yelpers applauded; mushrooms and potatoes on side were also great. The sea bass, however, was a bit disappointing as seasoning was not even so that some of its portion was overly salty. Not many options for dessert, but lemon tart would be a worth try.**SeatingThis place is pretty spacious. You can sit at the bar or tables on the 1st floor, but 2nd floor seating area is better; it's really cozy and you can sit side by side.

I went here for a Friday lunch with one other person, we were the first people seated and ordered in under ten minutes. It took over an hour to get our food,  same for the couple next to us. We saw multiple tables that arrived later get served first, despite having ordered the same dishes.  The waitress was knowledgeable but condescending and inattentive.  When I asked for the check because I couldn't wait much longer she was noticeably affronted and became aggressive. She assured me my food would be out soon so we stayed. The manager (?) delivered it and was equally abrupt. The gentleman next to us tried to tell her about the wait but she interrupted him repeatedly with a rote line about different foods taking longer to prepare (they were probably the 2nd or 3rd order placed in the whole restaurant and we saw their exact dishes go out to several other tables before they got theirs so this made no sense.) The food was good not amazing. The chicken liver toast was a great, savory start but the octopus special, gnudi and frites were completely forgettable. The spotted pig bitter ale was beyond bland and watery but the cocktails were fine. The restaurant itself is casual and cozy. The decor is charming and sets a great Boho chic tone. The bus service was commendable and the bartender actually left the bar to bus and close out checks. The waitress and manager gave off the ""we're successful and have good reviews so we don't have to bother being courteous to individual customers""  vibe which killed the whole place for us.

After this delicious, rich, creamy, livery and buttery concoction hit my lips I knew there must be a God! By far the best crostini of any kind that I've ever had. For $6 I would have been happy ordering three of them to serve as my entire meal. Yet I had to control my urge and try other things on the menu. I ordered the special that day which was a grilled octopus over some sort of bean (pinto like but not pinto) and seaweed beans (a lot like green beans in flavor and texture). It was very well done. The octopus was tender and had a great grilled flavor. I wouldn't necessarily pair it with the offerings of beans and seaweed beans, the flavors worked but weren't exciting.My fiance had the burger. It was perfectly cooked, flavorful, juicy and paired amazingly with the stinky cheese that came on it. The enormous heap of shoestring potatoes that came with was enough to intimidate any mammal, not just being the human variety.My friend who was also there ordered the other special that day which was lamb with a mint sauce (chimichurri like) and jalapeno relish. The lamb was well cooked but the flavors of the lamb may have been overshadowed a bit too much with the intense flavors of the mint and jalapeno. They also did put a bit much of the sauces and extra mint leaves on the plate as well which may have contributed to the lack of lamb flavor.Overall the bill came out to about $200 with tip.

More of a place to be seen than see. Mainly European friends want to go there. My thought is if you want to spotted pig you can find plenty of places like that in Europe without the crowd.

Not sure what all the hype is about, as I don't really appreciate 1) being treated rudely by the maitre-d who for some reason thinks they are better than you (ah excuse me you work in a RESTAURANT) 2) waiting 45 minutes on a tuesday night when I am told it is a 20 minute wait and 3) being served something so salty is was uneatable. I am not sure if it is just an american palette that jut LOVES a sodium fuelled meal, or if its just people that have low expectations. But I was so unimpressed that I would have actually rather a Big Mac, and thats saying somethings as the last time I ate McDonalds was 10 years ago. What disappoints me is myself. I should have seen all the photos of a sugary bun with a salty blue cheese and patty. ah is that all? when I tried to order salad instead of fires i was told 'no substitutions'. great gooooood customer service. And WHAT is with the obsession with those stupid stick like things they call 'fries'? they are like small strips of cardboard covered in MORE salt and piled so high its stupid. So if you like so much salt your lips tingle, warm beer, slow service and deep fried twigs, by all means knock yourself out, just don't go in with high expectations and you wont be disappointed.

Honestly, I said ""How does this taste SO GOOD?""Then our burgers came, so juicy, so delicious. I'm also a sucker for a pretzel bun. Again, the best burger I've ever had. It comes dressed sparsely with blue cheese crumbled on top and is even better with a little bit of their dijon mustard. Simple, but so delicious - perfect really.

It was exciting walking in knowing that this was an establishment co-owned by Jay-Z. Seriously, when you look at Jay-Z and you try to think of food, what do you get? Well, I'll tell you what I didn't get.I didn't expect the pomme frittes to be so cruncy on the outside yet so soft and buttery on the inside. There was so much of it that despite us both attacking the plate from two sides, we couldn't finish it. We ordered a few plates to try and was pleased with all of them. They were exotic and adventurous, but nothing that I would think twice about trying. The decor was dark and romantic. The music wasn't too loud. Despite the busy crowd, the waiters were very attentive. Overall, I left with a happy tummy.What makes this review a 5-star was what happened afterward. So my date and I went to Fat Cat afterward to play chess. We walked there..which is really not that far...but at night it is. After agreeing it was a tie, we decided to leave for the night. I decided to call my friends in the area and met up with them; ditching my now kind of creepy date after a few drinks.  Only then, did I realize I've lost my wallet but still have my phone. My friends came to my rescue and we decided to look for my wallet. This is now 3am on a Friday night. We walked around aimlessly because my phone has died at this point and with no one sober, direction became a blur. After an hour of wondering, I finally saw the restaurant.. The guys in the restuarant were cleaning up at this point and was startled by me pounding on the glass door. Finally someone came close enough for me to scream I think I may have left my purse in there. He opened and asked me to describe it. He finally lead me upstairs into the employees' secret chamber and gave me my wallet (I promised I wouldn't dish out on this secret chamber). Nothing was taken from it. My cards, cash, everything, still in there.Dear Spotted Pig, I love you for your food, decor, and mostly, I love you for your people. :)",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"
1242,ejKaC_NXWsK6pOh1Hdrssg,Michelle W.,4.0 star rating,"Expect long waits, just not as long as they tell you. We had a wait time of and hour and a half for two and got seated within half an hour. But the wait doesn't stop there, do expect to wait a while for your food. While we waited we got some drinks and my rum and coke turned into a gin and coke. I ordered my drink upstairs, but had the bartender downstairs fix it and she wasn't happy about it. Not sure what kind of rum she used, but needless to say, I won't be ordering it again. After finally getting a table, we started with the deviled eggs right away.  I wasn't a huge fan. We had the lambs tongue and the gnudi and a side of fries and chicken liver toast. Chicken liver may not sound like the most appetizing thing, and it honestly didn't look too appetizing, but it was delicious! So good, tasted more like chicken and less like liver. The lambs tongue was just like the chicken liver; tastes better than it sounds and looks. I've never had lambs tongue before, so I don't have anything to base it off of, but it was pretty good. Tasted like a very tender piece of steak. The gnudi was to die for. So creamy, so cheesy, so perfect. If you don't like anything that's super cheesy, I don't recommend this. The fries didn't taste as good as they looked, but they were still so so good. I like my fries super crispy. Be sure to ask for less salt; they were still super salty. They fry pieces of garlic with the fries which just add to the flavor.We passed on the dessert and while we weren't stuffed, we were satisfied. The bill wasn't outrageous and for the amount of dishes we had, it felt like a steal. The waitress was really nice, great service, just slow with the food which was expected as there are so many people ordering and only so many cooks. Highly highly recommend this place, and I'll definitely be back.

I ate this burger at the speed of lightning. The shoe string fries are ridiculously tasty, but I was so ravenous I kept biting my thumbs while shoving them in my mouth. The burger itself was cooked perfectly, but I found it a bit salty for my taste. I am not a big salt person so I could be in the minority. Service, good.

1244,-I4Su9FwZsAxfR__t3k-5g,Kelly S.,5.0 star rating,"Given that April Bloomfield just won the James Beard award, I think anything less than 5 stars would be inexcusable. This is less of a review of one particular experience and more of an homage to all of the experiences I've had put together. This is, hands down, my favorite restaurant in New York City. For several reasons.I've worked in 5 Star Hospitality for a long time, and one of my favorite parts about the Spotted Pig is their uncompromising commitment to quality, both of food and of experience. Part of this commitment is their refusal to acquiesce to the whims of guests. If you don't want to wait for an hour, that's fine. If you want to ask for 15 amendments to a dish because you want it a certain way, have something else. These aren't short order cooks on the line, they're culinary masters, and trust me when I say they know a hell of a lot more about what will make your tastebuds sing like a choir of angels than you do. That said, you should know what you're getting yourself into. It's a small restaurant. As such, the tables are small too. If you want space to stretch out, you'll likely be disappointed. With that in mind, every dining experience I've had has been incredibly intimate, and I've never felt like I was on top of someone else (except maybe when I was trying to get in or out of my seat). They also don't take reservations, so get there early, or be prepared to wait. Trust me when I say it's worth it. The burger is wonderful, but there are so many other incredible things on their menu it's hard to believe that's the most reviewed item here. Their burrata with wild mushrooms is to die for. The mignonette they serve with their oysters is sinfully good. Their steak with roasted beets tastes like Jesus cooked it for you himself, and as an added bonus it's very healthy. Their seasonal specials are incredible and constantly changing. The pork rillete is the stuff of my dreams. The corn soup is quite literally to die for, and it's a damn good thing I don't live in Greenwich village or it's all I would eat in the fall.  Throw the shoe string fries (with fried garlic chips and rosemary) into the soup and it's entirely possible that your taste buds will say ""We quit, because nothing you could ever give us will taste this good."" They have an excellently curated wine list, and every single one of their servers, bartenders, hosts, and servers assistants knows everything about every inch of both of their menus. I've never had a bad experience, and I don't know that I ever will.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

If ratings were based on atmosphere alone I would give it 4 stars. However the food here for me was a total let down. So we had to wait 45 minutes for a table.. this is despite the fact that there are free tables available. We were advised though that due to the size of the kitchen they have to limit the number of people they are serving at each time. Once we were seated we already knew what we wanted.. Chicken liver toast, and burgers! Sadly chicken liver toast was sold out for the day, and we were told burgers would take another 45 minutes. So we opted for other dishes being pumpkin pancakes, devilled eggs, and dutch baby with bacon (basically like a crepe). Perhaps we picked the wrong dishes but it was all totally underwhelming and nothing to write home about. Drinks were average and overpriced as well - the bloody mary needs a special mention, it looks great here (but tastes like a bloody mary you can get anywhere else).Also a table right beside us who had ordered at the same time as us, received their burgers at the same time as our dishes despite being told the wait would be 45 minutes.. maybe if we had the raved about burger it would have been a total different experience.Service was good, but nothing spectacular either.Sorry Spotted Pig we won't be coming back!",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

1255,Muj9Zzy80YLwen_Svyneuw,Norman C.,5.0 star rating,"After my previous encounter with one of the best burgers I have ever eaten.  I discover this gastropub, that holds claim to one of the best burgers in town.  So I decided to see for myself.  Upon arriving you would believe it is a normal store front or even someone's apartment.  Even the decorations themselves would make you believe it is someone's home and that is what gives The Spotted Pig's first impressions.  I looked around and I see a pretty surprising list of beers, one being a cask conditioned beer and another that caught my eye was the raisin flavored beer from Dogfish Head.  The cask conditioned beer at the moment was a four points branded beer and it was definitely one of the finer beers I have ever tasted.  The first smell of the beer is heavenly, has a fruity flavor and slight honey tone.  The bottom of the beer is slightly bitter to the taste but still well crafted.  Now to the main attraction...At first glance, the grill marks were a sight to admire as it gave a nice contrast to the bun.  The bun was firm and strong, and definitely had a nice firm taste to it with a slight nutty flavor.  The burger was cooked to a medium rare and was perfect in texture, flavor and juiciness.  What topped off the burger though, was the roquefort cheese.  It's a bleu cheese that has a strong flavor, so those who do not like strong cheeses should order something else, but those who can handle it. Will enjoy that there is a big dollop of it on the burger, which gives it a taste that will leave you wanting more. Not to be outdone, the fries were also heavenly.  The shoestring fries were fried with slivers of fresh garlic and dill which gave every bite of fries a wonderful taste that needed no ketchup. Absolutely amazing. The small plates were also very well made, deviled eggs and the ricotta gnudi were an awesome starter food to pick at.All in all, The spotted pig deserves to be one of the top burgers in town and definitely lived up to its Michelin Star.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

So lets get the important stuff out of the way first...The burger was solid. Nothing spectacular, a few points to the Roquefort cheese for creativity and points for the awesome fries, but some points deducted for too much butter. Honestly, the cheese, while differentiating the burger, really overpowered the entire burger. It was cooked nicely and evenly, perfect medium. The service was very good: timely and courteous. Beer and wine selections were awesome as well.Overall, the place gets 4 stars simply because of the burger. Its a good representation of the restaurant as a whole.

I asked the server for recommendations and clarification (I don't know what a ""hen in a basket"" is) and she seemed kinda bothered by a few questions. I figured it was a true food lovers hang out and the servers would love to talk about the menu. We had a couple drinks which were fairly small for the price, but really good. We started off with the brussel sprouts. These were overcooked with too much carmelization. I had the pork belly, which I normally love. This had not been cooked long enough and was tough and chewy. The fat layer too thick and rubbery. The flavor was there and was outstanding, but the execution was not. My wife had the gnudi. It had a weird film on the exterior. The gnudi was kind of bland.

First of all, a red haired employee walked out as a father carrying a baby was trying to walk in, and this employee looked at the father (who had his hands full) and did not help him with the door. Second, we struggled to find a waiter to place an order. Once we did, and the burger arrived, the waiter said he'd be back with ketchup. It's good that we didn't wait because we would still be waiting!!! To make matters worse, our order was never completed!

There was a light smattering of vinegar mixed with herbs that gives it a unnecessary sour taste. I had better deviled eggs at Dinosaur BBQ at half the price.Burgers, burgers, burgers.....Chicken Liver Toast:  The chicken liver spread was simply very rich, thick, and tasty.  This was generously placed on top of a nicely toasted thick bread cut into two pieces.Burger, burgers, burgers.......The burger came exactly as ordered.  Medium rare with a nice thick pink center when I bit into it.  The burger consists of a big piece of beef patty topped with Roquefort Cheese sandwiched between a specially made deliciously soft hamburger bun.  No tomatoes,pickles, or lettuce to be found anywhere.  Not that a good burger needs them.I had a problem with consistency of how the burger tasted from bite to bite.  The Roquefort is a very cloying, powerfully sharp tasting cheese.  It enhances the flavor of the beef when spread thinly on the patty making the burger delicious.  A problem arises though when there are uneven giant clumps of the cheese spread throughout the burger.  These parts with too much cheese was overly strong sharp/sour tasting.  Too bad because if it was done right throughout, it would have been a burger that I would have enjoyed immensely. Instead it was a love/hate relationship with my taste buds depending on the bite at the time.The burgers came with a heaping half a plateful of delicious shoestring fries.  Fried with bits of rosemary and garlic, and lightly salted, they were great.  They have to be the skinniest shoestring fries I've seen anywhere.Sigh... slightly disappointed after wanting this for such a long time.Oh well, on to the next one on my list.

It's super casual, and accepting of everyone no matter what. My friend and I kept laughing because they had hardcore rap playing on the second floor, and then it became like this hipster pot music. Super craaaaaazy. They have some crazy, awesome decor; it's really worth looking around. I got the frittata with swiss chard & ricotta, and my friend got the burger with shoestring fries. We decided to split the plates in half so we could both try each other's food.I actually really like the frittata. It's super eggy, and the ricotta makes the whole thing creamy with a bit of bite, along with the swiss chard for texture. I personally like cheeses that aren't pungent, so the ricotta was a good choice for me.On the flip slide, that burger... I don't know what to think about it, even after mulling over what to write on yelp (yes I do mull over things to write.) The cheese alone is so pungent, that it was nearly disgusting for me. Even my cheese loving yelping foodie friend thought it was a bit strong for her taste. HOWEVER, together with the meat, it was absolutely fantastic. They really know what they're making, oh my goodness. I still would choose like... barbeque or bacon or A1 sauce on my burgers though. personally.See, the shoestring fries came with the burger, but they just need a whole paragraph for themselves. They come as these wispy fried pieces of potatoes sent from heaven, mixed with rosemary leaves. They have nice rosemary scent, which totally just blew my mind. They give you soooooooo much; my friend and I split them and we still munched away for I think, an hour? gossiping and eating fries. They're so good. I might just go there and get fries.

It's still absolutely poppin', but the regular 9pm dinner crowd is filing out and it presents a rare window of opportunity for seating, either on the first floor bar or upstairs dining area.I'd gone to hear April Bloomfield speak earlier that week, and was able to get a copy of her book signed (as if I ever cook...but not the point, as a fan, I can still admire.)  She's famous for her pork dishes, and as it's a gastropub, one should order beer.  I went completely off-script and opted for the Gnudi (pasta similar to gnocchi / ravioli) with pesto - yum. Super heavy dish, but portioned tiny enough that it's manageable. Tom is on a quest to find the best burger in NYC - The Little Owl and Corner Bistro are both top contenders - but Spotted Pig butted its way in with a strong entry.  Rare, crumbly, buttery burger with sharp cheese spread.  So good.  The shoestring fries are fine, but a little excessive.  It's served with what can only be described as a bushel of shoestring fries, and they're so thin, they almost don't taste like anything.  It's kind of like - ok, I get it, thin fries...Relax.  Anyway, a small complaint for an otherwise awesome meal.Service is also so-so.Come with a small group or date late-night on a weekend.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

The atmosphere and ambiance are cozy and the decor is also quite original - pigs, not only spotted ones, all over the place.So why only three stars? There is typically quite a long wait (they don't take reservations). After we ordered one of their signature dishes (the Roquefort cheeseburger), we waited nearly another hour until our food comes. OK, the waitress kindly gave us a warning, but we nevertheless were sitting on uncomfortable stools in a really hot room, which did not make the wait any better. The burgers finally arrived and they did not disappoint. However, they are huge and so is the portion of shoestring potatoes that accompany the dish, so I definitely recommend for the average person to split this dish.

They don't skimp on the wild mushrooms on this dish, and they don't sneak in any of those boring, basic, cheap button mushrooms as filler, either.  This is a generous portion of earthy, woodsy mushrooms on top of creamy burrata and chewy bread.  No wonder it's a menu mainstay.Finally, we shared a burger (THE MAIN EVENT!) but after those three incredible appetizers, the ""famous"" burger fell very very flat.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but the cheese was a bit overpowering, and the shoestring fries reminded me more of potato sticks (the ones you had growing up...from a can) tossed with burnt rosemary.  Still a tasty entree, but very underwhelming compared to the other things that Spotted Pig can push out.Ordering tip: get ALL the specials. Every one we had was exceptional.  Also, try a few starters and split a burger if you're coming here to ""try the burger"" like most people do.  You don't need a whole burger to yourself, as the other dishes on this menu cannot be missed.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Without the lettuce and tomatoes, its basically a heart attack in a bun. And that was exactly what it was, except it didn't taste good. I understand that if the burger doesn't have veggies, then the meat would have to make up for it. The patty was bland and dry. The sauce that was suppose to add a ZING to it was almost nonexistent.

I rarely wait longer than 45 mins for a restaurant and when they quoted us 90 mins to 2 hours... I was hesitant. We walked around and got some drinks over at Employees Only and came back. It was well worth the wait. Food was great. They were out of a few things by the time we sat down that I had my eye on- but that happens with a small restaurant. We had the pork pate (special that night) and pot of pickles to start. Among the table we got the steak salad, burger and the gnocci. All excellent. Dessert was just ok- flourless chocolate cake. I had wanted a tart that they were out of. I would pass on that cake next time.Overall though- solid restaurant with absolutely excellent service considering how busy it was while we were there.

I chose to eat at the bar even though the wait was also 45 minutes until my burger finally arrived. There was plenty of time to listen to Duran Duran and other tunes. I had lots of shoestring fries with a side of a little burger and bun. Sure it was thick but so small. I had to look between the buns to make sure there was a burger there. No onions, no lettuce nor tomato. Whatever sauce that was used tasted good but not worth the $22 spent on it. The shoestring fries are awkward to eat. I was wondering do I use a fork or my hands. I declined the bottle of ketchup because there's no conceivable way to dip the super thin fries in it.

Two hours and two bottles of prosecco later, we got called back and swayed over. It was my first time sitting upstairs which was fun, its a little roomier than downstairs. We got a bunch of different bar snacks with our wine - definitely recommend the chicken liver on toast and the scallops wrapped in bacon. For our mains, we were very boring and all got the burger.

Not only is it the most affordable thing on the menu ($17), but they sure make sure you get your moneys worth. The burger is perfect, and the Roquefort cheese makes it so...and the overloaded frites tossed with rosemary are unforgettable. My favorite fries in the city so far. Great selection of beers, wine and specialty cocktails. I love how they serve SF 21st Amendment beer, so cool. The menu is as eclectic as the decor, which I feel ties into the theme of everything nicely. The decor feels very hipster yet old New York.

Unfortunately, I could never again justify paying $4 for ONE egg, even if it's deviled. $4 should buy you two dozen eggs! The veggies are amazing, especially the roasted carrots. How you ask? It is cooked/roasted to perfection and sprinkled with fresh herbs. I could've finished the platter by myself, but sadly I had to share.My entree was the special for the day w/ crispy pig's ear. Pig's ear is pretty common in Chinese cooking so I was hoping for something similar. That was a silly thought of course because The Spotted Pig serves British cuisine and of course the pig's ear is fried. Being fried, it just tasted very fatty. This is not to say it wasn't good, it was just not what I expected and I'm not sure I would get it again. I still continued to devour my plate.After reading all the yelp reviews for the spotted pig, my friend who loves blue cheese ordered the burger and of course, loved it. I am pretty indifferent about blue cheese so the burger was okay for me. It was definitely juicy but meh, it's blue cheese. The bottom line is this - It's a great burger but you won't enjoy it if you don't like the cheese.

I have too agree with many of the other people here who say that this place is OVERRATED. It is not overrated due to price though, I am from SF and am very used to overpriced food, but rather due to how good the food is.We started with 3 orders of deviled eggs, and a plate of Bouchot Mussels with Tomato & Herbs.The eggs were not as good as what you can make at home, even if you have never made them. They had no flavor and tasted like parsley or whatever they had sprinkled on them. There were like 2 little millimeter chunks of bacon on each half egg. The muscles were in a good sauce and tasted great.For dinner I got the burger, my girlfriend and her sister both got the Crispy Pork Belly in Broth with Fall Vegetables & Pumpkin Fritters.The burger was cooked the way I asked, but it is no better than what you will get at burger bar or jenny's giant burger. The fries looked cool, but were hella oily and super salty, which I did not appreciate.I tried some of their pork belly, which was not crispy at all; it was actually very soggy and chewy. The portion size of the crispy pork belly is a joke. Look at all of the pictures of the burger posted here now imagine that burger cut into fourths, and that is the portion size of the pork belly.

The wait was lengthy (1 hour on the dot, just as they told me on arrival), though it was enjoyed thoroughly across the street at Orient Express.  When I saw the famous backless stools (really, they are tiny), I sympathized just a smidge with people who actually care about things like that. And then.... THE FOOD. Like, what WHAT!? We had the 2 most iconic dishes on the menu. The beautiful, bloody burger with Roquefort and shoestring fries was just as good as advertised. But the real champion at this gastro pub is without fail, THE GNUDI. As in, this is a 5 star dish. As in, this was the best thing I've tasted in at least a year.

I dare say I often fall victim to judging a restaurant from its website but this time the praise is well deserved--the FAQ section immediately addressed my primary concern: Can a vegetarian enjoy Spotted Pig? Yes!! Thank you April for thinking of us!Came here for brunch today and got the grilled cheese. There was a good number of other veggie options but i wanted to go with something British and it was as good as any Ploughman's lunch I had in London. The onion chutney was especially good. Wish they sold it separate :( At $16 it's def pricey but boy was it worth it. The mustards a bit too spicy and the side salad was over salted, but the sandwich itself was perfect. My friend got the Dutch baby and said the syrup was cold but otherwise good. From the looks of it, it's definitely more crepe like than pancake but the amount of bacon on it made it look more than substantial.Oh, There's a super cute art gallery across the street, and Myers of Keswick, a British grocery store, isn't too far away if you want to keep the British theme running.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Don't get me wrong the food is good, but it's not worth the price. A coworker suggested we go down to this place one night. Once we got there, there was a bit of a wait so we just 'hung out' by the bar until two bar tops came available. We ordered a bottle of wine because it was about $2 cheaper to buy by the glass. I ordered a dish with calamari and a side of the shoestring fries. The fries come out like a small mountain atop of the plate- they look as delicious as they taste. The bartender was somewhat attentive. It is a pretty happening place so I guess there were far more interesting things to keep their attention. Although my glass did stay empty for at least ten minutes, which is disappointing in this kind of setting.The look- The Spotted Pig is kind of cool looking. The outside, first off, is darling with Ivy vines going along side the building. Aside from the brick, it looks quite cottage in the middle of a city. The inside is fairly simple- bar, tables, booths and an upstairs (I didn't go up there though).So in the end, this isn't my first choice at all because it's not budget friendly.

Friends in from out of town? check. Hot date? check (a lot of the tables you get to sit next to eachother and get cozy not shout across a table and overhear everyone's dates going on around you - this is a major +1 on the dating front). Birthday gathering? check. Catching up with close peeps? well, you get the picture. However, they don't take resies so be prepared to wait and I'd suggest taking a large crew elsewhere. Food is great too! The Burger (everyone else has already commented) is great with the shoestring fries (a major food +1 - heaping piles of tasty fries). Devils on Horseback are a-maz-ing and deviled eggs are fab as well. I've had the striped bass and it was good but the burger is better. Service is good, everyone is very friendly.

Said it was amazing. 5. The runners and hosts all were very nice. Lowlights: 1. Very long wait and no reservations can be made. Waited 90 minutes for a table on a bench outside. 2. Tight fit. They have to pull the tables in an out for you to get in. 3. Our server was not very friendly. She did not ask how thing were or check in with us at all. Really was a great meal.

I came here with a few friends for lunch after hearing rave reviews about the restaurant, and having had a great experience at its sister venue, The Breslin. We started off well, with a really delicious lemonade and friendly waitstaff - and were easily seated upstairs. Our waiter was very friendly and explained the dishes thoroughly, which was also great.And then we waited.And waited.And waited.And waited.And waited.And it became apparent after about forty minutes of waiting for our meal that the food had been delayed or something, BUT we couldn't find out what happened. Our waiter was suddenly avoiding us (the restaurant was half empty, so it's not as though they had heaps of people ordering and giving them the run around) - seriously, not even making eye contact - and the other waiters on the floor were also skirting around us as well without comment. Eventually we were told that our food was ""on its way up""... and then it didn't come for another 20 minutes. This is about an hour after we ordered our meal. Not cool.Once the meal arrived - and yes, the food was delicious - there was no apology or comment about the lateness of the food arriving. I'd usually expect at least an apology or a reason as to why it took an hour to serve up a sandwich, but there was nothing. Zip. Zilch. Nada.It's a real shame to have had such a negative first experience of the Spotted Pig, particularly after having heard so much about the venue. Although the food was really yummy when we eventually got it, the fact that our meals didn't arrive for the better part of an hour - without reason or apology - put a real dampener on the situation.

Insider tip if you don't want to wait for hours to eat at the Spotted Pig- come during the week for lunch. I came on a Tuesday afternoon and walked right in. As always the staff was very pleasant and easy going. There is something very relaxing about The Spotted Pig during the day when its not a mob scene. It's in a great neighhborhood and you can just sit back, relax, and enjoy a delicious burger while the sunlight streams in through the windows.On this day I had a view into the kitchen, which is always cool. The burger was taking longer than expected, so they gave me some spicy almonds with honey to dip as a complimentary treat. Very nice of them. These were a very tasty little treat while I waited.The first thing you notice is the insane mound of fries that come with the burger. Check my pic for reference. I am usually not a skinny fries type of guy but these were addictively good. I feared they would have the texture of those potato sticks you get in the super market but not the case. They magically manage to keep they crispy, yet soft on the inside. And I loved the little fried slices of garlic dispersed throughout. One thing they know how to do is cook your burger. I ordered rare and it came perfectly rare. A nice two handed burger with a fat 10 ounce patty, which is the way it should be. Terrific soft, spongy roll which has some cool grill marks. The burger itself is terrific, but beware if you do not like blue cheese you will not like this burger as the roquefort is quite strong. I had my doubts that it may overpower the burger, and while certain bites when you got a moutful of cheese did the majority of the experience was delicious.

What a nightmare of an evening - not to mention expensive.  kayne needs to stick with music and not venture into critiquing food. He obviously is being feed cuisine outside the menu of The Spotted Pig or just promoting the joint for his buddy Jay Z.  The service from the wait staff was deploy able.  A member of the bar staff prepared the appetizers, which was directly across from where I was seated.  I witnessed him licking his fingers one moment and picking up egg whites for the deviled eggs seconds later.  Disgusting.  Our waitress Sopha D was rude and dismissive. She took our order and 1.5 hours late, after flagging her down, she stopped by out table and when I asked when our entree would be delivered, she curtly stated ""it's coming"".  25 minutes later, it was delivered.   No drinks,empty water glasses for over an hour.   Finally our entrees arrived - skirt steak and skate.  OMG - my friend and I each took a bite of our entrees which we had waited over 2 hours for - and choked.  The Spotted Pig should be named The Salt Lickn.1. A natural deposit of exposed salt that animals lick.2. A block of salt, often with added minerals or vitamins, set out for animals such as cattle, horses, sheep, or deer to lick.We attempted to call Sophia D over, as neither of us could believe that our meals were intentionally salted to the extent of being inedible.  Sophia D would look at us - turn the other direction.  We were finally able to get our check - paid - no tip.   Left the Salt Lick aka The Spotted Pig - starving as hadn't yet eaten and paid $245 to get out of our nightmare and went to a pizza joint - which was fantastic , great service and $65 with drinks and a full belly of a delicious meal. Because of this terrible and expensive experience, I looked at previous yelp reviews and found the there were numerous reviews with the same experience as I had encountered.  I find it amazing that the management and owners of this restaurant take no heed to the yelp reviews.  It is quite apparent that the years of hype due to the ownership of The Salt Lick aka The SPotted Pig by Jay Z and Mario Batali - and their connected Twitter friends - supersedes edible cuisine and customer service.The worst food and experience.   Would not recommend to anyone - maybe cattle though.

Overall, the place is too busy for its own good. The staff is overwhelmed to the point of defensiveness, which leads to miscommunication, extended waits, and food that isn't cooked as requested. My boyfriend and I had been planning on going to TSP for a while, and a recent special occasion warranted the journey - and the wait. The 1.5-2-hour wait we were told to expect wasn't a surprise. They kindly took our name and phone number and said we would be texted when the table was ready. ""But be sure to be here in 10 minutes,"" they told us rather ominously. ""Or you'll lose your table."" Easy.We found a pleasant bar two blocks away to post up until then. A little over 2 hours passed when we finally got the text. We'd already closed our tab in preparation, but finished the remaining halves of our beers quickly so that we'd make it in time. 5 minutes later, we were back inside TSP.The host (I'll simply call them Host) welcomed us after we returned. ""Your table will be ready soon."" Time passes, we're shuffled around as food/patrons zip by. After 10 minutes we look back at the Host, attempting to make eye contact. Host is overwhelmed by the crowd, but instead of saying, ""We're running a little behind,"" they get defensive. ""Calm down, your table's almost ready."" Calm down! We were calm before being told to calm down, but now we were certainly annoyed. ""It's fine,"" I said, ""But we finished our beers pretty quickly to get here because we were told we'd lose our table after 10 minutes...and it's been over 10 minutes."" The host again laughed us off. ""Once I saw you were tall I decided to wait for *another* table to open up that you could fit in."" I'm a tall guy, but am no giant, and have never in my life been given special accommodations at a restaurant for my height? Plus, all the tables were fairly similar? We turned and kept waiting.""We should leave,"" my boyfriend said. We considered it, but another employee showed up, offering us beers paid for by Host. We accepted and waited. Made eye contact with Host again, who joked again about how we needed to calm down. Again, what? We were standing still, whispering to each other. In what world is that not keeping calm? Host was acting like we were standing on tables loudly telling the room of the injustices we had just faced by The Spotted Pig for not serving us promptly. We were just mad about having to chug beers to make their deadline, only to wait an additional 20 minutes. Something that is...pretty objectively annoying? Especially considering this was a place with an expensive $21 burger - not the kind of food we'd normally buy?Our beers show up and we look at Host and thank them. More comments about waiting for the table where I will allegedly ""fit."" ""I bought you a round of drinks because you had to 'finish your beers so quickly,'"" Host said with a weird attitude.""Do you not believe us?"" I asked. ""We ran here because we were told to, and have been waiting 20 minutes for a table. People who showed up well after we did have been seated before us."" ""I gave them your table because you were too tall and I was TRYING to be polite.""At that point we almost walked out, but then another person appeared and showed us to our table.""Best table in the house,"" Host said as we walked off.We were taken to a corner booth in the back. In a room filled with tables and chairs of equal size, we were placed in what was, quite literally, the *only* bad seat for two tall people. Knee to knee in a tight booth. Had we not been told this was chosen for us purposefully, I wouldn't have cared, but because it was a ""favor,"" I was furious. Was it some weird retribution for complaining? Was it a simple mistake of Host accidentally giving someone else our table, realizing it was a mistake, and having to wait for something else to open up? Whatever the case, we were furious. And hungry. We didn't order any more drinks and got straight to the burgers.We ordered two burgers, both medium rare. They showed up, both rare. Red. Raw. We picked at our fries, ate half the undercooked burgers, and asked for the check.Our server was confused. ""Was everything not to your liking?""""Not really. But we'll just take the check.""""Nothing else I can get you?""""No thanks.""We paid and walked to the front of the restaurant, where Host asked how our meal was.""Pretty awful. We won't be coming back."" We weren't lying.If you're looking for a popular place in the West Village to get a good burger for a special occasion, choose Minetta Tavern instead. You may have to reserve far in advance, but the table will be ready on time, the staff is friendlier, the burger will be cooked to perfection, and the fries, well, aren't a complete joke.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"
1421,OvqfMKGL-2APK-gh1kHAyA,Denise D.,5.0 star rating,"I'm giving this place a 5 solely based on the burger.  It is a beautifully cooked moist patty toped with melted Roquefort cheese, in between a grilled bun that holds up so well to the meaty fatty drippings without getting soggy.  It was the perfect bun to patty ratio, and completely made me forget the usual toppings (lettuce, tomatos, pickles, etc) that I prefer with my burgers.  Oh and the huge pile of addicting shoestring fries - the rosemary was a brilliant addition! I want my fries with rosemary all the time now!  I did try some other menu items such as the deviled eggs and chicken liver toast. Both were good but nothing notable.  The beers were pricey but large, and my stout perfectly balanced the greasy meal.  The only issue I had with the place is the cramped dining room and long wait, but that definitely will not deter me from coming back for the burgers!",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

1423,PG1sGQlkZMjsA_VyiV7jLg,Stephanie Y.,2.0 star rating,"Quite honestly, I know see why the fuss is about.  Maybe it's because April Bloomfield has become a rising star in the male dominated culinary arena.  I think this joint is better for hanging out, versus actually dining but maybe I'm just not so hot on the Gastropubs.  The place is REALLY noisy (almost like you need to shout to your neighbor across the way) on a Sunday night, which again makes it better for a bar scene vs. food. As for the bar snacks, I would say the Chicken Liver Toast was jamming-- seems that Bloomfield is good with this kind of whipped delight/bread combo (a la her Onion and Bone Marrow Soup at the Breslin), and the Deviled Eggs were good. Let's just say that I expected a way better overall dining experience for such a long wait.  Protip: come at 4:30 to sign up for the earliest dinner spot, and come no more than 4 people max- the wait time is still 30 minutes or so.  Anyway, I did enjoy the ambiance and the decor.  The atmosphere is grungy-- still trendy but sort of like an upscale hipster place.  The waiters are waltzing around in Def Leopard T shirts and they suck.  (It's true, baaad service. Our waiter was impatient with us, and didn't even bother to ask if we wanted dessert- hmpfh).Okay, so the best item seems to be the Burger. I know I'm sort of cheating in this Yelp review because *I* don't eat red meat, but I'll admit it looked pretty damn good.   The shoe string fries were way better on paper than in person though- they were so thin, it felt like eating...nothing.  I had the chorizo stuffed quail which was 1) a teeeeny tiny portion and 2) gross.  The chorizo was gritty and flavorless- and the quail had NO meat, just the bone!   It's also ridiculous to charge $17 for most of the salads, but that's just me. I've heard it's a better place for brunch.  When the desserts better than the dinner, you know it's a bad place. (But since you made it that far, for dessert, have the Walnut, Chocolate and Amaretto Cake and/or the Flourness Chocolate Cake - which is VERY DENSE just fyi).",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

We had about a 40-minute wait, and killed most of it with a short walk around the block and some time at the bar.When we were finally seated, we were told that there was only one burger left - my friend ended up ordering it, but I find that disappointing, since we weren't there at a late hour at all. In the end, my friend said his burger was amazing, and the fries that come with it was fantastic as well. Shame that no one else that evening had a chance to try it, especially because it's supposed to be one of the best.I ordered the Gnudi, which was awesome! It's one of the best things I've had at any restaurant, albeit it was a little bit rich. The deviled eggs as an appetizer were great as well.I knocked the stars off because (1) their best dish had run out, (2) the service was uneven. I received my main course about 5 or 6 minutes after my friend, and (3) we were seated next to an obnoxious couple (though that wasn't necessarily the restaurant's fault, but it didn't help).

1435,K4ehiUJlLbeBcVttJTfZ_g,Jeffrey R.,4.0 star rating,"Let me start by saying that I absolutely love the food at The Spotted Pig. That alone will keep me coming back! The main draw back is the fact that they do not take reservations so you have to come in and hope for the best. The other draw back is the bar areas, both downstairs and upstairs, are so small and cramped that waiting for your table becomes unpleasant. Granted, I'm at an age when this type of bar scene just is not appealing anymore but still it definitely detracts from the overall experience of The Spotted Pig. Once you've been seated at your table, its a much more enjoyable atmosphere. The waitstaff is knowledgeable and friendly and prompt. They don't rush you along in anyway, which is great. The fact that the tables are rather close together can be great (we engaged with the people on both sides of us a little and it was wonderful) or it can be not so great if you want a more intimate evening (if you do, don't go to The Spotted Pig). But it's all about the food! Great British fare that is exciting and new and delicious. The Devils on Horseback were amazing (dates, wrapped in bacon): sweet and salty with a hint of heat from red chilis. Also love the Deviled Eggs. I had the Pork Rilliette: pork shoulder with white wine and garlic and duck fat! So rich and complex and one of the best I've had. I followed that with the Guinea Hen they had on special. Fantastic as well, though maybe a touch salty. We will return and brave the wait for a table because the food is that good!",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Even though this was a quiet Tuesday afternoon.Our order consisted of two of the 'famous' burgers, a seared char and the special of the day, prosciutto in pastry dough. The amount of string fries, that come with the burgers, was overwhelming - the burgers also big. But all you can taste is that cheese... Do they ever eat these things themselves? Go to Bareburger for a proper burger with blue cheese.The two other dishes were tiny, the special served with no sides, unless five arugula leaves count. The dough and dried ham taste good because they're so fat and salty, not because this place tries hard.For desert we had a flourless chocolate cake, a caramel pudding (don't remember the name, don't remember too much about that dish either). The chocolate cake was much to dense - and there was soooo much of it. Without sour raspberries or relish to help it along, it's almost a disgusting desert.This place is not a pub, nor is it a great place to dine - and it is most certainly not worth any mention by Michelin.

Upon arrival (at 10:30 pm on a Thursday) we (party of 2) entered the very bustling gastropub and elbowed our way to the host stand. We were told we would have an hour wait for the table so we grabbed a glass of wine at a wine bar down the street and they called us within 45 minutes to tell us our table was ready. The tables are pretty close together and the limited space is even more cramped with the crowds of people congregated at the bar - anxiously awaiting for you to finish so they can sit, but everyone seemed excited to be there - as we were. We started with the Pig Ear salad to share. A.m.a.z.i.n.g. I was a little nervous at first, but its like extra crispy bacon. Just go with it, trust. Next I had the braised lamb. The multitude of flavors were perfectly complimentary to one another and the whole dish satisfied my every taste bud. My fiancée had the Pork Belly and we spent the entirety of our meal arguing over who made the better order. By the time it came for desert, we were absolutely stuffed so we passed (very rare occurrence with us).All in all, a great experience with fantastic food, unobtrusive and attentive service, and the people watching to boot.

I apologetically got the attention of our bartender/server Paul and let him know that maybe there was a mistake but my burger was incredibly salty and could I get another. This is probably the third time in my life I've sent something back. I just feel like its rude. Maybe the chef has a different sensibility than I do. Bu this time it was just so salty it was obvious. Paul made me feel like I was an idiot. Like he could barely believe I was doing such a thing. 10 minutes goes by, 20 minutes goes by, after 30 I asked if my meal would be out soon and he told me he never put it in. Okay, maybe another accident, but then he sneered: should we put no salt on it because you thought it was so salty last time? I was really shocked. Why put your customer on the back foot and defense for something that is so subjective and that was probably just an accident? It took another 30 minutes for the burger to come out.

Meat was excellent, and the roquefort cheese provided a welcome bite. Only negative was the amount of bread, which, while deliciously toasted, slightly overpowered the burger itself. The fries were amazing though. Not a single negative, and if hadn't been 90 degrees out today, I probably would have cleaned the plate.Service was superb. Not rushed and very friendly.There isn't a huge beer selection on tap, and I would caution against ordering the spotted pig bitter. It was really unpleasant.Also of note, the bathroom is VERY cramped, which leads to some awkward side-stepping while you stare pointedly at the ground to avoid the glance of the man or woman who was just making those god awful noises in the stall you were necessarily leaning against while using the sink.

1450,Get12P1Zy7wwaQEBOBie2A,Francesca T.,4.0 star rating,"I had a really hard time deciding whether to give this place three or four stars. My whole entire reasoning for going was to have this famous burger that everyone talks about. As it turns out, it was my least favorite part of the entire meal. They don't take reservations but I got there at 7pm on a Wednesday night and was greeted with a 90 minute wait. Luckily my friend just came up with the idea to stalk the bar and wait for people to get up and leave. We did just that and were sitting within 20 minutes. The atmosphere is pretty cool but you can tell this is a place everyone goes to after work.Onto the food, we ordered the Devils on Horseback (bacon wrapped prune with stuffed poached pear) and Chicken Liver Toast. The Devils had to be one of the greatest appetizers/snacks I've ever had. The first words that came out of my mouth were ""this makes so much sense"" and it absolutely did. I understand the concept of sweet and salty, but never did I think a prune, pear, and bacon would mix. It's brilliant. I don't even like pears and I couldn't stop eating them. The chicken liver toast was pretty interesting, but I guess the texture kinda creeped me out a bit. The flavor is there but I wouldn't necessarily order it again.We got two burgers to split between three people and the first thing you notice are the amount of shoestring fries. The fries were perfect and seasoned with garlic and herbs. The burger itself was cooked very well and was very juicy, but it's the cheese that kills it. The roquefort is just too strong to have on top of a burger. I litterally just ate every part that didn't contain cheese. And the smell is not very good either.For dessert we ordered the Popcorn Ice Cream and the Bonaffee pie. I'm not a big fan of popcorn to begin with but it's definitely worth a try if you're into obscure flavored ice cream. The pie, however, was insane. It contains thin and even layers of bananas and dulce de leche with little dollops of whipped cream on top and chocolate shavings. Very much reminded me of the Bananas-in-a-Box from China Grill (my favorite dessert in NYC), so I was INSANELY happy when I had my first bite. If it weren't for the Devils on Horseback and the incredible pie, I would have gone for three stars.

1452,EQPgp_WluL6Ufl7KZ7S0Sw,Dan R.,4.0 star rating,"I'm pretty sure the interior of The Spotted Pig is exactly how I want my brownstone to look when I become rich and insane. Each bar stool is upholstered in different, yet eclectic fabric patterns while still maintaining their masculinity. Quirky frame after quirky frame adorn the walls in an organized chaos, an exhibit all its own that requires multiple viewings as if this were a modern art museum. Even a trip upstairs to the second floor seems to wring character out of the gutted home in which The Spotted Pig now resides with its every inch being put to good, New York-cramped use.And then, if this were truly my domain, I'd invite my mother over and wait for her to faint while she gasps at the intentional color-miscoordination and claustrophobia-inducing visual overload, when she can finally convince herself that her son is a full-blown hippie. Now, I am pretty far from being any sort of hippie, but being under thirty, living in New York City, and seeing nothing wrong with having two different types of chairs at the same table - to my mother, I'm a hippie.But I didn't come here to discover new ways to scare my mother half to death. I came here for the burger. Of course. And their Char-grilled Burger ($17) is an exceptional block of meat, soft, flavorful and juicy, luxuriously complimented by the melted roquefort cheese. Now, if you like roquefort, look no further, this is your burger. If you could go with something a little less sharp and a little less stinky given the choice (The Spotted Pig does not give you this choice), their highly-touted burger in its current form will by no means turn you off, but it may fall a bit short of the perfect patty your taste-buds had in mind. Now, as I fall into this latter category, I don't know if this speaks more to my general intrigue regarding the rest of the menu (Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi! Lamb Crepinette! Something called Roll Mops!*) or if the burger, despite being fantastic, suffers from a ridiculously high level of hype it was doomed to live up to. The shoestring fries that come with it are matchstick-thin, crispy, and probably fried in the fat of a Fatosaurus Rex or something because only the fat of some extinct, possibly entirely made-up animal could produce a taste this delicious. I wouldn't argue with the man who came here for the burger and returned for the fries. As for me? I'm coming back for both.*OK, the Roll Mops are pickled herrings.

A pile of fries that are bigger than your face... so you know it's tasty. LOVED this place.The Food: Whatever you do - SOME ONE AT YOUR TABLE MUST GET THE BURGER AND FRIES!!! I'm not much of a meat eater myself... but watching a burger lover hoover The Spotted Pig burger was one of the greatest things I have ever seen. And those fries - THOSE FRIES!! Amaze. I ate the entire plate and at the end, the only thing I could think was that I should have ordered two. Side note - I actually got the sea bass and it was eeeemazing as well!!The Location: It's super loud, super crowded, super hip - The simplest way to describe this place is just plain fun. GREAT atmosphere nestled in a great neighborhood. While you wait for your table (and believe me, wait you will...) meander around the neighborhood for a few (great cafes/bars nearby for drinks), but make sure you get back to The Spotted Pig and enjoy some of your wait time at their bar too. It's packed and crazy and a blast! Also... watching the waiters carrying those teetering plates of fried potato awesomeness really makes you hungry...The Service: All of the waiters are nice, interesting and unique - they all totally fit the ""cool hipster"" vibe. Heads up - the place was so packed that even after we waited two hours for our table, we had to wait another hour just to eat. But I still give this place 5 stars... so clearly the wait was worth it.The Price: 17$ for a burger... do with that what you wil. For the quality, tastiness, and fries on the side I say it's a bargain.

The draught beer menu was limited, only about 4-5 beers.  But they did have a good cocktail list.  As for food, it looks like the menu changes daily since there was the date on the top of the menu.  The dinner menu was very gastropuby and different.We ordered the devils on horseback (amazing as always) and the chicken liver toast.  The chicken liver toast was a little mineral-tasting, so if you don't like the taste of liver, I wouldn't order it, but I thought it was fantastic.  I had a winter green salad which was very good and my friend ordered the fried duck egg salad which was phenomenal.  My friend and I then decided to split the burger and shoestring fries.  We ordered the burger medium and it was cooked perfectly.  The waiter said that some people say its the ""best burger they've ever had.""  I'll agree it was a good burger, but probably not the best I have ever had.  The shoestring fries were good as well.  They were flavored with salt and fresh rosemary.   For dessert we got the banoffee pie.  I was skeptical because sometimes bananas can be funky in desserts but this was absolutely amazing.  We finished it and I wanted more!Now, about our waiter, he was kind of pretentious.  We have never been here before so we were asking questions about the menu and his tone of voice for his answers were along the lines of, ""well why don't you know this.""

The closest contact I've come with them is when I watched Ariane make deviled eggs on Top Chef (""How do you expect to win with deviled eggs?!"" says Tom Colicchio)...but I digress. The eggs were delicious....mustardy and vinegary. Just the way I guess I should like deviled eggs.II. Chargrilled Burger w/ ""shoestrings""We shared this bad boy.

No freaky soggy fries in the mess that they put on your plate. And they have garlic chips in them, too, if you dig around enough. They're kind of awkward to eat though...I ended up clawing at them and picking them up 10 at a time. What's a girl to do? III. Chicken Liver ToastBEST PART OF THE MEAL!

So many famous manhattan restaurants are just sitting back on their laurels and not getting it done anymore. That's my experience anyway. I was equally disappointed at minetta tavern another absurdly hyped joint but at least minetta tavern didn't take nearly as long to get the food on a plate and in front of me. Here is my summation if you don't want to read me wax obnoxious for many moons: it's good not great and for the wait and price and pretense, I think tourists would miss out going here rather than other less hyped spots who deliver at a lower price (and won't make you wait). My girlfriend and I went. It was 6:30 on a week day so we had no wait which was surprising and cool. We got the pot of pickles which I always hope is actually pickles but as in other places was just random veggies soaked in vinegar. Boo.Their smoked haddock chowder was pretty stellar, I admit it. I hate smoked fish generally, worst jew in the land, black sheep of my people because i refuse to even acknowledge the presence of lox, but still, this soup was so well balanced and tasty with herbs and cream, it even passed my test. Well done, Spotted Pig. Unfortunately, the soup was the highlight. After the soup, we waited maybe 30-45 minutes for my burger and my girl's ""gnudi"" which is just a fancy word for a half-dozen mediocre possibly-fried round ravioli. It took FOREVER. Everything was extremely salty. When my burger arrived, it was medium I'd say (I'd ordered medium well) which was ok but meant to me they'd put it on the grill something like 10-20 minutes after we'd finished the soup. At best. We suddenly postulated that the reason this place appears to have such an insane wait is not because it's so incredibly popular and frequented by everyone in town, perhaps, but because their kitchen is really really really slow. Maybe even at the managers' behest to make it look like they're special and busier than they are.Onto the burger, first of all with famous burgers I order however they offer it because I want to experience the chef's vision. M. Wells' vision for instance (grilled onions, pickles, jersey ketchup, no cheese) was a friggin' revelation the likes of which I've never experienced anywhere else. Sorry. I digress. About Spotted Pig's burger. I think any kind of blue cheese is wasted on a burger or more clearly, it wastes the burger. It is too strong such that it masks the flavor of the beef. The beef was probably very good, but I could only get glimpses of it while roquefort assaulted my senses. Also, shoestring fries are not a satisfying fry in my opinion. I want potato-ey goodness not (again) glimpses of flavor. I'm a steak fry guy, though, so feel free to ignore my opinion in this matter. But straight-up: the burger was just good. Nothing special. Finally, on service and ambience. Very tight in there and dark. When the people next to us tried to leave, it was so cramped that the dude knocked over my glass of water. I was impressed with the staff's professionalism in cleaning it up. They removed everything from our table even though it was a minor spill, and re-set everything within 2 minutes. Crisply executed. Still, it was very cramped in there and not just tables. Dark and knicknacks and weird stuff on the walls, it all felt dark cramped and just wasn't pleasing to my senses personally. It was cozy, I admit, maybe this place would be better in dead of winter, but in early fall not place I want to sit for 1.5 hours waiting for a burger to arrive. We did not order dessert because we just wanted out. Luckily, Magnolia was close by and still open.

As soon as I stepped off the subway, I ran towards Spotted Pig where I saw my friend waiting at the corner.  I asked if she already put her name down on the list but said she didn't.Oh well as we walked in and spoke with the hostess who told us luckily, the wait would be 10 minutes after writing my name down.  However, she decided there was actually a table upstairs and a gentleman led us up immediately.  PERFECT.Spotted Pig reminded me of those Old British pubs.  They didn't have mahagany paneling but dark magenta walls lined with tasteful British knick-knacks.I inadvertently made a comment stating, ""That's our table?"" when I saw a rather cramped looking round table against a booth and the gentleman quickly asked if this table was ok.My friend said it was fine as we were seated next to each other rather face to face.We immediately received our menus and had 2-3 different waiters attend to us. One taking our orders for our drinks and another one coming by later to ask about our order.  My friend really wanted pork but  didn't see any on the menu since it was still brunch.Our waiter sensed something was  amiss and quickly told us there were specials and both of our eyes lit up.  He first talked about the ground up pig's face wrapped up and served with duck's egg and lima beans.  There was a second special but that went out our ears.Both my friend and I chose that dish along with unsweetened ice tea and fresh squeezed orange juice.  The fresh squeeze orange juice was $5 and was served in an 8oz glass which was rather disappointing since I saw my friend's iced tea served with sugarcubes for $3 and in a much larger serving of 18oz (give or take).Our plates came and were surprised it didn't come with toast or some type of bread to soak up the duck egg.  I immediately sliced into the pork and the richness was not as overwhelming as I expected.  It was light and went down easy settling well whereas other pork dishes I've had settled uneasily for me.The duck egg was definitely different and I can't put my finger on how to describe the taste of the yolk but let's just say, I wanted to try it again to have  a better feel of the taste.Our waitstaff was very attentive with 2 -3 different men checking to make sure we had enough water and asked about our food.Overall, our brunch experience went very well despite so many stories of the long wait time.  I would definitely come back and try the dinner menu!",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

We loved April on mind of a chef.It's getting there stars because the guys taking reservations in the front were dicks. Had us standing there waiting to put our names down for five minutes while they finished their giggling private convo. Is five mins the end of our world? No. Who cares. Just we weren't expecting this. Ordered the roll mops because our waiter said they were more than he ever expected to be based on the description....but these were utterly gross. The whole reason I'm writing this review is so that if I can save one person from ordering roll mops, I have made the world a better place. I like seafood...but Hell no. I don't know how many drinks down you'd have to be to get any pleasure from this.Got the burboun iced tea...was great. Also got a mimosa and aperol cocktail at the table...no complaints.Dishes..burrata, grilled cheese, dutch baby, shoestring fries, deviled eggs...all yummy. Was hoping for gnuddi but they only make this for dinner. Also our waiters were very nice. Was ok to try, don't know if id come again.

Never mind that many were served closed, too. We received a slice of toast with it but what was the point? There was no broth to be found.Shared the pig's ear salad. I love all things fatty, sweet, etc. It was so salty and so fattening that we could barely stomach it. Barely any greens. What a sad disappointment. I think that my bacon craze might be over. Yes, it was really that awful. When we mentioned the cold mussels to two waitstaff, they shrugged and said nothing. No one even bothered to check on us while we were eating, either, so after waiting over an hour, of course we were hungry and we ate what we could. This place has really gone downhill since the days that it first opened; I remember sitting next to ""Diddy"" and Jay Z. Funny how I didn't see them here, or anyone else of importance, either. Not that it matters, but still, what a difference! Someone told me, ""just get the burger and fries,"" but I'm sorry, there must be better burgers to be found in this city. I would not wait an hour on a Sunday for that! And so, I bid adieu, to you Spotted Pig, as I'm relieved that I will never have to wait in your over-hyped, non-ac'd establishment again.

My date and I got there and we were told it'd be a two-hour wait. ARE YOU KIDDING? But me, being a seasoned-pro eating at Minetta Tavern a fair amount, knew that this simply wasn't true. We walked to Art Bar to have a drink and got a call about an hour later, which was exactly what I predicted. I don't remember the name of the appetizer we got, but it was a special - buffalo mozzarella with bruschetta and roasted red peppers. The components were really excellent - exceptional cheese, quite honestly - but one little piece of toast? Come on. I'd like to be able to eat all the components together instead of eating globs of cheese and peppers alone. I ordered the pork belly, my date got the burger. The pork belly was delicious (duh) as were the sides it came with. I love it when the pork belly sticks to my teeth - it's like little treats for later!The burger was pretty good, too. I don't really like blue cheese at all whatsoever, but it complimented the burger well. The bun was sweet and the flavors blended well all together in my mouth. I would probably get a different cheese if I ever go back and order the burger. I was truly surprised when I ate the burger because people have told me it was their favorite/the best. Minetta kicks its ass any day, sorry Spotted Pig. Also, one star knocked off because I really did not like the atmosphere there. That was the part that I mentioned earlier - it not being what I expected. It was decorated well but I felt pretty crammed. ALSO, I DON'T WANT TO SIT ON A FUCKING BAR STOOL ALL NIGHT. I'd really like to sit in a chair with a back while I enjoy my meal. If I wanted to eat on a bar stool, I'd not have waited an hour and I'd have sat at the bar. Sorry, but that really irked me.

Cons: The restaurant is very small and there is limited space for mingling upstairs. With that being said, a server upstairs, who I am told was named Sean, was very rude and did not acclimate to the crowded bar area well unlike other servers. He was very demanding and inappropriate to guests that were just trying to grab a drink at the bar during their hour and a half wait.

Entrees:3 of us ordered the burgers.  They were very good but the cheese was too salty.  We all were in agreement.  The rosemary shoestring fries were addicting though.Pork Belly-Loaded with fat and grease.  A little too heavy and too much fat for our taste.  Flavorful too.Desserts:Flourless Chocolate Cake-Heavy but pretty good.Creme Caramel-The better of the 2 desserts. Good balance, perfect palate cleanser.Overall, we really liked the place but we ate WAAAY too much.  My wife can't eat anything off the menu, well maybe the deviled eggs so I won't be returning with her but when some good buddies want to check it out, i'll definitely return.  Service was good too, the only downfall was that the place was every packed and small but hey, this is NYC.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

The Roquefort burger was cooked well but the cheese was overbearing. I had originally asked to change the cheese knowing I didn't like the blue cheese flavor, but apparently they don't allow it. I get that it's a $20 burger but you better make sure people will love it if you don't let people modify their food. I'm not against that kind of thing but just make sure ur diners will love the burger! Anyways we got the brussel sprouts and the gundi also which were both underwhelming. They even managed to screw up the shoe string fries which I normally love, but way too salty! I came here for the burger and it disappointed.

Let me first say, this was my first time EVER in the village. But I digress...I entered and sat at the bar. Got to looking over the menu and they seem to have a great selection of foods. I ordered the burger because people on yelp said it was great. It was, While I was waiting i sparked up a conversation with a older gentleman and his wife sitting next to me. They were in town from Ireland and recommended a beer, ""Old Speckled Hen"".  Which apparently is a ale that foams like a Guinness. It's amazing! I ate, my burger was BIG and amazing. Then got to chatting with the friendly bartender. Very nice and sociable, we talked about where he was from, I informed him I'm on vacation, and he actually gave me a few other bars to stop by.All n all, a GREAT little place in the village for a meal and a drink.

1519,9sdWq_CLAIt38Q2cSUS3rw,Terri R.,2.0 star rating,"I'm not sure how much future is in the stars for The Spotted Pig. While the 45 minute wait on a Tuesday night in August wasn't bad, given its reputation for very very long waits in this non-reservation accepting spot, I wouldn't have minded waiting a bit longer if it meant not being seated right at the kitchen door on a tiny little stool. That experience didn't make for a good beginning. While this place has certainly gotten its share of attention, thanks to its all-star lineup of founders and chefs, I think the light is fading. Everyone can have an off night, but when the famous April Bloomfield herself walks through the dining room, one wonders if she is too blinded by startlight that she doesn't see that the famous world-renowned burger you ordered medium is served raw. The huge pile of string fries tossed together in the fryer with rosemary and then doused with salt are good, but maybe not still worth all the media attention they have garnered. What else did we have? Oh yeah, a burrata with equally memorable disks of summer squash. A salad with a mix of endive and radicchio topped with long twisty bits of deep fried pigs ears was tasty, but a plate of cutely named 'devils on horseback' was, again, probably good in its day, but is now kind of bland blob of undercooked bacon wrapped around a tasteless prune. The black sea bass with grilled summer vegetables was spot on, perfectly cooked tender fish at just the right amount of doneness atop the light spot of butter sauce. The wine selection is not a focal point; the eponymous cask conditioned bitter ale is the right heft and temperature, but not hoppy enough to be called bitter. The room was funky a few years ago, but now feels like a theme restaurant. While the cool kids have all decamped to the East Village and Brooklyn--to be replaced by their distant cousins from post-happy hour Midtown--the upstairs room maintains a glimmer of its original trust-fund boho chic that drew in the crowds when the Spotted Pig became famous. If you go, ask for a table up there, that is if you can get the attention of the head in the stars searching for something anything please to back up this attitude I'm trying to throw at you hostess to seat you there. But then you have to deal with the bartender.

Alack, The Spotted Pig offered me only the latter, which isn't a bad thing, I just expected more. Apparently you're supposed to order the burger here. Do order it, especially if you like SALT. The roquefort cheese has a SALTY finish, and the frites are generously coated with SALT. I had to scrape the cheese off my burger about halfway through eating it, but even that wasn't enough. I then had to cut my burger in half, horizontally, and eat it open-faced. The meat was fine. That roquefort wasn't very pleasant, only because the frites just made it worse. Fortunately the cask beer was very tasty and it was the only thing I could wash it all down with (needless to say it took several pints). For an appetizer, I had the pot of pickles, which was lovely. I wish I had saved a few to fight the SALT battle I was waging against this ""famous"" burger. Go to Island Burger in Hell's Kitchen if you want a good burger. No, you won't see famous people there, but you'll enjoy your meal a whole lot more, I promise.The wait staff was...out of it., but also with it. My friend and I came at 1pm on a Tuesday and the place was barely over half capacity, yet it took her far too long to refill our drinks. She simply forgot. That's not acceptable in my book.After my friend and I left in a pouring rain, we headed for the White Horse Tavern down the block. As we sat at the bar stools, we were flagged down by an employee of The Spotted Pig, who had run out of the restaurant into the rain to search for us. My friend had left her shopping bag at our table! That was a nice touch, and sort of made up for the inattentive waitress. All said, the decor was nice, some of the food was okay, I can see how this kind of food is supposed to be ""good,"" but it was far too SALTY for me.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

In this case, I think the burger is still worth a try, but I'm not sure I'd go back for it, given the Roquefort. But what do I know (everything). Fun with a group, or intimate with a date.

Sheep's ricotta gnudi with brown butter & sage: Cheese and butter - how can you go wrong?2. Codfish balls (special): Tasty with an appropriate amount of breading, but portions were a bit small.3. Buffalo mozerella with freshly baked rye (special): Whilst buffalo mozerella is cheap and plentiful in most of Europe, it's the opposite here.  Nonetheless, the moment I heard it was offered, I had to order and I wasn't disappointed!  That the rye was fresh and tasty was an added bonus.4. Grilled beef tongue with duck fat potatoes and pIckled beets: I liked it, but didn't love it, and ordered it more because it's hard to find.  The potatoes melted in my mouth and wished they offered it as a regular side.5. Chargrilled burger with roquefort cheese & shoestrings fries: Only had a bite of the burger, but my friend claimed it was one of the best (and more expensive) burgers he's had.  The shoestring fries were truly ""shoestring"" in nature, which was pretty cool.6. Goat entree (special): Again, only had a bite, but my friend quite liked it.7. Beer!  A moderate selection of craft beers on tap and in bottle that were a bit overpriced at $8-12/bottle or pint.Service:-Friendly, playful, and enthusiastic staff.  Perfect match for the setting.Conclusion:-Every dish seemed to explode with flavour in its own way, and coupled with the bustling atmosphere and great service, it made for a very enjoyable dining experience.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

After waiting for the call from the Pig we arrived to be seated by a server who clearly did not want to work there, hospitality in the US isn't the holy grail of careers so I understand and I never really like to base my reviews on service style unless I'm basically assaulted. Browsing the menu looked like a good time, and we had a fine drop of beer, so no complaints about the booze situation. As our food arrived, we all noticed a substantial amount of bread with each meal - I don't know if this was pure coincidence or just the way the place rolls (pun?) but the dishes felt like they were mostly filler. There was also an exceptional amount of oil in each dish. So with the combination of mostly bread and oil I was quite full but in that gross bloated kind of way. To earn the star I guess someone came in on the right night because I certainly didn't get the same impression. I have the impression that once the star was awarded the staff and food just gave up and relied purely on punters hearing of its popularity.

That being said, here goes:Service:   how awesome is it when you go to restaurant and have such a naturally friendly and warm host? This guy was awesome, despite the packed house of hungry Halloween revelers, and me, with my ever-changing number of guests.  That was the stand out of the night. I do not have that kind of patience, so kudos to you, awesome host(s).  And of course our server was superb, too. Helpful, insightful and thorough. Oh, friendly, too. Food: Awesome. I know, I know. Everyone talks about the burger, everyone talks about the gnudi. Whatever. Both were fantastic.  I'm happily jumping right on that band wagon. And, as a girl who is sort of ""meh"" at the whole idea of shoestring fries in general... these fries are well worth it. The rosemary. The garlic. Need I say more? Well done, Spotted Pig. Wine/Beer: Unfortunately, I was in the middle of some pretty awful seasonal allergies, so I wasn't on my alcohol consumption A-game that night but... what I do remember was a pretty lovely red wine (vague, I know, but Zyrtec and wine make for a loopy end to the evening) and ending the evening a pint of Captain Lawrence...

And here's my review:ATMOSPHERE/AMBIANCE: All around the facade of the restaurant is what seems like a jungle...there were so many plants everywhere. We went for dinner, so I couldn't really appreciate whatever esthetic value this jungle was trying to achieve; what's nice is that there places to sit while you wait, and since The Spotted Pig doesn't take reservations, it's perf (the wait time when we got there was 45-50 minutes). Eclectic items, with the recurring theme of, you guessed it, PIG!, decorate this dim-lit restaurant. Make sure to check the BIG mirror for the ""Specials."" Where we sat, I had the a straight shot view of the buzzing kitchen, *apparently the hamburger is popular. The restaurant itself is bustling, noise level is between medium to loud, waiters, hostess, barback and customers are continuously walking around. The noise level was loud enough that when we would ask our waiter questions regarding the menu, I had to ask him to repeat himself or he will have to ask me to repeat my question. The restroom is sort of...awkward? There's no separate F/M restroom. One restroom, two stalls and a sink. I was washing my hands and one of the waiters came out from one of the stalls, I hardly had any room to wash my hands after he came out. FOOD:So here's what we ordered:Devils On Horseback - Eh. So the texture is sort of hmm...almost like babyfood. The bacon, doesn't even taste like bacon. There was no flavor and there were tiny bits here and there of crispy bacon which HELPED a lot to break that mushy babyfood texture. What I wish they would do: whatever they are doing that leaches the bacon flavor out, STOP it! And please, try to make the bacon crispy, the texture is just not happening. Sweet Corn Soup with Chanterelles - SCRUMPTIOUS!! Texture was solid, the taste was solid and the Chanterelles was a perfect complement to the texture of the corn soup.*I RECOMMENDSauteed Baby Squid with Cherry Tomatoes and Basil - DELICHE!! The squid could be tender, but the flavor of the dish overall is simple and refreshing. *I RECOMMENDSauteed Black Sea Bass with Summer Squash, Basil and Anchovy - HMM...OK. So, the veggies came out hot and the sea bass at room temperate (Whaaat?!). The anchovy pieces ruined the dish for me because a few of the bites I had were just too salty. The summer squash was scrumptious. The sea bass itself was cooked well (I was hoping the skin was crispy, but that's just me.) Halibut with Saffron Stewed Tomatoes, Lentils and Gaeta Olives - HMM...OK. My BF had this and he said ""it was alright."" The halibut was cooked well also. There were crispy bits, and we weren't sure what they were but it was a nice complement to the halibut when eaten together. SERVICE:Our waiter, Chris, was attentive and answered our questions regarding the menu. Our plates were promptly removed after we were done. Chris, noticed how long we have been waiting for our entree and assured us, after (at least it's what it felt like) 20 minutes, it's coming out soon. The wait time in between our meals was ridiculous! I mean, we took our time to eat our appetizers, more so than usual because we usually eat on a ""good pace"" (EAT MORE!-TALK LESS!-Savor when needed type of pace). After the Devils on Horseback, it took another 10-15 minutes for our Sweet Corn Soup and Sauteed Baby Squid to come out and 20-30 minutes for our entrees thereafter. (The table next to us, who were seated 30 minutes after we were, got their entrees at the same time as ours!!!). And to make our dining experience unpleasant, the difference in the food temperature was definitely a no-go! ABSTRACT:OverallATMOSPHERE/AMBIANCE: 4.5/5 (since I was unable to communicate with our waiter well) FOOD: 3/5 - the plates were better than our entrees, overall missed the mark. I was hoping there would be more pork dishes available.SERVICE: 3.5/5 - it would be 2 but since our waiter was nice, bumped it up to 3.5, solely due to the grueling wait time in between meals (so if you do plan to try this place, make sure to eat incredibly slow, like chew that piece of tomato for a solid 30 second, or more if you could!) I've experienced The Spotted Pig and I'll leave it to that.

The deviled eggs were okay too, but the other 2 dishes stole its thunder. When I visit again, I'm going to order 2 chicken liver toasts for myself!

It gets crowded very quickly (which is not pleasant), so I prefer to go during the earlier side of lunch when you're less inclined to encounter a mob.Once you've secured a table, I suggest sampling a few bar snacks: Roll Mops, Devil on Horseback, Chicken Liver Toast and Pot of Pickles among them. And as a lover of burgers, I can't deny that their Roquefort burger is amazing (and huge, and will probably send you running to the gym right after you eat it). The fries are very salty but somehow work, and the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes (served during brunch) are a must. They're open late (which is good) and serve food late (which is even better).

1557,axz70giIENWIacRXr-811A,Cecilia Z.,4.0 star rating,"The Spotted Pig is a restaurant that immediately springs to mind whenever one mentions NYC. Not only is it headed by one of the biggest female chefs of our time, but it's also got big shot rapper Mr. Jay-Z as one of the investors. Add the Michelin star and numerous accolades it's received over the years, you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who hasn't heard of this place. Not surprisingly then, The Spotted Pig is perpetually packed at any hour of the day with a line wrapped around the front door. The bar area both downstairs and upstairs were packed even after midnight when the bf and I dropped in for a very late supper after some shenanigans nearby. We were pretty fortunate, being a party of two, as we were seated at a two top upstairs immediately after checking in at the receptionist's desk. Even though this place is dubbed as a gastropub with fairly high-priced fare, the ambiance is straight up casual and laid-back. From the borderline tacky lights on the outside to the cramped dining room and bar filled with a million piggy tinctures and various other things, I was actually pretty surprised by how much it resembled a neighborhood pub.But of course, the food here is steps above what you'd find at a regular pub. The renowned chargrilled burger with roquefort is incredibly juicy and rich, generously basted in butter on the grill with just enough pungency and flavor provided by the roquefort cheese. The accompanying shoe string fries are some of the thinnest and crispiest potato sticks I've ever tasted, yet elevated by the addition of garlic and rosemary fried with the fries. While I personally would never be able to finish that decadent burger, just about everyone else in the dining room had no problem at all putting it away. Attempting to find a lighter option on the dinner menu, I ordered the prosciutto and ricotta tart with marjoram. The smear of creamy ricotta and thinly sliced prosciutto layered on the impossibly flaky and warm puff pasty tart had enough salt to satisfy a late night craving but still managed to be balanced. I also liked the marjoram on top, similar to baby arugula, as it provided some much needed herbaceousness. The chicken liver toast is no joke here either - creamy, livery and rich - made more interesting by the slightly sweet balsamic that the little livers are cooked in. I think it goes without saying that The Spotted Pig serves the perfect late-night grub.The drink menu here is well curated, everything from the popular cocktails, to craft beers and a smart list of wines. I was glad to see a number of wines from California, including a Sauvignon Blanc from Heitz that I found hard to turn down, as well as some California Cabs. I was happy with the 21st Amendment IPA from SF I ended up ordering, especially as it was priced surprisingly well. I'd be happy to come back. I'm not sure if I'd be able to tolerate a 2 hour wait on any given night, but weekend brunch and late-night supper seem like good bets.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

1560,6lu_UFMxs8ZD9xApgQjIiQ,Philip M.,4.0 star rating,"3.5 Stars. Came for an early dinner on Sunday night in the summer. Seated right away at a table for two near the window, far enough away from the hustle and bustle, though very close to our neighbors, not really a bother, but be advised, you could be nearly bumping elbows with folks. We were served promptly by a very efficient, and attentive, if not the friendliest server (everybody is allowed to be tired of working I suppose). Just as a little snack to start we had the deviled egg. Very tasty, with a spicy kick, though far too salty for my taste, personally. 3 stars. Both my date and I ordered the burger, mine I asked for rare, which...yeah I suppose it was nearly there; delicious, however it was cooked. The roquefort cheese on the burger added a very unique and strong flavor, and they used just little enough of the cheese so that it didn't overpower the beef itself. Again, for my tastes, the cheese was too salty, but the flavor was distraction enough. Onto the perfectly grilled bun I added a dash of ketchup (which I don't think is your typical brand...not over-sweet) and it was lovely overall. One minor thing...the burger is served with fries...I won't even call them shoestring, more like ""angel hair"" fries. I discovered there is such a thing as too thin. Tasty though they were (anything deep fried with salt and rosemary is bound to be), I actually found it rather difficult to eat them. I resorted to a rather bizarre technique of smushing my burger into a pile of them and eating the ones that stuck with a bite of my burger. Strange I know, but effective. I seldom find myself enamored with French fries, but when I do, they are thin, but I can also tell that it's potato that I'm eating! Burger: 4 starsOverall a very good experience, and even though I can't help but feel like some of what I am paying for is rent in the West Village, I do like the neighborhood as much as the owner apparently does, and will almost certainly return.

The wait wasn't bad though, the host said that it'd be half an hour but we were seated within 15 minutes. Awesome service. I don't suggest bringing more than 5 people though, the tables are really small, and there's a lot of side-to-side seating but they're willing to accommodate however you want to sit. I personally liked the side-to-side seating, it was like the perfect date atmosphere. The place was nice and dim and the music wasn't too loud either. So my friend and I started off with the pot of pickles and the chicken liver toast. It was the butteriest, smoothest, almost pate-like liver I'd ever had. It was awesome, it reminded me of Vietnamese pate I'd have in sandwiches. I thought the pot of pickles was going to literally just be pickled cucumber but it was a medley of veggies like string beans, turnips, and gerkins, and carrots. That was really fun to eat but I really wished I had saved it for when the burger came out. And of course, we had to try the famous roquefort cheese burger and shoestring fries. It really didn't disappoint. Each and every one looked like the pictures. It was big, but not too big. Huge mound of shoestring fries with fresh rosemary and fried garlic strips in it. I just didn't like the fact that it got greasier and we went through the fries. I would have preferred for it to be a bit thicker but that's just me. The fact that I was trying to be polite and not shove handfuls of fries in my mouth took away from the full experience that I could have had. Oh well, it was good. I took heed from other yelpers and ordered it medium-well and of course, I was given a medium-rare burger. Best decision of the night. Amazing texture in the meat. I'm not a fan of really strong cheeses and the first scoopful of cheese I had on the burger frightened me but when I bit into the burger, it just all made sense. It's no wonder they don't let you choose your own cheese. It really meshed beautifully. However, if you really don't like super sharp cheeses, you should scrap off some of the excess. Amazing burger/bun, no complaint. However, my partner felt as thought a pickle would have been nice (I knew I should of saved that pot of pickles till the end) but I think the sharpness of the cheese was enough oomph for me. I thought it was perfect. My friend ordered the lamb special. It was 2 morel mushrooms stuffed with lamb, I believe, but I think it was very disappointing. I wanted him to order gnudi but he was being ""spontaneous"" (he was being silly passing up house-made gnudi) and ordered 35 dollar mushrooms equaling the size of my fist. The flavors, although interesting were way too bold to be eaten alone. I felt as though it needed another carb or a side of vegetables other than beans. And I can really sense the saltiness that other yelpers talked about in this dish. Way too much going on in that dish. I'd have sticked with the much talked about gnudi. Bill came out to almost 80 bucks including tip (speaking of which, service was really good. It's a bunch of down to earth young people that work there.) Overall, nice joint, a bit overpriced but it is a damn good burger. Didn't have enough room for dessert (I lie, I was low on cash) but there was flourless chocolate cake that I absolutely wanted to try.

I'll note that it's almost become a ritual for me to start out my meals here with this dish. The bread is toasted ever so slightly that the outside crust is crunchy, yet the inside is still a bit chewy. Then a heaping pile of rich and creamy chicken liver is spread on top. Visible chunks of liver also add another layer of bursting flavor to the dish. Absolutely delicious.I've been loyal to the burger the last four times at The Spotted Pig. And being one of my favorite burgers in the city, it was quite the predicament to go with something else, but I felt like I needed to venture out and try the rest of the menu. The deep fried poached eggs with chorizo stew caught my eye as an interesting dish when I looked over the menu for alternatives. A colorful plate of expertly fried (and) poached eggs sat on top of a chorizo stew made my Saturday afternoon even brighter. Sunny yellow yolk poured out of the eggs as I cut into them, adding even more color to the dish. The eggs complimented the salty, sugary, and vinegary stew well while the savory chorizo provided that extra hint of spiciness to bring all the flavors of the dish together.Almost every table around us ordered at least one burger and ours was no exception. Each juicy patty was cooked perfectly to requested temperature and came with a gigantic pile of salted shoestring fries on the side. The roquefort cheese added an entirely new twist to the typical burger flavor, in a good way. Combined with a perfectly toasted brioche bun, everything worked together so well that almost no words were uttered during the consumption of the burgers.  Only the sound of chewing and the occasional gulp broke the happy silence. If that weren't enough, I'm pretty sure their shoestring fries were fried with fresh rosemary and garlic to give them such addicting flavor and aroma.The Spotted Pig is not only a solid choice for dinner, but also for brunch. Great food and great ambiance easily make this a favorite spot for any occasion. I highly recommend the burger and will be back soon to fill the void that was created in my stomach by not getting it this time around.

It was torture watching all the burgers with heaping piles of fries leave the kitchen (and not come to our table)!  Finally we got our food and dug in.  The poached eggs and chorizo stew was very good and flavorful, and at least for me, the deep fried poached eggs were a novelty (albeit an unhealthy one) that I quite enjoyed.  My only complaint is that the portion was pretty small, especially for $17.  The bf said he enjoyed the burger, but it wasn't super standout, and the flavor of the roquefort cheese dominated.  I helped myself to most of his fries and they were SO good.  Well-seasoned and crispy shoe-string fries, perhaps the best I've had.

The shoestring fries were delicious, filled with rosemary and garlic chips. Yummy! You also get a big mountain of them. The drinks were A-OK, although the waiter was not too helpful when I asked how ginger-y one of the drinks was (all he could say was that there was more hibiscus in the mix of the punch than ginger... which is not very helpful because ginger can pack a punch).A little overhyped in my opinion (also didn't like that we couldn't order oysters by the piece...)...

Tried the chicken liver toast as a friend (and all of Yelp) suggested.  I can do pate/foie gras/etc no problem, and I live by the mantra to try anything once so the word 'liver' didn't scare me.

1584,B0LdlcwncbQmwIpRxH1xng,May Z.,3.0 star rating,"I was craving burgers, so I decided to check this place out. The website said that there is a bit of a wait for dinner, but never a wait during lunch. I went for lunch at around 1:30pm. The hostess said it'd be a 45 minute wait. That seemed longer than the no-wait advertised on the site, but I was ok with it. 45 minutes passed and no table.  I asked the hostess if she could estimate how much longer it'd be, and she said a couple minutes more or 20 minutes max at worst case scenario. One hour and no table. It wasn't until another 30 minutes passed that a table became available. Sat down and waited 10 minutes for the waiter to stop by and take my order. So after 2 hours total of waiting (waiting for a table, waiting for the waiter, waiting for the food) I got my burger and was excited to devour it. The medium rare beef was overpowered by globs of bleu cheese. Every bite I took was a mouthful of bleu cheese. I really wanted to like this burger, but all I could taste was the toe jam cheese. I tried to erase the funk from my taste buds by eating the fries, but those were so over-salted that it just blistered my mouth. Overall, a disappointing experience. I really wanted to love this place. The second floor is very charming and a nice little spot. Unfortunately, the service and the food didn't live up to its hype for me. I'd be willing to give it another try if I didn't have to wait an hour and a half for a table during lunch. I was originally going to give this place 2 stars, but the waiter came through at the end and was pleasant, attentive, and quick to give me my check when I asked for it (the table next to me waited 20 minutes for theirs).Word of advice: whatever wait time they tell you, double it and that's how long you'll actually wait for a table.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Fries not that impressive, because when you make potatoes hair thin, they absorb at least 200% more oil than regular fries (bigger surface area). I was wondering why it is called Devils on Horseback, so I looked it up.Definition #1: A darker, cheaper version of Angels on Horseback - oysters wrapped in bacon. (I probably would call it ""Angels Undercover As Pigs"")Definition #2: Variation of ""Pigs in Blanket"" - as you can imagine, it's bacon wrapped sausages.Definition #3: Found on Squidoo. DOH stems from Cornwall in the south of England at the turn of the last millenium, where Norman raiders would disguise themselves is suits of armour made by layering rashers of bacon. First, they look grotesque and frightening, then after the job was done, they can eat their armour. Protection was roughly in the same class as leather armour depending on the thickness of the bacon.""Devils on horseback"" was the nickname of these bacon-clad warriors.Anyway, it was just all too crowded and smoky.

We waited another 10-15 minutes to be called and I tried not to panic (I hate the feeling of always being in an active walkway).  They took us upstairs and it was just as packed as the downstairs.  They showed us to our table and I noticed that most people sat on the same side of the table (I felt like I would have had to dislocate my shoulder like Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon just to fit on the same side).  I requested a seat and they brought out a stool....not a chair, a stool.  To me, nothing is worse than constantly fixing your posture because your back is able to collapse on itself.Moving onto the food....we ordered:- Chicken Liver Toast: very good- Deviled Eggs: not that good (maybe I'm too used to mine with truffle oil and dijon)- Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestrings: where do I begin?  I'm not a blue cheese fan, but I will always give things a try.  I didn't love the burger and I wasn't a fan of the fries.  I had high hopes for the rosemary garlic fries because its one of the things I make best (cookingchanneltv.com/rec…).

How to describe The Spotted Pig? The food (and atmosphere too!) is luscious, rustic, hearty, earthy, and funky, all rolled into one. It's an experience in gastronomy to be sure and it's certainly not for the faint of heart. Picky eaters, vegetarians, or those watching their waist - beware! It may be tough to find something for you here. (Even most of the vegetables are cooked in some type of meat stock!). Let's start with the cocktails, Spotted Pig's only misfire. While they sound great on the menu, they are small and not fantastic, and at $12 more expensive then they should be. If you are in need of a pre-dinner cocktail, a better bet would be to saunter over to Orient Express less than a block away where the cocktails are divine. Spotted Pig's wine list is great though, with options ranging from $9-$15 and some decently priced bottles, some even at $35-$45 (my threshold). I go through phases where I don't eat animals and then someone tells me they have pig ears on the menu and my brain and body go all sorts of haywire and suddenly I need to have this pig's ear immediately (I mean, if it's good enough for my dog...). This particular evening, the Crispy Pig's Ear ($15) was a special appetizer and it was phenomenal. It was fried up, sliced thin, and served over bittery lettuce with bits of lemon and a little bit of salt. The balance of crispy fat, bright lettuce, salt, and citrus was remarkable and intriguing. We also ordered the oysters (6 for $18), and they were good, but basic. I'd go with something else if I had to go back (if I HAD to!). We shared the Scallops with Ramps (vegetable du jour!) and Chili ($32), which was magical, and the Veal Chops with Artichoke and Dandelion ($36) - heavenly. The Spotted Pig does not take reservations, so either get there right at 5:30 for dinner service (and then, if you're lucky, you can get the best seat in the house - the back left corner, which puts you in view of the entire room, as well as the kitchen, where you may be lucky enough to spot April Bloomfield working her magic) or put your name in and be prepared to wait (they'll call you so you don't have to hang around).  (A good place to wait is....you guessed it - Orient Express).",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Well done? No? I don't know how I like my burger. She also took my coffee sugar cube. How rude. Well that's just the date I took here. She will never be lucky again for me to take her back here with those manners.... Def not getting lucky tonight. Her not me.. Let's talk about the restaurant instead since that's what ppl come here to read. Not about my date experience. We were seated upstairs with no wait. We did have reservations that I made. I know I'm classy. We got coffee and I made sure we got tap water. I am not paying for bottled water in NYC. The tap is perfect. So of course the gentleman I am I let my date order first and she ordered my favorite burger. I was not having that. I stopped the order and said I'm having the burger and she would need to pick something else. She got the grilled cheese. How dare she take my sugar cube...

Before I get into the food I just want to say that we got there at 8 pm. I forget what day it was but I want to say it was a Thursday. The wait was 90 min. but you are allowed to leave your number and they'll call you when it gets close to time which I thought was pretty cool. So my friend left his number and we went somewhere else for drinks to wait it out because the place was way too packed. We went back in about 70 min. later just to be safe and we were seated upstairs within the next 10 min. So on to the food! We started with the deviled eggs, chicken liver toast, sheeps milk ricotta gnudi with brown butter & sage and the burgers for our entree. The deviled eggs were just deviled eggs, the chicken liver toast was delicious but the ricotta gnudi with that brown butter & sage was exceptional. It was hands down the winner of the night and to all you calorie conscious people out there it is worth every single calorie! Now the burgers, which we both ordered medium but mine was with cheese and his without. Both our burgers came out more medium rare than medium. We also both agreed the burgers lacked flavor and juiciness. Now I would give this place a second try on the burger but next time I will definitely do without that roquefort cheese! Boy is that a strong tasting cheese which totally over powers the otherwise under seasoned burger in my opinion. Just an fyi there are no other cheese options and no bacon either! The fries I thought to be a bit salty but they were cooked perfectly.Overall a cool place with a friendly staff but I don't know if it worth the wait but like I said before I would go back to give that burger another shot!",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

1617,5aZX8bTiD0k9vR60SG588Q,Alison C.,5.0 star rating,"The Spotted Pig has been a popular hangout since it has first opened.  Celebrities love to gather around the bar on either of the first two floors, and some of the city's top chefs sneak up to its hidden after-hours attic.  Plus, with the down-to-earth, locavore Executive  Chef, April Bloomfield, this place just oozes coolness.I had once visited The Spotted Pig solely for drinks and had loved the fun, country-style decor and relaxed atmosphere.  I had been dying to try the cuisine and was ecstatic to learn that one of my clients had requested it for a corporate lunch.  My colleagues and I arrived at the quaint corner spot and joined our business partners around a lengthy, rectangular table.  We were all healthy eaters (aka pigs, not vegetarians) and decided to begin by sharing several items off of the bar snack list.  The Deviled Eggs had the perfect balance of firm egg white and creamy yolk.  Scallion shavings and paprika were sprinkled across the top of each egg for some added flavor.  The Marinated Olive dish included a wide variety of the briny Mediterranean item, introducing us to their various flavors.  The Devils on Horseback sweet dates were stuffed with gooey cheese and wrapped in smoky bacon.   The Roasted Almonds were an additional treat, but nothing fulfilled the fattening reputation of this gastropub quite like the Chicken Liver Toast.  The crusty slices of artisan ciabatta were covered with the heavy, rich liver spread.  Though a few of the diners were hesitant to sample the unique paste, they instantly became hooked after just a simple bite.Due to such a lavish appetizer tasting, I decided to order something a bit more manageable for my main course, such as the Smoked Haddock Chowder, which was well-seasoned and served as the perfect portion to round out the rest of the heavy meal.  I also took a bite or two of several of my companion's plates.  The Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi were round heavy dumplings that possessed dense centers of the mild, creamy cheese.  A decadent, buttery broth cradled the dense pasta and fresh basil leaves added a herb garden essence to the dish.  The thick, humongous Chargrilled Beef Burger patty was moist with flavor and served on a crusty, toasted bun.  Roquefort cheese was draped across the meat and a side of thin shoestring fries was a playful accompaniment.By this point, we were all stuffed beyond belief and ready to roll ourselves back to our offices, but we still could not pass up the opportunity to try the Walnut, Chocolate, and Amaretto Cake.  This dense pastry was packed with nuts and topped with a thick chocolate ganache.  The dessert was as sinful as the rest of the menu items.The Spotted Pig truly embodies an English pub with its rustic decor, fabulous beverage list, and comforting food.  Though stopping here for a drink is a fun experience, nothing beats a sampling of Chef Bloomfield's culinary decadence.  Unfortunately, the indulgent meal is something best done in moderation.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Deviled eggs were excellent. I think will try to make my own. A simple dish but hard to perfect. The fries were consumed super quick but wouldn't be gone for long. For entree I myself got the burger which I wanted medium and it came out.. medium! It also came with more fries (like a TON). I was a happy boy. The burger was super tasty, not a huge fan of goat cheese but I can live with it. My other friends got the lamb shank, skirt steak and the special which was a soft shell crab salad.

1622,tCq4hTTnpCqIJAFqmfu7Eg,Jordan S.,4.0 star rating,"The Spotted Pig, if it were a Dungeons and Dragons player, would be aligned with chaotic good. The restaurant does not take reservations, and as such, can appear anarchic, but it does so out of a spirit of equality, not a de rigueur statement of its posh status. Dianne K and I arrived shortly before the commencement of dinner service, only to be informed that the list of names of patrons to be seated was created only briefly before the first round of seatings, and had not yet opened. Having thus gained relatively little from coming early, we considered getting a drink, shortly thereafter realizing the impossibility of doing so. The bar was in all senses of the phrase, spoken for. Our attempts to slink over to a space within earshot of the bar tender were met with enough reproachful glances to make me consider the likelihood of their coalescing into some sinister form. If planning to come here, however, one should not simply steel themselves emotionally. It is a good idea to test your physical fortitude as well. Amongst other things, I was bashed with: a door, a tray, a studded purse(kinky), and the lens of a camera. Having one's feet trodden upon and being in a perpetual state of jostling go almost without saying. You will wonder if the surveyors from the Michelin guide have their own secret entrance, shortly before being buffeted with the door of that secret entrance. I kid....I think.Yet when you finally, thankfully, mercifully are shown to your seats, you will forget most of your harrowing journey. Thus, like any proper triumphant returned would, I ordered a hot mulled wine. The typical notes of clove, cinnamon and anise were accentuated by something I couldn't quite discern, possibly allspice berries. Regardless of the mystery ingredient, this was one of the more masterfully full-bodied mulled wines I've had this season. with the brandy and orange drawing out the subtleties of the malbec. Dianne's Corpse Reviver was a moderately refined take on a classic as well, the Herbsaint taking the place of a more pronounced absinthe substitute (there is no real absinthe anymore, hipsters. Get over it.) and leaving a wonderful anise aroma throughout the drink. After a few pensive sips, our chicken liver toast arrived. Rich, savory, and surprisingly firm, it was not entirely what I was expecting, and I was pleasantly surprised. The bread beneath was appropriately crusty and warm, the smaller bits of liver seeping into the delicate lace of cavernous pores. Following the trend of simply prepared meat on bread, both Dianne and I decided to order the famed burger. The praise surrounding the burger is all well-deserved. Roquefort melds with the charred crust, creating a tangy, salty, creamy yet crunchy layer topping the juicy, slightly mineral, tender beef. The brown mustard served on the side is an excellent foil for when the proceedings feel too dense. This burger is a must-try for anyone who claims to love them, plain and simple. The shoestring fries, on the other hand, were not my favorite, though it must be said that I loathe shoestring fries, and did not have the highest of hopes for these. That preference disclosure aside, I found they fell a bit flat in the herbaceous department, and were slightly too salty. Ms. Bloomfield's culinary palette skews heavily in that direction, but the fries were flawed precisely because there was nothing to enhance or be enhanced by the abundance of salt. Instead, look to the more balanced items, such as the gnudi with sage and brown butter, or the stracciatella with roasted pumpkin and chili. Generally, in fact, excepting the burger, The Spotted Pig seems to boast more successes among its appetizers and its small plates. They would be perfect for sharing, if it were easier to come in a group. Time to befriend some rugby players, I suppose.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I am a soft shell crab fiend and always insist on ordering it whenever in season. I had never seen it on the menu here before and didn't expect much but the British twist on this was divine. The crab was perfectly cooked in this luscious, almost tempura like batter. It was freaking amazing. We inhaled it and wished there had been more crab.

But after hearing rave after rave about the burger from Spotted Pig, and after eating many a burger in New York, I have to say I was very disappointed in the whole dish.We started off with the chicken liver toasts which was pretty tasty but very rich. Although they're not the biggest slices triangles of toast because it's so rich you could probably share among 4 people who just wanted to get a good taste of it. We then ordered our burgers. Granted I am not the biggest fan of blue cheese, but the cheese made the burger incredibly salty. Usually there is some sort of balance with the saltiness of the cheese, some sort of crisp component -- something to take the edge off the saltiness and enhance the flavor. But this time it fell flat. All I could taste was the cheese and the beef, though cooked perfectly was tender and juicy, but because of the cheese the entire burger was too salty.Unfortunately the side that came with it, the rosemary shoestring fries, were way, way too salty. I love the idea of fried garlic chips and fried rosemary leaves along with the shoestring fries, and I love skinny, crispy fries, but these were too liberally seasoned with salt. Together, the burger and the fries made for 4 glasses of water and still left me longing for more liquids. It is, admittedly, huge portions (at least the burger and fries were). But considering the flavor, the saltiness, the big disappointment $17 was too much to pay for this experience. The service was good here though -- water was always refilled, our bottle was refilled and returned to our table, the waitress was very friendly and always served with a smile and a chipper attitude. Never gave us a condescending or angry sneer when we didn't order any drinks besides water, or didn't order dessert.

I heard Batali is involved with this place and was let down as all his other places are awesome and the service is always helpful and not pretentious. I guess you can't win 'em all.

The chicken liver toast was more oily and heavy than I'd have expected but still, I thought it was really unique and yummy. I've eaten a million deviled eggs, but there was something that set these ones apart, a slightly acidic taste? I'm not sure, regardless they were great (my friend thought they had a funny aftertaste, pshh). My only half complaint is that if you are going for a bloody mary you might mention to go light on the horseradish if you don't love huge blobs of it coming through your straw.

We were also pretty close to our neighbors, but it was loud enough that we couldn't really hear their conversation. We didn't want to order too heavily since we weren't starving so we got the Chicken liver toast and the Grilled calf's liver with cippolini onions and pancetta.The toast was good, but I thought it was lacking some flavor. The calf's liver was actually the first time I had liver cooked so that the middle was rare. The combination of the sweetness of the cippolini onions and the acidity of the lightly dressed arugala cut the richness of the liver.

The last time I went (and literally the last time I will ever go) there was a 15 min wait, probably because we showed up at 3 PM on a Thursday - and there was a limited menu on top of that. So with that, the place is small and intimate - intimate in a good way? Not sure. Regardless, there is limited seating which probably makes for the ridiculous wait times. The wait and kitchen staff are continually rushing through the dining area to collect food from the basement storage, so be careful if you find yourself sitting in the line of fire of shuffling servers and busboys.Anyway, I came here for the burger and was pleasantly disappointed. It was lacking in some way. The cheese was very overpowering and I would venture to say took away from the burger itself. The french fry strings were next to impossible to eat if you want to maintain a sense of class. Granted you get a shit ton of fries, but they kind of just seemed to be there for show. Lots of rosemary for taste, but overall, not that impressive. The chicken liver toast was pretty goddamn awesome, and a healthy portion too. I recommend that. Fo sho. But the burger was just plain, well, plain.I've seen a couple reviews mentioning Jay-Z as a part owner - if you're coming here for that, god help you, you sheep. Don't waste your time.

1654,qM8Lw34fL9BjjJ9w9dFsnQ,The World Digested A.,3.0 star rating,"(Continued from the previous.)Roasted Sunchokes with Lettuce & Goat CheeseMy dining companion asked me what the sunchoke was. Being such a pedant that I am, I proudly displayed my knowledge of this increasing fashionable vegetable, also known as Jerusalem artichocke - I never fail to cackle when I think about the fashion in food, especially vegetables, with a mental image of vegetables walking the catwalk - and I turned to the plate to point out the specimen, but to no avail. I clandestinely searched the plate for the unwilling star underneath the charmingly crisp lettuce hearts (noted as escarole, but it suspiciously looked and tasted like regular lettuce), candied pumpkin seeds and creamy goat cheese; and finally, I found a small scattering of unsightly mash of light brown at the bottom of the plate. A dubious bite confirmed that indeed it was sunchoke, and indeed it was horridly mistreated by over-roasting beyond recognition, as the venerable Mrs. Beeton* would have approved. In addition, the earthiness of the sunchockes had no association with the salad, either in consideration of taste or texture, especially when the light and watery lettuce hearts already clashed with the sweet pumpkin brittle. **Author of the most famous British cookbook: Book of Household Management, published in 1861, and still in circulation. Grilled Beef Tongue with Duck Fat Potatoes & Pickled BeetsGrilling is usually not a type of cooking method that one would associate with the word, ""tenderness."" Nevertheless, the heavily marbled beef tongue was impossibly tender after being grilled by a pair of clevet hands. Although the potatoes were totally overshadowed by the glorious tongue, the flavorless duck fat notwithstanding, the picked beets and cucumbers crisply accentuated the beef tongue and took off some of the greasiness. Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & ShoestringsThe limitation of words has been reached. How does one present the sheer pleasure of biting into the crusty brioche-sque bun and the tender fatty beef and the thrill of the first waft of pungency of the Roquefort? How do you describe the bliss when the jus of the beef bursts into the mouth or the way the bread crumbles in the mouth? So simple and yet so elegantly realized, the burger's purest sensation could be achieved otherwise only through years of lengthy meditation. Crispy Pork Belly with Polenta & ChardThe polenta had an unexpectedly sharp tang - probably from pecorino - which found the chard to be a more than agreeable company. However, the pork belly disappointed again after the failure at Recette. New York seems to have recently ""discovered"" pork bellies; however, with all due respect, this porcine fat-lean sandwich of meat had been enjoyably consumed across Europe and Asia for centuries. Hence, what is exactly the fuss about? If one has never had it before, the palate will be naturally less differentiating toward a perfectly mediocre specimen. As someone who has grown up on pork bellies, however, the fuss and the gloss did not rub off on me in the least and I tasted it for what it was: A insipid piece of a rather fatty pork with a knife-proof hide. The skin of the belly was so hard that it would have made an excellent football, in place of the customary pig's bladder in the 1800's. Brussels Sprouts, friedThe Brussels sprouts were immensely flavorful due to the frying, which produced caramelization on the outer skins.

And again, both were pretty outstanding dishes. My husband had the burger - it was pretty juicy, and it came under a pile of yummy crunchy shoestring fries that were fried with rosemary and garlic. People tend to run hot or cold when it comes to blue cheese on burgers, but my husband loves it (especially Roquefort), so the salty tang was perfect for him.

Honestly the burger has absolutely nothing special about it except the extremely pungent cheese(requefort). I can't critize this too much as it is more a matter personal preference.Take away the cheese and you are left with a so-so burger, nothing else. I found the fries very good and nicely crisped, seasoned with garlic salt. The prunes, although I found them creative, were very average if not flat/bland, in terms of taste. They do have a good beer selection, albeit limited. I give them props for a Well stocked wine selection. Also had the beet salad, which was very elaborate, but in terms of taste, again lacking. Now, event hough I was not impressed by the food, what bothered me the most was the bar preparation area. I saw some pretty terrible sanitary ""problems"" going on, which I will not elaborate here, but rest assured, it doesnt help my opinion of the restaurant.

While we were in Chicago we tried THE PURPLE PIG and A GIRL AND A GOAT, both were really good spots! So after coming back we had to try it out and see for ourselves.First off, you cant make reservations here. Its kind of a downer but it is worth the wait. We were told that the wait will be around 30 mins so we just hung by the bar and tried the house beer they had ""Spotted Pig Bitter"" (not bad but it was a little too warm for my taste). Also they had something that caught my eye on tap also ""Six Points ""Chocolate Rye Porter"""" (you can taste the hint of chocolate on it but i dont think i will be switching to that brand in my lifetime, props by the way to the bartender for giving us a taste.After 15 mins we were seated, we got one of the worst seats in the house (right next to the pillar) but this would be irrelevant later on.We started off with a bottle of Brooks Reisling 2007 $40. This wine wasnt too sweet and didnt have the full body I normally like but it was good enough.For the appetizer we had the Chicken Liver on toast, WOW WOW WEEEE WAAAA! Im not big on liver spread, the only thing i know is the one that comes from a can but this flipped my world upside down! Me and my girlfriend simulatiously looked at each other in suprise on how rich and flavorful this was. (YOU HAVE TO TRY IT!)Our next dish was the ""Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi with Basil Pesto"", once again it was right on point! The waitress told us that this was ""flash boiled"" (need to use that in my vocab), well, no matter how they did it.... it was really good! This might be another must try for you readers out there.For the main dish my girlfriend had the ""Grilled Colorado Lamb Leg with Parsnips & Chimichurri"", She enjoyed it but I will have to say that it wasnt the best lamb dish that i have tried. I think it just had a little more spice than i wanted.I got the 'Rolled Pork Belly with Rutabaga & Salsa Verde"". Upon looking at the dish it looked so yummy. After the first bite... it was a little less appealing. I just hope it was an off day since everything else was so delicious. When the waitress came back to see how we were doing I had to tell her that the pork belly was ""over seasoned"" (i felt like it had too much salt on it and everything else was just too overbearing for my taste buds).  She suggested to take back the dish and serve me a different dish of my choice but I declined. I was hoping to give it a second chance, maybe the other section of the pork belly would be better..... well it actually was but not to the degree that it was ""wow"". Maybe the first bite it took was the ""bad"" spot. For dessert we had the ""Walnut, Chocolate & Amaretto Cake"". By this time i was so stuffed that i only had space for a small bite of it. My girlfriend seemed to like it. For myself I was in food coma land, I have no comment on it.So just to finish off, I love this place!

Perfectly salty, deliciously rich--omg dreaming of it now. I was there for over two hours not because I was waiting and dinner was dragging, but because I genuinely did not want to leave. GO. For my entree, I had the gnudi, which was absolutely superb. Don't be thwarted by its seemingly small portion size--this stuff is rich and creamy and will fill you instantly.  My boyfriend had the hamburger, which was perfectly cooked and the fries were so enjoyable (that truffle oil...yum!!).

The befuddled look the host gave me didn't help and the fact that my guy wasn't answering his cell certainly didn't either.I decided to ask one more time before launching into DMX mode: ""Is there a private group in here...anywhere?"" I saw the light bulb go on over her head and she said, ""Oh yes...upstairs!"" She looked down at my heels and luggage and said, ""But it's three flights up."" Oh snap.  ""No worries,"" she said. ""I'll take it up for you."" I implored that she did not have to, but she grabbed my stuff and proceeded up the stairs. At that moment, the other host appeared and he grabbed it and lugged it up there. Now THAT's service..and with a smile!Once we reached the top and found my group, I was happy to see a bunch of drunken, dancing souls having a fabulous time--and my guy was in the middle of it all. So what did I do? I immediately ordered a drink and joined the party. The music was great, although whoever was DJ'ing sucked...the blends were disgraceful. A gent by the name of DJ GT, who I was standing next to, shook his head in disgust and said he really needed to be on the ones and twos at that moment. He ain't neva lied. Since I had only been to a gastropub once before at my cousin's wedding in London (but didn't eat) I was really curious to eat something just to see what the fuss was all about. After checking out the menu, I ordered the Roquefort burger medium. When they brought me the bleeding burger, I remembered that a NY medium is a Chicago rare, so I sent it back so they could cook it bit more. What they brought back was sheer burger perfection. This juicy, well-seasoned burger smothered with roquefort cheese on a kaiser bun was a party in my mouth. The shoestrings were mmm mmm good and I'm not even a fan of shoestrings..they're usually nothing but a tease.The bartenders, servers and hosts  were very nice and accommodating and we all know folks from NY aren't really any of those things. ;-p. As far as decor, I guess you could call it Gastropub Chic.

1709,5OT5sc4_S1oH6UrZ4W9B9w,Chester N.,4.0 star rating,"This is a very tough one to rate, made even more difficult when I found out it was a Michelin star restaurant.  As a precursor to this review, the food was excellent, the restaurant manager Michelin quality, wait staff not so much, ambiance just short of a log cabin, and waiting to be seated inevitably just not worth it.  So with all those rolled into 1 review, a 4 star is justified because of the quality of food, and the way the manager handled a table next to us, and ultimately us as well.To start off, no reservations taken; it's a Gastropub so I suppose that is to be expected.  Words of warning, popular nights you can expect to wait 1.5-2 hours during prime time which is exactly what happened here.  If you're unlucky enough miss any space at the bar to wait for your table, there is a Whitehorse tavern down the street you can wait at.  Typically, I would say ""eff that"" to a 2 hour wait, but a visiting friend from CA dictated we wait and try.  Arriving and putting our name down at 730, coming back at 925 to check the status of our table, waiting at the bar until 945, we finally get seated at a corner of the restaurant.  Not the most idle spot to seat 3 people at a round table with a cornered bench.  I had enough waiting, let the judging begin.There was plenty on the menu I wanted to try, but we were 3 people who share, so the soup was out of the question.  We ended up with the Prosciutto & Ricotta Tart, Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi, and another dish that was meant to be spread on toast.  The tart was interesting, but a bit too much of a dessert feel for an appetizer.  The Gnudi was excellent.  The spread, which I think was the pumpkin spread was ok as well.  Nothing really stood out between the three.  As for the entree, we decided to share 2 large dishes as well with 1 side.  The burger is the pig's most well known dish, well that was an obvious choice.  For the second, we got the skirt steak.  For a side, we went with the roasted brussel sprouts.  The burger?  Yes it is good, and yes I would recommend it.  If you force me to put it in a list, I would say it makes my top 7 in the ever fluctuating New York burger list.  The skirt steak was skirt steak, not outrageously done, but good none the less.  Good flavor and tender for this lesser cut of meat.  Alta has the BEST brussel sprouts in NYC, and these were ok.  It felt as if they were trying to get there, but haven't figured out the correct way to make them heavenly.  Seriously though, as long as the brussel sprouts aren't slimy and nauseating, that's a good thing.  Overall, I enjoyed the food and I thought it was very good for a ""pub.""Now what really made our night interesting was the table next to us.  3 middle aged women, slightly buzzed, ordering more wine, a combination for the ages.  When the order came out, one of the servers spilled the entire plate onto the lap of one of the ladies in plain sight of everyone.  Luckily her lap and jeans were covered by the cloth, but let's face it, there was spillage.  Apologizes, some cleaning, and the night continues.  Seemingly no harm, no foul.  At the end of the meal, when the check comes, you knew this was coming.  Apparently the dish was charged.  3 drunk women, rise up and defend your honor!  It started off as a civil questioning as to his mockery.  The waiter, who wasn't the one waiting at the table said he was informed she grabbed the plate and poured it on herself.  I'll give you a minute to picture that situation.  Exactly, just a preposterous accusation.  At this point, I would say more of the dining room was on the side of the ladies.  Now the manager comes out to deal with the situation, and hopefully ""clean up"" the mess.  She literally listened, taking figurative blow after blow to the face, all while smiling and never breaking demeanor.  First point was to take the dish off the bill, simple enough.  Second, she offered a glass of wine for each of the ladies.  Classy, but they denied.  Thirdly, the lady demanded the restaurant pay for the dry cleaning of her.....jeans.....really?  Not an absurd request, but dry cleaning jeans?  I must have missed the label that said they were Gucci.  Regardless, yes the manager offered to pay for the dry cleaning.  Fourthly, this is when the group over stepped their boundaries, they wanted more items to be checked off because they didn't like them, although it didn't seem like it when they cleaned their plates.  This is when the manager seamlessly transformed from door mat to bouncer, all with the same smile.  ""I'm not going to take off items which you have already consumed.""  At the end of this fiasco, the bill was paid in the most unclassy way.  The check folder full of money was left on the floor as the lady exclaimed ""Oops"" without any intent on retrieving it.  We told the manager she handled it exceptionally well, and grace under fire only undervalues her performance.  She offered us dessert wine for the table, which we gracefully accepted.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Started off with the chicken liver toast to accompany our drinks, and it was amazing.  I'm not usually a fan of liver, but this dish was tasty.  Next we had the sheep's milk ricotta gnudi with basil pesto and the speck salad with puntarelle & blood Orange.  The sheep's milk ricotta gnudi are little bite-sized pieces of heavenly cheese-gnocchi type of  things.  I would definitely recommend the dish.  Then came the burgers, and the shoestring fries.  Very good all around.  In some odd sense the burger with the Roquefort cheese reminded me of the burger from Father's Office that I desperately miss from LA.  Rounding up the meal, we decided to try the creme caramel and the ginger cake.  I thought the creme caramel was a bit on the too sweet side, but the ginger cake was perfectly balanced with the sweetness and a hint of spice.  Yes the food is a bit on the pricey side, but I think it is definitely worth it!",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

The answer is a resounding yes. Let me first put it out there right now. The chicken liver on toast is probably one of the best deals in the city. $5.50 for two pieces of warm, unctuous bread piled high with warm, highly seasoned chicken liver ecstasy. The initial thought may revolt some of you, but set aside those antiquated and preconceived notions because this is little traditional Jewish dish is euphoria in your mouth! Folks rave about the deviled eggs here (tasty as they are) but they don't hold a candle compared to the chicken liver. Sorry! My eggs Benedict were standard and nothing to rave home about. However, my partner's burger was very good. The meat had good char that kept up with the strength of the blue cheese nicely. The huge mounds of shoe string fries were delicious too. A perfect bloody Mary made with pepper infused vodka with pickled veg on a toothpick rounded off an excellent meal. Service is the most impressive thing about Spotted Pig. It looks loose and disheveled, but really behind that hipster facade is a humming machine that does an excellent job with very little attitude. Best of all, it's surprisingly spacious inside with two levels of seating so a long wait is probably not in the cards. Sweet.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

And it wasn't nearly enough.On our first visit to the Pig, on our first night in NYC, as luck would have it, we landed a seat at the upstairs bar when a 90 minute wait for a table turned a bit too long. Ryan the bartender became our NYC BFF. He makes the most amazing drinks, is incredibly knowledgeable about the food, and he recommended bars, restaurants and local flavor that basically turned our trip into Ryan's Tour of NY. On that first night we spent about 3 hours chatting it up with Ryan and the other customers. It felt like home right there at the bar and we happily returned for more. Then entire staff is warm, friendly and FUN. The food is comforting, delicious and Oh, the drinks! The drinks are inventive and creative without pretension. I fell in love with the Market Lemonade (with the cutest, sweetest little strawberries) and my boyfriend loved Ryan's Dark and Stormys. Food Highlights:Gazpacho - WOW! If it is on the menu, get it. Creamy, slightly tangy with a kick that is like a surprise birthday party. Amazing flavor combination. Not to be missed.Five Veggie Plate - (does not include the fries) - Who would have thought that 5 different veggies piled together on one plate could taste like making slow sweet Sunday morning love? Pigs Ears - I didn't think I'd want to even try the dog ear treat but I'm so glad we did. It was perfectly crunchy, perfectly piggie, perfectly delectable. No wonder dogs like them...if only they had actually got to have them like this.Gnudi - If Meg Ryan has been at the Spotted Pig eating the Gnudi instead of at Katz's for her famous orgasm scene, she wouldn't have had to fake it.

Very few flavors make me gasp in agonizing delight and very few places in NYC are as simplistically perfect as The Spotted Pig! Tucked away on the corner of W11th street sits The Spotted Pig. Adorned with a symbolic pig in the front, this place serves up real eats with big flavors. Put away the calorie counters, the food here doesn't care if you're a beat-nick vegetarian or a dietary bottom feeder looking for bland food just to suffice their appetite. This place is for real, they serve hearty dishes with a flash of attitude and a whole lot of flavor!First thing you'll notice upon entering the restaurant is the decor/ambiance - simple, warm and cozy. The wait staff are all noticeably punk with most painted with tattoos and quick to serve up a snarky yet playful conversation.. add on top of that they are extremely knowledgeable not just on the food but the beer and wine list as well. It's fun eating at a place where even the staffers are in on how damn good the food is. After situating myself at my table, I quickly jumped into the lunch menu. First up were the deviled eggs. It's true what they say... good things come in small packages. Despite its size, this dish delivers not just texture-wise, but with a balance of salt meets creamy eggy goodness. Layer on what looked like pepper flakes and this dish hit home instantly. Before I could gather my senses for the next onslaught of flavor.. came the big daddy of them all...the chicken liver pate'. Never in my life have I tasted a dish so simple and yet so full of rich flavors and textures. The bread - soft, the pate' - creamy and smothering the bread like a teenage lover. A few more pieces of that dish and I wouldn't have been able to finish my meal. Definitely a hearty appetizer, it laid the groundwork for what's to come - the burger....Finally, the Cheeseburger w/ Roquefort cheese landed on my table with shoestring fries falling all around it. To say that the cheese was rich is an understatement. The burger was unreal and one of the best burgers I've ever had in NYC.. hands down... In ending, The Spotted Pig is a place for people who love their food rich and flavorful and who aren't afraid to pack on a few pounds in the process of enjoying one of the best burgers in NYC.

On the inside however, the bun is the lightest, most fluffy, bread you can find.The beef is also noteworthy, juicy and crumbly, but sturdy enough not to fall apart. The shoestring fries that came with the burger was also laudable. They were incredibly thin, had a crisp shell, and smelled faintly like garlic.

Our friends came earlier and they said the wait was only 30 minutes, so we rushed over. However, by the time we got there, it was an hour long. The host wrote down our name and then also mentioned if we find a seat at the bar, we could order from the full menu!So we head upstairs and quickly find a seat. There are drink menus laid out but no food menus. I was confused at first and didn't know if we were supposed to order at the bar along with our food, but it turns out there is a specific waitress who takes orders for people sitting at the bar! But be careful not to try to order from any one else, some of the waiters/waitresses are rude as hell if you're not a part of their section. So my boyfriend and I order drinks and then we get started on the food. We got marinated olives, the sweet corn soup, sauteed squid, and pork belly. We originally had planned to get a burger, but didn't anticipate coming here because we heard how bad the wait could be, so we passed on that.Every plate was delicious. Flavorful, good presentation, all that junk. So we are finishing up our food and decide to get dessert. However, our friends who came by before us a little bit earlier that night insisted that we HAD to get the burger. My boyfriend and I are both pretty full at this point... but decide why not. It's our last night, we might as well try it. So I order the vanilla ice cream with blueberries and he decides to get the burger. The blueberries are cooked with Hendricks gin, and the ice cream is perfect. Best dessert. After, the burger comes out.The shoestring fries it comes with are really good. The thing I typically hate about thin fries is that it's mostly just crunchy with no bit of softness of the potato, but these definitely did not lack that! They were delicious. And the burger... it basically just comes on a brioche bun, with no onions, lettuce, or anything that's on a traditional burger. However, there is bleu cheese, mmmm. Also, a thing to note, a lot of the waiters/waitresses were really rude, but ours was awesome. I wish I could remember her name but she was wearing glasses and a sleeveless shirt.

There are no reservations, and the wait time for dinner can be atrocious on any day of the week.  If you show up past 7pm, be prepared to wait at LEAST 1 hour (more likely 2 hours for a party of 4).  The Pig appears to have a much higher ratio of two-top tables, so coming with a party of 2 will help considerably with quicker seating.  If you must ditch the rest of your party for the sake of delicious comfort pub food, so be it.  Another con that comes with the packed house: slow service.  But I could even see how long it took our server to weave through the crowd to get to our table each time...My must-order dishes include the chicken liver toast, sheep's milk ricotta gnudi, and roasted quail.  The burger's roquefort cheese is a bit too salty but I do love the accompanying rosemary shoestring fries!It's not cheap, it's not convenient, but it's certainly delicious!  Is it worth the hype and the exorbitant wait times?  Still undecided.  I would recommend stopping by The Pig first to put your name on the list and give your mobile number, and then head off to one of the many amazing bars in the vicinity to chill at while you wait for a table.  Keep drinking, stay happy, and you will be eating Chef Bloomfield's finest in no time.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Despite that, Spotted Pig one of those perfect places in the city where once you're inside your transported to somewhere in distant London. The darkness and low lighting make this restaurant cozy and the crampness reminds you that even after so many years this is one of the hottest spots in NYC. After a recent 2 hour wait for a table, sitting down and devouring the famous burger makes it all worth it. The cocktails are classic and with two bars there's usually room to kick back and wait for your table. Service is on par.

Couple of minutes later, the host got changed. Other party walked-in showing their text message to the new host, and he escorted them. After the new host came back to the station, I said I checked-in before they came in and asked why did you give our table to the other party.

And really - is there a better reason for a random road trip than good food and drink?!In any case, we arrived at The Spotted Pig a bit on the later side for dinner, I want to say around 10:00pm. But there was no rush as the kitchen doesn't close till 2am. We didn't have a reservation and there was a little bit of a wait - maybe 15 minutes or so - until we were seated. And the place was full - but not overwhelmingly so. The first floor features a compact bar with a small dining room. The second floor offers more tables, another bar and is a bit more spacious - that's where we were seated.The place is warm, cozy and chock full of various pig things - no surprise there. Low lighting and a very relaxed feel - intimate, but with great energy. Groups maneuvered in and out with little difficulty despite the small space. We split the burger and my companion was rather delighted that every available surface of the bun was toasted. The accompanying shoestring fries were addictive. Before that we went a bit devious and ordered the Deviled Eggs AND the Devils on Hoseback (bacon wrapped oysters), which were polished off in very short order. And the gnudi - heavenly little dumplings filled with ricotta - is a must. I'm salivating just thinking about the dish. There are no words to describe the extent of the melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. As for beverages, he ordered a few beers and I stuck with the Pimm's Cup -  pleasant reminder of my time spent in England.

Lines that last no less then an hour and that's if your lucky.But I am not here to speak of shacks I am here to speak of a burger which in deed blew me away. You can not compare it to places like shake shack or 5 guys.This is a masterpiece which does not need ketchup or mustard or even the one cheese you are elected to choose.A masterpiece largely in part to a butcher named pat lafrieda based in north Bergen, nj.Lafrieda is a true master at his craft and a genius in crafting burger blends. Blends which he will not make for any other eatery.The blend that he has created for the spotted pig is truly outrageous.A mix which I have heard is chuck, short rib and brisket. It has a unique flavor one of upmost taste. A truly perfect blend and is cooked right on. A nice char with an amazing juiciness.The burger is laid between a grill toasted brioche which is the perfect vehicle to house the burger to is next destination - your mouth.The bun Is not overly thick or hides the burger. It has the right bun to buger ratio. Which is sooooo important but sometimes forgotten.The order comes with Magnificent crisp shoe string fries with crispy tossed garlic chips.To top it off.

Food: Burger with Roquefort Cheese and Shoestring Fries.  I don't usually wax poetic about burgers, but here goes: the first bite was curiously garlicky and rather healthy tasting.  Cheese was definitely a great counterpoint.  Buns were ok, and everything worked well together.  And OMG, the shoestring fries were delicious!  A mountain of perfectly crispy, freshly and thinly shredded potatoes, fried with thin slices of garlic and tossed with rosemary leaves and generously doused in salt.  It took three glasses of water to counteract the salt.  Also, this is the first time I've walked away from unfinished fries.  Felt full and had barely made a dent.  I suppose two meals out of $17 isn't so bad...2.

Okay, so maybe I was just trying to snub this place, but I really can't. Those shoestring fries are perfect. They're addictive - well-seasoned, super crispy, and not greasy at all. I ate with my friend, who probably usually has a bigger appetite than I do, but I somehow ate way more of my fries than he did of his. The burger itself was delicious and cooked just under medium for me. The brioche bun was also slightly crisp on the outside but nice and fluffy inside. We also had 6 oysters, which were slightly salty and briny. It sated my oyster craving. Cocktails here are also great - I had the Italian soda, which had just the right amount of gin and had a great housemade fruit syrup. I could have drank that cocktail all night. The wait is a bit annoying - on a Thursday night at around 6:50, we were told that there would be a 1-1.5 hour wait. We gave them our number and were called back 45 minutes later.

I successfully steered them away from Magnolia Bakery, although I think the tsunami of inappropriate tube tops, orange tans and big earrings washing over the sidewalk might also have had something to do with it.The next target was The Spotted Pig. Very charismatic space and staff although I have to admit that, in all my visits to the UK, I've never met anyone quite as laddish the waiters here. Everyone decided on the famed burgers. During the short wait for our food I entertained myself by watching Danny Bonaduce's dinner companion eat his entire entree. Stand up for yourself, man! My companions hadn't heard of Mr Bonaduce. Oh, kids.The rosemary shoestring fries were very tasty, but the burgers were horrible. Salty, salty, salty. Like triple-salto-with-a-twist salty. A hush descended over the table as the bubble of hype rapidly deflated.Being the designated grumpy codger of the day, I flagged down our waiter to notify him of the salt lick situation at our table. Not unpleasantly, he responded that Roquefort is a very salty cheese and that's probably what it was. Errr...so do we all agree these burgers are too salty? The kiddies were starting to look uncomfortable, expecting a tirade, so I let the matter drop with a simple request that the kitchen go easier on whatever it is that makes these burgers so very salty.With nothing left to say, we made ready to leave. Meanwhile, at the Bonaduce table Danny's plate was in the final stages of being polished clean.I probably won't return to find out if the salt licks were a random misfire (although I am sort of curious about what Danny Bonaduce got that his companion enjoyed so much). There are far better things I could do with $17.Besides, a gypsy told me that every time someone eats one of those hideously salty burgers an angel dies of hypertension.

My first impression upon arrival is how unassuming the place is. Blink and you'll walk right past it. My co-worker remarked, ""if I didn't know, I would've thought this place was a florist shop."" (it is indeed flanked by shrubs and flowers and foliage.) We went inside and it did open up nicely. You can tell that they don't take themselves TOO seriously when it comes to ambiance and decor. The hostess was incredibly nice and we were seated upstairs within minutes. Service was good as we had a waitress and an ""associate-waiter."" (they kind of alternated helping us; filling our water, clearing our plates, etc, etc). I started off with the chicken liver toast which was very good. I ordered the burger with shoestring fries. The burger was cooked nicely (medium, like I asked), but I wasn't a fan of the roquefort cheese. I would've preferred almost ANY other cheese. The bun was nice and buttery. I was NOT a fan of the shoestring fries however. They WERE tasty, and cooked nicely, but they were SO THIN that they are actually hard to eat, and the amount of work it takes to get them into your mouth isn't worth the payoff when you get them there. I was seriously underwhelmed with my lunch entree. Another knock is that it took a LONG time to get the food. I understand that you need time to cook things right but it seemed like an inordinate amount of time for 2 medium rare steaks, a medium burger and some braised oxtail. I would LOVE to go back and give dinner a try, or at the very least go for lunch but try something else. My co-workers got the flank steak, beets and greens, and the ox-tail, both of which looked delicious and came with happy reviews. For dessert we all split the ginger, walnut and amaretto cake (one of our party is allergic to chocolate so we couldn't get the flourless chocolate cake like we wanted!) and it was good, yet very much like a carrot cake. Its a shame because I LOOOOOOVE carrot cake, so this seemed like carrot cake with something missing. *sigh*I SO wanted to love this place. And seriously, like a battered wife, I think that maybe I'M to blame for picking the food I chose. But as a review, I just can't HIGHLY recommend it to anyone else.

Yes please!Olives and Pickles.....lovely.The Burger was insane.  Med/Rare, juicy as all hell, wonderful bun and Roquefort cheese....I really had to force the last of it down I was so full and like a jerk I ordered the flourless chocolate cake.  Food Coma followed.The House Bitters was excellent as well as the Salty Dog and Dark and Stormy with housemade ginger beer.

1773,pEs2YyhA7leY1De_riu2Ew,Michael B.,5.0 star rating,"THE BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER EATENThe Spotted Pig doesn't serve British food. I know because I tasted a lot of flavours that day, but disappointment wasn't amongst them. It's OK, I can say that, I'm British. I grew up disappointed by most things I was forced to stick a fork in...That said, all my life I've been a burger lover, on a hunt for the world's greatest burger, but I can finally rest now that I know it exists and it's on the menu at the Spotted Pig. Now I've had good burgers,  even in Britain, but I had never before had anything quite so perfect as that which I tasted that day (roughly a month ago) at this Village Eatery I'd hitherto never heard of.The Upside:Screw the starters. I mean, I remember them being good (I think there was something called a 'Devil on Horseback', a bacon wrapped Date if you can imagine such a thing), but who gives a toss? It's all about the main course, baby.I'm convinced that that burger reached the innermost recesses of my soul and opened my mind to the cosmos. In the flavour I could taste the whole happy life of the cow before it willingly sacrificed itself for my meal - and I was one with that cow. Although no such music was playing, I heard the elaborate guitar-work of Jimmy Hendrix in my mind and I KNEW I would never taste a burger this divine ever again.I openly wept.The Downside: Staff weren't ready with Napkins to mop up my tears of joy. Also, I couldn't get 'Purple Haze' out of my head for like... two days...Over all, it was a positive experience. There was a friendly atmosphere, the people dining at the tables next to us offered us suggestions and encouragement on what to purchase, and although the staff didn't stand out particularly, they did provide efficient service and were in no way 'bad', so I can't really grumble. The only real con is the price, and that's only if you're not prepared to spend a lot of money.

They had a touch of cinnamon tasting brown butter / sage, spawning a sweet but heavenly taste.    We also had some prunes wrapped in bacon and dipped in honey, known affectionately as Devil's on Horseback .  It was so divine that I could've eaten a whole plate full of them.  The clam chowder was soupy, but full of flavor.  They weren't skimpy with the meat as it was quite a hearty bowl.  The main attraction of the night was the hamburger which didn't disappoint.  It was juicy, semi-large, and full of flavor.  The shoe string fries were a nice touch, probably to allow more to room to finish the food, similar to the lobster roll at Pearl Oyster.The bill on the other hand was another story.  While the food is good, the prices are fairly up there.  Two people with drinks, an appetizer or two, plus an entree could easily hit $100 with tip.  Its recommended to split appetizers and share entrees so that the cost per person isn't too overwhelming.  Long love the pig!",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

1798,B08pOioEJr60DLO21ibFGA,Iris Y.,4.0 star rating,"Saturday night: 7:45pm.My guy suggested The Spotted Pig. I previously had drinks here but not food and was interested in trying it out. Spotted Pig takes no reservations but there are plenty of bars to chill and have a drink while waiting for a table. There are two bars at The Spotted Pig (upstairs and downstairs) but don't bother drinking there - over-priced beverages and very crowded seating. You'll be bumped into more times than you can count. But if you're insistent on staying, then go for the upstairs bar - it's slightly mellower as most tourists don't know it exists. We chose to get drinks at a French wine bar called Rouge where the bartender will offer you free wine tastings.We put in our names around 6:45, had a drink at Rouge and were called back to The Spotted Pig by 7:45pm.We were given a table upstairs to the left of the bar in a intimate and cozy room. We had an amazing table where we sat side-by-side on a banquette with plenty of leg room. This alcove off to the left of the bar is the place to be seated - very romantic and all 6 tables had ample room. We couldn't even hear the couples on either side of us. The service was pleasant and quick. Our young (and possibly foreign?) waitress knew exactly what she was doing and was friendly and efficient. We ordered the Chicken Liver Toast (A+), their famous burger (A) and their Oxtail dish (B).The Chicken Liver Toast was the highlight. Perfectly rich on a thick slab of bread. The burger lived up to expectations and contrary to some reviews on here, ours was not too salty or overpowering in terms of the cheese. The oxtail was a solid B. The oxtail and the potato puree that came with it were delicious but I did not like the bitter greens that came on top. It's a personal preference as I'm sure some people would enjoy it but I dislike cilantro and it tasted too much like a cilantro green.I wish there was more variety to the menu but i appreciate the care that goes into the limited menu.

We didn't actually try the food, but everything we saw them serving was beautiful and looked so scrumptious we'll no doubt go back to have a taste next time.

I just can't say enough for the quaint and hip, yet laid back ""flea market chic"" of design of The Spotted Pig and the friendly, helpful staff.

I've read some of the other reviews and can see why this would be a long wait, or celebrity attraction, but I would just recommend going early and taking in the more laid back late afternoon / early evening scene when you can enjoy it a little more and not feel rushed or claustrophobic.

It was good but not great. Certainly not $15 good. I think you really get your money's worth with the burger and the fries. The fries exceeded my expectations. It was gooooood. And the burger was very juicy. It looked a little too rare to be medium though but still good. The beer was awesome! Chicken liver toast was good too, bang for its buck.This place has a lot of character. I can tell why people would love this place. Especially the people who are homesick for a British pub or likes anything British. Staff is very friendly. Wonderful little garden out front. Very English or what I imagine to be English.

This place doesn't take reservations, and there is a long wait to get in depending on what night & time you come. We came on a Sunday at 8:30 p.m., at which point there was a one hour wait. Totally worth it.The Chicken Liver Toast was a fantastic combination of savory & sweet. The friend that I split it with and I have decided to experiment with recipes until we can make it at home- we just can't imagine our dinner parties with out it! I also had the Octopus, and definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to try a tentacle-themed dish for the first time. It was char-grilled, and the salad around it made spearing for the protein kind of fun. The decor of The Spotted Pig was my favorite of New York. It glowed with wild abandonment.

Because I am not a 80 year old who enjoys eating dinner at 5PM nor am I cool enough to be out at 11PM on a school night. So when the suggestion of Spotted Pig on MLK came up, I was disdainful.We grabbed a few beers at the nearby White Horse Tavern while making bets on college basketball via our smartphones like the degenerate gamblers we are and surprisingly enough, the hour wait flew by. The reservationist called my boyfriend promptly at one hour later and said ""We have a table open for two...but it's a pretty romantic spot. Are you a couple or just friends?""  I sort of loved that she asked us this. We took the romantic seat which wasn' really romantic given you're squished next to other diners on either side of you but at this point, we were famished. Deviled eggs were an OBV choice as was the chicken liver toast. The eggs were tasty but paled in comparison to the creamy and decadent chicken liver toast. Heaped with delicious chicken innards, this is the stuff culinary dreams are made of.  Even my nonadventurous eater of a boyfriend declared this was the best (well, only) chicken liver toast he had ever consumed.We shared the famous Roquefort burger with shoe string fries and we decided to order a side of kale for our greens. Fortunately for me, the kale was drenched in bacon fat. Fine by me. The burger was interesting - from a meat perspective, it was perfectly juicy and flavorful. I did find the Roquefort to be a tad overpowering at times.

The meat was just amazing and juicy and you could tell it wasn't your avg burger patty.  The cheese added a great touch, though don't get it if you don't like Rocquefort because the cheese can be overwhelming (it wasn't in my opinion though).  It's just a shame that this burger doesn't come with the option of other cheeses.- The gnudi was good but I don't think it deserves all the hype its been getting, the deviled eggs were good, but nothing special.Overall a great meal, I would definitely come back here again and get the liver toast and probably the burger.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

The brioche bun was slightly overwhelming, but it didn't stop me from inhaling the burger... in part due to a craving and also the fact that the wait was a little long... so I was hungry. The shoestring fries were a little too thin for them to be memorable.

JG Mellon on the UES or the Spotted Pig in the West Village. As fate was in charge we grabbed a cab and headed to the Pig for one of their trade mark burgers. From memory we arrived at 8pm. Big mistake. The guy at the front told us it would be an hour and half wait. What the?? After downing a few ales at the bar an hour had passed and we were getting hungry and impatient. I decided to try and bribe the door guy. Probably not the best attempt or maybe i should have gone higher than a 20 but at the end of the day its a burger not a lobster or caviar. Finally we were called up stairs and we sat down. The waiter was fairly average but he did manage to get our oysters out to us relatively quickly. These were below average and for the cost ($36 for a dozen) i expected a lot better. We each ordered the burger that came garnished with shredded fries. The burger is amazing soft and full of flavor. They only use a heavy blue cheese and that certainly is enough. My friends on the other hard werent impressed. Does the place have a great burger? yes. Is it worth an hours and a half wait? Hell no.

No lettuce, tomatoes or pickles to confuse the product. It is not hyperbole when I say that it is probably the best hamburger I've ever eaten.  The meat was tender and perfectly cooked.  Most importantly, it was moist and not greasy.   The blue cheese was flavorful but not overpowering.  It was just a great burger.  Anyone who is not impressed with this burger must provide the name of a restaurant that serves a better burger.The thinly cut fries were also very good.  Last of all, we also ordered the chicken liver toast. If you don't like liver, foie gras or pate, then you're going to hate it.   My friends, who are not adventurous eaters, hated the chicken liver. Thankfully for me, I grew up eating pate, foie gras, liver and onions and all kinds of animal parts and I thought it was very good.  I got to eat most of it by myself. One man's trash is another man's treasure.Some people complain that the food is too expensive and the wait is not worth it. Sure, if you live in NY, you don't want to wait 45 mins to eat an $18 dollar burger every week.  It's probably not worth it.

Fantastic entree-Grilled Skirt Steak with Pickled Vegetables & Crispy Shallots:  This was just okay.  If you're deciding b/w this and something else, I'd recommend something else.  The cilantro + skirt steak was a surprisingly good combo, but a little one-note after a while.  I did not dislike this dish at all, but probably not worth it.For a drink I got a cask bitter, which was excellent.  I saw a couple reviews saying they had a great selection of beer.  I would not agree with that.None of the desserts tempted me, which is weird.  Maybe next time I'll try one, but I wish they'd mix it up a little here.The bad: We got lucky, but some of the tables would be pretty awful places to have a nice dinner.   Also, if you're worried about it, there is going to be a wait.  Not a huge deal with some nice bars nearby (the SP's bar is way too cramped to enjoy a drink or two while you wait for dinner).  As an aside, the hostess didn't offer to take our mobile # as they say they will do on their website.  Again, not a huge deal, just something to be aware of-not sure they really offer that service.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

After seeing how perfect it looked, I knew I had to try it. I also read how good it was too, so I definitely needed to try it - and that I did.My friend and I stopped by prior to dinner starting, so it was surprisingly empty to what I expected. I personally was expecting a long wait, due to all the reviews I read and the notoriety this restaurant has. We were told to go upstairs to the bar, and that we did. We looked at the beer menu and quickly picked Old Speckled Hen Ale, which was delicious. Good beer gets a plus from me.The atmosphere here reminds me of an old dark restaurant, which is probably what  it is supposed to do. The clientele was mixed, I honestly felt a bit too young and hip for the place, but it didn't really bother us. We were there for one thing, the burger.The waitstaff was really attentive as well. Sitting at the bar, a gentlemen told us that our table was ready, then while waiting at the table around 3 people in a span of ten minutes asked us if we needed any water or specials. Some of the specials did sound good, but we had our heart set on that burger.We ordered the Spotted Pig burger, which has roquefort cheese, and a pile of shoestring fries on the side. I have been weary of shoestring fries since my first visit at Stand, but these are very good. The burger itself, was so picturesque - that bun, the ratio - it was great. I was ready to be overwhelmed by the saltiness, but for me personally it wasn't bad - the cheese probably makes it so. I definitely paced myself and enjoyed every ounce of the meal. It wasn't really filling - but very satisfying. I'm definitely coming back for that burger.After sitting around wondering what our next step was going to be, we decided to try our hand at dessert. I've heard of this magical banoffe pie, but I did not see it on the menu, nor was it mentioned until our server said ""The seasonal tart is a banoffe"" - my eyes lit up and I ordered that right away.This was my thought process upon eating the banoffe.""Best. Dessert. Ever. So. Good. Don't Want It To End"" - it was a foodgasm.I wish I could've ordered the whole pie itself, it was so heavenly. I hope to run into it again.The Spotted Pig has a great burger, probably the prettiest in New York City. The banoffe is probably one of the best desserts I've tasted in my life.

The waiter was prompt and we chose the ""roll mops"" for pre-dinner. Great, light choice. We both had the ""char-grilled burger"". The bun was grilled and the patty was a nicely portioned. My meat was not cooked as well as medium well as I like but the term also means different things to different chefs. I will say, though, that the Roquefort cheese has a robust flavor.

Pigs ears over endive with capers and lemon. I had to try and it was well worth the 15 bucks! Deep fried is something I stay away from but hey once in awhile will not kill you!  I ordered the burger and the wife the gnudi, we split each and I honestly can't say if I liiked one better than the other. They both were that good! And the shoestrings that came with the burger were very tasty with rosemary. Had a side of kale and bacon, kale was cooked to perfection and very tender. Come to think of it everything was cooked to our liking, medium rare for the burger was perfect!Finished off the meal with a homemade vanilla ice cream with toasted almonds, that was on the special board.

1875,e2uE3ECjFIzDendKs1AFXA,Tanster M.,4.0 star rating,"I'd heard about this place from various food blogs but when I saw that the menu had Deviled Eggs on it, I knew I had to taste them.  Deviled Eggs are something on my ""Must Try"" list.  In any case, taking heed of the warnings about crowds and long waits, I decided to come here late since the kitchen doesn't close until 2am.  I got here around 11:30pm on a bitterly cold Sunday evening (27 degrees F) aiming to avoid the crowds and I had my pick of tables and zero wait  The low tables and stool (albeit cushioned) seating took me by surprise but it was either sit on the stools or the rather high banquet bench for the low table so I made do and opted for the stool:  No big deal if the food is good.As per my uploaded photos of each dish, the Deviled Eggs were nicely garnished but I didn't taste anything but the eggs.  Some places have too much vinegar in it so you don't know if the eggs just went bad or whether its too much vinegar but here you just couldn't taste much of anything except egg.  Where was the zing from the chilli peppers/flakes that I'd heard of?  I couldn't taste it.  Neither could I taste any vinegar but that's a plus.  So that was a bit disappointing since Deviled Eggs normally send a shiver down my spine--here, there was no shiver, more like ""meh"".  On the other hand, I liked the Sweetbreads.  Unlike other places which cook them all the way through, here it was crispy on the outside with a somewhat soft center.  The Devils on Horseback (prunes stuffed with maybe pear chunks and wrapped in bacon) weren't quite what I'd normally go for--a little war was being fought between the sweet and the savory in one dish.  The Chicken Liver Toast was a scrumptious throwback to my early years dining on Chicken Liver Paté on toast.  To anybody who has ever had that, this is a freshly-made recreation.  The Pork Belly Faggot was basically a stuffed cabbage shell with caul fat wrapped around pork belly and vegetable chunks.  Very delicious but heavy and a meal for a cold season like the Winter we're undergoing right now.  Perfect.  The side dish, Beets and Greens would've been great except for the salt content--they overdid the salt so much that even I, a salt lover, was overwhelmed.  It was like trying to eat a dish of solid salt where the occasional taste of a sweet beetroot peeked through occasionally.  This could've been a magnificent side dish if they'd just eased off on the salt somewhat.There are gastropubs and there are gastropubs but just for the food alone, I'd come back. That they also have Belgian Lambic ales is icing on the cake for me.  Pity they only have Framboise and no other flavor (there's more than Framboise, Peche and Kriek).  It'll just have to be late though, as I don't like waiting nor having too many neighbors:  11:30pm was just the ticket to evade the crowds.  But maybe just after 10pm would've been workable also.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

1879,DK1s8q9tte-jxCMFvJhiCQ,Vanessa X.,3.0 star rating,"On a snow-laden Friday night, we arrived at 6:45PM and were told 45 minute wait time. Skipped to White Horse Tavern next door, blissfully unpacked, and passed the time. Walking in it was all faces and darkness and the sensation of entering someone's dinner party. In other words, this restaurant screams homey-ness. We had to wait another 5 minutes before we were taken upstairs to an even more intimate space where conversation hummed and waiters could be seen rushing to and fro carrying mysterious creations on white platters.Some of the spaces were very romantic. VERY romantic. Great place for a fourth date. If there is a definition for nook and cranny, this is it. Our waiter was slightly stoned. I did not expect the Spotted Pig to be so bohemian and yet it also very Montana mountain cabin meets Brooklyn Heights. Our waiter lolled his eyes, swung his hips and fidgeted while answering our menu questions. One question I had was if the dishes I wanted had dairy, because I do not eat dairy. (I know what you're thinking, why are you in this restaurant??) Anyway, I finally picked the Roasted Hen of the Woods Mushrooms with Duck Egg & Pine Nuts. I am not a French/British food connoisseur but when I see the word ""Hen"" I take it to mean there is some kind of poultry in the dish. I also ordered some rosemary shoestring fries and my companion ordered the Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi with Brown Butter & Sage.My dish comes, and I pick at it, trying to figure out in the dark lighting if the striated black structure on my plate was the sinewy proteins of a chicken shoulder. I tentatively took a bite: it was a mushroom. Mystified, I look again at the duck egg and could not bear the suspense any longer. I called my stoned waiter over and asked if this was the roasted hen dish. He said yes. I pointed to the duck egg and said ""but this is an egg."" He looked momentarily confused and then after re-reading the menu clarified the issue for me: the Hen of the Woods Mushroom is to be read together as one phrase. Hen of the Woods is an adjective, not a noun, and most definitely not chicken.Fooled! I felt scammed.The rosemary shoestring fries were yummy when hot, limp when cold. The roasted Brussels sprouts were fine but way too buttery for me. And the Roasted Hen of the Woods Mushrooms? Drenched in balsamic vinegar.

I was originally very excited about eating at The Spotted Pig after I heard its chef, April Bloomfield, had won a James Beard award.Fast forward to 10:45am in early November, I was standing outside the restaurant in a line with quite a number of other people waiting for the restaurant to open at 11am. Given that this restaurant does not take reservations, you have to get in line before it opens to guarantee yourself a seat. We were quickly seated upstairs and ordered our food. By around 11:15am, we received our chicken liver toast (appetizer). The dish was quite delicious (provided that you like chicken liver to begin). However, I was a little put off by the presentation of the dish (and being someone who grew up eating all sorts of organs, I'm not one to be put off by appearances... generally). It literally looked like dung on toast. I'm not sure this can be helped too much since chicken liver looks like that, but maybe some greenery as a garnish would have helped a bit.As we happily devoured our chicken liver toast, we eagerly awaited our main food to arrive. All around us, tables were gradually getting seated (I think they might make people stand around at the bar for a while before they seat them so that they can stagger food service). By around noon, we were getting a little antsy and main courses had begun to arrive for tables around us even though we were the first party seated in our area and also the first to order. We asked the waiter about our food, and he told us it was the next to come out and that they put tickets with appetizers to the back of the line after the appetizer comes out. This seems a little idiotic to me, but moral of the story is, don't order appetizers... or if you do, ask for them with your main course. Regardless, our food was not the next to come out. Or even next after that. By around 12:15pm, about an hour after we ordered, our food finally came out. From a food perspective, the restaurant was actually pretty good. The seafood chowder and pumpkin pancake were both delicious and unique. However, the portion sizes were on the smaller side, and at $15-20 per entree, I think a bit overpriced. The shoestring fries were good as well. As a personal preference, I would have preferred them have a fleshier (soft) inside and crispy outside, but these shoestring fries are thoroughly fried and basically just crunchy. They're still well-seasoned and delicious, but don't expect what you would normally think of as a fry... they were more like a potato chip.Overall, the restaurant would deserve 4 stars for the food. However, the slow service and lack of value are a little bit hard to overlook in this case. Since I went here, I've had conversations with other people about this restaurants and all opinions seem to be positive on food, but quite negative on service. It was worth the experience to go once, but this restaurant isn't getting added to my brunch rotation.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Perfectly cooked and so flavorful with just the juicy beef, roquefort cheese and grilled brioche bun, I couldn't bring myself to garnish it in anyway.  The fries are good, very thin, served like a pile of potato hay, again, too flavorful to bury under a condiment.  They are best eaten hot and salty straight up.My wife had the daily special of home-made ham, and the roasted carrots.  The ham was actually supposed to be an appetizer, but since she ordered it as a dinner they supplemented it with some great thick slices of toast and home-made mustard so she could actually make a ham sandwich out of it, which she did.  The carrots were maybe the best tasting vegetable dish I have ever had, they were so savory.  I think on could live on those carrots.One thing to keep in mind: the tables are small and close, and you may be seated on a stool, padded yes, but a stool none the less.  I actually took a star off for that.If you don't mind eating at 6pm, or if you are doing a show after dinner, try going early and avoiding the wait.  Or just pass the time quaffing delicious british ales.  Your call.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

It looks as incredible in person as it does in photos- the bun has perfect chargrill lines, the patty is a perfect disc. It's extremely simple- no lettuce, tomato, or onion- but it really doesn't need any other fixings besides the roquefort cheese. Add some of the shoestring fries (which are delicious and crispy and garlic-y), and you will seriously consider going for a second round.My only qualm is the price- $20? Seriously? It's delicious, but it doesn't even come with a mesclun salad or something- just a ginormous heap of the shoestring fries. Even if the ingredients are costly, $20 is a bit much for a burger, even if it is one of the best in the city. Burger fiends should certainly try it at least once, but there are comparable ones out there for less.Also, the deviled eggs are delicious- since there's only two, I would suggest saving your server a trip to the kitchen and just ordering your own instead of attempting to split a plate because you're probably going to consider ordering more.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

We were seated straight away upstairs in a cozy little corner. The service is amazing, everyone is so friendly and un-pretentious. I love the atmosphere too, I lived in London for six years and The Spotted Pig definitely recreates the vibe of an upscale British gastropub. Now for the food.. we started with one order of the deviled eggs. I wish we had ordered two servings, it was delicious! We then  shared the sheep's milk ricotta gnudi and the blue cheese burger. The gnudi was one of the best things I've ever eaten, next time I go I will order a full serving for myself! The burger was good but I'm not a HUGE fan of blue cheese so the flavor was a little overwhelming for me. My husband was here for a work dinner on a different night and had the pork belly which he highly recommended. The wine selection was also very good.We stayed for some extra drinks after our meal in the bar area, it had really filled up, by 9pm it was packed on a Monday night!

I ate it, don't get me wrong, but the amount of salt was impressive. The pig's ear was good, not really exotic, reminding me more of thanksgiving stuffing than anything else.

1931,qC9OHq-vBnKhrFKrEc5oMw,Jim U.,1.0 star rating,"There is an old saying, ""Don't cast your pearls before swine.""  Allow me to update it:  ""Don't waste your money at the Spotted Pig.""On the occasion of my 400th review, I am going to highlight the worst Michelin-starred restaurant I have ever had the pleasure of knowing.  I arrived alone early on a week night, and the hostess explained that if I wanted a table, the wait would be over an hour, but I could just eat at the bar, and she recommended the bar upstairs since it would be a bit quieter.   Said bar had 9 seats with all of them occupied.  Unfortunately there was very little area to stand.  All of the tables were taken, and people were clamoring around with their drinks.  Food runners were passing by me about every minute or so.  I constantly had to keep moving to one side or another.  20 minutes passed.  At this point, I decided to just stick it out.  I figured someone would finish their drinks and I could finally take a place at the bar, but that was not going to happen anytime soon.  Other people started to arrive, and were deciding whether to wait it out too.   Most left, but after 50 minutes, a group of 3 came and decided to wait.  I am pretty certain they wanted to jump in front of me since three of the people were getting ready to leave, but my patience was exhausted and I wasn't about to allow it.  I finally got a seat after 63 minutes.  I should have just put my name on the list.  Observation #1:  Michelin starred restaurants normally take reservations, for good reason.  Observation #2:  For a Michelin-starred restaurant, this place is unique since the majority of the business was focused on drinking beer, with no less than 3 bars in the place.  Time to eat.  The newly seated group was given their menu first and ordered first.  I then had to ask for a menu for myself.  The place is very popular for their hamburger and fries, which does not sound like a very difficult dish to prepare culinarily.  I opted for something more interesting, the crispy pork belly served with bean puree and a small selection of greens.   To drink, I had their house specialty, the Spotted Pig bitter.  The beer was very light, but otherwise was okay.  The pork belly was just terrible.  Fried, greasy, lacking in flavor.  How could something so naturally delicious be transformed into a heavy mound of blandness?  It was so bad, I actually had to force myself to finish it.  Keep in mind that pork belly is the savory equivalent of ice cream, and like ice cream no one ever has trouble finishing it.  Not to be outdone, the greens were worse.  I couldn't identify what they were.  I also couldn't identify the antiseptic aftertaste they left in my mouth.  Was that bleach?  Honestly, I am asking.  Now the bean puree was tasty.  Unfortunately it is almost a cliche now to serve a pureed accompaniment next to a major protein -- a staid choice to be sure.  And the presentation was just boring.  It was the sort of dinner I would expect to have at a place like Applebee's.  Ambience.  The patrons and staff were consistently interesting but I say that ironically.  One of the gentlemen sitting at the bar offered me his hamburger and fries since he didn't want it.  I refused.  Then one of the servers dropped a tray of glasses at the bar which resulted in flying shards of glass departing in nearly every direction.  Another gentlemen sitting right next to me leaned in to get my attention, and warned me that one of the shards hit him and that I should be careful that there wasn't any broken glass that may have landed in my food.  Have I mentioned that this was a Michelin-starred restaurant?  Then one one of the patrons was finishing a night of standing up and drinking and decided to lean in over me while I was eating to pay her bill.  This culminated with her actually throwing the pen she used to sign the bill right over my shoulder, hitting me in the process.  Indeed, this was a very classy establishment.  The entire time it was so loud and distracting, a moment of culinary pleasure in a charming restaurant was just not going to be had here.  I was asked by the bartender how I liked everything.  I responded that I didn't like my dinner at all.  She said I should have said something sooner so that they could have taken the dish off of my bill.  She was very nice about it.  But I wasn't looking for a free meal, I was interested in evaluating their food.  And in my opinion, you have exactly one chance to get it right.  She did take the drink off of my bill which was a nice gesture.     Overall, this venue is just a popular bar that serves a supposedly decent hamburger.  If you want to eat anything else or you think that this place is in anyway more special than that due to all of the accolades it has received, you will be sorely disappointed.  But this is why Yelp is useful.  I can tell you about my very bad experience so that you will know better and not be taken in by the hype.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Unequivocally yes.Had a drink at the bar during our estimated 40-minute wait for Sunday Brunch (felt like and possibly was ~25 minutes). Enjoyed a Spotted Pig Bitter And a Captain Lawrence while admiring surrounding fine swine. Once seated and the menu investigation commenced, the vegetation outside kept my attention for a significant portion of time and delayed said exploration. Eventually opted for the delived eggs, Artichoke Salad, Half A Frittata, the Ginger Cake And a Piece Of the Flourless Chocolate cake--everything was legen-wait for it...-dary. Nevertheless, the ""eclectic"" tunes were bumpin' as the ubiquitous grilled cheeses stared at me with ""ha ha"" eyes (nowhere near as good as grilled cheese bedroom eyes).Overall, The Spotted Pig provides a refreshingly egalitarian approach to good food and drink despite cramped quarters with faux big shots (ourselves not excluded).

We ordered the pot of pickles, deviled eggs and gnudi to start. The pot of pickles was...interesting, but the deviled eggs were very good, a little lemony. The gnudi! Ah, well, like others have said, it is fantastic! You will dream about these! The textures and flavors are so wonderful!We also ordered the burger, the chowder and the stuffed pig's ear (a special). Those were all pretty good, but very salty. It was difficult to finish the shoestring fries and the chowder b/c of the salt level. For dessert, we has the creme caramel and the hazelnut ice cream.

If this one gets deleted again, rest assured there are plenty of social media channels out there for me to leave even worse reviews.I was invited by a friend to join their Sunday brunch, therefore did not realize beforehand that this was supposed to be a place for celebrity spotting. Had I known this I would have avoided the place completely.We arrived at 12:00, waited 2 hours to finally get seated at 14:00, after seeing through the window on the first floor 5 empty tables staying empty for more than 30 minutes. Apparently both the management and the infrastructure is really messed up, as we kept seeing kitchen staff going through the main door and the outdoor basement entrance all the time. I understand how some restaurants want to create hype by making their customers wait endlessly, but this was downright hideous.Service-wise, the waiters were relatively pleasant, rushing through the specials like they were in a spelling bee competition, but service was slow. Nobody came to check how we were doing after the orders arrived. We waited for about 15 minutes for the bills to finally arrive. We left the place at 15:50.Food-wise, I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich that came with arugula salad, dijon mustard, and caramelized onion compote. The mustard and onion compote eaten together with the melting cheese in small bites was pleasant, as the tangy flavors balanced out the heavy creaminess of the cheese. But honestly, as someone who cooks a lot, I'm not so sure this is worth $16. And $5 for a small glass of OJ... Or this thing they call ""shoestring fries""... It is a tiny place, and granted, we probably should have never been here for the purpose of eating. Perhaps ordering a couple of mimosas would have helped numbing us from feeling how tight the seating was and how clearly we could hear the people next table uttering every single word. (By the way, after we got seated, we knew there were others waiting outside; we just saw the seats next to us staying empty for another 30 minutes before they allowed more people in! I felt really bad for those who were still waiting outside in the cold.)Altogether I ended up paying $30 bucks, not too much in comparison with other places in New York, but very much if one considers the value for money and the opportunity cost.

After a 1.5 hr wait that turned out to be a 2 hr wait (to while away the hours, walk half a block west to Orient Express, where they make excellent cocktails), we got seated at an awkward table upstairs. My companion and I had to sit side-by-side against the wall facing other diners, with him trying to balance on the seam of the sofa. The pickles were inedibly salty. The stracciatella cheese appetizer was also doused in salt; the squash it was served over was saturated with a sharp vinegar that anesthetized our tastebuds for the duration of the dinner. The roquefort burger was meaningless; the meat insipid and the roquefort overpowering. The crispy skin on the pork belly was the consistency of shoe leather, i.e. impossible to cut with a knife (we brought it home, where our dog thoroughly enjoyed gnawing on it.) The shoestring fries got cold in about 30 seconds as they tend to do, having no substance at all. The waiter sneered ""no"" when I asked for mayonnaise (apparently, they don't ""do"" mayonnaise - like it's some kind of specialty fetish.) We couldn't ask for the check fast enough. This is the worst example of a restaurant hype gone bad. They're clearly serving more folks than they can cook for.

I also had the prosciutto and ricotta tart with marjoram, the prosciutto was nice and soft- this was such a delicious and well balanced dish. it was savory, creamy, and the tart was pillowy and flaky. The grilled skirt steak was just OK- i found it bland, and for the price the portion was far too small. There literally was just enough steak to fill a taco with. Not cool. The sauteed spinach was good, but it wasn't enough to save the steak. I should have known better than to order something so simple after seeing so many good plates on my way to my table.The seared arctic char with cauliflower and hazelnuts was amazing.

She does it more on the rare side, the flavor is fantastic whatever they put on it, its pretty much just meat and bun but done right. Something special about this burger. Same goes for the fries. The chicken liver toast was really good too! I had some local craft beer. I had roll-mops which is some British dish seems like of Jewish origins, its pickled herring - delicious!

I had a Bannofee - this seems to be a very British nostalgic dessert with cream, bananas, and toffee, seems to have took hold in places like Australia and South Africa, good dessert, that toffee is unmistakably Anglo. If I lived in NYC I would come here often, the rest of the menu looks very good, its just great simple food but still something a little different.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I had a special of the night for appetizer which was fried dumplings with prosciutto and mozzarella. The dumplings sat in a sauce that reminded me of a cheesy vodka sauce and it was lick the plate good.  Overall The Spotted Pig is a cool spot to grab some drinks and have good tasting burger.,The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

No problem finding a place to sit and it was quiet enough to carry on a conversation. The patrons were an eclectic mix of gay guys, Jersey suburban types, and late 40s/early 50s singles and couples. The food looked great (burgers piled high with thin French fries) so I might have to include dinner on my next visit. Tab before tax/tip for two tasty Dark and Stormies was $24.Stopped here again on a Friday night but this time for dinner. It was packed but we managed to carve out a spot by the window and had a couple drinks while we waited for a table to open (about 60-90 minutes). I had the halibut which was great and my friend had the plate of 5 sides, also delicious. This plus about 4-5 drinks was $104 before tax/tip.Returned 3/19/16- Good bloody mary but tiny and pricey $15- Great food: burger (4+), crispy thin fries (5), grilled cheese (4 - tasty onion relish)- $82 before tax/tip w/ beer, two bloodies",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Really great irish coffee and wulled wine, although the wine can get a little too saturated with spices.

The upstairs tables are covered with rough brown paper sheets [on top of the white table cloths, of course!] which makes a perfect surface for writing/drawing/whatever. I think our sheet was converted into either a business plan or a time line or both. I can't recall, because it all was blurred by two glasses of excellent Cotes du Rhone wine.

It was a beautiful Friday afternoon and we stopped in for a later lunch and got seated right away. The service was great and the ambiance was jovial with several surprisingly large parties for the size of the space but I think when it came to the burger my friend and I who are both not shy eaters were surprised at how salty the blue cheese actually was.

I had the cod and mashed potatoes, which was satisfying enough. My friends had the burgers, which were pretty much as amazing as one of them talked them up to be. We started with bacon wrapped something or others that were tasty but not nearly as good as the appetizer special - tender pork head, deep-fried. MMmm. I also had a really good white wine that I can't remember the name of but was suggested by our waiter so that's another point for him.

We had the turkey liver toast and the Roquefort burger with the shoestring fries. After being very confident about the meal here I brought a girl here on a Saturday morning. What a mistake - We waited for nearly an hour as it seemed like people who came in after us kept on cutting us in line and the staff was rude this time around. After having the amazing chicken liver toast and burger the first time, I thought it'd be natural to have the same. I don't know what changed in a span of 2 weeks but the chicken liver was absolute rank and smelled and tasted awful, the toast was burnt to a crisp. When I mentioned this to the waiter I was met with a disgusted look like the waitress had better things to do with his time and she firmly told me that's the way it's prepared and that's how it's always been. I informed her I had been there two weeks ago and it was great the first time. Then came our burgers, which I always order medium-rare, This burger was charred to a crisp, I could not believe how bad it was, that I refused to eat it. Once again, I spoke with the waitress and she claimed that I had ordered a Well-Done burger. Now that was just BS, my date and I were furious and I looked completely like a fool for recommending this establishment in the first place. To add insult to injury, the waitress seemed like she just wanted to keep the flow of people going.

I was okay waiting 45 minutes because I had heard good things about this place and specifically their burger. If their burger is one of their best and well known dishes they should not run out of it so early in the day. We were informed they were not only out of the burger but two other dishes on the menu by the time we sat down. Still we were starving so we stayed. We ordered a soup, salad, and a side of french fries. Why that took over an hour to come out is beyond me! It's not a big place. What made the experience even more frustrating was that the people next to us got their side of fries first, even though they ordered 45 minutes after us, and the order didn't acknowledge us until we started staring him down (55 minutes into our wait time for our food).

Then again, anything is great with bacon.

So a friend and I decided to go late night binge eating, and I had been dying to try The Spotted Pig.  I was afraid that because I had so many expectations that I would be let down somehow, how silly of me.  This place lived up to all hype I'd heard.  We ended up ordering five different plates (between two little girls) so that we could attempt to try everything! Deviled Eggs - They look ordinary enough, but after you take your first bite, you can tell they have something a little extra. Chicken Liver Toast - I could exist on this alone.  It was so rich and creamy, the toast was toasted to perfection.  This was pure nirvana... there just aren't enough words in the world to describe it. Crispy Pig's Ear with Lemon, Capers & Trevise - Oh geez.... I could feel my arteries clogging just at the site of this dish, but I couldn't help myself.  The ears were cooked to perfection.  If not done properly, pig's ears can turn out very tough to eat and not tender at all.  Obviously, they knew what they were doing. Seared Squid with Cilantro Butter & Fennel - What a surprise it was to get a little spicy kick at the end of first bite.  But absolutely a good surprise.  This dish was full of flavor, the squid was tender... I could go on and on. Rosemary Shoestring Fries - I love it when your fries have so much flavor and seasoning that for once you actually don't need ketchup, ranch, 1000 Island, whatever you normally use.

I started with the Sorrel Punch, which was exactly what I wanted -- something light, easy to drink, refreshing.  Then we tried 2 deviled eggs which were so smooth and so creamy.  We also tried the pork cheeks on toast, which were tender, filled with flavor, but that's about all I remember.  The burger, on the other hand, I do remember...take a look around and everyone else is ordering it too...it is that good.  The bun has perfect chargrill lines, and the roquefort cheese is really powerful.  You can tell the beef is quality (got mine medium as recommended per the waitress) -- it is so soft and tender you might not know it was beef except for the flavor!  The waitress recommended the Dogfish Head IPA to go with it, and yeah the combo went together really well.  The fries were out of this world as well...couldn't stop eating them as they're sprinkled with rosemary and garlic...ahhh to die for!  Shoestring style too which makes it all the better.  Don't miss this hidden (or not so hidden, depending on who you talk to) gem in the West Village.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Everything was way too salty, my husband ordered their signature burger. He is normally a huge fan of Roquefort but this burger was so salty, he had to scraped off the Roquefort and it was still not edible. The fries were good though.I ordered the sea bass and it was completely raw (I couldn't even cut it with my knife) and the sides (cauliflower and hazelnut - who can mess that up?) were way to salty. I sent the dish back and asked if I could get it removed from the check but the waitress told me that I had no choice and I had to have it because the kitchen already started preparing it. All in all, the appetizers/bar snacks and fries were good but it certainly wasn't worth a 3 hour wait. The food was so salty, I was dehydrated until the next day even though I barely ate the food!

The Spotted Pig does not take reservations. I called around 6:30 pm to see how long the wait was and a gentleman advised it was an hour to an hour and a half. I called again around 7:15 pm and the wait was down to around 45 minutes. When I got to The Spotted Pig and gave the host my name I was told to expect to wait for 45 minutes. My girlfriend and I were seated within 20 minutes. I think we got lucky. The service was very friendly. I am not sure if I like the decor of ceramic and other pig items or not, but I do love how casual and unpretentious The Spotted Pig is. I agree with other yelpers that the tables are packed pretty tight and the low stools do not help out my bad back much.The Spotted Pig Bitter Ale was real ale pulled and served at cellar temperature. The Deviled Eggs had a great taste and texture. The flavors were perfectly balanced in the Seared Squid with Cilantro Butter & Fennel. This is one of the best squid dishes I've had in a while.When asked for a personal recommendation our waitress boasted that the Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestrings was one of the best burgers in The City. The meat in the burger was packed very lightly, which allowed for maximum moisture in it. Tossing the shoestring fries with fresh rosemary put The Spotted Pig's fries on my 'best fries' radar.   I am not sure if the burger is one of the best in the city but it was pretty damn good.Crispy Pork Belly with Bean Purée also came with swiss (maybe rainbow?) chard. The pork belly was perfectly seasoned and I barely needed a knife to cut in it to it. Summer Pudding with Creme Fraiche was the first time I've seen a cold pudding served in the United States and did not disappoint. I think the pudding was even made in a proper pudding basin. I would advise against ordering this dish unless you really love tart summer berries. I enjoyed it very much. Probably the best part of the meal was my coffee that was served in a French press.

After an additional 30 minutes of waiting we were seated. I complained to the host who said they had large parties. You think he could have offered up one round of beers on the house. While the burger was good is wasn't great and NOT worth a 1.5 hour wait.

It's on par with the best burgers of San Francisco, think NOPA, Chez Maman, and Zuni.

What would you say if I told you there was a way to pay $43 (before tip) for a beer, a bowl of soup and a hamburger? Crazy, no? Here was my lunchtime order:1 seafood chowder = $151 Burger = $171 Old Speckled Hen = $8Now, the median price for an Old Speckled Hen at NYC bars is $6.75, according to BeerMenus.com (an amazing resource). Of course, they've got the Pig's draft OSH incorrectly listed as $7. But that it were so! No, your draft beer here is $8, which is the price of a full lunch special at many other places in the city. Beer is a commodity, so pricing it very high pisses me off. Now to the food. They can charge $15 for their chowder I guess. I paid that, after all, but it's still an absurd price for a soup. However, the soup is amazingly delicious and quite filling. The burger is another story. It is coated in blue cheese. This cheese has evidently been sitting at the bottom of the salty ocean for years...YEARS...gathering the courage to make you wretch. I had to scrape it off in order to taste the meat at all.

Decently priced and delicious food at a hip location with great atmosphere? Yeah, I totally get the award for best host.She had the burger and I had the gnudi. The gnudi is magically delicious and salty. They're basically ricotta surrounded by dough with a brown butter sauce and fried bay leaves. The first bite was an orgasm in my mouth. Maybe a little too intense, because after the third one, the saltiness was overpowering. To extend my analogy, it's like getting stretched every which way with satisfying results, but after a while, you just need a break.The burger was a homer, as always. Juicy and flavorful. The roquefort cheese adds a nice zing, though I have a love/hate relationship with blue cheese on my burgers. Nice, yes, but sometimes, all you can taste is the blue cheese. I love the fries here, which are skinny. I grab a big clump, making sure to get some of the fried rosemary and garlic slices, and stuff 'em in my mouth. The first time I came here, I came alone. The gentleman next to me ordered a burger, which was what I planned on getting. I ordered it, and made a vow to eat slightly less than he did. I did. I finished my burger, and only ate half my fries (he ate three quarters of them), but man, was it tough.The cubano here is also excellent. I hate crowds, and they have a late lunch menu.

To our pleasant surprise, there was none (thanks to the mad rain!).  From the get-go, it seemed everything was going to be just perfect. The service was warm and welcoming, the decor, what's not to love?  It was all about fine comfort. The first floor (where we ate) was furnished with a balance of traditional hybrid booths and not so traditional stool seating.  The adorable Old English, plaid decor and quirky pig accents were definite crowd pleasers.  But then came the purpose of the visit, the food.  Unfortunately, it was a hit or miss:-Deviled Egg- overpowering vinegar taste, love it or hate it.-Liver-not my thang but seemed good for my friend.-Spinach Frittata- thumbs up for the balance of cheese and spinach and the generous portion.-French Toast- felt more like dessert since there was too much syrup (not a fan).-Salad- Bleep?? Forgot the name of the salad, but the greens were so sparse compared to the dressing/filling.  I don't recommend it as a meal unless you eat like Kate Moss.-Chargrilled burger with shoestring fries- delicious (also if you don't mind gorgonzola type of cheese) and huge, probably the most bang for your buck.  Even though I loved the charm of the place, the service and my burger, I am not sure if I'm sold on Spotted Pig's 'fine comfort' food.

2056,YdSTibrfNY3_vbf_GNhKhg,Sean W.,4.0 star rating,"Heard this was a great place for a brew and a burger, so me and a few buddies decided to hit up the place. Its a very small British pub type of environment with low lighting, so it gets very crowded and cramped to seat in. Also, you can't make reservations which sucks if it gets too packed and you have to wait for an hour, especially on an empty stomach.But, its nice to kill time at the bar and try out some of their nice selections of beer. Their signature drinks are probably the cask beers, but note that these are served relatively warm, which may be unusual for beer drinks like myself. The Spotted Pig Ale was pretty good, but the other Cask option, the Six Point IPA, tasted like dirt. After getting seated, we decided to order the bar snacks as appetizers, such as the Chicken Liver Toast and Deviled Egg. The Chicken Liver Toast was very good and provided a good amount of chicken liver on each slice. The Deviled Egg was very average, although I personally like it since I'm an egg lover, the rest of the table found it mediocre and nothing special. We also ordered the sheep's milk ricotta gnudi, which was pretty damn good as well, and was incredibly cheesy and flavorful, making it a highly recommended starter as well. Finally, the entire table ordered the Spotted Pig's Signature Roquefort Goat Cheese burger with Shoestring fries. As a fan of goat cheese, I definitely loved the burger, however it was a bit overwhelming on the burger which make it really salty. The burger itself was pretty juicy, although i should have ordered it medium instead of medium rare since it was more bloody than medium rare should be, so lesson learned. If ketchup is needed on a burger, its never a good sign. However, the fried was the redeeming part of the dish, and they give you a lot of fries with each order, and the fries was pretty good on its own without any ketchup or salt. Overall, it was a quite a good experience, and I would recommend trying it out once if you want a unique beer and burger experience. 4 out of 5!",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I would say it almost ruined the burger.  I found myself trying to eat around the places that had the most cheese.  No toppings for the burger, either. I asked for a side of tomato and lettuce and was told they couldn't do that.  Seriously???  Am I expecting too much to want a slice of tomato??  And the fries...oh the fries.  They were disgusting.  I ate about half of them because I was hungry, but was annoyed with each bite.  They really need new fries.  Or at least give us a choice: would you like normal french fries, or nasty shoe string fries that are so thin that you can see through them?Overall, I'm glad I tried this place.  I wish it lived up to the high expectations that I had set for it.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

The tongue was cooked in such a way that you could scarcely tell that it was tongue.  It tasted like a marbled steak: had melt-in-your-mouth feel and tasted very beefy (yeah, that's not a real word but work with me here) and a brightness thanks to the condiments.  Again, you can taste the spring flavors.Shoestring fries... good (but not the best fries I've had).  Wished that the rosemary and salt was more evenly distributed but we seriously could not stop pecking at this dish.  The service was good, timely, friendly... no problems.  I have to say, hats off to April Bloomfield.  You may not be a spider... but you definitely know ""some pig!""",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

2082,wnqWt78SOXauqojXV1sjAw,Brad P.,4.0 star rating,"The GF and I finally decided to check out this most ballyhooed of gastropubs on a random Sunday.  We predicted a lengthy wait, but when the gentleman at the door told us it would be an hour and change for a table, I unsuccessfully tried to audible to Fatty Crab down the street.  I lost.We entered the bar area, where I was emasculated each time I tried to get the bartender's attention or body checked by other patrons.  The ladyfriend didn't seem to mind, but that's probably because she's gotten used to my bar anxiety, mostly the result of my persistent inability to find a place to stand that is not blocking foot traffic.  Once the bartender was done playing hard to get, I ordered the cask drawn Otis Stout from the bar, which was lovely and maybe even worth the nine dollars it cost.  Halfway through the drink, however, and after waiting for only twenty or so minutes, we were informed that our table was ready.  O RLY?  A pleasant surprise, but why was our wait time so over quoted?We waffled over a couple items on the menu, but ultimately settled for the house classics. We shared the brown-butter-and-sage-bathed ricotta gnudi, which I believe our waitperson informed us to be a flourless dumpling.  Essentially they're tasty little cheese and butter explosions in your mouth, and every bit the sexual experience the description suggests.  Unlike several others below, I really enjoyed my roqeufort burger -- surprising since I have avoided the blue cheese and beef combination for many years.  I agree that the cheese stands out but, given that the burger consists of only three parts (beef, cheese, bun), it can't really be said to overpower as much as share equal time with the other ingredients.  The little shoestring fries were also delicious, but completely dependent on the bits of fried garlic and rosemary accompanying them.  GF went for the braised rabbit that she seemed to enjoy.  I tasted it at some point, but was too distracted by my dish to appreciate it.  I think she was jealous of my fries.All in all, it was what I expected -- a packed, overpriced, but ultimately quality restaurant.  I would give three and a half stars, and would maybe go back with someone from out of town.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

The decor is odd to say the least - randomly placed ceramic spotted pigs, but somehow it works.  I came back to sample their lunch under the persuasion of one of my friends..From the appetizers I tried the chicken liver toasts, deviled eggs and ""roll mops"" (pickled herring).  The roll mops were the great!  I wouldn't have thought so, but it wasn't fishy nor slimy at all.  Very flavorful and refreshing.  The deviled eggs were just ok.  The chicken liver toasts were excellent - but it's definitely a heart attack on a plate.  One bite should be enough.I got the famous Spotted Pig burger and was royally disappointed.  It looks grand and portion is enormous, but it was just a facade. I asked for it medium, but I think it was like rare.  Not even rare. It was still like ground meat straight from the butcher.  Don't people usually order on the rare side b/c they want those juices following between the bun?  Not this, it was just bright pink ground meat with no flavor and not that much juice.  There's a heavy load of roquefort cheese on the thick burger that made it WAY too salty.  The cheese just sort of got in the way.  The fries are the extra skinny kind - like potato match sticks with rosemary and too much salt.  I'm a steak fries - tater tots - curly fries kind of girl so these extra skinny fries didn't interest me much.  You have to stick a whole fistful in your mouth to get any sort of substance.  Not very ladylike.I only had like 3 bites of the burger and 7 potato sticks and I decided I was no longer interested.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

It's rare to find a seat but I ended up going on one of the coldest nights of the year and was therefore seated upon arrival (I'd been there before and the wait was 3 hours... which is why this is my first review!). Definitely order one of their exclusive beers. Have a few drinks, take in the scene, schmooze, then go for dinner somewhere else - there are tons of cute bistros in the area.The burger is definitely worth trying IF YOU LIKE gorgonzola. Otherwise, either ask for the burger without cheese (it's perfectly seasoned and performs well on its own!) or order the gnuti instead.Keep in mind that my bill - after one burger and two beers - came to around $40.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

The entire time we were there the kitchen staff was running up and down the steps, loudly. Stomping I should say. In a huge hurry, frantic. Ordered some burgers, a med and two wells. The food took forever. The waitress said it was because we ordered well done burgers. Well duh... But a well done burger doesn't take 35 minutes to cook. The med burger was raw and had to be sent back. In which case they just half ass reheated and returned my same burger to me. The fries were okay, although the sliced fried garlic chips in them were delicious. Im not a huge fan of rosemary and was a little disappointed to see the pile of fries covered in it. $55 for three burgers.I'm not sure if the calm before the storm of dinner service had everyone there in a shit mood, but the staff all seemed miserable.

They started seating around 5:30 and my group of three had a table by 5:45, leaving enough time to enjoy a Spotted Pig bitter on cask at the bar.Food and service were good, but I think 3 stars is the right rating here since I'm not convinced the food should command such high prices.The caesar salad was quite good, and made correctly with thick eggy dressing and anchovies throughout - not remotely a healthy ordering option, but tasty. Prosciutto fritters, the appetizer special for the day, were tasty also - then again, it is hard to go wrong with deep fried balls of spinach, prosciutto, and cheese.But on to our primary objective. The burger was well-sized and the meat was quite good - I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked as such. It wasn't outstanding meat, though, just a very competently executed burger. Roquefort cheese on top adds a somewhat unique quality to it, but I've had blue cheese burgers elsewhere for half the price that I enjoyed just as much. Bummer! The search for the best burger continues.As other reviewers say, though, the place has a novel atmosphere and the fries were good, so I wasn't terribly disappointed with it, I'd go back but I'd take a Corner Bistro burger (or a Mr. Bartley's burger back in Boston!) over another SP burger if I'm looking to maximize my intake of beefy goodness.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

My frittata was a good size and the homefries were fine, but the burger came with a Mount Everest side of shoestrings. Literally, the fries were piled five inches or so up on the plate. I told the waiter he was not kidding when he warned me. My frittata was extrememly tasty and the home fries were very different in a positive light. They were cooked in a reduction type of sauce or glaze. Worth $7? Probably, but I do wish I had listened to the waiter because we had way too much food. Nikki said the burger was good, but Roquefort cheese is very salty and she had slight meal regret and wishes she had tried another brunch item. Next time, of course, because we both enjoyed our time at The Pig and look forward to another meal there. I did not opt for dessert, as we were sure we would see something while walking through the Village. There are quite a few brunch items. Eggs cooked a variety of ways, cornbeef hash, oysters, duck egg, French toast and a grilled cheese are a few. In addition to the deviled eggs, you can order chicken liver toast, a pot of pickes and a few other appetizers. The prices are mid-range. The burger was $17 and the frittata was $15, not including the $7 homefries. The Spotted Pig is well known and you may have a wait if you arrive during prime time, especially during dinner. It is worth the wait though and you can give you name and cell number and the hosts will call you when a table is ready. Tour the West Village while you wait. They have maps! Another plus about the Village is you might run into a familiar face while you are walking around.

I had no idea this place's burger was its claim to fame. Quite overpriced if you ask me. However, they transcend typical fast food into gourmet food. Hipster waitresses in yarnmade hair nets take your order. I still have no idea what 'roll mops' are.

Ordered:-Cubano w/ mixed salad ($17) - pork shoulder, prosciutto, better than Margon's but crazy expensive, not worth it-Chargrilled burger w/ roquefort cheese & shoestrings ($17) - the cheese here is what makes this burger SING, really good quality cheese, our burger was tender to the touch, almost too tender for my liking, definitely high quailty, bun was oversized and puffy, the fries were homemade, super thin strands, heaping mound shoestring fries w/ onions and rosemary leaves, big enough portion for the entire tableTotal came out to $21/pp after everythingPics: meetup.com/teamfoodie/ph…",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

This is a loud, brash, riotous fantasy island for the lover of all things meaty and true. Just penning this review is calling up memories of rich, fatty, raw goodness. Excuse me, I need a moment......Okay. The first thing you should know is that this NO PLACE for a vegetarian. Yes, they have a fish dish on the menu, but the only true vegetable dishes are the sides, which are mostly potatoes (you can order a ""meal"" of 4 side dishes). I'm sorry for people to feel left out, but such is life. This is a meaty place. Embrace it.We started out with the pork rillettes. They were served cold with a glistening layer of fat on top and they came with hefty slabs of grilled bread, cornichons, and mustard. They were so fabulously good - the fat alone was good enough to eat by itself. The mustard cut the richness perfectly.For our entrees we had the skirt steak and the hamburger. The steak is only served medium rare. It glistens and is so flavorful that you want to get up out of your chair (I'm sorry, rickety little stool) and do a happy dance.I have no recollection whatsoever as to of what the skirt steak was served with because it was totally, utterly irrelevant. The hamburger was brought out on a plate heaped 100 miles high with shoestring fries (see photo above). They were really salty (in a good way) and had been tossed with crispy rosemary leaves, an ideal companion for the salt. It was perfectly pink from top to bottom and so tender and warm that it felt a little (indecently) like eating a live animal might. The flavor was a mild, addictive, almost olive-oily beef taste. No pushy seasonings, just the highest quality, perfectly cooked ground beef. The blue cheese was all the adornment needed.Now high on protein, we were somehow persuaded by our server to try a dessert called the ""Banoffe"" - a sort of layered puff pastry dish with sliced bananas, Dulce de Leche, and cream.

When we sent it back they brought out the SAME burger, which they had returned to the grill even though it was cut in half. Of course it was gray and disgusting on the outside. Asked for the manager after waiter told use that Spotted Pig had a Michelin star so ""I think we know how to cook a burger."" He also muttered ""It's not my fault I just bring out the food."" When the manager came over -- he and the waiter were lame hipster friends -- he told us if we didn't like it we could leave.

Did I mention we were surrounded by tourists, like really tourists, from the Midwest, carrying things like bags from Dylan's Candybar?

When we came back new arrivals were reporting a 90 minute way around 7!The front of house was kind enough to remember my face and let me know that there were a few tables finishing up their meal and that they have received their tabs. A nice plus. We were seated in probably one of the SMALLEST tables I've dined at but no bother, I cam for the food.An order of the chicken liver toast, burger, and roasted pork belly and we're on our way.Chicken Liver Toast: It was like a very greasy pate. Surprisingly reminded me of some asian flavors, the toast was nice and crunchy, very accommodating to the chicken liver. Flavor was strong, and stays in your mouth, I couldn't imagine eating more then 1/2 the toast which was just enough for my appetite.Roasted Pork Belly: The bean puree served with this dish was DELICIOUS. The roasted pork belly was cooked fantastically as the skin was crispy, and the meat (what there was of it) and fat was a mouthful of flavors. Almost a bit too much flavor, and I kind of felt guilty as I was mostly consuming some flavorsome fat and skin with a side of meat. Despite the flavors and cooking, I figured I could get comparable and cheaper pork from a chinese BBQ joint taken home to eat.Hamburger: The meat was tender and cooked prefectly. The gruyere was very flavorful reminiscent of a bleu cheese. The fries, were more like potatoe chips and nice to snack on. I would've preferred more potatoes in the fries but it was decent.Overall a nice experience, I don't know if it was worth the money that I spent but if you're looking for peppier brittish pub food, give the spotted pig a try.-Ed",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I've always hated liver for its texture and taste, but this gave me a new perspective entirely. Though it looks unappetizing (brown, kind of looks like wet dog food), its taste is phenomenal. We were both shocked at how good it was. We also ordered 2 mugs of the mulled wine after we figured out what was being ladled out by the hipster bartender, which is probably my favorite winter drink of all time now. The burger, which was the original reason we went, was good but I'm not a fan of Roquefort cheese. It seemed overpowering, even for my friend who liked cheese. The meat itself, pretzel bun, and shoestring fries were great though. The overall decor of the pub is eclectic, with a definite West Villagey feel to it.

2151,XMogNiQ8lYXXVNTdTLSzqw,Venu N.,3.0 star rating,"3.25 stars.  There are those who will say that this is the best burger in New York City.  And they very well may be right.  It's a decent burger, and quite frankly, I haven't tried too many burgers in this city.  Having said that, from a burger perspective, this place doesn't hold a candle to the great burger spots of Texas (I've even had a better burger in DC), and I'll tell you why.First, the quality of the meat left something to be desired.  For example, a truly awesome burger may feature meat that is aged in-house (Ray's Hell Burger in Washington DC), grass-fed (Hut's Hamburgers in Austin TX), or simply USDA prime (Beck's Prime in Houston TX).  The burger at Spotted Pig is none of these.Second, often there would be at least some variety left to the consumer in order to make their burger.  Very few places can get away with singular options (Arnolds Burger in Amarillo TX quickly comes to mind as an exception).  I like a place that doesn't just give me fancy Roquefort cheese burger as my singular option.Third, the actual burger provided at Spotted Pig, while tasty, went overboard on the Roquefort cheese.   The pungent bitterness may have meshed better with the burger if it was balanced with chantrelles, but this was simply not an option given to the consumer.  It was basically good (but not great) quality meat with good cheese.  Okay, I know that might come off as overly harsh, and it doesn't change the FACT that the burger at Spotted Pig is very good.  I just think that it might be hyperbole to call it the best in the city, and if it is, I would suggest that NYC is not the destination for burgers in the first place.What Spotted Pig DOES do especially well is eggs.  We had the deviled eggs appetizer, and we were delighted by their consistenty, taste, and balance of flavors.  I saw some tantalizing eggs delivered with another plate and instantly wished that I had ordered something outside of the burger.  I also ate a Cubano sandwich which was tasty, but I would have liked a bit more balance between the prosciutto (substituted for the traditional ham) and the pulled pork (which was a bit overpowering).  The tiny pickles meshed well with that particular order.Also, I want to give props to the atmosphere at Spotted Pig.  This place is genuinely awesome.   From the spotted pig with rainbow colored boots adorning the front of the restaurant to the restaurant layout to the staff, this place exudes a level of awesomeness that cannot be fully explained.  In short, this is a nice spot to check out, but I simply wouldn't call it a destination spot for burgers.  Try out some of their other cuisine (and definitely try some of their more brunch-friendly items), and you will leave this place happy.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

No more Aquavit, Le Bernardin or any of the other fine dining establishments.Last night I had a friend from the restaurant industry visit me and he wanted to try a high quality restaurant without spending his life savings. I heard of the spotted pig as being a great restaurant/bar with moderate pricing and have always wanted to dine here. Very unassuming at first glance we passed by the spotted pig which looked like a neighborhood bar in a picturesque NYC neighborhood. The decor inside was ""rugged"" , yet reminiscent of an Abercrombie and Fitch store (if that makes any sense). We opted to sit at the bar and the bartenders were professional courteous and friendly.The bartender handed us a menu of the day on a piece of paper. They have a ""tapas"" section although they called it something else. Being two big guys we decided to try everything on the tapas menu. The most memorable ones were the deviled eggs, bacon wrapped figs and OMG the chicken liver on country toast was so unbelievable my mouth is watering just writing about it. We actually ended up ordering another order of this it was that good. Imagine sweet caramelized onions, perfectly cooked chicken liver, melt in your mouth, perfectly toasted bread, i don't know how else to describe it. Following that we looked at the ""appetizers"" the bartender recommended something that sounded like gnocchi but was something else with sheep cheese bechamel and veal stock i think. Honestly I would pass on that, it wasn't anything worth remembering. We also ordered an Apple salad, which was two variations of apple i think figi and golden delicious, dressing that tasted like plum vinaigrette, arugula for spice, and pieces of a sharp white cheese. This marriage of flavors danced on our palate for a while we loved it. Main course we opted for the Burger (I didn't want it but my friend insisted on it since we saw a few interesting plates come out) and the Skirt steak, Both medium rare. As the meal arrived my friend wanted to try the steak first and his expression can only be described in a picture. He hit the table with his hand and said ""wow"" ""forget the burger, try this steak"". Seeing his enthusiasm I tried the steak and it was one of the best steaks I have ever tasted in my life. The texture was a nice char grilled crisp on the outside and tender like butter on the inside, smoked herb flavors from the grill infused the meat and were noticeable but not overpowering. Charred sweet beats were served on the side and overall one of the best entrees I have had in my life. 10/10 The burger, nice flavor liked the blue cheese touch ... but overall there are better places to get a burger in nyc. To conclude if you do visit this gem make sure you try the chicken liver toast, the apple salad, and the steak. Amazing.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

2162,Xj5dZEt2epbBlbWNVLbDLg,Dirk R.,5.0 star rating,"On a week-long food trip earlier this year, we hit the Spotted Pig for a long leisurely lunch. We had heard horror stories about how busy it can be at night, and so we opted to preempt the long wait by lunching there instead. (A tactic we employ quite often for the better restaurants -- lunch is always easier, and somehow, more decadent too).And so lunch it was. We walked into a half empty restaurant, and were seated right away upstairs. The waitstaff was pleasant, knowledgeable, and attentive.Even with our high hopes, we were most pleasantly surprised. Much like its London brethren St. John's restaurant, the Spotted Pig revels in the extraordinary. A sensational menu, packed with many traditional items, most of which you will never find in a restaurant these days. Definitely worth all the hoopla.I had the chicken liver on toast to start, and then for the main course, faggots. Yep, faggots. A traditional sausage-like dish from the Midlands (in England). I remember having them a few times as a kid when we lived near Worcester (again, England), but the faggots at the Spotted Pig were better than anything I remember. Aside from their unusual name (particularly to American ears), this is one of best dishes you can choose, when prepared well. Mine were superb. Essentially a home-made sausage of pig cheeks and pig liver, wrapped in some sort of natural sausage casing, seared, and served in a shallow bed of au jus and topped with mustard and crispy pig ears. I know, I know -- perhaps not your normal run-of-the-mill item, but let me tell you, the dish was fantastic.My fellow eaters had equally excellent meals for their lunch, but I cannot honestly remember what they were except A) pig-based, and B) scrumptious. All of this topped with some hearty British ales, and we were as happy as three pigs in a blanket.I can't wait to go there again, to try out the rest of the menu.

I have been in the food industry for over 10 years and would probably have gotten fired if I ever said this to a table.  We were outraged that he told us we would be able to order more in the beginning....and more food equals more money for him.... and then tells us that he wasnt sure because another table may be waiting (which is what a ""wait"" is for).  He came back with an attitude but, yeah for us- we could order more food.  20 minutes later.....no food....no server.... the manager comes over and asks us what we would like to order.  We told her the story of what happened and said we already ordered.  Eventually the food came out along with our server who changed his clothes and wouldnt even come over to us.  The manager did a great job resolving the problem, however the server whom refered to us as ""bros"" and ""dudes"" needs a brush up on how to treats his tables.The food was out of this world however the service left a bad taste in my mouth.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

2180,ZfSmGtdkK9wGaUpHmYw4AQ,Alexis M.,4.0 star rating,"There are not a few restaurants in this city that I haven't tried, merely due to worry that the experience could never live up to the hype. And I hate crowds.I also tend to be nervous about these ""no reservations"" places (I am sick of this trend, BTW), envisioning 2hr+ waits and snooty hostesses. So we went at 5:30 on a Friday, were coldly greeted by Devendra Banhart at the door, and promptly seated in a cozy, dark corner room on the 2nd floor next to a C-list celebrity and his date. So far, everything was meeting my expectations.We started with the ""Devils on Horseback"" and and chicken liver toast; the former as delicious as almost anything (but especially prunes) wrapped in bacon would be, the latter onsisting of crispy, thick slices of rustic toast slathered with gobs of Madeira-laced liver pate. Next was a half dozen oysters (appropriately evocative of the ocean), and the ricotta gnudi (good, but what's the hype?). Now, I had heard (and eaten plenty) of calf's tongue, but beef tongue? I was prepared for it to be gamey, gristley, so you can imagine my delight when presented with two neat slices of delicately flavored, tender meat, napped with creme fraiche and pickled beet slices. This is definitely the chef to trust when delving into the eating of scary bits.And this burger everyone is raving about? Wow. It was as lovely as everyone says: juicy, rare, smothered in Roquefort and nestled next to a tangle of rosemary-scented shoestring fries. A few bones to pick: they had run out of the house bitter, which seems like a serious lack of foresight for 5:30 on a Friday night. Secondly, it struck how much snootier the staff was than the celebrities surrounding me at this place? What gives? The waitress almost refused to give us recommendations, saying that people's tastes differ. Um, really? No way! She eventually warmed up, but it put a damper on the first third of our evening for sure.

2185,t86e0hrG0x273EQCzjqs_Q,Victoria G.,3.0 star rating,"I mean, it's been on my must-go list FOREVER and let's be honest, everything that could possibly be said about this place has been so I won't waste your time (or mine).In short, I came (starving) at the perfect time--12am on a Thursday and was able to sit right away. They recommend coming before 8 or after 10 to escape the harrowing crowds that take up the corner of 11th and gren; immediate props for the homey feel of the place, checkered tablecloths and all.I highly recommend the 75 south--it is honestly the perfect summer cocktail with bombay gin, lemon, cava and the magic maker: rhubarb shrub...yep, you try explaining to me what the hell that is--no matter, it goes down like juice and at 12 bucks a pop it's easy to wrack up a hefty bar tab before taking a bite of anything. While I so appreciate the kitchen being open until 2am, things inevitably run out and I was EXTREMELY irked when the burgers ran out as I was in the process of ordering one--something our waitress, though very helpful up until that point could've pointed out as we'd taken our sweet time to order. Grrrrrrrr. Alas, I'll have o go back, and that's honestly alright by me as I still need to taste what is perhaps the biggest Bloomfield draw to this place.The food we did manage to score though hit mostly high notes. The chicken liver on toast was truly fabulous--no it's not incredibly unique especially at gastropubs such as this one where upscale bar food is the main event, but this one rivaled pulino's (the best in my book to date) and was the perfect starter. Also in the small plate realm were the famed devils on horseback (I was truly excited about these babies) and the beets and greens. While the former was delicious (i mean, it's bacon), i was a bit disappointed as they were practically swimming in their own fat...it's not quite sexy to have to shake off the excess oil from these tiny meat lollies. The beets were good, nothing to write home about but it was nice that they came warm as opposed to most beet preparations.To continue, the gnudi, sharing the must-have title with AB's roquefort burger, were divine...and probably one of the richest plates of anything Ive had in years, or maybe, ever. The brown butter, while more-ish was a bit overwhelming. The portion is right for sharing as I don't know if one could (or should) consume every single on of these large pillows of ricotta. Mmmmm. Don't get me wrong, it's utterly sinful (especially when you dip the crunchy bread into the sauce--seriously try this) and worth a try, but lord I think I can still feel this in my stomach (thighs, butt...) days later. We opted for the octopus as well which had a great char to it and was perfectly cooked. It's not as memorable as 'inoteca's version but it was a nice balance to the rich pasta. Lastly, the market greens was a blah side, but a necessary dose of veg among everything else on the table. Don't try to ask for any changes or additions or substitutions though (aka, ""may i please have tomato on the salad?"" ""No."" ""Um, ok."") because you won't get em.All in all, it's definitely a gem and a great people-watching spot and I really do need to go back for that damn burger. But the ridiculously inflated prices, lack of subs, and overall 'we can get away with everything bc we're in ny feel' while fun if you buy into that for a night, has its moments. ...I would love another one of those 75 souths tho...or like 12.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

We wanted to order some almonds to snack on for a bit with drinks while we figured out what we wanted to eat. They wouldn't let us do it! Waitress's excuse was the chef likes everything coming in at once...well I know the chef wouldn't be roasting the almonds.

The pork belly had this mouth watering hard crust that tasted unlike any pork dish I've ever had. The greens were super flavorful as well. If I could get the recipe for these greens, I would make them everyday. You should come on a day when you have time to spare cause it's usually an hour wait minimum and you can't make rsvp's ahead of time.

And that certainly doesn't mean that you'll be getting your typical cheeseburger. This isn't classic pub food. Its a modern, expensive, and a little more... fancy version of it. Don't be surprised when you get blue cheese on your burger, try to have an open mind towards some well-done experimentation.The fritters were perfection.The oysters were fresh, cold, and came with a great tangy dip sauce.The artichoke salad was light with an incredibly flavorful dressing.I ordered the burger and it was cooked a perfect medium rare.although my recommendation would definitely be the lamb-chops. They are tender and juicy, and come with an incredible fried potato that defies explanation and two intensely flavored pork sausages.By far my best eating experience thus far in NYC.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I do remember some major disappointments, though:- the food was too salty.  all of it.  not in a, this-is-tasty-at-the-moment-but-I'll-be-thirsty-later sort of way, but just unpleasantly salty.  - the food was over-priced.  all of it. as a stand-out example, a side of pickles was $6 (in my memory -- it might even have been $7).  it consisted of a few wan carrot sticks along with some other items, doused in salt and vinegar (and again, not in a good way).  - the space was way too crowded.  If you're paying $6 to eat pickles (and a lot more to actually eat your meal), it would be nice if inebriated people from the bar would not be practically falling over your table.I had a nice dinner but that was entirely a function of the company I was with, and almost nothing to do with the restaurant itself.  Based on my experience there, I have to wonder whether part of the positive reception of this restaurant is just response to hype.  There was recently an economics study performed where they demonstrated that people actually enjoy a bottle of wine more if it's priced higher than if the same bottle of wine is priced lower -- maybe that 'wishful thinking' effect is in operation here?",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

It was delicious -- flavorful and juicy and the cheese was all you needed (and I like to pile on the onions, bbq sauce, bacon the works!).  I thought the shoestring fries were annoying -- they're too thin! How can you eat them? Frustrating.I came here for a midweek early dinner with my friend so there wasn't a wait, as the second floor was nearly empty.  Still the hostess, who looked completely lost and not that happy to have to be seating us, put us at a table that was flush up against another person -- because these are backless stools, one of us pretty literally would have been butt-rubbing up against another patron, and the other one would be hanging out in the crossway. There were *three* open tables nearby that would have given us our own space and we asked for one of those, and the hostess obliged so we thought that was fine. HOWEVER I don't know if they were having some sort of holiday party upstairs or something but the table we ended up getting was right where at least a dozen people were constantly passing through which was hugely distracting, and the bathroom was on the other side where the hand dryer was so loud we could hear it through the door. They also would dump the dirty dishes into a tub or something also right by us that crashed very loudly when they did. I don't usually nitpick about this kind of stuff and am a pretty gracious reviewer, but I was really unhappy about not being able to concentrate on my friend, especially since she was treating me to dinner for my birthday. At times what I think were staff were just hanging out around us doing nothing which also was distracting and didn't make for a nice dining experience. Basically I think the least that a restaurant can do is having gracious waitstaff that treat you well and some people who worked here (the hostess, the people hanging around) didn't seem to give a damn.  I will say, however, that our waiter was very sweet, and a woman said happy birthday to me as I left.  Maybe all of this would have been less noticeable had we not come at a relatively calm hour (I think we ate around 5pm), but I was really disappointed.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

2220,6jAIE5RyvD8PC6FikdjxKQ,Jesh D.,5.0 star rating,"the spotted pig always reminds me of the first time i hooked up with this one particular girl. she was unassuming, not too done up, and quite frankly, i wasn't expecting much. despite my low expectations, i had my mind blown. whatever she did, she did so well and left me speechless. it was like nothing i've experienced before. this burger is exactly that...something you've never experienced before and it'll leave you fantasizing about it.now before we get into the depraved details of the burger, let's talk about this place for a bit. everyone and their mother has heard about the spotted pig. it's an icon in the west village and one of those 'hipster' (absolutely hate that word) meccas. call it what you want...fame/infamy...doesn't matter. what matters is that this place can back up all the hype with just one bite of that perfectly crafted hefty piece of meat between two grilled brioche-esque buns. on to the burger...the pièce de résistance. april bloomfield is seriously a magician. april, if you ever read this and you're feeling lonely in life, give me a call and i'll be there for you at a moment's notice. i kinda fucking love you. now don't get me wrong...chef bloomfield isn't just about the burger. you can pretty much order anything on the menu knowing with full confidence that you'll be happy and staring at an empty plate. but do yourself a favor and make sure you're getting the burger (and the chicken liver toast. and the deviled eggs. i will NEVER walk out of those doors without having eaten all three of those things...it would just be rude). but i digress. when talking about burgers, there are usually two schools of thought: a thin patty thrown on a griddle that crisps up or a thick patty that's treated more like a steak. the spotted pig most definitely subscribes to the latter of the two philosophies. this thing weighs in at an impressive half pound and when it arrives on the table, it stares you down like mike tyson ready to knock you out. and trust me...it will. now this behemoth sits atop a brioche type of bun...it doesn't have the same sweetness that brioche usually comes with but it definitely boasts the same richness. and an added bonus? they bake their own buns. so we've got our bun, we've got our burger...we're on the right track. now...toppings? condiments? where do we go from here? when we think about the archetypal burger, we think lettuce, tomatoes, onions (gotta love onions), pickles (if you don't like pickles, you're a fool), ketchup (i personally hate the stuff, but i'll concede that i'm somewhat of an outlier in that sense) and mustard. nope. the pig says screw that...we're focusing on one thing and one thing only. beef. now I usually love all of those traditional toppings and condiments (except ketchup. hate it so much that i had to say it twice), but while they definitely add to the overall experience of the burger, they distract us from the meat. but if you REALLY need ketchup and mustard...the pig actually makes their own (but they won't put it on your burger out of principal...you'll need to ask for it on the side) and i must admit...both of them are pretty damn good. even the ketchup. so no toppings? no condiments? not even cheese? oh wait there is cheese? phew. you scared me. wait...wtf is roquefort? how do you even pronounce that? can't i get american or cheddar or even swiss? no. don't be a fool. april veers from the traditional once again and tops her burger with this creamy and funky blue. a lot of people aren't fans of blue cheeses, but i urge you to give it a try...you won't look back. after all, everyone needs a bit of funk in their lives. there's something magical that happens when you pair a blue cheese with beef, and this roquefort is no exception. it's just one of those combinations that are a match made in heaven. don't question it. just shut up and eat it and let the umami take over your mouth. what about fries? there needs to be fries with a burger. this is true. but again, april has her own little twist and throws a heaping pile of shoestring fries with rosemary and garlic next to the burger. so that's your burger. three simple things, but done exceptionally well. bun+meat+cheese. this is one of those instances where the whole is greater than the simple sum of it's parts. this is synergy at it's finest, folks. now the spotted pig is definitely on the pricier side. the burger is just over $20 bucks  but honestly,you're paying for quality. unfortunately, they don't take reservations and the wait ends up being quite a while but you can grab a drink or five at the bar while you wait. and to be perfectly frank, the wait is part of the experience. if you're not ready to tackle the server carrying the burger to the table next to you, then you haven't waited long enough. but ride it out. it'll be worth it after that first bite. i promise.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

This place reminded me of a little pub in New Hampshire: warm, cozy and filled with laughter and gastric delight.My friend demanded that we have the pig's ears. Having southern roots you'd think I would have had pig's ears, but I hadn't. I was apprehensive, but willing to try the many items on the menu that sounded impressive.I asked our waitress what were her 4 favorite things on the menu, and thankfully she named delights we were eying: Pig's Ears Salad, Ricotta Gnudi Balls, Calf's Liver and Beef Tongue. Unbelievable.The gnudi balls and pig's ears arrived first. The salty, crispy ear strips tasted finer than bacon over arugula and field greens with a punchy vinaigrette dressing. The surprising balls were a delicate and savory experience with the right balance of salt and cheese. Now I'm not normally drawn to menu items that include such words as ""liver"" or ""tongue,"" but my apprehension vanished with my first bites. The tongue had a delightfully light steak flavor with the tenderness of the best rib eye. An absolute delight. The calf's liver was also tasty and tender, although it didn't pack the ambrosial flavor punch of the other items we selected. I would definitely return, and perhaps soon. But I should warn no one to go there having not eaten all day.

Potted plants abound outside with benches and a place to relax while waiting. The interior is a take on a country pub style, with plenty of kitsch and old-world charm. The waiters come in sneakers and t-shirts, and a sheet of brown construction paper covers each white table cloth.But the hostess and the waitstaff all know where they work, and treat a customer how you would expect. Not directly rude, but definitely aloof and uninterested. I overheard our waiter making fun of the patron at the next table for thinking a menu item was a sandwich.Speaking of sandwiches, a stop here is supposedly incomplete without a chargrilled burger with roquefort cheese ($17). It comes best medium-rare says the chef, and is served with a heaping mound of shoestring fries. I found the whole experience from start to finish extremely salty. The roquefort was definitely the most memorable part of the meal, the sheep's milk cheese definitely a good companion to a burger. Both the interesting bun and saltiness of everything got me deconstructing the burger to check out the interior. I tasted the meat on its own and it proved to be the source of the salt. The grilled on both sides bun was very well-prepared.I would have thought it were an accident had the shoestring fries and the other dish on the table not been so salty as well. The prosciutto & ricotta tart with marjoram ($18) was the more tasty of the two meals, with its ingredients standing out more from the salt than on the burger. The ricotta was especially delicious, but I feel like marjoram was used instead of oregano only to sound fancier.

Mind you, by this time I had already consumed some New York Pizza for an early lunch.. but I had to fit everything I wanted to eat into my 4 day vacation. Therefore I ordered the burger with Roquefort cheese. In short, it was an amazing culinary creation. It was one goddamn perfect burger. The ingredients consisted of only two things: Roquefort cheese and the beef patty...but they worked so damn well with each other. The salty , savory cheese added a great layer of flavor to the perfectly cooked, half-inch patty. And when I say it was perfectly cooked, it was goddamn perfect and they didn't even ask me how I wanted it cooked. They just knew that it should be cooked medium-rare/medium and there was no other way. The shoestring fries that came alongside the burger is also worth mentioning. Although I like thicker-cut fries, I didn't mind these.. especially since they were accented with rosemary and garlic chips. I'm drooling right, back in my home in SF thinking about that damn burger.

It's one of the few Michelin Guide restaurants that is not French-based cuisine, and it regularly makes most lists of (relatively) affordable must-have eats.We started off our lunch with deviled eggs and chicken liver toast. The deviled eggs had a vinegary(?) tang to it that isn't really to my preferences. The chicken liver was very yummy in my tummy. It was thickly spread on the toast, just the way that I like it. In fact - it was almost as thick as the toast - perfect!I had had had to order their infamous burger. It's right up there on the list with Minetta Tavern's Black Label and a long string of other ""to-do musts."" The buns are specially made for Spotted Pig, and the meat patties are a hidden secret. I very much enjoyed my burger patty - it was the perfect blend of tenderness and juiciness, all pink in the center the way that I like it. The burger comes fairly naked - sans lettuce, tomato, and every other addition that you might expect with the exception of some Roquefort cheese. Now, I'm a fan of most cheese. Really! I promise that I am! But when you take a bite with too much of the cheese, it has a sharp, salty punch to your taste buds. Too much of this kind of cheese makes me make a face when I eat it - and I mean a weirder face than normal. No me gusta. I split my burger with one of my friends and don't know if I could have finished a whole one with all of that cheese. The burger comes with a huge pile of shoestring fries, which were fab if you like to eat slowly. It's hard to grab a huge pile of them because they're so skinny. To be honest, about a half of the way through my half of the burger, I decided to make it up Cali style and stuck a small handful in the rest of my burger. So much better that way.Overall, Spotted Pig was decent, but not like... ohmigawd good. Considering the press and awards that Spotted Pig has, I was expecting my mind to have been blown clear across the country. I'd like to go back for dinner and try the gnudi that one of my friends completely raves about. (They don't offer it for lunch.)

2236,r-gQujrUARRFf4n10u43JA,Paul H.,1.0 star rating,"This was my first and last visit to The Spotted Pig.  I went yesterday for lunch.  My 3 friends arrived before me by about 15 minutes and even though they were allowed to put their name down, they were not 'considered' for a table until we all arrived.  Whatever that means.  Anyway, the hostess reasoned that because she told the table before us 1.5 hours for a wait and there was a table sitting open big enough for the 5 of us, our wait would only be 30 minutes.  Fuzzy logic aside, we were seated a bit before the full 30 minutes and were met by our server who explained that 2 items were sold out (it was only 1pm and there were only about 6 items on the menu).  He also explained that the burgers would take about an hour to cook.  I'm not sure on what planet it takes an hour to prepare a burger especially for a restaurant with a maximum of 20 small tables.So we all placed our order and had some beers (a decent beer and wine list, I'll give place that).  Then we waited, and waited and waited.  Finally all the burgers arrived.  Apparently, medium and medium rare temperatures equates to more or less raw and the hour it took to cook the burgers was not enough to make them hot or even warm.  Not good.  The taste of the burgers was a 5/10.  The cheese was overpowering and there was no lettuce, tomato, onion or anything to go on the burger.  Only one person at our table ordered something other than a burger- a salad.  It took even longer than the burgers to receive the salad which was unacceptable considering they had an hour to toss some greens together with goat cheese and dressing.Overall I'd say The Spotted Pig was overhyped and the service was poor.  You can find a better burger easily at hundreds of other restaurants throughout the city without an hour wait to be seated and an hour wait for your food.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I wasn't sure what to expect, although it was recommended to me by the manager of my favorite restaurant (one of the top 10 in the US). The atmosphere was amazing, it just has a great feeling to it.I got a Spotted Pig Bitter to start, and we had the Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi with Brown Butter & Sage, and we each had a Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestrings.. It was like levitation. I returned for lunch on a holiday weekend, and the wait was only 30 minutes (which is highly unusual during their 7-10 rush, which could take hours..but oh man, so worth it).

2240,Zs6g-8sXDKFeYd6JU0MTGA,Seth L.,4.0 star rating,"I've heard stories about people waiting outside for two hours, so my friend and I showed up at 5:15 on a Sunday evening. At that point there were already four couples ahead of us, and by the time our name was written in on the list, another two had shown up behind us. We were there early enough that there was still standing room at the bar, so we drank while we waited. The kitchen opened a little after 5:30 and we were seated at 5:50. By that time there was a somewhat constant stream of people coming in and putting there name on the list -- so showing up very early seemed to be the way to go. For drinks we stuck with the cocktails and thought they were top notch. For appetizers we split the dates stuffed with pears wrapped in bacon, deviled eggs and chicken liver toast. All were excellent, but the dates were incredible -- they just melted in my mouth and the sweet flavor with the hint of pear was amazing. For entrees we got the burger and pork belly. While both were good, compared to the appetizers they were kinda ordinary. Dessert was their homemade ice cream with popcorn -- nothing special -- and flourless chocolate cake -- not exactly unique, but exceptionally rich. Prices were very reasonable, even by NYC standards. Atmosphere: I found it to be cozy without being too loud. It helps that the bar area isn't too large -- most people waiting for a table either go outside or somewhere else. Final thought on wait time: We paid our bill and left around 7:50, and the table next to us which was seated at the same time left around 7:35. So if the first seating is around 5:45, and the second seating starts around 7:45, if you show up between 7:00 and 8:00 you're probably in for a very long wait. Final verdict: Because of the mythic wait times I had pretty high expectations which weren't quite met, but I'd go again. And next time, I'll probably order a bunch of appetizers and just split an entree.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

They were just too sweet!  I've had the liver before, and though this particular incarnation was just as addictive, it had that confusing: Am I a sweet or a savory? Something you don't EVER want to think with liver.  As for the roll mops, we had to smother them in the creme fraiche as the sweetness was cloying.Then the burger came, my second favorite only to the Gnudi.  All I can say is blech. The beef was dry, grainy, gray and tasteless-- I pinched out a piece and ate it all by it's cardboardy self.  The roquefort was overwhelming.  The shoestring fries, I am pleased to report, are just as good as ever with their crispy rosemary and garlic goodness scattered hither and yon. Mmmm.Thank god for them and for the Smoked Haddock Chowder (which I actually had not had before).   This potage had so many levels of bright, alive flavor it practically shone in comparison to the burger.  I could have used more broth in it..I know a chowder is supposed to be thick, but that broth was mmmm delish, I would have loved to slurp away.  Now here is what confuses me: why has The Pig, restaurant of my gastronomic dreams, failed to live up to all my previous visits (last of which, I'll admit, was about 6 months ago)?  I am now afraid to return for fear of being disappointed by what I remember as heavenly Gnudi.  What's worse is that Chef Bloomfield walked through the dining room: I know she was there and I know that THAT food came out of HER kitchen. One that SHE was actually running.  Is she tasting the food anymore?3 stars for a regular restaurant. 2 stars because it's The Pig and I hold it to a higher standard.  Meh, I've experienced better IN THE SAME PLACE.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

I went here on Friday night to meet up with an old high school friend.  Since I've been wanting to come here for a while, I thought this was a good opportunity. First of all, walking to this part of the city, far enough away from the subway stop, in the midst of tree-lined West Village blocks, feels fairy-tale-esque.  As my friend said, ""It's amazing what a walk in West Village can do.""  Anyway, on the corner of the seemingly elusive West 11th Street (if you're not from the area, it's difficult to find.  It's like the disappearing Harry Potter staircases in Hogwarts), you'll see a little black and white spotted pig hanging over the door.  This is it.  I walked in and sort of felt like I was in a hobbit's house - which is a good thing in my book.  Everyone was eating, drinking and merry-making like it was Bilbo's last night in the Shire.  Though the hostess said there was a 45 minute wait, I wasn't too upset about it because of the festive atmosphere, the beautiful weather, the bench outside and the potential to explore the neighborhood. Our seat was ready earlier than later.  Things were cramped but, again, it didn't negatively affect my experience.  We both ordered the burger with the shoestring fries and it was AWESOME.  My skinny friend who ""wasn't too hungry"" when we got there, finished her whole burger - as did I.  The fries were sooo good, mixed with fresh rosemary and mingled with roasted garlic.  The burger was one of the best I've had in a very long time.  They melt Roquefort cheese on it... mmmmm... I never had it before but I'm certainly glad that I did.  So yeah, the crowd was eclectic, the service was good and the food was excellent.

For an animal that serves no other practical purpose other than to feed us, this appetizer was sublime. Crispy with a thin layer of chewy cartilage in between was salty, crunchy, and fantastic foil to the endive and watercress salad upon which it rested. You really *can* make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.My entree? I got the burger with the Roquefort on the side. It was ... a burger. The shoestring fries were good, although I've had them in other restaurants back in SF. I probably would have ordered something else, or just kept it to the chicken liver toast and the crispy pig's ear we had ordered for appetizers. My dining companion got the house-made faggot and a side of snap peas with mint, both of which were fantastic. The faggots were pretty rich and super flavorful. They serve you three on a plate, which is more than enough. I will forgive some minor miscalculations in service for plates of deliciousness.

I have skimmed through the reviews below, and I do agree with most, but I am going to be the hard bastard yelper here and offer what I think is a better alternative for the price. However, I will first bore you with my review. You can always skip to the end for my alternative places to eat --- but you will miss the juicy bit!Had dinner at The Spotted Pig on Friday night, had no problems with needing to book. Arrived between 7:30 and 8pm, and was seated straight away; all be it the table was not the best.In terms of the 'venue', it's basically a bar that sells food.  The concept that it has followed from the UK seems to be intact, but with an American bias.  The UK concept is spruced up British pub that has kicked out the pissed locals smoking loads of fags crowing the bar, and replaced them with trendy people that want a somewhat more refined experience in the cosyness of a pub.  I should also say that the food at Gastro pubs is normally (and should be) local and organic and not fussed with; The Spotted Pig would appear to follow this formula.  For dinner we shared and shared.  To start we shared the pig's ear, yes pigs ear.  Now this starter was $14, which is a lot for a pig's ear, given that it is not a prime cut of meat, but you are paying for the thrill of trying pig's ear, or at least we were.  The pig's ear was cooked a la confit duck, and served with endive and tender rocket and a caper dressing.  The ear was actually quite nice, strong in flavor with the duck fat, but it was difficult to eat --- no good if you have any dodgy teeth!  Anyway it was fun (but not $14 worth --- an ear what, 5c, they give them to pets for free, right!)For main course we shared the burger with those fries and chard. All great.  Burger cooked as we asked, fries sport on and chard spot on --- all spot on and yummy. The cost for our simple meal with 2 beers and a couple of coffees 70$ plus tip.Now here's where I will offer two alternatives.  If you just want a burger and fries and are a bit thrifty with your cash (and are in the location) the Broome Street Bar does a top burger that rivals the burgers at The Spotted Pig, and the fries are good to.  A burger at the Broome is between 8$ and $9, with a side of fries that is more than enough for two for a few dollars.  So if you're already downtown and on a limited budget, consider Broome.My second reason for an alternative goes like this.  The most expensive main at The Pig was $32 dollars for scallops, that's a lot.  The least expensive apart from the burger was $24, still quite a lot,.  All starters are about $12 - $14 not cheap. This puts it in restaurant territory!  if you are out with friends and up for a couple of courses each and some wine, and in the fortunate position to order from any part of the menu, I would recommend The Tasting Rooms on Elizabeth Street. The tasting rooms has the same relaxed atmosphere, with waiting staff in denim, but has more space, not so noisy, and I bet the bills would add up to about the same -  may be a little more in The Tasting Rooms.  But for those extra few bucks, you get space, better food, and a better dinning experience.  However, if you get lured by those great cocktails and the fancy wine --- BOOM - grab that credit card as it's gone do some chin ups!.I don't want to put The Spotted Pig down, as I liked it, just over priced for the surrounding.  Do give it a go, the cooking and food is good, but I just think there is better value to be found in NYC.  I have rated it only three based on cost.  On food it would be an easy four.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

We had to get their on tap Speckled Hen - went great with both the burger and chowder. The burger was soooo good. Very simple. Just meat + cheese + bun. We even asked the waitress if there were any add-on options to the burger but she politely suggested that once we tried the burger, we wouldn't want to add anything to it. She was right! The quality of these 3 ingredients (I wish I knew what bread they used, the cheese was Roquefort) made one savory, tasty burger. The burger came with a  heaping side of shoestring fries. I liked how they added little pieces of fried garlic and rosemary. Yum!I wish I could say my haddock chowder was just as good, but it was alright.

Not much new to report on The Spotted Pig, but I'll say it anyway. After sending my burger list to a buddy I hadn't seen in 6 months, he told me he wanted to come here. From where I live on the UES, it took 45 min to come here for a Sat. lunch, so this is kind of a one and done experience for me.First, the infamous wait. For a 1pm lunch, the place was packed, and we were told 40 min.  We figured it would give us plenty of time to catch up, so we CLEARLY sat at the restaurant bench outside the window. At the 40 min mark, we went in to check, and were told they called our name out the door 10 min ago. Yeah, okay. But they still gave us the very next table which we had to wait another 10 min for. We were seated along the bench by the window which had very low-set tables and stools, which is slightly awkward. Oh, and they seated us right next to a heatpipe! Blergh! Really, you set up a table next to a heatpipe?!We both came here for the burger. Their beer selection is decent, so my buddy got one (I approve since I MUST do burgers with either beer or coke), and I got a coke, which was miniscule. The burgers took over 30 to finally arrive, which was a little annoying. My first thought: good but overrated. The meat is excellent quality and was prepared medium to order, there's no doubt of that. While I do like my burgers seasoned with salt and pepper, this is one of the only ones I've had that was just TOO salty, as was the Roquefort cheese it was topped with. It was overpowering and distracting. Besides that, the burger was still good, and I loved the toasted brioche bun it was served on (probably helped soak up some of the saltiness). Also, while I don't mind lack of toppings and just enjoying the meat (yeah, I said that), as in Minetta Tavern, this burger could have helped from some. The fries, on the other hand, were great. Extremely thin-cut and topped with rosemary, some of the best I've ever had. Unfortunately, my buddy and I both did note though that they are so thin and long that they are way too unwieldy.Overall, service was okay. We got our waters refilled once and the waitress checked up on us every now and then once the food (finally) arrived. Décor was pretty standard for an upscale gastro-pub, and as I mentioned, tables are kind of awkwardly low-set. I didn't get a chance to see their fancypants 2nd floor, which is supposedly the celeb haunt. Would I come back here? Given the combo of price, commute, wait, and the fact that I thought the burger was overrated, probably not.

Each had a very different flavor and they actually complemented each other well!The beef hash is a variation on the commoner's corned beef hash. It was served with poached eggs which were light and fluffy although the dish was a tad spicy for all of our palates. The french toast was the ""GOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAL"" moment. Thick bread toasted just enough to make the outside crispy but still soft in the middle, it has a syrup that is to die for! The burger was served with a very powerful roquefort blue cheese, which unfortunately overpowered the melt-in-your-mouth beef and the grilled bun. A little less cheese would have made it swell.

The next time I head to Spotted Pig will be on a day I've opted to play hookie from work. While I love the bustling crowds when I'm on the prowl, the long waits for a table can be a real turn-off.

We waited much longer than an hour !!  Finally we got a table. A table that had been empty the entire time we waited which doesn't make any sense as to why we had to wait all that time. When we ordered they forgot our starters and delivered cold entres.  And the wait from ordering til the entres arrived was nearly an hour. What a complete disappointment.

2292,Jjvfpsiy-qYNjUs3amuyRQ,Alex J.,5.0 star rating,"I am normally reluctant to write the 15023452nd review of a popular place. But Spotted Pig deserves it. We came there on a Tuesday night at about 9pm. We got an appalling 1 hour 45 minute wait time for a table. My friend who turned away being told that there's a 2 hour wait time, noticed that the wait times are lower if you're good looking, so she's going to hit the place with a push-up bra next time. But being a man, I couldn't really do push-up bras. I didn't care about the wait time and just barged in - I always find a way.There were people standing and waiting for bar spots. Within 5 minutes we secured two places at a bar, ordered a beer (good but expensive), and proceeded to order food at the bar itself. It reminded me of getting food in Japan. The place was swarming with well-dressed British-looking glamor types, and I was impressed when the waitress could distinguish between Irish and Scottish accents.I've tasted the liver - deliciously made, very buttery inside (almost feared that it's still raw), I loved it even though I normally hate liver. I wanted to see if a master chef can make something horrible taste good. And yes, they can. The best liver of my life.I've also tried the burger. It left me speechless, and I still have warm and fuzzy memories of it. Other Yelpers have described it in more detail. In its perfectly toasted buttery juiciness and blue cheesy spiciness the best burger of my life, at ""only"" the double the price of the average NYC pub burger.The shoestring fries were interesting: they fried them with onion and rosemary, and sprinkled with a lot of salt. I'd actually prefer less salt and would add it myself if necessary.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

2294,FM24v3yADQ_a-gAGVvZmmw,Claire V.,5.0 star rating,"We went out last night for my friend's birthday, and I think I have a new favorite restaurant.  It's a little annoying as they don't take reservations and are ridiculously popular, and I've never come close to waiting 2 hours for a table before, but I knew it would be that long, and prepared by eating a good amount of vegetables ahead of time.  We went at the worst time, about 8 pm (even though I thought it might not be bad, as it was a Wednesday), so at other times the wait must not be as bad.  Here is my only criticism: As a former hostess, and as anyone in a restaurant should know, the first cardinal sin is exceeding a quoted wait time.  As in, if you are 99% sure a table will be available in 30 minutes, you should tell a customer the wait is 45 minutes, and thus they will be pleased when in fact it takes less time.  In the event that estimated wait time is exceeded, it is paramount to offer increasingly offended customers a token such as a free drink or appetizer, either while they continue to wait, or deducted from their bill.  However, it sounds like everyone waits a really f*ing long time here, and as modus operandi, that would mean the Pig would bleed freebies.But to get to the point: it was incredibly good.  The Spotted Pig is a ""gastro pub,"" which may sound lame and pretentious, but is a perfect descriptor.  A small tavern in Greenwich Village, reviewers claim its burger single-handedly won it a Michelin star, and I whole-heartedly support that conjecture.  Five of us ordered stuff and shared everything, and it was all amazingly good.  Bacon-wrapped figs, homemade picked veggies, deviled eggs, lentil salad with parsnip chips, gnudi (like mini pierogi, little balls of pasta filled with creamy ricotta-like cheese, in a brown butter sauce that tasted like melted gold), le burger medium-rare with Roquefort, and rosemary-garlic shoestring fries (the garlic and rosemary were deep-fried with the potatoes, so you could crunch them whole), a braised lamb dish with creamy polenta that just tasted like awesome roast beef, and an orangey creme brulee and chocolate cake for dessert.  It was the perfect meal.  All I can add is imagine what you want each of these dishes to taste like in your dreams, go there, open your eyes, eat, and smile, smile, smile.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

It's definitely a fun spot for early or late drinks (prime hours the place is packed and way uncomfortable), and the food is pretty good. That being said, I've noticed the quality of this place go downhill after renovation, so I'll just share a few differences I noticed after they expanded.First of all- the pricing's gone up while the food quality's gone down. I'm sure they've gotta cut some corners and charge more to make a bigger profit, but it's really been a disservice to the customers. The first time I went I had some amazing gnocchi (probably the best I'd had in New York!) but on second trip, the portions were way smaller and the gnocchi was gummy as hell. I'm also not a huge fan of the new upstairs space. It feels much more formal than downstairs, which maybe some people are into, but if I'm going to a gastropub, I want it to feel more like a pub and less like it's trying to be Town or another Jeffrey Zacharian joint. The service here has always been a tad snotty-- do I not look appropriately moneyed enough for you folks?-- but the last time I went it was ridiculous. Our waitress didn't come by for at least 20 minutes, and I ended up ordering our drinks at the bar. Not cool.

I've seen a lot of Yelpers  comment on the burger being too salty, but I think it's the cheese, cuz to me, the burger itself was just fine, in fact, it was perfectly cooked. Anyway, I really liked it, and the shoestring fries with fried slices of garlic and fried rosemary are fantastic.

The Cuban sandwich that's only available at lunchtime is worth a trip in the middle of the day, it's the most amazing version of a pork sandwich you'll ever taste.Thumbs down on the Spotted Pig cask ale though, it tasted something like a 50/50 blend of PBR with Saranac ale.  Maybe it is a deliberate blend of lowbrow meets middle class (ironically, in an extravagantly priced neighborhood) that they are going for?  I expected a bit more from the draft selection.Update:  Months later, and I've moved to the left coast, and I have dreams about eating here.

Pass on all the tasty, fragrant morsels that pass by, the wonderful devils on horse back or the blue cheese anything, instead move to the whole reason you suffer through a dry Sunday roast of pork with Granny - because of the crackling! It's a perfectly formed pig's ear of pure crackling - delicious to the last lip smacking bite (sorry to my vegetarian friend next to me - ooops), complete with a caper berry salad to cut the sense of fat.

This place has everything I like about the west village.... quaint place, nice decor, pretty people, good bar scene. We ordered some appetizers. The gnudi, phenomenal! (but i suspect anything drowned in butter will taste great)... the other appetizer, some sort of non-chicken fried egg on a bed of greens, also quite delightful. The next wave was the real disappointment. All 3 of us at the table got the famous burgers there. (i was going for the halibut but they were out - wtf?). I got mine medium-rare, the meat was OK... but the blue cheese they put on the top completely masked the meat taste... that was a huge spoiler. The fries looked great too, nice and thin and crispy with probably a touch of thyme (was it?)... but I felt like they had dragged my fries into the dead sea before putting them on my plate (ie: they were overly salty) .... the side of broccoli rab we got was also the same... WAYYYY too salty. I left with a serious sense of disappointment. Will I be back? Maybe for the bar... w/ a few appetizers on order... but dont get the burger.... right now best place for that is Shake Shack or Peter Luger's.Updated 11/22/2010:I went back here again this past week and re-confirmed my aversion to the ""blasts of salt"" (newyorker.com/reporting/…) they use in the cuisine.

2340,QC2HQwUdBcHy2ugLJbMa9Q,Andrew C.,5.0 star rating,"I would like to consider myself a connoisseur of the hamburger.  I can enjoy them on so many levels.  I enjoy the simplicity of the McDonald's hamburger, or basque in the triumph of a well executed burger-spectacular.   Whenever I travel I always seek out the best place to get a Hamburger.  This brings me to a fantastic place in the East Village called The Spotted Pig.  I first experienced the Spotted pig almost two years ago while visiting a friend for the weekend while I was traveling on business in Upstate New York.  I was scheduled to fly back to Los Angeles, but decided it would be a nice to see an old friend and visit the greatest City in the world.  This burger experience happened by chance.  A conversation that went something like this ""We are going to this place that a friend of a friend of a friend works at... and it's  owned by JayZ, Bono, the Dali lama, Bill Gates and Boutros Boutros Gali.""  Not quite that exaggerated, but there was definitely a little mystery about the joint.When we got there it was PACKED!  It was during the Gay Pride parade and the surrounding streets were filled with revelers.  So we head inside and with a secret handshake we are granted access.  Now I was a little tipsy, but I do remember having the most magical burger to pass these lips.  I remember commenting that If a Unicorns existed, and it was socially acceptable to eat them... THIS is what they taste like!  For the last two years I have not shut up about that burger, it was unlike anything I had ever experienced and could not wait to go back.  I would say I have sent no less than 5 friends and family members to eat there, and they have not been disappointed. MLK weekend 2009 was when I would return.It was Sunday around 12:30pm on the coldest day of Winter when my girlfriend and I walked in.  We were greeted and lead to our table right away by the very friendly and approachable staff.  Upon recommendation of a friend I had sent to the Spotted pig, we started with the deviled eggs... delicious!!  Hard to place the flavor profile, but in the creamiest of fillings I believe there is some vinegar perhaps cold pressed olive oil, whatever it was was delicious.  Since it was Sunday morning it was also washed down with an expertly spiced Bloody Mary.  Then the moment I had been counting down the hours to... burger time.  My first observation is it was bigger than I remembered...(I'll spare you the obvious joke), and it was waging War like ancient Empires for territory with a mountain of garlic fries.  Perfectly shoestring cut with the right amount of salt and some sort of chopped leafy green herb make McDonald's fries taste like cardboard.  The element that sets the fries into savory orbit, sliced garlic that is fried to crispy perfection interlaced with the fries.  Every few bites of golden fries comes a subtle crunch of a mini garlic wafer.  These fries could warm to coldest of souls on this chilly January afternoon.  Now it is time to turn to the star of the meal.The perfectly toasted bun appears to be freshly baked in-house and fluffy as a down pillow.  I pull back the bun to take a look at whats going on at the scene of the crime.  A perfectly shaped patty with a little salt and pepper and a perfectly melted dollop of Roquefort cheese.  No lettuce, no onions, no ketchup, this burger is an homage to how the simplicity of two ingredients can breed greatness.  Looking down at my burger with the top bun removed suddenly I feel something amiss.  Suddenly I am at the Louvre staring at the Mona Lisa with something missing.  Instead of her signature sfumato smile she is donning a pair of Red waxed lips, you know the kind that children hate to receive on Halloween... I put the top bun back on top, and the signature smile returns. I take my first bite, and I am immersed into instant bliss.  The past two years waiting for this burger to touch my taste buds again were not wasted in vein.  I was instantly gratified knowing anyone I has sent here now owed me a favor.  The combination of savory burger/Roquefort and slightly sweet bun is a match made in culinary heaven.  The burger was perfectly cooked medium rare, as requested, and the juices were soaked up by the spongy bun that would make a Shamwow jealous.  I temporarily lost track of the social obligation of conversation, and 10 minutes 47 seconds after starting I finished my burger and promptly apologized to my Girlfriend for ignoring her the entire time.  There could have been a grease fire in the kitchen that blocked my only exit from the building and I would not have addressed the situation until that burger was finished.I guess what I am saying is if you have the means, go to the Spotted Pig and get the Burger.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

The burger was absolutely AWESOME with the roquefort (I thought the cheese was good, but can be on the strong side for people that usually just get American/Cheddar). The shoestring fries tasted very similar to the marcona almonds with rosemary that you can find at Trader Joe's (maybe because the shoestring fries were fried WITH rosemary). The cubano sandwich...was the best sandwich I've had since Potbelly's (a chain from the midwest - if you're ever in the Chicago area, you HAVE to get an Italian with hot peppers...no joke)! Actually, I take that back since Mary's Fish Camp AND the Pearl Oyster bar have awesome lobster rolls/sandwiches. Anyway, the cubano sandwich had pulled pork, pickles, grilled cheese, all put on a crusty piece of french bread. It was AMAZING! The arugula salad was lightly dressed with a lemony dressing (also great).  Our waiter was slightly...ditzy?  Well, not ditzy...I don't want to be rude, but he was the type that's in his own world at times.  If I had to compare him to anyone from television, I'd compare him to Phoebe Buffet from Friends.  You know, sometimes they're just not all there?  The Spotted Pig is a great place for lunch (if Bill Clinton eats there, you should, too!) and I would go there all the time if the food wasn't so likely to give me a premature heart attack.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Mainly because my experience was amazing, but the long wait list, fairly expensive entrees and ""plates"" ranging from ($17-$30) and wines by the glass ($10-$20) still seemed a little overpriced for the lax atmosphere that this place exudes. I think Batali's style is to have a laid back atmosphere with amazing food.By lax I mean, the bar tender was covered in tattoos and almost everyone had piercings and a hipster style. People kind of dressed like... ""ya, I'd going to pick up my laundry after i grab some organic coffee and a vegan burrito."" Everyone was sooo nice though, and the food was damn delicious! Their beers are decently priced, but the wines a little pricey by the glass for a limited selection. Their wines by the bottle have a much better value and selection. Delicious plates! I highly recommend the lentil salad and mozzarella plate. My best friend and each got 2 beers and 2 glasses of mulled wine (BEST I have ever had! Hot sangria anyone?), 2 ""plates,"" and one main course. The bill was a hundo, but 50 per person for a meal that was fully satiating was well worth it. We shared everything, which I highly recommend in order to taste the menu. If you are with a friend and not a date, I highly suggest snagging a bar seat. We got super lucky and snagged a seat at the bar, after being told the wait was an hour and a half for two (granted, a Saturday night at 8:30PM). You have to kind of hover over people to ensure your seat at the bar. Spotted Pig is definitely worth the price, but I wouldn't go every day. Their menu is small and you cannot make substitutions (a typical chef thing in a nice restaurant). Their burger was good, but with no condiments (just a patty and bun with cheese and HUGE portion of incredible fries) was not really worth the price. Everything else, like stated before was delicious (the lentils with grilled radicchio, and mozzarella with arugula). Their sauces are very nice.

I NEVER get good service at brunch anywhere, so I wasn't too upset. At least they were friendly folks. Anyway, we had bacon hash with poached eggs and the cuban sandwich. Both were incredible! The poached eggs were PERFECTION!!! They were not too hard, not too soft...they pleasantly melded with the hash, and had an almost creamy texture. Dreamy. The cubano had delightful little cornichons, mustard and gruyere. The addition of prosciutto to the slow cooked pork was such a nice detail- subtle but an extra layer of flavor.

I used to stare at the photos online and wonder what they tasted like, cursing the fact that the Spotted Pig was on the complete opposite side of the country and I didn't have much of a reason to venture out that way anymore. But I vowed that I would get to try them one day and try them I did on my recent trip to NY. And were they as good as I imagined them to be? They were. They were so so good I'm almost sad that I actually got to try it since now that I really know how good they taste, the distance between CA and the Spotted Pig seems farther than ever. We flew in late and didn't even get to our hotel till past midnight but we were so famished and knowing the bar was going to be open till 2 a.m., we ventured out with visions of Gnudi dancing in our heads (OK, my head, I don't think my bf had any idea what I was going on and on about).The Spotted Pig was still very busy when we got there but seeing how it was fairly late to be dining, we were seated quickly and service was prompt.We ordered the Pot of Pickles, Chicken Liver Toast, Poached Duck Egg with Lamb's Tongue and Flageolet Beans, the Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi with Brown Butter and Sage (of course!), and the Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese and Shoestring Fries.I adore Pickles so getting them was a no-brainer. I definitely did like them although they were very tart and vinegary, almost mouth puckeringly so. I liked the variety of the different vegetables that came in the pot and happily crunched away on almost all of it by myself. The Chicken Liver Toast had an earthy taste that is characteristic of liver and a slight sweetness to it which I assumed was from a fortified wine they must have added to the mixture. It was a great little bite to start the meal off with and left me looking forward to everything else. The Lamb Tongue was also delicious, slightly gamey with a tang from mustard in the sauce, paired really well with creamy beans and a poached duck egg which the buttery yolk just oozed out of. The quality of the meat in the Burger was good too, very tender and juicy and the bun had a slight crispness from the char. But in all honesty, I'd have to say it was really really salty. I thought it was from the cheese so I scraped it off but the patty itself was too salty, almost to a point that it was difficult to finish. The shoestring fries with fried garlic chips and rosemary were fabulous though. Crispy and savory, you sort of caught yourself picking out the garlic chips to munch on and dabbing at the fried rosemary leaves with your fingers to get every last piece.And the Gnudi? I'm not sure any description would do the tenderest little balls of pure cheesy buttery goodness any justice. But I will say that they were every bit as delicious as I imagined they would be and at this moment as I type this it is taking every ounce of willpower I have to refrain myself from searching airfare to NY just so I can go back and have them again.

My sandwich was so greasy in the middle that it was soggy and dripped down my hands when I tried to bite into it, but the bread was so burnt and hard around the edges that I literally couldn't do so without losing a tooth! So, it was basically inedible. My husband's sandwich was also swimming in grease and had way too much cheese that you couldn't even find the meat(if there was any, we're still not sure!). So, he didn't eat his either. It was then that we realized why there were so many burgers coming out of the kitchen... Clearly the only safe choice!! The waitress noticed that we obviously didn't enjoy our lunch, so instead of offering something else of taking it off the bill(we ordered an expensive bottle of wine, so she still would've been tipped), she threw in a very good, but very tiny banana dessert.

Time it took for a table? 3 HOURS!!!! We were basically starving since minute 1- so imagine just how torturous this was for our belly's. More often than not.. when a person is starving... things simply taste a lot better.. even plain ol crackers. Every few minutes that passed, another tray of S-pigs burgers came out from the kitchen to tease by giving us a quick whiff. Each time we wanted to give up and leave - another tray came out to suck us back in.. it was pure hell. As we waited we invested into what seemed to be a very promising burger by drinking pints of waaaay overpriced beer (9 bucks a pint!). But this was a SMALL price to pay if the burger tasted as good as it looked. By hour 3 our table was ready- walked through the hordes of people and sat upstairs in the corner. Ordered 2 burgers- Cod- Pork belly-Chicken liver toast- toasted Almonds and Olives. Almonds and Olives came first - Olives were very tasteless and a total rip off $4.50 for 7-9 olives! Almonds however were SOOO dam salty! This tiny bowl was the size of a half dollar and probably held about 20-25 almonds- Three grown men needed 3 glasses of water EACH to wash down the saltiness of the nuts. If we weren't so dam hungry we woulda stopped eating it at nut 1. Next came the chicken liver toast.. which wasnt bad but again overly salty.. hmm 'salty' seems to be a recurring theme here at Spotted Pig. We were overjoyed when our entrees arrived- we looked at each other and nodded- almost as to say: YAY WE MADE IT! *TEAR* I manhandled my burger with both hands as i'd do a ginormous boob... and took the biggest chomp out of it i could.. FLAVOR FLAV! Screamed throughout my head - agonizingly, spine cringing SALTY! FUCK ME this burger is SALTY! So SALTY my tongue shriveled up on contact like a dick that has to fuck Rachael Ray. My hunger induced frenzied chewing began to slow..confusion sets in. WHY?!  In denial I swallowed my first bite..Only to take another but not before I drank another half glass of water to properly clear my palate. Second bite was actually worse than the first! I know that Roquefort cheese is salty and all but this is just ridiculous- the cheese curds were completely loaded on the burger. By this time I simply could not tolerate another bite of the burger- my tongue was numb. Maybe the fries would be a bit different? You want some fries with that salt? Good luck trying to get these shoestrings in your mouth, they hook on your face and get all messy.. think octopus on face. Its a good thing we ordered an additional entree I thought to myself- the Pork belly sure did look fabulous. The pork was nice and tender upon the first bite but dare I try the skin? Yes please! My salt induced tongue rash flared up like the 4th of July- If my tongue could talk it would've said ""Feeck eeuuu!"" Ever heard of the tactic where amusement parks overly salt their food so that more drinks are consumed to make revenue? Well you have your prime example here at Spotted Pig- to the extreme.Overpriced, Over hyped, Over the top Salty. Oh no. Game Over.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Was traveling alone and had high recommendation from a very picky sibling that this was 'must do' so made a special trip here to eat dinner on my last night in NYC. Laid back vibe here but crowded which meant no tables so headed up to the 2nd floor bar. Not only did Alex make me two of the best 'spot on' cocktails I've ever had, he steered me to the perfect IPA and was very helpful in ordering dinner (as well as eating it, since he gave me a tip to mix the rillette so I didn't get a mouthful of duck fat instead of pate) Clearly, he cares about/has a passion for his work and I also observed him to take care of other parties around me in the same way and going the extra mile to give customers just what they wanted--even when that took quite awhile to tease out of them. I had a fabulous dinner where I felt relaxed and personally attended to (thx for the history lesson about Chartreuse btw!) despite dropping in on a very busy Sunday night. I even left with the exact recipe for my favorite drink--yay!

My first visit was with my parents on the night of a huge snow storm. It was so good that when I went back to New York with my man two weeks later, Spotted Pig had to be on the itinerary. The first time during the storm, the place was jammed. Despite it being a white-out outside, we had to wait an hour for a table. No problem, we got cozy at the bar with a few $8 draughts (NYC prices, people) and made small talk with our neighbors. We were seated upstairs in a sea of pig paraphernalia. The decor feels more like an English pub that has been around since the dawn of time than a trendy downtown eatery. My parents and I split the gnudi for starters (AMAZING). My dad had the calf liver special, and my stepmom and I both had burgers. Yes, the burger is salty (it's the Roquefort cheese), but the meat is amazing. When ordered med-rare, it actually comes out as ordered. The meat is juicy and fluffy, and you can tell the it wasn't beaten to death on the grill by some line-cook. My stepmom couldn't stop talking about the New Yorker article, so see the for more info. The huge pile of rosemary fries was more than enough, and the garlic shavings in the was a nice surprise. Also, this place actually makes a decent cappuccino. Our server had some troubles with our bill (forgot the drinks, accidentally put someone else's dessert on it), but she comped an $18 glass of wine to make up for it. No points lost for that, we all make mistakes, and she was really sweet. My boyfriend and I went back this week. We showed up after midnight for dinner, and the place was more quieter than my last visit. Kitchen is open until two, which is so good to know. I basically forced him to eat what I wanted, so we split the gnudi (still AMAZING) and the burger. It was just enough food for both of us. We followed it up with a creme catalan (more like a brule than any creme catalan I've had before, but fine by me), and I had a glass of port (yum). Our server was down-to-earth but still folded my man's napkin when he used the WC.

It's definitely pricey for brunch (16-18 an entrée) and the food is hit or miss.  Some dishes were absolutely delicious, while others were just okay.  Let's start with the good: the lemon ricotta pancakes were heavenly and literally melted in my mouth.  They came just as advertised, complete with toasted almonds that added a perfect crunch.  The salmon plate (it was a special) was tasty, but very simple (literally lox, onions, capers, parsley and lemon - where were the carbs??).  Definitely could have made this at home and saved a lot of money.  We also ordered a whole wheat biscuit that came with honey butter.  The outside was crispy and delicious, but the inside was undercooked and soggy.  I had a bite of my friend's grilled cheese, which was heavy, but very yummy.  The shoestring fries were also a hit with our table.  I have a soft spot for skinny fries, and these were skinny perfection.  The atmosphere is very cute and similar to what I imagine would be the setting for the Mad Hatter's tea party.  I loved that there were coat hooks next to each table and there was both a high and low hook (it's all in the details!).  My only gripe decoration wise was the abundance of cute piggy banks/pig pictures - there were cute pigs everywhere and 90% of the menu items featured some sort of pork - does that creep anyone else out?  It just seems wrong.In sum, get the lemon ricotta pancakes - amazing!!

Gooey and really salty.  The toast points were okay, but they really didn't add anything except to act as a plate for the liver. My Roquefort burger and shoestrings?  Awful.  First, the meat is shaped like a perfectly made hockey puck.  Second, I ordered well done and I got medium. To top it off, I waited at least twenty to thirty minutes for it, and got it after a couple had received their burgers when they ordered ten minutes after me. Third, again, it was caustic.  Very salty.  In fact the meat was only there to support all the salt they put on the burger. Fourth & fifth, the Roquefort had some blue-ey taste but was really salty. When I asked if I could get tomato and onion for my burger, the waiter told me ""no"", the tomato and onion isn't available for the hamburgers.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Is this from the chef's pretension? Or some fantasy that tomato and onion will affect the delicate balance between the harmonious  rapture of the ground beef and roquefort cheese? Maybe the chef is scared the onion and tomatoes will over power the salt?  Thank G-d I was allowed ketchup.  Actually, now that I think about it, maybe the chef and/or management is a Reagan Conservative.  As in ""Ketchup is a Fucking Vegetable!""  How about them shoestrings?  Well, they're certainly stringy.  You taste some garlic and rosemary but there's a even heavier taste to them.  I bet you can guess what I'm going to say.I will say that the French press coffee is good.  And 1/2 of the staff I encountered seemed professional.  However, it's not enough for me to give a second star.  My advice is if you want good chopped liver go to Sammy's Romanian.  If you want a good Roquefort burger and fries, and you're willing to travel, then maybe Alchemy on 5th Avenue by Bergen Street  in Brooklyn.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Overall from the moment we sat down we had a great time... and enjoyed a great meal with a very kind staff! It is not a place I recommend for groups or very large people (seating is tight), and don't ever go on your first date you may run out of things to go before you even start your meal!",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

And so I decided to continue this trend and check out The Spotted Pig one late afternoon when I knew there wouldn't be a wait.I had no preconceived notions of their burger, other than it having won acclaim from many New Yorkers. And so I posted up at the empty bar and ordered an Old Speckled Hen and their burger. Much to my surprise the burger is presented on an over flowing plate of shoestring fries*, seared bun and no additional fixings or condiments (there is ketchup and mustard available, but I wanted to try this burger in its untouched form). There is a blue cheese spread on the burger however, so I was quite intrigued to dive in. And it happened to be an excellent burger that was grilled to perfection. The blue cheese was very tasty and offered an interesting spin. However it wasn't as evenly distributed across the burger patty as I might have liked, so there were a few intense bites interceded with more calm and beef-only bites. I could have remedied the situation easily enough myself, but I was feeling lazy. And no matter, I thoroughly enjoyed myself and the burger all the same. It was also nice to have visited on a quite weekday afternoon, which allowed me to enjoy my book, a beer and a burger at the bar without the atmosphere being too crowded and stimulating.*I despise shoe string fries.

However, it was all downhill from there. If you want little bang for your buck and to get treated like dirt, go here.I worked in an upscale restaurant for many years, so I give most people in the industry the benefit of the doubt when it comes to service. You could be having a bad day, tired, etc. But our server quite honestly didn't give a flying flip about us, never checked on us, never smiled once, never said please or thank you once, and looked like he was trying to act comatose when dealing with us. You know it's bad when the guy who brings your food is markedly friendlier than the guy taking your order/asking for your tip.Also, the food was mediocre at best. I had the deviled egg, which was oversalted and sparsely garnished. If I'm paying $3.50 for 1 egg, I expect a better effort. Then I had the burger, on which the bun was super stale and ruined the sandwich. I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of the Spotted Pig Bitter beer, though. All in all, very disappointing.

2434,JBD6SbMZ0ZQGW16TNmwYow,Jack N.,4.0 star rating,"The burger is a must try, hold the mustard and ketchup. Let the cheese do the work. The wait sucks, 30 min even at 1130p.I heard about this place for a while, but I have been, mainly cuz its not anywhere close to any train stations. But after hearing ppl in Jeff C.'s group rave about their burger (and their 3rd flr, open only to famous ppl like Anthony Bourdain or for special events), I had to try this place.This place is super packed on a Friday night, and we were surprised that we had to wait 30 minutes for a table. Granted, it was for 6 ppl, but still, its no fun to wait. Good thing I had my first dinner (albeit not fulfilling) at Knife+Fork already. After 30 minutes of wait, they finally were willing to seat us, if our entire party was there, except someone from our group decided to walk his friend to the train station (and ended up getting lost), but I was prepared. I told the Maitre'd that one of our friend is in the restroom, and asked to be seated now. He, of course, obliged, not knowing that was a lie. Then came the ordering process. They only take one order for the table, so we had to wait for the guy that supposedly was in the bathroom (but he was now lost, unable to find his way back). So after about another 20 minutes of waiting, we finally agreed to order for him (as he cabbed back to our location). The waiter was a bit pushy, and pretty much told us what to order. When we order the burger for our friend that was ""in the bathroom"", he told us that he will put his order for medium instead of medium rare, due to his fake ""illness"".Anyway, after this whole crazy mess, we were finally able to get our hands on the burger. It came w/ a plateful of shoestring fries made w/ rosemary and garlic. But it was the burger that completely knocked it out of the ballpark for me. I only had 1/2 a burger (thinking the whole thing would be too much since I had dinner),  but that 1/2 a burger was insane. The patty was thick, juicy, and tender in every bite. But it was the cheese that makes the burger. The cheese is a roquefort cheese, which is a blue cheese. When its on the burger, it is not very strong. But its the other flavors of the cheese that literally felt like a marching band of various flavors going through my mouth. You don't need anything else to enhance the flavor of this burger. I'm almost 100% sure if you try by adding ketchup or other types of condiments you only ruin the fantastic explosion of taste in your mouth. That being said, the guy that had his burger done to medium complained that the burger tasted ""dry"". Eh, that's what happens when you were ""supposedly"" in the bathroom for 20 minutes.As for the fries, they were good, actually quite addicting, after downing 1/2 a burger and still craving for something more. But I definitely felt a blister on my tongue after going through a good chunk of the fries. Stick w/ the burger (and whatever else that they have that's ""not on the menu""), and don't let the waiter convince you out of it. I won't elaborate more than that, but we're still regretting about that part.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Once we were seated we ordered the deviled eggs, devils on horseback, and chicken liver toast. Oh my god the chicken liver toast is something I could eat every fucking day. SO DELICIOUS. The deviled eggs were really good too, really rich and smooth with great flavor. The devils on horseback were good, but not my favorite. My friend really loved them though. Next we ordered the sheeps milk gnudi, the prosciutto ricotta tart with marjoram, and the fluke crudo. The gnudi was really great, very creamy and subtly sweet. The prosciutto tart was excellent, it was like a puff pastry type tart with prosciutto and marjoram. It was soOOOOOOOOO good, so light and airy. It was like a bomb ass salad over puff pastry (which is like my favorite thing EVER). The crudo was okay... i'm not huge on sashimi but it was fresh and light so it was a good thing to have since we ordered like everything on the menu. For our entree meal my friend and I ordered pork belly with a side of Brussels sprouts. The pork belly was good, but not as good as I would have liked. I think we got a piece with a higher fat ratio than normal, because it was like 100% fat instead of having a little meat on it. It was probably the richest pork belly I've ever had so I couldn't eat much of it. I think it would have been really good if it had something to cut the richness. My friend loved it though, I think it was her first time having pork belly too (she's a ""vegetarian""). THE BRUSSELS SPROUT ARE INSANE! They were so tender and perfectly caramelized. It was my friend who insisted on ordering them but I am really glad we did. I bet their other sides are incredible as well. For desert we ordered the flourless chocolate cake and the creme dessert (creme brulee). They were both amazing. The chocolate cake was delicious and dense and really rich but so divine (i'm not even a chocolate fan) and the creme one was awesome too.

People squeeze in around the bar like pigs around a trough, squealing to get the bartender's attention for another pint. It's dark, it's noisy, and its hastily decorated with swine trinkets. Those who get seats at a table are on stools bumped around by rushed wait staff and intoxicated customers trying to make their way to the bathroom. This may not sound appealing, but the uncomfortable, messy, and unrefined atmosphere works as a surprisingly pleasing foil to the world class food they serve. Palates which are accustomed to experiencing such refined food in equally refined dining environments are therefore in for a taste enhancing contrast of the senses. On the one hand, your eyes and ears subconsciously tell your mouth and nose, based on the decor and ambiance, to expect mediocre food. However, once your taste buds and olfactory nerves get to experiencing the food, it becomes one wonderfully confusing and lovely combination of seemingly contradictory sensory perceptions.P.S. - Mario Batali is my hero.

2469,TNUhttclXXuSBWvJxB3_Sg,Liz E.,4.0 star rating,"The Spotted Pig definitely has hidden cameras hooked up to their host stand, or the host himself most certainly has some sort of camera embedded into his pupils. The fact that my friend and I were able to put our names down, go upstairs for forty-five minutes, and be approached by a server with menus who never saw us before but knew the name, was remarkable. A point to note: I have never been to the Spotted Pig but I was absolutely taken in by all of the pig decor and the lively feel of the bar area. Definitely like a classy British pub.My friend and I were seated downstairs and were left to mull over what the hell to get. I'm usually the one who takes charge, commanding that my friends order this this and this, but with no prior knowledge I let my friend decide with everything.Here's what we ordered: 1) Devils on Horseback - a first for me. I can't think of a better combination than sticky sweet prunes and smoky bacon. Orgasm in bite size form. 2)  Rollmops - I was always curious about this Dutch delicacy, so I jumped at the opportunity to have some. Delicious, but probably more so if you like fish. 3) Chicken Liver on Toast - At first I was skeptical, not being a huge fan of liver, but I have to say this spreadable organ, combined with the excellent bread, was like having a crush on the kid who previously pulled my hair throughout kindergarten. 4) Smoked haddock chowder - the complete antithesis of the goop fit for invalids from my youth. This chowder seemed to have a mirepoix of potatoes and fish, to use the term loosely, but I was enamored by the precise cubes that dominated the flavorful soup. The homemade crackers were like crunchy little pillows for Thumbalina(Thumbelina?): fabulous. 5) Sheep's Ricotta Gnudi - I felt it was necessary to get the Pig's most well known dish, just to see what all of the fuss was about. It's the classic unfinishable dish - it's extremely rich and very heavy, but three little balls won't set you back too much.6) Crispy Pig's Ear Salad - another first for me, but a tasty one. I always assumed pigs' ears would be chewy  and more likely to be gnawed on, but this was extremely creamy, with the outward appearance of a giant dorito turned inside of itself. So creamy and fatty in fact, that I had to use the toothpicks from the devil's on horseback to unstick it from my teeth. Anyway, what made the dish a winner was its pairing with plenty of lettuces and a super acidic vinaigrette. An unusual dish worthy of trying out. To end the night, we had tea because we couldn't possibly tackle dessert.While everything was delicious and the atmosphere convivial and exciting, I was put off by how incredibly fast everything came out.  We weren't even finished with appetizers before the soup we shared came out, and we weren't even finished with that before the entrees were plopped down on the tiny table. Furthermore, the waiter was extremely spacy...not entirely with it.I would definitely give the Spotted Pig another go though, either for lunch or brunch.

Apparently so, because when I divulged this to my girlfriends over dinner, I got a couple of chuckles. In order to best avoid the dinner rush, my friends and I arrived at The Spotted Pig around 5:30 p.m. on Saturday night. Foreseeing a two-hour wait from some of the horror stories that I'd heard, I was pleasantly surprised when our table was ready for us by 6:15 p.m. Situated on a picturesque, tree-lined West Village street, The Spotted Pig is adorned with unfinished hardwood floors, exposed brick walls, an old-fashioned mahogany bar, menu specials written on a large brasserie mirror and decor consisting of shabby chotchkies and mismatched plants.To start, I ordered the deviled eggs followed by the infamous Spotted Pig burger (that I'd read so many raves about). The ""eggs"" (note the pluralization) were just one whole egg sliced in half. The cooked yolks were mixed with a zesty mustard blend, crunchy green chives and sprinkled with sea salt. Though I've had better versions, these devils were tasty and just ""enough"" substance to whet my appetite. The moment of truth came as my medium-cooked burger arrived. Enveloped between a grilled brioche bun was a generous portion of beef topped with an ample lathering of pungent and salty Roquefort cheese. Accompanying the sandwich was a mound of homemade shoestring fries, lightly dusted with sea salt and rosemary. Was the burger all it was cracked up to be? Indeed, it was. Though I felt that the amount of Roquefort used was slightly overpowering, the beef patty itself consisted of the highest quality ground meat, producing a juicy, velvety, melt-in-your-mouth masterpiece.My experience at The Spotted Pig was virtually liberated of anything negative that I'd heard. I found the service to be excellent and our wait-time minimal. The food was pretty impressive and I will absolutely return.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

The crab was not too salty (unlike a similar dish at Nougatine!!!), and the lemon hollandaise sauce was perfection. i love asparagus but always try to eat it in moderation (you know, because it makes your pee smell)- and finally......Lamb Heart w/ Fresh Greens & Asparagus: this was an overwhelming dish - my sister and i could barely finish because it was just tooo much meat. if you haven't had heart, be prepared for a sort of slippery texture. the meat is smooth and red (no fat or marble texture). we agreed it did not come with enough greens or carbs, so the variety was unbalanced.all in all, this whole meal was simply amazing and so different from what i've tried and other overpriced restaurants. the tab came out to about $80 for 2 (no drinks) which was not bad considering how much we ate. next time my sis and i are going to try the burger. seriously, every other order that came out of the kitchen was a burger. must be something good about it...",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

The comfortable dark-wood and exposed-brick interior, featuring carved pigs and drawings of assorted produce, provides a homey background for the eclectic menu. Goat cheese and hazelnuts sprinkled with flecks of lemon zest combine with either Jerusalem artichokes or grilled octopus for an outstanding salad to start. Calf's liver, lightly sauteed with sage and onions, and roast halibut in a parsley sauce, served with mashed potatoes, were delectable, but the moderately-priced entrees are served in smallish portions, and hearty appetites will need to order a la carte sides - a plate of five seasonal vegetables easily will serve two - to supplement their main course.

The burger was cooked perfectly; however, it was cold inside, which should not happen for medium. Also, the meat was SO salty. Everything here is SO incredibly salty. It's how imagine salt preserved meat tasted on the Mayflower. Also, the shoe strings were so incredibly salty that they were nearly inedible... now, upon reading this you may think I just hate salt, nope... I'm a person who puts extra salt on everything. The corner bistro down the street has a MUCH better burger. When I order meat it's because I enjoy the flavor of meat, I don't want that flavor hidden by being over-spiced. I also had the Deviled Egg, it was very good... but also, very salty and covered in olive oil, certainly not a negative but it definitely does nothing to make it more enjoyable. I went back again a few days later to give it another shot, this time for lunch and ordered the exact same thing, it was quite a bit better this time but still the same complaints. Additionally, a friend ordered the burger and asked for a different type of cheese and they said the Chef does not allow substitutions on her ""creations.""

I had those with the old speckled hen ale and it was a perfect combo. I have no idea how many calories are in them (guessing close to a million) but you've probably left those kinds of concerns at the door when you go to the Spotted Pig.I agree with what everyone is saying about the wait but... its a popular restaurant in NYC! I'm not surprised at all with the wait. More important to me is that they actually tell you what the time is going to be and they seem to be pretty accurate. On top of that, they could be nose-in-the-air snobs and get away with it but they don't! Really impressed with that.So why am I stripping them of two stars? Their famous burger is, quite frankly, crap. The meat was beautiful but they loaded it up with blue cheese until you could barely taste it. Having blue cheese on a burger is great but its like saying having sugar in your coffee is great - it doesn't mean you want 10 cubes. The second star - can we just distribute note pads to the city's wait staff? Our waitress was really cool but she didn't write anything down and if you can memorize 3 dishes, I really don't care. Right? I mean we're not talking rain man here - we're talking 3 dishes but if you write them down, I'm not annoyed either. Great, making good use of pen and paper... But instead she forgot our side dish of beets and greens that I really wanted. She said it would be comp'ed but we had long finished our mains and were waiting and waiting... At 11:15 on a Tuesday night, after 5 drinks, I'm thinking more about my bed and less about beets and greens. Sorry, 2nd star...I still think its a cool place and the staff is really great but the food didn't blow me away enough and the prices seem a bit high for what they're offering. Probably worth a visit but if I were in the neighborhood and wanted a good burger, I'd probably head to corner bistro, not get blown away by blue cheese and pay $11 less.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

So what does this have to do with it being, in my opinion, a five-star restaurant? There are many reasons why this place delivers.First, the location is in a part of the city that most of us see as being very cool or hip. It is a walking neighborhood, great for walking before or after dinner. The restaurant is famous, so the expectations are already there. It is, what I like to call, a memorabilia type bar; you know the ones that have walls covered with every kind of eye candy imaginable, great for getting conversations started even for the dimmest of minds. The place has been packed both times I have been there and we waited, not too long, but had enough time for a drink. I have been seated upstairs on both meals and the feel doesn't change much. We had started to look at the menu while waiting, placed our order and the culinary experience began. Joanne and I tried a a couple of bar snacks, plates, entrees and sides. We shared everything: just right for two with drinks. Seasoned well, constructed flavors and textures, presentation beautiful, the culinary experience is truly great. I'm a beer guy but they have full service bar and wines. The style is relaxed, perfect for those casual moments to grab a bite to eat on the fly. Expect it to be crowded, it is popular and the food is great.A good value for your dollar but not cheap eats.

We ate on the second floor, which was just as crammed as the first. Too many people milling around the bar area and the tables are situated crushed along the walls. Interesting... I haven't really been in such a setting before (for a pricey restaurant). The tables are small and you have to sit on a stool... again adding to that cramped feeling. So as you can sum up so far, the decor was not to my liking but these reviews are more about the food. Finally food time! For starters, we selected the Prosciutto & Ricotta Tart with Marjoram and the Crispy Pig's Ear. I was intrigued by the latter and both were simply delicious. Piglet's ear was like crunch salty bacon. Yum! Oh yet another reason why I can never truly become a vegetarian. For our main courses we had the venison (a special that day) and the Sautéed Quail with Roasted Treviso & Parmesan.  The venison was a little too rare for my liking but paired with the sauce and my wine, it all went down well. The quail was also a little heavy on the sauce. It was however cooked very well and the meat was juicy.  And because I am a french fry-a-holic, I had to have the shoe string fries. Bingo! Grease + salt + rosemary = a winner. For dessert we split a slice of ginger cake which was a my bf predicted, more like a gingerbread cookie. It was super moist and delicious so I had no complaints.Overall we thought the starters (called 'plates' on the menu) were the clear winners. The portions were generous (compared to the entrees) and we probably should have just ordered 4 plates instead.  The atmosphere was nice but too noisy. We agreed that we've had better food for the price but it's definitely worth trying at least once. Expect to spend between $100-200 for two. Perhaps after I visit another gastropub I can revise my feelings about the atmosphere. But for now, I'll let the food own this rating :)",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Not really that big of a deal considered I was with old friends and we had so much to talk about.Once we were seated, life was good. We were a party of three and we were seated next to a party of six. That is worth mentioning because my table ordered two medium well burgers. The table next to us ordered six medium rare burgers. About 40 minutes later the bus boy brought two medium well burger to the party of six. Two of the girls seated at that table said: "" we did not order medium well, but we will take them."" Thirty mins later, we did not have our burgers and one of my friends asked if there was a chance that they received our burgers. The waitress was so rude about it and said something like that would never happen.I disagree. About ten minutes later, six medium rare burgers were delivered to the table of six.

And it took them another 45 minutes to serve your order. My friend and I ordered deviled egg, chargrilled burger and crispy pig ear salad to share. Deviled egg is just a boiled egg with egg yolk blended in mayo and sprinkled parsley. It tastes nothing surprising as what most people said. Plus $4 for an ordinary boiled egg is just way overrated. Then the chargrilled burger tastes bland. My dad can make a better burger than them. Lastly, crispy pig's ear salad is way too sour. They must forgot and pour too much lemon/vinaigrette dressing. Also they literally served us a whole piece (uncut) pig's ear. WARNING: cutting that pig's ear is tough! Totally ruined our appetite.

I had the burger and my friend had the cubano.  The first hint that it wouldn't be great was when I asked for some mayo for my burger.  The waitress told me sorry they can't give me any mayo because they don't want to serve jarred mayo and it's too much trouble to give people the home made stuff.  It wasn't that they didn't HAVE mayo, it just wasn't included in my *$17* burger.  Not even a dollop.  Well, it did come with one of our apps so I ended up having to save it on the dirty dish, guarding it till I got my entree. This could have been forgiven if the burger was TDF but sadly no.  It came with a scoop of blue cheese on top and that really pushed the salt limit over the top, even after I removed some of it.  The shoestring fries didn't add anything. A lot of texture but not much flavor unless you count the rosemary they toss in with the fries.  Oh but they did serve STORE BOUGHT ketchup with the fries (and not even Hunt's--it was Heinz)I honestly think the shakeshack burgers are better and even their frozen fries are more satisfying.  The cubano was very very good.  Dessert was not memorable.  I may come back and try some dinner to see what the fuss is about.  The total bill for the lunch came to  about $90 incl tip no alcohol. If this was a neighborhood place I would have been satisfied, but it was friggin hard to find, highly touted and pricey to boot so it should have been better.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Despite the porcine title, the menu has a fair few veggie options and rediscovered classics on their relatively small menu. We went for 70's dinner party staple Devils on Horseback (Unami packed prunes wrapped in moreish salty proscutio ham). Following that, our first night in New York had to be celebrated with a burger, it's not cheap at $17 but came packed with flavour, fighting (not entirely successfully) with an unannounced blue cheese topping. Served in a grilled brioche bun it comes with an enormous side of shoestring fries, catwalk model thin and cut with rosemary and garlic, fried into chewy golden coins.

The bread was warm, the chicken liver was chunky, in a good way. The deviled eggs were just ok. It had some vinegar on top of it which in my opinion ruined the dish.  The devils on horse backs were not my thing, they were too sweet, but my husband liked them.. The ricotta gnudi were really good.. really good.. with every bite, I was loving them even more. Now, to the best part of the meal..the Burger...The burger was unbelievable.. I love Minetta Tavern's burger, but I have to say that Spotted Pig's burger was even better. They both get their meat from Pat La Frieda, the meat  supplier and his meat is the best..The Minetta Tavern's burger has caramelized onions on top of the meat and as much as i love them, I think they mask the taste of the meat a little.. Spotted Pig's burger has meat and blue cheese on a nicely toasted bun.. The taste of the meat accompanied by the saltines of the cheese was really, really delicious..

Yes.  But at the end of the day, it's just a burger.  It doesn't show the inventiveness and balance of the best of the best.  Put shoestring fries (already not my favorite) on the side and topped with rosemary - I'm lost.  Not a rosemary fan.  Certainly not on fries.  Summary: it's good - even above average.  It's just not great.  A last footnote on the Spotted Pig is the places nearby to drink after.",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

We met an older English couple at the bar and they said it's their favorite pub in NYC and perhaps in the entire world! My friend and I sat at the window perch for dinner. I had the veggie platter which was the most unique preparation of veggies I've ever had. They were lightly fried (with no breading) and still retained the veggie consistency so that I could tell what each vegetable was. Included Minty Potatoes, Roasted Beets & Greens, Braised Peas & Escarole, Flowering Rabe with Crispy Shallots. My friend had the famous burger and shoestring fries. Yes, the burger is good, the ""gamey"" flavor that one yelper mentioned must have been the blue cheese (the meat is not lamb). The shoestring fries are prepared very similar to the veggies in my platter (crispy since they were so thin, yet you could still taste the potato on the inside).

DH had a beer and iced tea, and I had two rum and cokes.In total we spent about $100 on dinner.The waitress was very nice in finding out what nuts were on my plate and giving me the Spanish name when I told her I wanted to write about my meal in my food blog :)",The Spotted Pig,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Burgers,, Gastropubs"

Now let's get down to all the other nonsense.  The burger was beyond mediocre and covered in salt. Basically everything was covered in salt. The burger, the fries, the pork belly, the bean purée, the chard, the potatoes appetizer. Every last one was soaked with salt. There were four of us eatting and no one could even finish or get 1/2 way through their meal because of the salt. The burgers were supposed to be cooked medium and they were basically raw. My stomach is still upset at me for that and I only had two bites. I will NEVER go back nor recommend this giant salt cellar. At least they took two of the four entrees off the bill. I never complain nor ask for things to be taken off my bill. But this meal was so repulsive that they needed to know how bad it was. They also offered a free dessert but we declined.

I salute the creativity of the dishes, where else can you have that? plus how funny is the word Flageolet? the Chargrilled Burger with Roquefort Cheese & Shoestrings was amazing, please try this it had a lot of flavor to it. The burger was enough to make you punch the person sitting next to you! simply for the target practice! But what really took the place beyond the top was the pork belly. It was filled with so much flavor from the moment it hit your tongue to the moment it hit your stomach. This place is very amusing only because everyone who works there looks like they just hopped out of a Fall out Boy video. I had to check my iphone google maps just to reaffirm that I wasn't in Williamsburg (shouts out the the Burg by the way lol). The entire staff consists of hipsters in skinny jeans and baggy plaid shirts with old beat up converse chuck Taylor's  that look like they ran 80 miles through a desert with the roughest sand wearing them. However, unlike your average hipster these ones are actually very approachable and polite. Everyone here was very friendly, the service wasn't too ""in your face"" but you always felt as though someone was right there when needed them. It was too funny to see hipsters with jobs (unlike the political revolutionary/ social trend hating/ between work artist types) a real blue collar hipster! isn't that an oxymoron? The stools here sucked though, it hurt my back to sit there for long periods of time.
