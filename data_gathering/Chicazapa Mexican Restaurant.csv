1,FYFmHgtLBe-FSiTnarITEg,Kelle C.,4.0 star rating,"Super cute local restaurant with fresh, delicious food and friendly service. and it's BYOB! Ya'll know I love a good BYOB. Walked past here many times but hadn't stopped in until fellow Yelper Blossom scoped it out and came to UC for dinner. If only i'd known I would have been a regular long ago. The guac was fresh and I appreciate that they asked mild or spicy. Everyone's entrees were generous and well seasoned.  Just writing this review is making my mouth water. I guess I know what's for dinner tonight!",Chicazapa Mexican Restaurant,4.5 star rating,,Mexican

They start you off with chips and two types of salsa(red & green) both are really good. Their guacamole is delicious and you can get it mild or spicy. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and my boyfriend ordered the steak chimichanga, which he enjoyed.The food is always really good.",Chicazapa Mexican Restaurant,4.5 star rating,,Mexican
3,4q9qt-PdEGYoOkjdgbz4Lw,John M.,5.0 star rating,"Best Mexican around. For appetizers my wife had the sopes and I had the Oaxaqueños tamales. Both were cooked perfectly and the flavors nicely balanced. My wife had a carnitas dish for her main course that was a mix of seasonings and pineapple. The pork shoulder was a little dry for my tastes, but it was not bad. I had the steak norteños which was absolutely delicious. The meat was tender and nicely seasoned. The sides of refried beans were the best ever. At most Mexican restaurants, the refried beans are an afterthought and often have the consistency of wall paste. These were creamy and not all overseasoned. Nor were the smothered in cheese or cream.Dinner for two with appetizers and dessert will cost about $30 per person before tip. The restaurant in BYOB and there is a liquor store a block away if you did not bring your own bottle.",Chicazapa Mexican Restaurant,4.5 star rating,,Mexican

Everything seemed really fresh and they say it's all home made. Presentation was really good even for takeout you could tell it was important. We even got chips and salsa while we waited for our food.",Chicazapa Mexican Restaurant,4.5 star rating,,Mexican
