In walking distance & being Colombian myself I thought this Noches would be a great addition to the heights area, but it has completely disappointed me to the point of no return. I have had a couple of semi bad experiences in the past which I do understand it being relatively new, but this last visit has driven me to this. My mother, cousin and I went for breakfast around 11am when the morning crowd was pretty much gone & were very excited for some Colombian breakfast. To begin with my mother never even received her meal. The waitress failed to put the order in as we saw on the receipt & never came around to ask if we had gotten everything okay. If it only ended there. My cousin's arepa (Colombian corn cake) was cold with just a slab of cold cheese on top. (Side note: on the menu it is shown as shredded cheese melted on NOT the case here lol) She asked the waitress to warm it up for her & she brought it back 15 mins later completely burned, basically inedible. The cheese didn't even really melt, but that's another topic in it of itself. The waitress did not seem to care what so ever either, making the matter worse. My breakfast was barely mediocre, but it at least everything made it on the plate. I have never been in an establishment with no suture and absolutely no customer service. I can with great certainty say I will never be going back. I will not recommend it to anyone. The heights area is definitely up & coming, with plenty of other location to eat.

This is mot only for the restaurant but for the PR and management Went in to get late dinner to go. Once the order was placed so I sat in one of the tables waiting for my order, shortly my name was called so I approached the counter, got my order and started to walk out, some servers started to yell out loud my name stating that I was leaving without paying   I knew I paid and even gave a $5 tip to the server so I went back to the counter and told them that my order was paid for and none of them knew about it until the one that took the order came forward and cleared all up so I decided to walk out again. Shortly after I realized that my order was completely wrong so as upset as I was, I went back and told them and to my surprise, some servers were laughing at the situation which at this point i used my better judgement and kept calm. I called the management of the restaurant which they declined or ignored my request for a phone call only asking for an email.

Picture this: Sunday morning, not a cloud in the sky, slightly hungover from the evening prior.  Buenos Dias? No. Buenos Noches de Colombia.  It's great to have this new addition to the south end of the Ave. Central location, view of the park, plenty of seating. We were excited to now have a Noches of our very own, a short walk from home.  Since this place lit-rally just opened, I'm going to give them a break.  They will probably take a little time to find their groove.  They serve up a full menu of Colombian comfort foods that should not disappoint. It's too bad that today it seemed they were below the bar. To be specific, the pan de Bono is a must ! Claro que si. Peroooo, they came out cold, even after we asked for them to be heated up.  The coffee- very good, but when we ask for oscuro, trae oscuro! We wanted to enjoy our meals together, but we had to wait 10 minutes for one of our meals (arepa con queso y juevos) and the arepa wasn't fully cooked. Not the crunch we were expecting.  The only thing above average was the price point.  Highlights- the coffee was very good, deliciously fresh batido de mora served in cute mason jars, fresh flounder - this hit the spot.  Tostones with that magic green picante sauce was perfect.  Very clean, nice touches with flowers at each table.  We welcome you to the neighborhood, Noches!",Noches De Colombia,3.0 star rating,$$,"Colombian,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I get that this place just opened and they're bound to have kinks they have to work out but I've been here about three times so far and two times I was kind of disappointed. First time I came here for lunch at noon and they ran out of rice. RAN OUT OF RICE!???? Is this not a Colombian establishment where more than 75% of the menu includes rice??? Second time I came for breakfast and all was good. Third time they managed to still have rice (yay!) but the quantity of the food was scarce. My normal go to lunch at any noches is their lunch special with carne asada. Normally everywhere you go they are super generous with portions. But at this location it actually looked like maybe they were running out of carne asada and they had to portion it out in order to get through their day. Overall though is still come back.

My family and I have been dining at this restaurant since the store opened. The food is amazing, don't get me wrong but the customer service is mediocre. I understand the area is predominantly a Spanish neighborhood, but there needs to be someone controlling the register and answering the phones that is bilingual. I placed an order over the phone last with a woman that became annoyed because I didn't understand Spanish. She hung up on me. I called back 6 times to no answer. I am aware that repeating customers' information is saved in the system so called a 7th time from a private number and she answered on the 1st ring. I became infuriated and another woman who spoke a little English came to the phone and told me I needed ""to calm the fuck down if I wanted my order."" That is where I should have parted ways but it was late on a Sunday night and nothing else was open. I was starving after a full day of work. So I somehow managed to get thru the conversation providing my credit card number and made clear I wanted for delivery. 1 hr later I called to see where my food was and the woman told me it's been at the counter waiting for me to pick because she didn't know I wanted delivery. I live literally next door from the restaurant and I could have gone to pick up but I was disgusted with their lack of customer service that I wanted an extra 20 minutes for it my cold steak and  shrimp over a bed of soggy lettuce and black avocado to arrive. The manager called me this morning to understand what happened, but guess what... doesn't speak English and got frustrated me, placing me on a never ending hold over the phone.

66,aE50NPSvg9ThR_8Kktr2tw,Ayana A.,1.0 star rating,"Unfortunately I received an inedible order and follow-up fell short. A couples nights ago I ordered delivery through their online ordering service. I ordered pandebono, arepita con chicharron y chorizo, and yuca frita. The order was estimated for 30 mins, but came closer to 45 mins. Once I got the order and opened it up, I noticed that the yuca fritas were overcooked and hard to bite into -- honestly, they looked like leftovers pulled together, refried and packed up for me. And the arepita was burnt, appeared to have two slices of white american cheese melted on it and the chicharron and chorizo were overcooked and hard. Another inedible item. The pandebono was perfect, so that constituted my dinner at the least. Within 10 minutes of receiving and reviewing my order I called the restaurant. This was done before 10pm. No answer after two attempts. I made sure to leave feedback from the survey I received through email after placing my order online. The next day I received a 10% discount since I rated the food poorly. But I wanted a refund. I called the Jersey City restaurant explaining what happened the night before. After discussing the issue with several folks (staff and managers) we agreed that I could order again with a credit for the two items. Later that day I called to place my order - this time trying for the sample appetizer plate. During the call it seems like everything was good to go. I expected my order to arrive within 45 minutes...but it never showed up. I actually forgot it was even coming until my husband pointed it out. I called the restaurant at about 8:30pm. The line had a busy signal. I tried again with no luck. I'm frustrated at this point and have finally thrown my hands up in the air. I will not be order from this restaurant again. I was really looking forward to adding this spot among the other great JC Heights restaurants we frequent. The dining room looks comfortable and the prices are reasonable. But this place needs to get it together both on food prep, management and follow-up on issues. There's no reason why my food was never delivered...It's not like this is the first time operating a restaurant for this brand; they have quite a few locations operating.

77,N4f9gj-ttoO7yTvkPZmvjA,V R.,1.0 star rating,"First of all, I wanted to share as much detail of the horrible experience I encountered here as possible.  I hope this review helps this place get their stuff together so that other diners can have a more positive experience then the one that me and the other guests had for two nights in a row.  After reading this review, I hope you can understand why will not be returning.Today we decided to return to this place in the hopes of a more positive second experience.  This place is just recently open, and we really wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt, but unfortunately that just didn't happen.  The previous night, there was an awful experience with dishes being brought out late.  There was a party of a few people that dined, and each dish was brought out at different times and served cold.  Management seemed sincerely apologetic and so we decided to return to see if we had a better experience today.Upon arrival we were recognized by staff, so we were slightly optimistic about todays dining experience.  Surely, after the fiasco on the previous night, they would make sure our dining experience was going to be pleasant.  Unfortunately, we were optimistic, because, todays experience was the WORST I have ever encountered in my years of dining out, and I not only feel disappointed, but highly offended and insulted and will never again dine at any Noches de Colombia. First, let me start by saying that we had to wait to get a menu.  They explained that they had a shortage of menus and so we patiently waited for some to appear.  After finally getting the menus, the servers would go around the tables taking and asking for the menus back to give to other diners. How rude!  We felt as if we had to rush to look through, and after putting two on the table and having them taken away, we literally had to hold on the the remaining menus, so that we could order.We started with ordering our appetizers.  I am going to hold my opinion on that, as each person has different expectations on food.  For me the empanadas were nothing to write home about. However, that wasn't what was frustrating.  What really aggravated me was the continuous amounts of time we had to ask our server for some mayo ketchup and hot sauce so that we could enjoy our appetizer, which went on deaf ears.   I lost track of how many times we asked, until we came to the conclusion, that we were just not going to be able to enjoy any sauce with the appetizer. Next, we finally decided to order our meals.  My husband asked for beans as a side dish and was specifically told... THERE WAS NO BEANS. So thank goodness we held on the remaining menu for dear life, he was able to change his meal to something else and ordered yucca as a side. Everyone else put there order and it was made specifically clear to the waiter that we expected each dish to come out hot and at the same time for all of us.   After a short while, a fellow walks up to our table, apologizing about there not being any yucca, and THAT SUDDENLY, THERE WERE BEANS AVAILABLE.  Well, my husband changed his order back to what he originally wanted so that he could enjoy his side of beans with his meal. After our food was served, you would had expected each order as we requested to be served at the same time.  Well, this was not the case.  One of the orders was missing, which we had to wait for after being reassured this would not be the case.After noticing our frustration, the staff was once again apologetic and asked for our understanding, and we were nice about it, because we felt once again they really were sincere and were just having a hard time adjusting being that they recently opened.  We went on to order some dessert...tres leche, which again in my opinion, was not to my liking as it was dry.  After this, we just decided to ask for our check, because we were pretty much done with this experience and thats when NOCHES DE COLOMBIA LOST MY BUSINESS AND ANY FUTURE REFERRALS FOR LIFE.  Can you believe, that they charged us a 15% gratuity.  When we asked why this gratuity was charged, they explained it was their policy for any meals over $100... well honestly, our meal was under $100, and the audacity to impose this charge and tell us it was policy and blame the entire Corporation of Noches de Colombia for imposing this policy, and then this policy as explained was not even applicable to us, was over the top insulting.   The check was paid along with the enforced gratuity, which I hope they enjoy thoroughly.  We will never return there or to any place with the Noches de Colombia name.   By the way you can thank Alex from the new location in Jersey City, who threw the name Noches de Colombia under the bus, as he stated, he just works there, thats corporates rules.
