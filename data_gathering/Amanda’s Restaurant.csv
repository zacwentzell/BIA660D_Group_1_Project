1,JP5DEwtdpo99FaEP1icCdg,Kartik K.,4.0 star rating,I was at Amanda's for a Sunday brunch a few weeks back with a friend. Although the interiors were a little antiquated do not let that fool you. The brunch was solid. I got a salmon and spinach eggs Benedict which was on point. We shared a bread basket which was amazing - super fresh the only complain I might have is that we had too many of the corn muffins. I got a Hennessy based specialty coffee which was a bummer. Maybe that was just not my drink.All in all it was a solid brunch and I would rate it a 4.5 but since a girl named Amanda cancelled our first date last minute I'd take half a star off that rating.,Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"
2,TFmzpW06U2O5quynnwMrGA,Jack W.,5.0 star rating,"Never judge a restaurant by its exterior! I've passed Amanda's many times, but never looked beyond the simple exterior. Shame on me! From the moment you open the door, you are transported to an elegantly appointed interior that is reminiscent of a 19th Century parlor. The warm tones and stately decor really set the tone for what was a delightfully elegant meal. We were seated in a quiet table by the window, where I spent the evening jealous of my friend's seat, facing the restaurant. When the dining room is that pretty, passers-by just don't measure up.       I started with an Apricot-Sage Bumbler - a cocktail of theirs made with Bacardi Silver, apricots, honey, lemon, and sage. Served in a delicate cocktail glass and garnished with a fresh sage leaf, the bright yellow libation made me feel I was in a prohibition era speakeasy. I don't usually prefer rum, but the apricot and honey drew me in and made for a delicious cocktail combination.     Ordering from their three course, Hudson Restaurant Week prix fixe menu, I started with the steak tartare. Served with a quail egg, chili tempura, and shoestring potatoes, the meat was perfectly seasoned, and almost creamy in texture. The quail egg enhanced the creaminess, and the chili tempura added a welcomed bit of heat. Excellent idea adding the shoestring potatoes, as they provided wonderful crispness.     My meal continued with a Flintstones sized pork chop that could not have been cooked more perfectly. A lightly charred crust on the outside, and the juiciest, barely pink inside. The sweet potatoes and arugula lent a delightful sweetness and hardiness to the dish, as did the maple pearl onions. Ask for extra bread because you will want to sop up the veal jus the chop is floating on.      As I always say, food goes to your stomach, but dessert goes to your heart. The bombolini (donuts) were TO LIVE FOR!!! Freshly fried and rolled in cinnamon sugar, these sweet orbs of dough are a sweet tooth's fantasy. As light and airy as a cloud, but with enough flavor to make you eat 5 orders. The huckleberry sauce was superfluous for me, but only because the bombolini were so good on their own. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the salted caramel ice cream wasn't the best salted caramel ice cream I'd had. You could actually taste the salt AND the caramel. Had I been in the privacy of my own home, I'd have liked the bowl.      The service is wonderfully attentive but not remotely intrusive. In a word, Amanda's is elegant, through and through.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

It was definitely a nice restaurant, but I honestly didn't think it was anything special. The decor was a little weird - it's definitely unique but the pictures around the restaurant were just a bit strange for me. I felt like I was in someone's house, which was... interesting. The restaurant is also much larger than I expected - there's a few small rooms, so you can never quite get a sense of how big it is. However, we sat down right away, despite it being packed when we first walked in, which was nice.The food was definitely good - we all got the Tomato, Basil and Ricotta Omelette.

I was pleasantly surprised to find no chavvy Jersey bros here, thankfully.  It was just a nice overall experience that was cheaper than I expected.The Food:The eggs benedict over crabmeat was a fantastic idea.  50 points for Gryffindor!  The crabmeat was perfection.  Totally not the overly chewy crabcake you get at some places.  The bellini was not as sweet as what you get at some places and it hit just the right spot.The Atmosphere:This place had a Victorian feel to it which may be what's deterring the fist-pumping chavs (yes, I know I'm using Britspeak but I want to be all encompassing when speaking about trash).  The atmosphere was what made this place quite enjoyable.  It was quiet enough so that I could comfortably catch up with my friend.The Service:Lightning fast.  The drinks and food came out without much of a wait.  The waiter was very polite and left us alone to chit chat whilst I did not see the bottom of my water glass.  Gotta love the places where you get service without even noticing.Also, my friend drove me back into Manhattan so I didn't have to deal with that godforsaken path train.  Not really a service of the restaurant but made the experience much more enjoyable.  Til next year!",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"
6,LcWOq7p7Mhtv9hIlDrhy9A,Mel T.,3.0 star rating,"So I finally tried Amanda's for brunch, and I think I'll be sticking to the Truffle Fusilli that I mentioned in my last review.My boyfriend and I came in on a Saturday with a 12:30 reservation. The place was pretty empty except for about two tables, and two separate parties going on in the back. We happened to be seated in the dining room that was right smack in the middle of the two parties, which made no sense - especially since the front dining room was empty. Naturally, it was very noisy but not the worst. We could have asked to move but we didn't. Luckily, the two parties didn't take away from their service because we got our food within 10 minutes of ordering, so we were in and out within 45 minutes.For drinks, he had the bloody mary (not good, very bitter) and I had the bellini (basic). Both were pretty expensive for brunch drinks ($8), for no reason but I get it - you're paying for the ambiance. It's not like we wanted to spend our brunch hour with a bunch of frat guys at a bar, pounding $3 Miller Lites anyway.For food, I had the Crispy Eggs (with asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, prosciutto and parmesan fonduta). The crispy eggs were interesting. It was like a scotch egg but without the sausage. It wasn't bad but it is a bit heavy for brunch, especially with the cheese fonduta. The side salad it was served with helped that out a little. I also wish there was more prosciutto. He had the Grilled Hangar Steak with Eggs. This came with some fruit and home fries. The steak was pretty good but you should order it one level rarer than how you would normally order it.Overall, I don't think brunch was anything amazing.

I recently went here with my parents and we are all still thinking about our meal days later.Atmosphere: They play a relaxing playlist with a variety of music from samba to country to jazz. The decor makes you feel like you are in someone's home, and each room is unique. Our server was very upbeat and charming.Appetizers: The polenta held its shaped opposed to being a mushy bowl. It was covered in cream and a bit of pesto. Delicious. The fresh spinach salad had just enough vinaigrette which was tasty and light, without being soggy or dry. The almonds were slivered and lightly toasted and it also had fresh strawberries. The perfect summer appetizer. Everything seemed so fresh.Meals: We had the sirloin steak. We asked for medium rare and it came out as medium. We didn't send it back because it was still delicious. On the side were potatoes au gratin wth bleu cheese and grilled veggies.Then came the duck confit, which my mother described as the best lamb she has ever had! It just fell off the bone and came with mashed potatoes and an excellent gravy.Dessert: I have never liked key lime pie until I tried this one! It was unbelievably creamy. We also had he apple tart which was so-so.Overall just a phenomenal restaurant to take your parents or older relatives, or a date night. Not a good place for children.Also, we went on a Sunday night. It was not crowded at all, but on Sundays, they do not offer the early bird prefix menu which was a bummer. My first time there (an equally wonderful experience) was a Saturday night and it was very very busy. We were seated in the basement which still has a charming room, and you can pass their wine cellar on the way.

I can't fathom how anyone would ever give this place a bad review. It's one of those places where as soon as you take a bite of their food you are thrown into some sort of euphoric food heaven where your taste buds just had a cigarette after food sex (and I am not a smoker). And it's like no matter what we order the food is good. The place is a bit pricey which is why we only come for special occasions but it is worth every penny. I hope this place never changes and always stays right where it is.

Service just as professional an impeccable as the last visit and the food was again completely delicious.Ordered the crab cake benedict which I've had at other places and it's always pretty heavy. Amanda's does it without the English muffin which makes the dish a lot lighter and you can actually really taste the freshness of the crab in each bite. Perfect amount of food on the plate, and their awesome mimosa was a great accompaniment.Also got the roasted potatoes this time instead of shoestring potatoes which, in my opinion, was a much better choice.

I recently went here with my parents and we are all still thinking about our meal days later.Atmosphere: They play a relaxing playlist with a variety of music from samba to country to jazz. The decor makes you feel like you are in someone's home, and each room is unique. Our server was very upbeat and charming.Appetizers: The polenta held its shaped opposed to being a mushy bowl. It was covered in cream and a bit of pesto. Delicious. The fresh spinach salad had just enough vinaigrette which was tasty and light, without being soggy or dry. The almonds were slivered and lightly toasted and it also had fresh strawberries. The perfect summer appetizer. Everything seemed so fresh.Meals: We had the sirloin steak. We asked for medium rare and it came out as medium. We didn't send it back because it was still delicious. On the side were potatoes au gratin wth bleu cheese and grilled veggies.Then came the duck confit, which my mother described as the best lamb she has ever had! It just fell off the bone and came with mashed potatoes and an excellent gravy.Dessert: I have never liked key lime pie until I tried this one! It was unbelievably creamy. We also had he apple tart which was so-so.Overall just a phenomenal restaurant to take your parents or older relatives, or a date night. Not a good place for children.Also, we went on a Sunday night. It was not crowded at all, but on Sundays, they do not offer the early bird prefix menu which was a bummer. My first time there (an equally wonderful experience) was a Saturday night and it was very very busy. We were seated in the basement which still has a charming room, and you can pass their wine cellar on the way.

In sum: everything was absolutely perfect, from planning through execution. The Reserve room downstairs, where we held our dinner, was just beautiful and so special. Our guests loved the paintings of Hoboken and its history on the walls, I think many of these were painted by Juan, the owner. How cool! It was a very private setting and perfect for a few emotional speeches and toasts, away from other guests. The food was absolutely delicious, every single person around the table had a clean plate after each course. The service was impeccable. Dishes were well timed, glasses were always kept full. I can't say enough about how wonderful the evening turned out, but I would be remiss to not applaud the planning process leading up to the event as well. Each step of the planning process and every single communication I had with the Amanda's team was incredibly helpful, productive and positive. They were willing to accommodate our crazy dietary restrictions (2 vegans! 1 gluten free! 1 allergic to dairy!), last minute changes in attendees and overall made it so easy (and so fun!) to plan the dinner. They even worked with us to provide a personalized menu, with our names and the wedding date. A fun memento from the evening! We will never forget this very special evening shared with our family and best friends.

Well,finally, a friend of mine, a fellow yelper made it happen.The early dinner menu seemed like an excellent option both for the variety and for its affordability.The drinks were strong and  incredibly well made,my first sip of their Glenfiddich proving to me that this was one of my better decisions.The curried carrot soup starter blew me away.How is it possible that carrots can taste this good?I slurped down every bit of goodness and swore to myself to look up a decent recipe and make this at home.For the second course,I chose roasted chicken and switched out the sides and sauce which had pork in them for some mashed potatoes and veal sauce(it tasted like bordelaise). The chicken was incredibly good though a tad tougher than I would have liked it to be. I tasted my friend's orecchiette pasta with roasted red peppers which was again, a really well composed dish. It was not overly creamy like the usual run-of-the-mill pasta dishes. We finished our meal with the chocolate panna cotta and the vanilla whipped ricotta dessert.Both of these were excellent,especially the panna cotta,the tart cherries adding another dimension to the sweet chocolate.The ricotta dessert was way less sweeter than we expected it to be which was a pleasant surprise.The service throughout was quite attentive and the whole atmosphere was classy.I loved the fact that they were accommodating enough to switch out sides from their prix fixe menu and cater according to our preference.It definitely seems to be a nice quiet dinner type of place and I am looking forward to come back with my SO.

49,XZIAEE2ZN6yxESKzXiZRqQ,Auggie L.,5.0 star rating,"Went for Hudson Restaurant Week DinnerFood - 5/5.  Their restaurant week menu had items that are unique to it compared to their regular menu but they were so good they should be a daily item! The beef tartar was delicious making a great combination with the tart pickled shallots and crispy crostini. The Curry Braised Short Ribs were absolutely amazing. The meat is so tender you do not need a knife at all and the curry adds a hint of smokey flavor to the rich beef braise jus that is so delicious it'll even make the microgreen garnish taste good with the sauce. The carrots have a nice roasted flavor and the fingerlings have great crispy crusts. The Warm Chocolate Cake is moist with the salted caramel adding that hint of saltiness to enhance the entire flavor of the dessert.Service - 5/5. Amanda's truly takes classic French service seriously. There are show plates which are removed upon menu order, the bread is served individually by the waitstaff onto the bread plates, silverware is replaced after a single use, water refills are always done without asking, tables are wiped of food scraps every course and the meals are served and cleared at the same time. I was pleasantly surprised at the last part, as most restaurants tend to clear plates as they are finished but Amanda's staff waited till all diners were done before clearing. The restaurant is very high end so I'm glad their service level is up there as well.Value - 4/5. The Hudson Restaurant Week prices are fairly high compared to the competitions in the area, but I would give high marks to Amanda's as the food and service quality fit the prices they charge. Comparatively, the restaurant week prices are a great bargain to try many items when compared to their regular menu and the portion sizes aren't any smaller for the prix-fixe compared to their regular menu items.

For the deal, you have to make a reservation for either 5pm or 530pm on Mondays to Saturdays. You have to place your order in by 545pm and be done with your meal by 7pm. For this deal, you get a 3 course dinner for the ridiculously amazing price of $19 per person. They also offer an early bird bottle special to go with your meal for $25. They have a really good pinot noir that you can get for the $25 special. I always get the creamy polenta as my appetizer. It's so decadent and rich and I think I can eat an entree size of it easily and call it a day. For the entree selection, I've had the steak, which can be a little dry and mundane in comparison to the other choices. The pan roasted sea bass with cannelini bean salad is out of this world. They recently added a chicken pot pie to the menu and it is rosemary laden hearty goodness. The desserts are also top notch. I'm a huge fan of their silky chocolate panna cota,  topped with drunken cherries.The wait service here is fabulous.

For a special GNO, my friend and I went here for dinner last Friday and had a fantastic time.Yes, can't say enough about the courteous and efficient staff. Everyone was warm, friendly and quietly doing their job without being too rushed or slow - a perfect art. Water glasses were never empty and food was paced just right.We started off with two apps - the crab cake and the beet salad. Both were delicious. The crab cake was creamy, had a rich texture and was melt in the mouth flavorful. The beet salad was sweet and savory and had a sprinkling of goat cheese. Love at every bite.For the mains we both opted for the only pasta dish on the menu - Truffle Tagliolini with a mushroom reduction. Now this was a HUGE mountain of pasta - enough for three people at least.Taken aback with the portion size, we both dug in and did our best to make a dent! The pasta was a mix of a rich cream sauce and a generous helping of the roasted woodland mushrooms - a bit too rich for my taste, and I enjoyed the apps more. For desert we got the pineapple upside down cake with vanilla ice cream which was simply outstanding. Get it. Our waitress warned us it was too small to share, but IMHO it was just right to be shared between two people after a heavy dinner. Why did I dock one star? Because they have only one vegetarian dish on the menu! Even the soup of the day (spring vegetable) was cooked in a chicken broth.

For my entree I had the Truffle Fusilli Pasta which was very flavorful. At the end of the meal, the staff sang happy birthday to me and presented me with a small dessert which was very kind. Loved this place and will definitely return next time I'm in Hoboken.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

For $19, a three course meal--appetizer, main course and dessert. Very pleasant atmosphere. Good service. Tonight, we are having polenta for appetizer. A rich, creamy polenta with mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes on top. The salad is fine--nothing spectacular. For dinner, sea bass and chicken pot pie. Our server, Valentina, highly recommended the pot pie and she was spot on. The pot pie was amazing. The crust was flaky and delicate. Inside was a succulent blend of well seasoned chicken, carrots, peas and potatoes. The sea bass was very good--crispy skin, perfectly cooked. Now for dessert. Apple strudel and chocolate panacotta. The apple strudel had a delicate crust, lots of apples and tiny scoop of vanilla ice cream. The panacotta was rich and creamy and perfect for dark chocolate lovers. Drunken cherries on top and some berries on the side. With one glass of wine (shared), the total came to less than $50 plus tip.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

To describe it in a few words: Not too pricey in my opinion (~$60 for two working college students) that got us Mimosas, an entree, and a desert to share. It seemed like a perfect place for a group of friends, families, or people who are dating to get brunch to.First, the decor made me think I was dining in someone's fancy house. But, let me get to the actual food experience.My friend and I ended up getting Mimosas and it all started going downhill (in an awesome way) from there.  I ended up getting the ""Eggs in Purgatory."" This dish really lived up to its expectations. I was amazed at how they kept the egg intact as I cut into my knife with it. In addition, the bread was a perfect addition as I literally turned the dish into a flatbread to be eaten with the sauce.For desert, we got the berry and brown butter tart: amazing. The warmth of the tart and the coldness of the ice cream mixed so well together. To be honest, I must be a sucker for ice cream, because if a restaurant serves good ice cream, I am a happy man.Overall, this place is amazing. It also has free parking (if you park at 12th and Hudson Streets at the Little Man Parking Deck).Food: 5/5Interior: 5/5Overall: 5/5",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"
74,YCXSG43vTQEDQZux-KmwkQ,Kim L.,5.0 star rating,"Goodness, nothing makes me more excited than a good weekend brunch! I had the pleasure of going to Amanda's Restaurant with a friend and what a great experience. As soon as we sat down, we were given menus and a nice warm piece of bread for starters. I ordered the brunch classic staple: eggs Benedict with cured salmon and spinach because I truly believe that eggs Benedict can decide if the restaurant has good brunch and for me to explore other options later.  Boy did they do well on the dish! At Amanda's, they really know how to poach an egg perfectly; a yolk that is still runny but not to the point where you cut it and it bleeds all over your plate but one that moves but still stays near the egg. It even made my friend jealous that I ordered the Benedict while he ordered a separate simpler egg dish (called ""Eggs in Purgatory""). We split the berry and brown butter tart for dessert and I knew this place had brunch down perfectly. I appreciate that you don't have to head over to the city for a great weekend brunch and Amanda's is one of the biggest reasons why. What's more, they offer free parking in crowded ol' Hoboken. Just make sure you park in the correct lot because my friend and I made the mistake of parking in a separate lot that they don't fulfill.

75,sBDg7vLK4aP-srrQ8_unQw,Anna B.,5.0 star rating,"If there's such a thing as casual elegance, Amanda's has it. This beloved Hoboken eatery is located in an old brownstone on Washington Street, and it retains the feel of being in someone's beautifully decorated home. It's cozy and classy at the same time. Then, of course, there's the food. Amanda's is a winner for either dinner or brunch. The dinner menu seems to get changed up from time to time (probably seasonally), but there's always an array of sophisticated but unpretentious entree options, with something that will please most palates. I had the pan roasted salmon and thought it was absolutely delicious. They serve very good rolls with dinner as well and have a solid wine list. I recommend saving room for one of their delicious desserts. As for brunch, you probably can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but I can tell you from experience that the croissant French toast and the crispy eggs are standouts that you won't find at too many other restaurants. Be sure to get a mimosa too - they're pretty strong here! Whatever meal you're coming for, reservations are a must; I've been here a few times and it has always been very busy. The one thing I'd caution about here is that brunch can feel a little bit rushed depending on when you arrive. If your reservation is at peak brunch time, they will probably bring your food quickly and want to turn your table over pretty fast, so it's not necessarily the most relaxing experience. If you're looking for something more leisurely, I recommend coming at the later end of brunch time. We didn't find this to be much of an issue when we came here for dinner. Overall, though, Amanda's is a wonderful choice for brunch with friends, a family celebration, or date night. It's not hard to see why it's become such a mainstay on the Hoboken restaurant scene.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

Tonight, was one of my more disappointing experiences. Our service was average, though the water refills were off the charts. Unfortunately the food was not. Our appetizers were delicious so I thought we were on to something. Then my food arrived. I was in between the Monkfish and the Truffle Tagliolini. Waiter was very emphatic about the Truffle Tagliolini so I ordered it. Unfortunately when it arrived it was comparable to a Knorr pasta side. There were zero pieces of mushrooms and all I could explain as 1 or 2 mushrooms that had been pulverized to a dust and mixed with butter and a piece of greenery to top it off was all that accompanied the pasta, mind you this was $24. I gave it my all but was immediately disappointed. The waiter came over to ask about it since I was not eating and I shared my disappointment. He did offer to get me something else but at that point it was late and I had checked out. Instead of taking my plate, he left it to my side where it sat until everyone else's meals had been cleaned off. I think what made me most upset was when I saw the same dish being delivered after we had wrapped up to another table next to us piled with delicious mushrooms. Serious food envy.

We thought it was small upon entering with a tiny bar and back room, but when I used the restroom I realized it was quite large. It was decorated with library decor and a really nice atmosphere. The menu was pricy for brunch, but worth it. Their rolls to start were fluffy, moist and almost potato flavor. We LOVED THEM. Hubby had a bloody Maria by accident and liked it (he meant to order a Bloody Mary haha ah well!). My sister in law had a Bellini and deemed it amazing. My mother in law had fresh juice and I had the perfect cappuccino. For brunch my husband had the croissant French toast which was the best meal! It was amazing, delicious, fattening and just wonderful. We split bacon (thick, delicious) and sausage for a side. Spot on. My SIL had the crispy egg and devoured it. My mother in law didn't like hers. She had the chicken salad and said the chicken was quite dry. Mine was just okay as well, chorizo and goat cheese omelet. Something was missing (maybe pepper!? Salt? Can't tell) and it had way too much goat cheese. Dessert was more epic cappuccinos and a molten lava cake which was gone in seconds. Their restroom was clean and coat check was quick and easy.

I got the seared monkfish as my entree, which was very good as well. The group of four I was with all enjoyed their meals as well.

127,CNQu4I7qoRCzfA99yLiKhA,Yvette S.,2.0 star rating,"It was Valentine's Day and we wanted to do something different, go somewhere different. And to be honest Valentine's Day can be tricky...you want to do something unique but most importantly you don't want to ""repeat"" restaurants that you've been to - especially with other romantic partners. Touted as a romantic restaurant Jack and I ended up at Amanda's in Hoboken, NJ for Valentine's Day dinner. The one thing about Hoboken is the parking situation so we had a little bit of angst about being able to find nearby parking especially since we were in the middle of a Polar Vortex walking 2 or even 3 blocks seemed unfathomable and daunting. Lucky for me my boyfriend is a gem of a gentleman and he dropped me off in the front of restaurant and found parking a few blocks away.As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a warm ""hug."" The atmosphere is inviting and romantic. I made my way to the host/hostess stand and checked in. The host was jovial. He escorted me through the main dining room which was packed. I really liked the color palette and the décor was an interesting a combination of Hoboken maps and baseball. We were seated in the lower level which was small room of about 10 tables. Cozy. I checked my coat, sat down and perused the prix fix menu while I waited for Jack to walk back from parking the car.As starters Jack ordered the mushroom soup and I ordered the lobster risotto. Jack loved to mushroom soup. The menu did not articulate which type of mushroom but he said ""whatever it is it's good.""  As for the lobster risotto, let's say, I was disappointed. Was there plenty of lobster yes. There was just a rough taste to the risotto. Not as creamy as I had hoped. But it was ok. Not good, not great, just ok.For an entrée Jack ordered the halibut and I ordered the rack of lamb. Jack did not rave about his fish. It looked good but he was not in love with the dish. For the rack of lamb I can tell you that it was abysmal. No seasoning at all. It was if they just threw the meat on an open flame for 4 minutes and then served it. No salt, no nothing. Now what makes matters worse is that my rack of lamb is out of this world so I was also comparing how I make my dish to this one that was served to me on Valentine's Day. Disappointing. The plate looked pretty and was a nice sized portion but the food had no flavor.One would think that we would had our enough with the entrée experience to forgo dessert. But we didn't. We had paid for it as it was included in the price fix. We both ordered the cherry cheesecake which was actually good. Not the best cheesecake that I've had in the world but it was pretty good.So, would I recommend Amanda's? That's a good question. I am going to hold off on recommending people to go until I give it another try. I think there was a lot of pressure on Amanda's to perform on Valentine's Day and unfortunately it wasn't their best showing.

Im so sad i havent been brunching here sooner!!Everything is priced between $11-14 per brunch entree. I chose the crispy eggs with proscuitto since it sounded so unique and the waitress recommended it as well. It was two crispy fried eggs (no idea how they batter them) with sliced proscuitto and a side salad with a light vinagrette. The egg was very rich and heavy so the salad was the perfect refreshing balance on the plate. They had a nice tea selection which was great because i wasnt in the mood for coffee. My boyfriend got one of the omelettes that came with home fried potatoes and fresh fruit. Definitely worth the price!!

130,9LNKSIN49SrT24eZHCYivw,Randi E.,4.0 star rating,"We had been to Amanda's many times before, but this time something felt a little different. There had been a small shift, though not in the service or the quality of ingredients. But it was the menu. Amanda's does a few things very well, each dish may shift with the seasons, but these items are to be anticipated on the menu. But this time, some of these were indeed listed, but with a twist. As always, a polenta starter is featured on the menu, though this time it was tipped with spicy sausage ragu, mache and parmesan. The polenta was creamy and warm, as expected, but the ragu was multifaceted and unfortunately, way cold.The entrees too, were in typical form (starch, veggie, protein), but a little different. The grilled salmon was served with lobster mashed potatoes, flanked by buttery green beans. A slight adjustment to the potatoes resulted in creamy luxury.Similarly, the seabass perched on garlicky sautéed spinach and a quinoa risotto, added creativity. Instead of the classic risotto or even a grain, Amanda's new vision offered an inventive twist.The duck dish, complete with maple-roasted butternut squash, bacon lardons and wilted mustard greens, had sweet, earthy, and salty notes that made everything sparkle.Even dessert brought something uncharacteristic. A banana cake with caramel ice cream felt like bananas fosters on the tongue, a butterscotch pudding layered with cookies and creams in a jar, and the chocolate molten cake, were classic and simple and in some ways, recreated.  Sometimes the key to consistency is a kind of monotony and paucity of innovation. The new turns have created a more exciting experience, while replicating the high standards and quality.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

That's a great benefit, since the flat fee is $25. Basically, that's an entrée.Amanda's is a somewhat intimate restaurant, but you'd still be able to hear everyone's conversations. It was about 9 o'clock on a Saturday, and it wasn't that busy. Not sure if that's an indication of its popularity, or just that it was late. I will say that the main street of Hoboken basically closes down at 11 o'clock, so all these places were pretty empty.The food is definitely the standout here. The butternut squash soup had some heat and (probably) mole somewhere in it. Very delicious. The sea bass I ordered was nice and crispy, but the pickled scallions on top cut down on its crispiness. The pork shank that my partner ordered was delicious. A great portion, and perfectly cooked. It's so easy to overdo pork, but the center was a soft pink. Very good.The drinks were also very original and delicious here. Rye with molasses was a great drink.Service was fine, but our particular server wasn't as knowledgeable as I would have hoped.

From my experiences here, I have come to the conclusion that this is not a restaurant to go to for dinner if you do not eat meat. That being said, for the amount of money you spend, they should be able to cook any kind of seafood on the menu FLAWLESSLY and the QUALITY of it better be top notch.I came here last night for Hudson Restaurant week to treat my grandfather to dinner for his birthday (he's a big foodie). He ordered the Sausage Ragu Polenta, which he enjoyed so much that he practically licked the plate clean! For his entree he ordered the skirt steak with bacon braised kale and again, thoroughly enjoyed it even as someone who HATES kale. For dessert he ordered the Ginger Panna Cotta, which we both shared and it was creamy, light and flavorful. And not too sweet!I did not order from the Restaurant Week menu. I ordered the Mixed Greens Salad ($8) and I was thoroughly surprised at how much I enjoyed the dressing, as well as how large it was. For my entree I ordered the Spicy Seafood Stew with mussels, clam, shrimp and fish in a tomato broth. I have NEVER in my life been served shrimp that were so overcooked. They were tough to chew and swallow. I've gotten better cooked shrimp from a neighboring chinese/japanese food restaurant when I order Shrimp Noodle Soup. The mussels were definitely not P.E.I.'s and the clams were the size of DIMES. All overcooked and served in a tasteless tomato water (no, I will not even call it a broth).I would have sent the whole dish back if I wasn't enjoying the conversation with my grandfather so much to not want to interrupt the mood and the evening.Needless to say, I will never be going back to Amanda's unless it's to treat a meat-eating friend/relative to a tasty meal during Restaurant Week.  And when I do, I will stick with their bread and $8 mixed greens salad for my meal.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

We ordered the steak medium and it came out well done. The over medium eggs came out correctly and were as expected. The atmosphere? Uncomfortably pretentious and fake. The host wouldn't even greet us at the door, but talked to us across the dining room amidst other customers. It's a shame the food did not live up to other reviews or its own pretentious attitude. The service is what saved this place from getting a 1 star review. Our waitress was solid - attentive, courteous, but not overwhelming.

The shortcake in my dessert however, didn't seem fresh; it was rather hard to cut into. Overall it was delicious but I feel, it was also a little over priced.

They serve food on beautiful china of all different styles. The service is excellent - highly knowledgeable friendly and efficient. We went on a Saturday night (a good crowd) with five people and ate the following:- Bread was warm and fresh baked - yum!- Ordered excellent cocktails - the Smoke and Spice and a summer drink with gin and watermellon and my wife got a mocktail. The bartender prided herself on her mocktails and it showed with the fresh blackberry one that was made- They had featured wines for the night and we ordered an excellent New Zealand Pinot Noir reasonably priced at $35- Appetizers were solid - we had the Crab Cake, Beet Salad and Creamy Polenta. The polenta was the stand out with a sausage ragu on top and made perfectly- For mains I had the monkfish and my wife had the sole - they were good but not great. The monkfish was a little over cooked for me and both were a little bland. Other people in our party orders the Spicy Seafood Stew and got it a little extra spicy and LOVED it. I had quite a bit of it and it was addictingly good. The stew was enormous though and probably had a tad too many potatoes in addition to huge shrimps, clams, mussels and sole/salmon/monkfish so come hungry if you order it- We finished off with three deserts - the amazing cheesecake which has both ricotta and cream cheese, the butter popcorn creme de pot which I loved for the salt and savoryness and the light but lovely warm mixed berry tart. The cheese cake is brilliant and enough to share amongst three people. Oh and the coffee here is fantastic. We were stuffed and needed to be rolled out but the experience was absolutely satisfying. This was our first dinner out in Hoboken since moving from Brooklyn and it didn't disappoint.

Loved walking in on a cold night to a room with a small bar and a wood fire burning. It was extremely cozy and welcoming. This place must be a home, converted into restaurant. There are about 4 rooms that make up the entire restaurant, and the basement level which is where the coat check is and where private parties are held. I heard that in the warm weather months, there is a back patio, not sure if seating is available there or not. When you are in Amanda's, it is hard to believe you are Hoboken. This is by far the best service I have received in Hoboken and the best crowd (older, sophisticated). For an appetizer, my boyfriend ordered the polenta and loved it. Fresh bread was served as well, which was very good. For dinner I ordered the grilled sirloin, I must say it was a little tough, but the red wine sauce gave it some much needed flavor. The presentation of my meal was great as well. There were a lot of little details that wowed me with this place, for example, each place setting has a different (decorated) plate. You can tell this restaurant pays close attention to detail. Everyone we interacted with, especially the hostess, were extremely friendly, accommodating, and polite. The only flaw I found about this restaurant is that there is 1 bartender for the entire restaurant. Yes 1. We came in first to have a drink and waited about 20 minutes before being served.

Which is ok; it's NJ. They were polite and prompt. Food:  My Dad ordered the soup of the day, a lobster bisque.  This had a weird sour ping to it.. and no lobster meat. Just lobster ""essence,"" so it was not really chunky, the way I like it.  It was still creamy though. The presentation was it was nice (the way they present soup in formal places- herbs on the bottom; pouring in the soup). He followed up with the Turkey Club Sandwich, which I did not like, but I don't like cold cuts on sandwiches (I was actually a little disappointed it wasn't real turkey, but the cold cut)...the bacon was good though; it was extra smoked.  I always love avocado, but the bread and pesto mayo was whatever.  I also didn't love the shoestring potatoes- they were REALLY fried and more like chips versus fries. My Mom ordered the poaches eggs with crab hash. This was good... but wasn't really complex. It was a bit sweet and..cold? It was good though; the eggs were poached perfectly. Finally me. I thought I was ordered the most unique dish- the crispy eggs (poached eggs with panko crumb breading) with proscuitto, mixed greens, asparagus, and shitake mushrooms (these were a GREAT touch).

As an appetizer I ordered the strawberry crispy goat cheese salad with almonds, it was a small portion but definitely satisfying.  My husband ordered the octopus, potatoes, and arugala and loved it.  The meal started off very good. We both were thinking the meal can only get better from here... For my main course I ordered the sea bass and my husband ordered the petite filet. The sea bass had no flavor.  I could have made it better at my house.  My husband ordered the petite filet medium rare and it came out medium to medium well - and tasted like a plain steak. If I wanted a plain steak I could have ordered one at Outback Steakhouse that would have been seasoned with at least salt and pepper.The toffee chocolate dessert was delicious.

I had made the reservations on opentable and left a note saying it was for a birthday, and the day before they called me to ask me if I wanted to pre-order a dessert so that it would be a surprise at the end of the meal. I really thought that was going the extra mile in terms of service.The food was pretty unique as well. We had the crispy eggs, which are actually poached eggs that are then panko breaded and deep fried. Also had the poached eggs with crab meat hash. This dish was tasty, and surprisingly light.

Amanda's look's like someones gorgeous, well-to-do built-in-the-1920s home, complete with roaring fireplace, family portraits and china cabinets, but not overdone. I also went at Christmastime and the place was decked out for the holiday while playing classic Christmas music over the sound system. I loved every second of it and couldn't stop looking around! On to the food - for apps we had the lamb meatballs which were great and had an amazing sauce. As an entree I had the duck with butternut squash, mustard greens and pancetta as a side which was wonderful, I also had a bite of the seared tuna entree and it was super flavorful. For dessert we shared a salted caramel pudding which is everything I want in a dessert - smooth and not too sweet, and I also loved the chocolate on the bottom which wasn't too overwhelming. I will definitely be back! Hopefully for brunch next time.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

Amanda's is a really awesome spot in Hoboken. Probably the most upscale dining in Hoboken besides Chucharamama and Fig Tree. It's very hard to give a full five stars because Hoboken only has a handful of places like this so I'm really just comparing them to each other. We came here on a Thurs night, and had an awesome private table. Our waiter was really nice and was very open with his suggestions on what to eat and drink. My fiance and I started with a few salads (beet and frizze). For entrees I had the pan roasted cod. It was a good portion size and had a ton of flavor. The fish was cooked to perfection and the accompaniments accented the dish well. My fiance had the short rib, which were braised in red wine and some other things I can't remember off the top of my head. It was excellent. For dessert they brought us a complimentary chocolate lava cake. I mean you can't go wrong with that, right?Amanda's def has their act together.

The interior decor is a bit outdated and unclassy. Food was decent, but I wouldn't return. I'm sure there are better places, at which to dine. My blueberry cake was more like a blueberry muffin, and I was severely under-impressed. I vaguely recall that my appetizer was my favorite, and the main was okay.

For $16 you get a first course, entree and a dessert. Its a good deal on its own but considering the prices at Amanda's at other times, its a steal.The place looks much smaller on the outside since it is so narrow, but once you enter you realize how long it is. It also has another level for what seems to be private events. The restaurant felt very comfortable, like being in a cozy apartment and the service was amazing from the get go.I was determined to have as healthy of a meal as possible so I started with the mixed baby greens salad that comes with balsamic vinaigrette, Sonoma goat cheese and golden raisins .I rarely order salads yet it was probably the most memorable part of my meal. It tasted very fresh and flavorful and had just the right mix of sweet and salty.For the main dish I ordered the pan seared chicken breast with sweet potato puree, sautéed braising greens, leeks, almonds, cranberries and natural jus. I was not really impressed by the chicken but everything besides that was great. For dessert I got the chocolate mousse which was just what I needed. It was simply decadent; soft and sweet just like it should be.I am not sure if I am going to be back for any other type of meal but I might have to leave work early one more time to take advantage of the early bird dinner and this time I am ordering the steak!",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

Com and showed up right on time.   There was a large group before us,  so we thought we would have to wait.   The host came right up to us and sat us immediately after we told him we had reservations.   The ambiance is amazing and is somewhat out of your great grandmother's house if you grew up rich,  which my date and I didn't,  so we were very impressed.   The table is pre-set with antique China that is decorated uniquely to each setting.   I love architecture and the ceilings,  walls,  and flooring are all eloquently furnished.   The bar,  which is to the immediate left as you walk in is a little small and could use a wider variety of beers,  could easily be used as a scene for Lucky Thomas in HBO's Boardwalk Empire. We were seated as a 3' x 3' table,  which is a little small.   This is an indicator or things to expect with Amanda's though.   I've learned over the years in Hoboken that expensive food never means better food,  so I was a little skeptical of the menu which generally runs about $30 a plate.   We asked if there were specials and I was surprised that there were none on a Friday night.  The waiter explained that they were in the middle of changing their menu though.   I ordered a beer,  muscles for an appetizer,  and the salmon dish.   My date ordered the chicken and a soda.   The waiter warned me that the salmon came with bacon,  which I was happy to hear,  but greatful for the warning.   The drinks were a little slow, and came out about 7 minutes after we ordered them.   I was slightly annoyed how long it took,  but the muscles came a few minutes later so that distracted my mind.   The muscles were amazing.   They were swimming in a lemon wine sauce that was a tad to salty for my taste to finish it,  but I still relished it on my bread.   The muscles came with bread that  was grilled and showed signs of the char lines.   This was a really nice touch that gave the dish a unique look to separate it from any presentation of muscles I have ever had.  The entrées came out shortly after we finished the muscles,  and that's when I realized the connection between the table size and portions.   The salmon was an inch wide by five inched.   It was a center cut,  so it was on the thicker end though.   It wasn't ornately garnished,  but looked very appealing if you didn't consider the portion size and the fact that you're 6'-2"" and 240 lbs.   Luckily my date,  who has made it clear while writing this that she's my girlfriend,  is petite.   So,  I was happily looking forward to take her left overs and finishing them at the end of my date with a petite portion of salmon.   Her chicken was well dressed,  and was very appealing to the eye.   She fed me a piece like lady feeding the tramp, and it was mouth watering.   I never has chicken so moist before that wasn't swimming in grease.   Can I get that recipe? Please? The salmon was done to perfection.   It was pan seared and finished in the over to the perfect temperature.   Kudos to the chef!   The service was equally as good.   I would definitely recommend Adamda's to anyone who can afford a great tasting menu,  and who is not put off by the portion sizes.   I would recommend they give options for double meat portions with their meals,  and I will definitely go back.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

I really like the atmosphere of this place; it reminds me of a Victorian house, with its antique wooden hutches and cupboards, ornate ceiling decorations, and polished brass and wooden bar. Although we didn't have reservations, we were seated quickly and served promptly by an efficient, polite waiter. I ordered the cured salmon and spinach Benedict while my boyfriend ordered the ham and Swiss cheese omelette with a side order of fruit compote. I also had a mimosa with my meal. My Benedict was very good, and the poached egg was cooked just right. I also sampled my boyfriend's omelette, which was light and fluffy. My only complaint was the fruit compote: it was more like a variety of fruit piled onto a plate. It was good though.

The place is very charming and romantic.  We had the mussels in white wine and garlic sauce as well as the polenta with mushroom ragout and cheese sauce. Both were very good starters. Also, their wine list is pretty thorough. I had the cod entree which was served with chorizo and fingerling potatoes in a clam sauce. Pretty yummy. The cod was cooked perfectly. My lady had the pork chop with braised red cabbage, prunes, and mashed potatoes. I wish I woulda got that!!! Nice crust on the pork and tender and juicy on the inside. The server we had definitely made the entire experience that much more memorable/enjoyable. She was extremely pleasant and attentive. Definitely glad we came here. Well worth our wait.

I selected the mixed baby greens salad, the penne, and the key lime pie. All were excellent selections. The penne was the weakest part of my meal. It was delicious, but I'm not much of a pasta person, so my biggest complaint is that there is only one vegetarian entree on the fixed menu, which is really unfortunate when you dislike pasta. I also sampled my date's polenta, which was formed into a cute little cake with incredible sauces draped over it. He also got the apple raisin strudel for dessert, and I think that might have one-upped my key lime pie.

The mimosas were made perfectly.I happened to visit only a few hours after a major water main break knocked out running water to virtually all of Hoboken. While many restaurants unfortunately had to close, and lots of people on the streets were carrying take-out pizza home for an improvised lunch, Amanda's not only stayed open, they didn't miss a beat at all. The entire menu was still available, and they still served glasses of water to every table as usual. Since they couldn't wash any dishes, they were able to quickly improvise and use plastic utensils and plates (that were made to look like real silverware and plates!). The restaurant was still packed, the service was still excellent, and food was still delicious. Our waiter apologized to us after brunch for needing to use plastic silverware - not that he had any need to apologize - and said that they weren't going to let a water main break get in the way of their usual business.Kudos to the owners and staff at Amanda's for not missing a beat despite not having any running water, when so many other restaurants shut their doors for the day.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

There were several unfortunate moments that overshadowed the spectacular food offered here. In celebrating our 13th wedding anniversary we took the advise of a few friends and made reservations at Amanda's. Upon entry after a brisk 4 1/2 block walk from the parking lot we walked in and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited some more for the host who without bothering to look up once and at the very least acknowledge our presence in the room had taken the time to converse with other patrons, and make three trips behind the main entry way a curtain to bring out three separate cocktails. When he was done serving all if this tables cocktails he finally looks up and offers his service. We are seated and our experience officially begins. It's a Sunday night in February at 6:45. Their first thing I order is the very first cocktail on the menu and I am told it is not available  fine so I order something else, the I ask if I could have the salad on their special restaurant week menu in a full size and I'd be happy to pay a full price and I'm told that it cannot be done. Fine so I doer something else. Then I order my main meal l and guess what - not available, ok how about .... And again I am told no not available. At this point I would prefer to just go home but for my spouses sake and the face that we did drive in and the car was almost five blocks away I kept my smile on and adjusted. To the chefs benefit, the food did end up being DELISH and the cheesecake was WOW (pineapple upside down - not so much) but the overall service - except for the guy who kept filling our water, was mediocre at best. I wouldn't return, there are  plenty of places to find divine food and better service at the same price.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"
239,TDryIxhTbXc_QzA4XIUCrw,Nicole H.,3.0 star rating,"I sort of have a hard time liking Amanda's. I've been there twice, both times for brunch - most recently this morning. Here's the main thing to know: this is DEFINITELY a brunch menu, bordering more on breakfast. If you tend to be more of a lunchy-brunch person, you're not going to love it. I think my problem is that I'm more of a lunch person... Pancakes and French toast are not appealing to me. I like eggs, but I always feel stupid paying more than diner prices for eggs.... Seriously: Why would eggs, bacon and potatoes ever cost more than like $8 tops?! For that reason, I'm always disappointed with my meals at Amanda's. It's not because the food isn't tasty... It's just... So breakfasty. That all being said...My fiancé ordered the poached eggs with crab hash and loved it. I ordered the crispy eggs (poached egg, coated in panko and deep fried) with shiitake mushrooms, asparagus and green salad, which was good, but incredibly rich (read: too much). My fiancé's father ordered the croissant French toast which he said was ridiculously decadent (read: delicious). I will give them a thumbs up for their Bloody Mary - that was super tasty. But my coffee was served cold, and we had to ask 3 times for more butter for the table. Like I said, I'm really torn - from a service standpoint it was great, but from a food standpoint, I just haven't been able to walk away happy or satisfied...",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

Cute and quaint inside, this adorable restaurant is very comfortable and accessible. The menu had a lot of variety, but isn't overwhelming. I met an old friend here for brunch and I ordered the crispy eggs. I am a sucker for poached eggs especially since no matter how many times I've tried, poaching eggs at home is a skill I have yet to master. The crispy eggs are poached, then deep fried and served over peeled asparagus, shiitake mushrooms and mixed greens with prosciutto on the side. There was a cream sauce on top as well. The saltiness of the meat and the sweetness of the cream sauce really played well with the eggs and the rest of the dish. It was really the perfect bite! For dessert I had a molten chocolate cake which was served with vanilla ice cream. Not much to say, as molten chocolate cake is always delicious.

It is truly one of the most, if not THE most awesome dining experience I have had. What I love is how it doesn't strive to be trendy or ""new"" like other restaurants. It certainly has an old school charm transporting you to more of a Martha's Vineyard type scene vs. a glitzy metropolitan spot. There is a very well-stocked yet small bar as you walk in. What's great about it is it never gets packed at all as it serves as a waiting area. This is a very nice touch. If your date is running late or your table is being cleaned off you can order a drink here and then bring it to the table when everything is ready. The staff goes out of its way for you. Very friendly. The servers certainly are used to customers with high expectations and make sure your food and overall experience is five star. I believe I had a mushroom ravioli here that knocked my socks off. Yes, it's a bit pricey, but not out of the normal for such a fine establishment as this one.

The decor is classic and feels very homey. There was plenty of space which was good because it was very crowded. (Good thing we had reservations! Phew!) Our waitress was incredibly nice and even let us know that there's free parking! So for all of you drivers out there, you have a winner.I ordered the eggplant fritata. The rolls served beforehand were SO DELICIOUS. It wasn't even fair because I wanted a full basket of them. (Which they do offer as part of a large bread basket you can order. (It looked beautiful.)) When the fritata arrived, I tried it and was very satisfied: the eggs were cooked well, the veggies the correct ration of squishy to crunchy. If anything, it could have used cheese, but I enjoyed it.I also tried boyfriend's pumpkin soup and it was to die for.

(Both together) Then we ordered the wine, two bottles, one white and one red.  Upon arrival of the red wine, it was the wrong selection we had told the waiter and that had to be returned.  The correct wine appeared.  We received our apps around 7:50pm and there were perfect .   We noticed the back room was full of guests and it seemed like a good part of the staff was working that area.   We ate the apps and continued to drink our wine.  As time passed we noted we had not received our food nor has our waiter come by to check on us for anything or advise us of a delay.  I attempted to make eye contact with our waiter in his passing, but he did not look our way.  Finally it was 8:50pm and our main meal has not arrived, I saw the Host (manager) and called him over to let him know our food has not arrived and he said he would check on it.   A few minutes later the waiter appeared and advised us it seemed the kitchen was backed up.  We assumed this due to the Large back dinner going and the rest of the place was generally busy. Or our main meal ticket was misplaced in the kitchen. The host (manager) did not come back to us to let us know the reason as I had asked him, he had send over the waiter to advise us.Our main meal finally came to us at 9pm, (came very fast once we advised the manager) with no apology for delay or any other words as to the foods being so late.  The meal was good, so we have no complaints on the foods, but only the service last night..  We also felt the Host (manager) should of offered us a glass of wine for a dessert on the house due to the long wait.  We did order dessert and were charged for it.

Last time we were there they made us a special Sangria that was amazing, even though it wasn't on the menu. When I mentioned this to our waiter he acted like I had 5 heads and had just asked for custody of his first born. It was incredibly rude. To be honest, on that note alone, I almost wanted to get up and walk out. Oh wait, walk out? How could I when i was cramped at a table that was no longer than the width of a notebook and two dates were going on next to us. One couple drunker than the next or just over-hearing their problems was incredibly annoying to our night. It sort of ruined the romantic atmosphere we were going for. The food portion was small. My shrimp basmati was good but nothing outstanding and my fiance's scallops were so small he left hungry. That is not how you should walk out after spending $100 dollars.

Food:  The meal started off with a tiny, spherical roll (really, the smallest roll I've seen) - which was fresh and delicious.  But, the table next to us had ordered the Balthazar bread basket which was definitely the way to go.  $8 for croissants, mini scones and danishes could almost be a meal in itself.-French toast - Made on croissants with seasonal fruit compote of mostly blueberries on top.  The croissant was a unique touch to make this classic dish extra special, fluffy and flakey. -Frittata - The frittata with eggplant, mozzarella and tomato was really just an omelet with cheese poured on top.  It wasn't nice to look at and wasn't the tastiest brunch I've had.  The eggs were too buttery/greasy, and there was way too much cheese pooling on the top.  Even after scraping of the excess cheese, I could barely taste the eggplant or tomato.  Definitely a disappointment in an otherwise lovely brunch.  The potatoes it came with were very good.-Both entrees came with a good amount of fresh fruit (watch out, the grapes have pits), instead of just a fruit garnish, which was a great addition.Atmosphere:  Again, a beautiful restaurant where the waiters and customers were dressed on the more formal side.  The layout with multiple rooms reminded me of a B&B, full of character.  The restaurant is great for couples, adult families, or a group of friends getting together to catch up.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

At first, I was like ""oh no, they're sticking us in the basement,"" but it was nice. The room was quaint and smelled pleasant and looked newly remodeled. There was a faux fireplace with some beautiful stained glass.The waitstaff was also very pleasant. The service was prompt and the prices were reasonable. We had the special for the evening - rib eye steak with au gratin potatos and vegetables - and a separate order of steak (a sirloin). I think the waiter was a bit surprised to see us house a ton of meat, but the food was AMAZING.

(You have to order before 5:45, but the quality/quantity/price of the meal make eating at a dinner time intended of the elderly completely worthwhile.)After strutting into the establishment right after work and being seated at one of the quaint tables near the window, I ordered the cheapest red wine on the menu (yes, I'm classy.) I glanced at the prix fix menu, and what a menu it was! I was pleasantly surprised with the variety of meal choices available - this isn't your run of the mill limited 2-3 choice menu. Entree options included cod, skirt steak, pork loin, chicken, and ravioli. Translation? I can come back again and again for a variety of excellent meals. During our geriatric dinner I immensely enjoyed all three of my chosen courses. I started out with the soup of the day, a cream of corn. It was both creamy and scrumptious! More than just cream and corn, there was a delicate addition of pesto, carrots, bacon, and potato. Just the right amount of everything in harmony. For my main course I decided to get something I wouldn't make for myself - honey and sage marinated pork loin with asparagus and creamy polenta. I don't know if it's my favorite meal that I've ever had here, but it was definitely delicious. The polenta might have been the most interesting part the meal because it was done like a flavorful extra smooth mashed potato. To conclude my meal I choose the chocolate moose. It was presented beautifully with whipped cream and strawberries topping the moose which sat inside a dainty chocolate container.

I'll pass on the brunch recommendations without reservation.The food was really top-notch. The rolls brought to the table when we were all seated were sort of a throw away, but were fresh and were a nice touch for those not ordering a large bread basket.The clear highlight of our meals was my friend's crispy eggs, so I'll start with that dish. Crispy eggs are poached eggs that were frozen, then covered in panko bread crumbs and fried. They were fabulous - the frying perfectly crisped the panko while rewarming but not overcooking the eggs. Modernist cuisine techniques that were used to be delicious, rather than just impressive. The dish came with prosciutto, asparagus, porcini mushrooms, greens and I think a couple other things. It was really terrific.My classic eggs benedict was also wonderful - creamy, decadent hollandaise, everything perfectly prepared and seasoned, and accompanied by ripe fruit and potatoes. Although I think the potatoes could have been slightly better had they been all cut the same sizes, they were really good as they were.My friend's warm sliced chicken breast over mixed greens with currants and pecans was similarly yummy, and was exactly what she wanted. Bellinis and coffee were common, nothing I'd write home about.Service was just about flawless. We were greeted warmly and our coats were checked promptly. Although our party wasn't complete, we were immediately given a table in accordance with our reservation, and we were not hassled due to our lateness or the fact that we stayed and chatted even after we finished eating, even though the restaurant was constantly full. Water glasses were constantly refilled, and our server was charming and knowledgeable. No complaints.The restaurant is cozy and, despite its size, great for conversation without feeling like you were listening in on neighboring tables or having them listen to your conversations. Clean, nothing fancy, just nice.Make a reservation (phone/ online) - this place is popular!

We had a reservation for 5 people during the Early Dinner time (5-5:30) and honestly, it's the best deal and meal we've had in nj!! What an Early Dinner will provide you with is a full three course meal (appetizer, entree and dessert) for ONLY $16 per person. Such a great deal!! The food is delicious as well!!Today the choices for the appetizer course was a mixed salad with Sonoma goat cheese and golden raisins (really good! The cheese was fresh and I usually dislike eating goat cheese but It was so fresh that I ate every morsel of the cheese!), White Bean Vegetable soup (really yummy, a lot of vegetables and great for the cold weather) and cheese polenta with red pepper coulis (really good, the sauce was great!)The Entree choices were great too! I got the cod with curry lentils and smoked tomatoes and it was soooooo good! The lentils had great smoky flavor to it and I really enjoyed it. My grandma got the chicken with almond and cranberry sauce and she enjoyed that as well. The dessert choice was a keylime pie ( really nice balance of tartness and sweetness with light whipped cream), chocolate mousse and apple streudal with raisins (crispy pie crust with warm apples inside, can't get better than that!) The atmosphere is so relaxing and it's gorgeous. I felt like I time travelled back into the 1900's because te building offered great original architectural features!Overall great service, food and experience but I highly recommend going during the early dinner.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"
303,nASjN5GQPWe-vzh75NCjlQ,Amal S.,1.0 star rating,"Having dined several times over the years- this was by far one of the worst experiences ever.  I will say in the end they did the right thins. Service was beyond sub par with too many things wrong to mention.I must say the pollenta app, beat and avocado salad and lobster bisque were amazing- that was the ONLY redeeming thing about the evening. The chicken, steak and tuna entrees were inedible. Could not swallow the chicken and it was only the second time in my life I sent an entree back.  We poured our own wine the entire night- service was lacking.  I WILL GIVE THEM MAJOR POINTS FOR THIS... everyone has off nights- this was really off. The manager was very nice and receptive. I had a nice one off with him on the side. He took off two of the entrees (which we did not ask him to do) and he even offered complimentary desert (which we passed on).  We tipped on the total check- as if the entrees were on there. Honestly service was bad but it's a tough job waiting tables.  The measure of a business or person is not in the mistakes they make but in how they handle it and rectify them. I am impressed with how well they cared about it and for that alone I will go back.  I have never had a bad experience like this and was floored- but I want to go back just to prove to myself that all those other great times were truly great.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

Upon entering the hostess asked us for the name on our reservation, we figured since we didn't have one there would be a long wait, but we were seating right away. One notable about Amanda's is the ambiance; it is sophisticated yet comforting. If you are going for brunch, casual dress is appropriate, but I assume for dinner, nicer dress attire would be called for. It was different having a full place setting for brunch, but I was happy when a server brought out bread before our appetizer. I wasn't a fan of the bloody Mary I had, but the bellini was pretty good. The smoked salmon app was great, I would order it again for sure. I was a bit disappointed with the entrees. They were OK, but I expected much better. I had the eggs benedict, and my girlfriend ordered the crab hash with poached eggs. Both dishes were a bit sloppy, like the chef just threw them together without caring about presentation. The taste was a nothing to write home about , it wasn't one of the better eggs benedicts I have had. (eggs benny is my go to brunch item) Another notable is the service, our server was great, and the other servers were prompt with clearing dishes and filling up water glasses.

This is a top notch spot for brunch, which is what I am reviewing Amanda's for. The menu has a lot of amazing options, most of which are in some variety of egg. Every time I have gone to Amanda's, everyone enjoyed their food. I have gotten the Eggs Benedict w/ Crab Hash (A+) and club sandwich - neither have disappointed, and they were brought to the table in less than 15 minutes. There are a few local beers on tap, as well as an assortment of brunch cocktails - all very good.The service is the best in town. The restaurant is extremely classy on the inside, but don't get the impression that it is at all stuffy - there is no standard dress code with people ranging from jeans and a sweatshirt to formal (depending on occasion). It can get very busy on the weekends during prime brunch hours, so make a reservation if you are with a larger party or on a strict schedule.Finally, the pricing is almost too good to be true. At a place like Amanda's - where decorative plates are used as placeholders and the waiters wear bow ties - one might expect the price to reflect this. Not the case - considering the size of the portions and the quality of the food, paying $11-$14/plate is certainly reasonable.Best brunch in Hoboken.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

We started with two small salads- nothing special.  As an entree, my boyfriend had the sirloin ($34 dollars - would have been acceptable if it was more like $25) which had a monster vein running through it with a crunchy burnt crust on it.  The meat itself unfortunately was no better than something you may find at a friends BBQ.  His potatoes au gratin were delicious though. I had the cod ($28 dollars - would have been acceptable at $20), which was somewhat crunchy and rubbery at the same time.  Flavors on both meals were just okay. As for the service, there was atleast 10 people working in the dining room, however none of which were attentive enough to refill our wine glasses/water or take our plates once our meals were finished.  We literally sat there and saw our waiter and multiple bus boys walk by us 10 times for a good twenty minutes doing nothing with our plates that were waiting to be picked up. Mind you, this place was not that busy and I am very patient as I have worked in many restaurants in my life and also I had no reason to rush on this particular night.  My boyfriend who always needs a dessert, was indifferent about ordering one because the meal had already taken so long and we were just over it.  I forced him to get the molten cake (not worth getting at all) because about an hour before i called to ask them to either put a candle in his dessert or write happy birthday or anything they could do.  Very nicely, the host on the phone took his name down and said, ""absolutely, we will do something, see you soon"".  So of course the cake comes with nothing on it and I just laughed and told my boyfriend what had happened.  No big deal, we finished up, asked for the check and instead of the check, minutes later a bowl of ice cream comes with a candle.  Whattt??? We had dessert, we want to go home now.  So strange, we laughed a little harder and finally got the check.  Unfortunately, this was our first and last time at Amanda's.  Our mediocre dinner totaled $133.00 before tip.  For the equal price or less, just jump on the Path and head into NYC for an entirely better experience.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

Being in New York all the time, its difficult to give 4 and 5 stars to places that just don't jump out at you. The descriptions for the dished were so boring that my girl and I were not very enthusiastic about ordering....pan roasted fish, grilled tuna, marinated grilled chicken breast (seriously...who goes out to a nice restaurant to order chicken breast?!? americans...), a flank steak and a sirloin. We ordered the steaks and the food was flavored well but the steaks were slightly overcooked (I guess that's what I get for ordering a steak outside a new york steak hour...).

When we arrived at Amanda's we were freezing cold, and it was such a welcome to go into the restaurant and feel the fire in the fireplace and the warmth and smells from the kitchen. It was a really nice way to enter a restaurant. When we went it was Hudson County restaurant week and so my mom and I got the pre-fixed restuarant week menu for $35.00, which included an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I had the endive and beet salad which was a little small (less than a cup of food), and then I had the french cut chicken with roasted brussel sprouts, carrot puree and winter orzo. It. Was. Amazing. The chicken was so moist and perfectly cooked, and very flavorful, and the brussel sprouts were so flavorful. My mom got the short ribs with blue cheese polenta. We also had red wine (I don't remember which) off the recession wine list which I thought was very cleverly named. For dessert my mom had the bread pudding, and I had the key lime pie which I read was amazing...and it definitely lived up to its review. It was tart, but not too tart, and very flavorful. I definitely intend to go back. I really want to try it for  brunch, and during the summer. It was so cozy and relaxing and the wait staff offered wonderful dinner suggestions.

There menu is seasonal, so you're pretty much guaranteed fresh ingredients and something new every time. Not you're run of the mill restaurant serving the same dishes over and over again.I've never had softshell crab before, but this is the place to try it for the first time. Very tasty, no chewy like i was afraid it would be.I was taken aback by the lambchops! Cooked to perfection, and the sauce I wanted to lick off the plate. The keylime pie! It is made from scratch, none of the premade crust here(or green food dye) Comparable to what one would get from Florida. Filling was the right consistency, lime wasn't overpowering but tart enough, and the crust was crumbly goodness. Brunch was good. I'm not going to rave about it, but it was a refreshing menu as well. I had the poached eggs, but when i was saw the eggs Benedict I was quickly in remorse wishing i had that instead.Overall go to Amandas. It may be a splurge depending on your budget.

The bacon that she brought back was cooked all right, but it was covered with still-bubbling grease; and when I picked up a piece of bacon, grease was dripping off it.  They should've soaked up the grease with a paper towel or something, right?  The shoestring potatoes were pretty good.All in all, I think the kitchen probably didn't have a good day.  We'd like to try this place again.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

I must say, I'm a good cook and I've done frittatas on a lazy day that have come out similar... I just didn't get the seasoning (since they chose to put very little...) the side potatoes were a great add-in and the fruit on the plate made the meal end off on a great end note...I wish I ordered their Assorted Breads from a bakery in NY, it looked DELISH but we were only 3 people and 8 pieces of bread and my mom and I on a low-carb diet wouldn't have made sense.. My mother's mushroom and vegg omelet was very sophisticated, in that it was julliened veggies and small cut mushrooms that were sell-seasoned... I liked the poach eggs that my husband ordered with crab hash that didn't have an overwhelming crab flavor...The funny thing about this restaurant is that EVEN though my meal wasn't spectacular... when I'm in Weehawken, I will trek 5 minutes into Amanda's FOR SURE, take a friend, wow them with the ambiance and order the croissant french toast with a fruit compote -- and I'll probably be happy... you cant go wrong with fruit and the ambiance this place has..

They have a solid wine list with a number of good values. We picked a Matanzas Creek Chardonnay and it was great. We had the Gnocchi and the Mussels to start. The gnocchi was pillowy goodness with a nice pea and mushroom sauté. The mussels were abundant and delicious with a really good stock and some delicious focaccia. We had Scallops, Trout and the Lamb Chops. All were perfectly prepared and delicious. We shared a piece of the key lime tart for dessert. It was delicious and fresh with a bright sweet limeyness that was just right!

418,cxbDYAd0sgbr4jCa-barRQ,Megan L.,3.0 star rating,"Yes you read right. I gave one of the supposed best restaurants in Hoboken 3 stars. I know that amandas has a very popular brunch (the best in the city according to them) which I have never had so I'm sticking to dinner in this review. I was just there last night and had such a mediocre experience I felt the need to share immediately. Amandas has an early seating menu mon-sat if you make a reservation at 5 or 530. It's a prix fix menu for $15 a person and you can get a bottle of their house wine for $20. Now I always give credit where credit is due so I'll be the first to admit that that's a great deal. So when we went last night we did the early seating and from the second we walked in, I could sense a bit of an attitude on the servers. Which to an extent I can understand since they are not making nearly as much money off of the early seating customers as they would for normal dinner patrons. But it's pretty unacceptable to act like your customers are ruining your life.  And it nearly ruined our dinner. Our server seemed annoyed in general and wasn't the slightest bit friendly. And not once did the guys who brought our food say your welcome when I thanked them (personal pet peeve of mine) On to the food. The chicken and rice soup i ordered was pretty skimpy in portion and the soup barely covered the bottom of the bowl. The skirt steak was better, precisely cooked to order and went well w the mashed potatoes. So if I was ratinkg just the food alone I would've thrown another star in there, mostly bc I know the food at amandas is good and I was pretty satisfied w my dinner. But a-ok food this particular night in combination w the lousy service made for a subpar experienceI wouldn't not recommend this restaurant by any stretch.

Decor isn't terribly important to me but for all the oohs and aahs over the ambiance I wasn't all that pleased.A huge kudos must be given to the management for their handling of post-graduation festivities.

Luckily, the opportunity arose where I could throw one there this past week-end.We threw a baby shower brunch for my sister in law on Sunday . The ballroom is the most appropriate space for an event because it is out of the way of the rest of the restaurant and can be sectioned off with a curtain. Between the wait staff and the event coordinator Dana, the service could not have been better.

I dare say that it is one of the best anywhere.  It is unassumingly located on Washington Street in Hoboken. When you walk in, you feel like you're in a restaurant from the days of Sinatra. The dining room has a cozy townhouse feel to it.  White clothed tables are set perfectly with each diner getting their very on unique dinner plate. I don't think any two plates in the place are the same. Everyone from the maitre d' to the waiters and bus boys are in bow ties. Service was very attentive yet unintrusive.  The food was very good.  I had the skirt steak with chimmichurri sauce, whipped potatoes and roasted carrots. It was delicious. Steak was done perfectly and plenty flavorful adn juicy. My date had the seafood stew in a tomato broth. It was a big bowl of stew, though we wished it packed more of the mussels, clams and fish to make it more hearty. Meal was capped off with the yummy chocolate molten cake and vanilla ice cream. The chocolate cake was pretty much a souffle so it took a while to come out. There is a great selection of very affordable wines. We had a bottle of the Albet i Noya, a Spanish white wine. What was left over in the wine bottle, they packed for us in a small wine bag to take home! They validate 3 hours of parking at Little Man Parking on 12th and Hudson. Just remember to get a sticker before you leave.Overall, it was great dining experience. One thing that I did find interesting besides everyone wearing bow ties was that there was NO Mexicans there.

The kitchen was adjacent to us, so there was adequate waitstaff continuously passing by.  Despite the fact that other than the shower (that hadn't yet started...just a few girls there early for the party decorating and setting doodads up for the bride to be/expectant mother) the service was nothing to write home about.  The Maitre d' seemed way too concerned with the poor girls scotch taping things to the wall in the next room over for their party.  I should not have had to hear this ranting and raving when he could have asked them politely and professionally to please not hang anything o the walls...Instead he bitched and whined about it right in front of us, outside of the kitchen for a good 10 minutes or so, and then snottily (is that a word) and rudely asked that they remove everything, while he, himself started ripping things angrily off of the wall while muttering under his breath about the new paint job being ruined.  Exaggerate much?  It was scotch tape-not liquid nails.He then proceeded to bring part of our table the incorrect order....with so few people here at this time, this seemed kind of ridiculous that the order was wrong.  We ate so that our food didn't get cold, while my Aunt politely sat waiting for her correct order.  When we all had our correct meals, they were tasty, but nothing extraordinary.I would check it out one more time and give it another chance, perhaps for dinner when there weren't showers going on all around us, and we didn't have a maitr d' that was too wrapped up in a....sticky situation.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

And you can also get a bottle of the house featured wine, red or white, for $20.  So you can have a very good 3 course meal and bottle of wine for about $60 for two including tip.  This is practically unheard of within a 50 mile radius of Manhattan.  If you live in Hoboken and haven't taken advantage of this place you should have your head examined.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

476,ZczdxiTGwlIZbJpedrT2Sg,The Jedi Foodi E.,4.0 star rating,"Amanda's is universally regarded as the finest restaurant in Hoboken. The charming colonial townhouse setting is enchanting and uber-romantic with seating divided among several dining rooms. The restaurant's winning trompe l'oeil décor and its menu full of tempting choices attracts the well-heeled young professionals who inhabit the neighborhood. They have what is possibly THE BEST deal in all of the Tri-State area, an early three course dinner for two for the total price of $28 ($14 per person). The kitchen is run by CIA trained Rodney Peterson. His irresistible dishes include sweet black mussels bathed in a lightly pungent garlic and white wine broth speckled with parsley; and creamy polenta punctuated with an herbed tomato sauce made rich with mascarpone, fontina and mozzarella cheeses. Salads are complex and artfully presented. The kitchen demonstrates a sure hand with fish, and it rightfully dominates the menu. The sauteed grouper with basmati rice is perfectly cooked. Game dishes, seasonally on the menu, offer rich flavors, as illustrated with the tender seared grilled venison. A sophisticated wine list is offered at reasonable prices. Desserts are something of an afterthought, but a good choice is Rodney's Cheesecake, light-bodied and just right. The apple-raisin strudel sends you to a cozy chalet in the Austrian Alps.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

From start to finish, the experience exceed every expectation. Our waiter was attentive but not overbearing and made great recommendations. We started off with the gnocchi carbonara, which was melt in your mouth good. For entrees, we had the salmon and jumbo shrimp. For dessert, we had their homemade cheesecake and they topped it off by writing happy birthday in chocolate around the plate.

One of our party enjoyed the bisque very much.  All five of us had different entrees:  a pasta dish, the trout, the pork chop, seared scallops and myself the seafood stew.  Given a choice at a really nice restaurant I generally will try the cioppino or seafood stew.  I just loved it.  The mussels and clams were tender as can be, the fish was not dry and the shrimp were succulent.  I thought the broth was very flavorful.   And broth is all that was left when I finished.  My wife's scallops were perfectly done and very flavorful without being at all oily.  And there were raves from the other three about their entrees as well.  The others shared a couple of delicious looking desserts while I had a nice 20 year old tawny port that finished things off nicely.  The prices are quite reasonable for the quality and the wine list was broad without being interminably long.  We had a couple of bottles of wine, one red, one white.   I think we were all in, including tax and tip for under $400 for five people but we divided the check and I was getting a little fuzzy by then, so that might be off a little..  By the way, the service was up to the quality of the food, quite excellent.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

484,wOpEDVE4pENfG_AGEjVAgg,Nico A.,3.0 star rating,"I was excited to go here as according to some this is the top rated restaurant in Hoboken. It is not however the best. It has all the trappings of a fine dining establishment and yet it doesn't work. Maybe it's the mish-mash of styles from faux Maxfield Parish to Art Nouvelle to faux Baroque. Or perhaps it's the battery powered flicker candle lights on the tables, but the over all impression is  ""Dinner at Grandma's house.""  You know those family dinners we all had to endure where everyone is trying really hard to be amiable, and not break anything, or be the one to cause scandal, so it all has a cozy quilted prison feeling that won't go away even after years of therapy. Yeah, you know what I mean, and that glass of wine you're reaching for isn't going to change a damn thing... but I digress.The service while a tad pinched is excellent. And the food while not incredible is very good. I had the bacon wrapped monk fish and was blissfully engrossed (and is the only reason I'm giving three stars}. But I found our appetizers {the mussels and the goat cheese salad} rather dull. And we didn't feel inclined to stick around for dessert.Over all not a bad place to take your Grandmother ... assuming she's dead.",Amanda’s Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, American, (New)"

It's incredibly smooth, cheesy and rich...by far the best polenta I've had. So, if you can plan ahead for dinner reservations, this is the place to go!

At times a little heavy on the salt but if you just ask them to go light on the salt it's done exactly the way you'd like it. The atmosphere is perfect for a winter or fall evening for drinks with friends at the bar. The bartender is friendly and cool. The waitstaff is courteous, considerate and pleasant. I've enjoyed the waitresses coming over to chat about a good wine or a tasty after dinner drink. Their recommendations are always on the spot. I love a place where the waitstaff eats the food. You have to wonder about a place that doesn't give their people an idea of what is being served. Save room for dessert because the dessert wine pairing is fantastic with their molten chocolate cake. Take your old friends or a date, it's a place that should not be missed if you stop by Hoboken for food.
