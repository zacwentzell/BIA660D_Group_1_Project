When it's warm out, I always try to sit outside because there's a great view of NYC. I'm especially a fan of their burgers and sandwiches, I think that's what they do best. My personal favorite is the breakfast burger (love that it comes with hollandaise sauce) but I've also tried the classic burger and pepperjack chicken sandwich. My one complaint is that the service is a little slow. Understandably, it's a busy place, but I always make a reservation when I come here...and still end up waiting for a table.

It was up there with one of the best Salmons I've ever eaten.  Well we decided to go back to Hoboken and the food wasn't as good the second time around but my biggest complaint is the disgusting bathrooms.  How can the kitchen and the staff be clean if the bathroom has broken seats, urine on the floor and no soap.  I just don't get it. This in and of itself is such a turn off that I will not return, not even for a drink.  I am very disappointed in all of the Ainsworth locations as I have been to all.  They really need to put the customer first, and please put some effort into a sanitary bathroom, my husband said the men's room was just as bad.It's a shame because it has a nice atmosphere!",Ainsworth Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"

Every single burger is absolutely terrific - the Classic Burger, Fried Mozzarella Burger and Caprese Burger are my favorites -  they come with delicious crispy fries.

Their view of the city is definitely a good positive, unfortunately their food left something to be desired. My girlfriend and I ordered a veggie burger and a vegetable sandwich to share so that we could both try them.The Veggie burger: the bun was wayyyyy too hard and crunchy for our taste. The homemade veggie burger itself was actually good, but they ruined it by pouring a ton of barbecue sauce on it to the point where that was all you could taste. The fries were good though! Albeit a touch over salted. The vegetable sandwich: loads better than the veggie burger, it came with grilled veggies, a fried piece of mozzarella (yum) and I think little bit of aioli (I think it was aioli? Hard to tell because there was any barely on it). The sandwich wasn't bad but it could've use something to add some flavor and some moisture as it was a little dry.

I was hesitant in eating here since last time I came it took forever to get service. We have been sitting here for 20 to 25 minutes and have yet to order. I guess don't come here if you're starving.. Not only that but the plates and utensils are dirty. The glass I had was disgusting, the waitress said they didn't clean it... the plates had salt and etc on them and the utensils were gross we had to clean them.I ordered the frozen pink lemonade mule and then 15 minutes later she tells me it's too frozen and if I wanted to wait.. would have been nice to know that sooner so I could have ordered something else. So then I got the watermelon sangria it was okay at best ($10)I got the Veggie burger ($16) and my boyfriend got the BBQ pulled pork ($15). The food came in 10 minutes which I was surprised. The food came faster than we were able to order. It was just ordinary. I didn't even finish it, I was still starving when I left. The service is terrible even though they weren't busy. I'm not surprised a lot of people don't come here. Bad service, expensive food that taste only okay, not the best place to go to eat.

We came to Ainsworth because we heard they were dog friendly and they have great seating with a view of the skyline. The restaurant offers several tables outside as well as a large dining space inside. When we got here at 3pm it was pretty packed. We got lucky and found the last table outside and got situated right away with our dog. I was happy to see that they provide water bowls for dogs as well.The menu offers a range of food items from your typical bar foods to something more hipster such as the avocado toast. My girlfriend and I opted for the fish tacos and onion burger. The price for each range from 13-15 bucks, not to bad for the area. The food itself tasted okay. The fish tacos were very average and nothing to rave about. It came with a sizable deep fried fish, topped off with a ton of pico de gallo and chipotle aioli. It also came smothered in avocado. I must say however that the 3 pieces were pretty large and I was very full by the end of the meal.Overall, I thought the food was very average. This spot is great for drinks as they offer outside seating with a nice view. Being dog friendly also wins extra points from me!

Ainsworth has got a pretty extensive menu with a variety of burgers, tacos, and small and shareable plates. The menu is a bit pricier than your average sports bar (15 dollar burgers and 12 dollar wings). But, The Ainsworth is also classier than your average sports bar. The interior decor is chic, think long reclaimed wood tables, chandeliers and decorative wallpaper. During football Sunday, it's an absolute party here. The house is completely packed out and they bring in DJs, shot girls and bottle service- the whole nine. I wasn't expecting much because the vibe initially seemed to be more party than quality food, but I actually really enjoyed my wings. They were some of the better buffalo wings that I've had in the Hoboken / JC area. Perfectly crunchy, and not too spicy but still a generous amount of flavor. I also ordered the mozz sticks (off the menu, you have to ask) and those were just okay.I'll take a star off because our service was a little wonky. She brought out the wrong beer and the wrong menu items with no apology. The host was also kind of snarky about sitting us right away when there were plenty of empty tables. I feel like they have this idea that they need to make you work for a seat on a Sunday, and that was a little off-putting. Jersey City does not have many sports bars, so when I'm looking for a place to watch the game out it's usually O'Haras or Hoboken.

I ordered a custom burger with carmelized onions, fried egg and gruyere cheese- all items they have in-house and use as toppings on their standard menu listed burgers. But, I could not order those individual items all on one burger as I was told no substitutions were allowed during brunch. Wow, ok. After also telling me ""no,"" the GM gave me his card, and as some kind of empty and meaningless concession, told me to ask for him next time. ""Next time?"" Next time assumes I'll come back to spend more money, which I won't be. The time to address the issue of my reasonable request was THIS TIME, but they didn't. Edit: Original review was 10/19/15.

A deep fried black bean and couscous, quinoa Patty with a sweet barbacue sauce, tomatoes and sauteed onion. The bun was a giant soft seeded roll. It's a hit. We also had the Mediterranean Couscous dish was was very disappointing. The ingredients were simple, including pearl couscous, spring mix salad and dries cranberries. The problem was the dryness.

I was sitting at our table for nearly 20 minutes twiddling my thumbs and waiting for my friend to arrive and multiple servers walked by trying to avoid eye contact or ask if I wanted water/drinks.  Finally I had to flag down someone & ask who would be assisting us. Very poor first impression. I had the fish special (mahi mahi) sandwich of the day and my friend had the staple egg white omelet. The sandwich was strictly okay and the fish wasn't very fresh... right of the bat I knew it was something that came out of the freezer & was deep fried on the spot.

We sit down, and the first thing we get is a bottle of water.   I am not sure why.. but the tap water tasted TERRIBLE .  She had to come back and give us a new bottle of water.

The fries were very crisp and well seasoned.  Now onto the service. With my burger and fries, I ordered a Shirley temple. Well unfortunately, I got more of a sprite with just a cherry instead of a Shirley temple. I politely asked for grenadine and my waitress politely said ""I honestly put all that was left in the bottle."" Mind you this is a Wednesday Night dinner with a group of friends. I found that my friend who ordered the same drink on the other side of table got much more cherry sauce in her drink. This is the middle of the week guys, I'm pretty sure all restaurant get their stock/food from the beginning to the middle of the week, in preparation for Friday and the weekend of course.

Our server was also friendly and helpful, until we wanted the check, at which point he/she was nowhere to be found.My only gripe is that they should probably lower the cocktail prices during the day if they want to encourage people to order them.

I worked in a high end restaurant for 2 years and am very aware of the quality and standards of a good restaurant. We came to the Ainsworth last night (A Sunday) around 6:30/6:45 PM for a good friend's birthday. The restaurant inside had maybe 8 tables seated total and was practically almost empty with the exception of some tables outside. The waitress never came over to take our drink orders or even asked if we wanted something to drink. Our whole table of 10 people had to go up the the bar and get them there!! That's problem number 1. Then we could not find the waitress for the next 20 minutes. She never came over to check on us or ask us for our food orders after we got our appetizers for that duration of time. Our table was starving so I got up the hostess stand and ask for our server who finally comes by 10 minutes later and takes our orders. Everyone at our table orders simple burger orders and Myself and my friend finally ordered the Coke soda orders we wanted- which when they came were bizarrely 3/4ths of the way filled?? We were starving and kept asking anyone who worked at the restaurant and our waitress who was barely around when our food was coming out because it was already 30 mins since we ordered. Then we find her and she says it's coming out right now. 15 mins after she says that they come out and a bunch of us have problems with our orders and 3 didn't get their food. The food runner who was giving us our food kept staring at the food receipt and announced the orders but couldn't tell us or figure out which ones were cooked medium or medium rare. The receipts have seat numbers so you should know exactly what dish goes to whose seat- both the server and food runner had no clue what they were doing. Both him and our waitress who comes back over finally figure out whose dish goes to who after 3-4 minutes. Then I check out my burger and realize there is sauce all over it when I simply asked for no sauce. She then says- oh the sauce is light... um maybe there's a reason I asked for no sauce, I do not like it and don't want it so her saying that is like telling me to deal with it... she finally takes it back and I get a new burger 15 minutes later. On top of this, the birthday girl who also ordered the Mac and cheese burger never got here meal until 30 mins after we all got ours because they kept screwing up! That is unacceptable!! Also 2 other people at our table did not get what they ordered. They finally bring it out the girl says it's a Mac and cheese burger and we ask her to check and she says yes it is. She leaves we open the burger and there's no Mac and cheese and it is not the correct burger! Again we wait 15 more minutes for a new one to be made and the a girl who seemed to be the ""manager"" RUDELY comes over and says ""here you go here's your burger!"" in the most snotty tone and barely looks us in the eyes and then she's leaves and says in a nasty, fake voice, ""have a great night!"" Our whole table was shocked!!! I cannot believe the dysfunction of this place and the staff are absolutely awful. My entire table was fuming for the duration of our time here. This place was so bad they took at least $100+ off our bill and gave us a bunch of what we ordered for free plus a free round of shots. That's saying something. The food was mediocre with the exception of the appetizers we ordered and the birthday girl refused to touch her burger once she got it after waiting 60-70 minutes because she was so disgusted and lost her appetite. They took that off the bill as well.I'm sorry but the staff and service at this place is the worst I have ever seen in my life. I expected WAY better for the Ainsworth. The manager who finally brought out the Mac and cheese burger after all of the mix ups needs to be fired. Being rude to customers who pay a lot of money because YOUR staff is clearly not trained and had 10+ mix ups and mistakes is shocking to me. I'm telling everyone I know to not come here, that's how awful this experience was. Run from this place like the plague.",Ainsworth Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"

The burgers are incredible and will set the bar high for every one that you eat after your visit, my personal favorites are the mac&cheese burger as well as the hanger steak burger.        In my most recent visit, my friends and I went to enjoy some food, drinks, and watch the NCAA tournament. Aleksandra took excellent care of us and was very accommodating to any and all of our requests (changing the channel on the tv to watch a certain game, beer refills, multiple rounds of entres and appetizers). She's very patient and kindso we did not feel rushed and ended up spending hours there.        Whether you're looking for a good night out with friends or a nice setting and location for a date, I definitely recommend giving the Ainsworth a try, they've been nothing but good to me so far",Ainsworth Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"

The service, food and cleanliness have gone downhill. While they aim to be a upscale sports bar and charge accordingly, I was disgusted when I went to use the bathroom and found it worse than any dive bar bathroom I've ever used. Worst of all this was not at 1am after a long night of partiers, it was at 6:00pm when the place was completely empty. It's very visible the place has not had a deep cleaning in months, I hate to think what the kitchen looks like. There burgers are usually awesome, last night it looked like they ran out of buns and ran to the store and bought the smallest cheapest store brand buns they can find.

All of the outdoor seating was occupied when I arrived, but since my friend wasn't there yet I elected to wait for a table outside. The hostess was really sweet and accommodating; she said it might be 30 minutes for a table outside, but two actually became available within 10 minutes and because we had a stroller, she brought me outside to ask which table would be better for us, which was much appreciated. I had a Bloody Mary with Absolute Peppar - it was pretty good. Fresh tasting. I appreciate the bottled tap water at the table, so you don't have to wait for your server for some more aqua, particularly because the service was extremely slow.  The server would disappear for a longggg time, even after we placed an order for drinks (the drinks took excessively long to come out).  It's true what the other reviews say about their fries- they are pretty good.  They seem to be freshly cut and are crispy.  The burger I had was just OK.  I actually was slightly disappointed in the size - it barely covered the bun.  The spinach and artichoke dip, as well as the crispy artichokes, were both delicious appetizers.  I would love the recipe for the dip because that's exactly how I like it.The prices were pretty reasonable - I believe our Bloody Marys and Mimosas were each under $7.",Ainsworth Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"

Unfortunately, this was not a stellar brunch experience. The menu was very small and there weren't any drink specials. We ended up getting 4 liter type pitchers of mimosas, which alone was $80. With so few options, our table primarily ordered the chorizo eggs benedict, with the others getting the ham and cheese omelette and a cesar salad. It was OK, but really nothing to write home about for $15. Service was OK as well. Our waitress was nice, but drinks came out slowly and we were given some dirty glasses with our drinks.  Decor is also interesting to say the least. It has a cute, rustic vibe, but there are TVs everywhere, making it more like a sports bar vibe.  For brunch, it just wasn't really the spot we had in mind.

I have been here two times and both times the service has been completely subpar. From the time we sat down it took us almost an hour to get our food and our second round of drinks took almost 20 minutes.  In total we were there for two hours for one course. We had neither appetizers nor dessert. My brother ordered a burger with cheddar and bacon and a burger came out with just cheese on it.  At which point he was told they do not make modifications to their menu items. If that was the case, (which I don't know why it would be) the waitress should have informed him of that when he was ordering.  It took another 25 minutes to get the check and actually pay because our waitress was nowhere to be found.  We almost missed our train home because it took so long. All of this happened when they weren't even full to capacity. There were many open tables around us. There is no excuse for this complete lack of courtesy and regard for people's time.

100,NWLqOKl0Vxi7qK-6EoBLbg,Brandon E.,2.0 star rating,"Underwhelmed and overpriced. That sums up my first and likely last experience at the Ainsworth. I enjoyed Little Town, I thought the food was good, but the service was always something to be desired. I will say our service at Ainsworth was very good but it can't up the rating because of the food and prices. But the layout is basically little town but no skee ball and with more subway tile and a ton of TVs, per every downtown bar. We came for a friends 30th birthday party, there were a bunch of us so they made the b-day party get a prix-fixe menu. The menu was this for $30...shared appetizers and a choice of one burger. The burgers there run $15 so we were paying $15 for sub-par app choices. The choices were Caesar salad, a veggie platter and a tiny spinach and artichoke dip. How do you expect 30 people to share Caesar salads (which were under-dressed and not great)? The veggie platter was a few veggies thrown on a cutting board with a few dipping sauces and what I would describe as a hummus like substance. The spinach and artichoke dip lacked flavor it needed to be seasoned. And it was tiny. For that cost the veggie platter was just pitiful. So 1 star for apps.I ordered the mac n' cheese burger because of other reviews on here. Meh would be the best way to describe it. The mac n' cheese was bland and flavorless and really added nothing to the burger. It was just an ok burger. I would never come here to spend 15 bucks on that burger. The fries however were good. For the $30 we paid we really got a few veggies and a meh burger. If you are going to force parties to have a prix-fixe then step up what  options are available. For 2 people with 4 beers it was $94. Not worth half that. Our waitress was very good and very on the spot, but the food and price point was no good.

NYC skyline right across the street, and they have their doors and windows open for you to enjoy, with outside seatings also. With that said, hubby and I went here for dinner on a Friday night. The wait for a table was super quick so we got seated right away. The place was big, not cramped however it was SUPER LOUD. It's like NJ sports bar meets hipster Brooklyn type restaurant. Not a bad spot, atmosphere was good, great decor and setting. I'm giving this a 4 star because of the loudness (couldn't hear a single word the waiter was saying) AND it took about 40 mins to get our food!! Not really great especially if you're running out of appetizers and drinks are priced like NYC clubs (very pricey). We ordered oysters, burrata burger (working on summer body so Mac and cheese burger will have to wait), and fish tacos. All were great! Burger was seasoned well, super juicy, and done just perfect. Must say, a great combo for the burrata and roasted peppers. Fish tacos were fresh and decent portioned. My hubby was obsessed over their fries and saying how fresh the oysters were!Everything was well prepared, fresh, and well seasoned. We also ordered the Roosevelt and Old Fashion cocktails and they were delicious and strong! Other than having to wait long for your food, I'd come back to try other things on the menu!

However, I realized that once this burger reached my presence, it wasn't up to the standard that I have originally imagined. The reason for this was because it was obviously not as cooked as I wanted it to be, and I felt that this wasn't up to my original expectations. However, a wonderful ""baldish"" server with hipster glasses rapidly deescalated the situation with his warm smile and hospitality.

After getting our table, the waitress took our drink orders which we did not get for another 45 minutes after. When we did finally get them, the waitress got the drink orders completely wrong. We let her know and she acknowledged and confirmed she would get us the right drinks promptly. Another 20 minutes pass by with still no drinks. We finally get them and they're the wrong drinks, AGAIN. We inform her and she replaces them again. Wait for the surprise - it's the same wrong drinks, for a 3rd time. At this point, we ask for a manager, who RUDELY comes over, picks up the drinks and brings back the correct ones. Slams the cups on the table and walks away without acknowledging that there are any problems or anything. Also took close to 45 minutes for the food to be served. Food wasn't even good quality either.Horrible service, overpriced food for crazy high prices.

I was not super impressed with the food here, but they did have a wide variety of fun burger combinations and definitely had space to accommodate a large group. To start, we ordered a little of everything. The buffalo cauliflower was my favorite and if you ever come here, you have to try it!! They also had really good tuna tartare, and the chips that they served it were killer too. As my main course, I had the burrata burger. It was only okay. The bottom of the burger was really soggy which made it hard to eat cleanly. The burrata itself was good, and I actually ended up eating just that and not the burger/bun.Half of the group ordered the mac and cheese burger, and they seemed overall happy with their choice but it was a bit heavy. Definitely has a fun bar vibe, and bar food.

Now I must say this review is solely about the bar. John is phenominal to say the least. My friend and I were going to go home but decided to just stop by for a drink. We ended up being there for 4 hours and eating. We started with the oysters which were plump and fresh. John offered to make oyster shooters for us which was awesome! Then my friend and I split the mac and cheese burger. Holy carb over load of deliciousness.... We ended with 3 different desserts (gelato  trio, cobbler, triple chocolate cake). The cobbler was by far one of the best. Overall, we had an amazing time and met people there because of John's ability to keep his crowd social.

The look of the bar was a lot nicer too.  The bottles on the display shelves were arranged in a not so haphazard way and backlighting makes it look a lot more inviting.When I got to the establishment around 11:30pm the area by the bar was crowded with several other patrons sitting at the tables.  There were people of all ages - from Stevens kids to mature adults - which was refreshing. It's nice when bars cater to all ages, not just the post frat-boy type. However, the bar seemed to empty out at 12:30am.  I'm not sure if the bar can sustain itself if clientele does not pack it until closing.

It was a Tuesday night and there were only 3 tables occupied in the dining room yet our food (3 salads and a pizza appetizer) took forever. The pizza came cold and the salads were luke warm. To make matters worse, they had a DJ in the back hosting a trivia night for 2 patrons. We had to listen to this guy talk into a microphone nonstop for 2 hours. He literally never stopped talking. It ruined the vibe of our night and was really annoying. To the credit our our waitress, who was really great, she had the kitchen remake the pizza (which was still awful) and ended up taking it off our bill.

She never did so we said to hell with this place and left. The second time we were seated promptly but our server was pretty much nonexistent. At one point I had to walk up to the bar to get a refill. So service alone I'd give this place 1 star at best. The food is good but no better than your average Hoboken sports bar, just fancier dishes and more expensive.

I try to give servers the benefit of the doubt, but she literally could care less about customer service or waiting on her tables in a timely fashion. Now I'm sure you're wondering, why return to an establishment if the service is that bad? My response: the food has always been pretty good. The straw that broke the camels back this time? The menu changed. The spinach and artichoke dip is gone and the shrimp tacos are also gone. I tried ordering the fish tacos and they did not have fish (on a Friday during peak dinner time, really?). Alcoholic beverages were also subpar. Ordered a Mr. Monroe and the second round didn't have Bulleit Bourbon in it. It tasted like bottom shelf Bourbon. I sent it back and our server returned with the same drink with the berries repositioned. Bourbon lovers know their Bourbon. I left the drink untouched on the table.

Happy they kept the interior pretty much the same because I've always liked the vibe. There's a lot less menu choices though.  App: none unfortunately because none got us super excited. Wish the rice balls from Little Town made it to this menu! I think they might need a few more app options to keep people coming back. Entree:Fish Tacos - Great presentation, pretty good. The slaw was the winner. Asked for the shrimp taco's garlic aioli on the side but the waitress said the chef might not want to do that (which was weird). They ended up giving it to us, the chef was right though, didn't really need it.  Still weird that it might've been an issue.Mac&Cheese Burger - Great presentation, and SOOO good! Had a fried mac&cheese ball in it AND topped with mac&cheese. It was probably a million calories but totally worth it. The mac&cheese was the amazeballs, I'd def get it as a side next time. Service was great, our waitress and the staff were very attending.   Def need some more menu choices, esp with the apps.

The past few days, I have called and spoken with the hostess and she has been helpful but she turned rude when I followed up with my inquiry. I know its not your responsibility as a restaurant to keep tabs on my personal belonging, but what kind of clientele do you have that would jack my stuff and go about their day, worse a staff member who would do that and not say anything!

Instead I went for the Turkey Burger and fries. The burger was substantial, well seasoned and very juicy. It was only topped with mayo and some arugala (which wasn't dressed in lemon vinaigrette as advertised) so I was missing an element of crunch. The fries were great. Thick cut, but not soggy and perfectly salted. I wish there were some alternative options for sides and condiments in lieu of ketchup here. My boyfriend had a bun-less Breakfast Burger which had a hash browns, bacon, cheese and fried egg.

I am not going to write a novel about my experience at Ainsworth. Rather, I'd like to share a few hints with the managment staff. 1. The hostess shouldn't be more interested in her text conversation than seating your customers. Particularly on opening week. 2. When there are paying customers who want to be seated... and there are seats available for them... Seat them! Believe it or not, people in Hoboken appreciate good service and aren't impressed when you make us wait outside. 3.  When the list of things you are ""sold out of"" accounts for 25% of the menu... Order more of those things. 4. I thought everybody knew this one but appetizers are supposed to come out BEFORE the meal. 5. If there are only 6 people at the bar and half of them are waiting on their check or another drink, that's a bad time for the bartenders (yes, there were 2 on shift) to leave the bar for 10 minutes.

169,5rL4OuhdE_ybWSzCvTWOPA,Rosie C.,1.0 star rating,"RUN. AWAY.I really hate to start a review with that negative comment, but I just can't help it. We had an awful, awful time here.I was really excited to try the Ainsworth--I had been to the 26th Street Ainsworth and had a great time. I was thrilled that the Ainsworth was setting up shop in Hoboken. So when my sister, brother-in-law, nephew, and cousins were in town, I thought it would be a great opportunity to give the Ainsworth a try.We made a reservation for 11am on Sunday, which was a great time for a group visit. The restaurant was pretty empty when we walked in, so we had room to spread out. All the staff were really nice and friendly. We were off to a good start.The trouble began when we ordered coffee. You'd think that coffee would be pretty easy to come by at brunch on a Sunday. When the already small cups came, they were half-full, which seemed weird. But nobody commented. A while later, after the three sips of coffee had been drunk, nobody came around for refills, so we asked for more coffee. It never arrived. After waiting patiently, and after seeing that no other patrons had coffee either, we asked again. Apparently one of the coffee makers was broken, there was some glitch, etc. I have no idea what it was or what happened, but you would think that breakfast coffee would be important enough for them to do something to fix it...or at least to communicate to diners what was happening before we had to ask.Our food took a ridiculously long time to come out, but when it did, it was fine. Not good. But fine. But my cousin's over-easy eggs were basically raw. She had to send them back to the kitchen and watch us while we ate our food. Now, I make a lot of eggs, and I know that over-easy eggs take about three minutes to make, so I'm not sure what took so long, but her food just never came out of the kitchen. We had all finished our meals at this point. My husband, who was extremely upset by all of these missteps by the Ainsworth, spoke to the manager, who assured us that her meal would be the ""next one out of the kitchen."" It wasn't. We saw plate after plate of food come out of the kitchen, but none of them were hers. After a heated second conversation with the manager, her meal finally arrived.To make up for these problems, the manager gave us half off our bill and a free round of mimosas, which was very nice of him. But honestly, I would have preferred to pay full price for a better experience. My last trip to Little Town, which was there before the Ainsworth moved in, was filled with similar problems. Apparently not much has changed. I might be back for a drink or two, but I will not return for a meal. Oh, and the cherry on top was that our waiter (who really was very nice), accidentally spilled the last mimosa all over my nephew's stroller. We didn't blame the waiter, but we couldn't help but laugh.Never again.",Ainsworth Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"

The service was downright HORRIBLE. Our waitress didn't know the specials and she came by twice to take our order and once the food was served she legit never came back. Wtf?!

Save yourselves from the aggravation of horrendous service. We came here two weeks ago for Sunday brunch. What should have been a simple easy thing turned into a nightmare.  The hostess was rude from the start with an attitude. Initially we were told 30 min wait, which was okay.  It took them over 2 hours to just seat us(party of 4).  Which I would understand if it was busy, but almost half the place was empty! So we were at the overpriced bar spending around $15 per drink and starving. Their reason for the delay was that the kitchen was backed up. But I just don't get how??? How can they be so disorganized and unprepared. Finally got seated, and still starving.  Didn't think it was possible but the service just continued to decline.  We had to ask for our water to be filled.  Couldn't find our waitress to place order, then plates weren't taken.  We initially did tell our waitress how long we waited and how unhappy we were.  Her response was ""oh"" that's it.  Food was okay, small portions.  Overall  experience was horrible.  Would never recommend anyone to come here.  How can a restaurant actually run like this???

Went with four others in need of some brunch on a sunny Sunday morning.We called prior to make sure there was space for five, and there was.  What the hostess failed to mention on the phone was that despite being listed on the website menu (and the actual menus themselves), they were not starting to serve brunch items until the following week.I understand you're a new spot, so the menu snafu is (kind of) understandable...but if you're lucky enough to catch would-be brunching customers before they head in, why wouldn't you mention there is no brunch to be had?  Seems like common sense.Sad we have to lunch it up, but forging ahead.  It is obvious that thought went into the plates/design.  Plates are slabs of wood resembling butchers cutting boards.  Fries are held in a cylindrical metal thingy.  Presentation is nice.  Food: Burgers were OK.  Meat could use some salt for sure.  The French Onion burger in particular became an unappetizing mess because the english muffin wasn't toasted well and couldn't stand up to the burger.  Soggy, unseasoned mush.  The fries were really good---but lukewarm at best...which was a let down.Lastly, I don't think an establishment that charges $14 per Bloody Mary should have servers wear tank tops so menus end up in their bare arm pits.  ...

I kind of wish I hadn't.Decor: The exterior, and the interior, of this place is fine. There is nothing unique about it and, actually, I feel like there could be a bit better use of the interior space (there seem to be half walls in strange places that close off parts of what could be a nice open dining area). While I'm glad they got rid of the ""arcade"" from the Little Town NJ days, not much else changed. Now, don't get me wrong, the decor is nice (semi-fancy, very clean lines and immaculately kept), there just isn't anything unique about it.Bathroom: Clean and also well-kept.Staff: The bartender was nice, rather attentive, and quick with making/serving drinks. However, and I'll get to this in my next paragraph, he messed up my order.Food: We started with beers, of which they have a decent selection (including Summer Shandy! Yes!), and then I stayed for a bite to eat. The menu remains as frustrating as Little Town's: not many choices, that don't compliment each other well, and nothing that jumps out at you as a ""gotta try it."" I went with the shrimp tacos, which came as three tacos and that's it - no side. I also ordered the mac 'n cheese (the only side that seemed to make sense for shrimp tacos... and that's saying A LOT since these two items don't go together at all!). The bartender parroted back my order to me to confirm and then put it in the computer. After a semi-long wait (granted, they were busy) I received my tacos - which were cold (and overall not really that tasty) - and no mac 'n cheese. Having already been annoyed at the menu itself, and the cold tacos, I decided to cut my losses and not ask about the mac (just see if it showed up on the bill). Thankfully it did not, but it is still odd given that he repeated my order and then immediately put it into the computer...Value: The prices are fine. Nothing outrageous, about what you'd expect, but given the overall experience I feel like I paid too much.Seeing that things have not changed much from Little Town NJ, except that those AMAZING 10 spice Wings are no longer on the menu!, I won't be returning for another meal.",Ainsworth Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"

The bar tables were very wobbly and small, and when we ordered food the plates barely fit on the table. We didn't have good service - it was spotty, and sometimes we got 2-3 different waitresses asking at the same time if we need drinks, and sometimes no one at all. The menu was smaller than I expected, esp in regards to apps, which is all I wanted. I ordered a mac and cheese burger instead of an app. That's the only reason why I gave it two stars - the burger was fantastic! Highly recommend it...much better than I expected. The other food everyone ordered was OK - nothing fantastic. Finally, the music was loud, and the crowd was very mixed.

We had 2 friends coming so we were eyeing tables to open up outside - one opened up but it was only a two top and we asked the hostess if she could take another table and push them together (there was plenty of room for her to do this). She said she couldn't because the tables have different waitresses so it would the table away from the waitress. Our friends came and wanted to sit at the bar so we asked for more stools. Unfortunately we were not allowed to take stools from the inside and bring them outside because they are ""designated inside stools"" for customers that weren't even there. There was a tub with bottles of water that was sitting on stool for outside tables and we asked to use that stool and they said no its for the water (because water needs a stool too). Finally a table opened up so we asked to transfer our tab from the bar to the table. Well... it was basically asking to do brain surgery as no one could figure out that we moved about 4 feet from the bar to the table. I ordered a drink at the table which never came, the waitress completely ignored us. It is probably one of the most unaccommodating restaurants I've ever been to. The food is nothing special either.

It was just cold, red wine, as it stood.The hangar steak burger was shredded hangar steak on a toasted bun, very good, a bit salty, and God I hope it wasn't loaded with MSG because I feel like I'm pretty revved up here tonight, and that's what MSG does...Makes things salty, tender, and leaves you feeling like a caffeine freak.  The fries, I gotta say, were THE BEST...When I asked for them well done, they came out CRRRUNCHY, not greasy, mushy or white... perfection...which is virtually impossible to find in Hoboken, other than at the new French bistro at the end of 1st Street, or Augustino's, and who can get in there?Service was very friendly, but pokey.

Lots of TVs, which was fine, and sort of expected in Hoboken.  Lots of b-ball games, golf, etc. Better than watching cricket at Pilsner, though Pilsner at night is gorgeous, all candle lit, with almost no electric lights.  Ainsworth could use a few less. Atmosphere.It lacks atmosphere.  Fewer lights might change the mood. Maybe the grid seating was modeling itself after the back streets of Hoboken, wasmy other thought.  Not too inspiring...Whats great about that?  Needs some loosening up, fewer tables, lighter colors,  maybe some fresh flowers to offset the green. Something more serene.  Most of ussit in offices all day and this place looks like ""The Office"" chain of restaurants.",Ainsworth Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"

The tuna tartare was pretty good but the breakfast burrito was small, came with no sides and was overall subpar. For $13 I would have expected a solid burrito with at least one side. We had a couple drinks which were average and our lunch turned into a nearly $100 affair. Highway robbery for what we received. The service was fine but overall we felt cheated by the food and drinks. The view was extremely nice, but there are many other places with just as good of a view on both sides of the Hudson.

We had an 11 month old with us and arrived 8 minutes late. We were greeted by the rudest hostess I have ever come across who tells me that she cancelled our reservation because we were 45 minutes late...surprising since we kindly came in earlier to accommodate the restaurant and were in fact 8 minutes passed 530pm. She seats us in the main dining room, when I mentioned that we had requested the private room she said you can't sit there because of a leak...we happily obliged again. She stomped off to chit chat with the bar tender and ignored us completely. We waited and waited for a server. We finally ordered and unfortunately what arrived to the table was luke warm mediocre food, my roast chicken was so salty it was inedible. I passed by the private dining room on the way to the bathroom and found that there was no leak at all just a room completely cluttered with Christmas decorations.

When there are four or five waitresses milling around and chatting with each other rather than getting my bill...well, I'm done. Last time I was here, I had to go up to a group of waitresses to ask for my bill, after having waited for 20-30 minutes. Seriously, who hires and trains these people?

We went around 2 in the afternoon and the restaurant was steady but I wouldn't describe it as busy. We were seated immediately due to the many open tables yet our order wasn't taken for a solid thirty minutes, even though we asked TWICE for our waitress. After our waitress eventually came over her response was ""sorry no one told me I got seated"" Shortly after us the table next to us was seated, served, and left before we even had our food. The food took forever to get to us and even though it was good, wasn't worth the wait or the price. If i'm going to be paying almost $20 for a burger I would like to not have to wait for over an hour on a non-busy day to receive it. After eating we had to wait another half hour for our check? When we got our check it was wrong, there was other people's food items on it which took another fifteen minutes to get fixed. When she came back to give us the right check we were throwing our credit cards at her praying we would be able to get out of there soon. Throughout the entire time we were there I never saw our waitress serve a table around us, she was constantly missing and lacked attention. The entire experience was just a big long wait. The food was delicious and if it wasn't for the awful service I would have liked to go back but i'm not willing to have to dine for almost three hours for a hamburger.

I was hoping that some formidable establishment and management team would take over the space Little Town once occupied until it fell flat on its face. Basically you have the same problems now as you did before. I showed up the first week it was open for lunch and was told the wait was 40 minutes and there were about 40 tables available. I think this was a ""hype move"" to make it seem like this place was so popular it was worth the wait. It isn't. My girlfriend went to this place last Saturday for drinks with her friends to watch the derby and they ordered another round as the horses crossed the finish line and they were told that they wouldn't serve them that they were to exit, pay the cover for the fight which was at 11:30 and they would re seat them but they had to close out. Ridiculous.  My friend and his girlfriend came last week for lunch and drinks, waited for 20 minutes for ANY service whatsoever to no avail and then finally left. The food is pretty good so that's why they are getting 1 star. That and Yelp won't let me give them negative stars. The final straw was I came back to give it one last chance on a weekday for a drink.  The restaurant had maybe 10 people in it. I was the only one at the bar and I witnessed a couple sit down at the bar, they were given menus, and after 10 minutes of no one coming back they left as they should. I've never given a place more chances than this one and they continue to disappoint.There are many other great places to bring your money, don't give it away here for nothing in return. @ management.. The pretty view won't keep you in business if you run an establishment like this.

I finally went there on 7/5 and it is now called Ainsworth.  the hostess didn't think we could use the coupon and got the manager John.  he said he would not honor my deal.  I said I called and was told yes at the beginning of the year.  he again said no because oysters are $3 each and it would cost him too much to honor my deal.  I asked him how that was my problem and said the owners shouldn't put offers online they can't honor.  (I can't confirm this because no pricing is provided online for raw bar items).  I was furious but he wouldn't budge.  he offered us drinks and an app on the house which I flatly refused.  if we had ordered the most expensive app ($19) and 2 whiskies ($22) it would have cost him $41 so why not just honor my coupon?  had he done the right thing we would have definitely stayed for lunch and he would have made all his money back and then some.it's terrible customer service like this that will no doubt be the demise of this place.  I read other online reviews and most said terrible service.  in a competitive market like Hoboken filled with hipsters they should be bending over backwards to ensure customers come back.  unfortunately when they close they won't have a clue why they weren't successful.,Ainsworth Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"

Went to Little Town a few times for multiple reasons (events, birthdays, etc.) and each time it was *bad*.. The first time at Little Town my girlfriend got horrible food poisoning. In addition, they couldn't keep the place AC controlled (I remember seeing the thermostat at 80+ degrees), the bathrooms were always broken and had a bathroom attendant (I mean, how douchey can you get), half the taps didn't work, and place was in general disarray even though it was only one a year to two years tops?Why all the comments about Little Town, you ask? Well I assumed, if they were going to pull back, reset, and start fresh with Ainsworth, I figured they'd get their food, facilities, service, management, together... I am in disbelief. These people are incapable of managing a restaurant. Our friends were holding a birthday last night so we decided to give it yet another chance with a clean slate, and have dinner beforehand. Service was horrendous-- our waitress would take 20-30 minutes before she even checked in-- she walked by us about 10 times ignoring us. It was clear no one had  a clue what they were doing. We both got a burger.. Mine medium, hers  medium rare. Her burger came back raw. No exaggeration, I was afraid she would get sick if she ate it-- dark red. I  had to flag down a bus boy for them to heat it up since our waitress was nowhere to be found. Overall the food was super greasy and unimpressive. I know i come off as a complainer with th is review, but I'm just not that person. I always try to give the benefit of the doubt but this place and management has just let us down too many times. Bill was pricey at over 75 bucks, too.After our meal, it was time for the birthday event that was scheduled and  reserved in advance for apparently 30+ people. They clearly had  no plan to accommodate us and put us in a corner with no room at all; everyone was  clearly pissed off and shocked at this... It's not like we came in without a  reservation or heads up. Then, they moved us to a different booth after about 20 minutes.. Not much better. Again I get that it's two weeks into opening and they were crowded but they should have told them they couldn't accomodate that big of a party. No one was pleased and we left shortly after the ""surprise"" entrance. Last but not least, the bathroom had a broken urinal (they couldn't fix this sh*t after two years and a new grand opening?) and a bathroom attendant which is just awkward and everyone hates. This isn't the W. When it filled up later in the night I was sweating yet again because they're incapable of increasing the AC.I Will be adding this bar / restaurant to the ""places I will never ever go to"" list in Hoboken. This list only has one other place, 1 Republik. If you like shit service, crowded cramped layout, average at best  food w a chance  of food poisoning, and to hang out with a bunch of douchebag bros, this is your spot.

Both items were placed somewhere in the menu so she just asked if she  put them together. The waitress said she wasn't sure if she could do that but would ask.  She came back a few minutes later and said it could not be done.

No one is rude, it just seems like they are seriously lacking training. I gave them a few tries and have consistently been unimpressed.

Don't call yourself a ""gastropub with craft cocktails"" if you can't even add vodka to a vodka soda. Paid $9 for water. Changed to a Pinot grigio - I'm not a wine snob and am not the type to ever send a drink back, but for another $9, this crap wasn't drinkable. Tasted like it had either been open for a month or the whole bottle cost $3. I'm talking worse than Barefoot. Didn't order a cocktail and after that experience wouldn't have, so can't speak for those of food. I give the 3 stars because the waitress was really nice and upgraded my wine to a decent wine (but couldn't I have had that the first time?) , and because the space was really nice.

After reading a lot of bad reviews, I was very hesitant to try this place out especially because I hated everything about it's predecessor Little Town. I never bothered to review Little Town because the food, service and overall experience could only be described as crap. Anyway, back to Ainsworth... They didn't change the interior too much but just enough to make it look less divey. For a Tuesday night, it appeared they had a decent amount of people. Looked more like a date night crowd. Our server was very sweet and bubbly. Knowledgeable of the menu and helpful with suggestions. My only issue and this is maybe me just being a woman but the uniforms look cheap and dont match the new decor. The tight tank and tighter black pants just didnt fit the new vibe of this restaurant. Maybe save that for the late night weekend crowd. As far as the important stuff goes, food & drink, I was pleasantly surprised. I tried their cocktail the crooked knife which is jalapeno infused Avion tequila, lemon juice and agave garnished with a red chili pepper. I could only have one but this was a great cocktail. Beware of that first sip though I almost spit fire. For an app we got the tuna tartare which was very fresh and flavorful. For dinner,  I got the fish tacos they were 3 nicely proportioned soft tacos with generous portions of blackened fish, mango salsa and slaw. My friends got salads, the thai kale and a chicken caesar, they both enjoyed. My one friend didnt like the kale in the caesar but other than that no complaints. We also split the cauliflower, broccoli fried egg side dish which was interesting but tasty none the less. I would definitely be interested to try Ainsworth out again on a weekend dinner or brunch to see if there's a big difference in service and food quality.",Ainsworth Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"

Our burgers get taken away (each only one bite in) and our bill comes. They charged us for everything! So I called the manager back and demanded that she remove our uneaten burgers from our bill. She says, ""I didn't realize you hadn't finished eating"" as if that makes it okay to charge us for this horrifying experience. Our bill comes back and we are still charged for our 2 beers and order of wings.

It took forever to get a server and we noticed three other tables had to continuously flag down someone to ask for a server. I wonder if the hostess doesn't tell servers once they have a table or if there are no sections? The waiter, busboy, etc. were all very nice, but just not good service - a long wait for everything.

After being seated, it was 20 minutes before a server came over to greet us and to take our order. We ordered a Caesar salad to start and it was very bland and tasteless. Also, after we ordered, we overheard the people next to us ordering and when they asked for coffee, they were told that it would take 15 minutes or more for it to brew and that since people at other tables hadn't received coffee they ordered earlier, it would be unlikely that they too would receive coffee in a timely manner. No coffee at brunch?! Now that's a deal breaker if I ever heard one. The server was unaccommodating and appeared to care very little that his patrons weren't able to receive coffee with their brunch. To top it off, the coffee they ordered never arrived. When our entrees were finally brought over, after at least a 40 minute wait, the hanger steak burger and pork sandwich were both dry and lacking flavor. Our server never once came over to check in on us and ask if we needed anything. When we were finally tired of waiting for him to stop by, I had to make a great effort to flag him down to get the check. When this establishment was Little Town the service was efficient and the food never disappointed. My advice to the Ainsworth is if you would like to stay in business, the service is in desperate need of being revamped, with an emphasis on customer-centered service.

That said, I can get started. Oh also, i write long reviews, deal.Came with some friends to catch the Ranger/Penguin's game, to have a few drinks as well as dinner. They told my friend who called earlier in the day that they weren't taking reservation but we could come early to put our names down and try to nab a table - in addition, they put us down for a 9 PM reservation which was confusing since I thought they weren't taking them?Anyway..We got there around 7:30 checked in, added our name to the ""list"" in case any tables opened, and grabbed some drinks from the bar. Approximately 14 tables in the restaurant were open. We were able to stand outside and drink and get drinks from the bar without a problem. Despite there being open tables throughout the space, we didn't sit until our 9 PM reservation rolled around... That's when the problems started. We sat down and we were greeted by a waitress asking what type of water we wanted. We told her tap was fine and she scampered off to tell a bus boy and said she'd be back to take our drink order. Fifteen minutes go by. No water. No drink order. She finally returns, appalled our water hasn't come out yet and runs away to get us water. Eventually she takes our order, we order drinks, apps and our meals all at the same time. Approximately 10 minutes later she comes back with our drinks and informs us they are out of Coors Light, which someone in our party ordered. We asked for a drink so an alternative can be picked. She disappeared and never brought over a menu.  Ten minutes passed and we finally got a menu (taken from another waitress passing by), the waitress came back over took the one remaining drink order and returned promptly slamming the new drink on the table. We sit and wait, and wait some more, finish our drinks, but the waitress is nowhere to be seen to place another drink order. We contemplate ordering directly from the bar... About 35-40 minutes after we placed our order or dinner comes out (still no drinks). Yes. Our dinner. Didn't they order apps you say? Why yes. Yes. We did. Dinner came out before our apps. We inform the food runners and cause a lot of confusion. The manager quickly comes over to apologize for the mix up and says he'll send dinner back and get us our apps. We still have no drinks and our waitress is MIA. Dinner goes back and about 5 minutes go by. Waitress still doesn't come over, nothing. We have no drinks, we have no food. Someone in our party went up to the manager to ask where she was. The manager came back over, took our drink order and apologized. Three minutes later, waitress reappears to take the drink order the manager just took.Apps come out, they were fine. We finish them, get our drinks and wait about 20 more minutes for dinner. Dinner comes, everyone ordered the fish tacos and a side of fries. The tacos were LOADED and I mean LOADED with salt. The fries were also LOADED with salt and cold. The manager came over after we had finished eating to ask how the meal was. We say fine, he asks if we can have anything else and I request the check. He politely tells us everything was taken care of since ""so many things have gone wrong"" and hopes that we'll return, ""in 2-3 weeks when things will be straightened out."" Mind you, still haven't seen our waitress. I do love a good free meal but after this disappointment, I won't be going back. The manager said he was in from the corporate office and noted there had been some management changes. We also noticed the tables around us were having issues with the service. When the manager asked if we needed anything else I told him we didn't but I was pretty sure the ladies next to us needed to have their order taken as they had been sitting there for 30 minutes and were ignored. The manager was apologizing to more tables that anyone should in one night, we left wondering how much money the bar lost that night. All that said, it's a disappointment that I know this place will do well regardless of it's awful service and food. People who come to Hoboken for the night will keep going back because it's cool and trendy. Oh well.",Ainsworth Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"
286,WLxvbc1x6sKTEAiPTiUHZw,Jo B.,1.0 star rating,"If I could give zero stars I would. Came here on a MONDAY afternoon around 1:00 for lunch. We basically had to seat ourselves outside as we were ignored for a good 5-7 minutes. Finally got menus and ignored again. The waitress walked past our table at least 7 times before acknowledging us. Took our drink order and disappeared for another 10 minutes for a simple ice tea and water. May I mention that it was not busy at all, maybe 6 tables all at different points in their meal!  Our drinks were finally delivered and was told she would be right back to take our order. Never returned. Awful awful. Service is everything in the restaurant business and in this town you need this to survive. Finally walked up to the hostess to complain. It had been 40 minutes since we had been seated and no order taken. She kindly took our order and then messed it up in the system. The waitress NEVER approached our table again. Never apologized. The manager finally came over and did the right thing. With all the amazing places to eat in this town would never ever give them a dime of my hard earned money. They will not make it long. Service is disgusting.",Ainsworth Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"
287,qiEWzrGh_USTHGZrhp3AoA,Maggie B.,3.0 star rating,"Just meh. Went here on a date for some drinks and ended up ordering the chicken and fries appetizer- I would say mediocre at best. Definitely overpriced but I won't give two stars given that was the only food we got. Drinks weren't very strong and the service was just okay. I'd give it one more try because everyone's food around us looked and smelled amazing (the burger in particular). Also, I just love the outside seating with the waterfront view.",Ainsworth Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"

We were very excited for Ainsworth to open, but were very disappointed.  The two bartenders were clueless and forgetful.  One bartender actually started pouring my beer, left it there, and five minutes later I needed to remind her to serve it to me.  Then after we sat at a table for over ten minutes without seeing our waitress once, we decided to leave and go elsewhere.  Unfortunately, we left very unhappy.",Ainsworth Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"
289,kTe5dMtUxFTDwDHlKoZl4A,Kiara C.,2.0 star rating,"Very disappointed with this place. We walked in mid-afternoon, the outside tables were full so we assumed it the place must be good, but once inside we could attribute the outside crowd to be due to the amazing weather rather than the location, because the inside was relatively empty. Even though the the inside was empty we were sitting down for at least 10 minutes before we even got water. My boyfriend ordered a beer and the fish tacos, and I ordered a mojito and brunch nachos. The drinks came quickly, and the mojito was pretty good. So two stars for the bartender and for the waitress because she was okay too. But once the food came I knew there was trouble. My nachos were drowned in sour cream.  The sour cream wasn't mentioned on the menu, otherwise I would've known to order without it. I tried excavating through them to eat the things I like, but hey had missed the bacon which was mentioned on the menu. Once pointed out I was brought a plate of bacon, but the nachos were already non edible. My boyfriend's fish tacos, were a little disappointing too. The fish did not taste very fresh.",Ainsworth Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"
290,WCRUVb_V76lNGpYrYLy6Hg,Joseph C.,1.0 star rating,"I thought little town was bad, well it has met it's match. Painsworth is pretty awful in almost every way. First off its way over priced for drinks and some food items, especially since you don't get either in any sort of timely manner. We ran out of chips for our minute portion of spinach and artichoke dip and asked for more and besides the fact we never received them they wanted to charge us for them as a separate side dish. The service is terrible, I know some people read this and think well maybe it was just that one time but read the reviews it's a trend this place sucks. Every keg was kicked and instead of telling us they were out of the beer the pedestrians brought something else to hide hide the fact and never asked us if we'd want something else. Do not order your burger med rare, it will be rare like really rare. Overall no matter what I say her this place will not survive the summer, it's impossible unless they change every aspect of their operation.",Ainsworth Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"
291,vpSIOYhwPKT6MjeRC1vijw,Tiffany X.,1.0 star rating,Went there for dinner tonight and the food was horrible. We had the spinach dip and buffalo wings the buffalo wings were soggy no taste and the spinach dip was very small for $12. We ordered a classic burger which was nothing special and the lamb sliders which the taste was very strong and I mentioned it to the waitress and she didn't say anything back at all ... All she did was smile and told us to let her know if we needed anything ... I would not go there to eat every again,Ainsworth Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"

293,neaZITP_11XvrQd46LaAVQ,Catie C.,1.0 star rating,"Do not come here. Staff is incredibly rude and inattentive. Our large party rented out the table in the side room, we were ignored for hours at a time by our waitress. Impossible to get drinks or food. Ended up ordering ourselves from the miserable bartender. The GM has no idea what he's doing and was avoiding making eye contact with our table as well once he realized we were pissed, instead of coming and trying to smooth things over. When the time came for the check, we had to ask about 6 or 7 times over the course of an hour for it. They finally brought it to us when everyone from our table, fed up, put on our coats and headed for the door. On top of that the food is crap and they run out of their beers on tap just like LittleTown did. Spend your money elsewhere.",Ainsworth Hoboken,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (New)"

295,wbdDSckRqGKn1r-yJtBqlg,Rob D.,2.0 star rating,"I must say, after growing up in New York and going to the Ainsworth and Ainsworth Park in the city a lot, I was pretty disappointed with this place. I was willing to give this place a pass since I went right after it opened, but clearly they have some service issues. As I got there, there were many tables available (during March Madness) and asked if we could be seated. The hostess said yes but in about 2 hours they will need the tables. Fine, no problem with that. I ordered drinks and the Chicken sandwich from our server who was really flustered and overwhelmed. She was good though, and attentive, just seemed very stressed out, no biggie though. My issue was after we finished we were politely asked to leave our table so we did, and stood by the bar watching the basketball games. I still paid mind to the table area to see if anyone was going to be seated. After an hour after we got up, 3 tables in our area were unused. I don't know if there was a cancellation or what, but we were rushed out of our table for what seemed like no reason. The bar got crowded, and the TV situation wasn't really optimal for watching a game, so I left. I will say the bartenders were very nice and attentive, as were the servers.

The prices are way too expensive, our waiter  paid no attention to us and my friend found a long hair in her food. On top of it the menu said our tacos were corn but they gave us flour. Wouldn't be a big deal but I have a gluten allergy and can't eat wheat. I told the manager who looks like a 19 yr old kid and he was apologetic but did not do much to rectify. They took some things off of our bill but the experience was still ruined.
