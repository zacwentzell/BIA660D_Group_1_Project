I used to have a good time here but this Saturday, while celebrating my brother's birthday, we were treated HORRIBLY. The service was awful with bartenders that were clearly not well trained and not experienced with how to efficiently serve a busy bar. It took FOREVER for the women in the party to get drinks, from the female bartender. My sister had her tab open and when she went to close it at bar closing she had a ridiculous tab with drinks that she did not order. The bartender claimed that people in our group put them on her tab. Even if that was the case, WHICH IT WAS NOT because these were our closest friends, some of the drinks NO ONE ON OUR SIDE OF THE BAR ordered. I don't drink and was 100% sober, therefore I am CERTAIN that no one anywhere in our vicinity ordered some of the drinks that wound up on my sister's tab. My sister, who was drinking but by no means drunk, attempted to talk to the bartender and then the manager with no resolve. To make matters worse, when our friend tried to help my sister, calling the bartender ""ma'am"" and trying to calm the situation, the bartenders became extremely aggressive and confrontational subsequently, kicking him out. To further add insult to injury, the bartender told my sister she should ""keep better company"". We have a diverse group of wonderful friends. We were spending a large amount of money and  not causing any trouble at all yet my poor sister and our friends were treated with no respect or courtesy at all. This was not the way my brother wanted to end his birthday nor the way my sister wanted to end her night. Wicked Wolf essentially tried to con my sister out of money and even if this was other random patrons putting drinks on her tab the staff should have been more knowledgeable of how to rectify this situation.

We called later that evening/ early morning at around 2am (when the bar was closed) and there was no sign of it. The very next day, we made another trip out to Wicked Wolf to check to see if we could find it in the bar and there was no sign of it. We continuously called in the beginning of December, mid December and at the end of December and there was no sign of the wallet. On January 8th she received a Facebook message from the bar saying they found her wallet (of course without cash). We were incredibly annoyed by the situation because 1) we were told the bar had been checked and the wallet wasn't there multiple times (our guess is someone put it in a back office or something) 2) for whatever reason staff clearly overlooked the wallet 3) when we spoke to the manager he was very nonchalant and dismissive when we explained to him we've been calling for over a month and staff told us the wallet wasn't there.

I guess it depends on what you're looking for in your experience. What I like most about Wicked Wolf are the following 3 things: location, trivia, and specials. Wicked Wolf has a beautiful sky-line view, so if the weather is nice you can sit outside or go across the street to take a leisurely walk by the water. They have trivia on Wednesday nights, where you can purchase beer towers and other specials. I'm not sure if this is every week, but this past Sunday they had free Bingo, and who doesn't love 1. Bingo and 2. Free prizes? If you're coming for the food, it's average. I haven't been here for a full-blown meal, but I've tried several of their wraps (Blackened chicken this past Sunday), and they're pretty decent. Nothing out of the ordinary, but yummy. The fries are thin, similar to fast food-style fries. Night time at Wicked Wolf is typical for the bar scene in Hoboken. It does get crowded, as most places do in that area. You can win open bar specials for you and your friends for a future night out by filling out a form when you're there.",Wicked Wolf Tavern,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

Went on Wednesday, 9/21 and was seated outside. When I went to order the usual Tito's/soda I was told they don't have it which immediately confused me. I told the waitress that I've ordered it there just days before to which she replied ""that's impossible"". What a response. She riddled off the other vodkas but I was still caught up on the impossible part. I reassured her that I there this past Saturday, gotten Tito's at this very place for which she did not believe me and told me I was wrong. I told her about my allergies and she gave me a look that I was full of crap. Then I told her I can have certain vodkas which includes Tito's, because its made with corn. She proceeded to tell me ""No, its not, its made with potatoes"" (which is wrong). Again confused we stared at one another like morons until she got offended by me questioning the fact that they all of sudden didn't have Tito's and what its made from. She then said ""I could just disappear if you don't want to order from me"", to which I ignored and waited patiently for my friend to come back from the bathroom to decide if we wanted to stay or go. Not sure what I was more alarmed by. Her attitude towards me, her matter-of-factly telling me what Tito's is made from or the fact that they relay false information to people have allergies or dietary restrictions.

Absolutely stunning. Since it was a Monday night, the place did not have too many people inside, however, being the ""old lady"" I am, I really didn't mind that at all.The inside is pretty big. It had quite a few large flat screen TVs throughout the entire place. Pretty convenient, especially when watching a football game. Has quite a few seats at the bar, tables and even booths.I thought the five booths along the right hand side of the bar were pretty darn cool because each booth has its own personal mini TV.

Always good information to know!

Great place to bring a huge group of people without feeling like you've taken over the entire place. Awful place to have a conversation. The ambiance is plan old sports-bar. Tons of 20-something year old guys in backwards hats chugging beers and scanning the room. The servers were all girls in tank tops. Im sure this place will get extremely busy during peak times - if you love that kind of show, this may be your place.Between the noise of frat-boys (or still-stuck-in-frat-boy-land, rather) and the roar of the games all over the tv screens (it was Sat - college football) - I couldnt hear my friend shouting from directly across our table. We got one of those large beer things and I got wine. My wine was fine but the guys said the Coors Light dispenser tasted weird. Either watered down or plasticy... Normally these guys dont complain much, so I'm sure something wasnt right there.We ordered some food - our waitress was kind enough to keep our tab separate (we went to someone's birthday and it was like.. 20 people). We got a few kinds of sandwiches, fried pickles, and chicken tenders. The fried pickles were... mediocre? The dipping sauce seemed thin and from a bottle, and the coating didnt really hold tight to the pickle. the guys didnt say anything about their sandwiches or offer a bite... when i asked how it was, I got a shrug and ""well, I was hungry."" I did steal a few fries and they were bland, cold, and just all around unimpressive. my girl friend and I split the chicken fingers after thinking of each getting our own order. Im glad we split - those things were rubbery inside and rock hard outside. The batter for the chicken was so crunchy (not in a good way) that if you have a loose tooth, you'd have a gone-tooth after eating those things. The oil it was fried in tasted... old. a bit of a plastic taste maybe? Again - we were all starving so we ate, but I was seriously disappointed that this was the place the birthday person selected.Probably a fine place for people who are hard of hearing and need loud volume on their game that just want to catch a game and have a pint, but I definitely wouldnt put this on my short list of go-to places.",Wicked Wolf Tavern,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

The food is decent bar food. Nothing to complain about but it isn't anything to brag about either. Wednesdays are fun, Wicked Wolf runs trivia well. Always has some good quality prizes from iPads to concert or sports tickets.  They do raffles, give away beer towers...it's a fun time. Weekend nights can be fun too, more of the dance/DJ/music night scene. Not my favorite bar to go to on a Friday/Saturday night unless I get picked for a free Happy Hour.  You put your name on a card and a week or a two later you randomly get selected for a free happy hour from 9pm-11pm and your friends get half off.

I still danced my ass off; barely any room to do so, since the dance floor is packed just like the rest of the place, but what do you expect on a Friday night.This seems like a pretty solid place to come and meet people.

I don't think I've ever been treated so poorly at any food or drink establishment in my life. At 1:51 the patrons were told the bar is closing in 4 minutes. At 1:55 we were all unceremoniously shoved out the door, with many patrons still trying to figure out how to get home. A girl in our group asked politely ""doesn't your website say you close at 3?"" and indeed Google, yelp, and other online sources say this. The door bouncer rudely replied that ""we're open until closing time."" Another member of the group was struggling to quickly finish his drink and told the bouncer who was literally kicking us off our table to give us a few seconds just to finish the last third of the drink. Bouncer replied that Yeah he sees that and doesn't care because he wants to go home. I'm sorry buddy, but this is your job. Don't bounce at a bar if you care so much about your beauty rest. I'm sure the nurse at the hospital is more stressed bout her job than you are, and the cashier at McDonald's hates his job more than you hate yours, but these employees don't childishly take it out on their customers. At every other bar anyone one of us has been to, we have been given ample warning, usually about half an hour, between last call and closing time. I figure this is just common courtesy to give people a chance to sort out their rides, say goodbye to friends, etc. Not so here. And it's not even as though the place was so crowded or full of obnoxious people that they really needed to kick us out so rudely. There were less than 20 of us there total. The worst part, however, was being physically pushed out the door as if we were belligerents. Last night the weather consisted of windy, sub-50 degree freezing rain. One girl, not in our group, petite / a little over 5 feet tall, and very underdressed for the weather, was trying to figure out her transportation in the entrance vestibule. She was physically pushed out the door and unto the rain, phone still in hand. As we wait outside for our ride, we looked in through the windows like orphans on Christmas to see the bartenders casually counting the night's money at a table. Why they couldn't just let us wait ten minutes for our rides by the entrance while they did this is beyond me. I understand that this establishment looks like a decent place to spend some time right by the water. I doubt Wicked Wolf will ever really run out of customers looking for a nice drink or dinner, so maybe they just don't care if they alienate some customers.

After all, I had many good times at the New Haven Wicked Wolf during my time up there - nothing too fancy, but good music, good dancing, and cheap drinks.I've really tried to find the upside in the Hoboken WW, but try as I might, it's just not very fun. I've gone on different days, at different times, and the result is always the same - a half packed bar (+1 star for not being overcrowded), with maybe 5 people dancing (and all 5 of them came as a group).  That's it. The rest are just standing around watching the tv screens, or just sitting. Music is actually decent, but the type of crowd that it attracts isn't very fun...just your stereotypical Hoboken crowd (the icing was the last time I went, one bro bumped into another bro and got into a fight. When the bouncer asked him to stop, the bro tried to fight the bouncer. lol).With so many bars packed into such a small town (and with tons of other options even on Sinatra Drive), this one is a definite miss.

136,ZfgDeRqgrQkGPNaH0IOegw,Jessy R.,1.0 star rating,"""A picture is worth a thousand words""Unfortunately for one young and ignorant bartender, one word was enough.  During an outing in Hoboken on Saturday night, I decided to introduce my friend to the Wicked Wolf Tavern on Sinatra Drive. The location is perfectly situated and its beautiful scenic makes great for a day out. But, beware of what lurks behind the bars. As we sat at the bar and order our drinks, a pleasant conversation about the World Cup sparked between my party and the bartender.  I was soon distracted by the customer at the end of the bar who was attempting to get the attention of another bar tender (Caroline), whom was too busy on her cell phone. I felt that it was my responsibility to redirect the bartender we were speaking with to acknowledge the customer at the end. It was distressing to see what potential challenges I would need to deal with if I remained there.  As my party and I continued celebrating our day out and snapping pictures.  Caroline the (Bartender) walked behind our group and took a glance at our picture, as she walked away assuming no one heard her she negatively commented on the picture. I was appalled at what Caroline had said but most important I was disappointed that Wicked Wolf tavern would allow such ignorance to work at its establishment.  I immediately finished my drink and left the location.  This was my second and last time attending this place. Aside from the View that Sinatra drive offers, this place is no gem. They offer no happy hour on a Saturday, poor service, and if you go during the week you may not find sitting, or space and will most like have to wait for a table. If you are looking for a GREAT TIME with people who are not obnoxious I recommend you try Texas Arizona on River Street instead.

It wasn't my idea to come here.First major criticism: I have never in my life heard of a sports bar charging a cover to watch a sports event on TV. This has to be the most asinine thing I've ever experienced. Do we get a T-shirt? Do we get anything? Oh, no, you just get to come in and watch said sports event. Oh, excellent, okay. Food is typical bar fare, the kind good enough to coat the stomach for a long night of drinking and fumbling attempts at picking up women. There were a lot of those. I wouldn't expect much in the area of food, but it will probably be enough to keep you happy. Our group - the ones that were hungry- ordered nachos, wings, and fried pickles. All looked good. Nachos a little bland.The crowd was an immediate flashback to college, but, by all appearances, these patrons are far too old to still be doing this. The group of dancing drunk girls was entertaining, while the bros who scoffed as our waitress when they were asked to move their coats so they we might reserve a table were a preview of what was to come. It's the kind of atmosphere where the bro-tension is palpable, where you feel like if you say excuse me or reserve a table where bros have congregated, someone may try to fight you. Rudeness and classlessness are a prerequisite and come with the cover charge. We actually witnessed a guy and a woman attempt to befriend us so that they could hustle our food from us. The guy just reached across the table and helped himself to the bountiful plate of wings. At the end of the time there, without even really engaging with these people, Drunk Blonde Waif Girl actually stuck her skinny, gross finger into some wing sauce and went to town on it, licking the sauce of her finger and double dipping into a perfect stranger's leftover food scraps.If you are going here with a certain level of enthusiasm for a sports event that you want to see and you have the time, the money, and the space to enjoy yourself, politely and semi-responsibly, while you watch, the place could really be great, even epic, but maybe just not between the hours of 9 and midnight on a Saturday night where the vibe just totally changes into something on the level of a crowded frat party, plus the bartenders, minus the roofies, and including the multitude of poor decisions by women wearing too much makeup and dudes with popped collars.",Wicked Wolf Tavern,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

After the second round of drinks were served by the lady, our original server showed up with a poker face and gave us some lame excuse. We were still okay but this was repeated again.

I had asked if we could move the times to be 10pm-12am but they said no. So I told them that we would be there at 10pm. When we got there, there was a line and they wouldn't let us go in even though they'd lured us there with drink specials. They didn't let anyone in (despite a number of people leaving) until 10:50. This meant that by the time we even got to the bar, the special happy hour they promised would no longer apply. I texted the girl who told me I won this ""prize"" and she told me that they encourage people to get there by 9pm or earlier. Funny, no one encouraged me to do anything but come and spend money.

187,ZelfgwhgMtkFK_nPCI780g,Katia L.,1.0 star rating,"Where do I begin? Lets just say, the only two things that were good about this place were the beautiful night sky above the outdoor seating/patio  and the 15% off Yelp Check-in coupon which, by the way, should have been a 'comp' for all that my friend and I had to tolerate while visiting this establishment.It was Friday, July 4th (a Friday night) around 9pm. You would assume that proper consideration would have been  made with regards to staffing since it was a) a weekend night b) a holiday c) a waterfront restaurant d) clear skies (no rain) for outdoor seating. We arrived and were directed to sit BY THE BOUNCER. No hostess in sight. We sat for a good 10-15 minutes before receiving menus during which time a female server came by to ask about drinks (odd way of saying 'welcome to the hippest bar in town') and we had no drink menu to pick from; since we were famished we just ordered chips and dip with the drinks to get us by. We started to browse the menu and, at this point, I remembered my Yelp check-in and discovered a 15% coupon- funny thing is? When you open the coupon a countdown begins, allotting you 3 hours to use the coupon. Because of this nifty gadget, I was able to track that it took 18.5 minutes to get our drinks. They brought them one at a time (part of 2) which in my opinion is rude but okay, to each his/er own philosophy. The appetizer arrived way before the drinks and we had nothing to chase down with, no water, no napkins to wipe nacho cheese off chins, hands, etc. AND the dips were totally covered in a heat film (you know the sight- when you can see that its been sitting under a burner for hellish eternity). And- for 8 bucks?- not worth a dime. Cheese cold, guacamole not fresh (from the bag), and salsa (well you cant mess up something out of jar now can you). The entire time of our ordering and asking for water and for napkins, etc we got the strangest attitude from the server- like she was 'in the weed's and we were bothering her. I was so ticked off after a while that I went inside to find the hostess and ask to cancel our food order (ive never done that!). After saying half of my 'I want to leave' speech, the girl looks up and, lo and behold, our server is standing behind the hostess desk! Taking a moment's pity on her I told her, 'listen ive worked in hospitality too and I know the speed of the kitchen and the understaffed situation (if that was the case) is NOT your fault, however, I don't want to even eat what I ordered anymore...my friend and I are upset....i took her out for a nice birthday meal and...plain and simple...its not good."" She said she'd bring over the check and I walked back to the table. 5-10 MINUTES LATER!!!!!....she comes back WITH OUR FOOD IN HAND. (Seriously?!) No manager, no apology, no discount, no 'recovery' tactic as they say in the hospitality world, puts the food down in front of us and says, ' I know you said you wanted to cancel your order but its ready so can you just like eat it?"" Why I agreed to eat it I'm not sure, maybe because I was embarrassed at this point. We bitterly eat some of the cold, overcooked, not tasty meal (I'm actually cringing as I write this from the memory) and no one comes over to check on us, refill our drinks, apologize, ask how it tastes, etc. (did the manager call out, too?) AND, in the end, we end up paying full price except for the 15% coupon!!! Like, seriously? I'm mind-boggled. To top it off, a busboy walked around all the night and just stared in our direction, visibly noticing our empty/dirty plates, and doing nothing about it. Another server inched behind my chair to pass and open the patio gate to let himself out to hang out with bouncer (why couldn't he use the front door?) and LEFT THE GATE open RIGHT NEXT TO MY CHAIR. Hello? The bouncer was also allowing people to smoke right behind our table near the front door. He then proceeded to do nothing about the following either: when a few of the smokers (guys who were clearly under the influence and possible underage) started whistling at us and saying 'come back to my crib for an after party' and I yelled back 'seriously???  seriously?? Fuck off' what's a bouncer for anyway. LOVELY dinner outing, let me tell you. Really, Top notch.

I initially thought this was a plus. I've never been to WW before, so I ordered a burger - something nobody could mess up, right? It costs extra for chili and cheese (a dollar each) and two dollars to substitute sweet potato fries for normal french fries. Granted, there were 12 of us, but the food came out very slowly, in drips and drabs, a few plates at a time, instead of all at once. That can be kind of shitty, as you're getting hungrier watching others eat. And come on, there was no one else there. How hard is it to make twelve meals, in a restaurant obviously designed to accommodate almost 10X that number of people? Sure, there was only one waitress on staff at the time, but come on. There was us and one other group of people. I found out why the place was empty when I got my burger. I asked for medium rare, and it was medium well, with barely a bit of pink in the center. The chili was flavorless and boring. The cheese was nice and gooey and the bun was good, but it didn't make up for how bland the whole thing was. The fries were also dry, and there were very, very few of them, especially given the fact that they cost $2 extra. I spent $13+tip all together for a dull, unsatisfying meal. I've had much better meals at half the cost at my company cafeteria. Between the bad service and the bland, forgettable food, I won't be back.

Sometimes they have live bands, other times they have bumpin DJs, but it is always a good time & gets pretty packed. There's always dancing, as well as, tables to rest your dancin' shoes (: They show UFC fights so if you're a fan this is a good place to watch and drink -- but you won't be able to hear the commentary. Huge TV screens tho!Now the food... amazing! I had the Salmon Sliders - unbelievable. I've never had them before and they were really tasty and the salmon wasn't too dry or wild. My friend had the Buffalo Bites - really good & come as cute little cubes which were great for sharing. OH and did I mention the appetizers are 1/2 off during happy hour? Done deal. Definitely will come back for food, not just the booze.PS. They have outdoor seating and you have an incredible view of Midtown.

The official opening is tomorrow. We sat next to the window and had a great view of the river and the city (through the trees). It's hard to beat that view. For the sportsman there were also numerous televisions to keep an eye on during gametime.On the service front our waitress Michelle was incredibly nice as well as attentive.As for cleanliness the place looked tip top and my girl said the women's bathroom was practically spotless. Being that it's a new bar/restaurant I'm not going to really rate the food or service because it's not going to be indicative of how it will hopefully be in the future. It's to be expected that there will be kinks they need to work out, and there were, such as which waiters/waitresses were covering which tables, what tables the busboys were bringing food to and inaccurate order taking/fulfillment (overcooked burger, cheese on a no-cheese burger). As the staff gets to know one another this should be refined.Overall, it seems like it's going to be a decent option for football games and office happy hours. Don't expect much more than standard bar grub for food though. Hopefully these guys know how to market themselves to draw crowds to this location that gets very little foot traffic.

It ended up being karaoke for a competition they had been running for a few weeks and we had to leave before karaoke for anyone else actually started. Additionally, wings were ordered and when I took a bite out of one, it looked like little hairs were all attached to the wing. This is when my friend informed me that these were feathers and the wings were probably not de-feathered properly.

One of my coworkers comes here quite frequently and often sees the Manzo boys (for you Real Housewives fans, apparently Thursday is your target night).However, we were quickly disappointed. For one, when we walked in, there was no one at the hostess stand. We took this as an invitation for self-seating, but were quickly corrected by a waitress. As she glanced over to see the hostess texting in a nearby booth, she agreed to clean a table and seat us. Good start (minus one).We got a table outside (plus one...we're even). However, we proceeded to sit. Then we sat a little longer. Then after several minutes, Mr. Dearth of Personality came to wait on us...let's just say it might have been one of the more painful social interactions I've had with a human (minus like 25 on the score card).To summarize in brief here, the service is atrocious. Our beers were cold, but took forever to come.

Instead there were tiny pieces of pears and apples. My friend's wild berry sangria was okay. She ordered the breakfast wrap and while it was filling the sausage tasted odd. It was nothing you can't make at home. My Benedict burger was really good expect that the waitress brought me the wrong food. She brought out a regular egg's Benedict instead of the burger. So while my best friend was eating I was just sipping my watery sangria and picking at her tater tots. In total our meal came out to $40 and we didn't feel that it was worth it.

But hopefully he's the only bad seed and the other servers are more attentive. I'm definitely planning to go back and try the wings.

It was a good time come; we got a table and ordered food before it got crazy packed. We ordered drinks, food and a beer tower. Our super sweet waitress left around 10:30 and told us we would have to order drinks at the bar after, which was fine.This is when the night went bad! This place is packed and we stood in line behind some rather drunk girls being served shot upon shot, even though they were falling all over the place. When we finally got the bartenders attention we ordered another bud light tower. He simply shakes his head no and turns away to help other people...ummmm what does that mean? No beer towers? No bud light? Seriously just tell us so we can order something else!! Jared was the bartender, we had to ask the girls at coat check. Hes horrible and ill never be back here because of him.

As for the service and the food & drink...mediocre would be an overstatement.  The soup arrived lukewarm and tasteless 45 minutes after it was ordered.  The buffalo chicken wrap had soggy chicken and dirty lettuce...as in there was dirt on the lettuce!  The prices were fine, but that didn't make up for the confluence of missteps.There's no chance that I would ever give my money to this place again.",Wicked Wolf Tavern,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

However the BIG problem with this location (hence the 2 stars) is the people who work here. I have never experience such terrible customer service then here. The bar is always understaffed so the wait for a drink is ridiculous. This wouldn't be such an issue if they were so rude. The hostess, bouncer, and management were just as rude. They were not accommodating and basically had a ""if you don't like it, go elsewhere"" attitude. While out for an birthday party on a Saturday night, 3 separate employees bumped into me while i was standing by the bar and spilled my drink. Not even an apology. I understand it is a bar and it does get crowded but this was completely unnecessary.Its a shame that this place has such terrible service as it is in a great location and could have the potential to stand out in Hoboken.

It tasted watered down and cheap for $8. My fourth time I went, I had won a happy hour contest for my friends and me on a Friday night. I had a terrible time getting there by train, so I arrived with about an hour left of the special. I get there and the bouncer is trying to get my boyfriend and I to wait outside (after I told him I'm a contest winner) but eventually told us to wait for the hostess at the front. We waited about 5 minutes for the hostess to get back. She put armbands on everybody to enjoy the special without any question of whether these people are actually friends of the winners. The place was packed and literally everybody had an arm band on. I got my drinks free, but still, didn't feel like I had really ""won"" anything.

Good beer, Ok food,  Gets really crowded on weekends, but great weekday bar and fun trivia nights.I wanted to give it 3.5 star from a mixed experience.  Overall most weekdays 4 stars. On weekends 3I have been here numerous times over the past year on weekdays and weekends and its really two separate worlds. During the week its a fantastic bar.The service is good , its not too crowded always a place to sit down. The booth TVs are great for mid week college football games and bowl games around this time of year as well. The food comes out quick you can always get a drink , over all a great experience. I have especially enjoyed grabbing some friends for trivia nights there to have fun get some free swag and enjoy the drink and tower special they have constantly changing through the night.  My only complaint there would be the rampant cheating with people on their smart phones in corners getting near perfect scores and winning trivia. If your in the middle of the bar its pretty obvious , but i see people sitting in the booths and the guy in the corner on their team trying to be all discrete about typing away on his smart phone for Wikipedia answers.  Wish they would crack down on that harder.Weekends are another thing especially Sundays.  The earliest  football games arent so bad when they start , get in early grab a seat and enjoy the games. But as the day goes on it gets really packed to the point you can barely see around or hear.Saturdays nights are like this too packed in shoulder to shoulder with a line outside , they area you can dance is get so crowded you can barely move around. There is  a  line out the door and forget about getting a drink , unless your the stereotypical jersey Guido waving a 50 at the bar tended and constantly hollaring at them or a girl with their top popping out be prepared to sit there with cash in hand waiting to get a drink for 15 min or longer.  My advice start going for your next drink when your about 50% through the one in hand lol.",Wicked Wolf Tavern,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

It was my first time at the place, so I didn't know what to expect -- just heard it was new...Overall, it's got a pretty decent feel. Nothing that'll make you jump up and shout, but the TV's are phenomenal for any sports fan. There's about 7, and they're all big-screen LCD's strategically placed throughout the bar, and hanging overhead at some tables. Service was pretty solid (we ordered beer towers -- check 'em out, worth the money).However, make sure you do NOT get stuck waiting to get in. I can't figure out the logistics of how they let people in. The ratio of people out to in was absurd, and many of my friends were waiting outside for 30 minutes EASY...so make sure you go on a warm night!DJ was pretty good, and the overall vibe of the place wasn't too shabby at all. 3/5",Wicked Wolf Tavern,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

One fateful evening we decided to meet up for dinner like normal folks do. Foolish, I know. Not knowing that the crepe spot on Sinatra Drive had closed, I told him to meet me there at 7pm. Almost 60 minutes pass by as I languish in the heat, watching parking spaces disappear, young urban professionals bike and jog by in the hopes of staving off Father Time and feel my blood pressure rise as I knew the night would start out this way. Eventually, he calls to say that he doesn't know where I am, but the GPS led him somewhere and he's already parked. Genius, I say, you're far. Perplexed, he gets back into his car before I finish talking and somehow he finds his way to me... about twenty minutes later. I was ready to go home five minutes ago. Patience is a virtue, Michelle, patience is a virtue. Disappointed in the closing of our intended location, we walk down the street and find ourselves at the Wicked Wolf.The hostess was extremely perky (no, I didn't see her nipples) and sprite. Lucky for us, the place wasn't too packed. The TVs were only showing two things: a hockey game and some sort of congressional hearing, I kid you not! We chose to sit at a booth showing the hockey game. God bless those people that got stuck at a table showing the hearing. Anyway, the menu is standard American fare. I wasn't expecting to be wowed. I knew walking in here the kind of food that I was going to be getting. It's 2011, who goes out to eat and doesn't check the menu of the restaurant before they get there? We ordered nachos, a burger (custom made) and a cheesesteak wrap. If memory serves me, we destroyed the nachos. He killed his burger and I put a light dent in my wrap. Everything was completely enjoyable, nothing to complain about, nothing to write home about either. I think I like saying Wicked Wolf the best.

So we took a lovely stroll over (the walk along the water is always nice), and upon approaching the place, I noticed A LOT of noise, and soon realized Tuesday's are Karaoke Nights! I'm not much of a fan, but we went inside anyway.We were seated away from the singing, but we were put in an extremely dim-lit area by the bar, and it was hard to read our menus. When my eyes finally adjusted, I decided on the Southwestern Burger for my entrée, and my boyfriend and I split their original nachos.The nachos were OK- it was difficult to get the topping on the chips and I felt like I was making a mess of myself as we worked through the plate. It was also obvious they microwave the cheese on because the chips were glued to the sides of the plate with burnt cheese crisps (as an avid home nacho and cheese obsessor, I can spot the signs), so that kinds messed up the texture of the chips. I really liked the chili on top though, and the jalapeños too.The burger was good, but there was A LOT of BBQ sauce all over it, and again I felt a bit messy, but it was still yummy so I won't be a hater. The fries were a little cold too, but it's whatevs, it's just a filler side anyway.For Hoboken, the prices are great for the food, but I think the next time I come here I'll come for the Happy Hour drink specials.",Wicked Wolf Tavern,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

Maybe the stars were all aligned that night, but from the moment we stepped in line(yes there was a line but not too long and probably due to opening weekend), we received great service. We were picked out of the line by one of the bouncer, mostly likely b/c we were 5 girls, and our cover was waived. It was crowded but not to the point that we couldn't move around. They have a great set up for the band and there was room to dance around and act a fool. We were comped on a bunch of drinks from the bartenders (again probably b/c of opening weekend) but to me, this shows that they know how to treat new customers and keep them coming back. The bathrooms were very clean, although a little cramped at times. Good mix of people too, although they leaned more towards the recent college grad age.  Their mascot the ""wolf"" comes out at one point during the night and mingles with the crowd which is a different and fun touch in comparison to other bars in Hoboken. They also take pictures of the night and post them to the website. If your picture is selected as the main picture, you receive a $25 gift card - and lo and behold our picture was selected! Again, great customer service.  So after all this raving, why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5?

341,2LMdpRnc2ShBRYUAHnYC6A,Anthony M.,4.0 star rating,"Came a couple times for sports events and I have to say I like this new addition. Great view on the river, plenty of room, and a very very long bar which is key. Their TV setup is perfect, basically 360 degree coverage. Even the booths have mini LCDs. I ordered some chicken sandwich which I found terrible but the bartender did recommend a burger and I didn't listen. Highly recommend for UFC and boxing.",Wicked Wolf Tavern,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

Perfect place to sneak out for a quick one and a bite with the cowos. Burgers (veg burger was edible), onion rings, fake Irish nachos (what? you can't do them on kettle chips!), and tator tots. Lots of tvs. At happy hour it looks way too crowded for me, but in the day I've seen everyone from suits to mommy lunch clubs.",Wicked Wolf Tavern,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

When it comes to food though this is one of the worst. Great Bar, fantastic patio with a great view of the water and city from across the bay. The rating is only a 2 because the food is that bad. So get a drink here before or after you go to dinner somewhere else. Oh and the music or tv sound is always way too loud!!!

346,UINyii-4Y_lbnUXBm1ITww,Chris K.,5.0 star rating,"Probably my favorite Hoboken bar to relax at with some friends on a weeknight.  Scratch that, it's definitely my favorite bar for a weeknight drink.The bartenders are awesome.  They're always friendly, and they know how to make a solid Ketel One and soda.  They'll even get up and sing with you on karaoke night if you ask nicely!  The happy hour specials are a great deal, and they've always got something going on (wings on Mondays, karaoke on Tuesdays, trivia on Wednesdays... you get the idea).  While the food isn't anything to brag about, it's not terrible either.  The buffalo bites are great, and I have yet to be let down by the burgers.As others have noted, the view of NYC is amazing.  The entire wall facing the Hudson is floor to ceiling windows.  There are plenty of TVs around, so it's a great place to catch a game.  On top of that, the bar is fairly large, and there's a lot of open space, so it can hold quite a few people before it starts getting crowded.All-in-all I think Wicked Wolf is a great mix of everything you want in a bar: the bartenders are the best, there are always a lot of people there (but it's not too crazy during the week), and the prices are very reasonable.",Wicked Wolf Tavern,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

348,eICo_sndfM0nM2Didm2ByA,Mona D.,4.0 star rating,"Great, clean sports bar with a killer view. WW is right on Sinatra Dr so the only thing between u and the Hudson River is the road and riverwalk. There is outdoor seating so this would be an amazing to-go spot to watch any game during the warmer months.  Last week the place was jam PACKED for the Giants game...but hey, it's Big Blue :) Last night I was there for MNF and there was a decent young professional crowd, but it wasn't crazy.  They have a great selection of the standard tap beers but also some interesting seasonal brews (raspberry wheat, pumpkin ale and apricot wheat).  Monday is 50-cent wing night so we loaded up for the guys. Favors are the usual mild/med/hot buffalo, BBQ and teriyaki...sorry, no waiver-required atomic levels.  The wings were actually some of the better ones I've had in town.  Usually a Black Bear wing patron, but these wings were larger, crispier and had better overall flavor.  My new usual :)",Wicked Wolf Tavern,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"

My only experience at Wicked Wolf wasn't great. I stood in line and watched several cougars(not hot) bypass the wait because they had an in with the doorman wearing a leather KISS jacket.

353,JyRrNbTnSn38ks22HiBeWA,David A.,3.0 star rating,"After four visits, it is time to share.  I wrestled with a 2 or 3 star review and decided on 3 because of location.  If this were anywhere else but sitting directly on the Hudson with the NYC skyline as a setting, 2 stars would have been the vote.  Except for the hot pretzels, which are amazing but overpriced, the food is at best mediocre.  Portions are adequate but no real wows on this menu.  Service rarely rises to mediocre with staff that knows neither the menu or the draft beer list without stepping away to check.  Food and beverage wait times are far too long without a crowd, I can only imagine when this place is busy.  Would i ever wait on line to enter? NO - there are too many places in Hoboken that serve better food and drink.  Given all this, I still enjoy myself each and every time because the setting and the crowd create an ambiance of enjoyment.  In short, go here expecting nothing exceptional but ready to have a good time.",Wicked Wolf Tavern,3.0 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, American, (Traditional)"
