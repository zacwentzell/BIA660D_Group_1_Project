Brunch is a favorite for me and the Mrs. The Corkscrew has a pretty nice sized menu with about nine to ten items for brunch.  It was hard to choose.  I finally decided on the brunch burger which had a Jersey sandwich staple, Taylor ham, egg and American cheese.  It is served on toasted bun and topped with a sriracha aioli and accompanied by sweet potato fries.  There is just something about a burger cooked on a grill that makes your mouth water.   This burger does that and more.  They are known for their burgers and I can see why, they are outstanding. The wife had the brunch Cubano, a traditional Cuban sandwich topped with a runny egg on an English muffin. It also comes with fried plantains. She really enjoyed it saying the egg with the salty pork and pickles were delicious. Believe it or not there was a three piece Jazz band that started playing shortly before we left. Which of course caused me to order a pint to prolong the stay. I had the Illusive Traveler Grapefruit Shandy. It was very refreshing with just a hint of the grapefruit.  I would definitely come back.

They've really rebranded themselves to into more then just a local watering hole and are quickly becoming a go-to spot in the JC Heights. There are three scenarios that I usually find myself in here:BRUNCH. The new spring '15 brunch food/drink menu is phenomenal. I came in last week and we all ordered the chicken and waffles **droool** - two fried chicken tenders atop a soft and pillowy belgian waffle drenched in powdered sugar and maple syrup. Need I say more? I'm not into bloodies but my friends agreed that these were some of the best. Din Din. This is a good place to come in and unwind after work, especially if you are into unwinding with a beer in one hand and a burger in the other. Depending on the night there are various drink specials and trivia. The BF and I are partial to the burger with a Three Philosophers demi glace. Not even Socrates, Plato and Aristotle could resist this. Add in some smoked Gouda and perfectly caramelized onions and we've got a real serious mouth party on our hands. Cooked to perfection, this left little to be desired except for more. The beer infused demi glace was the perfect accent. They change their dinner specials up pretty often. Late Night. My friends live up the street and we come in for a nightcap from time to time, every saturday, same difference. I never drunk eat ... but if I were going to then the classic bar menu choices like mozz sticks and chicken fingers would be my choice. If I were going to.

I was really hoping I would like this place - unfortunately, my very quick experience has put me off for good.I rarely go out in my own hood, but my friend was willing to travel and we chose the Corkscrew. it was very busy when I walked in, There happened to be two seats at the bar, so I asked the bartender if they were free and he said yes. Great. I studied the menu for a few minutes - it looked really interesting actually, and I was planning what I wanted, but realized I hadnt ordered a drink, so I looked up and tried to catch the bartenders eye.Well, I sat there 15 minutes being absolutely 100% ignored.He knew I was there totally because I spoke to him and he watched me sit down.As soon as my friend arrived we bolted. I was actually really pleased I got ignored, for we went over to the Fox and Crow and had a delicious, and very serene experience.FAR more civilized.Even if I hadnt have been ignored, we would have left after the first drink because the vibe in there was HORRIBLE.I cant for the life of me figure out what the Corkscrew is trying to be or who it wants to cater to.The menu sounded really good and a step up from standard bar fare, the decor is sports bar, the crowd was mixed the music was rap the vibe was club.It was A W F U L.Quite obviously if you are over 40, you are unwelcome.If you have any sense of sophistication, save your money and walk over to Fox and Crow to spend your money.",Corkscrew Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pubs,, American, (Traditional)"

The owner, taking a hint from the slow gentrification process in the Heights, gave this bar a beautiful facelift. This place is TOTALLY different than what my partner and I witnessed when we gave it a try about 2 years ago. Being slightly turned off by the ratchet-ish ambiance, I vowed not to return. BUT this place has totally changed since then and it certainly still has that neighborhood feel with a more refined ambiance, adorned with new wood floors and tables, and flat screen tvs, but most importantly: an actually appetizing menu. Yes, there's the classic bar food but they take it a step further serving bar food that's worth trying and isn't only fried crap. They even have a brunch menu! I truly enjoyed my calm, chill brunch experience recently on a Sunday. My beau and I, refusing to wait for brunch at a downtown JC spot, decided to try the chicken & waffle dish offered here. We were so surprised at how good the food was! The waffle was fluffy & soft, what you expect from a great waffle, and the chicken (boneless strips & I ordered a side of sweet & spicy chicken wings) were cooked/fried to a yummy crispness that satisfied our Sunday brunch cravings. Top that with a $5 mimosa and a $4 Yeungling and we were set. The Big Bang Theory on tv was also a plus!

I found out that it Saturdays are Ladies Nights so all martinis were $5. I asked the bartender to make me a sweet martini and he made me a white gummy bear martini which was pretty delicious. They also have a pretty decent beer selection. The kitchen is behind the bar area in the back corner. They have a pretty simple food menu considering they don't have a real kitchen. I was pretty amazed by what they can make. We had 2 drinks and left. The place was pretty crowded by the time we were leaving. All the seats at the bar were taken.

My friend suggested his new favorite place, the remodeled Corkscrew, advice which I'm glad I took. The remodeled interior was very welcoming, with dark wood and a semi-rustic feel. The large windows made for great lighting and people watching as we enjoyed our food and drinks. The music was perfect, the playlist was on point for the 25-35 year old crowd. There wasn't a bad song played, all familiar favorites. I do love me some 90's R&B.The tap list, while not overly extensive, was very impressive. Its a rotating selection with excellent offerings from Ommegang, Brooklyn, Dogfish Head, and other reputable craft breweries. As a beer drinker, I was very excited by the offerings and sad I could not try everything as I had to drive into NYC directly after the meal. I was able to try a tasty saison, and I will definitely be back to try more. There was also a nice selection of specialty mixed drinks and daily cocktail specials. This is the kind of place where drinkers of all varieties will find something to satisfy their palate. The food selection is limited because there really isn't a full kitchen space. All the food looks to be prepared in a small griddle area behind the bar. Given these limitations, the menu is still impressive. I got the Screw Burger, while my friends had eggs benedict and the chicken and waffles. The burger and eggs benedict were good, but not great, pretty standard fare. I liked the thin cut fries that accompanied the burger, crispy and fresh. The real standout was the chicken and waffles. The tenderloins that topped the fresh, fluffy Belgian waffle were so moist and well seasoned, they easily make my top 5 list of chicken and waffles I've ever had. However they're preparing those chicken tenders, I'm convinced there some wizardry happening. The dinner specials looked really good, but sadly were not available during lunch. This is a true neighborhood bar, one that makes you feel at home the moment you walk through the door. The friendly, attentive staff, chill music and ambience, and delicious food make me wish they'd open up shop next to me in Morristown.

Some further thoughts-The good:-the kitchen is open until 2 hours before the bar closes everyday... so on weekends, it is open until 1 am which is way later than most other bars in JC-really friendly service and bartenders who make sure to learn your name-interesting specials (when I was there, they had a quinoa salad, fish tacos, and other stuff)-16 beers on tap plus many bottles in addition to a fairly wide wine selection and a full bar including a few specialty cocktailsCould be better:-I ordered one thing from the menu, the barbecue chicken tenders. They weren't bad by any means but I thought they could have used more flavor and/or more sauce. The sample size is super small though and I look forward to trying more of the menu-I asked what beers they had on tap and was told they have 16 and then asked what I like. While I appreciate the bartender trying to find me something I would like, I would have liked to see a list of their selection. Not sure if they have one (it wasn't part of their drink menu) but with that many beers on tap, they should-The menu isn't small but it also isn't the most interesting- you have pretty much standard finger/bar food like chicken wings, burgers, fries, etc. Their specials and brunch menu show more imagination so it would be nice to see this included in a few of their regular food items as well. Not a huge issue but just a thought-I was told martinis would be $5 because Saturday was ""ladies night"" but was charged $7 on my bill. I didn't bother to get it corrected because that is still a pretty good price and I wasn't going to complain about $2 but I guess just having consistent pricing would be good.Overall, I enjoyed my time here and although there are a ton of options in Jersey City, I could definitely see myself coming back.",Corkscrew Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pubs,, American, (Traditional)"

For prime brunch time on a Sunday, it wasn't too packed and was a nice and cool place to hang out before going over to the farmers market. Brunch menu was fairly limited. They had two specials - an eggs Benedict florentine with salmon and a chicken fried steak dish. Feeling underwhelmed by the rest of the fairly small brunch menu, I ordered the chicken fried steak. I almost immediately regretted this after seeing the chicken and waffles come out.Everything looks like it's homemade despite their tiny kitchen - I watched the food being made and nothing came from a freezer bag. Pretty impressive. The chicken fried steak itself was pretty good, but the gravy didn't really taste like much and the accompanying biscuit was a little too heavy. My two brunch companions had cocktails which were quite large and inexpensive. One reported that the eggs Benedict was ""standard"" and the other said that the salad he had was good, but could have used more quinoa. Note that there are very limited vegetarian options. Also, they didn't offer the yelp check in deal, so keep that in mind if you think you'll get 25% off.

98,_LOBJNWCoDqVYUMr6QvrRA,Sam B.,1.0 star rating,Obviously most of the reviews must be made by staff or friends of staff because they are completely wrong. -first off as soon as we entered there was some loud ass girl talking so damn loud to another person across the room about depressing and personal issues. The staff allowed it of course despite how annoying it was while keeping the music extremely low allowing the entire bar to hear her. -the bartender was very friendly but service was backwards because we sat at a table and had to constantly go over to the bar to order our drinks and food.-lastly the food was not cooked medium like asked and got the wrong cheese on the sandwich. It was mediocre at best so overall it was a very disappointing first time experience. WILL NOT BE RETURNING.,Corkscrew Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pubs,, American, (Traditional)"

I visited the Bar/Grill with a friend who frequent the place. The bar manager (cute) staff( day and evening) where beyond the epitome of friendly and service . The atmosphere is warm, inviting and place bigger than I thought from the outside view. I can speak on both the morning staff/food and the evening staff/food. The woman ROCK even my waitress, cook and bartenders. I got a chance meet the handsome guy who put the menu together and I say damn good menu: Keep up the good work.

104,EnyKabVppxepXHQn7dEQog,Mark R.,5.0 star rating,"I'm giving the Cork 5 Stars because it is a 5 Star Neighborhood Bar.  I'm the weird mix between a local and a hipster.  I have been to dozens of JC local bars over the years, and I have found the best one: Corkscrew.The atmosphere is well lit and clean; something not found in many local bars.  The regular patrons range from the local flavor, workers, suits, mod punk, and teachers.  Euceph, the manager, is very friendly and seems to welcome every single person that walks through the door.  The drinks are reasonably priced as any bar in JC can be.  Great Happy Hour.  The food is the real treasure.  The signs say the best hamburgers and wings in the area.  The hamburgers are really really good and they have some specialty toppings.  The wings are hands down the best in NJ, NY and PA; I have lived in all 3 states and have searched for good wings.  Harder than you think.  The rest of the menu is excellent with the standard tavern fare with some added flare.   Overall- if you're looking for a place to stop by and get a drink and/or bite, then Corkscrew is for you.  If you're looking for your regular bar that when you walk in your beer is waiting for, then the Corkscrew is for you.  UPDATE!!!Cork has revamped itself!!  You wouldn't recognize it. Beautiful woodwork, granite bar, and fresh decor. The Jewel of JC Heights bar scene!  Prices still the same and the atmosphere is great. The new windows really change the place.  They expanded the menu with some specialty items such as Fish Tacos and Quinoa Salads, and they have started a brunch menu on Saturday and Sunday from 11-2. Eggs Benedict, $9, was amazing. My wife thinks it's the best in the area. The Chicken and Waffles, $10, are amazing. Take a look. Its worth a revisit; you won't be disappointed.Have Fun",Corkscrew Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pubs,, American, (Traditional)"

Tara, the bartender, was friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu and all of the beers on tap.My boyfriend and I both ordered burgers off of their small but interesting menu. Burgers were juicy with a great char, a bit under-seasoned though. The waffle fries are AWESOME. Prices are great! Our entire meal with drinks was about $30. The music was on point switching seamlessly from dance music to old school hip hop, however sitting at a table by the speakers my boyfriend and I found ourselves practically yelling at each other to be able to have a conversation.

110,5PUmt_aLLIHpaugzvmLLeg,Bianca T.,4.0 star rating,"For years I've passed right by this place on the walk home from the lightrail. Being a Corkscrew regular for over three years now, don't sleep on this neighborhood bar! This spot has one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had (friends from Queens and South Jersey always make an attempt to have one every time they are around the area)! Not a burger fan? Try their wings (buffalo and cajun dry rub) and buffalo cheese fries w/ ranch dressing.Their drink specials are reasonably priced ($2-3 shots)- try the Blood Orange vodka, it's sweet, smooth, and yummy-- totally appropriate for NYK wins (shameless plug for my die-hard Knicks fan-friends). For $5 you can treat yourself to the Campfire shot (it has cinnamon & fire, and it's just as amazing as it sounds)! Friends are a huge fan of their Screw Sweet Tea and Screw Rootie Tootie (be careful with these- dangerously sweet but guises the taste of alcohol). You'll be impressed with their selection of craft beers as well.The people who occupy this bar varies from night-to-night. For instance the Thursday rock lovin' Trivia Night crowd differs from the Saturday new hiphop/rap ""let's party"" crowd (bouncer included). Regardless of what day or time it is you will always find a couple of regulars, locals, and regular locals.The owner and bartenders are super friendly and personable. The owner, Youssef, will check in and say hello to you as well.The kitchen closes at midnight, perfect for your late-night appetite. So forget the diet for a night and come in with an appetite.

I came back a few weeks later and felt very welcomed by the owner and he even remembered me by name which was very nice.I was coming in for only a drink or two but with the awesome service I decided to stay and try some food instead of going to hoboken. I'm glad I did. The Lucy burger sounded weird but with bacon, peanut butter with a hamburger cooked perfectly, it was very good.

114,3ldzNygQ0x5FTyknvpDnJQ,Christina F.,4.0 star rating,"Corkscrew is a great neighborhood bar.  Being born and raised in the area it is nice to find a bar that has a nice balance of locals and out of towners.  Sure, this bar definitely has the standard (JC) regulars, but that always makes for a great time.  Most people are friendly ( if they are not staring you down like a piece of meat) and the range of age and diversity proves they are a real neighborhood pub, not just your pop-up, artsy, overcompensating hipster bar.  Though some nights (thursdays, ladies nights 1/2 price drinks) are cray cray and so I can't say the crowd is peachy every day of the week.  Bartenders are all friendly and highly attentive.  Drinks are always on point and they have specials on the board every day.  Food is greasy and delicious but really, who doesn't love that?   What i mean is, if you are looking for a chill atmosphere, extremely tasty burgers ( cooked to  perfection by the bartender) and some slammin sweet potato fries( i like to dip mine in bleu cheese) then you have found the right place.  Try the screw tea - super sweetcakes.  Cheers",Corkscrew Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Pubs,, American, (Traditional)"
