The appetizer was soooo good, i rarely eat red meat these days but for some reason the spicy steak stood out to me. Dont be afraid to dip your bread in the sauce, it brings out the flavor in the bread! We shared the appetizers.  I saw alot fo buffalo wings being ordered, so Ill probably try them next time.We came a little early because after a certain time the restaurants and bars in Hoboken  get packed and I didn't want to deal with that.  We walked in and was seated right away. They had a nice fireplace in the dining room, added to the ambience. The wait staff was on point, she refilled my water, without asking. She brought anything i needed quickly!

1,5aZX8bTiD0k9vR60SG588Q,Alison C.,4.0 star rating,"My friend and I had finished watching a movie at the theater catty-corner from the Hoboken classic, Carpe Diem Pub & Restaurant, and she suggested that we head there for a drink.  I told her that I had actually not eaten dinner, so I was much more in need of some food.  She then mentioned that she had eaten at Carpe Diem in the past and that it was pretty decent.  The place had been there for years, but I had only once briefly stepped inside, found a non-descript pub, and walked out.  I had made a mistake, judging the book by its cover, because when she took me in there, I was introduced to their adorable dining room that laid just beyond the standard bar.  There was a burning fireplace in the corner; and red velvet curtains enhanced the romantic feel in this room of simple wooden tables.  Despite my hunger, I ordered a drink before I made my food selection.  The Apple Cider Negroni sure was seasonal, but it had such a sweet and artificial fruit flavor that I could not drink it.  I was finally able to flag down our server and replace the offensive cocktail with a lively glass of Monforte Prosecco from Veneto, Italy.  The sparkling wine was not too dry nor too sweet and had an essence of ripe pear flavor.  My friend ordered a Boozy Hot Chocolate, which was covered in mini marshmallows and looked like a great treat, but was over-priced at $13 for a meager mug.  The dinner menu at this ""Irish"" pub actually offered a cross-continental sampling, with everything from a predictable shepherd's pie to hefty hamburgers to even chicken stir-fry and penne alla vodka!  It was already later in the evening, so I wanted something light and opted for a large bowl of their Homemade Chicken Soup.  The broth had the ideal amount of salt and onion flavor, as well as a massive helping of white meat chicken chunks, carrots, and celery.  Though I had the option to incorporate rice into the dish, I kept it carb- and gluten-free, saving room in my belly for the high-quality poultry instead.  This hearty soup was perfect for the cold evening and something for which I would exclusively venture to the restaurant, helping me upgrade my rating from 3.5 to 4 stars.Don't let Carpe Diem's uninspiring facade fool you, this pub has been continually successful because of their terrific food and neighborhood feel.  It also acts as a jovial place to catch up with a companion after a few hours of sitting in silence at the movies!",Carpe Diem Pub & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Irish,, Pubs,, American, (New)"

Believe it or not, their pasta dishes are great.  Their rigatoni alla vodka is SO good - way better than some of the Italian restaurants in town I've ordered take-out from and cheaper for a healthy portion!  I recommend it with chicken added.  I've also ordered a bolognese pasta that was on their specials menu one night and that was equally good.  It's a good local gem to just grab a few drinks at the bar too.",Carpe Diem Pub & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Irish,, Pubs,, American, (New)"

Even the veggies that the wings come with very very crisp and fresh. Sometimes you get those garbage veggies that have been cut for days and you aren't sure how it's all going to end up. Blue cheese dressing also seemed to be homemade. That was a plus.

This dish is cubes of steak in this awesome sweet soy sauce with jalepenos for the kick. I'll definitely order this again and again.Chicken Fingers - Very tenderized (thin) pieces of chicken and very crunchy! They came with a honey mustard dipping sauce.Coconut Shrimp - Pretty typical as you would get anywhere else. The shrimp were somewhat small and came with a sweet dipping sauce.Wings - typical hot wings you can order with buffalo sauce, bbq, sweet chili or honeyThis place really surpassed my expectations.

No peas either, which would've been good!Not sure if there's a kids menu as we weren't offered one, which is fine, but then staples like fish & chips should be a good standard and plain for giving to kids. The chicken soup was a hit with my son and I had a basic Caesar salad, which was fine. It was also chilly in there, which was disappointing on a rainy day.

18,NWLqOKl0Vxi7qK-6EoBLbg,Brandon E.,5.0 star rating,"This is by far my favorite bar in Hoboken. Why you ask? Because it's just a bar, being a bar with great bartenders, good food and an actual pub like atmosphere. To be honest, this is where grown ups go to have fun.Sure, there is always a time for the 3 different Black Bears downtown but that time has past for me. And Carpe delivers a good time without the Ho-bro-ken scene. Every time I come here I always say ""I don't come here enough"". This is a great place to sit down, have a drink with friends or strangers, you'll always wind up striking up a conversation with someone, whether you know them or not, and that is why it gets my vote for the best bar in Hoboken. I have to give a shout out to Nick behind the bar, he is also probably the best bartender in town. He remembers you, talks to you and makes you feel at home, whether it's your first or 100th time in. The food is also pretty damn good, I've had burgers, wings, chicken sandwich and a bunch of the happy hour apps. I haven't had anything bad. I love their wing sauce, but prefer it on the buffalo sandwich over the wings. I like carbs, don't judge. The happy hour is also great because it goes til 8pm Monday-Friday. If I had to pick I'd say the popcorn chicken and spicy egg rolls are my favorite happy hour apps. They have a pretty good beer selection, but I do miss Yards on tap.This is a simple but great neighborhood bar that is always worth a visit.",Carpe Diem Pub & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Irish,, Pubs,, American, (New)"

The batter was not light and crispy, instead was dark and heavy, even slightly spicy, Not nice at all. Also expected fries, as I hadn't read the description. No peas either, which would've been good!Not sure if there's a kids menu as we weren't offered one, which is fine, but then staples like fish & chips should be a good standard and plain for giving to kids. The chicken soup was a hit with my son and I had a basic Caesar salad, which was fine. It was also chilly in there, which was disappointing on a rainy day.

38,NWLqOKl0Vxi7qK-6EoBLbg,Brandon E.,5.0 star rating,"This is by far my favorite bar in Hoboken. Why you ask? Because it's just a bar, being a bar with great bartenders, good food and an actual pub like atmosphere. To be honest, this is where grown ups go to have fun.Sure, there is always a time for the 3 different Black Bears downtown but that time has past for me. And Carpe delivers a good time without the Ho-bro-ken scene. Every time I come here I always say ""I don't come here enough"". This is a great place to sit down, have a drink with friends or strangers, you'll always wind up striking up a conversation with someone, whether you know them or not, and that is why it gets my vote for the best bar in Hoboken. I have to give a shout out to Nick behind the bar, he is also probably the best bartender in town. He remembers you, talks to you and makes you feel at home, whether it's your first or 100th time in. The food is also pretty damn good, I've had burgers, wings, chicken sandwich and a bunch of the happy hour apps. I haven't had anything bad. I love their wing sauce, but prefer it on the buffalo sandwich over the wings. I like carbs, don't judge. The happy hour is also great because it goes til 8pm Monday-Friday. If I had to pick I'd say the popcorn chicken and spicy egg rolls are my favorite happy hour apps. They have a pretty good beer selection, but I do miss Yards on tap.This is a simple but great neighborhood bar that is always worth a visit.",Carpe Diem Pub & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Irish,, Pubs,, American, (New)"

After 50 minutes of waiting, our food arrives where she brought the 2 apps out with our entrees. Then as we proceeded to try to tuna tartare with the cheesy bread, the bread was basically a frozen.

For our entrees we went Classic Irish comfort food.  Shepherds Pie and the Irish Breakfast.  The portions are large.  The one thing that threw me with the shepherds pie was they may have used something tangy in the meat. Maybe sour cream?  It was just something I am not used to in Shepards Pie.  It didn't stop me from finishing it and then having some of the wife's Irish Breakfast.  We washed it all down with their Bloody Mary which was ok.

This is clearly a neighborhood bar and the locals (which ranged from residents to construction workers) were graciously welcomed with their regular drink. My gin and tonic didn't seem right, not sure why, but was assured it was my regular gin. Who knows... anyway The curiosity to me however was the wings. There was a trophy as apparently these were best wings in. Hoboken. Who doesn't want to try the best!?!?!  They were good indeed, but the best? I'm not sure how they are judged but my guess is they won for being simple. The wings were average in size, but cooked perfectly. The meat easily pulled from the bone and they had the right amount of crisp. The sauce was more or less traditional, maybe medium. There was a touch of sweetness to the sauce which might be the only innovative thing about them. Not too messy. Trophy? These are just typical wings done well. I'm guessing hoboken is esteemed for other things besides wings so the competition may not have been too fierce.

Walking in for the first time, we were greeted nicely by the bartender and the hostess. The dining room in the back is nice, quaint, but since an upstairs party was spilling over into the dining room we felt the bar tables were a better bet tonight.  The high top seats/tables at the bar are reasonably comfortable. Table service in the bar area was friendly and efficient.  Chicken fingers for an appetizer were on the crunchy side but no complaints. My friend ordered shepherd's pie and enjoyed it. I went for the broiled tilapia over spinach and thought it was very good.  Two entrees, one appetizer, and two drinks about $55 total, not bad at all.The modest-sized bar has a comfortable pub feel; the walls are loaded with vintage photos and the Van Morrison music enhanced the overall vibe. The bar was busy early so I'm thinking they have a decent happy hour special.  It's across the street from Bow Tie Cinema so you can certainly work Carpe Diem into a 'dinner and a movie' or 'movie and a drink' night.  I really enjoyed visiting and I look forward to going again.",Carpe Diem Pub & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Irish,, Pubs,, American, (New)"

I've been looking for somewhere to go in Hoboken that isn't a total bro-fest, and this place is it. I came here on a football Sunday to catch the 4 o'clock games and it did not disappoint. For starters, the atmosphere is very warm and cozy. You feel right at home, next to the small yet intimate bar area. There's plenty of TVs to catch any game you're looking for and the people there get into the spirit of things and it encourages you to get into it too. Secondly, they have a great variety of beers to choose from. They even have little notes on each beer to give you an idea of its flavor profile. Huge plus for me, since I really only like a few types of beers. Thirdly, and certainly not the least important, the food was amazing. This is the farthest from your average bar food. I ordered the California burger expecting your average, run-of-the-mill chuck but it had a ton of flavor and was perfectly cooked. If you're going to stop by for a game, come hungry!Overall, if you're tired of the average bar scene and are looking for a place to have fun with a good crowd, this place seems to be it.I still have yet to come here on a Friday/Saturday night, but if it's anything like it is during the day, I'm sure it's a great time.P.S. - Danielle is an awesome server and made the experience that much more enjoyable!",Carpe Diem Pub & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Irish,, Pubs,, American, (New)"

Carpe Diem was DEFINITELY the best choice out of all of them. They have an upstairs section that you can book for a private party as long as you have at least 30 people participating. We opted for an open bar, which was a per person cost ($30) for anything that's not top shelf. You pay at the bar for a wristband from the bartender. Also, we get the bartender all to ourselves as it's a private bar for the upstairs room - no having to wait for drinks! :) The bartender was super attentive and also very helpful when it came to taking out and preparing the cake, hooking up our music (you can bring an ipod or phone to hook up with their aux cable and play your own music on the speakers in the room?), etc. Those who didn't want to do open bar could still pay for individual drinks (no wristband) and be at the party (but you need 30 people participating in open bar to book the room at all). You could also opt in for a food package for the party, but we chose to just order our own food individually if anyone wanted to.When speaking to the management on the phone, they were super thorough and helpful when it came to how to set up the party, since it was a surprise. You can tell them how you're planning on doing the surprise, and they'll follow along the plan so it all seems natural. It was all executed perfectly.I've also been here just to grab a couple drinks before at the downstairs bar. It doesn't seem to get too crowded. It's a small-ish place in uptown Hoboken and most bars/people are downtown, so it's not the location easiest to get to if you don't live uptown, but when you're there, very easy to get drinks at the bar and you'll enjoy a chill vibe here.

I would rate this restaurant a zero if I could because that would describe the personalities of the waitstaff here. The service is terrible, the waitstaff is miserable, and the food is not even that great. Today for lunch, we placed an order of wings, a salad, and a chicken sandwich. The wings took about 30 minutes to come out and then we proceeded to wait another 30 minutes before asking on the food status and were told it will take, ""a few more minutes.""  Meanwhile, a family of 6 came in and were already served their food while we continued to wait. No explanation was given, no apologies, nothing. 15 more minutes passed and we finally just got up, found the waitress, and asked for the check because we were leaving. The waitress then brought the check over without saying one word and then disappeared into the kitchen.  No words were even spoken, not even a simple, ""i'm sorry about that.""

From the burgers, to the apps, the happy hour menu is fabulous.

That didn't stop us, we took a corner table by ourselves & settled in for a romantic end to our evening. The drinks & food were good (wings, burger, brucheta, coconut shrimp), but the highlight was our waitress DANIELLE. She was the most pleasant, friendly, upbeat server I have had the pleasure of experiencing for a long time.

The bread from the Bruschette was toasted perfect, and the amount of ""filling/ topping"" was actually a larger portion than I expected. We were eating what was left and wouldn't fit on the bread with our forks. Then came the main event, the burgers.

We were able to snag outside seating right away. Our waitress was really sweet, Prompt, and didn't rush Us. My roomie got the special burger, Clare's way or something like that. She said that it was really good and had way too much Gorgonzola cheese, I saw that it also had a lot of onions...it  was a pretty big burger. As it was said, she ordered a  side of sweet potato fries. They were actually pretty chunky and not to fried so not too greasy. The meal was $14.I was way too full from lunch, so I had was the wins apps. For nine dollars the wings were definitely plentiful I think there were at least 10. They had a bunch of different flavors like barbecue, Buffalo, sweet chili, honey mustard. I ended up getting sweet chili and it was just right for me because it was not too saucy. I still felt that the wings were really crispy.We both had a glass of wine. I had the malbec which is actually not too dry and rather  fruity  and my roomie had the Pinot Grigio which I don't really care for too much but she seemed to enjoy it as she got a second-glass. 8-9 dollarGood decent bar pub food without the obnoxiousness  of many other Hoboken places, I would definitely come back.",Carpe Diem Pub & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Irish,, Pubs,, American, (New)"

The bartender shook his head and told us not to risk it. However, the waitress (I feel awful but I never grabbed her name) heard us asking and confidently said she'd take care of us. The waitress narrowed down our options to about half a dozen items they could whip of quickly. She also pointed us to the happy hour specials that were happening which were great. We settled on the spicy chicken wrap, popcorn chicken, & mozzarella balls and then a round of drinks (good selection). Our waitress was absolutely fantastic: got us our drinks quickly, our food came shortly after, and she let us settle the bill before we ate so we could get going as soon as we were done.

When the weather is nice, there is a decent sized patio to eat outside.  This place makes the best non-buffalo sauced wing in Hoboken.  The bartenders and staff are all friendly and engaging.   Overall a good place to go if you are looking for a calmer setting than most bars on Washington Street.",Carpe Diem Pub & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Irish,, Pubs,, American, (New)"

I went with the Tilapia on bed of spinach with dried fruit (wow!) and white wine sauce.   It was amazing. My date had the pulled pork sandwich, also very very good. I'd also recommend the Southwest-rolls appetizer.    Service was excellent.  I like the fireplace they had going in the back.   Very cozy & casual atmosphere.  I will be back to try more things on that menu,  I have my eye on the Gruyere burger.

The food came out and it was OK, nothing to write home about. I got the burger and it was a typical greasified goodness of a burger in a pub. Drinks were OK, nice selection of beers. This place is just so chill, not somewhere you want to go when you are looking to have fun and get CRUNK. So this did not satisfy my desires that evening. The best part of the night was when we got the check and it wasn't too shabby! The place was not bad, but not memorable.

Each time was a great experience.  The bartenders/servers/other patrons are super nice.On my boyfriend's birthday we decided to go out for some beers and appetizers, his favorite kind of meal. It was early-ish on a Thursday night and we sat at the bar.  The bartender was very attentive and the food was great. We could tell we were amongst regulars but everyone was very welcoming.  My boyfriend mentioned that he had called and they told him there was a dartboard but he didn't see one.  The bartender let us know that it was in the party room upstairs but that we could go up if we wanted - which was awesome to have the place to ourselves.We just went back recently for lunch with a friend and all three meals were delicious.  Definitely plan to be back for both the food and atmosphere.It is however located pretty much below an overpass which is a little creepy to walk to at night.",Carpe Diem Pub & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Irish,, Pubs,, American, (New)"
171,NnAgG9TTK_VGu-i0OaCFXA,Rick L.,5.0 star rating,"There wasn't a single thing wrong with our meal, the atmosphere, or service. The prices were more than fair for the quality of the food and the menu is surprisingly diverse, even for a one page rundown. My boyfriend and I had our anniversary dinner here before taking in a movie across the street (under the bridge, bow-tie cinemas) and he ordered the Penne with Alfredo and Bacon/Basil in the sauce, completely delicious and filling, as well as fair priced. I had the Fish N' Chips, which was battered in Blue Moon batter, a soft batter with a lemony aftertaste, really delicious and different from typical fish n' chips I've had in the past (in a good way!). We were lucky to hop in during happy hour so we could get 5$ appetizers, I suggest the mushroom von (a puff pastry with bacon, mushrooms, and whiskey sauce) while my man ordered the mini shepard's pies (a small set of four, reminded me of mini cupcakes, but quite delicious and the gravy that came with them with fucking divine.) We'll definitely come back sometime soon! I'm not easily impressed by the cozy interior, the warm service, and the well priced and delicious menu made me a devotee.",Carpe Diem Pub & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Irish,, Pubs,, American, (New)"
172,CnKmrzEUHwgMyKDKDhc6uA,Bob Z.,5.0 star rating,"A bit hard to find but worth the search. Very comfortable, cozy Irish pub. My wife had the ""Katie's Way"", which consisted of fresh turkey, bacon, gruyere cheese and gravy over bread. Very hearty and a huge portion which could have fed two people. My son had the Barbecue Bacon Cheddar burger and it was excellent. I had the Fish and Chips which was made from tilapia and was very moist and tender. Next time though, I would substitute the chips (which were ok) for the sweet potato fries. The only downside was that a party of twenty people came in right before us. We waited over an hour for our food. We weren't in any rush (and had a few Sam Adam's Cold Snaps in the process.) Our server was very apologetic and the manager took all of our beers off the check. Very classy move. We will definitely be back.",Carpe Diem Pub & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"Irish,, Pubs,, American, (New)"
173,WDUSwkgTHRmuT3BXPiHYqA,Barb B.,4.0 star rating,"Carpe Diem is a really cool little joint that I never would have found if it wasn't for yelp. And this is why I shall yelp until my dying days, because it is so great to find fun little out of the way spots! Clearly I am not the only one either, when I headed there for dinner a few weeks ago it was packed, especially in the bar, on a particularly chilly Hoboken evening. It was extremely cozy inside especially by the fire. The waitress was very friendly and efficient. And the harvest salad I had there was light yet delicious and just enough food for me. I love when pubs have good salads, I feel like I can go to a fun place without leaving feeling like I ate 1500 calories and need to be rolled out in a deep-fried haze. Good times!

This is more of a four stars for the time I had than the place itself. Although I gotta say had the fried cheese app. and it was killer.

The pear salad was also a winner. I had a burger for my dinner, definitely one of the BEST burgers in Hoboken! Cooked just right, with hot perfectly cooked fries.
