Usuallly getting grimaldis includes an unreasonable wait time for delicious food. The Hoboken location offers that same deliciousness without that pesky wait. Came here on a Sunday night around 6pm and was seated immediately. I had a pretty big brunch so I wasn't too hungry. My friend and I ordered a personal size of the grimaldis favorite pizza (I apologize I don't remember if that's the actual name of the pizza) it came with pepperoni, eggplant, ricotta cheese and fresh mozzarella. The pizza came with 4, perfectly sized slices. The eggplant was perfectly breaded and crispy, when added along with the other toppings created a combination of my 2 favorite foods- pizza and eggplant parm. It was such a delicious pizza I wish I could eat it all the time. My experience here was fantastic!

We decided to go with some wine to start of the night.   Now we get to the food we decided to try the garlic bread with Grimaldi sauce and the caesar salad for starters with Italian dressing.  The garlic bread was pretty good and so was the salad I did enjoy both.   The garlic bread with Grimaldi sauce as a dip was what made it without the sauce I don't know how much I would have liked it other wise.  One thing that didn't disappoint was the portion size the garlic bread was pretty big and filling.  Once we got done with the apps we decided to order a personal pie with jalapenos, onions, olives, and green peppers.  Now the pizzas hype wasn't all there but I still enjoyed the pie.  For dessert we went with the Tartufo but this one missed the mark a little bit.  Although it wasn't the greatest experience (maybe I was influenced by the hype) the food was good and the ambience was nice.  Still made for a cute date night!  I would say if you're in the area who knows maybe this style of pizza might be your thing.   But be warey don't make the mistake of expecting too much and give it an honest try and see for yourself.",Grimaldi’s,4.0 star rating,$$,Pizza

My boyfriend and I came here because I wanted to go to sit-in pizza restaurant. We saw this place on Yelp and decided to try it. When we came, there was a family of 6 before us who seemed to have been waiting for a while. It took about 10 minutes for us to get seated. The manager/owner asked where we would like to sit, but we didn't mind since I felt bad that it was busy. She brought us upstairs and boy, was that a mistake. The upstairs is mostly for bigger amounts of guests while the middle seating had tables for 2-4 people. It was extremely loud. This wasn't even the bad part though.It took about 30 minutes just for someone to get our order. I am not even exaggerating. There seemed to be only one waiter for all the tables and she was having a hard time. I felt extremely bad for the waitress, but she seemed to not know how to manage her time or organize herself. What made the experience worse though was that the table to our left came 10-15 minutes after us and got their order even before us. They also got their food before us and the family of 6 who were in line before my boyfriend and I. The family before us complained to the owner who apologized, yet said that they were short staff. From what I've learned, the owner should never make an excuse, especially saying their short staffed.Finally after an hour of being there, we got our food. We ordered a pizza with one half with bacon and the other with mushroom. We ordered a large with the two separate toppings that came out to $28. It's moderately priced, but a little more expensive than the usual. The pizza was not too bad. I was satisfied with it. The cheese they use is amazing. The cheese has such great flavor. The sauce, however, was not to our liking. It was opposite of the cheese where it didn't have enough flavor for me. Other than that, the pizza was good.

Hoboken certainly has more than enough pizzarias, and many of them are fantastic, but only one can be the best!Specifically, the crust on their pizza was not overcooked, the pie wasn't too greasy, and the cheese wasn't overwhelming to the point that it wasn't a challenge to pick up the slice.The atmosphere here is a little more upscale than your average pizzaria. I was there one time on a Saturday night with live music (solo guitar playing John Mayer covers).

The vegetables were all very fresh and the dressing with just right.Now on to the pizza... we got The Don as well as a white pizza with mushrooms and broccoli. I've been to the Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, and there are many similarities. The cheesy consistency of the fresh mozzarella, heartiness of the tomato sauce, fragrance and resilience of the dough are common to both places. However, they do have distinct characteristics. For example, the pizza is a bit drier at the Hoboken location, which makes it easier to pick up (the Brooklyn Grimaldi's center was a little bit soggy), but this means the crust is not quite as tasty (but still more edible than most places due to the high quality of the dough).",Grimaldi’s,4.0 star rating,$$,Pizza

The sauce wasn't bad - tasted like real Italian tomatoes - but the praise ends there.  The cheese was minimal and burnt, which I can forgive; the crust however was pretty bad. It was gooey chewy and had no crisp, at all. I don't know if it is the dough formulation and/or the yeast they use - but seriously the pie crust was terrible. It made what looked like a really good pizza a really bad pizza. I think the only reason the place does so well is because it does a great job of creating the appearance of a real Brooklyn pizza place, they have no competition, and the locals don't know any better.

We had a particular bad experience so I'm not sure it speaks to everyone's experience and the staff was also a server short that day. We made a reservation by phone in the morning and arrived 15 minutes ahead of time. When we arrived, no one was there to greet us. We waited 10 minutes before someone came to the front to ask us if we made a reservation. Then they told us we never made a reservation. We even showed them the phone record. So I guess by accident, no one ever documented the reservation. The manager kindly stepped in and seated us by 7 (the time of our reservation). We ordered our food, just one Signature pizza for 6 of us and some garlic bread. We waited 45 minutes after we ordered for just a single pizza. We noticed that while we were waiting, other tables who were seated after us, had all their food and multiple pizzas served. We were getting extremely hungry and impatient. We pointed out to the waitress and she brought the manager who apologized and said the tickets probably got switched out of order so the others tables three pizzas came before ours. She offered to give the garlic bread on the house which was again very kind. While the food was great, we were just a little disappointed with our luck regarding the service.

60,Zk6UqC2ozwWmQE4GKFVQ7g,Christine B.,5.0 star rating,"First, let me straighten out some confusion - the Grimaldi's in Hoboken isn't the same as the four Grimaldi's in New York, and it has nothing to do with the chain located throughout various pizza-bereft states. The Hoboken Grimaldi's was started by a former business partner of the original Patsy Grimaldi of Brooklyn. The other Grimaldi's is just a mediocre chain glomming onto a famous (but non-copyrighted) name.The tenuous relationship between the New York and Hoboken Grimaldi's pretty much sums up what you should expect from this place. First of all, the pizza is fantastic. It's a perfect iteration of a classic New York pie, a style that's becoming harder to find on this side of the river. I'd hazard that it's just as good as the original location; after all, the owner had first-hand experience of real Patsy magic. The space, however, feels nothing like the well-worn York locations. The puffy booths and puffy menus and intentionally outdated pale wood paneling feel almost as cold as a freshly-built Olive Garden. That obviously has a lot to do with this being a new location.

We ordered two gluten free anchoby pizzas and waters. To start with the food, the pizza was actually pretty good.  It didn't seem like the dough was made in house as it was unwrapped from a package before toppings were added. With that said, I liked it.  The pizzas were big enough that we couldn't finish them individually and took some home for the next day. My main issue with the place was the service.  When we were seated by the bar, the bartender sprinkled me and the girl sitting next to me with beer and apologized by saying she does that all the time.

Cut up Romaine over tossed with Cesar dressing that tasted no different than what i can purchase from the grocery store and pre-packed generic croutons all for the price of $8.00.  I am sure this place must have some left over garlic bread that they could have used to make their own croutons and if you are going to use average dressing, than serve it on the side. Eggplant Parm, nothing special.  What was good was the sauce and cheese. The eggplant looks just like the pre-breaded eggplant i purchase from Trader Joes (which I love). However, I had higher expectations and expected higher quality like freshly prepared eggplant. My mistake. Calzone: we ordered ours with Meatballs and all i can say is, ""Where's the Meat?""  If you looked hard enough you could see what looks like a one meatball chopped up into little bits.  And the nerve to have charged $2.00 per topping for a personal Calzone.  FYI if you are ordering a calzone, keep it traditional so you can limit your disappointment.   I am not through with Grimaldi's but I will give the Clinton street location a try just to see how they compare.

There was no wait time, so it was pretty easy to make the decision to eat here. Our waiter was friendly and informative. He told us about how Grimaldi's makes pizza, how fresh their ingredients are, and how they only sell whole pies, not slices.We ordered a small, which was much larger than I expected. I could barely fit the entire pizza into the frame when I took a picture. Here, I didn't want to conspicuously stand up to take a picture of food. The price isn't bad, but once you add toppings, the cost adds up quickly. We added spinach, pepperoni, and ricotta.I can see why people like these pizzas so much. It had a thin crust with a nice char on the bottom. It was heavy on the sauce and cheese. The sauce was sweet and thick and the mozzarella was so gooey. There was so much mozzarella I really didn't need the ricotta. Since the crust is thin and the sauce is heavy, it makes for a pretty floppy pizza.As per the waiter's recommendation, we also ordered the fried mozzarella cakes. They were covered in a sweet tomato sauce, but still had a slight crunch. The mozzarella inside was hot, gooey, and oozed out when I bit into it.It's a nice pizza place.

We had a bottle wine that we nursed over the next hour while we waited for our friend to arrive.During this time we ordered the mozzarella cakes. The cakes themselves were quite good, lightly crunchy on the outside and cheesy on the inside. The best bit was the sauce on the cakes. The tomato sauce was amazing and full of delicious flavor!We had a small pizza with peppers, sausage, onions, and garlic. The pizza was very tasty, the crust was nice wood charred flavor on in.

After waiting 10-15 min and not knowing how long the wait was, we asked the lady whom was taking to go orders. She was not helpful and told us we had to wait for a hostess. As we were waiting people came and left because there was no hostess. Also the people behind us tried to cut in front of us and grab a table. After waiting longer we had ask a lady if she was the hostess and she said no she was the manager.Manager: I'm the manager can i help you. Me: yes, we have been waiting for a really long time and the hostess hasn't showed up. Manager: i know but there is no where to seat youMe: okay but someone should have greeted us by now so people can decide if they want to wait or not. How is someone suppose to know how long the wait is? So how long is the wait? (As there was a free table available) Manager: please wait 10 more mins......I am not an expert on managing restaurants but it seems like they should have a hostess that stands in the front especially since this is located on a main st in hoboken. As a manager knowing that your guest are waiting you think you would let them know sorry for the wait but we hope to seat you in a little bit or something. The pizza is okay. I found it a little bland and the garlic bread did not come with marinara sauce. I had to remind the waiter that we had order drinks and never received them.

Seriously, if I order a gluten free pizza with eggplant, you probably should have told me when I ordered that the eggplant was breaded, and offered other vegetables that were grilled. Ridiculous! I'm not sure if I'll be back again. I like the pizza, but I've recently discovered better places in town. ---I've tried a couple of places in town that offer gluten-free pizza, and (so far) it doesn't get better than Grimaldis. Gluten-free goers get the opportunity to get a personal-size pizza, with their choice of toppings. Ordering gluten free pizza has always been a challenge for me, so it was great to order without any restrictions.I got my pizza with mushrooms, and not only was it delicious, it was the perfect portion.

Definitely the best ""classic style"" (what others might call ""NYC style"", even though it's better on both sides of Manhattan) pizza in Hoboken, perhaps even all of NJ - the jury is still out on that one. The crust was slightly smoky and crunchy, but chewy in the middle. The cheese was perfect, and the sauce was great too. Had meatballs and crushed garlic thrown on, it really melded well with the fresh basil they put on the pie. Bonus: They had $4 sangrias at the bar! I had a sip and instantly knew something was up, it tasted a whole lot more complex than your average sangria - the bartender said they put blackberry brandy & gin in the red sangria. I had a sip of the white (which I'm normally not a fan of), and it was just as good.All in all, Grimaldi's is definitely worth going out of your way for - top notch pizza in a cozy spot, with outdoor seating, too.",Grimaldi’s,4.0 star rating,$$,Pizza

Only qualm and reason for three stars is in hopes that they rectify their Sunday night service. Hours online and on Yelp say they're open until 11. If someone calls at 9:50 to place an order for pickup there shouldn't be an issue. Grimaldi's shouldn't answer the phone, ask what you want, let you explain your order, then tell the customer the place is closed an hour and ten minutes before they're supposed to. Their explanation is that it's a Sunday. Unsatisfactory answer I'm afraid. Don't pick up the phone if you're not open. I'm sure the owners are still paying you to work until 11, I'd bet they'd want to make money from 10-11 when the worker says it's ""closed"".Thanks for clarifying Sean. Classic miscommunication.

Fresh mozzarella, robust flavors, and crispy crusted pizzas are why I've come here for years.

Slamming plates, pulling our tablecloth while our hands still on the table almost spilling our drinks, and lots of staring. We thought maybe she had a long day, and ignored it. We came back today (for my son's birthday lunch) and was in shock with how much attitude we received from her. She acted as if we were inconveniencing her. She told us we couldn't be seated until our entire party was present and walked away. I took a seat near the bar, and when my son came in, he sat next to me, so she told him to get up since children aren't allowed at the bar. No worries. Her attitude and demeanor were all downhill from there. I wasn't sure if she was shouting at me, but she made it pretty clear that she wanted all of us to sit outside  to the point where I actually had to stop her and ask her what was going on, and if there was a problem. Once we sat outside, I was relieved to find out someone else was waiting on us. Again this time, the glaring at our table, and when I paid the check she returned the book with the change to the other side of the table.

Other than forgetting somethings we asked for, fast forward to the bill.  My sister ordered a ""Shirley Temple"" (which is just sprite, grenadine, and cherries, not an alcoholic drink). So after sitting there for 5 minutes with no drink in front (not even water, bc nobody came to ask) my sister asked for a refill. So the bill comes, they charge for 2 Shirley temples ($6 total), not crazy expensive, but we were not told by our waitress that a sprite and grenadine refill would be charged for a whole other drink.  So after waiting another 10 minutes to question the extra charge, a female manager (or owner) came around, so we got her attention. After explaining, she copped an attitude and said : ""well with the ingredients we use, we don't do free refills, like we do with our soft drinks.... but I'll find out"". (Im Sorry is sprite no longer a soft drink). The. We said: ""um it's sprite and cherry flavored syrup"". After she came back, with even more of an attitude, she said ""we took one off, but she DID give you extra cherries"" (big freaking deal).  So after we thanked her for taking one off, and after giving her part cash and part card. (After the one drink was taken off, the total was $60.35), instead of a total of $63.35 before the drink was taken off.This is were it gets EVEN WORSE. After adding up our split transactions, the total came to $65.35!!!!!) When it should have been $60.35.

My buddy let me snag a slice of his sausage and peppers and I swooned. The only downside, service sucked. Our waiter dude really had zero personality and he seemed to be annoyed that we needed extra time when ordering. Pizza's good so I'll just grab it to-go next time.",Grimaldi’s,4.0 star rating,$$,Pizza

I'll stick to just regular oj and champagne. The pizzas are made to order pick your pie size and the toppings range from 1 to 4 dollars. The salad was good but nothing special.

137,Aao29LVn4kslmebn9heARw,Ray Q.,4.0 star rating,"Can you say FRESH? This place is classy when it comes to pizza made the traditional Italian way-not NYC STYLE, so let's get that out of the way. Again this is not   the typical New York style pizza you get that from all the other conveyor belt chains and typical oven (brick style) pizza.This is coal or wood fired pizza that uses a thin dough pizza, fresh mozzarella balls-not the stuff NYC is made of (shredded mozzarella), and fresh veggies galore. The pizza oven burns around 700-900 degrees and cooks most pizzas in 10 minutes or less. The coal is loaded from the bottom and rises on one side of the oven that measures 4x6 or 5x8 feet easily accommodates several pizzas at a time. The smoke and singed pizza bottom gives the pizza a nice taste. The dough balls weigh around 8-10 ounces and are slammed against a marble slab to develop the gluten & elasticity this produces a nice thin crust which most folks love.Our pizza tasted great and the mozzarella was chewy & plentiful. My only issue was the spinach which when raw produces to much moisture and this leads to a wet pizza-yuck. So don't get spinach on these pizzas and most other dry ingredients should do well.So, why not 5 stars? The service was not attentive and they ran out of Coca Cola syrup. Note: I am a well balanced in my approach to food that entails me being a professional cook with many years experience in many types of cuisines from Latin America, Greek, Italian, and many more. I take food as the ultimate pleasure in life along with many other things. I give my reviews based on my experiences eating out at least 2 times a day and 5-6 days a week. I rarely give 1 stars and most restaurants get an average rating 3 stars, with some very good restaurants or places receiving 4 stars, and those that stand out receive 5 stars.",Grimaldi’s,4.0 star rating,$$,Pizza

140,6q9QKgww7N1HK0HRx9rnFA,Jonathan S.,3.0 star rating,"This place is pretty good. I've only eaten in the restaurant and it's your typical pizza joint with a bar, some tables around, and a line of booths. The service can be spotty here at times. Either the waitstaff is confused, or their just trying to shuffle the customers in and out. While the pizza here is pretty good, the last couple times I've had it, its been soggy at the bottom. These are typical NY slices too, so that can really mess the whole thing up. Overall the pizza is pretty good, maybe a tiny bit overpriced. One of the main reasons for the 3-stars is they used to have an appetizer called mozzarella puffs (or pillows or something) and it was fried mozzarella that was made with fresh, light, airy mozzarella that just melted in your mouth. Came back recently and ordered the fried mozzarella thinking they just changed the name, and what came out was a typical probably once-frozen fried mozzarella block.

The pizza was as I mentioned above, pretty good. Very fresh ingredients with strips of basil running through real melted mozzarella blobs. The sauce was crushed tomatoes with a little added sugar and that is the reason for three stars.The sauce completely lacks flavor, and to me this is an essential part to the pizza.

184,2xwbbCc0Sj1CWj9knYO4ng,Chris C.,4.0 star rating,"When we lived in Brooklyn, and happened to be driving home from somewhere, Grimaldi's under the bridge was our go to pizza place for a quick pie. The location was ideal coming back from Manhattan or wherever else. Now that we live in dirty Jerz, the Grimaldi's in Hoboken (not 1 but 2) satisfy the pizza urges nicely. Nice chewy crust, nice toppings, nice sauce, nice cheeze, nice employees. Nice locations. At this point you can't really split hairs if you live in the suburbs, like oh crap this crust isn't like Co. or there isn't something kitschy on top of this slice like Motorino or Keste.  After living in suburb nirvana and food hell, sitting at Grimaldi's  with the wifey, we can be at peace, lost in the zen of a solid slice of pizza, content with just alternating between staring at our pizzas before us and the smiles on our faces while chewing.  In case you get confused right behind Washington St. around 2nd street there is a giant muni parking, so don't get frustrated that you can't find a spot on the street.",Grimaldi’s,4.0 star rating,$$,Pizza

So far, this is the best pizza I've had in Hoboken.  The menu is really limited which is fine by me, do the pizza and do it right.  The pizza crust had that thin crust crunch and was chewy afterwards.  They aren't stingy with the toppings either (Even though they charge an arm and a leg for each topping you get.)  Try not to add too many toppings, not just for the fact that you'll go broke but they weigh down the pizza and will make it hard to eat.  Also, they add plenty of sauce and cheese.Looking at the restaurant from the outside, it seems like they have limited seating.  However, Grimaldi's has a whole back room too so you won't have to wait.  The service is pretty standard; nothing to complain about but, nothing to rave about.Since you're gonna pay an arm and a leg to get pizza anywhere in Hoboken, you may as well spend the cash and do it right!",Grimaldi’s,4.0 star rating,$$,Pizza

Grimaldi's was super delicious. The crust was a little thicker than I expected but that was not a bad thing at all. The mozarella cheese was so fresh and the sauce was well balanced! I ordered the small cheese pizza and ate half of the pie... after a long day of walking this was just what I needed! I believe it was about $20 for a small pizza but this was enough for 2 people to split and hey for $10 each that is definitely a deal for a sit down restaurant that was lowkey and an escape from the crowds.  Would go again in a heartbeat.,Grimaldi’s,4.0 star rating,$$,Pizza

The waitress, perhaps on her first day?, didn't bring us menus or silverware and had to be reminded (twice) about them.The pizza was decidedly meh. While plentiful, the sauce lacked flavor and despite paying $4 for roasted peppers to be added, they were few and far between and also rather bland. I also grew up in the midwest, so I am used to a lot more cheese than what came out. However, that's just how New York pizza works, so no points deducted there. The crust was lovely, but that's pretty much about it.Honestly, I feel like I'm being too generous giving it three stars instead of two, but because the other pizza places in Hoboken aren't much better, this is still the best you can get while in town.",Grimaldi’s,4.0 star rating,$$,Pizza

201,0WzT84TJm-3uPMO3OKYS8g,Sasha G.,5.0 star rating,"After walking up and down this Hoboken strip surveying restaurants with ALL types of cuisines my cousin and I decided on Grimaldi's. Actually, I did...my cousin wasn't really ""feeling pizza"" that particularly COLD night but after some brief convincing, the idea of Italian didn't feel so bad. We waited FOREVER for a table. Okay, not forever...but it was a good 35 minutes. Fortunately for us we were cozy, seated inside at the bar being amused by the very friendly Irish bartender. ""You sure you don't want a drink?"" He was too cute. Old, but cute. Our hearts were set on not eating at the bar (which was an option) so we instead laughed at the bartender's nonsense, studied the menu and we were seated at a table in what eventually felt like no time! Immediately after being seated, we knew EXACTLY what we wanted. We played pretend for a little bit (for the waitresses sake) but then we ordered. Antipasto! Eggplant parmesano! Cheese brick oven pizza! GO GO GO! A girl's gotta eat! We were famished. The waitress did seem a little thrown off by how much food we were ordering but really? What? People in Jersey don't eat? ha. Antipasto was good. You know the deal- salami, cheese, roasted red pepper. Eggplant parmesano was delicious! Crispy, pan-fried (I think) to perfection, non-greasy, cheesy, saucy. You really can't go wrong. This was perhaps one of the best eggplant parmesano's I've had. Pizza- oh man, oh man. Grimaldi's brick ovens do wonders back there. In fact, you can see them in the back. Pizza was JUST right... cheesy, fresh, hot, a bit of a ""brick-oven"" taste on the crust. Oh, boy it was good. All of this food was so affordable upon seeing the check I immediately thought ""Yeh, I'm not in Manhattan anymore."" Food definitely tasted more expensive which is a GREAT thing. Located not too far from the PATH train (which I of course hopped on after dinner to get my butt back to NYC where I belong) it's a super convenient location for any folks arriving from NYC.

I must say the Grimaldi's in Hoboken was the WORST pizza I've ever had.  Had dinner there around 6:15pm on Thurs 4-21-2016 and there were more wait staff than customers and it took forever for our drinks ( A beer and mixed drink)  to come out as the wait staff preferred to joke among themselves rather than pay attention to the customer and the bartender really had a since of 'arrogance' when making sure the drinks we made - The beer served was 'warm and skunky' and no apologies from the waiter as he didn't care - The pizza was HORRIBLE and extremely 'soggy' but no one asked how our meal was.  We had two slices off a large pizza and when asked if we wanted to take the rest 'to go' we said no thank you and they did not ask why .The antipasto salad took forever to come out and was really not good - So sorry to have eaten there as our expectations were high being this was one of the 'original' Grimaldi's in New York/New Jersey but I will thank the ones in Texas as they are for more superior than what was served in Hoboken - Also be careful as the place is small and tight and can become a 'romper  room' with all the little kids with parents that come in. Kids don't know 'bad pizza' but this paying Adult knows. If you have a great experience; then you are lucky - Terrible - Terrible - Terrible - I'll never go back and really prefer Bertucci's for a 'real brick oven pizza' that is not soggy  - One thing I k now about Jersey - You don't asked to have it 're made' as you don't know what you will get so that is why we left our leftovers  - Didn't want to leave tip but felt 'semi obligated' as I don't stiff people but if the overall service was better; the tip would have been too - Based on my  experience with Grimaldi's - Go to any other but the one in Hoboken.,Grimaldi’s,4.0 star rating,$$,Pizza

Having been to their 1st Street location and heading here early on a Saturday night, I figured there was nothing to be concerned about. I was excited to try the new locale - it was brighter, cheerier and had a bar. The quick and dirty: There were two hairs in two different orders, we were over charged on drink specials and the pizza was severely overpriced and soggy. Here are the details: We ordered the tomato and mozz salad that came with compliments of a hair, but no basil. How does an Italian place not have basil? I let the hair go - it happens. Then our pizza came and it was really soggy, not crispy like brick oven should be. While cutting into a slice and telling the waitress, another long stringy hair came out of the slice. She immediately had a new one made for us, but never offered us a round or anything for all the hairs we encountered. A new place should do something for you to make up for that kind of nastiness - even an old place should. The pizza was good, nothing spectacular, but charging me $3 for mushrooms on only half my pie is ridiculous. Every topping is about $3 whether you get it on the whole pie or half. When our bill came, we weren't allotted the special for $3 Coors drafts which were posted outside and relayed to us by the bartender. If we didn't say something, we would've paid full price. They said they didn't change the computers. Scam for all the people who don't know there are specials. I live uptown, so coming down here is a waste for shotty service and shitty, hairy food.

216,4RM-GL2MMdFKqdthmiOuPw,Heather M.,4.0 star rating,On New Year's Eve my boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a whim. Inside it wasn't busy at all and the muted lighting was inviting and made the seating area look cozy. When we walked in we were greeted by the hostess and given a table right next to the pizza preparing table and fire brick oven. What a dangerous place to put tubs of fresh mozzarella pieces because I could have tried reaching up to grab a piece (and I wanted to but I have great self control). I also saw close by a tub of the most amazing pepperoni. I had a feeling the pizza was going to blow my mouth's mind.Looking at the menu we both wished there were more options for small appetizers but then again it was probably a good thing because we tend to over do it. We wanted to start off with some drinks and ordered two Bloody Mary's. Our waitress must have misheard because she only brought me one. We were too lazy to do anything about it so we didn't say anything. I had also witnessed the bartender putting the V8 away and would have felt weird making him take everything out again. The Bloody Mary wasn't the best I've ever had but it was enjoyable. It could have used more pepper and spice. It was also a bit too watery for my taste. I like my Bloody Mary's to be slightly thick.We ended up ordering a small spinach and pepperoni pizza. The wait time was maybe 20-30 minutes even though the actual cooking time for our pizza wasn't that long--I saw it being prepared and put into the oven. When the waitress brought our pie over it looked amazing and fresh.The amount of cheese was just right and the pepperoni was so good it almost tasted like hot dogs. Usually I'm underwhelmed by crust and once the cheese and toppings part is gone I leave the rest. But the dough was light and delicious by itself. I ate everything up.One thing that annoyed me service wise was a gentleman who kept arriving at our table assuming I was done eating and almost retrieving the rest of the pizza while I tried to say I wasn't finished with food in my mouth. He did this twice as though the place was busy as a beehive but it never was while we were there. I don't think they were closing any time soon because a party of people were dining on the upper floor.Another thing that got on my nerves was hearing that AWFUL Sister Hazel song while there but that's beside the point. I had never heard of Grimaldi's before but apparently they're well known for having great pizza. Well it's true!

I was a total pizza snob when I was here in the summer of 2008, but after this past weekend, Grimaldi's is in the same league as Lombardi's, and must be considered if you're attempting to isolate the best pizza in New York.I had the pleasure of talking to the owner while taking pictures of our pie being made. The gray-haired owner was the one who built the ovens for Mr. Grimaldi over 15 years ago, and now owns both Grimaldi's locations in Hoboken.Anyway, back to the pizza. The crust is absolute perfection: thin and crispy with just the right amount of black char, yet the crust has a slightly chewy center and gives a balance of texture. The sauce and the toppings are the highest quality, and the cheese is added before AND after the sauce in slices rather than shredded bits.The fried cheese was unforgettable. Beautiful chunks of fresh mozzarella, fried to gooey perfection, covered in delicious marinara and served piping hot. My two friends and I shared this, a large pizza with three toppings and each had a beer, and we all paid $20 including tip.

235,9eyN1N6cXO7FKaZAzQCDKA,Craige M.,4.0 star rating,"My husband and I moved out of Hoboken for a reason, but sometimes a person has to be there at dinnertime and requires some food for her pie hole. As we passed Grimaldi's we noticed a sign outside advertising a small pie plus a bottle of house wine for $25. My pie hole needed filling, so we headed inside straightaway. The deal is only for sitting at the bar and only on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Luckily for us, the place was pretty dead on a Tuesday evening at 8pm, which is surprising since the restaurant is fairly small and I have waited outside the Brooklyn location for an hour before being seated. There was only one other person at the bar and he seemed to be a regular and was definitely older than we are. I gotta say, I liked the vibe a lot: relaxed and not Hobokeny at all. Hey, that's a plus in my book! We chose the Cabernet Sauvignon. It was not a bad bottle of wine at all. In fact, I'm pretty sure I drank most of it and happily. To start off, we decided to split a salad. The one called ""Salad"" is rather tasty. It has a light Italian vinaigrette and shredded cabbage on top. We got sausage on our pizza (toppings are extra when you get the deal). There was some fresh basil on top and just the right amount of sausage. The so-called ""small"" pie is 16 inches, which is 6 big slices. Mind you, this is a very thin crust, so if you are hungry, you'll eat this pie right up, but if you are dainty (like I strive to be), 2 slices is plenty and you'll have leftovers. Pop that sucker in the toaster oven the next morning and you've got a killer breakfast. Oh god, I just said ""killer."" See??

This place is different. It is definitely good, but it is definitely different.There is no line to be had here and everything is presented in a more upscale fashion than it is in BK. Linens cover the tables, not red gingham plastic tablecloths. Everything is new and nice and has less of a rustic feel than it's parental establishment.  The staff is also a bit different... we noticed that a couple people on staff seemed to be Irish (a little odd for an Italian restaurant) and overall, the place wasn't teeming with staff who seemed Italian at all. However, everyone was nice, performed their job well, and the food was excellent. This location also offers a bar with an assortment of beer on tap and a pleasant bartender to go along with your selection.When asked for a suggestion, our waiter didn't hesitate to suggest a white pizza, which comes without sauce, and to add tomatoes.

First of all, they were blaring punk rock from the early 2000s, don't get me wrong, I was all about Blink 182 and the The Used in middle school, but I don't want to hear them while I'm trying to have a nice dinner with friends. The waitress spilled an entire beer all over our table and one of my friends. They didn't offer us a new table and barely helped clean it up so we just sat with a puddle under our table. Our food was brought out sporadically, not all together, which was annoying since we had a party of 6 and obviously all wanted to eat together. When the waitress brought my ravioli out to me she again spilled some sauce on my lap. The food itself was TERRIBLE! The calzones were burned on the bottom (black) and the pasta was over-cooked and soggy. We ended up just eating the food because we were on a time frame and didn't want to have to wait for more food. The waitress was apologetic. Everything was overpriced for the quality and amount of food that we got. Our checks and billing got all mixed up and the waitress couldn't seem to figure things out. We asked to speak to the manager just to bring things to her attention. She was extremely rude. We weren't expecting any favors or free handouts, just a simple ""sorry."" She had the nerve to argue with us and say that the food was just ""crisp"" because they bake it in a coal oven...no lady, it was BURNED. She also said that she's never received any complaints before, which I fine extremely hard to believe. She continued to defend everything, never fully apologizing or offering us anything. I'm not one to complain much about food or dining experiences. Having worked in the restaurant industry for years, I know it's hectic at times.

This location looks and feels alot better than the brooklyn one in terms of decor and atmosphere. We ordered a large pizza half veggie for me the other half with sausage for my friend ,some slices were a little salty for my taste maybe its the cheese i wasnt sure, it was a nice thin crust and it tasted goo.Overall it was a good experience i would'v given them more stars if some of the slices werent salty.",Grimaldi’s,4.0 star rating,$$,Pizza
331,90aLoadK8JD7vltkGvDpqA,M F.,4.0 star rating,"I absolutely love Grimaldi's and eat it a lot. Last night was the first time I tried the Washington St. location and was really disappointed with the experience. The pizza tastes equally as delicious, but we ordered two personal pies and they were significantly smaller than the Clinton St. location. I understand that there are different people working, but as a brand, they have to be consistent with their product - especially if they are charging the same amount.",Grimaldi’s,4.0 star rating,$$,Pizza
332,q4E78tFXCvmBLWJwfWzQaw,Rick K.,5.0 star rating,"Brick oven pizza at its best!Upscale decor welcomes you as well as the friendly staff. Still a casual atmosphere but the trappings are up a few notches from the Clinton Street location.The long bar is impressive and inviting...the wine selection has multiplied but remains very affordable.Best of all, the wood-fired brick oven pizza remains superlative. One important note...Grimaldi's on Washington is open for lunch and dinner 7 days a week. Clinton Street offers lunch only on Fridays.Simply, the best!",Grimaldi’s,4.0 star rating,$$,Pizza

338,EFjKPLPpGtU_GZINbUf__w,AJ K.,5.0 star rating,This is a great spot for an authentic pizza.  They use the freshest ingridients and real mozzarella like the original in brooklyn.  I even hear that they bring in nyc water to make the dough.  A tad pricey but what isn't in hoboken. At least you get what you pay for.,Grimaldi’s,4.0 star rating,$$,Pizza
