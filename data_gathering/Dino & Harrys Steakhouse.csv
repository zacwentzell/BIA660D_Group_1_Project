I remember this place as Frankie and Johnnies when I started to attend special events like political functions to birthday celebrations or taking my family for an amazing meal. The service, decor and food are 5 stars.I never had issues here just amazing memories. I highly recommend to start out with the Applewood Smoked Bacon ($16) and the Fried Calamari ($17).  For entrees I would recommend the aged steaks whether it's the T-bone or Sirloin steak (16 oz - $41.00 or 22 oz. - $52).  (They have their own house steak sauce). If you're not into meat I recommend the Chilean Sea Bass Atlantic Salmon ($33) or the Alaskan Halibut ($33).I think the T-bone is a bit farrier which gives a little bit more flavor than the sirloin but for a nice 16 oz. You're going to be just fine if you enjoy a nice steak! You have to try to make room for dessert which are amazing as well, I recommend trying the Snowbroken (an oreo dessert) or the strawberry rhubarb which is sweet and tarty.The owner Dino is mostly there and very friendly to approach and if you're lucky they have a pianoist or a band performing on certain evenings which is delightful and let's you make some requests.They accept cash or credit just make sure you area able to find parking prior, there are lots available which you can find.  I believe for 3 hours and it costs around $8.00.",Dino & Harrys Steakhouse,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Wine, Bars"
1,mzGgk_y_3juq-aY08vmp6w,Bjorn P.,3.0 star rating,"Came to Dino and Harrys on a Wednesday evening. Reservations for 630. The place is charming and old but classy.  A grand piano in the front. Our seats were great - off to the side by the window so as not to be in the noisy main area - was feeling the more serene scene. The service was uninspired but adequate. There is a large wine list but no sommelier...the wait staff ""know the wine"". Not sure that they really know the wine but they knew enough I guess. Here's what we had:- Bread to start (warm and crusty)- Bacon (very good)- Penne cacio e Pepe (excellent - crisp peas and asparagus and al dente pasta. They split with no issue for an appetizer)- Porterhouse for 2 (it was ok. Something was off though. A little too chewy although it looked ok)- Creme Brûlée and Oreo desert (both good)- Bottle of St. Emillion (very good and reasonable)The reason for the moderate rating comes down to the sleepy service (it took a long time to get food), the ""ok"" porterhouse and what I'm currently feeling which is stomach pains. My friend also is feeling the same. In any case - I've heard the ribeye is better so I will be back at some point and hopefully have a better experience at which point I'll definitely increase my rating.",Dino & Harrys Steakhouse,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Wine, Bars"
2,JROIkn3Mg0APSXTtS7VH5w,Christine P.,1.0 star rating,"I had a bad feeling about this place from the moment we stepped inside. The areas around the maitre d's desk and the bar were packed with people still waiting to be seated for their 8pm reservations after 9pm (kind of defeating the purpose of a reservation at all, especially since they require a credit card to make one). No one seemed happy, ranging from mildly agitated to infuriated. It took a while for anyone to speak with us. The maitre d eventually reported it would be around 15-20 minutes, to which another guest responded ""it'll be an hour"" (another guest waiting for their 8pm reservation). Needless to say they had a few thoughts to share with management.Another guest with an 8:30 reservation started to complain again. He was curtly told there were still people waiting from 8pm. At this point I lost interest in dining here, as they clearly lacked basic customer service skills and were blatantly lying to their guests in order to keep them angrily waiting. Definitely a shame, because I've heard the food is quite good. When we tried to cancel our reservation, the maitre d attempted to keep us waiting, pointing out it had only been 10 minutes after our reservation. Once I told her I just heard her say they were backed up by over an hour, she finally relented and let us cancel the reservation.Apparently the people who stayed regretted their decision, due to the long wait and poor service during the meal, so I'm glad we left.

15,NMpcnw2pSRoi1b8EG11IFw,Jonathan S.,2.0 star rating,"I don't know the history, heritage, legacy or legend of this place, but to put it mildly, was extremely disappointed. Do not make the mistake of assuming you are going to a first (or even 2nd) rate steakhouse.The positives: Started with the ""Beef salad"" and was pleasantly surprised with the well aged, and perfectly prepared thin strips of beef layered on top. $16 The negatives: ambiance, price, and taste of the lamb chops and fillet mignon sandwhich, $26 and $30 respectively.They simply don't know how to prepare medium well lamb (or beef). The chops came out way too charred and my wife couldn't eat them. I joked that I wouldn't even feed it to our dog. The fillet mignon sandwhich was also prepared medium well as requested but was just strips of not very tender beef with unimpressive flavor. I neglected to mention that I don't like cheese on mine, so when it was brought over I was hoping they would make another one for me, but no luck....I guess understandably so at $30 ($8 at any other diner - same flavor).Anyway, long story short...would I ever go again? HELL NO! Kinda surprised how they stay in business at those exorbitant prices, unimpressive flavor, and inability to properly cook meat to 'medium well'. They wouldn't survive in NYC and I am baffled as to how they stay open in Hoboken.",Dino & Harrys Steakhouse,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Wine, Bars"
16,8aj22jFDPfot_3Y0PcXbTA,Rachael F.,4.0 star rating,"This is one of the better steaks you'll find in Hoboken. It doesn't stack up to the upper echelon of NYC steakhouses (Peter Luger's, Gallagher's, Del Frisco's), but it gets the job done.It was a group of 6 and we were hunnnnn-gry. To start off we went with Grilled Octopus ($21), Tuna Tartare ($20), Burrata ($18), and Sliced Tomato and Onion ($13). That last one was something my boyfriend's dad ordered that I would never normally opt for. But he's an extremely picky eater and doesn't like basically anything, so he went for us. The octopus was cooked perfectly and wasn't chewy or rubbery at all like you find at even some nicer places. The tartare (or is it ""tartar""?) was held together by a great mayo/sauce that really made the dish. The burrata was rich and creamy, just like you'd want.For my entree I got the Atlantic Salmon with roasted potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and a ""grain mustard emulsion"" ($33). I'm not exactly an emulsion expert, but I might become one. My boyfriend's mom got the Sea Scallops with sweet potato puree, lobster beurre blanc, and sauteed green beans ($34). I had a little bite and they were as good as any scallops I've had at non-seafood restaurants. My boyfriend and his dad split the 32 oz porterhouse for 2 ($80) and then we got a bunch of sides for the table - mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, Brussles sprouts, and steamed asparagus (all $10).Our waiter was really nice, I'd rate the service 5 stars. The ambiance is classic steakhouse - lots of wood white tablecloths. The wine list was pretty extensive. There was nothing that I'd say was ""cheap"", but there were bottles across a number of price ranges. Apparently, there's sometimes live music and there's also a TV if you care about a big game or something.I don't think I'd make a trip across the river just to come here, but I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good steakhouse in Hoboken or that general part of NJ",Dino & Harrys Steakhouse,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Wine, Bars"
17,-hM1ygWSe5t32OCICsyIlg,Vasco R.,3.0 star rating,"Tl;dr- The only thing holding this restaurant back is the extremely high prices of their food. If this place wasn't so expensive I would visit again in the future, but I will not because I am not upper-class.  This place is just too expensive. We had an 8 o'clock reservation and were seated immediately. The waitress was good. our waiter was not invasive and waited on our cues for when we were ready to order. Our waitress was actually really goodThe interior was lit well enough to be able to read the menus and it was dark enough to provide that warm setting it is going for. It's actually really nice and decorated well. The tables are spaced well enough apart so it does not feel cramped. The restaurant is not that big. Because it is not that big it can get pretty loud sense the bar area is front and center.I had the fillet mignon medium rare. It came out to order which is good. Your meal will not come with any sides as you must order them as extra. Meal was good.  it came served with dice the mushrooms on top. The exercise I ordered I got brussels sprouts. Theu were good too.Before I begin to discuss the matter of the pricing, you will notice I've given this review three stars. If the prices were better this would be a four star review. The restaurant is priced as an upscale restaurant and as a matter fact is more expensive then many restaurants in New York City that I have been too. My filet mignon was $51 and the Side ofbrussels sprouts was $10 which means that my dish was $61. My girlfriend got the petite fillet mignon which is 6 ounces and it was $41. We split the brussels sprouts and probably should have got one more side because there wasn't enough food. This is mainly sense the filet mignon is a smaller steak which I fully understand though the sides should come with the meal.

I hate to send items back, I might send one item back a year if that.  But the steak wasn't even the slightest bit pink.  Now I knew what was going to happen but there was nothing I could do it about it.  The next one came out purple.... basically meat sushi!  I wasn't about to send it back again but I didn't order black and blue, so they screwed up the order twice.  They did the same exact thing to my buddy as well.  Out of the 10 steaks ordered, 5 were cooked correctly.  50% is not ok.  Also, they missed one of the sides when everything came out.  So it was all just a bit of a mess.They of course did nothing to apologize, no here's a slice of cake for us messing up over and over.  Yeah, it's going to be a while until I go back.",Dino & Harrys Steakhouse,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Wine, Bars"

Do not make the mistake of assuming you are going to a first (or even 2nd) rate steakhouse.The positives: Started with the ""Beef salad"" and was pleasantly surprised with the well aged, and perfectly prepared thin strips of beef layered on top. $16 The negatives: ambiance, price, and taste of the lamb chops and fillet mignon sandwhich, $26 and $30 respectively.They simply don't know how to prepare medium well lamb (or beef). The chops came out way too charred and my wife couldn't eat them. I joked that I wouldn't even feed it to our dog. The fillet mignon sandwhich was also prepared medium well as requested but was just strips of not very tender beef with unimpressive flavor. I neglected to mention that I don't like cheese on mine, so when it was brought over I was hoping they would make another one for me, but no luck....I guess understandably so at $30 ($8 at any other diner - same flavor).Anyway, long story short...would I ever go again? HELL NO! Kinda surprised how they stay in business at those exorbitant prices, unimpressive flavor, and inability to properly cook meat to 'medium well'. They wouldn't survive in NYC and I am baffled as to how they stay open in Hoboken.",Dino & Harrys Steakhouse,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Wine, Bars"
36,8aj22jFDPfot_3Y0PcXbTA,Rachael F.,4.0 star rating,"This is one of the better steaks you'll find in Hoboken. It doesn't stack up to the upper echelon of NYC steakhouses (Peter Luger's, Gallagher's, Del Frisco's), but it gets the job done.It was a group of 6 and we were hunnnnn-gry. To start off we went with Grilled Octopus ($21), Tuna Tartare ($20), Burrata ($18), and Sliced Tomato and Onion ($13). That last one was something my boyfriend's dad ordered that I would never normally opt for. But he's an extremely picky eater and doesn't like basically anything, so he went for us. The octopus was cooked perfectly and wasn't chewy or rubbery at all like you find at even some nicer places. The tartare (or is it ""tartar""?) was held together by a great mayo/sauce that really made the dish. The burrata was rich and creamy, just like you'd want.For my entree I got the Atlantic Salmon with roasted potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and a ""grain mustard emulsion"" ($33). I'm not exactly an emulsion expert, but I might become one. My boyfriend's mom got the Sea Scallops with sweet potato puree, lobster beurre blanc, and sauteed green beans ($34). I had a little bite and they were as good as any scallops I've had at non-seafood restaurants. My boyfriend and his dad split the 32 oz porterhouse for 2 ($80) and then we got a bunch of sides for the table - mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, Brussles sprouts, and steamed asparagus (all $10).Our waiter was really nice, I'd rate the service 5 stars. The ambiance is classic steakhouse - lots of wood white tablecloths. The wine list was pretty extensive. There was nothing that I'd say was ""cheap"", but there were bottles across a number of price ranges. Apparently, there's sometimes live music and there's also a TV if you care about a big game or something.I don't think I'd make a trip across the river just to come here, but I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good steakhouse in Hoboken or that general part of NJ",Dino & Harrys Steakhouse,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Wine, Bars"
37,-hM1ygWSe5t32OCICsyIlg,Vasco R.,3.0 star rating,"Tl;dr- The only thing holding this restaurant back is the extremely high prices of their food. If this place wasn't so expensive I would visit again in the future, but I will not because I am not upper-class.  This place is just too expensive. We had an 8 o'clock reservation and were seated immediately. The waitress was good. our waiter was not invasive and waited on our cues for when we were ready to order. Our waitress was actually really goodThe interior was lit well enough to be able to read the menus and it was dark enough to provide that warm setting it is going for. It's actually really nice and decorated well. The tables are spaced well enough apart so it does not feel cramped. The restaurant is not that big. Because it is not that big it can get pretty loud sense the bar area is front and center.I had the fillet mignon medium rare. It came out to order which is good. Your meal will not come with any sides as you must order them as extra. Meal was good.  it came served with dice the mushrooms on top. The exercise I ordered I got brussels sprouts. Theu were good too.Before I begin to discuss the matter of the pricing, you will notice I've given this review three stars. If the prices were better this would be a four star review. The restaurant is priced as an upscale restaurant and as a matter fact is more expensive then many restaurants in New York City that I have been too. My filet mignon was $51 and the Side ofbrussels sprouts was $10 which means that my dish was $61. My girlfriend got the petite fillet mignon which is 6 ounces and it was $41. We split the brussels sprouts and probably should have got one more side because there wasn't enough food. This is mainly sense the filet mignon is a smaller steak which I fully understand though the sides should come with the meal.

My friends steak was too well done, and the waitress didn't even bother to check on us. She was all over the table near us though.

Unfortunately, dining is about more than just the food, so the service plays a big part in my rating. Dino & Harry's was on my boyfriend's ""must try"" list of Hoboken places, so we headed there for his birthday on a Saturday night. Because we had other plans that night with friends, we went for an early dinner (around 5:15). When we arrived, the restaurant was basically empty, yet we were still seated pretty far back. This wouldn't have been an issue as we were dressed in a dressy casual way, so could see why we weren't front and center. The service was chilly at best, and extremely rushed. Within a second of being seated, we were asked about drinks and our server seemed annoyed when I said that we hadn't looked at the menu yet. She was back minutes later, so we made a rushed wine decision, though our instincts were right because the wine was delicious. As soon as drinks were delivered, our waitress was back to take appetizer orders (the applewood smoked bacon for BF, Caesar salad for me). Appetizers arrived quickly. The bacon is absolutely beautiful to look at, and my boyfriend said it was incredible. The pieces are cut thick, and again according to him, are perfectly cooked. My salad was also very good - Caesar salad can sometimes taste too fishy or overdressed, but this was great. I ordered the Chilean sea bass for dinner and boyfriend ordered the filet mignon. Again, entrees arrived very quickly. The sea bass was lovely, cooked perfectly and was a great portion size. The filet was as a filet should be - cooked beautifully, which is what a steakhouse is all about. This place, as to be expected, is NOT accommodating to vegetarians, but again, it's a steakhouse so that should be assumed. Pescetarians can enjoy a variety of seafood dishes. Like I said, the food at Dino & Harry's would give the place a five star, and that may be what some are looking for, and that alone. I would not return there because for $150+ for two, I'd also like good service, which I do not think is not asking for too much. For arriving at 5:15, we were finished with wine, appetizers, and dinner by 6 pm, so not even an hour later.

Small crepes but really tasty, basically like a bisque sauce on top. We had filet mignon, portions were of a good size and the steak tasted incredible. We also order bacon brussel sprouts and 3 cheese gnocchi which were both delicious. The food was not at all an issue. Problem was the service. It took me a little to realize why I felt the initial conversation felt awkward and it was because the waitress came over and said ""Anything to drink?"" Didn't introduce herself, didn't say we have some specials, happy Valentine's Day, didn't even say HELLO. Just, ""Anything to drink?"" I normally do not care about service too much but if I'm dropping $250 on a meal, you better dance, curtsey, and treat your patrons with respect. I wish I could address which waitress it was but because she never told us her name I can't. You shouldn't address your patrons like you're at the damn Malibu diner at 3am. On top of that, after our appetizer came we had to literally hunt down this waitress to get a second round of drinks. You think if we're dropping $30 for a round of drinks the waitress would be constantly asking if we wanted more drinks. Nope. Just the initial incredibly rude asking of if we wanted drinks, and then never again until we hunted her down to get more drinks. If the food wasn't over the top this rating would be a 1. But on Valentines Day you think you'd have your best foot forward at your restaurant but they didn't. Really unpleasant experience with the service. I won't be coming back because of it.

As for side we did the potatoes au gratin and Brussels sprouts they were typical portions and tasty.The one thing that really bothered me about this place was the service.

Just like many other Hoboken restaurants, it's pretty crowded and noisy. In this place, part of that ""noise"" comes in the form of live entertainment, which is fun to hear. Our server was excellent and very attentive to the needs of our table. Our table ordered blue point oysters, French onion soup, and Simple Cobb type salad. The oysters were flavorful it but I didn't think they were fresh enough. The salad was simple but delicious. The French onion soup had a wholelotta cheese so I didn't take a bite of it. rib eyes and a petite filet mignon for the main entree. Our sides consisted of creamed spinach, au gratin taters, asparagus, and Mac n Cheese. My steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. It was the right size (16oz). For dessert, we ordered the strawberry rhubarb dessert and snow broken (Oreo crumbs ice cream and coconut shavings). Both desserts were delicious! I would come back for the steaks and desserts. However I would recommend sitting away from the kitchen because the noise level in the back by that kitchen door got pretty loud so conversations turned into yelling. Hah!

The soup was the best French onion I have ever had. It was delicious. The salad was good but you could really taste the anchovies in the dressing. I'm sure most people like that and that's probably how real Caesar salads are supposed to taste but I wasn't a huge fan. The steak was insanely good though. It was cooked perfectly and the outside had this crispy crust on it that we couldn't stop talking about. We were so full but we ate the whole thing because we couldn't stop. The spinach was really good too. I've been here 3 times and have never been disappointed with a meal.

81,cjq1MtMJN1skmSmp1li6tA,Dan G.,2.0 star rating,"To some this place might be nice, but I urge you to try ANY steakhouse in the city to understand how short this place falls from a service perspective. Unfortunately this place is trying to be a Manhattan steakhouse, so it's going to get reviewed like one.....I was hoping for good things based on some other reviews, but sorely disappointed. This place makes a killing taking advantage of New Jersey people that haven't travelled across the river. Instead they are presented with service comparable to IHOP with prices that arguably beat Manhattan. It started on the wrong end with attitude and waiting 45 minutes to get a table we reserved. Good thing this place is basically an Irish pub that serves steak, so we had some Manhattan priced drinks getting nudged by server traffic every 30 seconds. We tried to stay patient because this is supposedly THE place to go for steak in Hoboken.We were just about to give up and we finally got seated. On a positive note, our server was very friendly and helpful. But when I'm spending $150 per person on a meal, I expect service to match. There was our server and maybe one bus person for the whole place. We spent a lot of time with empty drinks and finished plates sitting in front of us. They didn't even refresh bread plates with appetizer plates, so I got to enjoy some bacon dipped in olive oil and bread crumbs. Then came the main course....Most steakhouses when serving steak for two will take the initiative to serve the first portion, not this place. Here's a knife, go....here's some sides, go...The food, overall, was just okay. The steaks were not the best cuts, but they were cooked as ordered. The sides were much smaller than usual places in the category. We were unable to get much more than a tablespoon serving to each of the 4 people at the table.I'll give this place 2 stars for a friendly server, but I won't be going back again.",Dino & Harrys Steakhouse,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Wine, Bars"

The vibe at Dino and Harry's is spot on classic steakhouse with a mahogany, mirror, and glass bar, vintage tile floors, warmly painted walls and low lighting. The room was bustling on a Friday at 8:30, packed with rosy faced men in button downs on their second (or third) happy hour cocktails.We were seated at a table in the bar area by the front window, the hostess explaining that it was more fun there as a musician was about to begin his set. My take is we were markedly younger than other patrons and she thought we wouldn't be as bothered by the noise. It was too loud and the music, heavy on Ben Folds Five and Coldplay did not fit the environment.Of the appetizers, the thick cut applewood smoked bacon was a hit. Flavorless with unseasoned batter, the calamari was not. All of the sides, lyonnaise potatoes, macaroni and cheese, sautéed spinach, and Brussel sprouts, were delicious. Everyone in our party ordered filet. Though boring, this coincidence offered an opportunity to gauge the kitchen's skill in cooking meat to temp. We had 2 medium rare, a medium, and a medium well. I was happy to see that my medium rare filet had a hard sear outside and was warm and red in the center. All of the temperatures were perfect. When it came time for dessert, the waiter, who was notably absent after taking our orders, apologized and offered us a complimentary round of drinks, a highly appreciated gesture. The desserts were unremarkable, easily the worst part of the meal. But I enjoyed my serving of port and my friends loved their beautifully presented coffees with Bailey's.

Let me clarify; five star food with good service, but some things were off that a five star restaurant would never overlook.The restaurant itself if beautiful. You feel as though you entered into history. We arrived early for a 7pm reservation to have a cocktail at the bar. The bartender made excellent drinks - I have an Old Fashioned and my wife had a dirty martini. The first thing I noticed, however is that there was no music playing, but instead ESPN was on the TV. Look I have nothing against sports...I love sports. But when I walk in to a steakhouse on a date during dinner hours I expect some music for ambience and the TV - if there is one - should be on mute. When we finished our cocktails the hostess sat us. Now mind you it's the middle of winter and we have big jackets. She never offered to take our jackets from us. As you enter the dining room you see people sitting with big bulky jackets on the backs of their chairs. I typically don't even like to check my coat, but I expect certain things when going to a traditional steak house and that's one of them. Is that weird? Anyway...When we're sat we have a beautiful table next to the window in the quiet side room. We're greeted by our waitress who drops off the menus. When I open the menu it's FILTHY. I mean really filthy. Blood and drinks stains all over the menu. Look if you're charging $50 a steak (which is worth it by quality) I expect that you are properly managed and looking through the menus daily to see where you need to print new menus. I mean they are literally printed on printer paper so it's not hard. For our dinner we ordered a bottle of the Etude Pinot Noir. Roughly a $80 bottle. Not crazy, but not inexpensive. The wine was lovely, but the bottle, like the menu was a bit dirty. It had wine spills on the label. I mean c'mon, blood on the menu, wine all over an unopened bottle. Keep it clean people. But I digress.... The food!I ordered the Filet med rare. It was perfect. I mean absolutely perfect. My wife ordered the petite filet med plus. It was also perfect. Cheers to the chef. With the steak we ordered creamed spinach and brussel sprouts. Amazing.So as I said above, I really want to give this place 5 stars. I love it and I'll return, but if you want to be the best you have to act like the best and it seems as though owners and managers are not doing their jobs 100%",Dino & Harrys Steakhouse,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Wine, Bars"

This is a business, this and that yata yata yata.. Perhaps they were all stress as it seemed like we were being treated like jerks when we were simply asking for some options.  Anyways i'm not sure what happened but Dino's mood changed and he looked into trying to accomodate us.  In the end it could not be done but we appreciated the fact that Dino tried to do his best.  We shared some shots and ordered for 4 while the other rotated through the bar.Now comes the food part.  We ordered the porterhouses med-rare and they were outstanding.  Absolutely delicious steak.  Their steak sauce tasted like they mixed ketchup and worcestershire sauce but that didn't really bother me.  The sides were all great as well, we had the potatoes, corn and onions.Overall, the decor is what you would expect for a great steakhouse, the owner Dino turned out to be a great guy, and the food was outstanding.  I would certainly repeat.",Dino & Harrys Steakhouse,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Wine, Bars"

My wife's filet medallions were quite substantial and I enjoyed the petite filet and baked potato.

Let me tell you, this fish was perfectly cooked! Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The balsamic sauce it was paired with had me saying OMG and I nearly licked it off the plate!The rib eye was sheer perfection - crispy crunchy outside but a nice bleeding medium rare on the inside. Might be one of the best steaks I've ever had, and I've had Peter Lugers.  Also, the corn was amazing, it was sweet but I was expecting that and I like sweet creamed corn.  The Shiraz we had was very reasonably priced for such a fancy establishment.Also, our waitress was sweet and always made us feel like a valued customer, just wish I remembered her name so I could give her a shout out.  We will definitely be coming back for more!!",Dino & Harrys Steakhouse,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Wine, Bars"

We weren't aware that it was Hudson Restaurant Week, and appreciated that we weren't pressured to order from the Restaurant Week or regular menu. We did both end up going with the Restaurant Week menu since the selections were good and the price was even better. I had an arugula salad to start, which was just okay, and my boyfriend had the bacon, which he said was amazing (I'd assume so, since he didn't let me try any!). We both had the 16 oz. sirloin, medium rare, as our main dish, and both were cooked perfectly. The seasonings they used on the steaks were delicious as well, and the 16 oz. size gave us plenty of leftovers to take home. For dessert we both had the molten chocolate cake, which was excellent. I'd also like to note that the service and the meal were paced perfectly - our server didn't try to rush us (I was afraid this might happen since we ordered from the Restaurant Week menu) and each course was well-timed.The ambiance upon walking into the restaurant is nice - it definitely has that old-school steakhouse look. There was a pianist playing in the bar area, and it would have been nice to sit near the action. The bar and restaurant were loud and pretty crowded, but we were sat in a strange little hallway-like area near the windows which, while quiet and cozy, wasn't the ideal spot for us.All in all we had a very nice dinner, and hopefully we'll be back for another special occasion.",Dino & Harrys Steakhouse,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Wine, Bars"

AND THEN THE TABLE NEXT TO US WAS SERVED THE OCTOPUS.  They arrived after us and ordered after us.  We were completely flabbergasted.  The steak was good, but the whole experience was completely unsavory.  We spent close to $300 on a meal that left us with a pit in our stomachs.  Dino and Harrys, get your staff together.",Dino & Harrys Steakhouse,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Wine, Bars"

Always enjoyed the food and service.Unfortunately, this past Saturday night my opinion of this place changed forever. A few points to preface. First of all, my wife, son and I have probably eaten here half a dozen times in 2013 alone. We always come between 5:30pm and 6pm and never have an issue getting a seat. Also, they do not take reservations, so it is first come first serve. On Saturday, we brought our nephews so we had five people in total. When we arrive, at 5:55pm to a restaurant that is 75% EMPTY, the hostess says it is going to be a problem seating us because a party of over four people needs a reservation. I hate when restaurants go in between like this. Either require a reservation or don't. There is no point in doing both.She checks with the manager and they say the next time they can seat us is 7:30pm. This is impossible since my son is 2 and would be a wild man halfway through dinner at that time. This brings up another interesting point. They are counting my son as a fifth when a two-year-old really shouldn't count in the equation.Since they were unwilling to help us out, even though we had three children, all under the age of 10, we left. The manager sensed we were quite angry and chased after us saying ""what do you want me to do it's the holidays, I have a lot of parties coming"".Maybe take care of your best customers, especially when they are trying to show their nephews a nice dinner in Hoboken.I will never go here again.

For appetizers, I had the crab cake with remoulade sauce and he had French onion soup. The crab cake was huge and could almost have been a meal, and was stuffed with giant pieces of succulent crab meat. For our main entrees, I ordered pan-roasted salmon with potatoes in a boullionaise sauce and my boyfriend ordered porterhouse steak (medium rare). The salmon was cooked perfectly, but was so large I couldn't finish it. Likewise, my boyfriend couldn't even get through half his steak.

The loudness of the dining room was pleasantly muffled and made for a romantic experience.Our server was a lovely, grandma-esque lady who was attentive but not overbearing. We began our meal with the Salmon Tartare, which was incredible. A perfect combination of the fresh fish flavorfully combined with ingredients that stood alone yet melded together in harmony.Our main course was the 48oz Porterhouse for 2 - Medium Rare, Augratin Potatoes and Brussel Sprouts with Pancetta. The steak was very well seasoned (perhaps, for some, overseasoned) with a nice dark crust, and the Filet portion was perfection. Unfortunately, we discovered that the New York Strip side was gristly and inedible for the price tag. Our waitress realized something was wrong, so we told her our disappointment with the steak. Without hesitation, she offered us an entirely new Porterhouse, despite the fact we had demolished the Filet side. Seeing so much meat as overkill, we suggested that she simply bring out a new NY Strip, which she quickly fulfilled.We left Dino & Harry's with full bellies, an entire meal of leftovers, a bill charging us only for a NY Strip versus our 48oz Porterhouse, and a renewed faith in humanity.",Dino & Harrys Steakhouse,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Wine, Bars"

I had the tomato/basil soup for an appetizer, which I must say may be the best I have ever had. It was thick and bisque-like so I really enjoyed it. For dinner I had the filet mignon and my boyfriend had the porterhouse. Although both were medium rare, I thought his steak was way more flavorful. Either way I enjoyed both ! For sides we had the lobster mac and cheese which was to die for and the mashed potatoes, also very good. They had a great wine selection and the drinks were nicely made. So why not 5 stars you ask? Well for starters the hostess sat us almost 40 minutes after our reservation. She was on her cell phone when we arrived and after about a minute looked up so I could tell her my name. For the 40 minutes we were at the bar (which was not bad since we had some coctails) she proceeded to tell us that she didnt know where the bus boy was and that our table would be cleaned any minute. This was not very professional at all. Once seated our server was a little slow getting everything to us and only checked on us about once. The ambiance was very loud as well.

141,W_IMELIgKjYpCW-V1mV7tA,John F.,4.0 star rating,"I had a great steak and a great time at Dino and Harry's.  But for one mistake, this would have been a five star experience.The Mistake:  I ordered my porterhouse medium rare, I got it medium well.  This is obviously a huge mistake.  However, this can't be the chef's fault.  Steak chefs know how to cook a steak medium rare.  Odds are, the server plated and served me the wrong steak. I showed the server my overcooked steak, she apologized and returned the steak to the kitchen.The Fix:   I had a perfectly cooked, delicious medium rare steak on my plate within 10 minutes.  Steak was tender with that hearty, buttery flavor I love.  Before I had my steak, I enjoyed the applewood smoked bacon appetizer, which was delicious.  Although this spot is expensive, you certainly get what you pay for.  Considering the amount of food/drink we ordered, our tab really wasn't that bad.

I had only seen the restaurant from the outside for quite some time before I said screw it and made a reservation for my birthday. The best way to describe Dino & Harry's is that it's a necessary establishment that belongs in Hoboken. This is the only steakhouse in Hoboken that matters. Yes, there are restaurants that have good steak in Hoboken. But this place has it all. Between service, ambience, and excellent food, I'd recommend Dino & Harry's to anyone who's looking for a great steakhouse experience. Sure, you can visit Ruth Chris in Weehawken, but it's not the same. There's nothing about Dino & Harry's that feels like it's a chain or franchise. The best part?

But let me tell you, I ate every piece of fish imaginable here and it was all delectable! Started with oysters and shrimp cocktail. Oysters were fresh and decent size. Shrimp were colossal. Crabcake special was next (yes, we devoured a million apps) and it was tons of lump crabmeat, not just a packed piece of breading with some crab thrown in. I opted for the cod - it was so fresh and tender. I loved it. I took a chance, as I was not sure how much I loved cod. It was cooked in a light sauce with tomatoes and zucchini, just yummy.

In addition I had requested a surprise dessert to be delivered at the end of our meal and that message failed to be passed along. Our waitress also seemed like the most miserable person in the world. The steaks were well cooked and the portions were large but definitely not the best stake I've ever had. And $10 for a side of plain boring mashed potatoes is a joke! Whereas the Brussels sprouts were amazing and well worth the $10. The scallops entree and tuna tartare were delicious and well priced. The wine also seemed over priced...

Each time they found a table and made it work.The ""highlight "" came shortly after our engagement when we came here during the Xmass holidays to have our parents meet for the first time, another special occasion for sure.I actually called the owner Dino a week earlier when I personally made the reservation. I told him how I was planning this special evening, and asked for a nice table to be put aside for the occasion. He was cool and was on board with the plans.I pulled up front checked in with the valet attendant , and checked our coats.The place was decorated so beauitifly for the holiday, with the full size Christmas tree, and the piano player in the bar area, decorations adorn the entire restaurant.It seemed the perfect setting for the family's first meeting together.We all went to the bar and got to know each other while I checked in with the hostess only to be told, you guessed it ...     ""what reservation."" ?!!  Ugh!

I felt bad for whose ever keys they were. Meanwhile, what happened here? Did they use my jacket to park another persons car and forget to put the keys on their board for return!???

The only possible superior steak would be from Peter Lugers in Brooklyn but, if you are already in Hoboken, why go to there? Seriously, anyone that gives this place a less-than-stellar review either had the rare misfortune of getting a bad cut of meat, work for another restaurant, or feels slighted by the down-to-earth service (for the record, the service is great, but some people just need the continual white-glove, ass-kissing service that some restaurants have). The steaks are unreal (even though the sirloin is the signature cut, try the filet--comes in petite and large varieties). They also have a gorgeous porterhouse, with both the sirloin and filet, but I prefer the off-the-bone filet the best; a-la-carte sides are amazing (creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, and tomatoes and onions are my favorite) and the appetizers are very good (shrimp cocktail, especially). Additionally, they just started doing a pasta dish (ravioli of the day kinda thing). Without a doubt, the best pasta I have ever had, and this includes Italy, an Italian mother, and Augustinos in town. My only complaint is that the pasta is a bit pricey for what you get, but it is so difficult to make and made to order, so I understand the cost. Therefore, my complaint is nullified. I routinely go here with some other extraordinarily finicky eaters and we are always loved and impressed by this placeFor the record, I do not work here, so its not one of those fake reviews.

Whether it's to make or confirm a reservation, the man behind the phone is short, snippy, and utterly confused. I made a reservation for 7 people about 30 days in advance, again Dino/Harry seemed unsure on the phone as to why I was calling so far in advance, but this is supposed to be the best steakhouse in Hoboken right? Arrived Friday night to an ""upscale steakhouse"" that looked no different inside then a local Irish dive bar. Told the hostess our party was here and they gave the typical answer that everyone needs to be present in order to seat us. We waited, took up the entire entrance of the place, were basically sitting on the piano, until they allowed us to sit at our table 1 foot away while still waiting for 1 more person to show up. I asked for a table in the back and they said they could not accommodate a table of 7 at the moment back there, but then again, did someone actually call over a month in advance for a table? Onto the service, our waiter was good, did not find him overly friendly or overly accommodating. Felt that we had to pick his brain to ask him what he recommended. For appetizers we orders oysters, bacon, the short rib special, and the fried calamari. The table seemed to enjoy them but I recommend skipping out the fried calamari (definitely came from a frozen bag). Onto the entrees, I will speak for myself only, I ordered the fillet minion, which had 0 taste. No joke, no taste at all. Ordered it medium, it came out medium well........and it was tough to cut. Others at the table ordered other cuts of meat and they really enjoyed it. It seems those cuts (prime rib, porter house) had more flavor then the fillet. For sides I had the string beans and French fries, pretty standard, pretty tasty.  For dessert, it always perplexes me as to why a restaurant would not offer a chocolate option. The ""snowboken"" was the chocolcate dessert, which consisted of VANILLA icecream coconut, oreo crumbs, and chocolate drizzle. It was good, but I wanted something chocolate.  I had a bite of the toffee cake, it was warm and it was the closest thing I was going to get to an actual chocolate dessert. So in conclusion, I guess I cannot compare this place to NYC steakhouses.

We go to Dino & Harry's for celebration dinners because the a la carte menu is pricey. There was a $40 price fixed menu available which was a good deal. I would give it 5 stars except for their use of the physical space.  It is always crowded which makes the space a little tight and noisy.

There was also one guy playing piano and another a stand up bass...awesome!I ordered the Prime Rib and a side of potatoes au gratin. My girlfriend ordered the Jumbo Shrimp. I don't eat seafood but she said it was excellent. The Prime Rib was cooked perfect and tasted like heaven. The au gratin was also spectacular, not for those counting calories though, lots of cheese and heavy cream. We weren't in the wine mood so I can't really speak to their selection. The waitress was friendly and helpful, kind of the no BS type which I like. She said nah, you need to get this, and get it cooked like this...and she was spot on! We ordered the Snowboken for desert, it was chocolate fudge coated in a wine class with chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream and coconut on top. It was delicious as well. Not the best desert I've ever had but very good.I don't like to give 5 stars, but it was definitely worth the trip and I'd definitely return. The only problem was the annoying kid whose parents couldn't control, and she was like 10 and her voice carried over the whole place, really annoying when it trumps the piano and bass directly behind me. At the end of the meal the waitress just kinda plopped the check down and that was it, no ""thank you or good night"" to me that's just something that's standard, especially as someone who waited tables for 5 years.

First and foremost, the staff was genuinely engaging, friendly and attentive from the second that you walk into this warm old-style Hoboken atmosphere. We had a reservation (made about a week in advance) and had no issues. Although we arrived right on time, we opted to have a drink at the bar prior to being seated and there was no rush to sit down. Once seated, our meal was just excellent. I personally split the hearts of lettuce salad, porterhouse steak and the truffled shrimp risotto with my sister; all of which were amazing and I recommend to everyone who goes. No one at the table had anything but greats reviews for each and every item on the table.

I made a reservation weeks in advance, as my mother was coming to Hoboken from PA to celebrate her birthday. When 1 of our party of 5 was running late, the hostess told us there was no way the 4 of us could be seated until he arrived (which I informed her would be in a half hour). We were hoping to be seated and order appetizers and drinks until he arrived (generating the restaurant revenue). She told me when he finally arrived we would be seated. The restaurant was excessively crowded, and we shuffled around the piano/bar until our 5th finally arrived. When I returned to the hostess to inform her we were ready to be seated, I was met with attitude and told we'd have to wait another half hour for our table. We were finally seated an hour and a half after our original reservation. Our waiter treated us as if we were an inconvenience, and we had to flag down other servers for requests, like a missing baked potato (which was comped).

Maybe it's because when you first walk into a restaurant you really do feel like you're in a steak house, I for one always care about ambiance but that doesn't compensate for all the other negatives.Service was terrible, the waitress was nice but once again that doesn't compensate for fact that we waited so long for our orders. Took about 20 minutes after sitting down to even get a chance to order wine, in the mean time we had to split 2 pieces of bread between the seven of us. It was restauant week so you knew everyone was going to order appetizer, entree, and desert. So why was it so difficult to bring each of the courses out together? there were 3 appetizers to choose from and we ended up ordering at least one of each for the table but they all came at different times, personally i feel so awkward having to eat my food as a friend sits there without his arriving yet. then by the time his arrived we were already getting our entree. This isn't applebees so i don't understand why the service was so poor.D&H is supposed to be a steakhouse, so how come every single one of our steaks was cooked incorrectly. Either undercooked or overcooked, I'd understand if some of the other food wasn't done right since it can be expected from a steakhouse but how can you scew up the only staple a steakhouse is supposed to have?As far as i can tell the only part of meal that surprised everyone was how delicious the snowboken desert was.

We came to celebrate my boyfriend graduating from his MBA program. While they do not take reservations on Saturday nights, I called earlier in the week to see what time they suggest we get there for the best chance of getting sat. They recommended we come at 7PM, which we did. The restaurant was fairly empty and we were told it would only be 20 min for a table. My mother lives out of state and had also called earlier in the week to inquire about buying us a bottle of wine to be sent to the table as her way of saying ""Congrats"" She was told she would have to call the night of, no problem. My mom calls shortly after our arrival to purchase the bottle of Wine and was told ""We're too busy, sorry"". She was infuriated, as was I. You're too busy to take $125 dollars? That makes sense... After being told lie after lie from the Hostess about how ""our table was being set"", ""we're giving the server time to catch up"", etc etc....We were finally sat almost 2 hours later. Everyone that walked in the door after us, got sat before us, but yet they don't take reservations? I have no problem waiting, but I do have a problem with being lied too, and basically indirectly being told everyone else in there was more important that you are. They food isn't that great to be treated like garbage. I'll go into the city and make a reservation and get an even better steak, thanks. Meanwhile we still ended up spending over $300 dollars, totally not worth it. So turned off I don't think I'll go back.

The atmosphere feels more like your neighborhood grill than a steak house.  If you have the choice, I think you'll do much better having your steak in the city.  If you do want to travel here from Manhattan, take the #126 bus from the port authority.  This will drop you off in front of the restaurant in about ten minutes.",Dino & Harrys Steakhouse,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Wine, Bars"

We ordered off the restaurant week menu, and per the suggestion of our server, we ordered everything and split . He wasn't kidding when he said it was a lot of food. The calamari were so yummy. And the trio of empanadas, I could eat those forever. The spinach ones and chicken ones were moist and flavorful. My entree was the petite fillet steak (I had to!) -cooked to perfection. It tasted amazing, and when I asked for medium rare - that's exactly what I got. The inside was a nice shade of pink, but it was not bloody (gross haha). Sat on a bed of sauteed bite sized mushrooms.

We went on Wednesday night and it was fairly busy, but no more so than on a typical weekend night. After waiting several attempts to gain our waitress's attention, we finally succeeded in ordering a bottle of wine, which took no less than 20 minutes to receive. We had nearly finished the entire wine bottle by the time someone came to take our order. There were 3 different choices of appetizers for restaurant week and between the table we had ordered all 3. The soup came rather quickly. After a reasonable wait, the salads finally arrived. Everyone tried to be polite and wait for everyone to get their food but at some point it became intolerable. The soup and salad eaters had finished their appetizers, and had their plates cleared before the bacon orders were served. At this point I had waited so long for my food that I would have eaten it raw, it wasn't raw, in fact it was cooked just fine but I for steakhouse bacon, I would say its OK at best.After another extensive wait, the steaks were served. We rejoiced as a table even though we had to wait another 5 minutes for the last person to get their steak because there ""wasn't space on serving platter."" Personally, I had requested my steak to be served medium-rare, if I had ordered medium-well, I would still have considered a bit over cooked. I have never sent back food at a restaurant but I was really considering it this time. If I wasn't aching from the hunger and didn't think that it would be another half hour before I received a replacement, I think I would have in this case. I'm not picky with my food, especially steak, but this was far too dry to enjoy, even in my state of hunger. Just about everyone at the table faced a similar problem, of the 7 of us that went, 1 received their steak cooked as ordered.The desert did not take long to come out and was quite enjoyable. Everyone was happy with their desert order. This did not make up for how poor the rest of the dining experience was. The dinner in total took 2:45, cost $66/person, and the food was far below expectations.TL;DR The dinner took forever, the food was sub-par, the steaks were not cooked as ordered",Dino & Harrys Steakhouse,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Wine, Bars"

Get the side of potatoes with your steak...and the porkbelly and grilled apple appetizer.",Dino & Harrys Steakhouse,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Wine, Bars"

We made reservations for 8PM, but we had to wait 15 mins to be seated at a table that was clearly available, and ready, to be seated.  To pass the time, we sat at the bar waiting until the bartender felt like taking our order.  Once seated at the aforementioned table, our server promptly greeted us and took our orders.  Our bread, wine, and raw oysters came out promptly but I can't say the same for our steaks.  It took over 80 mins for our steaks to arrive from the time we placed our order.  The server said it took longer due to the party in the back.  However, the table next to us got their food ahead of us, yet they showed up later than we did!   My steak was decent, but I've had better without having to drop $42.  It was more on the mid-well side than mid-rare.  But at that point, I just wanted to finish and leave.  The brussel sprouts seemed like it had an identity crisis and they should've been ashamed of their mac & cheese.  Our server comped us for a round of drinks and a piece of chocolate cake.  Nice try, if she didn't seem indifferent half the night, or if it wasn't a different server that finally gave us the bill.  Perhaps we showed up on the wrong night.  It happens.  Or perhaps we don't fit the Hoboken/Dino and Harry's demographic.  It happens.What a way to celebrate our 5 year anniversary!  I will be perfectly happy going to Arthur's next time or even going to Manhattan where you pay more, but you get more.",Dino & Harrys Steakhouse,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Wine, Bars"

The ambiance is great here, they had live piano music even though it was a less-than-crowded Monday night. I do find it odd that the dinners are very expensive but don't come with a salad or any vegetables though. I don't eat steak much, so maybe that is normal for a steakhouse? Anyway, the food was good and the service excellent. I would reserve this place for a special occasion though, when you don't mind spending over a hundred bucks for a dinner for two... (2 steaks + 2 sides + 1 soup + 1 beer + 1 glass of wine ~= $140)",Dino & Harrys Steakhouse,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Steakhouses,, Wine, Bars"
