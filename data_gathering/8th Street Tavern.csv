Always good food, great selection of beers (draft and bottled) and terrific juke box. Bartenders are always friendly and attentive. There are some awesome personalities back there. The owners son is a great guy and is very knowledgeable about his drinks. I read that Jonathan S. was ripped off by the older guy with the mustache. I just can't believe that! That guy was behind that bar long before I ever walked in there. He's like a Hoboken legend and I just don't see him doing such a thing. Pool table and darts. It's a big place so you can always come in with a big crowd and have plenty of room to enjoy yourself.Looking forward to the next 10 years!",8th Street Tavern,3.0 star rating,$,"American, (New),, Sports, Bars"

I came in the other night and it was just me and a few locals as I waited for a show to start. It's lost the vibe in the excitement that used to have. Even during the week it seemed a bit dead. That said, the bartender was more than nice and the beer selection was adequate although nothing that really got you excited.

We finally came up to 8th st. tavern, welcoming, clean, and room to drink and have fun. They had darts, billards, TVs, and a bar that spans across the whole area (so plenty of seats). The bartender (in a heavy Irish accent) came over and asked us what we'll have to drink. We loved it there ever since.Over the years, they added craft beers, more seats, TVs, and a nice juke box. The bartenders are friendly and willing to strike up a conversation. I guess its fair to mention its cash only but the prices are also fair. There's an ATM in the front for the non-cash holding people. Keep in mind its divey so come here with a dively mindset and get set to have fun.I'm a Stevens alumni and I highly recommend fellow students to come by and enjoy a cold one with a laid back atmosphere where you can enjoy plenty of drinks, space, and bar games without a 20 person queue.",8th Street Tavern,3.0 star rating,$,"American, (New),, Sports, Bars"

8,JZJIG5KdsJHITf0i0loGXw,Joe E.,4.0 star rating,"We finally made our way (all be it one block) to try 8th Street for some of the much hyped food. Being a Sunday, it was pretty quiet, which was perfect for us. We got two great seats in time to watch the start of the Cavs game. The beer menu is pretty great, lot's of Kona which is our personal favorite beer and having Big Wave on tap was even better. Hopefully they continue to expand their draft beer selection. So, dinner...the menu is short and simple, but we really struggled to make our selections. Everything in writing looked delicious so after about 10 minutes and a few suggestions, we settled on; Spring Rolls, Fried Calamari and the Cubra Libre (special of the night). So, the only reason we give this 4 stars is just because it seemed to take a long time, but the kitchen looks like a 1 person operation and when the food started to come out, we were immediately impressed. The spring rolls were nice, I'm not the biggest fan overall, but I quickly ate mine and really enjoyed the sauce. It also looked and tasted fresh, which was a big bonus. I actually hat a broccoli crown on my fork at one point...and it was bright green! The calamari...that was pretty top notch, the sauce was good, but the calamari hit the spot! The breading was not to heavy and it tasted lightly fried. Then...the Cubra Libre. I personally cannot pass on a Cuban sandwich, as I person who cannot stand the taste of pickles, this is the only time I will eat them. The portion was huge, I wish I knew this before I had loaded up on Calamari. After my first bite, I actaully moved my plate away from my girlfriend because I knew she would want to eat it on her own.

Good/large beer selection, and the bartender has updated their wine list, too, although I haven't tried it out. He's clearly very passionate about making sure they have something for everyone, including some top notch cocktails. Very accommodating--when I asked if I could have some lime in my mixed drink, he brought over a fresh lime and squeezed it for me (at no extra charge!). The place seems to have a small, kind of bro-ish crowd even on weeknights so you don't feel like you're sitting in a depressing, empty dive. On weekends it gets busier, but can still be a nice respite from the crowds that flock to Hoboken on weekends and pack into every bar, making it impossible to sit or order a drink (lol).Also, when my bf left his fitbit there, they held onto it for us until we got a chance to come pick it up.

Initially, I didn't frequent it because it's far from my place, but for a bar that's been here for 32 years, I figured I should give it a try.

The place is clean and the food is delicious. My girlfriend got the chicken sandwich. I got the sriracha burger. And my friend had a homemade pizza. Everything was phenomenal. People sometimes have a hard time with the cash-only policy, but if you're charging less than most bars on Washington St, it's totally worthwhile.

There is plenty of bar seating, and they have a jukebox, plenty of TVs, and (my favorite part) Big Buck Hunter Safari.Other than the fact that this place is usually pretty dead, it takes a hit because they're cash only which, though they have an ATM available, can be a real inconvenience.

Pool table is kept well enough, but too close tothe women's bathroom. I kept blocking some women from getting out whenever i was shooting from there.Crowd was decent, mostly older people.

I really likeld the divey feel of this bar the past two times I stopped by for drinks with friends, unfortunately I was unaware of how discriminatory the management here is. DO NOT GO HERE!!!! Particularly if you are a single female or a single minority!!! I stopped here for a beer around 10:30 Thursday night and was talking to a colleague over text about an event business I help to run. There were several issues and I was texting for the duration of my drink. I asked for another Coors light and the bartender left without issue.THEN, 15 minutes later the bartender returned saying that the manager said I was cut off. I laughed, thinking the friendly looking blond bartender with a sloppy combover was flirting or trying to pull something on me, but to my dismay I quickly realized I was mistaken. As the only single female there I was extremely offended. There were several drunken older men scattered around the bar and I was fuming. I asked the coy bartender if I could speak to the manager and he said he had 'just left,' but I couldn't let it lie. I was absolutely appalled at the way I was treated. I have never experienced such sexism, a practice I had thought long dead in this century, so I asked again, specifically saying, ""please, I would very much like to talk to the manager.""The bartender then turned to me with a smug look, ""I am the manager."" ""Since when?"" I responded incredulous and annoyed... but he just stood with a condescending look on his face. ""Dear, I think I should ask you to leave."" I was FLOORED....absolutely FLOORED!!!!!I was waiting for people to jump out on candid camera to say it was a gag. I could not believe it. I was on beer two, talking to my colleague over the phone and they would not serve me....and for asking why they told me I needed to beat it. I kid you not. It was something out of twilight zone... Embarrassed - for no good reason! - I fled from this bar in shame. Wow... I am still reeling.
