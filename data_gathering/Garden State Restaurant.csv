0,C_2-UXtxNGpvY5FgHX3xPg,Antoinette S.,3.0 star rating,"The food was hot.  Could have used more flavor but it was ok.  Strangely, the delivery driver called me on my phone to see if I would come out and get the food from him, instead of bringing it to my door.  I guess I took too long to come out because he came and knocked after all.   The seafood fried rice was good.  I get a little annoyed with imitation crab meat, but it was pretty good.  I was a little annoyed that the spare ribs were clearly burned, but the un-burned portions were tasty.  The crab rangoon was GREAT, though. Overall, I think I would try them again.  I think I would try other items though.",Garden State Restaurant,1.5 star rating,$,"Seafood,, Chinese,, Noodles"
1,eqyGI8qDmw85SImBOFtiaw,Love P.,1.0 star rating,"Accidentally ordered from here before checking Yelp reviews so that's on me -This food was just terrible and a waste of $40. We got chicken fried rice, vegetable fried rice, sesame chicken and vegetable lo mein. So happy we got some vegetable dishes because they were the only redeeming quality. The sesame chicken had NO sesame seeds on it and was covered in flour causing me to question how much of it was actually chicken (if it's even chicken since it did not taste great). The chicken fried rice was ok except for the undercooked chicken gor is it just dark meat?). Either way, that's unacceptable in today's world. The food left a bad taste in my mouth. I would ABSOLUTELY avoid.",Garden State Restaurant,1.5 star rating,$,"Seafood,, Chinese,, Noodles"
2,-0TcSzuDQoY1btZWkisWrQ,Reggie L.,1.0 star rating,"How is this place still in business?? Ordered from seamless and the reviews weren't as bad as yelp so I took a chance, my goodness...Lobster felt like leftovers added with flour and refried. I was just eating chunks of somewhat cooked flour, like shrimp chips. Chow fun and mei fun were insanely salty, tongue was almost numb. Crab and corn soup was all msg and the imitation crab was so fake and hard, it was like biting into a cucumber. Amazing chicken is amazingly thick with flour. Crab Rangoon was overfried cheese dumplings with no crab. There were three unfresh shrimp that was so soft it felt like biting into shrimp cream in the entire box of shrimp and scallops...scallops were also miniature.Felt like I lost a few years of my life eating this, honestly feels like a health hazard. Save time money and life, avoid!",Garden State Restaurant,1.5 star rating,$,"Seafood,, Chinese,, Noodles"
3,NnAgG9TTK_VGu-i0OaCFXA,Rick L.,5.0 star rating,"Just ordered here again last night and I am eating the leftovers as we speak. Got the large mongolian beef, large honey chicken for my fiance, two cheesesteak eggrolls, fried scallops and crab ragoon as appetizers, and a free large wonton soup for spending over 25$ (we spent 31 total for the food) and the portions were huge, made 2 meals for each of us and we were stuffed. High quality, all of it. Everything was delicious and perfectly cooked and at our front door in about 40-45 minutes. I told them about the people lying on here and told them I'd post an updated review since we order from here quite often. For what you pay for, the quality, and the amount of food you get, it's definitely 4.5 stars or 5 for being a local chinese delivery joint (I'm not saying it's like 5 stars for a steakhouse or seafood place).",Garden State Restaurant,1.5 star rating,$,"Seafood,, Chinese,, Noodles"

5,NPDywGXIfJH9d7vFdUXH2w,Chelsea M.,1.0 star rating,Ordered food from here through delivery.com. Chicken was rubbery. For the General Tso's chicken I took one bite into the chicken and it was black. I also ordered chicken noodle soup. It looked like and tasted like all of the chicken in the soup was from leftover chicken scraps that could not be used. The dumplings were also terrible - the inside of the dumplings looked as though they mashed all of the left overs together and stuffed them in a noodle. I will never order from here again.... Ever.,Garden State Restaurant,1.5 star rating,$,"Seafood,, Chinese,, Noodles"
6,uwWsIjScGn_OxtzSI7qo0g,David O.,1.0 star rating,"Had a pretty awful experience getting delivery from here. The big negative was the delivery experience. In short, I left a $2 tip on 8$ of Chinese food. When the driver arrived he rolled his eyes said that he ""drove a long way"" and implied I should have left him a bigger tip. I am not open to giving bigger tips where they are deserved; but in this case not when the delivery time was just average, and certainly not when the driver is so rude! Food... not so great. Bland and nothing special. The delivery was also missing the usual Chinese food ""accoutrements"" such as chop sticks and fortune cookies.Doubtful I will order from here again!",Garden State Restaurant,1.5 star rating,$,"Seafood,, Chinese,, Noodles"

Whatever the substance was that should have been chicken was slimy, stringy and in no way resembled fowl. Cat? Pigeon? Horrifying! Bonelss beef ribs were also a mystery substance. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR risk your well being by eating anything from here.",Garden State Restaurant,1.5 star rating,$,"Seafood,, Chinese,, Noodles"
8,Dr6iNfbOYxruD5erqIiVlA,Mark M.,2.0 star rating,"It was cold tonight so I decided to pick up some soup and vegetables. When you walk in a child is playing an electric piano badly and much too loud, A tip cup sites next to the piano below a slowly dying fish. The place seems old and dirty. The price they charge you is more than the price on the menu. The large wonton soup had few wontons and some were just noodle without filling. The broccol with garlic sauce wss acceptable.",Garden State Restaurant,1.5 star rating,$,"Seafood,, Chinese,, Noodles"
9,WBhkQ3rPqwHIY5dMyMDHag,Nick C.,2.0 star rating,"The food was decent. It's your typical American Chinese takeout food, which is hard to screw up. I ordered online and the food took an hour to arrive. The driver was a dick, asking for an extra dollar tip next time because he drove a long ways to get to me. Hello! We're both located in Jersey City. You're probably better off picking up the food yourself or going elsewhere.",Garden State Restaurant,1.5 star rating,$,"Seafood,, Chinese,, Noodles"
10,FYhdUTcWtl-FRc-l2ezeng,Orion R.,1.0 star rating,"I wish I could give this negative stars.   The food was absolutely disgusting.   This is, by far, the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten.   I had ordered Spicy Shredded Beef.  It was not spicy, in fact, it was very sweet.  There was so much minced garlic in it, it had the texture of sand.   The flavor was completely off.   That was the second of two problems.  The first problem being a delivery person who decided to tell me that the four blocks he walked was so far that he deserved a bigger tip, even though I had already put a substantial tip on the order.For vomit-inducing ""cuisine"" served up by rude delivery people.....definitely get your food from here!",Garden State Restaurant,1.5 star rating,$,"Seafood,, Chinese,, Noodles"
11,Ss8Kf82s7XAbuHsNCLqk4g,Sean M.,1.0 star rating,Food was bland. Delivery driver asked for more $ for a tip. Gave $3 on a $12 order Apparently 25% isn't good enough.

13,DKL8THTMRcTcMfVuNmaF4g,Hank C.,2.0 star rating,"A small, tiled restaurant in the middle of Jersey City Heights, this place is much like most others... filled with the smell of chicken wings (a hot item, to be sure, ordered 6x as I waited for mine to be done), a mix of Chinese & Latin food here.The steamed tofu with black bean sauce was actually quite good, and the chicken lo mein wasn't bad, either. I'll eat the wings tomorrow, we'll see how they hold up to warming.Cheap, too, and relatively easy to get to. No parking other than street, though.",Garden State Restaurant,1.5 star rating,$,"Seafood,, Chinese,, Noodles"

15,-12KD4NWxQmXhqIJsXz8iQ,Analise V.,1.0 star rating,"I never write a review for any restaurant but this place was so badd that I had to share my experience. I ordered two orders of boneless spare ribs & pork fried rice and an order of cheese wontons. First of all they took a long time and the restaurant is a block away. secondly, they forgot about my 2nd order of boneless spare ribs. now lets talk about taste, the boneless spare had no flavor, it was disgusting. Also had bones in it. Then the cheese wonton also had NO FLAVOR, just NASTY! I have never had this bad of an experience with a Chinese restaurant.",Garden State Restaurant,1.5 star rating,$,"Seafood,, Chinese,, Noodles"
