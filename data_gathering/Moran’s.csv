Now onto the food - which was so delicious! I had the quiche and tell - what a cute name. They actually put puff pastry below and above the eggs - so it's basically sandwiched in puff pastry. My friend highly recommends the Moran Burger - with bacon, cheddar and truffle mayo you can't go wrong! They even serve tea in pot with a hat on it - so very cute!

This place definitely seems like more of a bar than restaurant, especially when we came in, but did the job nonetheless. We popped in for a quick bite prior to going to some fights in the city. We all ordered the fish and chips, and I personally went for the sweet potato wedges over the traditional fries. Along with our entrees we had a beer, can't recall the name however it was fresh and crisp. The fish was alright at best, lost its crispy factor somewhere between the deep fryer and our table unfortunately. Still far from what I would consider disappointing. The batter is somewhat heavy almost like a pancake batter, it was 3/5 at best. The sweet potato wedges on the other hand, out of this world. It really astounded me how well they were cooked and seasoned, along with the shear amount given in one order.Prices were reasonable and server was attentive throughout, I'd come back.",Moran’s,4.5 star rating,$$,"Pubs,, Gastropubs,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I went for the burger with no bacon (because I rarely find that bacon adds anything to a burger), and ordered it medium. It definitely came out well done, but wasn't dry. They have a great combo of burger toppings, including arugula, which made the flavors appealing. So appealing that I ate the entire giant burger...Their other sandwiches looked great too, and would definitely leave you with second helpings.

A table that came after us, got their food... about 10 minutes later, another table (that just walked in) gets food that looks just like our order. They accepted the food and didn't say that it wasn't theirs. So I asked the food runner what happened to our order because those people next to us just walked in. And server grabbed the plates back, walked over to the kitchen and brought back the same exact plates to us... no one apologized or anything... just pretended like it didn't happen. The server didn't even acknowledge that the food took so long. Since we saw that the people didn't even touch the food, we still ate it.

The staff is very attentive and the food is delicious. There is always a good crowd of people even on weeknights, which is always a good sign. The Portobello Blue veggie burger is amazing, as is the Irish poutine. We had family visiting from Ireland for two weeks and frequented this place a lot since it was right around the corner from their Air BnB. Will definitely be adding Moran's to the list of favorite spots from now on.",Moran’s,4.5 star rating,$$,"Pubs,, Gastropubs,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I eat in pubs often and now-a-days anything beyond decent wings is a big ask. Not the case at Morans. The food is incredible, traditional pub fare like you'd find across the pond. I devoured the Lamb Lollipops while others grinned their way through the burger, chicken sandwich and shepherd's pie (all of which looked and smelled delish!).

My boyfriend and I stopped by here for brunch last weekend when we were exploring Hoboken for the day. We both have traveled in Ireland and when we saw the promise of an Irish breakfast, we jumped on the chance. First off, the staff here were super friendly and made you feel relaxed and welcome -the bartender even greeted us with a joke. My boyfriend got the classic Irish breakfast and a Guinness and was happy to find it was just as delicious as in Ireland. I had the croque-Moran and a coffee with Bailey's. It was a perfect, warm, creamy dish on a cold morning (great pairing with the coffee)!

I love that the music isn't obnoxiously loud. You can actually have a decent conversation without yelling over the music, unlike other bars in the area. More then likely, you'll find our favorite bartender Kevin behind the bar, always warm and always welcoming. We were fans of this place before but now they have food AND an outdoor eating area! If dinner and a view of the park hasn't sold you yet, the sweet potato wedges will. Thick cut, sweet potato wedges baked and dusted with brown sugar and cinnamon. Regardless of what you order, a side of these wedges are a must. All in all, one of the classier bars in Hoboken and definitely a staple bar for the summer with the outdoor patio addition.",Moran’s,4.5 star rating,$$,"Pubs,, Gastropubs,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

The Full Irish breakfast and the Irish Whiskey, complete with the friendly Irish service, totally made my morning. It's a delight in every bite. It's everything every brunch should ever be.

65,JdOVQnXtIH-vQbXe0yqAXw,Diane S.,4.0 star rating,We've been going to Moran's for over 15 years and we were very excited to hear that they were opening a kitchen. The food was definitely a step above the average pub grub that you get here in town. We started with the Jerk Wings which had fairly authentic jerk flavor but perhaps needed a bit more crisping. Lenny's Classic Shepard's Pie was a very good rendition of standard pub fare and hit the spot on a cold evening. The Cod Almighty fish sandwich was excellent with extremely fresh fish and nice flavors.

Upon entering, there might be a slight musty smell, but don't worry, after a couple of drinks that smell will completely disappear! The drinks are decent, and priced in the same range with those in the area. If you are with a few pretty girls, they might be a little cheaper than average! :PThe bathrooms are pretty clean, and have two stalls (thank you). There are two sets of dart boards that provide lots of entertainment and friend making opportunities. One is in the main bar area and the other is located in a back bar room. They even have a jukebox! The steps leading in and out of this place are a little funky, so be careful! My first time here I went outside to look for my friend who had had a few too many and was drunk dialing a boy toy.
