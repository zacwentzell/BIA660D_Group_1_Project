When I first opened the box, I could immediately see that these were quality cookies and that they were baked with care. Lol some explanation huh? haha. But these cookies were fresh, smelled incredible, and just gooey inside (which let's be honest.. that IS what you want in a cookie). Team gooey and dense, not crispy and thin.

May have been better if made with dark chocolate ($4.50)Macadamia White Chocolate Chunk - this was the best one out of the bunch ($4.50)S'mores - the taste of this one was very generic.

Once we went inside, we were greeted. We were able to see the cookies being made when we walked in. The lady that helped us (sorry didn't get her name), was super helpful and polite. She told us about the different flavors that they offered.  The cookies are about $4.50 per cookie, but let me tell you the cookies are huge! I didn't mind the price being that they are unique and it's not something you would buy every day.  Now, as for the cookies...they were amazing. They were soft and chewy, and even though they were pre-wrapped, you can definitely taste that they were made fresh.  I will definitely go back the next time I need a cookie fix.",Bang Cookies,4.5 star rating,$,"Bakeries,, Desserts,, Food, Stands"

They text you when they are on their way and you can see exactly where they are located via the GPS on the text message link.All their ingredients are organic, no preservatives, and GMO free. Because there are no artificial flavors, they recommend you eat them within 5-7 days. You can freeze them too.Cookies are $4-$5 but they are HUGE and worth the money!

He even whipped out his phone to show me pictures of their mountains of boxes of cookie orders!! Max then asked for my name, shook my hand and introduced himself, genuinely thanked me for my support, and then he was on his merry way. I'm still in shock by his customer relationship building skills in the midst of a cold, windy night. He was almost like this mythical cookie character...it was so surreal. And then the cookies?!

AND PLEASE, don't sleep on the oatmeal raisin. Damn, soft, pillowy with nice notes of cinnamon. Delish. This location is mostly a factory, and not exactly beautiful, but I don't care for a second. It's the taste of the product that matters. Make sure you call in advance so they have time to bake your order. They mostly bake to order, so the cookies are super fresh. I recently ordered about a dozen and a half cookies for a party and cut them into quarters. My guests loved them, and I may have lied and told them I baked them ALL by myself.

Bang Cookies sticks to classic flavors, but with organic ingredients and zero preservatives, they are superior in taste. Dense, large and soft on the inside slightly crisp on the outside. We brought home half a dozen to try for about $24 and some change. My personal favorites are the white chocolate macadamia nut and sea salt chocolate chip. The peanut butter is my least favorite. The oatmeal cookie is great for those who don't have a huge sweet tooth. The price point is on par with Levain Bakery in Manhattan, about $4ish per cookie, less if you buy more at once. Expected when you use organic ingredients, but still a high PP.The shop is tucked away in an unassuming area on Summit. There isn't a sign on the storefront yet, so just look for the owners through the window preparing all the cookies, and walk on in!

I tried two: white chocolate macadamia nut and sea salt chocolate chunk.  The texture of the white chocolate macadamia nut was great and there was a good ration of chocolate to nut to cookie. It was delicious but I could only eat about a fourth because it was so sweet. The sea salt chocolate chunk tasted even better. Literally over 50% of the cookie was huge chocolate chunks. It was so good and I wanted to eat the whole cookie. Unfortunately the middle felt under baked. It was too soft and had a grittiness to it. The cookie is great until it feels like you have sand in your molars, then you get turned off.I might order them in the future for an event just because the size demands attention and is a conversation starter.",Bang Cookies,4.5 star rating,$,"Bakeries,, Desserts,, Food, Stands"

Omg, the sea salt chocolate chunk is sooo addicting! I've only tried the sea salt chocolate chunk and the triple chocolate so far. But i can honestly say both are really good! The cookies seem a bit expensive to others, but I think they're so worth it. The softness of the cookies and how big they are, definitely worth every penny. $4.50 isn't bad at all considering it's organic too!

I could eat half the cookie in one sitting if not more. And to have it delivered on a whim for $30 I would hope they last. The chocolate chip was over powered with the chips and could not really taste the cookie part. The cookie felt under-cooked where other parts were grainy. The oatmeal was too soft it seemed more like a cake than cookie and also felt under-cooked.

Seemed like a desperate attempt to rip off their customers at the Grove street market. Unfortunately, I probably will not be buying from here again, as good as the product is. How sad to lose a customer over price.",Bang Cookies,4.5 star rating,$,"Bakeries,, Desserts,, Food, Stands"

P.,5.0 star rating,"Bang cookies are simply outstanding!  We have tried three flavors (sea salt chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, and the macadamia nut) and found them all delicious.  High quality ingredients, fresh, and very large. Bang is a locally owned business that is definitely worth supporting.  Plus, they now offer delivery.",Bang Cookies,4.5 star rating,$,"Bakeries,, Desserts,, Food, Stands"

The sea salt chocolate chunk cookies are probably the best cookies in the world, the salty and sweet combo is simply marvelous.

I literally can't choose a favorite because they're all so good. These cookies are giant and they always tastes super fresh. You can really tell that they put a lot of care into making them and that the cookies are made out of high quality ingredients. Also, great customer service is always something I look out for, and the owners of Bang Cookies are just as fantastic as their cookies are!!!
