I came here for a dinner with my girlfriend and we decided to split two orders - the brisket and the pulled chicken. We also got a side of the Mexican Street Corn, which was just loaded with flavor.All of the food was good, real barbecue. I wasn't blown away by anything in particular, but it also wasn't anywhere near bad - it was good, solid BBQ food. The meats were tasty and portions were a pretty good size. Like I said earlier, the Mexican Street Corn was loaded with flavor and probably both of our favorite things - my girlfriend was raving about it. She also was a big fan of the pulled chicken in particular. I will say I really enjoyed their Asian-inspired BBQ sauce that they have on the table - that definitely added a lot of flavor.I've heard good things about their brunch, I'm sure we'll be back to try that as well at some point.

Aside from it being a beautiful August night, the volume of the music was a bit too loud to hear what anyone was saying. There is a serious rustic vibe pouring out of this place, one that is worth mentioning. From dim lights to picnic tables to the chill waitress, it had everything you'd imagine at a new restaurant. The food: It's a combination of BBQ and mexican. You may think--how do they make this work? But let me tell you, they do. Our table had a plethora of food (party of 6) that will make this review even better...We started with the nachos, they were the real deal. The guacamole was legit, too. Both were served with homemade chips. We also had the Kung Pow wings, everyone at the table raved about them. The sauce on them was the same sauce that's in the bottle on the table. YOU MUST TRY THAT! It was time for the main course-- The meat sampler is MORE THAN enough to share between two people. There is so much meat given in the 3 portions, do yourself a favor and share. Between all of the people at the table, we had just about every meat option. They were all cooked perfectly and incredibly tasty. (Feel free to add Kung Pow sauce for extra taste.) The Caesar Chavez was a very refreshing dish away from the meats. My son had the rib'wich, it was packed with flavor. He loved it. Now let's talk sides--The french fries were obviously fresh cut and my oh my, was it a large portion. The macaroni and cheese comes out in a mini skillet, it was so good. Hands down the best side dish at the table were the Brussel Sprouts with bacon and apple. They were cooked perfectly and filled with flavor. Do you really think we left without dessert? Not a chance!

Avocado Taco - good, not worth $5, more filling than the shrimp taco.Brussel sprout taco - a unique combination that I really liked (CORN, SPICY SLAW, CREMA, SALSA VERDE).Mac and cheese - $9 the consistency was watery and that was a big turn off.  Actual flavor was a little bland, but even so it was still better than some of the fake cheese tasting mac and cheese sides served at a lot of BBQ restaurants.  I would not reorder this dish.Shrimp Tostada - The tostadas are the way to go for non-meat eaters.  While they are $2 more expensive than a taco, I found them to be more filling.  If you don't eat meat you have to ask for the tostadas without the beans, which have pork in them.In terms of the meat, the first time we ate here my guy really liked his meat combo, even thought it was better than average.  On our second visit he said it was not as good as the first visit.  Usually I automatically give four stars to any BBQ restaurant that has anything editable on the menu for a non-meat eater, so my review may be a little harsh, but there is good intention behind it.  I feel like with a little tweaking in price point or serving size, Hamilton Pork could be as beloved by me as the Inn is.    As the menu currently stands I just don't see coming back, unless to try brunch, to booze, or maybe try one of the salads.",Hamilton Pork,4.0 star rating,$$,Barbeque

Avocado Taco - good, not worth $5, more filling than the shrimp taco.Brussel sprout taco - a unique combination that I really liked (CORN, SPICY SLAW, CREMA, SALSA VERDE).Mac and cheese - $9 the consistency was watery and that was a big turn off.  Actual flavor was a little bland, but even so it was still better than some of the fake cheese tasting mac and cheese sides served at a lot of BBQ restaurants.  I would not reorder this dish.Shrimp Tostada - The tostadas are the way to go for non-meat eaters.  While they are $2 more expensive than a taco, I found them to be more filling.  If you don't eat meat you have to ask for the tostadas without the beans, which have pork in them.In terms of the meat, the first time we ate here my guy really liked his meat combo, even thought it was better than average.  On our second visit he said it was not as good as the first visit.  Usually I automatically give four stars to any BBQ restaurant that has anything editable on the menu for a non-meat eater, so my review may be a little harsh, but there is good intention behind it.  I feel like with a little tweaking in price point or serving size, Hamilton Pork could be as beloved by me as the Inn is.    As the menu currently stands I just don't see coming back, unless to try brunch, to booze, or maybe try one of the salads.",Hamilton Pork,4.0 star rating,$$,Barbeque

I think the brisket was the winner though. Kept switching between the two sauces they have on the table because they were both yummy in different ways: one more traditional sweet bbq and then other had an Asian twang to it.

I realized that there were a couple good sounding items on the menu that vegetarians can try, so definitely want to come back to try some of their tacos and sides, as well as some of their brunch items. - Food: I only had their Churro Waffle Ice Cream Sandwich ($9) so can't speak much to the food, but the Churro Sandwich was pretty good, but honestly overpriced. Essentially it's two crispy Churro (in waffle form) layered between a scoop of Salted Caramel Ice Cream. Personally, I wish the churros were a bit more soft and chewy instead of being completely crispy. The ice cream was a good compliment as well. The best part of the sweet aroma of the cinnamon sugar, which made it more enticing. Generally good, but over hyped and overpriced -- don't go to Hamilton Pork just for this. - Service: While I just sat at the bar waiting for my order, every staff member was very polite and friendly, including the hostess and bartender. - Atmosphere: Hamilton Pork has a laid back feel to it, where you can come in with friends, family or a date and just relax over a meal.

The menu has a little something for everyone. Even for the health-conscious eater, they have a variety of salads (of which we ordered none). We tried one of almost everything else: pork belly, pulled pork, brisket, turkey breast, avocado tacos, mac-n-cheese, Mexican street corn, jalapeño-cheddar cornbread, and of course, the churro waffle ice cream sandwich. The avocado tacos have made their way to the top of my list of vegetarian tacos in Jersey City. The ooey gooey mac-n-cheese is also worth taking a trip across town from Van Vorst Park neighborhood for. The pork belly was by far my boyfriend's favorite; of course, the fat content contributed to that. We've been craving these dishes ever since, so we've already been back for more.The second time around we tried a few new items: brussels sprouts taco, lamb belly, and the pork ribs. The pork ribs were the showstopper of the evening: they were juicy and so tender they practically fell off the bone. The pork belly was not as evenly cooked or as well salted as the last time and the brussels could have been a cooked a little more for my liking.",Hamilton Pork,4.0 star rating,$$,Barbeque

50,mCVKhJzonBGiLkTHVQGdRw,Heather L.,3.0 star rating,"BBQ has arrived in Hamilton Park and it's a welcome addition. A group of 3 went for dinner on Friday night. We used Yelp reservations and they didn't seem to have our reservation which was a bit strange. We had to wait for a bit so we grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered a cocktail. I tried the grande cucumber - delicious, refreshing - and it made me wistful for the beach as it's a perfect summer drink. Place has a cool ambiance w/wooden booths, exposed brick, and cool BBQ decor.  A con is that the place is LOUD. You won't be able to hear your conversation.We tried the nachos w/brisket ($14) - hands down the best sort of nachos out there. Amazing smoked brisket a top amazing guac and chips. Why don't all nachos come w/brisket?  We got the meat sampler (brisket, ribs, and chicken) for $21 for our entree. For $21, you get to choose 3 of all of the meats they have including ribs, pork belly, etc. Brisket - again - was well cooked, seasoned, flavorful with the right amount of smoke. The chicken was good but the brisket, again, was the standout. It wasn't a huge portion of meat especially if you are sharing w/a group. We also got the sauteed kale ($8), mac n cheese ($9), and cornbread ($5).  Very good sides, though, none were standout and the kale was a bit greasy.  It's not cheap but when is BBQ ever cheap. It was a good meal and I'm very glad to have a BBQ spot in the neighborhood - definitely will be making a return visit in the future especially to try that churro ice cream sandwich!",Hamilton Pork,4.0 star rating,$$,Barbeque

We also had the Mac and cheese which was also good. For our entree, we opted for the meat sampler which consisted of three of your choice meats. We chose brisket, ribs and the jalapeño sausage. The sausage and ribs were my favorite, the brisket could have come with more meat. I also enjoyed their house sauces and hot sauce. They complimented the food perfectly.

We had an awesome waiter who gave us great suggestions on the menu. We started with the kung pao wings, which were awesome!! We then split the meat sampler where you can pick 3 meats (we did brisket, pulled pork, and pulled chicken) as well as a side of brussel sprouts. The brisket was by far the the tastiest contender. There was unfortunately a bit of confusion with our order. The wings had originally come out with our meat sampler even though we asked to have the wings first and then the entree.

We choose to sit outside because the weather was still nice. My bf was extremely hungry when he got there. He decided to order Most of the Meats plate all for himself. I believe he got the pulled pork, pulled chicken and pork ribs. He loved the pork ribs the best - he enjoyed the flavor and tenderness of the meat. It was a pretty big plate, I'm pretty sure you're supposed to share with other people with a few sides, but he scarfed it down in about 5 minutes. I ordered a sandwich- el pollo loco. It was pretty good, a little messy to eat because the contents kept falling out of the bun. I really enjoyed the jalapeno cornbread though. That was phenomenal. It captured the taste of jalapenos WITHOUT the heat. For dessert, we ended up getting the cinnamon waffle ice cream sandwich. Wow is that delicious! Total sugar overload, but well worth it.Only thing I'm not a fan of is the slow service. There weren't that many tables filled that night, but it was difficult to get a hold of our waiter.

The pulled pork let the natural subtle sweetness of the pork shine through. it was pretty good on its own, but every once in a while I would run it through on of the sauces they keep on the table for you. The pork belly was very good also, meaty and fatty in all the best ways. The pork ribs, while good, were my least favorite of the trio. I like a little bite and give in my ribs. These fell right off and apart. They were still good, so don't be afraid to order them!! All the sides were very good. A few beers/drinks and all that food makes for a good time.

The ribs were good and fall off the bone tender, nicely spiced with their rub. But when it came to the pulled pork & chicken, the meat was not well seasoned, and not particularly tender. I have been to several BBQ places in the past, and I can understand not seasoning the meat when you are offered a variety of BBQ sauces for your meal. That was not the case here. They had 2 BBQ sauces to chose from one ""Mediocre"" at best and another Asian type of Kung Pao sauce, not so good. The lack of sauces was the most disappointing part of the meal only second to trying to spice up the cornbread with jalapeno-cheddar. I'm more a traditionalist, I want plain cornbread with my BBQ.

We were immediately seats by the hostess, they have indoor as well the outdoor space, it's quite spacious inside and not cramped at all.We ordered pulled pork torta with a side of Cole slaw and chicken sandwich with side of Mexican corn. First off both sides were super delicious specially the Mexican streets corn. I liked how torta was served with a twist (open faced), meat was flavorful.

They loved it so much they brought my aunt and uncle out here! They brought their family. Basically this place is bomba and you need to eat. Their ambiance is also pretty sweet! (Think hipster vibe) And they have a near summer patio. Just one word of advice, don't order the enchiladas if your vegetarian and it isn't brunch. The first time we went my boyfriend ordered it and asked if there was meat. But I think the waiter was new and didn't realise the meatless option is only during brunch. It was a sneaky subtle thing.

Really good tender meat smoked flavor not too much fat just the right amount, coleslaw eh not impressed at all. Homemade for sure but lacking any sort of spices or even mayo. Took it to go and added a spicy sweet chili sauce in the home. Also never enough of their delicious bbq sauce that goes with the brisket?! Surely they realize this but somehow still just manage to include one lonely little solo condiment cup with every order. 3rd issue which I let slide but I still feel fair to mention is I asked for no bag twice, once on phone which and another time when I arriving but still received a giant paper bag. This is what I get for trying to reduce my waste!  no plastic utensils though which is the worst so I'm happy to overlook this small detail. (But seriously-if I ask for no bag and it's deader than a door nail....what gives)Pricing is as expected higher but very reasonable for bbq at $20 for brisket and coleslaw.

Casual BBQ joint as you are going to find, which lets be honest here; that's how you want it anyways. Food is reasonably priced, especially if you compare it to any BBQ place across the river. We went with the brisket, the el pollo loco, and sides of corn bread, burnt end beans, and sweet potato mash. At a glance, the mains seem like modest portions. Don't worry, it's filling. The brisket was really perfectly done. The chicken sandwich, tons of flavor and that nice vegetal bite you only get from a raw jalapeño. Side? Massive.

I've been here for both brunch and dinner, have gotten a variety of foods (brisket, pulled pork, ribs, tacos, and the nachos), and I would strongly, strongly suggest sticking with the nachos. That's not so much a knock on the other food--a little bit of a knock, but not a huge one--the nachos are just so good. There's smoky chicken, great toppings, and an ample size (my girlfriend and I split one plate for both of us as our entree).First, the plusses: the ambiance & friendly service. People are pretty laid back and, though they have a habit of making mistakes (double charging, bringing the wrong thing out, etc), they're quick to correct it and don't hold a grudge. They also have outdoor seating for good weather.Downside: the bbq isn't that great. Now, it's hard to find really good BBQ in NYC. Pittsburgh, my town for the past two years, has great BBQ, and it's been a tough transition.

The ambiance is spot on for a BBQ place, with the exposed brick walls and open dining hall-style layout. And the intoxicating smoky smell.Where this place fell short was in the quality of the food. Everything was mediocre at best and nothing blew me away. The pork belly was interesting in the fact that it was more like ham, and was actually unique and tasty. What ruined it was the fact that it was so damn salty. Mind you,  I love salt and tend to over-salt my food, but this stuff was too much, even for me. One piece will probably give you enough sodium for a whole day.Aside from that, the brisket was dry and hard to swallow, although it did have some tender & juicy parts. The beef rib was so boring,  it almost put me to sleep.

And after trying the food, I would say that it lives up to its appearance.My boyfriend and I came in on a Thursday at around 8. It doesn't look like it, but the place is actually pretty big on the inside. That, or maybe the empty tables just made it feel bigger.To start, we ordered the nachos. It comes with your choice of brisket, chicken, or shrimp - then topped with beans, jalapeños, crema, guacamole, and cheese. These were okay but I think that was just because we were pretty hungry. I've definitely had better nachos elsewhere. Plus, the brisket was kind of dry.For sides, we had the Mexican street corn and the jalapeño sausage. The corn was alright but I wish they put more cotija on there, as opposed to just 1/6 of the corn (just the top sliver). The jalapeño sausage was not on their official menu but it was written on their menu board. A more accurate name for it would be mushy, spicy hot dog. I believe there were 3 of them for $3.50, so I guess that should have been a red flag.For my entree, I was afraid to go with any more pork since the brisket from the nachos were pretty dry. So I went the triple deck sandwich (pulled BBQ chicken, smoked bacon, jalapeño, avocado, spicy mayo). This was very underwhelming. The bread they used was not good and everything was just falling apart. He got the pork ribs, which I thought was kind of dry and super salty. Drinks are expensive. Manhattan prices in New Jersey. NO.But I guess everything there is pretty expensive in general. We really wanted to like this place. It looks cool and it's literally down the block from my boyfriend's apartment.

And specifically BBQ with a tex-mex style. I like how big the menu is! Initially I was hesitant to come here because I didn't think they had very many options. Boy was I wrong! The menu is pretty extensive and has lots of delicious sounding things. A lot of traditional foods like corn bread and Mac and cheese but some with a twist!For better or worse, I came here for brunch on a Saturday morning. The brunch was quite good! But I was bummed that I couldn't try everything else at the same time! I ordered the Huevos Benedictos as I love eggs Benedict. This was great because it included avocado and had a really tasty sauce. The eggs were perfect and I liked how the potatoes were fully cooked but crispy on the outside! Mine also came with a choice of meat and I chose the brisket. It was good!They also have some great drink specials but didn't try any this time. One critique was that when I asked for hot water it was brought in a regular water glass and was too hot to hold. Do they not have any mugs? Possibly...I also tasted some of the waffle dish but it was a bit of a letdown. The bacon was great though.Overall the service was good although seemed a little overly concerned.

The bar looks like it was cut out of a huge steel box container (maybe it actually is?!). And our waiter was very helpful and very nice.Moving on to the important stuff, the menu is a little hard to understand at first. You don't get sides with your order, so you have to order them separately. Don't let the prices discourage you, the food is worth every cent. We ordered the half rack of ribs, Mexican street corn, coleslaw, brisket sandwich, and the sweet mashed potatoes (with pecans). Everything was cooked perfectly and it was to die for. Their BBQ sauce that is on the ribs was a mesquite flavor and complimented the meat well. And the corn was great and the slaw was sweet. Now, the brisket was cut thick and had an excellent taste to it. It could've come as a pile instead of a sandwich and I would've devoured it all. Lastly, the sweetashed potatoes were the bomb.

116,NS8UTKj5JX1kRBsry35xGA,Christine A.,4.0 star rating,"we came for restaurant week.  The host was really friendly and looked like he belonged in the restaurant because of the way he was dressed.  I was surprised at how big they made the space feel.  We got all 6 kinds of meats (brisket, pork ribs, pork belly, lamb belly, pulled chicken, pulled pork), mexican corn, and roasted cauliflower.  It was my first time having lamb belly - definitely didn't look the most appetizing, but it was probably my favorite meat.  You really taste the smokiness infused into all the meats and I appreciate that they don't put sauce on the meats - it's dry rubbed and there is BBQ sauce at the table for patrons to add to their desired preference.  Let's talk about the BBQ sauce - it was balanced - not overly vinegary, not overly sweet, and it had a hint of spiciness - I liked it!   I was disappointed that the food didn't come out piping hot, more like it came out at room temperature,  so minus points for that.   As for the sides - Mexican corn - generally I rave about Mexican corn and the corn at Hamilton pork was good, but not ahmazing. It seems they boil the corn (why not roast it?!), then they add the cotija and spices and sauce to it... I thought the flavors were good, but corn was overcooked.  The roasted cauliflower was delicious, but again not piping hot. Dessert was dulce de leche ice cream on top of a churro-ified waffle (which means rolled in cinnamon sugar) - I don't like cinnamon, so I appreciated that the kitchen was  able to give me the waffle without the cinnamon sugar on top.  Waffles were unbelievable crispy and (finally) hot!  I don't know how the ice cream didn't melt automatically, but it stayed in ice-cream form until the last delicious bite. Definitely one of the better BBQ joints in the area.",Hamilton Pork,4.0 star rating,$$,Barbeque

What brings me to this horrible review was our server, Jake. My boyfriend and I sat at our table, and watched him check in on every table except ours. At one point I asked him if I could have some more ice for my water, and the look he gave made me feel like I should have brought my own ice from home. He didn't even offer to remove our finished dishes until he noticed another worker making the effort to do so. He then pretended to be interested in if I enjoyed the food or not, and walked away before I could finish my sentence. I've been to lots of restaurants, ranging in price and atmosphere.

The meats and sides were okay...nothing to make the south worried about (though way better than that horrid food at South House on Newark...just gross, a horrible disappointment...but I digress). I'm giving 4 stars because the maple bourbon ice cream bread pudding was sick (in a good way)!  We were not expecting that level of deliciousness from a seemingly basic looking dessert (especially for takeout/delivery!). The two of us looked at each other midway through eating (because one bite was not enough) and agreed the dessert was the best part of the meal...by a long mile. It's probably not a good thing for your dessert to overshadow your BBQ...it should compliment it (and lord knows I have had some good puddin in my day), but this was some goodness. I would make the journey into the restaurant and see if I feel the same about the food within the restaurant setting (the brisket was my fave...the ribs were surprisingly not that tasty, and the mac n cheese was ""meh""...but not as ""meh"" as South House's'...I DIGRESS!). It's a tall order to ask for good BBQ in NJ, and this BBQ was acceptable (slightly better than Famous Dave's...yes, I said that).

However, my birthday was coming up and I knew after all the hard work I have put in these last 5 months, I HAD to do BBQ for my birthday dinner with friends.  I contacted Hamilton Pork via e-mail about setting up a dinner for a party of 13 and John was responsive immediately within the hour with a follow up email to my request.  The entire process was completely smooth and stress free to book a reservation for a party of that size that I was surprise considering the hard time I got every time I have called other places. Anyway, the dinner was INCREDIBLE but I am not surprised since I love it here. We had the wings and some chips/guac for starters but it was Taco Tuesday which meant they had margarita deals and a 3 for $12.00 taco special.  I ate the chicken bbq taco and the Al Pastor which is a solid favourite for me! The margarita was strong and I loved that you could do flavored margaritas for their special as well!Aside from this visit, I have had the Mac and cheese,pulled pork, kung pow wings, and baby back ribs and ALL are amazing.  Everyone at my table was so happy with the food and our server was seriously super attentive with such a demanding and big dinner party.  They even let my boyfriend bring in a cake from Milk Sugar Love free of charge and held it in the back for us until after dinner.   I can't praise the food and staff enough for such a wonderful night with friends.  I love you guys and thanks for making my birthday really awesome!

Nothing was particularly exceptional about the meal except the bacon which had a great smoky flavor. The Huevos benedictos was ok, and came with a brisket that was pretty nice but Ive had similar comparable entrees that were far better.

We were not disappointed!Food: I think I found my favorite new BBQ spot in NJ! Everything was SO moist and tender and falling off the bone. For restaurant week, you order a meat sampler of 3 proteins, 1 side, and 1 dessert. The proteins range from brisket, ribs, pulled pork or chicken, pork or lamb belly, and turkey. I can tell you ALL the proteins were delicious and I had no complaints. My favorite was probably the brisket though! The sides were even more delicious; I'd recommend the french fries, jalapeno-cheddar cornbread, sweet potato mash, or Mexican street corn. The side I didn't enjoy as much was the coleslaw; I like mine more wet and creamy. This was more dry and found it strange to have apples in it. Dessert was either a maple bourbon bread pudding with ice cream or a churro waffle ice cream sandwich; both so flavorful and not too sweet! Drinks: They offer a variety of juices, sodas, and cafe drinks. They also have a full functioning bar with bar stool seating. Price: For the meat sampler, side, and dessert, each person paid $28. What a steal! Service: Pleasant greeting at the door. Waiter was attentive and humorous, and water was always refilled in our glasses. He was able to answer all our questions. Food came out quick!Decor: Seats were comfortable and spacious, great for parties more than 5. There also also seating arrangements for 2. Bathrooms were clean. Modern decor and clean. Parking is either street or in their assigned lot.Final thoughts: Hamilton Pork offered great BBQ and amazing service in a comfortable, rustic environment!

Personally I'd prefer 1/2 lb but obviously you can't please everyone, and apparently ""the masses"" wanted 3/4.  So, ok, that's fine.Brisket was good, nice and tender.  Ribs were also good, meat fell off the bone.Cornbread was just average, and would benefit from some honey or butter along with it.  Burnt End Beans were not good at all.  Borderline bad.  Zero flavor, not even a hint of flavor.  I mean, these need a complete re-boot to be on the menu.Staff was very nice.In short, I think some items on the menu may benefit from revisiting the recipe, but most of all this restaurant just needs to make its presence known.

The restaurant is on a quiet side street and as a plus they have outdoor seating. We started off with a maple old fashioned drink. We ordered ribs and the brisket which were both very well done and tasty. One suggestion is they should consider changing the bottles for the bbq sauce. The bbq sauce on the table was difficult to pour and it became a bit frustrating because the nozzle of the bottle is too small. We ordered the sweet mashed potato with nuts and the mac and cheese....delicious. The sweet mash melts in your mouth and the sweetness was to perfection. I wasn't a big fan of the jalapeño corn bread mostly because I like a sweetness to my cornbread and this one was a bit bland. For dessert they have 1 item on the menu, warm waffle churro ice cream sandwich...Amazing and is a great finish to the meal.

We have seen all over Instagram and Facebook the famous churro ice cream sandwich and were dying to try. At the same time we love BBQ food, who doesn't?!? Dinner and dessert, yay!!! We arrive around 6PM  and was seated right away, we were super excited. The server didn't take long to come over to take our drink order. Once our drinks were delivered we were ready to order our food. I got the pulled pork, cole slaw and baked beans. After waiting about 20 mins, a table that came in after us received their food; they were a party of six. The server came by and said sorry guys the food should be out soon. Another 10 mins pass by and still no food.........after about 35 to 40 mins of waiting our food came. I was excited to taste the food, took a bit of the pork - it was good but lukewarm. Moved over to the bake beans.....cold. I told the server who apologized and he took the beans back. Few mins later he bought me the beans back, the top later was hot, bottom was cold. At this point I am become disappointed, so I asked him to take them back because I didn't want them anymore. Due to the wait for dinner we decided to place our dessert order right away - the churro ice cream sandwich. Shortly after was asked the server to please bring us boxes to wrap our food. He took the food and wrapped it in the back, not my preferred method but I dealt with it. When he bought our wrapped food back I asked him for a second bag and he told me that he put the food together.

From the moment you walk to the door the smell lingers in the air like an open market smokehouse, you can taste the love long before the food arrives tableside. The Chef is a true Pitmaster , a orchestrator of the best shindig ,hoot hollerin, picnic in town. All served on brown paper atop a metal tray, no dishes here ! This is Real Man and WoMan food, its a finger lickin  carousel of delicious meats !! You ask what do we love ? Let me count the ways...Brisket , pork belly, Turkey , baby back ribs, the list goes on and on. To start off this culinary delight I chose the aptly named Meat Sampler (3) different choices for under 25 Buckaroos, what a deal . I had the Brisket ( perfectly seasoned and smoked until it melts in your mouth) the Baby backs with 2 choices of sauce sooooooo good, and the grandpappy of favorites the Smoked Jalapeno Cheddar Sausage ( I have NEVER had better ). These are Serious eats , no joking around here, I have had Cuban Cigars with less smoke,  they were amazing!! Long before my lovely brides delicious sides of Mac and cheese, and an amazing tray of Mexican Street Corn were ever tasted, my platter was half done. Joy rang out in JC last night, I was in love, so much so that before we left I ordered another serving of those delicious tubular meats to take home for the next days supper.

I got the ribs, brisket and pork belly. Also got a side of mac and cheese with a Mexican coke. For desert I got the churro ice cream sandwich. Everything that I ordered was amazing!

For some reason, it took 1.5 hours to get very 2 basic brunch entrees (breakfast tacos and eggs benedict). The waiter apologized and was like, ""let me refresh your drinks""....but then he charged us for them!. Then the food finally came and it was soggy and luke warm.  My gf complained that the breakfast tacos were missing avocado, so he brought her a side....then tried to charge us $3 for it! It was VERY disappointing and there is nothing worse than having a very hellish experience at a restaurant and then the check comes and yo have to fork over $50 for it. I am so upset about it.Prior Review:Decent. Good drinks and ambiance. Strangely the ribs are better next door. The pulled pork was dry and needed much more sauce. I liked the mac n cheese, even if it was a bit velveeta-ish. Nachos were delish, but the baked beans alone need a lot of work.",Hamilton Pork,4.0 star rating,$$,Barbeque

When he came back with the food, he said the leftovers had accidentally been thrown away, so he took the liberty of packing up fresh ribs and sides for us (same kind that we'd ordered).

Yeah, we just got robbed.The menu was all over the place bbq, Mexican, kung pao sauce? The beauty of BBQ is the simplicity and Hamilton Pork seems to go against this principle by throwing in the kitchen sink. My wife had the Hot Chicken sandwich and it was uneatable. My brisket sandwich was very good however. Nice cuts of meat in Texas toast. But the mac and cheese was watery and another one of our party had the regular chicken sandwich which was very bland.

Although there were a few to pick from, I decided to try out Hamilton Pork. I ordered for pickup, so there's not much for me to say regarding the service, but they did give me a call to let me know when my order was ready so that's nice.The ambiance of the restaurant was nice and although it doesn't look like from the outside, it's a fairly large space. It wasn't too packed for a Sunday evening.I ordered the BBQ ribs (which I only tend to eat once a year) and they were fairly good. The meat was tender and relatively juicy. The sauce was a little sweeter than I anticipated, but I could roll with it. The ribs did not come with any sides, but it was a filling meal with about 4 ribs total.

I love the outdoor seating and the ambiance of the restaurant.. it's a very chill and relaxed atmosphere and they played great music. The service was fine, if a bit inattentive. I liked the vibe of the bar a lot, but I do wish the drinks were cheaper (or that the draft beer selection was better and more extensive). I did not like how our food was served.. I hate those tiny metal trays, and BBQ is far too messy to contain on them..As for the food.. this isn't Mighty Quinn's (which probably has my vote for the best BBQ around) but it is pretty good! Some things were better than others. In general, their style of BBQ is on the dry side. The sauce on your table is not a suggestion but a requirement.The spicy slaw was by far our favorite of the night.. 5 stars for this! It was extremely flavorful and had a subtle kick that built with each bite.The brisket was the biggest disappointment. The flavor and smokiness were there, but it was too dry and the amount you get for $14 is simply not worth it. I really hope they do something about this. I could probably say the same for a sandwich I got (the triple decker), which cost $11 on its own with no sides or fries and ends up being more bread than meat. It was a tasty sandwich regardless and I really did like the chipotle mayo on it.We also got the baked beans which were pretty good. I wish the flavor had been a little stronger (more pepper or spice maybe?), but the real issue is that they were pretty soupy and didn't have much meat in them.I'll probably come back, but I do wish they'd adjust their prices some.

It was around 950PM and we werent sure if it was going to be packed or not, so what I did was I reserved a table for us online. We left and wazed our way downtown to the restaurant. It is literally near Hamilton Park (we found parking there and walked). We saw Hamilton Inn and it was on the corner with big, black signs and we thought the restaurant was inside it, but no, from Hamilton Inn walk about 5 steps down and you'll see a pink pig light up outside and that's Hamilton Pork. We told the hostess we had a reservation and she sat us immediately. Our server was super friendly, they didnt have nametags so I couldnt get his name, but he was really sweet (gentle giant). For drinks, I just got the root beer and my sister stuck with water. For our orders, I got the pulled pork ($10) and my sister got the pork ribs ($12). We ordered a side of french fries ($6) for us to share. We got the food really quick, I'm guessing it's because they were closing soon and we totally felt bad about that, but on to the food. The servings will definitely fill you up! The pulled pork was awesome! The meat was so tender and it was so easy to pull the meat apart, they dont put the sauce on it for you, but what they have is the sauce on the side. They had two sauces, the kung pow and the original, I stuck with the original. The fries were crunchy and good! My sister was stuffed and had one piece of pork rib leftover. Now for the best part, dessert! The churro waffle ($9) was AMAZING! Normally, I dont eat churros because theyre so sweet, but this one was perfect. The waffle was toasty and tasty and glazed with cinnamon and sugar, in the center of it was ice cream, I'm not really sure what the flavor of the ice cream was but as a whole it tasted so good. Our overall dining experience was awesome. It's not my story, I just saw it LOL but a group of visitors asked if they could have match boxes as a souvenir and the bartender went inside to get some and gave it to them so I thought that was really nice of him.

207,56iaaFtgNiiisSYg8bJI1g,Stephen Z.,5.0 star rating,"I have been coming to Hamilton Pork since it opened and have yet to not leave with a smile and a full stomach. If you're in the mood for straight up BBQ, you cannot go wrong with the brisket, ribs, or pulled pork. The one thing I wind up getting most is the baby back ribs. A half rack of baby back ribs is perfect for one person, a full rack is great for sharing. Add a side of street corn and/or jalapeño-cheddar corn bread and you have a perfect meal for 2, maybe even 3!  For some different BBQ items why not start with brisket mac and cheese or nachos with brisket or pulled pork. I order one of these to start and always want more.  Finally, when you think about a BBQ spot you don't normally think about tacos. Get ready to have your mind blown with these tacos and the flavors of the meat. I would suggest the Philly, the Pork, the Gyro, and/or the Cubano, but you literally cannot go wrong with any taco you choose. The flavors of these tacos makes taco Tuesday a must!  In other words, I can't wait to go back!",Hamilton Pork,4.0 star rating,$$,Barbeque

Your welcomed into the restaurant by friendly hosted and a bug sign that says ""smoking"" with the most amazing scents coming from the actual smoker. We had to wait for a table because we didn't make a reservation and they sat us in about 15 minutes which was great. I went with my boyfriend and another couple so we got to try a few dishes. By far, the best part was what I ordered, THE RIBS! A must have. And the red sangria is so tasty. Not too sweet and lots of fruit. The cornbread was a little bit dry to my taste but the jalapeño flavor was great. Despite being so full we had to try the churro waffle Ice cream sandwich.

The pulled pork  and brisket was delicious as well with their BBQ sauce.  Finishing up was the churro ice cream sandwich for dessert. I know its a BBQ place, who cares about dessert.  I didn't until I tried it and I was blown away. Just that alone would bring me back, but they hooked me in with 2 more things. The backyard was really cool, picnic tables, string lights, great for groups. Now the kicker was the service, which you don't really expect to be a factor at a BBQ spot. I was amazed how friendly the servers and managers were, actually asking multiple times how everything is and if we needed anything else, with smiles. That may sound weird but in JC friendly service at some restaurants seems to be forgotten.  What a novel idea, be nice to your customers and they may return!  Well I'm definitely going back, and before you think it, no I do not work there or know anyone there.  I just give credit where it's due.",Hamilton Pork,4.0 star rating,$$,Barbeque

My order had 4 somewhat thick slices of lukewarm meat and 3 sandwich chip pickles that were completely unremarkable - they could've come straight from a jar for all i could tell. That's it. Not a carb to be found outside of the BBQ sauce on the table, which had a kind of weird taste to it. Not bad, and it went well with the brisket, but had an unfamiliar tang to it. Kinda sweet like a cherry. The lack of a piece of bread made me order the only bread-like thing on the menu, which was the corn pudding. It's basically a really soft baked corn muffin/cornbread with chunks of corn in it. The brisket, piece of cornbread and a drink came to $22.47. Upped that to 26 for a tip.Suffice it to say I probably won't be going back for a while.

220,JbAn6yi6SverD4tpY1Co4g,Christopher L.,3.0 star rating,"Where to begin.....was super excited to have a BBQ spot open up in the Hamilton Park area.  The menu looked promising and the smells and ambiance were on point.  Onto the food.1) In terms of the meat, I had everything on the menu (a la carte) except the turkey (cuz let's be honest, who really goes to have BBQ turkey?).  As a whole, nothing was mind blowing, but nothing was awful.  The brisket was nice and meaty in flavor and had a solid smoke taste.  The short rib was tasty and ribs were adequately flavored.  Where I was a bit disappointed was the moistness (giggle) or lack thereof.  The only meat with a hint of moistness (giggle) was the lamb belly, but that was probably due to the amount of fat (not a bad thing).  The pulled pork was probably the worst offender.  For slow cooked BBQ, I would expect a bit more moisture.2) Sides included mac n cheese, corn bread and baked beans.  Mac n cheese was good.  Again, not great but not bad.  The corn bread needs work though.  It tasted like it came from a box and that might be offensive to the boxed corn bread.  It was very dry and didn't have that mealy corn texture.  Also, they were in the shape of cupcakes.  Cute, but executed poorly.  The beans were a bit hard where I was expecting a nice mushy texture.  No sweetness to them either. I really want to like this place because this area needs a legitimate BBQ joint.  I am hopeful that they can work out the kinks given that it's just opened.  I will definitely give this place another shot over the next couple of months.",Hamilton Pork,4.0 star rating,$$,Barbeque

It's great to have a bbq place that I can just walk to in the neighborhood, and is owned by the Hamilton Inn people no less!I ordered the lamb belly and I LOVED IT! It was only my first time there, but I bet you it was the best selection on the menu. It was juicy, flavorful, tender, fatty....perhaps a bit too fatty but no complaints about that from this side. The hubs had the pulled pork sandwich and he liked it too.We also had the churro ice cream sandwich for dessert. YUM. Need I say more? It was awesome. My two favorite desserts in one, can't really ask for more than that. The cookie part of it was good, chewy and not too much (other ice cream-cookie sandwiches can sometimes have too much cookie dough), while the ice cream was fresh, tasty and not overly sugary. All around one of my best recent meals in Jersey City.Can't wait to try more since the menu has a lot of variety, like the breakfast items I haven't had yet and different kinds of sandwiches, aside from the regular bbq. The menu is a bit pricey for just bbq, I have to say.Lastly, whoever did the interior design for this restaurant, SPOT ON job there. This was previously the Vespa store so HP does have the advantage of already having that exposed brick and huge garage door that lets in lots of light.

Place was full but we got a table right away (had a reservation). Ambiance was relaxing but fun. Well lit with string lights and plenty of room. Music or patrons weren't too loud at any point.HP has free parking a block away on Jersey Ave. which is SO convenient especially in Jersey City. We started with some drinks, front porch lemonade  (with muddled strawberries) and an Armondo Palmero (based on an Arnold Palmer with tequila) . Drink menu didn't have a ton of variety and they were very sweet. In the $9-$12 range which is pretty standard for the area I'd say.We ordered the beef brisket nachos (highly recommend), half rack of baby back ribs, pulled chicken, and two orders of beef brisket tacos on tortillas with over/medium eggs. The nachos were phenomenal and perfect size for 4 people. The Tacos were also unbelievable, topped with guacamole and mine had the eggs. The eggs were well worth it in my opinion but paid $2 for each egg on three tacos.The sides were also delicious however be aware that they kind of stick you here. $5 or $6 for Mexican street corn or burnt end beans adds up fast. The first order of Mexican street corn had cooled down so they replaced with a fresh hot one no questions asked. They also took a margarita off our bill that we didn't enjoy, with no fuss or attitude.Overall the food was very good. I hate to complain about price because I know full well what I'm getting into, however you're already paying anywhere from $10-$18 for your entree then paying $5-$7 for your sides.I will definitely attend HP again as it was overall an above average experience.

My entire mouth area, upper lip, and chin is literally still burning from this sandwich. This sandwich is 100% inedible. If this sauce/spicy seasoning was the actual intent and I can't imagine why, there should be some kind of warning. Then to top it all off I paid $5.00 for cheese fries and they send me a half empty container of soggy fries with a slice of cheese on top which seems that was microwaved! UNACCEPTABLE.

This place should just be a food truck because the only good thing is the food.  Bar, cocktails, service, host staff has a loooooong way to go to call themselves a restaurant.",Hamilton Pork,4.0 star rating,$$,Barbeque

The food is tasty from what me and my girlfriend had, but otherwise save your money. I believe this place caters to the local yuppies who spend high amounts of money on low portions of food. Let me cut to the chase;- Drinks are very pricey and you get a very small glass filled with ice, little to no alcohol and chaser. - Food portions were small and pricey.- Food selections were half on the okay side and half on the ""what this is all?"" side. - We left disappointed and hungry and won't be returning unless things change. Its not a bbq spot that would make you say ""yea I'm about to get my bbq on mmm mmm mmm"". Its more like neat and conservative bbq.But dont take my word for it, try it yourself. Oh and last thing, I didnt know this place had a happy hour until the check came with a happy hour menu in it.

Front of house mentioned they had the same brunch menu available next door at Hamilton Pork (I believe they share the same kitchen). We went next door and there were a few open tables, so we were seated immediately. Interior, decor and ambiance were very nice at this new restaurant, and there was a lot more space than Hamilton Inn. I was happy to see they had $5 brunch cocktails until 4pm, which included a classic Bloody Mary, micheladas (wish I saw this on more local menus!), MuleMomsa and Greyhounds. Everyone was really happy with their cocktails, and I was pleasantly surprised by the spiciness, saltiness and size of my Bloody. Brunch meal prices seemed to range from $10-$15. I was happy with my Huevos Benedicto, which was served with a choice of brisket, pulled pork or shrimp, avocado spread on an English muffin, perfectly cooked poached eggs, Hollandaise sauce and a generous side of home fries. Service was quick, friendly and attentive. I'd definitely recommend for brunch. I'll come back soon to try their regular BBQ menu.",Hamilton Pork,4.0 star rating,$$,Barbeque

Once again I was wrong.  The food I had today was the brisket.  It had no smoke ring or smoke flavor. It actually needed BBQ sauce to have some flavor.   I also had the under seasoned and pureed to baby food consistency sweet potatoes.  This was a very horrible food experience.

259,Q-VRGsa8JRN6xtrIcef1hA,R D.,3.0 star rating,"I came here on a Tuesday night to check out their taco special and their popular churro waffle ice cream dessert that's hyped up online. I thought the tacos were great, very flavorful with a lot of choices, I just wish they were a bit bigger. As for the desert, it's a really cool concept, but I'm just not a fan of sweet and salty. I prefer the churro waffles with maybe vanilla ice cream instead of the salted caramel. It just tasted off to me, and the presentation was just plain and mediocre for $9. I would've been fine to eat the delicious waffles alone. Their beer and drink specials were a great deal though. However, I must say the service was horrible with a subtle smile. I don't know if they were understaffed or just didn't care, but the place was maybe 25% full with just a couple people at the bar. No one was at the host stand, so we sat ourselves.  It took a while for someone to come over, for that person to follow up with us, even a longer while to get our food, and then another while just to get the check. Someone sat a few minutes before we left, and he got his food superfast, it was odd.  I will probably go back to check out the happy hour and for taco Tuesday again. But I'm skeptical about the barbecue. The place is filled with the delicious smell of barbecue, but I heard some others say it was just OK, nothing special.

265,z7dilHN7EWd3l2gTvdbdCA,Carlos D.,1.0 star rating,So my friends live in the Newport area down the street from Hamilton Inn .. we decided to have breakfast here since the inn was about an hour wait.. we sat down ordered our drinks. Then we waited about an hour. Our food was not ready... I was getting so inpatient. At least offer us another round on the house to keep us happy .. never in my life have I waited so long for food. Mind you it wasn't even that packed. Eventually our food came out my sandwich was a bit on the smaller size for what I paid for.. plus an extra 3 dollars for fries. Mind you we came for breakfast it was almost 1 pm.  Two of my friends ordered a tostada worst decision ever super small .. super easy to make and it took about an hour and my other friend had to wait another 5 mins for hers to come out... mind you she waited an hour with the rest of us... also for some reason the tostada was supposed to have chicken ... it tasted like pork .. or more like pernil... also in our group they messed up the eggs which they gladly took off the check. The waiter was so unprofessional when I told him about the tostada he went to the supposedly owner which I saw all busy with a coat in the kitchen doing god knows what ... and the waiter came back and said it was chicken.. and I told him well this is isnt chicken and didn't even say anything back ... point blank worst place to have brunch plus their BBQ is awful ... nothing like an impressionist. The only good thing was the sauce ... that's about it .. i would keep waking and go to the Cheesecake Factory where 13 dollars can get you more then a small ass tostada or sandwich,Hamilton Pork,4.0 star rating,$$,Barbeque

In fact the owner and chef both came out to check on us and see what we thought.  But down to serious business, this is legit BBQ, with serious smoke time and flavor.  As soon as you walk in you can smell the delicious smoke in the air, and the food doesn't disappoint.  I got brisket and pork ribs and both had great flavor, and the brisket was perfectly tender and had awesome fattiness as beef brisket should. Generous portions, not over-sauced, and they give you a bottle of high quality BBQ sauce on the side. We also got some spicy slaw and corn bread which were both good.  They cut and butter the corn bread for you then toast it for service.  Also, there's a full bar with friendly service and well poured Jamesons.  Great addition to the neighborhood.",Hamilton Pork,4.0 star rating,$$,Barbeque

On the minus side...I think their pure BBQ is the weakest thing on the menu. My wife is from the midwest and we've spent lot's of time in Kansas City style BBQ restaurants. Hamilton Pork's BBQ is average at best compared to what those restaurants are pumping out everyday as a significantly lower price point. BUT....They really make up for that on the creativity side. Their sandwiches are all excellent and probably a better use of their BBQ meats to dress them up with other creative components. We've enjoyed all of the sandwich's we've tried so far. The side's are hit or miss. Burnt end baked beans are weak compared to what I've had elsewhere. Mac n cheese is good. Potato salad is fine. We've had cole slaw multiple times and the recipe seems to change...we've had it with pineapple in it once...and apples another time.As a BBQ restaurant I'd rate them a 3, but the sandwich's have been consistently good and the sides are fine once you find your favorites, so overall they get a 4 from me.",Hamilton Pork,4.0 star rating,$$,Barbeque

I'm not a BBQ expert but I thought the brisket and ribs were excellent. Both were tender and tasty and rib meat fell off the bone! My only suggestion would be to serve the corn in the cob w wooden sticks- easier to eat! Service is quick and friendly- Hamilton Pork is great for a low key, great value, meal out. Fun drink menu too!",Hamilton Pork,4.0 star rating,$$,Barbeque

They've just opened and if it's anything like Hamilton Inn, they will grow and learn what works for the hood.Hamilton Pork is excellent! Another great spot in the Hamilton Park area. I'm a stickler for Barbecue and it's rare to find such good barbecue in the NYC area. INCREDIBLE pulled pork and great sides. Reasonable prices. Great atmosphere. Extremely likable and friendly staff. What more could you want? Thrilled this has opened in the neighborhood. I'm sure it will quickly become a staple as they continue grow and figure everything out.",Hamilton Pork,4.0 star rating,$$,Barbeque

296,1XRqbwuitKtK_1Vde2Ea1w,Eric H.,5.0 star rating,"I was at Hamilton Pork on Friday.  Friends and i sharrd the brisket, ribs, Mac n cheese, potato salad, corn bread, and baked beans.  The brisket and ribs were excellent - great smoked flavor.  The ribs were tender and meaty, sliding right off the bone.  The brisket had just the right amount of fat to make it moist.  The mac n cheese was creamy and cheesy and was the side item completely devoured by the table.The service was excellent.  The owner/gm visited our table and offered us dessert.  Even though the table thought we could not eat another bite - there was not a morsel of ice cream  or churro left on the plate.",Hamilton Pork,4.0 star rating,$$,Barbeque

I was at Pork last night for the first time and had terrific food in a great setting with great service. Ribs/chicken/corn/slaw were wonderful. (Corn a little overdone but still very flavorful. This is a simple fix. Make to order possible?) We live across the street and have been to Hamilton Inn a hundred times, so there is no doubt that Pork will meet the same quality standards. A wonderful addition to the neighborhood and JC.",Hamilton Pork,4.0 star rating,$$,Barbeque
299,6rgQgUmhssWdq6QN-fGKSg,K V.,2.0 star rating,"We were really looking forward to trying this barbecue restaurant.  We ordered the ribs and the brisket, along with the sweet potato and potato salad as sides.  The ribs were juicy and soft and came off the bone very easily, but there was no char whatsoever.   The portion sizes are pretty small for $12 and they don't come with a side.  The potato salad was terrible.  It resembled cold, mashed potato in the shape of a ice cream scoop.  Our meal came to $41 including two sodas, so with tip it was $50 for a very underwhelming and unsatisfying BBQ.",Hamilton Pork,4.0 star rating,$$,Barbeque
