0,hx4GJL0ADXXTLchWz3iN1g,Conscience C.,4.0 star rating,Thanks to Wallse I have rediscovered Austrian wine. Had a wonderful glass of house Blaufränkisch with my meal.  It's really nice when a restaurant stays authentic and has regional wines on its wine list.This is a great restaurant. Service and food are top notch. I had the oyster appetizer and Venison goulash as a main course. The sole criticism here is that Wallse focused on doing the Goulash as if it were high end focusing on presentation. But in my view Goulash is at its best as a comfort food where you sop it up with bread and in fact I first had Goulash in a bar in Prague.  In fact when I last had the Goulash at Wallse it was served in a bowl and the portion larger. They should go back to this practice. Otherwise Wallse is highly recommended.,Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"
1,ghzPmvAEm21QwCTs5R6Mtw,Ryna D.,4.0 star rating,"Another Restaurant Week dinner from last summer. I came here with a really good friend and it was an excellent meal! I would have given them 5 stars if not for the fact that the service was chilly and even borderline snobbish. Yes, Wallse is a fairly classy restaurant and we were a bit underdressed but it's the west village for crying out loud!In any case, we at least enjoyed the meal and had a great time catching up. To start with I had the spätzle with rabbit and corn which was a great dish that highlighted the flavors of the season. For my entree I ordered the fish which was also very good. The desserts were a standout with the sachertorte and the salzburger nockerl both leaving us delighted. The latter is a soufflé of sorts and with the lingonberries it was amazing! As I said, if the service was warmer I would give them 5 stars..",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"
2,h_xZH4cgz6jhC3ZklzHpng,Jingqiao H.,3.0 star rating,"Really a 3.8/5.0 and so far the most quality-consistent restaurant I've tried during RW this summer (the 3rd one at this point).I was very excited to try Austrian food (first time ever), especially at a Michelin star restaurant. Made a reservation at 9:00 pm. The interior was classical modern and the ambience was classy with dim lightIng. I tried Green Asparagus Salad, Wiener Schnitzel, and Sachertorte (chocolate cake). The Green Asparagus Salad was okay, crispy asparagus and fresh salad, but nothing special. Just a couple asparagus and a few chopped beet roots, with countable number of salad leaves. I saw that their white asparagus salad was very popular and was hoping they could have it on the RW menu, but no (should have known this) :(The Wiener Schnitzel, or fried cutlet, was not greasy or dry as I was afraid so from the photo on Yelp. It was thinly breaded and fried perfectly so that the tenderness and juiciness of the meat were well achieved. The outside was not meant to be crispy crunchy, but I didn't know this so I was a bit disappointed at first. From the second bite on, I totally forgot about it and enjoyed every bite. The cucumber salad was really delicious. Wish there were more (really just a mouthful portion), not just the cucumber salad, but more side dishes in the plate in general. It looks really plain as there was just a big piece of meat.Sachertorte was the surprise. I didn't expected it to be fancy but it turned out to be surprisingly good. Not overly sweet or thick, rich chocolate flavor, but might be somewhat dry for some people.For drink, I also had Irish American whisky on rock. I usually don't like whisky because I don't appreciate the unique taste coming out of it, but this one was enjoyable and strong too. Only drawback was that, the portion was really, really small for the price ($9 I think?? Don't remember). I've never ordered whisky, so not sure if it is normal, it filled only the bottom 1"" with ice.Service was okay, friendly and nice, but a bit slow and didn't check on us after ordering. For $42 (excluding the drink) I was expecting more, particularly from a Michelin rated restaurant. But I felt like I just dined at a random restaurant in a nice neighborhood in NYC.",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"
3,kT70ZylFdVTQEXT4Kuhc7A,Elaine Z.,4.0 star rating,"We came here for restaurant week inspired by our friends (who we unsuccessfully tried to coordinate a Wallse double date with, twice!) and left pleasantly surprised, as we had little to no experience in Austrian cuisine. I would definitely say to pick the more Austrian leaning dishes on the menu, as I tried the standard fare and was envious of my boyfriend's choices of spaetzel and schnitzel! The quark spaetzel was creamy and delicious and the schnitzel was perfectly cooked. I had the branzino and the smoked salmon, which may have been too much fish as I was not particularly infatuated with my pickings. For dessert, we had the chocolate cake and the apple strudel, which were great as well. I definitely enjoyed this introduction to Austrian fare. I think the restaurant week price may have influenced my opinion of Wallse, but I found the selection very tasty if you know what to order.",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"
4,zEAZ_Z7jXIn3l56OVBLhMw,Lisa Z.,4.0 star rating,"1. Getting last minute reservations at Wallse is relatively easy, even for a Friday evening (I made mine day of on Opentable). 2. Dining here is intimate and pleasant before 7:30pm, crowded and packed by 8:00pm. 3. There is a potato master amidst us. All the potatoes were on point and scrumpdidlyumptious.What we had:Warm cooked octopus: the octopus alone grants Wallse 4 stars! I'm usually hesitant to order octopus at restaurants because they've always come out overcooked, thus overly chewy. It was definitely not the case tonight; the cephalopod was soft and flavorful, the best I've ever had. The dish was creamy without being heavy, savory yet still preserving an overall lightness. If you dislike fennel, fear not! The fennel was mild and barely noticeable. Roasted duck breast: cooked medium rare, semi-bland, and took a bit of effort to eat. The poached citrus was sour and didn't do much for the dish. The sautéed endive on the other hand －my god!－ was divine. It was super sweet and flavorful. Every disintegrating bite made me almost forgive the other faults of this dish. Whole brook trout: a bit salty. I usually hate fish skin but I enjoyed it here. An alternating bite between trout and duck provided the perfect salinity. In conclusion, the octopus appetizer has my 4-stars tastebud heart. Though this Michelin-rated restaurant doesn't make your wallet cry too much, the portions are quite small in size. I'd definitely come back, but solely for their appetizers.",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"

We also got the octopus, which was the most tender octopus I have ever had, incredible.Entree: Boyfriend got the Wiener Schnitzel, which he enjoyed - it's a very simple dish that stays true to the classic, and while we liked the potato salad that came with it, I felt there was more cucumber than potato which was disappointing. I got the Poached Lobster with Ricotta Gnudi, which was AMAZING - good portion of lobster, a STUNNING dish (seriously, it was gorgeous).Dessert: Bf and I split the Salzburger Nockerl - such a unique dessert, so delicious and pretty. The souffle topping was perfection and the huckleberry spread underneath was perfectly tart and sweet.Side note: as we were leaving, Chef Kurt Gutenbrunner came out of the kitchen as we were walking by and I lost it and acted like a total fan girl and embarrassed myself haha.

This was my first experience in a Michelin Star restaurant and I was not disappointed at all. The ambiance was beautiful and intimate, and it wasn't loud at all. The waitstaff was professional and attentive without being overbearing. Overall, we left feeling satisfied but not overly full...I will say our dinner reservations were at 5:30pm and by 8:30pm I was hungry for a snack lol.Drinks: I got the Tomate, which was deliciously spicy, highly recommend! Bf got an old fashion, which was goodStarters: MUST get the Rabbit Quark Spätzle!! It was recommended by other reviewers and I am so glad we got it - creamy, flavorful, delicious. We also got the octopus, which was the most tender octopus I have ever had, incredible.Entree: Boyfriend got the Wiener Schnitzel, which he enjoyed - it's a very simple dish that stays true to the classic, and while we liked the potato salad that came with it, I felt there was more cucumber than potato which was disappointing. I got the Poached Lobster with Ricotta Gnudi, which was AMAZING - good portion of lobster, a STUNNING dish (seriously, it was gorgeous).Dessert: Bf and I split the Salzburger Nockerl - such a unique dessert, so delicious and pretty. The souffle topping was perfection and the huckleberry spread underneath was perfectly tart and sweet.Side note: as we were leaving, Chef Kurt Gutenbrunner came out of the kitchen as we were walking by and I lost it and acted like a total fan girl and embarrassed myself haha.

Which was fine. I felt the food was wonderfully prepared. Great presentation, highlighted the chefs culinary skills, with flavors to die for. You tasted every ingredient and the flavors blended very well. Each bite was exciting and woke up your tastebuds. The kind of food where you want that extra piece of bread to make sure you don't leave any sauce on your plate. Highly recommend the white asparagus appetizer, and the Quark Spatzle. For entrees we had the Scallop entree  and the Lobster entree. How they made  gnudi that floated on air I don't know.  The manager was very helpful in suggesting a bottle of wine that worked with our selections. For the dessert, we shared the Salzburger Nockerl which while I'm sure it was prepared well, wasn't my thing. It looks like 3 naked female breasts sitting on a berry sauce and the taste and texture didn't work for me. I read the prior reviews re concerns about service. In my opinion it seemed uneven depending upon the staff/server, and why my rating is 3 star. The food deserves 5. The environment feels like they are shooting for a much more casual feel these days. At the end I mentioned to my friend that it was Michelin star and he seemed shocked. You don't really get that feel or the pride that usually comes from staff who are trying to maintain it.  If you compare this to a typical Danny Meyer experience there is no comparison on service, even in restaurants that have embraced the casual trend.",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"
41,DbS8sBQnabsKLEbWvmMxhQ,Kimmy T.,3.0 star rating,"Dear Wallse,When I sent you an email after experiencing lackluster food and service last week, I was not expecting silence, followed by you adding me to your email list with an invitation to join the KGNY community. I walk by your restaurant almost everyday, and have always been curious as to why it is Michelin starred (1 *), but almost always empty - I have never seen the restaurant at more than half capacity, even on weekends at peak dining hour. You have a lovely dining room, and it is even nicer on the inside than it appears from the outside. You also set up a lovely outdoor dining area in the summers. So why are people not receptive to what you are offering? I decided to stop by on a weekday night with my husband to check out this neighborhood spot. In my experience, the main issue was service and the food. My server took care of our table of two, as well as a table of four that was seated right next to us. Otherwise, the front dining room was empty for the better part of our meal. The difference in service between the two tables was startlingly obvious. Our server took our orders, then - that was pretty much it. We ordered appetizers, entrees, drinks, and dessert and coffee - a full dinner. He did not ask once how anything was. But his interactions with the table next to us could not be more different - he was affable, courteous, making inquiries after each drink and dish were served as to how the diners were enjoying their meals. Pretty startling difference. I might have noticed this gap in service more since I was waiting for someone to ask about my overly seasoned entree. I was with my husband, who would rather just eat whatever is served rather than ever complain, so I was looking for an opportunity to gracefully express my concern about the very salty scallops your kitchen served up. But not a chance - the server, the host/hostess - no one cared to ask, 'How was your meal?' Wallse, obviously KGNY community members are not enough to fill up your dining room. I would suggest that you do better in providing better service to all diners that cross your door and give your restaurant a chance.",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"

It is certainly a popular place since the only spot left when I reserved was the last day's dinner.(last day of restaurant week) It is simply amazing and is absolutely a surprise. I went here with my boyfriend, who has extremely high standards on food, but he agreed this Michelin one-star deserves five stars We ordered the braised rabbit for appetizer. It is my first time eating rabbit, and it is not bad at all. The rabbit is more tasty than chicken or pork. This dish mixes braised rabbit with pasta, cooked using a creamy sauce. The best part about this dish is not rabbit, nor is the pasta. The best part is the asparagus and the corns embedded under the pasta which is an ingenious way to dampen the creamy taste. We ordered the branzino and the pork schnitzel for entree and they were delicious as well. The Branzino is slightly fried which makes the fish skin super crispy. The pork schnitzel is similar to pork katsu from Japanese restaurants and tender inside. For the desserts, we had the vanilla strudel and the nockerl, which were not as surprising as the previous two courses, but still were exquisite.

We started our meal with the rabbit spaetzle appetizer, which was incredible. The rabbit was tender and delicious and the creamy spaetzle was brightened up by the leeks and fresh herbs. For our entrees, we enjoyed the venison and the duck. Both were cooked to perfection, tender, flavorful, and paired with perfect accompaniments.  The nettles served with the venison was buttery, salty, and crave-worthy.  The cabbage served with the duck was amazing as well. For dessert, we enjoyed the Salzburger Nockerl, which is like a scuffle served with huckleberries.  It was light and airy and the huckleberries delightfully tart and delicious. We also had the rhubarb strudel with creme fraiche ice cream. The strudel itself was a bit difficult to cut through and, while tasty, was not anything special. The creme fraiche ice cream and the strawberries however may have been the most delicious things I've ever tasted. This was a truly exceptional experience from start to finish.

51,euDYj9dZT41zwvf43yElVA,Victoria O.,4.0 star rating,"I had Valentine's Day dinner here. I would give it 5 stars but usually I hold off on that until I've been twice. 125 for V-Day 4 course prix fixe. It was one of the best meals I've had as an adult. Memorable. One surprise to me: there's more fish than sausage. I expected lots of sausage or wurst and since pork is not my thing (and when I eat pork it's a chop or carnitas or roast pork), I was worried about finding things on the limited menu. My friend is not into fish and they made him an off menu spaetzle. It was magical. Even without the truffles. I had no idea spaetzle was like a light gnocchi. I thought more like risotto which except on rare occasions I find heavy, like you just consumed a carbohydrate brick. I much prefer pasta or gnocchi to risotto and thought this would be more like that. (The only thing I know about spaetzle, in fact, is that Meg Ryan's character in Prelude to a Kiss makes it and that this is a selling point with Alec Baldwin, whose evil stepmother made it until she discovered he liked it so much.) The desserts were beyond compare. I have told half a dozen people about this place. Most had been (solvent people on the UES and W Village who own rather than rent). But if my budget permitted dining at places like this, I would put this on my top 10 fancy restaurant list. The decor is original and beautiful: casually elegant but in a  W Village not uptown way. Service was outstanding until we wanted to pay. I have never in all my life had so much trouble getting a check. The couple next to us was amused. Well, the husband. The wife was stuck up and not nice but when she went to the bathroom, the husband joked that he intended to order the check before the third course on the theory that it might arrive by the end of dessert. Just wild. Our server was wonderful: young, friendly, knowledgable, attentive. Then he went fishing. The crowd was considerably younger than I would have thought given the price. But there were some in their 50s and early 60s. I loved my dinner. A truly memorable meal.",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"

53,xMMl5suDwd0XmRPTYmnCgw,Jeffrey D.,5.0 star rating,"I've had the pleasure of enjoying my evening (or 7PM-ish) dinner here last week on Saturday (12 June) (as of this review) and it was spectacular! I haven't been here in ~3 years, and back then, I frequented there a bit more often with people from my past. Unfortunately that can't be done anymore, but relishing some enjoyable moments from my past, I wished to revisit some good places and venues l, and here was one of them!One of the last legs of my trekking through NYC and almost clocked in 13mi of walking/jogging/running and relishing in the great sights of the city, I was enlightened to see an old memory of the restaurant, not too far from the West Side riverfront and close enough to West Village, where you see the masonry buildings and apartments, and happy vibes. Naturally exhausted (fasting), I went in and expected a good time.When I entered (close to the door) I was asked by the restaurant receptionist if I needed help, and I wanted to be seated, and I told them about my reservation, albeit it was for close to 7PM, and I wanted to eat and leave as soon as possible (already exhausted by earlier today), and after a brief conversation with other restaurant staff, I was enlightened to be seated. As I remembered (although vaguely), Kurt Gutenbrunner has a few other places with his magic fingers, like an upholstery store which is a neighbor of Wallsé, Cafe Sabarsky, embedded in the Neue Gallerie (featuring Austrian/German art pieces) situated in the Upper East Side, and Blaue Gans, which isn't that far off from the Upholstry Store/Wallsé. I've been to those other establishments many years ago, and may go again for nostalgia in the future (did enjoy the Neue Gallerie/Cafe Sabarsky)!When I entered, the restaurant looked cozy and very welcoming, and from the side I was dining in, I was 1 of ~4 diners when I entered (I believe there's another side for a bigger ensemble of diners). A few art pieces of Kurt and contemporary music playing, along with a full bar (too bad I can't have alcohol), and I was seated and greeted to a friendly waitress who did the normal procession of greetings and handed me a menu of wine/spirits/other alcohol and the regular menu. Although I can't have alcohol (moral reasons), I was assured that I could be treated to a virgin cocktail, which I refused. Instead, along with the sparkling water I so desired due to being parched, I asked for a glass of Einspänner, because you can't go wrong with Austrian coffee with a stellar Austrian meal! Also it's a good way for me to practice my German/Deutsch, which is another reason why I loved coming here again. Minutes pass by, and when I'm ready to formally order dinner, I was distraught that all of the entrees (main dishes) were chock full of meat, and since I'm a vegetarian, it certainly didn't bode well, and some of the appetizers didn't seem to help either. Years ago, I would've loved a Wiener Schnitzel (which would've been fantastic), so seeing a small discontent mood, my waitress suggested by ordering from there instead. So I went with the ""White Asparagus, Water Cress, Olive Oil, Radishes, Cornichons"" and a ""Spätzle, Rabbit, Spring Peas, Tarragon, Chanterelles, Leeks"" while omitting the rabbit. So I patiently waited, and the food came out, speedily enough (not a lot of diners), which was dandy! The White Asparagus/Spargle was great and the olive oil gave it an extra sense of texture, and I said my compliments to both my waitress and the chef. Then while that plate was bussed and awaiting my Spätzle, a few minutes and that came too. It was also spectacular, and my premonition that it would still have rabbits was also dispelled. So great, so rich! Also, when my order of Asparagus came, a plate of bread (rye maybe (?)) arrived on my table, along with butter, so I enjoyed that too while in the waiting process in between plates.Then, my sweet tooth senses were tingling again, and usually it's a custom for me to try out a dessert every time I dine in at a restaurant. I remembered that although Wallsé doesn't do Sacher cake, which would've made the meal perfect, I also remembered that I loved the Salzbrger Nockerl years ago, and seeing reviews on Yelp further aided my decision. A few more minutes passed and I received my prized dessert, which was as fluffy as I remembered years ago, and as delectable and sweet as what Yelp reviewers/word of mouth portray it as. Soft and fluffy on the outside, warm and sweet/tart/tangy on the inside, and it was coated with powdered sugar. I also said my regards to the chef for this one!With a night well done, had to take my leave. My waitress handed me a sample of hazelnuts with cocoa and powdered sugar prior to paying, and then I gave my last thanks, and headed off.

Try the east coast halibut, which is served over cucumbers, chanterelles, and dill jus ($34). It's super refreshing especially during the summer and its surprisingly filling, despite it being just one medium size piece of fish. Of course, you also need to try the wiener schnitzel, the only thing on the menu that can actually be considered authentic. It's served with potato cucumber salad and lingonberries ($36).

The dining room was very hopping, and the vibe was very hip. There were people in jeans, but no one in ties. That was just the overall atmosphere here.For me, the entrées are better than the appetizers. My foie gras coffee appetizer was fine. However, the plate it came on was incorrect - it had a small base like a bowl and then a very wide 4-inch brim. They put a lot of the food components on the brim, so when you would go to cut or pick up the food, the whole plate would rattle around and spill. The flavors themselves were fine, but I don't know if I even ate the dish appropriately. Throughout the meal, food was just placed in front of us without it being explain. That does disservice to the customer as well as to the chef, especially since his creations are not being eaten as he intended. The chicken schnitzel entree was delicious. Perfectly cooked! But I'm not sure it's worth coming here, it tasted very much like regular Austrian schnitzel I have had before.Our main waiter was competent, but kind of disappeared throughout the meal. He would pop in and out at random times, which is not really how I envision service at a Michelin one-star restaurant. I will say that I did not like the sommelier at all- it's a big pet peeve of mine when they just choose the most expensive wine in the group type you want. I understand if that may be the best wine, but if you pick the most expensive one, provide a second option. When a sommelier just goes to the most expensive wine, I implicitly disregard his or her recommendations. I did the same thing here, and opted for a cocktail instead of wine. I read about the cocktails online, and the vodka and cucumber water vodka option was delicious.Overall, for the price point I paid, I was not overly impressed with Wallsé. I'm not saying it was overpriced, because the food was somewhat intricate, there just wasn't a wow factor that I was expecting before I walked in.

When each of went to the rest room downstairs we smelled the great small of freshly baked bread - and yet the bread we got was not all that great. Austrian potato salad is a well known dish which should have some tang - and yet this potato salad tasted of nothing but cucumber and we left most of it. The apple strudel was a little disappointing. There is actually about 25% the size of an actual apple strudel (with a price about 300% of a standard apple strudel in bakery. It almost tasted like raw apple in a pastry shell that was falling apart. It also came with some little spoons of ice cream or something. I wouldn't order this again We enjoyed the wine last time, but this time the several we tried all seemed to be fairly dry.Their standard coffee is good as usual.",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"

He was very friendly and funny, and made some excellent wine recommendations. Also, my friend wanted a negroni, and Jean Paul was kind enough to pour some small samples of different gins to help make a cocktail to his liking. I wish I could remember the starter I had-it was fantastic. We also had a rabbit risotto that was spectacular, and the chicken entree. The presentation was beautiful, and the food was heaven.

The atmosphere reminds me of a small European cafe, and there is abundant outdoor seating on the sidewalk if you prefer eating al fresco. I was surprised that for one of my first Michelin-starred restaurant experiences, the food wasn't better. I started with the bibb lettuce, and followed that with the roasted chicken breast with fava beans, and white asparagus. The bibb lettuce came as almost a head of lettuce with dressing poured over it and a few pumpkin seeds scattered throughout the plate - it wasn't fantastic. The main course was small and surprisingly lacked the flavor I would ordinarily expect of small plates. Needless to say, you will likely leave here hungry. Also, I wish they had a better beer selection. For an Austrian/German restaurant, you would expect them to carry more than one beer selection.

It wasn't flashy, simple white table cloth and comfortable seats. Of the 6 courses, I think the only dish that stood out to me personally, was the dessert, Salzburger Nockerel, which was delicious! I've never had anything like it, and I enjoyed it immensely! The braised rabbit spätzle was really good, rabbit was tender. Lobster dish was cooked to perfection. My least favorite dish was the Foie Gras.. I thought it was tasteless and had a weird texture to it. Yuck! :-/Service was top-notch. Attentive but not intrusive.

I asked for primarily seafood as I prefer lighter courses during the summer. Leo did an amazing job pairing cocktails with each meal. I was pleasantly surprised with the tomato water pepper martini paired with the soft shell crab. The sauces and food were very flavorful, but the martini added just the right level of spice to the meal. The seafood was all cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. I was very impressed. It isn't an easy feat to pair cocktails with meals as many times the drinks can overpower the food. But Leo did an outstanding job picking the right drink to accentuate the flavors in the meal. All of the wait staff were very attentive but Gabrielle went out of her way to ensure I had an enjoyable meal and got exactly what I wanted. I was very impressed with the restaurant. It had a great upscale vibe with a cozy west village flare that made it feel as though I was eating at the neighborhood spot. Wallse is definitely a west village gem.

The location and interior of the restaurant instantly give you warm feels with intimate and classy but relaxing ambiance, the sommelier got us started with a great Austrian white wine, and then we sat back and spent the next hour and half enjoying the apps, entrees, and dessert. Highlights included the duck, the spatzle, beef tenderloin, and I really loved the nockerl for dessert (an awesome marshmellowy thing). The service was impeccable. Seriously one of the best we've had, they were informative and friendly and we felt like old friends by the time we left.

And the thing was, it wasn't like the entree was on its way, we had to wait for the entree for quite sometime, it felt like, after the appetizers were taken away. The dessert was very forgettable. I guess we're not used to pay these prices for some toasted marshmallows (dish was recommended by one of the servers).Overall really great experience. This place has excellent cocktail drinks and although it only had one beer, it was a very nice beer. We did not try the wine.

I will echo the comments of a previous reviewer and say that I was surprised the food was not better, both given the Michelin star and the price. The food is very expensive, with the average appetizers high teens / low twenties and the average entree well over $30. I have included notes on specific dishes below: Maine Lobster Salad, Asparagus, Radishes, Endives - very boring, lobster slightly overcooked, and such small portions for $24! This was literally a few tiny pieces of lobster on lettuce with a few (pretty flavorless) pieces of asparagus. Foie Gras Terrine, Pear Chutney, Hazelnut, Brioche - the foie gras was pretty good, but I found the compilation of the plate strange; this was not a cohesive dish. They had the pad of foie gras and then brioche to smear it over, but then some sort of sponge cake with a chocolate sauce and then chutney? Not sure what they were going for here. East Coast Halibut, Cucumbers, Chanterelles, Dill Jus - this is named the ""specialty of the house"", so perhaps my fault that I am always inclined to order that even if I don't think the dish looks particularly interesting. This was just steamed halibut in a mediocre sauce with nothing else...not a dish I will remember in a couple weeks. Soft Shell Crabs, Ramps, Almonds, Lobster Sauce - this was actually very good (or at least the best out of anything I tried); I would recommend this dish if you are trying out the restaurant. The crabs were cooked very well and the sauce was delicious. Salzburger Nockerl, Huckleberries - this is another famous dish from the region, it is an egg-white souffle on a bed of huckleberries and sauce. To me, it just tasted like cooked marshmellows (which I will admit I am not a fan of, though others might be). Rhubarb Strudel, Compote, Crème Fraîche Ice Cream - fine but forgettable.",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"

To be honest, it's when I pass by Wallsé on my way home and see how pretty it is that enticed me to first suggest coming here when our overseas buddy came for a recent work trip. It is really the first and only place I have come to try Austrian/ German food in NYC and our group of friends were all pretty excited to try this top rated restaurant on our bucket list. Upon arriving, we noticed the art decor and coziness of the restaurant. It's very cozy, very cute and the ambiance truly deserves all the praise it gets. After we were escorted to our seats and I found the plush couches very comfortable and luxurious. For the food, we were pleasantly surprised to find that you didn't have to order a pre-fix dinner, so we opted to order randomly (not that pre-fixes are bad, that night we just weren't in the mood to eat a multi-course meal). We did share a few apps, one of which was the foie gras. My whole group really recommends this, especially if you are a foie gras person. For my entree, I opted for the lamb which was super tender and absolutely delish. The veggies that come with it are also superbly cooked. For the most part, everything was made wonderfully but I didn't have a favorite that really stuck out to me, other than what I ordered. My friends had some of mine and they agreed that they also enjoyed the lamb over their scallops and rabbit. Both of those other dishes were also tasty, but perhaps we don't quite have the pallet for rabbit so we couldn't fully appreciate the taste. Overall, it was a nice experience here. The service and quality are what you expect from a Michelin rated NYC restaurant. Venturing to Wallsé is definitely worth it, especially if you want to try Austrian German food.

Probably the best restaurant in whole manhattan.I have to add that Wallse is michelin starred which is well deserved.So, you know i have been moaning about the generic character of the restaurant world and the paucity of german and austrian cuisine in NYC. Wallse makes up for that.Wiener Schnitzel, Spatzle or whatever main dish you get. You will not regret. In fact i don't really think i need to review everything because Wallse is amazing. But just so you know, i have lived in Wien and Germany for a significant amount of time and can tell you that much that this place is the only one that approximates the german cuisine -haute cuisine at least, not the bratwurst bullshit or the oktoberfest mania that you can find ubiquitously. As appetizer get the lobster ravioli or the foie gras terrine or the scallops. My fave is the ravioli but whatever others are good as well does not matter everything here is good.Apart from the delicious schnitzel with the great sauces and the salad etc. You can get the Goulash or the pork or the venison loin which are all great. I do not love fish that much. (You will see that when i review Le bernardin and Marea for which i won't be telling as good a story.) But these seemed appetizing as well (as far as i could browse from the companions, other tables etc.)Wallse has amazing desserts. Salzburger Nockerl or the Mozart Kugel are both amazing. The former one is a huge creamy, foamy dessert which comes as a hot surprise and the latter one is a bowl of chocolaty delight with pistachios which both are amazing. You can also get the Kaiser schmarren which is the crepes. Wine list in Wallse is very extensive. Very. They have very good stuff and some are hard to find elsewhere. You can spot wines from Hungary etc. which are i would say rare (you would be able to find moscato d'asti approximately in every restaurant but for other things this is not the case.) So this is definitely a plus plus.Interior design is amazing. Amazing. The paintings on the walls. Very artsy and authentic and yes beautiful. You can also opt for dining outside especially in a hot summer night but still you will not be disappointed because the decorative lights are so cute and nice and you will have the chance to browse people strolling around without feeling too much exposed cause wallse has a very nice place nested on this Washington St.The service is also very good-great. Knowledgeable and attentive and courteous. The only other place that i could consider a contestant for Wallse -in terms of the kitchen- would be seasonal but it has not acquired the level of service and other things that i found here yet.So. It is unfair that Wallse only has 1 michelin star. And deserves more than that to be honest.

My first Michelin-star restaurant experience was thus dedicated to German/Austrian cuisine, which was out of my expectation. (Trust me, the only things I knew about German food were smoky pig feet and of course, beer! - And I believe someone out there shares the same thought.)We ordered smoky salmon as appetizer, black sea bass and Wiener Schnitzel for entrees, and Salzburger Nockerl for dessert. I would say food was good but not so surprisingly amazing that you can lose your jaw. I picked sea bass guessing it was a safe choice, but the meat turned out a little dry while the skin was crispy. Smoky salmon was very tender but a pinch of salt would not destroy it. Service was nice and sweet, if only the wait for dishes could be shorter. I may sound a bit picky, but after all, I did enjoy the lively, clean and classic vibe and atmosphere around tables, especially with the restaurant's location in West Village.

The music played in the restaurant looped about 3 times during my time there (I didn't stay for more than two hours), and the waiter was very uninterested in what he had to serve us. There really isn't much to say about this place, other than that I have no idea how it managed to earn a star. Maybe it was a bad day, maybe the good chefs were out sick, who knows.

The interior is formal but still has a  cozy and warm feel. There are candles and fresh flowers on every table. The service is very attentive and cordial. I never had an empty glass. They weren't hanging over us the whole time either though. My family all had wine and cocktails but I was nursing a hangover so passed! For an appetizer I had the chestnut soup. It was creamy but not overly filling. Perfect for a cold, winter day. For my main course I had the Scottish salmon topped with caviar. A bit indulgent, eh? It was cooked perfectly so that the pieces fell right off. It was also paired with a gnocchi-like side and creamed spinach. My sister got the schnitzel which is kind of the thing to get at a Austrian restaurant. She said it was better than some she's had in Austria which is a pretty bold compliment. My mom got the venison and my dad got the duck. I'm not a fan of either so I didn't try them.  For dessert we shared the Salzburger Nockerl. If you have never had this you need to try it here! It's a very light and airy dish made from whipped eggs. Sweet but not heavy.Very nice place with a unique menu. I also love that it's situated right in the middle of residential Greenwich Village.

125,tCq4hTTnpCqIJAFqmfu7Eg,Jordan S.,4.0 star rating,"Prudence and I came to Wallsé on a night that felt lifted from the pages of an Arthur Schnitzler novella. The eerie calm, forlorn buildings, and steady crunch of snow beneath our feet lent this seldom traveled section of the West Village overtones of Vienna, isolating in its looming detachment. When we arrived, met by further looming objects, this time the portrait of Kurt Gutenbrunner, the chef of the restaurant, the solemnity was almost too much. But when you get beyond the slightly stiff service and the grandiose floral arrangements, you begin to appreciate the subtle manifestations of whimsy, and more pertinently, the earnest approach to the cuisine. Given that Mr. Gutenbrunner is Austrian born, I initially worried that the earnestness would progress into a zeal, leaving him to create dishes that, while faultlessly Austrian, would be indicative of neither his cleverness nor his range. These musings were made immediately more difficult by the depth of the wine list. The red we settled on was full-bodied, slightly sweet in the finish, and not to mention both Austrian and affordable. The number of viable alternatives which remained simultaneously inexpensive and exciting was surprisingly large, provided one opts for a bottle; wines by the glass are surprisingly costly. But my misgivings returned upon my first glance at the menu. Aside from dessert, the offerings looked staid, traditional. We voiced our orders, while I hid my skepticism as best I could.Skepticism which was somewhat diminished at the presentation of our amuse, a chestnut soup far heartier and complex than I was anticipating. The worst of my fears dissipated with the first course: the quark spatzle with braised rabbit. It is evident that his time working at Bouley has imparted Mr. Gutenbrunner with an otherwise unexpected affinity for vegetables; the root vegetables and king oyster mushrooms playing more prominent parts in the dish than the rabbit. What bits of rabbit there were, however, acted the perfect gamey, smoky compliment to the creamy spatzle, while the flourish of herbs that garnished the course provided a degree of vibrancy not normally attributed to such a heavy dish. My entree, the rack of lamb, followed in much the same vein. While the lamb was tender, perfectly seared, and encased in a crust worthy of fawning over, it was overshadowed by the delicate preparation of the salsify root. Boiled, then roasted, finished with a light sprinkling of fresh thyme, the root instantly transcended a mere meat and potatoes pairing, its firm texture a welcome contrast to the supple lamb. The tart Zweigelt grape coolis was a wonderful twist on the typical lamb and mint pairing, while concurrently enhancing the earthy sweetness of the salsify. Prudence, the more adventurous of our pair, chose to follow with the sweetbreads. Though not truly a fan of most offal, I had enjoyed sweetbreads on other occasions, but found this rendition to be a shade too bitter for my taste. The chanterelle mushrooms and assorted carrots and asparagus could not redeem it, nor could the jus enveloping each of the disparate items. No one component stood out enough to trump the sweetbreads setback, which was unfortunate, because the dish had the potential to be great. Thankfully, dessert was another success, if not from a technical standpoint, from one of taste. The Viennese Quartet, I'll admit, chosen predominately for its name, was a skillful pairing of traditionalism and elegance, most neatly encapsulated by the stunningly rich hot chocolate, capped with its ephemeral whipped heavy cream. Both it and the other items, a quark and cherry ice cream, in particular, belie the notion that everything good at Wallsé is produced through the severity Mr. Gutenbrunner is known for. In this, his thirteenth year at the restaurant, he may even be having fun.",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"

I finally made it there last night and had some mixed emotions.I love the atmosphere. Cozy, lots of cool art, and really stellar service. The waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and was very accomodating. They definitely get points for their approach to the tasting menus. 4 or 6 courses from which you can ""create your own"" from anything listed on the menu. I definitely far prefer to do this rather than be subjected to a set tasting or having to ask the waiter for substitutes.I went with the 4 course menu and decided to add an extra course to make it a 5 course including dessert.They provided two types of bread, which were nothing special or noteworthy. Just something to fill your stomach with as you wait for the good stuff to come. I was kind of disappointed, as I figured a restaurant of this stature would provide a better bread service.First course- Scallops with a rainbow of cauliflower and a spicy marinade- This was a last second addition and I am glad I added it because it was one of the better courses. 2 perfectly seared, large diver scallops surrounded by tri color cauliflower. Simple, yet very well done. Nothing outside the box, but the technique was to the tee.Second course- Poached lobster with spaetzle and tomato-paprika course- I was really anticipating this one and I have read they do lobster very well. Unfortunately, this was a disappointment. The claws of the lobster turned out to be very chewy and overcooked and I just felt like the dish lacked any kind of bold flavoring. I found myself having to add salt and pepper as well as the seasoning was lacking.Third course- Roasted duck with chestnuts, cippolinis, black rice, pear compote, and foie gras sauce- Again this could have been better. The duck was overcooked from my requested rare, more like medium. It was also sliced a bit too thin for my liking. I'm not a real chestnut fan and didn't feel these added any significant flavor. I kept asking myself ""where is the foie gras in this sauce"" because I didn't taste it. The pear compote was very good though. Again, I found myself each for the salt and pepper shaker. Overall, duck can still be good when its a bit overcooked, but I wanted great.Fourth course- Rack of lamb with turnips, eggplant, and Zweigelt sauce- Wow! This was definitely the best course of the night. They gave me an entree size portion containing 3 chops as opposed to the tasting portion. The lamb was perfectly rare as requested this time. Thick, fatty, meaty and rubbed with a mustard crust made this a flavor explosion. The eggplant and turnips were the perfect sides. Where some other dishes fell short on flavor, this was incredible. Perfectly seasoned and definitely could have eaten another plate of this. A great way to end the savories with a bang.Dessert- Their sugature Salzburger Nockerl and Huckleberries. After seeing the pictures of this thing I knew I was ordering it. This was spectacular! Great presentation as well. It was like a crunchy meringue on top, giving way to an eggy custardy souffle, and then on bottom was the huckleberries for a terrific surprise. It was a mix of marshmallow, meringue, and souffle all in one.",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"

Wished they went easy on the sodium :(Came here on a date and was excited because I never had German food before. However, it failed miserably.Scallops. Not sure why anyone would ever serve them this way. They were semi-raw over a bed of lettuce with lemon juice.. I almost threw up after one piece because of the taste it produced. I think scallops should only be served two ways. Fully cooked or rare (done well at Japanese places and Morimoto). Oysters: I do not want to say this.. but I have to.. I do not recommend these. So apparently you are suppose to eat them the way they are served. No lemons. No cocktail sauce. They drizzled it with some champagne.. but it tasted like salt water to me. Plus they did not do a thorough job of cleaning it. I ended up eating bits of the shell.. I stopped at two pieces and this was squeezing all the lemon juice on it!! oh dear. My poor date. He felt so bad that I didn't like the food.Ordered two sides: Brussel Sprouts and Quark Spätzle.Brussel Sprouts was just.. steamed. really?Quark Spatzle: I swear.. this is like marinaded with salt or something.. tasted like pasta with alfredo sauce dousted with salt.I ordered the Salmon. I asked for it medium. Came out medium rare. I dare not send it back to the kitchen because I worked in the industry and I rather not eat food than send it back. Needless to say.. I had a mild tummy ache that night.Ordered a grand marnier crepe with sorbet: one of 2 reasons why this place got any stars back. this was amazing. the fluffy texture mixed with the freshest of the sorbet.. love! the other reason is the cocktails. menu is simple but at least they got it right. I ordered the cucumber pear infused martini. ON POINT. I also had their blood orange cosmo. AWESOME. and we ordered a bottle of pinot noir.

Wait staff were somewhat lagging, not timely.  Not what one would expect at this price category.  Didn't complain about this but we mysteriously had a new server midway through the meal.3.) The most unfortunate thing that could possibly happen to a restaurant - they served me the worst piece of meat I've ever had and tried to pass it off as venison.  It was dry, cooked to leather and in edible.  Tasted like bad liver...  In their favor they did attempt to repair the damage by not charging for the entree but by then we were completely disenchanted.  In a city with restaurants every 3 feet and so many wonderful food options - why I would ever want to subject myself to lackluster anything when spending my very hard earned money is just crazy.I will never return and I will never recommend Wallse.",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"

We were told it would be 7-10 minutes before the correct dish could be served.  The busboy said we could keep the incorrect order until the right one arrived, but another waiter promptly took the incorrect order away.For a restaurant as esteemed as Wallse, this is astounding incompetence.  The bartender, the greeters, and the kitchen all failed significantly.  I would not go back to Wallse, and I would caution anyone I know about going there as well.",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"

I can't remember, I just know...the food is thoughtfully prepared, different to many of the other restaurants in NY (sometimes, I am looking for something in between american nouveau, italian and french...so to me, I felt Wallse hit that weird niche craving I had going on...?), and has a well-deserved repertoire.My favorite dishes I always have here is is the steak rosti, rabbit spatzle and their poached eggs.

They were out of Rye, which is a minor complaint, but said Rye (Rittenhouse to be exact) is the base for several drinks on the menu, none of which could be made.  How about you run to the store and get some Mr. Manager?  Then again, maybe he passed out from the heat.  It's not hard to acquire, and your ROI would be phenomenal not just on the booze, but on the fact that you can make drinks people want and they might get drunk enough to enjoy your restaurant.  After all, I really wanted a nice cool drink because I was SWEATING.  Did I mention that?Overall, this restaurant is over priced garbage and I would never return without eating a power bar first to fill me up.  The paintings alone are off-putting enough to keep me out, and reminiscent of Vigo the Carpathian a la Ghostbusters fame..

Then a gentleman in the back looked like Phillip Seymour Hoffman circa ""along comes polly"". And then in walked this massive party of older distinguished looking men and women. As we're joking around, trying to figure out who these people may look like, Matt drops in and tells us it is Lou Reed....yes...THE Lou Reed (walk on the wild side if you seriously don't know). Amazing perk.Anyway, the actual restaurant looked wonderful. The drinks at the bar were perfect and the menu looked really nice as well.",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"
162,VNLd6JMVsKGeOLuaUpdG7w,Ainsley D.,5.0 star rating,"I'm not generally a complainer when it comes to being taken out to dinner. I figure, if I'm not paying for it, I should just shut up and enjoy. As a vegan, this can become sort of prickly and uncomfortable, as I'll just try to look pretty and pick at an uninspired mesclun salad while everybody else dines on the chef's special of bouillabaisse or venison. I figured that an Austrian restaurant like Wallse would provide the same sort of experience. I was wrong.After I (quietly, shamefully) asked the waiter if the item of the menu under the section ""Only Vegetables"" could be made without butter, he walked off to the kitchen and came back momentarily with an affirmative. I couldn't believe it. A restaurant this nice offered both an appetizer and an entree that were suitable for a vegan? No way. Yes way. I had the special appetizer, an heirloom tomato salad that was absolute perfection, followed by an assortment of root vegetables and artichoke in a light pesto broth. The flavor of both was exquisite. And although I was too full for dessert, our waiter checked to find out which of the offerings were made without dairy or animal products before he even approached our table. That is some classy shit right there.Other things that made this restaurant knock it clear out of the park:- The waiter we had was so attentive, it nearly felt like we were on a first date with him. He also looked and spoke slightly like the Old Spice guy, which, in my book, is a huge plus.- The ambiance of the place is cute, but the best part is that you can actually hear the people you are dining with. - An array of tiny complimentary treats are served even if you don't have dessert - from chocolate covered almonds to miniature cookies. Nice touches like that are something that seems to have been forgotten by more flashy restaurants. - An icon of British post-punk who will remain unnamed was seated nearby.

167,qC9OHq-vBnKhrFKrEc5oMw,Jim U.,3.0 star rating,"This restaurant boasts one Michelin star specializing in Austrian fare.  It is unfortunate that this type of cuisine is underrepresented in the city as it can be quite good.  For dinner I had the Kavalierspitz with a side of Quark spaetzle.  The Kavalierspitz was boiled beef cutlets decoratively adorned with spring root vegetables and horseradish.  Additionally, on the side there was apple horseradish sauce and a potato rosti which was like a small potato pancake.  The beef was prepared well, but was a bit bland by itself.  The inclusion of the apple horseradish however really brought the dish together.  The root vegetables were fresh and flavorful as well.  The rosti was good, but clunky.  The side of spaetzle was unlike the spaetzle I had in Germany.  This was more concentrated and creamier, but not better.  I almost opted to have this as an appetizer, but I saw that I could have it as a side dish instead.  But they are not the same dish apparently.  If you order it as an appetizer, they include braised rabbit, wild mushrooms, peas, and tarragon.  Now that would have made it sing.  I wish I had read the fine print.  To accompany my entree I had a glass of Zweigelt Umathum which I think paired well with my selection.  I was unfamiliar with this wine, but I liked it.  I was surprised though that between the wine list and the cocktail menu, they did not offer any beer.  That seemed out of step as Austria does have a nice selection of beers that could have paired well with many of their dishes.  For dessert I had the Mozartkugel which is served as sphere of chocolate powder with a rich pistachio nougatine center.  Exterior to the sphere was a large pistachio crisp and a few loose pistachios.  This dessert was just wonderful.  It is really among the best desserts I have had in the city, and I highly recommend it.  The ambience was actually very nice.  The decor was striking and consistently interesting.  This was impressive given that the dominant colors were black and white.  I felt very at ease here.Overall, the restaurant is good, but not great.  At this price point, better food can definitely be had in the city, but not better Austrian food.  I think because they fill that niche so well, they are among the other Michelin starred restaurants.  And I was more impressed with the dessert than the entree.  But I don't want to take that too far as nothing was less than good.  Tentatively recommend.  3.5 stars",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"

Austrian wine, that strong....who would have said, it goes down pretty well.Ok wine, you probably never heard any wines on the list, the winery, the type of grape any of it, nada, so you rely on the waiter. Yes sure I've heard of Riesling before but that is about it. But they go from $40 to few hundred so you settle for a budget and let the wine waiter do the magic. He proposes the wine, tells you the winery, the type, the denomination in perfect germanic accent. You do not even grasp one workd but nod and hope for the better. So: -Riesling for $70 for delicious, buttery as Cassagne Montrached, fruity like a chardonnay (am I saying the same thing?) and not dry like a pino grigio.-Red Pinot Noir for $97. Flat, blah, really not worth it and after telling the waiter about it, the whole waiting staff proceedes to taste it to tell us that it is how its meant to be, blah I guess. We order another bottle but end up paying for the first one nontheless as it showed on the bill-Another red for $85, like a cab, very good indeedAsk me names? No ideaStarters all great, really very good. Soft shell crab amazing! Can they make a tomato salad look good? Yes they can!Main courses:Bouillabaisse - don't bother, really - uneventfullSchnitzel - excellent. But do you need to come here and pay $31 for a schnitzel?

Wallse's chef-owner, Kurt Gutenbrunner, is as hip as he is demanding and the food at Wallse' is absolutely 5 star. Local greens and spicy radishes with pumpkinseed oil sound a bit tame? Wrong!!! It is brimming with complexity, tasting of the summer and alluding to the onrushing Autumn all at once.      The poached lobster with cherries, fava beans and bearnaise sauce should just be renamed Lobster Caleb, because it seems tailor-made for my taste....which is exquisite, by the way.A side of Potato rosti can trick you into thinking the Salzburg castle is right outside the window, rather than the West Village.All the desserts are tempting, but I can't resist the peach strudel with vanilla ice cream...modern decadence and homey comfort all at once.      Some wouldn't subtract a star for the teres chic, minimalist-modern decor, but the space is crowded and noisy for the prices that you will pay.",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"
187,MbJjlgMFLGpabcu2OKEMdw,Buo Z.,4.0 star rating,"I think sitting next to Marc Jacobs here totally biased me. This place is probably 3 stars for me, but because of him, I am giving it 4 stars. The Lingonberries capirinha here is so strong. Don't let the pink color fool you. I took two sips and had to pass it to someone else. Definitely not a girly drink.I opted for the four-course, which can be a combination of any three items on the menu  (1 appetizer+1fish+1meat; 3 fish; 3 meat; 2 fish+1 meat; etc...) plus one dessert. Someone told me about the small portions here, but I didn't fully grasp the meaning of that until I had all four courses. I started off with the foie gras terrine on top of pear gelee with three triangles of brioche. The dish was quite tasty and I had to ration each little side of the triangular foie gras for each piece of brioche, knowing that the entire dish could easily be devoured in three bites. Somehow I extended it to six. Delicious stuff.Next, I had the lobster tail with butternut squash. I loved biting into the lobster, but this sadly was gone in three bites. My last savory dish was the dover sole wrapped with langoustine sitting next to spinach and small little balls of potatoes. This was good, but the entire time I kept trying to figure out if the spinach was fully washed. I kept biting into some hard sandy texture. I sure hope it was the salt or pepper or something edible. Finally, for dessert I opted for the apple streudel. I had to have the waitress explain all the menu items on the dessert list, because there was not one single item I recognized beyond ""sorbet"" and apple streudel. The streudel was slightly on the sour side and wasn't sweet at all. The kitchen paired this with an almond sorbet instead of the usual vanilla ice cream. The sorbet was definitely the best part of the dessert. Overall, I can't say that any dishes wowed me. All the dishes were pretty cookie-cutter but I suppose they were executed decently. I definitely expected the fish or meat dishes to be a bit bigger.

The restaurant never seemed that loud or that packed all night which was nice because it created an enjoyable dining ambiance.

201,RWj5DyT69dp21euPhsaq0A,Jackie C.,2.0 star rating,"After having to cancel a reservation atWallse months ago, the interesting Austrian menu drew me back.  My husband and I invited another""foodie"" couple out for dinner.  i had relatively high expectations due to the gourmet style menu and the prices.    Upon arrival, we walked into the dining room or what I would describe as a steam room.  The doors and windows were open with minimal air conditioning, in August, needless to say it was not a comfortable temperature to eat and enjoy food.  We complained but didn't experience any temperature change.  Despite the uncomfortable climate in the dining room, the real disappointment was the food!!I started with fois gras which was good but uninspiring and not creative; it's pretty hard to mess that up.  I also tried the spaetzel, which being an Austrian restaurant was a signature dish.  I was quite disappointed.  It was lack luster and light on taste despite the rabbit in the dish which usually adds layers of flavor and richness, to any dish .  For the entree, I ordered the halibut which was the recommended fish entree by our waiter.  It was cooked properly but had very little flavor. I had to heavily salt and pepper the fish and sauce which is something i rarely do.  The sauce tasted very fresh but once again was borrring!!!!!  It was a tasteless green puree, who know's what it was because it had zero flavor.  With a pile of chanterelle mushrooms atop the halibut and the dill sauce(mystery green puree) I expected a diverse flavor experience with a refreshing crunch of cucumber, but what i experienced was fish and vegetables that had the flavor and taste steamed out.  Everything was cooked the proper time and nothing was overdone which makes it even more perplexing as to how the dish was so bland.  My husband had the artic char which he was not thrilled with.  He mirrored my sentiments that the fish was fresh and the dish had a clean taste but lacked flavor and originality.  All in all, the meal was totally meh.  I had difficulty saying anything about the meal because it was so tasteless but clearly had fresh, quality  ingredients.  For the high price tag, I would not return.  The whole table was disappointed with their entrees, although, no one hated theirs they just didn't stand out or excite.  Certainly, not worth the money!!",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"

The minimalistic design of the restaurant will leave you with a cold feeling. But I have no complaints about the Austrian food. The spatzle is top notch, the desserts are excellent and the wine list has some rare finds.Unfortunately Chef Kurt Guttenbrunner is nuts. I have personally seen him throw food at the wait staff and his temper tantrums are worse than a toddler needing a candy fix. I feel sorry for anyone who works for him or has to deal with him.  Lou Reed use to come in here all the time with his wife (she's nice, he's not) and Chef Crazy would come out of the kitchen to wait on Lou himself. Lou would never order anything off the menu and would request things he could have gotten at an American diner.I can't not recommend this place just based on an insane chef, because if that was the case I'd never eat out...but I wouldn't go here now that I've experienced it for myself.",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"

My husband and I have probably eaten here upwards of forty times. Last night was one of the best.  The menu has changed a bit, but  seasonal as always.  I started with a gnocchi-like pasta with big plump morel mushrooms in a foam broth and had the (new!) wild salmon, which was the best I can remember ever eating for my main course.  It also had some (bonus!) morel mushrooms.We sat at the bar as usual  and had a great time.  The bar is full of friendly, interesting people to chat it up.  Our favorite stranger conversation was with Sam Shepard.  He likes Nebraska, so we had a lot to talk about. Me being from Nebraska and all.  That was fun.If rhubarb is in season, you MUST get the dessert.  It will blow your mind. This is an excellent place to bring your out-of-town parents.

208,Yjx7AdYDqYBZ-m5ChoC4gg,P. P.,1.0 star rating,"Ok, so I guess I should have lent more credibility to the customer screaming at the maître d' as we walked into the restaurant to be seated... ""All you care about in this place is the Old White people in suits.""  I mean, the girl at the podium being shouted at was an attractive very dark skinned female who was staring at the shrieking customer with a blank WTF look that I figured was both hilarious and justified.  So we sat down not wondering what had so enraged this departing customer and her male partner.Hilariously, one of our group we were dining with that evening (6 in all) leaned over to me and pointed out  that we were the youngest people in the dining room by at least 30-40 years... ok, it was a bit of exaggeration, but made more amusing by the fact that the guy saying this had just celebrated his 40th birthday the week prior... that, and after looking around, he was right.  Things unfortunately deteriorated once we began to interact with the service.  Waiters loudly interrupted conversation and didn't hesitate before yelling water requests or specials, trying to shout louder than whoever was left talking.  An 8 month, pregnant woman at our table was told to remove her sweater from of the back of her chair (the owner it seems doesn't like things on the chairs).  Plates were cleared by either reaching across other diners or actually pushing a diner's arms out of the way to make a clear path (we were at a circular table with access from all directions).  Generally, all behavior that's neither acceptable nor tolerated at a greasy diner.The clincher of course was when the bill came.  Split 3 ways with 3 couples, the bill came on individual credit card slips... it seemed a bit high but everyone tipped their 20% and got ready to leave... luckily one of the group asked to see the itemized bill to check if tip was included (we were a group of 6).  It was then we realized that no itemized bill had been provided to our group.  Just dirty... You'd expect that sort of trick at a cheaper classless establishment, not one that purports to be a multi-stared venue.Complaints to the manager were met with a blank stare.  Literally a blank stare and a motion to the door.  After 20 long seconds of silence when he was asked if he had anything at all to say, he responded that ""he would apologize for his part in the issue, but that he personally had nothing to do with the problem so had nothing to apologize for,"" and bid us a good night.  Wow...  for a nearly $1,000 bill for 6 people (yeah it wasn't particularly inexpensive), I guess I expected more.Oh yeah, the food was ok.  Nothing to write home about,  (I do recall that the bacon on the scallop starter was burnt to a crisp and inedible), but the good points of the evening were absolutely ruined by the waitstaff, and management's subsequent response. You'll notice I haven't written other reviews on Yelp... that's because in a decade of NYC dining I've never been so offended to take the time to write something and go through the hassle of signing up.  I just hope this helps someone from wasting their money or having to put up with the terrible experience I did.  (Please feel free to re-post this review on any websites you find to be influential, I'm too lazy).",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"

If you have the option, reserve a table in the adjoining room which is much more spacious and quieter.  The food is impeccable.  I highly recommend a chef's tasting menu with the wine pairing.  It's costly but well worth it and the servers will guide you through the entire three hour meal with professionalism, never rushing  or intrusive.  The food was exquisite and if you find a better strudel in the city, let me know.  This is the perfect place for a special romantic evening or any other close celebration or occasion.",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"

I met one of the chefs from Wallse at Union Square green market a few years ago and had always meant visit. It's priced a bit out of my typical range so would have had to come up with a pretty good excuse to do it.Like Jon M., my friends and I happily stumbled into this low key corner spot, after walking away from the 2.5 hour wait at Spotted Pig (really, people, really !?).Lot's of interesting options on the menu. Plenty of choices for the fish-itarian, like myself but I wouldn't bring the veggie/vegan friends here. Although the cocktail list  was tantalizing, I ended with a very light and delicious Riesling.  We shared a beet salad and tasted the chestnut soup for appetizers. Both were perfectly lovely but had no special personality - which i guess is fine for that part of a meal.The Cod Strudel on the other hand was amazingly delicious and a very generous  portion. Two huge chunks of fish arrived wrapped in a light pastry - there was a tangy sauerkraut and spinach thing going on below it, some savory mushrooms  on top and cinnamon-y sauce surrounding it. it was really difficult not to over do it and eat the F out of this - but the thought of the dessert menu kept me in line. One of my friends had the steak but said it wasn't the choicest cut - I don't know anything about steak -  but she did say the flavors were good.As I mentioned, the desserts on the menu read so well that they needed to be ordered in multiple. We accidentally ended up with 2  mousses but they were different enough that I was not in the least disappointed. A fig based pile of the stuff layered with crispy squares of (maybe) pistachio toffee-ness, was creamy but light. From the market menu we selected a chocolate-peanut mousse that was simply off the hook!The atmosphere is not at all pretentious but still very elegant - the service - great, efficient but not pushy and the server was able to provide earnest sounding recommendations for those afflicted with decision making challenges ; )",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"

I think the chef could use a little cut in the general ego... he may have a Michelin star, but I think that may just be due to the general underrepresentation of this type of cuisine... He is by no means a star.I'll start off by saying I was able to try both the schnitzel and the rabbit spaetzle. My family is German, and my mother makes better schnitzel (a fantastic schnitzel, in fact). It's not that they were bad, it's just not what you'd expect from a fancy place. A little thinner and fresher tasting would have been nice. As for the rabbit spaetzle--a joke. The cream sauce and mushrooms were delicious, but where was the rabbit?? I found one tiny piece. Additionally, when we asked for their specialty coffee served with whipped cream it arrived so cold, the whipped cream wouldn't even melt. After stirring it just looked gross and lumpy, and did not melt into smooth deliciousness. Well, enough about the negatives. The desserts were delicious: apfelstrudel and Sachertorte. If you go here, get these. The Kaiserschmarrn was alright, but in the end just a pancake.Conclusion: go here if you're expecting something casually representative of Austrian food.

The service was amazing - so attentive and on top of everything. The wine was excellent - we drank a few different types by the glass, the Gruner being my favorite.  The dessert with huckle berries and a cloud of meringue was delicious. We ordered two for our party of 4 and I am glad we did. It was so good we almost ordered a third. I would give Wallse 5 stars but the food overall did not blow us away. I think I had very high expectations based on what I had heard. I will go back again soon.",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"

235,fVX3CFgAf6h31XLQnf7ZfA,Yeni H.,3.0 star rating,"cozy restaurant, almost empty, but expected on a rainy night in bad economy. while waiting for 2 late guests for approximately 20-30 mins, no bread was served until requested. friends like the bread but i preferred it warm. decided to get a bottle of reisling while waiting. server, who was cute, very friendly, nice and patient, made a good recommendation. came back constantly to make sure every was good.Steamed Halibut with local cucumbers, dill and mushrooms - recommended by server. tasty sauce, nicely cooked halibut, fresh. love it.Potato Rosti- $8 for a mini one, rather expensive. cold, hard and dry. don't like it and all.Beet Terrine with goat cheese and organic greens- friend liked this dish, although i thought it was only ok.Foie Gras terrine with poached rhubarb and brioche- after having about 5 foie gras dishes the night before, im just afraid to touch it. but later decided that i cannot hate foie gras and should just have a bite. tasted raw to me, but 2 friends who had it loved it.brook trout with creamed spinach and pine nuts- don't like creamed spinch. trout was good though.foods were served rather quickly. something to complain about: place was extremely warm for a rainy spring night. they probably turned up the heater because we all felt so stuffy and giddy(i was wearing a cami). even the woman sitting next to our table was sweating on her armpit. it was so warm that i have to step out for a few minutes to enjoy the cool breeze.we pretty much tried all the fish dishes since there's so many of us. they're all well-cooked and fresh. it was probably because of my super filling brunch that numbed my taste buds so nothing really appealled to me(except for my halibut). plus i was super tired. will come back with an empty stomach next time.",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"

239,QporOcT9XsVQgeVYScERKQ,Gourmet G.,5.0 star rating,"Hidden away on a quiet residential street in the West Village, this dining spot has a somewhat cold and sterile atmosphere that's out of step with its menu inspired by hearty Austrian comfort food, which cries out for a cozy room with beamed ceilings instead of the minimalist black-and-white decor, punctuated by a few oversized and dramatic canvasses, you'll find here. Tis the season for soup, so try either the creamy chestnut with an Armagnac-soaked prune or mildly spicy squash infused with a hint of curry. Potato pancakes topped with fresh lobster and fennel are another good starter. Spaetzel with braised rabbit, wild mushrooms, and sweet peas, honey-glazed breast of duck with sauteed Swiss chard and brioche dumplings, and traditional Hungarian goulash, with perfectly-seasoned, tender cubes of beef, chunky mushrooms, and a generous sprinkling of roast garlic cloves, are excellent entree options. Either Sacher torte with chocolate sorbet or warm apple strudel with rum-walnut ice cream should satisfy your sweet tooth for several weeks. In a neighborhood known for casual, inexpensive dining, prices here are unusually high, with entrees in the $24-36 range, but at list you'll leave feeling stuffed and satisfied.",Wallse,4.0 star rating,$$$,"German,, Austrian,, Modern, European"
