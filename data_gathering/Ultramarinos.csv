2,6es_04FrajEYVhuFv4Xpgw,Kristina P.,4.0 star rating,"The fact that I had never been to Ultramarinos until this morning is a god damn shame. The outside is pretty nondescript and it's easy to miss. Also, the address on Yelp is wrong (that's the address of sister restaurant Zafras.) It's not on Willow, it's on 3rd between Willow and Park. The place is so tiny and the colorful Latin decor makes it feel authentic and charming. The menu was a lot larger than I expected. My boyfriend and I had the Spanish tortilla sandwich and the Buche (scrambled eggs with tomatos and onions) along with a chicken mole tamale to share which was AMAZING. I also had an iced cafe con leche and it was the perfect ratio of milk to coffee (I hate when it's too milky.)

For about $6/7, you get eggs, chorizo (a decent amount), and their traditional toast. Their toast look like bread sticks with thin cheese inside but lately, it looks like it has been just butter. Cheese was way better. Sometimes on my walks with the dog, I like to stop here to get a cookie & the peanut butter cookie I tried was so thin, crisp, and moist.

My husband and I visited on a Saturday around noon after reading all the awesome reviews about this place.

I mean it wasn't even busy. There were two other tables. And that was it.We finally settled with Cubano and it came with some weird robe inside. The waitress offered a substitution.

This was one of those few times where my experience was completely different from that of other Yelpers, and not in a good way.First of all, they were out of pretty much everything. Three of the things I wanted to order from the menu were not available. It would've been kinda nice if the waitress at least gave us a heads up as she sat us down.In any case, we ordered a few appetizers, some chips, and two sandwiches. For some reason, our main meal came out before the appetizers did. We never got the chips (although she did try to charge us for it at the end). My pork sandwich was delicious. Tender and full of flavor. Unfortunately, on my third or fourth bite, I bit into some kind of weird rope. The waitress explained to me that it was the rope they used to tie the pork while roasting it. Gotcha, but still kinda gross and unexpected. She offered me a replacement, so I ended up going with a ham & cheese sandwich. That turned out terrible. Half of it was cold and was extremely salty.To make matters worse, there was some kinda weird white stuff floating in my water before I even took a sip. I would've understood if it was from the lemon, but here's the thing: there was no lemon involved.",Ultramarinos,4.0 star rating,$$,"Cafes,, Latin, American,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

9,Uun2dxEPQwNT2j-mwlGwRg,Anthony T.,5.0 star rating,"A true find on a cold day in Hoboken, Ultramarinos is a darling of a cafe and serves up a great brunch/lunch spread of foods. From its charming interior to its warm service, I was definitely impressed by Ultramarinos and it all had to offer.I came across Ultramarinos thanks to the lovely reviews of my fellow Yelpers. With no brunch place in mind for a last-minute brunch with friends, I was happy to have found it. I called beforehand and was able to get a reservation for my party of four. To my knowledge (and according to Yelp), they don't do formal reservations, but it seemed like that might not be a hard and fast rule. We were seated at the back of the restaurant, where there's a large table in front of the vintage, wooden fridge door. Around us were a variety of lovely artifacts, unique furniture, and a huge chalk wall extolling the values of chocolate. Ultramarinos occupies a smaller space, with small tables near the front windows enough to seat 4-6 people, a bench-style seating area for 4-6, and the large table in the back for 6-8 people. What surely impressed me was its unique ambience and style, blending shabby/chic with down-to-earth rustic kitchen.Food-wise, I ordered the Creamy Pumpkin soup, the Chicken Mole Tamal, and the Stuffed Piquillo Peppers with Beef. The table also shared the ham croquettes. The food was definitely spot-on. The flavors were intense and fresh, without being overly salty (and the aromas wafting from the kitchen were to die for...my friends and I had such a hard time choosing what we wanted off the menu). I was a big fan of the hearty pumpkin soup, which had a lot of pumpkin flavor and was thick and luscious without being weighed down by the addition of heavy cream. The ham croquettes were also a highlight! Everything for brunch was washed down by a large cup of cafe con leche, which was coffee at its best.Service-wise, there was one one server who was simultaneously taking care of the front counter as well as the tables. Admittedly, things were a bit slow, but my friends and I were happy enough to spend the extra time catching up. But our server was patient with all of our questions, and she was so sweet and attentive despite the Sunday brunch hour. Needless to say, Ultramarinos is a place to check out if you're in Hoboken for brunch or lunch. Larger parties may have to plan carefully, but the cafe is the perfect place for two or even for an individual looking to get some work done (free wifi!). Another tip? A municipal parking garage is located two blocks west on Third Street if you're not keen on circling the streets for a free spot.Overall, quite taken by Ultramarinos and looking to return soon!",Ultramarinos,4.0 star rating,$$,"Cafes,, Latin, American,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I tasted mine and thought, ""I've never had a tamale before this moment."". Tortilla soup was flavorful. I ordered one beef empanada to try but I could easily eat half a dozen of them.

They were a bit dubious about getting food here due to the coffee shop appearance of the establishment, but I insisted.I ordered a hibiscus chiller. They were intrigued and both sampled the tart fuchsia elixir. Two thumbs up - they ordered the same. For food, one gentleman selected the tomato soup and tuna sandwich. The sandwich had enormous chunks of tuna in a light vinaigrette with red peppers and onions on their house made bread. His words, ""the best tuna sandwich I've ever had.""The other gentleman chose empanadas to start and the steak sandwich. He gobbled it all down in 2 seconds flat, then went back for a chocolate eclair which was inhaled before I even got a good look at it. He wrote down the name of the place to bring his wife back, proclaiming how much she will love it. This is a man who lives in Hoboken but refuses to come south of 6th or west of Bloomfield; a major achievement for an eatery to change his uptown ways!I had already eaten lunch, so I went with a chicken mole tamale and a slice of vanilla coconut dulce de leche cake. The tamale was tasty but lacked any kick from the mole. The hot sauce they provided was killer and lifted the dish up a notch. The cake was sticky and moist but not clawingly sweet. I can't speak to the authenticity of the cuisine here, but taste buds don't lie.

94,9B87LZF1WTAwXoKd4xoS_g,laura a.,2.0 star rating,"Feels like a Pottery Barn stage...1 Chef Maricel seem busy enough not to share a smile or a simple ""hi"" to customers waiting to be served. I guess for someone who calls this establishment a ""Latin American food EMPORIUM"" a warm gesture instead of a cold evasion of your presence is a must, I mean obviously she needs enough time to run the emporium. 2 Price - The only item that seems worth the price tag are the artisanal? chocolates. Everything else is extremely overpriced considering that many Bodegas in Hoboken carry similar products. 3 Menu - Are their Item names real? Trying to disguise a more pretentious Zafra-esque cuisine at higer prices must be the reason for such ridiculous over use of words for simple items such as soup. 4 - Mahon & Manchego are not IN cheeses anymore, Hopefully by now most people have tried a good quality Spanish cheese and will rather buy their cheeses from better stocked stores (Whole Foods) Quality - Price ratio is just not working. After 3 years of talking about opening this place, its identity is still to be defined.Pros - it looks cute",Ultramarinos,4.0 star rating,$$,"Cafes,, Latin, American,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

I had walked by so many times thinking I needed to stop in and try it, and finally my fiance and I decided to hit it up on a snow day when we were working from home. First of all, it is so cozy and authentic, with Latin American accents and interesting things to peruse while you're waiting. We pretty much ordered one of almost everything - we started with a chicken tamale (yum!), tortilla soup (delic), and then the warm quinoa salad with asparagus and mushrooms...wowie! My fiance had one of the sandwiches, I think pork, which was to die for. We also ordered the chicken cuban pot pie to try...had to take that one home as obviously we went a lil overboard. We capped it off with 2 cafe con leche's and a venezuelan choco bar. Yummy! The chef came out and delivered the food, which I love. She is so cute and the girl behind the counter was a doll. Headed back today as I type this!",Ultramarinos,4.0 star rating,$$,"Cafes,, Latin, American,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

98,x5AB1EsASBasD_QJmLkcuA,Lindsay C.,4.0 star rating,What a great find! Hoboken seriously needs more places like this. Sometimes you need to change up the sandwich game from the standard Italian deli. Ultramarinos is very cute and the staff is super sweet. Perfect place to stop by for a cheap brunch/lunch. Get the pork sandwich - its DELICIOUS and for $7 you get a sandwich large enough to split. Their desserts are not to be missed either. Great alfajores!,Ultramarinos,4.0 star rating,$$,"Cafes,, Latin, American,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
