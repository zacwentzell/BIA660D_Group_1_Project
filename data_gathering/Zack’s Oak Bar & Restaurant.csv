0,YS76qea53tIuVsnzzczPIg,Jordan L.,4.0 star rating,"Dined here this morning for Brunch, with a 12PM reservation.I highly recommend reservations as this place can get a little tight. With out OpenTable Reservation we got seated right away.Cocktails- Brunch cocktails range between $8-12 each. All handcrafted, and great quality. Downside- For brunch, there are no pitcher options for Mimosas for large groups or for when you just want to enjoy a Sunday Brunch with your girlfriends. After 3 rounds the cocktails add up/FOOD- Amazing! I ordered the Open Faced Egg ($12) and My date ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes ($8). SERVICE-  The restaurant got too packed when a party of 6 walked in and the service staff asked if my date and myself (party of 2) could switch tables so the 6 party could take our large table, and they would give us a free dessert. Highly recommend the Brownie A la Mode. Most certainly will return. My only advice is the cocktails. Offering better options for pricing would make this place a great competitive options for groups, birthday parties, and family brunches. If it is just 2 people then paying per drink is no problem!",Zack’s Oak Bar & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"
1,Ox6NXoHS5rFQ3FA_-oKdaQ,Christina B.,4.0 star rating,"I've been to Zack's twice but about 3-4 years apart. Zack's is an American restaurant offering solid food in a lively environment. Because it's not a large place, reservations are recommended unless you don't mind waiting. Service can be a little slow but moreso at the end of your meal. For cocktails, I got the smoky collins. It was a good balance of classic and unique. For appetizers, we ordered the Mac & cheese and truffle fries. The Mac & cheese was a bit thicker, Shell noodles (definitely recommend) whereas the truffle fries were bland. For an entree, the stuffed chicken was a good balance to the hearty Mac & cheese. As a tip, if you are driving here, you can normally find parking nearby the hospital and bus stop.",Zack’s Oak Bar & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"
2,y_LETSyVwMVKbMSHwHDioQ,Erin A.,3.0 star rating,"Very busy on a Friday evening. Parking wasn't too hard to find shockingly. We had reservations at 7 but the table was still occupied. We were waiting for 2 more but considering we had a reservation I feel like the table should have been ready! The table was free around early 7 but our friends still didn't show up until later on.My other friend and I ordered. I got the Portobello mushroom burger and she got the short rib ravilolli We got prosecco to begin with for drinks. The bartenders were very nice. The Portobello burger was just not good at all. Disappointing since they don't really have many if not any vegetarian/vegan options. My friend liked her short rib a lot. My other friends got the penne vodka which they both really liked.The waitress noticed I didn't finish my food and asked what was wrong. I simple said I don't like it but it was okay. She removed it from the check, which I felt very bad about even though I didn't eat it. I am giving them 4 stars for service and for the food that my friends enjoyed, but I'm going to give them 3 for the lack of options for vegetarians! I liked the environment, though it is a lot smaller than I thought it would be. Would you back for drinks at least.",Zack’s Oak Bar & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"
3,I-cIvsDlNlV1dk3pWCT69w,Esther J.,5.0 star rating,"If would give a 6, if I could! From start to finish, I would say this was an organically comfortably flawless and authentic place. Designed like an old (seemingly pre-war), moderately renovated American bar, this place had a clean charming, holiday wreath entrance, located at a quiet residential corner; however the restaurant was bustling inside as if it were supposed to be in the city -- such a contrast to the neighborhood.They sat us right away, as I made reservations via Yelp's guidance. They had the table nicely prepared. We were able to order wine and appetizer right away. I was very impressed with the appetizers we ordered, especially the al dente mac and cheese and truffle fries! We also ordered spicy calamari which was also delicious. They were decievingly delicious because they came out on a casual plate, generous portions, which only adds to the experience.For main courses, we ordered two NY rib eyes, one gnocchi, one fish tacos, two ribs. I can only speak to the medium steak and gnocchi that I shared. It was probably one of the best steaks I had. Very tender/slightly rare, well cooked and the gorgonzola butter made it all the more savory. It was a perfectly blend of rare and seared/cooked at the outer layers. Side note: Bottle of wine and and dessert were similarly good. The key like pie wasn't overly sweet or sour. Probably one if best key lime pies I've had. Everything was freshly made.Not only was the food good, but while it was packed inside, the service was on point. The waitress was timely, friendly, quickly/succinctly resourceful, and nimble but not overly engaged. My water glass was never empty. She was on point! Not to mention, Wednesday nights have live music.

5,dqwN0pHEVhJpIPmvhZ5uLg,Natalie A.,4.0 star rating,"Such a cute spot in Hoboken. When you step in, you feel like you've stepped into a ski lodge den of some sort. The lights are dim and it has a cozy feel, makes you want to order a glass of wine and get comfortable. It is on the smaller side so recommend reserving a table ahead of time. By 7:30 on a Friday night this place got packed. Even still, this place had a very relaxing vibe. We started off ordering a few appetizers, the burrata, the nachos, and the Truffle fries. The burrata was served over tomato with some bread on the side, really good. The nacho platter was really big and a little hard to eat as all the toppings were literally on top of the bed of nachos and not dispersed throughout. The Truffle fries were pretty good and there was a decent serving. All in all we were very pleased and moved on to entrees. I have been eyeing the calamari on the menu and saw it come out for another table so I subdue this in for my entree and was very satisfied. The waitress recommended a Chipotle aioli sauce and so she brought it on the side, it was delicious! The marinara on the side was also great with the calamari. This hit the spot. My husband got the penne vodka and devoured it, I didn't have the chance to sneak in a bite! So I know it must have been really good! Prices are average for food, the drink prices are a little high but considering the area it isn't awful. I remember the Zacks cocktail clocked in at $12, which I thought was a little too much for what was served.

We received our soup before our cocktails, and finished the soup before the drinks came. We also ordered dinner, my boyfriend ordered a pork chop. He loved it, said it was well cooked and seasoned well. Our waiter was on top of things, just seemed the bar was working slow or potentially they could have used an additional bartender on site.

This is a cozy, classic American bar setup pumping out Italian/American food each evening. The food is good for a bar without being spectacular. Their burger is definitely worth a look, served with a good amount of fries and a whole juicy pickle! The spaghetti meatballs were solid, although I thought the sauce could've had more flavour.

The inside as well kind of vintage. The bar area is great huge selection of alcohol, but was not impressed with the Beer selection. As well as the menu. I'm a huge fan of draft beer and when I look at a menu I like to see how much percentage of alcohol each beer has. Every time you go to a bar and want draft beers there's always going to be different selections and you would always want to know how it's made. I enjoy exploring new beers and connecting with the right taste. The first round of beers were hot not impressed. The bartender by the name of Kieran should have know that beer was not ready to be served. The second beers were much better still not too cold would of loved cold one better bit for some reason we just had a bad experience with the beers. My friend was getting hungry so he order the Bec Burger he loved it. So did I... i had a huge bite from it. The music was bad not impressed Kieran that's playing instruments the whole time I rather listen to jazz music at least or anything else besides instrumentals. The bathroom smelled great single bathrooms. And the atmosphere was great as well. Kieran kept checkin on us making sure we were good. Very good bartender just needs to be clear if something is not ready to be served.

10,5aZX8bTiD0k9vR60SG588Q,Alison C.,4.0 star rating,"When I first moved to Hoboken, the owners of Zack's Oak Bar & Restaurant also had a restaurant on the corner of 11th and Park that I had loved.  Since it closed, I was meaning to try Zack's, but just never made it there.  However, I ran by on a recent Sunday and noticed how packed the spot was for brunch and became further intrigued.  It was then in the forefront of my mind when I was selecting a dinner spot for my friend and I.  She had been there a few times before and was more than happy to go back.  I called to make a reservation for Friday night at 8 pm, but was told that they were fully booked and no longer taking reservations.  We took our chances by walking in and were faced with a completely packed bar and dining room.  The hostess said that she would likely have a table within only 15 minutes, so we decided to wait  As we were just getting settled into the front corner behind some bar patrons, we were told that they could actually seat us immediately.  We were thrilled and quickly met with fantastic service that lasted throughout the meal.My friend inquired about some brews on the beer list, and our server was fully equipped with detailed descriptions of each.  However, I was excited that they had glasses of sparkling Schramsberg Mirabelle Brut Rose at a reasonable price, so we each wound up ordering a glass and set back to relax in the rustic, homey dining room.  Each wooden table was adorned with a rose and a tea light candle, adding to the comforting vibe.  We had decided to skip the appetizer course, so it was a bit sad that they did not provide any bread while we waited.  Despite the extensive daily special list, we both decided to order off their standard menu.  I selected the Pan Seared Cod, which was perfectly cooked through, but could have used some salt and additional pepper.  The accompaniments were an odd mix of roasted butternut squash, julienne snap peas, and then fresh citrus segments.  The combination of the warm and cold, savory and acidic, ingredients just seemed a bit disjointed to me, despite being tasty on their own.  When I had read that the fish would have a chive buerre blanc sauce, I had my concerns of a heavy, buttery drape covering the filet, but there was only the slightest amount of buerre blanc on the top layer of skin, which I typically pull off anyway.  Don't get me wrong, the sauce was creamy and flavorful, but that small amount was perfect for my liking.  My friend enjoyed her large portion of Short Rib with mashed potatoes as well.  We finished this meal by sharing a Brownie ""Sundae"".  I put the style of the dessert in quotes, because it was much more of an a la mode.  The fluffy, cakey brownie was not very rich or quite as fudgy as I like, and it was topped with a scoop of basic vanilla ice cream and a chocolate sauce.   My friend and I both found it just fine, but nothing memorable.Our meal at Zack's Oak Bar & Restaurant was not flawless, but the relaxed atmosphere and fabulous service balanced out the slight execution missteps.  The experience was worthy of a 3.5-star rating that I will round up to 4-stars for Yelp.",Zack’s Oak Bar & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"

We often also get the salads, salmon or turkey burgers and everything always comes out great. Very very consistent. I also really like their wine options. They have some really nice wines by the glass which makes hanging out here over brunch or dinner a great choiceIn the nicer weather they have several outdoor tables.

Their mid-day menu was just ok, there weren't anything spectacular (burgers, smalls and apps). I wish they had a better mid-day menu. The cobb salad was pretty basic. The nachos could have been better constructed, the chili was placed on the bottom and topped with the nachos, which made the nachos a bit soggy. However, the star of the apps were the crab cake, perfectly fried and full of flavor. The aoili with it was magical. The environment was super cute, and the vibe was really homey and I loved it.

54,bhzKTWpqizxt6EBHEjBu4w,Mike G.,1.0 star rating,"After a couple years of frequenting Zack's I feel compelled to leave a 1-star review due to the dumpster fire of a wait and hostess staff that they now have working there. My wife and I just walked out after waiting for a table for over an hour after we were told we could sit at an outdoor table in 5 minutes. After another waitress skipped over our name on the list and sat another couple there, we ended up stuck sitting at the bar with our drinks. Nothing was said to us originally, but I went to check on our ""upcoming"" table and to my surprise another was already sitting there. When I approached the hostess and waitress that told us we could sit there they were totally confused, and told us we would get the very next available table outside. After 20 minutes or so our waitress waved her hand at us across the room. When we got to her she tried to sit us at a table in the back indoor room. We told her we didn't want to sit inside and we were told it could be another hour for an outdoor table. If this was the first time this happened I would understand - everyone makes mistakes. But this is the third time in about 6 months that we have been skipped over for a table at Zack's. We love the food, the owner is always great (unfortunately, he wasn't there tonight), and the bartender is a cool dude - he comped our drinks when we told him what happened. Unfortunately, this was not enough to keep us parked at the bar for another hour. Sorry to say that they have lost a couple of loyal customers due strictly to the service issues we have experienced, not once, but several times. I hope the owner can fix this issue as we would like to come back some day, but by principle it feels wrong to come back here when we feel like the wait and hostess staff doesn't care about regulars.",Zack’s Oak Bar & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"

A rose was placed on every table- sweet and appreciated gesture. Such details shouldn't go unnoticed.A rather large crowd was celebrating a wedding engagement in the inner dining area with heaps of balloons and flash picture taking. I definitely wouldn't recommend this place for such occasions. The place is small and it was a complete eyesore. We quickly ordered drinks and then ordered our entrees. We ordered fish tacos and stuffed chicken. Our waiter told us these were awesome choices. We then asked for a side of sautéed spinach, which wasn't on the menu. He told us how accommodating they are, and agreed to get us that side spinach- much appreciated (and it was delicious!)My fish tacos were a disappointment. While the fish was fresh, it lacked flavor. The stuffed chicken was okay, but nothing to sing about. I left disappointed, recalling the raving reviews on Yelp about this establishment. Perhaps I should be coming here for brunch only. I also wasn't expecting the noise level- holy hell are there really loud/rude/rowdy patrons in here... Wth?? Overgrown children (30s/40s?) from Washington street is how I'd best describe them. Two people were actively making out at the bar- tongue wars just ain't for public view (and I can't blame Zack's for this poor behavior by grown men and women- the heck could they do about it?) Wasn't expecting that from this unassuming, small, cozy looking restaurant/bar- but then again, perhaps we chose the wrong day to visit. I've never been a fan of Hoboken restaurants and I really was hoping that Zack's would be my break in the streak of bad restaurants one after another in this neighborhood...

We made reservations but still had to wait about 30 minutes. The manager or owner was very apologetic about the few delay - it was because a toddler had fallen asleep at the table we were waiting for. Totally ok, but they could have made up for the inconvenience. The wait, however, was worth it... We had appetizers, drinks (try the jalapeño drink!) and entrees, all of which were delicious and reasonably priced... considering we live in NYC and didn't know what to think about this ""bar.""The wait staff was accommodating and speedy, but not annoying asking us every 10 seconds if we needed something. They had a very good sense for when to refill water, etc. One other negative thing would have to be the noise level. The acoustics in the restaurant seem to just reverb voices a touch, making it sound louder than it was. That being said, we were still able to have a comfortable conversation with our friends. Also, a Check in offer would be nice, too - perhaps a glass of house wine or even an app for the table. Chances are, you're spending $40pp anyways!

We arrived and were greeted by a melancholy waitress who seemed indifferent to serving us. No smile or pleasantries. It made us feel uncomfortable. The quinoa bowl while somewhat visually appealing was bland and lacked seasoning. The pear salad was a wilted soggy mess of yellow lettuce and pine nuts with a thin, reasonably tasty chicken breast sliced and lobbed onto the side of the dish. The steak and eggs with mixed sweet and white potatoes tasted like leftovers. The meat was tough and overdone despite my request for medium rare. The redeeming dish was the baked eggs. The tomato sauce and cheese blend with the eggs was flavorful and hearty. The grated cheese sprinkled toasted and buttered baguette was a nice textual contrast to the dish. I wasn't impressed with the mimosas. They tasted cheap and flat. We finished the meal with beverages. a hot chocolate which was sweet, rich, creamy, and topped with a generous amount of whipped cream. The Irish coffee was tasty with a healthy portion of bailey's liquor and more tasty whip cream. However, these two dessert drinks were not enough to redeem this sad excuse for a brunch.

Considering it was Hoboken it was hard to find parking so we got to the place 15 minutes late, but they still held the table for us. At the time it wasn't busy, but it eventually got busy and it was a little hard to hear one another. Also the place is small, but the food was delicious. I had the fried calamari, which was a little spicy  but I didn't mind it because it had great  flavor. Then I had the French cut chicken breast which was amazing, it wasn't dry and the presentation was nice. Dessert was great too, don't remember what I had but it wasn't too sweet and the coffee was fresh. Ordered a bottle of Pinot noir and that was great. Chris, our waiter, was very attentive especially with water. It's really something to appreciate when you don't have to ask for more water, that the staff already know to pour more.

78,iHV_Ef7WMAu6u0XNyZgvJA,Sara M.,4.0 star rating,"Zack's is a cutesy little spot that's tucked away in the very residential Willow Ave. I love how it's off the beaten path (aka not on Washington St) and it's one of my all time favorite dinner date spots. The brunch and dinner menus both sound bomb but I've only ever come in for dinner. Some of my fave menu items are the penne vodka and the stuffed chicken. Yes, Zack's is American New and not Italian, but they make a mean penne vodka. Super rich and creamy, and easily enough for two meals. The stuffed chicken is a signature here- definitely not surprising. The spice sauce is incredible and really brings out the flavor of the chicken and veggies. Although at their core Zack's is a restaurant, the dimly lit space and drink selection give the space a cocktail lounge sort of feel. Their ""perfect"" gin and tonic's name doesn't lie, it's damn good.

I was pleasantly surprised by the pop of flavors here and there using pickled vegetable or ... beer sauce? hm???? If you are a fan of crab cake, you are in for a treat - It was cooked to perfection, slightly crispy on the outside, soft and aromatic center, and the taste? Totally hit the spot.A big family? A big group? Having trouble booking for a table last minute? Well look no further - Zack's was unbelievably accommodating. We called for a table of 7 and then we arrived early, still they were happily making the arrangement (we have tried to call several other places and no-go once they heard the number 7). Just about coming to the end of the meal. one of the party members wrapped a valuable object in napkin and was taken away like trash (our fault) but our waitress retrieved the object for us (from the trash bin??) without any mumbling or complaints at all.

I had a rare tuna special they had once with sundried tomatoes and asparagus on the side and it was absolutely delicious. Another time I had their steak sandwich and to be honest, it was a bit dry and probably could have used some kind of sauce to add a bit more flavor. Not bad, just really average.The cocktails are of similar quality - some really good and some just ok.

The place was very packed and cool looking at first but the food was very disappointing. First we ordered the nachos and they were basically Tostitos with shredded cheese microwaved on and slabs of toppings on top. You could literally peel the cold cheese off and have just chips with the remaining unmelted cheese under it. I ordered a pear and avocado salad which the waitress said was the most popular salad. It was 90% lettuce with almost nothing on it. I think there was about four mini pieces of pear and two avocado slices.My boyfriend got the penne vodka and it was average. Seemed like they took a bad jar of sauce from the grocery store and served it. All in all if I wanted store bought food I would have went to the grocery store.

The place was loud (again small bar in Hoboken).  The waiter was very nice and accommodating. We ordered drinks and our meals. Fish tacos and the stuffed chicken. The waiter seemed to believe we ordered good stuff. I enjoyed both but have I had better meals. Yes. In Hoboken? Questionable. But the food was good not amazing. However when we ordered a side veggie that was not on menu the waiter said anything we wanted he would get. And he did. Again, very accommodating. There were some loud and obnoxious people.

The drinks were great and the food was tasty as well. The food came out incredibly fast-- something I didn't mind at the time but on other nights I might have felt a little rushed. There was a few large parties seated so I can see they were trying to tend to the small tables as fast as they could to focus on those groups. Overall, I think Zack's is a great restaurant.

Zack's is tucked away on the corner of 3rd and Willow, which can help explain the relaxed ambiance inside. The service is always friendly and attentive, albeit a little slow at times. Cocktails like the Vodka Thyme Lemonade and White Sangria are always on point in addition to their collections of whiskeys, bourbons, craft beers and wine. I've had a little bit of everything from their menu and nothing has been shy of great.APPS: The Fried Calamari appetizer has a great kick to it from the cajun seasoning, the Truffle Fries are good (but served with ketchup? Should be with one of the aioli sauces for sure), and the nachos are piled high with flavorful layers of chili, cheese, salsas and all the extra good stuff. ENTREES: The Penne Vodka and Stuffed Chicken are among some of the house specialties. The salads are of substantial size and perfectly dressed; my favorite is with Pear & Avocado with an additional protein. Early in the summer I had a Scallop special, which had asparagus, corn and tomato and it was a perfectly executed summer dish. The Steak n Fries is also a classic, done very well.

This weekend they had a snapper special that I almost didn't order because snapper isn't always my thing... But I am so glad I got to taste that impeccable dish.   I was intrigued by the description - it had chunky tomato basil sauce and fresh corn along with zucchini.  I thought it would be a nice summer-time fish dish.  And yes it was!  The snapper was nicely cooked and had a sear on the outside, but not a HARD sear. The sweetness of the corn and the acidity of the tomatoes worked very well with the sturdiness of the snapper.  I could not stop raving about my dish and liked it so much I didn't let my hubs try it.  Better luck next time hubs.  Other notables from previous experiences:  Stuffed chicken is a really nice dish.  It's not your typical diner or sweet 16 stuffed chicken.

124,yzJ9ZRXgPfNHF9XT3VWrAQ,Sarah C.,4.0 star rating,"I stopped in pretty early last night, and grabbed one of the only empty seats at the bar.  I was greeted quickly with menus but then waited a bit to get a drink order in and bit longer to get a food order in. I realized after sitting there for an hour or two that it's because there is an odd mix of people that are serving the restaurant, the bar, playing hostess, taking to go orders via the phone and walk in's and doing a little bar back...like each of them are doing all of those things? Maybe that helps keep service moving, but I think it also led to a little confusion on who should be helping me. Regardless, everyone was very friendly and since I was at the end of the bar (near what would maybe be a service well in a different restaurant), I got to hear them all talking and working together. Everyone seemed like they were genuinely trying to get people seated in places that wouldn't be crowded and checking on orders, cleaning tables rapidly...so maybe the everyone does everything model works. The bartender started talking to me after the bar cleared out a bit and he was very friendly, making suggestions for my stay in Hoboken and even charged my phone!End my overly long description on that.  The food-- I was debating between the special salad of the evening, prime rib salad and one of their staple salads, the pear and avocado. One of the server/hostess ladies said the pear avocado was delicious so I went with that one, only I subbed the champagne vinaigrette for the goat cheese dressing.  I found the vinaigrette to be a perfect compliment to delicate butter lettuce and subtle flavors of the pear and avocado, I wonder if the goat cheese would be too overpowering... Anyway, great salad. I forgot to order my dressing on the side, but to my surprise it came out perfectly dressed. Like, exactly as I would have done it! I swear everyone wants their salad drowning in dressing, but this was perfect. It is pretty big, but I didn't add protein so it ended up being a perfect size for me.Tuesday's are half price wine, even the house ones, so I had a few glasses of a good pinot grigio for $3.50 each. Yes, $3.50. I'll definitely be back!",Zack’s Oak Bar & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"

128,kw_unRenFD-ModrsLLL2_g,Victoria C.,4.0 star rating,"Food: BWe got the bacon wrapped filet mignon and asparagus as an appetizer and it was delicious. The only thing was that it was a very small dish and it wasn't cheap. There were only two servings, which was fine for us, but if you have more people than that, I'd ask about the servings. For our entrees, we got the Brisket burger and the Willow. Both came with herb fries, which were thin and crispy, just how I like them. The willow was on point too - it was sliced steak with onions and mushrooms on ciabatta. I got mine medium rare, and it was a bitttt on the rare side so it was a little hard to eat in the sandwich. But I would much rather have it on the rare side than over cooked. Overall, the food was awesome and the total cost not bad at all for what we got.Service: BThe service here was great - the waiter was very attentive and super friendly, and the food came very quickly, which was great since we were starving. The waiter was on point, making sure to refill our drinks and ask how our food was and if we needed anything else. However, there was one thing that put me off, not about the waiter but about the host. When he had seated us, he simply put down our menus and said nothing. I noticed later that when he seated others, he told them the specials and made recommendations. I'm not sure whether it was because we looked a bit younger (we are in our early/mid twenties) or whether he had something else against us. He could've been in a rush with my table, but it would have been odd since we came when it was less busy.Ambiance: AThe atmosphere here was nice on a not too packed Wednesday night. It's a small restaurant, but the set up of the tables was just spacious enough that it didn't feel too crowded. Each table had its own (real) rose and (real) lit candle, which was a nice change.

The service is great, the consistency is unbelievable and they have tons of draft beers on tap and great wines.  The best value for your dollar. I probably eat here 4 or 5 times a week with my family. My favorite thing about the restaurant is that the decor,  dark wood, sharp and clean and I believe the bar itself is from the late 1800s.

172,-K79Xep4lElqIChsJYWuiQ,Robbie O.,2.0 star rating,"I give this place two stars 1- for the genuine attempt the new waiter made he didn't know what he was doing and I felt bad no one helped him. 2nd- the place is nice and has a good set up. Otherwise it's not great. Been here about 10times usually for a cocktail. Nothing special it is close to my commute from the bus so it's easy to grab a drink walking home. The bartenders seem to be a little arrogant .. I asked after work one day around 6ish (just moved to area and an obvious new customer in work attire) if there was a happy hour and he laughed and said ""haha no.. Try Washington"" I was pretty taken back. The drinks are all pricey so I guess they dont care. It's not a welcoming feel it seems like the bartenders are career bar keeps and that's fine but they are rude and not happy ever. I bartended for 10yrs it's hard work but was also nice.Anyways went for brunch today. The new waiter took my order. Coffee Bloody Mary and eggs bene with cheese and instead of Canadian bacon which I don't like I ask for well done ham-Taylor ham-or bacon. Well the order came out before the coffee. No cheese with Canadian bacon pretty much rare.. The hollandaise sauce  was also the worst I have ever had .. (Bad batch or something).The waiter said I guess they don't have the other meats u asked for sorry .. I said no cheese also ? He took it back and they put two square out of the wrapper cheese pieces on top and didn't melt it at all .. I took a bite pushed it forward .. Left 30$ and walked away ... Feel bad for the waiter he had no direction. In a good restaurant if food goes back the manager or expo better take the lead and never let it go out like garbage. He was trying hard and was nice but the over all management failed him. Sorry will not be back ... And I'm sure the arrogance that exists will not care at all .. Based on my experiences at this place they only want regulars who are in love with them. It's a shame because it is a nice setup and location. They service management truly lacks tack and or an appreciation for new business or quality of food that goes out.",Zack’s Oak Bar & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"

It also had grill marks on it that definitely wasn't the restaurant which means it is definitely from the distributor and then was boiled or microwaved. So gross. My husband probably had the worse of the two of us when he ordered the Balsamic Chicken which was cubed (again probably boiled) meat in a soup of balsamic vinegar.

223,b4PR5fjq51iBXbVEWq5TpA,Tony K.,4.0 star rating,"I had a good time at Zack's. I would give them a solid 3.5 with a possible extra star potential with a few tweaks. The service was pretty good. It would be nice though if the bus boys didn't have to ask everyone who ordered what-- it should be marked on the ticket or brought out to us by our waiter. Other than this, the waiter was attentive and accommodating. I got 2 appetizers for the table, nachos & calamari. The nachos were fine and so was the calamari but the portions were on the skimpy side for the price. The nachos were shareable but the calamari was for 1 person. I got the brisket blend burger for $14 and it was solid. I would get it again. But I will mention a few downsides. First, the burger was not cooked to order. It was very rare and not medium rare like I ordered. I would probably order medium next time. It was still juicy and delicious.  But it was so juicy that the bottom of bun was soggy when I got it.  Maybe put lettuce on the bottom bun to insulate it from the juice?  The burger with the toppings (cheese, bacon, and roasted tomatoes) was a little big to enjoy everything in one bite. I had to eat with a knife and fork and only portions of each component at a time. It is not date friendly dish either because I was constantly wiping myself with a napkin. And my fries were nubs; I had only a couple of long fries and most were really short that I had to use a fork. Maybe I got the end of the bag? While you could reduce the size of the burger to make it more manageable, at $14 it is getting on the expensive side. Personally, I would reduce the size of the burger but also the $14 price tag. It is also really loud when it gets full. I had a hard time hearing the person next to me. Not much you can do with the acoustics but I have to mention it. Also worth mentioning is the awesome paper towels in the bathroom. I know, I know 'Tony awesome towels?' But they are like cloth. I appreciate a business that spends a little more so the customer feels at home. Some people do notice the little things ;) I will note that most of my constructive criticisms are for Sheila & Mark.  I think both the food and service is very good.  And in the end, I will come again.",Zack’s Oak Bar & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"
224,XT8FMeIw9qcCyl4Q5Adj9Q,Adam B.,2.0 star rating,"Appetizers were really over priced and unappealing. $7 for a french onion soup? We ordered crabmeat dumplings in a five spice dip (?) for $9 which we were really looking forward to. Our best guess is these were purchased from BJs or Trader Joes and most likely microwaved, possibly boiled. For $9 we received 5 small shumai probably about the size of half a thumb. The five spice dipping sauce was described by my partner as water downed soy sauce with chives - definitely no dipping possible, it was just a thin layer of liquid in the bottom of the bowl the shumai sat in, and really just not that good. We ordered a second appetizer to complement this, stuffed sausage and provolone bites. While these tasted ok, again they seemed like they came out of a box from BJs, etc. and the restaurant fried them up and served them with marinara. The marinara tasted like it came out of a can, and was not very good. The bites were ok, except again very small and very expensive for what we ordered. I think it was $9, and again we received five pieces about the size of half my thumb.The entree was good. It seems this restaurant really shines on its main offerings - they are reasonably priced and tasted freshly made and done to order. The other entrees I saw also looked very appetizing.I would go back to Zack's for a good entree - burger and pasta both looked good, and the sense I got was they really focused on entrees but used frozen boxed stuff for the appetizers (except the french onion soup, that looked delicious and filling too). Unfortunately the cost of the appetizers was such a turnoff that it really made the restaurant undesirable. The $9 appetizers were close to horrible in light of the price (for $3, they would have been ok), and really turns you off from enjoying a well done $15 entree.The ambience was good. The service was good. The wine was half price and also good. JUST AVOID THE APPETIZERS!",Zack’s Oak Bar & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"

I've been a loyal customer for 5 years, and have always enjoyed their food and atmosphere. Before today I would have given 4 stars. But today, when we decided to bring our 14mo. old son, we had a very different experience. When we arrived we asked for a highchair, which was no problem. They gave us a table with room, which immediately sends a ""child friendly"" message. Then we asked for a kids menu. No kids menu. Okay. So, I asked if any menu options could be made into kids meals. The waiter said that anything could basically be made for him. I made my selection, and ordered him a ""kids portion of french toast."" The waiter replied ""well, we only have the one size."" Meaning, he could only serve us the regular size portion from the menu with the regular price. I'm not cheap, and I don't mind spending $ on good food. But a 14mo old does not need a full portion of french toast. I asked if it was possible to make him a smaller portion bc he didn't need the full size. ""no"" was the response I got. Great. So I shared mine with him, not a big deal.My issue with Zacks is that Hoboken is a very child friendly town. If you have highchairs, you are saying that it is okay to bring children to your restaurant. If you don't have a kids menu, you should offer kid sized portions or, like other restaurants in town, give a free side of food for the kid. How much could 1/2 slice of bread dipped in egg cost? After all, make the kid happy, keep the parents coming back! (Bin 14 does this and it is incredibly smart!). Anyways, sorry Zacks.

All of our dishes were served with decent potatoes/ sweet potatoes.I ordered eggs benedict, which is often a good test for a chef's attention to details and true culinary skill. Unfortunately, it fell down on several levels. The english muffin was cold and not toasted. The poached eggs were overcooked - not at all the gooeyness that you're looking for. Lastly, the hollendaise (sp?) sauce was just not good at all... bland and rather unpleasant. I actually scrapped the sauce off. My friends got an omelet and the ""special,"" which was an open-faced egg sandwich with arugala and cheddar and kielbasa if my memory serves me correctly. They were both much happier with their dishes, although the kitchen was out of the spicy sauce for the special.Coffee was just okay as well.Decor: 4.75 stars.Comfortable, lovely, clean. Kind of what you'd be looking for when going to brunch with your girls or even having a casual glass of wine after work.Service: 3.5 stars. Friendly and accommodating. I loved that they didn't rush us to order, eat, pay or when we were sitting and chatting. However, it was rather awkward at times and, even though the restaurant was not even half full and there were plenty of tables that were more isolated, they sat people at the table directly next to us - including their children (next to 3 women who were obviously not discussing kid-friendly topics!).",Zack’s Oak Bar & Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"

For dinner my boyfriend had the blended brisket burger which I didn't try but he said it was delicious. I had the Cobb salad and while it was delicious, the presentation left something to be desired. It is served with a chunk of iceberg lettuce topped with cheese, avocado and bacon, half a hard boiled egg on the side, and a piece of grilled chicken on the side as well. I had to cut everything up myself and mix it all together. I felt that was a little strange but the salad was so good that it was worth the work.

It comes with crostini on the outside of the pile of tomato, mixed greens, and goat cheese - all drizzled with balsamic. Quite tasty but an odd presentation. Entrees were consistent. I'm normally wary of ordering pasta at american places like this but my friend had the spicy pasta vodka and it didn't disappoint. Anyone that knows me swears I can't order directly off a menu, and well its mostly true. This waiter was great. I got my classic cob salad - no bacon, no red onion - since I ""do not dine on swine"" and added tomato and carrots - dressing on the side. The order came out exactly the way I wanted it.

But not knowing anything about her taste in food, I opened up Yelp, handed her my laptop and let her fingers do the walking.

So she found Zack's.Hoboken being Hoboken, I stayed in the car with the Dork traversing the neighborhood looking for parking while the rest of them had gone in to be seated. By the time we got there, the calamari and wings were half gone. This is a testament to the parking problem in town and the Dork's paranoia about parking anywhere that might touch a millimeter of a yellow line, not my family's greediness at the dinner table. Not being a wing chic, I can't say anything about them, but the calamari was decent. The menu here is very spartan, as if the management just gave up halfway through. Though I rarely eat red meat, I ended up with the steak. Very salty for me, which is a rarity for me because I rarely complain about things being salty; hence it being a rarity. Of course, I didn't finish it, I never do, so to the Dork it went. Did my cousin have her salad and dessert? Why no she did not, thank you for asking.
