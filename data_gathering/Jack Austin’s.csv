I can't tell which is better, the atmosphere, the people, or the food!  I'll start with the atmosphere... old world pub style, very cool. The very next thing that will jump out at you is how excruciatingly nice everybody is, starting with the bartender, the hostess, waiters, and even the manager came over to say hello. Remember the good old days, when waiters used to linger near your table constantly watching what you're doing like a hawk? Our waiter was Victor and that's all he did.... awesome. Last thing is the food. I had the iceberg wedge salad, the salmon, chicken wings, and nachos.... Everything perfect.

There was three different kinds of cheese and the bacon pieces were thick and huge so its not your ordinary small grilled cheese. It is filling. I upgraded my fries to disco fries since I have never had them before. The fries were suppose to be smothered in gravy, cheese, and bacon. They were pretty good. It could have used more gravy for my taste.

It was good and plentiful.During my second visit I ordered their fish tacos. Tasted ok. They were very small in size (3) and for $18, not worth it imo.Edit: For my third visit I ordered their chicken wings. They tasted good and had 3 dips to choose from.  However, again, 6 wings for $10 seemed a little steep for me.Next day I visited for breakfast, expecting to order something out of their supposed all day breakfast menu. I was immediately told that only a breakfast buffet was available, for $22.50. I knew just by looking at it that it wasn't worth half that, but there was bad weather outside so didn't really have a choice. This ""buffet"" is just your typical extended stay Marriott or Hilton type spread, with perhaps slightly better quality scrambled eggs. For $22.50 I at least expect an omelette station/pancakes/French toast kind of buffet. This only offered 1 waffle make them yourself machine, causing a pretty long wait for those who used it. Oh and um, the first coffee mug I got had lipstick smear on it, and the second cup had old coffee stains on it. When I went to pay I saw that gratuity was included (for a buffet) and I wasn't even brought juice or coffee (100% serve yourself), so I told the hostess. They told me it's included in the $22.50, and indeed it stated so on a sign next to the buffet.2 star rating mostly based on the buffet which to me is worth half that, and for forcing it upon everyone until 10:30am when you could also offer your regular ""all day breakfast"" menu.

There was a lively group there so it was a full atmosphere I found they have a really good happy hour. Half off select drink and apps. I had nachos and a beer. Nachos came out lighting fast.

13,k8ToEsaJuHbT-fGtFhpzKw,Bryan C.,3.0 star rating,Came here for some late night food as this place has bar menu until midnight. It gets a fair amount of people staying in hotel ordering to go.  By ten only can eat at bar. Menu is fairly standard bar fare. I got the Asian ribs and nachos as recommended ribs over the wings by bartender. He was friendly to everyone who came in. Food was average at best as nachos had weird combo of vegetables needed to chop up yourself to create a Salsa. Beans on bottom of plate looked like ones can get out of can. Ribs were made with good piece of meat but flavor was off and not quite fall off the bone enough for me.  Bar does have nice small craft beer selection.Might come back for happy hour but unless starving will avoid non happy hour food.,Jack Austin’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"

I was yelling to talk the whole time I was there. The food ordered was pretty good and filling. I didn't think it would be since I ordered an appetizer and Flatbread but I was stuffed. The Baja fish tacos my friend recommended were delish..sweet and tangy, nice crisp from the cabbage and veggies, soft tasty Mahi mahi. The corn tortillas were a nice touch, I like it better than flour.  The mushroom Flatbread was fluffy, cheesy, and the truffle oil was on point. Loved the flavor and it's also topped with arugula. My friend ordered a grilled cheese which was definitely order worthy. They use Japanese milk break which is that really thick fluffy buttery  Japanese sliced bread. ..another plus choice!  The waitor was very attentive at first when I was waiting for my friend to arrive but afterwards not so much.  And then all of a sudden he started coming by alot asking if we were done yet and another waitor as well,  but we still had alot of food in front of us.  Also I don't like when restaurants keep my change from the check as a tip..that money should be given back for the customer to then leave a tip on the table.

They use Japanese milk break which is that really thick fluffy buttery  Japanese sliced bread. ..another plus choice!  The waitor was very attentive at first when I was waiting for my friend to arrive but afterwards not so much.  And then all of a sudden he started coming by alot asking if we were done yet and another waitor as well,  but we still had alot of food in front of us.  Also I don't like when restaurants keep my change from the check as a tip..that money should be given back for the customer to then leave a tip on the table. I found that kind of rude. On a whole,  service could improve, they just need to tweak little things here and there.",Jack Austin’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"

I suppose this is due to having two choices in the area. On this particular instance I was brought the wrong food, which was innocent enough... However the true issue arose when I informed the server and instead of replying with the expected response of ""no problem, let me take care of that for you"" - he instead had a rebuttal of insisting that I ordered something different. I mean, I received an egg sandwich instead of a burger... i then reminded him that I had ordered my burger medium - again he responded ""no, you ordered your egg sandwich medium"" (signaling to an over easy egg)...The manager made it all right in the end and was overly apologetic; however, this sort of behavior is restaurant etiquette 101 and the experience (and food) have failed to improve over the last couple of months.",Jack Austin’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"

I am pleased say that on that particular evening good ol Jack hit it out of the park. Everything I had was what I was expecting. For appetizers we decide to have the Cubanitos and sweet cornbread.  The Cubanitos are a wonderful concoction of Spanish flavors sandwiched between a small burger bun.  It's a tiny sandwich that truly packs giant flavors. The sweet cornbread which has a distinct honey taste made the appetizer a sweet and salty experience for the senses.  It was like eating a chocolate covered pretzel without the chocolate or pretzel.  Okay that doesn't make sense but it does to me.  Next I ordered the sinfully delicious breakfast burger.  An 8 oz patty with cheddar, egg, and taylor ham secured on an English muffin bun.  I'll give you a second to read that again people...okay you back.  I didn't think you'd make it back.  I almost didn't after eating that burger.  That should seriously be deemed illegal.  I would call it breakfast burger prohibition.  My sister ordered the fried chicken burger and my nephew challenged the Jack Austin signature burger.  The video of him trying to take the first bite but unable to open his mouth large enough is one of the funniest things I've seen.  With a side of fries and onion rings to add to the gluttony, my entree at Jack Austin's was to die for...literally!As if the cherry on top of the cake, we sampled all four desserts on Jack's menu.  I don't know how they found out but the awesome people there came out with the dessert and a gigantic sparkler on top of one of the desserts.  The staff greeted me happy birthday and really made the night special.  One of the staff member told me that I was the first to have that sparkler and they are going to start utilizing it now.  I felt even more special.After my sister and I destroyed the dessert, we took our left-over entrees that could not fit into our stomach home.  My sister, who is very picky with what she eats and maintains her figure, said she must have had 10k calories that night and she said it was all worth it!",Jack Austin’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"

ON a Sunday afternoon, it was pretty empty in here, but there was only a hostess and the bartender at first. The bartender became our server. It wasnt terrible service, but i think it lagged a bit due to the fact that there was no one here to serve the few tables that had people at them.We stuck with only food because the beer selection is small and a bit pricy for the beers--$6 to $8. also mixed drinks are around $12.However, the food was great. Key things we liked were the fish tacos. three filling, mahi mahi tacos really hit the spot. they were filling, but light. the mushroom and argula pizza is a must get. you can share it with someone else, theres alot of argula on it, i wouldnt mind more mushrooms. as far as an entree, myself and my friend shared a turkey burger with fries. i have never had a turkey burger so i was willing to try it--and we both really liked it.  great flavor, juicy, and large portion.",Jack Austin’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"

It's convenient to the ferry (for after work drinks) and really close to our apartment (good for a short walk to dinner). After a very successful Yelp event with plenty of food, good drinks, and lively staff...I was looking forward to coming back.Armed with a buy one/get one coupon (courtesy of the Yelp event), we came in for dinner around 6:45pm on a Wednesday. It is currently 8:41pm...and we just walked in the door.The food...was good at the Yelp event. Tonight...it missed the mark, for the most part. The fish tacos (app) were all taco and no fish, and the fried chicken (app) white meat pieces were good, while the dark meat ones were definitely overdone. We chose the breakfast burger with quail egg (served on a butcher's block, cool touch) and the chicken & waffles for dinner; both were absolute hits at the event. The burger was kinda overcooked (medium well, not medium rare) and while the waffles were actually really good, the fried chicken was way too much skin and overly oily (but good once I got past that). Nothing that was a deal breaker, but definitely noticeably different than the first time.The thing that got us was how long this all took. The restaurant wasn't more than half full, but it took us 30 minutes to get apps and another 30 to get dinner. We ordered apps first, planning on ordering our meal when they came. We finished our apps and still hadn't ordered (they were delivered by someone different that ran away too quickly), I had to flag our waiter down. He spent a lot of time wandering around, and almost as much time standing by the front door, staring into space. Was there something on the ceiling? I checked...nope. Whenever we actually needed something, he almost never looked in our direction. By the end of the meal it was mildly comical, but, in general...very odd. There were a lot of different people working here, but we never had a lot of company at our table. When we did...they seemed to disappear into the abyss. I think my expectations were set pretty high after our Yelp event, which probably explains the disappointment. Maybe things like this will get worked out over time, but until then...we'll see.",Jack Austin’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"

The vegetables were soggy and too salty and the brown rice and quinoa was wet and overdone. The person I had dinner with had a similar experience.

There may have been 2 oz of fish on three little tacos, (if I was lucky), and no sides whatsoever. My boyfriend, however, got one of their special burgers with onion jam, bacon, Gruyere, etc. and that was FANTASTIC! Some of the best hickory smoked bacon I've ever tasted. We tried two of the specialty cocktails and they were tasty, but not worth the price. Very little alcohol and not entirely representative of the description on the drink menu. I think you're better off ordering you're own beverage of choice. IMO, this place is good for high-end burgers and meat, but I would be a bit more cautious ordering lighter items like fish, etc.  Again, the tacos weren't bad, but there was VERY little food there for an entree and they were just average.",Jack Austin’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"

Beyond that, dinner in Weehawken is limited. Enter Jack Austin's, Weehawken's first 'farm-to-'table' concept restaurant that's making its introduction to the waterfront. Replacing the old Messina, Jack Austin's fresh, eclectic menu is trying to overtake the stuffy mindset of The Chart House and the chain-happy small plates of Houlihan's - and boy, does it succeed.First, let me be real for a moment: I have't read any of the other reviews. I'm going solely based off my own experiences. Moving on...The restaurant is completely updated on the inside. The dining room, which was once overdone with wide, open spaces, now boasts comfy booths, dark wood accents, and warm lightning. A center bar is surrounded by the restaurant's tables, so it's easy to go from dinner to drinks if you wanted to make the switch.Glancing at the menu, I have to admit it's an interesting mix of items, but somehow, it works. Being we were only two people, we only got to sample a few of the items, but I'm willing to bet the rest of the menu tastes just as good.We selected the cornbread and tempura green beans as apps - both were beyond excellent and gave us a good indication of the style of cooking. The cornbread (which was shaped like corn) came with a side of homemade honey butter and was served warm, and the green beans were absolutely light, crispy, and delicious. For entrees, my father opted for the Jack's Burger and I for the turkey burger. My only real criticism is the seasoning of the turkey burger - the patty was beyond salty for my taste, and it took away from the fresh veggies and yogurt sauce that came with the patty. But the fries and the homemade pickle made up for the burger. Oh, and by the way, if you order a burger, it comes served on a butcher block.The service was absolutely excellent. We were treated like royalty by Melissa, our server, and Katie, the manager-on-duty. Both ladies took the time to make us feel special and welcomed. When wrapping up my leftovers, apparently the bun and veggies fell off my burger, so Melissa wrapped the leftovers with a fresh bun and veggies. It's those little touches that make you want to return, other than the food of course.This place is sort of like a hidden gem. We happened to catch the signage coming from Hoboken, and that's how we got to eat here. Truth to be told, if you're looking for a place to eat on the Waterfront, you're a fool if you don't consider Jack Austin's.

The food (other than said awesome stew) was really buttery and rich. The mushroom flatbread was pretty middle of the road. And the service was slooooooow. Like it took us 15 mins to get our carrot cake dessert slow. The carrot cake was more like a carrot muffin with Philadelphia cream cheese slapped on top. Maybe they had to run to the bodega to pick up the cheese?I also found it massively annoying that the happy hour menu was only for the bar. And not just the bar area... Sitting at the actual bar or no dice. We sat at a bar booth and apparently that didn't qualify for the happy hour specials. Only the 8 bar seats get to have happy hour.... Does standing qualify? What about leaning on the bar? These kinds of bad customer service details just annoy customers into not wanting to come back. I might get desperate one night and give it one more try.

73,uMkx85FJ8vN8o4yF4xgq6w,Rocco R.,4.0 star rating,Nice place with a cool ambiance. We had a problem with our order but the manager named Katy came over to our table and made sure we were completely satisfied. She made our experience so much better!! The waiter was also very nice. Thank you!!!,Jack Austin’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"
74,5aqFOEXfwCCmj2PhJZxk4Q,Liz H.,3.0 star rating,Limited menu and pricey for the quality of food. Ordered a Cobb salad with chicken but ended up with a version of the salad that wasn't what the menu deceived. Chicken was incredibly dry. Short rip chili tastes just like Cincinnati chili.,Jack Austin’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"

76,EnPWDVpR8CqiSRCgy9HAyw,Victoria B.,1.0 star rating,"Not only was there horrible service, the food was horrendous (chicken sandwich and turkey avacado R club), the drinks (watermelon margarita) tasted like mildew and wheat grass but there was a HAIR in my food. Not ordering another meal (obviously) I had asked the waitress to take the club off the bill. She didn't have the decency to take my horrendous drink off as well as normal restaurants with ""on the house"" standards would have done. Side note: there was only 3 other people in the restaurant. That's saying something. Do NOT go here, every table had a complaint.",Jack Austin’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"
77,e3QhouhdGag-fy9rWMMf9w,Crystal P.,1.0 star rating,"The food is awful! No one in my group enjoyed their food. Service was good. Tomato soup tasted like tomato paste. Nachos my husband got for appetizer were stale and I'm not exactly sure how they were flavoring the chicken but it didn't work. Skip this place unless maybe you are wasted and starving, then you may not notice how bad the food tastes!",Jack Austin’s,3.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Bars"
