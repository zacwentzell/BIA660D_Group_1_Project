It's a cheese burger with fries, chicken tenders with fries or a chicken tender sandwich for about $5 which isn't bad considering you can pay about $8 on Washington. They have tons of options on their menus but of course, it's a ton of different wraps. I'm sure they'll have one that will suit your taste buds and fill you up. They have breakfast, soups/salads, subs/hoagies/heros (depending where you're from) to choose from. I tend to call ahead if I know what I'm wanting and pick it up in about 15 minutes cause it's usually after physical therapy and it's bagged and ready to take a drive around town to be eaten but if you don't, you're gonna be in there for 10 minutes just looking at their menu boards figuring what you'd want to devour or try.",Mr Wraps,3.5 star rating,$,"American, (New)"

All we wanted was a really good wraps and a salad. Mr. Wraps. Every single thing we ordered was warm and was soggy and warm including the ""fresh house salad"". Clearly is was put under all of the hot food we ordered for at least an hour. I asked specifically for no onions on the salad and not only was covered in an entire chopped onion, they were warm and wilted all the lettuce. Maybe they misheard me and thought I said to put all the onions they had left in the kitchen. My husband literally thought I must have ordered an onion salad with a touch of lettuce. I should have known from the phone call with the unfriendly woman that they would disregard every request I made, not one of the things I asked for on the side actually came on the side. It was incredibly slow delivery and I highly suggest ordering from anywhere else but here. We were starving when we ordered and the food was barely edible and was so gross we completely lost our appetite. The only good thing about Mr. Wraps are the prices, at least in the end we didn't waste a ton of money.  We order pretty much every night and I love wraps, this was by far the worst buffalo chicken wrap I have ever had.

I love the buffalo chicken 'pita pizza'. It is a perfect size to share, and it is super thin because it is on a huge pita. Their turkey clubs, BLT's, breakfast options, and the salads are a true favorites of mine. The cobb salad is reasonably healthy despite the large pieces of bacon and cheese. But the salads are HUGE.

I immediately liked the setup of this predominately takeout lunch spot. The menu was neatly displayed in fun, but legible writing on giant boards above the cash register. Though there were many options written down, I found the boards eased my decision-making process (which is usually slow, and painful for cashiers whom I inflict it upon).I ordered #2 - the South West Wrap. It came with chicken, salsa, beans, avocados, and cheese inside. I was very happy with my choice, and surprised they didn't skimp on the avocado. The only thing that could have been improved was the chicken- it was a little dry. Other than that the wrap was very good and the portion size was large; which was kind of nice because I could only eat half and saved the rest for dinner. Mr. Wraps offers a good deal, and a lot of food at a reasonable price. I would definitely recommend it for a fast lunch or dinner.",Mr Wraps,3.5 star rating,$,"American, (New)"

With combinations you don't see everywhere, such as pulled pork and mashed potatoes, or BBQ chicken, rice and sour cream, you are guaranteed to find something amazing.

Well that's not Mr. Wraps at all. They've got a LOT of choices, but all compliment each other very very well. The prices are a bit high until you actually get the food and realize the portions are LARGE!! Cons: The staff (two brothers who are owners) just simply have no personality. In fact, I may go so far as to say they seem slightly annoyed by having customers. If the owners hired some great front of house employees, and kept themselves in back, this place gets five stars. Also, avoid the salads. They're very good, but overpriced in my opinion.EDIT: 5-14-12 I may have gone in on a bad day. I was there again today and the Brothers seemed much more pleasant.

I found that to be expensive for a wrap joint. * Dirty: Bathroom is DISGUSTING. In fact, the whole place is rather filthy. Fortunately for me, I could not see the kitchen where my wrap was being built. Guessing it is also filthy. *Takes AGES.. I waited 20 minutes for a meatless, cold wrap.

I had it last August and I fell in love. My experience in eating this wrap is like a catch-22: I wanna devour the wrap because I know how yummy it is, but I never want it to end! Their buffalo sauce is probably the best I've had for their caliber of food (quality is comparable to an Applebee's or Houlihan's wrap).If you're looking for a cheap delicious eat, I would highly recommend this place because for your money you get a good amount of food and I wouldn't steer any Yelpers wrong :).",Mr Wraps,3.5 star rating,$,"American, (New)"

I usually order the Taco Wrap, the Grilled Steak Wrap, or the Park Classic Wrap. All are solid choices but nothing that knocks your socks off. The creamy red bliss potatoes, however, are amazing. Definitely recommend a side order of those.I would strongly advise against ordering the tortilla pizzas.

The chicken is dry dry dry and has a sweet taste to it like it was originally a sweet BBQ that they just threw in to make the chicken parm. Sauce is bland, and there isn't enough seasoning or salt.

92,DOny_M6Xc_954y9-D2y9mQ,Justin E.,3.0 star rating,"There has been one restaurant that has been hyped up ever since I've come to Stevens. For those that don't know the terminology, hype is defined by Dictionary.com as ""exaggerated publicity; hoopla."" Similarly, the word on the street as defined by Urbandictionary.com says that it is ""when someone gets excited about something"" as shown with the appropriate context sentence ""Damn, you hype. Calm down homey."" Now that the lesson in street talk is over, Mr Wraps in some circles is one of the most commonly suggested places to grab a bite in town, which is why I was surprised to see that it was never reviewed by the Stute. That's why this week I decided to give Mr Wraps their shot at newspaper notoriety. Mr Wraps is located a couple blocks off Washington St at the corner of 8th and Garden. Not only is their close proximity to Stevens one of the reasons it is a popular spot for students, but also because their total meal price is below $10 and they take our campus currency, Duckbills. About the size of an average deli, Mr Wraps has a few tables inside and some space outside to enjoy your meal. I called in my order at noon on a Wednesday as was told about 20 minutes for 5 wraps, which during lunchtime isn't too bad. After a quick cup of Mario Kart Wii (it has been my apartments unholy addiction of late), we huffed it a few blocks in the sweltering heat to get our food. At an average price of $8 for a wrap, I decided to treat my roommates out to lunch and get a variety of wraps. The first wrap that caught my eye was the one named after our very own institution. The Steven's Grilled Steak Wrap was loaded with steak, creamy potatoes, mozzarella cheese and gravy. Whether you take that as an appropriate representation of our school is up to you, but if one thing is for certain, the Stevens had more steak than a Texas cook out. Next, I got what I felt is a commonly ordered wrap, the Buffalo Chicken. The chicken tenders were moist and just a hint crunchy; however, the massive amount of buffalo sauce and ranch dressing made the lettuce and tomato quite soggy. I was able to forgive the deluge of sauce thanks to the extra zip I tasted in the wrap. My vegetarian roommate tried the Hoboken Veggie Wrap which was a combination of grilled portabella mushrooms, zucchini, yellow squash, tomatoes, roasted peppers and rice. Clearly the most vibrant looking of the wraps, it was very satisfying in his opinion. My other roommate found the wrap on the menu named after him, the Sloppy Joe, and enjoyed the roast beef, Swiss cheese, coleslaw and Russian dressing. Finally, my last roommate was the only one left unsatisfied with hisr Tuna Melt Wrap which was white tuna with romaine lettuce, avocado, tomatoes, and Swiss cheese. Apparently, there was more lettuce than tuna, which took away from the tuna flavor, but overall we had positive remarks on the meal. Offering over 33 different wraps and a well rounded menu of subs, salads, grilled entrees, and more, it is easy to see why Mr Wraps is a hot lunch spot with their ability to have something for everyone on your list. Trying to satisfy a vegetarian, a pseudo vegetarian, and Joe can sometimes be more difficult finding a spot in the 6th St parking lot, but was pretty easy thanks to the diverse menu. Side Note: If you think you're good at Mario Kart, beat me and my roommates and I'll treat you out to the next review. Go big or go home. Bottom Line: Got a group of indecisive friends looking for a quick bite, no place better than Mr. Wraps.",Mr Wraps,3.5 star rating,$,"American, (New)"
