1,9fysS2MW7J5SvB9MZ7p6dg,Shaji K.,3.0 star rating,"Bar area is understandably crowded on a Friday night, however was able to get a table without much issue. Dimly lit yet not too loud inside, making it easy to carry a conversation. Got seated and was immediately given a menu and tap water.Expensive dishes - which is a given considering the area. Ordered the Shepherd's Pie ($18), Soda Bread ($4.50), and a pint of beer ($8). The shepherd's pie has a fluffy mashed potato top and meaty interior. Personally like the mashed potatoes to be more crisp, and I wished there was more cheese to compliment the hearty meat. Side salad it comes with is negligible. Soda bread is dense, and served with a big square of Irish butter. Goes very well with the stew inside the pie (butter is a bit too hard to spread).Like the ambiance and service; food is pricey for what it is. Bar menu looks interesting.",Hudson Hound,4.5 star rating,$$,"Irish, Pub,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

It's got a pub feeling, and the six of us were able to sit down in the back almost immediately, but the experience was just a-ok.Drinks are around $13-16 (expected) and I got the cucumber cosmo, which had a refreshing cucumber twist, but was very strong. Not the bartenders fault, but after a long day of drinking in the sun, I should have gone for something else! The drink menu is pretty large, and they have every kind of drink you could want. I ended up getting the chicken fingers for $8 and a side of fries for $7. Now, I know this is the west side, but $7 for a small side of average french fries is pretty ridiculous. The chicken fingers were also pretty small, and forgettable. One of my friends got the loaded fries and seemed to like them, so I think maybe I'll get those if I come back. The rest of the the place was ebbing and flowing with people, but wasn't TOO crowded, which I thought was kinda nice, especially when you don't have to wait to use the restroom. I could also tell that our waiter was being pulled in all directions, but he still a good job of taking care of us, and even let us split our checks, which NEVER happens in NYC. Great customer service.Overall, I think this place would be great to after-work drinks or happy hour with a fun, relaxed atmosphere, but the food misses the mark for me.

The hudson hound was our last second spot while heading to the Lincoln Tunnel from Brooklyn- along the bay we decided to park where parking was available beside the road and we walked two blocks up the street to the Hudson Hound. The breakfast restaurants were packed as we passed them to get to the hound, the hound had recently opened and was relatively empty- which was awesome for us, since we were in no mood to wait around. We were seated quickly at the outside tables. My party ordered French Toast, Goat Cheese and Spinach Omelette, and Eggs benedict with smoked salmon.

Decently-sized, cooked to the right temperature, and good amount of fries. Can't complain about that. I have a feeling though that they should probably just have one big bar area with some seating for dining, because sometimes it tends to be much busier on the bar side than on the restaurant side. For the most part, I would recommend sticking to beer, since the selection is pretty great, and the cocktails, while strong, are not worth the $12.

We easily found seats at the bar around 6 pm but by 6:45, it was considerably busier. We put our name in for a table for four, and I loved how communicative the staff was in letting us know when our table would be ready so we had a better idea of whether to get another drink at the bar or pay the tab. We had the smoked haddock, fried pickle spears, and Irish soda bread as appetizers, all of which were good. The highlight of the meal was most definitely my entrée:  1/2 a rotisserie chicken with French fries, roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and grilled corn. The skin on the chicken was so crispy and flavorful, and though I didn't eat much of the gravy, I loved dipping the fries in the green chimichurri sauce that accompanied the chicken.

We easily found seats at the bar around 6 pm but by 6:45, it was considerably busier. We put our name in for a table for four, and I loved how communicative the staff was in letting us know when our table would be ready so we had a better idea of whether to get another drink at the bar or pay the tab. We had the smoked haddock, fried pickle spears, and Irish soda bread as appetizers, all of which were good. The highlight of the meal was most definitely my entrée:  1/2 a rotisserie chicken with French fries, roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and grilled corn. The skin on the chicken was so crispy and flavorful, and though I didn't eat much of the gravy, I loved dipping the fries in the green chimichurri sauce that accompanied the chicken. I would highly, highly recommend the rotisserie chicken. Though others at my table were happy with their meals (mussels and burgers), everyone was envious of mine.",Hudson Hound,4.5 star rating,$$,"Irish, Pub,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

So juicy and literally melted in my mouth. I splurged and paid extra for the bacon and it was great. Kind of pricey, but if you're willing to pay a few extra bucks for a good burger, I'd def stop here. The atmosphere is fun too - the inside is dark and I felt cozy in the booth, sitting across from the bar.

We went on a frigid winter Sunday for brunch.My friend thought to introduce me to something in the West Village below 17th Street.  The wood interior with tables and banquette lends to the pub like atmosphere but it was over loud like some pub like places.We had a seat at the large comfy booth. Our server quickly greeted and handed us the menu. They had the usual suspects for brunch but what I eyed was the Fish and Chips and my friend got his usual when he comes here. The Full Irish breakfast and two Bloody Mary to start.The fish came in a nice batter that was light and crispy, not oily at all and the fries were the same. Maybe I was use to the big slab of cod that would come out but here the fish looked like it was a bit hacked and two smallish pieces that kinda looked like scraps.  My friend's Irish breakfast looked pretty good with brown bits that we had to look at the menu to figure out what it was but either way it happily satisfied him.The bright place was a good brunch place. Overall, a good pick. I'd probably be a little happier if my fish didn't look like table scraps but it was cooked well and the meal was good. We were both happy but unhappy we had to face the cold again.",Hudson Hound,4.5 star rating,$$,"Irish, Pub,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

The general vibe he gave was that we were slacker employees and he was our disapproving boss who had to keep chastising us to do our work.  These things were annoying enough to stop me from returning.  Too many excellent choices with equally good or better food and less obnoxious intrusive service.",Hudson Hound,4.5 star rating,$$,"Irish, Pub,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Two dollars off drafts and select 8 dollar cocktails. We each had a couple of the champagne sangrias which were tangy, fruity and delicious. The space has two sides. One that is set up as a bar, and the other which is a dining room. We just came in to catch up over drinks, but the menu sounded great and I'd definitely return for some eating as well.

The bar and the restaurant area might as well be two completely different places. The menu is sort of British inspired pub food. My friends and I sat in the restaurant side of this establishment. When we got there at 6:30ish, there were a lot of families with young children there, but that changed as the night went on. There is a large drink menu and there were a couple of specials for 2 cocktails but that's it. I ordered a Rose, which was alright but highly highly marked up (as restaurants do). Unfortunately, about an hour after eating dinner and having a glass of wine, I got a headache. Good wine this was not. There was nothing but sides on the menu for a vegetarian, so I ordered a few of those. However, the ""daily market vegetable"" ended up having bacon in it (even though that was not described to me when I asked). Everyone else I was with seemed fairly pleased with their choices so perhaps my experience was a one off. When walking to the bathroom, I had to enter the bar and was greeted with a cacophony of totally wasted just out of college aged people of the finance variety from what I could tell. I took a step back into the more calm restaurant, then back into the loud bar, then back in the low key restaurant, then back into the outrageous bar scene that looked like it was a choreographed scene from a movie. It was such an odd juxtaposition. I wasn't super impressed with this place and probably wouldn't come back.",Hudson Hound,4.5 star rating,$$,"Irish, Pub,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
