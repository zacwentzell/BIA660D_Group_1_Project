We did try to get a drink at the bar and the bartender dropped my friends credit card then yelled at her and wouldn't serve her after he couldn't find the card he dropped. The other bartender was so drunk that she couldn't even serve drinks and she was flashing her nipples.

It was so gross.When we decided to leave, the coat check ""line"" was a disaster of people telling that they didn't get their coats. The bouncers tried to step in but made it worse and started throwing people around. Wouldn't be surprised if someone sued.

6,ax-xNOrrVug61-5e0RGqDA,Miguel C.,1.0 star rating,"If you're coming here for brunch or food in general, don't bother.My friend and I were looking for a new place to try outside of our usual LES East Village stomping grounds. I figured the West Village would be a nice change of page. Yelp recommended Common Ground as it's first result and I thought it looked marvelous. Space looks awesome and it seemed as though it was still young, so off we went.We get there and the entire place is empty. That's not totally unexpected or a bad thing. I figured, it's already 4pm so the brunch crowd is out of here and folks are probably at home getting ready for Monday or if they are out, they're likely holiday shopping. The place is as nice as the pictures make it look. The staff is friendly, though I think it's easier to be friendly and accommodating when you're literally the only non-employees in the place.I order a BLT and my friend orders an appetizer and two entrees off the brunch menu. I'm surprised they're still serving brunch at 4pm, but they were and it was the only thing you could order. I had a very nice rum drink and my friend had a bloody mary. Both were good.Fast forward a bit and we realize, it's been a while--a long while and we haven't gotten our food. We were hoping that perhaps in the absence of much to do (the three primary staff members were socializing behind the bar) that they forgot to grab our food. We mention it to the staff and one gentlemen looks at the screen, gives a small muffled gasp, while the another staff member says, ""I'll take care of it"" then runs to the kitchen. Is it possible they just forgot to put in our food? Honestly don't know, but that's our hunch. After waiting a while to get an update on the food, we decide to cut our losses and leave. We never got an update on the food so we weren't exactly hopeful the food itself would ever come.I really really wanted to like this place so I ask the guy, ""What happened just now?"" hoping he could at least give me an excuse for what got us to this point. He couldn't. He said they were a busy club and were trying to get folks in for food service and they were still slow. But I don't really care about when they're busy or what their business plan is, what I care about is why we never got food or even an update on the food when we're literally the only folks in there. It's odd, it's bizarre. Our bartender charged us for everything besides the food we didn't get and seemed satisfied to see us leave.One would think if you're trying to improve your business to stretch beyond what it already does, you'd do some things to incentivize people to come, to stay, to come back. One would have been to provide an adequate, or even any reason for the lack of food we received. Another would have been to provide some incentive for a latter visit.
