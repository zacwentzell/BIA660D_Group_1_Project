Also, 8 dumplings for $5.95 is a few bucks cheaper than other places I get them from. The Mapo tofu is on the soupier side (and slightly more oily) than I'm used to, but not to the point of being unpleasant.

You really don't want to see me when i'm hangry! Strike 2: No hot sauce, no sauce for the steamed dumplings, and no sauce for the crab rangoonStrike 3: Friend ordered the egg drop with wonton soup and after one slurp, I have to say it's the worst I've ever had.  Just looking at it, the color is this insane bright yellow and doesn't even look like a typical egg drop soup. It also tastes like they flavored it with beef bouillon cubes.  Strike 4: (Yup I went there)  The container that an order of beef chow fun comes in is visibly smaller than the ones other Chinese restaurants use which is incredibly disappointing for the cost of almost $10.  AND the beef chow fun is drowning in oil.  I literally had to pour some oil out to eat it. Gross!Why even give it a star?  Because their hot and sour soup is actually decent!! It was hearty with different types of mushrooms and veggies and the spice was on point.  Since my friend ordered the crab rangoon I had one also, and it's alright.  I never order those so still this place does not pass the test.FAIL!",King Szechuan Palace,3.5 star rating,$$,Szechuan

After reading many good reviews I think I have found my new go to place for Chinese. We ordered several appetizers, scallion pancakes based on the reviews, boneless spare ribs and steamed dumplings. Since it was a cold night we also added a large Wonton soup.  For entrees, I went with the General Tso's Shrimp and the wife had the ginger pineapple chicken with garlic sauce. They allow you to choose the amount of heat you want on a scale of one to ten. For mine we went with a 2 and the wife's a 4. Both entrees were very tasty and had just the right amount of heat. I really liked the pineapple in my wife's dish it soaked up a lot of the garlic flavoring. It wasn't overpowering. The scallion pancakes are as good as the reviews say. And I am a big fan of the boneless spare ribs.  The delivery time was 45 to 60 minutes but we got our food on about 30 minutes which I really appreciated.

56,gjQvWPOi-FEhN35YPnB7Pg,Barbara M.,1.0 star rating,"Had a very bad experience with an order of so called boneless spare ribs.  I wasn't certain what the food stuff was that was delivered to me. When I opened the container there were ribbons of grissled and and burnt, 2 inch size pieces of heavily red coated ""pork"".  I was repulsed by the smell,  appearance and taste.  I immediately called to confirm if I had gotten the right food. The young man who answered the phone who identified himself not as the owner, stated that this particular food was a very popular item and there was nothing wrong with it. I insisted that he take the food back and give me a refund and he had very little sympathy for my request. I was very upset by this as I was enjoying ordering from their restaurant at least on a weekly basis sometimes more and the fact that I was a steady customer did not seem to make a difference to him. So as of today I'm no longer going to patronize this establishment for the failure to respond to my dissatisfaction with a foul and unappetizing food.What a shame because heretofore I really enjoyed this service and the other various  dishes on the menu.Tonight was the last time.

I mentioned their terrible service in my original review, but tonight ""terrible service"" was taken to an entirely new level.First of all, they screwed up our order. Not only did they give us two incorrect items, but they left one item out completely. When we called to rectify, the lady insisted that that was what we ordered. In fact, she said that we would have to pay more in order for her to give us the correct items. Obviously this wasn't going to happen. We argued and FINALLY got her to give us the correct order (after she wasted precious time raising her voice at us). She said they would deliver it once it was ready and collect the wrong items (God forbid she just let us keep it for our troubles like every other place in the world does). Anyway ...AN HOUR LATER, we called to check on the reorder and she says, ""What do you mean? You have to come get it."" Considering we got delivery to begin with and we already discussed this in our previous conversation, I couldn't believe the audacity of this woman. She REFUSED to send her delivery guy out again.Finally fed up, my fiance went to go pick up our reorder, where the woman continued to argue with him. Totally unprofessional and truly unbelievable. I can't believe that they treat people with this much disrespect, especially local patrons who order from there every single week (which we reminded her of). I am so disgusted with the way we were treated. This is not how you conduct business. They just lost a customer for life.

I ordered the Shredded Beef with Scallion lunch special with brown rice and wonton noodle soup. First of all, I liked the container my food came in- rice on one side and beef on the other which made it super easy to mix and eat. The shredded beef was awesome. So much flavor and it tasted fresh. It has onions that were almost caramelized and perfectly softened, nicely cooked meat, delicious sauce, and some scallions on top. The onions and sauce were my favorite parts as you could tell they did not sacrifice flavor for time. It was the perfect size and a huge bargain at $6 (and came with the soup). Would definitely order this again. The wonton soup was also great- I wasn't a fan of the broth but the wontons in it were delicious and there were 3 pretty big wontons which I did not expect.I also ordered pork soup dumplings which were alright, but could have been better. I like the ones at Grand Sichuan a lot better, but they were decent and made a great late night snack. Not sure if I would order them again, or go with a different appetizer.This is definitely a great delivery option and they have both traditional and Americanized Chinese food on their menu.

I've been searching for YEARS trying to find a place that makes Mapo Tofu in a truly authentic way. Back in 2010 I was living in London and there was a local Szechuan placec that made unforgettable Mapo Tofu. Dark red in color, infused with ground pork and peppercorns that leave the signature numbness on your tongue, with soft cubes of tofu. I had too many bad experiences where instead, i got a bowl of brown, gravy-like goop with dry/spongy tofu, and the completely wrong flavor - basically a completely different dish! I had almost given up, but then I tried King Szechuan and not only did they hold up to this London plpace, they did it BETTER! So delicious, highly recommend.Apart from the Mapo Tofu, their house lo mein is also very good.

General Tso's Chicken - watery to the extreme, as if the broccoli was thrown in the sauce without being drained. Very disappointed in this. Pork Lo Mien - drowned in soy sauce.

Both times my order has come in a timely fashion and still hot. I LOVE their Vegetable Wonton Soup. It's really delicious. It's flavorful and has fresh spinach in it. The wontons are perfectly cooked and the soup is fresh, and delicious. Their Egg Rolls are also very good. I've tried the Sweet Potato Sesame cakes, just to try them, but I wasn't really a fan. It's an acquired taste I think, and for me, there was too much sesame.Out of their entrees, we've tried:Pork Lo Mein - Standard, but very good. Flavorful and it had a lot of fresh vegetables in it besides the pork, which was tender and not too fatty.Chicken and Broccoli - Very run of the mill, and a bit too greasy. But fine.Chow Fun - not something I would recommend for delivery. I think it's best eaten fresh, because when it arrives all of the noodles are stuck together in a big mess. However, it was very delicious and I would definitely try it again (just not for delivery).Pineapple Curry Chicken & Shrimp - Definitely the best thing we've tried.

I haven't been there but I've had them through delivery 3 times now, and this is a legit attempt at Szechuan food and it is almost always on the mark. So far I've had successful versions of double cooked pork, dan dan noodles (as Kevin wrote below, look for ""spicy noodles with minced pork""), cold spicy cucumber, and shredded pork with tofu. They were all great.I've also had fried rice and lo mein from them that were very good as well if you are looking for more American-style Chinese delivery.Definitely give this place a try.

98,uwu_WIC-wjyacXoWEnNOyQ,Chetan P.,5.0 star rating,"This restaurant is really tasty.  I'm particularly saddened by the majority of restaurants passing out Szechuan food.  This place uses traditional Szechuan spices.  That's right, you know that spice which makes your tongue numb and tingly?  That's what they've got!   The food itself is very tasty, I've had the  double delight.  It is incredible.  There are moist slivers/ chunks of chicken which are coated with incredible flavor.  When they say spicy, they are not kidding around.  I've had authentic Szechuan a handful of times, and this is one of them.  I also ordered an egg roll and a few typical apps- all of them were tasty and didn't feel heavy.I've ordered from this place 3 times in the last week.  That makes 3 times in the last 2 years since I almost gave up on finding a good Szechuan restaurant.  I've ordered from this place only through Grubhub.  Each time the delivery was very quick and the food was still crispy!",King Szechuan Palace,3.5 star rating,$$,Szechuan

One baby later and one move to the heights, and due to location, no more GS delivery...what's a Kung Pau, Mau Pau Tofu craving person to do...? King Szechuan, that's what!!! They deliver, the food is fresh, spicy, and tasty and they deliver to all of Jersey City!! So far I have had 4 different types of ""Double Cooked"" protein: the traditional pork, tender beef, chicken, and lightly fried fish. I have to say, the fish so far is surprisingly my favorite. The vegetarian Mau Pau Tofu is soft, silky, and spicy and pretty much melts in your mouth. The spicy wontons are a little doughy, but still great.

I had to call back 4 more times checking on status to which the lady admitted she does not know when it will get to us, what time our food went out for delivery etc. After 1 hour and 40 mins of waiting we cancelled our order not wanting to eat cold food! At this point it was almost 9 pm and we had to cook something being it was too late to order somewhere else. The delivery driver never showed up, meaning the lady could have contacted him and given us a realistic time for our food delivery. She was extremely rude and not helpful.

112,UD2lYFVTdByDri2NFqruSQ,M J.,3.0 star rating,"Be warned: delivery can take an hour and a half.  I ordered on a Friday night @ 7:30pm, and the food didn't come until 9.  It was pretty ridiculous and I was fortunate that I wasn't so hungry I had to order something else.  To be fair, the restaurant was probably pretty busy because the food still came piping hot and the delivery man seemed to be in a hurry.I'm used to ordering food from Grand Sichuan but wanted to try a different place.  I'm just not sure I'd order from here again, considering the portion sizes and the fact that the prices are similar to Grand Sichuan.  I had the cumin lamb and the spicy noodles with minced pork.  Their cumin lamb was a little salty (that may just be my palette) but the lamb itself was tender and overall, it was a good dish.  The spicy noodles with minced pork was okay...it didn't have much flavor from the chilli oil or the pork.  The spicy noodle dish is definitely a large portion for the price you pay, though.",King Szechuan Palace,3.5 star rating,$$,Szechuan

117,pA7hmLDPJpnNFA_Np6MHog,Rachel E.,4.0 star rating,"If you're looking for regular american Chinese food, it might seem like a decent but average delivery. I generally  ignore the first half of the menu and proceed directly to those dishes marked  house specialties and classical sichuan. These dishes contain the insanely vibrant spicy sichuan flavors I love / am slightly scared of. I've tried a ton of their sichuan dishes, cumin style, dry pot, coconut curry, Cheng-Du Style. Nothing so far beats Chong Qing Spicy Chicken, it's fiery and numbing and gingery and so so delicious. Sometimes its intimidating to wade thru the huge chunks of ginger, anise star, hot peppers and peppercorns to find the chicken, but its fun to see the flavors on my plate and know its seared into the chicken, not poured out of a jar. I also highly recommend 5 Doubled Cooked Style with pork - it comes with fresh sauteed scallions and buttery rich yet papery thin long strips of pork - great texture & flavor. I agree that the cold cucumber is awesome. My delivery usually takes an hour, which is is the estimate I always get from grubhub so I dont mind, just something to be aware of.",King Szechuan Palace,3.5 star rating,$$,Szechuan
