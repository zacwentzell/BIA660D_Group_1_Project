Consequently, when ordering food at work, I'm dependent on those co-workers who live in the general vicinity to suggest where the best places are to eat. One co-worker, of Peruvian descent, suggested Pio Pio and I was game. I've only eaten there a few times, and its invariably take out...I've never actually been in the restaurant...but I've become a big fan. And I do mean a big fan.When my co-worker asks where I'd like to order from, more often than not now, I'll reply, ""Pio Pio?"" Another co-worker, of Cuban descent, always laughs uproariously at that. Not entirely sure why--- my Irish-German-raised-as-a-WASP-in-north-Jersey accent? Maybe. But this ""gringo"" has come to love this restaurant, and if some good-natured mockery is what I have to go through to eat there, then so be it! The chicken soup is delicious-- crammed full of noodles, chicken and vegetables (including a section of corn on the cob with the cob included). Each day of the week has several specialties listed that you can order--- my particular favorite is Monday's ""Picadillo Crillo"" (ground beef in creole sauce). Every time I order this, my Cuban co-worker again laughs unroariously, and then corrects my mangling of the words. I usually get a side of rice with it, mix the Picadillo Crillo in, and chow down (last night I ordered it with a side of plantains rather than the black beans that I usually get with the rice-- every dish comes with 2 sides). I've had the yellow rice with chicken, but I especially love the Pot Roast with sauce. I haven't had pot roast since my mother made it for me as a child, but this recalls it vividly. Thankfully, nobody laughed when I ordered it. But it was....I know the word ""Amazing"" get thrown around a lot on Yelp, but this time the word is truly merited. The dish was, and is, amazing. Simple, perhaps, but amazing.What really stands out about this restaurant, beyond the quality of the food, is how much of it you get for so little money.  The pot roast, for example, cost only $8.50. And the quantity of meat, tender and flavorful, is prodigious. Perhaps I've eaten this much great food for so little money elsewhere in my life, but I can't remember where, or when. At some point, I suppose I'll have to actually sit down in the restaurant and order a meal. But I love this place; take-out, sit-down, or whatever. Really. Good, hearty food for very little money. I can't recommend it enough.",Pio Pio Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,"Spanish,, Latin, American,, Cuban"

Husband gets food from Tina's Cuban food in Manhattan sometimes and I think Pio Pio beat Tina's hands down. We have had awesome Cuban food in Miami and can vouch Pio Pio is legit. Ordered on a Friday night. Items ordered:- fried chicken steak - fried tilapia - chicken in garlic sauce - Tres Leches cake Each entree came with two very generous sides: we got plantains, yellow rice, rice with beans and yuca as sides. Rice was absolutely flavorful and don't shy away from the boiled yuca. It was fantastic as it had some sort of seasoning on top. Plantains were great as well.Also since these were weekday specials, the bill was surprisingly low. Score!!Bad: nothing really was disappointing, except that the chicken in the chicken in garlic sauce dish was dry. The dish had breaded chicken mixed in the sauce.Ugly: Nada.Will I try Pio Pio again?

The staff spoke English which isn't always true for Spanish restaurants on Central Ave. Makes my life a lot easier!!!!  :)The prices are on par with all the other restaurants in the area-$5-$12 per dish. Daily specials are varied so it's the not the same thing over and over again.  Main menu has a ton of options as well. They also Deliver!!! $10 min. Now to the food- Arroz Con Pollo was juicy and flavorful. Portion is huge. Easily two meals. Ropa Viejo-same as the Arroz con Pollo. Beef was tender. Will get two meals out of this as well.

I wanted to try something different, and my boyfriend and I always drive by this place so we decided to stop in.We went on Sunday, and they offered the daily Sunday items plus an a la carte menu. We chose to have the lechon asado, which was $6.95 and includes 2 sides. There was a variety to pick from, but we ended up getting the black beans and maduros. I read a couple of Yelp reviews that said their Arroz Frito (fried rice) was amazing, so I decided to grab an order of that as well ($5.50).Lastly, I picked up my papa rellena. Yum.My boyfriend paid a little under $15 for all the food, and let me tell you, we were able to feed both of us plus save a little on the side for my grandma and aunt. The value is amazing. As for the taste? OMG, SOOOO GOOD! Especially the fried rice! It had ham and peppers and pieces of shrimp in it. I'm thinking about ordering it again sometime this week. The lechon asado is a bit drier than I'm used to. I always eat this dish at cuban restaurants and it's always juicy and packed full of flavor. The dish here was dry but flavorful and cooked with onions. Though I must say I like the skin better here! It kind of tastes like the kind I can pick up at the Filipino stores - nice and crispy. My papa rellena took some getting used to. The outside is a little different than what I get at Rumba's, but once I reached the center, it was amazing!Overall, I love it here, and can't wait to try other dishes!------------Quick Tips!$10.00 credit card minimum!One of the numbers on the store awning and menu are not correct. We called and reached a personal number I guess. The second number is the phone number to the store!",Pio Pio Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,"Spanish,, Latin, American,, Cuban"

I'm not a chef but I can cook a better  meal than this place. We decided do give it a try the baked chicken paired with French fries and a side salad. Terrible!!! chicken was very dry, tasted like it was was warmed up. My husband ordered the churasco which came out sizzling from the kitchen, we asked for medium rare and it was well done. Not what he wanted and was not happy with. The pricing was decent, cheap I would say because we are foodies and love to eat at really good restaurants. This was not as good as I expected or read the reviews.  Will not go back to eat here, I would rather make dinner at home. My cooking is better as a Latina.  Next time we rather go to Applebee's than this local stuff that has no flavor. Nothing special",Pio Pio Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,"Spanish,, Latin, American,, Cuban"

Walking by the place which didn't look great the FAM decided to give it a try.so glade we did !! As soon as we sat they brang us warm toasted rolls with butter , which we snacked on while looking at the menu. The menus where in Spanish as well as English. Prices where very decent ,  I ordered the grilled Salmon , which was 11 or 10 dollars ... So when it got to my table it was 2 big sized filets !!!!! And the spice blend was amazingly perfect without over powering the salmon! My husband ordered the skirt steak, which to him was very good , and my husband is very picky with his ( its a man thing ) . he also ordered the rice that was fried with eggs and roast pork pieces (omg) !We are definitely going back in to this place !  It doesn't look like much but their food is surprisingly good with  big portions and great prices !!!   Did I also mention the service was excellent ??? Well it is, very tentative servers! Give them a try you won't regret it !",Pio Pio Restaurant,4.0 star rating,$,"Spanish,, Latin, American,, Cuban"
