I'd read on the Napoli's website that the owner is part of the family that founded Lombardi's in NYC so he's from a pizza dynasty. All positive things!The pizza lunch special (everyday, 11 AM-4 PM) currently is either two Margherita or classic slices for $5 or two specialty slices for $7. A fountain drink is included. For the slices, you go up to the counter and pick from what's available.We sat at a table inside (there's outside seating too) and dined on the Napoli sliders ($8.95) and the pizza slices (I got Margherita and veggie). The four meatball sliders on garlic knots were delicious and had come highly recommended from a friend. Neat and unique concept. The pizza was good too but maybe not quite as tasty. The crust was pleasantly crunchy. Veggie featured broccoli, peppers, onions, and basil. The fresh mozzarella was a highlight of both slices. The young man waiting on us was pretty friendly, easygoing, and attentive.So Napoli's may not be quite as good as Lombardi's, but it's a foolproof choice in Hoboken for sure.

This review is solely on a recent customer service experience that I can't not mention because it was so infuriating. On Saturday, 12/9/17, my roommate and I ordered delivery from Napoli's. When her phone # came up in their system they asked her if the address was correct and she let them know that she just moved and gave them her new address, which is only a few blocks away from the old one. We moved 1 block outside of Hoboken, into Jersey City. They took our order and let us know it would be 50-90 minutes, which was fine, it had snowed that day so we figured they'd be busy. 1 hour after we order, they call us and say, ""your food just came out, but we don't deliver to you so you can either come pick it up or we can cancel it."" They tell us their delivery radius and we tell them we're literally 1 block from there and ask if they can make an exception for tonight. The girl was completely unhelpful, we kept going back and forth pleading our case and she kept asking another person there and getting back on the phone and saying stuff like ""no we don't deliver there so what do you want us to do with your food?"" Then she says if we come pick it up, they'll give it to us for FREE. Being we've already been waiting an hour and don't want to order from a new place, we say yes to the free dinner. Luckily, my roommate has a car because if she didn't we would not have said yes to this. A minute after hanging up, they call back and  she says because we gave her a credit card already that it won't be free, that they can only give us the order for 50% off OR store credit for another day. She argues with the girl because this makes no sense. They don't post the receipts until closing, why can't they void our full payment and now why are they going back on their offer of a free meal? Both pissed, we drive over and I walk in and start explaining the situation to a guy who works there and I show him where we live on google maps compared to where they stop delivering and he says ""Oh! well why didn't you tell her that?"" WE DID!!! like 15 times!!!! That kind of customer service is just not ok! If they had called a few minutes after we ordered and said ""we're so sorry but we don't deliver that far, would you be able to pick up instead?"" we would've totally understood, but after you make someone wait an hour for their food don't say no to delivering food 1 block further than normal!

They took our order and let us know it would be 50-90 minutes, which was fine, it had snowed that day so we figured they'd be busy. 1 hour after we order, they call us and say, ""your food just came out, but we don't deliver to you so you can either come pick it up or we can cancel it."" They tell us their delivery radius and we tell them we're literally 1 block from there and ask if they can make an exception for tonight. The girl was completely unhelpful, we kept going back and forth pleading our case and she kept asking another person there and getting back on the phone and saying stuff like ""no we don't deliver there so what do you want us to do with your food?"" Then she says if we come pick it up, they'll give it to us for FREE. Being we've already been waiting an hour and don't want to order from a new place, we say yes to the free dinner. Luckily, my roommate has a car because if she didn't we would not have said yes to this. A minute after hanging up, they call back and  she says because we gave her a credit card already that it won't be free, that they can only give us the order for 50% off OR store credit for another day. She argues with the girl because this makes no sense. They don't post the receipts until closing, why can't they void our full payment and now why are they going back on their offer of a free meal? Both pissed, we drive over and I walk in and start explaining the situation to a guy who works there and I show him where we live on google maps compared to where they stop delivering and he says ""Oh! well why didn't you tell her that?"" WE DID!!! like 15 times!!!! That kind of customer service is just not ok! If they had called a few minutes after we ordered and said ""we're so sorry but we don't deliver that far, would you be able to pick up instead?"" we would've totally understood, but after you make someone wait an hour for their food don't say no to delivering food 1 block further than normal! Not to mention, we're in 1 of the 2 HUGE new luxury apartment buildings right past the little Welcome to Hoboken bridge and they're idiots to not move their radius a block and deliver to hundreds more apartments!",Napoli’s Brick Oven Pizza,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

41,Ar705HcaFuV1nXK_4E9n3w,golnaz b.,1.0 star rating,"Ahhhh where to begin....we had a good thing going...until you went all crazy on me! Let me explain...we've ordered several times...I would say five times. The first, I was freezing one cold winter night in hoboken walking around looking for a pie. I stumbled upon Napoli's and took it home. It was amazing!! Since that night, I have ordered delivery four additional times. The first two were as glorious as the first. Hot, fresh, melted cheese and garlic knots can't be beat. The last two times is where they steered me wrong. On the third time, the pie was burnt...n I mean burnt. Not only underneath, but on most of the edges of the crust and you could tell it had been sitting for a while before it was delivered. The garlic knots also didn't seem as fresh. Mind you, it was nowhere near closing time when we order $40 minus tip, down the drain. We thought it was a fluke, and was craving a good quality pie last night again. Unfortunately I didn't take a picture last night of the mess, so I only have a pic of the underneath of the couple slices we had left over. But I was irritated again last night when the pie arrives and it's burnt again! I had even called as soon as we placed the order online, to specify ""please don't burn it like last time"" I called and spoke to someone else when the pie arrived and told them it's burnt....again!! The lady apologized, put me on hold, came back and said when you order online, there's an option to click on lightly cooked or something like that...she said if u don't want your pie well done...I said, hey, I don't normally complain, but there is a difference between well done and burned. I even told her this is the second time!! She apologized and that was the end of that. $30 down the drain...and you don't realize it, until you start eating and the edges are so hard you cannot eat them, and the pie is so chewy it's like a workout for your mouth to finish the slice! Ate the last two slices this morning, and was so irritated, I thought this warrants a review. Although I haven't ordered from bergenline pizza in a while, we had one problem, I think it was the lacking of toppings and also missing some of the toppings we had paid additional for or something, but the owner gave our next pie for free, to correct the mistake (I will say there wasn't much of a difference, but at least he handled it professionally and was very nice about it all) Napoli's put me on hold, and came back and said I'm sorry, click on lightly cooked next time we order online. We were at costco earlier and even waiting having their delicious, yet very processed slices so that we can have a proper better quality one at home, and got this. Very disappointed and a bad experience...will not be ordering from here again, maybe will try if I'm in the area and I'm physically there to pick it up and watch as they make it, but even that's a big maybe. There's an abundance of pizza places here and with service and food like that, I can easily go elsewhere. Thanks, but no thanks!",Napoli’s Brick Oven Pizza,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

Man this place is busting with business - mostly people ordering & picking up! The traffic they get here on a Monday night is wild. I'm glad their business seems to be doing well! It's located on Washington which I'm sure has some what of an impact to locals and probably visitors. I love places that are BYOD :) We brought over a bottle of wine, no corkage fee, provide you glasses and they open it up for you. It was so busy the night we went, and there were only 2 waitresses and one busser. I'm not sure if this is the norm here but they could definitely use staff given how busy they are. We had really great service, granted they were uber busy - I give them credit for all the hustling. I also love a really good margherita pizza and some calamari :) The app was mediocre - it almost tasted like it was over cooked. It's unfortunate because it had a nice crisp, but the squid was just chewy. I'm not sure why they served with it marina sauce AND sweet chili sauce you get at asian/chinese restaurants. I wasn't feeling that. The die breaker is really the pizza here, because obviously we're at a pizza restaurant. I felt that the pie felt short on my list - the dough was cooked too long, it almost tasted a big cardboard-y. There wasn't enough sauce either :/ I am hoping to come back to try another kind of pizza because they do have good reviews.",Napoli’s Brick Oven Pizza,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

50,iHV_Ef7WMAu6u0XNyZgvJA,Sara M.,5.0 star rating,"Italian food never gets old, but sometimes the pizzerias in my neighborhood do. Because of that, it's worth heading to Napoli's every now and again. Although the name makes it seem more like a pizza joint, Napoli's has got an extensive menu with lots of different pasta, entree and app options. The dining area is pretty small, but it's usually not hard to snag a table since a large portion of their business is take-out. The food here is absolutely incredible. Portions are large, so I'd suggest sharing. The personal sized pizza is more like a medium, the medium sized is more like a large, and the large...well, I haven't gotten that far yet. After seeing pics on Yelp, I was 100% positive that I'd order the garlic knot sliders during my next visit, and last week I did exactly that. The order came with four plump garlic knots, sliced in half with a large meatball, gooey mozzarella and fresh tomato sauce in between. Mic drop. Because the order of four was pretty large, that and a personal sized vodka pie split between two was the perfect amount of food. All of that for under 20 bucks with BYOB wine is absolutely a deal considering that most spots in the area will run you over 20 dollars for an entree alone. And everything here is way more fresh and delicious than most places that you'll find in Hoboken.

I ordered for pickup on Seamless: a salad and spaghetti with parm cheese on the side. Simple enough. After picking up said order, I get home and realize that they forgot the toppings and dressing for the salad, leaving a bowl of (brown, wilted) spinach. So I call and they tell me they'll have the delivery guy bring a new salad in 15 mins. After an hour and another frustrated call to Napolis, the delivery guy finally shows up. Takes the bad salad back even though the girl on the phone told me that I could keep it ""for the inconvenience."" Fine because I didn't want rotten lettuce anyway. Another hour later, I get an email from Seamless letting me know that Napolis adjusted my order. I think ""aw how nice, they probably gave me some kind of credit for the hassle.""...Nope.

Now that I live 3 blocks away I don't order delivery so I no longer have those issues.For what you get and for the price you can't beat Napolis. All of the employees are incredibly friendly and helpful, from the pizza maker to the waitress. They are always smiling and really friendly. I don't know how they do it sometimes, especially at lunch time. But we love going here for dinner too, it is good and you can walk away from dinner for $30. BYOB is obviously a huge plus. I absolutely love the fettuccine pasta  in a cajun cream sauce. It takes a lot of self control not to eat the whole thing. Their lunch specials can't be beat, for $6.42 you can get a chicken parm hoagie, side salad and a drink (you can get other hoagies for the same deal). They also have great pizza deals at lunch. While I am still not a fan of their buffalo slice, I am absolutely in love with their chipotle chicken slice. That one is a winner! At lunch it is insane. The stroller mafia rolls in to this tiny space and takes it over. I never eat in the dining room at lunch, always to go. I can't take the kids screaming and yelling with no parental control and strollers literally everywhere like a stroller parking lot. The space is really tiny inside so there's never really anywhere to stand where you aren't in the poor waiters way or getting your toes run over.

This my friends is on my top 3 favorite pizza joints in New Jersey. It's perfectly thin, right amount of sauce and cheese. Toppings are incredibly fresh, pepperoni is small, nice and crispy, arugula is crisp yet delicate, and jalapenos is a monster in your mouth, holy moly will it burn your mouth. Definitely the spiciest jalapeno I have ever ate and I can handle spice. Regardless of the topping, you will truly enjoy this pizza spot. They are reasonably priced plus offer deals on Groupon and 20% off on Yelp check ins. For a small 14"" pie with one topping costs $15.50, heck that's a bargain right there enough for two people. Service is very good and attentive, they care about pleasing their customers. They are very busy especially on the weekends, to the point where they have 7- 8 delivery personnel's delivering pies, which is insane considering there are so many other pizzerias in Hoboken.

The buffalo chicken slice looked very good, so I ordered one of those and the grandma's slice, of which was on the thicker side. The buffalo chicken slice stood out, not only in appearance but also in taste. Amazing! The second time I came here my girlfriend and I ordered a small margharita pizza and some garlic knots. The garlic knots were some of the best I have ever had! The margharita pizza is conjured up with san marzano tomatoes, fresh mozz, basil, and romano cheese. The tomato sauce in particular had a rustic and authentic taste to it -- definitely freshly made.

Guy comes back a minute later with a Napoli's onesie for the little dude!Anyways, probably should talk about the food. Caprese salad - nice fresh mozzarella with big tomato slice. Bruschetta - toasty, yet soft bread, just completely smothered in the chopped tomato salad, as it should be. Half sausage and ricotta pizza - the pizza here really is nicely done. Chewy crust, and the ricotta adds a nice creamy and smooth element to the pie. Half clam pizza -  this one was a touch more oceany than I might have liked, but it's a clam pizza so I really can't fault it for being oceany. Strangely enough, taking it home and letting it sit for the day took some of that edge off and I liked it better cold.

I was a bit irritated but I gently let it ride hoping the food would be worth the extra cost. Unfortunately the notorious Vodka Pie was extremely disappointing. The cheese and sauce was all burnt on top and the pizza was way too rough and chewy. Didn't seem like a brick oven pizza at all. The saving grace to my meal were the wings which were cooked very well and tasted great!

They have expanded their menu so there's a lot to choose from for those who don't want pizza. The brick oven gives the pizza a distinctive flavor to separate this from most others in Hoboken.

Their large pie is larger than most, and there was a little bit of sogginess at the tip that I didn't fault (it was delivery). We also got a side of sautéed broccoli and even though it was frozen broccoli, they worked some kind of magic so that it got a little browned in the pan and had deep garlic flavor.I was impressed by the super-fast delivery (it was a holiday weekend), and the pie was tasty.

Hallelujah!Here's a few other things I've noticed about Napoli's. Their large pizzas are absolutely enormous so expect leftovers. I find pizza dries out in the fridge and therefore never eat the leftovers. Not this pizza. It holds up really well for a few days and is good cold or reheated. Their entrees are good and also delivered in portions large enough for two meals.Their white pizzas are awesome. I love red sauce, so the first time we ordered one of them, I requested a side of sauce to dip it in. Totally unnecessary. And the buffalo chicken is killer. They make their own buffalo sauce; it is some heavenly buffalo Alfredo hybrid. Resembles no buffalo chicken pizza you've ever had before in the best way.

They have one of my favorite pies that I've ever eaten: the vodka pie. It's salty, creamy, crispy, and delicious. My 2nd favorite pie is the white pie, which is heavy, dense, and cheesy (one or two slices per person should be plenty). A lot of folks also rave about the clam pie as well, but I haven't tried it yet (not really into seafood on my pizza).Other than pies, I've also had the Hoboken Salad and the (spicy) blackened chicken pasta. Both were pretty good, but don't skip the pies.Bring a group of friends, a bunch of wine and beer, and sit outside under the heat lamps and enjoy the people watching with a large vodka and a large white.

Also, only for dine-in.  This is our go to place for some sit down pizza pie -especially since its brick oven baked. You can't go wrong with their pizza... Any of their selection tastes excellent. A 'small' feeds 2 people super well with 6 slices. Their crust is typically nice & toasty, the pizza not too saucy (you can ask for extra sauce if you'd like), and all toppings are fresh. The garlic knots are EXTRA garliccy yet so delicious... If you're not into that it may be a bummer. Ohhhhh, and it's BYOB with no cutting fee... Doesn't get better than that.

Most Hoboken natives would direct people towards Benny's, but Napoli's has been my go-to place ever since they opened and had only one table. As someone who's worked in the restaurant business, I have this to say to the people complaining about delivery time: you have to understand that, in most cases, restaurants hire delivery services to take out orders and don't do the delivering themselves, so don't give Napoli's your poor reviews. If that's not the case for Napoli's and they do have their own delivery staff, then I guess it would be understandable.

Christina, the woman I dealt with, should really consider another profession. She was rude, sarcastic and condescending (to the point of disbelief). No apologies were made by Christina for failing to notify us that our order was cancelled for over an hour and  a half made numerous contradicting excuses as to why I wasn't notified of the cancellation (none being her or napoli's fault).  She didn't apologize once and didn't offer us anything like a discount on future orders.

258,6W5C_p7lXTdPc7FNgoe2Dg,Brian M.,1.0 star rating,"I have had far too many negative experiences with Napoli's to give them more than 1 star. Back in the summer, my girlfriend and I ate there at an outdoor table for lunch. Before we sat down, we went inside (where it was practically empty) and asked the server nicely if it was ok to sit outside (and of course she said that was fine and she'd be right out). She didn't come out for more than 15 minutes to even bring a menu, and that was just the beginning. After more than an hour of waiting, we got the wrong pizza, to which our server seemed to not really care and just shrugged. By the time we got the correct pizza and ate, we were there for more than an hour and a half, and the manager's explanation was essentially ""this isn't how we normally operate"" but really took no responsibility for any of the issues. Very comforting. But last night was frankly the last straw for me. I placed an order through Seamless for a small pizza with 1 topping at 7:00, and the estimated delivery time was 7:45 to 7:50. I was fine waiting, but at 8:00 I started to wonder. So I checked the status of my order, and now it said estimated delivery time 8:15 to 8:25. Ok, well I get that it's a Friday night. But then at 8:30, I still had no pizza and no sign of when I would have it. I called the restaurant (it took me nearly 15 tries because the phone line was busy over and over), and someone finally explained that the restaurant was very backed up and they were thinking about not taking any more delivery orders. But you know what? This is not a new restaurant; they know exactly what a Friday night is like in Hoboken, and the fact that they can't anticipate that shows me they just don't care that much or they can't figure out how to make enough pizzas. Either way, get your act together. My pizza ended up coming at 8:50 (an hour and 50 minutes for a small pizza that only had to travel 6 blocks). And despite my call to the restaurant, no one even offered to refund so much as the delivery fee. You may be wondering: how was the pizza after all that time? It was fine. Not the best and not the worst. Certainly not worth an hour and 50 minute wait. I'm done with Napoli's.",Napoli’s Brick Oven Pizza,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

The 5 pies we ordered all had that perfectly crunchy dough all NY pizza should have. Best part was they even helped us rotate some of the pies amongst the table halfway through. Not to mention, they were awesome in letting us casually kill about 10 bottles of wine without rushing. Pretty awesome.Oh, and did I mention, we paid $11 each.

The reason why I'm giving Napoli's 4 stars and not 5 is because of food quality. The Pizza is very solid. Not the best I've ever had, but definitely above average brick oven pizza. Pasta dishes are huge portions, but quality wise they are just OK. However some of their other dishes-the cold antipasto (Got bad cheese in it once), stuffed mushrooms, Mussels Marinara, weren't good. It's just been fairly inconsistent across the board. Salads and Paninis are good, wraps meh. Napoli's has been my go to delivery Italian restaurant based on pretty fair price, reliability, and for some of it's dishes (Pizza, salads, and Paninis mainly).

292,vRkR9Q6iusLL1wuPVYPDlw,Richard H.,3.0 star rating,"Stopped in solely because they are now offering gluten free pizza and pasta (and ravioli, which apparently is separate from pasta).  We had the primavera pizza on GF crust, & vodka penne.  The pizza was good.  We've had much better, but we've also had much worse.  The pasta was ok, but much more sauce than was necessary, especially considering there wasn't GF bread with which to mop up the remainder after the pasta was gone.3 stars, because it's hard to rate this against ""fine dining"" establishments, which this is not.  At all.  This was very apparent in many aspects.  Old, cruddy decor, ATM machine for late night slices, lackluster service, and those red, plastic Coke cups for starters...It is BYO though, and they had wine glasses.  So, next time we're in the mood for GF pizza (and not in the mood to cook it ourselves), we'll grab a cheap bottle of red & get visit.  Worth coming back, but not a regular spot.",Napoli’s Brick Oven Pizza,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

Thumbs up to them!We ordered about 6 or 7 pies for the table and when they started coming out it was like a stampede of pizza! We had the white pie, white with broccoli, vodka, pepperoni and sausage, veggie, and margherita. The white pizza was delicious, one of the best I've had in a while. Just the right amount of ricotta and garlic, the broccoli only enhanced it! I only had a bite of the vodka pie and it was pretty good, not the best I've had, but still tasty! The margherita and meat pies also did not disapoint and were very flavorful! The crust had just the right amount of crunch and the rest of the slice was chewey and really tasty.Even with a large party, the staff allowed us to use the 20% check-in offer and the bill came to about 12$ a person and we paid for our friend.

We split everything -- an arugula salad with a tasty vinaigrette, a small veggie pie, and a tiramisu, and it was MORE than enough and the total bill was only about  35 bucks. (We BYOB'd so that made it cheaper.)  The pizza was great -- crisp thin crust, ample crisp veggies, homemade mozzarella, nice basil seasoning, etc.  Everything tasted delicious. Also, It has a family-style feel (tables close together) but that made it casual in a nice way. You can see the flames of the brick oven right from the table. Kiss my behind, San Giuseppe.

299,TVTTveXBDH0-ZhI_8pIp3w,Holly N.,1.0 star rating,"Holy heck in a handbasket. This restaurant was an ""experience"" and I do NOT mean that in a good way. I give it to 'em. It was Labor Day and a lot of places were closed, thus they were probably abnormally busy and possibly understaffed. But what happened to our table was inexcusable and there was no attempt on the part of the restaurant to reconcile the mistakes that were made. We arrived 'round about 6pm and found a table outside. The inside of the restaurant was fairly empty and there was another empty table or two outside. There also seemed to be two waitresses working, so we didn't think there'd be any issue with our food. However, we did take into account that it was a holiday. Food was delivered to our table around 6:30pm... 3 out of 4 entrees, anyway. My whole wheat baked ziti was missing. I was assured that my food would be out shortly and my friends, despite my insistence, were waiting for me to eat before they would eat their food - for the first 15+ minutes, anyway. The place was filling up, but still I waited without any food. The group at the table next to us eventually asked if I wasn't eating and I told them, ""no, I'm still waiting for my food."" After 20ish minutes I had to almost grab the waitress to ask about my pasta. She looked shocked and scurried to the kitchen (we had a window so we could see the fiasco). She was gone for quite some time before returning to the dining room to serve another table water, then another with pastas, then a pizza to another... it was now literally more than 40 minutes since my friends had their meals arrive. The group next to us then offered me two of their leftover slices of pizza and I took it because I was hungry and so my friends could start eating. Ten minutes later our waitress came back outside with a pizza for another table (a pizza that was ordered after my friends had received their food) and I told her to just cancel my baked ziti. She looked relieved!! She said, ""Are you sure?"" and I explained that the other table had given me food. She then proceeded to say that the people in the kitchen were being ""dumb"" and that they were completely messing her up the whole night. I don't think she offered a ""sorry"" even one time and didn't make a single concession. The kicker is, there was NEVER any ziti!! If she had put in the order the first time or actually checked in the kitchen there would have been ziti and they should have given it to me on the house to-go. I wasn't offered anything for being completely ignored. I wasn't offered a meal to-go, a gift certificate to come back, or even a free dessert. All I received was a scratched out meal on our check - so the kitchen obviously did get my order to begin with. This place was embarrassing and our experience, despite the holiday, was indefensible since they didn't even try to make things right.

So I happily went to delivery.com and ordered a large whole wheat pizza with chicken and a Hoboken salad. I ordered the pizza at 8:23 PM hoping it would arrive in time for me to enjoy it along with my Sunday night Fox line up. The pizza arrived at 9:45 PM. So - I live 10 minutes from Washington St. It couldn't have taken them over an hour to make a pizza? Anyway, around 9:15 I got worried about the safety of my pizza so I phoned. A very rude lady picked up and brushed me off saying, ""It takes 45 minutes"" followed by a click. No goodbye. When the much awaited pizza arrived it was cold and soggy. It tasted awful. I tried to fix it by throwing it in the oven and heating it up but alas, it was unfixable. I had to throw all of it out. The salad was mostly lettuce. Not fresh crispy lettuce, but the kind of lettuce that has been left in the fridge too long. Overall,  awful experience. Wasted $33.00.

The great part is both the Marg and Clam pies come in personal sizes as well.  So even if you are eating alone, you can just order yourself a pie.Next time you're looking for some pizza, I recommend ordering a medium or large Margarita and a personal clam pie as a shared appetizer.Pair it with some cold beer, and you've got a winner.Online ordering also great for easy home delivery.  FAST!",Napoli’s Brick Oven Pizza,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

We love Grimaldis, and were those determined to not like this pizza.However, we were both disappointed to learn that we actually really like Napoli's pizza. I might even have to go so far as to admit that I like it more than Grimaldi's, though my roommate argued winning traits for both. We both agreed that Napoli's had a crisper crust, which was a thumbs up. In terms of sauce/cheese, I would say they're comparable. We did agree, however, that Grimaldis has better pepperoni.So what put Napoli's ahead for me? It holds up better in the fridge. Grimaldis gets quite soggy when put in the fridge, which means that you pretty much need to scarf the whole thing down upon delivery if you want to maximize enjoyment. Napoli's, however, did not disappoint in delivering a satisfying cold pizza breakfast.The takeaway? Both Grimalds and Napoli's are great.

However, most importantly, there exists no amount of snow, rain, sleet, or hail that will stop me from writing my reviews. Therefore on Wednesday (when these articles are written), I braved the elements and headed out into the Snowpocalypse to see what Napoli's Brick Oven Pizza had to offer. Napoli's is located in the foreign land of Uptown Hoboken on Washington St between 11th and 12th Streets. Normally, the general Stevens population has no business uptown except for the infamous Malibu Diner; however, because we have dorms in both Shipyard and Curling Club, this review should be of special interest Stevens North. Napoli's still has that ""New Car"" feel both inside and outside. They have several tables in front of an open kitchen proudly displaying their pseudo brick oven - brick on the outside and gas on the inside. Traditional brick oven's used wood or charcoal, but Napoli's has stepped into the future with a gas oven that provides better temperature control for more even cooking. The server was top notch and was very friendly and attentive. She even laughed at one of my jokes, which will always score extra points in my book. Offering the typical pizzeria menu, we started off the meal with a Stuffed Mushroom appetizer, which I didn't think was anything too spectacular. I couldn't tell if they were fresh made or not, but I didn't think they were too bad. Not surprisingly, Napoli's scored big with their fresh gourmet Margarita pizza topped with pepperoni and sausage. For those unfamiliar with gourmet pizza, I feel sorry that you have not lived. Thin crispy crust with fresh ingredients make for pizza fit for the gods. Sorry, I'm getting a little carried away because while the pizza was good, I wouldn't call it the greatest culinary experience of my lifetime, but I will admit that it can give the other pizzas in town a run for their money. We also ordered their Penne Vodka, which was cooked to textbook perfection. For dessert, we had their Oreo Cheesecake, which tasted pretty good even though I am fairly certain that it came from a box. I was unfortunately too full to try their selections of paninis and pastas, but I am sure I'll be going back another time. Here I thought that Grimaldi's was the only gourmet pizzeria in town, but I was mistaken. ""Hidden"" in Uptown Hoboken, Napoli's is definitely in the running (maybe just a close second) for my favorite pizza in town. I am almost embarrassed to have let this gem sit under my nose for 4 years since their opening in 2006. It is slightly closer than Grimaldi's, which usually wins big, but I am known to travel far and wide for quality food.

The dressing is more like mayonnaise than Caesar.",Napoli’s Brick Oven Pizza,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"

397,5cdHxQUTrF4ZR2Tevbp8mg,Krosta G.,1.0 star rating,WORST PLACE IN THE WORLD. NEVER GO HERE! Everytime I order they mess it up. Everytime they try to fix it...they seem to still mess it up. They are rude and the food is horrible. Biggest mistake to order from them again. Never again...ever! If I could give it no stars I would.,Napoli’s Brick Oven Pizza,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"
398,N_yuKLfpi_8g8hK16BpzTQ,Michelle S.,5.0 star rating,"Napoli's has the best pizza in town, by far.  Their pizza has the perfect sauce to cheese ratio and all of the ingredients are of the highest quality.  No, it's not cheap (especially compared to a $5 pie from Domino's) but it's worth it.  Just be warned that it can take up to an hour for delivery, especially on a Friday night.",Napoli’s Brick Oven Pizza,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"
399,CXlCPe0sOrgS5iLmZZAjSQ,Emily R.,4.0 star rating,"Napoli's and Grimaldi's are my two favorite pizza places in Hoboken.  (Course I also love Bennie's for the huge slices and prices!) Lately though, since it's been cold, I prefer Napoli's due to the location (and I just discovered that they are BYOB) - Score!  I've only had take-out and eat-in so I can't review their delivery service, besides I like my pizza straight out of the oven and into my mouth.  I love this pizza because I can eat a 1/2 of a large and not feel sick from cheese or grease overload - it's so good I could eat the whole thing.  Their pizzas have definitely improved since they first opened - I think they're just getting better and better!",Napoli’s Brick Oven Pizza,3.5 star rating,$$,"Pizza,, Italian"
