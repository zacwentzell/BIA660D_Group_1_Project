Friends come to me for food recommendations, so my review should hold more weight over others who think taco bell is authentic mexican food. I do see a few past reviews where out-of-towners did agreeably have bad luck, or deliveries went bad (I never order delivery so sorry for that).What I can say is I have ordered well over 100 times from them and I keep coming back. The portions and price are always on point. They know me by name, I typically order the chicken parm with a side of potatoes and vegetables or pizza pie and they do not disappoint. I have ordered everything from their pizza, ravioli, chicken wrap, rice ball, salad, chicken wings. I lived off their soup when I was sick, Dined in with friends when they come over from the city, and they are ""wow""ed. Others have already noted their service. Even if they messed up my order a few times I would still come back and give these guys 5 stars. Out of the 100 times, maybe 1 time they kept it in the oven longer than preferred or the food wasn't as piping hot (my fault for arriving later) but you are a fool if you don't come here. Food is consistently good, sometimes their margherita pizza cheese is runnier on a rare occasion (no one is perfect) but this is my go to spot if I want to eat out and dunno what to get.

41,iHV_Ef7WMAu6u0XNyZgvJA,Sara M.,5.0 star rating,"Okay, hold the phone.I've been ordering delivery from Gino's for years and had no idea that they had such a lovely dine in area. Central ave has got a ton of restaurants and Gino's is not one to overlook. There are two separate store fronts- one for their take out pizza delivery gig and another for the sit down restaurant. The sit down space is enormous and had plenty of available booths on a Thursday night around dinner time. I was craving a classic Italian meal and the menu did not fail to disappoint. SO. MUCH. PASTA.The portions were delicious and filling and I'm still in shock about how low our bill was. Oh, and bottles of wine are 15 dollars here. It was Canyon Road but wutevs, I'm not picky about what I wash down a bowl of pasta with. We started off with a ""small"" Caesar salad which was more then enough for two people and was tossed with creamy dressing and crunchy garlic croutons. I was a bit disappointed about the lack of parm cheese on the salad, but it's okay, that came later in in the meal. I love when restaurants serve a unique bread basket, and the mini slices of tomato pie that they brought out were adorable and tasty.Next up was a sausage, pepper and onion roll with mozzarella cheese. I'm not sure if this is a valid complaint, but there was actually too much sausage. Not a bad thing, but I would have preferred some more peppers and onions mixed in. Lack of veggies aside, this was a serious roll. I was into it.And finally, the piece de resistance- a steaming bowl of penne vodka with grilled chicken. This was perfect. Lots of vodka sauce (just the way I like it), hearty pieces of chicken and perfectly al dente pasta. This meal was under 40 dollars. Wine- 15.00Salad- 5.00Sausage Roll- 4.50Penne Vodka w/ chicken- 12.00Even when I'm a bit of a ways away on Grove Street I'll be making appearances at Gino's every now and then.

46,URDkmpcTTcWmXg65owRBUQ,Kristine D.,5.0 star rating,"I grew up in The Heights, and this is a solid place for pizza, garlic knots, chicken rolls, rice balls, etc. The people who work there are good, solid employees. They're attentive and have excellent memories!!1. The pizza is stellar! Hands down. If you're looking for a classic cheese slice, you found it. They also have an awesome buffalo pizza that you can get with ranch or blue cheese. My husband likes the Brooklyn ($1.50) and I'm a fan of the Grandma pizza too. The Sicilian is not as heavy as at other pizzerias, which I prefer. If you're new to the area, try a variety and figure out what you like. Once you figure it out and come in regularly, they'll know your order every time you come in.2. Chicken rolls, rice balls and garlic knots, oh my! These are all really delicious. They don't skimp on the chicken in their chicken roll. Be sure to ask for extra sauce, you won't regret it because all three of these are mighty tasty when dipped or smothered in that red gravy. They always keep a warm container right on top of the pizza oven. 3. Pasta and salad! My husband is a sucker for stuffed shells. It came with plenty of cheese and sauce and a roll for dipping. It's pretty unmemorable but the portions are huge. Their grilled chicken Caesar salad on the other hand is top notch. The lettuce is fresh and crisp, the croutons are crunchy and the dressing is like CRACK. Since they don't skimp on the chicken on the salad, either it can easily turn into two meals. If you're on a diet, this might not be the salad for you. The salad is perfect for sharing though!I've been going to Gino's since I was a kid, and they've always had great service and excellent food. If you like sweets, they have a nice tiramisu and a good selection of smooth and creamy Italian ice (available year round). Best of all, they're willing to mix flavors too! Gino's will always be a staple for me in the Heights! And if you like local sports teams, they've always got a game on on one of their 2 tvs. (No worries, they'll play both Yankees AND Mets games!)",Gino’s Pizzeria,4.0 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"

After an inquisitive phone call to ensure availability of the penne pie, Gino (probably not) called me back to offer to pop it in the oven now. Kudos!  The actual restaurant, located in The Heights section of JC, had ample seating and a real convivial, neighborhood feel. Oh and they serve beer too! The penne was delivered on an extra crispy, thin crust. Although the sauce was enjoyable, with a hint of sweetness, the pizza itself didn't stand out much, relegated to being a pasta receptacle, overshadowed by the penne. It was also quite messy with many an escaped noodle. Bring your fork! Can't blame Gino's too much though -- pasta pizza is a rough one, pretty much overkill no matter how you slice it. Oh, but we also tried the white slice and that was delicious! WHITE PIZZA SAVES THE DAY!",Gino’s Pizzeria,4.0 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"

Finally got a chance to dine in with the Mrs. and have some pasta. They have daily specials of which my wife ordered from.  She ordered the smoked mozzarella and asparagus ravioli. It was served with a tomato basil sauce and broccoli rabe.  It was still very good this afternoon when I heated up the leftovers.  I went off the regular menu and had the Cavatelli Verde. Lots of Cavatelli served with their homemade sausage (couldn't resist) and broccoli rabe.  The sauce also had a good amount of garlic which I like.Also of some note they have a pretty good wine menu.

59,Ln5DNptLCy45NrakGwZxaA,Brian S.,4.0 star rating,"I've ordered from here twice and have quickly become a fan of the baked ziti pizza. An important factor for me is that the crust is able to support the weight of the pasta and doesn't collapse as soon as you pick it up, which I think a lot of places fail to do. Another good option is the buffalo chicken pie, although I will say that I don't think I could several normal slices. I just order a personal and share that with my girlfriend. I think more than that would be too much for me. The only pie, that I've ordered, that I would not recommend is the Grandma pie as I felt it was very greasy and oily and after only two slices, left my stomach feeling not-so-great.Delivery is on the slower side; they tell you it'll be 45-60 minutes but it usually tiptoes on just over the 60-minute mark.

I have been coming here for a few months now and I have to admit these guys do it right. One of the best pizza joints in the heights. These guys are committed to giving you a quality product in the shortness time possible and they have all those years under their belt to prove it.Most of the time I order pickup and the person on the phone ALWAYS has gotten my order right. A very important aspect in the pizza industry. Their timing is great and the pizza is always ready to devour in 5 minutes as I arrive home. My favorite is the margarita the right balance of mozzarella and tomato sauce. Get the 16-inch you'll definitely want some more after your first round. Pizza is such an amazing creation and add a bottle of red wine and boom your wife will appreciate it.The other day I came in to Gino's where they have the pizza oven and ordered a couple of slices of deep dish mozzarella and diced tomatoes. Incredibly delicious. Don't be fooled by the look of the slices just sitting on the counter. The flavor is there and that's all it matters. I'll keep coming to Gino's one because It has the essence of a family restaurant and they hustle the right way when it comes to pizza. By the way they have Gino's restaurant next door for a more restaurant-like experience. I have read from other yelpers that is a fun experience.

The pizza was pouring  with water in the middle. Turned into a soup like meal. They offered to cook it more but I hesitated. After eating the first slice it was walk out and leave it or let them try to cook it a bit longer.  After they cooked it for at lest 3-4 more minutes it made the pizza firmer in the middle and less water.  Would not come here again for pizza.  At least the staff was polite and friendly.  That's why they get back one star.,Gino’s Pizzeria,4.0 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"

I'm pretty sure I've ordered wings from here, too, and they were delicious.This past weekend I decided to try a different pizza place I found on seamless. I 100% regret that decision.

I've eaten in and taken out, and it's consistently awesome. The ingredients are fresh, the sauce is the perfect balance between sweet and savory, and the crust is just right (not too doughy or too thin). If you're looking for a crunch, the slices will satisfy, but order pies well done. I highly recommend extra cheese on the slices (there's enough on the regular, but this makes it extra gooey), and the caprese appetizer. Price is a little higher than what I've come to expect in the area, but it's still a good deal, and well worth it for the quality. The restaurant itself is pretty innovative. It's essentially split in two, with one side for grabbing a quick slice, and the other a little nicer for the sit-down experience. The staff can be a little busy when it's packed, but they've always been friendly once I have their attention. They also don't mind leaving the pie uncut for Muslim customers who are concerned about cross contamination with pepperoni.

I definitely dig pan pizza and the crust here it semi thick, crunchy, flavorful. The Grandma's Sicilian was the definite winner out of the two. Not to take away from their CBR pie but sometimes you just need the basics of dough, sauce n cheese. The CBR was overloaded, tasty, but definitely overwhelming. They do not skimp on the bacon or chicken. Frankly the toppings were a meal on their own. So, bad news is that I over ordered.  Good news is that I'm enjoying the pizza again today as leftovers.

Be warned that their roasted garlic doesn't taste roasted at all, but raw, and comes in gigantic pieces in your pasta dish. I had to pick them all out and I think that completely ruins the flavor - no one wants giant pieces of garlic in their food! But their sausage is absolutely delicious. Really makes the dish.Their Calzones are huge and are full, and I mean full, of ricotta and melted cheese. Pepperoni Rolls are also amazing.I would skip the soups - all of the orzo in my Chicken Orzo were stuck together in clumps, and my husbands' Pasta Fagioli was really oily and over-killed with beans.Side salads that come with pasta or entrees are fresh, and the dressing is good.Going to start ordering their Pizza next!",Gino’s Pizzeria,4.0 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"
100,cQxiAHKd7RD4U90d7VPsSA,Stephanie Y.,4.0 star rating,"I'm a fan. One night my man and I (mainly my man)decided to order a lot of food in. Sandwiches and a grandma stye pizza. Gino's delivery was prompt: they told us 45 minutes, and delivery was in 45 minutes. Perfect. We ordered the chicken foccacia sandwich and a cheese steak to go along with a pizza. (Don't judge). I had one bite of the cheese steak and wasn't a fan but, the man enjoyed it so he ate it. The roll was a somewhat hard italian roll, with gridled steak meat and regular American cheese with peppers and onions but, I found it to be too much roll. I ate my half of the chicken foccacia sandwich and that was delicious - however the roomie wasn't a fan; he found it bland. The bread was sort of that rosemary focaccia but, the slices weren't too thick which was great as I felt the bread didn't over power the thin grilled chicken breasts topped with fresh mozz. The sandwiches were about $7 each and were large. So large, that though we were ravished with hunger we were both full.We wrapped the pizza up and put it in the freezer for quick dinner or late night drunken snacks. Drunken snacks it was and what a damn delicious idea. Just a quick nuke in the microwave and a little time in the toaster oven, these slices were delicious and doughy and flavorful and they were in the freezer for days! We both decided next time, we'll order pizza from Gino's and only pizza so we can check it out when it's hot, straight outta the oven... dare might I say that I found my pizza spot in JC?! Maybe?

107,obj9gQyg_3j40Kq-O9xQeQ,Charles L.,1.0 star rating,"I got myself FOOD POISONING from Gino's Cream of Broccoli soup a few years back! It was so bad I crawled into the ER at 2am and had to get re-hydrated via IV! This torture lasted 5 days. Naturally, I cannot tell you anything about the food at Ginos today, so forgive me. I won't eat there ever again.Strange thing is, when I informed the owner, he pretty much postured like I was lying or just looking for money from him...taking food out of his kids mouths or something. A real class act huh? This reaction ensures that I will never set foot in that petri dish ever again.So my advice - to go along with my review - is this:If you ever get food poisoning from Ginos, save the left-overs (evidence) and GET A LAWYER! Post what happens here because I'd like to get a good belly-laugh. Only thing worse than a place with bad food is a place that doesn't handle food safely!I should have gotten a lawyer, you lucked out Gino!-----------------------------------------------------------------Ahora en español ...Me conseguí una intoxicación alimentaria por Gino Crema de brócoli Sopa de hace unos años! Era tan malo que me metí en la sala de emergencia a las 2 am y tuve que re-hidratado por vía intravenosa! Esta tortura duró 5 días. Naturalmente, no puedo decirte nada sobre la comida en Ginos hoy, así que me perdone. No voy a comer allí de nuevo.Lo extraño es que cuando informó al propietario, que adoptó la postura más o menos como si estuviera mintiendo, o simplemente en busca de dinero de él ... de tomar la comida de sus bocas para niños o algo así. Una verdadera clase actuar ¿no? Esta reacción se asegura de que nunca voy a poner un pie en esa placa de Petri nunca más.Así que mi consejo - para ir junto con mi opinión - es la siguiente:Si alguna vez una intoxicación alimentaria por Ginos, guardar las sobras (pruebas) y obtener un abogado! Publica lo que ocurre aquí porque me gustaría conseguir un buen vientre reír. Lo único peor que un lugar con comida en mal estado es un lugar que no maneja los alimentos con seguridad!Debería haber llegado a un abogado, la suerte de Gino!",Gino’s Pizzeria,4.0 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"

I ordered chicken parm, baked ziti, sausage and peppers, eggplant rollatine and a 6 foot hero.  The party was on the roof and the delivery man Juan was SO helpful and had absolutely no problem or issues walking all the way up there (no elevator) and setting everything up flawlessly.  The food was outstanding!

I really thought I had food poisoning; it was actually the second time we had gotten kinda sick from this place. We found it to be odd cause we had never had a problem like this before. Second incident was, a friend of ours was over and wanted to ordered pizza, he gave the person on the phone his CC # and later that night I realized they actually charged MY credit card instead of his.

My SO and I have been ordering delivery and take out from here for over 4 years now and we always loved the food and service. The owners are great, really nice and they know my SO by name by now, which is cool. However, lately the food had become terrible! In the past several months meals that we ordered for years (such as baked ziti, meatballs, etc.) have shown up tasting really bad - over cooked and burnt, or sometimes not cooked enough. At first we thought it was a fluke, but after ordering the same meals for a second and even third time to find they were no longer held to prior standards we just can't bring ourselves to order from here too much anymore. We used to order from here seriously almost every day/night for months on end for years. Another example is the chicken fingers and fries - the last time my SO ordered this it came out so bad. Even the chocolate cake is different - it feels like everything is being sloppily and hastily prepared without regard to quality. The final straw was recently when we ordered a few servings of mozzarella sticks one afternoon. We have always loved theirs over any other place in the area. This time they were seriously inedible. It did not even look as though they were trying. We don't have a lot of money to burn and we can't use our oven right now so we always enjoyed choosing them as the place to get our food from. But now, after over 4 years we can't waste our money there anymore. We always loved Gino's, but lately the food has just changed too drastically for the worse.

If you're in the mood for a meal, you can go to the sit-down restaurant on the other side of the pizzeria. There is a wide variety of pasta, heroes, and classic Italian/Italian-American dishes. They also have daily specials, which you can find on their website. All their slices are solid, but it's the Grandma that truly kicks ass. It has the perfect balance of cheese and sauce, and it's not the least bit bready or tough.The eggplant parm hero is delicious, again, with a perfect balance of cheese, sauce, and eggplant. It's also massive, as are many of the other dinners. I can destroy some eggplant, even when I'm not ravenously hungry, but I admittedly had to get the other half wrapped to go. The cavatelli with broccoli rabe, sausage, and garlic is also very well done. The pasta is tender with the right amount of chew, the broccoli rabe not bitter at all (as it can be if it's not cooked right), and all the ingredients are well-proportioned. I've also had the chicken orzo soup, which is perfect on a cold day.I used to work at a school nearby and the guys always took good care of us when we came in for dinner before parent-teacher conferences, etc. I'm happy to say that I've been back since and the staff is just as warm and welcoming as ever.",Gino’s Pizzeria,4.0 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"

The Baked Ziti Siciliana is truly a masterpiece in pasta. The eggplant is breaded and with the ziti and the mozzarella together- they truly make an Italian food heaven.

That is it's charm and the 2 brothers who usually are there running the joint - Frankie & Andrew - are very friendly and very handsome. I'm sure all these positive reviews are coming from people who know them or see them regularly. The pizza itself is nothing special. It pains me to say that because I do like the brothers. Even the shop itself is not somewhere you want to stay for very long. The adjacent place they've opened is much nicer looking but I've never seen more than 4 people seated there.

158,Wyv_L33OWXEbOexo7dcv_Q,Mags R.,5.0 star rating,"I'm picky and I have to say, it's the best pizza in Jersey City I have ever had.Pizza lover:  I'm a huge fan of their ""Grandma's Pizza"". It's always fresh, hot, and it's worth waiting for the delivery. Another thing I like is that is owned, made and run by real Italians - I feel that's getting harder to come by these days.  I want the real deal, not someones interpretation of pizza. Some ""pizzeria's"" think it's easy to make pizza - but it's not - this is real pizza, great crust, well balanced sauce and cheese -flavorful without being overpowering. Other places make up for their lack of flavor by pouring garlic powder or cheap cheese, water-down sauces - not Gino's. I would say it's as good as some New York Pizza (and I say some because even Gino's is better than some New York pizza). Try  their regular Sicilian pizza too. Other dishes we get repeatedly:  Shrimp in Diablo's, Grilled Chicken penne alla vodka, Meatball Parmigiana and Chicken Parmigiana is also very good.The Bruschetta is great as well. Their sauces are just good!!Easy delivery :  They keep your record on file - as soon as you call they know who you are and your address and credit card are on file so they got it together. Just tell them what you want and they'll tell you how many minutes.  I lived in JSQ so it was like a 45 minute delivery.  I like calling in versus doing another service because the more you make an effort to know them the better the relationship ( I like the personal touch). I also go in person and sit at the pizzeria side, but they have the restaurant at the same location opposite of the pizzeria which is warm, cozy, and intimate -you can get wine there, not sure about beer. Restaurant doesn't break the bank. I hope they continue the legacy and not sell outside the family. If so, keep it with Italians who love food, are about the ingredients and have a passion for pizza done right!",Gino’s Pizzeria,4.0 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"
159,Q6V4Jwx2PWUX97u-aQHAOA,Kelly S.,4.0 star rating,"Gino's pan pizzas deliver all the flavor of a deep dish Chicago-style pizza without all the grease. The texture of the dough is light and crispy, almost akin to foccacia, but what makes the pizza great is the very fresh and plentiful toppings. I had fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, chopped tomatoes, and what tasted like a drizzle of balsamic vinegar on mine, and it was to die for.Wanting something a little extra with my slice, I took the risk of ordering a tossed side salad--a dish that is often something of a throwaway at many Italian restaurants. This one made me want to lick the plate. Their dressing was homemade-seeming and had just the right ratio of vinegar to oil, and all of the veggies were fresh and crisp. Nothing fancy, but delicious, nonetheless.I recommend Gino's and will definitely find my way over there again soon!",Gino’s Pizzeria,4.0 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"
160,4o_7brU6TwWNlXOX2-AHnA,Audrey R.,1.0 star rating,"My friend and I decide on pizza for lunch at Gino's. In the past, we always had a great, freshly made pie. The waiter Tom, is a sweetheart and takes good care of us. We always give him a generous tip in spite of the over priced pizza.Today, I decided to order three slices, and my friend orders two. Fully knowing that behind the counter pizza is always subpar, but we were prepared to make the sacrifice.  Tom suggests that a full pie would be cheaper.  So we ordered a ""fresh"" pie - half plain, 1/4 meatball and 1/4 sausage.  Twenty minutes later, a pie shows up - that was oddly fast.At first glance I already knew the pie looked funny, but hey, this is Gino's right? We both fold our slices to eat and they start to crack and split on the bottom. The end crust was too hard to be eaten. Obviously, this was no fresh pie. We have had fresh pies there, and being a pizza lover from an Italian family you can't tell me different.  After we both consume half a slice I call Tom over and explain to him this is not a fresh pie. It is topped and recooked.  We are not happy with it.  He takes it back and says he will tell the owner.I wait as Tom informs us the owner is busy with another customer.  (Gee, I wonder why.) Tom finally says the owner ""wants to see me"".   Wants to see me? Isn't the protocol supposed to be you COME to see me? I wanted to say, ""No, tell HIM to come see ME."" But I can't do that to Tom, so I walk over to the Pizzaria side of the restaurant.  A portly old gentleman is standing next to the uneaten pie. When he realizes I am the customer he instantly gets extremely loud with me in front of his own customers! ""What do you mean this is a bad pie! Cant you see..."" So on and so forth.  This ""person"" never shook my hand, nor introduced himself. Just instant, loud arrogance.  I instantly respond with disgust, ""If that's how you are going to speak to me I'm out of here.""  When I walked away it sounded like the owner shouted, ""Don't give him his money back!"" Too late, as we never paid.I had $5 ready to leave on the table to pay for the soda's and leave Tom a little something in case this was not settled to our satisfaction.  I have enough life experience and watch enough Gordon Ramsey to know that when a restuarant fights you over your their mistake you don't want to do business with them. I seldom complain at restaurants, but when I do, I am prepared to leave and not order another thing out of fear of getting the ""secret sauce"". Out of disgust with the situation we didn't even leave the $5.I expected better from Gino's. I might expect this treatment from a disgruntled manager for hire, but not the owner. Being Italian, I have to apologize for his behavior as we are not all like the owner at Gino's.Tom is clearly embarrased and apologized as we left.  ""It wasn't your fault, Tom.""  If anything I feel sorry for Tom. He lost a good tip and Gino's has lost lifelong customers. We ended up at Portofino (Formerly Viareggio's) half a block away and had a great FRESHLY made pie at a good price. There we saw the owner cleaning his own glass door and the place was spotless. Goodbye Gino's - Hello Portofino.",Gino’s Pizzeria,4.0 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"

This time we ordered Veal Picatta and Chicken Sorrentino.  we got the veal with ziti and the chicken with the house salad, and split everything.   both meals come with bread, and you can get veggies instead of pasta if you ask.  We got two sides of bread with this as well, to soak up the sauce.We asked for the pasta with the veal, which was a good move, because the ziti came under the entree, so it was coated with picatta sauce.  The sauce for the Sorrentino was thin, but fine for the dish.  I was just glad that the ziti came with the delicious butterey lemony piccatta sauce.The veal was small tender delish pieces on top of the pasta with capers.  the chicken was two breasts pounded out with eggplant and salty  slices of prociutto with cheese and fresh tomatoes.  Everything always reaches us hot, delicious, and the only problem we've ever had is that i love diet coke and they seem to only have pepsi drinks.  no great loss.  :)the pizza's crazy delicious.  the garlic knots are perfect.  I have no issues with this place, and I recommend it to visiting friends!",Gino’s Pizzeria,4.0 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"

165,4RM-GL2MMdFKqdthmiOuPw,Heather M.,2.0 star rating,"Gino's Pizzeria was the first place I ordered delivery from when I moved to Jersey City (the night of actually). Since that first delivery I've always looked forward to the delivery men because most of the time they're friendly and sometimes crack jokes. I sometimes feel as though I'd prefer to order from Gino's just because the delivery procedure is more enjoyable and prompt even if they don't have my favorite pizza.I've had their pizza several times--I like it. It's a bit too greasy for my taste but after a night of drinking or just wanting to pig out it doesn't bother me enough to never order one again. I recently ventured outside of the pizza world and decided to try their Spaghetti Putanesca because I was suddenly CRAVING anchovies (I know, I'm gross and weird). For $11.50 I was expecting something a little spectacular. When I opened the brown bag and saw through the plastic lid I was a bit put off. I remembered looking at their website's banner and seeing semi-fancy dinnerware and wondering how they could serve this pasta on top of it without feeling self-conscious. P.S. The dinnerware in the banner and on the ""About Us"" page looks like it belongs in a Chinese or Japanese restaurant. Time to get rid of the stock photography. Getting back to the pasta itself I was desperately searching for the anchovies--where were they?! I thought perhaps they had been hardcore minced to the point where they weren't visible to the naked eye but I also couldn't taste their unmistakable fishy saltiness anywhere in the sauce.I will probably never try their pasta again because now I know it's overpriced and not worth it. I'm sure I will order from them again but I'll be sticking to pizza and perhaps a stromboli or calzone. Forgive me delivery men!",Gino’s Pizzeria,4.0 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"

Sure the people are friendly and family owned businesses are always popular, but we're talking about the pizza here. And Gino's pizza is serviceable for the Heights.
