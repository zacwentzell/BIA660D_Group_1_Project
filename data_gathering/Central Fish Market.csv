I had been eyeing it for a while but never had a chance to try. We ordered an order of fried basa with seasoned fries. $5.99! Yes $6 for that. It was enough for 2 people to eat. 2 whole basa fillets and a whole basket of fries. The basa was so soft and fresh. They have tartar, sriracha, ketchup, vinegar and anything you may needed on deck. The staff which I believe are the owners are really nice. We didn't speak to them much but I saw how they treated all the regulars that came in and they were so nice and smiled at everyone! It's a nice family that work well together!",Central Fish Market,4.5 star rating,$$,"Seafood, Markets,, Seafood"

2,frKtyu5beDG87yGiMWv0Ug,Mahmoud S.,5.0 star rating,Clean food at the most reasonable prices around when it comes to fish. Fried or grilled shrimp are great with big portions. Fried fish with white sauce is also pretty great. Salad rice and French fries available with order. All in all solid place for a good lunch.,Central Fish Market,4.5 star rating,$$,"Seafood, Markets,, Seafood"

4,CLby1rP4dKTsPX0h32FMCA,Mia M.,5.0 star rating,Lunch with a Friend. Got the Shrimp with frues and Bass with fries. Perfect. The bass was really good. She practically gave a whole lemon which I used to put all over the fish; I loved it. I want to put black pepper on my french fries but then noticed that it wasn't pepper it was actually cumin and that's what they like to put on the fish... and it was actually really good with a little bit of lemon. Should've known better it's  Arabic style and the best way to eat Seafood!,Central Fish Market,4.5 star rating,$$,"Seafood, Markets,, Seafood"
5,2WBn_E8NsULNA7SRpFzGJA,Muhenned S.,5.0 star rating,"This little place has Incredible grilled bronzini, fried shrimp and calamari. The grilled salmon is also the best I've ever had, and I've been to high end restaurants in Edgewater and other places. The salad is great with its lemon and oil dressing, and the brown rice never disappoints. If you are getting take out, its best to eat within 15 minutes to experience seafood at its best. Eating in maybe comfortable for small groups",Central Fish Market,4.5 star rating,$$,"Seafood, Markets,, Seafood"
6,d2AH_5GUjLZwKzW7hkyESw,Louise R.,5.0 star rating,"We walked by and the signs looked very appetizing also the prices were super cheap. The place looks like a fixer upper but it's clean. I used the bathroom to wash my hands and that was also clean. Although surrounded by fish laid out next to us on the freezer, there's not a strong fish smell. Fresh fish and huge portions!! (6.99$ for 12 shrimp and fries) Prices are super reasonable and staff is very nice!",Central Fish Market,4.5 star rating,$$,"Seafood, Markets,, Seafood"
7,ccSK7SyA-6bvwk34xxlgSQ,Ayman B.,4.0 star rating,When I am craving a whole fish barbecued middle eastern style central fish market is my go. This is not your regular fish store.

9,tjdmCXCZIb4F3B2QoDRaYw,Miranda B.,5.0 star rating,"OK, alittle trivia heads-up for those who are movie buffs.The movie ""CAUGHT"" was filmed and based upon this very establishment...and it was quite good too, honestly.It stars Edward James Almos and Maria Conchita Alonzo and alot of the scenes are shot here but purely based on JERSEY CITY. It's not a new flick, but it's cool if you want to see familiar places of JC and also scenes of  the Twin Towers as the stood.As for the fish here...yes, it's very fresh indeed!",Central Fish Market,4.5 star rating,$$,"Seafood, Markets,, Seafood"
10,7LiNUplBJggNBOcnutORFg,Cyndi E.,1.0 star rating,"I stopped by this place looking for salmon.  I walked in and it looks dirty and empty...not much fish.  They have more beverages than anything.The fish theydid have looked fresh (talapia, red snapper, shrimp)...but it wasn't much of a selection.The woman working there was very nice though and even asked a guy if they had salmon.  I won't be rushing back there unless I hear that they clean up the shop and get more selection.",Central Fish Market,4.5 star rating,$$,"Seafood, Markets,, Seafood"
