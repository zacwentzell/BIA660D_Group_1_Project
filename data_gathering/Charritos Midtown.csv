One of the differences is everything seems to be a buck or two more than the other two. Bigger space, higher rent I guess. They did a good job renovating the space and expanded the ""bar area"" (still BYOB) a bit. Now the food, we came for brunch, it looked to be a similar menu but this time they actually had the steak torta, the uptown charrittos has NEVER had it in at least a dozen times trying to order it. It was pretty tasty, a little too much mayo but overall very good. These come with kinda like ribbon fries instead of rice and beans which I liked. The wife got the chorizo torta and it was the same as the other locations, but very good.The salsa was very different it was more watery and seemed more like a sauce than salsa, this I wasn't a fan of and they give you a tiny little ramekin of it to start, it's hard to dip. Service was a little better than just order, drop off food after 4 minutes and then check. They actually were friendly.

The hostess was polite and seated us right away. After we were seated a party of about 10 was seated behind us; immediately they were loud and obnoxious. At first, we weren't bothered because it had seemed as if they were old friends regathering and were catching up. It was cute, at first, but soon became rude. Every other word was the f-bomb and were screaming to the point that my family and I couldn't hear each other, being no less than two feet apart. Our waiter seemed to notice that were quickly getting annoyed, especially after their stories that were far too inappropriate for a public restaurant, yet had done nothing about it. Although the social experience was not the best, the food was quite delicious, may have been better if we were able to hear how great the food was while we were eating.",Charritos Midtown,2.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

To top it off the food was very disappointing. We both had enchiladas and they were served Luke warm and smothered with so much sauce you could barely find the enchiladas.

We got a pitcher of sangria (it was delicious) with the wine that we brought. There were 6 of us. We got 2 orders of guac for the table, which he made in front of us. While looking over the menu, the waiter came over to let us know that while they are not listed on the menu, we could get a burrito, quesadilla, or fajitas. That was a game changer. A few of us got steak quesadillas, 1 ordered chicken, and 2 got the chicken and shrimp fajitas. Everyone enjoyed their food! We weren't rushed out and stayed for a while after we were done eating.

37,olfNGmslinWyRBMpnT-3PQ,Gina R.,3.0 star rating,"February 17th, my family and I decided to go out to eat. We had decided to go to Charritos Midtown due to the convenient location. The hostess was polite and seated us right away. After we were seated a party of about 10 was seated behind us; immediately they were loud and obnoxious. At first, we weren't bothered because it had seemed as if they were old friends regathering and were catching up. It was cute, at first, but soon became rude. Every other word was the f-bomb and were screaming to the point that my family and I couldn't hear each other, being no less than two feet apart. Our waiter seemed to notice that were quickly getting annoyed, especially after their stories that were far too inappropriate for a public restaurant, yet had done nothing about it. Although the social experience was not the best, the food was quite delicious, may have been better if we were able to hear how great the food was while we were eating.",Charritos Midtown,2.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

Service was terrible - our table was uneven and wobbling and we asked the server if there was something we could put under it. She brought back a piece of cardboard and put it under the table. Unfortunately the table was still wobbling so we asked for another fix and she said ""it's fine it's not wobbling side to side anymore just forward and back"" ......ok weird answer and still wobbling. To top it off the food was very disappointing. We both had enchiladas and they were served Luke warm and smothered with so much sauce you could barely find the enchiladas. Appetizer was the queso and thank god we had that because it was the only thing worth two stars. Will not be coming back here.",Charritos Midtown,2.5 star rating,$$,Mexican
39,tTijKQzachJ3ixw0SESzeQ,Rachel R.,4.0 star rating,"I had low expectations based on the other reviews of this place. We almost switched to another restaurant but we decided to give it a shot. The decor was very cute and at 7:30 on a Weds night there was no wait. There was outdoor and indoor seating available. We were seated right away and our waiter was very attentive. We got a pitcher of sangria (it was delicious) with the wine that we brought. There were 6 of us. We got 2 orders of guac for the table, which he made in front of us. While looking over the menu, the waiter came over to let us know that while they are not listed on the menu, we could get a burrito, quesadilla, or fajitas. That was a game changer. A few of us got steak quesadillas, 1 ordered chicken, and 2 got the chicken and shrimp fajitas. Everyone enjoyed their food! We weren't rushed out and stayed for a while after we were done eating. I have been to the downtown location on numerous occasions and this was just as good, if not better because you are not sitting on top of the neighboring table. If you go, make sure you ask about their ""not listed menu items.""",Charritos Midtown,2.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

It was 6pm on a Wednesday, totally dead except two tables.  The woman told us to wait for the rest of our party first, we asked if we could even come inside of the foyer since it's cold outside, she had to ask the manager who said we could only wait at the bar.  Fine.  The place was basically empty except for two tables only.  Our friends we late, we waited standing for over 20 minutes which is hard with a baby but that's fine since it was our friend's fault they were late, not the restaurant.  Then the rest of our party messaged me that they were less than 5 minutes away, so we told the woman this and asked if we could sit down now and start ordering food because the baby is heavy and we wanted to order and everyone else would be here in a few minutes, she said nope, the manager explicitly said no. We said seriously, we just want to sit down in the empty room and order food and she still was very snotty and said no we are not allowed.  We said we would have to leave because we were lirterally tired of standing in an empty restaurant and our whole 9 person party would go elsewhere.  She could care less.  So fine, we left.  Does this restaurant really want to be empty when they could have had 9 people at 6:30 on a dead night?",Charritos Midtown,2.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

49,TntOllVtJCo3x6xeEbZ_vw,Mike G.,3.0 star rating,"As someone who regards charritos as a 5 star establishment, this is my honest assessment of why I would give it 3.5 stars... if I could. Sangria- same as the other signature locations, however the fruit is scarce. Bring an extra apple if you are looking to fulfill your daily intake of vitamin a.  The pitcher itself was a little basic as well, I perfer a more spanish-styled vessel. Guacamole - Very good, however they must get  their avacados from the preemie ward.  Either that or the pits are big enough that they plan on opening a skee ball arcade upstairs. Main course - Rico can only be in three locations at once. He won't even make a cameo if you ask for him off the menu. How can they even name this place something that rhymes with burritos, without a single burrito on the menu? But I digress... Naturally the next best option was alambre- steak, bacon, peppers, and cheese. Muy Bueno- the ingredients speak for themselves. Ambience - there's room for 300 plates on the wall, but they only chose to install 10, which leaves much to be desired. The ones they chose are very nice, they must be picky- I respect that. The exposed sheetrock makes adds to the authenticity. Misc- The table was slightly wobbly, a few coasters could have fixed that. In conclusion, if you like your avacados big, sangria fruitful, a lot of plates in your wall, sturdy tables, and expect what's on the menu to rhyme the name of your restaurant - the uptown or downtown locations will fulfill your wildest dreams.",Charritos Midtown,2.5 star rating,$$,Mexican
50,dzAtif0QzC_R7WIcNyYyRw,Hannah H.,2.0 star rating,"I LOVED Sabores and was very disappointed when they closed, but I was excited to have a spacious Charritos take its' place. The inside is very pretty, but that's about the only redeeming quality. The guacamole portion is small compared the downtown and uptown locations and they only make it table side if they feel like it. They also changed the menu. There are no burritos - NO BURRITOS. They also do not have a single vegetarian item (aside from two salads) on the menu and were annoyed when I asked if something could be made without meat. My friend asked if the toppings for the taquitos could be put on the side and they said no. What? You can't put the sauce and lettuce on the side? Come on. I was a server for a long time and know customers can get ridiculous with their requests/substitutions/etc, but these did not seem like outlandish things to me.I'm not sure what they are trying to do at this location, but I won't be back to find out.",Charritos Midtown,2.5 star rating,$$,Mexican

53,hekqlmg_1CeXsa5GtcDbpg,Elizabeth K.,5.0 star rating,"Just a few weeks before my wedding I had my caterer cancel. I walked into Charritos that same day and worked with Uzi who helped cater a menu specific to our vision and did a sampling that same evening. In the sampling we tried less taco/burrito and more authentic - like a delicious chicken in a cream sauce with corn and spices. Still we wanted some tacos on the menu and Uzi made it happen, no problem. Uzi was professional and extremely friendly the entire time. His staff worked really hard at the wedding and the food was plentiful and delicious - everyone raved about the guacamole (sooo good!) and I loved how he set up the little appetizers so beautifully. We had both meat and veggie options and the buffet line moved quickly. I'll always be grateful for their help to make my wedding unique and keep everyone fed. Plus I finally got to visit their Weehawken and the location is top notch with great city views. It's no wonder this restaurant gets to keep expanding in the Hoboken area.

The queso (melted cheese) was hardly melted at all. Being from Texas, I would have been happy with a simple Velveeta, chilies and tomatoes but this was so greasy and thick I could barely get it on a chip. The guac was good, but we had to order 2 bowls for 4 people - if you're going to serve it in a massive bowl, at least fill it half way. Fajitas were OK.
