Yet at Catch, they have 3 vegan specialties, in addition to several other menu items that state they can be made vegan. A lot of the sides are also vegan. They also list what is gluten-free, making this an awesome place for people with dietary restrictions to eat with a group of people. MUST TRY: crispy cauliflower. It looked like fried shrimp, but instead it was delicious crispy little bites of fried cauliflower coated in a flavorful and slightly spicy sauce (tasted like sweet and sour almost). I also really loved the hearts of palm vegan ""crab cake"". Such an interesting texture that mimics flaky crab. The sweet potato gnocchi was delicious and is more filling that the other two vegan dishes. The dishes was $20-$22 each so it is on the pricey side. I wouldn't get all three if you were eating them by yourself!It does get VERY crowded at peak times such as friday/weekend dinner- so be sure to make a reservation. The tables were packed and kind of small so you might have to squish.Great drink menu + non alcoholic drinks as well. I enjoyed my Revitalizer juice a lot (carrot + apple + ginger).

Technically our reservation was for 9:15PM but we wound up arriving about an hour earlier & fortunately they were able to seat us. Breakdown below. Pros Drinks - the drinks here are pretty good and pack a punch. Service - loved our server, she knew the menu well and had great recommendations. Atmosphere/decor - Sexy yet comfy. Definitely a fun atmosphere.Meh The food - we ordered a ton of food, the MRC roll, octopus, bao buns, wagyu tacos & the whole dorado but nothing on this menu wowed me. On top of that for the prices you could definitely find better seafood restaurants. The dorado was drenched in a lemon butter sauce. The sauce was good but it should've just had a few drops/been seasoned with it vs drowning in the sauce. I couldn't actually taste the fish. The whole time I was thinking, I wish I had some mashed potatoes to smother in that sauce. Cons Truffle Sashimi - so normally love truffle with most foods but doesn't work with a good piece of sashimi. The tuna on it's own was flavorful & the truffle just overwhelmed the fish. Totally not worth it. Overall my experience here was underwhelming. I'd come here for drinks but not dinner.

Place was pretty crowded but it was a nice crowd. Good feeling. Our server Clarissa who was very sweet and informative was great!! Trusted all of her recommendations and they were right on point!!  We were a party of 6. We all had something different. The truffle fries were delicious. The avocado toast was very filling and tasty. Had a nice mixture of pomegranate seeds and almonds mixed in the avocado. We chose to have our eggs scrambled on top instead of the poached that was on the menu. Very good. They were cooked to perfection. I had the beef sandwich. Clarissa recommended it and said it was amazing and guess what? IT WAS AMAZING!!! Enjoyed every moment of it. The lobster Mac n cheese was very good also and filling. My girlfriend had the grilled octopus which I also had a taste of and it was tasty. A couple of friends had the lobster roll which was also mouth watering. Everything we had was very delicious.

9,DDWTRX_3-y1KsL0598qupA,Joy G.,3.0 star rating,"Catch is very, very good for two things: (1) people-watching in an eye-catching doozy of a space and (2) eating small amounts of food and shuddering at how much damage you're racking up. On this side of the Meatpacking District, you will get a stare-down if you come in wearing slightly scuffed sneakers. I came on a ridiculously rain-soaked evening, yet I was the only one looking like a drowned rat in the whole dining room. Everyone else seemed perfectly dry and well-coiffed. It was something out of the Twilight Zone. Second, the food was tasty but ... well, I don't have the biggest appetite in the world but I was left feeling disoriented when, after eating three appetizers and two large plates, I felt like I could have used a hamburger. Of the appetizers, the ceviche was the best, though the blood orange ponzu was an interesting ingredient choice, as the citrus/acidity didn't really fit the crab and lobster.  Also tried the Catch Roll, which was extremely basic, and the Crunchy Rice Cakes, which were about the size of my hand. C'mon. And I will say that we only ordered the rice cakes because the waiter seemed personally put off by the fact that we only wanted two apps and one entree and no drinks. So, like a golden retriever practically shaking with the need to please, I caved. If it weren't for the prices, the menu feels like it's from a Thai/Chinese/Japanese place that tries to cover everything and doesn't do anything well.The dorado came soaked in butter and oil. It was seriously like ordering a plate of butter with a side of fish. Throughout the whole meal, I was trying to gauge whether the other customers were really that satiated by a few bites of oily fish or just really good at masking their hunger. The Hit Me was amazing, though. It is the sole reason why Catch is getting three stars instead of two. And people can obviously do whatever they want but I felt a bit sad at seeing tables ordering this chocolate concoction from the heavens, whacking at it for the Insta, and then not eating a bite. This has nothing to do with Catch, just thought I'd throw it out there.",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

Honestly really loved all of the above. Drinks are pretty good as well, wasn't a huge fan of my drink off the menu but they made a mean dirty martini. Our waiter was a sweetheart too. My only issue was the manager who was a tad rude: first she was interrogating us about our select membership (which offered a complimentary champagne) - but I guess that's her job,  but then she told us to take pictures elsewhere - which was just hilarious more than anything else.

It's in a nice location and the restaurant has a nice view and a rooftop bar but that's about it. The ambience was very cool and chill. I came here with my husband and his cousin. I picked this place because of course me being a foodie and watching Food Network, I saw Catch on there. It was on Guilty Pleasure. Tia Mowry loves their Lobster Mac & Cheese, and I must admit it looked great on tv. Therefore, I put it on my ""to try"" list while in New York. It was a great experience as far as mixing and mingling but the food was just average. My husband and I started off by ordering drinks. He ordered an Old Fashion and I ordered the Savannah Sipper. He enjoyed his Old Fashioned as it's his go to. The Savannah Sipper didn't have alcohol and it's their play on an Arnold Palmer. It was good, not to sweet but sweet enough. I enjoyed it. It was light and refreshing. My husband wanted some sushi so he ordered the California Roll. It was a typical California Roll, nothing special. It wasn't bad but there was no special flare or ingredient. We also ordered the Lobster Mac & Cheese because that's honestly what I came there for since I saw it on tv. Well looks can be deceiving and in this case the tv version was. It honestly wasn't anything special. It was elbow macaroni with a cheese sauce and lobster pieces with bread crumbs on top. It wasn't bad but definitely not what I expected it to be. No special taste because of the cheese sauce nor anything special about the lobster. It definitely looked a lot better than it tasted. It also could have used a tad more seasoning. My husband and I wanted to try an entree so we ordered one and shared. By now we weren't full but we weren't completely starving. We ordered the Organic Crispy Chicken. It came with roasted vegetables and thyme jus (sauce). This was actually pretty good. The chicken was stuffed with herbs which added a nice pop of flavor. The jus and vegetables were good as well. The chicken was cooked perfect and was super tender, juicy and moist. Considering I have a sweet tooth. I definitely wanted dessert. My husband and I normally share but he left me hanging this night. I ordered the ""Hit Me"" Chocolate Cake . It consisted of Liquid ""Klondike"" Roasted White Chocolate Ice Cream, Brownie & Devil's Food. The ""Liquid Klondike"" is in a chocolate shell that they break with a spoon when the dessert arrives to your table. The dessert was ok. It looks really pretty but the taste was average. The cake could have been a tad more moist. It was a little on the dry side. The chocolate shell added a nice crunch. Overall, it wasn't bad but it was average. Overall, I had a good time with my husband and his cousin at Catch. The food wasn't great but not horrible. I doubt I come back just because there are too many other good restaurants.

The catch roll is nothing special. The mahi mahi wonton tacos were average. The A5 Japanese Miyazaki Wagyu was amazing! My mom was recently in Japan and compared the flavor and texture of the dish to what she had over there. The parmesan-truffle fries is also a must. We ordered the Hit Me chocolate cake and it was so much fun getting violent with a dessert. Never thought I'd say that sentence. Five dishes and one dessert were enough for the three of us.

I've heard about Catch and it seemed like a nice place to dine, knowing the prices were high I always wanted to try the Crunchy Shrimp & the Hit Me Cake. So we ordered the Shrimp which was delicious, the Lobster Mac and Cheese that was so dull and had no taste. (Dig Inn has better Mac and cheese than this place) & these chicken sandwiches that were nothing special and could find better ones at Chinatown ps: we were charged $25 for the plate when it's $15. What made it worse was the waiter (who seemed very young and only caring about how much he was going to make that night) At first he acted very nice and kind and told us catch ""was a place for tapas and to share"" so we ordered 3 things to share. And after we started eating he started to act rude and whenever we would say thank you for something he would bring or asked for refills he wouldn't say anything but a nod. Nice way to communicate with customers. In the end he asked us ""all done?"" I said yes, and removed the plates. And then the table next to us he asked two ladies ""are you ladies all done, could I get you anything else?"" automatically he didn't like our table for no reason at all and just wanted to get it done and over with. I was going to order the Hit Me Cake but after experiencing that behavior from a waiter and being first time customers just showed how the restaurants environment is. I will never come here again, and probably don't recommend it to anyone unless they want to pay $91 for THREE little small plates to share.

I was pretty frustrated that despite having a reservation, we were given a buzzer and had to wait almost 25 minutes, which seems to defeat the purpose of having a reservation, especially because based on other reviews, if you're at all late, they give you a pretty hard time. However, our server more than made up for it as he was extremely friendly and knowledgable. The menu is a little over whelming and large, so if you're not sure of what you want, I would definitely take a look at Yelp pictures and reviews to see what other's have liked as it can definitely take a while to navigate the menu on it's own and portion sizes varied significantly so it's hard to tell what is a substantial dish and what is only a few bites! Our waiter helped us narrow down what we were looking for, but we ended up getting the crispy shrimp which was the biggest portion out of everything, the tartare trio and the crunchy rice cakes (they gave us 4 as it was 4 of us but I believe they give you enough for everyone depending on how many people you're with). I also am pretty sure we got short rib tacos or something along those lines, but I'm not seeing it on the online menu to reference. Either way it was our least favorite dish, so not worth digging to try to figure out what it was. For dessert, we got the s'mores pizza, which was great but large and probably not something for less than 4 people! Everything was really great and flavorful.

The sauce was good but it should've just had a few drops/been seasoned with it vs drowning in the sauce. I couldn't actually taste the fish. The whole time I was thinking, I wish I had some mashed potatoes to smother in that sauce. Cons Truffle Sashimi - so normally love truffle with most foods but doesn't work with a good piece of sashimi. The tuna on it's own was flavorful & the truffle just overwhelmed the fish. Totally not worth it. Overall my experience here was underwhelming. I'd come here for drinks but not dinner.

Place was pretty crowded but it was a nice crowd. Good feeling. Our server Clarissa who was very sweet and informative was great!! Trusted all of her recommendations and they were right on point!!  We were a party of 6. We all had something different. The truffle fries were delicious. The avocado toast was very filling and tasty. Had a nice mixture of pomegranate seeds and almonds mixed in the avocado. We chose to have our eggs scrambled on top instead of the poached that was on the menu. Very good. They were cooked to perfection. I had the beef sandwich. Clarissa recommended it and said it was amazing and guess what? IT WAS AMAZING!!! Enjoyed every moment of it. The lobster Mac n cheese was very good also and filling. My girlfriend had the grilled octopus which I also had a taste of and it was tasty. A couple of friends had the lobster roll which was also mouth watering. Everything we had was very delicious.

29,DDWTRX_3-y1KsL0598qupA,Joy G.,3.0 star rating,"Catch is very, very good for two things: (1) people-watching in an eye-catching doozy of a space and (2) eating small amounts of food and shuddering at how much damage you're racking up. On this side of the Meatpacking District, you will get a stare-down if you come in wearing slightly scuffed sneakers. I came on a ridiculously rain-soaked evening, yet I was the only one looking like a drowned rat in the whole dining room. Everyone else seemed perfectly dry and well-coiffed. It was something out of the Twilight Zone. Second, the food was tasty but ... well, I don't have the biggest appetite in the world but I was left feeling disoriented when, after eating three appetizers and two large plates, I felt like I could have used a hamburger. Of the appetizers, the ceviche was the best, though the blood orange ponzu was an interesting ingredient choice, as the citrus/acidity didn't really fit the crab and lobster.  Also tried the Catch Roll, which was extremely basic, and the Crunchy Rice Cakes, which were about the size of my hand. C'mon. And I will say that we only ordered the rice cakes because the waiter seemed personally put off by the fact that we only wanted two apps and one entree and no drinks. So, like a golden retriever practically shaking with the need to please, I caved. If it weren't for the prices, the menu feels like it's from a Thai/Chinese/Japanese place that tries to cover everything and doesn't do anything well.The dorado came soaked in butter and oil. It was seriously like ordering a plate of butter with a side of fish. Throughout the whole meal, I was trying to gauge whether the other customers were really that satiated by a few bites of oily fish or just really good at masking their hunger. The Hit Me was amazing, though. It is the sole reason why Catch is getting three stars instead of two. And people can obviously do whatever they want but I felt a bit sad at seeing tables ordering this chocolate concoction from the heavens, whacking at it for the Insta, and then not eating a bite.

Honestly really loved all of the above. Drinks are pretty good as well, wasn't a huge fan of my drink off the menu but they made a mean dirty martini. Our waiter was a sweetheart too. My only issue was the manager who was a tad rude: first she was interrogating us about our select membership (which offered a complimentary champagne) - but I guess that's her job,  but then she told us to take pictures elsewhere - which was just hilarious more than anything else.

It's in a nice location and the restaurant has a nice view and a rooftop bar but that's about it. The ambience was very cool and chill. I came here with my husband and his cousin. I picked this place because of course me being a foodie and watching Food Network, I saw Catch on there. It was on Guilty Pleasure. Tia Mowry loves their Lobster Mac & Cheese, and I must admit it looked great on tv. Therefore, I put it on my ""to try"" list while in New York. It was a great experience as far as mixing and mingling but the food was just average. My husband and I started off by ordering drinks. He ordered an Old Fashion and I ordered the Savannah Sipper. He enjoyed his Old Fashioned as it's his go to. The Savannah Sipper didn't have alcohol and it's their play on an Arnold Palmer. It was good, not to sweet but sweet enough. I enjoyed it. It was light and refreshing. My husband wanted some sushi so he ordered the California Roll. It was a typical California Roll, nothing special. It wasn't bad but there was no special flare or ingredient. We also ordered the Lobster Mac & Cheese because that's honestly what I came there for since I saw it on tv. Well looks can be deceiving and in this case the tv version was. It honestly wasn't anything special. It was elbow macaroni with a cheese sauce and lobster pieces with bread crumbs on top. It wasn't bad but definitely not what I expected it to be. No special taste because of the cheese sauce nor anything special about the lobster. It definitely looked a lot better than it tasted. It also could have used a tad more seasoning. My husband and I wanted to try an entree so we ordered one and shared. By now we weren't full but we weren't completely starving. We ordered the Organic Crispy Chicken. It came with roasted vegetables and thyme jus (sauce). This was actually pretty good. The chicken was stuffed with herbs which added a nice pop of flavor. The jus and vegetables were good as well. The chicken was cooked perfect and was super tender, juicy and moist. Considering I have a sweet tooth. I definitely wanted dessert. My husband and I normally share but he left me hanging this night. I ordered the ""Hit Me"" Chocolate Cake . It consisted of Liquid ""Klondike"" Roasted White Chocolate Ice Cream, Brownie & Devil's Food. The ""Liquid Klondike"" is in a chocolate shell that they break with a spoon when the dessert arrives to your table. The dessert was ok. It looks really pretty but the taste was average. The cake could have been a tad more moist. It was a little on the dry side. The chocolate shell added a nice crunch. Overall, it wasn't bad but it was average. Overall, I had a good time with my husband and his cousin at Catch. The food wasn't great but not horrible. I doubt I come back just because there are too many other good restaurants.

My mom was recently in Japan and compared the flavor and texture of the dish to what she had over there. The parmesan-truffle fries is also a must. We ordered the Hit Me chocolate cake and it was so much fun getting violent with a dessert. Never thought I'd say that sentence. Five dishes and one dessert were enough for the three of us.

So we ordered the Shrimp which was delicious, the Lobster Mac and Cheese that was so dull and had no taste. (Dig Inn has better Mac and cheese than this place) & these chicken sandwiches that were nothing special and could find better ones at Chinatown ps: we were charged $25 for the plate when it's $15. What made it worse was the waiter (who seemed very young and only caring about how much he was going to make that night) At first he acted very nice and kind and told us catch ""was a place for tapas and to share"" so we ordered 3 things to share. And after we started eating he started to act rude and whenever we would say thank you for something he would bring or asked for refills he wouldn't say anything but a nod. Nice way to communicate with customers. In the end he asked us ""all done?"" I said yes, and removed the plates. And then the table next to us he asked two ladies ""are you ladies all done, could I get you anything else?"" automatically he didn't like our table for no reason at all and just wanted to get it done and over with. I was going to order the Hit Me Cake but after experiencing that behavior from a waiter and being first time customers just showed how the restaurants environment is.

I was pretty frustrated that despite having a reservation, we were given a buzzer and had to wait almost 25 minutes, which seems to defeat the purpose of having a reservation, especially because based on other reviews, if you're at all late, they give you a pretty hard time. However, our server more than made up for it as he was extremely friendly and knowledgable. The menu is a little over whelming and large, so if you're not sure of what you want, I would definitely take a look at Yelp pictures and reviews to see what other's have liked as it can definitely take a while to navigate the menu on it's own and portion sizes varied significantly so it's hard to tell what is a substantial dish and what is only a few bites! Our waiter helped us narrow down what we were looking for, but we ended up getting the crispy shrimp which was the biggest portion out of everything, the tartare trio and the crunchy rice cakes (they gave us 4 as it was 4 of us but I believe they give you enough for everyone depending on how many people you're with). I also am pretty sure we got short rib tacos or something along those lines, but I'm not seeing it on the online menu to reference. Either way it was our least favorite dish, so not worth digging to try to figure out what it was.

Delicious.Food: For appetizers, we could not decide! All menu options looked so tempting. After much deliberation, we decided to get the steamed mussels. So. Good.  We were so close in ordering another one because it was that good. For entrees, I got the snapper and my boyfriend got the filet mignon.

Snapper was fresh and delicious. But, if you're a meat lover, don't pass up the filet mignon, you'll thank me later. For dessert, we ordered the signature ""Hit Me.""

All that is great and exciting, but it falls short elsewhere. Made reservations for 8:15 and we were seated at 8:30. Our waitress, Paula, was slow, impersonal, and didn't even introduce herself. She never came by to check on us. She was nowhere to be found when we wanted our bill. It just felt like we were unwelcome here, and like she did not care. We ordered the cod lettuce wraps to start. If you want to be healthy and low-carb, this is a good option, but the cod is very salty. Then we ordered the Catch roll and the Mango Shrimp roll. The portion sizes are kind of a joke. You're not even gonna give us a full roll? For the Catch roll, they use one of those fire tools on it once they bring it out to you, which is cool to see I guess, but there's literally nothing in the roll that needs to be fired up. It left it with a burning aftertaste so it seems pointless. The Mango Shrimp roll was delicious, but with only four pieces to a roll, at these prices, how is one supposed to get filled? My company surely wasn't full after the roll. I felt awful for choosing this place. We ate in under ten minutes and left. At the end, when a manager came by to ask if we wanted dessert, and we said no, he left without a word, as if he couldn't wait til we left and how dare we not order dessert. It was extremely snooty.

55,PY-XIZ9KX4xZ0WFT6RaFLg,Jessica D.,4.0 star rating,"This place is quite lovely, but it's more like a 3.5 star rating. I had my prebirthday dinner here with my boyfriend and my sister. I really recommend the sushi if you come here, although it is ridiculously priced and you only get 5 pieces. I mean, everything is ridiculously priced. We sat outside and the service was quite good. It's annoyingly loud inside and somewhat the outside if you sit next to the music playing in your ears or the restaurant/bar across the street blasting their music. MRC Roll ($18)-5/5 This was delicious, the tuna is not stringy or chewy. There was some crunchy stuff on top, which gave it a nice texture. Catch Roll ($19)- 5/5 I thought this was going to be raw salmon but they actually torch it, which was a nice touch to it. This was really good, loved the miso honey.  Crispy shrimp ($23)- 4/5 This was pretty good, your typical crispy shrimp but only at a higher price. And maybe a little bit spicier too. A decent portion size to share with 2-3 people maybe. Mahi Mahi Wonton Tacos ($19)- 5/5 Everyone in my table loved this the most, including me. Crispy wonton shell with juicy mahi mahi inside and topped with guacomole, pickled onions, tomatillo. Crunchy Rice Cakes ($19)- 3/5 I was really excited to try this but I ended up being disappointed. They give you 3 crunchy rice cakes and there's really not a crazy amount of flavor. Everything was fried so there's really just a fried/oil sort of taste. Grilled Spanish Octopus ($19)-4/5 Portion was a bit on the smaller side but still really delicious. The octopus was crispy on the outside but tender on the inside. The potatoes were good but not great. Lobster Mac & Cheese ($23)- 3/5 The biggest letdown was probably this popular dish. Really not worth the rave. There's absolutely ZERO lobster in this. Maybe they use lobster sauce but very misleading. The pasta looked like it came straight from a box. This was not bad, but really left us unimpressed and very basic. Sauteed Wild-Caught Local Snapper ($39)- 3/5 Lobster mash was so/so, again, I could not tell if there was actually lobster in this- it was merely orange. The fish had a crispy skin and was tender inside. The combination was probably a little odd. There's this black sesame looking sauce next to it which was definitely not good with it.""Hit Me"" Chocolate Cake ($16)- 4/5 My boyfriend loved this, and it was quite fun to hit it and have watch chocolate being poured over it. I'm not crazy about this sort of chocolate so I had a couple of bites, it is overall good but maybe too sweet for my liking.

When you enter, there are couple of elevators. The restaurant is on the second floor, which is clearly indicated in and outside of the elevator. The inside was completely empty, well there was another couple who went in before us, as we got there just as they opened up for the day. I heard one of the kitchen staff yelling ""why are they sending up people already??? We are not ready!!!"" We (and another couple) were already in, and hostess was more than happy to show us to our table. They had a huge bar, which was a sushi counter. And yes, they do offer sushi there. The counter was pretty fancy, maybe marble? Traditional or old-fashion sushi counter would be made of wood, so this was very different... Since we were there for the Restaurant Week, we sat at a table, and not at the sushi counter. Each table had a metal serving stand, which was interesting. BUT, they were wobbly and unstable. I checked on other tables, and they were wobbly too. It also was kind of hard to eat around it, but then when the table next to us ordered a sushi roll that requires torch to be used at the table, that made sense...kind of...The Restaurant Week menu for the brunch was a bit disappointing. For the main course, Well, it was a brunch, and therefore they were offering brunch items like pancakes, croque madame, and chicken salad... But we were there for seafood, so we didn't want any of these offering. We chose limited seafood offerings, and ordered Salmon Belly Carpaccio, MRC Roll, Simply Grilled Salmon A La Plancha, Grilled Mahi Mahi, S'Mores Pizza, and Fresh Baked Cookies. The food was ok, nothing too special. S'Mores Pizza was the highlight of our meal.

Upon arriving, we were instructed by a friendly greeter to take the elevator to the second floor. We checked in for our meal and were quickly dismissed. Despite the fact that it was a Monday night, the restaurant was packed, the lights were dim and the techno music was loud. We waited for about 15 minutes beyond our reservation time before being seated.Once seated, we were dismayed to find out that the people next to us at the banquet had decided to both sit on the booth side of the table, which crowded our seating area. The waiter did not seem to care when we brought this inconvenience to his attention. We reviewed the menus given to us but were unable to find the special restaurant week menu listed anywhere. After flipping through the menu pages a few times, the waiter came over and said, ""you must be looking for these!"" as he dangled the menus above our heads. We felt this was pretty rude as Restaurant Week is heavily advertised and we should not be made to feel we're ordering off the ""cheap"" menu. The rest of the service was fine, as was the food. The portions seemed to be a bit smaller than what you would get if ordering off the regular menu. We started with their famous Spicy Shrimp and MRC Roll, which were great as always. For the next course we had Salmon a la Plancha which was cooked well, but incredibly small - about 4 oz - along with the Chicken Lettuce Cups, which I found to be quite overseasoned. For dessert we split the S'mores Pizza, which was fine, but nothing special and an order of cookies, which they packed up for us to go. Overall, the experience was okay but definitely would have been better if we were in the mood to go out or see and be seen!

Great food, drinks, nightlife, lots of activity, plenty of sightseeing and people watching if your into catching a glimpse at a celebrity or two. Catch itself is huge and after you take the elevator ride up to the second floor you'll be bombarded by thirsty people hovering around the bar area trying to grab drinks and people trying to get their names in for a table. There is also ""Catch Rooftop"" which is a smaller upstairs area with standing room by the bar, and a couple tables and seats. A small portion of tables are outside as well. pretty 3rd floor viewing perspective of Meatpacking. If in a group of two you with no reservations you might enjoy sitting at the one area of the bar where the chefs make the sushi and other fresh dishes. This area isn't too busy and they also have a full menu there. While seated I must have seen 10 or more ""Truffle Sashimi"" dishes prepped up. I will definitely want to try that next. We started with two amazing drinks, a ""MeatPacking Manhattan"" (which was served in a Catch flask you could take home with you) and a ""Trap Queen"" (Which was super girly and had a mermaid on the straw lol) Next we both ordered the ""Detox Retox"" which was really the most tasty grassy Matcha George Clooney tequila drink I've ever tasted. (That one is served in a mason jar with a green and white bendy straw) Prob my favorite drink too. For food I had an order of Crunchy Rice Cakes which consists of tuna tartare and wasabi tobiko. They were too good. like way better than they look and totally worth whatever they cost. That was a must. Then we had a Catch Roll and an order of Lobster Mac & Cheese which had mascarpone cheese and a TON of lobster in it. Also totally worth it. To finish the night off We split the famous #HITME cake which gets served by your waiter and then ladled with hot chocolate sauce. As you watch the chocolate sauce drip to the #HITME logo you are encouraged to use your spoon like a hammer and break into the ""Liquid Klondike"" which causes a vanilla chocolate eruption.

Upon walking in, you have to go up the elevator to the second floor to check in with the hostess. We had reservations for 10:30 for a party of 5 but we got there a little earlier knowing that the place is happening and we might have to wait, but boy was it happening. In order to get to the hostess you have to push your way through thirsty piranhas. In order to get to the hostess I had to get pushed and shoved and pull out my inner football player skills otherwise you will not get to the front. Which I find completely unacceptable for such a high end restaurant. Once I finally got to the golden gates of the hostess desk they gave us a beeper and the waiting began. Getting a drink at the bar was another impossible task, so we decided to just wait around, but every spot seemed to be extremely over crowded. So crowded we decided waiting outside in 30 degree weather was better than having to endure the crowds of people inside. Until I finally gave in and stood in the piranhas den and ordered a drink. After 45 minutes of waiting for a table, and having to endure snobby hostess telling us to wait, and the crowds of people, we finally got a table. Everything was better after that. Our waitress was I believe ""Jenny"" she was extremely nice! She apologized for the wait and greeted us with birthday shots and an appetizer which was extremely nice of her! She was also very helpful when helping us order the food and went out of her way to accommodate a picky eater friend! I do have to say the water was not refilled very often, we had to find ourselves asking around for water because it was not being refilled. This is big for me because I drink a lot of water and if I'm paying all this money I don't want to be chasing the bus boy for my water. As for the food, I had the lobster Mac and cheese (mouth watering delicious), rock shrimp (absolutely delicious), spicy tuna on crispy rice (I've had better but not bad), mahi mahi taco (didn't try it but friends loved it), and the catch roll (could have done without).

Catch has the sweet spot of the building and resides in three of the four floors. The interiors shabby chic décor carries details of warm copper lighting fixtures, multiple single hung wood windows, wood accented hues in surrounding areas, plus to cool things down, marble countertops and of course the exposed brick throughout the entire restaurant.I barely had to look at the menu as I knew months ago what I was going to order and that was the Crunchy Rice Cake with Tuna Tartare. The crispity crunchy, savory, slightly acidic, slightly sweet cubes of moist rice cakes were a delight and did not disappoint. Who thought of that idea? They took the every day spicy tuna roll and elevated it to a superior level...creative. The Miso Black Cod Lettuce wrap was another stunner. The perfectly cooked cod was buttery and delicate and I think should be added to the menu as a main course. Between the two of us we ordered five plates which was more than enough.

Every single time we needed to get them, we had to leave them down. The food also took absolutely forever to come out, which is inappropriate. We spent more than two hours there, purely because we were just waiting on the food.However, despite this, the food was absolutely delicious. We started with the tornado roll, which was great. I then had the chicken and quinoa salad, which was impeccable. I love the cranberries and the dressing, and the chicken was very tender. My dad got the lobster roll, and he really enjoyed it. That says a lot, since we come from the Boston area where there are really good lobster rolls.We all ended with the Smore's pizza, which was great.

Main Floor has a lot going on, everything just seemed to flow....well, almost everything. What a phenomenal semi-rustic interior: from the brick walls, dramatic black and white tile flooring over at the bar and down to the warm lighting, to pull their style together. We ordered 4 dishes and a veggie- which thankfully worked perfectly in size, we treated them as tapas and picked from each other's plates. Hands down, our choices were all delicious, especially my friend's Crunchy Rice Cake with Tuna Tartare, Crispy Shrimp- that were ever-so-lightly, smothered in a seasoned mayo (thank goodness!).Lobster Mac & Cheese and the Black Cod Wraps, were mouth is watering! Every Seafood item was nicely done. Energy was cozy, romantic and seemed like a cool hangout spot to be with friends- all in one. Service was very friendly and personal. But, service derailed a bit with a few bumpy and really questionable moments from both our server and floor manager, who we felt didn't quite measure up. My friend asked for extra plates and within minutes, floor manager removed my plate without my permission- Strike #1. Crispy Rice Cake with Tuna Tartare that was ordered, called for Soy Sauce and was rightfully brought over by our server- but, within minutes, floor manager---again, removed the Soy Sauce- Strike #2. But even with the dazed and confused moments, the Home Run during our relaxing late lunch, has got to be their food!!!

I was not impress with the scallop neither. It had a distinct fishy  taste. Overall the food does not match it's prices as I had much higher expectation for that price.As for the drinks, I stuck to one which was ""one too many cocktails"" which was not bad but since it was filled with shaved ice it did get water down.

We arrived and were greeted by a young lady wearing a shirt with a pic of Obama and the quote ""miss me yet?"" Love him, hate him, whatever but not appropriate especially in today's volatile political climate. It was early on a Saturday night and there were plenty of empty tables. Other hostesses joined in and feverishly went through the pages of some book. We were told we have 1.200 reservations and we just can't do it. We had a good laugh and pointed out all the empty tables. We were then told ok, we will seat you but you have to be out by 8:45, it was 7:30. We agreed, what would they do, throw us out while dining? LolWe are now seated in a booth that was fairly tight for the 6 of us but we were ok with it and looking forward to a good meal. The waitress came over and that's where things went south. We wanted to share and asked some questions and we looking for recommendations. We were abruptly cut off and told just let me finish my spiel. Okay... She kept telling us how small the app portions were and we looked over at the next table and they seemed fine. We went back and forth and she was such a stuck up Bit$h, we all looked at each other, got up and left. We heard the food was supposed to be good but I would have to put this place on the pretentious tourist trap list.

They over glorify how busy and packed they are, yet half of the restaurant is empty. The 4th floor decor is dated and cheap, the tables and chairs belong in your grandma's backyard.Now the food, be warned if you are a foodie who resides in NYC, you will be very disappointed with place that charges $150 a person for a small dinner with some apps and a drink. Yes, it's not about quantity but you'd want quality, something that will be so memorable that you couldn't wait to go back - you wont find such a dish here. We've had a large party and we've ordered different appetizers and entrees. We did like the different desserts.

We had reservations for a party of 7 girls for a Friday night around 6:30 for a birthday dinner.  A few of us were late, but we had no problems getting seated.  Upon arrival, the 2nd fl is for dinner & 4th for rooftop.  The ambience in the restaurant is perfect for date night, and the servers are gorgeous!We got the Crispy Shrimp, Mahi mahi Wonton Tacos, Steamed Mussels, 2 Lobster Rolls, Scallop Gnocchi, Wagyu Short Rib Tacos, Lobster Mac&Cheese, and the parmesan truffle fries.  Maybe we came at a good time, before the kitchen got swamped because we got our food in record time - except the kitchen did forget our orders of the lobster mac and cheese and we had to ask for it at the end of our dinner. Must Gets: Crispy Shrimp, Scallop Gnocchi, Wagyu Short Rib Tacos and the Lobster Mac and Cheese.  By far, the best lobster mac I've ever had at any restaurant to date and perfect size for sharing. The scallop gnocchi was also a good portion and the gnocchi had this filling that was pretty amazing.  Everybody raves about the crispy shrimp, and it lives up to its reputation! - it was crispy and saucy and perfectly spicy.  The short rib tacos my friend thoroughly enjoyed, but I thought the texture of the meat was a bit off - but she enjoyed it.Skip: Steamed Mussels and Lobster Rolls. Save your money, both did not have a wow factor.  You can get better at other restaurants.Since it was my girlfriends birthday - we also got the #HitMe Dessert.  Presentation was beautiful!  I regretfully did not taste it - had too much to eat, but looked great. Overall, had a great dining experience, did not order any drinks because of the ridiculous prices, and would come back for a date night in the future.

While passing through we saw this club and wanted to go in. we were asked to wait in the line as we did not have any reservations. Firstly, let me tell you, people working at the Catch Club are really RUDE. While we were waiting in the line, people were let in one by one, as per the availability. After spending more than 15 -20 mins, I went and asked the doorman (John Johnson) to let us in. He mentioned please wait in the line, so that's what I Did! We waited and waited. We saw people WITHOUT reservations behind us were let inside. It was over 45mins of us waiting outside at this place and still they would not let us in. I asked John (atleast that's what he said his name was) again , and now this time he said reservations only! So while I was talking to the girls standing behind us , who did NOT Have any RESERVATIONS, I hear John calling them to let them go in. The girls (4 of them) asked us to join them as they were going inside and John said NO you cannot go inside, and he DID not let us go in! Now this was MADNESs! What was this guy up to? I asked myself! Standing there for almost an hour and watching people go by inside without reservations, made me furious and I decided to talk to the manager! The manager was standing right there and saw what was happening, he said 'I have been working with this guys since a very long time and I know he did nothing wrong'.. this manager was even rude than John! The reason I am referring to this guy as 'Manager' and by not his name , because when I asked this guy his name, he said ""you do not need to know my name""! This has never happened to us before! We have been to so many clubs around NYC, but trust me this was the first time I encountered someone this RUDE! Let me also clear that, we were dressed appropriately for the place, so I am not sure why they would not let us in!I decided to write this review so the people up high (management) at Catch could see how their staff treats people who wants to hangout At their clubs!

When I ordered the check she brought my check, which was only $22.86. I gave her my credit card and when she brought back the receipt, I saw that she had charged my card for $111.05!!!! I immediately complained (she probably assumed that I was not going to notice it) and I even went up to her manager to talk about the situation. Eventually she came back saying that they had reversed the charge and that the $111.05 would be credited to my card. She gave me a slip which looked very similar to what she had initially printed. I told her I wanted a receipt that showed that the charge had been reversed but she said she wouldn't be able to provide that. 4 days after this incident, I still don't see the credit on my account.

Catch lived up to my mediocre expectations.We were seated maybe 10 minutes after our reservation time, which gave us time to confirm that all the hostesses likely model on the side. Our seats were on the main floor with a pretty good view of the whole restaurant. The only issue was that they had to physically move the table to allow me access to the booth. There are maybe 2 inches between tables - meaning that if you get up at all during your meal, you will disturb all the food and drinks on both your's and your neighbor's tables. For drinks, I had a random glass of wine and tried the Lush Lemonade. It was not good at all, just had a really poor flavor. To eat, we started with the Cruncy Rice Cakes which tasted pretty good but were incredibly sticky. We split the Crispy Chicken for our entree, and it was a solid chicken dish. Definitely enough food for two people. Of course we finished with the Hit Me dessert and enjoyed it just fine. The service was not spectacular - we didn't get checked on very often and the drinks were slow to arrive.

It's an amazing place to hang out and they did a good job with their interior. Really great spot to grab drinks with friends especially if you can score a table on the rooftop. Food is mediocre for its price, but I love the vibes that Catch has going on and the workers are super awesome. We originally reserved for 3 and had 3 joining us last minute, which was a bit of a problem until we tipped the host $100. Pretty sure this isn't acceptable, but hey if you're desperate you know money talks here. For drinks, my friends and I got the one that comes in a pineapple. It's worth it because of its presentation. Just make sure you don't take the pineapple cup home or you'll get charged $100!The crispy shrimp is delicious, but personally not worth it ($23). I'm from Vancouver and I could get the same dish for a third of the price. Lobster mac and cheese was decent. I like my mac and cheese a bit more creamy, and this one just didn't blow me away. Mac and cheese is a pretty simple dish, so it's hard not to screw this one up. Truffle sashimi is an interesting dish that I quite enjoyed. I've never had this anywhere else and I come from a city that boasts on seafood and sushi. I actually quite enjoyed this one; I recommend it! Sweet potato Gnocchi was just not as good as I hoped it would be. Wasn't impressed at all. I've made this dish at home before and it was better. For dessert you have to get the one their famously known for, which is their Hit Me chocolate cake. Not only is it delicious but it's fun to smash!I'd go back and still order food because it wasn't disgusting; in fact, it was good but for the prices, it's not really worth it.

I am 35 weeks pregnant and only did the walk b/c I really wanted to try this out. After having OT reservations for 10:00pm, upon arriving, we were given a buzzer to wait. We waited another 30 mins to get seated-I had no where to sit while waiting, my pregnant feet & back KILLED at this point. After getting seated, I told the waiter that we needed some dessert menus b/c we were planning on having dessert and cocktails. He said he would be right back with them. 5 mins later, we had a manager come up to us and he asked us to leave, b/c he would not permit us to just order dessert and drinks on a weekend. Mind you, it was not dinnertime, and how were they to know how much $ we were planning on spending? My husband and friend's were planning on having a few cocktails each, and each a dessert.

She took our drink order as we asked what we're some popular items to eat. We weren't that hungry because we were going somewhere else, however I'm a big fan of rice cakes (Asian style) I was introduce to it at this other restaurant called Toku in Manhasset, Long Island. Ever since thing it's been my go-to thing. We tried the lobster Mac and cheese which was delicious, and the Parmesan truffle fries were good too. My rice cakes were delicious, however I felt like it was too over cooked because it was very hard to take a bite out of it. As for cocktails I had a glass of Pinot noir (my fave) and my girlfriends had a beer, and another cocktail (which I came remember the name) The waitress was very nice, helpful, and busy at the same time. She had a helper whenever I think she was too caught up with other tables which is absolutely fine, because when you need something you don't want to wait 20 minutes for ketchup. I would love to comeback here to try the rooftop on a better day. It was closed when we entered due to the rain, but it became open within the hour around 9 o'clock.

The grilled octopus was one of my favorites, there was so much flavor and I loved that it was heartier, being served with the potatoes.  The sweet potato gnocchi was delicious, amazing.  The scallop gnocchi was weird and I wouldn't reccomend, I was thrown off if the scallop was mixed in with the gnocchi noodle, giving it a weird texture.  Brussel sprouts were also good you can't go wrong there.Dessert:  Save the best for last and be sure to save room here.  We ordered the cinnamon roll donut which was literally a cinnamon roll in a donut served with ice cream.  The S'mores pizza was one of my favorites, oooh so good and the ice cream they served it with was ah-may-zing.  The ""Hit Me"" Chocolate cake was another hit with the table, as they drizzle hot chocolate syrup on top and you slam the middle of the cake side ways with your spoon and the cake busts open with lava, served with a chocolate piece that reads ""#hitme"".  A social media extravaganza I am sure.",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

Be ready for LOUD.Here's what we had:LOBSTER MAC N CHEESE (3/5) Watch out for the over-hype here.  Yelpers way over-talked this one up.  I wasn't too impressed with their version although I did like the al dente noodles - cooked just right.  The blue cheese is a bit too strong for me and not creamy enough.  Every has their own standard for M&C but I'm just saying this isn't mine.  The hype on this one, is over-hype in my opinion.  Just don't get too excited about this dish, and maybe you'll end up liking it.  Wouldn't order again.YELLOWTAIL HAND ROLLS (5/5)  Outstanding.  These rolls redeemed the Mac n Cheese.  These rolls made everything right.  We ended up ordering another round.  Get these.TRUFFLE SASHIMI (5/5)  Another standout.  I wanted to order another round of these too.  Just the perfect little chunks of tender fish, floating in a glorious truffle soy concoction.  Kudos to the chef on this one.  A++! KING CRAB HAND ROLL (4/5) The best Crab Hand Roll that you will ever eat is served at a place called SUGAR FISH in Los Angeles.  Please take this mid-review tip seriously and go to SUGAR FISH at your earliest convenience.  I am all too sure you will message me later to thank me.  So the hand roll served here at Catch is very good, but no comparison to the one at SUGAR FISH.  I guess that's what I'm trying to say!  But would order again, despite its inferiority to other rolls in the world!  :)HELL FIRE ROLL (3/5)  Note to Chef/Manager:  Please don't call a roll ""Hellfire"" if you're not prepared to bring the intense heat.  Hell Fire are some pretty strong words and it gets the spice-loving people excited, only to be let-down by something I would call ""mildly spicy"".  Didn't catch the heat at all!  Wasn't impressed with this roll or the name. :)  Would not order again.  CRISPY ROCK SHRIMP (5/5)  Please note that I'm using the word ""outstanding"" for the third time in this review.  Wow.  I've had so many versions of this dish - the best of which is served at NOBU in LA.  That's another mid-review tip.  Try NOBU in LA.  It's very pricey but worth the splurge.  I think Catch out-did even NOBU on this dish.  The crispiness of the batter, the quality of the shrimp, and the perfect sweet tang of the glaze.  LOVED this dish.  Service was lacking and many a Yelper have experienced that apparently if you read through some of the reviews.  Our server was young, inexperienced and not properly trained.  A place of this caliber should step it up in the area of service.But this place, in the end, is a def come back.  Quite a few haters out there on this place, probably soured by the poor service.  But the food we had was worthy.  Somebody in the kitchen is talented.",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

I ordered the California rollwhich was fresh and tasty ,but arrived twenty minutes after the fact that my friend's were three quarters finished needless to say I was pissed. We were given the bill which was nearly 700.00 dollars. Our waiter asked me who the birthday person was, I discreetly pointed at my friend,he walked away, my thoughts were that he would giver a little cake to just say Happy birthday . Well that never happened, I had to take the waiter aside and say something to him about what he asked before, I informed that a small desert should be brought to my friend, he looked at me in what I felt was in disgust to even remind him to his question on the birthday person.

Two days later something told me to call and confirm the reservations, good thing I did. When I called I was told that my reservations couldn't be found. I spoke to the manager who told me they only had 10:45pm available. I was very upset and told her I had already told everyone 9:00 and how was it possible that they couldn't find my reservation. After going back and forth she ""found"" my reservation. However, she said she could do 9:30 not 9:00 which was fine. The day of the dinner was POURING rain. I told all my guest to make sure they were there on time. We arrived at 9:20pm. It was 10:15pm and we were still not seated. I asked the hostess for the manager whom I spoke to about the reservations ""Carolyn"" and was told that there is no Carolyn that works there. Then another hostess said that there is a Carolyn but she was on the floor.  So pretty much no manager was available. We were seated exactly 10:30.. ((coincidentally the time they originally tried to give me)) we waited ONE HOUR! We were hungry, annoyed that we were standing in our heels for so long. After we were seated the waitress was very nice and the food was excellent. However! Not once did a manager come over and apologize for the wait or ask how we were doing. They took $50 off the bill for the wait. I could really care less about the money. People come to these nice restaurants because they have high expectations of customer service and professionalism both in which Catch lacks.

234,vH4_whddFLyRPV_i6msO_Q,Tiffany Y.,4.0 star rating,"Located in Greenwich Village, Catch is in the heart of all the fancy restaurants and across the street from the Gansevoort hotel. I had trouble looking for the restaurant since I wasn't at the main entrance, so if you see Sephora, you're literally around the corner and it's on the second floor. The doorman (?) in front of the entrance asks you whether you're here for drinks or for the restaurant and directs you do which floor to go to. Second floor is the main dining area and the fourth floor is their rooftop lounge-y area. My reservations were for 6 people at 6pm on a Sunday evening. Surprisingly it wasn't TOO packed, but we didn't end up getting seated till late since the rest of my party was an hour late...As soon as my husband arrived at 6pm, we were instructed to the second floor which seems to only be assessable by ONE elevator. The restaurant opens up to the main dining area where these gorgeous long legged model like hostess are there to greet you (no joke, everyone's at least model height, but I'm really short..). Since the rest of the party wasn't here yet, we were instructed to the bar on the left hand side to enjoy a drink while we wait. The bar area is quite large with tables along the window. The bar itself holds top liquor with extremely friendly bartenders. My husband, being a whiskey drinker, decides to order a top shelf whiskey, which the bar charged $65 for a shot. Clearly he didn't order it and went straight for good ol Jack Daniels...which costs about $13. I had a non-alcoholic drink called 'skinny B' which was cucumbers, mint leaves, and cucumber/lime seltzer ($7). Two jacks neat and my skinny B cost us about $43 on THREE drinks...yes FORTY THREE DOLLARS. Finally our group arrived and we were instructed to go to the fourth floor for dinner...fourth floor was much more hippy and more lounge-y. We were seated by a corner booth and Lisa, our waitress, helped us right away with telling us the specials, how their menu works, and suggestions. Here is the breakdown:Service: surprisingly not terrible considering I felt the restaurant was a little pretentious for my taste. The model hostesses and Lisa, our waitress was extremely friendly and nice. Even after an hour past our reservation time, we were still seated with no issue and Lisa was extremely knowledgable with the menu. The only thing is she forgot a hot water for my mother-in-law which she apologized for immediately and got the water for her right away. Food: pretty freaking good! The menu is made to share entrees and appetizers like a family style dinner, so the portions were HUGE. My in laws ordered a snapper which was literally a deep fried snapper with a small side of cooked veggies. The fish was REALLY good. Cooked really well where the fish wasn't over cooked on the inside and extra crispy on the outside. The lobster Mac n cheese is a MUST try. It wasn't heavy and there's a generous portion of lobster meat. For 6 hungry people, two orders of this was good enough to hold us. My husband and I shared the 10oz filet and a side of asparagus. My sister in law and her cousin ordered the short ribs. In summary, the meats all came out TO PERFECTION. The meat literally melted in your mouth and the sauce that comes along side the meat makes it that much better. For dessert, we had the 'hit me chocolate cake' which has a Klondike bar on top, with chocolate ice cream, and another layer of chocolate cake on the bottom, drizzled with chocolate syrup/liquor (pictures to follow!). This is a must have dessert as well and make sure you have your camera out when you 'hit' the dessert. Decor: The second floor decor was really fancy compared to their fourth floor decor. Once the elevators open up to the second floor, it looks more of an upscale restaurant. If you've ever seen the movie Date Night with Tina Fey and Steve Carrell, Catch reminds me of the restaurant they tried getting reservations to. The fourth floor was much more relaxed with a large dining area and outdoor seating. A lot brighter compared to the second floor, this is definitely more of a place to hang out in a more lounge-y setting. I'd give the staff and food a 5 star and an overall eating of 4 stars because this restaurant is extremely overpriced. Yes, I know I'm in NYC, in the Village, and yes I know I'm paying for the delicious food, but charging What seems to be double of what alcohol is in NJ is just beyond ridiculous. The food is great, but averaging $25+ for most of the dishes really doesn't make sense. Our check came out to $351 for six people with 2 appetizers, 3 entrees, 2 desserts, and 2 coffees which doesn't seem bad, but I definitely wouldn't come back anytime soon for a typical date night",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

The atmosphere is cool, it's very loud probably because of the music but I didn't mind because the music was good. Only reason for not giving four stars is that we waited about an hour after arriving. Made a reservation for 7:45 and had to wait until 8:40 to sit. As someone who has worked in the service industry, I understand that sometimes restaurants fall behind on reservations but an hour wait with a reservation is pretty ridiculous.

They don't open for dinner until 5:30, so we made a 5:30 reservation and were the first to be seated. We were brought complimentary Pretzel Bread while looking over the menu, which became overwhelming-how to narrow down to a few dishes when they all look great! We at first ordered four small plates, but our waitress recommend adding another for the two of us. After much debate, our final choices were: 1. the Ceviche-instead by my mom, as she loves ceviche. It was the most expensive of our choices and actually our least favorite.2. Catch Roll (minus jalapeños, our choice)-an amazing roll that is their signature fur good reason. For extra fun, it's lit on fire table side!3. Crunchy Rice Cakes-crispy rice topped with a cold tuna tartare-like mix. They're one of Catch's most talked about dishes so you have to try them. Think, inside out sushi roll with crunchy rice.4. Shaved Brussels Sprouts (side)-this amazing, sweet and savory veggie side is a flavorful must-order. 5. Sweet Potato Gnocchi-in my top 3 favorites-something my mother didn't want to order but was blown away by upon eating. Sweet, sweet potato gnocchi in a creamy coconut milk mushroom gravy, with crispy kale.Dessert, especially on one's birthday, is essential, and our choice without a question was the iconic ""Hit Me"" cake, which was delightful. However, unlike most places that offer a complimentary birthday dessert, we were still charged. For as much as you spend on dinner, you'd think otherwise, but unfortunately no. This was the only thing that slightly bothered me!     In conclusion, our meal experience at Catch was one of the best we've had in the city-certainly not the cheapest, but definitely worth the splurge!",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

About 45 minutes in, we went over to the hostesses, complained and were promised a word with a manager that never materialised. When we first arrived there was a very noticeable crowd that then dispersed before we were ever seated, making me think that we were not a priority for aesthetic reasons. The food was incredible. We ate and shared the lobster rolls, swordfish, snapper (table favourite), crispy shrimp, muscles, tacos, dessert pizza and a complimentary amuse bouche for our many troubles.

Although I didn't make the reservations, I would assume that you would need a reservation to get into this place. Catch is in the heart of the meat packing district- across from spice market. For those that drive- parking sucks as you know and the scarce parking sites charge about $40-55 bucks for the evening. Cobblestone is not fun for heels. You enter Catch  on the ground floor- then take a un-Air conditioned elevator to 2nd floor for main floor/bar. The rooftop is on 4th floor- bar , inside dining room and some tables outside as well. After dinner- it turns into a party.Anyway getting back to the amazing food and drink. I had a few drinks at the main bar while waiting for other people in my party.  It is a busy bar - these guys and gals work nonstop. Alex, was our bartender and he made us awesome drinks. I tried the Seedless Suzy (watermelon) but it just wasn't to my liking I think because it had basil in it. But I tired the Lush Lemonade and it was so delish and refreshing. My friend order this ""bullet bourbon and ginger ale"" as a special make and it was amazing and I'm not a bourbon drinker at all! We ended up eating on the 4th floor/rooftop in a nice spacious circular booth. Service was good although not fantastic but man the food was delicious. Catch is not cheap! And you receive ""just enough"" portions but each bite is amazing!Catch roll (sushi) was good. We had crispy shrimp for the table and it was DELICIOUS!!I had the LOBSTER MAC and CHEESE and it was f'ing awesome! So good! Something about the meat packing district and Mac and cheese. Just amazing! Friends had the Salmon which I sampled and it was like butter in my mouth! Very good.  Another friend had the sea bass and said it was amazing! Def look forward to coming back and trying other items on the menu! FYI- if u eat late- around the time the rooftop party will start. They are super strict about who goes up on the elevator.

There is no other lobster mac like it and although the menu boasts a ton of delectables this signature dish makes the trip here well worth it all on it's own. The elbow noodles are swimming in a rich and creamy bechamel sauce, the lobster chunks are NOT hard to find and the crunchy breadcrumb topping contrasts beautifully with the smooth and silky mac mixture. Look out for the girl who is eating it by the spoonful. Oh, and if this place couldn't get any better every meal starts off with a basket of fresh pretzel bread and a mustard spread of sorts. I could probably make a meal out of this stuff alone, it's addicting. Other signature dishes include crispy shrimp doused in a spicy and creamy mayo, crunchy tuna wonton tacos and lobster roll sliders. The sharing plates are fairly small, and I would suggest ordering 4 if you are coming here with one other person. There is a pretty extensive list of signature cocktails, but I usually go with the iris which combines vodka and grapefruit juice and pairs well with the seafood. It's a difficult task here, but don't forget to leave room for dessert. They've got some out of the ordinary dessert options like S'mores pizza and waffle ice cream sandwiches. Catch is hella swanky - dress to impress folks! The rooftop is a trendy night time spot and after dinner the club goers will start to pour in by the masses. Watch out for celebs, as Catch is known to have sightings every now and then. Don't miss out on a day time party here either! The rooftop opens up for a champagne brunch during the summer and is a great place to get yo' drank on and catch some rays. Alsoooo- do not, I repeat, do not order any sort of gilt/groupon type voucher. The pricing is pretty similar to their menu and instead of choosing what you want to eat you have to stick to a preset menu with options that aren't too special. Aka no lobster mac and cheese.

We were promptly seated on the 2nd Floor of this Three Floor establishment. The interior is lovely, although the tables are a little too close together for my liking, and it felt a bit squished. The drinks are well crafted but extremely pricey ($18 for a typical cocktail, wine ran around $16/glass). We had to ask for the restaurant week menus, which always annoys me. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu, friendly and extremely helpful. The main course came out too quickly, one of us had not yet received their appetizer, but we requested the waiter slow down the dessert and so finished the meal without feeling as rushed as it started. Now for my review of the food. Phenomenal! The meal started with warm pretzel bread served with Honey Mustard Butter. I had the Hamachi Spinach followed by the Seared Tuna with a tamarind brown butter sauce (a highlight!! This sauce was too die for) and the S'mores Pizza. Every bite a delight! My non fish eating friend had vegetable king roll and chicken lettuce wraps, both of which he enjoyed immensely.

After spending over $1k easily on the second floor around 930pm on a Saturday night, myself and 7 of our guest made our way to the 4th floor rooftop. We had a nice table and couch where we had a good time with drinks, I ran outside really quick around 11pm to check on my car which was directly parked out front and walked back in within 3 minutes time and suddenly I needed a stamp and the ""guy in the green jacket"" wouldn't give me one. So basically, I have a table of (now 9 guests) with freshly served drinks, my bag and jacket all upstairs and I cannot get them. I had to speak to an Abby and she was allowed to escort me up to retrieve my things, but not let me stay because it's a ""reservation table serve only"", but if you're a hot girl.. it's not a problem, they will stamp you in a heart beat. I literally watched a dozen girls get stamped with no problem, while I'm waiting to speak to an Abby. My cousin also surprised us at 11 with his girlfriend, but they weren't allowed up either. They were stuck on the second floor, while everyone was on the fourth. One my of friends went to go get them and winded up getting stuck on the second floor too. It really is a disgusting unorganized place. I've been to catch now twice.. but I will never go again. The food is subpar, you really go for the experience and ambiance, but by experience.. I don't necessarily mean it's going to be a good experience. They clearly don't value their client base and people that actually spent good money at their restaurant and would have continued if the experience ended up being better. There are far better establishments in meatpacking where you can have a good time without the hassle.

284,LOBD3y9pG-2nHfojR2L44w,Glenn D.,5.0 star rating,"Honestly loved my experience here.  Great venue, delicious food, and some awesome service from our waiter and the bussers.  Just something I want to throw out there before I talk about anything.  Some of these reviews talk about the portions being way too small for the price they are charging, but you can't forget that you're eating out at a beautiful venue with a rooftop lounge, great customer service, and located in the Meatpacking District...  know what to expect when you're coming here.  That being said... If you're coming here regularly, you're either financial well-off or you work there.Decor:  The name of the place is ""catch"" and they've got a full-on sushi bar, I'm gonna take a wild guess and say this place has is ""fish"" themed.  So great job making it look like the inside of a ship/yacht/sailboat.  They've got a lot of different things going on when it comes to light fixtures, furniture, and seating, but it all works!  It's got a very casual feel and people definitely aren't whispering in there.  Talk! Socialize!Came here with my girlfriend for her Pre-Birthday Dinner and we normally share dishes so we can get more of a variety without over-stuffing ourselves, and today wasn't any different!FOOD!:Came with complimentary pretzel rings and a side of dijon butter!  The pretzels were warm and were very soft on the inside.  The dijon mayo definitely tasted like dijon, but it wasn't overwhelming.  Much appreciated!Mahi Mahi Wonton Tacos ($19):  3 small fish tacos PACKED with flavor.  I normally don't like the hard shell tacos, but I appreciated these.  The shell was hard and held together well, but just barely crisp when you bit into them.  Each taco has a lot of guac on it! Lobster Mashed Potatoes ($16):  These didn't sound like anything too special, and when it came to the table, it was presented very nicely (well nice for mashed potatoes)  and still wasn't impressed.  Took one bite and my eyes lit up!  For the portion, there were tons of lobster pieces in there, and the potatoes were super flavorful!  Who cares if it had tons of butter in it!?  Scallop Gnocchi ($24):  Talk about, best gnocchi I've ever had in my life.  The scallops were seared perfectly, and were as succulent as you can get.  The gnocchi, was perfect, it had a nice toast to it, and were very soft on the inside.  They were also filled! According to our waiter, they were filled with some scallop mixture and everything was tossed in a shrimp scampi concoction, or something along those lines.  At first we couldn't tell which was the scallop and which was the gnocchi, so each bite was a pleasant surprise.We topped the night off with their most talked about dessert...The HIT ME Chocolate Cake ($15):  This thing definitely lives up to the hype.  Presentation was clever and makes for a great photo/video.  This dish contains a liquid ""klondike"" bar, roasted white chocolate ice cream, brownie & devil's food.  You hit the ""klondike"" bar with the edge of your spoon and it oozes out with a delicious white sauce #pause.  Don't exactly know what it is, but I'm going to guess some sort of condensed milk; it's VERY sweet!  Everything goes really well together, the brownie devil's food is dense and chocolatey, and the ice cream adds that relief to the overpowering sweetness (weird that ice cream is the sweetness relief, but seriously, it is lol!) You really must get each layer of the cake in each bite, please don't unstack this thing!  Service:  Like I said, extraordinary.  Not only is he a great people-person, but he's got an extensive knowledge of the menu; he knows the ins and the outs, what to recommend, and what goes well with each other.  We asked about the filling in the gnocchi, he didn't hesitate at all, and he was so ecstatic to tell us about it!  Also, our water glasses were NEVER empty!  I thought twice about sipping on my water so I wouldn't get full too fast cause the water just kept on coming.  We even dropped our things multiple times, and they were so quick to pick it up for us.  This place isn't cheap, but if you come in with the mindset of having bigger portions, or cheaper deals, then you're not going to enjoy yourself.  Look at is as... taking advantage of the many great things this place has to offer.",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

I was treated to a birthday dinner here and had a really great experience. First, the hostesses were extremely accommodating for a Saturday night, as we were late for our reservation due to traffic and parking (we kept calling in to update them on the way). When we arrived they were still extremely pleasant and seated us immediately.  I wish I knew our server's name, but she was very sweet. She had great drink suggestions as well as suggestions on the specials. At one point there was a drink I was really eager to try, she suggest against it, but I got it anyway and when I laughed and told her she was right, she laughed, told me not to worry about and thankfully took it off of the bill (at $18 a pop for a cocktail, I was grateful for that haha). I can't remember what we ordered for drinks, plus I think they changed their cocktail menu a little since then. As for the food: really good, for the most part! We got the hellfire roll, a hand roll that was a special that evening (it was okay) and the grilled octopus for starters. I normally don't like to ingest anything with tentacles but the octopus was well cooked, well seasoned and very good. We were debating between the snapper and the lobster for two of us out of three to share, but because my mom and I love lobster so much we knew we would not be able to share an order and opted for the snapper. They present it to you after it's cooked and before it's filleted. It was a really beautiful and tasty piece of fish! The sauce and the veggies with it were delicious as well. My dad got the Salmon and was very pleased with it. The only thing I didn't like food-wise was the lobster mashed potatoes. They weren't well-seasoned and had a very strange after-taste. I was obsessed with the idea of the cinnamon roll donut, which was okay, but it would have been 100% better if it was served warm. It was a little dry too. The espresso-flavored ice-cream served with it was great though! We really enjoyed the ""Hit-Me"" chocolate cake, but let's be real, it's the most fun and probably most popular dessert so it's hard not to enjoy.

Catch is one of two locations I know (the other one in LA, where my best friend lives, she said she'd not dined there) of, it sits inside a rusty building in the Meatpacking next to Chelsea Marketing, through elevator and iron doors, you get to choose the 4th floor roof top or 2nd floor dining room. It's fall so we opted to sit inside. It's a quite spacious restaurant with a semi-open kitchen, they have 3 hostesses and a lot of staff, but the place got pretty busy so we had to waive down our waitress a few times, she was very friendly and professional and patient, I'd still give her all the stars she deserved that night.My friend and I were not out to drink, their wine list is extensive and I'll definitely come back for a glass. We ordered the black cod lettuce cups with sweet shiitake mushrooms and dried noodles, mahi mahi and avocado tacos, spicy tuna on crunchy rice crispies and steamed mussels. Oh boy that black cod was marinated so well, the lettuce was very thin, not your typical romaine or iceberg, it didn't wrap the cod too well but all the flavors compliment each other.I liked the mahi mahi tacos as well, the mussels were kind of tiny but very tasty. Thumbs up! We didn't want to go for an entree so we shared the four stacks of chocolates...probably the best dessert I've had in awhile, I usually don't even eat chocolates, the staff poured hot fudge on top of the chocolate wrapped ice cream, it broke the brick into pieces and the river of cream poured out, the second cake was a brownie and the bottom was also a brownie, except for a different flavor, the third layer was a caramel iced cream, everything together was exceptional.

This is partially our fault too, but also felt misguided so it definitely left a bad taste in our mouth.  Shared plates were cod lettuce wraps, spicy salmon roll, mussels, chicken meatballs and spicy shrimp. Spicy shrimp is heavily battered and so is the roll. Seemed unnecessary.

I had a reservation and we were seated on the top floor that was outside but with a cover. The heating was less than sufficient in this area. I tried to talk to the hostess downstairs on the second floor to get seated elsewhere but she said there were no other options. On the 2nd, 3rd, 4th floors, the restaurant was half empty at 7pm. The fact that they were not willing to move us showed me lack of good customer service. Finally, after talking to the waiter, he was able to move us to a table a few feet away that was not against the window.

We also tried the catch roll 19 bux for 5 pieces, nothing special, although they do torch at the table which is pretty cool. We both enjoyed the hit me dessert as well.

We almost loved everything we ordered. My favorite entree is the lobster roll. It was very fresh!! The crispy shrimp appetizer was outstanding and beyond our expectation. It was a bit spicy but very tasty!! And the portion of appetizers is much bigger than what we expect as well. For dessert, I love sorbet over the signature waffle tower because it's more refreshing! Waffle itself is good tho, just too sweet for me to finish it with ice cream! Environment:It's very spacious so I would recommend this place if you have a big group. (We had 9 girls)Service: The waiters and waitresses are very friendly and kind. The only reason I'm giving it three stars only is because we were the 1sf table on that day, we got there at 11:50, the restaurant opened at 12, but we were still waiting for our entrees when it was 1:15 PM! Not that we don't have patient, but we had to check out the hotel at 2 Pm.

Third: A fight broke out in the main dining room, while we were eating. Everything on peoples tables, including mine, ended up on the floor. My bottle of champagne and all of the food, gone. My coat which is very very expensive, was soaked in liquor. They told us to go the front while they cleaned up. After waiting around for 15 minutes, they told us they would cut the bill by 50%.

However, the ambience overall was just a little too pretentious, particularly while waiting. When we got there (with a reservation) we were told to wait by the bar. We waited for almost fifteen minutes. We were jostled a lot. When I asked to sit at a slightly larger but better lit corner table my request was declined.  It's also just a little too dark for a fish place. It's trendy but still. Maybe my mid 40 year old eyes need just enough light to read the menu. Maybe it's just a very popular place. Maybe they just deliver from now on. Now for the food. Tornado roll. Just the right amount of crunch. The sauce on the side. was spicy but not too much. The fish melted in your mouth. The truffle sashimi was four pieces-2 tuna and 2 yellowtail. The green sauce that it comes in was to die for. The fish was truly a catch-smooth as silk. Spicy rock shrimp. I almost forgot to order what I came here for. We ordered it mid meal and it came out two minutes later. It was so very delicious. Fried and covered in the perfect orangey red sauce. Again, spicy but not too spicy. Truffle Parmesan fries with truffle sauce. Best truffle fries ever they taste like truffle crack. (Idk what crack tastes like but they were great.)Lobster mashed potatoes. Maybe they're could have been slightly more chunks of lobster as opposed to one big one on the top but it was decorative. And delicious. Rice cakes with tuna. Probably the best item out of everything. It had a nice crunchy taste with really fresh tasting tuna. Hit Me Chocolate Cake for dessert. We aren't big on having to hit stuff in order to access flavor and it gets liquidy and messy, but the top and bottom crunch chocolate wafers were the best I've ever had. Ever. I also don't personally love ice cream cake but if you do, this is a not to miss dessert. #catch #catchnyc #fish #hitme #meatpacking #delicious #good #instagood #delish #yum #yummy #nom #nomnom #awesome #food #eat #eatmore #foodie #foodiegram #topcitybites #feedfeed #zagat #foodie",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

I've heard the hype and my first visit was to the L.A. location for dinner, but I've been planning to venture there for brunch for ages. I recently had the opportunity to do so to treat my sister for her birthday. 4 stars, why? We waited for 20 minutes even though we made reservations and showed up early and the service was rather slow. Maybe I'm being picky there and it was extremely packed because it was the only warm day that week in February and everyone wanted to sit on the 4th floor. Catch NY is borderline 4 or 5 stars and it lives to the hype. I do want to venture there on a summer day to enjoy the outdoors. While we waited, we sat at thw bar and sipped on the non-alcholic Savanah tea (I think that was the name) and it was very delightful. Now the food...one word...AFREAKINMAZING! I ordered the avocado toast and it was the fattest piece of avocado toast I've ever had the pleasure of indulging in. The presentation was rather artsy. My sister had the lobster mac and cheese. My two cousins had the tilapia and the Angus burger. All dishes looked amazing and smelled like we were graced by the foodie gods. Three of us shared the spicy tuna crispy rice appetizer and the waffle Tower because why not?! The spicy tuna crispy rice was delicious! The waffle Tower was my favorite dish - the waffles are GLUTEN FREE FYI. It was towered: waffle, raspberry ice cream, waffle, chocolate ice cream, waffle, vanilla ice cream, waffle. If we're talking about heaven, that's your dish and it was only $15!!!

Uncomfortable about the idea of sharing my Vince Camuto puffer w a roach, I gently moved it only to find the roach politely chilling on the couch, again. At this point, the roach scampered across about four tables when a gent appearing to be a manager came and killed the roach. Said gent then assured us that the restaurant is very clean blah, blah, something something fumigated, blah blah. Obviously, we didn't finish our meals. Best part, Catch only cut our bill IN HALF.

We head upstairs around 10:00 without any problem and go to the rooftop. After buying drinks (which were $20 dollars each!!!)

Overall I think that there are better restaurants in the neighborhood, especially for the price. They tell you that most of the menu items are meant to be shared so we decided to try a few things. Beware, as the portions are small, even for the sharing items. We started out with the MRC roll that was delicious) and two pieces of the fluke, which weren't very memorable. The chicken skewers were okay, they tasted as though they were covered in ketchup instead of chili sauce and could've been cooked just 30 seconds longer. We also ordered the beet salad, very disappointing. It came with 3 pieces of beets and there was way too much dressing on the salad. It seemed as though there was more goat cheese and greens than beets. The wagyu beef tacos were okay, probably the most flavorful thing that we ate. I'd rather have tacos from Chelsea market or somewhere near by to be honest. Lastly we had an order of the truffle Parmesan fries which were delicious along with the seared snapper. The snapper was cooked well and served with a flavorful, tasty side of lobster mashed potatoes. Again, the portion was a bit small for me, but that wasn't a surprise after having the previous courses.

346,XOJJ4DDK2h_3s6djlEp9GQ,Melanie A.,2.0 star rating,"No no and more, no?I've been here multiple times since it opened. I went to the one in Miami when it was open. I typically LOVE anything opened by the EMM group.Catch restaurant is simply too big to care about anyone dining with them. I get it, it's a huge place (now that they expanded to dining on the roof even) and most of the patrons are tourists, but what sucks is that there is a small percentage of people who could become regulars should this place come back around.1- If you make a reservation (which is a must honestly), you will wait at LEAST 30 minutes to be seated. I get it, 10-15, fine. 30 = NO. 30 minutes is short to be honest. If you want to be seated, you must constantly bug the hostesses. We waited ONE HOUR.2 - The waiter KC was not friendly at all. I have a stomach issue and am extremely sensitive to things that are acidic. I figured that Catch would have tons of juices or options for me to still be able to enjoy a mean cocktail. Nope. I explained my sensitivity and he seemed annoyed. Ok, I get it. We live in an era where everyone has some sort of intolerance (meat, dairy, gluten, the list goes on and on), but some people do have very serious reactions to things (like myself). He told me not to look on the menu as far as juices go because a lot of them are pre-made into the drink itself and I could't have some of the other ingredients in the drink (therefore I'd be making an alteration to the menu which they don't do). I ended up getting frustrated and just ordered a vodka pineapple. About 10 minutes later, he came back and said ""I was distracted by the drink situation so do you want your main to come out with everything that your friends ordered?"" I felt like I was being punished for trying to have a drink and enjoy myself.The food was hit or miss. I knew this already because this is how it is every time that I dine here but if you dine at Catch here's what to order:+ Scallop Gnocchi+ Mushroom Spaghetti+ Octopus+ THIS AMAZING FISH that they don't have on the menu online but it came over the lobster mashed potatoes and was awesome+ Lobster mashed potatoes (although you could barely taste the lobster and there were only 2 small pieces in it)Not to order:- Sushi rolls - Lobster mac & cheese- Crunchy rice cakes- Chicken skewers All & all, the place is meh. It's better than Tao for sure, but just go in expecting that the service won't be great and the food will be hit or miss. I do LOVE the ambiance and it is very trendy/fun. There is also rooftop seating so make sure to take advantage of that if you dine here (but make sure to specify beforehand because I could see someone arriving and then asking for the roof and them making you wait a very long time to sit there).Go with a group of friends so everyone can share and try things.

OMG, they offered us a table near the bar to avoid waiting for a table so we took them up on there offer. Found a table within 5 minutes. So we ordered dinner for 2,Appetizers, main course and drinks. My Chardonnay was very sweet almost like a Moscato and my wife's Rose looked like white wine??? The cocktail ""One too many"" was about the only thing that was tasted good the entire night.  All three orders came at the same time, Within 5 minutes of being ordered. I ordered the Mahi-Mahi and my wife ordered the Salmon. My tasted slightly off but didn't pay much mind, but my wife tried a few bites and agreed it didn't taste right. My wife's Salmon had to be sent back 3 times because they kept over cooking it. 3 Times!!  I ordered a double espresso and got a cup with 2 teaspoons of espresso in it. I asked if that was a double and they confirmed. They were nice enough to charge us for 2 Salmon and then comp us for 2 Salmon, ???? . After taking so long my wife's appetite was gone and she just wanted to leave and by then either my Mahi-Mahi or the shrimp appetizer was starting to make her sick. We went to the ""rooftop"" bar which is more of a balcony, but they had people stick eating dinner out there. They were trying to keep the party from disturbing the diners but I would have been really upset if it was us, trying to eat dinner as they switched to club mode while we trying to eat my meal. They did have heat on the balcony too but wow they had it cranked up to the point we had to go back inside because it was too hot. At that point we decided to leave, between the whack music, pretentious atmosphere and horrible meal this place if definitely not on my never to try again list.

We were seated about 20 minutes after our reservation time; not that big a deal because it allowed us to get a drink at the bar before dinner... Anways, we were finally able to sit down and were attended to fairly quickly for menus, water, and our drink order but the server also took forever to bring out drinks because he spilled my wine on himself -- I was disappointed they didn't come by to advise on what happened with it; we waited like 15+ minutes for 2 glasses of wine -- they could have just communicated instead of making us wonder if our drink order was being attended to. No communication and no comped drink :-(Anyways, I was pleased with the descriptions of the food options on the RW menu.  It was filling, but not the best food ever.  - Sushi roll - I was intrigued by this, especially the mango dipping sauce.  Thought it was filling for an appetizer- Ceviche dish - pretty good and large.  Not the brightest flavors, but I appreciate the concept.  Could have used a little more tang; I thought it tasted more bitter than sour.- Salmon / Mahi mahi - both were just okay, neither fish was OMG!  Which is what I wanted from a fish place.  They were both cooked a little over medium, with no skin, so I thought they lacked a little flavor.   I liked the brown butter sauce that was served on the side, but didn't use too much because it was a little overpowering- Smore's dessert - while i was disappointed we didn't get the full pizza, I loved this dessert, especially with the graham ice cream on the side.  Awesome idea and execution! Maybe their Restaurant Week offerings aren't as great as their normal menu? I hope, at least. However, the space is really nice. The main restaurant/bar space looks vast and it looks really classy down there.  We sat on the upstairs garden level where the floor to ceiling windows really let in a ton of natural light.  The ceilings / vents looked a little dusty though, which kind of turns me off -- it's all in the details!",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

Also, a few dishes came with a choice of sauce, and when we realized that and asked him about it he said he'd just chosen for us - i would have obviously preferred to make my own choice.The kicker was that when I went to the restroom, they have a bathroom attendant (ridiculous to begin with).

The drinks were strong and the staff was attentive/provided great service!The second visit, about a week ago for a Thursday night dinner with GF and her family, was unbelievably disappointing! Sorry for this super long recap...We had reservations for 8:15 PM, but they table wasn't ready and the hostess told us to check back in when ""the whole party arrives."" We got two drinks from the bar and they were good, overly priced (like this whole place) as we waited then at 8:33, rest of our party arrived and we got the buzzer thing. Shortly after, we stood around in the bar area and hung out for a bit before ordering some more drinks at a bar table, probably 9:10ish - but by 9:25 or so, the drinks hadn't arrived and our reserved table still was not ready (even after checking back with the hostess multiple times).Finally, at 9:45 PM, we were taken to our table... upstairs... in another bar area... in front of the massive and loud DJ speakers!! We were already so annoyed and very hungry, so we just sat down and started looking at the menu, waiting for the waiter. Since we never got the bar table drinks, we had to reorder and wait longer for drinks... the wait staff, Jeff, finally came over and took our drink order - but wasn't willing to take our food, since he ""had 3 others in his head...""My GF's mother is gluten-intolerant and as expected, wanted to ask questions about certain dishes. Our new waiter (since Jeff was too busy??) was very informative and helpful with the allergen info of the questionable dishes... BUT even though for some items, we explicitly said ""let's get it, us three will eat it even if she cannot"" they definitely did not put it in the order, because it (specifically french fries) showed up LAST - after all main courses were served.So after ordering which was already 2 hours after original reservation time, we got our first table drinks and minutes later got the first dish/shared app. Then, a supervisor/manager must have told Jeff (the original waiter) to apologize about the long wait as well as confusion about gluten-free plates, he graciously offered a round of drink on the house and ensured the food (estimated value of $75!!!)After we eventually got all the delicious food and strong drinks, it was 11:30 PM or so and there was a massive party walking in.

We had a 7:30 reservation and were seated immediately, which was a relief given many reviewers who reported long wait times despite having reservations.We started with cocktails--the Golden Gimlet for me (Bombay Sapphire, lemongrass cordial, and lime) and the Dirtier Bastard for him (Woodford Reserve bourbon, fresh ginger, lime, lemon-tea cordial), which we were pleased with. The menu is pretty expansive, so it took us a while to determine what we wanted to eat, but we eventually settled on half a dozen East Coast oysters (can't recall the varieties they had that night), catch king crab ceviche (lobster, shrimp, scallop, mango, blood orange ponzu), the hellfire roll (spicy tuna two-ways, pear, balsamic), and the scallop and cauliflower entree (pistachio, tamarind brown butter). Of those, the ceviche was the best--light and fresh with a citrus overtone, though my date kept biting into bits of shell. Similarly, the oysters were good, but his three were gritty, which was unfortunate. The hellfire roll was fine, but sort of uninspired. The scallops in the entree were overcooked and mushy, but still tasted good, and the cauliflower was nice. Other observations: the space is cavernous and feels a little impersonal as a result. Service was good, though our table was wobbly, which we pointed out at the start. A guy came over with a set of chopsticks (?), which he proceeded to wedge under the table. They didn't work because, well, they're chopsticks, so he just jiggled the table around and then walked away. Alrighty.Overall, the best part of the experience was the company.

(My reservation was at 8:30)I thought, sure why not, I will give them some time to clean the table, and here I start my awful journey in catch. Me and my friends wanted some drink when we are waiting, the non alcoholic beverages of course, so we ordered Shirley temple, the bartender was flirting with a male customer when she was making our drinks, which took about 5 minutes. Normally, It have took her only 1 minute. By this point, I was annoyed at how rude these people were, and I wanted to be nice because it was my birthday dinner.After another long wait, around 9pm, I was very angry at how long we waited. My friend went to the front desk twice asking how long and they said that we only need to wait another 5 more minutes. I thought, I have waited 30 minutes, I'm just going to tolerate this 5 more minute. 5 minutes passes and no one came to us telling us the table is ready. I walked up to the front desk lady and asked her 3 questions.1) how long are we going to wait for?""I don't know yet we are running behind our schedule""2)my reservation was at 8:30, it is 9:10 right now, reservation, means that we have a table reserved ready for us, where is it?""Just a few more minutes we are getting ready.""3)how many people are in front of us?She looked at the reservations and told me ""no one""BOOM, there you go, now get us seated.She had that""ew she found me out"" face and I thought that I did something significant in history by getting me and my friends seated.

I was at this restaurant twice and both times we had a reservation and had to wait for about an hour to be sitted. What's the purpose of the reservation then? The tables and chairs are so close to each other that my seat was in everyone way (at least it felt this way) and I constantly got bumped into by the waiters. The place is huge and it gets extremely noisy. That's fine for the bar, but not expensive dining area. Both times our waiters were extremely arrogant, didn't ask if we needed anything and taking an order seemed like they were doing us a favor. The prices are high at this restaurant and I'm ok paying them if it's worth it and this is not for me. The food was good, everyone was happy at our table.

However once we did sit down we got a great table outside on the balcony.The restaurant is very loud and is more like a club as the night goes on so if you want to eat it's probably better to come earlier or see if you can sit out on the quieter balcony.The restaurant week menu was good, if a little plain. The chicken skewers I had to start were nice and flavourful but the main course of fish on a plank (salmon for me, mahi mahi for my boyfriend) was just a little plain, and very salty.Overall we had a nice evening but not sure I would return as the food was nothing brilliant, but perhaps that was just because it was restaurant week.",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

This was my first visit with a full sit down meal. We started by ordering some specialty cocktails. We had the strawberry heaven and the fistful of berries. Both were very tasty and neither were overly sweet. The size of the cocktails are very generous and one lasted my entire meal- so don't be intimidated by the price. I would also like to mention their AMAZING pretzel bread they give you to start. It is hot and delicious and made me want to give up all hopes for a future diet. We then had a catch roll, crunchy rice cakes and mahi mahi wonton tacos. The roll was good- but I would agree that this may be a bit overpriced. $19 for one roll?! It was definitely good, but nothing spectacular. Also- catch, step up your chopsticks! I know this is minor, but you could tell they were cheap and were splintering like crazy. At least give me some decent sticks to enjoy my $19 roll! The crunchy rice cakes are a favorite of mine. So good! Their tartare is amazing. The mahi mahi tacos were also fantastic. After all of these starters we decided to split our entree. We had the sautéed snapper that was out of this world. Cooked to perfection and served with lobster mash. Even though we agreed to split- we fought over each bite because it was so good. Lastly, for the grand finale, we ordered the apple pie donut. Yes, you heard that right. A crazy mixture of two delicious items perfectly combined into one. I still dream about it and think about it frequently. I want one right now. I mean come on- just stop.

We originally planned to come here for the RW Menu but after having a look at the huge menu, we decided to try a number of items to share.We had the crispy shrimp, mahi mahi wonton tacos, MRC roll, and the spicy yellowfin tuna roll. The crispy shrimp was one of the best we have had - perfect size and very flavourful. The mahi mahi tacos were delicious as well, but I would prefer without the lettuce at the bottom. The MRC roll was very unique and I highly suggest it. $18 for a sushi roll you say? Compared to the other sushi places I have been to in NYC so far, this place takes the cake and I would gladly pay that much for good quality unique sushi rolls. The spicy yellowfin tuna roll was also quite delicious. We were going to get dessert but decided to get another roll instead so we chose the Hellfire roll. It was okay, but not spicy at all, so I would skip that and get the MRC instead.I had this drink that was amazing called the Savannah Sipper which had english breakfast tea, peach, lemon juice and mint - I would definitely recommend it!I kept hearing complaints from the two tables on either side of us about how the hostess didn't want to seat them - we did not get that vibe so I'm not sure why that happened to them.

Waitresses only suggest the most expensive dishes and always tell you every dish tastes amazing. The food here isn't really that good and the portions are very small. What really put things over the top for me was when I order a mixed drink with tequila (my own rendition of a mojitio) since they didn't have any on the drink menu, it wasn't even good. On top of that, when we received the bill, she charged my wife and I $27 per drink  ($9 for drink mix (mint leaves and club soda) $18 for shot of patron). I feel like $27 for a mojito is excessive. Our bill was $200 (including tip) for 2 appetizers, 2 entrees & 2 drinks. I'm pretty much done with Catch. Don't go, save your money.

Anyways for lunch they have a sort of prix fixe option. They called it a lunch box. And it's a lighter lunch. It was reasonably priced but the portion is tiny. I think we were all satisfied but not full or stuffed. So the price still didn't match the amount of food. But this is considered a higher end restaurant.

I would not make a big deal out of this normally, but both me and my guest experienced quite debilitating nausea following the meal.

Trendy and expensive is a good way to describe Catch.  Notice that those two words say nothing about the food.  In my opinion, the food was standard but for the price and the presentation, it should have been much better.  We shared a bunch of small plates, and not once during the meal did I feel as if anything was really really good.  The best thing I ate here was a small one piece sushi appetizer.  I can say that the fish was super fresh and good. Id have the sushi here again, but thats about it.  There are restaurants in NYC that are cooler, cheaper, and have better food.  We didnt even order an entree because after the appetizers, the prices were too high.  Did I enjoy my food? Yeah, sure.  Would I come back? Probably not.

The sizes of the dishes are decent too.Great place to eat overall, however  be careful witg thise elevators... As my date and I were leaving, we got stuck in the elevator along with another couple.  We were there for about 10 minutes I think and finally we were rescued. The  manager  was there to freet us and be sure that no one was hurt and was extremely  apologetic. He also advised us that we could have whatever  we wanted for our troubles. So we return to the upstairs area and the staff was advised to give us whatever  we wanted.Drinks, shots and more drinks we had lol! Also dessert.

416,EQPgp_WluL6Ufl7KZ7S0Sw,Dan R.,3.0 star rating,"Strange to think one of my favorite pasta dishes in the city can be found at some trendy Asian Fusion spot in the Meatpacking, but here I am, praising Catch's outstanding King Crab Spaghetti. It's a steaming heap of carbs tossed in spicy tomato sauce, scallion, fish roe, and sweet crustacean meat, with delicious, decadent, yet delicate results. I could eat this dish every time I'm at Catch and certainly planned to on my most recent visit. The only problem is, well, they've taken it off the menu.Blasphemous, I know. I was told it makes appearances here and there as a special, but I'm honestly shocked. Evidently, I've held Catch's King Crab Spaghetti in higher regard than the restaurant itself, as I've always considered it to be a signature dish. Shows what I know. Without it, I'm afraid I finally see Catch for what it's worth - another see-and-be-seen scene that prioritizes ambiance over everything else.The first hint should be the skyscraper-sized model-hostesses that dominate the front of the house. The second is, well, the restaurant's Meatpacking address and the fact that they wouldn't let our party up on their exclusive rooftop without buying a bottle, after dropping a significant bill down on dinner moments prior. Needless to say, we opted against their theme park-style of pricing - a bit of a letdown, but unfortunately not unheard of in this area.While it's undeniable Catch caters to scenesters and their well-to-do suitors, there are still some bright spots on the menu (with or without said spaghetti), which is dominated by showy small plates - that's to say, overpriced but still satisfying. The staples appear to be their Crispy Shrimp, Crispy Rice Cakes, Macaroni & Lobster Cream, and Bourbon-Miso Sea Bass ""Wraps"" (this last one being my personal favorite). If you're looking for something to splurge on from the Big Fish section, the Crispy Whole Snapper (Catch likes things Crispy, apparently) is probably worth the hefty price tag, especially on someone else's tab. For dessert, at one point, I would've sworn to you that the S'mores Pizza was near revelatory. But on my latest trip, it tasted like chocolate syrup drizzled over burnt crackers and I was embarrassed to have hyped it up as something more to my dining crew.Despite my mixed feelings on this Meatpacking hot spot, Catch certainly serves a purpose or two. By Manhattan standards, it's a huge, three-story affair, and large reservation-ready. Yet despite its big, brash personality seemingly custom-built for big groups, date night here is not unheard of, either. It has a unique, refurbished vibe with big brick walls that evoke colonial shipyard chic. And if its clientele is corporate accounts and Kendall Jenner-esque starlets, all the power to 'em.I'm sure I haven't seen the last of Catch - a big group dinner will bring me back here, no doubt. And then all I can do is hope I haven't seen the last of that King Crab Spaghetti. Claws crossed.",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

No ""I apologize for the wait"" They didn't try to accommodate us in any way.  The girls were very unprofessional and really didn't care about anyone waiting ( we weren't the only ones)  We decided to leave 55 minutes after waiting and went close by to Barbuto where we were treated very well and had a delicious meal.  Wont try again because of the way we were treated.",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

I've been here so many times for dinner and drinks in  lounge afterwards. This was my first time here for brunch. We ordered a couple bottles of champagne for the table, we were a group of 5, and then proceeded to order our food. The food was good, I would try to stay away from the basic breakfast staples because they really can do so much more. I had the grilled octopus, it was really well flavored and cooked. I also split the hellfire roll with my girlfriend. It was a good amount of food, I was satiated after eating it. We all split two of the s'more pizzas for dessert. I didn't have any, I was full but everyone seemed to love it. It smelled delicious when it came out. Now the problem. It was the service. I'm taking away two stars because of our server, that is how bad she was. When we got there we had high hopes because she was great initially but once she took our order, we never saw her again until she dropped the check. We had to ask a busboy to get her for the check, and even then it took her 7 'minutes to come over. We didn't have water refilled, couldn't order additional drinks, and someone got the wrong dish, but we just left it alone because it would have taken too long to order the correct roll. So Nikita was pretty oblivious to us. We all ended up paying about 100 dollars a person but we had a lot of fancy pants drinks.

Everyone was getting dumped into the black hole. We eventually got our table after going back and insisting on someone doing something to get us seated. To their credit, they did appear alarmed that we had waited as long as we had to sit down.Even great restaurants in this town have relatively short lives. The ones that have lasted more than 20 years can be counted on two hands. This place will fail quickly without better management and people training.The food was good, hence the 2 stars vs 1. Other people who have tried to justify the poor service based on their decision to eat later, or just that the scene is, albeit, pretty crazy late night, do not understand how fast this gets really old.

Our waitress that served us was friendly, polite and knowledgeable about the menu. The reason I am giving this restaurant a one star rating is for the rude and unprofessional service I received when calling about glasses left in the restaurant.First problem: the number online for the restaurant does not put you in touch with the restaurant directly or provide you any way of speaking to a manager or hostess directly to address the issue.Second (and biggest) problem: The staff answering the phones ""in the corporate office"" are extremely rude, unhelpfuI, and unapologetic. I also had to speak to two women on the phone as the first one hung up on me and I needed to call back.  The second staff member, Camille, was unapologetic, curt, and could not be bothered to help me find my lost glasses. When I expressed concern the glasses could be under the table and stepped on, she simply replied, ""I'm sure if somebody stepped on them, they would know."" Rather than being proactive to help locate them as soon as possible, Camille was more than happy to return stepped on glasses. What exceptional service...

The macaroni and lobster cream was my favorite, although I do wish it was a bigger serving size. It wasn't hard to decide on the ""hit me"" for dessert. It's devils food cake, served with ice cream, and topped off with a klondike bar.

458,4vxi25rA2nac0SP7xUwHvg,Michelle B.,5.0 star rating,"I was a little hesitant to come here after reading all the negative reviews, but after eating here on Friday night - I have no clue what those people are talking about! FOOD: (My boyfriend and I split everything and were stuffed by the end of the meal)- Lobster Mashed Potatoes: out of all the dishes, my least favorite. But that's not saying that it wasn't good! I appreciate the chunks of lobster in there and that the lobster didn't overwhelm the dish. It doesn't look like much, but this is part of what made me so full by the end of the meal- Mahi Mahi Wonton Tacos: three to an order, but the waiter told us that he could add on an extra one. They are fairly small, and seem to be more guacamole than fish. I like the idea of a wonton taco - I love hard shells, so this only enhanced the crunch factor. - Scallop Gnocchi: I've had scallops before, and I've had gnocchi before - but not like this! The scallops were cooked perfectly and the gnocchi was pillowy. The gnocchi was some sort of scallop purée in the middle and it is toasted so that it is still pretty sturdy. I'm so glad that I ordered this over the Mac and cheese. - Hit Me dessert: this is what drew me to Catch in the first place. It includes their version of a Klondike bar (what would you doOOoo for a Klondike bar?), so don't expect a molten lava cake kinda thing. It's served cool - the ice cream is obviously cold, the rest are room temperature. Yeah, I would've appreciated if the chocolate fondue was warm and the brownie on the bottom was too. But still, a great dessert overall. - Savannah Sipper: I opted for one of the non-alcoholic drinks (though the others did look tempting). It very refreshing and went especially well with the tacos - and not too minty!SERVICE: We had a reservation for 6 PM on a Friday night, but we got there a bit earlier (I left right after work). They led us to a waiting area that we could sit at. Shortly after, we were seated. Our waiter was fantastic - he was very attentive and friendly. When we asked him about the gnocchi, he was able to give us an in-depth description of what is inside if and how it was cooked. The bus boys are definitely on their game, almost to the point that it seemed like they were hovering around us to refill our waters and clear our plates. LOCATION: I'll admit, it's not the easiest place to find. Thank goodness I read these reviews! It's located above Sephora and the entrance is on the side (away from the scaffolding). You walk in and and take an elevator to the second floor to get to the restaurant. They've got a slight nautical theme going on, and all the wood decor made me feel like I was in a wine cellar or something. Ambiance is pretty casual - the type of place you'd wear jeans and a nice top to. I think I'm a pretty reasonable person. I don't typically go to many fancy restaurants on the regular. This is the meat packing district - so of course it's going to be beautiful and the prices are going to be more expensive. That's a given.

I love the way it is. And the portion is huge! For a normal person, this can be their entree! - Grilled octopus: the octopus is oh so soft and tender at the same time. The potatoes with the garlic aioli was very good as well. - Crunchy rice cakes: My least favourite dish but probably because I don't like tuna tartare. But it was very well-presented- Scallop and Cauliflower: AMAZING! This is the only restaurant that I've been which gives you more than 5 big scallops. I normally don't fancy cauliflower but they did a great job blending it with the scallop- Grilled Swordfish with tamarind brown butter sauce: Not a fan of swordfish but they have limited choices so i went with that. The tamarind sauce was amazing!- Parmesan truffle fries: Really good but a bit overpriced for a side dishThe food, decor and service were all 5-star. But I was a bit disappointed with the way the waiter got me to order the side. When I ordered the swordfish, he asked ""what do you want for your side"". That makes me think the side was included which I thought it makes sense given the swordfish doesn't come with anything else. But it was not included! $12 is nothing compare to our total bill.

The bisque was good and came in a very interesting contraption that heated it up. There was also about a pound of butter in there which is probably their secret ingredient. The soup is $24 and it's enough for 2 bowls filled halfway. The crispy shrimp were these tiny shrimps fried and tossed in this delicious spicy sauce. They were my favorite but unfortunately cost $20 for 2 handfuls. The lobster Mac was a lot smaller than I expected but really delicious and full of lobster pieces. The sauce tasted like it was lobster bisque. It was $23 for a skillet about 6 inches in diameter. My absolute favorite part of the whole night and what I was looking forward to most was the dessert. We got the ""hit me"" chocolate cake. Um who cares what was in it because it looks awesome and it's the best thing you'll ever eat.

The lobster roll I had was okay and the omelet and mahi mahi dish was also okay. For the price catch sells these Simple dishes we tried, I think I've found some better food in other places.

We politely asked if it would be possible to get another table and wait a bit, but we're rudely dismissed by the hostesses who had so many people to deal with. Part of the problem was the movie premiere which used the entire upstairs for their private party with so much security I thought the president was visiting. Our waitress Samantha was amazing, cheerful, and did her very best to make the experience fun for us. Despite the uncomfortable table where two of us 6'4"" tall were in tiny seats blocking the aisle, we really enjoyed the food beginning with 2 dozen fresh oysters, spicy sashimi and salmon carpaccio. Anthony assisted Sam and helped with the wine selection and kept it flowing to ease our pain. First courses of all the sushi rolls were fabulous and we ordered their top 3 sellers including the Catch roll and all were great. The main courses of all the hot fish were 5*, branzino, salmon, and I had the whole dorado which was so flavorful and perfectly done I ate every bite. No room for desserts although Anthony said the dessert chef makes some of the best in NYC even though he has had no formal training.  We'll definitely be back to try them and not order so many sushi rolls next time.

Food was good but pricey.  Service was mediocre and hostess was rude.  We were brought to our table and I noticed there was a huge gap in the cushion on the bench right where I was supposed to sit. It was at least 3 inches wide. When I noted it to the hostess she just shrugged and said it's like that. I pointed it out to her because I was certain she didn't realize how big the gap actually was. She shrugged again. I asked if we could change tables and she said no. I understand it was a Friday night and there were probably multiple reservations, but we had booked a table earlier in the week and there were plenty that were still available. I was shocked. So instead, I had to literally sit on the 3 inch crack. I emailed the restaurant to provide feedback and never received a response. The meal was delicious, despite the fact that the waiter forgot to deliver one of our side dishes. It's just unfortunate that we had such poor initial service.

You have to walk in, take the elevator to the second floor and if your party is not on that floor, you have to walk up a flight of stairs to their second level. A bit cumbersome maybe but it was cool to be off the street.Ambiance in this place is nice too. It's dark but full of energy, with tables close enough to peek over and see what other people have ordered. This is a good place for a date or a dinner with some close friends.The food is definitely Asian fusion in the true sense of the word. You can get a roll with salmon on top but the waiter will whip out a torch and give the salmon a quick char. Or you can get a tuna roll but it'll be served on a rice cake instead of a traditional rice roll. Rock shrimp is a must order (we ordered two).

Make sure to have a reservation and be prepared for the bill, because it's not cheap. Also be prepared to get 1/4 of what you actually were expecting, the servings are tiny, so order for yourself and not for the group.The food was served beautifully and tasted pretty good, great place for food porn pictures. I went with two others, for appetizer we got: crab handroll, sashimi truffle, and lobster Mac and cheese. For entrees we got: snapper, the crispy chicken, and 10 oz filet. The crab roll was a crab filled crêpe and it was good, kind of how you would expect it to taste. It was a little sweet and fishy, overall fresh. The sashimi truffle was so good, I can't really describe it, it was very savory, if you like truffle - it's a must get. The lobster Mac and cheese is the craze of the place, I would recommend it since it's what everyone talks about. It was good, kind of how you would expect it to taste. Again, this one we wanted to share, however, it was quite small and we had to carefully ration the servings, haha. On to the entrees, my filet was cooked the perfect medium rare, very juicy and delicious. Honestly the sauce that came with it was too reminiscent of barbecue sauce, I was expecting a little bit more that went with the flavor better. The chicken was done well. I don't remember the snapper. For desert, the pumpkin donut was very good, it was super sweet, but balanced by the ice cream, and it was very fall-like. Also, the hit me, was so good, probably would go again for just that, the presentation is so clever and the little label that says #hitme is also very cute. If you are a foodie, visit catch, great location - next to the high line, and great aesthetics inside also. Why a 4 and not a 5 star rating? My experience might be a bit biased, but we ended up paying around 230 for all 3 of us, so we split it evenly including the tip, however, since I was the only one paying with card, the place overcharged me around $50. It was annoying and frustrating since I could not call them because their lines close later in the night and no one was picking up.

Once inside however, you're treated to a largely  sized venue that will instantly put you in a good mood. The food is good but nothing special in my opinion. I had the crispy shrimp, which were pretty good. However, considering the many places you can go for outstanding seafood, and crispy shrimp in particular, this was nothing special. I also had the scallops in tamarind sauce which was pretty enjoyable. Being an island boy, I'll eat anything with tamarind associated with it.Service is very good considering how jam packed this place gets. Our wait to be seated was only about 10 minutes.

Seeing tuna tartare topped crunchy rice cakes on the menu, you're not really sure what to expect but definitely intrigued. What you get is a lightly, flash fried rectangle of sticky rice topped with tuna tartare and wasabi tobiko. Biting into it, you get a multitude of textures, flavors and temperatures. On the top of your mouth you get a cold, somewhat finely pureed tuna tartare. On the bottom, your teeth crunch through the lightly fried exterior of the rice cake before being met with a warm, sticky interior. Each piece is about three bites, with 3-4 pieces per plate depending on the order size ($16/$22).

Well some of the food was very good but other dishes were just OK (specifically the lobster mac and cheese). I have had much better lobster mac and cheese at Poco and in Harlem at 9A Kitchen and lounge. For a fine seafood establishment such as Catch, they should have decent lobster mac and cheese. The noodles were thin, hard actual macaroni noodles, not enough cheese and not as tasty or creamy as it should be. It was rather watery.The service at the restaurant was OK. We waited almost 30 minutes for our table. The server greeted us rather quickly and food came fast as well. ( our reservations were for 8:15 we got seated around 8:45-9pm)After dinner around 10:45 we inquired about rooftop which opened at 10pm. It apparently was up to the doorman to decide who had access to the rooftop. When 2 of our party (there were 6 of us) asked about the rooftop the doorman said it was bottle service Only. I personally believe that was crap! We had just finished dinner where we dishes out hundreds of dollars and now we had to buy bottles upstairs? I believe he didn't allow us up because of our appearances or at least the two that inquired  at the door. (Both very attractive woman but in their 40s). I was extremely embarrassed because i suggested the place and now we couldnt even go up and see the place! Well needless to say I, WE will never be returning! The hostesses also all seemed puzzled I have to add and boy I have never seen so many groups of men dining alone. It was quite weird. The restaurant ambience was nice, nice location and nice staff. Rooftop however, a different story!NEVER AGAIN! especially with so many great places in the area including the gansevort right across the street which is where we went to afterwards.",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

517,i-7YhFUmrkAhez_ZcgUJ8g,Sam W.,5.0 star rating,"Catch NYC, is probably one of the best restaurants Ihave been to in NYC, and I've been to quite a few. Me and my girlfriend, were craving seafood and I saw this place a while back (a video about their Hit Me! Chocolate Cake) and look into their menu, and thought it was a great menu. So I made reservations for 9 p.m. (make reservations people....its a great idea). This place was packed and it wasa Thursday night  (I'll be it was also Cinco De Mayo, the bar and restaurant was packed). We waited about 15-20 minutes for our table. When we were seated (at a very nice booth) we could instantly see the wait was worth it, the decor and ambience was very nice; dim lighting but not to dim and very romantic. The service here is top notch; it was packed but our server (Brandon if I'm remembering correctly) was extremely nice and checked in to see if we were ok and enjoying ourselves, when we decided to order and entrée way after we had already ordered our appetizers he took or order and made sure we got the food. When we went to order, we decided to go with a bunch of their tapas (and later an entrée) let me tell you their food is amazing and really fresh.Appetizer/Tapas: We started with their Toro Tartare with caviar, wasabi & soy, this tartare is the best me and my girlfriend have ever had and we've had many, so light and fresh, the caviar gave it just the right amount of salty and the soy didn't overpower it at all, while the wasabi added just the right amount of heat, we could have eaten just a big bowl of that it was so good. Next we got the Lobster Rolls; lobster salad on a potato roll with chives, my girlfriend really liked it, it had a generous portion of lobster in it and wasn't very mayonnaisey, it was very light and the potato roll went great with it. Next came the Scallop Gnocchi; bay scallops, black truffle, parmesan, this was like eating a cloud, the Gnocchi was the best I have ever had and I've been to some of the best Italian restaurants in NYC, it was so amazingly light (it looked like they were rolled into a cylindrical shape) you bite into it and its just so airy, like little pieces of heaven and the bay scallops were so fresh and their sweetness paired amazing well with the Gnocchi and the parmesan gave it a nice salty taste, it was an extremely well balanced dish, my girlfriend said it was the best of the night. Next came the Wagyu Short Rib Tacos; grilled pineapple and pickled vegetables topped with a ginger aiol, the meat was amazing, so tender, the grilled pineapple added a nice mild sweetness to the dish and the pickled vegetables added some saltiness, it was overall very well balanced and probably my favorite of the appetizers (which explains why i inhaled the 4 of them within minutes of getting it).For the entrée we ordered the Sautéed Local Snapper with truffle on lobster mash with a lemon brown butter sauce. By this point we were completely stuffed and we thought to ourselves how are we going to eat this, but once we dug our forks in the snapper and tasted it, i knew we'd be able to finish it, and finish it we did. The snapper was so fresh, perfectly cooked, nice and delicate but at the same time meaty. It was delicious. The lobster mash was amazing, it was lobstery, buttery, creamy but light and it was a great bed for the snapper. The lemon brown butter sauce was nice and lemony and that helped cut through the richness of the mash. A very nice bite when put all together. We finished the entire dish, i was so full but i couldn't put down my fork and just kept eating the Snapper, when that happens you know the dish is fantastic. Overall, this restaurant has a great ambience, great service and amazing fresh seafood. Yeah its a bit pricey, but here you pay for quality ingredients and not frills. Definitely will be coming back here again.",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

I also had the mahi mahi tacos ($17 for 4) and man, I did I love them... Is there a taco that I don't love? Maybe not but those mini tacos were definitely worth the money.

Prior to being at Catch we were at a bar for 2 or 3 drinks. We then headed to Catch. We got to Catch and immediately 2 of us got violently ill (one was me). While I was COMPLETELY COHERENT, my friend was not as lucky. One minute she was talking with us and taking photos the next she went completely limp and was vomiting. Shortly after this I became ill and was projectile vomiting. I was completely aware of my surroundings etc. While I must state that Catch had nothing to do with us falling ill, the way this was handled by your establishment was mind blowing. We went to management for help and were told by a blonde manager that all our friend needed was ""some bread, water and we could get back to raging"". The one woman with us is a licensed nurse and immediately was at our sides asking a manager to call 911, checking pulses, etc. This same blonde manager told the nurse that she was ""a f*$%^)"" nurse and to handle it"" and later told her that she was overreacting. 2 male managers then stepped in. I understand that there is no protocol for an event like this but when the ambulance finally arrived the paramedics were told that they couldn't bring a gurney up to the 2nd floor b/c there was no elevator. There indeed, is an elevator. We all rode it up to the 2nd floor upon arriving to ""Catch"". The paramedics were livid with management as well. I understand that in this business you probably see all types of incidences involving alcohol. But your management staff quickly judged my group of friends as ""ragers"" and treated us terribly. Any time an ambulance is involved, time is of the essence. There were many customers in your ladies restrooms that evening offering help, cell phones and glasses of water.

When we arrived to the second floor hostess station, it was a complete circus. The blonde on the end was more concerned with her cell phone than directing or even making eye contact with the growing line of customers. After she walked away, leaving a frustrated waiting line, we were told that check in was at the other end of the hostess desk. Well there were about 5 girls working, who were obviously incapable of running a hostess station. Our reservation was for 9:15, but we arrived a bit early, so eventually we were given a pager and told to wait at the bar. We got drinks and waited and waited, watching people come and go...so finally at 9:45 we asked how much longer until we were seated. The pager never went off, which the girls behind the hostess station tested, and it didnt work! Are u kidding me? So they told us to step aside and that our table was being set and we would be seated next. Well...yet again, they seated more and more people as we stood there. We again approached the hostess station asking what the status was...she again asked the last name and told us to wait...what?!!!

I was told this would be a great place for my friends bachelorette as it's a ""hot spot"" and turns into a club after dinner. The process of planning the event (18 people total) was a nightmare. They made us sign a contract that costs $140 per person not including drinks/tip/tax. This seemed outrageous but worth it if we were able to eat on the rooftop and stay after dinner for drinks/celebrations.From the moment we arrived promptly before our 10:30 reservation we were treated disrespectfully. They had no idea who the reservation was for and when they finally figured it out had no table ready. We saw them setting up a cluster of tables on the first floor bar. I asked them about the rooftop that had been promised and they said rooftop seating had ended. This was perplexing as they had suggested the 10:30 reservation in the first place and we requested rooftop.The table they were setting up was way too small so we asked to be moved as we didn't want to have 18 people crammed into a tiny space. They agreed to move us and we did not sit until midnight.When we were finally seated we were not greeted by any servers no one asked for our drink orders and the food took another 40 minutes to arrive. The food was mediocre and essentially kraft mac'n cheese and chicken fingers for $150.When the bill came they charged our vegan friend the full pre-fixed amount even though they agreed it would not be as she only could eat a small portion of the food. They also insisted on the 5% administration fee even though the horrible service and lack of respect.We were also told we were not allowed to go to the rooftop unless we went downstairs and waited in line. After arguing with the management for 30 minutes we wanted NOTHING to do with this place or their rooftop.Please do NOT come here for any special event as they will treat you as if they are doing you a favor letting you eat there.

And I'm not just talking about the fact that the bar is on the second floor, and the restaurant is actually on the the third.I'm talking about how big and open this space is. I'm talking about how nice it is to see the cobbled stone streets of the Meatpacking from the third floor while you're having a glass of wine and sharing a plate of grilled octopus with your friends on one of the last warm summer nights of the year and not feeling crowded or rushed.This is a really great place to have a group dinner if you like seafood. There is a lot of variety on the menu, and it's way more fun to try a lot of different things, especially when they are really good.I thought the hot apps were way better than the main courses. Try the mahi mahi wonton tacos, the king crab spaghetti, the scallop gnocchi, the lobster mashed potatoes, and the aforementioned grilled octopus. If you like something simple, you can also get grilled seafood, which comes with a variety of delicious sauces, like... truffle kobeyaki butter, umm, yeah. If you're more adventurous or you feel like dropping a lot of cash, you can also get a whole king crab, or cantonese style lobster. They looked pretty amazing, but a little bit too messy for this occasion.Oh, and the pretzel bread. The very soft, very warm, freshly baked pretzel bread with very, very amazing mustard butter on the side. Mmmm.The food did not disappoint. Our waiter was also on point.

Sometimes it can be a hit or miss, and you never know what kind of dining experience you'll get. As far as Catch goes we were thoroughly surprised. The restaurant has a very industrial feel, with bricked walls and metal piping along the ceiling. It definitely feels like a part of old New York, which you don't find much of in the city anymore. The space is large and you can probably get a reservation for a large group as long as you make a reservation a head of time.We came here with a party of 7 and had a cozy booth to ourselves. We basically ordered family style off of the menu and got to try several dishes, which I would recommend.Some of the things we got were the chicken lettuce cups, crispy rice cakes, crispy shrimp, the mushroom spaghetti, lobster mac n cheese, and the Branzino. I enjoyed everything and probably would come back in the summer to enjoy dining on the rooftop as well. On the weekends, if you're not dining too late you can check out the rooftop without a cover. Just talk to one of the staff members and they'll help you get upstairs. Otherwise the minimum, as most place in meatpacking can get a bit ridiculous. Also.. This place is know for the #HitMe cake.

Oh but wait- they charge BY THE GLASS for soda- I find that very odd. A half-glass of soda is 4.00? This has to be a joke. At a place where you pay $20+ for a starter and are spending no less than $100/table.. I would expect you to give free refills on fountain soda. It was crazy to me.I asked the wait to kindly advise people of this when they order, and he said ""I can't tell people- I would get in trouble but let me see what I can do"". Needless to say, Catch must really be hurting for business because he was unable to refund me the 4.00 refill.

The lobster mad and cheese (to my delight) was extremely unique-very easy on the cheese, high on flavor. Somehow had a velvety texture without drowning those macaronis in thick cheese! Loved it. The snapper entree was absolutely RIDICULOUS. The fish was a generous size filet cooked to perfection and with just a tiny bit of seasoning, they really let the fish shine. It was served over lobster mashed potatoes which tasted more like lobster than potato (which is how I like it!) The peanut butter soufflé was an array of chocolate peanut butter bites (homemade truffle and ice cream bar) with a finale of a perfectly light an not-too-sweet peanut butter soufflé.

Let me tell you...this was the BEST decision I've ever made.    For appetizers, we had the crispy shrimp, mahi mahi won ton tacos, summer shrimp roll, and the catch roll. Oh-em-gee. All of them were perfection. I did not have one bad thing to say about these dishes. They just had so much flavor. The crispy shrimp was tossed in a spicy mayo. One bite and you just keep wanting more. The other three appetizers were very refreshing. For the entree, I had the sauteed local snapper, lobster mash, truffle, in lemon brow butter. I must say, this was the best choice. The fish was light and the mash was rich and hearty. What was interesting to me was the truffle. It was pureed and was dolloped on the side. All 3 balanced out the dish. I devoured the whole thing. Overall, the portions are on the smaller side but it's just enough to satisfy if you order appetizers along with the entree.

First I asked him for a latte and 20 minutes later her brought the cocktail menu. When I asked about my latte he though I had said ""cocktail."" Next I ordered an egg white omelette (which i specified 3 times) while my friend ordered the health bowl with salmon. My meal came out first and was full eggs, not egg whites. I waited for my friends meal to come out and 5 minutes later, as my eggs are getting cold, they bring her meal and the salmon is raw. It takes 10 minutes for the waiter to come back and they send it back to the kitchen. I eat my meal because its now cold (I did not send mine back) and my friend orders a chardonnay. She specifies which one she wants and the waiter brings her a champagne NOT chardonney...10 minutes later. Finally we get her wine and we ask again about her meal which was now sent back 20 minutes earlier (and had initially arrived 30 minutes earlier). The waiter offers us SHOTS while we wait. It was Sunday brunch and this was totally bizarre. They have now cleared my plate and finally bring her meal and it's the same plate with her fish charred. They didn't make a new one! We asked that they take a drink off the bill for the trouble and again he offers us shots. It was completely bizarre. The bill came and they charged the full amount for the meal. I was shocked given the price of the entrees and the terrible service. Finally I go to use the restroom and the attendant was asleep and let's just say that the toilette's were NOT clean.

For the food, it was fine, but not amazing. My scallops were very unevenly cooked, and had some sand here and there, but the accompaniments were really good. If you do succumb to the trend and decide to go here, get the ""hot stones"" appetizer, where you cook your own beef slices at the table. Desserts were also good, before the check was rudely planted on our table.

After a week of calling every day to get a hold of someone on the events team to discuss setting up a prefix menu, no one reached back out until the night before my reservation. Melyssa said that the menus were $110-135 pp, I asked for an option that was $75 pp (maybe more limited - vegetarian etc). She didn't respond - I had to call 3 more times the day of my reservation to get word to her to respond to my request. Her exact response was ""Unfortunately, I cannot show that much flexibility on cost during prime time. It seems your reservation is already confirms for 10 guests. Please note tables in dining room are reserved for full dining. So you and your guests can order appetizers entrees sides and or deserts from our a la carte menu along with any wines or drinks. If you're looking to snacks and drinks I would recommend snagging a space by the bar area."" I thought this was VERY rude to insinuate to 'huddle around the bar' to someone willing to spend $1000 including tax and tip in your establishment. If it wasn't just a couple hours before my reservation I would have just canceled it at this point. It took me calling back to speak to the manager Carolyn to get it straightened out. She wisely offered the option of pre-ordering the food and drinks that fit within my budget. She was fast, friendly and professional. I picked the food (20 plates!) and requested 4 bottles of house wine for the table and it actually only came up to about $60 pp much less than the $75 pp I offered to Melyssa. All of this pain and stress could have been avoided if I was offered the option of pre-ordering the first time that I inquired. As for the actual service--the table wasn't ready for our reservation so we had to wait about 30 minutes by the very crowded bar which was inconvenient. And the red wine they selected was not good -- we had to swap out for another one.  The actual service by the wait staff was quick and good. The food was excellent.

We arrived early, but they seated us and even visited us three times before taking our orders. Even though every dish wasn't a home run, the ones we liked were incomparable- hence they get my 5 stars.Instead of bread, the meal comes with warm pretzels ringed like mini doughnuts. Smear a little mustard butter on these and they're a thing of beauty. The soft pretzel is enhanced by a slight sweetness in the butter. The butter was barely mustardy. It was so pure, I'm sure an Amish dairy maiden would approve. Eat them hot!Tuna Poke: Order this. The tuna in this dish was so clean and tasty. I've never had tuna like this before. The soy must be tamari because it lends a subtle flavor enhancer. The few macadamia were small, but provided a slight textural contrast that didn't overwhelm the rest of the dish.Wild Tasmanian Sea Trout: $40. Was it worth it? Maybe not, but it was good. Small slabs of sea trout that if grabbed off the grill quickly enough were only partially cooked, maintaining their creaminess. Not fishy at all, the shaved truffle was great. My only critique is the hoisin sauce. Personally I found this too strong for the exquisiteness of this dish. Otherwise, order this because you probably haven't had sea trout like this.Gilled Octopus: We live in Astoria where we can get octopus salad for breakfast. We have NEVER had octopus this tender or fresh. The chirozo is really mild, so don't expect a big hit of paprikaish, Spanish sausage. The potato in this shatters. How do they do that?Lobster Mashed Potatoes: This side comes a slight shade of Oompaloompa, in a 1/2 quart copper butter pan, topped with a lobster claw. Butterphobes beware. If you like all things French, you'll probably like these. My husband and I also found at least four sizable chunks of lobster surreptitiously buried in this buttery mound.If you like sweet cocktails I recommend the Hermes. Not overly sweet, this drink, with its grassiness, reminds me of summer. I also recommend the Seraphina. Not as sweet as the Hermes, this drink still satisfies my sweet tooth.

The hostesses were gorgeous, but not very helpful. Our hostess straight up forgot to seat us... I do want to know where she got her black leather pants though. The food was a bit bland to be honest, except for the Macaroni and Lobster Cream. That mascarpone was sublime. The drinks were delicious and the Seedless Suzy was calling my name all night. Smore's pizza was a bit gimmicky. Still, it's bread, marshmallows and chocolate; You can't really go wrong.Also, the most INSANE thing happened while we were eating. An older gentleman started getting vertigo, and he forgot where he was. His waitress started screaming for help in the restaurant. My friend is an EMT, but there was a nurse in the restaurant who ran to help instead.

Not a place to take your family or even a date if you are looking for something more intimate.Our server did get our order mixed up, but they were quite kind about it. One thing I thought was odd was that when they brought an incorrect order to our table (they had wrote it down wrong) they did not just leave it for us! This is contrary to something I have grown accustomed to in restraunts-- if the house makes a mistake, you get the pleasure of sampling two meals for your trouble.

Waited an hour past my reservation time in the overly crowded foyer, to check in is just a nightmare! Fast forward to sitting down, our appetizer came out 15 minutes before our wine, however the lobster cocktail was delightful! The wine we chose was great, first a glass of Malbec, then the Sommelier pick Hand of God Malbec. Which also took an extensive time to arrive at the table. Not to mention the waiter annihilated the cork on a decent bottle of wine. The scallops were salty, over to under cooked depending on which one I cut in to. The cauliflower however was divine!! The Wagyu to cook on the Rock is both entertaining and delicious! Just a quick dip in the sauce and sear on the rock and melts in your mouth! The music is loud but I loved it, great variety.

The snapper on a bed of crab mash was delicious & the Bronzino was the absolute standout. The broccoli side again was disgusting.

The woman in the hideous leather hat was insanely rude, as was the black hostess. The other 2 were nice and at least mildly apologetic. They also don't take your number or give you a buzzer to let you know when your table is ready, so they sit there and write a ridiculous description of you in the note under your reservation so they can find you in the sea of hundreds of people at the bar. And they keep saying ""we have your name, we'll find you."" Then they go around the crowded dark bar trying to find people who basically all look the same while reading some tiny receipt with a descriptor of what we look like. Ridiculous.The busboys were very rushed and clumsy, and on two different occasions almost spilled all over us.The nice waiter, Adam, tried to apologize for our miserable experience with the hostesses so sent us out something for free, but it of course ended up on the bill and we thankfully found it and pointed it out before paying.Now for the reason I didn't give them 1 star: most of the food was actually really good.

I have been a waitress during brunch rushes so I am sympathetic towards waiters/waitresses under stress, but a restaurant like this with resources should be able to plan for a lunch rush on a holiday during restaurant week. Our waiter seemed to be juggling a third of the tables with the help of two busboys, which just isn't possible for a single person. There was a ton of mistakes between the hostess, the waiter, and the busboys but i'll just mention a few big ones: hostess lost our reservation, never got bread basket had to explicitly ask for it, always had to ask for water refill and didn't get it in the end, the whole dinning experience was 2.5hours for lunch (because of the crazy wait times between requests), got charged twice as much for the bill (they fixed it but still..).

There were a few bus boys kind of bumbling around, one visible waitress and a woman who appeared to be a hostess who was serving tables. She was sweet as pie, but frankly had no idea what she was doing. We got the wrong menus, as did the tables on both our left and right. She had no idea about the Gilt City voucher, charged us for all items, despite that we had paid in advance on Gilt. Service was very slow. We had a 12:45 reservation and lunch arrived after 2:15. We were in the mood for a leisurely lunch, but there was quite a bit of grumbling about he delays coming from our neighbors. With all that being said, the waitress was very sweet and meant well. The Bloody Mary's were amazing. The truffle sashimi app was to-die-for. My fish tacos were unremarkable. The truffle fries, as usual, we're so, so good.

We tried getting a drink at the bar while waiting, but couldn't even get the bartender's attention.  Tried waiting close to the elevator as there was not much standing room, cranky elevator attendant was extremely rude. Fast forward to 1 hour 22 minutes our pager goes off and we are taken one floor up to our table. The music was so loud you couldn't even hold a conversation. The waitress was really nice and attentive, the food was ok.   Can't figure out why they take reservations, and I definitely can't figure out why we didn't walk out instead of waitingNeedless to say I won't be going back. There are way too many great restaurants in NYC to stand by and wait to be seated here.

677,zgtv2EoJTrbpszQyY7lXOQ,Evian D.,3.0 star rating,"Catch is top notch restaurant, in the heart of Meatpacking, a place where you need to make a reservation and bring a deep wallet. While not the most expensive place in NYC either, the bill racks up quickly mostly because as all tapas places, you are paying to savor something really small. And indeed, small are the tapas and expensive here. That said, the flavor is really there, the ambiance is quite beautiful, from the bar area to the actual dining room. Everyone is dressed nicely and presentable. Cause as custom, after dinner and drinks downstairs, you will most likely want to go to the dance club at the roof deck. That said, this brings me to my big disappointment.We were a table of 8 people in our late 20's early 30's... basically, 4 guys and 4 girls, celebrating a birthday. We spend well over 200 per person at this table in less than 90 minutes. We see the bouncer type guy, walking around tables, offering free entry to their club on the rooftop. Mostly, tables with only girls (which I understand is a way to get more $$ spending men to come). He looked at our table and simply walked to the next one. Now, I don't want to sound like a brat or like we deserved to get stamped, but it seems really rude to be giving these away to tables (some of which had pretty older people) and skip our table entirely... We asked the manager if there was a reason, and he complimented the ladies at the table (that was nice) and apologized saying that most likely it was an error and they would send the gentlemen our way. He never came, we continued our meal and spending money at catch and asked one more time before we left and they basically said that (what I had thought already) you have too many guys in your party. I honestly find this to be one of the weirdest things. You know that by having pairs come in, who are willing to spend more money = less drama then single people looking to find someone to spend money on? Again, it's not that you need to let anyone and their mother in, and it has nothing to do with the actual meal (which was great) but it leaves a sour taste in your mouth when on your bday you are denied entrance just because you don't fit their criteria of being single. I would understand especially if the table was making noise and or drunk, but we honestly were not that table (happy and laughing yes, as most tables would be).Anyways, all that said, we had a great night, food was great but $$$$, and if you eat there, you might be lucky to get free access to the club on the roof.

Great place as long as you don't mind opening your wallet a little. Hey, it's in the meat packing district, what do u expect? We had a 6pm reservation which was great bc we beat the dinner rush and got a nice corner booth table. Music wasn't loud at all and lightening slightly dimmed but could see very well.

First off, they have a price brunch menu on their website (pretty good deal)! My girlfriend and I sat down and asked for the price fixe menu, they said they haven't served it in over a year (LIE- i ordered off of it 6 months ago). When I showed the manager on my phone that the menu is still up on their site and that she should honor it, she was extremely rude and completely shut us down until my girlfriend opened her mouth (go women these days!) and shut her down where she offered to give us a complimentary food of choice or beverage.We decided after all the going back and forth that we would stay and dine here. Earlier that afternoon, we had asked for a booth table, right next to our current table and the hostess said they were holding it for 3 people. Fine, whatever, lets move on. As we're waiting for the manager to get back to us regarding the brunch menu, two girls are being seated in the booth table where apparently you can only sit 3 or more people. Apparently the hostess thought we were blind and wouldn't notice. As we contemplated on what to eat, we both looked at each other and decided we should not give Catch our business and walked out and actually had a pretty awesome brunch across the street!To the very friendly manager at Catch- Restaurant 101- take off your price fixe menu off the internet (it's the 21st century, we all use it) and maybe take it down a notch- customer is always right.

It's by no means a mixology bar, but they make some great cocktails (avg price per cocktail is about 20 bucks with 20% tip).5)RESERVE RESERVE RESERVE! We made a 9:30PM appointment, showed up at 9 and the place was completely packed.  They did seat us at 9:30PM sharp though.6)This place is a very carb conscious friendly place if you want it to be. We had sushi rolls that were rolled up in cucumber instead of rice (Grace Roll).  The pretzel rolls with honey mustard butter are complete crack though. These are a must try.  The crispy spicy shrimp appetizer is also great.  7)Our entrees were great, my wife's Branzino served on top of basmati rissoto was superb and my grilled mahi mahi with pineapple mango salsa was very pleasant.  We had a side of bacon brussel sprouts which were also good but were a tad bit too sweet for my liking.8)The desserts here are very fun. We got the hit me brownie.  It's layer upon layer of chocolately goodness and some ice cream in between. They pour some warm chocolate sauce on top and encourage you to ""hit"" the klondike bar like item on the top.  It will drizzle out a white chocolate sauce all around... it was very fun to watch/eat. Not the most amazing chocolate dessert I've ever had, but order it for the novelty factor.9)The service here was absolutely phenomenal.  No complaints about that at all, from the receptionist/bartenders/waiters/busboys.  You will bump in to celebrities here....if you are in to that type of thing.10)Going back to the drinks...

The place was littered with bodacious broads and Wall Street Shmucks. Your typical after work crowd in the Meatpacking District. The girls want to be seen and the guys want to spend money.Myself and two of my friends showed up around 9 o'clock on a Wednesday night after attending a networking event at STK, formerly known as Tenjune (once also am EMM Group venue). As always, no issues for me with the doorman so we were granted access right away and took the elevator up to the 4th floor, the Rooftop.Now for a Wednesday night the place was pretty pumping.  Mixologists in the pit serving drinks, lanky male waiters with hopes of becoming models dishing out plates of truffle sashimi. This is definitely a Meatpacking hot spot. They have a wide selection of fancy cocktails to please any kind of spirit drinker, only problem is....the drinks priced heftier than other MPD places. The female bartender was very pleasant. She was working hard  making sure everyone got their drinks placed in a timely fashion.I order the Dirty Basterd which is basically a Whiskey Moscow Mule. $15 for that drink is slightly higher than usual, and I wouldn't have minded it except in came in the world's smallest copper cup. The second I ordered was the Strawberry Heaven also $15. The drink was supposed to have actual cut up pieces of strawberry, but my drink came without them. No big deal, but if you're out of something, don't you think you'd want to tell the patron that before they order. I thought their outdoor space was quaint, but it was a little small for my liking.

It's always frustrating when foodie parents are greeted with very limited options for kids.  My 9 year old daughter is a figure skater, so she doesn't eat chicken nuggets and french fries, but she has a limited palate.  Some edamame and a small portion of grilled chicken would have made her very happy.  All they could come up with for her was plain pasta, which was OK, but not thrilling.  It should not be necessary to order a $30 salmon entree for a year old.On to the next disappointment - I don't like sweet cocktails and asked the waiter to recommend a cocktail that was not sweet.  He recommended something that turned out to be pretty sweet and I drank it anyway, not thrilled.  The pretzel with the mustard seed butter was great.  I shared the special roll with my son and it was very good.  My son ordered the fried chicken, a $30 entree and it was dry as a bone, very disappointing.  He was shy about telling me he didn't like it because he prides himself on being a foodie, so I tasted it and it was very, very dry.  Dry for me is just about the worst thing food can be.  There is just no excuse for dry fried chicken!My whole Dorade was OK, but it was a very small fish and the preparation was nothing spectacular.  Same for the fish dish my sister-in-law ordered.  The beet salad was pretty good, but also didn't knock my socks off.I've had much better food and much lower prices.  Disappointing.  I'm wondering why they do the 21 and over thing with the roof, even at 6pm - the only thing I can imagine is that they don't want their precious roof real estate used by people that don't drink alcohol.",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

(I'm Greek, so it's like another birthday for me!) and we had dinner reservations for 8:30 originally that I modified for 10PM. I didn't give it 5 stars because we got there at 9:40 and weren't seated until 10:15 because they had a ""backup in reservations"" causing a delay in seating people. Not the hostess' fault persay, but it's okay. We ended up going to the bar and ordered a Poseidon (on the spicier side) and a Neptune (sweeter) drink.After we sat, we were greeted by our server! Very nice fella! Overall, our dining experience was very nice. Our server and busboys were continuously cleaning our table after each course came out. Very attentive to us. Only thing is the tables are a bit tight. It was only 2 of us, so we felt a little squished in the beginning, but by the end of the night, we moved our table slightly over which give us ample room to move around.APPETIZERS: We had the MRC, The General, Hellfire, Catch sushi rolls and the  Crispy shrimp. My favorite roll out of all of them was The General which wasn't on the menu, because they ran out of the Zulu Roll. The Crispy shrimp was EXCELLENT! LOVED that from the hot section. The tuna rolls are pricey, so I'd opt to get 2 rolls next time now that we tried the majority of them as a main dish. For our main courses, we ate the mushroom spaghetti and lobster mac & cheese. Both dishes were on the smaller portion side, but that was fine with us because we had gotten pretty stuffed from all the sushi. Dessert: We tried the Banana Brulee Split with Cherry Frozen Yogurt, Cinnamon Milk Chocolate and Cookies -n- Cream ice cream and the Chocolate Sphere (liquid chocolate truffle, salted caramel ice cream and devils food cake). Also got a scoop of Marshmallow ice cream... i think the dessert may have been the BEST part! OMG so good!Other Drinks: Tried the Asteria, and that's by far going to be my go to drink at Catch. SO YUMMY! It was Grey Goose Cherry Noir, Cointreau, & Maraschino.We were literally so stuffed from all the food, but overall the food was really good and it's a very lively place even at 11PM while people were still eating their dinners and people conversing over drinks!",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

I didn't appreciate the fact that at my most recent visit, while having a late dinner reservation and arriving on time, i was sent to the bar with my complete party in order for them to sell cocktails for 30mins before seating us in a half empty room upstairs - the quietness turned out to be better suited though as it was for a business talk.Again, always recommended if you are looking for a busy nightlife restaurant serving consistent food.

We experience consistent sloppy and grumpy service. From the spilled beer to asking for a refill on drinks several times. The waiter, Jose, didn't even introduce himself and was taking overs without even making eye contact with us. The food was okay, but nothing out of this world. I'm telling you this now since our waiter didn't bother to show up and check up on us after the food was served. The other servers were stopping by trying to pick up our food and they even took the fries away as my mom was reaching for it.Oh! Bonus creepy points for the woman in the bathroom handing out towels. How about you just upgrade the bathroom and get rid of that job? It's just awkward and she didn't have a friendly face either. Felt like a stranger watching me wash my hands.

My friends and I were at the roof for almost 2 hours and decided to go the second floor to get the drinks we like because they weren't serving them at the roof bar. After we got our drinks on the second floor. We tried to go back to the roof and the bouncer told us we had to get a stamp at the 1 floor by  some (rude promoter.) We waited almost 20 minutes for the promoter when he finally showed up he told us we need to get bottle service in order to get up there again! What a shame! I regret spending my money on this place!!! Avoid going to this place. Their policies are insane!",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

736,rv-Tc1NYRY6rB38YFD4pPQ,Michelle C.,1.0 star rating,"Catch was such an embarrassment. This past Saturday, I brought two of my out of town friends to this place you really can't call a restaurant.  I really wanted to show my friends a good dinner in NYC. My friends left unimpressed, and for a NYC restaurant in the meatpacking district- that is NOT good. Completely let down and left embarrassed. Catch is a beautiful spot, very open space with a great ambiance. {Open Kitchen}The music was also great. Food was ok- nothing spectacular at all. Warning- you will wait a long time to even get the food. What ruins this place - is the service. The wait staff is completely overwhelmed and they just look like a complete train wreck and shit show. I was cringing at how bad the service was. Couple of things: {ok maybe more than a couple}1. Sat down at 11pm... Our waiter did not take our food order for at least 45 minutes. 2. We had to ask for bread because it was midnight and we still hadn't had food- some of us were on really low blood sugar and really about to pass out. The waiter gave us a bread basket... of what honestly looked like it was pre-used from someone else's table. No joke, the butter/mustard- whatever it was, looked like it had already been dipped and devoured. 3. Friend ordered a glass of Prosecco; waiter totally forgot and had to be reminded to bring over drink.4. Waiter /Waitresses shifted during our dinner- no clue who was waiting on us. {Not that they ever came over to our table...??) 5. Just watching the waiters/waitress try to wait on our table and other nearby tables was like watching a horror show in progress. To the management at Catch: You have a great place, but your place is only as good as the people representing it. Take a look at the numerous reviews here all saying how badly trained your wait staff. It was even hard for us to leave a 10% tip. We left the restaurant at about 130am.. Due to no one even waiting on us. We had to beg for the bill and to just get the hell out of there.",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

Maybe I just came in with no expectations but my overall experience was wonderful which I really wasn't expecting, ESPECIALLY with the $$$$ price tag.(Even the hostesses were friendly and conveyed a genuine sense of wanting to help... Maybe I'm jaded but how often does that happen in the Meatpacking District unless you're dangling a roll of Benjamins above their heads with a short fishing rod?)I arrived at Catch around 10 pm on a Saturday night to meet up with a girlfriend. Although she took FOREVER to finally arrive, I must say I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the active bar just people watching and sipping on a drink they like to call an Asteria (which comprised of Grey Goose, Cointreau, Maraschino and a blueberry accoutrement). Fabulous drink if I do say so myself. At $16 a pop, I don't know if it's causing more damage to my wallet or to my liver but either way, bring it on!Once my friend arrived we informed our Hostess and she said it would be a few minutes and told us if we wanted we could wait at the bar- she would find us. We more than obliged and ended up doing another round of Asterias. You can see where this is going. Ten to fifteen minutes later we were led through the lively restaurant passing tables of good looking (albeit a little older) groups of people having a good time. I mean this is the Meatpacking District, right? The cross section will infinitely be better than that found in other parts of New York. I swear I'm not hating...  *fingers crossed*After perusing the menu, we decided on the following food items:-Hellfire Roll ($14) Spicy tuna two-ways, pear, balsamic: On the small side but delicious flavor! Huge chunks of grade A quality tuna that really just really stood out in the roll. I hate pears so I was kind of weary of it being mentioned on the menu. I am so glad the sweet taste of the pear did not overwhelm the roll! -MRC Roll ($17) Seared tuna, tempura shrimp, avocado, ponzu butter: Also on the small side but this was another delicious roll as well. The shrimp was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside and all of the flavors blended perfectly together in one harmonious balance.-Salmon Sushi ($4): Not the best salmon I have ever had in my life but I would definitely list it in my top ten. I'm pretty harsh when it comes to my salmon ratings so top ten is pretty good. Nice, fatty cut with the coveted butteriness that you only get with top quality, fresh salmon.-Kanpachi Sushi ($6): I love kanpachi so much so when I see it on any sushi menu, I must have it! This cut was also very delicious with a clean yet buttery finish.-Crispy Shrimp ($18) Spicy mayo: Obviously crispy chunks of shrimp deep fried in I don't care what and served with a side of creamy spicy mayo in which to smother I mean *dip* into. This was probably the most generous portion of all our plates and thank goodness! I felt like my hand kept impulsively stabbing the plate every two seconds so I could devour one of these tasty morsels until every last speck was gone.-Baked clams Oreganata ($16) Breadcrumbs, garlic, white wine: A last second add on but so glad that we did! Being from an Italian family, baked clams oreganata are like a staple at all of our fancy East Coast meals. I adore these little crustaceans covered in breadcrumbs and garlic. Actually I adore anything covered in breadcrumbs and garlic! Don't believe me? Just try me. Catch's rendition of one of my favorite Italian dishes was completely spot on (which shocked me to say the least). This dish will definitely become one of my necessary requirements when I return.I am going to come back very soon (i.e. this weekend before another bout of late night par-tays, woooo!) and try many more of the tasty dishes they have to offer despite the big bucks.

I ended my meal with the s'mores pizza which was a great choice and i highly recommend it.Overall I had a great experience at Catch but the reason I wasn't able to give it 5 stars  was because I felt like the portions were kind of small for the price they charge.

We also split several rolls, but, while they were fairly interesting combinations of flavors, none of them quite worked out wel for me. The MRC roll was probably the best, but I found the pear in the hellfire roll to be a bit odd, and the Catch roll, in spite of sounding like it would be good with all of its ingredients, just didn't quite work that well for me.

My expectations were high, and I love going out in the Meatpacking District. The experience I had at Catch Rooftop was probably the worst experience I've had at a club in my life. I would never go back after the rudeness and unprofessionalism exhibited there. Read on for the story of what they did that was illegal financially and emotionally abusive to their customers: After a few hours of dancing, one of my girlfriends needed to use the restroom, and was upset to find that after a girl accidentally spilled her water on the floor, the  bathroom attendant was publicly shaming her for ""peeing on the floor."" It was horrible. The poor girl was mortified, and my friend was sticking up for her, showing that it was only water she spilled, scooping it in tissue and smelling it and asking the bathroom attendant to smell so she realized that it wasn't true so she'd leave the girl alone. The attendant got a bouncer involved, and both the attendant and bounder were screaming out of control to the innocent girl and my friend who was defending her. It was ridiculous. Fast forward to a 1/2 hour later, the same bouncer still was mad at my friend and wanted to come up with an excuse to make her leave the club, so he and 3 others surrounded and scared my friends while dancing with 2 boys, and randomly picked out one of the boys saying he ""pushed him"" and was getting thrown out. That boy wasn't anywhere near the bouncer; it was merely an excuse to execute revenge of sorts on my friend for getting involved with the bathroom shaming situation and making the  staff look bad for calling them out on being mean.That night I forgot my business debit card at the register, and called at 6am the next morning, as well as at 5pm to ask when I could come by to cash out and pick it up. No one ever answered or called me back, so I showed up at the club. At the rooftop they blew me off and told me to go downstairs to the hostess at the restaurant, since it was likely in the safe. The hostess said the safe was missing, then dismissed us completely, not even looking at us when we spoke or asked questions/walking around us like we didn't exist, and there weren't even customers as an excuse for this behavior. It was blatant ignoring.I pushed for the location of the lost and found. She didn't have an address for their own corporate headquarters apparently, but rather told us to go to 17th and 9th and look for a grey door. It was a wild goose chase to a door that lead nowhere. We went, we called over and over asking for a manager, until we were finally told where the real office was (not at 17th and 9th Ave), went there, looked through all the cards and my card was not there. They said cards hadn't come in from the restaurant from the night before. So we went back to the club; everyone was rude and blew us off, and so we found a manager, Chris, who seemed like a nice person but didn't help at all. He said he would look in the safe, that it wasn't in the safe, that he called and it was at headquarters (which it wasn't because we were there 10 minutes before--so  that was a lie), then he kept ""looking"" but really we saw him in random rooms not looking around/doing other things, which my friend who was with me called him out on. He then said there was another safe only the CFO could open on Monday, and gave me his mobile. Monday comes around and my card has been charged by them, when I never even signed anything! That is completely illegal. It also shows they have the card, since I never checked out. When I expressed I was upset for them illegally charging my card, which they had, but didn't return, Chris went on radio silence.

I really wanted to try the Catch Roll as well, it looked so good...before they torched it. :( For desserts, the Hit Me Chocolate cake was soooo good. The Mango sorbet was pretty decent, and the Going Bananas was also good, it's just the Hit Me Chocolate Cake really hit the spot!! I forgot to mention for the entree my party had ordered an entire red snapper (it was amazingly huge and scary looking for someone who hates cooked fish) and I was told to try a bit, and i literally tried a tiny bit and like I thought it didn't taste that good. I'm not too fond of the texture of cooked fish by the sauce the snapper came with was soooo good I finished my remaining piece of the red snapper with a pool of sauce. :DFor drinks, I tried the Persephone and it was so good, and our table had about 6 bottles of Malbec..which I'm sure our bill was pretty insane but seeing as it was a company dinner I didn't have to pay--not sure if I would come here even with everything tasting so heavenly as it's way out of my budget. The portions are rather small!Service was amazing, everyone was really nice and friendly considering we were the last guests to leave. :) Overall, I had an amazing experience.",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

NOT AT ALL READ THIS:1) Elevator going up to the restaurant had a chef in it that was hunched over and appeared sleeping against the elevator buttons.2) Elevator stopped twice on service floors on the way to the roof to eat, we were served with amazing views of garbage and employees messing around at those two stops.3) Finding a server to take our order too forever.4) The busser came out with our water glasses, holding them with his bare hands by the rims of the glass (you know, the part you drink out of)5) When we ordered regular drinks, they came and took back all of the full water glasses. No more water. Also, they took back the soy sauces in the middle of the meal - no more soy sauce.6) They brought out entrees for two of the three people only. The third entree was delivered 25 minutes later after the first two people were done with theirs. The table next to us (2 people) only had one entree delivered, the 2nd entree never came.7) We began complaining, and as a sorry - they sent us VODKA shots. Vodka shots as a service recovery on a TUESDAY at 1pm. We didnt know what was in the shots, and the server just said it was a surprise. Horrible.8) Desserts never came, we'd been there over 90 mins and it was time to go so we asked for the check (and said to rush the desserts if possible - one last try)9) Check came (with the desserts we never got on it) - we just wanted to get out of that place so we gave our CC's. Server no where to be found to run our CC's so we gave it to a bus girl - she walked around looking for the server, then handed us back the checks saying ""i cant find him, these CC's are safer with you"".10) There were simultaneously two tables complaining and not getting serviced, and manager just sat on her laptop and cell phone - not acknowledging anyone.The portions were very small, but thats restaurant week - i get it.

The food was amazing, everything was perfectly cooked, I loved everything I ordered and so did my friends. I ordered many plates and the waitress served them 2 at a time, which I liked.

I've been there many times- so not my first time, but indeed my last.Food was fine, service was good. Got our check, and asked the poor server to split it several ways. Some were couples, and paid for 2 people on one card, and some were singles and paid for 1 person. Total was $61 per person, and obviously $122 per couple. She didn't seem a bit annoyed, and did just that. For her trouble, we left her a 30& cash tip. I signed my $61 receipt and skipped the tip part, as it was a cash tip. A few days later, I look at my credit card transactions, and instead of $61, I have a charge for $126.14. Odd amount. First of all, even if they were to make a mistake and charge me as a couple, it would have been $122, not this random amount. Second of all, I signed (and have a customer copy) for $61!Before jumping to conclusions that this is some sort of shady practice, I called Catch, explained the situation, and was told that a manager would return my call- THREE TIMES! I also wrote them an email. It has been a week and no one got back to me. So I actually did them a favor of calling them first, to give them the chance to explain this- and they don't have the simple common courtesy to return my call. Sad, sad business practice. Sorry Catch, not only are you guys shady, and clearly added a random amount to my signed receipt, but you don't have the elementary business knowledge to realize that it is customers like myself who make up your client base.

Hm.** Spider Roll: best roll of the night, soft shell crab with a wonderful sweet chili garlic sauce.* Grace Roll: reminded me of a basic rainbow roll, nothing special here** Salmon Belly Carpaccio: Sweet and savory, with perfect texture, nicely done* Romaine Salad - they gave us this by accident, as we didn't order it; it was a... caesar salad* Crunchy Rice Cakes - tuna tartare with wasabi tobiko over fried rice cakes. So-so... spicy.** Crispy Shrimp with spicy mayo - a tasty popcorn-shrimp like dish, reminding me of the honey-walnut shrimp they serve in Chinese restaurants. Good for a few pieces, but gets heavy after more.* Mahi Mahi Wonton Taco includes gauc, tomatillo, and lime, and wasn't anything special; you can get similarly great tacos across the way without the pretense** Scallop Gnocchi was a tasty treat - scallops were done well, and the gnocchi was soft and buttery** Macaroni and Lobster Cream didn't have much in the way of cheese, but was a tasty treat and rich with lobster flavor* Sauteed Snapper with lobster mash, truff, lemon brown-butter; they can filet this for you (it's a whole fried fish); alone, without the sauce (served on the side), nothing special; with the sauce, still not much flavor. Too much spicy earlier in the meal?

And if you're paying a premium for some Top Chef Hung-cuisine, you're going to want it to taste a little better than a Ruby Tuesdays, right ?We tried a number of items on the menu: Specialty rolls, Tuna poke, grilled octopus, lobster mac & cheese, crunchy rice cakes, mahi mahi tacos, broccolini, crispy chicken... Including the sushi, everything was pushed out of the kitchen so fast there's no doubt in my mind that the majority are pre-assembled, frozen dishes that they heat up right prior to. Plus, much to my dismay, the oysters from the raw bar (that Catch simply needed to purchase, clean, and keep fresh...) were nearly inedible. Maybe it was just an off-night, but if we weren't with a work group I would have sent that gag-inducing goo back. Oh and I actually forgot that we got dessert as well- the banana thing, and the s'mores pizza. My sentiments remain unshaken.If you're there for just a scene and some cocktails, you'll do fine, although the only cocktail on the menu worth trying is the jalapeño-infused Kali. All others I tasted- the Iris, Aphrodite, DBB, Neptune- are either watery or just way too sweet. Not for me.",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

The menu looked super interesting and it was always on my bucket list of go to restaurants.We finally decided to organize a birthday dinner there however I feel like it was the worst decision.Food : the food was honestly good. I will give it to the chef and only the chef who created the scallops and cauliflower with pistachio . The fried shrimp for appetizer was excellent as well. So I will give them a 3 1/2 for their food ONLY.Drinks : watered down.Service : SUCKED. They don't know the whole concept of customer service. We were a party four and the  waiter we got told us "" oh for a party of four you need to four appetizers as portions are small"". Nonsense!!!! We ordered three appetizers and main course and were pretty full. So your fine ordering two appetizers with a main course for a part of four based on how hungry you are.Second we came there for a birthday party and we brought a cake to cut. Most places charge a corkage fee or just cut the cake and serve it. Oh week catch doesn't do that. We spoke to the hostess first and she was dam right rude or about and she made sound like we he to know about it. How the hell were we supposed to know about it? Is it in your website? NO! Then we again requested the waiter and he said no but he would speak to the manager. The manager came to us and told us the same however was dam right rude and snotty and was like ""sorry we don't do that we have pastry chef who is awesome""!!!!! That completely ruined our mood for the evening. Then hey give us four shots on the house to make up for he crappy service. We were like fine.However we then realized that they do a very sneaky thing. Usually on the entire bill most restaurants  put a suggested amount however here they put a suggested gratuity on the split up bill. So say your splitting up the bill they put the gratuity on that amount. Hence we ended up giving them a gratuity if 40% vs 20% which was completely not worth it AT ALLLLL. obviously we were so dam pissed that we realized much later. But people beware this could happen to you as well.All in all we were very unhappy with our experience at catch!!!!!!

In keeping with the whole trendy Meatpacking District vibe, the high prices are accompanied by a sleek second floor dining room filled with Asian fusion food plus a pretty women's room (I didn't visit the men's room). The third floor lounge that I didn't get to see. Since I rarely dine at this stratospheric price point (nice to have friends who can pick up the tab!), I really enjoyed chowing on the $72 fried whole red snapper, $14 white mussel appetizer, $22 dungeness crab spaghetti appetizer, $18 crispy shrimp appetizer and $14 lobster mashed potatoes. In all fairness, the portions were plenty generous and the waitress made a point of saying that the snapper would be easily shared by two people.We also had the cute $15 crunchy rice cakes, which is basically a tuna tartare mounded on top of toasty rectangles of packed-together sushi rice. I wasn't crazy about the $9 side dish of string beans and napa cabbage -- seemed like a clump of veggies in a sweet brown sauce -- but my dinner buddies liked it.In addition to all this,  we also enjoyed our free bread basket of three little warm pretzels with mustard-infused butter. Mixed drinks are good too the mojito was refreshingly minty and the Dirty Bastard had a sweet, ginger beer zing to it.Try to leave room for dessert because the $12 strawberry shortcake is quite luscious (although I would have preferred that the shortcake was less cake and more shortbread in texture).

(not a bad thing I guess if you like avocados!).  I think it could have used a touch of salt... more crunch and less creaminess... would have been awesome.  what the girls & i enjoyed the most was probably the warm basket of pretzel rolls that came out with dijon mustard....seriously so good.  it was quite memorable... lastly, the sauteed snapper was also rockin'.  the fish was beautifully prepared and the lobster mash was an interesting side.the menu is split up by hot & cold....not sure if i would come back for sushi/sashimi, as there are just far more other interesting items to order than sushi.  they also house one of my beloved wines (Justin cabernet)... the bonus points keep adding up.  can't wait to go back and try a varietal of other things to eat.. delish!!",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

863,V8U6Eew0x3iE71SsiFZFcQ,Saige M.,2.0 star rating,"When the friendliest person you encounter is the doorman, there is an issue. Myself and three friends made dinner reservations for 7 PM on a Sunday. We wanted to try and eat dinner on the rooftop area but were told they don't accept reservations for that area, which isn't an issue and is kind of to be expected. We just figured we would try and get there a little earlier than our reservation and see if there was space or if the wait would be short. Once to the restaurant we head up to the roof floor and walk up to the hostess to inquire about the roof seating. She was rather short with us and merely replied, ""Yes there is a wait."" ""No, I don't know how long it will be."" ""Yes, there are people in front of you."" She gave no indication about how many people were in front of us, an even bare estimate for how long it would be, and didn't even welcome us to sit at the bar and wait. It honestly started the night off feeling unwelcomed and weirdly as if they were purposefully being a little snobby. Maybe that was the ambience they were going for?Anyways, we then continued back down to the dinner floor for our reservation and were seated immediately. I will say even being seated inside is a treat because of the beautiful, big open windows and lovely atmosphere and decoration. There was music playing softly in the background, at a great level to enjoy without feeling as if we had to talk loudly over it. This enjoyment was cut short when we were introduced to one of our waitresses (we had two that kept on switching out in irregular periods). She introduced herself to us all the while giving off a stressed out, hectic, and honestly uncomfortable for us vibe. When pouring our tap water, she kept on missing the glasses and splashed literally every single one of us and our table and instead of acknowledging this and offering a new napkin, she acted as if it never happened and left us having to use our table linens to attempt and wipe it up. We then attempted to tackle the maze that is the menu, which one would think would be rather simple to deduce what is an appetizer or not and yet you would be surprised how misleading the titles of some of the dishes are. The only section clearly marked was a small one on the last page labeled 'Entrees'. After looking at each other slightly overwhelmed with the pages upon pages of various dishes, our waitress finally came by and unhelpfully fast went through the various sections (again, how hard is it to just have it already labeled or described on the menu itself?). Once she described everything and also provided some insight on the sizes of dishes, we decide to each choose an 'appetizer' style dish (which ranged from $11 to $34) and then also choose an entree. The food was amazing. Simply put, every single dish was fantastic (except the lobster mac & cheese which resembled Kraft Mac&Cheese with lumps of overcooked lobster). I'm not a big seafood person and yet found myself absolutely loving the appetizers. The only downside to this part of the meal was that a busboy kept on trying to clear our plates when we weren't yet finished. The food finally arrived and was also just fantastic except for one thing. Our waitress, jetting around, leaving us for large amounts of time, and splashing water, forgot to mention that the special (which was not on the menu) had pine nuts in it. Not even just in the sauce, but literally covering and filling everything on the Sea Bass it was in. My friend, being allergic to pine nuts, immediately called over the other waitress for our table and indicated we had not been informed there were pine nuts in the special and he was allergic. Rather surprisingly, she apologized and then just stood there awkwardly for no joke at least 5 minutes. She offered no suggestions for how this could be fixed and finally asked 'did you want me to see if they can make it without pine nuts?' OBVIOUSLY we would like it without pine nuts, or in failing that, providing some sort of solution like choosing another dish. Then instead of leaving the dish (which was a shared platter between two of my friends, one being the allergic one), for our other friend who was not allergic, she completely cleared the table and then proceeded to take almost 35-40 minutes to replace the dish. This left myself and my other friend awkwardly eating our food while the other two sat there waiting for the new dish. As I said, the food was absolutely amazing and I will give them that. But the waitstaff was not only unhelpful and honestly slightly rude, it was bizarre how they were acting as if it were a purposeful decision to be both of those things. It's incredibly disappointing that a restaurant with such fantastic cooks are then paired with such horrible waitstaff.",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

I had a very negative experience here where I was held back from re-joining my group upstairs because I didn't have a stamp on my hand. I went downstairs to use the restroom and when I attempted to get on the elevator to read join my group I was refused access to the elevator. Despite my attempts to say that I was alone downstairs and my entire group is upstairs, the man who was in charge of guarding The elevator had no sympathy for me and refused to let me on. When I questioned why I was told that I did not have a stamp on my hand. I was told to go downstairs and ask for a stamp. After waiting for another elevator and making my way down stairs (fire hazard???) I was again refused a stamp. I continued to remain separated from my group who was unaware that I was downstairs because I was not getting cell phone service. I began to become more and more upset, not yelling or arguing or attempting to push past the guard, just expressing how I needed to get upstairs. Again the man in charge of the elevator had no sympathy for me and did not offer me any alternatives. There were several other people attempting to re-join their groups upstairs and they refused as well. Some girls even started to cry and did not know what else to do, again no sympathy from the staff. The atmosphere of this place was uncomfortable barely any room to move, as well as few alternatives for getting around other than crammed elevators.

Love the Meatpacking district for the Standard, Bagatelle, STK, Spice Market etc. and the designer shops and old pubs etc. Catch has a cool multi-level space with a funky wrap around patio overlooking the Gansevoorte and the square. Decent view. Very New York. My last visit will be just that - my last time. I'm done with this place. While the ""romaine salad"" which was actually a classic Caesar salad, might have been the best one I have ever had and the sushi was pretty clean and fresh tasting, I have to just say that the wait staff were simply atrocious. We sat there unattended for at least 15 minutes. When someone would finally approach us, it was rushed, with no sense of connection or caring and each time it was a different server. So clearly no server was actually assigned to our table. It's quite possible we came during that unfortunate time when day shift servers who worked ""long lunch"" are about to cash out and they pass over certain tables to the evening staff who are just starting. I know the drill, but a good server makes that transition completely seamless for the guest. For me, it was painfully obvious. Once again, we got the worst possible table in the entire place (thanks, pretty hostess). I need to start blatantly rejecting the first table hostesses try to seat me at from now on. They obviously work from crappiest tables first then work their way to the more desirable ones. Servers were verging on rude by the end and after sitting for yet another 20 minutes with no interaction, I asked for our bills and added that we had a meeting to get to in 5 minutes. Then we waited over 10 minutes for him to bring us the bill but not separate checks as we requested. So he then takes another 10 minutes to bring back 2 checks. Nice.

I was impressed by the cool, upscale atmosphere,  the delicious food and unique cocktails every time I dined in your establishment.  Catch became a favorite from my first experience. Unfortunately, the past two times I've had dinner here (most recently Saturday night, 1/24),  the service has been so awful I doubt that I will return.. I was celebrating my birthday with 4 other women who either have worked or currently work in the service/hospitality industry. I understand, especially at a restaurant like Catch, that the job of server  can get stressful and sometimes people have off days. Servers should know that in order to do the best job possible you need to be able to leave the outside stressors of life at the door, especially at a restaurant the caliber of Catch. Our server, Greg, seemed a little less than ready to please as soon as we sat down and wanted to order some of our favorite Catch cocktails. Our eagerness to start our birthday dinner party seemed to inconvenience him. We ordered 3 apps and entrees. When one of my friends ordered the octopus, which was listed as a appetizer in the menu, Greg rudely told her to take a look at the entrees. My sister and I split the strip steak and the food came without an extra plate and  we waited 15 minutes for another plate, because no one came to check how everything was. When the bill came, $650 with gratuity and tax, everyone put their cards down and we wrote how much for each card,. My sister handed Greg the bill and told him just split it equally 4 ways, except one person was going to use 2 cards for their portion. He immediately became annoyed and handed back the bill and said he needed all the math to be done.

Our server was attentive and offered lots of good suggestions from the menu. The not so good:Dinner was very much a waiting game.  We weren't seated until almost an hour after our reservation.  It took forever to get a drink - and even longer to pay our bar tab.  We were finally seated at 9:45 - at which point our waiter informed us the kitchen was running behind.  To make up for the wait our server sent us out a round of shots- which was appreciated. The bad:Due to all the delays we were still finishing our meal at 11pm (despite an 8:30 reservation).  At 11:00 pm the venue turns into a nightspot, and the giant speaker I previously hadn't noticed started blaring really loud music. This was understandable as this was a regularly planned event- but some warning or an offer to move us somewhere else would have been nice.  For the next 20 minutes we had bar backs and the manager (?) shouting at each other while they loudly rearranged furniture around us.   We couldn't get out of there fast enough. On top of this a member of our party thought she had left her phone on the terrace earlier in the evening - the Manager loudly scolded her when she attempted to retrieve the phone stating the outside was closed.  This could have been handled in a more friendly manner.

Extremely rude hostess, who probably think that because their vibe is trendy they own the world and can talk down to you. Please owners consider placing cameras and mics to see and hear how rude these hostesses are.Our experience: We came here a couple weeks ago on a Saturday evening as a party of 4 with a previously made reservation. They had us wait for about 1 hour and 30 minutes for a table. We asked the status a couple times only to be treated rudely. Until we saw some hope from one of the hostess (the only one not rude)  who said we will be next. When it was time to get a table, she escorted us to the table only to find out that another hostess had given the table to others 30 seconds before. She apologized and we were back to the waiting line promised to be taken care of within minutes. What a nightmare! She forgot about us all together and tables were being given to others. We were in disbelief by now. And no apologies or action to sit us down. It was so insulting that they would not have a better method to track their patrons waiting for a table for that long, being such as fancy place. And we were not the only ones that experienced this. We got so tired of being treated without any consideration to our time, and walked away. Others followed shortly. TO THE OWNERS: PLEASE INVEST SOME OF YOUR PROFITS IN A BETTER MECHANISM TO HANDLE PEOPLE WAITING FOR TABLES. YOU HAVE NO METHOD SIMPLY WRITING THE NAME AND GOING TO LOOK FOR THE CUSTOMERS WHEN THE BAR IS PACKED, AND YOU HAVE DING DONGS AS HOSTESSES, SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK. STOP BEING SO CHEAP AND INVEST IN A PHONE SYSTEM OR BEEPER SYSTEM. WHAT YOU DO IS NOT COOL AT ALL, CERTAINLY NOT TRENDY! To the hostesses: please go learn some manners and get some education. Being rude to customers is not acceptable and you all are not all that hot, even if you were, no excuse to be rude and talk down to people. To new customers, if you see yourself in this situation, do not wait for more than 20 minutes.

As it was our last night in NYC we were incredibly excited to have some delicious food and enjoy the atmosphere. Our table for a party of seven was pre booked and we arrived in good time. However we were told our table wasn't ready so to go for a drink. Fine, no problem. We grabbed a drink and sat down at a couple of tables in the bar and waited. After about twenty minutes we asked the hostess in the bar when our table would be ready. She said she didn't have anything to do with the restaurant so best to ask the other hostesses. Okay, sure. Except these hostesses were beyond rude and incredibly self involved. The type of hostess that when you come up to the desk refuses to look you in the eye or greet you for seemingly no reason, until she is ready- the ""screw you paying customer"" attitude. There were two, a blonde and brunette. The blonde was a shade worse, seeing as we asked again as she walked past and this question was met with utter disgust and ""I don't know"". Two hours after our booking was made we were finally shown to our table- crammed in with other parties. The lady behind myself was literally brushing shoulders with me. It was grossly over crowded and they'd packed as many people in as possible. My fiancé, realising he had left his phone at the bar area went to the hostess who did have it and said ""I'm glad you came over to collect it"" because they clearly would not have been bothered to walk the 10 feet to give it back to us. The food was okay, definitely not on the same level as other places and completely not worth the shockingly bad experience with customer service (which I don't agree with in any case!). I've genuinely never felt as unwelcome as a paying customer than in that place.

The filet I understand because compared to an $85 ribeye or the $78 rack of lamb. A $44 Filet mignon wins out every time. So I order their ceviche roll and surf and turf. Ceviche roll was good. The surf and turf was luke warm, get this... it comes on a hibachi that was hot but the food was luke warm. Now I have to cook my food?  It was 4 mini skewers that had 1/2oz of lobster claw and 1oz (2 cubes) of waygu beef. When the server finally shows up asked my friend how he liked his surf and turf. My friend simply said he was expecting more skewers for $55. The server actually told my friend that the beef came from a special cow that was massaged and killed in the correct manner and even states that the restaurant isnt even making money on the dish.

They ended up sitting us in a huge table next to the stair, a really bad table.On top of that, they ""took"" our orders, but then forgot about them so we had to re order after 25 minutes.The cherry on the top is that the waiter lied to us twice saying that the tip was not included in the bill and that the concept was a certain tax. Note that this was 20÷... actually a lot of money that we are already about to pay. When we asked the waiter for a second time, he insisted that the tip was not included. He was not a new guy.

Their crispy shrimp is very good as well. Chef John and Chef Andrew went above and beyond with their level of talent. Putting the food aside the ambiance and the overall feel of this place rocks. If your looking for a tasty drink consider an Athena and my personal favorite a Moscow mule. Very good.

962,POCjgEylGYd3W4dSS-4dTg,Richard S.,2.0 star rating,So average. The food was okay but certainly nothing memorable that would warrant the cost. $17 for a normal sized sushi roll is insane (there are exceptions but this was not one of them).  You are clearly paying for the pretentious environment rather than the culinary delight you would expect at this price point. Service was eh. I think professional wait staff is so key in these types of restaurants and you could tell this staff was not well oiled. The decor was nice and kept you reminded that you were there for seafood yet in the meat packing district. The music was way too loud to talk but I think those that enjoy this scene feel right at home.

Crispy shrimp, sea bass wraps and scallop gnocchi were incredible! Yum! The hamachi was very good but a bit over priced for the size...but maybe that's typical in NYC. The oysters were very good as well! We had very attentive service...which, I must say, was really nice because we decided to do all appetizers and no entree so it was a bit of a chore to keep us on track with our ordering and serving! :-) Lobster rolls were yummy and fun...so cute!

The restaurant came highly recommended so I thought it would be a great place to take an out-of-town visitor and NYC virgin. We arrived for our reservation and were shown to the bar area. And here we stood for well over an hour; we did not get seated until 11pm. We were almost past hunger and had bought several drinks at the bar (perhaps the point?). Once seated our server appeared with a face like a wet weekend! He was miserable, unhelpful, and could not be found for most of our dining experience. We resorted to asking another waiter for more drinks. The food, I must say, was very good, so kudos to the chefs. But it was let down by front of house service.

This could totally be the venue for your next big party.Food:   Main-dishes are worth the wait; appetizers alone can serve as your main dish if your wallet is losing its weight :D ; skip the side dishes if you want to save money; desserts: let's just call them for what they give you: mouth-gasm! The Long Review:Catch is a fun, hip, cool place to hang out to enjoy the bustling night life of the city that never sleeps. This is a place where the world meets New York and New York tells the world 'whatever dude! Just enjoy the moment!"" Located at the heart of the meat-packing district, it is an oasis that invites you for a sultry evening of delicious food that are decadently rich in taste. At the door, you will meet professional security personnel who are there for crowd control as everybody and their grandmother wants to go there. Reservation: Make sure to call or book on the web with your reservation as early as possible. Once you book, make sure you and your party show up at least 40 minutes ahead - if you are going there for dinner, that is.  I had an a reunion dinner with my athlete friends on a Wednesday night and made a reservation for 8:15pm. The place was already packed and closed to new reservations for the night. Our table was ready at 9:30pm. Yep, that's over an hour wait time.""BAD CATCH"" - It took them over an hour to sit us down, even with reservation.""MORE BAD CATCH"" - they didn't offer free drinks or even water while we waited.The Staff: (Security, Host/Reception, Waiter/Waitress)Security: The security details are professional and courteous. You feel that they are there to make your experience safe without being rude.Host/Reception: These girls try their best. If they don't know how long before your table will be ready, they will give you a projected estimate but will also let you know that they don't really know what that means in real time; you can decide if you want to stay there or go somewhere else and not waste your time. The Waiter/Waitress:The wait staff know know their food; at least the waiter on our table did. Ask anything and don't be shy. A special request to modify the dish because you have an issue? They will ask the kitchen if you can be accommodated.Food:  (Divided below by overall categories)Appetizers: appetizers are deliciously fresh in taste. We shared two appetizers and they both by their own rights satisfied us well; if you are on the budget, then skip the main dish and go for their delicious hot appetizers that really fill up your belly without emptying your wallet. Main Course: Catch is totally a catch when it comes to their main dishes. From the moderately priced Brenzino at around $28-$32  to the luxury class whole fish for over $90+, the dishes are as delicious in taste as they are beautiful in their presentation. You can do their ""chef's recommended tradition"" but as a New Yorker, I prefer to have my own thing as at the end of the day, I am paying for my dish, not the chef. You will enjoy the food because the waiters take their job seriously when it comes to make sure your food is prepped the way you want it. Side-Dishes: The side dishes are alright in taste. The prices are not alright, however. In terms of taste ratio, you will be paying at least 3 times the price on side dishes and be disappointed in 6 times the taste. Take their french-fries for example. Now French-fries or ""freedom fries"" if you are from...well, you know where you are from... is an iconic American side dish and every upscale restaurant in NYC competes heavily to win you over with their fries. Let me make it simple: if McDonald sets the lowest standard of ""acceptable"" taste for french-fries, and yes it does, then Catch could not even catch-up with McDonald. My advice: save the money and spend it on dessert.Dessert: Sultry, sexy, and savoring in taste, Catch totally caught-on with their desserts. Go there just for the desserts! The chocolate melts in your mouth and gives you a mouth-gasm that makes you forget the long wait you had to endure. The strawberry short-cake is awesome with fresh sweet strawberries and the perfect crusty biscuit on top. Catch totally gets full score on evoking the ""I am feeling naughty after the dessert"" which is what you want with your fun dates after a great dinner anyway! Overall: Catch is the place to go to for a great catch when it comes to seafood.",Catch,3.0 star rating,$$$,"Asian, Fusion,, Sushi, Bars,, Seafood"

I'm not exactly sure why, I'm a decent looking girl and was by myself but they definitely were  discriminating me. I've heard about clubs not letting people up, I've just never experienced it myself. I'm just disappointed in this place.
