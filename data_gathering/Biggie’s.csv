I came here during the week for lunch and sat at one of the many high-top tables in the center of the restaurant. There are plenty of booths along the side of the restaurant as well. It's pretty spacious inside so I can imagine this place getting packed and a bit crazy during football/basketball seasons or on the weekends.The menu is huge so unless you know exactly what you want, you'll probably be studying the menu for a bit before deciding on what you're ordering. I ordered half a dozen oysters on the half shell (they also offer clams) and they were surprisingly very fresh. I also had the taco pizza and buffalo wings from the happy hour menu. Not only do they have a big regular menu, but the happy hour menu is just as impressive.I always get the house Cabernet here for just $5. I've sat at the bar before as well and the bartenders are all very young, attractive females who are attentive and sweet. They're very quick with taking multiple drink orders while engaging with bar the bar guests. When there's a sports game on, the bar is usually crowded with people standing around because of the limited bar stools (it's a small bar).Great place to come with a crowd, a few friends, or even your family!",Biggie’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, Seafood"

Stopped in on a Sunday for some football and sangria. Ordered the pitcher of coconut and pineapple sangria (it was nice) for two to share. Not terrible. Atmosphere - well its a bar, so it was a good time overall.Clam pizza - it was warm? Not garlicky and I feel like the clams were frozen. Whereas the Carlstadt location had fresh clams and just amazing piping hot pizzas come out this was a very very sad display.Loaded tots - again, this was warm. It was good, but I wish the cheese was a little bit more oozie and the tots still warm. This was definitely another disappointment. Although I can understand that this Hoboken location may not be well suited for food and more for a bar scene, I think they should cut down the menu then and just serve food that they can actually manage.  The bar was not terribly packed where I would expect cold food. Service was pretty good though - the bartender was very quick with our drinks and visited us frequently.The food was a travesty.",Biggie’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, Seafood"

Apparently, there are two locations in Hoboken.I came to Biggie's on Saturday afternoon. It was actually pretty dead inside, likely because we came at an odd hour. We were able to be seated immediately which was a plus.I ordered a Bloody Mary which I really enjoyed. My boyfriend originally ordered a beer that they no longer had. The waitress gave a couple suggestions and even offered to let him try a sample of a pumpkin beer he was debating on. What a nice gesture!For lunch, I ordered a bowl of the turkey chili which consisted of ground turkey, kidney beans, tomatoes, peppers and onions seasoned with chili spices. The chili was topped with cheddar cheese. It was so good. The melted cheese was the perfect addition to the chili. It also came with a small packet of oyster crackers. I wish it came with a couple more packets, though. I should also note that I was originally nervous it wouldn't be enough food for me. However, it was loaded with meat... safe to say I was stuffed by the end of my meal. My boyfriend ordered the Po Boy sandwich with waffle fries.

9,EJin1z1twW5SQ3-EbBSLsQ,Wendy G.,4.0 star rating,"Trying to find a place to eat at 11PM in Hoboken on a Saturday night is almost close to impossible. So when I stopped in 5 mins before the kitchen closed, I was so grateful they were still going to feed me!Atmosphere: Its honestly kind of hard to tell how this place looks during the day, because by the time we came in, they pushed all the chairs towards the back and had us covered by like a curtain to turn the dining area into a dance floor. Service: Our waitress was named Alicia and she was super sweet, and really attentive. I had a 50% off calamari (Check in for 50% off wings or calamari), and she forgot to put it on the bill, and she gave us no issues after we mentioned it. We were her last customers, and she stayed past her time so we can eat, forever grateful to that girl for feeding the hungry. Food: Garlic cheese steak w/ mozz and waffle fries and an order of calamari.  So the cheese steak was a little bland, and the piece of steak was tough, hard to bite pieces off, so my sandwich sadly broke apart. The calamari was so massive, such a big plate, can definitely feed two. The garlic ranch sauce is def the perfect go to with the calamari, and the marinara sauce was a little spicy and had a kick to it, but a little funny after taste. Food was ok this time, but I can't complain, the kitchen was closing, but there menu has a ton of options though. So I will be back during the day time so try something else.

We were coming up with ideas for where we could grab good dinner and saw biggie's- I had it bookmarked. Havanas Cuban food next door sounded tempting but I hadn't had a chance to look through Yelp reviews for it beforehand. We walked in and the place only had about 10 tables filled. The hostess tried to seat us next to 2 huge and loud groups- I said absoeffinlutely not. Why? There were plenty of seats. Then she took us to the back... NO. At this point, I just said, ""let me take the high top."" Yes, it's a 6 seater. So what? The place was dead. She obliged and went on her way (this reminded me of the On the Teak hostess who clearly did not know how to do her job). Our waiter was nice but he was somewhat hard to get a hold of. We had to chase him down a couple of times- for a pretty relaxed night, that fell below ideal service. We were contemplating whether we should get some stuff from the raw bar or other seafood entrees. It is, after all, a seafood joint. But with such a small number of patrons, I inevitably questioned the quality and freshness of the raw bar options. We decided to skip a heavy selection of seafood. Soooo, we opted for the tuna tacos (was cooked well when we asked for medium well. Go with medium so it doesn't come out too tough). It came with a wasabi mayo sauce, which added a nice spicy kick to the whole ensemble. The wedges (no bacon) were good- came with tarter sauce... Was expecting sour cream- the usual addition to potato skin. These were fine. Enough cheddar cheese to make me happy. Then we shared the New English clam chowder. It was good- very good, in fact. I also loved how the waiter offered to split it for us in advance so we didn't have to engage inadvertent spoon fights. The chicken tenders were good but the sauce that came with- horseradish+mustard mix- was BOMB. Loved it. I let the tenders swim a bit in it before I chomped away at it like it was nobody's business. We ordered a lot of drinks- and it was past 7pm (HH ends then), so I was expecting a big bill. To my surprise, it barely hit 3 digits before tip. The drinks are strong - I had one too many titos with a splash of pineapple juice. Heavy handed bartenders are my absolutely favorite.The decor is VERY VERY casual. I wouldn't choose this for a date night. It's a good place to stop by for a beer and a filling meal but nothing more. Of course, I expect this place to be at capacity on game days with all their TVs and spacious standing area. I'm not crossing this off my list just yet. I'm definitely gonna try a seafood entree (was hard to find something that was GF and I got sick of reading....

I got a crab cake and clams oreganata and my food came out super fast which I loved because I was starving. I also really liked that they had a DJ spinning some awesome music the night I was there which made the vibe of the whole restaurant really cool. Biggies also has really amazing happy hour with great pricing on food and drinks. And I believe on Tuesdays they offer $2 oysters & clams. ( I could be wrong on the date ) But if you aren't a big seafood person they definitely have a lot more to offer than just that.

This review is based on our last experience at Newark St. which was quite unfortunate. Some inclement weather hit, so we called ahead to see if Biggies was open and serving food. The response was ""yes"" so we decided to trudge down eight blocks in the snow. Upon arriving we were given a ""modified"" menu basically consisting of fried, previously frozen food. Fine. We'll deal with it. We decided to stay against our better judgment although I was very upset that the raw bar had nobody to man it, taking those options completely off the table. It was Tuesday, so the half price raw bar menu was one of the main reasons we made the trip. Fine. We'll deal with it. We got a couple of vodka soaked Bloody Mary's that were just about drinkable. There was SO MUCH vodka in them. Fine. We'll deal with it. But then, to our dismay we saw every other table ordering off the regular menu (we saw some with soups, there was a dish of salmon being brought out, etc). We were the ONLY ONES in the place that had to order off the crappy, overpriced menu of wings and mozzarella sticks.Safe to say after this nightmarish experience we will not be back. If you are going to open during inclement weather, I commend you.

The hostess tried to seat us next to 2 huge and loud groups- I said absoeffinlutely not. Why? There were plenty of seats. Then she took us to the back... NO. At this point, I just said, ""let me take the high top."" Yes, it's a 6 seater. So what? The place was dead. She obliged and went on her way (this reminded me of the On the Teak hostess who clearly did not know how to do her job). Our waiter was nice but he was somewhat hard to get a hold of. We had to chase him down a couple of times- for a pretty relaxed night, that fell below ideal service. We were contemplating whether we should get some stuff from the raw bar or other seafood entrees. It is, after all, a seafood joint. But with such a small number of patrons, I inevitably questioned the quality and freshness of the raw bar options. We decided to skip a heavy selection of seafood. Soooo, we opted for the tuna tacos (was cooked well when we asked for medium well. Go with medium so it doesn't come out too tough). It came with a wasabi mayo sauce, which added a nice spicy kick to the whole ensemble. The wedges (no bacon) were good- came with tarter sauce... Was expecting sour cream- the usual addition to potato skin. These were fine. Enough cheddar cheese to make me happy. Then we shared the New English clam chowder. It was good- very good, in fact. I also loved how the waiter offered to split it for us in advance so we didn't have to engage inadvertent spoon fights. The chicken tenders were good but the sauce that came with- horseradish+mustard mix- was BOMB. Loved it. I let the tenders swim a bit in it before I chomped away at it like it was nobody's business. We ordered a lot of drinks- and it was past 7pm (HH ends then), so I was expecting a big bill. To my surprise, it barely hit 3 digits before tip. The drinks are strong - I had one too many titos with a splash of pineapple juice. Heavy handed bartenders are my absolutely favorite.The decor is VERY VERY casual. I wouldn't choose this for a date night. It's a good place to stop by for a beer and a filling meal but nothing more. Of course, I expect this place to be at capacity on game days with all their TVs and spacious standing area. I'm not crossing this off my list just yet. I'm definitely gonna try a seafood entree (was hard to find something that was GF and I got sick of reading.... I'll be back to try the raw bar on a slightly busier day.",Biggie’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, Seafood"

One plus is the bartenders area really awesome and great at making sure you are never left with an empty drink.I sat at the bar with about 5 friends and we ordered some food. I got a crab cake and clams oreganata and my food came out super fast which I loved because I was starving. I also really liked that they had a DJ spinning some awesome music the night I was there which made the vibe of the whole restaurant really cool. Biggies also has really amazing happy hour with great pricing on food and drinks. And I believe on Tuesdays they offer $2 oysters & clams. ( I could be wrong on the date ) But if you aren't a big seafood person they definitely have a lot more to offer than just that.

This review is based on our last experience at Newark St. which was quite unfortunate. Some inclement weather hit, so we called ahead to see if Biggies was open and serving food. The response was ""yes"" so we decided to trudge down eight blocks in the snow. Upon arriving we were given a ""modified"" menu basically consisting of fried, previously frozen food. Fine. We'll deal with it. We decided to stay against our better judgment although I was very upset that the raw bar had nobody to man it, taking those options completely off the table. It was Tuesday, so the half price raw bar menu was one of the main reasons we made the trip. Fine. We'll deal with it. We got a couple of vodka soaked Bloody Mary's that were just about drinkable. There was SO MUCH vodka in them. Fine. We'll deal with it. But then, to our dismay we saw every other table ordering off the regular menu (we saw some with soups, there was a dish of salmon being brought out, etc). We were the ONLY ONES in the place that had to order off the crappy, overpriced menu of wings and mozzarella sticks.Safe to say after this nightmarish experience we will not be back. If you are going to open during inclement weather, I commend you. However I would also suggest that just opening to say you were open is senseless and left you with a couple of very unhappy customers.",Biggie’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, Seafood"

I'm sure the place has looked cooler somewhere along the line.I ordered the wings The buffalo sauce is very nice, a classic zing. The meat, however, is like marshmallow. You can practically taste the hormone injections, and the sadness. It's so fluffy, even the gristle chews like meat.

43,ornb1UYCzFd2u9Y_ldGvPA,Nicole R.,4.0 star rating,Happy Hour. Probably the two best words everyone looks forward to after a long day at work. Luckily for my hometown of Hoboken there are numerous bars on every block however this at times leaves the best HH spots to get lost in the mix. Biggie's (a national treasure in Hoboken) has the best Happy Hour specials in town. For starters it starts at 3 unlike other places that begin at 4. Of course my favorite part is you can take advantage of the great specials no matter where you sit! Want to hang at the bar and watch the games? No problem. Or rather sit at a booth and unwind about your day? No problem! The establishment itself is large and very spacious. The servers are always nice and attentive and food and drinks come out quickly. I think their bar food is really good. I ordered chicken tenders with mozzarella sticks and it was good quality HH food. Some might be thinking to themselves how can you mess these two up? Trust me I've had some low quality mozzarella sticks at places but never at Biggie's. If you aren't in the mood for any of the food specials have a regular entree. The sandwiches and especially clams are delicious and always fresh. Drinks are done right. Nothing that will blow your mind but also nothing that leaves you wondering if you're sipping on an adult or child beverage. Biggie's is the best HH in town if you want space and affordable good quality specials hands down.,Biggie’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, Seafood"
44,iHV_Ef7WMAu6u0XNyZgvJA,Sara M.,4.0 star rating,"I don't like clams or oysters. There, I said it. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I still enjoy Biggies and had a positive experience both times that I dined there. Although it's a clam bar by name, the menu is EXTENSIVE and has lots of goodies from both land and sea to choose from. Salads, apps, sandwiches, pastas, seafood entrees, you name it. They've got everything on the docket. It's hard to be healthy here. Just accept it, and move on. The first time I came was for a birthday party and we shared slew of high caloric eats such as spin artichoke dip, pizza, waffle fries and fried calamari. I had a mojito because they were on special that night. I'm not one to turn down a mojito, but it left me wishing that I had. It was really watery and didn't have fresh mint leaves. There are some restaurants that you just don't order a mojito from and I should've guessed that Biggies was not one of them. It's less of a cocktail and more of a beer spot, and that is completely fine. I came again last night for a quick din and was not feeling anything greasy or fried. I was really just looking for a spot to watch the Rangers game that had ample seating and knew that Biggies would have the space. It was difficult but I ended up restraining myself and going with a side garden salad accompanied by a glass of pino. Snoooooze. Stop judging me. The ""side"" salad felt like a full salad entree and had a lot of veggies tossed up in a sweet and tangy house vinaigrette. I was satisfied, but still held back fits of jealousy while da mans gobbled up a fried crab cake and fries. Okay, I snuck a bite. It was good, like reallllyyyyy good. This place has lots of space and is a great option when all of the other bars on Washington are packed out during a sports game.

I used an app (that I actually found through an ""on table"" advertisement at Biggie's) that gives discounts at local restaurants. I went to lunch with a co-worker (just the 2 of us) and the app gave us 10% off our check. When I brought the discount to the waitress's attention right before asking for the check, she left and returned with our check, mentioning that an 18% gratuity was added on. For a table of 2???? I've never experienced that before anywhere, including Biggie's. I'm sure it's because we received a discount off of our check but we're very good tippers (and I realize that that is not true of everyone). We're smart enough to know that the tip should be based on the pre discounted price. And I found it insulting and presumptuous to assume that either or both was untrue. I also don't feel that I should be obligated to leave an 18% tip (although we do usually leave 20%, and probably would've on this visit too, but leave that option up to me!).  Very unhappy with the gratuity experience on this visit.",Biggie’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, Seafood"

Bread was a bit on the dryer side, more than I'm used to with a Po-Boy, but the flavor profile was still very pleasant. The accompanying cole-slaw on the sandwich was --- How do these young kids say nowadays --- ON FLEEK. A nice, mildly-vinegary, semi-sweet, oh-so-crispy slaw.

I was actually pumped to give this spot a whirl and I came for a Buffalo Trace/Yelp event and grabbed some dinner before hand and I don't think it quite hit my expectations. The salad and turkey chili were really just regular and for the price, just A-OK. So regular, I can't go into much detail. Nothing stood out. The food it seems is very similar to the venue: pretty generic.At the event I sampled mozz sticks, pizza, calamari, clams and again, everything was pretty average (and deep fried). The mozz sticks were straight outta the bag frozen, the pizza was subpar, but I do have to admit the calamari and clams were good.Overall, I don't get a great neighborhood vibe. The place has a bar right when you walk in and then the rest of the dining room is kind of just there. Not much attention paid to aesthetics. Throughout the night, I found that some of the staff were delightful while others were just not that nice.

I sat at the bar to wait for her and ordered us elf a $5 margarita because it's their Monday special, they have $5 martinis all the time as well. And this margarita was incredibly strong, it's the type of drink I would've appreciated on a Saturday night if I wanted to get uber drunk... And since it was Monday, I didn't finish it... I know, kind of lame, but seriously, it was Monday...I also ordered some freshly shucked oysters, they only carry Blue Points, and they were fine, but the oysters Rockefeller were amazing.By dinner time I ordered the shrimp poboy with the cabbage on the side (per my waitresses recommendation) and it was good, the rock shrimp and remoulade were well prepared, and the waffle fries were the perfect accompaniment.My friend ordered the firecracker shrimp tacos, which was like the poboy only on a tortilla with lettuce instead of cabbage, I would've preferred the tacos.Overall, standard seafood chain, wouldn't be my first choice, but isn't the worst either.",Biggie’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, Seafood"

So like I said, we were there on a Saturday evening and it was packed. But Kyle never made it feel that way. He was always there when we needed something.

Mussells - this was very good and the sauce was great for dipping.Poboy - I had it 2 ways. One half was shrimp and the other clam.  Both were great but I liked the shrimp much better.Chicken parm - superb. An excellent dish and I would get it again. Cheese steak - this was just okay. It wasn't bad but compared to everything else, it wasn't the greatest.We had 3 appetizers, 8 entrees and plenty of drinks.  Our bill came to $25 per person, which I think was reasonable.  The food was a solid 4 but the service was a 5.

80,kw_unRenFD-ModrsLLL2_g,Victoria C.,4.0 star rating,"After once visiting the Madison Street location in Hoboken, I planned a day to come back to Biggie's Clam Bar with a friend, and I was super excited. When I had gone a year or so ago to the Madison Street location, the place was a little rough around the edges, looking more like a fast food joint than anything, but the food was good and I was craving some good ol' seafood again. After making these plans to go back to Biggie's, we met up and I searched for Biggie's on my maps app and ended up at this Newark Street location rather than Madison (it had been a while since I went so I didn't realize there were different locations). Boy, was I happy I ended up here. Food: B+ My friend and I ordered the following to share: Thai Chili Calamari, Shrimp Oreganata, Biggie's Clam Pizza, and the Seafood Fiesta linguini with pink cream & plum tomato Fiesta sauce. The shrimp oreganata and the seafood fiesta linguini were particularly on point. I love seafood and so I liked the great variety of different seafood included (shrimp, scallops, clams, mussels, calamari, crab meat). The shrimp oreganata was broiled butterflied shrimp with oreganata bread crumbs, and it was DELISH. The calamari was awesome too. I wish it had been a little bit less soggy, but since it was covered in the thai chili sauce, it was the best it could be, I suppose. As for the clam pizza, I actually didn't really enjoy it. It didn't really have much sauce or taste in my opinion, but my friend did like it - must be a matter of pizza preferences. Besides the pizza, I really enjoyed the food, though I ended up spending quite a bit for it. Drinks: CIn a nutshell, not much bang for your (substantial) buck.Service: B-The wait staff was friendly enough, albeit kind of slow. We were seated in the back and didn't get all thattt much attention, despite the fact that there weren't many tables at all. I'm not sure what they were doing with their time.Ambiance: AUnlike the Madison Street location, which had a fast food/diner type of feel to it, this location was much more a ""date place."" The décor and general feel was much classier and mature. Their tables were wooden with a nice deep finish, the lighting was intimate but not too dark, and the space was set up well for some more privacy than many other places (you don't feel squashed together with other tables). What was nice about this place was that while it was classier, it still had a chill vibe where you could relax, let loose, and have a good time.",Biggie’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, Seafood"

Food:   - Calamari: one of the BEST calamari in town.  It tastes fresh like they catch their own squid and cook it in the back. (The garlic butter that comes with it is amazingly delicious!)   - Wings: Average wings - nothing to rave about  - Seafood Salad: Absolutely AMAZING!  They piled on the seafood!  Scallops, shrimps, calamari, mussels!  None of that imitation crab meat that a lot of places use as stuffer!  It is pretty big and I barely finished half of it!  Pure heaven of leftovers for me the next day.   - Lobster Roll: It is more like lobster salad on a bun... not a fan at all!  Avoid unless you want lobster salad.   - Ribeye Sandwich: It is pretty amazing!  Asked for medium rare and the meat was cooked properly.  Meat was very tender and flavorful.",Biggie’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, Seafood"

Wow.All the food was still hot and crisp.  Portions were generous. Fries were not soggy.  Shrimp were not over fried into unrecognizable little lumps.  The sandwich, now this is where I think they lose a star.  Not because the sandwich wasn't good - it was.  But it came wrapped in tin foil and all the cheese had come out of the sandwich and stuck to the foil.  The cheese was good, what I still had in the sandwich, but really wish there was some other way of getting it to me.Now let me wax poetic on the onion rings.  Thick cut.  Perfectly fried.  Not too much batter, but not too little either.  Making this experience a delight was the dipping sauce.  I thought at first it was either a French or a Thousand Island dressing.  If it was French, then it certainly had a cajun flair.  A beautiful spice that built on the tongue that perfectly complimented the crunch of the onion ring.We enjoyed dinner so much, I called AJ (the manager) and thanked him.  Good show!",Biggie’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, Seafood"

A garlic taste but I can't really put my finger on the exact ingredients. It was a yummy dressing.Flounder with fries - This flounder was baked with breadcrumbs in a wine sauce.

Madeleine was a great bartender, she remembered every single drink that I had to the T!  She was able to tell me where it was from and the classification of beer.  I was shocked, what a great experience I had because of the stellar service I received from the bartender.  I wish there were more service oriented people like ""Maddy"" (as her name appears on the bill), that can help Hoboken patrons.",Biggie’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, Seafood"

I knew about its history with the town, and its old smaller location, but I was excited to see something new. Since it has opened I have been a few times, and every time is a fun adventure, entertaining and delicious.The place is big with a bar, lots of tables and a ton of TV's. It deffo gives off the sportsbar kind of vibe, but you can have a civilized meal as well. At certain times of day or specific days of the week, it does get quite loud, sports excitement and beer. The menu is huge, but it is comprised mostly of appetizers, raw bar items and sandwiches. There is definitely something for everyone on the menu, mozzarella stics, wings, steamed clams...The entrees range from ribs to an array of pastas with seafood. I had one of the pastas once, and I can't say it was terribly memorable in taste, but the portion was huge.In fact all the portions are huge. Not one plate goes by that is skimpy, or small. Biggie's is all about the American style portion size, large. I tend to get the burger there because it is a super good deal. Six bucks for a giant burger and a hugemongous mound of fries... sounds like a bargain. It is a pretty tasty burger, especially if you get all the fixin's, and the fries are waffled goodness (sometimes on the greasy side).I am a sucker for seafood, so Biggie's has ended up being a go to spot for my steamed clams and tasty calamari.  The Thai Chili Calamari has been the latest item added to my crave menu. It is delicious and addictive; spicy, sweet, crunchy, chewy. And every time the entire mound disappears. So good, like I want some now good.On top of the pretty reasonably priced food items, seafood, American favorites and all, there are always happy hour deals. A huge variety of fancy mixed drinks and a solid amount of the usuals, and everyday brings a different happy hour special. Can't say all of their fancy drinks are the greatest, but $2 Miller products day is a good one to stumble in on.Biggie's is deffo a fun spot. The servers and the staff are really great, friendly, warm and helpful. They also look like they are having fun there too, while getting the job done.

Dre got a winter beer (I think the Blue Moon Winter) and the rim of the glass was coated in a sort of white chocolate. Very tasty. Service was decent.

I decided to head down for this afternoon's Rangers-Devils playoff game and I was not disappointed. This spot is similarly decorated to their restaurant in Carlstadt-- dark wood, big windows and lots of flat-screens. If you're a Biggie's virgin you gotta know a few things. +The Clams on the Half Shell are a must-- shucked-to-order and always fresh. +The ""Galamod"" is excellent but the spicy marinara and garlic mayo sauces take it to another level. +The Garlic Mozz Cheese Steak ain't Philly-style but it's a winner. +The Italian bread many of their sandwiches are served on is unbelievable. Just because the joint looks like a sports bar doesn't mean you have to order mozzarella sticks and wings. Go ahead and order the Sausage and Broccoli Rabe or Meatball Parm. Over the years I've never had a bad meal at Biggie's and their growth from a storefront lunch-on-the-run kinda place to a full fledged bar and restaurant is a great thing. This new spot will definitely be near the top of my list of places to go to catch a game. They have a bunch of beers on tap and the Brooklyn IPA worked out just fine for me today. At $6 a pint it's not dive-bar cheap but fairly priced for Hoboken. There are plenty of TVs-- I counted 17 or 18 from my spot at the bar.

It was very full and a HUGE bowl tons of clams and potatoes etc. The consistency was great. It was a bit on the salty side but aside from that I would recommend it. I also had the steamed little necks which came in a very tasty broth. They were also cooked to perfection. The menu had a lot of amazing options and it is very competitively priced for a seafood restaurant.

He didn't even welcome me with a smile when I sat down nor offered me a menu. I guess he figured since my friend was there already waiting for me that I would just share hers. Messed up on the drink orders a few times and totally forgot one that was asked but we didn't make a fuss about it. We were pretty disappointed since there was barely anyone there you would think he would remember but instead simply said he forgot? Not once did he even come by to ask how everything was or if we needed something when the food came out. To be honest;  he was not made to be a bartender since typically one would call to be more outgoing and fun.  On to the food, I would say the appetizers we tried were mediocre.  We got the crab sliders , calamari, and the flounder tacos. None of which had much taste but nonetheless was edible.  Didn't wow me with flavor for sure. On the other hand ordered a lobster roll as an entree and it was delicious!  Hands down; my only gripe was that for $22 all it came with was waffle fries?  Perhaps a side of slaw or pickle would have been nice then again not sure if it was just forgotten to be put on the plate? If the service was better I would probably had given it 4 stars, however overall I wasn't too impressed with the place and probably wouldn't come back.",Biggie’s,3.5 star rating,$$,"Sports, Bars,, Seafood"

We weren't looking for a fancy place, just good simple food and a relatively clean, uncrowded atmosphere. I arrived in Hoboken first and didn't have the slightest idea where to go, but this place was only a couple of blocks from the train and it was drizzling and I didn't feel like strolling all the way to Washington St in the rain. I walked in and asked the hostesses point-blank if the burgers there were good. They said definitely! And they were right--the burgers are absolutely perfect, and the waffle fries might be frozen, I don't know, but I don't care--they were great. We had a series of $5 Bellini martinis (the afternoon special) and, unlike many other cocktails I've had in Hoboken, they contained enough alcohol that you could really taste it. For dinner we got the Snickers pie and the chocolate mousse cake... the Snickers was better, but they were both good. Great food, excellent service, close to the train...

I mean there's literally not a bad seat in the house. Overall a really nice atmosphere, and we were promptly greeted. Upon sitting I immediately noticed the $2 draft special they were having Miller, not exactly my beer of choice, but for two bucks it would do the trick. After giving our drink orders, we decided to try the spinach dip as an appetizer. Not the best dip I've ever had, but it was pretty tasty! For an entree I settled on the shrimp po boy. The food was fairly quick coming out but didn't really impress. One of the things they brag about is the locally baked bread. As someone that likes my bread soft, it wasn't exactly my cup of tea. The sandwich came with a generous helping of waffle fries. As someone that loves french fries, I will say that these are probably the main reason for the three star rating. They definitely made up for the subpar sandwich. Overall Biggies is a nice sports bar with decent food. Also, they had a live band playing.

Some of the beers they consider craft beer are pretty mainstream but the fact that they have some is a bonus. There are a TON of TV's so if you want to watch the game you can.

It was incredibly loud up front where we walked in, but after asking for a booth we were led to the back where most of the families were and it was much quieter and made for a better experience. Even though I read reviews before going, my date and I each got our own appetizers and entrees and we ended up leaving stuffed! They definitely go big when it comes to portion size. We started with the Thai chili calamari and spinach-artichoke dip. Didn't try the calamari but from the way it was devoured it must be really good! The dip was excellent as well...incredibly cheesy and the perfect amount of chips for the amount of dip you get. Nothing worse than having to leave dip behind because there's not enough to eat it with! As for the entrees, they were lacking a little bit in flavor. We both got a cheeseburger. They were perfectly cooked, but the meat was just so bland. The waffle fries could have also used some salt and pepper. Overall, a good experience and it didn't hurt that it's relatively inexpensive.
