0,S2BCLt-jCRZz34zcxZS6jQ,Tam V.,5.0 star rating,"Really good spanish food for an insanely reasonable price. One meal feeds 2 people. I've had the goat and oxtail, both firsts for me, and the chuleta. I had my meals with yellow rice black beans and avacado. Highly recommend giving this place a try. Not the typical oversalted spanish food your used to.",52 Restaurant,5.0 star rating,$,Spanish
