We went with 20 of their oysters, and 6 of their deviled eggs ($1 each during HH). The oysters were sizable, and the mignonette it came with was nice. Some of my oysters had bits of shell in them but it wasn't too bad overall (BF said most of his had bits of shell so I guess he was a bit unlucky). The deviled eggs were perfect. Each came with a sliver of fried garlic, which added a lot of flavor.I'm not sure if I would come back for regular food, as nothing really stood out to me. But I'll definitely be back the next time I need some dollar oysters.

Since he would not come around to ask if we needed anything else or more champagne, we decided to order a round of pecan pie shots from the bar.  Once they were delivered to our table, one of the shots was filled to the brim with just whipped cream, and no alcohol.  One of my family members brought the shot back up to the bar and showed the bartender.  The bartender did not apologize or make her a new shot, instead he took the shot out of her hand and said ""you messed with that shot, it was not sent to your table like that"" and continued making excuses while the manager watched the whole thing and said nothing.  The only person to apologize for our terrible dining experience was the hostess-- who had nothing to do with any of this.  She was very sweet and felt bad for the horrible service.  We left without a buzz and still hungry.  Don't bother coming here unless you're looking to be hungry and irritated during a 3.5 hour brunch, that should have been only 2 hours.  We will not be returning any time soon, especially since the management has to come up with excuses for having horrible customer service.",Halifax,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

We decided to try out this spot, was recommended by one of my friends as we are foodies and always like to see what's trendy and fun. This place has both ! So let's begin shall we..... we arrived around 12:30 ( noon time ) for their brunch. Was immediately greeted by a hostess. She asked if we had a reservation and told her we didn't. They still accommodated us, which was nice. The waiter came over within the first 20 seconds and acknowledged we were there. The menu looked pretty confusing at first. However, he did come over and explain it to us. For 32.00 unlimited mimosas and unlimited small plates ! So the way it works is, the entire menu comes around putting on the table small plates of food and when done the next keep coming around. Food was 70/30. Some of the items were on point and really tasty and some were so so. Still good, but not as good as others. Hence why the 4 stars and not 5. The music was on point, but low enough to where you can still have a convo with someone and loud enough to not hear the people next to you. Only kinda wished the tables were a little bigger, between the champagne, the coffee, the water and of course the phones for the food selfies the room was tight for the food. Other than that, the salmon was on point, the Cuban sandwich beautifully cooked, eggs were cooked right, sweet meatballs could have been a little bigger ( but still delish ) we will 100% be back. There were a lot more items that I didn't mention, but I want you to be the judge.",Halifax,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
3,BkeVDw_RyxfxmgDIoNFd6w,Em K.,3.0 star rating,"I came here for brunch on a Sunday morning with my friends. We didn't have a reservation so we sat at the bar, which wasn't crowded and fully staffed. The hostess told us that their brunch is becoming very popular, and that people make reservations weeks in advance. I was surprised to hear that so many 20 something year olds in Hoboken are booking Sunday brunch weeks in advance as opposed to stumbling in hungry and hungover like we did. But definitely make a reservation if you want a table. Halifax has a super trendy vibe and a great view of the NYC skyline.  The space is large and very open. For somewhere between 21 and 23 (I don't remember and they appear to change their prices) dollars, you get unlimited small plates. For a little more than that, you get a bottle of champagne. Not sure if you get more or less than that, depending on your party size. That was unclear.  Actually, a lot of this menu was very unclear, which I'll get into. If you just want to order a la carte, small plates are $6 each.The way the menu reads, it seems like you can pick and choose from all the small plates and order as much or as little as you want. But in actuality, if you choose the unlimited option, they bring out all of the small plates in waves. This was very poorly explained and stressful for me, as I have food allergies. We finally understood what was going on once they started bringing everything out, but it was confusing because there were a few times where they brought out just one of something, and we had to remind them that there were 3 of us, to which we heard them mutter under their breaths ""you only ordered 1.""  No, we didnt order anything except say that we were doing the unlimited brunch! It was all extremely strange and confusing.  The servers were also being very literal. Like I ordered a coffee and they brought me black coffee with no sugar or cream and didn't ask me if I wanted any. The food was very delicious. It's all locally sourced. There was so much of it for a very reasonable price. It was all cooked well, and there was so much variety. They had both hot and cold plates. I wanted to give Halifax 4 stars but couldn't due to the choppy service. Nevertheless, I'd come back and recommend their brunch to others.",Halifax,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

This place has changed names a few times now and I was worried that this may be another short stay, but wow was I wrong!!We started with the squash frites and the charcuterie.  The squash frites were unique and surprisingly delicious. They were crunchy, salty, and a perfect start to the meal.I am not the biggest charcuterie person but the one I liked in particular was the smoked salmon. It was kind of like salmon jerky and went well with the different items.  One thing that would have been better is if the meat/cheese came with jams. The sweet salty combination would have made this even better.I would highly recommend ordering the cavatelli special with meat and sauce. It is very good and cooked perfectly al dente. Take a look at the picture who the waiter and order that.We also tried the salmon which was also tender and not dry. This was some superb salmon!For our sides we tried the polenta which wasnt the bed I have had. It was more like mushy porridge than creamy polenta. Seemed like they overcooked it a little. The cauliflower was good but the sides were not the star of the show here the entrees were. It is a little pricey here but the decor and view is unbelievable.

5,y_LETSyVwMVKbMSHwHDioQ,Erin A.,3.0 star rating,Went to the Halifax for the first time. We went for brunch and I tried to make a reservation and I couldn't online. Apparently they have 2 waves of brunch which was not explained on the website. And the first wave was sold out. But there were tables free they still wouldn't seat us. So we waited for a seat at the bar. Which further would take 15 to 20 minutes. The manager came to talk to us about why we couldn't get a table. She was very nice but still didn't make sense to me. We've been waiting for about 30 minutes now for someone to get up from the bar. The manager gave us complimentary champagne while we waited which was very nice.Finally a spot opened up at the bar and we were able to do unlimited brunch which was unlimited champagne and small plates of food for 32 dollars which is such a great deal. I'm a vegetarian so I only could eat very few of them but the ones I could eat were good. My friend is allergic to sea food so we decided not to get the sea food options. They were very accommodating.  After the first round of small plates. We just wanted the French toast and potatoes which they brought out. The food comes out fast which is good too. My only problem was they should state it on the website about the brunch and reservation situation so no one ends up waiting around like we did. Also if people have dietary issues or specific dietary concerns i think they shouldn't have to pay the whole 32 especially if they aren't eating most of it. As a vegetarian my options were super limited but I did enjoy my time after the seating situation was dealt with.,Halifax,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
6,l2-tfy5a1fYT4XKt20L8vw,Joan Y.,3.0 star rating,"Delicious food dampened by a bad service experience. Came here last night (Saturday) for dinner and everything started out ok. We were seated promptly without a reservation (I live in town and the expansive seating area always has tables open) at a table with a great view. We opted for three courses, starting with cured meats and cheeses (shout out to the 3/ $16 deal). Btw, the patè - so so good. As it was my first time at Halifax (the restaurant in this W hotel location changes often) I was pleasantly surprised at the complimentary bread and popcorn. The bread was legitimately a pillowy soft biscuit and I could've cried at how yummy it was!When our appetizers were ready, we were still barely halfway through our meats and the server asked us if he could clear the food on the table. I said no, we were still working, but we condensed our plates and offered he could clear the personal decanters from our wine and the popcorn. My friend also added that we were slow eaters as we like to talk and enjoy our food. To start, I got the pear salad (turns out not a personal fav, but I wouldn't discourage others from getting it) and my friend the sea bream tartar (so light and tasty!). I still had half my salad on my plate and her fork was literally still scooping up the last bite when the server took the plate from the table. Shocked at the audacity, I said hey we are still eating and the server, Luis A, sheepishly apologized.During our entree (highly recommend the lobster rigatoni, flavorful and surprisingly not creamy), no joke a total of 4 different people checked in on our table. At first I thought oh how nice the manager cares, but by the end I was highly confused and feeling rushed out. However, THERE WERE EMPTY TABLES IN THE VENUE THE ENTIRE TIME. Even weirder? After our check came out, it took 15 minutes for the server to take our credit cards. Why the rush the entire time, then the hold up at the end? In honesty, we got 3 courses, spent almost $200 and were there from about 8pm - 9:30pm. Not overstaying if you ask me! Delicious food.

My favorite dishes were the cheese plate and short rib with polenta. Also, the dessert, a seasonal pumpkin cake, was the perfect bite to end the meal.It was nice to try a little bit of everything.

I've eaten here a few times and it was lackluster at best.First off, the waiter had the kind of attitude you get from a lot of waiters in LA: grudgingly pleasant but not pleased about the whole being a waiter thing. I asked for very soft scrambled eggs and buttered toast. I emphasized very soft eggs (please, really, very very soft, thanks), and also asked if the kitchen could butter the toast while it was still warm. He throws me a diva look and said, ""You want the kitchen to butter the toast? (Pause. Blank stare.) Not sure if it's possible.""He then brought me an airline lounge quality latte: pretty bad. Didn't really taste like it had espresso. Watery. Too much foam. No color. Just bad.The breakfast arrived. Eggs were hard and cold. Toast was buttered but buttered after the toast was cold, which defeated the reason for them buttering it in the kitchen. Maybe that was the point they they were trying to make. An utterly forgettable, badly-made breakfast that you can get at any run-of-the-mill Jersey diner. A definite miss. For the W brand?

Beef sliders were full of flavor! The sweet & salty flavors from the marmalade and the hint of spiciness from the fresno sauce was a great combination. Oysters were fresh and I really liked their mignonette sauce. However, the salt cod & shrimp fritters were really bad; it was entirely batter and way overcooked. The batter was so overly fried that it felt like biting into a rock and the delicate seafood was so dry that I would not know what the contents were if not for the menu. All the other food were great so I think this might have been a fluke but the fritters I had were awful.Service - 4/5. The service felt a little bit rushed to take the order but it was fine otherwise.Value - 5/5. The happy hour menu has great choices and the prices are amazing. $1 oysters will always be a winner!

We drove down the 20 minutes it took to reach the W.  Valet parking was only $5 with validated parking receipt - so much better than hunting for street parking.  Walking into the W, we immediately felt the cool relief of the air conditioned, high ceilinged, lobby.  Still, we opted to sit outside under blue canvas roof so we could enjoy the view and the street life on Sinatra Drive (Yes. Frank was born and raised here, as was my father). Many beautiful people out for a stroll this day.  Our service was friendly and efficient, with an old wine bottle filled with cool water placed on our table, and refilled as needed.  The menu was not large, but demonstrated a fairly wide and interesting description of the kitchen's capabilities.  We ordered the Quinoa Burger and Grilled Cheese combo.  Both of us tried the cold cream of asparagus soup, as our curiosity got the best of us on this warm August afternoon.  Both came with small salads nesting on the main plate. The veggie burger was large, fresh and not too tightly packed.  Nice texture and taste on a large brioche-style roll.  The grilled cheese was a pressed panini, and had the mix of cheeses oozing out the edges before they began to slowly cool and harden.  Eating the cheese as it morphed between runny goo and firm cheddar/Havarti solid was an unexpected pleasure. The bread stayed firm, crunchy and warm throughout.  Really liked this rendition of the classic sandwich. The chilled asparagus soup was interesting, but not my favorite flavor, as the taste was not what I recognized as Asparagus officinalis (garden asparagus). It wasn't unpleasant, just unexpected and a tad underwhelming.  Despite that small hiccup, Halifax is a very cool place to grab a relaxing meal.  From what I see in the other reviews, it is also a good place to hang out with friends and drinks.  I'm thinking a weekend at the W Hotel with late nights at this joint would make me very popular with my +1.

Seriously, WTF it's not like I didn't have a reservation. Kinda started the meal off on a bad note. Then as soon as we sit down the waitress starts bringing out several dishes at a time even before we've had a chance to take off our coats. After the first onslaught of dishes there is a long wait for the next set of dishes and towards the end of our meal our waitress was not even around to see if we wanted anything else or even more water.

Some of the items were on point and really tasty and some were so so. Still good, but not as good as others. Hence why the 4 stars and not 5. The music was on point, but low enough to where you can still have a convo with someone and loud enough to not hear the people next to you. Only kinda wished the tables were a little bigger, between the champagne, the coffee, the water and of course the phones for the food selfies the room was tight for the food. Other than that, the salmon was on point, the Cuban sandwich beautifully cooked, eggs were cooked right, sweet meatballs could have been a little bigger ( but still delish ) we will 100% be back. There were a lot more items that I didn't mention, but I want you to be the judge.",Halifax,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
23,BkeVDw_RyxfxmgDIoNFd6w,Em K.,3.0 star rating,"I came here for brunch on a Sunday morning with my friends. We didn't have a reservation so we sat at the bar, which wasn't crowded and fully staffed. The hostess told us that their brunch is becoming very popular, and that people make reservations weeks in advance. I was surprised to hear that so many 20 something year olds in Hoboken are booking Sunday brunch weeks in advance as opposed to stumbling in hungry and hungover like we did. But definitely make a reservation if you want a table. Halifax has a super trendy vibe and a great view of the NYC skyline.  The space is large and very open. For somewhere between 21 and 23 (I don't remember and they appear to change their prices) dollars, you get unlimited small plates. For a little more than that, you get a bottle of champagne. Not sure if you get more or less than that, depending on your party size. That was unclear.  Actually, a lot of this menu was very unclear, which I'll get into. If you just want to order a la carte, small plates are $6 each.The way the menu reads, it seems like you can pick and choose from all the small plates and order as much or as little as you want. But in actuality, if you choose the unlimited option, they bring out all of the small plates in waves. This was very poorly explained and stressful for me, as I have food allergies. We finally understood what was going on once they started bringing everything out, but it was confusing because there were a few times where they brought out just one of something, and we had to remind them that there were 3 of us, to which we heard them mutter under their breaths ""you only ordered 1.""  No, we didnt order anything except say that we were doing the unlimited brunch! It was all extremely strange and confusing.  The servers were also being very literal. Like I ordered a coffee and they brought me black coffee with no sugar or cream and didn't ask me if I wanted any. The food was very delicious. It's all locally sourced. There was so much of it for a very reasonable price. It was all cooked well, and there was so much variety. They had both hot and cold plates. I wanted to give Halifax 4 stars but couldn't due to the choppy service. Nevertheless, I'd come back and recommend their brunch to others.",Halifax,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

This place has changed names a few times now and I was worried that this may be another short stay, but wow was I wrong!!We started with the squash frites and the charcuterie.  The squash frites were unique and surprisingly delicious. They were crunchy, salty, and a perfect start to the meal.I am not the biggest charcuterie person but the one I liked in particular was the smoked salmon. It was kind of like salmon jerky and went well with the different items.  One thing that would have been better is if the meat/cheese came with jams. The sweet salty combination would have made this even better.I would highly recommend ordering the cavatelli special with meat and sauce. It is very good and cooked perfectly al dente. Take a look at the picture who the waiter and order that.We also tried the salmon which was also tender and not dry. This was some superb salmon!For our sides we tried the polenta which wasnt the bed I have had. It was more like mushy porridge than creamy polenta. Seemed like they overcooked it a little. The cauliflower was good but the sides were not the star of the show here the entrees were. It is a little pricey here but the decor and view is unbelievable.

25,y_LETSyVwMVKbMSHwHDioQ,Erin A.,3.0 star rating,Went to the Halifax for the first time. We went for brunch and I tried to make a reservation and I couldn't online. Apparently they have 2 waves of brunch which was not explained on the website. And the first wave was sold out. But there were tables free they still wouldn't seat us. So we waited for a seat at the bar. Which further would take 15 to 20 minutes. The manager came to talk to us about why we couldn't get a table. She was very nice but still didn't make sense to me. We've been waiting for about 30 minutes now for someone to get up from the bar. The manager gave us complimentary champagne while we waited which was very nice.Finally a spot opened up at the bar and we were able to do unlimited brunch which was unlimited champagne and small plates of food for 32 dollars which is such a great deal. I'm a vegetarian so I only could eat very few of them but the ones I could eat were good. My friend is allergic to sea food so we decided not to get the sea food options. They were very accommodating.  After the first round of small plates. We just wanted the French toast and potatoes which they brought out. The food comes out fast which is good too. My only problem was they should state it on the website about the brunch and reservation situation so no one ends up waiting around like we did. Also if people have dietary issues or specific dietary concerns i think they shouldn't have to pay the whole 32 especially if they aren't eating most of it. As a vegetarian my options were super limited but I did enjoy my time after the seating situation was dealt with.,Halifax,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

We were seated promptly without a reservation (I live in town and the expansive seating area always has tables open) at a table with a great view. We opted for three courses, starting with cured meats and cheeses (shout out to the 3/ $16 deal). Btw, the patè - so so good. As it was my first time at Halifax (the restaurant in this W hotel location changes often) I was pleasantly surprised at the complimentary bread and popcorn. The bread was legitimately a pillowy soft biscuit and I could've cried at how yummy it was!When our appetizers were ready, we were still barely halfway through our meats and the server asked us if he could clear the food on the table. I said no, we were still working, but we condensed our plates and offered he could clear the personal decanters from our wine and the popcorn. My friend also added that we were slow eaters as we like to talk and enjoy our food. To start, I got the pear salad (turns out not a personal fav, but I wouldn't discourage others from getting it) and my friend the sea bream tartar (so light and tasty!). I still had half my salad on my plate and her fork was literally still scooping up the last bite when the server took the plate from the table. Shocked at the audacity, I said hey we are still eating and the server, Luis A, sheepishly apologized.During our entree (highly recommend the lobster rigatoni, flavorful and surprisingly not creamy), no joke a total of 4 different people checked in on our table. At first I thought oh how nice the manager cares, but by the end I was highly confused and feeling rushed out. However, THERE WERE EMPTY TABLES IN THE VENUE THE ENTIRE TIME. Even weirder? After our check came out, it took 15 minutes for the server to take our credit cards. Why the rush the entire time, then the hold up at the end? In honesty, we got 3 courses, spent almost $200 and were there from about 8pm - 9:30pm. Not overstaying if you ask me! Delicious food.

I've eaten here a few times and it was lackluster at best.First off, the waiter had the kind of attitude you get from a lot of waiters in LA: grudgingly pleasant but not pleased about the whole being a waiter thing. I asked for very soft scrambled eggs and buttered toast. I emphasized very soft eggs (please, really, very very soft, thanks), and also asked if the kitchen could butter the toast while it was still warm. He throws me a diva look and said, ""You want the kitchen to butter the toast? (Pause. Blank stare.) Not sure if it's possible.""He then brought me an airline lounge quality latte: pretty bad. Didn't really taste like it had espresso. Watery. Too much foam. No color. Just bad.The breakfast arrived. Eggs were hard and cold. Toast was buttered but buttered after the toast was cold, which defeated the reason for them buttering it in the kitchen. Maybe that was the point they they were trying to make. An utterly forgettable, badly-made breakfast that you can get at any run-of-the-mill Jersey diner. A definite miss. For the W brand?

Oysters were fresh and I really liked their mignonette sauce. However, the salt cod & shrimp fritters were really bad; it was entirely batter and way overcooked. The batter was so overly fried that it felt like biting into a rock and the delicate seafood was so dry that I would not know what the contents were if not for the menu. All the other food were great so I think this might have been a fluke but the fritters I had were awful.Service - 4/5.

We drove down the 20 minutes it took to reach the W.  Valet parking was only $5 with validated parking receipt - so much better than hunting for street parking.  Walking into the W, we immediately felt the cool relief of the air conditioned, high ceilinged, lobby.  Still, we opted to sit outside under blue canvas roof so we could enjoy the view and the street life on Sinatra Drive (Yes. Frank was born and raised here, as was my father). Many beautiful people out for a stroll this day.  Our service was friendly and efficient, with an old wine bottle filled with cool water placed on our table, and refilled as needed.  The menu was not large, but demonstrated a fairly wide and interesting description of the kitchen's capabilities.  We ordered the Quinoa Burger and Grilled Cheese combo.  Both of us tried the cold cream of asparagus soup, as our curiosity got the best of us on this warm August afternoon.  Both came with small salads nesting on the main plate. The veggie burger was large, fresh and not too tightly packed.  Nice texture and taste on a large brioche-style roll.  The grilled cheese was a pressed panini, and had the mix of cheeses oozing out the edges before they began to slowly cool and harden.  Eating the cheese as it morphed between runny goo and firm cheddar/Havarti solid was an unexpected pleasure. The bread stayed firm, crunchy and warm throughout.  Really liked this rendition of the classic sandwich. The chilled asparagus soup was interesting, but not my favorite flavor, as the taste was not what I recognized as Asparagus officinalis (garden asparagus). It wasn't unpleasant, just unexpected and a tad underwhelming.  Despite that small hiccup, Halifax is a very cool place to grab a relaxing meal.  From what I see in the other reviews, it is also a good place to hang out with friends and drinks.  I'm thinking a weekend at the W Hotel with late nights at this joint would make me very popular with my +1.

Seriously, WTF it's not like I didn't have a reservation. Kinda started the meal off on a bad note. Then as soon as we sit down the waitress starts bringing out several dishes at a time even before we've had a chance to take off our coats.

I know this is very different from what others have experienced, but while I love me a good Sweet Caroline rave, the drunken screams are only bearable for so long. Recently however, I found the ray of sunshine in this city that is sure to have me float over from my normal Jersey City stomping ground quite often. Halifax is a gem of a brunch with high repeat appeal.Connected to the fancy shmancy W hotel and sitting right on the waterfront, Halifax's atmosphere will have you feeling like a Rockefeller on a Fashionnova budget. The high ceilings restaurant really does their brunch in beautiful ways and offers a flexible package for your early afternoon needs. My personal favorite and the only route that anybody should be choosing, is unlimited food and bottomless champagne (please note I didn't use the word mimosas on purpose) all for the pocket heavenly price of $32.The menu is simple American style food that just keep coming and coming. The experience is wonderfully presented by the servers that bring out every plate on the menu in a thoughtful order. Starting with a refreshing strawberry-rhubarb yogurt parfait and summer gazpacho with poached shrimp, moving onto a fluffy Challah-French toast and savory great potato and pouting, and finishing off with cheesy smoky chicken mac and cheese and beef sliders, these are just a few of the many plate options that will be flowed out to your table. By the end of your small plate journey, you'll definitely be asking for repeats of the French toast, poutine, and mac & cheese, along with the risotto balls and beef sliders.The bottomless champagne is poured as soon as you're nearing the end of your glass thanks to the attentive staff. In order to dilute your glass and ensure that you're able to make it to the end of your 2 hour slot, there are carafes of both orange and strawberry juice placed at your table to add that flavor and alcohol cushion.I'd argue that it's nearly impossible to find a brunch deal like this in the tri-state area. Luxury atmosphere, expedient service, fulfilling food, and boozy levels on a hundo come together to bring a successful brunch experience.

The plates are unlimited for 2 hours and it includes bottomless champagne with mixers to make mimosas or a Bellini along with soft drinks, coffee and tea.   Positives:- Posh Decor- Great views of the city- Unlimited Champagne (& yes, they kept it flowing LOL)- Awesome waiter - Benjamin was our waiter, we were a party of 14 and he did his best to accommodate us, ensure our cups were always filled, and we received the food we wanted re-ordered. - I worked with Roxann to setup the reservation, she was friendly and always got back to me quickly. - $5 Valet for up to 3 hours. - My favorite dishes of the 10 small plates we selected: Potato Poutine, Croque Monsieur (the cheese sauce was crack!), and the French Toast (maple whipped cream is to die for!!) Oh! The BLT cheese pufff was a MAJOR hit at the table!Now onto the negatives:- Kitchen is ssslllooowwwww....- The food wasn't coming out fast enough, there was two times that about 15 minutes passed and no food was served. This is a problem when you're constrained to 2 hours of brunch. (I can't see this falling on our waiter because every time I put in an order, I saw he would enter it in the system.)- I requested they bring out the food in servings of 3 and they would only bring out 2 servings, sometimes 1. We're a party of 14 and it's small bites! There should be 3 plates coming out at once. We were only able to eat one bite per order.          - Cherry on top, 2 out of 10 plates weren't even served until the last 45 mins. To add insult to injury, when we reordered the French Toast, they brought out half a plate of French toast! This was everyone's favorite dish! Buzz Kill!- I forgot the name of the woman that was in charge...and I'm not even sure what the problem was, but I did see her exchange words with Benjamin and heard her clearly say ""he was pissing the kitchen off"". I think Benjamin was clearly doing his job and putting in our reorders. - Dishes I could've done without: Buttermilk Fried Chicken (gravy was gross & biscuit was hard), Smoked Mac & Cheese (bland and overcooked), and the Sliders (overcooked, bland and didn't taste like premium meat).My expectations for Halifax were high....Although I wasn't highly disappointed, I wasn't impressed either.",Halifax,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

On Tuesday night they have a special tasting menu that comes with 5 small plates and 5 small wine pours for 29.00. The plates are small but five amounts to a pretty solid sized meal. And the pours are small but five amounts to at least 2 glasses. So for 29.00 this is a pretty solid deal, especially considering how nice of a place Halifax is.The courses included a small cheese and meat plate, salmon crudo, some green veggies (asparagus, I think?), short rib with sweet peas and a sweet strawberry biscuit with ice cream for dessert. There were a variety of pours including red, white, rose, champagne and vermouth. The standout of the meal was definitely the short rib, which was juicy and flavorful. This was also a pretty large piece of meat for a 'small plate'. The service was a bit slow, but when you're hanging out in a place like Halifax it's really hard to complain about anything. Plus, our server was incredibly sweet. I want to come back for everything. I want to come back for their bottomless brunch - it's something like 32 dollars for unlimited bubbly and small plates.

46,TPn3yApRvgR5cUxDXNtqOQ,K L.,3.0 star rating,"I've had the brunch, but haven't yet been for dinner. Many of the other posts explain brunch already, so to keep it short and sweet...if you choose the unlimited option, you get small plates and champagne for 2 hours. You don't get to choose which small plates you want, as they bring each one to the table. After you've had each plate, though, you have the option to get a second order of anything you liked.Interesting concept - I wish you could choose which ones you want from the beginning as I wasn't a fan of everything, but I do like how brunch is centered around the small plates. That's exactly why we wanted to go!  My favorite dishes were the sliders, Mac n cheese, and the chicken and waffles. Would have loved eggs benedict and bacon to be on the menu. The environment is cool, and it wasn't too crowded, so the service was on point. Worth a try, just check the menu beforehand to make sure you're on board with the menu.",Halifax,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

48,yBSP4GXDmiNGOj2fo_mwPg,Kirsten S.,4.0 star rating,Yesterday was my first time eating here. I came for dinner on Tuesday night where they have a special 5 for $29 but only on tues. You get 5 small courses w/ 5 paired tasting size wines for each one. This is a great deal for a girls night out as they tend to eat smaller portions then men. The dishes change seasonally but don't differ to much. 1st course- charcuterie & cheese board2nd course- Pear Arugula salad w/Gorgonzola and spiced nuts (my favorite course) 3rd course- Fall Grains warm squash and couscous like grain with Gouda. The bowl itself was huge with a perfectly sized food portion at the bottom.4th course- Braised Beef Short Rib w/red corn polenta and crispy sunchokes on top. The bowl was to small and made it harder to eat. You had to nearly mash the beef into the polenta. Beef was for tender and quite small but perfect size for me. 5th course- Pumpkin almond cake filled with chocolate. The cake was overwhelmed with the dark chocolate but the whipped cream with spices was delicious. I'm not a drinker so I just tasted each one with appropriate course. The parking can be tough though I found 2hr metered parking. The other options are to valet at W Hotel for $25 for 2 hrs if your dining at the Halifax.,Halifax,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

The view from the front of the restaurant is wonderful (hello NYC) and did I mention that there are essentially bottomless mimosas as well?

Recently, visited Halifax yesterday for a friend's birthday. Over the course of two hours, we were able to sample 10 different small plates  - ranging from yogurt parfaits to maple chicken buns to tomato risotto balls. All the food is quite tasty with the best benefit being able to choose which of the small plates you would like more. From other friends who have been there a couple times, the menu itself changes from time to time so you don't get too bored of the same options. Bottomless wise (2 hours), the servers does a great job of making sure your glass never gets low or completely empty. The champagne flow here definitely isn't something you have to worry about. Added bonus is the two different mixers - classic OJ or the sweet strawberry (my personal fav.) Price wise - $35 per person plus taxes and gratuity.

But Halifax, (formerly Zylo, and can't remember what before that), has come to the rescue of boozy brunches in the mile square.We came with my 2 month old and 2 other family members. It was a chilly Saturday so we sat inside. Ashley, who is just a frickin rock star came over and coached us through brunch and the array of options. It's basically $40 for unlimited small plates and champagne. Now they give you good sparkling wine, not Andre. It goes for $68 a bottle at night, so not Dom but good. The amount of food you get is staggering, even if you don't request a second of a plate. Ashley had a system and we trusted her, and she was spot on. End on the french toast...trust me..no really, don't say ""I'm not listening to this jackass on yelp, I'm starting with it"", no end with it. It's the dessert of the meal.We tried it all (I skipped seafood dishes), and everything was really great. Only two things I didn't love, the chicken thigh sliders and rice ball, the rice ball just needed seasoning with the filling. Everything else was delicious. The yogurt was by far the best parfait I've ever had in my life. The little ham sandwiches, so good. The cheese puff BLT, what an awesome concept.We opted for a couple seconds of things, mostly the french toast and parfait.Also, the champagne is filled and there are 3 juice bottles on the table for you to mix, match or ignore. Blueberry, Strawberry and OJ. The blueberry and strawberry were my favorite, combined they were even better.I really hope Management reads this, because Ashley is a star, she was friendly, fun and we called her coach for helping us navigate this lengthy meal. She was also training another server, good call Halifax, she should train everyone. Get a reservation cause they get booked, but come here for brunch.

I came here two weekends ago for a ladies' only brunch. There were 13 of us, and we had a reservation in advance. Because we were a larger group, our menu was pre-set with 10 items from the menu that we chose beforehand. Upon entering, we were greeted with our pre-set menus and champagne. There were different juices (pear, orange juice, or if you wanted to be adventurous you could mix the two together). Dining with a large group can sometimes be a daunting undertaking, but we were able to begin our morning with style and elegance.I love that the menu is served family-style. It allows you to try a little bit of everything, plus they offer unlimited refills! We also took advantage of the bottomless drinks (both for two hours). I can honestly say I enjoyed everything they brought out for us (and yes, I tried everything). From the mini sliders to the fruit bowl to the french toast, I was in heaven. I think my favorites were the smoked chicken mac & cheese and the croque monsieur (I definitely had seconds on both of those). And if I wanted more? Another order was brought out shortly after. The ambiance is great. The space is open and bright with views overlooking the NYC Skyline. When all was said and done, I paid $45 (including beverages, taxes, and gratuity).

I was disappointed that I didn't get to try the items I found online, but Ruben helped me out in figuring what to order.Our drinks were amazing! Fiancé got the Tom Foolery, and I got the drink from their Summer menu that they were kind enough to make. Couldn't complain about those at all. Bread and popcorn hit the table. Pretty darn good. I kind of forgot we ordered appetizers. We started out with a charcuterie plate and oysters. The charcuterie options are wonderful. The oysters were decent. The mignonette was good.On to main course. I was really really sad that I couldn't order the Sea Bass, but I ended up ordering the Seafood Stew, and I loved it. It was delicious, and the definitely not stingy with the portion. Fiancé ordered the Salmon, and loved it! Flavors complemented each other well, and was light. Both are good options from this restaurant.On to dessert.

They settled on Halifax, and before we knew it we were on our way there. I'm normally not superstitious but normally a sign things would not go too well began even before we arrived. The Uber driver could not find the place from the address given. It took several turns and a phone call to the location for us to finally turn on Sinatra Drive and for the driver to drop us off in front of the place which is listed as facing Hudson (it doesn't.).We begin to eat the bread (not warm, mind you) we got as we waited for our appetizers and main course and make small chat, and notice that it's taking rather long for us to get our meals. Note that we arrived to a mostly empty place. Our main course took nearly an hour and a half to arrive, they were out of several dishes, several drinks... and the desert... I've never seen such a slow, incomplete service.And then we noticed the table beside us. An Asian husband and wife.l, neither who seemed happy with the service. After a series of strained conversations with the waiter we noticed that the wife got up after seeing the bill and went to speak to either the waiter in question or whom ever was in charge. Bob and the husband made some conversation in which they both shared their anger at such a terrible service. Other tables joined in as well. When the bill arrived we saw we'd been overcharged with bloody Mary's and a dish. Needless to say we had to get up (like the Asian lady had done) and go contest the bill.

Clean, modern design with high ceilings and large windows that give you a better view of the NYC skyline than I was expecting from the street level location. The bar and restaurant is spacious, the furniture and decor are classy yet casual, so kudos to Halifax for straying from that overly hip, trendy setting. I spent the evening experiencing the Happy Hour at the bar, engaged in charming conversation while enjoying the drinks and food. First off, there is a happy hour menu that gives you a fair selection of food and drinks and reasonable prices.  My red wine was delicious and a generous pour; the attentive bartender mentioned that the HH wines change daily.  For snacks, we ordered sliders (delicious but note they are served on the rare side), a cheese plate (nice but not sure the toasted bread is the best accompaniment) and a maple creme brûlée (delicious).  I would definitely go back. We stayed past happy hour and watched the Friday night dinner crowd grow and grow. I'd like to try the various Halifax experiences, including lunch, dinner, and brunch.

73,IMrkLxOtWyq7gjiUW2v_Hw,Megan V.,4.0 star rating,Thanks to Yelp for an amazing mystery dinner! Halifax has such an inviting and modern feel. Everything I tasted was amazing however I do have some feedback for some of their courses. First was their charcuterie and cheese board which was pretty amazing. It combine house made charcuterie and local cheeses and the best part was the guava paste ( guava+cheese=warm fuzzy feelings). Second was the NJ pear salad which was also pretty good however the dressing was kinda mayonaise-y for my taste. If I ordered this again at Halifax I would probably just ask for the dressing on the side or for no dressing at all! The candied pecans were a nice touch. Third was their fall grains dish which was probably my favorite since i am a huge fan of barley- and it had a risotto taste with a barley texture which I loved. Def would order the full order of this. The last kind of entree was the braised short rib dish- which I would have to say was a unique twist on what I have had in the past. Red corn polenta added a great touch to this savory dish and the beef was pull apart soft and not chewy at all. The fried sunchokes on the top were more than addicting. Last dish was a pumpkin almond cake with fresh cream which was a great small bite to end the meal. Finding the chocolate inside was a great touch but he cake itself was cooled perfectly and was light and a little sweet (for those who like a more subtle sweetness I'd recommend this dessertx100.,Halifax,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

It was a little daunting to get the waiter's attention - we were snuggled in the corner, so maybe it's better to have a table in the center of the floor.

76,q6Qj-yIq4OnX1e3GWZBAOw,Harry H.,4.0 star rating,"The food was great.. served creatively.. and the space with a view of the Hudson River and the NYC skyline is amazing.Halifax makes it easy to share food with friends which is what dinning out is all about. My friend David took me there for my birthday.. we had a lot of fun picking what we would share. There are a number of ""sharing plates"" and you can also order a charcuterie plate picking either 3 or 5 choices from cured meats, pate, cheeses, smoked fish, etc.. Their was also least least 10 ""sharing dishes"" -- small plates -- on the menu which ranged from Deviled Eggs to Sea Bream Tatar.Missed ReservationsI made the reservation at Halifax the night before and arrived a few minutes before the start time. I let the hostess know my name and that I was meeting a friend. She couldn't find my reservation. I also inquired if perhaps my friend had already arrived? I made sure she had my name spelled correctly. She did seat me in one of the two dinning rooms (plus they do have an outside area), without any fuss. I texted my friend telling him I had arrived and giving him walking directions... but he told me he was already there.. the room was rather empty and I didn't see him. it turns out he was seated in the other room; i got up and found him. If not for the invention of cell phones... and text messaging we could have spent an entire night waiting for each other.Given that the reservation was for 2 people, it should have been kept open until both were seated, and/or they should have been able to look back and see prior reservations (from that same evening). There was one large table in the 2nd room, but otherwise (6:30 pm on a Tues) there was no more than 7 or 8 other tables. They should have known that there was 1 person seated alone (waiting), who was part of a party of 2 (1 of whom hadn't arrived). The service was great...  at times it was hard for me to understand the waiter... he certainly went out of his way to help us. At no time were we ever given an apology regarding the reservation and the mix-up by any of the staff. When we left the lady who had seated me was working a different station and there was a different hostess; perhaps that was part of the confusion if staff were switching or covering for each other -- still given the prices and it's location within the W Hotel -- this shouldn't have been an issue.The FoodAll of the food was good some of it great, and looked very nice on the plate. When seated at 6:30 the waiter let us know that of the two specials only 1 of each was left. With a large party already seated that made sense, but was disappointing.We started w/ Sea Bream Tartar (a generous portion): tasty, with notes of cucumber or herbs; highly recommended.Then came the charcuterie plate (five items): duck liver pate, goat and blue ewe cheeses, some smoked trout, and cured pork. It came with a bountiful amount of toast points, and accompaniments... like mustard, diced guava paste, small dried berry maybe currents and more. The pate was an ample portion served in a small glass jar. There was also a fair amount of the smoked fish. The other items (pork, and two cheeses) seemed to be esp. small portions. There certainly was plenty of food (and toast points) but I think the portions could have been 10 to 20% larger, esp. the cheeses which seemed laughably small.We ordered sharing plates: poached shrimp, lamb meatballs and deviled eggs. I am a huge fan of deviled eggs.. these were good. Well chilled and tasty.. but not particularly ""deviled."" They served 3 of them on the plate; not bad for an appetizer  -- but a) given that we were a party of 2 it seems oddly odd. That is the waiter could have easily asked the kitchen to round out the plate so it was evenly divisible. The waiter could have also informed us about the # of items on the plate. b) I also think it's a very odd # of items for a sharing plate that will always come up ""wrong"" for a table with 2 or 4 people. After our sharing plates, we ordered a smoked chicken entree which we shared along with some potato wedges. Both were tasty; I would order them again. They didn't offer to split it, nor bring fresh small plates (we used the same side plates we started with). The lamb meat balls were small and tasty and came four to the plate. I would certainly order them again. The Poached Shrimp (like the eggs) came 3 on the plate. The waiter should have told us. Unlike the other dishes however the Shrimp isn't a dish I would recommend. They were large shrimp but seemingly no different than what you might find in a typically Shrimp Cocktail. They may well have been cooked in liquid at a low temperature (poaching) but they easily could have been cooked at a slow boil and cooled in ice water. They were not over-cooked but not succulent like Thomas Keller's butter poached Lobster.For dessert we shared a strawberry short-cake made with angel food cake; no whole strawberries, small diced jam like pieces; I would not order it again.",Halifax,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Seriously stunning views.  Halifax perfectly compliments the W and reflects the vibe of the new Gold Coast.Since I am huuuuugely into ambiance, let's start there.  Gorgeous wood interiors are matched with light blues to give the dining room a casual yet sophisticated vibe that made me feel at home but better because I don't have an amazing chef and waitstaff there.  Came in around 8 a and noticed the gorgeous corner table (seats 10) was available and asked for it.  The hostess let us have it!!  Right off the bat, that's the kind of service I am talking about.  Waiters came over and descended on us like angels, pouring water, giving menus and bringing bread and popcorn.  Fun fact: the salt on the butter is extracted from salt water harvested in Montauk that the Chef makes himself!Service was impeccable.  Our waiter was so polite, asking before taking dishes away.  All the waitstaff are very professional in terms of making sure table was clean and setting up for different courses.  Ordered a bunch of different things - so I feel like I have confidence in saying every dish is created to a high standard.  Started with oysters, perfect light starter.  They were super fresh and cleaned well.  Butter lettuce salad was a bit small, but flavors were there (wouldn't order it again unless the portion is amped up).  Be aware - Crispy Vegetables app are fried.  Next, entrees which were marvelous.  Lobster rigatoni is made in house and made with love.  The sauce was buttery and packed tons of succulent porcini mushrooms and lobster chunks.  Cherrywood Smoked chicken was well worth the price - you get half a chicken!  Plus wilted greens mixed with currants and pine nuts.  Chicken was moist, while the nutty, sweet acidic bread chunks did their thing.  Any chicken lover will be pleased with this entree.Blueberry sundae with buttermilk ice cream was one of the best desserts I have had in a while.  The blueberries were plump and sweet - the ice cream was incredibly creamy, plus some corn meal cookies gave the dish a crunch.  And whatever whipped stuff was ontop was worthy of eating by itself.Try the homemade vermouth!  The chef told us the beef is prime and sourced from PA.  He has a natural passion for high quality sustainable ingredients that shines through in each dish.Chef Seadon Shouse came over and chatted, as it was a slow night.  He was here before as a chef and after a few years away has returned and called the restaurant ""his baby.""  Gosh, haven't heard that in a while.  It's evident how much he cares for his restaurant.If you are looking for a night out and the chance to take a stroll on the Hoboken side of the Hudson, come check out Halifax.  Will be coming back lots during the summer for sure.",Halifax,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

When I asked for more- the waiter gave me table bread which was rolls (which is a different bread than my dinner came with). Fine...but service overall wasn't great, maybe because it was getting late on a weekday night. The dessert was very good- chocolate torte. Overall- was an okay place.

He chooses restaurants based off of the pictures, and Halifax did not disappoint in any capacity - walking in via the street entrance, the place is stunning.We were greeted by Ruben, who ended up being our server as well, and were led to a seat by the window (ideal for people watching). More on Ruben's incredible service later, since that deserves an entire paragraph of its own. We each settled on drinks - I ordered the California Pinot Noir they had on tap ($13/glass), which was absolutely delicious. My fiance had two vodka seltzers, which he also enjoyed. Warm bread and butter was brought out, which I realize is par for the course, however this was delicious and worth noting (it may also be that I've been on a wedding diet and haven't had carbs in so long, that it's necessary to point out ""worth it"" carbs whenever possible). We started with the assorted relishes ($14) - a tomato based one, a ricotta (UNREAL), and a fall squash. I cannot sing the praises of these enough - each one was delicious, though the ricotta was a favorite (and one that were the place not so gorgeous, I'd be tempted to scrape the jar and eat it with a spoon). Ruben came by to see if we wanted more bread to finish up the various dips, but at that point, we figured it was best to save what was remaining of our appetites for dinner. I ordered the farro and quinoa ($21), which had golden beets, chard, and goat cheese. My fiance had the lobster rigatoni (full size, $29). My farro/quinoa was perfectly cooked, and was absolutely delicious. There were pieces of goat cheese that melted into the grains and was the perfect accompaniment to the beets and chard. It was healthy, vegetarian, and unique/delicious, which is not an easy combination to find. My fiance's lobster tasted incredibly fresh, and the pasta was beautifully cooked. The dessert menu looked amazing, but we were too full (from all the carbs) to even consider it. We will absolutely be back again, this time ready to go to town on the dessert options.I couldn't finish this review without giving Ruben the HIGHEST possible compliments. I can count on one hand the number of times we've experienced service of this level - he was there to check in (though not in an overbearing way), to offer more bread, to refill water glasses, and was so polite and accommodating that I don't even have enough of a vocabulary to extend compliments his way. He is an asset to Halifax, and a huge reason why we will return for future meals!This truly is a fantastic dining experience, the drinks, food, and service are exceptional, and convenient location of being in the W hotel (with views of the Hudson and NYC skyline) make it all the more special.

I called and spoke to someone the day before who seemed very professional however when we arrived there was no reservation in my name. This was on a Thursday at 4:00.The hostess was very attentive, even explained the complicated ( time limit of 2 hours & then it costs more )valet parking service. She went on to explain something about a percentage during brunch & lunch so I just stopped listening since I parked across the street.It's easier and makes more $ sense to park across the street in an independent garage. $20 for 10 hours! So, not a great start.We made our way to seating at the bar which surprisingly did not face the water. I think that was a design flaw, honestly.The staff seemed unprepared, one HH menu between three people, c'mon! Luckily, the hostess intervened and provided us with more menus. We asked for specialty drinks and the gentleman behind the bar seem to know nothing about it. We pointed to the menu and he replied ""I'm not the bartender"" I asked ""but where is the bartender? "" he's not here yet ""what time is happy hour"" 4 o'clock ""what time does the bartender get here?"" 4:30.OK now I'm scratching my head and trying not to get annoyed since it's supposed to be a happy birthday celebration. Then a very enthusiastic young woman appears and says "" I can make the specialty drinks!"" Great! So after a few questions, we order. Results took a while but drinks were wonderful. Then we sat waiting to put in a food order. The enthusiastic woman disappeared. Back to the "" I'm not the bartender guy."" We asked a few more questions about the HH offerings, put in our order and waited. And waited. Other patrons started to arrive but it was not busy at all. Finally, the food arrived! Oysters were phenomenal, deviled eggs were very plain and did not live up to the hype. Meanwhile our drinks are empty and we had to beg for service. Then Lo and behold, the ""bartender"" appeared and told us the drinks we had from the enthusiastic young women were a mistake, they are not HH drinks. By now, we were growing frustrated with what seemed to be a game we didn't know the rules to! After a bit of bickering about how we really came for dinner not drinks, & how we were misinformed by the previous server,he went to his manager. He came back with an attitude saying "" Ok, you can have one more but only one!"" Oh boy! I was flabbergasted to be spoken to in a demeaning way for something I was paying for and waiting patiently for. We got our drinks, settled down & then I noticed hot buttered popcorn in big bowls were given to several other customers. I politely asked a different server about it since it wasn't on the HH menu. He said it was complimentary. So I asked, why we didn't get any since we'd been there for 30 minutes. He returned with a tiny saucer for three people! I was not looking for a fight but felt we were invisible to this staff. The attention was given to a large group of young people, a couple with a baby, and we were just not seen for some reason!Finally, the hostess came and said your table is ready. We asked for our bill, only one round of drinks and no food was on the bill. My two friends thought they were taking it off the bill due to all the unpleasantness but I had a feeling it would be tacked on to our dinner bill. They were so happy, I was outvoted, so we didn't question it.We are seated. Who is our waiter? Yup, the ""I'm not the bartender guy."" He turns into the most attentive and cheerful waiter!Most of the review has been about the service because that was the biggest impression that I got. Now for the food. My friend loved the Amish chicken but to me,  it looked dry and she took a lot of it home. I had the cod and it lacked flavor but was a good size. My other friend ordered two side dishes the polenta which she liked and the cauliflower which she took home also.The biscuits were  delicious, hot and fresh ,we asked for more. We also asked for more popcorn! I had periodically reminded the staff that it was a birthday celebration and they did come through with a very strange peanut butter and jelly dessert but it was a big hit and the birthday girl was happy. Also, the menu has changed and the one dish I wanted is gone and so is the variety in desserts. Prices are what you would expect to pay to dine on the waterfront, quality however is lacking in both main courses and all experiences we had to suffer through at the Un-happy hour. And the HH food and drink was included in our dinner tab, as I had guessed,but my friends were celebrating thinking the establishment treated us for their wrongdoing!So we paid two separate times. Ugh!As a second chance, I may return just to have the $1 oysters and a non-specialty drink to avoid any kind of conflict at the bar and will not arrive at 4 o'clock even though that's when happy hour is supposed to start.",Halifax,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

102,c_S0EhI0ariqenLb4njIfA,Rina N.,5.0 star rating,"My first time here was at a Yelp event; the food and service proved a second visit (and I'm sure for many more)! I am glad I returned because this time around I had brunch (one of my favorite meals). My boyfriend and I came here for Saturday brunch; it was beautiful outside so it was perfect that they have outdoor seating. We went inside, greeted, seated and provided water immediately. The brunch menu at first is a little confusing, as you have to read the fine print on the bottom that all the items are al la carte for $6, or $29 per person for unlimited small plates with champagne. We weren't planning to eat a whole lot, so we just picked a few plates. The Shrimp Roll, Farro Salad and Chicken & Waffle. These are small plates, so we figured we would order as we go. Our server's name is Giovani, (think I recall him from the Yelp event as well) and he took our orders. He was great at answering questions as I was confused about the menu selection and how it all worked, but he was very attentive to what we wanted. The food came out within 10-15 minutes, so I was pleasantly surprised as we were eager to try their brunch! Giovani was assisted by another server, and they were carrying more plates than we ordered! In addition to what we ordered, they came out with beef sliders, Croque Monsieur, and BLT sliders! It all came out in a pair, so we were able to try one of each. This was a very generous offer as they wanted us to try their food - Giovani assured we would only pay for the plates we ordered. We got to try probably a third of their menu for a very affordable price, so thank you, Halifax! We ended up ordering another beef slider and tried the French Toast with maple cream (so good!!)My favorites in order (all of them were very good): Beef sliders (so so juicy, the meat to bun ratio is perfect), croque Monsieur, chicken & waffle, French Toast, farro salad, shrimp roll (fresh!), BLT sliders. We will definitely be getting the champagne special next time, as we clearly finished all 7 plates no problem. If Giovani and staff didn't come out with those additional items we wouldn't have known how good they were. Great service and food here, we're looking forward to returning!",Halifax,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

The cocktail menu was inventive and creative.Appetizer: we split the mussels which were DELICIOUS. Mussels were fresh, and extremely large, cooked in a delicious slightly-thick (in a good way) broth. Served with grilled bread on the side. The portion is EXTREMELY generous, and would have been plenty for a main dish.Main Dishes: My friend ordered the Maine Blue Cod and I ordered the Seafood Stew. I did not try the cod but my friend finished every bite on his plate so it must have been good! The stew was once again delicious- including shrimp, clams, scallops, mussels, squid etc. in a spicy tomato sauce. Unfortunately I could only eat about 1/3 of the dish because I was SO FULL from our appetizer, but if I could grow a second stomach I would have licked the bowl.Our waitress was extremely friendly and offered up menu suggestions that proved to be delicious. We were on the fence about ordering a side dish to split but she convinced us that what we ordered would be plenty of food. I really appreciate not being up-sold on things I don't need.The only reason for 4 stars is that there was a bit of a wait from start to finish. (We sat at 8 and did not leave until 10:30).

The restaurant was absolutely gorgeous and it ended up being a nice night, but not without a few bumps. First and foremost, our waiter looked incredibly bored and did NOT want to be there. My SO wasn't able to taste the wine before he ordered (the waiter never came back with a sample) and our apps came out before our wine did. We were waiting for the waiter to come back to put in our main course before we finished our apps, but he never did. Eventually we asked other waiters for help, which we received 10x better than our original guy. The food was OK. It was good, but not great. The starter of shrimp/cod fritters and the assorted dips were delicious! My SO ordered the lobster rigatoni while I had the chicken. The pasta was delicious and lobster fresh, but my chicken was REALLY DRY. Almost like sand. I needed an entire glass of water to choke it down. I had panna cotta for dessert and it was lovely. The ambiance made up for what the food lacked - it was really romantic and private and we'd go back, perhaps for lunch.",Halifax,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

However, I come to find out that they do not have a record of my reservation once I arrive there?!? It ended up not being a huge deal because there were ample tables outside, but I do not have patience for incompetence (sorry for not being sorry).FYI you can book a reservation on OpenTable.

We walk in and said we had reservations for 8:30, and they told us that they were backed up from the ""first seating"" (there was no first seating it was just a mess) and we had to wait a couple minutes. Unfortunately that ended up being a half hour. Someone sitting at the high top next to us left angrily because nobody even asked if he wanted a drink. The manager saw that he left and sent someone over to us and we ordered drinks but never saw them. After telling the hostess we were going to leave, we finally got a table. The waitress came over and got us drinks in 5 minutes, and right after she brought us our drinks, the first waitress brought us the drinks we ordered 20 minutes before. We told her we already got drinks and weren't going to drink them, and she walked away with a sour face. We got our first appetizer before bread, had to ask for bread, and then had to wait 20 minutes before each meal. Each table around us was waiting a while too. Looking around, I saw waiters joking around, taking breaks, and overall neglecting the tables. Our reservations were for 8:30 and we didn't get to leave the restaurant before 11:30. It was a mess and a horrible choice for Valentine's Day. Speaking of, they passed out roses to certain tables and not others. Also, our waitress was barely present but got away with an included tip of 36 dollars which was completely unfair and undeserved. The included tip was probably why nobody was doing any work.

We enjoyed the food (I might still be full), but overall, the experience was very uneven.First, on the good side. The space is absolutely gorgeous - it's modern, with lovely tones, and tons of natural light. My coat kept falling off the back of the chair, but that's a minor quibble. In addition, the actual food for the brunch was excellent. It's tasting menu-style, so they bring out a taste of everything, and you're allowed to order an unlimited amount of anything you like. Some particular highlights were the poached egg with cheddar grits, the French toast with maple cream, and the BLT cheese puffs. Overall, the food was excellent, and the mixers provided for the bubbles were top-notch.However, the service for the brunch is absolutely abysmal. It was some of the worst service I've experienced in a restaurant recently, and it cost them a full 2 stars. It took over 10 minutes to get our server's attention once our whole party was seated. After that, it took at least another 30-40 minutes to get our first plates of food, which is more than a little frustrating since the Bubbles Brunch has a 2-hour time limit. One of our friends ordered a cup of coffee that was flat-out never delivered. One of the plates - the beef sliders - came out cold, and when we pointed this out it was not replaced. Once it was time for us to leave, it took almost an hour for us to ask for the check (which we had to do twice), get it delivered, and then pay.I understand that their brunch concept can be hard to manage, especially with such a large space, but this shouldn't be an excuse.

Regardless of whether or not your waiter comes the brunch still ends after 2 hours...Luckily our server, Hector, was so great!

The food comes out as it's prepared and you get to try everything in the menu in little plate forms and then you can ask more of one thing afterwards. Definitely a spot for anyone who is not a picky eater!! You get to try new things you may not have picked originally so it was great! I will most definitely be coming back!

We ordered fruit and yogurt for the toddler and I was surprised it took so long to bring out. We ended up getting to try each item on the menu and most of the food was very good! Down side is that service was not organized and it food came out of kitchen sporadically. We went 15-20 minutes at a time with no food. We didn't end of leaving until 2:30. We were told Kitchen was backed up and by the end of our meal, we were given so much food at once it was hard to taste each item.

It was RICE with a whole soft shell crab  cut in half and placed on the dish. The shrimp and squid were non existent. Then my husband's gnocchi came out. It was burnt and oily.

Since I don't drink alcohol, we opted for the Bubbles Brunch without champagne which is about $5/pp less expensive. The Bubbles Brunch is unlimited for 2 hours, and they serve the menu items (excluding the raw bar) in 3 stages (approx. 8-10 items per round). The items include such offerings as a yogurt berry parfait, fruit salad, shrimp cerviche, ferro salad, sliders, chicken & waffles, potatoes/mushrooms, etc. Each item is served in tapas size servings based on the number of people in your party. Once you have completed eating one round, they bring the next one. You can also order any of the items you are served again if you really like it. Overall, the food is very good, although there are not as many items as I would have liked for a pescetarian like me. The reason for the 3 stars is the service is lackluster & weak at best. The waiters are not high end, not friendly or personable at all, and literally just put down the food & walk away. It is hard to get their attention when you need a refill or some other item.

Unfortunately, the manager present spent most of the night talking to the only two people at the bar, he never passed our table once. We know this was not only our experience as another table was threatening to leave due to lack of service when we were on our way out.

The hostess tells me they have my table of 10 and I said it should be for 16. We go back and forth and she hands the phone to the manager. He continues to tell me that it's for 10 and he can only split us up if we want to fit all 16.  I was trying to be accommodating and say we are willing to wait to add another table, but he did not want to do this for us.  After calling 4x and having issues every single time, I decided that we were to go somewhere else and that their food was not worth the hassle they put me through. Once we were at a different restaurant and already settled down, I get a call from the manager and he told me he made a mistake and had me under two different names so they actually DID have a table for 16. I said to him that we were already settled somewhere else and that was not my mistake, but theirs- and he hung up on me.  All in all, they had me under two different names (one misspelled completely) with the same phone number and didn't put two and two together.  I hope one day they get their front of the house in check because I'm sure their food could be great.",Halifax,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

The deal Halifax offers is great: for $29 you get unlimited brunch and a bottle of champagne (or $21 if you don't want champagne). The twist Halifax offers is that instead of serving big entree dishes, they do small plates instead. You can order as many as you want of whatever is on the menu. The options are vast and mostly yummy. I really enjoyed the seafood ceviche, the chicken wings and waffles, the sliders, the smoked salmon, the french toast and a few others. There's enough different choices that it should make everyone happy. What really puts it together is the environment. You're in a large opening dining room with floor to ceiling windows that give a refreshing natural light and view as you sit near the Hudson River.But just be studious in your preparation.

No discount given.)We were really looking forward to trying this place after hearing great things about their brunch, so we decided to head over for dinner last night (Saturday). Perhaps we came on an off night - but we had an unfortunate service experience.We had made a reservation for 8:30 but arrived about 20 minutes early to see if we could snag a table before then. When we walked in we noticed several (as in, a dozen or so) open tables and asked for a table for 2. The hostess told us they were booked solid for the evening. We let her know we were very early but had a reservation at 8:30 and she instantly sat us at one of the 8 open tables outside.  At the beginning, service was fairly prompt and we placed our orders (apps and entrees) by 8:20. We received our apps by about 8:45, one of which was the steamed mussels which were already cold when we received them, but we did not feel it was worth mentioning. After we finished apps we watched as the tables near us were finished and checked out. Soon we were one of only maybe 3 tables outside and inside had cleared out significantly. We sat mostly unattended until 9:35 when the hostess finally came over and asked if we needed our check. I let her know we had not yet received our entrees and she seemed genuinely concerned/confused as she had seated us an hour and a half prior. She and our waiter spoke and then checked with the kitchen, and came back to say the kitchen was very busy which was why our food had taken so long. We were a little surprised given we had watched the restaurant steadily becoming more empty, but decided to wait anyway. Our food finally came around 9:45. To their credit, our food was very tasty and our entrees at least were slightly warmer than our appetizers.When we finally got the check around 10:15 or so, our waiter did not offer anything discount off the menu (nor did we ask) but we did notice that we were charged extra for a drink that did not even appear on their drink menu. We brought it to their attention and they changed it (without apology.)We recognize that if there was kitchen back up, it certainly would not have been the fault of our waiter. However, if that had been the case it would have been appreciated if we had notice of that. Still, looking at all the other tables coming in, receiving their meals, and getting checked out all before we received our entrees made it a little hard to believe it was simply kitchen backup rather than an error in adding our orders or simply forgetting to make our plates. If that was the case, we would have been willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and returned with optimism had they been honest about it or offered some sort of courtesy discount or a free drink, anything. Sadly this was not the case, and so we're likely to take our business elsewhere and warn our fellow Hobokians to use their time and $$$$ more wisely than we did.",Halifax,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Our favorites were the risotto balls, the sliders, and the ham and cheese sandwiches. Lovely spot as well inside the W and very reasonably priced. They served our little cake we brought for us and we're very nice. Will be back again!",Halifax,3.5 star rating,$$$,"Seafood,, American, (Traditional),, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
