Take this review as someone who may have been looking for some sweet sweet broth to regain that brain strength. Pho with meatballs meets my criteria of decent pho at a decent price. It's not super memorable but this place is great for an emergency pho meal. The summer roll with shrimp is also delicious where the shrimp and veggies tastes super fresh. I love leaving the best for last so on to the banh mi: outstanding. The baguette along with the flavors from the sauce they use really is what makes a banh mi. I wish I can replace every sandwich place with banh mi.

Not bad.  Just okay.Spring rolls are spot on, only to be improved by an amazing dipping sauce.Pho is okay -nothing to write home about.  A bit light and under-seasoned, which suggests the broth may be watered down and/or needs additional bone and spice simmering.Bánh mìs taste great, but suffer from a light hand.  They contain, literally, 3 slices of whatever meat you've ordered in each.  Nothing sucks more than leaving a restaurant still hungry.",Pho Nomenon Noodle & Grill,3.0 star rating,$,"Vietnamese,, Noodles"

What I was expecting was my go to for a hangover cure - a steaming hot bowl of pho, and it did the trick. The broth could have been hotter but overall, I was pretty happy with my decision to try this place out. My boyfriend and I came around 3 pm on a Saturday and there weren't many people dining - probably because it was a weird hour, and it was also the Saturday before Halloween so people were probably busy prepping for their parties that night. We also tried the banh mi, which was okay.

I called in to ask for a replacement/refund but they refused because ""they can't resell it"" Great business model. I was then told that I was the one who ordered incorrectly, and that the dish is a ""stir fry."" Since when did Vietnamese vermicelli dishes have Chinese stir fry on it? I just wanted some extra lettuce and bean sprouts. She then proceeded to tell me to ""just take the vegetables off"" and was unwilling to compromise.

(4:28pm on a Sunday, so to be expected.) We were able to enjoy quiet conversation and bottomless (on the house) Jasmine tea, which was super delicious and of the optimal temperature.  Seriously, do you have a thermometer back there?  It was just hot enough to be considered hot but just cool enough to sip easy with no required wait time.  I highly recommend you keep that coming as frequently as possible.In addition to Pho, we both got a Bánh mì, one chicken, one beef.  Despite our very pronounced hunger, we killed the pho but both brought home more than half our sandwiches.  The pinnacle of any Bánh mì (the bread) was very crunchy, not flaky, and overall A+.Big portions, small prices, delicious pho, huge sandwiches - all for less than $30.  Plus they deliver.  Will we be back?  Pho sho....Terrible, predictable pun count: 1",Pho Nomenon Noodle & Grill,3.0 star rating,$,"Vietnamese,, Noodles"

The pho I thought was average - it was good, but I've also had better. Granted it's the only pho place I know of in Hoboken. I was very pleasantly surprised by their Asian Spicy Chicken with mixed vegetables, though. It was very well cooked and super tasty. The texture of the chicken was very tender and the veggies had a nice crunch to them rather than being mushy and unappetizing. I really enjoyed that dish - it was similar to something you'd get at a Chinese restaurant, but cooked way better than most places. On point.One thing I was pretty disappointed about was their Vietnamese spring rolls. They have a very strange texture - the wrap is sort of thick and chewy/doughy rather than thin and crisp. I was not a fan.The service is good here. They're fast and efficient, getting your food to you quickly. They're friendly and pretty attentive to your needs. No nonsense. Although, I think the kid serving us may have forgotten about our spring rolls at first... Other than that though, pretty good.Pleasant, casual, moderately quiet.

The menu looks great and covers all the basics from Pho to Bun dishes to Bahn Mi.  Will R.  started by ordering the iced coffee.  It arrived immediately and started the trend of disappointment.  This is what we get for diverting from our usual Vietnamese place.  The iced coffee was ridiculously weak (so much for expresso!).  For his entree, Will ordered the bun with beef and egg rolls.  When it arrived, we found out the beef was more like stir fried beef with peppers instead of grilled beef.  The dish also arrived without the usual sauce.  I, in the meantime, had gotten my bahn mi and while the filling was good, the bread was not.  Instead of a baguette this was a rather dense, flavorless, heavy bread that just takes away from the filling.We barely touched our food and left soon after.  The place did fill up rather quickly with lots of Asian people which usually would give me confidence about the food.  I understand that many people in Hoboken don't have cars and so getting to other parts of New Jersey may not be convenient but for us, we would rather travel 10-15 mins for good food than to eat mediocre food.",Pho Nomenon Noodle & Grill,3.0 star rating,$,"Vietnamese,, Noodles"

But considering the absence of *good* Asian restaurants in Hoboken (no *real* Chinese restaurants, one pseudo-Korean place that isn't that good, and a bunch of mediocre Japanese sushi restaurants), Pho Nomenon deserves at least an extra star! I've been wanting to eat here for a while now but had been turned off by some of the mediocre reviews but I wish I gave them a chance sooner, especially during the winter months where that hot bowl of pho would have made the long winter pass a little faster.I got a bowl of pho and the wife got some bun. The pho was really good. Meat was a little overcooked -- at most Vietnamese places I've been to, the meat is pretty raw and they put it on the soup right before they serve it and let the heat from the soup cook it. Maybe they thought Hoboken couldn't handle that.The bun was also very good. Probably not as good as the pho but pretty good. I definitely plan on coming back here.

Also, if you go with someone who is a picky eater, you will have a little bit of an issue. I went with a few and all of them take ages to order and then just eventually order a sandwich.

When I learned that Hoboken was getting its first Pho restaurant I was skeptical. The first visit back in January was a tad bit disappointing. The meat was overcooked and there was no nuc mam cham (common viet dipping sauce made of fish sauce, chili, sugar and water) for my friend's bun cha. When I asked if they served nuoc mam cham, they looked at me as if I had asked for some foreign substance. No nuoc mam cham in a Viet place? That's like not offering ketchup at a hamburger joint. Sacrilege! Even so, I nominally enjoyed my Pho and it took care of my fix, so I chalked up the place as somewhere to go when I couldn't get home to my mom's home cooking. I am not sure if they wised up and hired a new cook, but my recent visit definitely improved my opinion of the place. The Pho had much more flavor. What really recently sold me on the place was when I placed a delivery order. Now normally I wouldn't think to order Pho to go since you can never predict asian soup dishes will arrive. My assumption was that it would come all mixed in some tupperware and the noodles would be soggy and the meat overcooked. I was extremely happy and pleased to see that, not only did they separate the noodles and broth into their own containers, but that the beef came raw. I was ecstatic that I could prepare Pho the way it's supposed to be made - with the noodles being laid down into the bowl first, then the raw meat layered and the hot broth poured over the meat to bring it to a medium pink state.

I crave it so often I have had to drive to Jersey City to get some... so it's about time it came to Hoboken! Last night, my husband and I were walking on Washington street and stumbled on Pho Nomenon so we knew we had to try it. We shared the Potstickers (meat) and they were excellent. Very fresh and a great flavor. I think they were chicken and lemongrass. They were the perfect potsticker: Crispy on one side and perfectly steamed on the other. The sauce was a little too salty, and I think it may have just been soy sauce. My husband got Crispy Chicken in Tamarind Sauce and he was very happy with it. The tamarind sauce is pretty close to a thai chili sauce and it wasn't swimming in sauce nor did it taste overly oily. They serve it on a bed of lettuce and tomato which he really appreciated. It also came with a side of rice.I got the pho ga and it was really tasty. What I especially liked about it was that it was not just chicken and noodles, there was baby bok choy and lots of types of onions as well (and of course the beansprouts, lime, and thai basil). The broth was very tasty and the serving is GIANT for only $8. The chicken is steamed so overall it feels light, healthy, and comforting.We also tried some drinks: Jasmine Bubble Tea and Thai Iced tea. The Jasmine tea was way too floral for my taste and they make it with condensed milk so it's heavy. My husband was happy with his Thai iced tea.

Some of the dishes are a little non-traditional, so it's not mom's cooking, but overall I like the food. If I had a complaint, it would be for the take-out / delivery service. The girl who answers the phone can be a bit curt, especially if you have questions or want extra condiments. However the sit-down service is usually wonderful unless the place is full, in which case it can be very slow. I blame this on the ramping up period that all new restaurants go through and expect it will get better over time. The servers are very nice. As for food, my favorite would be the Hanoi Grilled Pork on Rice Vermicelli. If you're getting take-out / delivery and grew up on spicy Vietnamese food like I did, then make sure you ask them to include Sriracha and hope they include it, or you'll end up with some really bland fish sauce. I do like their twist on summer rolls, too. The sandwiches are decent but they go really heavy on the mayonnaise, so make sure you ask them to go light if that's off-putting to you. Prices are very reasonable. The only other complaint I have is that it can be dauntingly quiet. They need to pump up the music a bit so that you don't have to whisper to the person across from you. Other than that, it's a good place to get good food and I've had an overall good experience with them. I'll order from there maybe twice a month.",Pho Nomenon Noodle & Grill,3.0 star rating,$,"Vietnamese,, Noodles"
207,snldUmF4v4BePq542uAGQw,shannon m.,1.0 star rating,"I had a similar experience to Desiree D. I've eaten A LOT of pho in SF bay area (and recently in Chinatown NYC), all vegetarian. I've never had a problem ordering a vegetarian version, but when I called to order take out from this place, they seemed extremely confused, then delivered subpar service and food. The manager had to get on the phone to explain  ""Pho is a beef broth based soup, OK. It is not vegetarian."" (Yes, thanks, I'm well aware of this, and it's why I'm asking for your vegetarian take on pho.)They explained they have a ""special clear broth vegetarian soup"" that you can order with noodles on the side and pay extra. Fine, but really? Pay extra? Not a nice way to treat your vegetarian customers who arguably could be your most loyal - you're the first pho shop in Hoboken - corner the market. Do it right. My vegetarian soup cost 10.95 + 2.00 for the noodles. This DID NOT include the typical side basil, bean sprouts, jalapeno and lime - in fact, it's not even offered to vegetarians.After I received my order, I took a look at the pricing on the rest of the menu (their menu is not available online anywhere yet, so I was not able to compare before ordering). A beef broth based soup on their menu costs anywhere from 6.95 to 8.95, includes noodles and the side plate of spouts, basil, jalapeno, etc. Good, reasonable pricing. This means there's almost a $6 premium for a vegetarian ""pho"" type soup - and you can't even call it that. In addition, the soup was bland, and the noodles had an off taste. The only thing it had going for it was the baby bok choy. What vegetarian could hate on baby bok choy? Not this one. Bottom line: Huge missed opportunity here. They should make it simple to order a  reasonably priced (!!) vegetarian pho with all the fixin's - I've never been to a place that has made it so complicated and therefore unwelcoming as a customer.",Pho Nomenon Noodle & Grill,3.0 star rating,$,"Vietnamese,, Noodles"

But I have to say, this was absolutely delightful.  The woman that took my order on the phone was extremely kind and helpful (and English speaking for the nerds that care about that), the menu selection is fab, and the gentleman that delivered my food was very kind and professional.  Not to mention the fact they quoted a 45 minute wait on a VERY SNOWY night, and our food arrived in about 20 minutes.  I might order it again tonight.  For those interested we had Pho 1 and Pho 7 and Summer rolls with grilled pork.  Outstanding.",Pho Nomenon Noodle & Grill,3.0 star rating,$,"Vietnamese,, Noodles"
