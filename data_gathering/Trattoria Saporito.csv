The lemon sauce for the tilapia was sublime and complemented the very fresh vegetables --- we saw their vegetables delivered from the street and they were certainly super fresh and attractive.  For dessert, the homemade tiramisu went superbly with the coffee; the cake in the creamy tiramisu was delicately flavored by coffee and expresso.BYOB, so next time we'll bring wine.",Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

It deserved the review it deserved. Wow wow wow ! Crabmeat pasta had to be one of my top 10 best dishes I've ever had ( and I'm a foodie ). We started w a little hot antipasto. Ohhh before I forget BYOB. Then dinner was just cooked perfect. We shared a crabmeat pasta and a veal martini. Finished off w a tartuffo and coffee. By that time we were stuffed !  Amazing place, amazing staff and beautiful Italian music in back.",Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian
3,i6D86VmqTgjqScAZWsXBLQ,Binita S.,5.0 star rating,This is turning into my favorite Italian spot in Hoboken . Been here twice and have experienced excellent service each time. It's a BYOB spot and lots of places near by where you can pick up a bottle .Service it's fast and excellent . The wait staff are very accommodating and friendly . The last two times I have been here I have always gotten the penne all'arrabbiata - it's a penne pasta with spicy chili pepper and red sauce . If you love the heat this is the dish for you . I always ask for some extra crushed red pepper on the side . It's a good portion size and has always been very well cooked .One dessert I don't leave here without eating is the tiramisu. The tiramisu is very rich creamy and decadent . If you come here you have to try the tiramisu . Save room for dessert :),Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian
4,EmgLtg3eqdauqi8ePZLf5A,Yuting Z.,4.0 star rating,"Good red-sauce BYO place located in downtown Hoboken. I've come here twice for dinner, and everything we ordered has been solid. Calamari starter is fantastic - lightly fried, tender squid, and an amazing garlicky marinara on the side that I'm still dreaming about. For mains, I've had the squid ink pasta with vodka sauce and lump crab (delicious and abundant crab, but I found the vodka sauce to be too sweet) as well as the gargenelli ala garibaldi, which was delicious. Also had a bite of my friend's linguine con vongole, which immediately made me regret my order. Entrees are on the pricier side, but the portions are huge. For dessert, get the tiramisu, which made even me (a self-proclaimed tiramisu hater) a little bit of a convert.The restaurant was bustling on a late Sunday night, and we counted 2-3 birthday celebrations. Everyone seemed to be on friendly terms with the GM, which means this place has attracted a lot of regulars. I see some reviews complaining about service, but I found it to be perfectly friendly and attentive.Tip is automatically added onto your bill (even for a party of 2), so just be cognizant of that.",Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

The red sauce was likewise meh- the cheese was supposed to be fresh mozzarella, but I barely could tell any difference. Was it overcooked? Perhaps.  It also took forever for our food to come out so I was expecting it to be amazing. I was wrong. There weren't even that many patrons either! It had a very homey.

When the waiter came over he read us the specials, we were immediately hooked and each ordered one of the evening's specials. The waiter mentioned to us, ""the specials might be a TAD over the price of the normal prices"" and we did not think much of it as every meal on the menu was approx $15-20. I ordered a mushroom truffle pasta and my mom ordered a seared scallop pasta. All was going well until the meals arrived:-The scallops were NOT seared, as any foodie knows scallops have a slight tar to their faces as any SEARED meal does, these looked as though they were boiled- We mentioned it to the waiter, next thing we know the manager is at our table preaching about the proper cooking of searing of scallops, but as he walked away he rolled his eyes at the other waiter and made both my mother and myself very uncomfortable- We did not argue further as we wanted to just enjoy our meal, half way through our meal my mom saw that there were only 3, yes THREE scallops in her dish. WHAT?!- We ate what we could and asked for our receipt; $88 for 2 meals and one slice of cake.This means that my meal was $40 and my moms was $35. This is NOT a TAD higher than average prices, this is SUBSTANTIALLY higher than normal prices. And to be charge $35 for a pasta dish with THREE scallops- we've both traveled around Italy and were extremely shocked and disappointed that we had picked a place that was such a rip-off, of all the nice places in Hoboken.All in all, please take our word and approach this place with caution, they will take advantage of your well-mannered behavior and you will end up feeling screwed rather than full.",Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

We do enjoy Cafe Michaelina but on Friday night the line was out the door and no hostess or staff in sight. Instead of waiting aimlessly for someone to appear I suggested walking up one block to try Trattoria. From the moment we walked up to the front door the service was impeccable! Greeted immediately by the manager. Mind you we were just two hungry kids with a bottle of wine looking for a BYOB spot. Did not expect the whole intimate and romantic ambiance but hey it worked out. Our server came to the table with a plate showcasing all the different pasta options and daily specials. Just be aware the specials are insanely overpriced and where they get you. Our dishes were specials at $35 each. We were just unaware that a special menu item would be $15 more than a regular dish.I opted for the seafood black linguine special with white wine and garlic sauce. This is hands down my favorite black linguine dish I've tried yet. My boyfriend got the cavatelli vodka sauce, if you like vodka sauce with a nice kick to it try this. The food is really good and portions are decent but price point per plate kind of hurts. If you stick to the regular menu items are around $17-$25.",Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

Then the waiter came by with a platter of about 10 types of uncooked pasta. He described each one to us and told us a special that was served with each. I got the angel hair with lump crab and vodka sauce and it was amazing. At the end they brought the birthday girl a piece of chocolate mouse cake. They included 20% tip on our check and it came to a little over $360 for 7 people. That was about $50 per person (or $60 since the birthday girl didn't pay).

However, they didn't tell us it would cost the equivalent of a special.  They charged us about $35.00 for the veal instead of chicken.  Why?  I understand that veal is more, veal parm and veal marsala use equivalent amounts of veal; why the huge difference in price?  We only had these 4 dinners and one calamari appetizer and our bill was $180, including tip.  For a BYOB!  The food is good, but always check the bill. **Also, sometimes they add a tip, (watch for that), which is only a recommended amount in NJ, even when a restaurant posts that parties over 6 will have an added tip.  Remember, that is only a suggested tip, you are under no obligation to agree with that amount!",Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

Portions are pretty big so definitely plenty to share if you're getting appetizers as well.They start you off with complimentary bread and bruschetta, so if you don't have a big appetite you may not need to order an app. We started with a special appetizer of buffala mozzarella and tomatoes with prosciutto and spinach - big and amazingggg. Next I got the cheese ravioli with vodka sauce (it didn't come that way on the menu but I asked and they easily made that combination for me!). It was pretty good, but I have to say my friend's Tortellini Della Nonna was outstanding in comparison - he got both meat and cheese tortellini with mushrooms in a truffle cream sauce with mushrooms. It was by far the best dish at our table, and I highly recommend any of their tortellini dishes. My boyfriend also really loved his zuppa di pesce with black and white linguini.

I had honestly never been a huge fan, but I figured I would give it another shot. I have been here on a weekend night and the wait seemed like forever, so I was happy to show up to an empty restaurant for lunch. They do a business lunch for $16.99 that includes one app and one entree per person. I was super confused, because they gave us a dinner menu too, but then told us that we couldn't order from that menu. Huh?! The menu is decent, a ton of pastas, a few meat options on one fish entree (tilapia). I ended up ordering an eggplant appetizer and their chicken Marsala. The eggplant was okay, I paired it with some marinara sauce and thought it tasted much better. It was 3 pieces of eggplant lightly dashed with olive oil and some cheese. Decent. The chicken Marsala was pretty good. It came with one piece of chicken, some mushrooms and either pasta or vegetables. I had it with the vegetables. Generic vegetables that often accompany chicken dishes at an Italian restaurant. My buddy ended up ordering calamari, it was pretty typical of calamari, the sauce was better than what I had remembered. He also ordered the risotto which came with shrimps and clams. I've gotta say, for the amount he raved about it, I thought it was a big disappointing. It was kind of bland, I expected better. Overall the food was average, exactly what I had remembered. Basic, average, generic Italian food. Nothing out of the ordinary, so as a foodie, I'm giving it two stars. I generally lean more towards Jersey City over Hoboken when I want a good meal.

I ordered a pasta dish with tomato sauce and fried eggplant. The pasta tasted fresh and absorbed the sauce. Eggplant was tasty. I wouldn't order again mostly based on the fact there are many other dishes to try. We ordered chocolate gelato, ricotta cheesecake, and tiramisu for dessert. Gelato was by far the be at however we took the tiramisu to go and have yet to taste. 5 stars for food, 3 stars for service.

Seriously. There were probably 4 different appetizer specials, 8 pasta special - each of which he showed us on a plate the type of fresh pasta that would be used with detailed descriptions on the sauces and meats, and another 4 or so meat / fish dishes. Just to memorize all of these specials on any given night, these people are probably the smartest waiters in Hoboken.The meal is started with some fresh out of the oven bread, and some very tasty, on the house, bruschetta. Excellent start to the meal twice. We started with the fried calamari. It was good, but nothing mind blowing. The tomato sauce it comes with is thick and chunky and probably was made in house earlier in the day. For our mains, we both had specials. The lady had a chicken dish with mozzarella, prosciutto, basil, and asparagus in a white wine sauce, accompanied with a side of your choice, (linguini in tomato sauce in this case). The chicken was tender and tasty, but the pasta was just ok. I had the veal osso buco which came with what they called ""seasoned rice,"" but was actually more of a delicious risotto than a rice. The veal was super tender, and absolutely fell off of the bone with just the tiniest of shakes. Now... what ever you do, do not throw away that bone! It came with a small fork for you to scoop out all of that delicious bone marrow and throw it in the crusty heel of the bread. The ""rice"" and a creamy and delicious risotto.Portions here are generous... we ended up taking home half of each entree.Couple of things to be aware of, or beware of here... 1) While this place is still BYOB, they now have offer wines in house... this worries me that the BYOB might disappear.2) They automatically add in a 20% gratuity onto the bill. Now... our server was great, and I would have tipped about this much, so in this case, I was ok with it, but the table next to us complained of missing an ordered side dish, so if I was them, I would be more than annoyed at an automatic 20%. 3) Ask how much the specials are... I did not, and my veal osso buco was $40... $40 dollars! Given that everything on the menu was about $20 or under, I was shocked that this dish was twice as much. I think this quite possibly might be the single most expensive dish anywhere in Hoboken.Overall, the service here is very attentive and friendly, and the food is flavorful with generous portions. The drawback here is that it is expensive for Italian food, and expensive for Hoboken. The total bill for 1 app and 2 special dishes, plus tax and the automatic tip came out to $100. That's high for Hoboken. That being said, the mammoth list of specials and good dishes, and BYOB were enough to impressive me and make me want to come back.

I finally had the chance to this Valentine's day and it was a really nice experience. I'm not sure if on a normal day they take reservations, but they didn't for Valentine's day (which ended up working out fine!). We only had to wait 25 minutes on one of the busiest days of the year so we weren't upset at all.Since there isn't any room to wait inside, they agreed to call us when the table was ready so we got to walk around the streets of Hoboken for a bit which was nice (but probably wouldn't be too fun on a rainy night.)Once we were sat, we were quickly greeted and our wine was opened and chilled. Our food was brought out in a timely fashion and was delicious! I got the penne vodka with chicken and he got the spaghetti alla carbonara. The portions were very generous so we both took home leftovers.Overall, we really enjoyed our experience and will certainly be heading back!",Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

Second only to Augustinos, it is a fresh helping of good ol' Hoboken Italian cuisine.It's a bit on the pricey side, so be warned. Be prepared to bust out your wallet - can't have any moths flying out on your night out here. However, their pastas are top notch quality. There won't be any question about whether you'll be satisfied coming here or not.I've been here multiple times. I've always stuck to the pastas so I cannot critique anything else. They love to dazzle you with their specials for the night - be ready to take a couple notes, there are nights where there are many. Anyway, the pastas are excellent. I'm a big fan of the meat lasagna, meat raviolis (meat sauce is to die for!). The rigatoni al cuoco is also very zesty. I tend to stick to the  Bresaola for the appetizer. There are selections of fish, veal, poultry, etcetera on the menu - stuff you would typically expect from an Italian restaurant. The times I've been here, I haven't had complaints about whatever my partner would be having (typically the poultry).The deserts are a little meh. Main reason I zinged the place a star, besides the fact that it's still #2 to Augustinos. It's BYOB. The waiters are very attentive in all my experiences here. Knowledgable too.

The first time I went, myself and my entire party (4 of us total) got food poisoning, assumedly from the calamari. Things happen, of course, so I hadn't quite written it off yet. The second time that I went, I purchased a Groupon deal. The fine print stated that Groupon patrons needed a reservation to use the deal, so we obediently called to make our reservation, at which point the hostess informed us that they DID NOT EVER accept reservations, and specifically said that Groupon holders were first-come, first-serve each night. We finally arrived to a near-empty restaurant and sat down, informing who we believe was the owner that we had a Groupon deal to use. He asked if we had a reservation, and, a little taken aback, we explained that we did not. He said ""no reservation, no Groupon."" We further elaborated that we had tried to make a reservation and explained that we were told that they did not accept reservations; he said that he had ""been there all day,"" and there was ""no way"" that she would have told us that. He went on to call us liars, despite the fact that we all were remarkably patient and polite to him, and was unapologetic about both the situation and his own atrocious behavior. We left and went to Pita Grill next door (which was wonderful). I will never return to this place.

For dessert we had tiramisu, limoncello cake, and pistachio gelato. The limoncello cake was definitely the best of the desserts. I felt like I have made better tiramisu and the gelato tasted like Turkey hill ice cream and did not have a real pistachio flavor. I was not happy with the service. It was hard to.understand the manager when he was telling the specials because of his thick Italian accent.

They have specific timeslots/tables to seat Groupon users and they were all booked for three of the weekends I tried, so I would recommend calling a week in advance if you also bought a Groupon. Got the calamari for appetizer, which was very good. Tender pieces, not overly oily, marinara was alright. For mains, we got the veal parmigiana and the Fusilli Cacciatore. Like others have said, portions were huge but taste/quality was standard (same w dessert). At their normal prices I would have felt extremely ripped off. The best part of dinner was the complimentary bruschetta - aahmaazing. Overall the food was alright (3.5) so why the one star?The service/front of house SUCKS. No one acknowledged us or the couples behind us when we entered, and the place really isn't big enough to have people loitering around for even a few minutes. There's a lot of staff but everyone is disorganized, and no one seems to know what the other guy's doing/did.  Thus service is wildly inconsistent - we waited twenty minutes for someone to come take our order but after our appetizers came out, the service became so 'attentive' that a waiter took my plate and other utensils away as I was still forking up the last bite. Wtf? The inexcusable part happened at the end though. When the bill came, the waiter explained I had to pay in cash because of my Groupon - otherwise they wouldn't be able to charge me the necessary gratuity. So not only did they try to add arbitrary rules to the Groupon use, they ended up forcing a 15% gratuity on our party of two. I ended up arguing to use my credit card, and told them I always tip on the original bill so not to worry (usually at LEAST 20% - food coupons make me feel extra generous about the tip). The waiter hesitated, said OK, left to confer w someone outside the restaurant (again wtf?), then an inordinately long amount of time later finally came back with the check. He must not have trusted me at all and spent all that time manually entering numbers into the cc billed amount because guess what, the total was still with the 15% gratuity! Real classy!As a side note, the table beside us, regular non Groupon customers, looked less than satisfied with the service as well. They noted something off about the items on their bill after the cc was swiped, and the waiter took it back to charge them more. Wtf#3??That level of behavior and rudeness is OK maybe at Burger King.

Our experience was good, but not great.So, since we were obviously catching up and gabbing away, we were taking a while to order, which wasn't a huge deal since this place wasn't THAT busy - I mean, it was only Wednesday. So we ordered fried calamari as an appetizer, and asked the waiter to give us a few more minutes for our entree order... So we eventually decided and closed our menus, and waited... Then waited some more... Then finally we got the waiter back over and placed our entree orders just as our appetizer was coming. Sadly, the calamari was really tough. We each enjoyed our entrees, however. I ordered the gnocchi special, which were perfectly cooked. The sauce was full of flavor and herbs and coated the gnocchi like a delicious, creamy blanket. I literally couldn't stop eating it and devoured the whole dish. One other annoyance: the decibel level when they blast their birthday song over the speaker system. It was a bit much, and that night while we were there FOUR different groups of people celebrated their birthdays. I get that staff doesn't want to sing the birthday song, but that was a little excessive.

110,ctvyvoKh4jWjlRAIrxGHeQ,Tara L.,3.0 star rating,"Came here for the first time a few days ago while visiting my cousin, and I'd have to say that based on her recommendations and descriptions about the place, it was just okay for me.I have a pretty picky palate when it comes to Italian food because I'm not huge on cream-based pastas. I like sauces that are less creamy because that way it allows me to really enjoy the herbs and spices that the pasta dish has to offer. When it's slathered in cream, I feel like it's just a way to disguise the lack of fresh ingredients in the sauce.My cousin is a regular here, so we got pretty good service. She ordered the Hot Antipasti as our appetizer. Apparently, it's not on the menu, so you'll have to request it. They have it in 3 different portions measured by 1, 2, 3 respectively. Size 1 feeds about 2 people, 2 for 3-4 people, and 3 for 5-6 people. In it, there is an assortment of mussels, clams, shrimp, calamari with a delectable tomato sauce. The calamari was great - not overly fried and the squid rings were fresh, not rubbery. I only wish that there was a bit more. The clams and mussels were steamed just right and had a nice flavor to them. Mostly garlic, so if you're not a fan, make sure you let them know ahead of time to lessen the amount. The shrimp was blah, and they don't even de-vein them! Gross.For the entrees, the three of us decided to split the crab lump pasta in a cream tomato sauce and the homemade lasagna. Out of the two, the crab pasta was the winner. Though it had a little more cream than I would have liked, it wasn't overbearing like at some other places I've been to. The crab meat was plentiful and fresh, and definitely did not come from a can. Big plus on that! :) The only downside to it was that I felt the pasta was overcooked and a bit soft. I like my pasta with a bit of a bite to it, and this was cooked just 1-2 minutes over to my liking. The lasagna was very rich and had way too much ricotta cheese. At least the serving was not a whole lot, so the three of us were able to finish it up.The place itself is quite small, and I don't think they take reservations, so it's best to get there before 7pm. We got there a little before 6pm, and by the time we were about to leave, the place was already packed, inside and outside.For 3 dishes and a bottle of Pellegrino sparkling mineral water, the bill turned out to be around $97, so definitely pricey to me. I didn't think it was worth that much. The only dish worth going for is the crab lump pasta, which I believe is a daily special. Other than that, everything else was just average. Service is pretty good, but I don't know if it's just because my cousin was with us, but they seemed pretty attentive to all the tables around us.",Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

Being within the presumed advertising restrictions, we were excited to try any pasta for $15! We get there, settle in with our bottle of wine, and ask about the specials, however the anniversary deal was never mentioned. When we ask about it, we were told that it is no longer valid, that it was supposedly for the month of May only, but the owner ""doesn't know how to take the advertisement down"". I'm sorry, but that's not our fault. If you advertise it, you should abide by it - regardless of your less than par computer skills! Now that we had already opened our bottle of wine we decided to stay. I then ask about the ""truffle corner"" which was very nondescript. The waiter explained that the pasta with truffle comes with your choice of veal or scallops for $39. I asked for it without a meat option, but they said that the price would then be $34. So you are telling me that your scallops or veal are only worth $5?! Again, since I was in the mood for these seasonal truffles they said just came in I went for the $34 dish without meat, only to be served what is basically an alfredo - the truffles were barely evident if there at all.

The other girls had some and seemed to enjoy it. I didn't taste it so I can't comment on it its flavor. I didn't know exactly what my friend meant when she mentioned that it tasted frozen until my entrée came out.I ordered one of the night's special - red snapper with clams and mussels in a marinara sauce with sautéed spinach. It was not good. It indeed tasted frozen and I left about ¾ of the fish. I looked around the table and would say 4 out of the 5 of us had left a lot of food on our plates.

I have been to this restaurant before as a regular customer, and was very happy with the food and service. However, with a Groupon- totally different (and very poor) experience. A few major issues:1. We called to make a reservation twice, both times a few days before we were planning on dining. We were refused a reservation, until we tried a third time and called one week prior. Apparently, there are only so many open Groupon tables per day, which is very limiting and I've never experienced that at other restaurants before when using a Groupon deal. 2. The waitstaff rushed our order, telling us that the appetizer order and the entree order must be given together. When we were still eating our appetizers, the entrees were brought to the table and we were forced to rush and finish the apps.3. One of the four entrees was not as described, and not eaten. The waiter never checked on the meals after they were delivered.4.  After requesting to speak to a waiter, the waiter laughed at the concern of the dish that was not as ordered and refused to remake it, or offer any other option to make us happy with the dish.5. The check was marked ""Must pay balance in Cash"" and the gratuity was entered at 20%- something that has never been done before until we came in with a Groupon.6. We asked to speak to the manager.  The owner, when told about the problem with the one order, only indicated he would speak to staff. No replacement or adjustment was offered, so one of our party left hungy and unhappy.7. The waiter brought back the bill and claimed that instead of $31 in cash, only $11 was in the billfold.  This was not true, and made us all very uncomfortable.Overall, I wouldn't come to this restaurant again after the experience we had.",Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

Caesar Salad - Definitely big enough to share, but it better be for $10.  Two of us couldn't finish it. Pasta with pesto sauce - Delicious, homemade pasta, cooked perfectly with a wonderful creamy pesto sauce.  It came out steaming hot and was fantastic.  I have at least half of it left to enjoy for a lunch/dinner over the next day or two.  Veal parmesan - I had a bite and it might have been the best veal parm I've ever tasted.  Perfectly salted and cooked and topped with a fresh mozzarella that tasted almost like cream.  It came with a heaping side order of spaghetti as well.  The service was good, the bread, free bruschetta and meal was tasty, and the price was right ($48 for two people, appetizer and two entrees is a bargain in my book).",Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

Imposible to carry on any meaningful conversation, or hear the waiter's specials. The food was average. I had chicken marsala. The sauce was very thin but flavorable. There were two very small chicken breasts and a small side of pasta. My wife's eggplant and pasta dish was tasty and plentiful. All in all, an average dining experience.

Be aware: if you don't make a reservation, they will NOT accept your Groupon. This applies even to when the restaurant is empty. Don't understand the logic, but that's the way it is.     Another issue with the Groupon, is that you must order a dish that is no more than $20.50; if you order something more expensive, you cannot just pay the difference... You must pay full price. This also doesn't make any sense to me. Wouldn't you want to up-sell the new customer once you get him/her in the door for the first time? The Groupon deal has a lot of shadyness to it... so much, that it almost turned me completely off from coming here. Luckily, I had a change of heart.The restaurant is pretty great, the food is wonderfully prepared and the BYOB makes it worthwhile. The veal parm is satisfying and tender. The cannoli is delicious. The portions are large enough for leftovers. The service is good (I didn't have the issue that other yelpers before me did... My server had a helper who refilled our water and boxed my food.)The 20% automatic tip didn't bother me. But I was also aware that it was coming. I also knew before arrival that they are cash only, even though there's a Visa sticker on the door. I would have probably been pretty pissed if I didn't know that before the bill came.Long story short, the food is good, just know about the little things that may turn you off so that your experience isn't ruined when you come there for the first time (especially with a Groupon.)",Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

We tried the carpaccio app and enjoyed it. All the pasta is homemade (love that!) so knowing that, I had to try the gnocchi. I liked the gnochhi, but thought the bolognese sauce was average. My boyfriend got a seafood pasta with scallops, shrimp and lobster and really liked it. He loved the sauce and had never had homemade pasta before and couldn't believe the difference in taste. We also got the hazelnut gelatto and cannoli, and enjoyed both of those as well. The homemade pasta was a little expensive, but I always believe in paying for quality.

149,0q2LwC4ixySvQUp2GTVT5Q,Jeremy C.,2.0 star rating,"I would actually go with the 3 stars, but i think the ""meh i've had better"" rating better suits my thoughts on the place.  First the positives:We were able to get in at 7pm fairly easily for a saturday night.  Food portions are generous.  And the plates that I tasted, but did not get, were much more flavorful than mine.  The price was what you'd expect for hoboken, so not really expensive.  Also, they were really good at keeping my glass of water full.  The caesar salad was solid, not too anchovy, and perfectly dressed.Now for the negatives:The plate of fake pasta that they bring to the table to show you the specials is kinda wierd and tacky.  We had a bottle of cold white wine, as it was a byob, and they had no ice bucket or marble cooler to put the bottle in to keep temp.  Nor were they particularly active in making sure our glasses of wine were full(wierd given how good they were with the water).  My Chicken Parmigiana was middle of the pack.  The chicken was cooked perfect, and had the right flavor, as did the pasta.  But the marinara on the pasta had very little flavor to it.  If it hadn't been for the pieces of tomatoes in the sauce, i would not have been able to discern the flavor.  The cheese was put on by a very heavy hand, and thus undercooked and greasy, as opposed to bubbly and golden brown.  Also, the complimentary bruchetta they brought to the table, in my own opinion, was derailed by the large chunks of onion.  Now my personal preference is to omit onions altogether, but if you must, they should be cut small.  At the very least, it should be uniform to the size of the tomatoes, if not smaller.  The sharpness kills the freshness of the tomatoes and balsamic thats drizzled over.  One last note on the service, i was slightly turned off by the look of contempt for not ordering dessert.  If i wasn't turned off by my meal, the portions would have filled me too much.  I probably won't look to go there again, but its not something i'd fight going to.  Certainly open to having them change my mind and prove me wrong.",Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

Average pasta dish on the menu is about $18, and when they announce their myriad of specials they do not mention prices. Well, each of the 4 of us ordered a special, and little did we know they were each $35!! I mean, if we were ordering steak maybe that's fine, but we had pasta dishes!!! A casual night out quickly turned into a major expense and considering the experience with the waitstaff all night I am just appalled. You will get MUCH more for your money elsewhere.

It was 32 dollars for that dish!? I think it is absolutely ridiculous the price for that. Make sure to ask the price of the special you are interested in.

I cannot deny it or go against the obvious fact that this pace is old school.Let me explain my issue I experienced now twice. I have enjoyed two great dinners here, however they have been over shadowed by an awful owner that tries to get every dollar from you. My previous visit, I enjoyed the atmosphere and the specials, which I had asked the price of before, only to be charged 48 dollars for a seafood dish. I figured this was a misunderstanding this time and just chalked it up to that. I came back tonight thinking last time was a fluke, me and the girlfriend ordered some food and enjoyed our night. Then the bill came, and I thought it looked weird. I paid and then asked for the menu, as it turns out, I was over charged by 20 dollars when I explained it to the ""owner"" that it was an error. He told me that he kept the place open for me, with 5 other tables there,  so he gave me prices for July 4th on July 3rd? He then realized I noticed what he did and apologized. Too little too late.  I can't be upset on the service or the food, but the owner ruined it again. I will never go back because of him.

Tall - backed chairs... the shape of the water cups... even the style of the cloth napkins.. Plus, the restaurant was a bit dingy, didn't have the best ambience. And btw, my friends are Chinese, so this comment does have some cred. But we were starving so we sat down.The free bread - ehhhh, tasted like the bread you get from your local grocery store's bakery. Not a good sign.Bruschetta - surprisingly good. Tasted refreshing, almost. Entrees - anything other than a pasta dish is pricey! I ordered Tortellini (you pick between beef or cheese, I picked cheese) which was THE MOST DELICIOUS tortellini of my entire life. Cooked in a mushroom sauce, all I could think about was cream of mushroom with cheese. In pasta. Yum! Thank God for the tortellini, I think it saved our experience!The other pastas, however, tasted a bit like something that I personally could have made (which equals boil water + Barilla pasta + sauce from a jar). There wasn't anything particularly authentic about the sauces, and one of the pasta shapes I described as... tubular. But considering the gigantic portions, a dish of pasta about $17 was reasonable. Food comes out fast, and the service is very Italian-ish: meaning brusque, and to the point. I actually come back for the tortellini, but nothing else.",Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

That might have been the end of it, but NASTY GASTON made an uncalled for comment to us when the dinner was served. So classless. I would never go back  as long as GASTON is there.

My mistake.    I will start with the end cause that is when the bill arrived, placed on the table with a big, ""CASH ONLY"" in black marker with an arrow to the tip line.   No notice ahead of time that the machine was down or anything no excuse me nothing.   And a 20% tip added in automatically.   They charged us $40.00 for a ""family style"" appetizer of seafood.  We ordered 1 for the table but the waiter said they charged us for 2 because there were 4 of us.  I complied and said we only ordered 1 but he said the gave us a deal and normally its less food for $30 and he gave us twice the seafood for $40.  I told him he should ask and not make decisions for us.  We called over the manager and he started telling me that water was spilled on his credit card machine and that he can't change the tip because it has been there for 15 years, blah blah blah and that he has so many tourists coming in and they put the tip automatically.  What a LIAR!!!  There is 1 hotel in hoboken so there are no tourists.  Even if there were tourists you should not steal money from them, or locals either.  I asked him if he knows what the word ""Gratuity"" means?  he did not respond.  My friend had to walk out to the ATM in the rain and get cash.   We paid and left.  To my amusement upon my return home I saw all the reviews of how this place steals money from their customers, not only me.  There was no water spilled on the cash machine.   Read the reviews and make the decision for yourself but not worth the hassle.  There are many nice places in Hoboken that don't try to steal your hard earned money.   BEWARE!oh not to mention a $4 charge my friend got for switching pastas from spaghetti to fetuccni, $11.00 canoli, and $8.00 for Pellegrino, which the waiter poured tap water over in our glasses.   The prices seem decent on the menu but once they start stealing with their specials and charges you will pay like you never paid before.",Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

But, we got a gift card from a friend and thought we'd try it out. First the food, my girlfriend got a chicken special and pasta. She actually really enjoyed it. My Seafood Fra Diavlo on the other hand, was nothing to write home about. It had a lot of seafood (it better for almost $40), including Lobster, Calamari, Clams, and Mussels. The lobster and clams were both quite good. The Calamari and mussels were terribly overcooked and almost inedible. I'd give the dish a 3 out of 10.I've had worse meals, but what really killed me about this place was their dishonesty regarding the gift card. We were presented with a bill of $22 (originally $72 before the gift card), and the waiter ran my credit card. When the bill comes back, the $22 check had been removed and the $72 check had been secretly swapped in, and my credit card charged for the full amount. Had I not been paying attention, this would have been a free $50 to the restaurant. I brought this to their attention, and they were hardly apologetic, and actually seemed annoyed at me. I have a feeling this wasn't their first time trying to pull a fast one on  a customer.",Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian
195,Ncn0KyX4Vv_eNbgyVYVh3g,Benjamin G.,5.0 star rating,I live in Hoboken and have tried over a dozen Italian restaurants and this is by far my favorite.  The wait staff is very friendly and knowledgable and they bring out AMAZING bruschetta to wet your palet when you first sit down.  Any dish with red pasta sauce is recommended. It's fresh and sweet and probably the best I've ever had!  Plus it's BYOB so you can bring your favorite bottle and save some money.,Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

The aroma from outside the restaurant drew me in and the food from bread to dessert was extremely savory.

I had a pasta dish and the sauce tasted like it came out of a can (apparently my friend said it was the best he ever had). The apps were small and flavorless. The service was good and the atmosphere was ok. It's BYOB which is the best part BUT the food is extremely over priced and portions are a bit on the small side. My gf had the ravoli which were eh.

202,4QiuEMKRlVticL80UC4tLg,Don D.,5.0 star rating,"I've been reading the other reviews and think there must be a space warp in Hoboken -- or some link to a dark parallel universe. My wife, daughter and I were visiting New York last week and decided on a whim to check out Hoboken. We literally stumbled in to this restaurant for an early lunch on an overcast Tuesday (I think my wife had seen a good review on an foodie website) and proceeded to have one of the best Italian meals we've ever had. Ever. And I'm including Rome, Tuscany and the poshest restaurants in a dozen cities in that comparison. Astonishingly good food, served with just the right amount of casual but attentive service. This wasn't just italian-flavored stuff, this was perfectly prepared fish, pasta and salads. Whoever was in the kitchen knew the precise second to stop cooking my branzino which arrived hot, perfectly tender and flavorful (the balance of herbs, capers and lemon wasn't overpowering, but found the music in the fish). In fact, every single thing they brought to the table -- from the delicious warm bread to the baked clams, several salads, exquisitely cooked pasta and summer-perfect desert -- was a delightful expression of inspired cooking and gracious hospitality. Maybe we got lucky (and, no, we certainly didn't try to use a Groupon) but I know for certain that we will be returning to this place every chance we get. We had a perfect meal there. All I can say is Grazie! (If we go back for dinner, I'll remember to bring some wine. As I recall, the place is BYOB)",Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

The food, I must say was excellent, ranging from the salad to my dish, past with crabmeat in a vodka sauce! The only caveat was the following: as you walk in there are stickers on the door displaying all the major credit cards that are accepted in the establishment. When the bill came, handwritten on the bottom was ""CASH ONLY"". It would have been nice if this was stated before we ordered! What happened to all the patrons who didn't carry cash with them? I would make a return trip, though.",Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian
204,Y5apdg6Qk7B3KPwI2cc4kQ,May Y.,5.0 star rating,"I am not a lover of Italian cuisine. This restaurant falls into the very tiny micro-chasm of Italian places that I plan to frequent as often as I can. The menu was very extensive, but it was the specials that I was after. Our server came and told us the specials. The only words I was able to understand was ""chicken"" and ""salmon"" I think. I had to have him repeat all the specials in hopes of catching more of it since his Italian accent was so thick. No luck. I just told him I wanted the first one which ended up being a chicken in cavatelli in vodka sauce. All of the pasta is made from scratch in-house. Let me just tell you how amazing my food was. The pasta was al dente of course. The difference between a fresh-made pasta and the store-bought pastas is SO different. I never want boxed pasta again. The texture is something wonderful that everyone just experience at least once in their lifetime. Chewy, but not mushy. The pasta was perfect for catching sauce in its folds and the chicken was tender and delicious. I ate the whole thing. The bread that they put out is also perfection. Crusty pieces of bread with soft slightly salty centers. I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone.",Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

The wait staff is extremely attentive and the food is some of the best I've had in Hoboken. After the first time I ate here I was back for another dinner a week later. The portions are large and the pasta is made fresh daily. They start by bringing bruschetta out to the table and it is  close to the best I have ever had. After the bruschetta comes the warm fresh bread that is just as good.  It is a BYOB spot so make sure you stop to pick up a bottle or 2 of wine.,Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian

214,RZMbmfX_1T_-AyZmLCnTGQ,David C.,2.0 star rating,"**********MUST READ********** My wife, son and I went there on Sunday April 26th. First the menu is limited and there is a reason for this and the reason is called ""specials"".When your server stands at your table and rattles off 10 minutes of specials you know that means trouble, especially when the do not say the price.These specials are the same everyday. I did not want chicken parm, I can get that in a pizzeria. I asked then for chicken sorrentino which any restaurant or pizza place makes.The waiter said that would be a special. Are you kidding me? So I ordered pasta fagioli for soup.$8.50 for a small bowl. I went with a Risotto with Shrimp and clams, 2 shrimp and the tiniest clams on this earth.$19..50. My son ordered lobster ravioli and it was a special.$23.95 for raviolis. To top it off my wife ordered a stuffed artichoke. Holy cow $16.95. The maître d"" was very eager to get us in but could give a crap after that. Go to a restaurant that has a liquor license and you will save money. So many in Hoboken to choose from.

218,rGFFcj9_SgTqfq8S71EBcQ,Brian K.,4.0 star rating,"There are so many 3-star reviews for this place - I guess Hobokenites have very high standards for their Italian food.Pros:FOOD. YES. FOOD. Most of their dishes are amazing. It seems like the chef likes to use a lot of everything, so their food may taste too ""strong"" (salty, cheesy, you name it) to some patrons, but personally that's how I like my food. I do believe it when they say they make their own pasta because the quality of the pasta is exceptional. The portions are not extreme, just the right amount for an adult to feel comfortably full after an appetizer and an entree. I never had any problems with the staff here on my visits, but it is true that they seem a little disorganized. But at the same time, I think it adds to that folksy feeling an Italian restaurant should have. If you want a perfect service, go to a French or a Japanese restaurant. Cons: The place is expensive. Yes, the food itself might be worth the price, but I'm not sure if the ambiance of the place is worth $20+ for a plate of pasta.  Also the parking can be extremely hard if you don't live in Hoboken, but that's common for all downtown Hoboken restaurants. Overall:I am sure this place beats most of the Italian restaurants in New York City. I go here quite often already, but if it was a bit cheaper than now, I will probably go here pretty much every day.",Trattoria Saporito,3.5 star rating,$$,Italian
