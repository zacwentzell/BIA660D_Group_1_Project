Unfortunately there's still some work to be done before it's great - food took 30min and was incorrect when it arrived, and the menu has zero options which are gluten and dairy free. They were friendly and apologetic about the wait so I'll try again soon!",Sunnyside Cafe & Eatery,4.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Sandwiches"

Im in heaven.",Sunnyside Cafe & Eatery,4.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Sandwiches"
56,ohYh43-Y18KLCrsQu-ywbg,William R.,5.0 star rating,"Easily our new favorite coffee and breakfast spot. The Brekkie roll is quite possibly the best egg sandwich I've ever had. Super simple but super delicious. Iced coffee and lattes compete with Bluestone for best in Hoboken. Vibe is chill. Can't help but think they'd do even better if more centrally located in Hoboken. No matter, def worth the walk.",Sunnyside Cafe & Eatery,4.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Sandwiches"

They were helpful when I was working through the menu as well as attentive, providing me the WiFi password when they noticed I took my laptop out. The breakfast sandwich I got was simple enough but was made fresh and much better then I expected. Gotta love when places get the simple things right.

This place emplifies the worst of gentrification...bland, unoriginal, $4.50 for an 8 oz latte in a paper cup, 12 bucks for a meager salad with a few slices of kale and 1/4 a hardboiled egg.",Sunnyside Cafe & Eatery,4.0 star rating,$$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Sandwiches"
