Everything came out to 9$ which was awesome because of the huge portion of the meal",Manà Restaurant,5.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional)"

3,s0xc6f4fpvQRELSfRA205A,Eliot M.,5.0 star rating,"It's a small family run restaurant, but there's no arguing with the quality of the food. The pernil (roast pork) is my favorite, but everything is tasty and authentic. The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. It's by no means fancy - more cafeteria style. But if you're looking for tasty Spanish food, this place is well worth a try.",Manà Restaurant,5.0 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional)"
