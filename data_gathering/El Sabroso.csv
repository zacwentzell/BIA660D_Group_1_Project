Good food, but still.It's interesting to read that other folks have had trouble ordering on the phone with El Sabroso.

And I don't speak Spanish, so it that's not a factor.But to the food. It's good. Not outstanding, but still good and I'll keep going there. It's comfort food in big portions and I now stick with my favorites.

One of my friends loves the oxtail stew; oxtail is not really my thing, but it was tasty from the few bites I had. YUM!I've tried their mofongo and I didn't particularly like it and there was one other dish years ago that I tried that I wasn't a fan of either, but my usuals hit the spot. I usually take out, and the few times I have sat down to eat, the service is rather slow and I wouldn't say their staff is the perkiest crew around, but it's also not terrible.

6,sgk0J9CJiA9jaeZBNqCEhA,Steph R.,3.0 star rating,I was so annoyed the other day when I went to buy a mofongo for lunch. I asked for it to be plain but it came with chopped up veggies which was okay but I'm allergic to tomatoes so they should have asked. I was already at my job when I opened it up to realized it looked hard like a rock usually other places give a garlic sauce or some kind of chicken broth on the side to make it moist. It had no garlic flavor to me it tasted like old oil and I was so surprised after reading so many good reviews about this. Too expensive also I paid ten or twelve for a fried platano that wasn't even good. I ended up throwing it away never again. Please buy your self a platano and look up the recipe I promise you it'll come out better then el sabrosos and you'll save your self the money to buy some meat on the side lol    *********This is an update of my last review**********  I decided to give this place another chance since isla bonita closed down and I wanted some soup. I was out on break and noticed that they didn't have a line so decided to walk in and saw they had sancocho on the menu so order that to go. I got to my job and noticed the soup came with white rice on the side which is a plus. It tasted good but it was a little different since it didn't have yucca there were pieces of salami in it and batata... maybe next time I'll try something new.,El Sabroso,4.0 star rating,$,"Latin, American,, Puerto, Rican,, Spanish"

Which caused a cramped experience. Other than that the place is good enough to eat and enjoy. You can either sit down or take out.

58,0AVrAngjfV_gE4wFKlcV6Q,Deborah D.,5.0 star rating,"So I have a rule in Jersey City. Anytime a restaurant has a bunch of glowing Yelp reviews, serves ""ethnic""  food (ie, NOT generic American fare...Hoboken, I'm looking at YOU!), and has one $, it's bound to be good. I can think of countless examples. And this formula has never steered me astray. It's like this: if it's a local ethnic place that has not succumb to gentrification enough to jack up the prices to $$ or $$$, it's got to appeal to the local crowd. So it's tasty and authentic. If it has a bunch of reviews on Yelp, that adds to its appeal and makes me wonder why all those other Yelpers have beat me to it!!!! So I slip my size 5 shoes on and get moving. :)Having scoured downtown JC from top to bottom (reviewing all the while!), Bald One decided that it's time to get busy nosing around other neighborhoods in our diverse city. We decided a Latin American tour of the Heights was in order. El Sabroso was top of our list, having met the aforementioned criteria.Let's keep it simple: Puerto Rican food. 5 stars. One $. Go.Let's drill down: we ordered 1 chicken empanada, 1 alcapurria (fried mashed plantain/banana appetizer), 1 ""small"" chicken stew that came with a huge side of arroz con gandules (rice with pigeon peas), and 1 20 oz diet Coke. Price?  Less than $10 for the TWO of us.And the food was amazing. Empanada and alcapurria melted in our mouths. I was new to the alcapurria and it was savory, sweet, and had the best texture. Mmmm!!!! The chicken stew was AMAZING.  It featured bone-in chicken breast cooked til tender with an amazing sauce that was velvety over the yellow rice and pigeon peas. The potatoes took on the flavor of the sauce and tasted slightly tangy and earthy. I could have eaten this for days!!! And beware of the descriptors - this ""small"" stew was definitely enough to share for 2 people, especially if you order apps (which you most certainly should.)The establishment was spacious, clean, and baby friendly. And if I could have given a 6th star for service, I would. They were patient as we navigated the menu with zero Spanish speaking skills. And the busboy chatted us up about our daughter (and like any proud new papa, showed us pics of his chubby 9 month old). Just our first time there, and we already felt like we'd been going for years.

This is one of the places you can get a true Puerto Rican alcapurria. I've also had the mofongo with shrimp that was pretty good too. They have different specials daily and it's cheap. I like to go here to have the traditional Puerto Rican meals I don't want to put the time in to making myself at home and it's always good. So I haven't had the more basic meals like the ribs or ropa veija that I can get anywhere so my review is geared to the PR looking for traditional foods your grandmother made for you back home.  It's true the service is poor when it get busy but this is a mom and pop operation.

I guess the food is Puerto Rican? I don't really know a lot about Latin food beyond Mexican and Cuban. It was a nice change of pace to have some something different. Our first time, we didn't know what to get, so the waitress spent a good amount of time with us, answering all of our stupid questions.

Oh... and it's not that we're looking for free food or anything, but nothing was offered to cushion the blow of making us wait the 2 hours. Driver blames the restaurant claiming they take orders and just stick the orders in the back. We contacted the restaurant and respectful told them our dilemma... to which they reply.

God only knows what took me so long, but I am now mentally flogging myself for being a lazy bum about it. She sure was damn right the mofongo was good! And not only was it good, but it was rich. I had it with shrimp, and expecting only two or three pieces of shrimp in there, I got about 10! And a very small side of salad which was also delicious. The garlic sauce was just perfectly garlicky and salty, and I would've licked the plate so as not to waste a single dollop if there weren't so many people around. Speaking of people, I did notice a few Yelpers who didn't really favor the customer service too well which I understood on our way out. When we came in around 4 pm for an early dinner this evening (Saturday), there were lots of empty tables. Sit anywhere you want. Don't expect a hostess to seat you. We were greeted by a very friendly waitress who took our order and who was also kind enough to suggest what kind of meat I should choose with my mofongo (although I was pretty much set on shrimp already). It didn't take very long until we got our food. Then around 5 pm, more diners started coming in. And by 5:15, there was pretty much a wait for a table. And by then, we never saw our waitress again. I had to walk up to the cashier and ask for our check. But despite our disappearing waitress, we'll be coming back. I like that the menu didn't have a million things in it. The food was delicious and plentiful--my friend had a ""small"" order of chuletas and yellow rice, but it was huge! And I'd like to know how appetizing their other dishes are.

This being said let me start off by saying that I was a faithful customer from Sabrosos when they were just a whole in the wall on Lincoln Street when they were a humble restaurant and they appreciated the customers. I went to Sabrosos about two years ago in their current location and bought take out order, approxamately $67.00 worth of food, It was Tacitos Tuesdays as i call it, good tacos they sell. I had 7 orders of the tacos which is accompanied by a small sauce in a dipping cup. So after I receive my order I told the owner can I have more sauce there were only 4, so she gave me 3 more. I said gosh there are three tacos per order may I have a few more, she told me no, that I have to pay $1.00 for every extra sauce, so I told her I just spent $67.00 on food, dont you think its pretty fare to get extra sauce at no charge, plus $1.00 is insane, she said no, I replied, thats a condiment, do you charge for ketchup? She replied, if I have too. So I payed $5 for 5 extra sauces, by the way my order took about 40 minutes to put together, they have a lack of service,I left and never went back there for two years until today.So today I order a meal, Which in latin food, rice beans and meat is a complete order, not over here, If you order Rice and Pernil, oh no, you just get rice and pernil, obviously the beans are gonna get ordered, and yes its a separate charge. So when I was done eating I had a bit of food left, My Food was $47.00 and I asked the waitress I wanted to take my food home, and the nerves of this place to charge  me 25 cents for the aluminum plate to take my left overs. Thats the icing on the cake Never again will I step foot in this place EVER, its about certain principles. Maybe if I even thought about going in another 2 years they might charge you for the Napkins and a service charge for using their utensils. If you like good food and dont mind service that sucks long wait time and HIDDEN FEES on nonsense like condiments, dont waste your time anymore.

The oxtail is tender and falls off the bone, the pernil and chicken moist, and the tostones some of the best I've had. I know they are such a simple thing to make, but many places either serve the frozen garbage, don't make them thin enough, etc. Sabroso thankfully doesn't do any of this crap and they're perfect every time. They make them to order, so if you're in a rush, you might want to call ahead because you'll wait an extra ten minutes. But it's worth it. I am not crazy about their empanadas or their alcapurrias, and they tend to be heavy on the rice and light on the meats if you don't request otherwise. Still, the entrees are all very well done and that's what you should be going for anyway.Service can be a little lax sometimes, but the ladies are all very nice.

92,wJRGnYg9nh3MelddeYkQ0A,Ajay S.,3.0 star rating,"Ate here once, and I must say, it is a fairly decent place. The arroz con pollo, a meal that is most common at Spanish places, was delicious. The chicken was nicely cooked and had a wonderful taste. However, the rice and beans were not up to par with some of the other Spanish restaurants.",El Sabroso,4.0 star rating,$,"Latin, American,, Puerto, Rican,, Spanish"
93,Z3_IaLBpUwlCCjyFWU2KPA,marullos s.,4.0 star rating,"El Sabroso seriously lives up to its name. 'Sabroso' means flavorful. I had the arroz con gandules with pernil. Both were delicious. I got the 'big' size ($2 more), and I didn't think it was that big, but that might be because my husband kept stealing my food! The  rice was very good. The pernil was moist, soft, and super tasty. No cuerito though, which is a shame. My husband had camarones al ajillo and tostones. The shrimp was very flavorful. the tostones were awesome, on the thicker side. We also had alcapurrias and they were good. They would have been better if they had been fresh, but you could tell they had been fried hours before and were no longer very crunchy.We will certainly come here again!",El Sabroso,4.0 star rating,$,"Latin, American,, Puerto, Rican,, Spanish"
94,WV7Xq3ivcOv1LsFSjaoJnA,Johnny R.,2.0 star rating,"The food tastes good to a Hispanic tongue. However, 99% of items on the menu include fried foods. There aren't healthy alternatives. A lot of the items also lack variability. For the most part they are the same thing. Pork. That being said, I'll give an extra star for the setting. It's a nice looking restaurant with a modern feel.",El Sabroso,4.0 star rating,$,"Latin, American,, Puerto, Rican,, Spanish"

Regardless, the food tastes as if my grandmother in Mayagüez cooked it. Before i even moved to Hudson county ive been hearing about this place. Definitely worth the hype.

98,X0M4HPEKDGvFyxIPjiJxsg,S O.,2.0 star rating,"I've tried it once just to break the routine and sat down for lunch. My impression was, I dont get the ""ambiance"" it was trying to project. Lights are dim but the whole front wall (entrance) is transparent glass. So at lunch time, the glare of sunlight outside and the recessed lightning inside is just awful. At least put some blinds or something. They also have a big-ass electric fan inside and it was so noisy. it was a big WTF for me. I really hated that part.Customer service: the lady doesnt speak english so we had trouble communicating. We asked if they serve any bread while we wait but nobody knows what to do and couldnt even tell us yes or no. A guy went over to clarify and so we explained. I thought he understood but never came back *shrugs*. I guess PioPio spoiled us too much. So the food came back. I ordered beef steak. big serving. nothing special. I guess it was good but nothing special.When we came out of the restaurant we all smelled like Kitchen. Didnt like the whole experience so we might not come back again.

Even the simple tossed salad is good.  I usually hate or don't bother with salad.This place is very casual and they are making small improvements a little at a time. The store front is nice but once by the food counter, it's looks out of place. The menu used to be a simple in appearance but now it's protected and in color.  I'm a fan.",El Sabroso,4.0 star rating,$,"Latin, American,, Puerto, Rican,, Spanish"
