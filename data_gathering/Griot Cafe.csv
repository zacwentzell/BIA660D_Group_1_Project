Sure, we have a dozen bakeries and coffee shops, but Griot is the first place that I've actually *wanted* to hang out in. They're definitely trying to cultivate that vibe, too -- they've got a growing library of books and magazines by the window, and a cozy yet modern ambiance that invites you to sit down and relax.Don't worry -- their coffee and pastries are also on point. I've had a latte and regular drip, and both were great. A few friends and I also shared their cinnamon roll and chocolate croissant, which we all thought were fantastic.The service is another highlight. As soon as you walk in, you'll be warmly greeted by whoever's standing behind the counter, and they'll sincerely ask about your day. This place just has such a warm environment. I'd really love to see it do well. But I don't think they'll have any trouble with that, especially since they boast the only outdoor seating space on Central Ave! Can't wait until the weather gets nice and they open up that patio. Until then, I'll continue to bring my laptop here and get some work done while I sip on delicious coffee. Don't sleep on this place!",Griot Cafe,5.0 star rating,,Cafes

It seems like they just opened only recently but when I was there, they had plenty of folks from the neighborhood lined up already. The coffee was perfection and I was obsessed with Haitian patties! I had the spinach patty and the chicken patty - spinach was the best one. I happen to come by when the owner, John, was there. Lovely guy and seemed super excited to meet with his customers. I get the sense this is only the beginning for this lovely establishment!",Griot Cafe,5.0 star rating,,Cafes

And at $1.59 including tax, the price can't be beat.They also have cold brew and nitro coffees and a lovely spread of pastries.The staff are very friendly and pleasant and the interior of the cafe is quite attractive. The lighting is great and there are a lot of matte gold finishes that look very appealing. They have wifi and even books you can borrow!",Griot Cafe,5.0 star rating,,Cafes
3,3YrdbuqpMlPxK71TzBDrpw,Betsy S.,5.0 star rating,"Haven't got much to add to the other reviews; this cafe is fantastic. We had the beef, chicken and spinach pastries, all were delicious but I particularly enjoyed the spinach - moist and tasty deliciousness encased in that light, buttery pastry mmmm. Coffee was strong and smooth. It's spacious and immaculate with simple, cool decor and everyone there including the owners made the atmosphere friendly and inviting. A go-to destination on Central Ave.",Griot Cafe,5.0 star rating,,Cafes
4,Wg3ePkH_2iKznbUG4nzmHg,Jeremy O.,5.0 star rating,"First off, most important thing is that the coffee is phenomenal. Really smooth blend, and I appreciate that it's organic and ethically sourced. Second: Their pastries were a delightful surprise. I wasn't familiar with them initially (aside from things like Croissants, etc), but watching them being prepared in-house enticed me. 1 of their pastries is almost like a croissant + empanada hybrid, with a fresh flaky outside and well-seasoned ground chicken or beef or spinach inside. I had 3 in one sitting. Third: The staff and management were really friendly, and it went a long way because it made it feel like a communal experience. The friendliness of the staff was contagious and led to friendly convos between customers. I chatted with a nice guy about English Premiere League soccer. And lastly, the place is very clean, well lit, and welcoming. It's a place I can see myself sitting for a while, enjoying coffee, working off my laptop (free wifi there also), etc. Their bookshelf was a nice touch, again, giving the place a communal atmosphere. This place has a SOUL, it doesn't feel like a corporate institution established it or some owners who don't care about creating an experience for their customers. It's clear they do.",Griot Cafe,5.0 star rating,,Cafes

I had their chicken turnover, and it was awesome. I heard they are adding new items to the menu as well. I would definitely recommend checking them out.",Griot Cafe,5.0 star rating,,Cafes
