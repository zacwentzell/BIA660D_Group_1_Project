The several times I've been here, everyone was either glued to their laptops or working/studying. Its super quiet even with the music and I felt pretty awkward being the only ones talking. But if you're looking for a good study spot or a quiet place to so work, this is definitely a good option. I'm going to start by talking about their quiches. I didn't expect a quiche from a chain bakery to totally blow every other place out of the water. Better than the other french bakeries in town I might add. I was impressed. Velvety smooth filling layered with salty meat and a dynamite crust. It's probably a days' worth of calories but whatever. Girl's gotta enjoy her weekends. The other pastries are pretty standard and the coffees are good. I'd make the trip back just for those damn quiches.",Caffe Bene,3.5 star rating,$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Bakeries,, Sandwiches"

Now I've been to a couple of Caffe Bene. It seems so promising from the outside. The plushy decor and sweet displays always brings you into the fold of the store. But the substance is not there. A lot of the items and drinks are facade of a wannabe coffee specialty store. What is left is the scraps and 10 hour old pastries at the end of the business day.We tried to order 2 items and both were not available. Ended up with a sliver of stale cheese cake. Service and preparation took long a long time. Not sure if they were understaffed on a Friday night or just cleaning up after long day.

However the desserts were not that good. We got the crème brulee; the custard was good, but there was no sugar layer on top that is supposed to be hard. It ruined the essence of a crème brulee. The plain cheesecake was good, I would get that again.We also got the pistachio macaroon cake which was good but even though I have a big sweet tooth, I found it too sweet for my taste.I definitely expected more from the desserts but the atmosphere is great.

But I had the ""strawnana waffle"" or something like that - a strawberry banana waffle. I also had a tiramisu cake slice (because they also have it in a macaroon) and a strawberry banana smoothie.I wasn't too impressed with the waffle as it was a bit too dry for me with very little of the chocolate drizzle to give every bite that good flavor. The strawberries and bananas tasted fresh so that was a plus!The tiramisu had me very disappointed!! But maybe my standards are set too high. I just came back from Italy last week and their tiramisu was to die for and I've been craving, so coming here was just such a let down for my crave.
