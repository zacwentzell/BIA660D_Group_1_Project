0,SrjgAW7wl2cvHPTlu9LgCQ,Kristi D.,5.0 star rating,"Went there last night, because we are always looking for a good tapas place. This place had great reviews and we thought we'd try it out. We had an amazing meal of mixed tapas. The sauteed spinach and the pulpo were especially excellent. The interior is absolutely beautiful, warm, and welcoming. We also loved our waitress (Nia?), who was funny and super-helpful. And we got free dessert :)We will definitely go back.The only thing this place could improve on is having draft beer instead of only bottled. Otherwise it's perfect.",Casita,4.0 star rating,,"Spanish,, Tapas, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
1,eOEGDcI0zYoxFFzBRA73xg,Juliana E.,1.0 star rating,"This is probably one of the most disappointing dinning experiences I've had. We started with red wine, which was warm. We ordered patatas bravas i.e lays chips with some ketchup on them. We also ordered the gambas a la sal (cost $12) and we received 3 pieces, unpeeled. The croquetas , 3 cm in diameter, for $10. Not to mention that they did not have more than half of the items on the menu.",Casita,4.0 star rating,,"Spanish,, Tapas, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
2,ahDnlICsBrkSR-c1QNDpkg,Cyril M.,4.0 star rating,"My fiance read about this place opening recently in the New York Times and we decided to try it. She is a vegetarian and was excited for some of the veggie options they offer. We started with Patatas Bravas. Fried bravas potato cups filled with a spicy hot sauce and creamy aioli. Very tasty but it was a tapas portion so you get three smaller pieces per order. Next we had a chefs choice cheese platter. It comes with three cheeses, some olives, dried fig pieces, and some small bread sticks. The serving comes as a full plate so the portion was a little more substantial than a tapas.We had seen that there was a vegetarian paella available online but it was not on the menu when we got there. Fortunately the manager said they would be able to accommodate our request for some. I love paella and I thought this was a very good veggie version. It's a large portion that easily makes an entree for two. It took it little while while to come out as it wasn't on the regular menu that night. I thought it was understandable but even so the manager comped us a drink for having to wait. Overall great experience, good food and good drinks.",Casita,4.0 star rating,,"Spanish,, Tapas, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

5,WvtSlsnDVnBDXNSjMUtTqQ,Megan A.,1.0 star rating,"One star solely because they literally may not even exist anymore. Tried to go there on a random Tuesday last month, they were closed for no reason at 7:30pm with no sign. Tried to call for dinner reservations (and to also see if they are open in general) a few times, during normal hours, with no answer at least 8 separate occasions. The answering machine still says ""We are scheduled to begin operations mid-August"" and to go to the website for more info. It is now December. Website offers no info about being closed. Don't waste your time.",Casita,4.0 star rating,,"Spanish,, Tapas, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
6,bjOLcoQZ2wwO9vkZc8lYDA,Ann D.,5.0 star rating,"Amazing food, service and loved the decor! I sooooo miss the food in Barcelona and have searched for an equivalent experience in NYC and have been unable to find it until now at Casita. The food is exquisite! The chef Miguel is passionate about food and his passion comes out in his dishes. We were so excited by each dish that we nearly tried everything on the menu and there wasn't a single disappointment. The staff were incredible too. I am a business owner and I was mesmerized by the fact that each of them acted like an owner or partner, giving special attention to the guests, the service and the food. From the moment I walked into the open and airy space I felt a ""Barcelona/NY "" energy and the smell of the bread and the spices carried my imagination to the eating adventure I was about to experience. The bartender offered tastings to help me decide on the wine to accompany our feast and off we went on one of the best NYC eating experiences. I can't wait till my next visit!",Casita,4.0 star rating,,"Spanish,, Tapas, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
7,1NZSCehoizEzde2guJqM4Q,Jennifer E.,5.0 star rating,"This new Spanish tapas spot in the West Village is a gem.  The decor is modern but still warm.  The service is spot on- attentive without being intrusive.  Some dishes I liked:  The ham croquetas - if only I could order them by the barrel - beyond good.  The octopus might be the best I've had in the city.  The chicken stew is rich and absolutely delicious. The seafood paella is so fresh, it is absolutely worth the extra wait time.  Finally the 3lb ribeye is perfectly seasoned and an impressive presentation of beef.  I'm a big fan of this new addition to the neighborhood.",Casita,4.0 star rating,,"Spanish,, Tapas, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
