1,dD-e4MWK3p5xUK9gcWpu9w,Emma P.,4.0 star rating,"Sri Thai is an unassuming BYOB that has the best Thai food in both Hoboken and J.C. The decor is kind of lacking and there is always cheesy pop music playing, but the staff are friendly and service is swift. The food is really really tasty, I've never been disappointed when I have eaten here and I have been eating here for almost fifteen years! I find the food is fresh, it's not greasy and it's pretty authentic and well spiced - it's Thai food rather than American/Thai. Their salads and appetizers are always good. Tom Yum Soup is out of this world delicious, it has a bit more body and 'funk' than other places and I love their curry puffs. It's not at all expensive and the lunch special here is great value for money -   either $7.95 or $8.95 depending on your choice of protein, for either soup or salad and a generously sized portion of a selection of their entrees. Overall SriThai is one of Hoboken's best dining options, if you like Thai try it!",Sri Thai Thai Restaurant,3.5 star rating,$$,Thai

My experience with Thai restaurants in Hoboken has been a bit of hit or miss, and I would have to say that this place did not stand out to me as a place I would necessarily go out of my way for. Make no mistake that they absolutely have a target audience, which is quick and reliable Thai food, but at the same time, this is certainly more of a place for locals than if you're just in town for a night or so.",Sri Thai Thai Restaurant,3.5 star rating,$$,Thai

9,tCjYkKd3jxm5-QoGqJuQgQ,Kelly R.,1.0 star rating,"SO DISAPPOINTED! This place has gone way downhill. I used to order from here a lot then stopped just to try to cook more at home. Just ordered for the first time in a long time my usual green curry, absolutely disgusting almost inedible and for me to say that is so very rare. They clearly have stopped using coconut milk as a base for their curries which is how Thai curry should be made so I don't know what this is. They are just using oil. It's lost its flavorful, spicy and light texture and is plain gross. I received a green curry that was a rotten color, with not enough broth/base, and a layer of oil sitting on top. They also sent me my brown rice wrapped in Saran Wrap and not just in the container. Btw there was no way enough curry sauce to even eat with the rice.

It was also pouring, and I was starving.  Hoboken just sucks in general, and since my office moved here two years ago, I'm always looking for something new to try. When I walked in, there was an awful stench, but it could have been from spices, plus, I was just getting takeout, so I overlooked it. I got back to my office, and I opened my bag of food.  There were no utensils.  What if I was going somewhere that didn't have any; how on earth would I eat my food? Strike one.I opened my soup. It had CHICKEN in it, ick.  I ordered a dish without meat. Do you think that maybe I don't eat meat? Strike two. I opened my actual lunch, and it smells not so hot, but maybe it tastes better.  Nope.  Never have I been tempted to throw a lunch out, but it's been here for an hour-and-a-half, and I've barely touched it, despite the fact that I'm starving.   There's barely any protein in it, either.  It has a weird aftertaste, almost like urine.  It's gross, but I'm really hungry.  There is nothing really close to my office, and I've already wasted $9.57 on this garbage.  I'd go and ask for my money back, but I doubt they'd give it to me, and I don't want to deal with the stench again, nor do I have the time. Strikes three, four, five...etc. Just retire the side.  Also, while she was friendly, the girl at the register really needs to go back to elementary school. I handed her $9.75.  My total was $9.57.  My change should be 18 cents.  She was really struggling there and had to use the calculator no less than 4 times to figure it out.  I was going to say something, but each time, she looked like she had it, then nope.Stay far, far away...or bring some bleach.",Sri Thai Thai Restaurant,3.5 star rating,$$,Thai

While Larb Moo; ground pork with chili, lemon juice and Thai herb served with lettuce and Jasmine rice is my all time favorite. the balance between spice and citrus flavor suits my palate.In summary, a great place to dine that serves freshly cooked Thai dishes!",Sri Thai Thai Restaurant,3.5 star rating,$$,Thai

These are the things you need to try:*paw pia sod - crab, Chinese sausage, bean sprouts, egg, in a steamed spring roll with plum sauce - light but packed with flavor *larb nau - ground beef with chili, lemon juice, and herbs - brightness of the citrus sets off the savory and spicy beef*kai pad ped/nau pad ped/lamb pad ped - chicken beef or lamb with eggplant in red chili paste curry - what do they do to that eggplant it's like crack?!?!

To start, our friends each ordered soup and we ordered the dragonfly steamed dumplings. Our friends soup came pretty quickly, but our dumplings never did. I still can't understand how they were forgotten, since we had to clarify with her which dumplings we wanted from the menu. In any case, it turned out to be okay for me because my dish was more than big enough to fill me; my husband, on the other hang, was left with a hunger pang that he ended up curing once we got back home.I ordered the pad Thai, which had really great flavor. My only complaint was that the egg wasn't broken up enough, so it was more like having pad Thai dumped on top of a fried egg, rather than having the egg mixed well throughout. The service was pretty good aside from forgetting our dumplings, but maybe the quality was a little subpar because we arrived there somewhat late. By the end of our meal, our server was hurrying us along a little bit and when we looked inside the whole staff was sitting at a table eating ""family meal"" together to finish their night.I'd be willing to give this place another try, earlier in the evening, to see if the service and quality improve a little.

This is Hoboken people, not Harlem. Yes it's tiny inside, but I'm here for good food!  The place is clean too. As I do with all new restaurants, I check the bathroom. Clean bathroom = clean kitchen. I've had takeout on many occasions, have dined in a handful of times, and I'm never disappointed. It's a traditional menu that won't let you down. Yes it's the ""standard unimaginative"" according to another reviewer. But I'm looking for authentic Thai cuisine, not some kind of fusion from the PF Changs menu. Quantities aren't going to overstuff you like we Americans are so accustomed to, but pricing is reflective.I almost always order the spicy eggplant w/tofu, or the vegetable spicy basil dish (pad gra praw I think). Gratefully they make them both for me without using fish sauce. I also ask them to make it extra spicy to which they always accommodate. One minor negative to me is sometimes the smell inside reminds me of cleaning products or bug spray.  It may just be they are frequently exterminating and/or cleaning.

Having been to Thailand myself, I typically rate a place based on their Tom Kha Kai soup- my expectations were met. I would highly recommend the Thai iced tea as well- one of the best I have ever had. I noticed many fellow yelpers gave poor reviews to Sri Thai based on the pad thai dish...... pad thai is an americanized thai dish, you wouldn't order a burger at a sushi restaurant so don't order pad thai at a Thai restaurant and base your whole review off of it.  I will definitely be going back here and/or ordering delivery.

As I was placing my order, the woman on the phone said their computer was resetting, and that she would call me back in a couple minutes. About 15 minutes later, I called back and there was no acknowledgement of what had just happened; it was clear they had forgotten! Poor customer service right off the bat. It was difficult to communicate with them when placing my order, and I had to repeat things several times. It sounded like it was very busy in the restaurant and I wasn't getting the full attention. But the biggest peeve was that I had ordered a bunch of food and requested that a couple of items, like the yellow curry, be very mild because it was for kids. When the food was delivered, it was all incredibly spicy! In fact, we could barely tell the difference between the two curries (yellow and red) because they both looked the same color, and both were the same spicy level. Very frustrating because the kids ended up eating plain rice. Which was another annoyance: I asked for brown rice. But rather than substituting the white rice with brown, they added 2 orders of brown rice to the white rice that comes with the curries. So we ended up with 4 cartons of rice, which made no sense with the meal we had just ordered.

You know the places that you're apprehensive to speak about for fear that people will go see how good it is, then forever ruin it with long wait times? this is that place for me.i noticed other reviews and some peeps aren't loving the pad thai. i've never had the pad thai here, but i DO think that its a dish that people have lots of differing expectations for. some like sweet, spicy, tangy, saucy, dry, crunchy--so its difficult to find a place with pad thai to your liking. i've only found one place that i like, from a place called Luscious thai, near the 59th st bridge on the UES!if you're thinking of ordering something else, i'd check out any of the dishes with chili and thai basil, the triple or double delight, spicy noodle (like pad see ew, but better) or any of the curries (i think green is the best!) my man likes the ground pork dish, and we always split an order of the chicken satay. the sauces are great.best part is that the prices are super reasonable. BYOB always helps, but the main dishes are $9-$12 that are big and come with rice. service is hit or miss. there are 2 women who answer the phones, serve the food, bus the tables, pack up the takeout/delivery, refill the water etc, so if its busy it may be slow, but its worth it. but where are you rushing off to anyway? bring a bottle of wine and relax! :o)",Sri Thai Thai Restaurant,3.5 star rating,$$,Thai

The portion wasn't big so I ordered spicy basil chicken as my main dish. I thought this one was a bit too sweet and for some reasons basil in America varies in taste a lot depending on where you bought it. I know this is weird! But I wasn't too fond of the taste of Sri Thai basil and they were generous with basil. Other than that it was all good, I asked for chili fish sauce and the dish tasted good with it.

You'll like it!While I am not sure whether sharing my personal stories with you, the readers, really helps connect with me, I will continue to do so until I think of a better solution. This week marks the one year anniversary when I parted ways with one of my ex girlfriends. But not only has it been a year since I parted with her, but this week also marks the one year anniversary of the last time I had the best Thai food I've ever tasted. My friends and loyal readers know that I used to joke that one of the best parts of the relationship was her mother, who would cook me delicious traditional Thai dishes for lunches and dinners. But the saying that there is a little truth in every joke definitely applies here. In the past year, I have eaten at many Thai places, but nothing could ever compare to the home cooking that I grew accustomed to for over a year. Feeling a bit nostalgic, I decided to continue my search for a suitable replacement and review Sri Thai.On the corner of 3rd and Bloomfield, it's a farther walk than I am used to, which may be why it took me so long to finally try them out. Although a bit dingy on the outside, the inside is surprisingly fresh. Recently renovated, the warm colors dress up this hole in the wall establishment into something a bit more presentable. However, it seemed to me like they tried to jam way too many tables in too small of a space. I could only imagine how crowded and uncomfortable it may get when the place hits peak times. The server was quite but attentive, so I can't complain one way or the other.There were several dishes that my ex's mom would make for me on a regular basis, each of which I tried at Sri Thai. For appetizers, I ordered the Tom Yum Koong Soup, which was shrimp and mushroom with lemon grass in hot and sour broth. The soup was cooked perfectly, and was packed with that sour and spicy flavor that I was looking for. Predictably, I also ordered the Pla Mueg Tod, which was deep fried squid with plum sauce. Although the portion was smaller than expected, the squid was cooked perfectly, not too tough and not too chewy. I also shared the Sri Thai Assorted sampler which came with 2 dumplings, 2 shrimp egg rolls, and what resembled an empanada but stuffed with green curry. Again, small portions on the appetizers, but they embodied the saying quality over quantity. For the main course, my guest ordered the Kang Dang lunch special which was chicken with red curry, coconut milk, and bamboo shoots. It is definitely not a taste that agrees with everyone, but I found it pretty tasty with the chicken being a tad over cooked. I ordered my most favorite of Thai dishes, Pad See Ew, which was beef with stir fried rice noodle, broccoli, and egg. I used to eat this dish twice a day for weeks in a row, so I had some pretty high standards. However, Sri Thai's Pad See Ew scored high marks in my book. Then to finish off we each had a Thai Ice Tea and their version of Fried Ice Cream. While the Thai Ice Tea was about average, the fried ice cream was less flakey and more solid, which can be either hit or miss.Call me odd, but I like to link foods to emotions. Whenever I eat sushi, I think of happy times hanging out with my friends from high school. Whenever I eat platters, I think about all the crazy adventures I've had in college that have ended with that delicious street meat. And when I eat Thai, I will always remember the dozens of meals prepared by a second mother of sorts. While I have all but abandoned to find a restaurant that can offer me the special home cooking I craved, Sri Thai comes very close, which is very high praise.",Sri Thai Thai Restaurant,3.5 star rating,$$,Thai

This is not watered down Thai, most of the dishes have a kick, and are not apologetic about it.The Pad-Thai is amazing, probably the best around, we also LOVE the Sri Thai triple delight, Curry with eggplant, chicken basil, and many more... Also worth mentioning are the very good soft shell crab dishes, however this is only if you are eating in (mushy soft shell crab is not appetizing, which is what you get when order this to home...)our biggest gripes with Sri Thai are:* They are closed on Teusdays* Portions are on the smallish side (and even more so when it comes to the rice portion)* At times it's hard to get them on the phone...",Sri Thai Thai Restaurant,3.5 star rating,$$,Thai

Luckily, off of 3rd and Bloomfield, there's Sri Thai.Though not the trendiest little nook, I'd rate it the most solid, especially during lazy Sunday afternoons when you're not in the mood for a traditional brunch. It's a small joint with a tiny bathroom and close tables, but you're not here for decor - you want to take the edge off that    Saturday night/Sunday morning hangover with food, silly!I don't remember what we started with, but both appetizers were fried bits of yumminess served up with their appropriate dipping sauce and a milky-sweet thai iced tea. But our entrees really shined - his chicken/onion/peppers/veggie stir-fry dish was nicely done, while my shrimp/veggie/eggplant in green curry blew my mind.

But it's really filthy, don't ask to use the bathroom! i ordered a dish and asked for not spicy. It came spicy but with several shrimps, and when I returned it, I got two shrimp back in the milder dish and almost an eye roll. It was an expensive dish - over $20 and i would not have ordered it if I couldn't have gotten it made mild. So, when I complained I couldn't eat it, that the chef didn't get the message not to make it hot, I swear something went wrong in translation, because, I went home that night, never so sick in my life, the next day. Can you say food poisoning? This never happened to me before and my party spent a lot of money there that night. It's just not about the customer here. i became sick for several days after, actually. Got the basil chicken - never again! I gave it two stars because I have had excellent fried spring rolls here on other occasions and the pad thai has never given me any problems.

When I want a Thai fix in this city (I only work in Hoboken so it's generally for lunch), my default is Sri Thai. I usually get the Pad See Euw.That said, the service definitely has room for improvement. I usually get take-out here, and unless I specifically remembered to ask for it, they have never provided me with eating utensils or napkins, they just give the food and that's it. Once I ordered takeout with a friend and he ordered Thai Iced Tea, and instead of a normal cup, it simply came in an awkwardly squat soup container. So if you order from this place, expect them to cut corners.

Between that and gra praw (chili-basil sauce) your taste buds will light up.....and will be hot for many hours afterwards. My girlfriend had a dish with ginger which wasn't listed as an ingredient and neither of us liked it much due to that. They should list strong ingredients like that in the description. Seems like would've been pretty good without ginger. Disappointingly we also ordered a shrimp dish for $14 that only came with 5 average size shrimp. Booooo!!  Anyway......I usually do takeout or delivery.
