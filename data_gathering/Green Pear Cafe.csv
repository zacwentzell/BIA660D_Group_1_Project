This was my first time at the Green Pear Cafe so when I walked in, I couldn't help but notice how adorable it was. There was someone behind the counter but they seemed busy so I patiently waited and looked around at the mugs for sale for a few mins. She abruptly asks me, ""What do you need?"" I thought that was a weird way to greet someone in the morning right after they walked in the door. I told her I was picking up an order. She then abruptly asks me, ""Cash or card?"" Mind you, still no hello or anything. As I was paying, they were staring at the screen when the tip options came up which made me feel so uncomfortable. Who stares when you're entering a tip? I felt forced to over tip for a pick-up order that was already costing me over $30 (the egg white omelette I ordered was around $19 and my boyfriend's three hard boiled eggs, salmon, and dill sour cream was about $16, we also got two coffees). I grabbed my items and left, wrongfully assuming my entire order was in the bag. I got home and noticed the coffees were not in the bag, my mistake for not checking. I had to go back one more time to grab my coffees. They were apologetic which I understand. It happens.The food was ok but not worth $30+ for what we ordered. The coffee is not good. I don't think they've cleaned their coffee pots in ages or something because the coffee is insanely bitter. I wanted to love this place so much.

I ordered orange juice, a dirty chai, and a veggie omelette and went to sit outside. The dirty chai they served me wasn't a latte, which dirty chai usually is (chai latte with a shot of espresso). Instead, theirs was just chai with espresso in it. Meh.Then they brought my veggie omelette. It was served open-faced with a sort of salad on top-- arugula and tomatoes. From what I could tell, the veggies inside the omelette included some bell peppers and zucchini, but not much of them. Weirdest of all, the cheese was sprinkled on top instead of mixed into the omelette, so it wasn't fully melted. It was disappointing but I ate it.All of this might have been okay if not for their tables. Their outside tables are cast iron with a fancy design but nothing on top, so the delicate glasses they gave me for my chai and orange juice were perched precariously on top. At the end of my meal when I was finishing my orange juice, I must have nudged the table because the chai glass tipped over and my remaining half of chai splashed through the table onto my bag and white jeans. I honestly don't remember touching the table or chai glass, that's how little effort it took to knock it over. Those open tables are just a terrible idea and the glasses they give you don't help.

Initially, the atmosphere is unique and cute, with blankets outside if you get a little chilly and a back room indoors for main seating. When you walk in, it looks like its going to be counter serve but behind the counter is where they make all the food. Our servers were nice enough, but brought limes instead of lemon and didn't come back for us to ask for lemons. The food is what prompted this review... the dosa is so dry that you can barely cut through it, and the prosciutto pesto combination was so salty that I could not drink enough water after. The ham omelette was both overcooked and over greasy at the same time. Mango lassi was okay also.

We were seated at a tiny little table and didn't really have enough room for all of our plates and food. This definitely made it a challenge to navigate the utensils and a couple bites landed on the floor because of it. I would recommend the dosas! The egg dishes looked good too, but the dosas are fun and fresh. And some of them have a lot of cheese which is always a good thing. Even though it was a busy day, the staff was very friendly.

The only downside was that the air conditioner unit exhaust was blowing out the window right next to my head at the outdoor table. We're not talking a light breeze here, it was really blowing.

The staff has been friendly and helpful and I have enjoyed everything on the menu, both food and drinks. I like the atmosphere and the proximity to my house. It had become a go-to for meetings and a nice quiet place to get a little writing done.Unfortunately Green Pear has recently changed its policy and no longer lets patrons stay more than 45 minutes. I was verbally informed of this policy after it was clear that my meeting was over and my drink was empty and would not be making another purchase. At this time, there were only two other customers present in the store, and there was plenty of other seating available.They have a limited amount of seating and I understand the need to be respectful of traffic flow and certainly patrons should be aware especially during busy hours not to abuse the space, but as a paying customer I believe a business should clearly establish their expectations (put a clear sign up on the wall or at each table) and leave it to the customer's judgement as to when it is time to leave.While I understand all of this from a cost perspective, my experience today made me feel unwelcome and hesitant to return as a patron.",Green Pear Cafe,4.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Cafes,, Creperies"

I ordered a flat white but the owner said he was going to make me a cappuccino instead. Whatever, I'm not picky and it was damn good. A double shot of quality espresso is perfect to get you up and running! The breakfast sandwich I got was actually quite tasty. While they don't have a full on grill, they made it fresh in some type of machine. While that was weird, it was delicious nevertheless so why complain?

Their cafe beverages (cappuccino etc) are perfect, their breakfast items are delicious and perfectly portioned (Italians don't eat a huge breakfast), their smoothies and juices are refreshing and their treats are something to dream about (especially the mini tarts)! The smallest touches make such a difference (such as homemade almond milk - yum, and the fruit parfait with mango purée). The Italian products they carry are also amazing.

77,brAMK1-9Vdi4n_9BM1d9eQ,Nicholas K.,3.0 star rating,"3.5 starsCool, quaint little cafe. I'll start by saying that it appears they are more geared toward the grab and go crowd (for breakfast, at least) despite their outdoor seating - seems that the area is meant for sitting down at after you've grabbed a coffee or food item. Clearly a family run shop - very friendly bunch, and my order was taken and served by what appeared to be the owner's daughter.Let me start with, although I didn't get any coffee, I am picky with that, and they advertise using only Lavazza - my favorite beans, so major plus. Now, being my first time here, I kinda pigged out to try different items. First, if you're into yogurt, definitely get their yogurt with granola and mango pulp ($5) - it's crazy fresh and a great value, I'd come back for that alone. I also got the salmon on naan with dill sour cream ($8). This was also delicious - the naan was also super fresh, coming out on the plate nice and warm. I will say that there definitely could've been more salmon with only two pieces on the naan - queue the ""well it was only $8!"" arguments. Yes I agree, great price, but I regularly get fat bagels stacked with much more salmon in the same price range - some food for thought (pardon the pun). Finally I got their peanut butter smoothie ($5) - this was OK, certainly not a highlight. Taste was light on peanut butter, and the smoothie itself was kind of watery.Service was pretty slow, and I wasn't told until I asked for a check some time later that you had to pay inside at their square terminal - no problem, just wish I knew. Also wasn't offered a water, which may have been because I ordered a smoothie (still would've liked one), but I didn't actually get the smoothie until I was finished my yogurt and salmon naan. I actually saw people walk in after I ordered my smoothie, and walk out with a smoothie of their own far sooner than I received mine. These are the points that made me realize it's more of a grab and go place. Don't mean to be picky, I'm sure some of my points seem that way, but as the first review I wanted to be honest and detailed.

I bring my 3 month old son her and sit in the back and really love it. BUT today I was meeting a friend and I believe it was the owner- a woman- first goes up to another girl sitting at a table and told her she had to leave because she was there too long. You are a coffee shop. People sit there. You don't tell your customers to leave. There was no one even waiting to get in there - if there was then just maybe then you could ask nicer to leave. THEN my friend walks in with her baby carriage and told me I couldn't leave mine where it was because I was blocking the bathroom. However, I have done this about 5 times before and people can still get in. I would be happy to move it if someone wanted to use the restroom and had trouble getting in. So I said I can't put my stroller on the other side of the room with the baby in it and said we are just going to leave. This is not how you treat your customers. There are nice ways of handling things. I do love the coffee and smoothies, but I liked the customer service. I loved the husband, the other bearded guy behind the counter, and the young boy, BUT you my dear are mean and will lose customers. There are plenty of coffee shops around.

Croissants were flaky and soft. Brownie was hard and dry. Fruit cup with something sprinkled on top was really good with a nice variety of fruits.

I stopped in one day after work and had one of the best cups of coffee I've ever had. Smooth and delicious. I was also pleased to find that not only do they have food, coffee, pastries and Italian cookies, but they also have a little grocery selection with some really interesting items. I got a jar of fantastic pesto. The cafe offers a very interesting mix of menu items and the owners tell me that they are Eastern European and Italian, which may explain why. Great brunch spot, great place for a good coffee, and great spot to stop in to buy something interesting to cook for dinner or bring to a dinner party. So happy to have The Green Pear in Hoboken!",Green Pear Cafe,4.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Cafes,, Creperies"

97,Wmc6JyVF27py7VrBhM2s6w,Rose N.,5.0 star rating,A great addition to the neighborhood! We were walking home from dinner and happen to notice this place. Honestly I had no idea it was there. We walked in as they were getting ready to close up. We were welcomed into this cute place by the owner Isabella who couldn't be any nicer. The vibe was such that we felt as if we were at the home of a dear friend. The baked goods looked amazing and they have some gourmet treats on the shelves as well. My husband bought a jar of duck fat that really excited him. I am so happy to have found this place and can't wait to go in the morning for tea.You must stop by and say hello!,Green Pear Cafe,4.5 star rating,$$,"Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Cafes,, Creperies"
