The buffalo chicken wrap was delicious. Very spicy, much spicier than I expected, so just watch out for that kick. My boyfriend thought his chicken pot pie was okay. Didn't think the ingredients tasted the freshest. Overall, good place to eat.

Especially after serving me as Moscow Mule- which 100% had no alcohol in it! My meal was so bad, and so over priced! I'm not sure what the worst part of my experience was, but the lack of alcohol in my drink definitely left the biggest impression!

63,XrYdP_2wdYxbiqyXpbqhvQ,Joel P.,4.0 star rating,"This Irish bar is somehow very corporate, but does have its charms. It's difficult to write a review on Dorrian's without any extreme bias as it was here where I watched my Cubbies destroy with the Cardinals in game 3 of the NLDS. Go Cubs, Go! Game aside, I had low expectations for this bar coming in, but I was happily surprised with my experience.Met my buddy after work by the Newport station off the PATH. Yelp-ed the closest bar in the area and Dorrian's came up. Had some hesitancies initially after reading some of the negative reviews, but at that time, watching the game ASAP was the priority. Came into the bar and was immediately pleased with what I saw - huge space, various tables, a ton of TVs, and a large projector. The peak times at this bar are probably weekday happy hours and the clientele are mostly yuppies working in the surrounding corporate offices. That said, the male to female ratio in the place is probably like 80/20. While the general vibe may not be for everybody, I was more than fine with it.One thing the Yelpers got right was the food and drink -- it's on the pricey side, especially given that it's Jersey City and not Manhattan. Though I was happy that they had a Goose Island IPA on tap (gotta rep Chi-town), so that was my beer of choice for the evening. My buddy and I split the pupu platter and the buffalo wings. Again, really wasn't expecting much, but it was pretty solid, above-average bar food. The service is what earned this place that 4th star. Our waitress was friendly, accommodating, and always right there when we needed another round. And when I asked if there was an place to plug my phone, she was more than happy to walk with me to the outlet by the service station, and even plugged my phone in for me. The little things like that always go a long way in my book. Overall, a pretty decent choice to watch the game or just grab a couple of drinks after work. Worth a visit if you're in the area.",Dorrian’s Red Hand,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

It is a more comfortable and low-key option than most of the chains in the area (unless you visit during a game on TV.) I'd recommend the weekend brunch. It's a typical menu, but the food is good.

I've been to Dorrian's twice before at Passport To Newport events, so I was familiar and happy to come back as a customer. We received a friendly greetings and choice of table or booth. We cozied up in a booth and before long a waiter approached to ask if we were ready for drinks. I don't recall his name but i'm pretty sure that's because he didn't introduce himself. My honey got a Hendricks on the rocks with olives. He prefers cucumbers so I asked why he got olives and he said ""Because they always tell me they don't have cucumbers. They must, in the kitchen, but won't get them for me"". (Note: none of the menu salads have cucumber so maybe they really don't. Either way, I wouldn't keep coming to a bar that won't make my preferred drink but he's more forgiving than me, clearly. ) I got the grilled chicken cobb and a moscow mule. Both were serviceable and the salad was surprisingly good. The cobb does not come with egg - I hate eggs so was glad I didn't have to ask for the salad to be altered, but anyone looking for an authentic cobb will be disappointed. He got wings. No complaints so I guess they were fine. Overall: Food was serviceable, Service was average - not particularly friendly but adequate. Wouldn't come here for date night again but might be a good option for hanging with friends.

I came here on a whim with my boyfriend one night about a month ago, and it has quickly become one of my favorite haunts.Important to note: you can get ice cream here. Don't ask me why I wanted ice cream in bone-chilling temperatures in the middle of December. The heart wants what it wants. Astonishingly, it's on their late-night bar menu. For $5, you get an overflowing bowl here, even if you order at midnight. Now on to the good stuff: the drinks here are phenomenal. I generally order a dirty martini here, and they get it right every time. I like mine ""Boston Harbor dirty"", and it's always on point.  The food here is amazing, as well. I haven't been able to pull myself away from the buffalo chicken wrap and house-made french fries, but I will be able to soon. I came here recently a few minutes before the kitchen opened for lunch, and their server still sat me down, got me settled with my (non-alcoholic) beverage, and my meal ticket in once the kitchen opened. She could have easily told me to wait outside that day until they opened, but letting me come in and get out of the rain was much appreciated!Finally, I've seen the owner floating around a few times, and he is a very lovely character.

He poured it right in front of us and there was a shed load of vodka in that glass.The place says that they have an Irish them and I guess that they think offering Guinness on tap and having Fish & Chips on the menu solves that for them. I really did think that the Shepherd's Pie would be a good choice - the menu said that it was topped with Au Gratin style potatoes, but it was mashed potatoes instead. Super hot, it must have spent a good while under the broiler. Most of the dish was potatoes, but there was a thin layer of seasoned ground beef under there somewhere.

110,AMwi8hd_x9HcrpS4OsKiiw,James R.,3.0 star rating,"Sometimes my work requires me to go above and beyond.  On this particular Monday, the challenge at hand reared its head around 11:30 when the office manager announced to all assembled that they were going to do Friday on Monday.  Even though I wasn't an employee and subject to these type of things, I've found it best to go along to get along at times like this.  And since we had already put in a grueling 90 minutes of 'work,' it did seem like a perfect time to get away and recharge.Friday on Monday basically means that the entire office is going to wander the two blocks up the street, sit down at an outdoor Irish place, and consume beers (emphasis on the plural) from liter mugs.  And try to work some actual food into the mix as well.Since it was Irish, Fish and Chips it was.  And it was.  Deep fried battered fish and french fries.  All very tasty too, I might add.  Then again, when liters (again, emphasis on the plural) of beer are involved, the night watchman's socks tossed in the deep frier for a few minutes would be tasty as well.The somewhat odd part of the experience, though, was the service.  It was almost too good and attentive.  Apparently they must have some sort of plate shortage because one of the staff kept coming by trying to clear away plates before we were actually done consuming the contents thereof.  Maybe they were fearful that we were going to hurl them into lunchtime pedestrian traffic along Washington Blvd.  In any case, though, the staff did fully respect the liters (again, emphasis on the plural) and didn't attempt to withdraw them before the contained fluid was fully consumed.After the protracted lunch hours (gratuitous use of plurals), we paid the check and struck a heading in the general direction of the office, mostly succeeding by tacking against a sudden strong sustained wind that caused us all to veer and wobble off course at various parts of the voyage.  Perseverance ruled the day, however, and we put ashore at the front door. When we got back to our cubicle, work really didn't seem like such an exciting way to spend the afternoon (what was left of it), so we decided that enough is enough and made vague promises to put in extra effort the next day (a lie as soon as the utterance crossed our lips).I'm a fan of Dorrian's, but a much bigger fan of Friday on Monday.",Dorrian’s Red Hand,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

Great beer choices, too.In the summer, it's nice to sit outside with a beer and relax.Service has always been great, with food and drinks coming out promptly and never any issues.My one complaint is that this place is dead on the weekends, and it's not very crowded later in the evenings, either. This is really no fault of Dorrian's, because they largely cater to the throngs of office workers in the Newport area - but after around 8pm on a weeknight, it's a ghost town.Nevertheless, I'm glad I have an Irish pub practically in my backyard and I look forward to many more upcoming visits.",Dorrian’s Red Hand,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

First couple of tiMes i thought their service was just ok, not too bad not to good. I know their service takes little bit more time then usual but was bareable. my last visit to this place was horrible n Totally changed my view for this place.  I usally give couple of tries before I write my reviews. Usually I sit on the high tables by bar but this time we grabbed chairs by the bar. I had to ask the bartender for menu (first red flag), also I was just asking the bar tender for info on their desert menu n wanted to know if its good for one person.  N the bartender placed the order without even my knowledge if I really wanted to order the desert. I had to cancle the order bc it was not something I wanted bc it was for two ppl. I was only asking him for info, So I got yelled at. N he gave me an attitude... not my fault, I never said ""I wanna order this item"" . I thought it was a really bad customer services on their part. Dorrians has Very inexpereience ppl who dont know to be nice with their customers.  Next we ordered some food and we had to tell the server twice bc our food didnt come for about 30-40mins. They servers never came back to ask if my food n drinks are ok n if I needed anything else. .....very very bad customer service. I feel like servers dont do their job properly, they dont care about their customers. If I was an auditor ill def not give any stars to this place......very unwelcoming environment.  Feels like they are all working just enough to keep the place running but dont care enough about their customers arounds them. Bar tenders are more interested in talking n watching tv. Also,  when we asked to validate our parking tickets, the lady at the bar gave us bad validated parking tickets which never worked. They played their customers. I m not angry. ....I m pissed at the management for hiring lousy ppl who don't not know how to treat their customers nicely, so they would come back again.  After a long day we go to some place where we feel warm n welcoming so ppl come back again but not this place.  Sorry to say this but I didn't like how me n my friends were treated. Apart from their service one thing I would wanna say is their food pretty good. Couple of weeks ago I was their with my friend and orderdd hummus, nachos n quesadillas ..... very yummy.  Well I hope this review will help ppl decide if what they want, when they come too this place.  I deff want good food n good service.

Until  I went to Dorrian's on Thanksgiving!The manager seated us and he seemed like we were a bother for coming in(mind you it wasn't remotely close to shutting down the kitchen for the evening and it's not like we were the only customers). Then our waitress, Maggie, was horrible. She was rude, thoughtless, didn't bring us what we wanted even after voicing our concerns about a food item and every time we needed something we looked 15 feet to our left and she was at the bar socializing while she should have been watching her tables. I know it sucks to have to work on Thanksgiving or any holiday, it does, but it comes with the territory. I saw the bussers more than I saw our waitress. I would have felt more comfortable giving the small tip we gave to Maggie, to the bussers. They were attentive, got us refills, were polite and cleared our table. When we were ready for our bill, it took 20 minutes for our waitress to stop her jabbering and cash us out completely. The other sad part, two managers and another waiter passed us several times and we made eye contact each time to see if they'd ask if we needed anything and needless to say, no one stopped. That's ridiculous. Especially on a holiday. The attitudes of the staff were unacceptable for a normal day.On another note, the food was decent. I really like the potato skins but past that it was less than mediocre. I will not be returning here when I visit again and warning if you go there I'd ask specifically not to be sat in Maggie's section.",Dorrian’s Red Hand,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

Entrees hit the spot especially in winter with items like shepard's pie. I don't know how good the entrees are because I don't go here thinking ill get a steak.  Went recently for brunch and eggs were cooked perfectly. Considering the pricing, I think the sandwiches are priced correctly. Everything is made there. I'm not sure how much people think a burger should cost, but I think it's fine at $10.95. The apps are a little pricey, but I think it's because they are generally large and priced a little higher to account for people who are just getting wings and beers.",Dorrian’s Red Hand,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

Waiter asked us if everything was ok and we told him about the shitty service. He looked at us in a puzzled manner and asked if we would like to reorder. After an hour we couldn't wait so we said it would do. He then ignored us for the rest of the time there and we had to ask 4 times to get our bill. We left a dollar tip and we will never be coming back there again. I ordered the chicken wrap which is usually decent. On this occasion apart from being cold was filled with bones and a dry taste.

Food was good but service was unacceptable.I do not mean to come off hung up on this single issue, but in all my years of dining I have never had the following happen.At the time my table was placing our orders I specifically asked the waitress as to what was included with the price of the meal. When the check arrived there were extra charges for a side order. When asking the waitress politely about this charge addition she didn't acknowledge that I had the very specific conversation of what was included with the entree in the first place. I next asked to speak with the managers of the restaurant in private. They responded to my story with the excuse of ""we do not tell customers about any extra charges since we don't want to offend customers by telling them it will be only $5 more. We have had people say to us, 'what, do you not think I can afford $5'"". This excuse is not appropriate, especially because I had specifically asked about prices beforehand. Regardless, from a business-principles perspective this excuse is completely incorrect and ignores the ideas of price transparency and ""you know what you're paying for"" fundamentals. Both the waitress and managers refused to correct the bill or apologize for the ""disagreement"" on how they should manage their sales and price transparency. This lack of business principle is unacceptable in my opinion.When you dine at a restaurant you should do so to not only support great food but great service, people, and management - clearly Dorrian's has some work to do in the latter areas.",Dorrian’s Red Hand,3.5 star rating,$$,"Bars,, American, (Traditional),, Venues, &, Event, Spaces"

He kept acknowledging me and acting as if I would be next. Finally I just kept asking for my credit card, I had opened a tab, and he kept ignoring me. I had to jump in front of other customers that were next to me to get the bartender to give me my credit card back. I even explained what happened to the manager, and all he could say was that they had more customers than what they were expecting, as if this was going to make the whole situation acceptable.
