0,aneE78ZYDtAq_0563yo5WA,William K.,5.0 star rating,I've tried Wafels and Dinges now at a few of their locations around New York City and each time they've delivered a delicious sweet treat for under $10. Their waffles go well with their various sweet toppings such as ice cream or the s'mores flavored waffle pictured here. Some may find their products a bit small for $9 or $10 a waffle but I have found each version I've tried so far to be excellent. They have a number of stands around the city and if in the mood for a tasty indulgence one day it's well worth a try.,Wafels and Dinges,3.0 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
1,JCn-W-dQwbMyPGNOYC5zkg,Ryan R.,4.0 star rating,"Went here with some friends to grab a snack to eat after a walk along the west side highway.After looking through the menu, I decided to get the throwdown wafel, which came with speculoos cookie butter and whipped cream. The wafel itself was pretty large and definitely rich with the speculoos cookie butter. I was pretty hungry so I was able to finish most of it, but it could easily be split between two people.This place serves up some decent snacks at a semi-high price point, but the setting is top notch.",Wafels and Dinges,3.0 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
2,VEnTFBjJMNuS_Rq-PUjSnQ,Sarah M.,4.0 star rating,"The waffles itself was  fresh, and delicious. The whipped cream was overly sweet though. The price is also pretty high. $9 for one waffle with whipped cream and strawberries seems like a bit much. It is in a great location. I highly recommend coming here to relax and watch the water. We got our waffles and took them out into the pier to watch the sun setting.",Wafels and Dinges,3.0 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

My mom doesn't like regular waffles but loves these especially with chocolate sauce & strawberries. Bacon is usually floppy so that's the only thing is avoid. Specloos icecream is good too.",Wafels and Dinges,3.0 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

7,SAdaplQCuUekV2yd6X7njg,Myra H.,5.0 star rating,"As a long-standing fan, I'm so glad that Wafels and Dinges opened this new location just in time for the summer!The location is right on Pier 45, with beautiful views of the water, New Jersey, and the Freedom Tower. It is all outdoor, so perfect for when it's nice out. There is really cute outdoor seating with tables, chairs, umbrellas, flower pots, and string lights and it is good for small or large groups!They have a full food and drink menu with dessert waffles, sandwiches, bar snacks, and beer & wine. We just ordered some beer and fries and sat outside on a warm night - it was a perfect date spot and ideal atmosphere for when you want to enjoy the nice weather with friends. I definitely plan on coming back to try the food menu and eat one of my favorite waffles!I think this location of Wafels and Dinges will be super popular this summer - it's a beautiful location to impress your out-of-town friends or take someone on a date. Would highly highly recommend for lunch, dessert, or drinks.",Wafels and Dinges,3.0 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

9,SZzyiY8QCw6_KYJKbs0kvw,B C.,3.0 star rating,"If I had just gone here for drinks or dessert this place would get 5 stars. But we were there around lunchtime, and saw that they had burgers and salads on the menu, so decided to get some real food before ordering a waffle (which was amazing, btw). Basically, don't bother getting real food here. It is overpriced for what it actually is. We tried the turkey burgers, which was definitely frozen (or at least tasted like it was). It is definitely not worth the 8$ price tag. The regular burger looked just as sad. The salad is just iceberg lettuce with a cherry tomato or two. Potato chips on the side. Fries looked decent, though.So, come here for dessert, the waffles and ice cream are delicious and worth the money. Go off of the pier to get real lunch, though",Wafels and Dinges,3.0 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

11,kaYTADyi7XwwYMqA3WKePQ,Carlos L.,1.0 star rating,Nice looking place great location horrible food ! Ordered a regular burger no cheese. The order came out and the burger was cold and so was the slice of cheese on it. I told the bartender that could not stick to taking one persons order at a time to them ask what was it that I wanted. I told him that I thought I was clear about no cheese on it. He went around the side with the burger to tell the chef.  Not knowing I followed him and I stood by the end of the bar to up serve what was going on with my food . I watch him tell the chef the chef's way of fixing it was to grab my burger with his bare hands and remove the cheese and shrugged his shoulders. My first and last time there ! Never again.,Wafels and Dinges,3.0 star rating,$,"Belgian,, Waffles,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"
