And boy does Potatopia have ways...I love all their ways to make potatoes and the vast selections of toppings and potatoes.This is one of my fave go to spots for food in the Newport Center Mall. I ordered one to stay and one for the road...yes, I did!! Okay the one I sat down in the food court with was Mango Drink w Sweet Potato, BBQ Pulled Pork, Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Scallions etc,etc....Can you say DELICIOUS?! OMG and so fulfilling...I won't need anything else for the night.I order a potato and another drink to go as well. This order was mashed potatoes spicy beef smoked gouda trimmings and mushroom beef gravy with strawberry lemonade. What a piece of potato lovers heaven on earth!!!The Mango drink was made from real mango purée I can tell not watered down drink mix or concentrate. The pulled pork was perfect and has a sweet, spicy smokey flavour that is totally southern style....soooo good slow cooked.Now this is the way I like my Mall food court fast food with real home made tastes to it...I highly recommend coming to this spot and guess what they have an app and you can gather points towards your next purchases...and I think that's just great!Well, time to go I'm stuffed...like a potato;)",Potatopia,4.0 star rating,$,"Fast, Food"
1,v7qJv45x3--yXsvzZH_w0A,Sarah A.,3.0 star rating,This place looked promising at first but honestly i was a bit disappointed .  I ordered the smashed red potatoes which by the way are fried (did not know as i was trying to avoid all the other fried options but dislike baked potatoes). I was annoyed they were fried but that's my error. If i would have  known they were all fried i would have just got the tater tots. Anyways when it was time to pick the protein i asked for chicken tikka. No joke they gave me a tablespoon of protein. My food was 95 percent potatoes and chipotle aoili  and 5 percent protein and veggies. I dont know if i just came at a weird time but honestly will probably not come back. Food tasted fine though. Only thing I'd ever buy from here again is the mango lemonade. So good! Other then that don't be so stingy with toppings and protein . I paid 10 bucks for a bowl of mainly potatoes .,Potatopia,4.0 star rating,$,"Fast, Food"

You can create a ton of different combinations using their choices of potatoes (red skinned are my favorite), preparation method, meat toppings, veggie toppings, dressing, and cheese. It's also worth noting that you can have as many of the non-meat toppings as your heart desires. I got smashed, deep fried red skins with beef, all the toppings, roasted red pepper aoli, and cheese whiz. It was out of this world! Came back again and got the Cajun shrimp, smashed red skin potato, whiz, chipotle aoli. Insanely good!!The only downside with this place is that they're slow to the point of being unsustainable. A lot of times, people get impatient and leave, so the line is usually not too long. Also, their ordering system is a bit awkward and confusing.

I love the concept of a potato-themed restaurant, but this just really doesn't have it working. You start off with a choice of potato, which they then prepare in a dish. The dish is rather undersized, so the potato really isn't that generous. It's pretty much a given you will not be getting potato in every bite. So much for the theme. You then add a protein - or more, for a fee - though apparently the $.99 fee isn't universal, because I was definitely upcharged a few cents beyond that. Then you add a bunch of free toppings. You can have as many as you want, but just ordering about 10 of 14, the dish was already overflowing. This is what I mean by ""rather undersized."" In fact, the total meal didn't even fill me up, despite being heaped precariously and barely shoved into its plastic container. The strawberry lemonade had separated with the fruit on the bottom, but no convenient way to shake or stir without it splashing out.On to the eating experience. My first few bites were surprisingly flavorless. The garlic aioli wasn't very garlicky, and I pretty much had to get a bite of salsa to get anything going. Most of the toppings were just plain raw or cooked veggies, it seemed. Not really any salt in the dish. The smoked gouda topping would have been nice if they had been able to put a little more on it, but it was completely lost with the thin layer they had to carefully sprinkle on top of the undersized dish. Toward the end, the cajun shrimp picked up some of the flavor, indicating that the whole dish was not arranged uniformly (it was about 70% uniform, but there were pockets of ingredients). I was surprised by the blandness.2 stars for the food. Extra star for the relatively good value, especially if you bring your own drink, as well as the freshness of the ingredients.

41,X7zFb01W-DFPxP66fguQVQ,Steph B.,2.0 star rating,"The food gets 5 stars, the staff gets 2 stars.They must've jacked their prices up a dollar since a couple weeks ago, because I ended up paying $1.30 more for the identical dish. When I questioned them about this they asked if I was sure I was at their specific location. I work in the next building and have been to this place over 10 times. I'm pretty sure I would know which Potatopia I went to. Then they said maybe I was thinking of a different dish. Nope, I've literally gotten the same thing every single time I've been here. AND I've ALWAYS gotten extra sour cream without paying extra and last time I went, I paid then asked for sour cream and the woman refused to give me extra without paying the extra $0.30. Sorry, I'm not giving you my card again for $0.30. Especially when I've never been charged extra. That's ridiculous and so inconsistent. It's only extra if you're getting an additional sauce!The food is great, but I don't think I can deal with the people they have working there anymore. Lunch isn't meant to be frustrating! And the fact that this place had to jack up their prices by $1 means they probably won't be here too long anyway!",Potatopia,4.0 star rating,$,"Fast, Food"

48,Z_sXDf1CKnVjlb0iHkh8NA,Alex M.,5.0 star rating,"LOVE LOVE LOVE! I love everything about this place! The potato based concept is unique and delicious. Their toppings and proteins are not like the toppings you see in delis salad bars you can clearly see the difference in quality. I personally went for the sweet potato fries with a bunch of toppings which are all included and went ham on the protein... Added chicken, bacon and shrimp all delicious but became pricey. For a quick lunch dish with a drink it was slightly over $15 bucks but that's because I am not a fan of sauce and cheeses so I had to replace it with shrimp and bacon. The 2 girls in front of me made their dishes for under $10. not sure if they got one protein or any at all but seemed like a full dish. This place gets thumbs up all around. Service. Price. Experience and most importantly the TASTE!",Potatopia,4.0 star rating,$,"Fast, Food"

You can choose their signature combos or you can make one of your own( chipotle style). Choose the type of potato you want then add veggies cheese sauces and proteins. They have signature veggie combos as well. Really YUM though I'm sure sure they are packed with calories. But will definitely try again.

55,VlP_CGUQ8GSouTaKMKlJUA,Nicholas B.,5.0 star rating,"Love the concept of potato and chicken. Love the concept of a BAKED SWEET Potato even more. The staff here is great. It is not a conventional meal so it takes a minute to get used too, but the staff is helpful and will let you try different combos so you can find what fits your mood best. After stopping by a couple times the staff remembers my name and my order.The order i have settled in on is ""I think therefore i yam"" but instead of sweet fries i get a sweet baked and add broccoli to the meal (No Charge). Trying to find complex carbs on the go can be hard and finding complex carbs that are not fried is even harder. On days when i like to hit the gym there is nothing better than baked sweet potato with roasted chicken and all the veggies you can handle. Overall good value, i am stuffed after the meal and it cost about $8.25.. Plus they added a loyalty program which is basically 10% off. I will definitely keep coming back",Potatopia,4.0 star rating,$,"Fast, Food"

The tall and the short girl behind the counter need to be given an excessive training on the basics of customer service..be it customer friendliness or proper communication. Few other customers voiced out the exact same issues. It's going to go on a downhill unless they get the service right. As for me,not that they'll care,but I'll stick to the locations in NYC! If you still want to give it a try,go for the food and look right past the two disgruntled - looking girls behind the counter. They are a killjoy honestly.",Potatopia,4.0 star rating,$,"Fast, Food"
