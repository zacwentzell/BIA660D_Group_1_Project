Unfortunately, I do not remember all of the drink names/ingredients (not online either) but all were delicious. My wife ordered a prosecco cocktail a couple times because she loved it. I started off with a bourbon cocktail which was well balanced and tasty. I then ordered a mezcal cocktail which was suggested by our awesome bartender Salvador. The drink included charred pineapple, chili bitters and a chipotle/salted rim. It was a lovely combination of smoky, salty and spicy. As I mentioned I was extremely impressed with Salvador. He was a true professional taste testing just about every drink and adjusting if needed to match the perfect flavor profile. He also was nice enough to give us a small taste of their punch for that evening which was delicious. If we find ourselves back in the West Village we will be sure to stop in for drinks and dinner this time!",The Warren,4.0 star rating,$$,Gastropubs

7,z7jmxm0_Sxe2nNu-98iMuw,Simon B.,4.0 star rating,"I visited last week for the short rib poutine, being a fan of the French-Canadian delicacy that gets me to discover unique restaurants and reminisce about home. Poutine is french fries, cheese curds, and gravy. You need all three. The gravy provides the salt makes the cheese melt onto the fries , which provide the carbs and the cheese provides the fat. It's an explosion. For some Quebecois like me, poutine is just as serious business as a good pizza is to a New Yorker. And, it seems, many parallels in their quality can be drawn. The setup with the three ingredients needs to, be right. Just like having a good crust, tomato sauce, and fresh cheese, it doesn't matter for a pizza how good your toppings are if don't get those right: if you don't put enough (or too much) sauce, if there's no cheese, or if the crust isn't right. That's sort of what happened here. Nice crisp fries, delicious short rib, but almost no gravy (all absorbed in the meat) and like 2 pieces of cheese. So sure, it was a fun appetizer and the short rib was delicious, but I was expecting more. But then, at $14 a tiny cup, perhaps it sells better as poutine than ""short rib on top of fries""?  Of course I did like the rest of my visit, including the draft selection, feel of the place and the stuff (why it gets still 4 stars). I just wouldn't go out of my way for the poutine again.",The Warren,4.0 star rating,$$,Gastropubs

Would recommend getting the fried chicken and grilled octopus for sure.While there I tried the fried chicken, grilled octopus, short rib poutine, black pepper fettuccine, fries, brussel sprouts, pickles, and the charcuterie board. The only things I thought weren't super worth it were the fries and short rib poutine. I thought those things were pretty standard and could be found at most restaurants.

9,BHznma4pJ6VVtU4rIGUzSA,Ashley L.,5.0 star rating,"The gist: The Warren is a trendy restaurant and bar with substance, backed up by the impeccable staff and delicious food and drinks. The ambiance: The restaurant is designed on the verge of hipster but without the airs of condescension. Everything is stylish and yet still relatable. The bathroom is incredible, housing a funhouse style mirror and some tasteful artwork of nude women. It's also huge and clean, which is hard to find in New York. The food: Not a single complaint at the table. We went for dinner at 5:30, and were impressed with the happy hour specials, which hosted plenty of half-off appetizers, $7 house punch, and some wine specials. A member of our party had a garlic allergy, and when we came in the chef had already prepared a list of food that she could eat safely. Very impressive, above and beyond in fact. We ordered the twice fried chicken and short rib poutine to start. They were both decadent, although the chicken was slightly spicy. For entrees we tried the octopus, flatbread, truffle mac and cheese, and pork belly. Everything was great! We were too full for dessert, and their menu was a bit limited anyway, but might be worth it on a return trip. They also had a $10 burger on Mondays!The service: Supreme. Impressive. No exaggerations, for this moderately sized, packed restaurant, there was one cook, one waiter, and one bartender. It's incredibly the level of service received by these three employees. Drinks were promptly refilled, special requests were accommodated, all while taking care of every other guest with the same level of service.

It can get a bit noisy, and they do tend to like to keep the lights low - so this is really a probably more a small group/romantic spot.Despite being seated in the furthest back corner, we had wonderful attentive service and never felt neglected or rushed. I would even say our server was most attentive to our drink levels, and was a very good salesman to boot!They have a great selection of wines by the glass or bottle, and their cocktails are super fun (lots of inventive ones on the menu, but many of the old mainstays as well) everyone is sure to be pleased.The menu is a wee bit confusing to navigate. They have it split into tapas style dishes and entree style dishes. There aren't that many of either to choose from (maybe 6-8 each?) so I supposed you need to work out with your dinner-mates if you're willing to share or not before you place an order. Every dish we ordered was delicious, and portion sizes were about what we expected, entree portions were sufficient for one person, shared dishes were good for about 3 people. By the time we left around 10pm it was still very well packed and i think the evening drinking crowd was strolling in.

The mini salad that came with the tartare had a really nice citrus and mustard flavor.Since we started out on the small plates track we decided to continue and ordered the grilled octopus and Warren burger to share.

The burger is pretty hefty and I'm a fan of onion jam that it was served with.My main gripe about the food here is not flavor, but portion size.

Nice mix of east coast and west coast. 2) The twice fried chicken was unique and super flavorful. Highly recommend this.3) Poutine was OK, not fantastic. At first bite it seemed too salty but with the short rib and gravy it was a hearty dish.4) Beef tartare was meh, nothing special.5) The pinot noir we got tasted a bit strange, but the cote du rhone was perfect. Overall, a great place for happy hour after work. Will be back again soon!",The Warren,4.0 star rating,$$,Gastropubs

We were early for our reservation but we're offered our table even though the rest of our party wasn't coming for 30 minutes. Good menu lots of choices. Here on yelp it describes the price point as $$ not true. With drinks and wine by the glass at $13- $15 each and a burger at $21.00  more like $$$. Also the place is loud.

42,NjMxnSS43-JLRqAxevfu2Q,Andrew B.,3.0 star rating,"Brought my sister here for her birthday recently. I felt quite confident as 4 star ratings on Yelp for restaurants in the West Village are usually a slam dunk. Perhaps they were having an off night...The fries were well cooked but notably over-salted for everyone at the table. The burger with a sort of onion jam was a bit uncomposed and dry - the buns didn't really stick to the burger, the burger was tall and significantly less wide than the buns, the jam lacked the sweet/savory combo we were hoping for. The asparagus risotto was a bit undercooked so there was still some loose liquid and the arborio was still a bit too al dente. The asparagus flavor was too mild and overall the dish lacked any sort of wow factor.The server was very sweet and fairly prompt, though I dock her a bit for knowing nothing about booze - I asked what they had for scotch, and she began to list bourbon and rye whiskeys. When I looked at the bar myself and ordered a 12 year Glenlivet, she returned a few minutes later to inform me that they had run out.The ambience is cute as the pictures suggest, and overall I think I would give the place another try eventually.

53,i8Vb328o9LzvSpFI4ZLbvw,Molly T.,4.0 star rating,"This spot is as versatile as it gets. Come here for happy hour with your work crew and gather 'round the bar. Come here with a date and sit at one of the cozy tables in back. Come here with a friend for a nice catchup dinner. The West Village really wins for spots like this, and the Warren is no exception. Made a reservation for two at 7pm on a Friday night through Yelp's version of OpenTable. The host had a table for us all ready in the back, but offered us the much better alternative of sitting right by the window if we didn't mind waiting a few minutes. So with the alternative, we went (Yoda would be proud of that sentence). By ""the window"" I mean that you're essentially sitting outside--the storefront is open. So you have the luxury of technically sitting inside while still being able to soak in the lovely summer night (assuming the summer night is, well, lovely). This could actually make for a brilliant exit strategy on a date. Having an awful time? Just slide right out of your chair and you're immediately on the sidewalk. And then you can run. I mean, I really hope there aren't people that cruel out there, but it's fun to imagine, no?So before anything else, I must mention the Warren's *Yelp deal*. Do you ever feel like the places that offer Yelp deals are never the places you'd like to visit? I suppose that's why they offer Yelp deals, though. Anyway, the Warren, along with being a wonderful bar/restaurant, also offers a free Warren punch with a Yelp check-in. Take advantage of this! It's yummy. The only ingredient I remember is Moscato but there's some other stuff, too, Rejoice in free things!I heard the Warren makes a mean burger, but when I find a menu that's appetizer-heavy, I feel that it's my duty (yes I said duty) to take advantage of it. So we opted for small plates. We were planning on ordering 4-5 dishes, but our waiter seemed pretty convinced that this would be way too much food for us. So we went with three. In retrospect, we should gone with four instead of three plus a side, but we assumed (as any sane person would have) that the waiter knew better than us re: portion sizes. Apparently he has an unusually small appetite. In any case, everything we ordered ranged from good to delicious, so there aren't many complaints here. I will say that portions here likely vary greatly depending on what you order--we ordered dishes that were on the lighter side, but had we opted for others, our waiter might've been right on the mark. The damage:Grilled Octopus w/ escarole, caperberries, salsa verde (A)I know people don't follow Yelpers like they do food blogs, but if you happen to have read any of my previous reviews, you'll know that I'm a sucker for octopus. I order it just about everywhere if I see it on the menu. The preparation--though simple--intrigued me, so it was a no-brainer. The octopus was cooked very well--some pieces didn't have that lightly-crisped skin that I so adore, but overall I seriously enjoyed it. The salsa verde made the dish for me--pulled the other ingredients together nicely and made the escarole far more tasty than it would've been on its own. Though I'm not a huge fan of caperberries, they were and interesting addition to the dish. This plate was definitely the winner of the night.Red Snapper Crudo w/ radish, serrano chili, shiso (B+)I'm a sucker for plates that are uber, uber flavorful. This dish, while aesthetically gorgeous, fell a bit short for me. There was nothing ostensibly bad about it, but the snapper itself didn't really hold its own. It could have been seasoned a bit better. That said, this dish as a whole was wonderfully summery. The radishes were seriously delicious, which was unexpected given that radishes typically don't strike a person as exceptional in any particular way. Steak Tartar w/ frisee and grainy mustard (A)Oh, serious yum going on here. My only complaint--a frequent complain for me--was that I wanted more. I get that it's an appetizer but...I just wanted to nix the frisee and double the steak tartare. The meat was light and fluffy as it should be, and the grainy mustard was a beautiful touch. Nice mix of textures and flavors here, which I always appreciate. Crispy Brussels Sprouts (B+) As I mentioned, in retrospect I'd opt for four small plates as opposed to three + one side. But how were we to know? We also had no way of knowing that these brussels sprouts were not going to be in the least bit crispy. I'm a health nut so I suppose I should be happy that these came out ""healthier"" than I expected, but when I order crispy brussels sprouts I expect the proper amount of crisp. Otherwise, these were completely fine. But you're better off forgoing these and ordering something else. Overall, our bill was $66. Very reasonable! Other than a few hiccups (our waiter charged our cards the wrong amount and had to void/redo the transactions), the service was wonderful.

The service in general is  good, our waitress was very friendly, food took a bit of time to come, but not terrible.What I was very confused and not exactly happy about is the portion of some dishes we had and also my main course came very differently than what I asked. We had a dozen of oyster and grilled octopus as appetizer, they both were great. Our wine also came in pretty generous portion. However, when I asked for bread, I was told it's $2, which was fine, but it turned up to be 5 tiny and extremely thin toasted bread, which combined together is probably still smaller than one slice of bread in most of other restaurants in the city. As for main, we order steak and salmon, I asked for my salmon to be cooked as rare, but it came as medium. Both came in small portion, the steak came in 3 small pieces and salmon was also very small. I looked around and definitely felt the mains on the table were a lot bigger.....maybe it's because we bought Gilt City voucher? I am not sure. Both mains tasted ok...not bad but not great either. We ordered desert as extra because the voucher didn't cover desert, we had tiramisu and strawberry sorbet, both came in decent size and they were delicious.As the appetizers and deserts were great and the mains were average, it was difficult to give a 4 star.....",The Warren,4.0 star rating,$$,Gastropubs

The Warren was especially dormant when I popped in for brunch. Myself and my brunch companion were, in fact, the only people there at 1:00pm on a Sunday afternoon. For the unknowing, you might assume the restaurant sucks, but on the contrary, it's a lovely experience.Though we initially wanted to get something healthy, we couldn't take our eyes off the short rib poutine and twice fried chicken eggs benedict. The poutine was a salty, savory mess of deliciousness with lots of meat, eggs, cheese, and gravy to go around. And the fried chicken benedict was a nice departure from the ho-hum versions you see at plenty of other brunch restaurants who don't work hard enough to wow you on Saturday and Sunday. I'm never a fan of paying for $17 eggs, but when you double fry some poultry (something I can't easily do in my own apartment) in place of Canadian bacon or ham, you've caught my attention.

At the time of this post, they did not have a liquor licence so they only served beer and wine. They have a great happy hour deal, which I appreciated. They offer $7 two-for-one select beers, $7 wines and cocktails, and certain appetisers. My buds and I ordered a handful of appetisers to share. From what I remember, the octopus salad was mediocre. The octopus could have been grilled more and I wasn't a fan of the sour and bitter dressing. The poutine was under-seasoned and could have used some more gravy. Furthermore, we ordered some drinks before the happy hour ended, but because our server didn't put the order in the system before 19:00, he didn't honour the deal. He assured us that when we ordered we would be fine; however, the bill proved otherwise.

I love a simple burger on a beautiful bun, and meat that is rich, fresh and grilled with charcoal. What the Warren gets right here is that they go to the trouble to charcoal grill the burger, and not just flame grill it. The result is an amazing burger that still has me thinking about having another one. The fries and mixed greens also were excellent. Other happy hour food specials include oysters and fried chicken, all of which looked inviting too. And oh yea, the space is industrial, hipster inspired and warm. Great service and good food in one of my favorite parts of the city - I'm coming back.",The Warren,4.0 star rating,$$,Gastropubs

95,Da2aSed8hijvNG9sg8JC6Q,J C.,2.0 star rating,"This one is a difficult yelp for me.       First, let me tell you I see the passion for the business in the owner/operator's eyes. I think he has a real brilliance in what he has built. The Warren Burger and fries are delicious, the drinks are solid, the service from the waitress is honest. However, what I would like to see here is a success story. The professionalism looked sloppy all over the place from the staff. In fact, I think some of them were consuming the alcohol while on the job.      Second, truth is I think some folks are mooching off the owner/operator/chef and the business is losing money. I saw the real work from you when ""you"" decided to cook for your guests and you bang out six-seven meals in under twenty minutes, but you don't get a high five for this because you made you're guests wait on your personal life. You have such real potential here, and I hope you hear me. Seperate personal life from business and time to work and you will advance your overall profits greatly. I'm not telling you how to run your business, what I am saying is you could be a success story; but from an outsider perspective some people are taking advantage of your solid ability, good nature, and position. You're allowing the desire to be liked from the regulars to kill the out of state business you get.    If you want my advice: Fire the bleach blonde girl in need of a root job hostess, find a way to buy out your drunk business partner, and give the girl with the tattoo on her right arm a raise. Make the second guy -waiter- a buser/dish wash/bathroom attendant only- back of house guy or send him for training. He is not good around the table. I actually think the tattoo waitress could be a solid front of house manager for you if she can be extended the room to have a voice.      You have a beautiful location, you admitedly have some skills, but stop allowing your interests to be taken from you. I love the look of your place, and I think you genuinely care about your guests. I'm moved to write this review because I care. As a guest, I hope you read this and know that I genuinely have your interests at heart and with only an outsiders point of view.      Two stars this time around (one for the waitress with sense, the second star for the good common sense you used to get the drunk business partner away from the customers), but I will come see you next year to see how things are going and hopefully change my review. I think you have a real potential for genius, but bring it down with a dose of humility, and ""make a change"" as the Michael Jackson's song tonight playing in your establishment said.",The Warren,4.0 star rating,$$,Gastropubs

I thought we would get something comped because the manager stopped by and knew that our appetizer took forever to arrive, but we didn't get anything off our bill.

The chicken was the least impressive. Boneless pieces were decently crispy, and the honey flavor was good, but the batter was under seasoned.

133,Nj9T-9il8QpsnDoJXbYa7g,Jessica F.,5.0 star rating,"Love this place. Great staff and atmosphere, good food and even better drinks. This is a place if you want to chill for a date or come with a bunch of friends. I won't sit too close to the bar though because things might get out of control late at night and drunk people spill their drink on you ""accidentally"" to start a conversation lol",The Warren,4.0 star rating,$$,Gastropubs
134,UUic39q0YYETfboHi8pRHg,Christopher B.,2.0 star rating,"A nice venue and very pleasant staff.However they do not have a hard liquor license, and so their cocktails are all beer / wine based. Clearly they don't want this to be known, and have attempted to gloss over this while charging standard NYC cocktail prices. A deceitful practice.Rather cheekily, they also added a mandatory 20% gratuity for 4 drinks. While I would never deduct a server's tip when management is to blame, they clearly realised our displeasure at the rather deceptive menu and didn't want to grant us the opportunity to express our dissatisfaction.Disappointed, as it had such potential.",The Warren,4.0 star rating,$$,Gastropubs
135,u9ddXjFneDBhzCD768HCVw,Jason P.,1.0 star rating,"I had a very poor experience here on Friday night. My girlfriend and I are both pescatarians. The Warren has only one pescatarian friendly entree (salmon), which is fine. They also have a shrimp pasta which lists chili as an ingredient. I asked the waitress if the shrimp pasta was pescatarian friendly and she said yes but judging by the way she looked confused when I said ""pescatarian"" I was concerned she might be mistaken. I asked her 3 other ways whether the dish contains meat and she assured us no meat besides the shrimp and that the chili was vegetarian. Long story short, the shrimp pasta did contain meat. When we brought this to the waitresses' attention she basically just shrugged her shoulders and said sorry. We saw her speak with the manager about what happened but we're surprised when our bill arrived - they didn't comp any of our meal items and even charged us for the pasta we couldn't eat!Separately, my girlfriends salmon entree was not good. The sauce tasted sour and the cut of salmon was mushy.",The Warren,4.0 star rating,$$,Gastropubs

Of the mains, we had the flank steak and the pork chop. While the tartare was a bit heavy on the mayonnaise, and the portioning on the flank steak a bit stingy, overall, everything was delicious. The pork chop was especially excellent. We did not get the burger, but it looked great as well.",The Warren,4.0 star rating,$$,Gastropubs
147,WwBywa5j-iTNxaKG6i-qxA,Kelly G.,5.0 star rating,I found The Warren recently on a trip to NYC. My girlfriend an I stumbled upon this place in the Village due to it's high rating on Yelp!. The food was excellent but the real star of the show was that they have Crabbie's Ginger Beer. It is now my new favorite beer ever. The pricing was reasonable for lunch compared to some of the other places in the city. This place is brand new and I am sure they will last with such great food and service.,The Warren,4.0 star rating,$$,Gastropubs
148,L1JKBe-ZYsVbEZBP6uamqw,Natalie S.,3.0 star rating,"This place is ok; a bit overpriced for what they offer. The food was really average, so I wouldn't go here again. Also, my boyfriend and I didn't like the $25 cancellation fee if not canceled at least 48 hours prior to reservation.  Considering how unpredictable a night in Manhattan can be, this is a good reason for me to not make a reservation at this place again.",The Warren,4.0 star rating,$$,Gastropubs

Sampled four dishes tonight and I was not disappointed at all. From the lamb chops to the twice fried chicken it was amazing. Flavors were all over the dishes and then i was treated to the flatbread which was crisp, fresh and full of life (could eat this all day) Loved it and will have to come back for more. The venue itself is warm and inviting and has a ""Cheers"" type feel about it. Even a Norm and Cliff at the end of the bar. The staff are friendly and attentive and also were on point. Owners were very much about there customers which is rarely seen nowadays. Again Loved this will be back again!",The Warren,4.0 star rating,$$,Gastropubs

From the moment you walk in you are greeted with such warmth and wonderful hospitality. The decor is homey and a great place to have an intimate date, drinks with your friends, and even rent it for private parties. The staff tends to your every need and are very attentive. The bartender (Sal I think) is so friendly and makes the best cocktails. The owner even came by our table several times to make sure we were content. The food was nothing but AMAZING! We had a lot of tapas and were able to try out many items from the menu. Everything on the menu has a bit of delicious twist that makes you want more of it. I personally am not an oyster eater because I have been let down so many times with the freshness and taste but I think I finished about the whole dozen. Their famous hamburger melts in your mouth as do the pork chops and the lamb chops. Everything was exceptionally fresh and you can tell that it was the highest quality of food that you were eating. This is definitely going to be my new spot and/or late night go to place. I highly recommend it and I have been in the restaurant business for 13 years. It's absolutely one if the best places I have been to in a very long time and a must try.",The Warren,4.0 star rating,$$,Gastropubs
