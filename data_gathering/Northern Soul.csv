1,5aZX8bTiD0k9vR60SG588Q,Alison C.,3.0 star rating,"Like many Hobokenites, I missed the original Northern Soul with its gritty, yet welcoming atmosphere, delicious bar pies, and live music.  When they relocated to a new space on the first floor of the Sky Club apartment building, I was not sure what to expect, besides a curtailed music program to accommodate the residents.  I had been to the Sky Club in the past, when a different restaurant was housed there, and knew that it was a spacious and comfortable space.  Plus, they validated parking for 3 hours, a rare find in town and something that typically prevents out of towners from visiting.  For these reasons, I thought that the new Northern Soul might be an appropriate place for me to hold my birthday party.  Specifically, I was looking for a destination that would be convenient for those driving, walking, or taking public transportation, as well as a venue that offered both great food and drinks.  So, I convinced my friend to accompany me on a trial visit.  We took advantage of the parking, which was extremely easy, given that the lot was located right beneath the building and that the only stipulation was that you needed to buy something at the restaurant.  Northern Soul made the most of its space, with one side accommodating a pool table, large bar, and several high-top tables, while the other end was more of a dining room.  However, it also included a photo booth and a separate lounge area with a disco ball.  It was really a multi-purpose setting with something to accommodate every need.  My friend and I decided to focus our experience on drinks and some shared food.  I ordered the Mezcal Negroni, which included El Buha Mezcal, Campari, Carpano Antica Sweet Vermouth, and orange bitters.  I had mixed feelings about negronis in general, but I loved mezcal and this interesting blend.  I think flavored negronis are often less herbal and more refreshing, and this was a perfect example of that.  My friend's Blackberry Mule was a mix of Stoli, lime, crème de mure, and ginger beer that possessed just a hint of sweetness, but could have been improved with an inclusion fresh blackberries.  The food menu focused on healthy ingredients, with many of the desserts even being gluten-free and vegan.  With the concept of a second dinner in our plans for the evening, we opted to focus on the nutritious Market Plate of four vegetable sides.  We selected the Roasted Carrots and Parsnips, Roasted Brussel Sprouts, Roasted Butternut Squash, and Sautéed Chili Kale.  The greens were well-prepared, but lacked the strong kick for which we were hoping.  The roasted veggies were all undercooked and still too crunchy for supposedly being baked, though we both agreed that the squash was the best of the bunch.  Simply prepared vegetables should be rather simple items to pull off, so we were a bit disappointed in the execution here.  A dj was setting up as we were leaving around 9:30 on that Friday evening, causing us to wonder if we were missing out on the fun.  I guess we will have to go back to experience the nightlife, enjoy additional delicious beverages, and sample some  more elaborate menu items.",Northern Soul,4.0 star rating,$$,"Bars,, Music, Venues,, American, (New)"

We've done all of the above and had a GREAT time, every single time! 1) Celebrated my husband's 40th here with a large group of friende. Ask for Donal. He will make the whole thing seamless and everyone will have a good time! Get your own cake and they will help cut and distribute. We ordered off the menu and couldn't be happier. 2) Came here multiple times for brunch with husband, friends and infant twins and they have been SO accommodating  - with strollers, weird baby requests and everything in between! Honestly, we keep coming  back because they are so nice! 3) The food - staple... some dishes are better than the rest. My go to is the avocado toast and the grilled cheese (without bacon). The salmon avocado BLT is good too. Please add more vegetarian choices! :) 4) Parking is validated. Let's keep NoSo going!

8,3MsvlOQJp7pWxOkBzjUe7A,Thea Z.,4.0 star rating,"Welcome back to the neighborhood Northern Soul! In its new location, they have adjusted to the area and venue that they moved into, which means they now have food, but will likely have to have less live music into the wee hours since it is located in a residential building. In fact, when I was there on a Friday night we were just listening to whatever music was pumping through the system, no classic live music. While they have a lot to still work on, I won't judge on that since they are still working on getting to 100% open (i.e. the jukebox isn't working yet since they are waiting for a part, the self-serve wine bar they advertised has yet to happen, and they are still feeling out the layout of the space). They are also still working on service, etc, it was a bit spotty , but all in due time. Lots of the originals are back so it is cool to see some friendly faces from the former location. They brought several things with them, including the pool table, which is a great use of that space. They also cut and pushed back the bar from the other place that was there before them, which was the smartest thing they could have done. They now have a Photo Booth which cost $3 for a strip photos, but I would recommend skipping it since the zoom is set so close to your face, that thats about all that fits in the frame. Havent tried the food, but the menu is set on classic bar food scaled up a tiny bit (i.e. kale salads and burgers) and is mid-range cost wise. Its semi-obvious that they took over what was a french restaurant (i.e. the chairs and bistro tables were from that place) and the layout is odd for what you think of when you think of what NoSo used to be set up like, but I look forward to see how else they will transform the place.
