0,v4Ma7ciXTuIWkGibWeTNyQ,Kevin T.,5.0 star rating,"Back when I was a poor college student looking to impress on a one-year anniversary, Del Posto was there for me. For lunch at least. No way I could afford a Michelin star anniversary dinner back then (or now).But Del Posto was perfect. And the location was perfect. And the date and day was perfect and now I'm sad but anyways let's start this review.I told them the occasion when I made the reservation, and the staff seemed eager to make this the best possible experience for us. We showed up around noon on a Friday in October. The waiters whisked us off to a table near the window - the interior of the restaurant was beautiful. Light piano music serves as the backdrop to soft carpeted floors, tall windows with silky drapes, and cream colored walls. The window next to our table bathed the entire meal in this glowing, soft white light. Very romantic. I would have ordered a wine had I not been underage then.Then they brought out the bread basket. Warm and fresh out of the oven, the bread was so soft and tender. And the lard. I still dream about the lard. Sure, the butter made in-house was all I ever hoped it could be, but the lard helped this bread transcend beyond a pleasant pre-meal snack to what I can only begin to describe as a religious experience. It's fluffy, airy, rich, salty, savory... My poor college palate had never known such luxury.Then the actual meal began. We ordered the prix fixe lunch. I can endlessly extol the virtues of each dish, but I'll save you the time and share my favorites. We started with the Lobster Salad with Burrata. Light and refreshing, but also intensely flavorful. The lobster bites were fresh and tender, sitting atop creamy burrata with just a hint of lemon. For the main course, I had the Slow Cooked Salmon Rosmarino with Calamari, she ordered the Slow Baked Chicken alla Scarpariello. This was, by far, the best salmon I have ever had in my life. I did not know salmon could be this tender when cooked. My fork just went through it like butter. With each bite came sweet, blissful deliverance. I'm sure the chicken was good too, I was just too occupied at the time.In between dishes, the waiters would bring us small bites and treats compliments of the chef. Desserts were the Pecorino Romano Cake and Fette Biscottate, each plate adorned with ""Happy Anniversary"" in chocolate. To top it off, they gave us a sampling of truffles and sweets on top of a grater/wooden drawer plate. It was extra and we loved it. Del Posto was the perfect romantic lunch. Each dish looks and tastes like a work of art, and the service makes you feel like you two are the most important people in the world. We strolled around the nearby Chelsea Markets and High Line right afterwards to cap off a perfect day. Then she went and broke my heart a few years later but hey at least Del Posto will always be there.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
1,OlxsSI3-VtumT_lIOoYO6w,Allie L.,4.0 star rating,"We came here Friday night for dinner and overall had a great experience. We had a reservation for 9pm but showed up early and they seated us right away. We started with two glasses of sparkling wine. The waiter was attentive and helpful to help he pick out two glasses. We from there went on to choose our meal - they had you choose between the regular course menu and the captains menu. We went with the course menu which consisted of an app each, two shared pastas, separate mains, and two desserts. I chose the lobster to start (amazing) and my husband chose the beef (also delicious). We then got the pici with Bolognese which was our favorite thing we ate. We next got another pasta that had ricotta and a red sauce and it was also delicious. After the apps, we were slightly let down by our mains. I had the sea bass and my husband had the pork chop. Both were good but felt sort of average. Given our experience to this point we expected perfection but didn't feel they met it. The desserts were great in return though, but we didn't feel that made up for the mains.The service was mostly spot on and we even had our waiter take us on a quick tour of the wine cellar. He did this graciously and very nicely. We ordered two bottles of wine throughout the night and both were great and we got a lot of help.This is definitely a special occasion spot and had the atmosphere as such. I definitely recommend for good food and a nice occasion.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
2,92WZ83gEJDQfb3zSqTmoIg,Priya S.,2.0 star rating,"Del Posto has been on my list of to-do dining experiences in NYC for quite some time. Ironically, I finally made it over them on a whim random Sunday night dinner. It is definitely a special occasion type of place- not only is it pricey but it also screams old school money with the dark atmosphere and wooden paneling. Regrettably, we did the shared four course meal when we should have ordered a la carte pastas. Additionally, the main entree choices had no real vegetarian options. Besides the pasta, the other meals were just average (with way way above average prices). The sea bass as my main was bland and sub-par. Additionally, we were just full. This place won't break the bank with just a simple a la carte pasta main and a glass of wine but anything else will. Our bill for two four course meals and two glasses of wine each came out to $600 including tax and tip. A high price to pay for a simple pasta dinner. I'm really not sure how it wins all the foodie awards, but then again, I'm not a food connoisseur. It is definitely worth checking out if you are a pasta lover but save it for a special dinner and just do a la carte.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Came here because I wanted Italian food, really enjoyed the bread service because the butter was just heavenly. The other two things that resonated with me the most was the pasta and the clam sauce which was part of the a dish, not a dish itself. Service was not bad, I didn't request the wine pairing but they forgot and pour me some. I wished they would've stopped after they saw the glass still full but the wine kept coming! The live piano music was wonderful and the restroom was very clean but I think this is one of those places that I would only visit once in a lifetime.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

They tried hard, we got the sampling menu and wish we went al a Carte. We were stuffed. Food was good and well prepared. Classy restaurant, more of a closing a deal at work feel than cozy romantic spot for two. Fish entree was my least favorite. Don't forget the little details...when we ask to to have our desert package up because we are full and it has ice cream in it, don't tell us it will melt, tell us you will put it in a deep freeze until we decide to leave. Also, if we say we would like to pass on the cheese because we were full, be flexible and offer us something else in return .

6,EOtO8iRFE7y1Bgt9s3CM4g,Adriana K.,4.0 star rating,"For us vegans who want to go fancaaay Del Post offers an unique and memorable vegan tasting menu.I came here for a one year anniversary dinner in June and I loved that I could do the vegan option while my boyfriend could try the regular one. The service at Del Posto is an outstanding 5 but the food closer to a 4. The detail in each dish was meticulous and creative but some of the veg courses offered odd flavor combinations that were trying just way too hard or not hard enough. Amuse bouche:White Asparagus (2/5)Grilled Polenta; topped with caramelized onion/candied cantaloupe(3/5) Bread with frozen olive oil (5/5)The bread comes warm and melts the frozen olive oil omg amazing.Mains:Warm Fennel & Tardivo Â (4/5)I normally hate fennel but this was great! The way it was roasted really transformed the fennel into a completely different smoky and deeper flavor profile.Crispy Brown Rice Porridge (1/5)The porridge was sad, heavy handed with the coconut oil felt like I was eating sunscreen. The toppings however were much better (seaweed medley, romanesco, radish).Fresh Scungelli Pasta Shells (5/5)Alfredo meets pesto, this sauce was perfect. Noods were chewy. Total redemption from the previous course- another bowl plz! Whole Roasted Turnip (2.5/5)Turnips were hard and undercooked. Chinese mustard cleaned my sinuses out. This is where I get another glass of wine. Stuffed Artichoke (5/5)And redeemed again! A lovely artichoke filled with an array of chopped roasted vegetables and breadcrumbs. The marmite dressing was a tad sweet but paired well with the vegetables.Charred, Foraged Wild Mushroom (5/5)Even though I was STUFFED by this point I really really love mushrooms and gobbled this up. The tree nut ragu that accompanies the shrooms is wonderful, as the way they nuts are cooked lend to an almost smoky meaty taste.Coconut Sorbetto (1/5)Tasted like sunscreen again. and sugar. Dessert:BLOWWWWNNNN AWAY. Tartufo (5/5):I had no clue what a tartufo was but the best I can compare is an upscale carvel cake (ice cream, crunchies and a cherry jelly). It was actually the best dairy free dessert I've ever eaten.Trio of Sorbet: (5/5)Raspberry, watermelon and lemonThese were so nice, not too sweet and tasted of the actual fruit.Dessert sampler (5/5):Chocolate bon bon, sesame cookie, candied cantelope and a whipped chocolate crunch bar.Even up next to the tartufo, these were all delicious. The perfect ending to a perfect night. Overall, their vegan menu still has a bit to go but I would not hesitate recommending to anyone who wants to try the fancier side of plant based cuisine and experience the Michelin world that is so often closed off to vegans.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
7,rdoRi81dnsvAYoNwPse7Fg,Canny F.,3.0 star rating,"Booked dinner for NYE and loved the decorations. We ordered the 5 course dinner for $200 each and it was okay. I don't like that we had to choose the same type of pasta. The meal started off with some freebies and we loved it more than our actual dishes. The flavor was so unique and rich. I also loved the bread but wasn't a fan of their butter. They make the butter in house. We had the potato gnocchi and I was disappointed in the texture. The best gnocchi I had melted in my mouth. The lobster appetizer did not have a strong seafood taste which was upsetting. The beef tartar tasted better than the lobster but I could handle only a certain amount of red meat. The pork pasta dish was surprisingly better than the fish pasta. My main protein source was the dover sole and I tried a bit of the steak and wasn't impressed either. The coffee flavor dessert was amazing because you can't go wrong with coffee ice cream. Our desserts came with a bunch of free dessert and they were all wonderful. We ended the meal with a cup of cappuccino and it was so rich. If you never had a good cup of cappuccino, this is a must try! Overall, customer service was great. Each meal was explained in great detail and we did not feel rushed or pressured or out of place. We spent about 3 hours for our meal and sat a little longer to chat and they didn't kick us out!",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

9,fkNyIlHSJTjEVoaxDkZrsA,Jason G.,5.0 star rating,"My partner and I went to Del Posto for a very memorable meal, and we were not disappointed with our experience!It was really pretty easy to get a reservation, and they are on OpenTable. The dining room itself is rather large, and there's an upstairs and downstairs. The vibe is very intimate and romantic. It's pretty dark as far as restaurants go, but you can still see everything that you need to. The piano player was a nice touch because it really set the mood.We opted for the Captain's menu - a more personalized menu based on their normal offerings, but gives a larger overview and tastes of what the chef has to offer.The outstanding dishes were the crab agnolotti and the seafood broth. Both were very balanced and very memorable. The truffle butter ricotta ravioli were also tasty, and I would also recommend that dish. The lamb loin covered in vegetable ash is a specific type of taste, and while I did enjoy that, my partner did not.The wine list was extensive, and Del Posto has one of the largest Italian wine cellars in North America. They are reasonable with their prices and the sommeliers were competent and conversant on getting us a wine that suited both our tastes for what we were ordering.Service was very comprehensive without being overbearing.Overall, my friend and I very much enjoyed our meal at Del Posto. It is expensive, no doubt, but it's so easy to spend $100 on a meal that is not memorable or special in New York City, and this is not that.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
10,E_bLGwYrUNW6WfwRvKYSUg,George N.,2.0 star rating,"I would have given five stars but, I guess my expectations were very high and it delivered a little on a few things. Â Went there for lunch during the week, I called ahead and made a reservation a few hours before lunch. Â It was easy and painless and we arrived maybe five minutes after our reservation and the Host was warm and we got a table immediately. I had put this restaurant on my bucket list, I had gone inside maybe Â a year ago to look at the menu and planned to dine in one day, I am a big fan of Lidia Bastianich and have read her cookbooks and seen her on PBS.My friend wanted Italian food, so I chose the best restaurant at least with my limited knowledge of New York Restaurants.We had the prix fixe lunch. Â It was quite a production and set aside 2 hours for lunch here. Â The decor and service is European style, sort of classic and refined, though the dress code is relaxed, it is fitting to be business casual in my humble opinionWe ordered the Carne Cruda antipasti, which was delicious, a real explosion of flavor and texture on the tongue. For the Secondi, the entree or main dish I suppose, Â I ordered the Moorish spiced agnello, which was lamb neck and spicy labneh (a middle eastern yogurt). Â The presentation was excellent for all dishes, but this of all the things I had was underwhelming. Â It wasn't particularly flavorful and I had it medium rare. The texture was delicate, but I think it would be better well done and also be sure to add a pasta dish, the serving is quite small, as expected in fine dining, euro style restaurants, but this was two mouthfuls!Lastly, for dessert, I had the Torta di ricotta e limone. Â This was excellent, an explosion of flavor and textures, some subtle. Â I could taste the lemon in a gelato like substance, the nuts and pears, all went well. Â Dipping my spoon in the gelato, the lemon seemed to hit my olfactories as I indulged, quite an experience, best to balance with some pear and almonds in between. Â great experience on the palette.The decor was good, sort of classic French/Italian with a touch of modern. Â Felt like I was back in time when dressing up and dining were a part of cultured life, Like I was in the movie Casablanca, dining with a Belle like Ingrid Bergman. Â Great setting for a date.Service, now here is where I wasnt too impressed, I would have given it 4 stars and possibly five if the entree was great and if the service was top notch.overall it was professional and formal, The host was friendly and hospitable, the Sommelier was knowledgeable and tried to make our experience memorable. Â I would say, the staff seemed humorless and too uptight and serious, I understand it is a fine establishment in a refined part of Manhattan, but its important to be relaxed and as a patron, I love food for the taste and experience, it is to be enjoyed. Â I am not a food critic, but I love good food and service, but all things considered, Â if those two elements are missing then I dont care much for the restaurant, its reputation and cant endorse it to my friends. Â Ill take a hole in the wall place if the food is tasty, but first good food, then friendly, courteous , attentive service.The waiter in my view was disrespectful, He was courteous to begin with and explained each dish and its subtleties. Â But he explained to my friend in Spanish and took his order, and then, took off without asking me what I wanted to order. Â I asked the Sommelier why, she said he thought I needed more time, but he didnt communicate that to me!We didnt see much of him after that, he seemed fairly busy. Â Overall the staff were attentive, professional.....but my colleague wasnt impressed with the food either, He had the salmon and we ordered some Spaghetti bolognese, he said it tasted chewy, rubbery. Â I liked the texture. Â  He wasnt impressed with the food, I wasnt impressed with the service. That's what a restaurant should be about,food and good service",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Â There were six of us for dinner and not one of our appetizers and entrees disappointed. The menu is pre fixe with wine pairings available. Half our group chose the pairings and proclaimed them superb. The roasted squash was a hit, as was the lobster Caponata. The gnocchi was mouth watering and is a highly recommended choice...you'll love it. Â The pork is my favorite dish, but since we shared tastings, it's difficult to proclaim one better than the others. The chicken and veal dishes...wow.

12,5ot3MO-nz1brD3HS6GMcZw,Sophie P.,4.0 star rating,"Del Posto is where you go if you want to celebrate something special. I went with a group of 8 people. I had to put down my credit card in case of last minute cancellations, but that was understandable since we were such a large party. The venue was breathtaking. Facing the entrance was a huge staircase lined with candles. There was also live piano playing on the first floor. The lighting was dim and intimate and at our table on the second floor, we were surrounded by towering wine bottles. Del Posto offers several options. You can either order a la carte, or from their prix fixe menus. We decided to do the most expensive one - the Captain's Menu, an 8 course meal that was chosen by the chef. They asked for any preferences or dietary restrictions, but other than that, the fate of the meal was completely in the chef's hands. The prix fixe was $179, but since we wanted the in-season truffle luna piena, there was an extra $30 per person. amuse bouche: I couldn't remember this too well, but we had some kind of croquette and crisp. What really stood out was the freshly whipped creme fraiche drizzled in olive oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper. It came with a warm mini baguette that was perfect for mopping up the cream. course 1: Lobster Caponata. The lobster was cooked until perfectly tender. The tomato-based sauce was very flavorful and had a brininess to it from the artichoke. course 2: Vitello Tonnato. These were thin veal medallions cooked medium rare, swimming in jus, and dotted with a creamy sauce. Loved how delicate this dish was!course 3: Black Truffle Luna Piena. This was the pasta course that we upgraded, and it was totally worth the extra $30 (the white truffle upgrade was a bit too high). Luna piena means full moon. This was a freeform pasta sheet that covered the whole plate. Inside the pasta was a thin layer of castelmagno and black truffle butter. I cannot explain how decadent this pasta was. It was bursting with umami and the aroma of truffles was everywhere.course 4: Orecchiette with Rabbit Sausage, Turnips, and Castelvetrano Olive Passato. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the shape allowed you to get a bit of sausage with the pasta in every bite. course 5: Pesce Spada alla Giriglia. This was seared swordfish with rennel, Croccante ai Ceci, and Spices of Palermo. Swordfish is a hard fish to cook because it get tough really easily. Unfortunately, this was no exception. The meat was quite dry and most of us didn't finish it.course 6: Burnt Beef Rib Eye with Patate Fritte & Red Wine Anchovy Vinaigrette. This was another hit! The beef was juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside. The aging process packed a lot of flavor into the meat.course 7: Quattro Portoni Blu di Bufala with Pane di Ciliegie & Cherry Mostarda. I personally love funky cheeses, and this only was definitely funky. The saltiness of the cheese paired nicely with the sweetness of the cherry bread crisp and mostarda. course 8: Pistachio Semifreddo with Cranberries, Lemon Meringue & Pink Peppercorn. We were stuffed by the end, but I still managed to finish this dessert. The pistachio flavor really comes through and the semifreddo had a beautiful creamy texture. Half the table got the Amor Polenta with Slow Roasted Quince & Mascarpone Gelato. This was really good as well, especially if you prefer lighter desserts. We also got an assortment of chocolates and cookies in cookie jars!Overall, this was a beautifully executed meal. It was definitely a marathon though - took around 3.5 hours to finish.

I am generally obsessed with Lida Bastianich and her entire family of super chefs. I was supeeeer hesitant to fork over the $150/person for a tasting menu but Del Posto was a beautiful 3 hour dining experience, and a fantastic restaurant to celebrate a special event. Walked in on a Sunday afternoon for dinner and asked to sit at the bar because the white - and very luxurious - tables are kinda intimidating. I'm a poor med student so felt rather out of place sitting next to folks with their suit and ties (cue JT). Sitting at the bar area was so much fun and beautiful - no wait or reservation needed! We saw the bartender make all our drinks and folks were always checking up on us to make sure we were okay. The place is dimly lit, really quiet, with sparkly table lights placed all around - super intimate ambiance that basically made me form heart eyes during the 3hr dining experience. HIGHLY recommend the lobster salad with lemon aioli which was AMAZING. This was the first thing that we had at Del Posto so I was impressed from the start. Also highly recommend the seared lamb chop. Regardless of what you order, you will leave satisfied and happy. Ambiance, food, and service was on point, my only grip was with the menu for two people - we were explained like 3-4 times how to properly order from the tasting menu. Ordering was SO CONFUSING, especially if you're a party of two that likes to take bites off of each other's food. Each individual chooses 1 antipasti; we only get to chose 1 primi each but we each get one plate of the primi the other ordered (so its like choosing two); each individual chooses one secondi and one dessert.

Once the friendly doorman escorts you through the front doors, you will walk into a huge dining room with dark wood undertones, tall ceilings, and tables dimly lit with candles. The opulence of the room, with its well dressed crowd, sets a high bar for the food and service to match.Well, the staff starts out hitting the right notes by handing us each a hot towel perfumed with the scent of rosemary oil. The purpose of cleaning our hands was for the three amuse bouches to follow, Puff Pastry w/ Parmigiano-Reggiano, Fancy Matzo Ball Soup, and Crispy Arancini. They were all interesting, but nothing to write home about.Next, we were handed our menus. As we look through it, everything looked exciting and desirable. Our knowledgeable waitress explained our two options, 5 courses for $149 (we chose) or 8 courses for $179 (chef's choice with your input), as well as shared her personal recommendations. We were celebrating a major birthday and decided to take the longer ride and submit to the inspirations of the chef.Here is a play by play of our meal.1. Lobster Salad ""Continental Style"" - Lobster tail was a tiny bit overcooked and slightly chewy, while other pieces of the lobster were fantastic. Â Garnishes and the lemon aioli sauce were light and refreshing. Overall still a delicious starter.2. Vitello Tonnato - Four slices of delicate veal eye of round cooked beautifully, paired with a creamy tuna sauce and veal au jus. One of my favorite dishes from travels through Italy interpreted elegantly.3. Linguine alla Scampi - Favorite dish of the night hands down. The pasta was cooked al dente contrasting perfectly with the soft and tender langoustine. The amazingly simple yet profound sauce bursts with flavor, ending on a slightly spicy kick from the red pepper flakes.4. Girella Genovese - Another fantastic pasta course. The rich pork jus that the waiter poured over the pasta accented the already abundantly tasty pork filling inside this unique pasta.5. Livorno Style Cacciuco - Essentially a tomato based fish stew similar to Cioppino and Bouillabaisse. The broth was excellent, but the seafood was somewhat bland, though cooked well.6. Burnt Beef Rib Eye - The crispy crust of this steak was the best part. Unfortunately, the meat itself was overcooked where you can see that the brown edge was too thick and not enough hot pink was visible.7. Weinkase Lagrein - Combined with the Tomato Marmellata and the Focaccia Pugliese, it was almost like eating a cold bite of pizza. It was how the server even described it. I love pizza, but not necessarily at a meal for a special occasion.8. Hazelnut Tartufo / Sfogliata di Mele - These deserts were both quite tasty. However, neither were all that pretty to look at, especially the Tartufo. It was honestly one of the ugliest desserts I have ever seen.Honestly, I remember the food at Del Posto to be absolutely amazing the last time I was here. This time around, it did not live up to my memories, or the beauty of this classy dining room.

Since neither of us drink, we declined the wine list BUT, surprisingly the first time in anywhere i go to, they asked if we want a non-alcoholic Â menu. YES! Though the non-alcoholic cocktail wasn't impressive, I was impressed. Then they explained the menu to the tee as to what made up the sauces and where the meat came from. It took us some time to curate our courses and we begin our 8-course jouney. I will spare you the details because they are all delicious. I was full half way and everything was still really good. We had complimentary finger food before the menu exercise and complimentary dessert bites.Impeccable service even for me and my bf who have been to numerous restaurants. They were never in your face, but very much available when you need them. Each dish was explained when it arrives at your table by people who are passionate about food, and water was never empty. Polite, courtesous and professional, I was completely blown away by Del Posto's signature service. The only thing I didn't like is how dim the whole place is. Is it necessary? I see people struggling with reading the menu and I was trying so hard to stay awake, especially after food.Amazing experience.

20,v4Ma7ciXTuIWkGibWeTNyQ,Kevin T.,5.0 star rating,"Back when I was a poor college student looking to impress on a one-year anniversary, Del Posto was there for me. For lunch at least. No way I could afford a Michelin star anniversary dinner back then (or now).But Del Posto was perfect. And the location was perfect. And the date and day was perfect and now I'm sad but anyways let's start this review.I told them the occasion when I made the reservation, and the staff seemed eager to make this the best possible experience for us. We showed up around noon on a Friday in October. The waiters whisked us off to a table near the window - the interior of the restaurant was beautiful. Light piano music serves as the backdrop to soft carpeted floors, tall windows with silky drapes, and cream colored walls. The window next to our table bathed the entire meal in this glowing, soft white light. Very romantic. I would have ordered a wine had I not been underage then.Then they brought out the bread basket. Warm and fresh out of the oven, the bread was so soft and tender. And the lard. I still dream about the lard. Sure, the butter made in-house was all I ever hoped it could be, but the lard helped this bread transcend beyond a pleasant pre-meal snack to what I can only begin to describe as a religious experience. It's fluffy, airy, rich, salty, savory... My poor college palate had never known such luxury.Then the actual meal began. We ordered the prix fixe lunch. I can endlessly extol the virtues of each dish, but I'll save you the time and share my favorites. We started with the Lobster Salad with Burrata. Light and refreshing, but also intensely flavorful. The lobster bites were fresh and tender, sitting atop creamy burrata with just a hint of lemon. For the main course, I had the Slow Cooked Salmon Rosmarino with Calamari, she ordered the Slow Baked Chicken alla Scarpariello. This was, by far, the best salmon I have ever had in my life. I did not know salmon could be this tender when cooked. My fork just went through it like butter. With each bite came sweet, blissful deliverance. I'm sure the chicken was good too, I was just too occupied at the time.In between dishes, the waiters would bring us small bites and treats compliments of the chef. Desserts were the Pecorino Romano Cake and Fette Biscottate, each plate adorned with ""Happy Anniversary"" in chocolate. To top it off, they gave us a sampling of truffles and sweets on top of a grater/wooden drawer plate. It was extra and we loved it. Del Posto was the perfect romantic lunch. Each dish looks and tastes like a work of art, and the service makes you feel like you two are the most important people in the world. We strolled around the nearby Chelsea Markets and High Line right afterwards to cap off a perfect day. Then she went and broke my heart a few years later but hey at least Del Posto will always be there.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

We had a reservation for 9pm but showed up early and they seated us right away. We started with two glasses of sparkling wine. The waiter was attentive and helpful to help he pick out two glasses. We from there went on to choose our meal - they had you choose between the regular course menu and the captains menu. We went with the course menu which consisted of an app each, two shared pastas, separate mains, and two desserts. I chose the lobster to start (amazing) and my husband chose the beef (also delicious). We then got the pici with Bolognese which was our favorite thing we ate. We next got another pasta that had ricotta and a red sauce and it was also delicious. After the apps, we were slightly let down by our mains. I had the sea bass and my husband had the pork chop. Both were good but felt sort of average. Given our experience to this point we expected perfection but didn't feel they met it. The desserts were great in return though, but we didn't feel that made up for the mains.The service was mostly spot on and we even had our waiter take us on a quick tour of the wine cellar. He did this graciously and very nicely. We ordered two bottles of wine throughout the night and both were great and we got a lot of help.This is definitely a special occasion spot and had the atmosphere as such. I definitely recommend for good food and a nice occasion.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Ironically, I finally made it over them on a whim random Sunday night dinner. It is definitely a special occasion type of place- not only is it pricey but it also screams old school money with the dark atmosphere and wooden paneling. Regrettably, we did the shared four course meal when we should have ordered a la carte pastas. Additionally, the main entree choices had no real vegetarian options. Besides the pasta, the other meals were just average (with way way above average prices). The sea bass as my main was bland and sub-par. Additionally, we were just full. This place won't break the bank with just a simple a la carte pasta main and a glass of wine but anything else will. Our bill for two four course meals and two glasses of wine each came out to $600 including tax and tip. A high price to pay for a simple pasta dinner. I'm really not sure how it wins all the foodie awards, but then again, I'm not a food connoisseur.

The service at Del Posto is an outstanding 5 but the food closer to a 4. The detail in each dish was meticulous and creative but some of the veg courses offered odd flavor combinations that were trying just way too hard or not hard enough. Amuse bouche:White Asparagus (2/5)Grilled Polenta; topped with caramelized onion/candied cantaloupe(3/5) Bread with frozen olive oil (5/5)The bread comes warm and melts the frozen olive oil omg amazing.Mains:Warm Fennel & Tardivo Â (4/5)I normally hate fennel but this was great! The way it was roasted really transformed the fennel into a completely different smoky and deeper flavor profile.Crispy Brown Rice Porridge (1/5)The porridge was sad, heavy handed with the coconut oil felt like I was eating sunscreen. The toppings however were much better (seaweed medley, romanesco, radish).Fresh Scungelli Pasta Shells (5/5)Alfredo meets pesto, this sauce was perfect. Noods were chewy. Total redemption from the previous course- another bowl plz! Whole Roasted Turnip (2.5/5)Turnips were hard and undercooked. Chinese mustard cleaned my sinuses out. This is where I get another glass of wine. Stuffed Artichoke (5/5)And redeemed again! A lovely artichoke filled with an array of chopped roasted vegetables and breadcrumbs. The marmite dressing was a tad sweet but paired well with the vegetables.Charred, Foraged Wild Mushroom (5/5)Even though I was STUFFED by this point I really really love mushrooms and gobbled this up. The tree nut ragu that accompanies the shrooms is wonderful, as the way they nuts are cooked lend to an almost smoky meaty taste.Coconut Sorbetto (1/5)Tasted like sunscreen again. and sugar. Dessert:BLOWWWWNNNN AWAY. Tartufo (5/5):I had no clue what a tartufo was but the best I can compare is an upscale carvel cake (ice cream, crunchies and a cherry jelly). It was actually the best dairy free dessert I've ever eaten.Trio of Sorbet: (5/5)Raspberry, watermelon and lemonThese were so nice, not too sweet and tasted of the actual fruit.Dessert sampler (5/5):Chocolate bon bon, sesame cookie, candied cantelope and a whipped chocolate crunch bar.Even up next to the tartufo, these were all delicious. The perfect ending to a perfect night.

I don't like that we had to choose the same type of pasta. The meal started off with some freebies and we loved it more than our actual dishes. The flavor was so unique and rich. I also loved the bread but wasn't a fan of their butter. They make the butter in house. We had the potato gnocchi and I was disappointed in the texture. The best gnocchi I had melted in my mouth. The lobster appetizer did not have a strong seafood taste which was upsetting. The beef tartar tasted better than the lobster but I could handle only a certain amount of red meat. The pork pasta dish was surprisingly better than the fish pasta. My main protein source was the dover sole and I tried a bit of the steak and wasn't impressed either. The coffee flavor dessert was amazing because you can't go wrong with coffee ice cream. Our desserts came with a bunch of free dessert and they were all wonderful. We ended the meal with a cup of cappuccino and it was so rich. If you never had a good cup of cappuccino, this is a must try! Overall, customer service was great.

The dining room itself is rather large, and there's an upstairs and downstairs. The vibe is very intimate and romantic. It's pretty dark as far as restaurants go, but you can still see everything that you need to. The piano player was a nice touch because it really set the mood.We opted for the Captain's menu - a more personalized menu based on their normal offerings, but gives a larger overview and tastes of what the chef has to offer.The outstanding dishes were the crab agnolotti and the seafood broth. Both were very balanced and very memorable. The truffle butter ricotta ravioli were also tasty, and I would also recommend that dish. The lamb loin covered in vegetable ash is a specific type of taste, and while I did enjoy that, my partner did not.The wine list was extensive, and Del Posto has one of the largest Italian wine cellars in North America. They are reasonable with their prices and the sommeliers were competent and conversant on getting us a wine that suited both our tastes for what we were ordering.Service was very comprehensive without being overbearing.Overall, my friend and I very much enjoyed our meal at Del Posto.

Â Went there for lunch during the week, I called ahead and made a reservation a few hours before lunch. Â It was easy and painless and we arrived maybe five minutes after our reservation and the Host was warm and we got a table immediately. I had put this restaurant on my bucket list, I had gone inside maybe Â a year ago to look at the menu and planned to dine in one day, I am a big fan of Lidia Bastianich and have read her cookbooks and seen her on PBS.My friend wanted Italian food, so I chose the best restaurant at least with my limited knowledge of New York Restaurants.We had the prix fixe lunch. Â It was quite a production and set aside 2 hours for lunch here. Â The decor and service is European style, sort of classic and refined, though the dress code is relaxed, it is fitting to be business casual in my humble opinionWe ordered the Carne Cruda antipasti, which was delicious, a real explosion of flavor and texture on the tongue. For the Secondi, the entree or main dish I suppose, Â I ordered the Moorish spiced agnello, which was lamb neck and spicy labneh (a middle eastern yogurt). Â The presentation was excellent for all dishes, but this of all the things I had was underwhelming. Â It wasn't particularly flavorful and I had it medium rare. The texture was delicate, but I think it would be better well done and also be sure to add a pasta dish, the serving is quite small, as expected in fine dining, euro style restaurants, but this was two mouthfuls!Lastly, for dessert, I had the Torta di ricotta e limone. Â This was excellent, an explosion of flavor and textures, some subtle. Â I could taste the lemon in a gelato like substance, the nuts and pears, all went well. Â Dipping my spoon in the gelato, the lemon seemed to hit my olfactories as I indulged, quite an experience, best to balance with some pear and almonds in between. Â great experience on the palette.The decor was good, sort of classic French/Italian with a touch of modern. Â Felt like I was back in time when dressing up and dining were a part of cultured life, Like I was in the movie Casablanca, dining with a Belle like Ingrid Bergman. Â Great setting for a date.Service, now here is where I wasnt too impressed, I would have given it 4 stars and possibly five if the entree was great and if the service was top notch.overall it was professional and formal, The host was friendly and hospitable, the Sommelier was knowledgeable and tried to make our experience memorable. Â I would say, the staff seemed humorless and too uptight and serious, I understand it is a fine establishment in a refined part of Manhattan, but its important to be relaxed and as a patron, I love food for the taste and experience, it is to be enjoyed. Â I am not a food critic, but I love good food and service, but all things considered, Â if those two elements are missing then I dont care much for the restaurant, its reputation and cant endorse it to my friends. Â Ill take a hole in the wall place if the food is tasty, but first good food, then friendly, courteous , attentive service.The waiter in my view was disrespectful, He was courteous to begin with and explained each dish and its subtleties. Â But he explained to my friend in Spanish and took his order, and then, took off without asking me what I wanted to order. Â I asked the Sommelier why, she said he thought I needed more time, but he didnt communicate that to me!We didnt see much of him after that, he seemed fairly busy. Â Overall the staff were attentive, professional.....but my colleague wasnt impressed with the food either, He had the salmon and we ordered some Spaghetti bolognese, he said it tasted chewy, rubbery.

I had to put down my credit card in case of last minute cancellations, but that was understandable since we were such a large party. The venue was breathtaking. Facing the entrance was a huge staircase lined with candles. There was also live piano playing on the first floor. The lighting was dim and intimate and at our table on the second floor, we were surrounded by towering wine bottles. Del Posto offers several options. You can either order a la carte, or from their prix fixe menus. We decided to do the most expensive one - the Captain's Menu, an 8 course meal that was chosen by the chef. They asked for any preferences or dietary restrictions, but other than that, the fate of the meal was completely in the chef's hands. The prix fixe was $179, but since we wanted the in-season truffle luna piena, there was an extra $30 per person. amuse bouche: I couldn't remember this too well, but we had some kind of croquette and crisp. What really stood out was the freshly whipped creme fraiche drizzled in olive oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper. It came with a warm mini baguette that was perfect for mopping up the cream. course 1: Lobster Caponata. The lobster was cooked until perfectly tender. The tomato-based sauce was very flavorful and had a brininess to it from the artichoke. course 2: Vitello Tonnato. These were thin veal medallions cooked medium rare, swimming in jus, and dotted with a creamy sauce. Loved how delicate this dish was!course 3: Black Truffle Luna Piena. This was the pasta course that we upgraded, and it was totally worth the extra $30 (the white truffle upgrade was a bit too high). Luna piena means full moon. This was a freeform pasta sheet that covered the whole plate. Inside the pasta was a thin layer of castelmagno and black truffle butter. I cannot explain how decadent this pasta was. It was bursting with umami and the aroma of truffles was everywhere.course 4: Orecchiette with Rabbit Sausage, Turnips, and Castelvetrano Olive Passato. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the shape allowed you to get a bit of sausage with the pasta in every bite. course 5: Pesce Spada alla Giriglia. This was seared swordfish with rennel, Croccante ai Ceci, and Spices of Palermo. Swordfish is a hard fish to cook because it get tough really easily. Unfortunately, this was no exception. The meat was quite dry and most of us didn't finish it.course 6: Burnt Beef Rib Eye with Patate Fritte & Red Wine Anchovy Vinaigrette. This was another hit! The beef was juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside. The aging process packed a lot of flavor into the meat.course 7: Quattro Portoni Blu di Bufala with Pane di Ciliegie & Cherry Mostarda. I personally love funky cheeses, and this only was definitely funky. The saltiness of the cheese paired nicely with the sweetness of the cherry bread crisp and mostarda. course 8: Pistachio Semifreddo with Cranberries, Lemon Meringue & Pink Peppercorn. We were stuffed by the end, but I still managed to finish this dessert. The pistachio flavor really comes through and the semifreddo had a beautiful creamy texture. Half the table got the Amor Polenta with Slow Roasted Quince & Mascarpone Gelato. This was really good as well, especially if you prefer lighter desserts. We also got an assortment of chocolates and cookies in cookie jars!Overall, this was a beautifully executed meal. It was definitely a marathon though - took around 3.5 hours to finish.

I am generally obsessed with Lida Bastianich and her entire family of super chefs. I was supeeeer hesitant to fork over the $150/person for a tasting menu but Del Posto was a beautiful 3 hour dining experience, and a fantastic restaurant to celebrate a special event. Walked in on a Sunday afternoon for dinner and asked to sit at the bar because the white - and very luxurious - tables are kinda intimidating. I'm a poor med student so felt rather out of place sitting next to folks with their suit and ties (cue JT). Sitting at the bar area was so much fun and beautiful - no wait or reservation needed! We saw the bartender make all our drinks and folks were always checking up on us to make sure we were okay. The place is dimly lit, really quiet, with sparkly table lights placed all around - super intimate ambiance that basically made me form heart eyes during the 3hr dining experience. HIGHLY recommend the lobster salad with lemon aioli which was AMAZING. This was the first thing that we had at Del Posto so I was impressed from the start. Also highly recommend the seared lamb chop. Regardless of what you order, you will leave satisfied and happy. Ambiance, food, and service was on point, my only grip was with the menu for two people - we were explained like 3-4 times how to properly order from the tasting menu. Ordering was SO CONFUSING, especially if you're a party of two that likes to take bites off of each other's food. Each individual chooses 1 antipasti; we only get to chose 1 primi each but we each get one plate of the primi the other ordered (so its like choosing two); each individual chooses one secondi and one dessert.

The opulence of the room, with its well dressed crowd, sets a high bar for the food and service to match.Well, the staff starts out hitting the right notes by handing us each a hot towel perfumed with the scent of rosemary oil. The purpose of cleaning our hands was for the three amuse bouches to follow, Puff Pastry w/ Parmigiano-Reggiano, Fancy Matzo Ball Soup, and Crispy Arancini. They were all interesting, but nothing to write home about.Next, we were handed our menus. As we look through it, everything looked exciting and desirable. Our knowledgeable waitress explained our two options, 5 courses for $149 (we chose) or 8 courses for $179 (chef's choice with your input), as well as shared her personal recommendations. We were celebrating a major birthday and decided to take the longer ride and submit to the inspirations of the chef.Here is a play by play of our meal.1. Lobster Salad ""Continental Style"" - Lobster tail was a tiny bit overcooked and slightly chewy, while other pieces of the lobster were fantastic. Â Garnishes and the lemon aioli sauce were light and refreshing. Overall still a delicious starter.2. Vitello Tonnato - Four slices of delicate veal eye of round cooked beautifully, paired with a creamy tuna sauce and veal au jus. One of my favorite dishes from travels through Italy interpreted elegantly.3. Linguine alla Scampi - Favorite dish of the night hands down. The pasta was cooked al dente contrasting perfectly with the soft and tender langoustine. The amazingly simple yet profound sauce bursts with flavor, ending on a slightly spicy kick from the red pepper flakes.4. Girella Genovese - Another fantastic pasta course. The rich pork jus that the waiter poured over the pasta accented the already abundantly tasty pork filling inside this unique pasta.5. Livorno Style Cacciuco - Essentially a tomato based fish stew similar to Cioppino and Bouillabaisse. The broth was excellent, but the seafood was somewhat bland, though cooked well.6. Burnt Beef Rib Eye - The crispy crust of this steak was the best part. Unfortunately, the meat itself was overcooked where you can see that the brown edge was too thick and not enough hot pink was visible.7. Weinkase Lagrein - Combined with the Tomato Marmellata and the Focaccia Pugliese, it was almost like eating a cold bite of pizza. It was how the server even described it. I love pizza, but not necessarily at a meal for a special occasion.8. Hazelnut Tartufo / Sfogliata di Mele - These deserts were both quite tasty. However, neither were all that pretty to look at, especially the Tartufo. It was honestly one of the ugliest desserts I have ever seen.Honestly, I remember the food at Del Posto to be absolutely amazing the last time I was here.

It's a great place for any type of celebration or if ya wanna impress someone. From start to finish the people working there were amazing and kind. Every. Single. One. Of them. I guess you should tell them if your table for 2 that you reserved is for a couple or you want it so you're sitting across from each other. My friend and I got a table where we sat next to each other....hahaha. We laughed it off but maybe a fair warning to others to specify if you don't want it to be an awkward night. We went for Captain's menu ($179). It's an eight course meal of amazing explosions in yo mouth! And you know, it's not even right...it's more like 15 if you count all the complimentary bites you get at the beginning and end. Â You know, I can't recall all the names of the dishes but let me tell you, you WILL NOT be disappointed. They'll take into consideration all your food allergies and what not. *see pics for the dishes*In the end, I asked for them to present a special treat for my friend since it's his birthday (and all of these request I did BEFORE dinner via the phone). They brought out fresh made donuts with a candle! Yum!!! Also, if you want to pay for the dinner without the other person finding out, call before hand and have them email you a credit card processing form. You can mark whatever bill you want to take care of. Whether it be the entire bill or just for the food. You pick! So, all in all, all I gotta say is....Don't hesitate.

Since neither of us drink, we declined the wine list BUT, surprisingly the first time in anywhere i go to, they asked if we want a non-alcoholic Â menu. YES! Though the non-alcoholic cocktail wasn't impressive, I was impressed. Then they explained the menu to the tee as to what made up the sauces and where the meat came from. It took us some time to curate our courses and we begin our 8-course jouney. I will spare you the details because they are all delicious. I was full half way and everything was still really good. We had complimentary finger food before the menu exercise and complimentary dessert bites.Impeccable service even for me and my bf who have been to numerous restaurants. They were never in your face, but very much available when you need them. Each dish was explained when it arrives at your table by people who are passionate about food, and water was never empty. Polite, courtesous and professional, I was completely blown away by Del Posto's signature service. The only thing I didn't like is how dim the whole place is. Is it necessary? I see people struggling with reading the menu and I was trying so hard to stay awake, especially after food.Amazing experience.

49,1sxXLUKn6qCCVRJPhRNVYQ,Ken S.,5.0 star rating,"KenScale: 9.0/10I've recently had a wedding ceremony at the city hall with my now wife (the real ""wedding"" will come later in the fall somewhere outside of New York). We were both thankful to have some of our best friends show up as witnesses to the ceremony and wanted to celebrate this happy day together at lunch. Since it was a weekday, Del Posto seemed like a great option, with its still mind blowingly affordable (of course, in a comparative sense compared to the other fine dining institutions in the city) three-course prix fixe at $49 per person and the consistently elegant Italian cuisine that would've pleased anybody. Recently, the restaurant made headlines when its longtime executive chef Mark Ladner departed to open a casual pasta chain. His lieutenant, Melissa Rodriguez, subsequently took over the kitchen. Was the commitment to excellence still there after this major shuffle? I'm happy to report that Del Posto still remains one of the best Italian restaurants in the city.What always struck me during a meal at Del Posto is the wonderful balance of flavor and texture each dish displays. There is no over-the-top attempt to wow the diners with exotic ingredient or technique and yet you know on first sight that the kitchen isn't settling but constantly striving to bring the refined Italian dishes to your table. For my appetizer, wagyu beef carpaccio was sensational in its texture of raw meat accompanied by olives, lemon and salsa verde to add just the right amount of flavor on top of it. I stole a bit of lobster with artichokes from my wife, and it was another outstanding dish that I could totally see myself ordering next time I'm at the restaurant if it is still available then. The restaurant still does a single pasta tasting for $10 per person, and we went for the decadent bauletti (think agnolotti in terms of shape) with Roman sheep's milk ricotta and black truffle butter that displayed a ton of rich flavor to bring satisfaction to everyone at the table. Compared to the appetizers and pasta, the secondi dishes were not as perfect, but not far behind either. My striped bass with farro verde and black trumpets mushroom could have moderated slightly on the seasoning, but the fish was otherwise more or less roasted perfectly. A bite of lamb chop with golden chanterelles, white beans, rosemary and yogurt sauce that I stole from my wife was also slightly off on the flavor, but again there was no question that the meat was cooked very well. Del Posto has always been strong with its desserts, especially its panna cotta dishes. I absolutely enjoyed the sweet pea one last time I had visited, and this time the coffee panna cotta with burnt orange was also very delicious. Compared to the panna cotta dish, the ricotta and lemon tart with sheep's milk gelato tasted a little bit more predictable. Del Posto is always going to be a great place to have a weekday lunch because it's a lot easier to make reservations and definitely far less crowded, and the dining space is still one of the most romantic in the city. The service was as impeccable as ever, and we splurged on some excellent Italian brunello wines to celebrate our marriage with the witnesses.

58,pvO3fTThYYqXvRPrMw-kdw,Lucas B.,5.0 star rating,"ONE OF THE TOP MEAL EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE. If I could give it 6 stars, I would.This dinner was flawless. I came here with my girlfriend for our 3 year anniversary during a weekend in NYC. There are obviously a million restaurants you can go to in the city but I'm so glad we picked Del Posto. Our reservation was right when the restaurant opened so we could make the 8 o'clock Lion King show so were seated immediately upon entering. Considering we were the only table occupied in the entire restaurant, they treated us like we were the only table. This did not change throughout the night. As the restaurant got busier and busier during the 3 hours we were there, we were still treated like the most important guests there. The Maitre D's on hand - Richard and Will - were phenomenal. We both had the five course meal, she had the wine pairing and I was working my way down the cocktail list. Richard, the first MD we saw, expertly answered all of our questions related to the menu and helped us decide what we would enjoy the most. After placing our orders, Richard and another server came out Â multiple times before our first course to serve us a few surprises the chef cooked up for everyone. I'm a sucker for hors d'oeuvre, especially when they're done right. There were three in all and they were all great!Also before the first course, the Maitre D and server came to bring us an individual piping hot bread stick of sorts. This was paired with a sort of butter/cream that was soooooo good. It was fairly large so it took me a few session eating between courses to finally get it all down.My first course was the salsa verde charred octopus. There wasn't a lot to the dish other than the spinach accompanying it but it didn't need much else! The octopus was definitely charred, and charred perfectly so that it had a crunchy outside and was still perfectly tender on the inside. Definitely the best octopus dish I've ever had.Between the first and second courses I accidentally spilled a little bit of my cocktail drink (it was red on white cloth) and they immediately came over and put another cloth over it to keep the table beautiful. ALSO, even though I was a little over halfway done with my drink and I was the one who spilled it, they replaced my drink with a new full one on the house. That absolutely blew my mind and is honestly something that will stick out to me the most when thinking about this experience. I cannot say enough about the service of this restaurant.The second and third courses were most fun for us! With the five course, you and who your with each decide on two pastas that you'd like to have and they bring you each a bowl of the same pasta. We had the agnolotti with parmigiano-reggiano butter and then the orecchiette with lamb neck sausage, broccoli rabe, ricotta salsa, and crispy porcini and they were both RIDICULOUSLY GOOD. You could tell there was a lot of care in wrapping each individual pasta with the correct amount of filling and then all of it was cooked to a perfect al dente.Between our third and fourth courses I was scanning the cocktail list for something I had in mind. I wanted a spicy drink but there wasn't anything available. The other Maitre D that helped us out, Will, noticed me scanning the menu and asked if there was anything he could assist with. I asked him if there were any spicy cocktails available. There weren't but he said he would go ask the bartender what he had and he came back a few minutes later with the most delicious mezcal drink. The bartender nailed that one.For my fourth course, I got the veal alla saltimbocca. I wish I could have captured the words Richard used to describe this dish when I asked him about it. It was like the most descriptive and delicious food poem you have ever heard. I was sort of on the fence about it and after I asked him to describe it, I was convinced it was the one dish I had been wanting all my life. The veal had the bestttt char on it and that provided the best single bite of the night. The crisped potatoes that accompanied the veal went perfectly, too.The fifth course was cheese for me! Parmigiano-Reggiano with some bread and 25 year balsamic. Pretty simple but so delicious and a perfect way to end a five course meal. Luckily, there was actually more. The pastry chef sent out some jam-filled pastries for our anniversary, and then four little sweet bites for each of us. They were presented in a little chest that opened up and revealed all the sweets. Definitely a nice touch.The food was incredible, the atmosphere was very classy, and the service was the best I've ever had by far. Del Posto is a little pricey but after going there, I'd say with complete confidence it has every right to be. This place is for people who love the full dining experience, not just great food. I have never been so happy to leave a triple digit tip in my life.

Matzo ball soup, arancini, prosciutto and cheese panini: all outstanding! I particularly love the matzo ball in the delicate broth, which has clearly been given as much thought as any main dish here.Bread and ""Butter"": 1.5 stars. A baguettini (think more of a breadstick) with a non-traditional butter (but not that Batali-trademark lardo that I was looking forward to.Vitello Tonnato (Olive Crostone, Caper Shoots, Lime Cells & Lemon Basil): 3 stars. Vitello tonnato is one of my favorite Italian dishes, but this version didn't particularly impress. The veal was poached a little too much, in my opinion, and wasn't terribly flavorful. The tuna sauce also boasted too much caper brine and didn't allow the sea to shine.Seared Lamp Chops and Neck (Golden Chanterelles, White Beans, Rosemary & Yogurt Sauce): 5 stars all the way! My goodness, this lanb was cooked PERFECTLY and served with a fantastic, hot broth. I was a little disappointed that the canterelles and yogurt sauce were actually served on the side--in a different dish--but it was VERY savory and delicious both on its own and with the lamb. I would definitely recommend this dish.Palate Cleanser: a sorbet, a ice cream, and a gelato: 4 stars. All very clean-tasting and refreshing. Not heavy at all and a good cleanser between courses. Almond Sbrisolona (Cranberries, Rosemary & Mascarpone Gelato): 4 stars. Delicious. Warm, crunchy tart with a cool, creamy gelato. on top. It was the perfect balance of sweet and savory; I hate desserts that rely too much on the sugar or on the cream.Petit Fours: 4 stars. A whimsical grater box with 6 small, sweet bites.

The three of us wanted one of them that had fish and the waiter brought us the fish dish and he was able to get something of his own choosing.

Repeat ingredients felt like they were trying to use up overstocked items. Stiff and bland staff. Cannot read a table's mood to save their life. They gave our table a single iPad for a drink menu to share. Took forever for us to order drinks since it could only be used one at a time. Walked to bar and brought a regular drink menu back to the table. The food was not lousy, but neither was it memorable, and definitely not worth the awkward experience with staff who seemed overbearing yet condescending. It was my parent's anniversary and we had just got out of Book of Mormon. We wanted a relaxed and fun dinner, and this was not it.Just as a note, I try to make a habit of only talking about the food in my reviews.

Â Every morsel of food was absolutely delicious. Â In fact, this was the best meal I have had all year.I ordered the 3-course prix fixe for $49 with a $10 supplement for my entree selection. Â First up, they serve you some ""assaggi"" or ""little tastes"" compliments of the house. Â Among them was a small cup of the most delicious broth I've ever tasted with a small matzo ball in it. Â I would have purchased their cookbook just to get the recipe for that soup, but it's not in there. Â Another surprise dish, compliments of the house, was a creme fraiche & heavy cream whipped and then formed into a ball which looks like a soft mozzarella which is served with a baguettini and olive oil. Â It was fabulous.My first dish of the 3-courses was vitello tonnato which is made of very thin slices of veal covered in a tuna sauce with olive crostone, caper shoots, lime cells & lemon basil. Â It doesn't sound that good, but the waiter told me it's their most popular choice so I ordered it. Â And I was not disappointed. Â Squisito! Â I followed that with the Burnt Beef Rib Eye Steak -- charred on the outside and perfectly cooked on the inside. Â It is served with artichokes and chicory with a herb vinaigrette. Â Finally, I selected the Creme Fraiche Semifreddo with quince, star anise and toasted filone (bread).The staff couldn't have been more perfect. Â They were extremely attentive and almost seemed to intuit our needs before we could even voice them. Â They were constantly present without being intrusive. Â I was impressed with the wine steward also. Â Not being familiar with Italian wines, I asked if he could recommend a wine for a certain price. Â Not only did he recommend a delicious wine, it was $15 less than the price I quoted.As if the food and service were not enough, the place is gorgeous. Â You wouldn't guess it from the outside being right across the street from the Chelsea Market, but once you walk in the door -- Wow.I guess you can tell by now that I love the place and I will certainly return.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

75,8aj22jFDPfot_3Y0PcXbTA,Rachael F.,5.0 star rating,"If you've read my Yelp reviews, you know I've gone to a lot of the better restaurants in NYC. My definition of upscale dining was forever changed on Saturday night. I think Del Posto is quite possibly the best restaurant in the Tri-state area, and honestly, maybe the country. The menu doesn't have prices on it which should be an indication of the fact that you probably don't want to know what they are, but prepare to be mortified when you get you check.My boyfriend and I came here for his birthday and were sat an an over-sized table along the booth wall where we sat next to each other. It's not what I'm used to, but I actually thought it was really nice and intimate (as if the atmosphere wasn't already romantic enough). It's candlelit with double-vaulted ceilings and a live piano player adding a gentle touch of class to the perfectly-adorned space.My boyfriend counted 17 different members of the waitstaff that came over to our table at some point over the course of the meal whether it was to change silverware, refill water glasses, pour wine, set down food, explain dishes etc. I've never seen anything like it. The plating was exquisite and the service was impeccable.We ordered a nice bottle of wine that was nowhere close to the upper-end range of what Del Posto offers. We asked for a nice cabernet that was under $X and I was happy to see they didn't serve us something that was just $5 under our maximum. The waiter did something I've never seen in all my years going to nice restaurants. He opened the bottle and poured a splash into a large wine glass. He swirled and sniffed, then swirled and sniffed some more. After checking for legs and sediment and whatever else he was looking for, he poured that same splash into a second large glass and repeated the process. Finally, he then poured it into a smaller glass and conducted some more examinations. Only after this three-glass spectacle did he pass it over to be tasted. I haven't even gotten to the food yet. We decided to go with 4 appetizers and 2 pastas which the waiter felt was more than enough food, though we finished it off without a problem. As a rule of thumb, you can assume the appetizers are about $35 and the pastas are $40. I can't imagine what the entrees cost.To start we got the Octopus, Carpaccio, Lobster Salad, and Hamachi. If you held a gun to my head and hooked me up to a polygraph and said that I had to tell you which dish was my favorite or get my brains blown out, I would be absolutely screwed because I truly cannot tell you what I liked the most.For pastas we were deciding between Girella, Agnolotti, and Orecchiette. It was like choosing which children to save from drowning, maybe even more difficult than that. We went with the first two, dreadfully afraid that we made a mistake. About two-thirds of the way through the course, the waiter came out with two plates of orecchiette, on the house. I was stunned. I've never seen a restaurant comp a full dish like that. If they had brought over two little bites, we would've been thrilled, but a full serving was so unnecessary.This is all on top of the multiple amuse-bouches you'll receive over the course of the meal. Our itemized receipt told us we spent 2 hours and 37 minutes at our table. I was shocked. Our reservation was at 10pm and I had no idea it was that late. The time absolutely flew. My boyfriend would love to credit his fantastic conversation skills, but I'd like to largely credit the incredible dining experience created by phenomenal waiters, exquisite food, and perfectly-romantic atmosphere.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

The restaurant was decorated SO beautifully that what even is the point in coming when it's NOT Christmas? Oh, the food? Yeah...So I really tried to think of something bad to say about this place but I just can't. From the time we arrived to the time we left, the staff was warm, welcoming, attentive and they really know their shit. If you ask a question that the person you're asking doesn't know the answer to, they'll go grab someone who does. No bullshit around here. Cocktails & wine- amazing. The Snapper, a house cocktail, was great. I was on the fence about ordering it so I went with my trusty go-to, a Pimms Cup (which they executed perfectly), but then I tried my friend's Snapper and was bummed that I didn't get it. The wine list is expansive and impressive. If you ask for something they don't have, the sommelier will come over and tell you about all the other wines that are similar. Food- I really don't know what else to say besides that the 5-course menu changed my life. At the end of the meal I was so satisfyingly satisfied...if that makes sense. I was full but I wasn't like, 'in pain full', and all of the courses flowed so wonderfully that I didn't wish I had more or less of something...if that also makes sense. Everything was literally just perfect. Oh, and I'd like to point out that this is the first time in my life that I have ever ordered cheese instead of dessert. NO REGRETS. I had the La Tur (similar to Brie) that came with a cute little honey pot and I mixed it together and just ate it with a spoon with no shame and oooooommmggg I can die happy. I walked out of Del Posto with a literal smile on my face like a freak (it was pouring rain and I couldn't find my Uber, so that's saying something that I was still so happy) and I cannot WAIT to come back (next Christmas).",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

82,7hLSrf64ApYDBuqRaWa1Iw,DR W.,3.0 star rating,"Yesterday, I visited Del Posto for my birthday dinner and wasn't too thrilled. To celebrate my big day, I ordered the captain's menu, which is an eight-course tasting menu. Typically, I order a la carte because I don't trust anyone to choose what I eat, but it was my birthday so I was feeling adventurous. Imagine my disappointment when I realized that most of the dishes I had were included on the Ã  la carte menu. Isn't a tasting menu an opportunity for the chef to be creative and provide you with tastings that are totally different from the typical menu items? I was expecting to have my mind blown, but that was a bit disappointing. Â And, oh yeah, the tasting menu is $185 per person.The highlights of the meal were the bauletti, which is essentially a round ravioli filled with ricotta cheese and served with truffle butter, a spaghetti with sea urchin sauce, the gluten free birthday zeppoles with fruit filling, the complementary gluten-free focaccia bread. The duds were the overcooked branzino, an amuse bouche, which tasted like a corn chowder cup filled with spaghetti sauce.For two Captain's menus and 3 drinks, we spent about $550.If you want a place that offers gluten free versions of nearly everything on the menu and impeccable service, come here. However, I would forgo the overpriced and lackluster Captain's menu.Oh, and Del Posto no longer serves the 100 layer lasagna that was the restaurant's signature dish for many years.

It is one of the four NYT 4 starred restaurants, and the other three are Per Se, EMP and Le Bernardin. Without hesitation, my friend and I opted for the 8 course Captain's menu; however there were some complementary bites offered at the beginning of our tasting. The lasagna was by far the most impressive course as each layer was hand made and laid on top of each other with cheese filling in between. Tomato sauce beneath further added towards its flavor! However, the other main dishes were less than outstanding. Another piece of highlight came at the very last - chocolate cake with coffee sorbet. The combination of sweetness and bitterness provided me a non-descriptive type of feeling and I simply could not help. Del Posto certainly is not flawless; yet it represented itself in a unique way.

Though I told them sheep and goat dairy were wonderful and delicious, they assured me that in this highly rated Italian restaurant they had no sheep nor goat cheese that wasn't mixed in with cow dairy. Had I known they were so limited I would have picked some up at Safeway before I arrived, nipping that absurd deficiency in the bud.That being said, the Wagyu Carpaccio was superlative; could not ask for anything more from it. My lamb chops were delightful but I must admit they had a problem with silver skin. Additionally, my husband ordered the oxtail raviolo which arrived with some provolone which he removed with his fork in about 2 seconds and was able to share with me, a much more than memorable tasting. This is as opposed to the shell pasta with a mild and thin red sauce and just shake of chili flakes and garlic which I received. Because apparently that was all they had to accommodate the lactose intolerant.And for the absolute coup de gras, they brought to the table some very nice Italian breads with spreads to go along with them just as any fine restaurant would. My bread arrived with a small dish filled with a quenelle of Tofutti Cream Cheese, which is available at 7-Eleven. I wish I was joking. And what's worse, management assured to me that this was their best effort possible.My suspicion is that, absurd as it sounds, no one in management nor the kitchen nor the serving staff know the difference between lactose intolerance and lactose allergies. Many fewer people have lactose allergies than lactose intolerance and what they served me were meals which seemed to consider any presence of lactose as dangerous as plutonium.We went to Del Posto because it had excellent reviews & we've always enjoyed watching Lidia Bastianich and Mario Batali cooking on TV. We came to this restaurant for our 3rd anniversary and not only that, but for a bucket list because I have Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. I told them these things as well as I was making my reservations. They were completely disregarded.Despite the quality of food when they got it right the complete insufficiency of the management and the thouroughly unaccommodating treatment for those with dietary restrictions make it such that I just cannot get more than one star. They went a real distance to ruining this bucket list of mine. It's difficult to express the depth of my disappointment. My husband rated Del Posto 3 stars for lack of wow factor and underwhelming memorability. Still, this is a specific warning for those with dietary restrictions.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
98,5Rt8ifFAbjDReZKAVnemTQ,Margot C.,5.0 star rating,"First time ever writing a Yelp review, Del Posto was that good! The service alone deserves 5 stars and I would absolutely recommend them to anyone looking for a special evening with friends and family. I wrote out the play-by-play of our evening below, but for the TL;DR version: BOOK THIS PLACE if you want a world-class meal for a special occasion. Perfect for visiting family, big birthdays, anniversaries or corporate events. Del Posto takes the stress out of planning and will deliver a fantastic dining experience.Now for the long version:We planned a 30th birthday for a dear friend who was looking for a upscale, intimate meal to enjoy with her friends. As late 20 somethings who all live in the city, we eat out a fair amount and the birthday girl wanted something a little more special to mark the occasion. As an added twist, the birthday girl's family was flying in to surprise her at dinner. This made for a lot of moving pieces which Del Posto was beyond gracious in accommodating.From the start, Mariko at Reception was a delight and answered upwards of ten phone calls from me during the planning stages. She helped us change the reservation around multiple times and also took careful note of the birthday plans, including the surprise element.Day-of, thanks to our early reservation time (5pm on a Saturday) Del Posto allowed us to arrive early to set up a few small table decorations. Upon arrival we found the table ready and waiting for us with attentive waitstaff available to assist and answer questions.As with any event, things don't always go according to plan and some our party was uncharacteristically 30 minutes behind schedule. In any other NYC restaurant on a Saturday evening during the holiday season we would have risked losing our reservation. But Del Posto barely batted an eye, allowing those of us already in attendance to relax at the bar with a delicious cocktail while we waited.Once everyone arrived, the surprise went perfectly and the dinner went smoothly after that. My personal favorite dish of the 5-course prix-fixe meal and a popular choice at the table was the lobster antipasti. The dessert course was another highlight and featured a chocolate ball filled with candy which the birthday girl got to smash on the table (!!!).One of our guests is gluten-free and confirmed Del Posto was highly accommodating in her dietary needs. Having called ahead of time to see if GF was even a possibility at an Italian restaurant, she was thrilled to hear that wouldn't be a problem and throughout the meal enjoyed the exact same dishes as everyone else, only hers were made gluten-free.Overall, incredible hospitality and service paired with exceptional food made for a memorable evening for our birthday girl, her family and friends. Thank you to the entire team at Del Posto for such a special night!-Margot",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Formal but felt sort of 80s for some reason. Didn't love the feel of the magnitude of the restaurant but that's a personal preference. It was very cozy though, I must say. For value this place is good as you get a lot for the cost. I am extremely picky about Italian food however, especially upscale, and I was disappointed with the food here. It was quite average and I was put off from the very basic and unimaginative amuse bouche. I would not return but for someone who wants fine dining on a budget and isn't picky about food then this is perfect for that type.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
101,jfMzx1khBo8IHsblzLw6sQ,Lisa H.,4.0 star rating,"We found this place through yelp after a long day at a convention we disliked and realized after we walked in that we were not appropriately dressed for this upscale place. However, they all gave us a friendly greeting and graciously sat us at the bar where we were most comfortable. I mentioned to our bartender our feeling a ill at ease due to our casual clothes and she made us feel completely fine. So while I recommend dressing nicely for this restaurant, they will still treat you well if you are a bit casual although guys can't wear shorts or a t-shirt. The menu had a number of tantalizing dishes and many people choose one of the two tasting menus, but we had had raclette the night before so we weren't up for another large meal. I choose the Dungeness crab ravioli with spicy Serrano oil and my daughter had the truffle pasta dish. First they came out with two little tastes from the chef. One was white asparagus wrapped in prosciutto with some caviar which I really enjoyed. My daughter ate the polenta squares with caramelized onion and loved them. Next they presented their version of bread and butter. Tiny baguettes for each of us with this very unique butter that looked like burrata and tasted like a cross between butter and creme fraiche. Also delicious. Our entrees came next and we loved them both. It was the perfect amount of food for us, but my husband, if he had been with us, would have wanted another dish as it would not been enough for him. Â At the end they brought us a few sweets to end our meal with, all made in house, and all superb. The presentations were lovely on each item and the service was impeccable. Next time we return to NYC, we will come with more of an appetite as I'd love to try the tasting menu.

109,7fG5Xs_42I1I4eDfBhPmBA,Tatjana T.,2.0 star rating,"Went to Del Posto last weekend to celebrate reunion with long time friends. We all live in different part of the county and wanted to splurge on a Michelin star dinner as we don't get to see each other very often.Walking in, we were impressed with the size of the restaurant and it's high ceilings. Every single table was taken so the expectations were high! To start with, we ordered a half-bottle of Rose Champagne. While the whole performance of opening the bottle and pouring champagne like a waterfall from one glass to another and then the third one looked beautiful, we were eager to make a toast. A few minutes later, the ""show"" was over and we were finally able to do that.We opted for a 5-course menu and were treated to 3 complementary starters beforehand. The first one, while looking like a savory version of a french macaron, was no better that the good old ritz cracker. The second one was an improved version of my grandmother's chicken broth - the reason I say ""improved"" is because it had a matzo ball at the bottom which you are supposed to slurp up somehow (no spoon given). The third one was so generic that I can't even describe the taste - very neutral, I guess, is the word.The first course, aka ""Antipasti"", arrived shortly. I had the Sochimi, which, per our server, was imported from Japan. It tasted very fresh and might have been the best part of the meal. One of my friends had Lobster, which we were not impressed with as there was nothing unique about it. The other friend ordered the tartar which was quite solid. Still, pretty unoriginal.The second and third, ""Primi"", courses had to be same for the entire table (kinda like family style). We opted for Orecchiette and one more thing, possibly Oxtail Raviolo alla Vaccinara. I know it's generally hard to impress someone with a pasta dish, but Mario Batali is a top notch chef after all! I have to say, I expected more.For ""Secondi"" course I chose Roasted Striped Bass, while my friends chose Veal alla Saltimbocca and Burnt Beef Rib Eye (rare). Since most of our previous dishes were left unfinished, we ended up eating a lot of bread (which was absolutely delicious!) so, by the time secondi arrived, we weren't even very hungry any longer. Each one of us had a few bites of each dish and at this point we were ready to call it a night. The Bass and Veal were pretty ordinary and the Rib Eye was so chewy, it was impossible to eat! I do have to mention that both Rib Eye and Veal were addition $20 each, which is another annoying part of this pre-fixe menu.Desert? Another generic item that's not even worth writing about. Better off getting some Magnum ice-cream and frying bananas on your own than settling was this generic-tasting rip-off.While the service was impeccable with multiple staff serving us, I would have preferred to enjoy some unique food instead. I know people have different opinions but when I come to a Michelin-rated restaurant I expect something out of the ordinary, something unique, something I've never had before. In this case, I might have experiences that with staff, but definitely not with food.Very, very, VERY disappointed.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

My friends where seated comfortably at the bar area and we were brought to our table right away. The place is beautiful, reminds me of old steak houses - classic and romantic! Service was impeccable - it was a chilly night so a couple of the girls and I requested for hot water, our cup was always warm :) also, they always made sure the girls at the table were served first and at the same time!We choose the Captain's Menus, bc it was a Friday night and we didn't want to make any decisions lol. Out of the 8 courses, I REALLY enjoy 4, the other 4 was just OK for me. I'm more of a meat eater, so I am probably bias but I was honestly not impressed.1st: Fin Fish - 5 different type of raw fish (sushi). I'm not much of a sushi eater, but my friends all say they enjoyed it2nd: Insalata - veggies of the day, just OK again3rd: Ravioli - sheep's milk Ricotta, delicious! one of my favorite 44th: Lamb Neck Ragu - DIVINE! my favorite course of the night! the lamb was tasty along with the minted pea puree... YUM!5th: Poached Lobster - generous portions and great flavor! one of my favorite 46th: Burnt Beef Rib Eye - cooked to the perfect med rare! another one of my favorite 47th: Warmed La tur - the honey was great! but i think with all the meats before, I just couldn't each anymore bread8th: Mixed dessert - we each had something different and they even gave us 2 additional plates of mixed chocolates, tarte and lollipop to share. however, i wasn't super impress with any (maybe because I was already very full)... And i'm a dessert lover, sigh.Overall, based on price I feel I should be able feel at least more than half was amazing, unfortunately I did not.

111,L1n3zE8xdwuqLDp15X7a-w,Uma K.,5.0 star rating,"The perfect evening!! My coworkers and I came here for a special occasion dinner, and it was incredible. After we sat down, the server immediately asked for any dietary restrictions (we had a vegetarian and a shellfish allergy). Then, an amuse bouche came out, modified as needed for each guest, and popping with flavor. As the vegetarian, I had a piece of white asparagus, wrapped in a thin slice of green asparagus, and topped with breadcrumbs and onions, as well as a piece of polenta cake with caramelized cippolini onions and almonds (I think). Heaven, and the perfect start to the evening.The dinner meals are a required prix-fixe - we chose the basic prix-fixe which meant that each guest picked an antipasti, a secondi, and a dolci course (or cheese), and then we picked two pastas for the table. For the pastas, we chose the ricotta with black truffle bauletti, and the orrechiete with lamb ragu. Ever accommodating, they gave me (the vegetarian) two options in lieu of the orrechiete, so I chose the paccheri (I might have mixed the pasta shapes up) with a tomato, basil. onion, and almond sauce. The bauletti were little pockets of perfection, perfectly smooth and creamy, and not overwhelmed by the black truffle. The paccheri was good - not as good as the bauletti, but I suppose I played it safe there. For the antipasti course, I chose a warm fennel and tardivo salad. The dressing was actually made with Marmite, and it was the perfect combination of sweet and tangy and sour, coupled perfectly with the bitterness of the fennel and tardivo. My coworkers had the lobster caponata and the beef carpacchio, both of which they loved.For the secondi course, again, they gave me two options. First was a stuffed asparagus with cremini mushrooms, and the second was a marinated turnip with mustard greens. Not being a big fan of mushrooms, I chose the turnip, and was not disappointed! The turnip was marinated overnight, and then roasted/grilled, such that at times when I was biting into it, it had the consistency of a perfectly roasted potato. Creamy, but also having the slight kick that a turnip generally has, it was paired with cripy mustard greens that were lightly dressed, and added acidity to the plate. It was delicious. Finally, we had our dolci course. I chose the ricotta and lemon torta with poached pears (delicious delcious). Light and airy, it was a wonderful ending to an already spectacular meal and experience. They also brought out little chocolates and cookies, which was also very good. All in all, the experience was amazing, though definitely not an every day meal.

Dinner proved to be even better food-wise, but also much, much, much more expensive. RESERVATIONS: I had a reservation on Monday at 7pm for a group of four. I made this a couple weeks in advance.THE SERVICE: Spot on. You have a different server for everything, from providing a stool on which the ladies can put their purse, to pulling out your chair, to bringing out your food (multiple servers on that front), to knowing the wine menu, to taking your plates away, to pointing you in the right direction for the restroom. Every one of your needs is met every minute of the meal.THE COST: About $600 total for dinner for four.. ouch. We got: 1 glass of wine, plus a separate (and fairly expensive) bottle, 1 anitpasti (starter), 4 primi (pasta), 2 secondi (entrees), 1 dolci (dessert). Del Posto is so fancy that they don't list prices on the a la carte menu - only for the prix-fixe. However, we did get an amuse-bouche with three bite-sized items for everyone, plus two free dessert courses and takeaway chocolate bark boxes for the ladies.THE FOOD (see my photos for additional info!):Recommended to us: Truffled Beef, Agnolotti, Bauletti, Burnt BeefMust-haves: Truffled Beef (antipasti), Orecchiette (primi), Red Wattle Pork (secondi).* Amuse bouche - 3.5 starsThe fried balls were the best. The radish wraps were a bit bland, and the soup was sour for me. * Bread basket, with pork lard and butter - 4.5 starsGreat basket! So many bread options, all fresh and delicious. The spreads were loved by all.ANITPASTI* Truffled BEEF (carne cruda w/ crispy salsify chips) - 5 starsFantastic! Perfect balance of truffle oil, crisp, and tasty beef.PRIMI* ORECCHIETTE (w/ lamb neck ragu, minted pea puree, & dried chanterelles) - 4.5 starsThis was the pasta of the night for my friend and I. The orecchiette is much thicker, and also more al dente, but done really well. The ragu is dry and has a slight crunch to it, the pea added a nice contrast (and was great when you got a whole pea that burst with flavor in your mouth!). * Pork and Veal AGNOLOTTI (w/ sugo finto & cauliflower cacio e pepe) - 4 starsAnother popular pasta, the two boys liked this and the bauletti the best. The little bursts of pulled meat were great, and the cauliflower surprisingly added hugely to this dish.* Roman Sheeps Milk Ricotta BAULETTI (w/ black truffle butter) - 3.5 starsThis was the most bland pasta for me - there was too high a ratio of ricotta filling to sauce. That filling, while soft and fluffy, had very little flavor. It would've went great with a sharp red sauce. The two boys liked this and the agnolotti the best, enjoying the ricotta and the olive oil after taste.* Traditional Del Posto GARGANELLI verdi (al ragu bolognese & parmigiano-reggiano) - 3.5 starsThe boys liked this one the least, but I enjoyed it. The garganelli was quite thin, the flavor was lighter, and the meat went well (though there were some chunks of just fat that I had to pick out). SECONDI* Red Wattle PORK (w/ wilted mustard, fermented apple & truffled pan gratinato) - 5 starsThis pork was AMAZING. Incredibly tender! Everyone loved this. The subtle sweetness of the apple, complemented incredibly well, and it formed a trifecta of perfection with the other sauce (white w/ black speckles). * Burnt BEEF (rib eye w/ Watercress & Potato Chip Salad) - 3.5 starsThe char was interesting, but the meat itself was quite sinewy. Definitely overshadowed by the pork on our main course.DOLCI* Butterscotch SEMIFREDDO (melon agrumata & crumbled sbrisolona) - 3.5 starsGood butterscotch ice cream with the crumbles on top. I found the dried/rehydrated (as our server described it) melon to be way too sharp and couldn't handle too much of it. * Complimentary Cookie Jar Dolci - 3.5 starsGood cookies, and loove the porcelain egg. * Complimentary Mini Doughnuts Dolci - 4 starsGreat doughnuts w/ thick lemon cream.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Had a seven course meal with canapes before hand. All was good except:1) one of the breads in their basket wasn't special. Basic small ciabata i can get at any crappy grocery store. I expected better. The second sourdoughish bread was awesome. The two types of butter were excellent. 2) here is the lost of two stars. A restaurant like this must nail their rissotto and they failed twice. The first time around the risotto was well undercooked, hard and crazy salty. Didn't the chef or platers check before sending out. Well all 24 of us agreed and sent the whole course back. No problem. Mistakes happen. But you lose one star here. The second time it came around was even worse. Slightly over cooked, no salt, no cheesiness and watery. They tried to go i the other end of the spectrum from the last comments. Again, all 24 people complained. Another star lost. How can you mess up rissotto like this. It disturbed me. I can go to any Italian restaurant and get something better. I can make better at home. Really felt sad here. ------Overall a great experience but the place fell flat on a foundational item. Tge place wasn't crazy busy and oversight twice without tasting is a huge red flag in a place like this. I hope this gets to the Executive Chef who can make some quick changes. BTW i am in the restaurant business and feel a responsibility to call out foundational issues to help the restaurant improve asap.

She warned me it would be expensive, but worth it. She was absolutely right.We had the 5-course tasting menu with wine pairings. My wallet is still recovering... as are my taste buds. Every single thing I ate was the best thing in the entire world. I couldn't believe how simply yet stunning the food was, even though it looked and tasted complicated. We couldn't possibly manage a pudding but as we are both cheese lovers, we did order 3 pieces of cheese with our tasting menu. I think my poor friend only managed one tiny nibble before she declared herself too stuffed. I can't wait to go back to this place with my husband.

The food was fantastic, the real disappointment was that I had waited 20 minutes to be seated for a reservation that I was on time for. They emailed me and called me to confirm my reservation and still I had to wait 20 minutes when I got there. This caused my 9:45 reservation to become a 10:05 reservation and eventually meant that my dinner went past midnight, which I really wasn't expecting.If they had actually taken me when I checked-in for my reservation, they probably would've gotten 5 stars.

134,J91Z-EF0G8n8rSj4EJKqqw,Asuka N.,5.0 star rating,"I've wanted to go to Del Posto for a long time, but upon reading that Mark Ladner was departing at the end of the month from the kitchen, I finally went ahead and booked a reservation to come dine here before January was out. The coat check is its own section between the outdoors and the restaurant, so it doesn't look like much until you step inside. There's a downstairs for parties and events (there was one going on when we showed up), the main dining room, with seating on the right and a lengthy bar to the left, and an upstairs above the bar that has tables that curve out above the ground level. Perhaps it was a combination of it being frigid outside, or maybe it was the dark, velvety colors that felt even more so with the dim lighting - but the ambiance mixes the feel of a time in the past with a modern feel. The piano in the background, alternating between live tunes that ambled from Lennon to Leonard Cohen to Michael Jackson ('Billie Jean' was quite impressive) and background music that was more generic to my ear. The service here was incredibly attentive, with the food brought out in a well-spaced fashion, and with a main server who engaged us on conversation around different plates. The drink menu (on iPad) naturally tends towards wines, but somewhat to the detriment of any other alcohols; despite the fabulous-looking bar, the cocktail menu is limited, and there are no beers to speak of. Both of our wines were excellent, although I will say that I enjoyed my white a bit more (pretty partial to Italian whites).For dinner, you have a choice between a 5-course tasting (where you pick the courses you want) or the 'Captain's Menu', which is an 8-course tasting that is driven by the chef's selection - although you can add in things you'd like to try (we mentioned the vitello tonnata and the lasagna, both of which came out). We went with the latter, and what a treat that was, even if the portions were smaller than what you would get with the 5-course option...I'm always a fan of trying more. While Del Posto is first and foremost Italian, there are enough different sources of inspiration that it almost feels like a contemporary American spot. That's evident from the amuse-bouches, which was an airy cracker topped with lightly-shredded Parmesan (an Italian focus), followed by a chicken broth and heavily herb-infused 'shot' of matzo ball soup...definitely not an Italian specialty. Next up was the coldest / most chilled sashimi I've ever had, but it was incredibly delicious and beautifully presented - 5 slices of fish (cured Arctic char, fluke, himachi, toro, and the reddest, most luscious-looking piece of tuna/maguro) served over olive oil...really good sashimi, and the olive oil gave each bite a nice smoothness. The vitella tonnato was quite good, with the veal having a tuna-like texture in some sense - enhanced by the fact it was covered in a tuna-infused sauce. Definitely the first time I'd had this dish, but it was quite delicious (and veritably Italian). The pastas were next and undoubtedly the highlight; the pork and veal agnolotti, served in richly-flavored black truffle butter, was the best dish of the meal. While the agnolotti individually were small, there were plenty served in a dish, allowing you to really savor the succulent, decadent flavor of the dish. The famed 100-layer lasanga was next, and that was great...almost as delicate as other layered foods (like crepe cake) but with a refined take on the richness of lasagna. The veal ragu, reduced in white wine, has a very clean, focused flavor instead of tasting like it was doused in tomato sauce - I really enjoyed that.The mains were solid, although the meat - a Colorado rack of lamb, served with a piece of neck, was much better than the sea offering (a Tuscan seafood stew). While the stew had an aromatic seafood-laced tomato broth that enhanced the seafood in the dish, the lamb was cooked absolutely perfectly, with the chop being so succulent and juicy while drenched in its jus, while the neck had that distinctive rich flavor that was lightened up with a dash of yogurt sauce. Dessert was fabulous as well, starting with a generous serving of La Tur cheese, paired with rye crackers and honey. It's a mix of sheep, cow, and goat's milk, and it has a mouthfeel akin to a firmer feta but with a light creamy texture and taste - great for adding the honey to. We finished with a pear crostata, which was fruity without being overly sweet, and the toasted walnut gelato gave it a thoroughly nutty flavor that was a perfect way to end a winter tasting menu.We were informed that even though Ladner is leaving, the menu largely consisted of the incoming chef's creations already (Melissa Rodriguez). Del Posto is sure to be in good hands when the changeover occurs, given that the food remains Italian at heart while having unique - and delicious - twists to it. It isn't as straightforwardly Italian as Lupa or Carbone, but it definitely deserves the accolades.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
135,S78Bu-qsI7yHnFASun7BEg,Deniz V.,4.0 star rating,"There's no doubt that the food is good quality, we left uncomfortably stuffed, and the service was probably the most over the top, attentive service I've ever experienced, but the dishes were definitely hit and miss.We had the tasting menu with 3 pastas along with probably the best fresh baked mini baguette like breadsticks with a delicious whipped buttery cream spread. In addition to the antipasti, secondi, 3 pastas, bread and dessert, there were quite a few amuse bouches and extra desserts that came in a fancy rotating jewelry box like centerpiece of which each drawer had different delights.I started with: LOBSTER alla Cesare - Grilled Romaine, Sweet Sour Onions & Pane Grattato and while the flavor was nice, the lobster was a little tougher than expected.BAULETTI - Roman Sheep's Milk Ricotta & Black Truffle Butter Â - Very creamy filling and a strong earthy truffle flavor. Â Pretty good, but a bit heavy on the truffle flavor.Sweet Potato CAPPELLACCIBrutti ma Buoni & Toasted Sage - Quite good, and a bit sweet with a hazelnut dusting.Traditional Del Posto GARGANELLI Verdi Â al RagÃ¹ Bolognese & Parmigiano-Reggiano- Probably the most simple flavor but also maybe my favorite. Â Balanced and not too sweet or strong flavored sauce and just very fresh and tasty.Burnt BEEF Rib Eye Â Charred Onion Salad & Eggplant alla Pizzaiola - The crust was delicious and crusty, but the beef itself was a bit chewy and tougher than expected. Â More on the medium side than medium rare, I thought, and I was not impressed with this one overall.Dessert - Apple Arrosto Hazelnut Cake & Sage Gelato - Sounded heavenly and the sage gelato was delicious and unique, the rest of the dish wasn't very good. Â The cake was bland and dry, and the apple arrosto was similar. Â Fortunately they brought out a plethora of other small sized dessert bites, of which the sour canteloupe jelly bites were my favorite. Â Service is on the slower side, as the meal took 3 hours, but there are so many courses interspersed throughout the night that you never feel hungry.

I have been to the restaurant many times in the past and always had a lovely experience. This time was even more special because it was my husband's birthday. I spoke to the restaurant ahead of time and asked for a dessert to be brought at the end and a personalized menu with his name and a birthday message. They were very accommodating and on top of everything. We had the 5 course tasting menu and it feels like so much more because they bring you complimentary courses in between. While everything was spectacular, here are some of the highlights:Arancini (rice ball) appetizerBeef tartareLasagnaOrecchiette Chocolate mint dessertThe bread and cheese/butter dip at the beginning is also phenomenal and I wanted to take home a vat of it. My husband had the lobster which he said was delicious (unfortunately I am allergic).The service as always was great and Thia (spelling?) was a delight. The personalized menus at the end were such a nice touch and I had it framed for my husband. Yes Del Posto is expensive and not for every day dining but it is absolutely worth every penny.

The jota was exceeded my expectations of a homemade soup with cannellini beans and smoked pork jowl. The beans were pureed with complex citrusy flavor, and a perfect compliment to the smokey meat. The amuse bouche trio was all visually stimulating and flavorful, and the complimentary sorbet at the end of the meal was also a new sensation; it was an apricot sorbet with some welcome sour qualities of a verjus, over hazelnuts and a bit of salt. I'm still thinking about this dish.This is a terrific place to sit at the bar and get three different small selections of pasta for a very reasonable price.

143,RonKz88ZyuevIyk7jFUbDw,Hamilton Y.,5.0 star rating,"Del Posto has long been on my list of restaurants to go to. Beyond rave reviews from all sorts of publications, many friends gave ringing endorsements particularly in regards to their service. When I heard Chef Mark Ladner was leaving at the end of January I scrambled for a reservation.The service was impeccable and if you are ever seeking that true white glove experience, you should come to Del Posto. I have never encountered more knowledgeable waiters regarding their own menu, particularly in light of its length, nor any who have balanced that fine line of being present but not overly intrusive so well.Food wise we opted for the Captain's menu, which is an eight course meal. Del Posto can either choose for you or you can dictate your own menu to whatever degree you desire with some restrictions. The last two courses are always cheese and dessert which was fine.I went with one appetizer the lobster salad. I thought this was well done. The lobster had the right springiness and paired well with the aioli and herbs. I followed this with three pastas. The linguine alla scampi, the 100 layer lasagna and the oxtail raviolo. The oxtail was my favorite as they stuff an oxtail ragu into an oversized ravioli. The Caciocavallo cheese on top that was melted was a nice touch. The linguine alla scampi came second. The langostines were delicious and the lemon really complimented it well. It's very al dente though so some patrons should be wary if they like their pastas very soft. The lasagna came in last. The bolognese at the bottom was delicious but I felt that my lasagna came out on the dryer side. They torch it to create the crispiness associated with the crusty edge pieces Â of a lasagna but I think this effect was a little lost on me.For the primis we had the roasted stripe bass and the burn beef rib eye. Both were great dishes. The stripe bass had a nice crust but was perfectly tender inside. The burnt beef rib eye was just a great cut and the herb vinaigrette added just enough sourness to help cut through the fat. In terms of the cheese course I picked the 24 months Parmigiano with the 25 year balsamic vinegar. These were high quality ingredients and the gnocco fritto carried them really well. Lastly for dessert I had the chocolate budino. I really liked the rich almost fudge like budino and the coconut sorbet paired very well. I was slightly less enthusiastic about the date and almond cake but that was primarily because I expected a stronger almond flavor as I don't love dates so this was a consequence more of personal choice than execution.Overall this was one of the best meals I've had in a while and I would recommend it to anyone.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Â Before leaving us to arrange our meals with the kitchen, our ""captain"" asked us a few questions about our tastes in foods, such as whether we enjoyed the flavor of truffles; whether or not we ate any raw meats or fish; if we liked pork, beef, veal, and/or lamb; and how well done we preferred meats. Â Clearly having learned useful things about what we like, and how we like it, he went off to arrange the dining experience, which consisted of the following:* Truffled Beef Carne Cruda with crunchy salsify chips, paired with GÃ­nÃ­ Soave Classico ""Salvarenza Vecchie Vigne"" 2012 from the Veneto.

Â We were also each treated to a sample of a bottle of 10 year old very fine Marsala wine. Â Based upon our scores for each of the items we dined on, we get a total average score of 95% for this very fine restaurant. Â Also notable, when we were finished, I was ""perfectly filled,"" content with how much I had eaten, but not feeling ""stuffed."" Â The next morning, I really didn't have much of an appetite for breakfast, which was fine with me.

Â Enjoying the city and the excellent dining it offers are the only reasons we're here, we're not here on business, and this isn't on some company expense account.

Â Please notice, Del Posto scored that high on THREE of its dishes, and one of them was the dessert! Â 100 for a dessert rarely happens in our experience.

166,PEN6LIIvX7ZRcFiorpcWmg,Jacquie V.,5.0 star rating,"This review is for the casual diner who likes to get fancy occasionally. This meal was likely one of the greatest treats I've ever had the pleasure of having. I'm going to sound pretentious for a second before I dial it down a notch, just to amp up my credibility a tad: I have traveled to Italy, Spain, Greece, I have had really great meals in very legit contexts, and this is up there. Okay, de-puffing chest now, tried to make that not too painful, but even I am wincing. Let me continue. So, back down here on earth: my boyfriend took me here for our anniversary dinner, so I knew it'd be a very special affair. But the experience was phenomenal. From a lovely and attentive waitress and waitstaff, to the perfect wine recommendation, to the incredible little bites in the beginning... ugh. I have a gluten allergy and a dairy allergy and they tailor your experience just for you, from top to bottom, with GF/DF offerings and PASTA (hand-rolled and just like the ""real thing"") and decadent dessert. The dessert was a smorgasbord of chocolate treats that was actual heaven. Every taste of food I had I had to roll in my mouth and savor. On. Point. I am not so refined that I sit during a meal paying too much mind to the nuances of flavor and texture... I am more about the holistic quality of the meal. I grew up with delicious Italian and Spanish homecooking and I am not used to the fine dining/artisanal foodie niche; I'm more like, ""does it taste great, does it feel great?"" But this food demanded that I note the details. The atmosphere was romantic, dimly-lit with luxurious decor and a twinkling piano in the background. You need to know: for dinner, you have two options, and they are both Prix Fixe, and they are both very expensive. 5 course is less pricey than 8 course, obviously, but with the latter they design you a custom experience rather than you choosing from the menu. Options, you have them. But make sure your wallet is prepared for an experience $500+ at the least. TL;DR: My boyfriend and I were sincerely delighted, genuinely stuffed, and exponentially more in love than when we began our anniversary celebration (KIDDING) after this dinner. We might make this our yearly tradition, being the weird creatures of habit we are. And one of my greatest and most beloved habits: eating lots of carbs and fats.

This was back in July.The items we ordered are no longer on the menu.This is a 3 hour lunch affair. The pacing is appropriate for the level of service.The food: 75%Agnolotti - very fresh, basic and straightforward, al dente pasta with understated flavors and a hint of buttery goodness. It definitely does not WOW you but a strong dish nonetheless.Basil Panna Cotta - so good! I didn't think the flavor would have worked but surprisingly it was an excellent combination. Unfortunately this dessert is no longer on the menu? Halibut - again, strong dish, clean flavors, the fish was definitely the star of the plate. There were other amuse-bouches and petit fours served before and after the meal. Nothing too exciting technique wise but were a good addition to the courses.The value: 60% for 100++ per person (including a cocktail and sparkling water), I'm not quite certain whether the food taste-wise justified the price tag. The service however was superb and everything was done to perfection with military precise execution among the servers, waiters and busboys.

The staff was constantly attending to us, explaining the menu, answering questions.. Tip #1: This should be reserved for a special event (remember you are spending a lot of money = equivalent to one month's worth of groceries). You will be asked if you are celebrating something and make sure you tell them. We were given an extra dessert at the end of our meal with a ""congratulations"" written on the plate. If you are not celebrating anything, lie and make something up :pTip #2: Make sure you are not rushing, because otherwise you will miss the whole experience. We spent 3 hours here for our 5 course dinner. The timing between plates was perfect.The service was incredible. the staff was well-organized and very attentive to every detail.

170,T2-uzv2NI9Jk-hEDV1WrBg,Marissa S.,4.0 star rating,"Elegant and refined, Del Posto is the kind of place where you dine to impress. With so many options to choose from within the Michelin-rated caliber that they are in, I picked this place for a luncheon with my sister while visiting NYC.We both chose the three course prix fixe for $49 as opposed to the six courses from the Captain's Menu for $95. From what I hear, it was only two weeks prior to our visit when they did the $10 increase from the $39 lunch menu. Nonetheless, even with the current rate, the whole dining experience was worth the total damage.Our server was polished and collected. He knew the menu rather well and had the perfect timing of when to approach us when needed. After serving my flute of refreshingly good Bellini, he started us off with the amuse bouche trio while we were still perusing the menu. It was beautifully presented but sadly the description of each was a mouthful for me to remember.The bread basket that culminates the courses seems to be something I always look forward to in places like this. Italian white bread (filoncino), rosemary focaccia, and olive ciabatta were each surpassingly fresh and scrumptious. The sweet cream unsalted butter was silky smooth and paired well with the rosemary and olive breads. The whipped pork lardo however, that's another story. I didn't have to smear an abundance of it to fully enjoy it, it was sensational. The only taste profile that comes to mind to best describe it is smoked bacon fat. There, I said it.My antipasti was the INSALATA AUTUNNALE with spicy nuts, buffalo robiola, and black currant sauce. The ingredients were fresh, crisp, and well thought-of, however, I can't help but wish I got the lobster salad with the $10 supplement instead. Pasta is what Del Posto is mainly known for so we agreed that a pasta taste was definitely in order for a $10 supp per person. The ORECCHIETTE with lamb neck ragu, orange carrots, and toasted rye was to say the least, my favorite dish here. Each pasta ear was sublimely al dente with a perfect bounce, while the lamb neck ragu was bursting with robust and in-depth flavors. I was willing to have this as my main course but unfortunately, they wouldn't let me, thus the ROASTED LAMB. The meat was cooked and seasoned to perfection but the pasta still lingers on my mind and taste buds.Dessert came and the BUTTERSCOTCH SEMIFREDDO and PECORINO ROMANO CAKE were our picks. Both were sinfully luscious in their own way that we wiped our plates clean as graciously as possible. Like we haven't had enough, a wooden box of mignardises was laid out in front of us. Atop what looks like a cheese grater are cream-filled bombolinis and chocolate covered ice cream pops. While my sister and I both stare with amusement and glee, our server then pulls out a drawer with dehydrated grapefruit jelly and rich dark chocolate ganache. Wow! Our capacity was maximized but somehow we made room for this sweet indulgence.A three-hour lunch is a luxury in itself but having it here at Del Posto where even my purse gets a cushion stool to lay on is beyond impeccable. I wouldn't expect any less from restaurateurs Batali and the Bastianichs. With that said, it was a bit of a surprise for me to find myself flagging someone down, not just once, for our water glasses to be refilled. I was also a little dismayed when my request to sub the main course for pasta dishes was declined. Surely, for a restaurant that specializes in this, it would only benefit them to showcase what they're good for.Michelin gave them 1 star but here's a solid 4 from me.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

First off, the reservationist mistakenly booked us for Dec. 28, then offered us a later time on Dec. 27, which they later also took back. After another long phone call with the director of guest relations, our original reservation was suddenly ""re-confirmed."" I was willing to forgive this. But then...Here are some of impressions of the food:- ""1000-layer lasagna"" looked like a piece of bread and almost tasted like one, with a minuscule amount of sauce. The dish was the size of a deck of playing cards, highway robbery for $39.- Veal chop and ribeye were tender but the flavor wasn't there. Not worth $72...apiece.- Parmigiano reggiano...I wish I took a picture. We got some pieces that amounted to no more than your thumb, for $25. This was the dish that made me log on to write this review, as a warning to all.- I will say the coffee panna cotta was superb but the $25 price tag was criminal.If the restaurant showed a bit more restraint in pricing or a little more generosity in portion size, I would give another star. After a lifetime of eating in NY I've rarely seen this level of gouging. The service was excellent but the food-for-money proposition is just not there. To those who would ask why I was shocked at the prices, I say, because the prices are not on the restaurant website. They're not even in the menu IN THE RESTAURANT. If you don't do the tasting menu, the waiter recites what each dish costs and it's up to you to do the math in your head to get a sense of where your credit card statement is headed as you order.I have been to Per Se and Sushi Nakazawa several times and have no problem paying triple digits for an unforgettable experience, but this restaurant's entrees are not even worth $25 apiece in my opinion, let alone up to $72. It's rare to see a restaurant get not three, or three and a half, but four full stars on Yelp!, which is why I was all the more baffled after this meal.

I highly suggest the chef's tasting menu, but since Del Posto is flooded with food reviews, here is why you'll go to treat your palate: bread served with creme fraiche, burrata-like cultured butter that lets you know from course #1, you've made the right decision. Next, the chef will include the 100 year lasagna that will leave you wondering who had to stack all these layers and is this heaven when it comes to pasta?!

183,jQsgdEnxlYO2rxZlyIgQDQ,Bessie B.,5.0 star rating,"My husband and I visited Del Posto for the first time to celebrate his birthday. The head waiter explained that the single menu can be used for either a la carte ordering or building a tasting menu. We intended to order a la carte; however, as prices weren't listed we reasoned that the 5-course tasting menu would ultimately be a better deal. When I told the waiter we wanted to do the tasting menu after all, he didn't ask me to clarify whether I wanted the 5-course or the 8-course, so they proceeded with delivering the 8-course version. I was already prepared to drop a mint at this restaurant, but was frustrated with myself that I'd neglected to specify just the 5-course (which would have been $149 per person versus $179). On the plus side, I can say that we left absolutely stuffed and pleased after our 8 courses. The waiter also brought out three scoops of sorbet at the end with ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate on the plate. Nobody sang or made a scene, to my husband's relief.The restaurant is massive with good space between the tables, elegantly decorated, and dimly lit, making it a romantic scene. Multiple staff members see to your every need. Although if one person at the table is doing a tasting menu, everyone at the table must participate in a tasting menu, it doesn't have to be the same foods. While I'm vegetarian and can't eat eggs, my husband has no dietary restrictions, so the staff was very gracious about providing two entirely different meal plans. Each course they brought me was creative and tasty, and I was very pleased with the result. To start, there was a roasted winter vegetable salad, I had a delicate shell-shaped pasta flavored with an amazing fresh pesto and cream sauce, orecchiette pasta with delicious marinara sauce, roasted cauliflower florets with a mushroom nut ragu, and for dessert a scrumptious scoop of tartufo ice cream coated with crispy, cookie crumb-like cocoa nibs. It was all very delectable and enjoyable to progress through each course and see what they'd come up with next. Overall, I'd say this is the Italian equivalent of Daniel restaurant.Be very clear in your needs, whether ordering a la carte or how many courses for the tasting menu, and specifying dietary restrictions. You can email the restaurant a few days in advance of your reservation to re-confirm your reservation and clarify these requests, which is what I did. That way, upon being seated at our table, the waiter was already aware of my dietary restrictions (which I repeated again anyway, just to be triple sure). They also ask what kinds of foods you like and don't like, to further customize your tasting menu.Although I made my reservation 30 days in advance, the only dinner-time availability they had for a Saturday was 5:15, which seemed to early. However, if you're doing the tasting menu, be prepared to be in the restaurant for a long time. We didn't leave until about three hours later, so the early sit-down time ended up being ideal.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Ohhhh......breadgasm. Ohhhh....Ahhhhhh.......Truffled Beef Carne cruda, and Fried Calamari and Zucchini. Ohhhh.......Garganelli Verdi with bolognese sauce. Ahhhh......Chicken Scarpariello and Pork Tenderloin. Ohhhh.....Butterscotch Semifreddo and Sweet Pea Panna Cotta.

We walked-in on a Thursday evening and I was fully prepared to be laughed out of the place. Who just WALKS in and gets a table? Oh, there's two seats by the bar? We'll take it. Our server was impeccable. All the servers were lovely. The pianist that arrived a little later on was lovely. I felt transported to a completely different time and place. The bread, the lardo spread (gasp), the lentil soup, the spaghetti with crab (is this what heaven tastes like?). The dessert spread that came rendered me speechless.

194,VQRLyf3JxfL8U2d5cPKvyA,Nancy D.,1.0 star rating,"Pompous,presumptuous, pretentious, puzzling, and painful. Â I truly don't understand how this restaurant rates so highly unless people are impressed by grandiosity - it certainly isn't the food. Â The first hint I had that this would be a less than stellar experience was when they brought foot stools for our purses - geez Louise - how pompous is that? Â Is their floor really that dirty? Â I don't really lick my purse.The interior is grand and dark with lovely table settings. Â The staff was friendly and accommodating. Â And that's all I have to say on the positive side of things. Oh and the bathroom was nice.I don't mind paying outrageous prices for food that stirs my soul but this was so mediocre that I felt obliged to write about it. Â The menu is indecipherable without assistance from the waiter - who willingly translated - why not offer a menu in English? Â Or a choice of English or Italian? The course pacing was slow and painful - it took almost 3 hours to eat dinner. Â I'm a fan of leisurely dining but this was extreme. Â The most hysterical part of dinner was the choreography required to present and remove courses - 3 'under' waiters lined up behind 3 chairs and simultaneously bent to present or retrieve plates. Â It got to the point where I was saying ""and a one and a two"".........way over the top. Â Ok - I lied - the bread was delicious - however the combination of 'cultured cream' (i.e., good ole sour cream), creme fraiche, and some olive oil did nothing for the bread or for me. Â Why not some great butter, great olive oil, or a great sauce to dip the bread in? Â Neither of the pastas had decent sauces - barely there. Â AND the entire table had to agree on the 2 pastas - huh? Â For what ended up being about $350 per person? Â No thanks. Â I admit we did go for a bunch of stuff that had up charges but still.........how many times have 7 people been able to agree on anything?The langoustine were bland and served with a bland pasta - I had never had bad langoustine before - and only 2 of the little buggers in an entire plate. Â Veal chop was perfectly done and ruined by a cacophony of unrelated veggies and trimmings that overwhelmed and underwhelmed at the same time. Â Plus the 'special' knife given to us to cut the veal was duller than kindergarten scissors (or maybe the veal was that tough?). Â We opted for the wine pairings - not impressed. Â Only Italian wines are served here, I asked. Â Except champagne..........maybe they should invest in some great California or French or even Australian wines. Â I'm not a wine snob, I just know what I like and I didn't even have the urge to ask what each wine was - which I normally do if I really enjoy a pairing. Â Somebody smack me upside the head if I EVER want to go to a celebrity chef's restaurant again! Â I think this has finally convinced me that the name matters naught - only the food matters and so far, all the celebrity chef restaurants have been a major disappointment in that department.ps - I looked up a couple of Mario recipes and I see that his recipe for chili includes green olives and quail eggs..........that should give like minded folks an idea of how inconceivably weird his taste is...........",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

The ambience is spectacular and the servers are attentive, giving the restaurant the luxury feel that the price commands ($179 per person for an eight-course). The chef was very informative and amenable to customizing the menu based on our vegetarian restrictions. However, based on the price that we paid, and the reviews that we had read, what we perceived to be a lack of flavor in the food left a great deal to be desired. The wine selections were abundant and our server gave us great suggestions. Based on the taste of the food alone and discounting the atmosphere, I personally found the the restaurant to be very overpriced and overrated, and substandard to other Michelin-star restaurants that I have visited.

The primi were a lobster ravioli and a serving of cloud-like gnocchi which were as light and delicious as I last remember them.My main course was the grilled pork which was served at a perfectly cooked medium and was loaded with porky flavor while being juicy and delicious.Dessert was a series of Italian petit fours which I, as normally not a dessert person, found to be amazing and not overly sweet.

All other patrons were mostly suited up (men) and the women were dressier. The table did the 5 course tasting menu, where each guest chose their own antipasto and secondo, while the primi pasta was shared family style (choose 2). We didn't do the wine pairing, but opted for individual cocktails and wine instead. Dinner started at 7:30 and we were there for about 3 hours.Antipasto:- Fin Fish Susci del Giorno, which is their version of sashimi (tuna, char, mackarel, i forget the last 2). Very fresh, but pieces are smaller than what you'd normally receive at a japanese restaurant.- Lobster alla Cesare: loved it, very refreshing and definitely sizeable portion of lobster for an appetizer- Truffled Beef Carne Cruda: not usually a carne crudo or steak tartare person, as i prefer the taste of raw fish more, but the dish here was excellently made. Truffle flavor was complementary without being overpowering.Primi - portions are also smaller for this course - similar to the antipasto- Traditional Del Posto Garganelli Verdi & DP Agnolotti dal ""Plin"": Liked the Del Posto Garganelli more as it was spinach pasta with bolognese. The Agnolotti was also good, but was a bit more simple in flavor.Secondi:- Lobster: Portion here is almost double that of the lobster antipasto, but similarly fresh and tender.- Chicken: Chicken was very tender, flavor simple, yet refreshing. - Beef Rib Eye: Portion for this dish is a large when you're this far into the meal and compared to the other secondi dishes. As other reviewers have mentioned, the texture is a bit chewy/sinewy, as well as a bit too salty for my taste.Dulci: We didn't get to choose our dessert, but the table had two options. I didn't like either as both were very similar tasting. One was a toffee flavor, the other a coffee/chocolate flavor. I like chocolate, but the dishes served were a bit too sweet.Service is amazing here, everyone is very attentive and takes the time to explain all the dishes and courses.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

The lunch is a tremendous value for what you receive. We did the 3 course price fixed option but also added a pasta course to share. The manager Thomas Russo was stellar in recommending an Italian Chardonnay. I described what I like and he found an exact bottle to please our tastes. The starter before the courses arrived were perfectly delectable with a taste of lentil soup, radish and a chickpea patty that was like heaven in a nibble. The bread basket did not disappoint. Mini baguettes, focaccia and olive bread with sweet cream butter and the most flavorful lard spread you can imagine. For the meal, I ordered the Ensalada Estiva (?spelling). This little salad had so many complex flavors and components that every bite was as if it was a new dish. I wanted to take a photo of it's gorgeous presentation but before I knew it, it was gone. The next course was the Ewe Farm Ricotta pasta dish with truffle butter. So light, like a fluffy truffle and ricotta cloud. So happy we added this course into the mix. For my secondi I chose the Lamb. The lamb was served two ways. Lamb on the bone with a crunchy, slightly spicy crumble and neck meat braised with spicy eggplant and peppers. I have to admit that I wanted more, I had to settle for that spicy afterglow and look forward to dessert. It is good that I left a sliver of room because the dessert was knock your socks off good. It just kept coming and each taste was unique, layered with flavor and balanced perfectly. A beautifully written ""happy 10th anniversary"" message in chocolate was a perfect touch. The service was superb. Thomas Russo is one of those people who is born to be a front of the house guy. He made sure our every second of this experience was nothing short of perfection. I can't imagine a better dining experience. We plan to return as often as possible, maybe even making up special occasions to justify the trip.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

223,qE1wfkUVhvVwC4RESaTCJA,Perry T.,5.0 star rating,"Del Posto has been a pilgrimage of sorts for my family and me. Sadly my mother passed before we were able to go. When my dad and brother and I went last weekend, it was very bittersweet. The restaurant itself is beautiful and impressive. We sat on the second level which is a balcony looking out over the rest of the dining area. One of our many waiters/waitresses gave me a ""purse stool"" for my bag, which was completely unnecessary, but an extravagant touch that I liked. Our sommelier was very knowledgeable about all the wine without sounding condescending or like a know-it-all. He answered our questions and recommended the most incredible wines based on what we told him we liked and disliked. We opted to order wine by the glass rather than do the wine pairing with the menu. We were brought giant bread baskets throughout the evening, which was both amazing and a curse, as I kept eating the focaccia, but wanted to save room for my meal!We did the basic Del Posto menu (one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert per person plus 2 pastas for the table to share). For appetizers we had: truffled beef carne cruda, lobster alla cesare, and the vitello tonnato. Everything was perfect: the truffled beef was rich and tender and topped with crispy ""potato chips"" for lack of better descriptor. My lobster alla cesare was a very generation portion of lobster with the most perfect Ceasar salad - in fact, to call it a Caesar salad diminishes just how delicious it was. The vitello tonnato was veal treated like a very upscale tuna salad - it was very good, but our least favorite appetizer.The two pastas we shared were the garganelli verdi and orchiette. The garganelli verdi were spinach pastas shaped like penne - an extremely dark and beautiful green color, tossed with a light bolognese - nothing too heavy or creamy that would weigh us down so early in the meal. The portions are small enough that you can eat the whole thing and not feel stuffed, but rather perfectly sated. The orchiette with lamb was transcendental, perhaps because it's such a humble dish, but had elements that I'd never before thought of or tasted in that dish: sweet roasted carrots, rye, and somehow it all worked. It may have been my favorite thing that evening.I was a gigantic pig and ordered for my entree the pork trio (oh the irony). There was cheek, loin, and pancetta and it was extravagant, gluttonous, and absurdly delicious. The loin was perfectly pink, the pancetta crispy and flavorful to the point that regular bacon seems tasteless, and the cheek melty, crispy, and oh my god, it was heaven. My brother had the salmon, which had been poached in olive oil and had the texture of butter. It was melty and tender and unlike any salmon I've ever had. My dad poached lobster which came on a puddle of the creamiest polenta. Everything was divine.The service throughout the meal was immaculate, attentive, elegant, and made us feel like royalty. Once we had finished our meal our waiter asked if we were there to celebrate any special occasion. We paused before saying that yes, we were there to belatedly celebrate my parents' 30th anniversary and that my mother had passed before we had been able to do so. The waiter was gracious and insisted that we leave dessert up to him. The desserts he selected for us (after we said we liked cheese plates for dessert) were 2 different cheese plates and some delicious confection that wasn't on the menu - a combination of gelatos with a crispy cracker/cookie thing. He also brought out a box of assorted petit fours, cookies, and little bites. Everything was perfection: the intimate ambiance, the impeccable service, the extreme attention to personal detail (he had the chef write ""Happy Anniversary"" in chocolate on our dessert plate""), the compassion, the exquisite food...this was a pilgrimage well worth the wait and the price. Highly recommend to any foodie looking for a very special experience.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Â Ok, any restaurant who has 3 food icons casually sitting by the bar during their lunch time is good for me :)The service is impeccable here and don't be swayed by the tourists who show up here in casual dress sitting amongst the power suit and tie diners; the service is equal for all. Â If you really want to do it right through and make your life easy, definitely get the captains lunch- for 135 a person your server will work with you to curate a wonderful 5 course menu with lots of little extras along the way ;) The food is rotating but I must say it was an impeccable lunch.

We had no idea it was a course menu, but we were game. (And thankful that on a Friday night, they were able to accommodate walk ins)The decor was tasteful and not overwhelmingly stuffy. (very cozy and romantic with candles all around) The staff was super attentive, friendly, and very knowledgable about the menu items, without feeling like they were hovering. Even the check at the end was unique, it looked like a hotel invoice, and they sent us home with a small box of chocolates! (Don't get me wrong, I loved the parting gift...but I never had that experience before lol)My bf and I opted for the 5 course meal, which including all the extra tastings courtesy of the chef, were well portioned. It's the best feeling in the world to be at that perfect level of fullness and to know that the food that got you to this state was exquisite. Some food highlights: Truffled beef was my favorite. Sometimes truffle can be overdone, but this was just the right amount of flavor to complement the aged beef, and the tiny chips on top to give a nice texture contrast. SUSCMII was also really great; the fish was fresh and the sauces/seasoning were enhancing, not overpowering. For the Secondi, both the Lobster and the Lamb were very melt in your mouth delicious. My bf really loved the Agnolotti in the pasta choices. And the bread and butter, simply wonderful.In conclusion, this place is amazing and worth every $.

Wow, pair it up with their AMAZING bread, and you have a winner. Their ribeye was a winner as well.One thing that was not worth it was the truffle supplement.

Â The aroma of the cheese was so inviting. Yum....Bread basket is the next item. We get an extra basket for my boss & I as we both ask for gluten free option.

Of course I can't miss out on the truffle butter & sweet butter also virgin oil that goes with the bread.-Salad with Truffled dressing was just heavens.-Lobster salad was amazing.-Chestnut RAVIOLI with Black Truffle Butter. I can believe it's gluten free. I can taste the chestnut paste inside. Very flavorable.-ORECCHIETTE Spicy Lamb Neck Sausage, Orange Carrots & Toasted Rye, again, can't believe it's gluten free and the sausage is very flavorable.-Slow cook Chicken, I don't know how they made this chicken so tender.-We had mixed dessert.

233,NVBlBxRNzmN-IlbsYdksYQ,Nick C.,5.0 star rating,"This was quite an experience. I had never been to del Posto before but I was not working that day and went for lunch. It is a large space done in dark wood Â with tall ceilings and additional seating on one side on a second level. The floors are marble. I was greeted at the door and seated immediately. [When I called prior to coming to see if a reservation was required, I was told that it is always better to have a reservation] As patrons were coming in, they were seated so that each patron's privacy was maintained-there was adequate space between tables. A small Â stool was placed near the chair of women to place their handbags on as opposed to the floor. Â I was given a warm towel to wipe my hands prior to eating. The chef [I was told] then sent some small bites for me to taste-they were delicious. If you go for lunch, there is a fixed priced menu for $49 which constitutes 3 courses-an appetizer, a main course and a dessert. You can also order a primi piatti [first course] pasta if you wish to have it but this is extra. Everyone is polite and greets you, even if they are not involved with your table.. I ordered a salad [greens/bitter herbs] as my appetizer, which was delicious, baked chicken for my main course and coffee panna cotta as the desert. Silverware is changed in between courses and after your main course, you are given some gelato to cleanse the palate. The food comes in a timely fashion and you are asked if you want bread [It is a long spindle pointed on both ends and this comes with butter.] They have an extensive wine list and all members of the staff are knowledgeable about the food and a sommelier came over with an ipad with the wine list. They are able to discuss which wine you might like and the characteristics of wines on their list. You do not feel overly stuffed at any point since the food comes at a reasonable pace.

I've been here several times now and I almost always choose the Garganelli Verdi with Ragu Bolognese. It's such a great tasting pasta. It used to be my favorite until I tried the Luna Piena. This pasta dish is otherworldly. The adjectives one would use to describe this pasta would be useless. It's an absolute must-try. The white truffle butter isn't overpowering at all. It's a very light and elegant pasta and I must have it again sooner rather than later. This pasta also has to be mentioned in the conversation of best pasta dishes in the city.I went with the five course prix fixe and in addition to the two pasta tastings, I chose the antipasti of Lobster alla Cesare, which was delicious, and the Heritage red wattle pork trio. This was a very good choice. However, between the pasta and amuses, I was completely stuffed and could not finish most of this dish.I had to find room in my belly for my favorite dessert here which is the Sfera Di Caprino. It's a celery sorbetto with fig agrodolce and it's amazing. It's a classic Del Posto dessert. It isn't for everyone as it's a veggie based dessert and not as sweet as most people like their desserts to taste. It's a very unique dessert and has been on the menu for as long as I can remember.

Â A beautifully lit tree stood regally in the center of the space, cast a romantic shadow on the diners on the first floor. The bar was sultry, dark and mysterious, a really great Â spot to grab a pre-dinner drink and people watch. We were brought some seasoned pretzels and mix to nibble on as we sipped on our wine.We were escorted up the grand marble staircase adorn with lush green garland and lights, to a quiet corner for our party of ten. We elected to do the five course dinner, the chefs did a wonderful job of creating alternative dishes to accommodate my recently acquired cheese allergy, that were flavorful and artfully presented. Each plate that came to the table was more like artistic masterpieces almost too pretty to eat.. We started with a wonderful amuse bouche- a pickled cucumber and radish and bean purÃ©e, followed by small bites of crispy kale balls, Mozzarella bites. I had the minted octopus as an appetizer- smoky crispy and very well flavorful. We ordered two pastas for the table the pumpkin ravioli- Â which I heard was to die for and the Â GarganelliI Verdi. For a main course, I had the poached lobster- oh my goodness, it was just heavenly, the 25 year old aged balsamic vinegar along with the creamy buttery sauce make a simply divine combination. I'm dreaming about it right now. The lamb dishes that came to the table, a perfect medium, The cuts were so tender and light, I was torn between which dish I liked better, the lamb coming into a very close second.For dessert, we were treated to the butterscotch semi freddo- melt in your mouth. The brown butter panna cotta and the Melanzane e Cioccolato. All there were a spectacular way to finish our meal!The ONLY thing that I would complain about is the coat check woman. I handed her my ticket, but she was more worried about saying goodbye to a guest standing in valet, she opened the door and almost knocked my ticket out of her hand! She raced out to the gentleman and had to get her cheeky air kiss out of the way-'so tacky! Then when she returned, I handed her my ticket, she rudely slapped my coat down without a glance in my direction or an apology. Apparently she feels that her coat check job is more of a social hour than anything else.

As soon as I entered, I felt out of place. I was in sweat pants and a hoodie, with a child under 4 years old. No judgement what so ever, they treated me and my family with the utmost respect. The service I received from the beginning to the end was impeccable. We decided to do the three course meal, although I really wanted to do the captain's menu (next time for sure).The first course I ordered was the Truffled Beef Carne Cruda, oh my goodness. I shared this plate with my significant other and even she agreed that this was dish just literally melted in your mouth. My second course was the Burnt Beef Rib Eye, oh my, the crispiness on the outside along with the tenderness inside was absolutely mouth watering. My 3rd course Grappa Panna Cotta. I'm not a very huge fan of dessert, but this dish was just so different and it was not some thing I expected, but I devoured the whole plate, because it was that good.Now for service here. It's the little things that count here. From bringing out a little stool to put the female's purses on instead of leaving it on the floor. When someone leaves to use the rest room, they cover your food. Their impeccable timing on when to come and when to leave. It's almost like they're not even there. They quickly come and do what they need to do, bring food, re-fill the waters, cover your plates, take away plates, or even ask if you wanted another drink. Even when the place got busier, they still kept us on their minds, not like other restaurants where they serve you and tend to forget about you until it's time to pay the bill.

The timing was already very off.All the waitstaff were friendly and after that initial mishap, things were progressing smoothly until we finished our main courses. By that time most of the lunch crowd was gone, but no one noticed our finished plates so they just sat there ... waiting to be taken away. When someone finally came, it was not our waiter but rather the busser, who then gave us our dessert menus. From that point on, we were never served by our previous waiter (or rather even a waiter) again, but rather a different busser each time (taking our dessert order, serving our dessert, collecting plates, asking us if we wanted coffee, bringing out bill). When we inquired about our missing waiter, they explained that all the waiters and bussers serve all the tables.

Â Assorted amuse-bouche: one was particular odd - daikon radish with sour kraut - unpleasant. Followed by a bread basket with butter and Lardo (not as refined as I have had but such pleasant surprise). Â A raw fish appetizer that would be hard to improve on.

Â I thought it was one note and super super salty**Orecchiette pasta with a fennel / ground sausage and broccoli rabe purÃ©e - this was the low point.

Â I think it was on page 47 of their wine list -- hailed by Wine Enthusiast every year -- and was $35 for the bottle. Â The sommelier was really nice about our search for an ""affordable"" wine. Â Then he brought out glasses for us, made one pour, and then then used that original pour to coat each glass in the wine. Â He then handed out the glasses and gave us each our individual pour.

Â This is a bunch of different seafood (I'm actually not sure there was a scallop in it!) that has a broth poured over it, so it eats like a soup dish. Â Lamb - it's lamb. Â It's delicious. Fluke - I was told not as great as the fresh ones on Long Island, but still pretty darn good. Â Desserts Panna Cotta - tasted like sugar suspended in butter. Â Almost too sweet and rich.Butterscotch Semifreddo - really good ice cream. Â Came with some orange segments that complimented it nicely.Ricotta - I love cheese plates! Â This was a slice of ricotta with honey and a toasted piece of bread. Â This was my favorite dessert and I am going to track down this cheese and make it at home! In addition to the desserts that come with lunch, you get a little dessert box on the house! Â It had 4 little mini desserts -- olive oil gelato pops, bombolino (little filled donuts), dark chocolate truffles, and carmelized sugared grapefruit. Â There was a live pianist who was playing a lot of showtunes. Â Our waiter was Stephen, who recognized my friend from a previous lunch and was quite friendly. Â Also, I loved that the wait staff times everything and moves in sync, so people at opposite ends of the table get their place settings / plates cleared / water poured at the same time. Â Every little detail made the experience feel cohesive and planned. Â At the end of the meal I went to the ladies room, which is comfortable and classy looking.

I don't know if it was just an off day but there was plenty of tables so making a reservation wasn't necessary. We did the lunch prix fixe with the supplementary pasta tasting, which was a great choice. They let you choose one type of pasta that everyone gets for an additional $10 pp. We decided on the lamb neck orecchiette which was delicious. The pasta was chewy and the sauce was delicious. I started off with the crostone which was sliced meat (I think it was ham) with sauce on top. It was okay but someone else got the lobster appetizer which they absolutely loved. The salad appetizer was fresh but less than stellar. For my main, I got the bass which had good seasoning on top and the cauliflower and broccoli on the side was amazing. The fish was alright but it might just be that bass isn't really to my taste, so I can't come up with a conclusive decision on its taste. It was good but nothing special. The lamb was good and the desserts were quite tasty as well. Though it took a while for them to bring out our desserts and it wasn't until I asked them did they bring it out. I feel like they should have at least asked us or something because we were sitting there with our finished entrees for a good while.

259,EIChz4MvwN-P8PlZKyVskA,Dawn G.,5.0 star rating,"One of the best dining experiences of my life. During a recent trip to New York I was fortunate enough to dine at Del Posto. I'm afraid that this restaurant has ruined me for all future meals because I will forever be comparing and judging all other restaurants against it. Knowing that I wouldn't be able to return soon, I opted for the 8-course captains menu. Being there alone on business, I decided to sit at the bar and proceeded to truly experience my food over a 3+ hour period.The bartender was my server and she was fantastic. Upon learning what types of adult beverages I like, she mixed a custom concoction to start my evening. It was lovely. Then she asked questions about my food ingredient preferences and took a few minutes to plan her recommendations for my 8 courses. She took care to note how each item would complement each other and give me a broad perspective of the menu. Once decisions were made, I was able to sit back, relax, and let my belly grow to three times the size of when I came in. :-)To start, I was provided a trio of amuse-bouche that were so amazing I almost wanted to cancel my order and just get eight courses of them. Yeah, that good. But then a second trio of amuse-bouche arrived and the smile on my face could not get any larger. Each course served thereafter elicited that ""oh my god"" face that truly indulgent food deserves. Like a true professional, my bartender/server paced the courses perfectly and was sure to give me time in between to digest and reflect upon what I'd just eaten. During this experience she also paired wines and digestives that reflected my personal taste preferences and went well with each dish. After the 8 courses were finished, I was treated to a petit fours dessert that ended the night on a great note. How the bartender/server extraordinaire managed all of this, I do not know, but the execution was sublime and will never be forgotten. Del Posto, I would walk through pouring rain and miles of claustrophobic pedestrian traffic to get to you again. Thank you!",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

I took a friend of mine here because he had never been before, he was memorized from the second we walked in. I made a 9:30pm reservation, but we arrived at 8pm and the maitre d said our table was ready when we were. We decided to sit at the bar and have a glass of wine first. You need to check this place out just to see the ambiance...they had a gentleman playing piano, candles lit everywhere, ridiculously high ceilings, beautiful draping curtains, & plush leather couches. The place reminds me of Mad Men, very 1960s upper class meets old school Â Italian romance. When I walk in here, I am reminded of a day when men wore suits everywhere, ladies always wore dresses and white gloves, men always held doors open for women and treated women like queens, I digress. We had two glasses of a spectacular Northern Italian blend of red wine at the bar. The bar was pretty quiet. There were a few business men and a couple sitting at the bar, but overall the place was pretty quiet. After our drinks, we were seated in the main dining area. They had us sit next to each other, which was fine, but I was out with a friend of mine, so it was a little strange. Nonetheless, the waiter came over and took our drink order, he was fit the mold of Del Posto so well, good looking older gentleman in a nice suit, reminded me of Alfred from Batman. He was amazing. We started with a Vintage wine and told the waiter we would do the 5 course tasting menu. He asked if we had any dietary restrictions and I said, I don't eat red meat, easy enough. They brought out some awesome homemade bread with the most delicious butter I have ever tasted in my entire life. For dinner I had: lobster salad, fantastic, how can you go wrong here? I tasted my friend's tuna tartare with truffle. Wow. Then came the two pasta dishes, both were excellent. The butternut squash pasta dish was amazing. For a main entree, I had organic farm raised chicken and he head stead. I couldn't even finish it, I was so full, but it was delicious. For desert they brought us two unique dishes, I can't even begin to describe. They also brought over some chocolates and cookies compliments of the chef. I really shouldn't have eaten all day, I was so full I wanted to die.The service overall was spectacular, the staff was overly attentive and the timing of the dishes was perfect. There's not one thing I can possibly complain about. Okay, I lied, I always leave so full I wanna go right home and pass out!",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

I finally had the chance to check them out this week, not for lunch but for dinner, to celebrate my parents' wedding anniversary. Unfortunately, my experience was rather disappointing. The service was top notch, as any Michelin should be. I was disappointed to find out that the two pasta dishes were not enough to consider the whole restaurant as an 'Italian' affair. If this were lunch at $40, this would have been great! Dinner, I felt like I was paying for more so for service than food itself.

262,O3omvWuAM4jSaPbqCx86sw,Captain G.,3.0 star rating,"Summary is Del Posto should stick to serving Italian food, wine and dessert. Wine recommendations were good. $250/head including alcohol is decent which led to 3 stars. For the meal, the kitchen staff could ease up on the salt and put a little bit more passion on the food presentation (maybe asking for a bit much here). We'd a good experience with the staff as they're friendly and attentive. Below is a detailed review of our experience:Had the captain's chef tasting. Started with complementary appetizers which were good - lentil soup was a bit on the salty side. Bread followed soon after which was warm and fresh.First course for us was a sushi dish which was disappointing. To paraphrase what my friend said: I am dining in an Italian restaurant, why am I served sushi. I believe Del Posto should stick to its roots and leave the sushi to a Japanese restaurant -- unless it wants to be rebranded as a fusion restaurant.The veal, tuna and pasta with squid egg was the next item which was a bit salty. I didn't like the pasta and tuna combo. Too weird for my taste. Maybe they are really heading toward the fusion angle?Sheep's milk cheese ravioli with black truffles was our next dish which was awesome. Del Posto should stick to Italian. Next up was the pasta with lamb which I'd before. Not too bad. The lamb was a bit overcooked but I think it is ok as lamb can be gamy when served rare. Again. Stick with the pasta. The raw lobster dish was next. Can't really screw that up. Veal with potatoes and kale was next. Met expectations. Veal was tasty - cooked right. Triple cheese (goat, sheep and cow) was the next course with bread and honey which was the final course. We ended the meal with a tons of desserts to wrap up the meal. Not great but ok. I'm open to speaking with Mario and Joe to improve my experience.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
263,D5OHGTQHpgHWeN6ROZnqCQ,Sally C.,4.0 star rating,"Came here to celebrate James' birthday! The venue itself is very much something I would expect from Meatpacking. It actually reminded me of Vegas because it was over the top fancy. Even the tiling on the floors reminded me of Vegas. For dinner, you have the choice of a 5 course menu for $115 or the 8 course Â menu for $165. We got the 5 course menu and a bottle of white wine to go with the seafood. The sommelier was really helpful in choosing the wine in the extensive wine list. The amuse bouche came with a cauliflower soup, which was quite tasty, a small chicken salad sandwich and something else that had cod and came with a toasted cracker. They were all okay. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the bread basket. The bread was soft and freshly warm, and the butter and pork fat spreads were amazing!The five course meal comes with the choice of an appetizer, two shared pastas, main course and dessert. For appetizers, we got the charred octopus and the chilled lobster. The octopus was the best octopus I've ever had in my life. It was incredibly tender yet chewy, charred just right on the sides and went incredibly well with the balsamic vinegar. Â The chilled lobster was also quite excellent. For pastas, we chose the spaghetti with dungeness crab and jalapeÃ±o. The first time it came out, I didn't enjoy the dish and I actually remarked that it was too salty. The hostess actually overheard (whoops) but was really nice about it and insisted that the chefs prepare the dish again to our liking. We obliged and the second time the dish was much better. I loved how the jalapeno accented the dish and thought the spaghetti was cooked perfectly al dente. We also got the calamarata with two types of basil leaves. It was good but not as good as the first pasta. The flavors did blend incredibly well together and I enjoyed the seafood on the side. Entrees were lobster (theme of the night) and a seafood stew. J didn't like the lobster, which I thought was delicious, and I didn't like the stew, which I thought was too salty, but we enjoyed our individual dishes. Lastly, dessert! This was probably my favorite part of the meal. I got the chocolate cake with olive oil gelato and thought it was amazing. The cake was not overly sweet and the flavors of the chocolate were complemented extremely well by the gelato, which was absolutely amazing. J got the butterscotch semifreddo, which he really liked but I thought was too sweet. They also gave us an assortment of desserts, the best of which was a chocolate covered olive oil lollipop. The service here was top notch, even for a one Michelin star restaurant. Pricy meal but you are very well fed. I could barely waddle out at the end of the meal.

I don't know if this is always on the menu, but it's basically a blob of cheese (looks similar to cottage cheese) on top of red pepper sauce and anchovies. Not my favorite, and not very aesthetically pleasing either! In fact, I would highly recommend that you look up all the dishes up online if you don't understand them, or ask the waiter. Unless you're an ultra foodie or Italian, you probably won't be able to guess what all of them are. The stracciatella definitely surprised me. On the other hand, I would highly recommend the summer salad primavera!! Wonderfully plated and a very unique mixture of greens, beets, cheese, and fruit. So refreshing and pleasant to look at! It also looked like they put quite a bit of effort into plating it too. The quality of the foods just vary so much here. You can actually go wrong by ordering the wrong item from the menu, so choose carefully. That's my guess for why they're only one Michelin star, haha.The overall atmosphere here is a little more formal, and all the wait staff are extremely proper and courteous. Makes me want to sit up straighter and be more business-like myself. ;) It was a bit funny to see a family dressed in sneakers and polo shirts with a toddler in a stroller sitting in the corner.

271,CqskJUXT1joyaQjzvHPA0A,June P.,5.0 star rating,"A few girlfriends and I came to Del Posto for their prix fixe lunch on a summer Friday (has a lovelier sentence ever been written on my Yelp? I think not). We had been hyping it up for weeks and squealing every time we talked about how excited we were for it - which can sometimes mar the experience itself when it finally happens, but Del Posto more than delivered. From the moment we entered the restaurant we were treated like royalty, without making us feel too out of place. There's always that fine line between receiving impeccable service and feeling awkward and uncomfortable like you don't belong. The staff at Del Posto walked that line deftly and effortlessly; we felt relaxed and laid back but very well taken care of at the same time. I mean, my PURSE got its own stool to sit on. The lunch itself was a 3 hour-long affair with a bevy of dishes. It started with a few delicious amuse bouches and the most amazing bread basket, accompanied by a dollop of rosemary lardo (I just swooned) and organic creamed butter. To die for. Once the courses began, we broke from convention a little and passed all our plates around to make sure everyone got to try a little of everything. I won't go into detail of every course since you should experience it for yourself, and because the menu is very seasonal it will probably have changed in a few months, but everything was excellent, just perfectly prepared and plated, beautiful to look at and had us ooh-ing and aah-ing the whole time. Standouts for me were the ribeye (safe to say best steak I've had in many years) and the truffled beef tartare with crispy salsify chips. What can I say, I like beef.Halfway through our meal something magical happened and we ended up being the only table remaining in the restaurant. 1:45 is the last available sitting for lunch, and I recommend this time because you'll most likely end up having the experience we did - it felt as if the restaurant had opened specially just for us, and even though there were workers steaming the tablecloths and setting up for dinner service around us, we never once felt rushed or pressured about staying as long as we did. Again, such a testament to the incredible service we received... did I mention they put a silver dome over your food to keep it warm while you go to the restroom (to which they personally escort you)?When it was time for dessert, we were treated to getting to try all of them instead of having to choose just one each, as well as second helpings of the dessert wine pairing. Such a decadent and unexpected touch, what a way to end an already spectacular meal. At $49 per person for the 3 course prix fixe, this lunch experience is not to be missed. And even though with the wine pairings, upgraded courses (things like a pasta course, truffles and lobster will add up to $10, $20 per person), we did end up paying quite a bit more than that, the flawless meal and service had us happily paying our bill. I left Del Posto very full and dreamy-eyed, wishing this could be my real life every day.

I told him my father was visiting from the other side of the world which he only does once a year, so I assumed he would know what he was choosing. He chose chocolate cake which was good and some fried bread with ricotta. The fried bread was warm but I honestly really would have wanted something more delicate or dessert like. Honestly, on a special occasion and at a restaurant like Del Posto who would pick that? He didn't even ask what we liked when he chose. And when he came to ask how it was, he ran away so briskly I had no time to say anything. He also left in a hurray when dropping off the check never to return. He recommended a primi which I thought was blah as well. I didn't hate it but didn't love it as well. 4) Atmosphere - 4.5 starsFor lunch it was quiet and very relaxed. In conclusion, would I come back here again? No. I can think of other places where I can get better value for amount spent, even for lunch. It's a great place if you want to have a long meal to catch up but food wise I would give it three stars. I was looking forward to this meal, and honestly I would have given it four stars, if the end note with desserts had been kept up to standard. I wish I had chosen somewhere else for my special occasion. For a level of this establishment, I think the main server needs to know not to drop the ball or be more considerate in details.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

When the owners (Lidia Bastianich and Mario Batelli) are sitting across from the bar doing a tasting for their new menu and you're sitting there witnessing it, you know you've stumbled into something special.I will put a disclaimer; this is one of the most expensive meals I've ever eaten so far- but well worth it! We arrived earlier than expected for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. We were escorted to the bar and had a drink. The gentleman also wished him a happy birthday which I thought was a nice touch because it showed that he actually read the note on the reservation.Dinner starts promptly at 5:30pm. People are dressed to the 9's so make sure you are in your finest attire. Our waiter was an Italian man who was super friendly and cordial. Now let me get on with the dinner. Ritzy isn't the word! Ladies get a mini cushioned stool to rest your handbag on. The waiter even asks if Â he may give you the menu. We decided to go with the 5 course menu and were WOWed by each course. For every course you have, the waiter changes your silverware and china. They must have refreshed our diningware at least 7 times!Everything seemed to decadent and delicious. Yes, the portions are small. but when you have that many courses you are filled up by the fifth. For dessert, they give you separate napkins and a box full of confections. For his birthday, they brought over a special dessert along with complimentary glasses of moscato for us to celebrate.All I can say is to try it for yourself if you are celebrating a momentous occasion. My boyfriend and I were thoroughly impressed with the level of service, care and food. We raved to our family and friends for days. We will be back!",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

287,HW_TAytaYgXRDyKyczCPhg,Par B.,2.0 star rating,"I had high expectations of this place having read several reviews. I had tickets to the opera so i booked my dinner at 5.30pm (right on the door when dinner service starts). The service was excellent with highly attentive waiters who was very friendly. The bread was great and the butter, olive oil and i believe whipped yoghurt concoction was unbelievable good. A series of amuse bouche got us started and we enjoyed them all.My wife had the sashimi style fish as an appetizer while i had the octopus. Both where good but not amazingly so, a solid three star for both in my book.We shared a pasta course and i got to say this was flat out unpleasant to eat. We ordered the CASERECCI all'Amatriciana and the pasta was so undercooked that it was so crunchy. There was a slight off taste on the nose of the pasta, like some lesser quality fats had been used to fatten it with. It went back largely untouched. We didn't complain because we didn't want to run out of time and miss the opera due took the kitchen refiring a dish. I took note that none of the waiters even noticed that we didn't touched the pasta. Okay, i can't hold back. It was the most disappointing and inedible dish i have had in a long time. Olive garden can do better (and i haven't been to an olive garden in over than a decade). I'd give this a negative star rating if i could.Main courses we ordered was the halibut, and i inquired about the chicken but my server guided me to the ribeye as being the best choice.First the good. The ribeye was accompanied with an excellent slightly acidic vegetable mixture that would have worked well with any ribeye. The bad is that this ribeye, cooked medium rare, was so tough and chewy that nothing could have saved this dish. I cook far better ribeye at home. In fact, i don't even blame the kitchen, this is just a case of really bad meat being served. A big piece of sinew went through one third of the steak, and it was so tough that my steak knife couldn't cut through it. And the rest was just not good. Yes, i could taste the rosemary/sage infused butter but it was not enough to cure a bad piece of meat. The big fat cap that was 1/8th of the cut was just ugly, white and gristly. The stuff where bad food dreams are born. The meat was hard and chewy.But wait there's is something even worse... My wife ordered halibut and for the first time her (and mine) we got the experience of Â lukewarm, slightly below room temperature fish. Even though i think the fish was cooked properly there is just nothing enjoyable about eating lukewarm fish. Â  In fact i think this is just about the most unpleasant experience one can have in the world of food, a slightly jiggling piece of cooked and then slowly cooled piece of fish served at the typical temperature of red wines. Or maybe the sous vide machine broke? It was cooked properly just not served properly as if had been left standing on the counter in an air conditioned kitchen for fifteen minutes before being served. I cant hold back, it was unappetizing bordering on disgusting.Most of the ribeye and all of the fish went back untouched. Again no questions from the waiters (most restaurants that prides themselves based on food would have been asking lots of questions by now, but we didn't get a single question). Perhaps it was the knowledge that we had a tight two hour window for dinner that made them assume that we where rushing and sent back most of our food untouched? Nonetheless, any classy establishment should have asked. Case in point, the night before i had Italian at a favorite place near Central park and fifth avenue, i ordered asparagus as a side based on the waiters recommendations. When he came back to check on us he noticed we barely touched the asparagus and i informed him that they where slightly too woody for my taste (they where of sizeable girth), he took them away and told me that they where of the menu for the night as he agreed that quality was not to the standard they expect. I digress.. The wine was excellent and i appreciated the advise on selection. We got a nice candy box to go which i appreciated (i haven't tasted it yet).But to be honest. I'm highly unlikely to come back. This is just not very good cooking and nothing should come out of the kitchen with so many technical errors in so many dishes. Maybe the outsourcing and empire building of this trio of celebrity chefs has made their flagship a hollow shell of its former glory? I will not know as this was my first visit not do i wish to spend another $500 on food i do not wish to consume after its put in front of me.comparing this experience to jean george which i visited the next evening, and who is just as leveraged in the celebrity chef building restaurant empires, Jean George was absolutely fantastic. In fact I'm going back to Jean George next time I'm in new York add it was truly impeccable and worth a special trip. Dell posto?

This review is for LUNCH.I came here a few weeks ago during an out-of-towner's stop over and they wanted a great lunch so we decided on Del Posto. I was shooting for the stars, my guest had no idea. Once we walked in, it felt like there was a gate you had to pass to be identified as a guest, but once we did, we were treated like kings. The deal with lunch is, it's a $39 3-course meal. This price sounds a bit much for lunch, but it is an insane deal for the quality. I went with a foragers salad, homemade pasta dish (Spinach penne) and sorbet desert (Olive oil). The meal was truly memorable, but the beauty of this place isn't the ""one"" dish you go back and get time after time, but the seasonality and changing flavors. Maybe equal to the meal treat is the fresh, crispy, and soft bread, from a baguette to roll. These are truly amazing and the herbed lard and butter spread were great. I'm thinking of this as a singular course in itself. When I think of AYCE's, I think of Del Posto's bread - this could money maker! Lastly, during the desert there's always a little sweet sampler from truffles to caramel candies. These come in a handy wooden cheese grater. Not sure if all the sweets come from the mind of Brooks Headley, but they were great. He just won the James Beard award for Pastry Chef in 2013 (Best of the Best)I've left a ton out, but it's because you have to go there to experience it. In terms of ambiance during the day, this place seems a bit deaden, so you feel like it's YOUR restaurant. Attire wasn't enforced and my guest and I had collared shirts and jeans.

And so finally I got the chance to for my Birthday this Saturday. We ordered the Captain's Menu and wine pairing, we thought it would be too much food, but it was not. It wasn't anything special, perhaps that was because most of the plates did not arrive hot (if they were supposed to be).At some point, a new trainee was bringing the dishes, and she seemed poorly prepared in introducing them; either not knowing what they were or what was in them or having forgotten. It seemed like we were the only table subjected to this. Most people believe that wait service in upscale places is pretentious. I've rarely found this to be the case, as they usually have such training and experience to treat everyone the same and understand all requests and allergies without judgement. This is certainly not so at Del Posto, in fact they scarcely seemed to be interested in our comfort or well being. At the end of the meal I began having an allergic reaction to the dessert. Not one where I needed to be sent to the ER, but one that left me swollen and with an itchy breakout. It took 15 minutes to get the waiter's attention so I could ask if he was sure there was no coffee/espresso mixed into the chocolate mousse of the dessert. The answer ""Not as far as I know"" was unexpected and inappropriate. At the beginning of the meal when I tell you my allergies I expect you to be certain, and check again. The fact that I was having an allergic reaction seemed to go unnoticed. I was simply offered something else. The Food: Besides nothing being serviced hot, the food was ok. The lamb was by far the best. It was cooked perfectly and a great cut of meat with no gaminess. The black truffle bauletti...you could not much taste the truffle, the pasta was a bit tough, and the cheese inside was grainy as if it was overheated. The crab agnolotti was done simply and was fresh. The caucciucco had a delicious broth but there was not much in the dish, nor was there much seafood. It was sparse. Out of all the food, nothing said to me that I should return and give the service a second chance.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

It is mind blowing on how attentive and thoughtful they are. I just want to praise how remarkable they made me feel. First of all, they gave me a mini stool to place my purse. When I asked where the wash room was, a server walked me over and waited until I was finished to walk me back. Also, while I was gone, one of our dishes came out so they put silver tops on and removed it as soon as I sat down. How amazing is that? In addition, your napkins are folded as soon as you get up and any speck of crumbs are never on the table for more than 1 minute. Each dish comes out at the same time and everything is synchronized; even pouring sauce onto our plate or pouring wine in our glasses. Just for 2 people, we had more than 3 servers being highly in tuned with us. Talk about fancy service...this place puts your city's ""best restaurant"" to shame.To be honest, I'm not a big fan of over paying for Italian food since I adore hole in the wall restaurants for them. However, this place did an excellent job of glorifying Italian food by keeping it traditional but adding some modern twists to it. We ordered the 5 course tasting menu but could not finish everything despite how small of appearance they were. Our dishes mainly consisted of lobster, crab, and veal...and my oh my, everything was just perfect.

I would sit for hours and listen to him talk about the map of Italy more than he'd actually cook, but I didn't care because, well, he wore Crocs. They always command attention. Upon arriving at Del Posto, I noticed how open it was. My goodness, this is what it's like not to live in a shoebox! The ceilings were gigantic, the tables spacious, and the restrooms were environmentally sustainable! Before I could wipe the tears from my eyes, the host instructed my party to go down to the wine cellar, away from the glitz and glamor and into a room where I would be yelled at by a woman all night, telling me things I don't care about, much like every day life, like that there is gluten in pasta and pork in bolognese.But the ""special"" treatment of my party didn't stop there. Most of the guests were given a ""veggie"" Chef Boy R Dee substitute instead of the advertised bolognese and when we left, we were all ""randomly selected for additional screening"" before we could enter back into the public. I don't know if it was because most of the guests were indian, but I have a theory...Del Posto gets 4 stars because Molto Mario owns it, and he was always a childhood hero of mine.

I've always heard that Del Posto was a classic italian meal and I would have gotten around to try it eventually but it's definitely not my first choice of $$$$ restaurants to attend. First off, we had a 9:30 reservation and had to wait at the bar for almost 45 minutes to get a table. We had to ask twice about when our table were ready and both times the employees did not seem to be any rush to give us an answer. They offered us a complimentary glass of champagne for the wait but the night already started off poorly. Because of how late it was already, my friend and I opted to do the 5 course tasting menu. My octopus was quite nice and I did enjoy that. My friend had a sushi sampling course which he did enjoy as well. For the two antipastis, we chose the half moon raviolis and the 100 layer lasagna. I don't know if my stomach was just weak that night, but the second they put the place of ravioli on the table, I felt extremely nauseous. I had my friend take my portion and put it on his plate and made him eat it as quickly as possible. I felt really bad because I had actually picked this dish plus there was a supplement for it on top of the pre-fixe menu price. The lasagna was pretty bland actually and not memorable. Our entrees were much better. My lobster was extremely succulent and his salmon was delicious as well.I have to say the most enjoyable part of the night was the dessert. The semifreddo was very rich and decadent. Plus they served us an additional sampling of desserts. We finished every single thing on the plates. Plus they sent us home with some small pistachios. For the cost of the meal, I was expecting a lot more.

305,vPyIX5As6g4H9EnBDQCHeQ,Steph C.,5.0 star rating,"In 2009, I read a Serious Eats post detailing the many unbelievable delights of Del Posto's $29 prix fixe lunch. Â I vowed to go, and I had my chance the Friday before last, with a last minute reservation. Â Michael K. and I met at noon and left at three, rolling out the door.Look, I spent $41 on this meal with a 30% gratuity, and I know that isn't cheap as chips, but it was a steal. Â We even got two flutes of prosecco when I checked in on Foursquare. Â With the stellar service and the endless parade of food, it's hard for me to imagine Del Posto turns much of a profit at lunch.I actually came for dinner once back in 2007, and I don't remember being quite as impressed. Â My lunch, though, was perfect. Â The dining room was gorgeous, like the lobby of a nice hotel, and our waiter Tom was awesome. Â He was engaging and incredibly helpful, and he and the rest of the large staff tended to us as to royalty. Â My purse got its own stool.The meal kicked off with a delightful amuse bouche trio. Â There was a tiny cup of paparot, a capon broth thickened with polenta and garnished with spinach and cornbread crumbs; then a jota panino, a spread of braised pork shoulder and sauerkraut on toasted white Pullman's bread with a strand of prosciutto; last, a risi bisi suppli, a ball of Vialone rice with cod, mascarpone, peas, and mint, fried, rolled in rice, fried again, and served with parmigiano reggiano. Â Each bite was splendid, but the rice balls won with their fun texture and sumptuous flavor.The bread basket came next, bringing filoncino, thyme olive oil focaccia, and black olive ciabatta, with sweet cream unsalted butter and house cured whipped lardo with rosemary and garlic. Â I loved it all, but the filoncino was the standout. Â It was some of the crackliest, most wonderful crusty white bread I've ever eaten.Only then did we get something we paid for - two antipasti, beautiful as they were delicious. Â First, we dug into the warm nuts, roots, and fruits, an artful dish arranged with robiola fonduta, puntarelle salad, and quince cider. Â Tiny slivers and slices of potato, beet, carrot, fennel, celery, apple, pistachio, pine nuts, white beans, decorated the plate and yielded maximal doses of flavor, and they did well taken with the creamy cheese and soft quince. Â Next, we had warm cotechino with a lentil vinaigrette and dried fruit mostarda. Â The sausage was ultimately delicious, with a pleasing smack of pork flavor and resilient texture, well complemented by the earthy toothsome lentils, the tangy mustard seeds, and the bright fruit.We had the option to order either pastas or entrees for our main course, and we decided, wisely, on two pastas. Â Garganelli verdi al ragÃº bolognese arrived a luscious dark green, stained with the color and vegetal flavor of spinach. Â The pasta was perfectly cooked, and the bolognese warm and hearty. Â Even better, though, was a handmade orecchiette with lamb neck ragu, rye crumbs, toasted sage, and carrots cooked in their own juice, then half pureed with a little tangerine to retain a soft, chunky texture. Â This was one of the best pastas I've had anywhere, the supple little ears of pasta bouncing at every chew. Â The lamb ragu bleated with dark meaty flavor, and the cool sweet topping of citrus-tinged carrot added temperature and flavor contrasts that made each bite captivating. Â The crispy bread crumbs added the last bit of sparkle to this outrageous dish.Dessert was a splendid affair, starting with an intermezzo of sour apricot sorbetto and fresh cashew gelato, topped with sea salt, olive oil, and sour apricot. Â This was so light and lovely, I wanted a second right after the first. Â My pining stopped, though, with the arrival of our chocolate ricotta tortino with toasted pistachios and extra virgin olive oil gelato. Â Chocolate doesn't get better than this. Â The ricotta lightened the dark rich robe of smooth chocolate, and the studding of pistachios cued the trumpets. Â Where did those impossibly pistachio pistachios come from? Â The olive oil gelato was likewise a feat, light but luxurious on the tongue. Â The butterscotch semifreddo with melon agrumata and crumbled sbrisolona was almost as good. Â The cool semifreddo melted in a pleasant wispy way, and the segments of fruit and concentrated caramel worked well together.We weren't done - don't you know that $29 buys a treasure chest of mignardises? Â Our server presented us with what looked like a box grater holding a chocolate olive oil lollipop and a warm bomboloni filled with lush pastry cream. Â Then he opened the drawer underneath. Â I gasped with delight as it revealed more treats - grapefruit jelly dehydrated with Campari, sprinkled with crumbs of a Southern Italian cookie, and a dark chocolate cocoa ganache. Â All superb.As we left, we were handed a small box containing two fudgey caramel truffles dusted in dark chocolate. Â We laughed.

307,pz3Ulbuk7ZiUUbT7oFzmpA,Lori L.,4.0 star rating,"When I realized that I had off from work on Good Friday, my mind immediately wandered to Del Posto. Both the fact that Eater listed their mid-day meal as one of the best values in NYC and prior positive experiences at Batali-Bastianich establishments was enough incentive to make a reservation for two for lunch.Del Posto is located just west of Chelsea Market, bordering the west side of Manhattan. The decor is impressive, capable of making guests pause the moment they step inside. An expansive, winding staircase links the lobby to the second floor, almost hiding a regal Steinway & Sons grand piano. The dining area is nothing short of luxurious; the high ceilings, the contrast of dark wood against lightly tinted shades of cream, and the elegant curtains draping the windows attest to the fact that this is no ordinary restaurant. We were shown to our table, which had two place settings thoughtfully laid out next to each other. An ottoman was brought for my purse, our waters were filled, and we began perusing the menu.The lunch prix-fixe at Del Posto includes 3 courses, but gives diners the option to choose either a pasta or a secondi as their ""main course"". The dessert menu is littered with Italian words, so we had to ask our server multiple times to clarify the dishes. She was able to do so with grace and after we made our selections, returned to present us with our amuse bouche. We had a myriad of tastes: a cauliflower soup, a tiny square that resembled a chicken salad sandwich, a bite of cod in between two crisp cracker-like halves. We were simultaneously given our bread basket, and I have to give special note to the quality of the carbohydrates Â - fresh from the oven, with plenty of herbs and olives, this was a delight to eat with the two spreads (butter and lardo) that came on the side.We started off with our first course, of which I had ordered the Truffled Cotechino. The plate consisted of a speckled cotechino - a warm, circular charcuterie - that was served with a generous sprinkling of lentils and prosecco zabaglione, a bright yellow sauce that I was initially hesitant to try. With each bite of this dish, I grew to like it more; the cotechino was savory, not too thick, and accented with a hint of truffle oil. The lentils added chew and texture to each forkful, and the slight sweetness from the zabaglione offset some of the richness of the dish. His Vitello Tonnato (veal tongue), on the other hand, was the clear winner. I've only had this dish one previous time and had found it disappointing. Del Posto's rendition, however, made me want to steal the plate. The veal was delicately sliced, the accompanying sauce was delightfully creamy and had just a hint of tuna flavor, while the crunch of capers added just enough chew.We had both opted for a Secondi as our second course, and the Heritage Pork Trio was presented in front of me. Two pieces of pork loin were wrapped in pancetta; the trio was complete with a braised pork rib on top. The server plated the final part of the dish, the ribollita, in front of our eyes; it resembled a Tuscan stew, chock full of winter vegetables and white beans. As pork is my protein of choice, I was delighted with this dish. The different cuts of meat, which covered the spectrum from lean, to fatty, to crispy, were perfectly cooked and infused with flavor. Although at first glance, it appeared to be a rather small portion, each bite Â seemed to trick my taste buds into fullness.And finally, dessert. I had decided on the Spezzata di Castagne on the recommendation of our server. In hindsight, it reminded me of a deconstructed cupcake; the warm dough, the wine-sweetened red plums, the sprinkling of chestnuts, and the scoops of yogurt gelato paired well with each other. His Tartufo, however, once again was the winner. A surprisingly sturdy chocolate shell encased a scoop of cherry ice cream, while the additional garnishes of toasted almonds and olive oil crostones added even more crunch to each bite. It was a solid ending to a delicious meal, especially when we were presented with our mignardises, which were humorously served both on and in a cheese grater.While the food was just a little shy of extraordinary, I was extremely impressed with the service here. Despite our age and the fact that we had arrived for lunch, we were treated like long-time diners during our visit. This, coupled with a strong menu and a lovely dining ambiance, makes it clear why Del Posto has earned one Michelin star.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Their menu rotates based on the season, so I'm not going to go into too much detail on the food.I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the pork tenderloin - it was cooked perfectly and the au jus was slurp worthy. Their handmade orecchiette was springy and chewy in the best possible way. I never enjoyed orecchiette as much as I did at Del Posto. Dessert was also top notch and their olive oil and coconut gelato are to die for. I wish I had a whole pint of their olive oil gelato!

I wish I could eat the Luna pasta everyday... it's so delicious! We had the 5 course tasting menu and I ordered the lamb for the main course. I actually didn't like the lamb so I ordered the Luna pasta as a substitution even though I had it for the 2nd course as well. They made us feel extra special and even gave us a tour of the kitchen, which is super impressive. Every detail here was amazing. We can't wait to go back! The only comment I have is they took our check as soon as we signed it, I think that's really rude.

I also expected outrageously high prices, which for what I order, received and considering the fact that I'm in New York City, I am happy to say was an expectation not met in that the prices, all things considered, seemed fair enough to me. Unfortunately, I've been to other places in New York paying a lot more for a lot less.When dining by myself as I did here, party of one, I've generally come to expect certain problems such as the worst set in the house coupled with less than attentive service, but not here. Matter of fact, I dare say that maybe, being an anomaly in comparison what seems to be their larger groups, it seemed that I was almost given preferential treatment.As for food there was no doubt as to their superior quality and superior innovative preparations. The Dungeness crab pasta with sliced jalapeno and scallion couldn't have been better as was their octopus with celery hearts what struck me as being a vecchio though the menu reads aceto and my waiter advised Modena. But whatever, the same proved not only to be tender but most delicious.Besides the service and food, I was also pleased by the ability to make my reservations directly through Yelp on my android! Though I have no way of knowing, I confess that I'm questioning the fact of whether or not my Yelp reservation played a part in me, as a party of one, getting such a favorable seat as well as such superlative attention. If so, it's clearly another Yelp advantage.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

What I wanted was some really good food with really good service. I felt that, paying about 323 per person including tax and tip (we got the wine pairing and the Captain's menu), we deserved both of those things. In a vaccum, the food was really good. I'll outline the food below:Pastas: The pastas that came out were incredible, and the wine pairings were absolutely perfect for each one. There were a few bites in here that you expect from a really top of their game restaurant, the ones that make sound stop and your head spin they're so good. But only a few, and unfortunately the pastas ended just as my enjoyment was starting.The Entrees/Desserts: I wish I could say they were great, but they were mostly forgettable. Definitely good, solid food. But when you are paying so much, you really hope that it will be great and not good.The wine: Wonderful. Great pairings, a wide variety of tastes.The Service: This was really where my 3 star rating comes from. I felt the service was quite bad. Maybe it was the group of people I had serving only my table, but it really felt like we got the minor leaguers that night. Our Captain tried very hard, but he detracted from my meal with less than stellar timing throughout. My friend and I were wearing dress pants without jackets, and we are both in our 20's, and there was a definite air of eye rolling, ""let's treat this table worse than the others"" type of thing. Maybe it was just a bad service night, but when you shell out 300 bucks, you expect GREAT service, and Del Posto didn't measure up.Maybe I was the exception to the rule, but I certainly would not send any family member back to Del Posto anytime soon.

Each dish can not be amazing or have multiple flavors going on at the same time becuase if it did progression would not be in our vocabulary.

Others had Lobster, Halibut and Pork Trio. They also made special dark chocolate desert for our anniversary. The wine list is an extensive collection of some of the finest Italian wines I've seen. The sommelier was very helpful and patient. Â They are very very proud, even the wines by the glass. Â He carefully decanted my selection, with a candle even though it wasn't $500. $1182 with drinks and wine before tip.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

You could never imagine what you're about to experience, but this place is amazing. I mean ridiculously unbelievably good! There are only two dining options - prix fix where you pick your dishes or prix fix where the chef picks your dishes. Definitely go with the chefs selection. You will not be disappointed.We had 7 dishes - two pastas, one meat, two seafood, salad and dessert (counts as two in my book as we had two different desserts). Everything was amazing. Even the salad and I hate eating salad! Everything was extremely flavorful and unique - sauce that you would have never thought of, seafood prepared like never before and veal wrapped with beef. Say what?! This place is worth every penny. Yes, it's pricey, but yes, it is one of the places that are worth the splurge.

""It's good, but expensive"". I was hoping my trip would prove that the common review would be an undersell... I was dead wrong. My brother and I arrived and the place was stunning - towering ceilings, monotone ambient light, beautiful architecture, and live piano music; everything you would want from a high end restaurant in NYC. The staff, from coat check to the last waiter to remove the crumbs from our tablecloth, was amazing. Welcoming, friendly, and accommodating whenever possible. So far so good, right? My brother and I decided to do the Captain's Tasting Menu (an 8-course menu featuring some of the stars off the menu and seasonal dishes the chef decided to prepare for us that evening) plus a couple of extra items we wanted to try sprinkled in, putting us at 10 courses that we were extremely excited about. I have never been more underwhelmed by a tasting menu of this stature. The one exception/highlight was the fish fin crudo. After this initial course, every plate was more disappointing than the last. The 100-layer lasagna, for example, tasted maybe a single notch above a frozen Stouffer's lasagna dinner. The rest of the dishes similarly lacked depth and overall flavor, leaving everything muted and forgettable. Again, the ambiance and service were impeccable, but I would never return. I've experienced plenty of fine dinners in NYC and around the world, and this meal, not even for a second, did not justify the cost. Pretty disappointing given the pedigree and clout.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Â It was our 1 year wedding anniversary and I expected to have one of the best culinary experiences of my life. Â Instead, we left feeling completely taken advantage of. Â Frankly, I think I didn't write about it because I wanted to pretend it never happened. My experience took place back on August 17, 2012. My husband and I had a 10pm reservation. Â I had read so many reviews on this place. Â Mostly positive and a few negative. I just had to eat here. I thought to myself, Mario Batali and Lidia Bastianich couldn't put together a bad restaurant. We were staying at Trump Soho which has a delicious sushi restaurant named Koi which would hold us over until our late reservation (also in the Bryant Park Hotel, both of which get a solid 4 stars from me). I could tell you all the delicious items we ordered a year and a half ago from Koi, but absolutely NOTHING from Del Posto stands out in my mind! Â We did the Chef's Tasting Menu and also ordered the 100 layer lasagna in addition. What I do remember is that the 100 layer lasagna they are famous for was mediocre at best. I had swordfish for the first time, which I now know I do not like. Â I was praying throughout the meal, ""just please end the night with something made of chocolate"". Luckily they did, so I had that going for me. The candy box was a really nice touch and I thought everything in it was yummy. First impression, this place is large and grandiose with white glove service. The service was exemplary as I expect a restaurant of this caliber should be. Â However, the food even though beautifully presented, was nothing special. Â It was not worth the amount of money we had spent. Â Nothing memorable, nothing I could even say was ""good"".

If grades were being given the service would be A+, the atmosphere an A and the food an A-.The service is extraordinarily excellent.

A-.The appetizers at our dinner for four were universally excellent. Even before that the complimentary miniature Italian version of Matzo-ball soup was outstanding. The same can be said for the variety of breads and rolls served with two house made spreads.Next came two pastas. The cannelloni was very good. The angolotti not so much. The pasta was heavy and under cooked and served partially luke warm, cold in the center.The main course Veal Saltimbocca was unconventionally a loin veal chop. The meat was dry and not flavorful. The texture of the meat made me think it had been previously frozen. The lamb on the other hand was heaven: medium rare, tender, flavorful, juicy and delicious. The accompanying side dishes were all very good.Desserts were good too, but seemed over-thought and somewhat fussy.Gift wrapped complimentary dark chocolate bars for the ladies at the table was a nice final touch.Its a wonderful almost theatrical experience.

So I took off work, slept in, relaxed, and went for my birthday dinner at Del Posto. This plan was infinitely better than my typical ""wake up early and go to work via the 7-train"" Monday.For a monumental milestone birthday, Del Posto was a solid choice. It was formal, swanky, and grandiose with marble everything.. a Roman empire dining palazzo. However, the service was polite, professional, and more laid back than their suit jackets would insinuate. The team and timing were flawless though.Hubby and I went with the 5-course prix-fixe; they offer a chef's tasting menu as well. I really like the concept of sharing 2 pastas, because I like being able to taste as much as possible. My first course of lobster oreganata was very fresh, with a light citrus flavor. However, I've tasted juicier lobster before at a lower price point (my 29th birthday at Marea comes to mind, Le Philosophe, and Mary's Fish Camp).On to the pastas. We shared the famous 100-layer lasagna (required) and the Luna Piena with black truffle butter. Luna Piena is typically a stuffed pasta, but it was more layered here. This dish skirted the line of being too much of a good thing; the richness of the abudant butter and umami-laden truffles was over the top. The 100-layer lasagna, however, was fantastic, with an upscale elegant sweet red sauce, blistered pasta crust, and excellent proportions.For my main course, I went with the lamb chops, which were juicy, but a little tough to eat. I much preferred my husband's cacciucco, which was very similar to a French bouillabaisse. All of the seafood in it was perfectly cooked, and the flavors were complex and what you'd expect from a 5-star restaurant.Desserts of course were abudant, and they even gave us some cookies to take home. The standout dessert was the chocolate cake with vanilla gelato and high quality olive oil. The olive oil was some of the best I've ever had, and really made that dessert. So I was very satisfied with our meal at Del Posto, but I would almost prefer the homey townhouse quality of Babbo, which is much cheaper, and in my opinion, just as good.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
346,KYrA99zoFNYS39bFY-t60w,Lucy C.,5.0 star rating,"My favorite Italian Restaurant in NYC by far. The decor, the service, the food--spectacular. The place is really elegant, with polished wood everything and dim lighting. There is coat check, a staircase up to the host stand, and a nice bar, which you can sit at while you're waiting for your party to become complete. There, they offer you free bar snacks of light potato chips and light trail mix. The bartenders are all very knowledgeable about the dining menu as well, which I took advantage of to learn more about the restaurant's specialty dishes.My friend and I were seated at a table to the side but were seated on the same side of the table, which I am not accustomed to. I wish we could have sat across from each other. The service was mind-blowing. Our water glasses looked as if we never took a single sip all night. Our cocktail (I recommend the pomegranate fizz, which is surprisingly strong and packs a punch) glasses were removed the second it was finished and touched the table. Everything was done so quickly, so quietly, so diligently that you would never notice they were even there. And our server described every detail of our dishes (almost painstakingly so) which made understanding the dishes much easier and gave us a higher appreciation of all the intricacies in the dishes.We both got the Captain's Menu, which was 8 courses for $165/person. Wine pairings are an additional $155/person but they were kind enough to give us complementary wine. They asked us a few questions and semi-tailored the dishes just for us, with each course being a complete surprise as to what was next. It was very exciting and needless to say the food was fantastic. So flavorful, so light, yet filling at the same time (don't be fooled by the small portions). Each dish had what seemed like hundreds of components that really made you think. And the desserts were out of this world. The green pea cake and free-form blueberry tart were baked to perfection. The best part was the next course was timed perfectly such that we never had to wait more than 30 seconds for the next dish. There really is no appropriate words to describe how Del Posto exceeded my expectations. Great experience.If my wallet permits, I will definitely be back!

348,iL7j3RQPwBuGWr0huBlfaw,Steve K.,4.0 star rating,"The Mrs. and I met some great friends who moved to Brooklyn about three years ago and we hadn't seen in at least five years. This was a big splurge for everyone-- we did the 5 course tasting menu with matching wines for $250 apiece-- and it was the only make ahead/before the trip restaurant reservation I made.On the plus-side: it is a beautiful restaurant right next to Chelsea Market. The service was fantastic, attentive without being (IMO) too fussy. (Though there were times of inattentiveness-- see the down-side). The food was of course excellent. There were two or three amuse bouche tastes (my favorite was a cheesy/puff pastry bite that had ""puffed rice""/aka Rice Crispies on it as a coating), and then everyone had a first course app. I think the Mrs. chose better than I did with a calamari/zucchini misto dish because what I had was essentially a very small but tasty portion of sashimi samples. The pasta was fantastic, and this also speaks to the service, too. The deal is you order two different pastas for the table. One of my dear old friends is pescatarian, and while we thought we ordered one that was vegetarian (and we had assumed they would have brought us both to the table at the same time), we seemed to have screwed up and ordered two that had meat. But not to worry-- they substituted vegetarian pasta for my fish-loving friend without a blink.My main was a lovely lovely fish stew concoction perhaps a little on the salty-side but still deeply flavorful and delicious. I wish I had had more bread to soak it up, but I ate much of my bread slathered in this odd whipped almost to butter cream stuff, something I've certainly never seen before. Surprisingly (at least for me, especially in an Italian restaurant), I think the best course we had last night was dessert-- I had a butterscotch sorbetto (sort of a fancy gelato), the Mrs. had an intensely chocolaty torte, and there were little treats for the table, too. The wine pairings with everything were great, and I wish I had a ""cheat sheet"" to remember what they all were. I wish I had remembered then asking because I bet we could have gotten a list. Oh well.On the down-side: it's crazy expensive. That dinner cost more than our Manhattan hotel is costing us for this trip (though we got a tremendous off-season deal on that), more than our plane tickets. So, was it ""worth it?"" The only way to answer that question is to ask ""what are you into?"" I can't imagine spending more than about $50 or $75 to go see some kind of sporting event in person, but there are lots of people who treat themselves to the fancy seats at those kinds of things. People go to amusement parks like Cedar Point and think nothing of spending $100+ per person to get in for the pleasure of standing in line to get on rides that always make me nauseous. Lots of people spend $250+ each to go see some kind of show I have no interest in. So if you look at the experience on the level of ""an experience"" beyond a meal and if you're into that sort of thing, than sure, absolutely it was worth it. Â Also, it was a long LONG evening. I'm okay with leisurely service in a place like this-- the experience is supposed to feel relaxing, not rushed-- but this was a little much. We arrived on time for our 8:15 reservation and had to wait for probably about 20 minutes before we got a table (albeit a nice table), and I don't think we got to any of the ""real food"" until at least 9:30. And we were there well past midnight. All of our middle-aged asses were dragging by the time the check came.And that's another thing: they actually screwed up the bill in some weird way. They fixed it (and thanks to my clear-eyed wife for noticing this in the first place), but it just seems to me that a place charging that much shouldn't get that wrong.So yeah, I'm really glad we went.

Del Posto was decorated beautifully for Christmas, the food was amazing and the service was stellar as well.We did the 8-course Captain's Menu and it was really good value and a great experience. Our waiter was super friendly and after my sister made some ridiculous comment about not wanting to eat 'anything with suckers' came back with some choice octopus jokes :) Also like that you can name dislikes for the tasting menu as many places don't allow for restrictions/substitions like that. Amuse Bouche: Lentil soup with olive oil, chickpea fritters with parmesan and black pepper, and marinated daikon. Fritters were amazing and the daikon had a texture similar to palm hearts. Bread: SO MUCH BREAD. You get a baguette, a thyme parmesan focaccia, olive focaccia and whole wheat + organic sweet cream butter and pork lardon. Which tastes like bacon butter. This is a good thing.Root Vegetable Salad - root vegetables and frisee on a creamy Piedmontese cheese. Simple but perfectly prepared.Crudo - Outstanding. The texture and tastes of the fish were so well matched with their preparations. Arctic char with caviar and creme fraiche, ahi with olive oil and tamari, mackerel with lime and olive oil, a white fish with basil flowers and orange, and another one I cannot remember. Could not pick a favorite and even my sister who is iffy on raw fish was converted. Whole Wheat Orechiette with Spiced Lamb Ragu, Carrots and Crispy Breadcrumbs: Completely addictive. And I'm not even a pasta person. The orechiette was perfectly al dente and the whole wheat gave it a very nice toothsome texture. Ragu was very savoury but the subtle notes of cinnamon and the sweetness of the carrots made every bite balanced but complex. Really liked this one.Squash and Chestnut Tortellini with Truffle Butter and Pancetta: Might have been just chestnut or just squash? Quite liked the truffle butter and the dish but my one quip is that overall I'm not a huge fan of sweet fillings in pasta so would have preferred a more savoury filling. More of a personal taste issue than anything wrong with the dish.""Cioppino"" - poached lobster, mussels, calamari and fish with a really good tomato broth. The broth tasted seafood-y and was just rich enough with droplets of olive oil.Aged rib eye with parmesan zeppoli and roasted cherry tomatoes - The beef was cooked PERFECTLY and had great flavor from the aging. Seared black on the outside and perfectly medium rare inside. Very generously portioned and went nicely with the parmesan zeppoli and the sweet roasted tomatoes. Cheese course - creamy Piedmont cheese with grilled bread and eucalyptus. Only course I thought was a bit on the small side. By this point was stuffed so this was fine. Cheese was similar to a triple creme brie but a bit more pungent.Dessert - They were all amazing. A vegan coconut ice cream with shaved toasted coconut and orange donut/cake + an apple fritter with vanilla ice cream and reduced cider that was tangy and went so well with the sweet vanilla cream. Lastly an eggplant crostata with straciatella ice cream. Sounds odd but the slight smokiness of eggplant was actually really nice with the stratiacella. Mignardises - orange caramel (I tried to unwrap this for 10 minutes before being informed you can eat the wrapper...so ya. eat the wrapper), grapefruit campari pate de fruit, chocolate truffle, chocolate covered olive oil gelato on a stick, lemon tart....ahhh was sooo stuffed at this point but just had to finish everything.

VITELLO TONNATO: Olive Crostone, Caper Shoots, Lime Cells & Lemon Basil (It's sometimes hard to decipher Del Posto's menu without doing a Google search. Note: this dish is VEAL. They drizzle an overpowering amount of the mayonnaise-based dressing on top, making it too creamy.)2. Handmade ORECCHIETTE: Lamb Neck RagÃ¹, Orange Carrots & Toasted Rye Crumbs (This is my favorite dish of the meal. The pasta is perfectly al dente.)3. Butterscotch SEMIFREDDO: Melon Agrumata and Crumbled Sbrisolona (This butterscotch ice cream comes with a really rich and sweet butterscotch on the side. I didn't take note of any melon, but there are sweet pieces of nectarine to TONE DOWN the sugary accompaniments.)He got:1. Insalata PRIMAVERA della Terra: Crumbled Salva Cremasco & Herbs of Summer (It sounds very basic, but turns out to be an exciting assortment of greens.)2. Apician Spiced DUCK Breast: Braised Endive, Hazelnuts & Sour Cherries (Very good medium rare, the duck meat is positioned with the endives in the shape of a duck on the plate.)3. TARTUFO al Caffe: Dark Chocolate, Sant'Eustachio Coffee & Candied Bread (Very strong coffee bean flavor; recommended.)We shared, for $10 extra/pp, a plate of:1. Traditional Del Posto GARGANELLI Verdi al RagÃ¹ Bolognese (It's one of their most praised pasta dishes, but to me, it is a rough-textured spinach pasta that doesn't go down as well as others. This dish is on the drier, not-so-creamy side.)I really liked their warm bread basket, and soft butter (the lardo wasn't as flavorful as I had imagined). The cheese grater full of mignardises at the end of the meal included tasty sugar-dusted bombolonis, chocolate covered olive oil gelato lollipops, dehydrated grapefruit soaked in Campari, and terrific dark chocolate truffles. Though they seem to be well-staffed, service is much slower than at other high-end dining restaurants. But that gave us more time to digest because we weren't rushing.

362,YDz_PpE3RSQPwKK6R9ucyw,Kristin F.,5.0 star rating,"A good Traverse City girl must eat at Mario Batali's Del Posto. Why? This is why: fodors.com/news/story_57â¦Northern Michigan adores Mario Batali for his overall advocacy for our hometown, as he raves about Traverse City and is often seen dining at the local spots. I am sure it puffs the ego of the local chefs, no doubt. Nevertheless, I didn't know anything specific about Del Posto until this recent New York trip- and wow, am I glad I do now. My date was an absolute gem and made arrangements without me even mentioning I wanted to go. So, we went for my birthday with an 11:00PM reservation last week. My birthday struck at midnight, probably somewhere between the first and second course. I had the 5 course dinner, with a complimentary ""small bites"" appetizer arrangement and similar arrangement of chocolates for dessert. Everything was absolutely outstanding. With French service and Italian menu, Del Posto is the type of restaurant that reminds me of how proper and old glamour dining used to be. Some of the touches in addition to the food was a stool for my purse, 3 different people showing me to the restroom (each handing me off to the next until I got there), wrapping up extra desserts for us and leaving them at coat check. I can't forget the charming conversation with our servers, the sommelier, and of course chatting with the staff who came straight from Italy. This is a true treasure- I am sure I will be back on my next NYC trip.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
363,2p0MhWnrouV1p9OyFycAgw,Dane P.,5.0 star rating,"In a world of so many food choices, our daily spots and goto places will all satisfy hunger and taste good all the same.What did Del Posto do differently for me than the other fine dining experiences and tasting menus I've done? Poignantly illustrated how flavors can easily separate you from the rest.Ambiance: 5Food: 5+Service: 4.5As someone who is quite particular about lighting in my own home, Del Posto's overall sense of lighting was very familiar and welcoming. Dark rich espresso woods with creamy ivory throughout tends to ooze a relaxing glow when bathed in candlelight - instantly making me at ease. The soft piano in the background was also a touch I add at home, however live music always trumps Pandora or Spotify for me (I'm a musician). Our second level table had an amazing view and definitely allowed us to take it all in.For the food I really have one word that frames it all up: diction. If food could speak, this was by far the clearest and most concise conversation I've had in a while. All the flavors were sharp & had very striking balance. Appetizers were both seafood: fin fish crudo & lobster ""cesare."" Both were amazing. The sardines and dressing were a nice counter point to the rich sweet lobster. The crudo treated each fish intelligently and resulted in a mini omakase type app - definitely a masterful display of Italian sensibility in regards to raw fish. The pastas we shared were the luna piena and the lasagne. This was my first time having white truffles and when you match silky pasta sheets with a smooth cheese and cover it in white truffle butter: you don't get a better first go around IMHO. Sure we could have shelled out for extra shaved truffles to bring it over the top, but being a first timer I figured we were good without. It was seriously amazing and was definitely taken by the contrast in flavor to black truffle - my unrefined palate picked up grassier and almost green vegetable-esque layers of flavor. This dish was the best bite of the night. The lasagne was unique as it was prepared alla plancha, but the flavors were amazingly homey. Searing off one side gave this lasagne the crusty/verging on burnt edges you get from the sides of a big pan made at home - a tasty nostalgic nod for me. Our entrees were the lamb and beef - both very solid preparations with a no frills approach to protein. The Parmesan zeppole were quite a treat, as I love anything in the style of donut - haha! Finally dessert was the butterscotch semifreddo and melanzane. Both were portioned well and hit the spot as an end to the meal. Of course the mignardises were a nice demonstration of the pastry chef's style. Serving them on & in a Parmesan cheese grater was definitely fun. I also wanted to mention that the stemware was very pretty - no two glasses were the same between wines and each paired nicely.Lastly the, while service was amazing I did deduct a 1/2 point for being within earshot of a waiter berating his support staff for something - definitely a little tacky. That said the service we received was amazing. The sommelier was cordial and explanatory, our server was polite and prompt, and the ""secondary"" server impressed me with her depth of knowledge. She called out the material used in the handle of the steak knife: whether that was her own pursuit of knowledge or management's expectation, it impressed me none the less. Sadly, I don't remember what it was due to the gin + wine, but that's no big deal :-)All in all I was very impressed with the restaurant on whole. All details were obviously considered and everything was elevated to meet the standard of discerning guests, foodies, chefs, and restaurateurs alike!

The pastas were ok but the agnolotti had been sitting out to dry a bit too long when they got to our table.

You can also do a 5 course meal, but I forget how much that was. It really depends on time--we unfortunately had back to back plans following lunch.

The ""Traditional Del Posto GARGANELLI Verdi"" was satisfyingly good and the roasted chicken alla Rossini was very tasty. But (insert sound of screeching brakes), that's where I have to draw the line on what was good.Asked for a very traditional drink, a Stinger. Sorry, after checking amongst themselves as if I'd asked for where the back room poker game was, they told me they didn't stock any CrÃ¨me de menthe. I didn't even want to remind our seemingly nonplus (but probably more likely new) bartender and tell him that it would also have to be white CrÃ¨me de menthe. C'mon, it's strong enough for Henry Hill in Goodfellas. I thought this place was supposed to be Italian (they should check the sources for the best CrÃ¨me de menthe mint-- it's very Italian or at the very least, an island or two off their coast).Then I asked for a glass of their best Chianti, again, but this time without a smile or hesitation, ""Sorry, we don't have Chianti."" This is Italian? Huh.Warning: You've gotta suck it up and ask how much their ""a la carte"" items are, don't get corned into buying their exorbitant tasting menus just because you don't want to look ignorant. It's your money, chose how to spend it. Unless you just have to blow it, ask.When everything has to explained on the menu (and when you get it, ask again because you don't recognize it), it's not such a good sign. I've travelled to all of the major continents and have been in some pretty swanky joints, and I rarely see much menu obfuscation anymore. Mr. Del Posto, it's ok to speak plainly... good food will always trump menu hype. You'll also end up becoming a bit more efficient, and turn a few more tables on busy nights, because you won't be wasting people's time with retelling the evenings fare with incoherent mumbo jumbo.When the next major correction comes on Wall Street, maybe they will change their tune and adjust for us mere mortals.PS- Skip whatever salads they offer as they seem to be only a bunch of twigs and other terra firma.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

I didn't know it going in but the food definitely spoke for itself.We had the Gattinara which is functioning wine cellar and nice for a party of about 16... also why my pictures are a little dark.We started with the waiters bringing around some Assaggi (""Little Tastes""). Â All phenomenal. Â Sorry, no cinctures for this section... got too carried away eating :)TUNA SASHIMI WRAPPED IN DAIKON RADISHExpertly cut thin sheets of radish wrap a thumb size portion of raw tuna drizzled with olive oil and seasoned with salt to give a nice crunch to the soft tuna and crisp radish.LOBSTER and CAVIAR FINGER SANDWICHProbably my favorite. Â Creamy lobster and caviar on crustless triangles but it was the green herb (Perilla I believe) but it was quite tasty. Â A very refreshing almost lemony zesty feel.FRIED MOZZARELLA BITES with TOMATO POWDERThese were the hit of the night. Â Crunchy with hot melting cheese on the inside dusted with light red powder. Â Most people came back for multiple servings.We also had SCALLOPS wrapped in PROSCIUTTO, SAUSAGE with GREEK YOGURT DRESSING and a FRIED CHICKPEA HASH. Â All good but the above where the standouts.

397,ghzPmvAEm21QwCTs5R6Mtw,Ryna D.,5.0 star rating,"When Mario Batali, Joe Bastianich, and Chef Mark Ladner opened Del Posto in 2006 they did so with grand aspirations. But it took a few years of growth before the restaurant earned the coveted 4 star assignation from the New York Times. Today Del Posto is a fine establishment that has matured comfortably under the hand of Chef Ladner. Dinner here at Del Posto comes adorned in full regalia just as what you would expect in a high end restaurant. Certainly the dining room leaves something to be desired as the muted color scheme and draped long windows fail to give the room a pleasantly airy quality to it despite the high ceilings and well-spaced tables. And so the setting when paired with beautiful silver and table ware lends to a formal, somewhat unapproachable atmosphere. Thankfully the staff and accompanying service is on the warmer end of the scale. And the comforts to be enjoyed here is quite remarkable. Aside from the impeccable service, live piano music streams in from the lounge and foot stools are even provided for ladies to place their hand bags upon.As for the food, it is superb. For those who are not keen to spend a fortune on a meal I recommend visiting Del Posto for lunch as I did recently this summer. Priced at $39, the 3-course lunch prix fixe is possibly the best deal in town. The meal starts with a trio of amuse bouche and a warm bread basket. For the first course the lobster fra diabolo is excellent. Chef Ladner makes great use of different textures in his dishes and the garlic bread panna cotta makes for a great accompaniment to the lobster. For the vitello tonnato, a traditional summer dish of braised veal covered in a sauce made with olive oil and flavored with tuna, crisp caper berries accent the dish resulting in a most elegant antipasto. For the main course guests can choose a pasta dish from the primi selection or a secondo. The seasonal fish paired with sunchokes and wilted romaine is so tender and moist that it will literally melt in your mouth. The Sardinian lamb, another classic preparation, is delightful. For dessert, pastry chef Brooks Headley's creations are quite memorable. The chocolate ricotta tortino, covered with a beautiful ganache and toasted pistachios and paired with a lovely olive oil gelato is as delectable as it looks. Headley's take on the classic tartufo and semifreddo are both excellent and the limone cremoso is a wonderful choice for those looking for something more on the fruity taste. To end the meal petit fours gets delivered to the table in an adorable presentation. Wine pairings are available as well as an excellent selection of wines by the glass.For more on fine dining check out my posts on Examiner!",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
398,L0t5dMSW15xgNoSpVRBL0Q,Alex S.,5.0 star rating,"Del Posto offers delicious Italian fare that dabbles in gastronomy (moreso than other Batali & Bastianich restaurants) but the menu still retains the mark of a more traditional Italian restaurant. The hearty tasting menu will not leave you disappointed (or hungry). I was sad to read that Chef Mark Ladner will be leaving to focus on his fast casual concept, Pasta Flyer, but I have high hopes for his replacement, Melissa Rodriguez, and her new menu.Lasagna inspired this blog, and the ""100 Layer Lasagna"" Ladner popularized at Del Posto is a great place to start for my first posted review. That dish, as well as the ""Orecchiette with Lamb Neck Ragu and Orange Carrots"" were my two favorite pastas, but the entire menu was excellent.Arguably the most impressive aspect of Del Posto, though, is the service and welcoming atmosphere. Many high-end restaurants give off a pretentious air, whereas Del Posto manages to make you feel appreciated whether you've dined at Michelin-quality restaurants your entire life or if it's your first time. Furthermore, at a recent dinner celebrating my father's birthday, no less than six or seven different members of the staff wished him a happy birthday (including the host almost as soon as we walked in the door). The restaurant was also able to accommodate us by seating us at one of the banquettes I requested, and topped off the meal with a complimentary dessert complete with candle and ""Happy Birthday"" chocolate garnish. The cordial members of the Del Posto team made us feel as though we had been dining there for years.Del Posto won't be in the discussion as a pioneer of molecular gastronomy, but the comfortable balance struck between familiar Italian recipes and calculated modern twists is delightful, and, when combined with the almost unparalleled service, led to a phenomenal dining experience and one I would highly recommend to others, especially for celebrations. Perhaps it is a bit grandiose for everyday dining needs, but when the occasion calls for it, look no further than Del Posto.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

I had the truffled beef tartare antipasti, veal agnolotti, spinach garganelli bolognese, and the spiced duck breast. The tartare was good (well-balanced acidity & spice), but my wife's pumpkin salad was better. The bolognese was seasoned perfectly and did not overpower the subtle pasta flavor. The highlight of the meal, however, was the duck breast. It was so tender and full of juicy flavor that I couldn't believe it was duck. The sour cherries and the duck fat jus paired amazingly well with the duck and left me wanting more. To finish off the meal I had the tartufo dessert, which was the perfect mix of a chocolate shell and creamy goodness in the center.

400,HTL_ssHCnyFJYmE_qbr7Rw,Cynthia M.,4.0 star rating,"Delicious meal but you will definitely be paying for it! As soon as we entered, it was white glove service from beginning to end. Our reservation was on a Saturday night right at the start of dinner service so we were able to score a great corner booth and be super comfortable for the meal. We had received a gift card a while back so we were finally able to use it!The wine list was on an tablet, and though I am a techie, I really would have preferred a regular wine list menu. The tablet version really didn't go with the feel of the restaurant and it was very faulty and they actually needed to reboot ours. I did feel like service was a bit pushy and it felt like the staff was hovering over us though. I am used to fancy restaurants, but this bordered on being pretentious and stuffy in not a good way. We decided to just do the prix fixe 5 course menu and started with the carne crudo and the lobster cesar salad. The carne crudo was delicious if you like steak tartare, but was a bit of a surprise when it came to the table since we did not realize we had ordered raw meat. The lobster salad was delicious though and we both enjoyed it greatly. There was a good amount of lobster perfectly cooked and it was dressed nicely with lots of parmesan. For the pasta course, we got the spinach garganelli and the 100 layer lasagne. Both were wonderful. Small portions but filling and super flavorful. The garganelli was cooked perfectly and came with a nice ragu. The 100 layer lasagne had a nice crispness to it and so much flavor. The next course we got the poached lobster and the lamb. The lamb was cooked perfectly and wonderfully tender, but the star was my lobster dish. The lobster was poached in a butter sauce that almost had a nice hint of sweetness that resembled vanilla. It was tender and a nice sized portion and the polenta alongside complimented it beautifully (and I am not even a fan of polenta). This was really one of the best preparations of lobster I have had and I may have to come back for this and the lasagne again in the future. For dessert, we had the panna cotta and the butterscotch semifreddo. Both were nice, but I wish the panna cotta was a thicker version so I could really appreciate the texture that I love in this dish. The coffee was perfection and I may need to find out what type of beans are used. They also gave us a nice selection of mini desserts and the chocolate covered olive oil gelato lollipop and the chocolate truffles were our favorite of the group.At the end of the meal, we did feel a bit rushed, but the restaurant was quite full so I am sure they were trying to get the next round of diners in. They gave me a box of pistachio cookies to take home which was in a beautiful box and was a nice surprised at the end of the meal. Prices are $$$$ and be prepared to spend a lot on a dinner here even if you don't plan on drinking much. More for a special occasion than just a casual dinner and if I were to come back for that lobster or lasagne dish, I would probably prefer to just sit at the beautiful bar and order it there if possible since I don't need the whole white glove dinner service again. The five course menu was more than enough food for us though and it is definitely worth a visit at least once! Highly recommended if you can afford it!",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

In that classic Del Posto style, dishes came and went all nicely and synchronized. Our main waiter, though was talkative about the dishes that it was almost comical. It's awesome that all these high-quality ingredients are going into the dishes, but maybe the staff needs to either come up with a way to make the description shorter or get a feel for the table and if they are seemingly indifferent to what you are saying (and/or would rather continue the conversation they were having) to cut it short.

415,urDEfAmiPqaJ9JuqGcc1xw,K V.,1.0 star rating,"Very poor service by the General Manager, Jeffrey Katz. I had lunch recently, and had a number of disappointments, so decided to email the General Manager, Jeff Katz (jkatz@delposto.com) on July 22. I also flagged my email via his LinkedIn page. I always like to give any negative feedback with positive feedback, and included a number of compliments. But he didn't bother to respond, so I'm posting the negative comments publicly instead.  First, just after I had been seated, I placed my order for my starter and main. I was then shocked to be told that I needed to also place my dessert order at that point too. For a start, this is simply bad etiquette and quite vulgar. And for good reason: if food is good, it should surprise. It should be a unexpected journey into the unknown for your taste-buds. So by definition, if the starter and the main courses are good, you shouldn't be able to predict what dessert you want to have. I have no idea what dessert I will or won't want to have before a single mouthful of food has passed my lips.Secondly, the bread is dreadful. It is mediocre bread - even Amy's does far better bread. And they don't understand bread - if you are attempting to serve interesting bread, then you are simply overpowering the bread by also providing complex spreads, instead of a simple good quality olive oil etc. Good bread requires enhancement, elevation: it doesn't deserve to be overpowered by overly complex spreads. They've completely missed the point of quality bread. Thirdly, their tea selection was diabolical. Honestly, you offer me Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Chamomile and the usual dull suspects? Honestly, why serve up a McDonalds tea experience? The only vaguely interesting tea that was on offer was a White Peony - hardly an exceptional choice to offer guests. Acceptable only in a McDonalds restaurant or some such. You really can judge a restaurant by its attention to the smallest details. Many other - lesser starred - restaurants (eg Jonathan Benno's Ristorante Lincoln) delivers a far superior, seamless experience - actually, a journey, is the more apt description.

I've been to a few of Mario's other restaurants but this one was superior on many levels. If you have time: try a cocktail at the bar prior to your seating. They have several unique listings on their menu and the lighting is dim and very elegant. There was a pianist playing in the dining room which added to our romantic experience. The sommelier helped us choose a bottle as the wine list was very extensive. He was spot on with his recommendation. You choose between the 5 or 8 course prix fix tasting menu. It was truffle season during our visit - not sure if they offer the addition of truffles to your courses year round. We had a late reservation and ended up being the last table in the restaurant.

Del Posto does not disappoint in any shape or form. First, the decor is absolutely breathtaking. It is dimly lit with candles and a candle-lined staircase, beautiful light fixtures and absolutely stunning flower arrangements. A piano player plays live music, consisting heavily of The Beatles, which alone may deserve 5 stars. Our service was great. It was very attentive and, surprisingly, extremely down-to-earth. He made us feel very welcomed and explained everything extremely well. The wines suggested to pair with our meals were fantastic and complimented the course perfectly.Our courses were as follows:Amuse bouche: I unfortunately don't remember the exact details of the amuse bouche, since I dined here back in November, but I do remember it was absolutely delicious.Bread basket: This is probably the best bread variety you can find anywhere. All breads are absolutely delicious and the Lardo-Rosemary spread is so, so, so sinful.VONGOLE Marinate with Fried Roman Artichokes & Minted Farro Dressing: This was absolutely delicious. The clams were tender and so fresh. The fried artichoke was perfect, as well as the farro. I would highly recommend this as a first course. Warm COTECHINO with Umbrian Lentil Vinaigrette & Dried Fruit Mostarda: Delicious sausage accompanied perfectly by sweet re-hydrated dried fruit and a very flavorful lentil vinaigrette.Del Posto AGNOLOTTI dal Plin with Lambrusco Glassato: This is a MUST for the pasta choices. It is so delicious. It is rich, earthy, filled with tender meat and a smooth, deep sauce influenced heavily by wine. Perfect.SPAGHETTI with Dungeness Crab, Sliced Jalapeno & Minced Scallion: This is very good and very light as a pasta dish. The crab is incredibly fresh and the jalapeno adds the perfect amount of spice.Seared DUCK Breast, Apician Spices, Savor alla Francescana & Lovage: The duck was perfectly cooked. This was an overall perfect entree, accompanied with pumpkin, root vegetable, and the most decant, still-sizzling piece of seared foie gras. [Drooling]PORK: This has changed on the current menu, but what we had was perfectly cooked pork with crispy pancetta and balsamic glazed raisins. This was so well balanced and full of flavor. The best part may well have been the fall-off-the-bone riblet on the side. SPEZZATA di Castagne, Warm Plum Macedonia, Crushed Chestnuts & Yogurt Gelato: Very good yet could have been better. The plums were delicious, the hand-torn chocolate flourless cake was very good but a bit dry.Butterscotch SEMIFREDDO, Preserved Melon Agrumata, Crumbled Sbrisolona & Milk Jam: Very good and highly recommended as a dessert course. Smooth, soft and perfectly creamy, a very nice citrus element and crunchy, added textures.We were also served a plate of dessert petit fours and bambolini. All very, very, very good.I would highly suggest dining here. Yes, it cost me half of my paycheck, but it was so worth it. I promise you.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Tourism.They push the prix fixe. There's a regular menu if your party is four or less. But they did not offer us the menu up front, and it did not materialize even after we asked for it twice. So we gave up did the pre fixe. Of the many dishes only half were superb. The others were merely good to just fine. Not world class. Not worth the price tag. On the wines. They are unique. No doubt about. It would take some knowledge and time to seek them out if it were not for the Del Posto wine list. But many are by no means rare, and exclusive. Worth 5x the retail cost? Well you be the judge.Great staff though I will say. And lots of them. Very lovely, and very dedicated. I will say they were largely world class.In a nutshell...

428,WQMuKfMHwxmkhO_avqF15w,Meredith M.,5.0 star rating,"Del Posto is certainly an experience and you have to go in knowing that you are paying for the service, the food, the pairings and the overly formal ""can I refill your water glass"" ""yes"" *proceeds to walk around the entire table because one can only walk clockwise and pour water from your right*. Â That being said, quite the experience it was.I was taken here by my boyfriend for birthday dinner on a Friday night. You are met with a coat check and iron gate-like doors before even entering the dining area. Â Once you speak with the doorman of your reservation (don't even think of going in without one or trying to make one the week of), you are ushered to a dimly lit (and absolutely romantic) dining room. Â All of the formal things are pretty standard: a seating server pulls out your chair, asks you regular or tap water and would you like to start with the wine list. Â However, ladies, don't be surprised when your purse that is sitting on the table or on the floor by your seat is swiftly put on a footstool of its own.I have a huge interest in selecting a wine for a celebration dinner and was actually pretty pleased (and overwhelmed) when I was handed and guided through their iPad wine list, organized by type, region, you name it. Â Yes, they have that many wine available for your choosing. Â I was perfectly confident I could select a great wine (I really doubt any of them are dislikable), but I realized I could also do that anywhere. Â This is one of those places where unless you are after a particular bottle of wine, you should go with the extra cost for a wine pairing with your dinner from one of the best sommeliers in the city.We realized that once we decided the wine pairing was for us, we had to just go all out for the 8 course Captain's Tasting Menu + wine pairing. Â I am so happy we did. Â The food really was impeccable and each course&pairing was different than the one before. Â The Captain's Menu was comprised of a variety of poached fishes, pastas, veal/chicken and cheeses. Â I keep raving about the wine pairing because it was so so perfect. After each pour, you are told why this particular wine was chosen for this meal, as well as a short description of the part of Italy it originates from. Â To me THIS made the dinner memorable and so unique. Â Dessert was lovely as well, small pastries and delicious cakes. Â This was the only time you are given something different than your companion and are encouraged to share.If you know there are multiple courses involved, you have to realize that presenting that many wines and courses will take time. Â Our entire experience lasted a whole 3 and a half hours. Â Probably the most important decision you will make is who will accompany you to Del Posto - the length of dinner and quietness of the dining room is not for the faint of heart and things could go south real quickly if your companion doesn't know how to be adventurous with eating whatever is placed in front of them or how to laugh (politely and stealthily of course) at the pretentious couple sitting to your right. Â Will I ever go again? Probably not.

Any way what I was encouraged to get was the fish crudo which was good, not great in my opinion, my husband had the octopus which was amazing! I had a bite.For the bis (shared pasta )we had the gnocchi, although I loved the texture of the gnocchi its self, the sauce or as written on the menu "" piennolo tomato salsa and Thai basil"" was lacking something my husband said salt I said more Thai basil. Then we had the spaghetti with Dungeness crab and jalapeÃ±o and minced scallion, the flavor was Devine! Perfectly balanced heat with the crab I loved the flavor. The pasta is not made fresh and had bite not how I love my pasta but still very good. For the last I was encouraged to get the burnt beef with charred green onions and tomato raisins was my absolute favorite course. Was very large for me though my husband needed to help me and we still didn't finish it I would have passed on the gnocchi to have eaten more of this steak. My husband had the slow baked chicken he ate the whole thing! I didn't even get a bite which was very rude of him, though if it tasted as good as my steak I can't be mad. Dessert my only option was a vegan coconut semifreiddo with toasted salted coconut shards on top my second favorite thing of the night, it was creamy, salty, crunchy and amazing. We did the wine pairings with the meal witch was a great, I recommend it 100% Â overall a great night. Even with great service, good food and wine.

Get. It. This is fine dining in NYC, so of course the prices are high! But is it any higher than any other fine dining establishment? No. And tell me this: does your cheaper $20 overloaded red-sauced fried ravioli plate come from an establishment where all your dinner companions' special dietary needs are not only accommodated without sighs and eye rolls, but is considered a fun opportunity to flex their creativity to create special, custom dishes off the menu? Is your server not only from Italy, but can provide you the culinary history of each dish, so you not only get educated about the Italian regions but get an amazing history lesson in Italian food and wine? I swear he was a walking Wikipedia! Oh and it's all the other little things: upholstered stool to rest your purse, courses served in a synchronized fashion by a team in perfect unison, napkins folded while you visit the restroom...I could keep going.

Our whole table was completely covered in dessert, and that was just the first round. Yes, there was a second all-cookie round. Don't be alarmed when they start crushing cookies all over your table top. It's quite a presentation!I should stop.

Thanks to Masa being downgraded a few years ago to three stars, our recent visit to Del Posto marked the last one in the list. Your visit here isn't going to be cheap. The five-course menu will cost you $126. it consists of an antipasto, two pasta dishes (shared by the table), an entree (secondo), and dessert (dolce). Since we wanted the full experience, we went for the captain's menu of eight courses. My sister got the wine tasting for $155. Whenever you go to a restaurant like this, of course, you have to come with the right expectations. You're not just paying for food, you're paying for the experience, from the decor and ambiance to the service to the artistry that the chef puts into each dish. The service at Del Posto was phenomenal. Our server, I believe her name was Mary, was down-to-earth with a pleasant smile and demeanor who really made us feel welcome. I couldn't help but compare this to Daniel, where while the service was fine, I couldn't help but feel throughout the night there a sort of condescending attitude. In general, the service was phenomenal. I'd arrived a little late to my reservation, but as soon as I got in the door, I was welcomed and whisked to my table, where another member of the staff already had my chair pulled out to seat me. Whenever one of us got up to go to the rest room, someone would be there to not only pick up and fold our napkin, but replace it with a new one. When we spilled a little wine on the table, the staff used napkins to cover it up. Staff would instinctively move out of your way when you were walking in their way, even if they had their hands full. Different staff would serve us food, but each one would invariably provide an expert description of the dish, making sure to make eye contact and acknowledge everyone at the table. The dishes themselves were all presented beautifully, but never seemed to be too hoity-toity. Pasta dishes, not surprisingly, were the star and were cooked and seasoned to perfection. At the end of the evening the three of us at the table got three different random desserts, but it just so happened that each of us got exactly the one we would have chosen. To this day I'm still not sure how they did it, but I'm thinking it's really just a reflection of how good the service was overall.I've read that one of the goals of Del Posto was to serve Italian food with the same level of fine service and detail usually reserved for French food. After my experience there, I can honestly say they surpassed my expectations.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

It's worth visiting for that experience alone, but be prepared to dish out lots of $$. 5 stars if you're into that kinda thing.4 story windows with thick curtains that make me feel tiny, closed because it's what's inside that matters, and a floor so wide it could easily be made of 30 Brooklyn bars.

White table cloth, champagne fabric luxury that high school prom banquet halls wish they could be.5 course or 8 course? Choices between things like ribollita and cacciucco feel overwhelming but the sound of the letters on my tongue make me feel hungry.

I ask for a wine that is red, dry, earthy and full and I get it.There are surprise treats all throughout-- shots of cauliflower soup, post-dessert dessert mechanisms with hidden bonus dessert nuggets in a drawer.

We arrived at Del Posto after a torrential 15 minute downpour with jointly wearing torn jean shorts and a baseball cap. I mistakenly thought we were at a more casual pasta/pizza restaurant . I immediately apologized for our appearance as it was immediately apparent the caliber of restaurant we in. They offered for us to sit at the bar. The menu has tasting menus or al a carte which was our choice.This is the best mistaken restaurant experience I have ever made. I work in a restaurant and aspire to give service as good as we received. I was slightly self conscious about my appearance ( I usually dress appropriately for the occasion) but soon got over that. We were treated like royalty by the entire staff but especially our Captain Josh. We had a leisurely 3 hour meal rather than the 1 hour meal we had anticipated at a different restaurant.It is always a good sign if a restaurant presents a varied and thoughtful bread selection. And visa versa a bad bread basket and I want to leave before ordering. There was a selection of at least 5 different breads with their whipped butter and whipped lardo (it took a lot of self control) but I refrained as much as I could to save room.Firstly they realized our phones were't charged and offered to charge them for us !!! I knew then that they weren't going to miss a beat in anticipating our needs and I was right. Everyone was extremely passionate and knowledgeable about the sourcing of ingredients and recipe inspirations without it seeming overbearing. We didn't want the experience to end.We love great food and hung on every word. Knowing the passion behind the dishes really takes the experience to a whole other level.We shared a chichory salad with a truffled vingrette. Â Our first dilemma was we wanted to try both the gnocchi and lobster ravioli. They offered to give us a 1/2 portion of each. Hallelujah ! I am suspicious of gnocchi in most places as they can be a slimy dough bomb. These melted in your mouth with the simplest yet pristine light tomato sauce with basil. Also the ravioli were the most delicate pasta dough with tender chunks of lobster with a creamy mascarpone cheese not a thick sheet of pasta with undefinable pureed ingredients. Â We also loved the butter poached lobster .We ordered 2 desserts that were phenomenal works of art PLUS incredibly tasty. We were presented with a third which was the pastry chef's Â rift on a McDonald's deep fried apple pie. Such a fun idea and it works.We were also gifted with a box of chocolates to take for our flight home. I will now always come here when I am in New York. Meanwhile I have my memories. Throughout our trip we were always planning on the next meal but we were in such an euphoric state that no future meal could ever matter at that time.As much as enjoyed this experience , having it will dull all other subsequent Â dining experiences.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

The service is a bit over the top, a lot of fanfare (they brought me an ottoman for my purse!!), but it comes with the territory of a high-end library-looking Italian restaurant so just enjoy the ride. Also, the live piano added the perfect ambiance. It is a high end restaurant, but no need to overdress-- we saw out-of-towners wearing jeans and sunglasses on their heads, just popping in for a high-class lunch.The three course lunch was only $39, with an additional $10 pp to add a pasta tasting. You can tell some of the kitchen staff are more talented than others, department-wise. I had the winter salad for my first course, and there were tons of different components (too many), including large chunks of parmesan (like grape size chunks) that I had mistaken for potatoes. Not a pleasant surprise from the garde manger. We had the pumpkin ravioli, hands down a warm and savory dish well enjoyed. By the time the main course came out, we were pretty full and had to take it slow. My salmon was bright, as described, but maybe over-soaked in olive oil which made it heavier/fattier than desired. Boyfriend's duck was delish with a clever sour cherry polenta sauce. But the main star of the show is the pastry chef at Del Posto. God bless this individual/team. When I saw parsley gelato and celery gelato (my two favorite flavors), I knew this person was an incredible human being. It was difficult to pick out of the many enticing and creative options (and we don't really like sweets). Also the ""palate cleanser"" between the main course and dessert was life altering. I never knew the true meaning of palate cleansing until I tried that taste of lemon and cashew gelato and completely forgot about the three courses before.

When you are paying $500+ per person, you should be getting the best service you ever had and this experience was the exact opposite. My friend and I arrived an hour early of our reservation and decided to have a drink at the bar. It took 20 min of being ignored in a uncrowded bar, while sitting directly at the bar, to finally get the bus boys attention who then agreed to pour us some wine. After that it went further down hill. We were harassed by the bartender who finally came over, after we were poured our wine, about being there early, rudely told to us sit at another place in the bar to order some bites (when others were clearly eating where we were sitting) and it took another 20 min there to get someone's attention to order the food. I re-approached our bartender to make a note of the long wait and ask if we could just order through him, he said no and shooed me away with his hand. It was a terrible mix of inattentiveness and just plain rudeness. My friend and I were shocked at how the bartender was talking to us. I'm not sure if it was that we were young females and thus appeared to not be able to afford this place, even though we were coming from business meetings and dressed appropriately, but no one should be treated poorly baed on their gender, age or race. I'm often told I am too quiet and nice, so it wasn't any bad behavior on our part, I can assure you. Once we sat for dinner, the waiter seemed nice, but I honestly was so upset, that I barely noticed the food or waiter. The whole meal and experience there was blackened with our poor initial treatment. We ordered the 8 course dinner with wine pairings and I can't even begin to write anything about the taste of the food. Note to the restaurants: your door, coat, host and bartender are the ones who set the mood for the entire night. They are the face of your restaurant and you should make sure they are treating your customers right. I will never go back and will advise everyone else to not go as well.

FYI, not for date night- there are no two-tops and the atmosphere is classic New York but to an extent that I'd only want to go back again with my grandparents. A work dinner (which is the situation I attended in) is an appropriate occasion, but I prefer less live piano and more...relevance with my ambience.For the food- hate to say it but I was not that impressed, and I tried many items on the menu. The problem was that a couple items were great but most were subpar. A quick rundown:Amuse bouche- Cod croquettes and warm vegetable soup shooter. In the summer? Not my ideal start, but sure.First course- RECOMMEND: the cold lobster salad. Fresh, citrusy/crispy/tender in each bite.Charred octopus: Good, but not much better than anywhere else I've had it.Secondi- RECOMMEND: the orecchiette. Star of the night hands down. I was pretty impartial ordering this dish as it's a relatively standard offering these days, but this dish at Del Posto was mouthwateringly good, thanks mainly in my opinion to the crispy morels and firm orecchiette pockets that burst with flavor when you bit down. Get this.La Piena: disappointing. Was recommended by the waiter and has rave reviews online but what ended up on my plate were 2 saggy flaps of ravioli-esque pasta in a forgettable sauce with the slightest hint of truffle. Lasagna: this dish was a joke. C'mon Del Posto, you can do better. Lasagna should be al dente and a little crispy on the edges, Â this was flaccid, wimpy, flattened lasagna with tomato sauce reminiscent of Prego. Nope.Entree- RECOMMEND: Burnt beef- wow. Dry-aged, unapologetically-salted, crusted medium-rare goodness of epic proportions. Big fan. Lobster: eh, the norm in taste/portion/accompaniments.Slow cooked salmon: coworker complained this was just soggy and lacking flavor. From the looks of it I could only agree with her reaction.Dessert- We tried 4 main desserts and only one worth mentioning was the pecorino cake. Nice olive-oil flavor, not too sweet.Throughout the meal we were well-attended to by the waitstaff and the wine selections were spot on. Fresh bread and small homemade sweets at the end were a nice touch but wouldn't sway my overall opinions about this place.

I could go on and on about the service. But the food, the food! Olive oil was magnificent. Whatever they served with the bread basket was truly liquid gold. I've never had a strong affinity for any particular olive oil but this was pure delight to the senses. Unfortunately the charred octopus was tough and chewy. Was pretty disappointed esp since it's not that difficult to do it right. They must have forgotten the wine cork in the braising liquid before grilling (wink wink). Aside from the octopus, I tasted some pretty amazing dishes: duck, jalapeÃ±o pasta w/ crab, and truffled ravioli. And the dessert sampler was over the top.

My favorite of the night.Beef and Truffle Carpaccio: very thinly sliced beef carpaccio with sprinkled truffle sauce. The airy carpaccio just melts in the mouth and wets your tastebud for the next course.Scungilli pasta -- I grew up having scungilli (conch) in China.

We showed up at 10pm. He informed us that the wait is likely to be 10.45pm. Three minutes into the conversation, he said ""but we can't guarantee that you have a seating at 10.45pm since there are still 4 additional seatings"". So my friend and I decided to wait and grabbed a drink in a nearby bar, called back around 10.30pm, at which time another hostess made a reservation for us. We came back to the restaurant at 10.40pm. Without even reaching the reception desk, he spotted us from afar and said ""I'm afraid that we could not accomodate you tonight"". When we told him that we called and succeeded on reserving 5 minutes ago, he was completely shocked, then fumbled around and brought up the seating chart. He walked around and returned in 3 minutes to bring us to the table.

What a beautiful space. I loved the warm lighting and the live piano player added to the romantic ambiance. It was exactly where I would have imagined dining on this snowy night.We were grabbing dinner before a work function so we ordered a few things a la carte off the menu. A few highlights that we didn't buy: the bread basket is AMAZING! They bring out 4 types of bread straight out of the toaster/oven/whatever they use to make the bread warm and soft with butter/lard. They brought out a few samplers before the meal: a tiny lobster slider, a shot of what tasted like pumpkin soup, and a crunchy piece of pasta in cheese. Those descriptions definitely don't do the sampler justice. Then right before the petite fours, we had this amazing palette cleanser. And the petite fours (8 pairs of chocolate/fruity) were a great way to finish the meal.Ok. Onto what we ordered:We split the Truffled Beef Carne Cruda With parmigiano-reggiano & watercress budsMy plus one ordered the Garganelli Verdi al ragu bolognese. I ordered the Orecchiette With lamb neck ragu, orange carrots & toasted rye.Honestly, with all the bread and extras (it had been awhile since I ate at a place like this so I forgot about that part), we probably could have done without the truffled beef antipasti.

And I'd gladly order from the five course menu again and again, an eternal recurrence of the same exceptional experience that marked my recent birthday.Instead of being welcomed to the pearly gates by St. Peter, I was instead (literally) asked Â by the legendary Lidia Bastianich how my meal was, who happened to be dining about 15 feet away from our table as she made the rounds.Was this a test? Failure to properly answer results in an eviction from paradise where I must forever make my own meals and never dine out again?I mustered up my courage and replied that everything was excellent and that I really enjoyed her shows. A gracious nod, thank you and smile and heaven on a plate resumed.So Del Posto is a Bastianich-Batali joint, a massive restaurant in the Meatpacking District that literally means 'instead of'. (Thanks google translate...which is apparently entirely off. ""The Place"" is more like it.)There's no a la carte ordering from the menu. You'll either order from the $115 five course or $145 seven. The man entrusted to explain our menu items was a passionate purveyor of culinary information, venturing into the origins of our food, preparation and other details that was music to my ears. Fine dining meet Wikipedia and I loved it.This is the kind of restaurant where your napkin is changed by a staff member equipped with napkin removing tongs. And if you need to get up and use the restroom, someone quickly swarms by to inch the table out so you don't have to.I started with Lidia's Lobster Salad. Light lobster flavors for the summer supplemented by tomato and celery, this was an appropriate start to an epic meal. My wife had a plate of prosciutto di parma as her antipasti which I gladly assisted in devouring.But my most enthusiastic discovery was the application of a lardo spread to bread. Butter, my Â friend, your days are marked as the topping of choice. Pure fat, pure decadence and pure tongue flavor explosion.Up next were the pasta plates. Each person chooses a plate which is presented to both people dining. I opted for the ricotta pansoti with Green and White Asparagus & Black Truffle Butter. Pansoti best resembles a ravioli and literally means 'little belly'. My belly became a bigger one after relishing the sheep's milk ricotta filling. This was a rich pasta dish but fortunately the portion wasn't overwhelming. Up next was my wife's pick of spaghetti with Dungeness Crab, Sliced Jalapeno & Minced Scallion. You could definitely experience the heat of jalapeno with this dish. I also enjoyed the minced scallion, adding a crispiness to experience that I hadn't experienced before while eating spaghetti. My main course was an order of baby lamb alla Romana, Garlic Yogurt with Ceci & Swiss Chard Ragu. A milk-fed lamb between six and eight weeks old I'm sure this would be a target of a PETA campaign. Ethics aside, this was some of the most tender lamb I've ever experienced, offering no resistance while chewing. The ceci (chickpeas) and chard ragu were the perfect complement to this particular meat. Having survived four courses and nearly full, I was relieved to see that my Butterscotch semifreddo, Sour Cherries, Preserved Melon Agrumata, Crumbled Sbrisolona & Milk Jam was not an overpowering mass. The dessert may be semi frozen but it was all good as I savored each spoonful. We were also given a box that included two small italian donuts, a caramel with edible rice wrapper, lollipops and a few other tiny sweet treats.Nearly three hours later, it was finished.For a special occasion dining experience, Del Posto exceeded my expectations.

The restaurant is able to accommodate plenty of larger parties in semi-private spaces with reasonable ambient volume for conversation.

I had to hold my tongue because I was with my girlfriend at the time, so am writing now to express my outrage at the terrible service and sub-par food. I asked your waitress to bring the two best appetizers and the best entree for me (my girl requested the full moon pasta dish as an entree). What did your waitress decide was one of your two best entrees? A salad - which was not much of a salad but a random assortment of unusual vegetables that could only be on the menu to satisfy vegetarian customers. That's one of your two best entrees? A salad??? Or was it chosen because the waitress assumed that because I was with a woman that she would be watching her weight and only want a salad? You've got to be kidding me. Then, for the entree, I was given the lamb. The tail was decent but the chops weren't just under-seasoned but unseasoned, and then when I requested the salt, I was given a salt grinder that didn't work properly.Finally, when we were leaving, someone brought over a box of cookies - but just for my girl. I am as chivalrous as anyone you will find, but I also would like cookies and I'm also the one paying the bill. And the bill - if this meal was half the price, I wouldn't be writing, but for what it cost, it was a very, very poor value. The only reason I went was because another friend of mine has raved about your place but I will be sure to add your restaurant to the places I advise people to avoid when in the city (congratulations, you're the first one!) I always stay in the neighborhood at the Standard and if I'm ever advising anyone in that area to get a good meal, I'll tell them to either hit the Standard Grill and save a fortune, or splurge on something worth their money over at Buddakan. ----PS - The prior email was sent to the restaurant and received no response.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

The beef was fresh, and the portion was sizable.For entrees, Â we got the orecchiette, black bass, Sardinian lamb and the garganelli for the table.

Â  For desserts, we tried tartufo al CaffÃ¨, limone cremoso, chocolate ricotta torino and got butterscotch semifreddo for free.

This place is a 3.5 star place... almost, almost a 4 star overall for the food, but for what you pay here, the food should absolutely blow your mind, which it only did maybe 25% of the 10 dishes we tried.The bread basket... it was bread alright. Good, but not as good as what they give you at Scarpetta. Funny though, at first I thought the lardo was too smokey and porky and the butter was perfect, but by the end of the meal, the lardo was perfect and the butter tasted bland. Guess the lardo takes a little getting used to.For apps we had the octopus and the lobster. The octopus was fantastic... tender with a perfect char... absolutely recommend this one. The lobster...eh. Served at room temperature, and basically was half a tail or so worth of meat in a tomato sauce. The sauce had a nice spice, and the panna cotta it came with was unique, but overall the dish was disappointing.The pastas... we had the Tortello Puzzone and the Orecchiette with lamb. The Tortello was simplistic and decedent. Tender pasta shell, creamy cheese inside, and truffle butter. Perfection. The orecchiette came with tender chunks of lamb, and carrots that had been cooked in orange/tangerine, so it added a unique sweetness to the dish. For whatever reason, the pasta itself reminded me of the stuff I used to eat out of a box when I was a kid... and not in a bad way, just what it reminded me of. The dish was good, but not anywhere in the same league as the tortello.For the mains, we did the lamb and the trio of pork. The lamb chops were cooked perfectly, and the lamb neck was fall apart tender. Overall good, but not mindblowingly so. The pork trio came with short rib cooked in polenta, a pork meatball, and a large chunk (I forget what cut) of pork. The short rib, all you could taste was the polenta, and was flavorless otherwise. The meatball was so tender, moist and fatty, it barely held together. It was the star of that dish. The large chunk of pork was probably 1/3 fat, and was a little disappointing. For dessert, we had the butterscotch semifreddo and the chocolate tortino. The tortino reminded me of a dessert you get at the supermarket, and the olive oil gelatto was kinda bland. The semifreddo, on the other hand, was creamy and butterscotchy and delicious. Overall, we spent over $400 for two us of, the five courses, and a bottle of wine (plus tax and tip). For that amount of money, I expect to be blown away, and while I was 2.5 times, 2.5 of 10 dishes doesn't cut it for $200+ per person. Do I recommend going?

477,2vhLzPKfR_QH8WfoDVtGvw,Vivian C.,4.0 star rating,"Many say that Del Posto's lunch deal ($39 for three courses) is an absolute steal. We sadly missed it when it was (only) $29 but Adam had gone a couple weeks back and said it was absolutely worth it, even at $39.When you walk in, the space is absolutely gorgeous. Three stories of tables (the basement is reserved for private dining) and the use of dark and rich colors leads to a romantic feeling in the space even during lunch. We were seated at a table on the ground floor that was close to one of the large windows looking out onto 10th Ave.We were presented with a wine list and due to the humidity, Adam ordered a light and crisp white wine - a 2011 Catalanesca. I checked-in through Foursquare and received a complimentary glass of prosecco. It was an incredibly generous pour of prosecco. The check-in deal is only good for lunch but I definitely thought it was a really nice perk!After our drinks came, we were presented with three beautiful amuses, compliments of the chef. We had Persian cucumber with a mousse, puffed corn stuffed with lobster salad and a salsa marinara (chilled tomato soup with a dried parsley and basil rim). All of the amuses were fresh and a great way to start the meal. The Persian cucumber was crunchy but the mousse inside was a bit bland. The puffed corn and lobster salad was very good. We enjoyed the textural differences of the crunchy corn and the sweet and luscious lobster. The salsa marinana reminded us of the summer and fresh, ripe tomatoes and worked well with the herb rim.Our server then presented us with the lunch menu which consisted of the three course prix fixe as well as their other larger and more expensive tasting menus. Adam had shared that the lunch special was more than enough food so we opted for that.After ordering, a wonderful basket of warm bread was presented to us. It consisted of baguettes, olive bread and foccacia. Each piece was straight out of the oven and had a great crispy crust while the inside remained soft. If the bread wasn't enough, it was presented with two room temperature spreads. One was butter and the other was lardo. Wow, this was one of the best lardo spreads we have ever had. It had a wonderful pork flavor to it without being overpowering and was not over or under salted leading to a perfect spread for the bread. I attempted to try and not eat all of my bread (just half of each type) but that lardo made it difficult not to eat the bread... even though it was just a vehicle to get lardo in my belly. :)We both decided to start with the Lobster Salad Oreganata, which came with chilled tomato & summer squash ragÃ¹ ($10 supplement). The lobster was beautifully cooked, so tender and sweet. I was impressed with the amount of lobster that came in the dish. The tomato and squash reminded us of summer and had a great freshness to them. The bread crumbs added some crunch to the dish as well as some salt. I found that the dish was slightly underseasoned but overall a wonderful beginning to our meal.I wanted to try the pasta but didn't want it as my main course. You can add on a pasta tasting ($10 supplement per person) for the table but each person cannot pick their own pasta. Adam was also interested in trying a pasta so we asked our server for a recommendation between the bolognese (one of their most popular pastas) and the orecchiette. Without hesitating, our server said the orecchiette.We were both presented with a small portion (though on par with the price) of the handmade orecchiette that came with lamb neck ragÃ¹, orange carrots & toasted rye crumbs. This was my favorite dish of the meal. The orecchiette was perfectly al dente and swathed in the ragÃ¹. I wanted to lick my plate clean of the ragÃ¹. The savory ragÃ¹ paired well with the sweet carrots while the toasted rye crumbs added some crunch. We wish they had an a la carte menu so that we could just come back and sit at the bar and eat their pasta.For the rest of the review and photos: adamandvivian.com",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

485,9njwaFS6FrNEeftauyiMAg,Trey T.,3.0 star rating,"Reposted from TripAdvisor""Very Good, But ...""Reviewed May 4, 2013We had reservations last week for 4 for Del Posto. We took an employee on an incentive trip to NYC and really wanted to reward his service with a top notch evening at Del Posto. There were 4 of us. The final tab was about $1800.The first thing you have to understand is what Del Posto is trying to accomplish, the context behind what you get so that you can understand just precisely how it doesn't work. DP is trying to bring the fastidious rituals of French Dining to Italian cuisine. A prix fixe menu with wine pairings, a battalion of servers, cutesy desserts, everything is a French veneer inlaid over an Italian culinary experience, and it doesn't quite jib. It is so subtle an annoyance, this shoehorning of one into the other, that you know deep down that it isn't working, but to give it voice is very difficult.That difficulty springs from the fact that there is nothing to complain about. The food is perfectly prepared and presented. We each had the prix fixe menu with wine and the only quibble we had was how the chef cut from one over-the-top creation to a very simple let-the-ingredients-speak-for-themselves. The strategy was too measured, too textbook in today's fine dining. But again the food was very, very good. The wine pairings were exceptional, the steward knew his business and was especially attentive to my non-vinophile companions. Excellent job.The space is gorgeous and huge. The wine cellar looked impressive and the sense of imported place was again well done, but just not quite right. In the restroom, for example, the soaps were from Bigelow, the oldest pharmacy in NY, etc. These little things were present throughout, and confirmed that yes every detail had been considered in every way, but almost too much like Disney world. It was unreal but not in a complimentary sense.Del Posto means ""of the place,"" and we are supposed to catch the double-entendre there ... that it is a place where we bring other places to bear and magic results. Except that it doesn't. Its like going to dinner with that friend who only wants to talk about all the other friends he has, none of whom you know except through his stories, and what they said and did. Del Posto delivers an experience that is wholly derivative of the authentic experiences of others. The result, while unimpeachable, is unfulfilling.Visited April 2013",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

They supposedly increased the deal by $10 as of the week before Easter, but it is still a steal!I initially had reservations for 2 on Good Friday, but was able to adjust the ressie to 3 people without a problem. First off, Del Posto is GORGEOUS. Spacious, old-school, wooden interiors, with ample spacing between tables. The waiters are top-notch and attended to our every need. They also honored the Foursquare check-in offer of Free Prosecco! We started off our meal with a trio of amuse bouche. We had a small soup (very akin to Chinese soup to me; a tad salty), a small bite of prosciutto sandwich (lightly toasted and truly made my mouth happy!), and a risotto ball. For my appetizer, I had the beef & truffle carpaccio (+$15 supplement). It came out with a bed of carpaccio below various colorful toppings; definitely eye-catching! The carpaccio was smoky, meaty, and delicious. One of my friends started with the biter herbs & lettuces salad which was out of this world! The truffle dressing was delicious.I had the Tortello Puzzone as my entree, per my friend's recommendation. What came out was 5 pieces of beautiful hand crafted pasta. The bouncy pasta contained soft taleggio cheese and was absolute perfection when coupled with mushrooms and black truffle butter. One of my friends ordered the Heritage Pork which was tremendous, but too dry for our liking. The other girl ordered the lamb and really enjoyed it.I can't comment on the desserts as I couldn't have any, but my friends RAVED over the Tortini (it was nicely presented as well) and the Tartufo. We finished out our meal with complementary petite fours - which I didn't try either (GAH!!!). As we left we were handed a small box of truffles which I DEVOURED a few days later at the end of Lent. Amaaaaaazing. The path to the bathrooms at Del Posto is beautiful too! The public restroom is located downstairs.

Â More on that in a second.Del Posto is a cavernous, ultra-swank restaurant that doesn't feel like it's in Manhattan at all! Â The way the place is set up, you can actually hear yourself think. Â The tables aren't stacked on top of one another so the noise level never gets louder than a soft din. Â You can hear the piano playing in the background and it's a very relaxing mood. Â Service was excellent. Â Our waiter and sommelier were eager to answer all our questions about everything regarding the food and wine and they seemed to really be into it themselves. Â Always helps to have a staff that enjoys what they're doing! We ordered the 5 course service, gluten free for me, of course. Â For the antipasto, I had a beef crudo/tartare that was so fresh and flavorful! Â I never eat raw meat, but this was an experience unto itself. Â Hubby had the grilled octopus that basically tasted like the best BBQ I had ever had. Â Next, we shared 2 pastas. Â The portions are only a couple bites worth, so it's not overkill. Â We first had the Luna Piena - a delicate ravioli-like pasta in a wonderful truffle butter sauce. Â This was the best bite of food I have ever had! Â Hubby agreed. Â Next, we had the orecchiette with lamb neck ragu. Â It was a complete 180 from the previous pasta and while not as memorable as the Luna Piena, it was a great interlude to our main courses. Â For my main, I had the lamb chops and hubby had the ""burned"" steak. Â I think he won the evening's battle for best dish with that one. Â My lamb was delicious, but the steak was cooked with this insane, herby crust on it that gave it the burnt appearance. Â It was accompanied by grilled spring onion and braised, exploded cherry tomatoes. Â Exquisite detail on this dish. Â Finally, dessert came. Â I ordered the panna cotta and hubby ordered the coffee tartufo. Â There was a mistake though, and they brought him the caramel sorbet instead...this turned out to actually be the better dessert! Â All in all, I gave this a 5-star review because of the atmosphere here and also for that amazing pasta dish. Â This is not a place you can go to all the time, but if you are celebrating something special or unique, I highly recommend it! Â So wonderful to feel like you've been whisked away to a culinary fantasy world far away from the hectic city.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

The desserts were a tad too sweet/heavy/much for me (we were celebrating our anniversary and they brought us an ADDITIONAL dessert. 3 desserts was a bit much after such a meal, though a very sweet and appreciated touch).

492,6fM5RKYzlVjA9nduyV8mjA,Nan H.,4.0 star rating,"3.375 stars. Â I couldn't give them4 stars because I can't help comparing them to Marea. The ambience- very open, airy, spacious. We sat on the second floor balcony which was nice. You get a view of the entrance and can check out all the people coming in. Â The decor was very old fashioned. Personally I like my decor a little more modern. The service- impeccable. There were a group of people that gather around your table to welcome you. They also had stools for our purses. one stool per purse! It was redonculous! The waiters and even the bus boys were very knowledgeable. They can recite ingredients and recommend items that were featured in the NY times etc. Â The waiters also were good at pacing the meal. Sounds strange but when u do a prefix with5+ courses, pacing is very important so you don't feel rushed but at the same time don't spend 4 hours eating a meal. Prix fix- this was a prix fix only place. We did the 5 course prix fix and skipped the wine pairings. The wine pairings were an additional $135 per person. The waiter kept asking us if we needed to speak to te sommelier but we were anxious to order my food at that point so we skipped this as well. You have the choice of picking your first course. Picking two pasta courses for the table, picking your meat course and dessert course. Â While you are doing this, they bring out an amuse bouche of tomato gazpacho and cheese rosotto balls and chickpea truffle balls. The little balls of truffle were devine! Earthy and umami. My first course was the steak tar tar. It came with shaved pieces of parmesano-reggiano and basil. the steak was mixed in a mustard sauce with a good amount of acid to keep it refreshing. Delicious. My second course was the dungeoness crab spaghetti. It was prepared super al dente with a creamy sauce and bread crumbs on top, slivers of jalapeÃ±o and chunks of delicious crab claw. I practically licked my plate clean. It was rich with a kick at the end from the jalapeÃ±os. My next course was the lobster risotto. The rice was cooked properly alDente in the middle and not gluey or mushy. It also had nice clean chunks of lobster on top. They finished it off with a wine sauce. I thought the dish was nice and light but lacked depth in flavor. It also tasted a little bitter towards the end. The next course was a no no for me hence the 3.375 star rating. I had the halibut which was poached or souveed. It was bland. Had no texture. The bread crumbs on top of the fish and the fried vegetables were salty which I guess were used to flavor the bland fish but I didn't like it. MehFor dessert I had the chocolate tortino with pistachios and olive oil ice cream. It was dark rich and delicious. The Perfect ending to a great meal.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

I went with friends (on a corporate account!) for a bust-your-wallet, go-all-out 8 course tasting menu extravaganza.I think it was probably clear we didn't exactly ""belong there,"" but I love the way the staff interacted with us. At this type of restaurant, the service is a huge component to the experience, and they were wonderful. As they got to know us (8 courses - we were there for 4 hours), they began to tailor their behavior to suit our personalities. They even knew amazing tidbits about the restaurant, like how Chef Batali hand picked the shape of every wine glass or stories about the man who rides the subway with a briefcase full of truffles. Â I really loved them all.In addition to our 8 courses, the chef sent out a very substantial amuse-bouche that was actually three bites instead of one. We also received an additional box of sweets following what should have been our last course. They were very lovely touches and I wouldn't want to miss them, but after 10 courses of food and 9 courses of cocktails/wine/beer, I was quite uncomfortably full. Just come prepared.The food itself was of course wonderful, but I have to say it wasn't the best meal I have ever had. Still, it was really something to see the work that came out of the kitchen and you shouldn't turn down the opportunity to go if you have it.

Â Having been to the resturant twice earlier I had very high expectations. Â Had several friends come in from out of town looking for a great meal, and they asked me to secure a reservation at a great place. Â The service was so incredibly poor, disjointed and slow that I almost spoke with a manager. Â We were not served our menus until a full 45 minutes after we sat down. Â Drinks were very very slow, as was water service. Â The waiter had to come back to the table several times to recheck our order, and despite this, people were served the wrong items. Â Maybe it was because we were a party of ten or maybe it was because we were on the upper level, but the general feeling was that we felt mostly ignoredThe confluence of this all was to make for a very very slow night, i suspect so that the restaurant could rack up an alcohol bill. Â I was embarrassed that I had reccomended this place to this group of friends, and each of them came up to me later stating that it was too overpriced and generally not a good experience. Â Nobody said they would be going back. This was very dissapointing to hear because we had previously had great experiences at the restaurant.

The sommelier was helpful in sorting through the large wine list. We decided to go for the del Posto tasting menu. My antipasti of warm cotechino (a type of sausage) was full of flavor. However, the carne cruda was probably the best antipasti. For an interesting and tasty antipasti, try the vongole (clam) on top of artichoke hearts.The pasta dishes of spaghetti with crab, scallions, and jalapeno, and agnolotti stuffed with capon were both superb. I enjoyed the spaghetti just a bit more but would not hesitate to order either dish again.My wood grilled lobster dinner was cooked to perfection and the other main courses we ordered were the grilled pork chop, seared duck breast, and lamb rack cooked medium. The duck breast was my favorite dish.The desserts were ok, I did not really have a favorite and the house brought us an extra one to share, along with some biscotti at the end of the meal.

We did not do the wine pairings they suggested, we just ordered reccomended wines. The waitress woman asked us things we liked, didnt like and said they would tailor the menu to our preferences.

Order placed it would be mere moments before the dining would begin - first a small troika of amuses bouche. Â Beginning with choux pastry stuffed with creamy mortadella, crispy ""suppli"" Roman rice balls with mozzarella and gold dust, and ""stracciatella"" - a roman eggdrop soup with celery salt around the rim each of the flavors was mild and distinct - a variety of textures, flavors, and ingredients opening the palate up to the possibilities ahead.I was next brought the oft raved bread basket - piping hot and featuring an airy baguette, buttery rosemary focaccia, and a crisp rustic Italian roll. Â With each bread excellent on its own, the accoutrements to the bread were a whole different story - one a creamy and sweet butter and the other a dollop of lardo - whipped pork fat with hefty notes of salt, nuts, and audacious umami.With the bread serving as an ample vehicle to pork-fat consumption my first course would arrive as - well, pork with fat. Â Titled Warm Cotechino with Umbrain Lentil Vinagrette & Dried Fruit Mostarda the dish itself was center-pieced by a thick pork sausage atop a bed of beautifully cooked lentils with hints of vinegar and mustard seed. Â Generous in portion and topped with candied cherry and apricot compote the flavor balance was excellent, though the texture of the sausage was a tad grainy for my palate.My second course of the meal would arrive approximately 10 minutes and a piece of focaccia after the Cotechino - unfortunately it would be a major disappointment. Â Titled Gnocchi con Pomodoro the dish featured small potato dumplings that were decent in texture, but poorly drained and somewhat watery. Â Topping the pasta with chunky tomato sauce lacking both salinity and seasoning - as gnocchi is my favorite pasta this dish was a major let down in taste, texture, and even visual appeal - as a matter of fact it was bad enough that I sent half of the small portion back to the kitchen untouched.Modest in portion but ample in flavor, Seared Duck Breast with Apician Spices, Savor alla Francescana & Lovage was the dish of the meal with the duck breast tender and the skin crisp. Â Alongside the breast, a dollop of thigh confit at one side and a quenelle of dried apricot and pumpkin with pumpkin seeds at the other - one sweet and one savory - and at the base of the dish a celery root puree that added an earthy base to the rich duck jus added tableside.With mains finished and coffee ordered - a rather acidic blend from Lavazza served in a French Press and refilled for free - my dessert would be the Chocolate Ricotta Tortino with Toasted Sicilian Pistachios & Extra Virgin Olive Oil Gelato. Â Heavy in dark chocolate notes and nicely balanced by the savory ricotta the dish was essentially a designer Italian Ho-Ho. Â Not overly sweet and paired with Batali's now-famous Olive Oil Gelato there was certainly nothing light about this dish and the glassy palate feel of the olive oil would have almost been ""too much"" were it not for the crunchy pistachios and cookie crumbles.my final tastes of Del Posto would arrive in the form of a cheese Mrater full of petit fours - bombolini with vanilla and orange zest crema, chocoloate covered lollipops filled with olive oil gelato, crunchy candied grapefruit, apple raisin polenta tort, and a cocoa dusted Amedei chocolate truffle - each well crafted and tasty, particularly the bombolini and tort.Settling the bill and collecting my bag I thanked my servers and made my way to the streets for an afternoon of wandering the Tribeca gallery scene - always one of my favorite activities in New York. Â Thinking back on the experience and the price I must admit I understand the appeal of Del Posto as a business lunch - for fine dining the place is a deal and the setting is lovely. Â With that noted, compared to other equally priced lunches in the city (both Italian and otherwise) Del Posto's food just did not ""wow"" in the way I had expected - everything was simply too safe, too quiet, too un-Italian, and decidedly too un-Batali...like an ""experience"" more than a restaurant, an experience created to earn Sifton or Michelin's stars...which it has.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

My cousins and I decided to treat our parents to a nice dinner for once and try a Michelin star restaurant to cross off our bucket lists. The service and food were impeccable. Our captain (Thomas) was funny and knowledgeable and accommodating to my aunt who is lactose intolerant. He even had the them bring out a dairy free dessert. The extra appetizer to start (feast of 7 fishes) and extra little candies and desserts were the nicest touch.

527,RafhMRi4b7pexeWlGEGAdg,Jeff M.,5.0 star rating,"It's been a few years since I've taken Italian, but I'm sure Del Posto translates into ""Comatose."" Be warned. If you do the tasting menu here, this will be the most filling tasting menu you will have ever eaten. Yes, even more filling than, say, Per Se or Eleven Madison Park.But my is it worth it. Del Posto is the brain-child of Joe Bastianich, Lidia Bastianich and Mario Batali and it's located in the Meatpacking District on 10th Ave. This place is beautiful. You want to look the part. Jackets are preferred, not required. But you will want to look good. Â If you arrive early, they'll insist you sit at the bar, either to order a drink or just to have a comfortable seat. They definitely accommodate your every need here. When we were seated at our table, it was clear service was a top priority. We opted for the Menu Tradizionale. I had just seen The Book of Mormon, so figured, why not completely overload ALL of the senses today? The tasting menu is a beautiful progression of dishes. Italian at its finest. The amuse bouches are mind-blowing. Each dish seems to get bigger, bolder, and better. Menu Tradizionale for 08/19/12: - La Salada NISSARDA Preserved Wild Salmon and Ribs of Escarole- BOLLITO MISTO Terrina Broccoli Blossoms and Horseradish Crema- ANGEL HAIR & Scampi in Acqua Pazza Lemon Basil and Galangal- TIMPANO alla Tucci: ""Big Night,"" 1996 Meatballs, Sausages, Salami, and Rib-Bits- VEAL & BEEF: Cosa Viene Prima? Beefsteak Tomato, Tater Tots, Wild Watercress, and Cacio di Roma- Warmed LA TUR Charred Bread and Chocolate- Crostata di PESCHE Ricotta, and Tarrangon GelatoEverything was so elegant and delicious. The Timpano all Tucci was an absolute astounding dish, completely savory and filling. As was the subsequent dish, the Veal and Beef, featuring the best veal I have ever consumed. This was glorious. It was also the point that I started developing the meat sweats. Vision was blurring, temperature rising, and coordination slipping. I found myself increasingly clumsy, spilling a little more food and drink that I would have liked. Before the dessert, a second clean tablecloth was placed in my direction. I thought, ""Wow, this is service!"" Aloud, my friend said, ""You have received The Cloth of Shame!"" Â Our meal at Del Posto was sheer perfection. Fast, just drink water, you want to come here hungry, with your A game. You do not want to miss a bite.

529,UFl8JuuI5U-Xupl9z_5-bg,Carina H.,5.0 star rating,"I want to write this review while the meal is still fresh in my mind, but I'm battling the lethargy and drowsiness that follows a decadent meal.My friend and I came here for a spur of the moment meal at the bar. It was pouring as we dashed from the subway to the restaurant, so we were a bit soggy when we got to the bar. But once we started enjoy food and drinks, we forgot our minor physical discomfort for the lovely balanced drinks and the luscious food.Before I go into the food, a word or two about the service: everybody was so friendly and welcoming, and incredibly patient as they answered our questions. They were incredibly knowledgeable about the food, the ingredients and history, and about the various spirits at the bar. I was really impressed with how efficient and considerate the staff was. Excellent experience.We started with the Aperol Spritz and the Clover Club. Both were so well balanced, and the Clover Club was especially lovely with its foamy top.The amuse bouche trio (cauliflower veloute with dehydrated cauliflower rim; ""chicken salad sandwich"" made with braised chicken legs; dehydrated polenta filled with milk soaked bacalao with sheep's milk ricotta) was delicious and the perfect way to kick off the meal with a little sweet, a lot of savory, and everything well seasoned.We then split two antipasti and two primi:Aerated STRACCIATELLA with Smoky Peperonata, Sicilian Anchovies & Bruised Basil -- a cheese (think the middle part of burrata) dish was rich, yet light. The anchovies worked so well with the cheese and the tart sweetness of the peperonata.Charred OCTOPUS with Umbrian Garbanzo, Celery Hearts & 25 yr Aceto Tradizionale -- the smells that hit you once the balsamic vinegar hit the charred octopus were amazing. The octopus was perfectly cooked and tender, and the garbanzo beans and garbanzo puree rounded out the dish nicely.At this point we needed drink refills. We had the La Primavera (with aged Bols) and a drink the bartender whipped up for us featuring Hendricks, St. Germain, cucumber, and lime. Both were excellent.Ricotta & Egg Yolk GNUDI with Shaved Asparagus Bird's Nest Style -- just wow. Luscious barely describes this dish. The gnudi were so tender and light and just held the warm egg yolk. Such a decadent dish.Yesterday's 100 Layer LASAGNE alla Piastra & Tomato Passato -- this dish is truly the crowning glory. Dozens of layers of ultra thin lasagna noodles, perfectly tender and never a soggy bite. Delicious 6-hour bolognese. Perfect bechamel. And a wonderfully tart and tasty marinara. It's hard to believe that all those ingredients went into this dish. The thin slice was heated on the piastra so it got a little charred, giving everybody a perfectly toasted end piece. we thought we were full after the gnudi, but managed to do justice to the lasagne it was that amazing.But who am I kidding? After the palate cleanser (a citrus sorbet with some toasted cashew gelato topped with orange zest and sea salt (some of the details escape me)), we also managed to do justice to dessert. Even though we were so stuffed, we were persuaded to get dessert after hearing that their pastry chef had won a James Beard award. Really, how could we pass it up? And how could we know we'd end up with far more dessert than we had bargained for...At the bartender's suggestion (she was really lovely, friendly, and funny and an excellent mixologist), we had theMELANZANE e Cioccolato alla Napoletana with Sheep's Milk Ricotta Stracciatella -- I wouldn't have imagined that sheep's milk cheese and chocolate (the stracciatella) would have gone so well with eggplant, chocolate, and balsamic vinegar (all on a crispy pastry). This dish was delicious and the eggplant was such a surprise. We polished this off.We were also presented with some tiramisu gelato which was, hands down, the best tiramisu gelato I've ever had. The cake pieces were moist but not soggy; the coffee and cocoa were balanced; and the gelato base was really decadent. And the rum in it was perfect.Then we got their little ""box"" of desserts. Served in a box cheese grater, there were 3 bite-sized desserts on top and 3 in the drawer (again, some details elude me):A mini ice cream pop dipped in chocolate with nuts -- like a ridiculously good Klondike barA polenta tart -- goodMini bombolini stuffed with lemon custard -- light and lemonyFree form truffles dipped in dark chocolate and cocoa powder -- rich and melted beautifullyChampagne caramels wrapped in rice paper -- buttery, caramelly, champagne-grapeyDehydrated grapefruit rehydrated in grenadine -- tart, fruity, sweetAll in all a perfect, indulgent, decadent meal.

Â Unlike some other top tier restaurants, the employees did not seem to really enjoy their work. Â The atmosphere almost could not be better. Â It is a beautiful restaurant with an interesting seating arrangement that gives plenty of privacy even though it was crowded that night. When you are paying well over $100 per person, skill and creativity in the kitchen should really shine. Â There were six of us, so we got a varied sampling. Â Appetizers were creative and very tasty, and the grilled octopus was exceptional. Â However, the meal went downhill from there. Â By the time we got to our main courses Â there was nothing on the menu to really perk your curiosity. Â Veal came slightly dry, lamb prepared no differently from any above average restaurant, and the seafood had nothing special to say about it. Desserts had a nice presentation, but again nothing was over the top great.At the prices listed for lunch, I think this is a great choice; however, if they want to be in the league of those few restaurants that defend high prices with an exceptional dining experience (Eleven Madison Park comes to mind) then they need to vastly improve their dinner menu.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Â The restaurant was beautiful, the service was impeccable (they brought me an ottoman for my clutch! Who does that?) and the food was outrageously good. Â Super, super rich and probably more calories than anyone should eat in a single week let alone a single meal, but delicious!We opted for the seven-course tasting menu with optional wine pairings and the chocolate and rum tasting. Per our waiter, this option allowed us to close our menus and have the chef create something we'd enjoy. Â Stand-outs included the tagliatelle with truffle butter and fresh-shaved truffles, the orecchiette with lamb ragu, and the tartare of beef. Â My colleagues raved about the lobster, but I'm not a fan, and while it was quite good, it wasn't a favorite for me. Â Dessert included a selection of chocolates accompanied by a flight of rum plus a selection of donuts, homemade caramels and petit fours for the table. Â Amongst the chocolates - our favorite was the chocolate lollipops.I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of Del Posto, but I'm not sure I'd go back. I'd perhaps consider it for a very fancy occasion, and of course it's wonderful for a work-related (read: expense account) event. Â Although the food was amazing and the experience was incredible, over $300 per person for a meal is a bit steep in my opinion.

The standout dish was Rare Salmon which is slow poached in Olive Oil, its Alaskan king Salmon, need I say more. The Lobster ceaser is also really good. The truffled beef is outstanding as well.

Did we ask for a side of attitude with our meal?? The food (bittergreen salads, burnt beef, spicy spaghetti) was decent, but nothing extraordinary. Â Certainly not worth the over hour's wait or the prices (high enough to be excluded on the menu). Â For comparison, we've had far more pleasant experiences in other Batali establishments... Babbo and Esca...where sitting at the bar meant friendly and prompt service. Â To top off the night, they offered to catch us a cab home.

Â Not that Daniel isn't epic perfection, it's just that we've been there twice recently and Del Posto beats it in any dish-to-dish comparison. Â The food is flat-out, no-compromise, mind-opening. Â Quality, inventiveness, harmony, and just plain good-tasting are as good as it gets. Â If you are a person who really loves food and you bring great focus and attention to experiencing what comes out of that kitchen, you will be greatly rewarded for your effort.The room is gorgeous, the service is warm, generous, and friendly in a way that is perfectly professional without being either stiff or obsequious. Â The training is flawless, and every person working that floor can tell you anything you want to know about every item on the menu or wine list.The captain, Richard, was so eloquent and easy-yet-passionate in his descriptions of menu items that it was practically performance art.

If you're accustomed to gourmet food, you won't find anything special here.The food was hit or miss, with nothing really blowing my mind. The bread basket was the star of the show. Portions were ample and filling, but the tasting menu was a little too fussy. In retrospect, I would forsake 5 disparate courses for a big bowl of the lamb neck Orecchiette. Dessert was mediocre. The panna cotta was thin and gelatinous. The Melanzane was an interesting idea, eggplant for dessert, but the only good part was the sheepsmilk ice cream it came with. The coffee was strong, I'll give them that. Overall the meal was good, but by no means a culinary delight.The service was fine, with a polite albeit inexperienced waitstaff that felt the need to explain in detail every ingredient manifest on my plate. While I have been to plenty of restaurants that do this, the whole effect felt especially contrived at Del Posto. It was certainly not the elegant, well-oiled machine you'll find at say, Daniel, nor is it the hip, savvy crew you'd find at a trendy Brooklyn eatery. Essentially, it felt like people trying to be fancy without actually knowing how to pull it off, resulting in them just seeming tense. The decor is beautifully done. The ambiance ... well ... I can't say one exists really. It's not exactly warm and welcoming. It's just a big grand dining room, pretty on the eyes, with no tangible soul.In a nutshell, it wasn't bad, it wasn't amazing.

We arrived a little early and had drinks at the bar. Once our table was ready, they took our drinks and escorted us to our table upstairs. They even had little ottomans for the lady's purses. The waiter orchestrated his associates to hand out the menus and started reviewing with us the options. He mentioned that there were two prix fixe options we could choose from and the prices.Our VP started signaling that we were about to be over budget and that we couldn't eat here. Our options were to go over budget, or explain our situation and just leave. He went downstairs and explained to the host our situation and immediately the host came to our table. He sincerely apologized and explained that an al la carte option is always available and that the waiter should not have presented the menus in a prix fixe only matter.I assume the waiter wanted a higher tip, or maybe he actually didn't know the options at his job, but whatever the case may be, we were all extremely turned off.

556,nhJc3hqllASqxwoVY6Ar1A,Serena T.,4.0 star rating,"As a collaboration among Mario Batali, Lidia Bastianich (of Lidia's Italian Kitchen) and Lidia's son Joseph, Del Posto offers more than your typical Italian fare. Â Set in a cavernous space in the Meatpacking district, Del Posto offers top-notch service along with its cuisine (case in point - my eating buddy's purse was offered a chair. Really? Really.) I recently took advantage of Del Posto's prix fixe lunch menu. Â At $29 for antipasto, entree and dessert of choice, it is a fairly economical way to get an idea of what this restaurant is all about.We were first presented with amuse bouche. Â I'm not exactly sure what the top left morsels were, but I believe there was pork involved, 'nuff said. Â We also got a seafood salad in crispy pastry, and a chilled tomato soup in a celery salt-rimmed cup. Â I admit I licked all around the cup. Â Come on, you know you would too.I don't usually document the breadbasket, but the presentation of two spreads warranted it - especially when one spread was lardo. Â Even if you don't speak Italian, I'm sure you can guess what it is. Â And it was scrumptious!Our first antipasto was the Warm Cotechino with Umbrian Lentil Vinaigrette & Dried Fruit Mostarda. Â Cotechino is a fresh pork sausage; this presentation was accompanied by a dried fruit compote - I believe the fruits were cherries and prunes. Â The cotechino was warm and slightly spicy, nicely balanced by the compote. Â Our second antipasto was the Insalata Primareva della Terra. Â A spring garden salad is usually pretty run-of-the-mill; however, Del Posto's take on it was beautiful. Â Flowers in my food often confuse me - is it a bouquet? Am I supposed to eat that blossom? Â But my eating buddy put the salad away pronto, so it looks like this dish was both pretty and yummy.Our first entree dish was veal agnolotti with ramp butter. Â Agnolotti is a stuffed pasta. Â In this case, you could tell at the first bite that it was freshly made, and the ramp butter was delish! (I loooove ramps!). Â However, I kid you not, I took a picture below before taking any bites. Â I count 17 agnolotti, each being the size of a Starburst. Â I ate as slowly as I could and finished it in 5 minutes. Sad.We also had the Halibut with Caponatina, Crunchy Fregola & Moorish Spices. Â Caponatina is a stewed eggplant, celery and olive mix, while fregola is similar to couscous. Â The halibut was tender, juicy and not over cooked, while the caponatina was flavorful but not overwhelming to the fish. Â We had quite a few options for dessert, and the four we ordered did not disappoint. Â They're all very different, so your liking will depend on individual taste. Â I will say that each was well-balanced in terms of flavor and texture - you can't go too wrong with any of them. Â In addition to Lidia's Sweet Pea Cake with Local Strawberries & Strawberry Gelato, we had:Sfera di Caprino with Celery & Fig Agrodolce & Celery Sorbetto. Â Featuring goat cheesecake balls and celery sorbet, this unconventional dessert was both rich and refreshing.Tartufo al Caffe with Dark Chocolate, Sant Eustachio Coffe & Candied Lemon. There was nothing too outrageous about the tartufo, but its dark chocolate flavor was intense. A definite must-try for coffee or chocolate fans.Butterscotch Semifreddo with Melon Agrumata, Crumbled Sbrisolona & Milk Jam. Â I LOVE semifreddo. Â  The butterscotch wasn't too overpowering (I was afraid it would bring back memories of those bright yellow candies) and I wanted to lick that caramel milk jam of the plate. I didn't, but I wanted to. Maybe next time.To top off our extravaganza of desserts, we were presented with a complimentary dessert sampler. Â There was candied grapefruit with caramel and amaretti crumbs, a sweet/savory fruit tart, bombolini (orange vanilla cream mini doughnuts. I had one and had to close my eyes for a few seconds), and chocolate olive-oil popsicles. If you're looking for a departure from your typical pasta and red sauce Italian fare, Del Posto is worth a sample. Â Taking traditional ingredients and creating new presentations, the chefs yield some delightful surprises. Â I admit the ambiance was a little *too* fancy for my everyday comfort. Â Then again, I'm not a particularly fancy girl, and if I must pretend fancy-ness for a few hours to revel these scrumptious dishes, it's worth it.At $29 for the Prix Fixe lunch, it's worth a try.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

We did this for the freedom of choice but also because the aforementioned 100 LAYER LASAGNA (really, I counted them, ok that's a lie, but I peeled a few off and deducted it must be true) was made available to us as a separate item for $20, even though it normally isn't. And I went to Del Posto for the 100 LAYER LASAGNA, even though it's a postage stamp (a postage stamp of goodness, mind). Here's what we had:Complementary starters and bread. The bread was fantastic. I've never actually spread pig lard onto anything before and eaten it. And this pig lard was seasoned with rosemary.Antipasti:Roasted Autumn VEGETABLES with Robiola Sformato & Truffled Hazelnuts (the sformato was like a schmear and was very nice with the delicious vegetables, which Italian restaurants so often do so well)Seared LAMB Tenderloin with Sea Cucumbers Mare e Monte & Saffron Yogurt (the lamb didn't taste like lamb, it was so delicate and delectable; was an interesting combination flavor with the chewy sea cucumber)Primi:100 Layer LASAGNE al RagÃ¹ Bolognese (so completely delicious I cannot describe it... it was like butter and I usually find lasagna a little tough... I even liked the tomato sauce, which is rare for me since I'm Italian myself and therefore judgmental about it... a shame the portion is so tiny)CARAMELLE di Gorgonzola Dolce with Black Truffle Butter (tasted like candy, but, you know, in a good way)Handmade ORECCHIETTE with Lamb Neck Ragu, Lentils & Green Mustard (I thought the lamb and lamb selections would complement each other, but I didn't like this one so much; too salty and bland but certainly as herbaceous as described)Secondi:Wood-Grilled LOBSTER with Artichokes, Almonds & Basils (I believe this was described as rich and bold or something, and it certainly was; quite possibly the most delicious, succulent lobster I have ever had, and a big piece taken out and then put back into the shell; some may find it too spicy for lobster, but I loved it and almost cried)Seared DUCK Breast, Apician Spices, Savor alla Francescana & Lovage Â (easily the best duck I have ever had; didn't even look like duck, more like tender beef or lamb; I did cry this time)Dolci:Chocolate Ricotta TORTINO, Toasted Sicilian Pistachios & Extra Virgin Olive Oil Gelato (the gelato made me cry a second time)Pineapple CROSTATA, Champagne Vinegar Caramel & Vanilla Gelato (I thought nearly perfect, but my companion was unimpressed)A few little cookies and cakelets offered gratis at the end plus a small box of two effervescent truffles for the lady on the way out.Service is excellent: attentive to the point of being unctuous. They clearly run a tight ship at Del Posto and no fault of the servers, who are true professionals, I find this sort of thing overbearing, artificial, and soulless, like most haute New York dining experiences these days, especially those in big money emulation of the olde worlde.

We enjoy dining at nice restaurants, but usually wind up being the youngest people there, being freshly 21. For some reason this always results in the wait staff ignoring us, or just not really caring about us. I never understood this, but it ALWAYS happens. Del Posto was super accommodating and did not give us the usual feeling of being ostracized. All of the wait staff were extremely attentive, and extremely knowledgable of the menu. The sommelier was extremely knowledgeable as well. I have very limited experience with wine and he explained every glass with strenuous detail. Now onto the food.We did the 5 course dinner menu. For appetizers we started with the truffled carne cruda and the lobster alla cesare. Both dishes were extremely flavored and came exactly as the waiter described. The portions were quite big, the carne cruda being quite on the heavy side actually. For the pasta tasting we opted for the Luna Piena and the Orecchiette with lamb neck sausage. The Luna piena is one of the best pata dishes I have ever had. The truffle butter was delicous, creamy, rich, and just flat out amazing. The pasta was perfectly cooked as well. The Orecchiette was delicous too. The pasts itself is thicker than the usual Orecchiette, due to egg being used, and was cooked perfectly. The lamb neck sausage was flavorful and perfectly spiced. 2 Great dishes. For entrees I ordered the veal chop alla rossini, and my date the sliced lamb. My entree was honestly perfect. The meat was extremely flavorful, juicy, and cooked PERFECTLY. The lamb dish was superb as well, and the Pistachio Gremolata really took the dish to the next level. The best part of the meal was definitely the desert course. We ordered the butterscotch semifreddo and the torta barozzi. My semifreddo Â was the perfect to end the meal. I don't know what to say other than it was perfect, definitely opt for this desert. The torta was delicious as well, with the blood orange gelato really standing out. They also gave us a complimentary dessert sampler with an assortment of goodies. We were completely stuffed by the end of the meal. Del posto truly lives up to it's hype.

566,PiyAxsCNQnPufNLNE98eew,Lawrence C.,5.0 star rating,"Del Posto gets a lot of flak from the self-proclaimed culinary elite. ""Unmemorable."" ""Don't bother."" ""This is NOT four-star cuisine."" And when my convives and I were seated in the too-dark balcony, overlooking the gauche marble floors and grandiose staircase... well, I wasn't about to argue with the naysayers.So you can hardly blame me for being unprepared for a foie gras terrine rolled in dark chocolate nibs and plated on a dollop of strawberry jam (""ragu"", it said on the menu, but who are we kidding?) ringed by almond panna cotta. Wasn't this supposed to be Batali/Bastianich's bid for classical dining glory? This dish seemed ridiculous.And so my guard was down when I took that first bite, with that strawberry jam hitting a quick fortissimo, then disappearing into a smooth sweetness. A moment passed. Then the terrine broke down on my tongue, releasing its deeply decadent, complex notes just in advance of the nibs melting and adding an indulgent fragrance into the mix. And I looked down in wonder at this creation, and almost in a daze, scooped a bit of the panna cotta into my mouth and found that its texture echoed the terrine perfectly, its nuttiness adding a touch of welcome dryness after the preceding fatty splendor.And I finally knew the place was serious.I'd stalled for years. Instead, I'd elbowed into aging-rock-star Babbo, still finding it kick-ass. I waltzed into Scarpetta and, despite all the expectations, was blown away by that can't-be-overhyped spaghetti pomodoro. Maialino, Osteria Morini, Torrisi, Rubirosa, every other Next Big Italian Thing, I visited. Most of all, I went to Marea and was granted my single best meal of 2010. What could Del Posto add to that?But Del Posto surprised me with more than just goose liver and chocolate. Anellini (""little rings"") normally has the shape of SpaghettiOs, but here the label was applied to pasta shaped like a wide-band diamond ring, a fontina blend filling in for the gemstone. Gorgeous, and I couldn't even tell how it was physically possible -- the layer of the ""ring"" part seemed too thin to split into something that could hold a filling, and yet. The lightest of white truffle sauces was pooled in the bowl, and it was flawless: one of the only times that truffles haven't seemed like a sledgehammer to me. Six tiny little rings, and still I thought it was one of the best pastas I'd ever had.The other pasta course, a 100-layer lasagna, was equally eye-opening. The flavors were grandmotherly in all the best ways, but the noodle layers were so thin that they dissolved on the tongue as if they'd been made of butter, or sunlight. Only the fact that there were 50 of them kept it around long enough for a conscious impression: it was like a movie, where the individual frames can't be discerned, just their aggregation into a narrative. What an update of a classic.Not everything was as impossibly successful. Six (!) amuses bouche were bound to be a little uneven, though a haute take on a mini-Reuben made me laugh. A crudo of spotted prawns was fresh and delicious, but a molecular-y topping of liquid-nitrogen-frozen citrus was distracting. And no matter how much work a kitchen puts into beef tenderloin, Wagyu or sous vided or whatever, it's basically the same idea as filet mignon: tasty as it is, only so much interest can be crammed into it without the sort of Frenchified heavy sauce that Del Posto conspicuously eschews.But the minimalist Italian aesthetic finds triumph again in the unlikely guise of a seemingly all-too-French cheese course -- an aged pecorino with a drizzle of saffron-spiked honey, served with toast, was a lovely grace note. And speaking of bread, Del Posto has, I shit you not, the city's Best Bread Basket: warm triangles of focaccia, beautifully crusty mini-baguettes, a cracking multgrain roll, and the only olive loaf I've ever actually enjoyed. And lest we forget Batali is involved, lardo is one of the spread choices. If only they'd replace the bread with a new warm batch as soon as you were running low...Oh wait, they did.Otherwise, I don't remember much about the service side of things, which I consider a major plus: none of the fawning of Daniel or the business formality of Le Bernardin. Of course, a server did drop a fork at one point, so if you're the kind of douchebag who cares about that sort of thing, BE WARNED.Dessert centered around a simple roasted apple half perched on a grilled lemon cake, providing a nice crunch. Paired basil gelato was sinfully smooth and a flavor punch that will be familiar to anyone who's sampled the gelato offerings at another of Batali's joints, Otto. Mignardises were uniformly good, too, especially a grapefruit chew in a mysteriously edible clear wrapper.So, perfect? No. But magical at times, and delicious throughout. If you want more from your major dinners, well, I don't know what to tell you.Probability of return within 1 year: 10%, but not because I don't want to",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

568,XbXCuZII2RXMmHvXKLQD8Q,Ashwin T.,4.0 star rating,"Del Posto resides in the fashionable, albeit a pain to get to, meat packing district. The plain, almost warehouse-esque outside decor conceals a beautifully decorated restaurant. High ceilings, classy candle light, a live pianist sets the scene. Service is of the highest quality throughout, starting with a hostess who greets you by name, and a waiter who is refined, polite and knowledgable. Seating is comfortable and far apart that you are not privy to the conversations of your neighbors.The $39 3 course lunch prix fixe is, while pricy, a reasonable deal given the typical cost of a meal at this establishment. In addition to the amuse bouches of a delicious cauliflower soup, and 2 items that pretty much resembled tuna salad finger sandwiches, my date and I split:Chilled Lobster - ($10 supplement): generous portion, with good accoutrements. Would recommend.Vitello Tonatto - veal in a tuna sauce. Not overly flattering in presentation, and the tuna taste overwhelemed IMHOHandmade Orechiette - (optional pasta course, $10 per person). Delicious pasta, but a tiny portion! Heritage Pork Trio - the large pork chop was tasty, but a tad dry on the inside. The other pork servings were betterNeapolitan Lamb - perfectly cooked and tender, with a delicious accompanying salsaButterscotch SemiFreddo and Chocolate Cherry Tartufo for dessert - not much of a dessert guy, but both of these were ok (preferred the butterscotch).Overall, a reasonable deal for the lunch special.

This is standard for a restaurant of this caliber. I'm a big cocktail nerd and I love that I have an amazing selection of cocktails to choose from, the ability to throw a spirit or an ingredient or flavor profile at a bartender and have him or her craft something unique and original for me, and also the ability to have a conversation with the bartender about anything in the beverage world. But what impresses me most is that I continually come in here in jeans and a t-shirt (and I do NOT recommend this), mostly because my visits are totally spontaneous, and I'm always treated with the utmost courtesy and respect.

577,jhmXPvD9pwRxXwhMzwtusQ,Steve M.,3.0 star rating,"The thing is, when you go for a special occasion, when you splurge to this extent, you walk away feeling robbed if the food is not special. I had been looking forward to a meal at Del Posto for a very long time, and in the end I found it very disappointing.We went on a Sunday evening and went for the 5-course tasting menu. The waitstaff is spectacularly attentive, and the space is beautiful. There are hundreds of flickering Â candles strewn across the staircase-laden hall. There's a live pianist who plays silky tunes at just the right volume. Wonderful.The food was disappointing. Across the board, dishes came out at room temperature. The charred octopus was tough, and the lentils beneath the simple cotechino were badly undercooked. The hundred layer lasagna is served as a 4"" x 4"" x 1/2"" tile on a gigantic plate on top of some nondescript marinara sauce. It is dry. Some people like their lasagna on the dry side so if that's your thing you'll be into it, it's certainly an impressive dish.The lamb neck pasta is very flavorful but has a weird texture and like the lasagna, is served in a haphazard, small, off-center heap on a huge plate. The pork trio featured a dry, flavorless loin, an overly salty rib, and a delicious ribollita stew (cabbage and borlotti beans). The burnt beef ribeye ($20 unmarked supplemental fee, beware!) arrived thoroughly burnt, as advertised, and although it tasted great, there was no magic, it was a piece of burnt meat.The desserts were outstanding, the tartufo (cherry ice cream) and tortino (w/ pistachios) stood out as the only truly special dishes. I can't even remember what the little ""chef's compliment"" amuse bouche was, one of the waiters muttered it and it seemed hopeless to ask him to repeat it.Overall it felt like an off-night, there weren't many guests; the sommelier used adjectives like ""good"" and ""very good"" to describe the wines in our budget (b/t $75 - $100); most guests wore jeans.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

It has been on my list to check out so I was eager to see what was in store for me.We had reservations but because public transportation is so unreliable, we actually were 30 minutes late and W was worried we'd lose our reservation (after he booked it one month in advance!), but when we arrived, there were plenty of empty dinner tables on a Friday night at the prime dinner hour. The hostess acknowledged our courtesy late call and thankfully kept our reservation. We then were seated and promptly given the menus.Several minutes after being at the table, we were asked at least 5 different times (by the same person) if we wanted to order anything from the drink menu. We had plans for night time drinking so we both declined, but when I was asked over and over again, I was ready to just order a glass of wine so I'd stop hearing ""would you like to order anything off the wine list?""We had a hard time ordering since everything on the menu sounded great. Here's the lo down of what was ordered:-Orecchiette ($24): homemade pasta with sausages...PERFECT. I could have just eaten a plate of this as an entree (instead of a primi) and would have been satisfied!-Lamb ($37): OMG. I should have ordered this. Perfectly cooked, seasoned and was tender, juicy, moist...too bad it was only 2 shanks!-100 Layer Lasagne ($35): I was trying to count if there really was 100 noodle layers...I don't think so. It was served lukewarm (chef's recommendation) and I felt soggy. Not your average Stouffers lasagne, but I would try something else...-Tartufo al Caffe ($15): chocolatey goodness! Think of a scoop of coffee icecream that has been coated in chocolate, topped with candied lemon-Pineapple Crostata ($15): pineapple pastry with vanilla icecream...I preferred the Taftufo.We were also given an amuse-bouche which had two dim sum looking items and a small cup of soup. The dim sum looking items (sorry, don't remember what it was) was alright...I never tried the soup because a server took the plate away, before I had a chance to grab the cup. He didn't even ask if we were done, he just took it and then gave us the bread basket with butter and house-cured lard (no, I didn't try the lard). With dessert, we were also given a cookie plate with 4 different cookies which was nice and served as a nice, light dessert taster...in addition to what we ordered.Service was very attentive (a bit too attentive for my tastes) and I was happy with everything...except for the waiter taking away my amuse-bouche before I had a chance to stop him. Upon leaving, I also received a small, gold box which contained two semi-sweet and super smooth truffles. DELISH!I would definitely come back and try the $95/person dinner tasting!

598,zlduGiTnkNiPMpBxQrY6WQ,Dan W.,4.0 star rating,"I'm on the fence about this being a 5 vs 4 star experience. Â The reason is the price. Â We went all out and dropped a ton of money. Â Just not sure it was worth it in the end. Â Some things were amazing, some just didn't get there. Â For what we paid it should have been non-stop amazement.Things that I loved - Very impressive inside - definitely very large and ornate Truffles - the aroma hit you as soon as you walk in the door and throughout the mealTruffles - were involved in at least three of our courses and we added the heaping shaved truffles to our first pasta dishLardo - was served with the breads. Â BrilliantService was pretty amazing. Â Details were well enforced. Â Meal highlights - - Baby radicchio with truffle vinaigrette - one of the best salads I've had in my lifetime. Â - The pastas were pretty amazing. Â Perfectly prepared. Â One with crab and the other with shaved black truffles and soft ricotta. - Goose and Goose - Large duck breast and foie gras - perfect- Dessert was very fun. Â 5 different desserts came out to share with mignardise as well. Â Most were excellent. - Champagne aperitif was excellent Meal middlelights - Nothing was truly off except I just didn't feel like some things made the grade for the level of the restaurant.- amuse bouche was like a chicken salad sandwich of sorts? Â Tasted fine, but just not the level expected?- cheese course was one lonely little sliver of cheese about 1 inch, probably only weighed a couple of grams...... it was literally not even one bite worth. Â it felt as if the kitchen was short on this cheese, so they cut one piece into five portions and served it.- some wines were excellent, others were good. Â We added wine pairing for everyone, so they were pouring bottles.

I went here on a date two years ago for my birthday. We did the 5 course tasting menu and ordered a magnum of wine (umm yea, happy birthday to me!) I remember rolling out (literally) finally around midnight feeling quite fat and drunk... and also perfectly happy with the fact that I did not have to grab the tab on that one (as it may have been one of the most expensive meals to date). The other feeling I remember having besides the oncoming food coma, was being a bit overwhelmed. The ambiance and presentation while simply elegant is a bit over the top for me (personally I prefer more of an intimate feel). From the moment you walk in and up the front staircase you're hit over the head with grandeur. It's a bit ostentatious for my liking, but it is fun for a celebration. The food from what I can remember was very good. I loved the 2 tastes of pasta. We shared a veal chop for two and while it was delicious, there was just so much food... I probably passed out on the cab home from being so gluttonous (haha what a fun date I was). Service is impeccable and everything is done with such a beautiful presentation, from decanting the wine to carving the meat. However, when my date shows up later than expected due to work and this girl did an extra killer work out at the gym so she wouldn't have to feel bad about indulging on all the goodness Mr. Batali had to offer, I don't really care about the ridiculous show of wine pouring and food parading... just get it to my plate please!

Â The room is grand and beautiful, and just stepping inside transports you to another place and time. Â The service is superb, it's formal and practiced without being at all snobbish. Â  Â  My date and I chose the 5 course tasting and accompanying wine parings. Â We told our server that we wanted to share everything, so each dish came out one at a time, and split for us, so we essentially had an eight course meal of our choosing. Â The sommelier also split our wines, so we also got to try 8 different glasses (in addition to a prosecco toast)To start we had the charred octopus and lobster fra diavolo. Â The octopus was one of the best dishes of the night, a true highlight. Â Tender charred octopus lay atop pureed garbanzo beans, parked with celery hearts and garbanzos, and topped with a drizzle of 25 year aged balsamic.. the balsamic puts this already incredible dish over the edge. Â The lobster was served cold and topped with seaweed, and while delicious, wasn't as exciting as the octopus. Â The garlic panna cotta is was served with was unique. Â For the pasta course we opted for the decadent tortello puzzone, little shoe shaped raviolis, filled with taleggio cheese and covered in black truffle butter. Â The raviolis were bursting with the sweet and tangy cheese and covered with fragrant truffles Â This dish was so rich and pushed the limits of decadence. Â We also had the spaghetti with dungeness crab and jalapeÃ±o. Â This pasta is a beautiful dish that comes together in an exciting and delightful way. Â The flavors danced in my mouth as I enjoyed each bite.For second the Sardinian lamb was incredible. Â While the lamb chop is delicious, the hunk of lamb neck is divine. Â It was one of the most flavorful bites of meat I've ever had. Â The burnt beef was also outstanding, a large perfectly cooked rib eye served with potato torte and a sliced tongue accompaniment. Â It was too much, and too good. Â The Desserts were less memorable than the savory items. Â I recall the butterscotch semifreddo being marvelous but can't remember the other..

Batali and Bastianich's Del Posto really is the essence of fine dining and more than deserved the 5 stars of my rating. Del Posto is a beautiful and elegantly decorated restaurant, with marble floors, staircases, and Coach leather menus. We were seated at the bar while our table was set up for, and we each ordered a wonderfully well-made cocktail. The wine list is quite extensive, with some nice by-the-glass options, many of which come from the Bastianich family's vineyard. We looked at the menu and had quite a time decided which of the amazing sounding antipasti, primi, secondi, and dolci to order. Of course, we managed to decide on some of the courses that cost additional fees, but it was well worth the splurge. Before your meal begins to arrive, a plate of amuses is brought to the table. One that was very beautiful was a crispy rice ball dusted in gold leaf. A delicious (and large) basket of bread was also put on our table, with butter as well as lardo for spreading. For our appetizers, we chose the LOBSTER SALAD Fra Diavola (with Broccoli Rabe & Dried Orange) and CARNE CRUDA (with Truffled Salsa, Parmigiano-Reggiano & Shaved Porcini) were perfectly cooked, rich, and decadent. As entrees, we had the Seared DUCK Breast (Apician Spices, Savor alla Francescana & Lovage) and Grilled PORK (ode to Emilia-Romagna with Sunchoke Crema & Lambrusco). These were also prepared in the finest of manners and were full of flavor and texture. Lastly, we chose the Chocolate Ricotta TORTINO (with Sicilian Pistachios & Extra Virgin Olive Oil Gelato) and the Butterscotch SEMIFREDDO (Melon Agrumata, Crumbled Sbrisolona & Milk Jam). Both were delicious. As if that wasn't enough, a box was brought to our table with extra ""dessert bites"" including a chocolate covered gelato lollipop, mini tart with Meyer lemon, and candied grapefruit.

Â UGH do I hate having my travels and dining experiences cross over those dreaded times! Â The service was not up to par for a restaurant of this caliber, and I will give the benefit of the doubt that it was due to the influx of first-time customers looking for whatever deal was being offered (maybe?) but still find it inexcusable for a restaurant of this caliber and price point. Ambiance-yes, this is an old school place. Â No hipster waiters, club music, or artsy flair. Â I like classic and classy dining rooms sometimes, so this was right up my alley. Â My companion seemed to have read the comments by other reviewers before we arrived, as he was cracking jokes about ""old folks"" in the dining room, even though there was a 30-something hipster couple seated next to us. Â I have certainly been to my fair share of ""old school"" dining establishments, some of which lack any life at all (in food, ambiance or service...) and Del Posto is not one of those places, and still has plenty of life in it. Â I know ambiance sets the tone for the experience, and all that class might make some feel stifled, but I always look to enjoy my dining experiences on my terms, which means having fun no matter how formal the room. Â Decadence and debauchery is a big turn on Â for me, and I love a formal outing as a prelude to the latter part of that combination! ;-)Food-octopus was fantastic! Spaghetti w/ crab was solid and tasty, but not out of the park fantastic. Â His pork and veal agnolotti w/ asparagus was rich and delicious. Â My pork w/ apricots, fennel and sweet corn trumped his lamb, but wasn't a dish I will remember for years to come, or need to revisit. Â Lydia's sweet pea cake w/ strawberry sorbetto will be the most memorable part of the meal for me. Â The flavor of the sorbetto was so fresh and pure, and was a perfect compliment to the sweet pea cakes. Â I don't remember the other dessert, as we both agreed that sweet pea cakes won hands down. Â Service-so service started off great. Â We were sat. Â We ordered cocktails. Â We were given the dinner menu (but no wine menu?) Â Our waiter returned to take our order, which we had to stop him before he left that we were interested in ordering a bottle of wine (???). Â Our amuse bouche came and went...still no wine list. Â 30 seconds before our appetizer arrived, the sommelier hastily dropped the wine tablet without waiting to see if we wanted suggestions or had questions. Â Yes, I love having hot food placed in front of me while trying to look through an extensive wine list and make a choice... (insert eye roll here) Â He finally returned, my friend made his selection, and we resumed on course, but that should have never happened like that. Â The other thing re: service is that we *thought* we were ordering a la carte. Â I ordered my three courses. Â He ordered his three courses. Â We were both served 4 courses, each receiving a portion of the pasta we had each ordered for ourselves. Â We weren't sure if they were just splitting it for us to be nice? Â Come dessert, we were only going to order one dessert to split, and where told we might as well order 2 as we were getting the 5 course price-fixe. Â Maybe it was cheaper that way, who knows...but it was never discussed or clarified when making our original order, and we never mentioned wanting the 5 course price-fixe when we placed our order. Â Again, not what I consider to be good service, which includes clarification of such things. Â There should be no awkward surprises or questions about what you are signed up for, and that has nothing to do with if someone is on a budget or not. Â Of course my date did not say anything, because who wants to create tension when you are taking a girl out on the town? Â But I noticed, and I didn't like it... Will I be back?

I've been to dozens of michelin-starred restaurants and this is by far the most overrated 1-star in the book - and crazy expensive for what you get! Came here for my birthday and ordered the 5-course tasting menu. The amuse bouches were just ok - some lentil soup, a chickpea fritter, and a pickled daikon. Nothing went together. Just interesting but unremarkable bite sized amuses. We then had the octopus and lobster salad as our antipasti. Both were forgettable in every way - with strange flavor combinations that we couldn't understand. As our primi, we shared 2 pasta dishes - one which required a $10 supplement (which ended up being $20 when the check arrived because 2 people shared a single portion of pasta!!!). The first pasta was a truffled butter ravioli - very tasty, but the portion of minuscule. One bite and it's done. Restaurants may like to control their portions, but pasta is NOT an expensive ingredient. We paid $20 extra for basically 1 big bite of ravioli! The other pasta dish was a lamb orrecchiette which featured partially burnt/charred bits of overly salted meat. The main courses, the secondi, were a bit more successful. The pork was a good portion and was capably prepared but it lacked harmony. The lobster with polenta was very small and while the lobster itself was delicious (as was the polenta), all the other accompaniments (raw onions, and other random thinly sliced veggies) had nothing to do on that dish. No coherence whatsoever in flavors. The worst part of the experience was dessert. We ordered the date and coconut semolina cake which was nice but it was literally 3 bites. It was 2 inches by 2 inches - the portion you'd expect at restaurant week - not regular dinner service! We also had the ""fette biscottate"", a complete disaster of a dessert. It was two tiny rectangles of what tasted like ice cream, accompanied by a host of ridiculously and disgustingly salty ingredients that has no business being in any dessert plate. It was more a savory course than a dessert, and it had absolutely no redeeming qualities. The service was rushed and ""off"" and awkward throughout the whole meal. There was constant pressure to finish the meal and be out the door for the next seating! For a 1-star restaurant charging $350 (only 1 glass of wine mind you), you'd expect at least a good experience! This was terrible. I would never return.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

There's a nice wow-factor.The host, servers, and waiters are very professional and nice. It's hard to receive better service than they gave! Props to them :).I'd truthfully give this place 3.5 stars, but the knock-down was due to the taste of the food. I had the $115 pre-fixe dinner menu. You choose 2 pastas to share for the table, antipasta, secondi, and dolce (dessert). We ordered the Tortello Puzzone and the Orcchiette. They were really good but the dish was drowning in butter. The lobster antipasta was delicious, chilled with a nice tangy cocktail dressing. I highly recommend it, and of course... it comes on top of a circle of butter :). For the main entry, I had the heritage pork trio which was a nice slab of pork. It was a very good but it will be heavy in fat and not as tender as you'd expect it to be. All of the dessert is amazing :).Overall, wonderful place, great place to take a date. Be prepared for excellent service and expensive food.

Â In fact, one of the dishes tasted very similar to Chef Boyardi's Beeferoni. Â Lastly, the wine pairing did not compliment the dishes as well as they should have and seemed like an after thought.

Â The atmosphere knew better than to scream ""class,"" but politely whispered it in your ear. Â I've heard friends refer to Del Posto as one of the most perfect date spots in New York, and now can see why.The wine list is incredible. Â It's not enough to simply offer Dom Perignon- they have over a dozen permutations of it. Every Oenotheque going back to the '60's? Â Sign me up, so long as someone else is paying. Â The list of table wine, of course, was equally comprehensive, and there were many, many single malts and dessert wines to consider. Â Perhaps most importantly, the sommelier and wine director were extremely helpful in navigating the list.My party of four did the 7-course tasting menu. Â The standout dish was the hundred layer lasagne, which was possibly the most perfect pasta dish I've ever tasted. Â The primi (lamb and filet mignon) was good, but didn't rock my world. Â Portions were tiny, and I'm not a big guy, but I walked away hungry (after a $3,000 meal- not a good sign). Â Dessert was a clever miniature chest of drawers full of delicious morsels. Â I always appreciate an element of theatrics in my meal.Would I go back? Â Well, I've had better all-around dining experiences for far less money in Manhattan, but the food was generally very good. Â Perhaps not spectacular enough for that fifth star in the rarefied category that Del Posto exists, but I'll assume that it was an off night because they were very busy.

645,S1gn4P36uz9lTbun2wgD7w,AJ R.,3.0 star rating,"We recently dined at Del Posto with someone with a gluten allergy. We chose Del Posto because of their frequent claims that they are one of the best places to dine if you are gluten free. After speaking with our server about the need for a gluten free menu, we ordered the Captain's Menu (8 courses). It was a somewhat disappointing experience. While the service and ambience was wonderful, we can't say the same for the meal. Don't get me wrong, some of the food was quite good; however, almost every course had something missing. That is, the food would come and one plate would be described, and then the person who was gluten free would be told what was missing from her plate. It was baffling that on most of them simple substitutions weren't made. For example, one dish was served on a bed of breaded potatoes. Why couldn't the gluten free plate be served with a non-breaded potato or another starch? Instead it simply had nothing. This went on and on. We have dined at many wonderful fine dining restaurants in the city and this was the first time we have had such a startling difference in our plates. The gluten free pasta was good, but to be told at each serving what was missing was a let down (each time the server would say ""this plate has X...and yours does not""). The one exception was dessert. The pastry chef did not let us down and the dessert was wonderful. For a restaurant that promotes the idea that they are allergen-friendly, we were quite surprised at the disparity in the meals. It isn't like they charged less for the plates that had less on them. As I said, we appreciated the service and the work of the pastry chef. But I don't know that we would return or recommend it for any guests with food allergies or gluten sensitivities.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

So Originally Del Posto was NOT on my list for restaurants on my trip to NYC last month 10/26 thru 11/01, even though knowing it was one of Mario Batalli's places. But due to the Nature of Sandy the Hurricane most of my other reservations I had originally got canceled. So Del Posto was the only Michelin star restaurants open and accepting reservations at that time before sandy came. Anyhow, the restaurant is located in a nice area near the Hudson River, great and ample, warm, comfy and very posh setting.I came here with a friend; we did the 5 course tasting menu with Amuse Bouche and a glass of wine. The amuse bouche was delightful bite size Wafer with some meat and a cauliflower soup. For our 1st course my friend ordered the Bitter Green salad with truffle dressing, quite tasty, but a little to bitter for my taste. Â I on the other hand ordered the Lobster Diavolo with broccoli robe, perfectly cook and the sauce was amazing, it was very flavorful, tomatoes and a bit citrus that balanced off quite well. The broccoli I did not care since it was bitter also, sort of a palate killer! For the 2nd course we had the veal agnolotti, with espresso powder, interesting combination but worked quite well, the agnolotti was very light and full with flavor.For the 3rd course we did the a 2nd pasta of which I can't remember the name, but It was a black pasta with a veal ragout. Same thing very well executed and flavorful.For our 4th and final savory dish, my friend ordered the bass with turnips and small onions and a butter lemon sauce. I ordered the Veal chop, cooked perfectly with a Black truffle a jus, man was this tasty and delicious!!!For the dessert well this was a very well treat!!! Â I ordered the brown butter pana cotta with a crumble and brunoise tomatoes, strange combination, but perfectly worked well, with the sweetness and buttery flavor of the pana cotta and the acidity of the tomato, balanced out delicious, my friend had a 3 flavored ice cream with a brittle, very tasty also.. and then ON THE HOUSE, we got a chocolate cake with pistachio and on the side a olive oil ice cream.. oh and I should also mention on the house they bring you a small box that holds all these bite size mini desserts!!! Â And a glass of Moscato to finish off.. Excellent way to finish off our meal!!!!!!!!!! Â  I haven't talked much about the service! Flawless to top notch!!! Felt very pampered, all staff is well organized and very attentive, they had forgotten by glass of wine until our 3rd course, but I told one of our waiters and they brought me a glass of wine on the house! My Overall experience at del Posto went from great to AMAZING!!!

Just the girls (mom, sis and me). We were seated, in a decent spot in the front of the restaurant. We were asked if we wanted to start with a cocktail, champagne etc. Sis already had a drink from the bar, so mom and I said champagne (it was a celebration after all), well, unbeknownst to us (till the check came) the waiter gave us the most expensive glass on the menu (sis is in the biz and says this is very poor form). Oh well, but it was yummy. We started with the amuse, a small cup of tomato soup (so-so), a lobster sandwich with caviar among other things (pretty good, though the bread was a little to soft imho), and some saurkraut wrapped in proscuitto (this was really interesting, like a fancy hot dog with kraut!)We had our first courses and I enjoyed the abalone (what little there was of it) paired with asparagus and ramps. The veggies were delicious! the next was the first of two pasta courses, the spaghetti with crab, jalapeno and scallions - quite tasty and given the size of the dish, a pretty generous portion of crab. Following the Spaghetti was the Scungilli with Conch, black garlic, lemon and pepper. This came out looking like an asian dish (the sauce was thick and brown, like teriaki) but tasted much more like a meaty gravy sauce on large (very al dente) pasta with small slices of conch, which honestly didn't have much flavor except for being vehicles for the gravy sauce.Our main courses came next, and I ordered the Wood Grilled Lobster. The presentation was great, and the lobster was well cooked, however the sauce on the plate was offensively lemony (think - Baby's first lemon faces) which made it hard to enjoy the rest of the plate, but I managed :P Mom had the duck, which she said was good, and was accompanied by cantaloupe balls that had been rolled in nuts and breadcrumbs (i tried this and it was very good and a neat concept!)We moved on to Dessert where I enjoyed the panna cotta. Mom got the Chocolate torte (which was good but very rich) with olive oil gelato. Now, I know Batali is famous for inventing this olive oil gelato, but something went terribly wrong last night. Both my sister and I, Independent of one another, announced that it tasted like cardboard! Unfortunately, or fortunately, the 2 bottles of wine were starting to get to us, and we mentioned this to the waiter (more out of amusement than criticism)... and he brought my mom some chocolate sorbet on the side (though we said we did not need anything!) Lastly we had the petit fours, served in a neat wooden cheese grater. several choices, all of which I was really too full to eat (but I did anyway :) the most memorable being the champagne caramel wrapped in edible (rice) paper packaging. All in all, it was a nice evening, with decent food and above average service, however for these prices, I would much prefer to dine at Babbo or the Modern, or somewhere a little more interesting...

Â Everything I had was exquisitely presented, with every flavor en pointe and sufficiently nuanced to be consistently interesting and intriguing.I had the tasting menu:Trio of Amuse Bouche: Â Lovely beginning, but I felt the herbal soup had a slightly off-taste. Â It would be the only nit I would find for the remainder of the evening.Bread course: Â I opted for the black olive bread and tried each of the sweet butter from Emilia-Romagna and the butter blended with crudo. Â There was no wrong choice here, as both proved to be very nice choices.Antipasti: Â Goose Liver Palla with Black Figs, Toasted Almonds & Insalata Ruchetta. Â An intriguing presentation. Â The foie gras was served in a sphere dotted on the exterior with the toasted almonds. Â When sliced open, it erupted in a beautiful black sauce that was just perfectly harmonious with the liver. Â The liver was soft and rich and just decadent. Â The arugula was sparsely placed throughout the plate, but it was visually appealing and complemented the other flavors present in the dish. Â The fig was great as well. Â A perfect antipasti. Â My Sicilian Chardonnay paired very well with this.Pasta #1: Â Caramelle di Robiola with Black Truffle Butter. Â Black truffles? Â Enough said. Â This was, of course, just wonderful with the pasta being wonderfully pliant.Pasta #2: Â Handmade Orecchiette with Lamb Neck Sausage, Carrots & Caraway.

Â I make my own pasta by hand, and as a result I can be a pretty tough judge on the professionals, but I could never make this pasta dish. Â The natural sweetness of the carrot puree was exceptional. Â The pasta was so tender and delicious. Â The ragu hit every note perfectly -- very memorable! Â My Umbrian wine, Rosso de Veo, complemented this very well.Secondi: Â Grilled Pork Chop Ode to Emilia-Romagna. Â I was expecting the secondi to be a miss after the exceptional pastas, but I was very pleased with this as well. Â The natural sweetness of the peas, the perfectly cooked pork -- just sublime!Dolci: Â Chocolate Ricotta Tortino with Toasted Sicilian Pistachios & Extra Virgin Olive Oil Gelato. Â I am always surprised by the many ways that ricotta can be used to produce decadent dishes. Â This dessert was no exception. Â Just wonderful!Coffee: Â A regular coffee from Trieste that I chose to drink straight.

661,T50eD_qbv9tZ7bJ8wNQEEg,Sharkus N.,5.0 star rating,"I was a bit apprehensive about Del Posto based on the many, somewhat negative online reviews that I've read. Â But word of mouth from people I know all have raved about the restaurant. We went on New Year's Day and there was plenty of free street parking. Â We parked less than a minute walk away from the restaurant.When we entered we were warmly greeted by the coat check girl and then by the maÃ®tre d'. Â We were seated promptly in a nice corner table for two looking out onto the dining room floor.The layout and dÃ©cor of the restaurant is wonderful. Â Very elegant and well appointment with high ceilings, a second floor balcony and the Christmas decorations were still up - in a elegant, inviting and tasteful manner.Our waitress was friendly, informed and professional - but yet she had a nice casual nature to her - which I appreciated. Â She explained the menu to us in great detail and really made us feel comfortable in understanding our options. Â (There is a seven course menu which is preset - Â we chose the five course menu that allows you to choose your own dishes).The amuse-bouche came out quickly and featured three different items. Â Essentially it consisted of a soup, a sandwich and a dumpling. Â The soup and dumpling were outstanding, the sandwich was OK.For our Antipasti we ordered the Charred Octopus (outstanding) and the Shrimp Fra Diavolo (OK). Â The Shrimp was unexpectedly cold - which was OK, just not expecting that.For our Primi we ordered the Pumpkin Cappellacci (outstanding) and the Orecchiette with Lamb Neck Ragu (good). Â The Cappellacci was so good - very sweet but magnificent flavors. Â The Orecchiette was a bit too strong with the lamb taste at first (and I love lamb). Â But when properly eaten with the carrots, they really tame down the strong lamb flavor.For our Secondi we had the Veal Chop (outstanding) and the Young Piglet (very good). Â The Veal Chop is a $20 supplement, but well worth it. Â The portion size is very good, the flavor and the crispy outside outstanding. Â The Piglet dish consists of four parts - pork chop, pork shoulder, pork meatball and pork belly. Â The portion size was adequate (not small but not a lot). Â I was happy with the dish but not blown away.The desserts were amazing. Â We received the complimentary house desserts along with our Dolce. Â In addition they brought out a complimentary celery gelato for my birthday. Â Celery gelato? Â Yes, it was great. Â We also got the wine pairing with dessert - I HIGHLY recommend it.For wine we ordered a bottle of the Antinori Guado al Tasso Il Bruciato 2008 ($75) and it was very good.

663,M0mRC84DRmFQUqfJBSkrbQ,Alla C.,3.0 star rating,"I wish I could have given this restaurant a better review. The three stars, however, should not reflect poorly upon the food but rather the overall experience, taking price and atmosphere into account as well. Upon arriving to the restaurant, my family and I were seated promptly (there was no wait on an evening weekend), and served a bottle of Prosecco. Since we were not all that hungry, we just ordered items off the menu without bothering with the tasting menu. No prices were listed on the menu other than the five- or seven- course tasting, which was peculiar, but we just went along with it. Of the three dishes we ordered; lamb with lemon and yogurt, oricchette with lamb sausage and soybeans in mint sauce, and gnocchi in a light tomato sauce, nothing stood out as particularly exceptional. Sure, the pasta was cooked perfectly, the sausage was very nicely seasoned, the gnocchi was super light and creamy, and the lamb (albeit a tad on the dry side) was very flavorful, I would have hoped to be impressed with the flavors instead of merely being satisfied that the food was cooked properly.I suppose if I hadn't had such great dining experiences more locally (in Brooklyn and elsewhere in Manhattan), I would have been much more impressed with the food. The service was great, but without exceptional, outstanding food, it is practically worthless. All in all, I never fear spending a lot of money for incredible food, but paying a lot for food that is just ""good"" is rather disappointing, and makes me suspect that the Batali/Bastianich project is pulling off subpar quality because given their name, they can get away with it. That is very unfortunate, and it makes me glad to be a more demanding, more experienced New Yorker. Perhaps if I were trying to impress someone who didn't know anything about Italian food and who hadn't been to New York many times before, I would take them here and watch them ooh and ahh over the decor and attentive waiters, but if I really wanted delicious Italian food, I probably wouldn't come back here again, sad to say.

Â We ordered the tasting menu with a wine pairing. Â Our waiter took some time and asked what kind of food we like. Â We both told him our personal preferences (which are very different) as well as our wine preferences (nothing sweet). Â Our dinners started arriving and we ended up getting about 8 courses of the same exact food. Â I'm not sure why the take the time to ask you about your preferences if they just have a fixed menu..... Â So that wasn't great.On the wine. Â With our appetizers we had Champagne, next we moved to a nice Chardonnay, next we had Rose (noticing a pattern), next we had a pinot, next a darker red and then we ended our meal with a sweet port and then a sweet dessert wine. Â That was really original... I don't know much about wine, but I'm pretty sure I could have put that together. It gets better, one of our courses was lobster. Â Unfortunately it came later in the meal so we had our lobster come out followed by some Cabernet Sauvignon... again, I don't know much about wine but a dark red with Lobster.... Lastly, our last two glasses of wine were sweet. Â After we didn't touch the first glass (and reminded the server we don't like sweet wine) they brought another dessert wine. Â I felt like I was taking crazy pills. Soooo that was great, got to sit in a stuffy restaurant with a bunch of old people to get some food that was just OK and a wine pairing that was laughable.Then the bill came. Â I ended up paying $850.00. Â Eight hundred and fifty dollars. Â I'm still waking up in the middle of the night screaming Del Posto. Â $850.

Â The cucumber avocado and tomato broth amuse bouche were delicious, and the perfect starters to a great meal. Â My bitter herbs salad was dressed perfectly and lightly in a truffle vinaigrette, and the lobster salad was very tender and flavorful. Â The octopus appetizer was great as well, with perfectly charred octopus and marinated garbanzo, and the straciatella was creamy and savory. Â The orechiette with lamb ragu was impeccable with a savory, rich, and creamy sauce topped with buttery bread crumbs. Â The luna piena was very very buttery with just a very faint hint of truffle essence and firm, al dente pasta; I have to admit that I had expected a richer truffle flavor. Â The swordfish secondi was good but a bit too tangy although the fish itself was seared perfectly. Â The burnt beef was cooked to a perfect medium and so tender and flavorful with a great side of charred onions and raisins, which gave it an additional layer of innate seasoning. Â The lobster entree was decent but not amazing, although the portion of meaty lobster was great! Â The veal chop and lamb entrees were definitely the winning dishes, though, with perfectly marinated meat and savory sides (speck and thrice-mashed potatoes? yum!). Â The pork trio was also great, with a savory, rich stew and tender meat.

Â This was the best service I have ever experienced:- I made a mistake on OpenTable and messed up on the date - they quickly accommodated us in a packed restaurant- One of the people in our party spilled something on the table and they responded immediately by cleaning it and putting another table cloth over the spill- The first pouring of wine was a tableside production Â - The eagle eye bus boy spotted that I touched the rib eye bone and got me an unsolicited wet napkin with a lemon/sprig of rosemary- The piano in the background made it a soothing classy experience- They had someone stationed outside of the restaurant to hail a cab for you (like a hotel)We went with the 7 course meal with supplements (our main waiter called it ""The Captain""). Â The trio of amuse bouches was a nice touch: risotto bites, a shot that resembled a short rib broth, and another delicious undistinguishable bite.

679,axz70giIENWIacRXr-811A,Cecilia Z.,5.0 star rating,"I was absolutely blown away by my most recent prix-fixe lunch experience at Del Posto. I trekked down here on a rainy Friday afternoon at 12:30 with the bf, after securing an appointment almost three weeks in advance (it seems like they really book up fast, especially for lunch) with high hopes and expectations. The first thing I noticed upon entering the tall double-doors and checking our coats was the grandiosity and class of the bi-level dining room. The hostess quickly led us to our table right after we checked in, from which point the maitre d' took over in serving us. Let me just say, the service was impeccable from beginning to end: from the waiter who brought over a cute little stool for my purse (yes, my Louis V needs a seat too apparently), to the busboys who constantly refilled our water glasses and cleared our plates immediately after we finished each course, and the maitre d' who explained the composition and ingredients Â of every plate in detail as each course arrived. Words truly cannot even explain the level of service we received; it was by far the best high-dining experience I have had to date.Now on to the food:We were served 3 different amuses: a whipped mortadella stuffed puff pastry, a shot of stratecceli soup and crispy risotto balls. I found the soup to be the best out of the three, packing a ton of robust flavor into just a single shot serving. The broth was rich and beefy, although I could imagine it'd be a bit too salty in a larger portion.The bread basket definitely lived up to all the praises, all hot and freshly made in-house. We were given two of each three different breads: a mini baguette, rosemary and olive oil focaccia, and ciabatta rolls studded with olives. The butter and rosemary infused lardo spreads were both perfectly tempered, although I personally preferred the butter over the lardo. Although the lardo was much more delicate than I had expected, something about putting just pork fat on my baguette does not sing to me.For appetizers, I went with the roasted winter vegetables while the bf ordered the zampone. Never have I ever had vegetables of this caliber (and I was a vegetarian for almost 7 years). There were an enormous variety of different vegetables and fruits on the plate, some roasted, some raw that created the perfect balance of sweet and savory with added crunch of raw sprouts and lettuces. I especially loved the roasted baby beets, butternut squash, parsnips, carrots, onions and beautifully caramelized apples and bartlett pears. The vegetables sat on few smears of what seemed to be a delicate, mayonnaise-like aioli and studded with hazelnuts. The bf's zampone (cotecchino stuffed in pig's trotter) was served tableside, which added some fancy flair to the whole presentation. The zampone itself was served over a bed of lentils dressed in a very zesty and tangy salsa verde, which added some needed acid to the rich porkiness. It was actually the bf's first time ever trying a pig's trotter, as he isn't normally receptive to offal. But hey, Del Posto is probably the place to try even the most questionable animal parts. For entrees, we were allowed to order either a primi (pasta course) or a secondi (meatier entrees). I ordered the wild striped bass served with a tender radicchio salad, bagna caoda (a rich puree made with anchovies) and a campari reduction. The fish was beautifully cooked and subtle in flavor, while the anchovy sauce added more fishiness and umami to the dish when eaten altogether. Even though I actually find the bitterness of radicchio awesome, the radicchio served in this dish were actually very tender and sweet, which balanced the richness of the fish perfectly. The campari reduction was very acidic and tangy, which also helped offset the richness of the dish. Overall I thought the bass dish was well composed and thought-out, and the portion was actually much more generous than many other michelin-star restaurants. The bf opted for the grilled pork which was finished table-side once again (lucky him). The grilled pork was topped with crispy pancetta, and served with a sunchoke crema and aceto conserva. He really enjoyed the flavors, noting that the crispy pancetta really made the dish. Too bad I didn't get to try any of the pork.For desserts: I ordered the chocolate ricotta tortino and he got the butterscotch semifreddo. Besides the beautiful presentation of both desserts, the flavors were also marvelous. My tortino consisted of beautifully dark chocolate and delicate, creamy ricotta that was rich in flavor yet light in texture. The olive oil ice cream that came on the side sitting on some chocolate dust crumbs was delightful as well, with just a tiny drizzle of extra virgin olive oil on top. The bf absolutely loved his semifreddo, as he quickly devoured it despite being pretty full from all the previous courses. We were also served complimentary petite fours even after our dessert courses.Wow. Just WOW.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

To begin with, the service was impeccable, and what you hope for in a great restaurant. Everyone was attentive and the small touches were nice. For example, when I left to the ladies' room, my plate was covered and my silverware replaced. We started with a drink at the bar, and we both had really amazing gin drinks: mine a little sweet, his not so much.I'm still craving the lobster and cavier sandwiches that were part of the amuse bouche. The other parts were good, but nothing spectacular. For the antipasti, I ordered the Abalone Carpaccio with aspargus and young ramps, which I would highly recommend ordering. The Abalone was melt in your mouth and everything went really well together. My boyfriend got the raw veal and tuna cubetti, which we recommend mixing together with all of the elements in the dish before tasting.Then we ordered the Spaghetti with Crab (which had the perfect amount of spiciness - highly recommended), the agnolotti and another stuffed pasta. The others were very good, but the crab spaghetti was by far the standout. (We ended up getting 3 pastas, because our order was messed up - which was a happy mistake for me!)Finally, for the secondi course, I ordered the young lamb which had a nice tart yogurt and squeezed grilled lemon all over it. Well executed. My boyfriend had the beef rib eye which was perfectly cooked, it was juicy and pink and tasted amazing. Then dessert came - the celery dish was very good - along with a box of smaller desserts.By the end of the meal, I was completely and utterly stuffed and satiated.

Â Both are owned by celebrity chefs and both have Michelin ratings.With that said, I decided to take some very important clients here for a Wednesday night dinner. Â I had heard it takes an act of Congress (or an act of God) to get a reservation here and that is correct. Â The best I could do was 6pm. Â A little early, but at least I got in. Â So if you want a ressie in a hot time slot, say 7-9pm, you'd better think WAY ahead. Â The space itself is pretty impressive. Â Open, airy, and spectacularly modern. Â Very classy. Â Probably the only thing I didn't like about the space were the unisex European WC-style bathrooms. Â I know this is an Italian joint, but we're not in Italy. Â Split them up.I was allowed to hang out in the bar until my friends arrived. Â Upon which we were seated at a table for 4 in a quiet corner. Â Very nice. Â We were presented with our menus and thoroughly explained the specials. Â We decided on the 5-course dinner menu. Â We were then informed that it is TRUFFLE SEASON. Â Oh yeah. Â Too reel you in they even bring out a tray of them for you to smell. Â It worked. Â I ordered them for our pasta dishes. Â Man did it add an exquisite touch. Â Absolutely delicious. Â And for $45 per gram, they better be.The lobster risotto and the crab spaghetti were wonderful. Â Especially with the truffle. Â I had the grilled beef for my secondi which paired nicely with the bottle of Parusso Barolo. Â By the way, the wine list here is MASSIVE. Â If you can't find a bottle here, then you should just be drinking water. Â Finally, for dessert, I had the chocolate tortino. Â The roasted pistachios and olive oil gelato really made it quite delectable.All in all, this is one of the best meals I've ever had in NYC. Â I would even say the cuisine here slightly beats out Le Bernardin. Â However, the service at Le Bernardin was far better. Â The servers and sommeliers there are second to none in terms of knowledge, technique, and personability. Â I found our waiter at Del Posto to be a bit slow and condescending. Â Almost like I was too young (or maybe not wealthy enough) to enjoy such a fine dining experience. Â Oh well, I bet he changed his mind after he saw his tip.All in all, a fantastic dining experience. Â I will, most definitely, be going back to Del Posto.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

687,mmf-KP1c96i2eBm0cPuOXQ,Vivian L.,4.0 star rating,"My real rating is 4.5 stars =). Came here for my friend's birthday dinner. We sat in the Enoteca (which is an area in the front of the restaurant when you come in) and had the 5-course menu for $52, which I thought was a great deal!First to come out was the bread. Fresh and piping hot, w/ 5 different varieties of bread and served with lardo and sweet butter. Great start to the meal. Our appetizers came out almost immediately after the bread. I had the calamari, which was delicious but it came on such a huge platter that I couldn't finish it all! Our theory was that they give large portions of the appetizer to compensate for smaller portions of the pasta you get later on =P. For the pasta you pick two types that the whole table shares. We had the orecchiette al sugo di agnello (a lamb-based meat sauce) and the garganelli (spinach pasta similar in shape to penne) al ragu bolognese. I found both to be quite good, very flavorful and the texture of the pasta was perfect, soft with just a little bite to it. Of the two, I probably liked the orecchiette just a little better. Next I had the arctic char which was tender and tasty, but I wasn't a fan of the vegetables it came with. They tasted like they had been soaked in liquor of some sort, and I didn't really feel like eating alcoholic vegetables, but the fish itself was great, and perfectly flaky. For dessert (I was full to bursting by this point), I had the chocolate torte which comes with a small scoop of gelato. It was good but nothing special. Tasty but the cake was a little dry, not the highlight of the meal. Overall, great and attentive service (our waiter was so smiley and happy and they were constantly refilling our water and changing our silverware), great ambience (very fancy and elegant interior), and tasty food. At the reasonable prices in the Enoteca, definitely more than worth the money!",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Make sure you are super happy and not afraid to let go of some $. Upon leaving, your belt will be bursting but your wallet will be empty.My boyfriend and I went here on a whim two months back. We made a reservation two hours before. You have to put in your credit card number to reserve, and if you cancel within 24 hours, you get charged $50 per person. They mean business, so no fooling around on your part. No matter how you look at it, you'll lose dinero.Anyway, my boyfriend and I made our reservation and arrived a bit early. We were seated at the bar while we waited for our table, ordered some drinks and ate some bar snacks.When our table was ready, we were promptly escorted. We got the five course tasting menu, ""il menÃº del posto,"" for $115 per person. There is no a la carte menu. Prix fixes only.All our food was extremely exceptional. You choose one appetizer, two pastas, one secondo, and a dessert. Numerous amuse bouches and free dessert wine came along with it as well. My boyfriend was running out of wine when finishing his secondo, and they came over to refill him to ""finish it off"" even though we just ordered by the glass. Despite all of this, my boyfriend and I had a serious fixation with the pig lardo, one of the condiments for the bread. It was so friggin good. The thought of something being called lardo kinda makes me cringe, but it was so smokey and prosciutto like, and you spread it all across your bread. Ugh, I want some now ....(don't eat too much bread with all this wonderful food, but please, give the lardo a chance ...it's less calories and cholesterol than the butter; I kid you not, that's what the waiter told me).Numerous people wait on you hand and foot here. Some people like it, some people don't. I didn't think it was too much - they were very friendly. I wouldn't expect anything less when paying $300 for a dinner, though.I particularly love the box of dessert amuse bouches and the candies in the edible wrappers. So fun.

The waitstaff was polite, attentive, and accommodating for our specific needs: dining with a six-year-old and a vegetarian. Of the three Antipasti dishes at the table, the Herbs & Lettuces was the premiere attraction because of the Del Posto Truffled Dressing. The intoxicating aroma of the truffles permitted from the moment that the plate hit the table. It bitterness of the greens was well-balanced with the dressing but the greens should have been torn into more manageable pieces. I ordered the Pumpkin Cappellacci which was very nicely complimented with a surprisingly light Brown Butter sauce. But my heart was won over by the fe bites of the Chestnut Ravioli that I tasted. The Black Truffle Butter paired with Porcini and Marsala was phenomenal. The Pecorino Romano Cake was exquisitely presented with a whimsical flare and the toasted candied coconut clusters topping the Grilled Semolina Cake made for a fun way to wrap up this exceptional dining experience. Del Posto is a must-try for your next high-end dining excursion.

696,xq99_fU3bEI7xQuC7vL5Ug,Pam Z.,5.0 star rating,"Went to Del Posto for lunch the other day, per a chef friend's recommendation. Â Although the website says the fixed price lunch is $39, it is actually only $29. Â $29 was dirt cheap for what we got.You get an antipasti, the choice between a primi and a segundi (or both if you pay $11 more), and a dolci. Â The menu is quite extensive and the options are a nice mix of traditional Italian fare and unique, avante garde ingredients and techniques. Â Of course, nothing on the menu was in English and thus made no sense, but the waiter did an excellent job of explaining the food to us.I got the Vitello Tonnato antipasti, which was a dish with chilled veal medallions. Â Although I was not sure I'd like cold veal, it was amazing. Â The texture was very interesting and it really tasted like nothing I've had before.For the next course, I got the Cacciucco segundi. Â If you like seafood, I could not recommend this more highly. Â It was basically a seafood stew served in rich, creamy broth that was a mix of lobster bisque and the juice that comes out of shrimp head. Â It tasted like pure, delicious cholesterol. Â The portion size was enormous and the seafood selection included several large pieces of lobster, shrimp, razor clams, mussels, and squid.For the dolci, I ordered the Melanzane which was in essence a 3-layered chocolate cake (top and bottom layers are a rich, moist chocolate and the middle later is ricotta). Â The outside of the cake was covered in crushed pistachio and it was served with a delicious olive oil gelato. Â This was the perfect end to a truly perfect meal. Â I highly recommend this dessert option... Â my friends definitely looked envious.To top it off, we were also served two platters of amuse-bouche. Â Each platter had 4 different things for us to try. Â The dessert amuse-bouche was the best... Â who doesn't like a cream donut, truffled fudge, or ice cream on a stick (yes, we got that).The service was excellent and the food was beyond excellent. Â Of course, the atmosphere was stuffy, but who cares when you're eating the most amazing food for $29. Â I still can't believe that's how much I paid.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Nothing was bad but nothing was particularly outstanding. Even the bread basket was boring. For the price we were paying - $115 each for the prix fixe plus drinks - we expected a much better meal.

Â Yes, you read that right: Â 3 courses for $29. Â Recession pricing? Â Sign me up! Â I was a little wary when reading the reviews as my fellow yelpers have dished Batali some heavy hate mail. Â But with a price tag of under $30, what did I really have to lose?I arrived a few minutes early for our 1:30 time slot to find a half-empty cavern of a room. Â The decor is elegant and stately; large club chairs, a grand balcony area, live pianist. Â I'll admit that my mind flashed to Nordstrom (judge me if you like--I'm a Nordstrom gal till the day I die). Â Where were all the power lunchers? Â Are there no megadeals being made on January 3rd???The staff was attentive, as they should be since the restaurant was so empty. Â I was taken to the table to wait for my two lunchmates and--get this--was provided an ottoman for my purse. Â That detail felt a bit cheesy, but whatever; I won't complain if Batali wants to spring for a fleet of footstools for my last season Coach bag. Â Ha.Anyway, to the menu. Â Because that was what I came here for, right? Â There's three ways to do lunch at DP: Â a $75 six-course tasting option; the aforementioned three-course deal; and a la carte. Â I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to see the obvious choice here. Â Who really needs SIX courses at lunch anyway?To start we were presented with three amuses: Â Stracciatella (italian egg drop soup) with matcha-rimmed cup, saffron suppli (fried risotto) with edible gold leaf dust, and mortadella mousse in pastry. Â Next, a bread basket of focaccia with thyme, mini olive loafs, and baguettes served with salted butter and pork lardo. Â The pork lardo was lighter than expected and the strong flavors of the olive and focaccia overpowered the subtle pork flavor. Â By this point we were already feeling less-than starving, and we hadn't even received our appetizers yet! Â If you can manage to do a few laps up and down the cathedral staircase without being escorted out of the restaurant, I would recommend it at this point in the meal. Â I wasn't feeling nearly that confident. Â But I digress...For the appetizer course, two of us opted for the spicy chilled lobster salad for a $10 upcharge. Â The third in our group had the winter vegetable salad, which I also tasted. Â The lobster is wonderful, really, but too heavy for a lunch appetizer in my opinion. Â The one exception is if you heed my earlier advice about getting some mid-meal cardio, congrats, the lobster is for you. Â Otherwise I would highly recommend the winter vegetables, which was a beautifully-presented garden of root vegetables, brussel sprouts, hazelnuts, and a cream sauce finish which (despite the name) was absolutely light and divine. Â On to entrees. Â All three of us selected from the Secondi menu. Â I was torn between the garganelli pasta and the arctic char; in the end the fish won out. Â I was proud of my choice when I was presented with a generous filet of very-flavorful fish, served with black truffles, roasted chestnuts, and watercress. Â With an ingredient list that reads like a spice cabinet of flavor, I was expecting a power punch of taste. Â Surprisingly, the result was anything but bland but still managed to be light, not the least bit overbearing. Â At first bite I was underwhelmed, but by the end I was glad for the lightness of the flavor--it was lunch after all, and we still had dessert coming.[Honorable mention goes to my friend's duck; where my dish stayed light and seemed to hold back in flavor, the duck was the hearty and full-bodied.]Next was dessert: Â I had the tartufo caffe, a chocolate-meets-coffee-meets-candied lemon delight that I could barely touch, it was so rich (and I was so full!). Â My friend's chocolate-pistachio tortino with Batali's olive oil gelato, of Otto fame. Â There's a reason that gelato is famous--its a show-stopper. Â Don't miss that one.Full yet? Â But wait, there's more! Â An assortment of gratis sweets served on top of--and inside!--a cheese grater. Â The cute if unusual presentation revealed six rounds of nibbles--candied grapefruit, chocolate truffles, olive oil lollipops, and sugared donuts among them--after which it was all I could do to peel myself out of my seat. Â Whew! Final thought before I succumb to food coma: Â DP's prix fixe lunch is one of the best deals in the city. Â The entire marathon lunch was just $29, plus $10 for the lobster salad (sadly the least impressive dish I ordered). Â Hate on Del Posto all you want, but I've spent more on pizza and wings.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
706,nNGcvU7eY773pgAWSHsujA,Ken M.,3.0 star rating,"I did not want to give this restaurant a 3 star review, unfortunately I feel compelled to be honest. Â Mario Batali is a charming TV personality and I really wanted to give his restaurant a good review, especially since it only recently got its fourth NY times star.The restaurant decor is quite nice, and the service was quite good. Â The service at Daniel was better but it was still very good. Â Everyone was attentive and polite, the only problem is that they are polite and formal almost to a fault. Â Professionalism is one thing, being a robot with absolutely zero character is another. Â However, the service was four star at worst, and not the reason for the 3 star review.Another point for service is that they called me several times to confirm my reservation, which was a pain and I informed the last person who called me of this fact. Â They apologized for their mistake (not acknowledging the first two confirmations) and actually sat us at a prime table to make up for it. Â Quite exemplary on the part of the staff.Now Â the food.Now, this all has to be taken in context, but when I pay $115 per person for a five course without wine there are certain expectations as to the quality of the food. Â And, to my disappointment, these expectations were not met.The amouse bouche where nice, no complaints.The anitpasti, I had the abalone carpacio, my gf had some riccotto salad (which I did not taste). Â The abalone was nice, however, the dish had too much asparagus and not enough abalone, making it taste like an asparagus dish, not an abalone dish. Â Not bad, but not quite so good.Primi: Â a raviolli with black truffle butter. Â Very good, the best savory dish all night. Â No complaints by either me or gf.Primi II: Â wheat pasta with a spicy chick pea sauce. Â Quite good actually, I enjoyed it, she did not so much. Â At this point i'm leaning towards 4 stars.Now, the bad part.Secondi: Â I ordered the lamb dish. Â It came in three pieces, two loin like cuts and one frenched. Â One of the loin cuts was pure fat and, quite frankly, was disgusting. Â The entire dish was over salted, leaving me with that sodium taste in the back of my throat when I was done. Â The accouterments where also lacking. Â A 3 dish, and that's being generous.My gf had the lobster. Â It was terrible. Â It was like eating rubber. Â The lobster was so overdone I almost couldn't cut through it with my knife. Â Plus, the artichokes and sauce just did not do it credit. Â Failure of both imagination and execution, just a terrible dish. Â I've had (much) better lobster at random lobster huts up in Boston, California, Hawaii, NY, you name it, I've had a better piece of lobster. Â I bet I could have had better lobster in S. Dakota (okay, that may be stretching, but the point I think is made).Saving Grace: Â Dessert.The dessert was amazing, simply amazing. Â With savory dishes so ""meh"" to ""gah!"" I was not anticipating the pure excellence of the desert dishes. Â I had the chocolate tort, she had the special, some pea cake with strawberry sorbet something or another. Â Plus, they gave us a complimentary sampler platter which, once again, goes to the excellence of the service. Â All of the samplers where remarkable, especially the weird olive oil ice cream lollipop. Â So good.If the chef de jour was as good as the pastry chef I would easily give this a 5 of 5. Â Unfortunately, such was not the case. I was pondering whether to give three or four, but savory food has to win out over dessert or service, and I had to give a three.

Â We tried the 5 course tasting menu which we shared and below were the dishes we selected.Lobster Fra Diavolo w. Garlic Bread Panna CottaApician Spiced OstrichSpaghetti w. Dungeness crab, Sliced Jalapenos, and scallionsVeal Agnolotti w. Tyrolean Speck, Grana Padano & Truffle DustSardinian Lamb w. Roman Artichokes, Bruised Mint, and Saffron PotatoesBurnt Beef w. Creamed Potato Torta, Spinach Palla & Calabrian Spicy TongueButterscotch Semifreddo w. melon Agrumata and crumbled sbrisolonaTorta di Zucca w. Candied pumpkin, sage gelato and brown butterThe meal started w. an amuse bouche trio of risotto balls, baccala, and some bean stew. Â We started w. the lobster fra diavolo and this dish was surprising because of the cold element. Â Besides the lobster being a bit undercooked, I was expecting the dish to be served hot but the chilled element threw me off. Â The garlic bread panna cotta was an interesting touch to the dish. Â The next antipasti of Apician Spiced Ostrich was ok. Â This dish included ostrich pate. ostrich carpaccio, and a date gelee. Â The carpaccio was very gamey and the pate was not as smooth as I would like. Â Next, came our pasta courses and we shared the spaghetti w. dungeness crab. Â This was a very simple dish and thats about it. Â The 2nd pasta was prob my favorite dish of the night. Â The veal agnolotti was tasty and loved the smokiness from the speck. Â The black truffles and the grana padano broth was a wonderful aspect to the dish. Â My one complaint is that cheese and truffle conflicts w. each other especially the sharpness from grana padano.The final savory course was the Sardinian Lamb and the Burnt Beef. Â The beef was better than the lamb because the lamb was way overcooked for my liking. Â The burnt beef was flavorful and perfectly cooked but the dish was not appealing. Â Besides the creamy color of the potato torta that accompanied the dish, everything else on the plate was black. Â Overall, I think this part of the tasting was the most disappointing.Dessert was the final course and I really liked the Butterscotch semifreddo as the torta di Zucca was a bit dry for me. Â However, the sage gelato that accompanied the torta was the best element on that dish. Â All in all, a good end to the night.Honestly, the food was really 3.5 stars but the service and ambiance made it a solid 4 overall.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Their portions were also smaller than expected. First time I have left not super full from restaurant week. The appetizer was great with three different types of italian cold cuts that went wonderfully with an arrangement of 4 different types of bread. The actual bruschetta was not that great and consisted of blended tomatoes instead of chucks which I prefer. Entree was pork which was very tender but a more fatty cut and did not have much flavor. Dessert was the berry and cheese tort which was tasty and fresh. It was better than the chocolate torte which was kind of dry and thats what I hate most...dry chocolate cake. Boo!

All of the options seem to be variations on some fried piece of meat or fish with a starch, but each is SO good. I would have gladly have a meal consisting purely of the crab balls. For dinner, I had the lobster salad, pumpkin ravioli, black bass and tiramisu. The pumpkin ravioli was everyone at my table's favorite, followed closely by the veal chop (I didn't order this unfortunately). The breads they offer throughout are also delicious - especially the one with olives.Servers here are obviously well-trained, but can be a bit snooty at times (not unexpected given, well, everything). If you're dropping major dough on a holiday party, you shouldn't be rudely interrupted unless there's a monsoon outside, and they expressed frustration more than once over the delay of our party's departure (think the restaurant was supposed to close at 10:30, and we hadn't cleared out until after 11).We also elected to grab drinks at the bar afterward. Not surprisingly, they were comically overpriced.

This is pretty good though, so I have decided to give them the full 5 stars...hook them up with the 1 extra star that they lost from the Michelin ratings!This place is out of the way on 10th ave, but boy when you walk in...it's like a freaking palace. My friend and I showed up early, and we were the 1st ones in our party of 8. After we dropped off our coats in the coat check, we decided to sit at the bar. I ordered a dirty grey goose martini. The bartender was an awesome mixologist. The ratio of olive juice, to grey goose, to vermouth was perfect. It tasted so clean and refreshing; it was probably one of the best tasting vodka martinis i had ever. The only negative was the 1 big olive that STILL had its pit. I would have appreciated a pitted olive. Oh well. When the rest of the party arrived the hostess promptly seated us. We were whisked up the marble staircase that was lighted by candles. They layout of the restaurant was extravagant and beautiful. I felt like i was a part of royalty dining here. We had a crew of servers waiting us. The main guy was very amiable and funny. He was a great waiter who was very informative of the dishes. We started off with some complimentary soup shooters, a pate sandwich, and a fried risotto ball. They also gave us bread with sweet butter spread and LARDO spread. OMG THE LARDO WAS TO DIE FOR!!! It was so good that i wanted to take extra home for myself. Since we were a group of 8, we had to participate in a prix fixe, which we did with the 5 course tasting menu. For my 1st course, i had the VONGOLE Marinate with Fried Roman Artichokes & Minted Farro Dressing. The vongole clams were minced up and was very flavorful. The fried artichokes were crispy and good although one of my pieces was probably too overcooked where it just tasted like burnt paper. Â For the 2nd course, we ordered the SPAGHETTI with Dungeness Crab, Sliced Jalapeno & Minced Scallion. OMG this was the best dish all night. The spaghetti was cooked a perfect al dente. The dungeness crab was sweet and succulent. The sauce that came iwth the sliced jalapeno was spicy and flavorful and complemented the crab and pasta perfectly. I could have eaten everyone's portion of this because it was that good. For the 3rd course, we asked the waiter for a recommendation, and he told us to order the GARGANELLI Verdi al Ragu Bolognese . Besides the spaghetti, he says that this was the 2nd most popular pasta dish. I could tell why. It wasn't as good as the spaghetti but it was still delicious. The pasta was cooked a little bit more thoroughly than al dente. The green pasta, which reminded me of penne ( i think it was spinach pasta) absorbed the bolognese meat sauce very well. I devoured this dish as well. For the main course, i shared a BEEF Ribeye for 2 with Young Arugula & Eggplant Parmigiano Torta (30 supp) with a friend. I ordered it medium rare adn it came out pretty much medium rare/medium. I heard rave reviews about this steak and albeit it was good, i dont think it was as good as traditional steakhouses like del frisco's. I guess it got overhyped. The steak was good; it was seasoned nicely, but it was nothing special. There was no wow factor. I actually preferred the eggplant parmigiana over the steak. For dessert, i ordered the Butterscotch SEMIFREDDO, Preserved Melon Agrumata, Crumbled Sbrisolona & Milk Jam. This was light and refreshing. It wasn't too heavy so it was a good ending to the 5 course meal.The staff were great. They were cleaning our area, refilling our water and wine at a great rate. Everyone was very helpful. This place gets 6 stars for service. 4.5 for the food, and 5 Â for the ambiance. The only negative thing thing i have to say about this place is when we paid a $1300 bill, one of the waiters came back and complained that we only paid $600. We were shocked, so we took the money and counted it in front of him. Unfortunately for him that he miscounted because we showed him that we actually did pay the right amount.

Batali is so talented that he has EARNED the right to rock those orange rubber shoes while cruising the city on his Vespa. The atmosphere likens itself to one of those places where bankers came to make deals during the Glory Days of Wall Street. Trendy Casa Mono, this is not. The clientele was also MUCH older - we were definitely the youngest people dining by about 20 years or so. Picasso said ""It takes a long time to become young."" This was not going to be the night for celebrating youth, we were putting on the facade of adults. The waiter brought me a little purse table, which is probably nicer than any of the Ikea furniture I have at home. We were brought out a three part amuse bouche and colossal bread basket to start. As a carb-loving female, the bread basket appealed to me much more than the gazpacho or salmon sandwich. The olive oil focaccia was the best of the lot. Our first course was a five-part antipasto. The seafood mixture and prosciutto were the best, but there was also a lightly dressed salad, red wine marinated artichokes, and what was basically glorified chicken salad. It was neat to watch our waiter dole out each taste on the cart in front of us. Our next course was a caprese and tuna. The cheese was an interesting hybrid with the texture of ricotta but the taste of mozzarella. It was good, but not outstanding. The two pasta courses, however, made me decide that if I got hit by a bus or taxi leaving Del Posto that night, it would be okay because I ate the most heavenly pastas ever made. The first was a tubular pasta, that came with black truffle sauce and Parmesan cheese along the edge to dip. The pasta was some of the freshest I have ever tasted - like it came right from being prepared to my plate. Have you ever dreamed of eating with your hands at a Michelin rated restaurant? Guess what, it was ENCOURAGED for this dish. Â It was like we were allowed to be young for just one course, before behaving like adults at dinner once again...The 100 layer lasagna was served at room temperature, and it was still incredible. Ulta-thin layers of pasta with a ragu based sauce - my dining companion asked why I was eating so slowly and I told him (half kidding) that I wanted to count the layers. The young red wine paired with the lasagna was like velvet on the tongue. (I wanted to speak with the sommelier to ask a few questions about this wine, but it was very difficult to get a hold of her for most of the evening.) The final ""dinner"" course was veal in ash, osso buco vinaigrette, with polenta. The veal was not as tender as one might expect. The barolo that was paired with the veal was incredible. The first part of dessert was a small pineapple panna cotta. It was a good summer interpretation of a typical Italian dessert. Next, came a tartlet made with eggplant, ricotta ice cream, drizzled with chocolate. Eggplant for dessert? It worked! It was paired with a valpolicella, which had the consistency of a port (surprising for me!). The petit fours were so quirky and kitsch for such a ""conservative"" place. Firstly, they came in a box, with a drawer and cheese grater on top. (I wish I took my big purse to take it home with me.) Olive oil ice cream lollipops - yes. Little orange candies with EDIBLE wrappers - yes. Yummy little cinnamon dusted zeppole - mmm. After fainting at glimpsing at the check, we decided to venture to the wine cellar. Wines are segmented by rooms and there are multiple rooms. This is definitely a good area for a photo-op - it is very impressive. Please add ""obtaining a Barolo room"" to my bucket list. The maitre'd gave us little boxes of chocolates on our way out of the restaurant.

Food and Wine.The $35 glass of Barolo I had was not as good as the $15 glass of Nero at nearby Anfora; nor was it as good as the $42 bottle of 2009 Sinskey I got at Vino on 27th Street. Maybe it's a rare wine or something but the finish was fine, just not GREAT. I expect GREAT from Del Posto and GREAT from Batali. This is NYC, not Cleveland.The service was nice but a little overly attentive. It is really annoying to have a man push your chair in behind you. Leave me alone, dude.The amuse bouches were completely forgettable. One was like my grandma's chicken salad sandwich but not as good. One was a flavorless piece of cod between two potato chips. And one was a boring cauliflower soup.I got a pasta. It was squid and other seafood in a spicy marinara sauce. Very good, just not spectacular. I suppose you guys deserve 4 stars, but since you SHOULD be 5 stars, I gave you three, because my expectations were dashed. And also, your price point is not reflected in the flavors.I always tell my friends they are wasting their money on Broadway shows when they come to town... they should go to our great restaurants and be assured of being dazzled, at Daniel, Per Se, Chanterelle... etc. Â Del Posto, guess what? You are now OFF that list.The best part of the meal was the freebie desserts at the end. Â Mainly because there was a fresh doughnut (though the beguines at ROBERT at MAD are WAY better)... and a little candy grapefruit thing....I can't speak for anyone else, I didn't order anything else so maybe I got the wrong thing.

DÃ©cor: The dining room is majestic and very big, like 2 floors big and it gives off an ivy-league club feel to it. The moment you walk in, you realize you are in a serious place: lots of mahogany and maroon velvet all around, dim lighting, soft piano music and extremely courteous staff. Food: We each had the 5 course tasting menu and this is where the restaurant lacked. I started with the Fresh Fried CALAMARI with Spicy Capers and it was good, not great but good. While my tablemates had Lobster SALAD Fra Diavola with Broccoli Rabe & Dried Orange, and VONGOLE Marinate with Fried Roman Artichokes & Minted Farro Dressing. They both seemed to like their choices. Â For the second and third course the entire table had the SPAGHETTI with Dungeness Crab, Sliced Jalapeno & Minced Scallion, and the Potato GNOCCHI Con Pomodoro. This is where the food started getting unimpressive. The spaghetti was very ordinary and the Gnocchi was plain and the portion was miniscule, literally there were 7 pieces of Gnocchi on our plate. Â For the final course I had the Dover SOLE with Chestnuts, Watercress, Black Truffles & Trumpets. The Sole (white fish) was tender but nothing to write home about. While my girlfriend had the Wood-Grilled LOBSTER with Artichokes, Almonds & Basils. She liked the lobster but did not finish her dish. My dad had the Slow Baked LAMB alla Puttanesca & Garlic Tatsoi and he was not impressed with the lamb neither and did not finish the dish. Overall, the food was way overpriced for what was served.

753,NiploVdHoZSyZFADNpM6UA,Avion T.,3.0 star rating,"!!!!!!!!DISCLAIMER!!!!!!!!!: This review is unlike any other review I've ever done because I have to admit that my hindsight perception of Del Posto was tainted by my own hypercritical analysis due to reading countless . . COUNTLESS Yelp reviews about Del Posto in preparation of my 6th Anniversary / surprise marriage proposal restaurant! . . (this place is worth another star in my opinion)MY REVIEW: 3 stars. I thought for sure that I'd be amazed. Blown away. If not by the food then at least by the presentation of grandeur & impeccable service that I read so much about. Maybe I read wayyy too many Del Posto reviews & it set them up to inevitably fail. Maybe I was grading them in real time a bit too much. Perhaps. However minus a few noticeable glitches that I managed to block out, my girlfriend & I had a very memorable anniversary & everything was overall very good! Â THE SERVICE: The restaurant's vibe gives you a feeling that you've been wisked away to a classier time where men were men & ladies crossed their legs with chastity in their hearts. However, I have concluded that either I am not one for fine dining or the few places I've patronized employ a dry, bland & colorless execution of service. Are there points where I was mildly impressed? . . Yes. Are they more attentive than the average restaurant? . . Yes. Did the service flow well? . . At times it really did especially since the wait time for dishes was the best I've ever experienced! Were there also points where I could cut the non-amiably corpse-like lifelessness with a butter knife? . . HELL YEAH! It's like the hiring criteria consists of not having a soul & that's just not my style. I like real people . . not just classy & well dressed but real. Furthermore, at the table adjacent to us they were discussing a multi-million dollar deal negotiation & our waiter ended up never coming back to our table for whatever reason. In fact I was amazed at their level of service in comparison as I couldn't help but notice. It was a little more synchronized, harmonious & pampering. Do I get it? . . Yeah I get it bro, I'm not rich. But damn . . I just shook my head. MY SYNOPSIS OF THE FOOD: We ordered from the 5 course menu & how was it? . . Good. At seldom points it was borderline great but nothing completely blew me away although I did fall in love with the bread JESUS CHRIST! The amuse bouches were darn good. The tomato salad & charred octopus appetizers were pretty tasty. I was thoroughly disappointed with the 100 layer lasagna which tasted like Chef Boyardee (I swear to you!) & the Garganelli pasta which was much better, had a very similar looking & tasting bolognese sauce minus that red Chef Boyardee puree from the lasagna, so it was almost a waste in ordering it BUT at least the waiter warned me of this. However still, having two pastas with the same bolognese sauce is much uninspired & lax of them. I know great hole in the wall spots that don't do that much less a Michelin rated restaurant! Our main dishes were the pork trio & the veal chop. Both dishes were good but not great however I expected this. For dessert we ordered the carrot cake with sage gelato & the chocolate ricotta cake with olive oil gelato. The gelato's were very good & slightly complex in flavor composition especially the sage gelato but the cakes were . . blahhhh ok. MY DISDAIN: Where's our cheese grater laden with assorted complimentary desserts that I heard so much about?!?!?!? Where's my free chocolate truffles or some other form of parting dessert waiting for me at the coat check!??!?!? Not to mention, even mid-level restaurants give complimentary glasses of wine or champagne for events like birthdays & anniversaries!!! I dont even wanna think of why we were cheated of these amenities especially since Ive seen reviews from people that received everything I was cheated out of & they only ordered the $29 pre-fixe lunch!!! Luckily . . I know how to separate my discernment of the food & service from the unsavory aspect of feeling cheated & still give a real & fair assessment of the restaurant. I say go there!!! . . Definitely try it. It's a gorgeous place. Just don't read too many reviews about it because honestly had I not read up on this place for months, I might've given it a 4.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

A modestly priced 'fancy' lunch that was perfect to celebrate Mother's Day early with my mama!I was surprised that instead of being packed with ladies who lunch, Del Posto was packed with tourists! ...tourists in sneakers and jeans. That was a bit offsetting to me but I believe they are more strict with the dress code for dinner.Ever since dining here, I've been on a rosemary frenzy. Because of that darn rosemary infused lard that came with the bread. It was absolutely delicious and I would have smeared the entire serving on their perfect olive loaf if my mother didn't warn me that it'd go straight to my hips.Three amuse bouches to start - a tasty chicken salad finger sandwich, a creamy cauliflower soup and Â a dainty ricotta crisp. Our first courses were salads, hers the butter lettuce with truffle vinaigrette and mine the beautifully presented summer vegetable salad. We weren't expecting much by a simple salad course but we were both thoroughly impressed. Choosing meat over the pasta entrees, we had the lamb chops and duck breast. Both perfectly cooked to medium raw. The lamb chops came with a mild salsa that gave it nice kick (nothing that will make your nose run but it'll keep your taste buds entertained) and some wilted spinach that really didn't do anything for the dish. The duck breast was presented with hazelnuts and sour cherries for an interesting textural and taste pairing. My mother's tartufo dessert was just okay but my browned butter panna cotta was one of the best desserts I've had. If only the portion wasn't so small!!! The panna cotta was literally just a quarter of an inch high :( Petit fours presented in a cheese grater followed our actual desserts but I actually wasn't too impressed by them.Service was excellent, they never missed a beat. Little stools for our purses, asking if we needed to be shown the restroom as soon as we rose from the table, chairs pulled out and pushed in, napkins refolded when we excused ourselves to use the restroom, nifty bread crumb sweeper, and water constantly refilled.All in all, an excellent meal that will impress your guests.

Wine over $100 a bottle which is ridiculous and stupid. Food is great, very well prepared, we had the octopus and some kind of beef carpaccio. Both amazing, octopus served with aceto tradizionale, very expensive vinegar.The pasta was the star dish of the dinner, in my opinion, we had the gnudi, made with cacio e pepe and to my surprise there was an egg in the middle, they were amazing....and then we had the special taglierini with a white ragu.As an entree I had the cacciucco which is a famous plate from Livorno and it is a seafood stew with tomatoes broth, a little disappointing, broth was very blend. Then we had the steak, not on NYC standard, too thin too cooked, nothing special, then we had the pork which was incredibly tender with beans. None of the entrees were memorable and that is not good for a place that charge so much. The deserts were good, they have complimentary mini bomboloni, fried dough with cream inside, amazing they should be part of the desert menu.

Â We opted to enjoy our experience at the bar and were treated to exceptional service from Rebecca, and her support team. Â While this was my second dining experience here, the first a business dinner in the main dining area, we could not have had more attentive service or an exquisite lunch. Â Course by course, from the wonderful bread assortment served with lardo, amuse bouche (seriously the best little chicken salad sandwich and two other brilliant teasers), wine pairings, to the delectable lobster salad and truffled field greens, through to the pork three ways and the perfectly prepared lamb (food sharing at its finest if you like to sample everything with your friends), to the most amazing sorbeto made from celery accompanied by a goat cheese morsel, and finishing with a lovely assortment of sweet treats - it was all simply perfect. Â While I understand that many at Del Posto may be enjoying this experience on an expense account, as I did my first visit, what I must say is that I believe I enjoyed it even that much more so knowing that this was on my own dime and I savored every delectable bite. Â My ""first timer"" friend was in tears by the end of our lunch, not realizing that it was an early Christmas present - capped off by a tour of the kitchen at the end of the shift and a visit down to the wine cellar - which was a trip in itself.

Â We ordered a la carte (there were prices on the menu then) and everything we had was amazing. Â I remember a crab and jalapeno pasta and an olive oil gelato for dessert. Â Everything was really perfect, the food, service, ambience, wine. Â Had absolutely no complaints. Â Last week I brought my husband here for his 50th birthday. Â Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment. Â I'm not sure if the menu is just hit or miss and we were lucky last time, or things have declined in the last 5 years. Â The ambience and service were still very good, but neither of us ate one thing here that we would ever want to eat again. Â The amuse bouches were not good (puff pastry with pepper and parmesan and a matzo ball soup), the roasted root salad I had ($35) was microscopic - maybe 3 pieces of veg and 3 pieces of lettuce, my husband had the octopus ($35) and it was 1 overly charred tentacle with a couple more pieces of lettuce than I had. Â For mains I had the sweet potato capelacci ($39) that was supposed to have a browned butter sage sauce and crumbled hazelnuts- it was incredible dry - the hazelnuts soaked up all the ""sauce"" and the pasta was actually crunchy it was so underdone. Â My husband had the bass with truffle sauce that he said was almost completely tasteless. Â After the above and having a couple $20 drinks, we decided not to risk dessert. Â We remembered from the last time that they gave us a tray of small dessert bites in addition to our dessert that were really good. Â This time- it was a mug of dry cookies.

So, in order of importance to us (realize these priorities don't hold true for everyone):1) The food. We had the captain's tasting menu. The octopus was very chewy and chick peas in the dish over-salted. The gnudi was pretty unremarkable and a bit bland as was the final veal course.2) The wine. The sommelier was great and suggested italian wines based on the french wines we love. The selections were spot on and amazing.3) The environment. First off, there were small children there (we were dining on the early side but didn't think children would be an issue because of the nature of the place) and they, naturally, were screaming. It was pretty hard for us to have a relaxing time amongst the intermittent screeching. I'm not sure why restaurants like this can't have a no kids under a certain age policy.

770,51owfyKFJVAcW4PGj3mUVA,SM X.,5.0 star rating,"In a departure from the norm, this is the second Italian meal I had in a week - a surprise since I have Italian cuisine perhaps once per year or longer yet. I opted for this Mario Batali restaurant believing that he along with partner Lidia Bastianich who co-hosted the 2010 James Beard Awards would offer the quintessential Italian experience. And it did along with as enticing me away from the haute French fare that dominates my dining selections. The fresh baked bread and choice of butter or lardo were great. I understand why Batali raves about lardo...yes, it's fat, but sooo flavorful, rich and unlike foie gras or pate you can almost feel it sticking to your ribs. The 7-course tasting menu with wine pairing were a delight. The delicious amuse bouche included a parmesan crab crisp, deep fried couscous ball, deep-fried gnocchi wrapped in proscuitto and a summer tomato gazpacho. First course was the antipasto which included some greens with an anchovy based vinaigrette, a seafood salad with lobster, squid, shrimp and scallop, artichokes and red onion marinated in olive oil and chicken salad in a Radicchio Rosso di Treviso leaf which was a bit too bitter overpowering the chicken salad which was made without mayonnaise. The wine served was a Vermentino ""Fossi di Corsano"" (2008) from Tuscany.Second course was an ""Insalata Caprese & Tuna Ventresca"". The cheese was absolutely fresh and the grilled tomatoes were succulent and vine ripened and the tuna which had been marinated in olive oil was moist and a surprising accompaniment to the deconstructed caprese salad. This was served wtih a Brut Rose, Gratien.Third course was to be eaten with the fingers - ""Fonduta Anellini with black truffles and parmigiano"". These anellini rings, symbolic of wedding rings, were moist and freshly made and used to lap up the black truffle goodness drizzled beneath them. Served with a Chardonnay ""Collezione de Marchi"", Isole e Olena (2008) from Tuscany which surprisingly went well with the earthiness of the truffle.Fourth course was the famous ""100 layer lasagne with the ragu Bolognese"". I had heard about this dish and opted for the tasting menu specifically for this for it cannot be ordered a la carte. Each layer was light and delicate and the bolognese was deeply flavorful but not heavy. The portion seemed small but was in fact quite filling. Each layer reminded me of ultra-thin wonton skins. This was served with my favorite wine - St. Magdalener ""Huck Am Bach"", Cantina Bolzano (2009) Alto Adige. Â The meal could have ended here for me since I was satisfied without being stuffed.Fifth course was ""Veal in Ash with golden polenta & osso buco vinogrette"" accompanied by the Barolo ""Piccole Vigne"" Parusso (1998) from the Piemonte region. Â The veal was tasty - I was surprised to see a thin line of gristle through the meat. The polenta was very fine and seemed to seep into the vinaigrette. As a meat eater I enjoy being blown away by the final meat entree of the tasting, but alas I was not.Sixth course was a palate cleanser - Pineapple Coppetina...the acidity of the pineapple with a touch of cream was enjoyable...and it was about 2.5 spoonfuls.Seventh course was dessert ""Melanzane e Cioccolato alla Napoletana""...One might ask ""what is that?"" it's eggplant with a caramel crisp! served with a sheep's milk ricotta, which was a nice touch offering a creaminess along with the bite of the sheep's milk. Served with a recioto della Valpolicella, Bengali (2005) Veneto.Petit fours included chocolate, fruit gels, miniscule donuts filled with creme, chocolate lollipops covered with rice crisps.The darkly lit interior and the grandeur of the room seems to be a stable in New York City and with the power business scene which seemed to have their presence in the dining room. The service was excellent. I was delighted by the meal, blown away by the pasta and would return.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

I will probably not be able to afford a meal like Del Posto's Collezione menu again for at least another year, but that is fine. After all, one can only handle such an event in spare doses. This evening was quite perfect - service, food, atmosphere...all the things that make Del Posto my favorite ""fancy"" restaurant.

I would like a three course option at a lower price point as five courses was more food than I needed and I felt the dessert could be better appreciated if I were not already too full. Also, it would be nice to enjoy this lovely food on evenings where I can't invest the time for five courses. That said, the restaurant clearly takes staff training seriously and the level of attention to detail and courtesy is remarkable. The overall tone is impeccable without being fussy. One sour note was at the coat check on the way out- we were a party of four people and had not gotten our coat number. The coat check woman was rude to a degree- literally not speaking to us, brushing us aside. There was no where for us to go and no way to leave without our coats, and she was as dismissive, rude and unhelpful as can be. The doorman (by contrast) was immediately helpful and concerned and helped get it sorted. In a restaurant where everyone from the front of house to the chef, waiters busboys etc. were clearly all busting their bums to give a seamless experience, it was just stunning that she would think it OK to be so rude, especially as she was the last person giving a discordant ending to an otherwise lovely evening.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Del Posto is the first place (non prix-fixe) that jumps to mind.No complaints as it was delicious, but perhaps the highlight was the service (as most yelpers agree). We had a total of 3 waiters through the dinner including a 4th helper to provide water, etc and make sure our utencils were up-to-date. I swear this dude was watching us from the dark depths of the Del Posto underbelly just waiting for our water lines to dip below par. The ambiance wasn't a typical italian eatery but rather a very decadent place featuring clientele from families to couples and even one gentleman who proclaimed he knew what French wine tasted like (as he had some in France) and sent back a bottle to his dislike. That was a highlight!Granted, I'm not touching on the food, but need I? Go for the service as it will put the experience over the top, and paired with the environment honestly, the food won't disappoint.

779,ugTvdmxS6Vb6IDjUrjssqA,Diandra D.,5.0 star rating,"Brian has casually (and not-so-casually) mentioned Del Posto many times: it's the only Italian restaurant in NY to receive 4 stars from the New York Times in the last 30 years, it's famed for the quality of its food, masterful service and extensive wine collection, and most of all, he has always wanted to go there. So we did. Last night. And now I feel the need to actually walk through the entire experience, lest I forget to give proper credit to any one particular cog in this meticulously run machine of a restaurant.Upon passing the double doors, I was taken by the room, with two sets of staircases branching from the main dining room (one leading upstairs to balcony seating, one leading downstairs to The Piemonte Rooms Hall of Wine). The in-house pianist played Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""The Music of The Night"" in the background (I'm not sure if I should be embarrassed that I know that), which seemed fitting with the twinkling of candles and hushed murmurs from around the restaurant. After waiting at the bar for several minutes, we were escorted to our table. It wasn't immediately apparent who our waiter would be, as several people came over to our table in the five minutes that followed: one gentleman provided me with a stool to put my purse on; another poured our waters while yet another bought over a small glass bucket of ice cubes with tongs and lemon wedges (per my request). They would continue to be this attentive over the course of the evening. When our waiter, Oliver, arrived, I didn't actually realize he would be taking our orders. He was dressed in a black suit, which initially made me think he might have been an in-house sommelier or even a manager making rounds (it wasn't until later that I noticed the handful of other individuals dressed in a similar fashion). In some way, I was right about the sommelier part. The waiters at Del Posto are masterful at their jobs: Oliver not only explained the a la carte versus two tasting menu options, but also walked us through the ingredients and cooking techniques of every meal on the menu (EVERY ... SINGLE ... DISH!). He was also extremely knowledgeable about the very extensive wine list and offered full descriptions of each wine, along with what it would pair well with. We ultimately decided upon the Il Menu Del Posto five course tasting option: it provided us with the flexibility to select our own dishes and really get a varied sampling of what Del Posto has to offer (the Menu Tradizionale has smaller plates that reflect the Chef's fancy of the day). With the Il Menu Del Posto, both of us received an Antipasti, a Secondi and a Dolci. We also had our choice of two Primi (pasta) dishes that would be shared. We got:Antipasti: Charred Octopus and Lobster Fra Diavlo: The Charred Octopus was served with a 25 year Aceto aged balsamic vinegar, celery hearts, sauteed garbanzo beans and grilled peaches. The octopus was cooked perfectly and oh so subtly enhanced by the balsamic drizzle and sweetness of the peach.The lobster was served cold, which I don't think Brian expected, and came with a garlic bread panna cotta. I'm a sucker for panna cotta, and I thought that texturally the two complemented each other perfectly. Brian preferred my dish.Primi: Tortello Puzzone and Orecchiette: I did my homework, and read that the Tortello was not to be missed. Oliver informed us that it really was quite incredible, and paired beautifully with the Orecchiette. The Tortello did not disappoint. It was one of the richest, most decadent pastas I've ever eaten. Brian and I had been informed while we were ordering that the pasta dishes were small in the tasting menu, but in all honesty, the three pieces of tortello pasta I received more than satisfied my craving (truth be told, I started to get full). The Orecchiette was small and delicate, but full of flavor from the lamb neck ragu and orange-soaked carrots (even the breadcrumbs added a unique texture and nice crunch). Secondi: Sardinian Lamb Chop and Pork Trio: Lamb chops are meant to be cooked medium rare, which is extremely unfortunate for me, as I need to have all my food thoroughly cooked for it to be pregnancy safe. I tried my best to savor the fully cooked edges, but ultimately relinquished my delicious lamb over to Brian who proceeded to devour it. Of the three types of pork offered in his dish, we only really preferred one, but the polenta ragu and crushed parsnips were perfect. Dolci: Fruit Crostata (Me) and Tartufo al Caffe (Brian) : The fruit crostata was delicious, warm and flaky outer crust dusted with powdered sugar and filled with cherries, berries and other soaked fruit. The vanilla gelato was the best I've ever had (and I've been to Italy!). Brian begged me to try his Tartufo, but I literally could not eat anything else (especially since they also gave us a container of biscotti cookies and two mini powdered donuts). Meticulous service, delectable food, gorgeous ambiance. A perfectly indulgent evening.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

The ambiance was lovely, the candles leading up the staircase, the lighting etc. it was overall very romantic. I feel it is important to note the service was 5 star all the way. It was a great way to celebrate a birthday :)Upon entry, we were shown to our table tucked away in a corner (which was perfect for me) and was brought a little stool for me to put my purse on which is a really thoughtful touch! I wasn't happy about having to put it on the floor so they got points for that. We were served an amuse bouche of a cucumber with a creamy filling that was really tasty, and a little tasting of a cold tomato soup with a basil powder rim for a bit more taste. We were then brought a few more extras ( bite sized rice balls with gold leaf, chickpea balls, and Sicilian bread balls) all were tasty but none blew me away. Our waiter guided us through the menu, asked our personal preferences as far as what kind of meat we liked, and allergies etc. After deciding on the 8 course tasting, we were so happy when he brought us a ribeye tartare, which was incredibly fresh and well prepared. Next was a grilled octopus with a chickpea purÃ©e. I am the biggest fan of octopus. But to be honest this dish did not do it for me. I've had way better prepared octopus elsewhere for less. Seasoning could have been done a little more, and it was almost soggy on one side and nicely done on the other. A bit of lemon would have brightened it up. We then had two pasta courses, luna piena with raw cows milk and truffle oil. It was incredibly decadent and inspired me to work out extra hard this afternoon :) Â I absolutely loved the veal agnolotti. It was probably my favorite dish of the evening. The portion was just right so as to not stuff you for the remaining courses. Thank god!! Next we had a well prepared swordfish which was really nice, and the real star was the duck cooked just perfectly. All of their presentations were beautiful. Well, by this point I was so full I wasn't sure about dessert. I have never ran out of room for that so of course it wasn't a problem ;) We were brought a ricotta cake with chocolate ganache, covered with pistachio and olive oil ice cream on the side. Oh. My. God!!! I was in heaven.....They brought us even more dessert after this.. A little box with olive oil Popsicles, tiny fruit tarts, chocolate truffles, candies with edible rice paper and a little red candy that tasted a bit like a sundried tomato but sweeter. I didn't have the stomach to touch most of these items by this point, but I did sample a few :) As if this wasn't enough, they brought us individual boxes of pistachio cookies to take home in a beautiful little box. I just had one and they are were incredible!

But as much as we wanted to keep to ourselves, we kept stretching our necks to see what the next table was devouring, whispering to discuss what was going on, and taking mental notes to pull the whole meal together in the end.Del Posto was a feast. Service was amazingly quick (what happened to the seven hour dining experience?) and there was so much detail on everything. We were served complimentary white bean soup with dark chocolate shavings. It was smooth, a little creamy, sweetly aromatic, and in the end had a chewy bite. We were also given a skewer of broccoli and mushroom. We ordered the pork loin, duck breast, and garganelli pasta. The pork loin was juicy and tender. It was served with a fig that was stuffed with ground pork. On the side, in it's own separate dish I was served onion rings so they didn't get soggy from the reduction sauce of the pork loin. These were the best onion rings I have ever tasted. They were perfectly crunchy and light in batter. The pasta was good but I think the main courses were better and the pasta at Otto is just as good. The duck breast wins for the night because it was served with foie gras! In a little cup, we had foie gras topped with pumpkin seeds. We spread the foie gras on buttered toast with a baby spoon. It was the silkiest, sweetest, buttery foie gras I had ever tasted. It was a true delicacy. The duck was also very meaty and flavorful and placed on top of cauliflower. An apple and celery chutney was paired with the duck but we decided to skip it. It overwhelmed the duck slightly. After our main courses, the waiter placed a white napkin over the messy parts of our table. Voila! Instant clean table.Dessert was a feast for the eyes and tastebuds. The hot chocolate was heavenly. Rich but smooth and warm on this cold and rainy winter day. It came with the thickest whipped cream ever. The chocolate souffle was divine. The waiter poked a hole in the middle with a spoon and then proceeded to pour chocolate syrup into the middle. It was paired with espresso gelato and brandied cherries. We were also given a variety of miniature cookies. We were full by this time and it was quite overwhelming to watch our waiter serve us the cookies but one bite and we couldn't help but finish the whole plate. He was so nice and funny, he even told us if we wanted more just to let him know. We were given extra white chocolate hazelnut crunchies. This was God's spin on rice crispies. On the plate was also home made versions of merangue, oreos, caramel, jam cookies, orange and apricot jellies, etc. Each one was equisite.As we exited Del Posto, each guest was given a sealed golden box of chocolates. What a nice touch. I was way too full to even taste the chocolates and really appreciate it. Two days later, I finally opened the box and in it were the most delicious round truffle balls dusted with cocoa.

790,O_onR3HUrk1OR7YPLp3jmQ,Jane D.,5.0 star rating,"Someday when I'm an old, fat, grouchy rich lady, I am going to eat through Del Posto's menu and drink through it's biblically proportioned wine list, cover to cover. This restaurant has won my heart (which despite what the anatomists say, is pretty much a suborgan of my stomach). Del Posto manages to be both very grand and very warm and accessible at the same time, retaining the friendly spirit of Mario Batali's other ventures, despite the shinier packaging. First off, the packaging: Del Posto has astonishingly high ceilings with a Gone With the Wind-esque staircase at the center of it all -- the kind of staircase I would like to sweep down in a ball gown... or maybe just slide down the banister. Unlike other establishments with vaulted ceilings like Eleven Madison Park, however, Del Posto doesn't feel like a converted bank or threaten to swallow puny humans alive in grandeur. This is one of those restaurants where about eight to ten people serve your table throughout dinner and two or three more greet you, handle your coat and open the door for you. I generally hate being so outnumbered because the ratios tend to make for overly hovery service and that makes me feel more nervous than pampered. At Del Posto, however, though I'm sure the wait staff were watching our table quite closely, they did it so subtly and unobtrusively that my SO and I really were able to have a conversation and feel as though it were actually private. The service was flawless, the food nearly as good as the service. Â 1. Complimentary Amuse Course I with Complimentary Bastianich Sparkling Italian Wine (Lidia Bastianich and her son are co-owners, with Batali)- Arancini with saffron and a sprinkling of gold dush (gorgeously crisp with a melty, cheesy middle; not blotted, so very oily -- but it was perfect with the bubbles)- Gougeres with black truffle (IIRC; lovely and light, fragrant)- Egg drop soup (stracciatella? overly salty, lacked the intensely concentrated flavors of great broth, unfortunately) 2. Complimentary Amuse Course II - fresh buffalo mozzarella with cocoa nibs and coffee (*beautiful* mozzarella, interesting combinations of flavors that I think mostly worked together)- farinata (not a crepe, but fried balls of chickpea flour; delicious! but again, not drained and very oily)- goat cheese tartlettes (the SO ate both, much to my dismay...) 3. Appetizer / Primi- Warm Cotechino with Umbrian Lentil Vinaigrette & Dried Fruit Mostarda Â  Â Cotechino was carved and plated with great production tableside and served with fat little lentils, cooked with some bite left, and beautiful house made mostarda. Each component was delicious on its own, but the marriage of moist, unctuous sausage with sweet, barely hot, acidic mostarda and earthy lentils was brilliant. - Â Pasta e Fagioli with Black Cabbage Marmellata This was a primi that was brought out as my SO's appetizer since he skipped the appetizer course and I skipped the primi. Though the texture of the soup was very nice, oversalting overwhelmed the more subtle flavors. 4. Secondi - Wild Stripped Bass alla Piastra with Romanesco, Pumpernickle & Limonata Â  Â This might've been one of the most perfectly cooked, moist, fish dishes I've had in NYC outside of Le Bernardin. Flavors were subtle and balanced. Nothing on the plate overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the impeccably fresh fish. - Roasted Lamb Rack with Tail Ragu alla Puttanesca & Sauteed Basil Â  Pefectly cooked, meltingly tender, moist lamb served with an impossibly rich ragu and fragrant, sauteed basil. 5. Dessert - Butterscotch Semifreddo, Melon Marmellata, Crumbled Â Sbrisalona & Milk Jam Â The butterscotch flavor was intense, the semifreddo's texture textbook perfect. The sweet marmellata didn't do much to cut the sweetness of the rest of the dessert, but it was a nice textural contrast. - Tartufo al Caffe with Dark Chocolate, Sant Eustachio Coffee & Candied LemonI didn't really want a rich dessert of my own after the very substantial meal, but the restaurant very kindly sent this to us on the house. This dessert was so good, I couldn't stop myself from gobbling the entire thing down despite being stuffed to the gills. Deep, rich, high cacao content chocolate offset by the tiniest fragments of sweet/bitter lemon peel and bitter coffee = pretty much irresistible, even to this non-chocolate lover. 6. WinesWith dinner, we had a Pigato Bruna Le Russeghine 2007 from Liguria (crisp, dry, grassy and inoffensive, but not deeply interesting) and an Etna Rosso Biondi Outis 2006 from Sicily (very interesting combination of red fruits--plum?--and earthiness, perfect with lamb).

Although it's tempting to run through every dish, instead I'll just mention the things that stood out to me as unusually tasty!The aged prosciutto on the antipasto platter, the fonduta (ORDER some shaved truffles for at least this course!!), and the pineapple coppetina were some of the standouts of the night. Our ""main"" waiter instructed us to eat the fonduta with our fingers, and despite being several courses in, I had to stop myself from greedily gobbling up every piece of that dish in seconds. I honestly considered licking the plate it was so good!I don't think I ate anything ""bad"" the entire evening, unless you count the lardo...as it was most definitely bad for my arteries!If you don't speak Italian, I won't ruin the surprise of the Melanzane dessert, which was interesting but not my favorite. And then of course, the extra dessert presented beautifully. I saved a tiny bite of candied (?) grapefruit for last and wish I had a platter of these hovering nearby all day. A tiny burst of juice, sweetness all mixed with the sourness of grapefruit. Delicious!Charming waitstaff and amazing food= a great date night I won't forget!",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

The service is excellent and professional.Now for the not-so-good news...When we asked our waiter to simply tell us what a word on the menu was, he went into an absurd, worthy of a comedy club description.Does a diner-guest Â really care if the capers come from the Southern region of Sicily? Â Or if the pork is sliced on a 37 degree angle?It was that type of detail that blurred into... blah blah blah.He gave a further explanation after the food was placed in front of us.....it was getting colder as he went on about the treasures we were about to eat. He never bothered to explain the crystal organization of the salt...whew!Now...the food....my lobster appetizer was served chilled and coated with tomato sauce. It was fair.The dish also had a slice of white pulp that tasted like greasy mozzarella. I couldn't eat it...a rare occurrence. The shared pasta dishes had superb sounding pedigrees...but were rather ho-hum. Â I would not order either again.My pork dish also promised a lot more in the description than it did in the mouth. It was completely acceptable. But no better than that.It was not nearly worth the price of the meal.I don't complain about price...I've been to Per Se several times and always feel it's worth the price. Masa...not so.

My husband had his favorite dessert, gelato, the roasted cashew was amazing and the chocolate smooth and rich. I had the chocolate tasting.

Â Big enough for the piano player to hit the keys with force and have the melody carry throughout the room. Â My expectations were met and exceeded, the food, service, and ambiance were tops. Â The Amuse Bouche, three actually, were small and packed with flavor as expected, my favorites being a nice take on an Arancini, salty, crunchy and cheesy. Â For my antipasto I had the Charred OCTOPUS, Umbrian Garbanzo, Celery Hearts & 25 yr Aceto Tradizionale. Â While it was not the tenderest Octopus I've eaten, flavor wise it was one of the best preparations I've had in NYC, very well balanced with the chickpeas and 25 year aged balsamic. Â It was an earthy, meaty, bold dish. Â This was also the best visual presentation of the food we ordered. Â The LOBSTER Fra Diavolo with Garlic Bread Panna Cotta & Seaweeds was neither hot nor cold, which was interesting, I would have enjoyed it cold I think. Â The tomatoes and panna cotta were delicate enough to not over power the lobster, yet accented the sweet mild meat very well. Â Another great dish.For our pasta course we ordered the SPAGHETTI with Dungeness Crab, Sliced Jalapeno & Minced Scallion. Wow. Â Absolutely swimming in crab flavor; deep rich sea flavored pasta, just a hint of spice, wonderful balance. Â Loved this dish! Â Our second pasta course we played it a bit safer, due to the eating habits of my dining partner, and ordered the 100 Layer Lasagna. Â Probably the best I've ever had. Â It's hard to fawn over something as simple as lasagna, but it really was delicious, and my dining partner was thrilled with it as well. Â I love the way they sear each individual piece. Â Two fantastic pastas.The main courses I've noticed in Italian restaurants are often a letdown for me whether in NYC or even in Italy. Â I'm usually blown away by the antipasto and of course the pasta course, then the meal goes a bit downhill. Â Thankfully nothing of the sort happened at Del Posto. Â My main course on the recommendation of our fantastic waiter Oliver, was the CACCIUCCO with Burrida & Sweet Shrimp alla Buzara which was one of the best things I've ever eaten. Â Both main courses were large plates, not a tasting menu portion. Â By this time in the meal even I had trouble finishing the food, yet I just not put down the spoon! Â Amazing, delicately cooked bits of shelfish and a piece of crisp almost burnt toast (which I loved) bathed in a very deep rich broth that reminded me of lobster bisque. Â Deep rich flavor, and amazingly delicious! Â The Burnt BEEF Potato Torta & Calabrian Spicy Tongue Stew was also fantastic and greatly enjoyed by my dinner guest. Â I love the Peter Luegar style burnt aspect of the beef, the flavor was fantastic.Desserts were somewhat forgettable, perhaps the least impressive part of the meal, but by no means bad at all. Â The Petit fours however were the most memorable and delicious I've ever had. Â No boring sugar cookie, or Jelly fruit Cube, these were deeper exciting flavors, and plentiful. Â The service from Oliver was impeccable. Â He was attentive and a wealth of knowledge about food and even other restaurants in the city, it was fun to pick his brain, and I loved his balance between formal and casual. Â That's the kind of service I love, it did not at all feel stuffy.Perfect meal in every way, even the value was excellent considering we were absolutely stuffed by the time we left.

Â The main reason why I love bank holidays is that I can go to weekday prix fixe lunches I normally wouldn't be able to go to because of work. Â It's the frugal Chinese in me.I tried the $29 prix fixe at Del Posto on New Year for their winter menu, and it was probably the best lunch I ever had. Â From the amuse bouche of egg drop soup to my celery sorbetto, every single bite was tantalizing. Â I was glad I paid the extra $10 for the lobster salad appetizer because every morsel was meaty.In February I went back for the $23 restaurant week prix fixe lunch. Â It was cheaper, but there weren't as many selections. Â I can't really remember what I ordered, but I do recall liking the regular prix fixe better.This past week I went back for my 3rd prix fixe lunch at Del Posto.

Â I also ordered the Cacciucco, which is a squid, shrimp, fish stew, and I regretted it after a few bites. It's not bad, but mid bite, I remembered the much more filling lamb chop and duck breast my companion and I ordered my first time there.Throughout the meal, we smothered lardo and butter on top of the breadsticks, olive bread, and thyme bread basket that kept refilling.

None of the dishes were any special, the secondi and pasta were the most disappointing of all. The dolci was probably the only saving grace of the entire meal, but then again I just had chocolate cake with ice-cream. I would have gotten the same quality and taste elsewhere for half the price it cost here. The waiter service was probably the best of what was a lackluster and pretentious evening experience.

The baguette is crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and has the perfect balance of salt+aromatic. It tastes absolutely divine with the butter (I wasn't a huge fan of the lard). My friend and I actually devoured 1.5 baguettes each before our food actually came =P Even though we were way stuffed by the end, the baguettes were totally worth it. The waiters will serve you unlimited bread baskets, so at some point you'll have to practice self-restraint.

You walk into this really warm but classy elegant interior and you just blink for a second - a second level with what look like individual terraces curving out for tables, a piano, wine everywhere... ooooh. Â But we got seated on the first level. That's okay.The bread basket was piping hot and came with about 5 selections, including my fave - foccacia! This was the only place that ever served me lard with bread. Hm. Wasn't a fan.We opted for the 3-pasta tasting for primi (highly recommended) - Pumpkin Cappellacci (with almond milk, yum!), Del Posto Agnolotti (you eat it with your hands and dip it in Parmesan cheese!), and my favorite of the three, Garganelli Verdi with Ragu Bolognaise (it had a surprisingly light and great consistency). Â I was stuffed already by this point because there was a complimentary three-part sampler that had come out before the pasta too. Niiice. For secondi, we had lobster (sizable portion and tasty) and halibut. I liked the halibut because of the sweet and tangy bed of sauce it came on top of - it really accentuated the soft fish texture and flavor. The fish portion was smaller than I thought it would be but I was already so stuffed that I took over half of it home. We ended by sharing the butterscotch semifreddo, which was delicious albeit not quite to-die-for. Strong butterscotch taste, which is a plus in my book. Â Complimentary donut balls (haha) and petit fours to end our night.The only disappointment was the obviously lesser quality of service compared to some of the other guests. I guess I can't really complain because we weren't all decked out (it was a spontaneous stop in) and didn't order any wine that night. Â But shouldn't service be hospitable no matter how ""money"" you seem? I guess not.

Other than the primary server, however, the others who attended to our meal were really nice and gracious. Â They won that extra 5 star from me.

Fortunately, Del Posto is one of the 4, not the 2. The 2 are Mozza in LA and Babbo in NYC. Both I found to be mediocre at best, especially in light of the money. The other 3 wins are Lupa, Mozza Pizzeria and last but not least, my favorite of the bunch, Tarry Lodge.But I digress. Back to Del Posto. I find the dÃ©cor to be very stuffy, particularly when you consider the neighborhood it's in. It feels like it belongs in midtown or on Wall St., not the trendy Meat Packing District. But it is far from bad. Just out of place, if you ask me. Now for the food. I was certain to do a little yelping research before I arrived, and we did in fact do the lunch prix fixe adding one extra course and wine parings. So, we ""did it right. ""The first thing to come was the amuse bouche, which certainly got things off on the right foot.

For my primi, I also went with the Yelpster hype and chose the garganelle, which was definitely good, but not 5 star good.For my secondi, I had the duck and shared some lamb both based, once again, on Yelp acclaim. The duck was just okay. But the lamb was fantastic. And finally, for my dolci, I had the chocolate tortino- and yes, I yelped that too. And that also, was just okay. HOWEVER, it was all of the other little desserts they brought that were incredible. There were these mini ice cream bar things that were a wonderful surprise as they exploded in your mouth. White chocolate oat clusters that made me wish I had just ordered a vat of those, and macadamia nuts rolled in chocolate and other goodness that I can't seem to recall either, but keep in mind I was pretty tipsy by that point from all of the wine, which was well paired and quite good.So, the final tally for me on Del Posto is that I liked it.

Â We ended taking the the Bisol Prosecco. It was good. Worth $80? No, but still complimented our meals well.We tried the 5 course Del Posto meals, which are totally worth it.For antipasti we had:Carne Cruda: It was weird.

Definitely perfectly light and crunchy with a lemony caper sauce. So yummy! Nice portion sizes, as well.For Pasta we had:Spaghetti with Dungeness Crab, Sliced Jalapeno & Minced Scallion: totally awesome. had a very asian taste to it, but also very rich.Del Posto Agnolotti dal Plin with Ramp Butter: This could be the best pasta I've ever tried. It was perfect, flavorful, and though the portion was small, so fulfilling. Â Most of the waiters recommended or said it was also their favorite dish. I can see why.For dinner we had:Seared Duck Breast, Apician Spices, Grilled Apricots & Salt Baked Endive: Â It was perfectly cooked, the duck liver was savory and melted in your mouth, and the apricots alone tasted perfect. Â I'm not a fan of duck, it was my boyfriend's dish, but he loved it. He was so stuffed at this point he could hardly finish it.Young Lamb alla Romana, Lemon Yogurt with Ceci & Swiss Chard Ragu: Â Also perfectly cooked.

Wasn't my favorite.Butterscotch Semifreddo, Preserved Melon Agrumata, Crumbled Sbrisolona & Milk Jam: This was tasty! I can't explain it, I only had a bite, but it was yummy.I'm not the best cook, but for the most part, everything was delicious.It's not overpriced at all, though the wine is pricy, but what restaurant doesn't up-charge immensely for wine?You feel really full at the end, definitely satisfied.The door man even got us a cab.Thanks Del Posto. :]",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
818,ih-rNuRju-Vs772oNxCJlw,Kevin C.,5.0 star rating,"Earlier this week, I visited Del Posto for lunch. This was my time dining at a Michelin-star, and I had never partaken in a meal that was as much about the food as it was about the meal experience. The atmosphere, decor, and service were all top-notch, and I enjoyed every moment of my two hour lunch.Shortly after placing our orders, my dining companion and I were served Amuse Bouche consisting of Stracciatella (Italian egg drop soup), fried risotto balls, and Mortadella mousse-Filled Puff Pastries. Of these, I thought that the risotto ball stood out; the crisp exterior contrasted nicely with the soft interior, and there was a hit of creaminess from some cheese in the risotto. The legendary bread basket was, of course, phenomenal. My personal favorite was the olive ciabatta. The salty, briny olives imparted a tremendous amount of flavor to the bread, and it had the perfect amount of internal chewiness. Although the baguette tasted great on its own, a quick swipe with the lardo really elevated it to another level. Now, I'm pretty health conscious, but man, was that lard-smeared bread good.For my first course, I went with the Roasted Autumn Vegetables with Robiola Sformato & Truffled Hazelnuts while my dining companion opted for the Warm Cotechino with Umbrian Lentil Vinaigrette & Dried Fruit Mostarda. In my opinion, if given the chance to select between meat and vegetable, meat is the unquestioned winner, and that's the case here. While the vegetable dish was tasty and had a great earthiness about it, it couldn't compare to the warm, fatty sausage. Mmmm more pork fat :)Although some of the pasta dishes sounded intriguing, both of us selected meat-based entrÃ©es for our second courses. My duck (Seared Duck Breast, Apician Spices, Savor alla Francescana & Lovage) dish was superb, as was my dining partner's lamb (Slow Baked Lamb alla Puttanesca & Garlic Tatsoi), though I prefer my lamb medium-rare rather than cooked through.Both of our dessert choices (the Tartufo and the Tortino) were delicious as well. The tartufo (Tartufo al Caffe with Dark Chocolate, Sant Eustachio Coffe & Candied Lemon) is incredible and has a really intense coffee flavor. If you're a coffee lover, you will definitely enjoy this dessert. As for the tortino (Chocolate Ricotta Tortino with Sicilian Pistachios & Extra Virgin Olive Oil Gelato), the moist cake was not overly rich, and the pistachios added a nice crunch. I'm a fan of the EVOO gelato, which has the whole sweet/salty vibe going on. Finally, the Petit Fours (candied grapefruit with caramel, chocolate truffles, bombolini, and chocolate-covered olive oil gelato lolipops) were all delicious as well. I was actually kind of surprised at how much I enjoyed the candied grapefruit, which seemed like the least exciting of the four. I didn't expect the grapefruit to pair so nicely with the caramel.I still cannot believe that $29 was all that it cost for such a great dining experience. I guess the only downside is that the location is a bit out of the way. Given that the lunch took around two hours, this is something that I would have to plan for a bit in advance, but I'm already looking forward to my next visit to Del Posto for their awesome lunch prix fixe.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

It's truly a beautiful restaurant, and the service is outstanding. Not to mention the extensive wine list!

When I asked for it, I was given a high brow and ""We don't add cheese, it ruins the flavor of the pasta... are you sure you want cheese?"" Yes I want cheese!

839,xR0432PpY7uOvTWFfGvteQ,Emily F.,5.0 star rating,"Like a bunch of other Yelp users, I read a lot of reviews about Del Posto before actually going. I think most of us are hesitant to spend that much money on a meal before hearing what others had to say first.However, I do have to disagree with a lot of the previous reviews who argued that the Â food was nothing special. I went with a friend of mine and we each had the five course meal. We had a 7:15 reservation and were seated almost immediately. Upon walking in, the host greeted us, left to seat a couple, and then immediately returned and apologized for the exceptionally brief wait. It took us some time to get our menus, but it wasn't a huge problem because it gave us the opportunity to scope out the restaurant which is BEAUTIFUL. The large staircase in the middle was adorned with candles and really set the whole room alight. Our waitress came back and was incredibly professional and nice with ordering. We had accidentally ordered two raviolis, which we wouldn't have noticed had she not brought it up. Five minutes after ordering, she brought us the complimentary amuse bouche which was phenomenal. We had a delicious chicken miso soup and rice balls (there was one other which I can't remember). After that, we had our salads (we both chose the bitter herb one) which were incredibly dressed. Additionally, we had the breads on the side. The focaccia is NOT to be missed! I didn't love the butter, but the bread was great enough that I could overlook it.Next, came our two pastas. This was by far my favorite part of the meal. We started with the pumpkin cappellacci with brown sage butter. It was the best ravioli I've ever had. It was cooked to perfection and was served very hot (which made sense for the pumpkin). Our second pasta was the risotto. If you go to Del Posto, YOU MUST ORDER THE RISOTTO. It was deliciously salty with the tang of cheese. However, the Â most amazing part is when the waiter pours the 25 year old balsamic over the top. It is so perfectly flavored. Slight sweet with just enough bite. The tastes came together so ridiculously well.Finally, came our main meal. My friend ordered the lamb, which she touted as being delicious. I ordered the chicken, which I loved equally. I asked for all of the juice with olives, which ensured that it was tender and moist. It was somewhat hard to eat bone-in, but it worked out alright.After we ate the meal, it was time for dessert. My friend and I struggled to figure out what to order. I, especially, was torn between the chocolate tortino and the chocolate cherry dish. I eventually caved and got the chocolate tortino, but was still having mixed feelings about my choice, before the waiter came over carrying both our chocolate torintos AND the cherry dish on the house. It was so amazing and seemed like a gesture from God. Both were mouthwateringly delicious. I fell in love. When we were positively stuffed, we received the box of dessert treats. My favorites were the orange cream filled donuts and the chocolate truffles. The donuts were just slightly warm and the truffles were deliciously bitter.The whole meal was amazing and the service was flawless. Everything tasted exactly like I had hoped.

I had one last chance for a free weekday lunch before I gave myself up for a summer of work, with no options to take a two hour lunch. I had to take advantage. $29? It's practically an April Fool's joke. I was immediately seated to a table meant for one person, and was asked what I'd like to drink. ""Ohhh a white peach bellini sounds fantastic."" And it was - not too dry, substantial, and peachy. Then came the amuse bouche, before the gigantic bread basket oddly enough. Everyone knows by now what the amuse consists of, so I won't go into detail; all I can say is that one could make a meal out of the breadbasket alone, which contains six fat pieces of bread (the thyme roll is my favorite) and breadsticks. You can practically feel the whipped lardo and imported butter trickling into your veins, but it gives off a very warm, cushiony feeling. Spectacular. For my appetizer, I was transported to the turn of the century when French Service was king; the moreish cotechino (pork sausage) is brought out on a giant, gleaming steam table along with the fixings for the dish (fig mostarda, lentils) and the waiter precisely and delicately plates the food. It's kind of embarrassing, because who can't stare at a person disappearing behind a giant steam table? but it's worth it. Next is the entree. I opted for the garganelli with bolognese. Fantastic. I was already full well before this point, but I couldn't stop eating the tender green pasta. I ended up taking some home, and believe me, it tastes awesome reheated in the microwave. And then....then....there was dessert. My experience was, sadly, coming to an end, and even though I knew that if someone pressed my belly button, I would pop, I couldn't wait for the famed sweets. I got the butterscotch semifreddo, which didn't taste particularly of butterscotch, but the cookie crumbs, dulce de leche (milk jam) and supreme blood orange totally made up for that, as did the texture. The most unexpected part of the dish was the melon, which was dehydrated and had a lovely chewy texture. The cheese grater filled with desserts was the last thing to grace my table before the check. The fantastically famous olive oil ice cream pop was there (I could eat a hundred) as were a polenta tart, candied grapefruit, and a citrus bombolino. When I retrieved my coat, a box of two magnificently bitter truffles tagged along! Service was, naturally, perfect, and I really credit one of the waiters for remembering my doggy bag - he caught me as I was leaving; if he didn't I would have forgotten. I don't know when I'll be able to take advantage of the lunch deal, but the combination of the service, food, price and ambiance will surely make it one of my top priorities.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Â The decor of this place is amazing, very spacious, with great details all around.Okay, so we were seated, and promptly, the server greeted us with compliementary Bellinis that we're exceptional. Â 1st course: Â You had the option for three dishes, I can't remember all of them, but I remember one being some salad of sorts, and I ended up getting a pork sausage one, that was served with a fruit chutney. Â Overall the dish was very good, but not memorable.2nd course: Â You had three choices here, a Penne Verde Bolegnese, which my friend got and enjoyed, a salmon entree, and a pork entree. Â I immediately got the pork entree. Â The pork they had was Berkshire pork, for you non restaurateurs, this is basically the Kobe beef of pork, fatty and juicy, cooked pink, but cooked through. Â This was my first time with Berkshire pork and it definitely won't be my last. Â It was served with some sauce that went too well with the dish. Â This is a dish that I'd order 9/10 again, if I could. Â 3rd course: Â Chocolate tartufo.

Â But regardless it was a nice surprise. Â I think it was accompanied by biscotti, but I may be wrong. Â The bread basket was fantastic, my gf is a big bread fanatic.We ordered the dungeness crab w/ jalapeno spaghetti to split and they were nice enough to split it into separate plates without us asking. We never had this combination of spiciness, smooth crab meat, with al dente pasta before, it was definitely superb.

852,-xmHvrMvf4yatKWCbFU56w,Selena L.,4.0 star rating,"I'm still digesting last night's menu tradizionale from Del Posto, a seven course behemoth of a meal that should not be eaten after sunset if you value the health of your intestines. As I do not, I made a reservation for 9pm, and we weren't seated until twenty minutes later. No matter, as I was gleefully indulging in a fantastic little cocktail with jalapeno infused something or other (16$). My dining companion, an old friend from the New York Hard Core (NYHC) scene, marveled at how fancy it was, but declined to try it because he's a teetotaling nerd and former straight edge dork. Fine, more for me.Upon being seated in a dimly lit corner of the restaurant, a helpful fellow came by to explain the menu options to us. I, ever so charming, turned to my friend and said, ""Why, we should have an affair because nobody would notice us in this discreet area."" To my friend's credit, he at least laughed. We quickly and without hesitation agreed upon the menu tradizionale and I accepted the wine suggestions (I did not opt for the additional wine pairing as that would have tacked on another 135$ to our already 155$ per person meal).I can't even begin to describe the ridiculous amount of food we were served (though it was nothing compared to the Corton tasting menu of nine courses that I had the week earlier), but I can extol the virtues of smearing rosemary infused whipped lardo on a warm baguette. I will not drown my crudo in a burrata sauce; as much as I love seafood and the cheese equally, I generally do not believe they belong together (exception is the astice starter at Marea). I can now brag that I've eaten ostrich three ways. Egg yolk wrapped nudi, pillowy bites from which the golden yolk oozed out of sheep's milk ricotta, were ethereal and delicate, surrounded by shavings of raw asparagus. Fancy olive oils were touted and explained, some having the flavor notes of ""banana"" during staff tasting. A 100 layer lasagna left me bewildered, as I was expecting a towering masterpiece, but it was a thin, shriveled slice to be smeared with butter that left me wanting a regular old lasagna from a pizzeria in midtown. Portion size was fine though, considering the richness of all of the courses. Dessert was unexpected with the playful whimsy of the basil gelato against the roasted nectarine atop a grilled lemon cake. Even better was the small box of tiny chocolates - that lollipop was a superb little bite of a fancy pants rendition of a Klondike bar.Our servers were wonderful, especially the man who suggested my wines and humored us when we asked about Brooks. My friend and he discussed hardcore and punk rock bands of the 70's and 80's. He even went to see if he was in the kitchen, because my friend was a drummer in a notable NYHC band, but alas, Chef Headley was not. Friend and I languished for awhile, laughing at the table of awful girls seated beside us who were having the most banal conversation (how do you tell your friends that you've read a book on the NY Times bestseller list but not discuss what it's about, you wanker?), and then trundled back into the streets, but not before receiving our tiny boxes of chocolate truffles to take home with us.It was a lovely meal complete with exceptional service, there is no doubt, but I do miss the a la carte menu from 2008. I still dream of that orecchiette with lamb neck ragu. Something similar remains on the smaller menu, and it could be ordered as part of that tasting or a la carte in conjunction with another tasting menu, but I just want that by itself. It is my personal belief that tasting menus are limiting and parochial. That I can still fondly reminisce about a dish I ate three years ago means it is something truly glorious to experience.Total damage with tax, pre tip, for two menu tradizionale, three glasses of wine and one cocktail: 405$.

Â Sure, it's in a part of town that I don't go to very often (except to Chelsea Market, which is right across 10th Avenue), but it's also a joint venture of Lidia Bastianich, whose restaurant Felidia I have enjoyed for so many years, and Mario Batali, whose skill and personality shine in so many great places. Â To top it off, the Maitre d' is Piero Trotta, formerly of San Domenico, another of my all time favorite restaurants. Stepping inside a building that looks like an old warehouse, I was dumbstruck by the lavish beauty of the recreated 18th century Italian palazzo. Â We were shown to the cocktail lounge to enjoy an apertivo while we waited for the rest of our party, and on their arrival we were seated in a lovely table on the mezzanine, overlooking the main floor.I won't go into detail on the food and service other than to say that everything arriving at our table was exquisitely prepared and served with precision, as if by a team of chefs and servers dedicated to our table's complete and utter satisfaction. Â The dishes were imaginatively created, yet with respect for the ingredients and for the best elements of traditional Italian cuisine, and the vast selection of wines was offered and served with the utmost professionalism.

Food is excellent though. But the service is such a turn off. Hopefully I don't get dragged here again anytime soon. I'm actually having my wedding at The Bastianich family vineyard, Restaurant Guido in Serralunga de Alba in Italy. It's an amazing place; it's strange that they are owned by the same people- Del Posto has become a terrible dining experience. -----------------------/I've been a chef for 17 years and have dined at wonderful restaurants for most of my life. That said, DEL POSTO topped my list of WORST SERVICE. I've been a fan at the Batali/ Bastianich establishments for almost 14 years and have spent a small fortune at their places, going to at least one of the restaurants (mostly Babbo, Lupa and Eataly) at LEAST once a week. I had such a terrible evening at DEL POSTO that I never want to spend another dime at any of their places (this is the second time I've had a horrible experience there.)The main points (there were SO MANY problems):Let me preface these points that I never tell anyone I'm a chef, I do tastings on my employers behalf and I really, really love food, so even a great taco from a truck would make me happy. I just did not expect to be treated so rudely and have to spend so much money to be treated like that! This sort of behavior is ok from the overworked, underpaid deli clerk, but not here. Our server ELIZABETH was SO RUDE, snapped at us several times, threw a fit when we weren't ready (even though we had just been seated and hadn't even received the menu), rolled her eyes and snorted in disgust when I asked a question, never ONCE came to see about our food until she dropped off the check (2 hours later!) She only thanked and acknowledged my BF when she dropped off the check (I mean come on! Two diners at a table and you only thank the man? Both people are eating!) didn't even look at me once, even though I ordered, paid and had questions. She actually tried to make us feel stupid when I asked what the shrimp dish was- it's called ""CACCIUCCO with Burrida & Sweet Shrimp alla Buzara"" and I asked how it was cooked. She responded with a snort, a look of disbelief Â and finally an exasperated ""It's a STEW!"" When I asked about the ""Cesare's Domestic CULATELLO due"" she rolled her eyes and said ""IT'S PROSCUITTO! are you ready to order yet??"" Geez, I'm sorry, I was wondering where it's from? Her response ""Italy!"" Um, duh lady, I meant what region. The food runner (Asian guy with Black glasses) was so polite and knowledgeable, I hope the managers promote him soon.  We called the next day to talk to a manager and he just made excuses on her behalf, saying ""She's ITALIAN, maybe you had an issue with her European service."" Well, I worked in Paris, and at Daniel, went to a French school and never had to deal with this sort of behavior. Bill came out $600-not worth the attitude. Go ANYWHERE else. I feel REALLY bad for the chefs who work so hard to put out wonderful food and have ELIZABETH the MOST OBNOXIOUS SERVER ever to represent their food.

A warning bell should have sounded at the bar where we were waiting for a table -- a glass of wine was $50. I figured they had to be kidding (if only).Dinner is by ""tasting menu"" only. There are two. Not being voraciously hungry, we picked the smaller of these, priced at $115 each, along with ""paired wines,"" an extra $95 each. The wines are served as splashes -- three ounces of wine that barely cover the bottom of the glass. (The wines themselves were a little odd, inasmuch as they're supposed to be very special and high-end: one was an Antinori, which I don't believe fits that description; the other was made at a vineyard owned by the family of owner Mario Battali's partner, Lidia Bastianich. Hmm.)Two of the courses we were served were pasta -- also odd. One of these contained about 10 little noodles. A small steak I got was remarkably tough and sinewy for a joint with such high-class airs; my companion was served a piece of duck that was so under-cooked she actually gagged on it, and couldn't finish.The bill was nearly $600. And we were still a little hungry when we left.This barn-like place is awash in pretentiousness. Apart from the usual swarm of servers and the unctuous captain, little fat floor pillows are provided on which ladies may rest their handbags (assuming they can't deal with just slinging them over the backs of their chairs).Del Posto withers in comparison to Daniel, the city's top French restaurant. Daniel charges similarly high prices, but the food is so exquisite (and plentiful -- Del Posto's portions are laughably minute) that it's worth every penny. Â This place belongs in the roiling Meat Packing District, home of so much other arrant crap.

Â The saving grace was the service (which was impeccable), the wine list and the atmosphere (which is luxe and elegant). Â But the food was definitely lacking. Â We sampled the five course tasting menu. Â The spaghetti was undercooked, not even al dente. Â Shame, shame!!! Â Chewy, almost crispy spaghetti. Â The duck AND the carne cruda were unusually tough, I actually had to chew for over 3 minutes and spit one piece out. Very embarrassing. Â A couple items were way too salty....this is not MacDonald's french fries we are seasoning folks! Â Some basic missteps that should not be happening at a restaurant of this caliber. Â Unfortunately I think Batali and Bastianich need to get back in the kitchen and do some supervising. Â The floor and front of the restaurant is running smoothly but the kitchen must have some issues.POSITIVES: Â One thing that stood out as divine was the raw veal and tuna cubetti. Â Truly heavenly. Â The orecchiette with lamb sausage and minted soybeans was wonderful. Â The desert chef was also on his/her game sending out exquisite samplings! Â Loved the chocolate truffles.

Â Great service what one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.

Â I've been there once before and I remember the pasta in particular was excellent. Â This time, and it may be just my taste, the pasta and risotto was just a bit too adente. Â Pasta should not be soft and limp, but in this case it was almost hard which is strange as I've been to several of Batali's restaurants both in NYC and Las Vegas and never had this problem. Â Maybe the style was supposed to be this way, I think it was a Venetian style pasta. Â The Risotto was also hard with a bite, I prefer creamy risotto that is soft. Â Actually the amuse bouche was actually one of the highlights of the meal with a tomato soup (great, cold and refreshing), lobster sandwich (a bit of spice and clear taste of lobster), and a prosicutto wrapped with sour vegetable (not my cup of tea a bit too sour).Overall, not as good as the first time I went 2 or 3 years back in terms of food but maybe it's just the style of food I'm not used too.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Batalli and his partners have yet to fail me!Both my hubby and I had the ""Lunch prix fixe menu for $39"" PLUS the pasta dish (they charge $10 each person and bring a plate of pasta for the table). The portions of this lunch menu are relatively small, so if you're hungry, definitely order the additional pasta ($10). Everything was exquisite and very creative. I recommend the VEAL AGNOLOTTI as the pasta dish-it melts in your mouth! It is perfectly cooked and seasoned and it has a dash of grinded coffee beans over it which gives it this interesting robust flavor!!And for dessert, I recommend the CARROT CAKE with Sage gelato.

Â I had been craving a good bowl of pasta since my doctor told me I should avoid gluten in large quantities. Â When I found out Del Posto was offering gluten-free versions of almost every pasta dish on their menu, I knew I had to give it a try and oh I am so happy I did. Thomas Keller's Cup 4 Cup gluten-free flour blend does the trick. Â We tried Yesterday's 100 Layer Lasagna, which was a piece of art--50 layers of thin lasagna sheets with 50 layers of bolognese, basciamella, and marinara sauce. Â You are served a slice of this lasagna after it has been seared in olive oil so the pasta has a little extra crunch. Â It was good, but not if you're expecting traditional lasagna with lots of sauce and cheese. Â What I found to be more divine was the veal agnolotti--little ravioli-like pastas that came with split peas and very, very, very delicious crispy morels. Â The best part of it all? Â I could not tell any of this was gluten-free pasta, and neither could my husband who had the same pastas that were not gluten-free. Â And, to wrap up this gluten-free talk, they also gave me some gluten-free rice puffers at the beginning of our meal since I couldn't have any of the bread in the bread basket. Besides the pasta, all the other dishes we tried were just as good. Â The lobster and octopus appetizers were done perfectly as were our lamb and salmon entrees. Dessert was the least memorable, but the butterscotch semifreddo and chocolate-cherry tartufo were still satisfying. Â We also received some complimentary sweets.

We loved our table on the second level of the restaurant, which allowed us to see everyone below. The noise level was also so gratifyingly perfect -- I could actually hear everyone at the table.The six of us had the 5-course tasting menu, starting with the tiny cup of tomato-bread soup, a chickpea fritter, and a crab and caviar sandwich (with perilla, some kind of mint). We then enjoyed antipasti: for me, this was the roots, nuts, and fruits salad, which looked more like art than a salad (but tasted amazing - lots of fresh root vegetables and extremely thinly sliced apples). Others got the carpaccio, the lobster, and the raw veal and tuna -- complete satisfaction.We chose the pansoti (ricotta dumplings in a truffle butter sauce) and the orchiette with lamb neck ragu (so rich!) for our primi dishes. Both were fantastic.For secondi dishes, three of us ordered the lamb. It was absolutely magnificent -- so tender and paired perfectly with the dollop of yogurt and chickpeas. Others had the lobster, the swordfish, and the black bass.Dessert was ... in a word ... ridiculous. We took a look at the menu, and determined that we would prefer to go with the ""chef's assortment."" Well, the chef's assortment was just the chef sending out one of each dessert to each of us! The gelatos were very impressive, especially the strength of the sage flavor. I was underwhelmed by the olive oil (it just tasted oddly sweet to me). The chocolate was fabulous. The cakes they were paired with were also wonderful: ricotta chocolate, chestnut, and so many more. Finally, we were treated to complimentary sweets from the chef: a tiny ice cream pop, champagne caramel, dehydrated grapefruit, a tiny fruit tart, bitter chocolate...Sigh. 4 hours later, we were incredibly satisfied.

I always have my doubts on celebrity chef restaurants, but it's a combined idea by Joe, Lydia, and Mario. So, I'm thinking the holy trinity of epicurean decadence.Together, they left my palate in utter destruction from a nuclear bomb of flavor and my stomach full to the point of understanding why they call it the Meatpacking District.After some enjoyable cocktails from Pegu Club, the trio of my mom, my best friend, and myself moved onto Del Posto. So, the good-company-and-good-conversation part was under control.The atmosphere of the establishment is that of a 1930s Art Deco men's club and I was quite surprised NOT to see Duke Ellington and his band swingin' in the back corner. The soft din of the restaurant was just right and the service was sharp, quick, warm, and friendly. Our captain, Piero, had vast food knowledge and probably knew the menu better than he knew his own children. Our sommelier, Frederico, was outstanding. I had mentioned something about the stemware being from Movia and he noticed that I had some wine knowledge he kept coming over to strike up conversation when he poured some more delicious wine into our glasses.The food, in succinct terms, was a journey to the very heart of Italian cooking in terms of a chef that wants to expand and explode the barriers that constrict the notions of traditional Italian gastronomy.Hmmm...in other words it was Italian, but it wasn't. It was inventive and ridiculously delicious.Also, try as many different types of pasta as you can. I think I carbo-loaded enough to complete in an IronMan Triathalon followed by a jaunt up Mount Everest...without a sherpa.One of the best parts of the evening was the dessert. We picked the chocolate and rum pairing. It was four different levels of chocolate delight paired with rums from different countries. Sounds decadent. But the best was when Piero was going over where the rums came from he said, ""One from Martinique, one from Haiti, one from Venezuela..."" And then my mom, without skipping a beat said, ""What is it...the Chavez?"" Piero has to excuse himself for a minute while he walked away laughing his head off. Yes, my mom broke the waiter.

It was a nice way to start off the meal... then we opted for the 5 course tasting.... first we started with the lobster d avlo and the beef carpaccio.. my choice would be the beef carparrcio since (I am usually not a fan of flowers and what not on my food) but it went amazingly well... the seasoning was right on and i really enjoyed the carpaccio. The lobster on the other hand was GOOD but lacked the ""IT"" factor that we were looking for.... kind of average. The pastas were my favorite part of the meal.... We chose the veal agnolotti and the 100 layer lasagna... WOW to both. loved the flavors of the agnolotti as it went beautifully with the sauce they poured at the end.... the lasagna has such a delicate yet powerful (does that make sense LOL) sauce that enveloped the lasagna. LOVELY. For our main we chose the steak and the truffled sole. Sole was waaaaay better than the steak. Soft, light, fluffy. Could not really taste or smell the truffle in the butter sauce they used though (usually i can smell truffle instantaneously) ..... I was expecting a lil bit more PUNCH on that. The steak was a bit tough and chewy. Not recommended. Probably the most disappointing dish we ordered.....on to dessert..... the chocolate dome thing (not sure what it was) dish was OKAY. my dessert... the butterscotch semifreddo was superb. The sweet and tangy was a nice combination and it was an awesome way to end the meal. WINE- Got the wine paring and it was VERY GOOD :) So glad I opted for that as wine complemented the dishes very well. SERVICE- For the most part it was good.... they are very attentive and the bussers are pretty on it too.... One thing I MUST mention is that our waiter was not very familiar with some of the dishes since he stumbled at least 4 times when explaining the dish of amuse bouse.

At what point I am not sure but while we were outside we asked him NICELY if he would take a photo for us. WELL WELL WELL, he seemed like he was so IRRATATED and obviously did not want to take the photo for us. While he snapped the photo he took so long that when it flashed we moved (obviously a BAD photo) he saw the photo but just gave it back to us. WOW. his attitude just KILLED the food we ate.

Â As an unabashed carnivore, Cesare's 30 month aged prosciutto caught my eye in the antipasti section. Â The waiter told me the whole story. Â In their final months, the little piggies are fed an exclusive diet of parmiggiano. Â Uhhh, yeah in my final months, I wish I could have that type of diet. Â The result? Â The marbled fat of the prosciutto has the most subtle parmesan flavor. Â Amazing. Â It was honestly the best prosciutto I've ever had.We were also given an assortment of breads, which were accompanied with creamy butter...and rosemary infused lardo. Â What? Â Rosemary pork fat spread? Â How does that work? Â Jesus.Next came the pastas. Â The table didn't really chose these. Â Our waiter just told us what we were going to get. Â And we nodded because whatever he described just sounded succulent. Â He told us to get the ricotta pansotti with asparagus and truffle butter. Â Pansotti is a type of ravioli/dumpling -- it means potbelly, which basically, means that it is totally stuffed with delicious ricotta. Â The pasta is made in house. Â And uhhh. Â Yeah. Â The suave ricotta. Â The pansotti. Â The delicious truffle butter goodness. Â Next came one of the most marvelous pastas that I've ever had. Â I will defer to Mr. Sam Sifton's food prose here -- "" his spaghetti with Dungeness crab, sliced jalapeÃ±o and minced scallion arrives like the sun. It is a dish that speaks directly to Mr. Ladner's genius, to a view of Italian cooking that allows for both jalapeÃ±o and Dungeness crab."" Â Yes, it did arrive like the sun. Â It was al dente to the max, but hey, it just worked. Â The little pieces of crab. Â The jalapeno seeds. Â It was spicier than what we had anticipated, but neither ingredient overwhelmed the other. Â It was transcendent.For the secondi, I ordered the sliced duck breast (medium rare, of course). Â The waiter then brought a little pot over with a piece of seared fois gras. Â He then drizzled the jus over the duck. Â The dish came with endives and candied melons covered in bread crumbs. Â The melons were deliciously sweet and provided a nice complement to the the bold taste of the duck.My cousins ordered a black bass in a tomato sauce with some squid ink drizzled on top. Â Another ordered a swordfish. Â Alas, neither are on the menu online, but both were excellent. Â The swordfish in particular. Â My cousin's husband ordered the steak, which was a $20 supplement. Â I thought it was pretty good, but definitely not as good as the other main dishes.Desserts were equally divine. Â I had the chocolate ricotta tartino, which came with a ball of the most amazing olive oil gelato ever. Â Seriously, this may have been the best gelato ever. Â It sounds weird, but I assure you it's magnificent. Â I can't think of anymore adjectives right now. Â Another dessert that was amazing was the coffee tartuffo.Finally, and finally, there were the little sweets for the road. Â Chocolate covered olive oil ice cream -- a lollipop of sorts. Â A champagne caramel with edible wrapper. Â A little fried creampuff. Â Candied strawberry. Â Mini fruit pie. Â And a bitter, pure cacao charcoal like thing. Â It was different.This was one of the best meals I've ever had. Â I have no problems saying that. Â There was no one bad dish. Â They were all good to divine. Â  Â  Â I'm getting hungry now. Â My wallet is a bit lighter so maybe I'll fast for a bit.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

My favorite part of the meal was probably the appetizers, the calamari friti was highly recommended by our waiter. He said it was the best you'll ever have. He was absolutely right. The texture was just perfect, unlike anything I've had, and the dressing was slightly spicy, zesty and delicious.We also ordered broccoli which is normally not my cup of tea (in fact, I hate it). But I think they used the leaves instead of the florets. It was actually good, bitter. I think my dad would have leap for joy and have a heart attack if he found out I actually ate broccoli and liked it. (Yes, I am a child when it comes to eating my vegetables but I blame my parents for never forcing me to eat veggies when I was growing up!) Now some people at our table ordered the crispy duck (I didn't try it) and they thought it was fabulous. I had the orrechiette with lamb ragu and well, the pasta itself was a little too al dente for me (and I like al dente!). Also, I think there were pieces of cartilage in the meat? Some of the pieces were a little chewy. It was ok, but I would have expected waaaay more from an Italian restaurant of this caliber. Perhaps it has something to do with how late we arrived?

923,Nzs6fyjJveWXz18NnoZgUw,Sarene L.,5.0 star rating,"Hello favorite new restaurant ever!My parents took me and my siblings to Del Posto for my birthday dinner last night and it had to be one of the most pleasant dining experiences I've had in a very long time.My family and I (hubby included) are devotees of the Mario Batali-Joe Bastianich brand of restaurant (between New York and Las Vegas we can probably count on our hands the number of restaurants we HAVEN'T been to), so it didn't come as a shock at all that we were absolutely delighted with Del Posto. To echo several previous reviewers, the food was divine, the service absolutely impeccable and the ambiance beyond compare. I learned early on that the service was the best in the business when I ordered a Diet Coke -- and my mom joked that I'll have it with some honey on the side because I had lost my voice -- and the waiter brought me the Diet Coke with honey on the side!What impressed me the most about Del Posto's decor was how it differentiated from the usually more rustically designed Â Batali-Bastianich locations (Babbo, Lupa, Otto). Del Posto is darker and sleeker -- with a balcony set up to make you feel that your table is in its own separate dining room, despite several tables occupying the space. It was very entertaining to look down on the expanse of the restaurant -- and even watch the pianist hard at work.Yes, that's another plus to Del Posto -- no piped in music. Last night we were treated to a wide repertoire of live piano music, ranging from selections from Disney animated features (""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""The Little Mermaid""), Elton John tunes, Broadway and Tin Pan Alley standards.Now, on to the food: As mentioned by other reviewers, the meal begins with an amuse-bouche that consisted of a shot of gazpacho with celery salt around the rim, salmon mousse served between thin pastry, and prosciutto-and-bread-crumb balls. Nothing I ate was any less than delicious, so I'll just say that from the start. And the white wine my dad ordered (one of ""Joe's wines"") was light, crisp and complemented every dinner portion. The bread basket was nothing more than carb heaven, and I highly recommend sampling everything inside. Don't forget the butter and lardo spread!For an appetizer I had Lidia's lobster salad (Lidia Bastianich is also a co-owner along with her son Joe and Mr. Batali), which consisted of three large pieces of lobster doused in a tangy tomato sauce. My entree was the pennette with porcini mushrooms and tuna in a spicy tomato sauce. The portion sizes were positively perfect -- I felt completely satisfied without feeling uncomfortably full.Dessert was Lidia's sweet pea cake (yeah, it was GREEN!) served with mini strawberries and strawberry gelato -- and a plate of petit fours that is complimentary with every meal. Honestly, I would have been more than content with the petit fours (hello? Nutella croquettes and hazelnut and white chocolate feuillatine? Amazing), but I am SO happy I tried the sweet pea cake -- and strawberry is my new favorite gelato flavor.Upon our departure we were each handed a small box of chocolates -- haven't even sampled them yet. But I can't wait! Since my husband couldn't join us last night, I insist we return next year for our anniversary dinner.As I told my mom -- ""Del Posto isn't exactly a place you go to when you're just feeling a little peckish.

After a week of eating all over NYC, from the streets to fine rooms, from Brooklyn to Manhattan, this meal may have been the least exciting we had.Maybe if the bill had been $40 a head instead of $115, we might have felt different. But shelling out that amount of money sets the bar much higher and Del Posto failed to meet it. We had the 5-course prix fixe. A few dishes were really good. The charred octopus appetizer was great, cooked so perfectly (but no better than the octopus at Roberta's in Brooklyn). The lobster fra diavolo appetizer definitely stood out. The star of the meal was probably the bread basket, with mini-baguettes, ciabatta, focaccia, all served warm, with two kinds of butter, it was all excellent.On the down side, the pork trio entree was dreadful. The main part of the trio, a loin, was so tough we sent it back. To their credit, the restaurant offered us another entree choice, and then took the price of the entree off of our bill. The caciucco broth was tasty but very very VERY salty, and the seafood in what should be a diverse stew of frutti di mare was small and unexceptional.Our main server, while nice and attentive, seemed in over her head. She had a hard time describing dishes (every time I asked a question, I felt like I was a teacher asking her to stand in the middle of class and recite her lessons. She was halting and unconfident and too quiet to even be heard).The desserts again were OK but none of the four at our table were exceptional. Best was probably the melanzana (who would expect a sweet eggplant dish?). They did bring four nice fresh donuts and left a cookie jar, but none of the cookies were big stars.I've loved Babbo and Lupa, and thought Eska was very close to top shelf, but Mario and Joe just miss with Del Posto.

Â Unfortunately, I didn't get to spend much time admiring the decor; as a large party (13), we were seated upstairs, tucked in a secluded corner, protected by a mini-fort of giant wine bottles and a team of top notch waiters (more on this later).5-course dinner:- Choice of bread, served with butter and pork lardo. Â My bread had seeds on it, wasn't paying too much attention as to what it was called. Â The lardo was flavored with rosemary and had a creamy but gelatinous texture that melted instantly in my Â mouth. Â Some of my dinner mates were a little wary of lardo, but I encourage you to try this -- there's always butter as backup.- Soup (did not get a chance to try), fried risotto balls, prosciutto. Â OK.- Abalone (antipasti): delicate and silky texture, something I noticed much more than the subdued taste.- Ricottta Pansoti & Veal Agnolotti (two primis): The pansoti was good, but admittedly did not captivate me the way my conversations (and assortment of alcohol) did. Â The Veal, encased in little pockets of soft, freshly made pasta, was robust in flavor and smooth in texture. Â The best dish of the night.- Wood-grilled lobster: Solid lobster, but the promised artichokes were strangely absent or the most part - absent, as in I did not remember that artichokes were supposed to even be served until something I poked on the dish turned out to not be lobster. Â Not a big loss, though. Â Lobster is lobster and in this dish, you will get lots of it.- Dessert: Â Assorted everything - on plates, on top of boxes, and even in drawers, ranging from chocolate covered ice cream lollipops, cakes, panna cotta, biscotti, and candy with edible wrappers. Â Everything was delicious. Â I wish I could elaborate more, but there were just too many desserts and I had had too many glasses of wine to bother thinking about my palate.The service:Like most previous reviewers have mentioned, the service is AMAZING. Â The servers stay at a safe distance as to not disturb diners, but somehow manage to remain extremely alert. Â With the exception of one very brief moment, my assortment of glasses (notably my wine glass) was never empty. Â My coworker and I noticed that our napkins were being removed only when we felt gentle breezes across our laps. Â I didn't realize that DP was staffed with NINJAS - their aprons probably double as face masks, which I bet they don after hours in order to scale buildings and flip off roofs anonymously...Also of note: one of my co-workers is allergic to gluten. Â According to her, restaurants usually accommodate this by serving sub-par gluten-free dishes. Â Del Posto paid special attention to her needs and created dishes (especially the pasta) that were comparable in taste to their normal fare. Â They even served her gluten-free desserts in a personal mini-box/drawer.The verdict:The food didn't have the exact 5-star kick that was I looking for (I hold $$$$ restaurants in a different, snootier category and therefore judge them more harshly), but it was definitely good.

My cousin was hired as a line cook and i have been meaning to come in and sample the faire.First of all let me start with saying we came in for a simple lunch. The inside is beautiful, thats the only way to describe it. Trying to describe the interior doesn't do it justice you really have to experience it for yourself. They had a piano player for lunch very classy!!We were shown to our table along a banquette towards the back of the restaurant, and we had to sit side by side which is a little cheesy but I got over it quickly. When our captain came over he asked us if we wanted to see the regular menu,or because i was ""family"" we could have the chef cook for us? (side note if someone asks you if you want the chef to cook for you, you ALWAYS say yes!!!)So began our our Del Posto adventure. All in all we had about 9 courses not including the bouche, intermettzo, or dessert; remember this was for lunch!!Everything was spectatular, the service was flawless and not snobby or pretentious. The captain knew probably every ingredient in every dish, and you could tell he loved what he did and got us excited for every course we sampled.Now onto the food. Some of my favorites were a cauliflower puree with cavier and lobster meat drizzled with a 15 year aged olive oil, ""stinky shoe""pasta with truffle oil and telligio cheese, pumkin tortelloni with a brown butter sauce and fresh truffle (he brought out a truffle the size of your fist and begave shaving it onto the pasta adding; we don't mess around here!) and of course the beef done three was which was expertly cooked (thanks D!)Dessert was an entire production in itself. We were first given plated desserts and as we enjoyed them we were bombarded with cookies,cakes, sorbets, and homemade candies. I especially enjoyed it when our captain smashed the cookie on the table.To say we were treated like celebrites was an understatement, I have actually never in my life have been treated as well as I was at Del Posto.

Â Now, before I go further into my review, I would like to point out one thing: Del Posto does not do Restaurant Week for dinner. Â This is important to note if you go there for dinner anticipating to spend $35 + tax/tip and leave more than $100 poorer two hours later. Â But I digress, as I so often do, because Del Posto is worth every penny.You arrive and a doorman greets you. Â You step into the first foyer and a coat check attendant welcomes you and takes your coat. Â You step up a small staircase and no less than three hostesses welcome you to the restaurant. Â On the way to the table literally four other servers/maitre d's Â say ""good evening."" Â You finally sit down, and that's when things get really good. Â A waiter brings over a footed plate with amuse-bouches (on the house); last night, they had a barley soup drizzled with bitter chocolate, tiny croque-monsieur-type sandwiches, and butternut squash mashed and rolled in hazelnuts (I think). Â After the amuse-bouches, they cleared our plates and cutlery.* Â A bread basket arrives with no less than five types of bread.** Â And two types of spread-- one of which I think was lard, but hey. Â Ok, I've got to drop the second person stuff; it's tiring. Â So anyway, next we ordered glasses of wine on the waiter's suggestion: an Italian (all the wines were Italian) red called Uvaggio-- delicious. Â We ordered fried baby artichokes with marinated clams as an appetizer-- delicious.We ordered a tasting of three of their pastas, cutely named ""Tris"": we had the ricotta nudi with swiss chard ragu, caramelle (tiny ravioli type pasta wrapped to look like caramels and drizzled with butter and black truffles), and garganelli (similar to spinach penne) with bolognese-- again, delicious.Because we just could not stop ourselves, and had nearly full glasses of wine in front of us, we ordered three cheeses. Â We were pretty much stuffed at this point, but then another plate of (complimentary) tiny (sweet) tastes arrived: two bite brownies, shortbread cookies, chocolate cookies, etc.Satisfied with our meal, we paid our bill and left. Â On the way out, the hostess chased after us to give us little boxes of chocolates... on the house.

Well I felt like I was Borat and I instead I seemingly encountered a never ending supply of both food and drinks at Del Posto.Walking in you feel like you are in that scene in Goodfellas where they enter through the kitchen, as EVERY Del Posto worker that I passed greeted me. We had a table on the second floor that overlooked everything and I appreciated my seat being pulled out for me and pushed back in. Thanks Alfred! My party had the 7-course tasting menu along with all the drink pairings. Hey, when the person is paying wants to do it real big you gotta do it real big! The signature items that night were the crudo, ostrich, nudi, lasagne, veal, percorino, and mela. I really should have kept a scorecard with me as there was so much to taste that and I had little comments about everything. But due to all the champagne, wine, and beer that was paired with the meal my memory is a bit hazy dealing with specifics. I remember I really liked the bird's nest style egg -- it's actually listed as bird's nest style on the menu which even makes me a bigger fan. The veal was tender and lasange was solid. I finally got to taste ostrich for the first time, one of the ostrich items was a little bit too chewy for my taste, but there was another form that I dug. My favorite items were two of the deserts: la dolce mela and basil gelato. The apple was warm and sweet and think their should be a food truck that duplicates this masterpiece. I thought that was the topper, but the basil gelato is what really got me. I'm talking two hours after I ate it, I still could taste a bit in my mouth. Even after eating mints, somehow that still lingered on. Definitely not something of this world. Â Yes, I do realize that I might be green when dealing with these types of establishments. But my reviews are for the Fred G. Sanford's of the world and aren't for the jaded folk. I truly felt like I was an episode of Mad Men with the vibe of Del Posto and fortunately I was dressed the part that night. When I become rich I aspire to get my own designated seating area at Del Posto.

937,8iRnvUZknnd7HVvLxkHcZQ,Sara W.,3.0 star rating,"Del Posto: A Cinderella story.I entered this beautiful space and was swept off of my feet: A grand staircase twirled up to semi-balconies fitting proposal-worthy tables for two. Another staircase divided, then cascaded down in front of me into a wine cellar. Wrought iron and tile abounded. The piano played softly but audibly. I felt as if I was in a fairytale.Unfortunately, the night I was there, we were the prince, and Del Posto was Cinderella. It's facade was a beautiful ballgown, the service and food were the rags underneath. Â Ensconced romantically at one of the high-up tables for two, we ordered the chef's tasting menu with wine. The first courses (salad; two bites of alcohol-soaked lobster) were un-Italian and overworked, but we languished over them anyway. Every few minutes, a waiter would ask if we were finished. The waiter would then stand impatiently within my eyeline, seeming nervous that we didn't meet their time frame. Twice, a waiter put his hands on our plates prematurely. Romantic, it wasn't.Then, a ruckus. Our risotto had been burned - could we wait a few minutes for a new batch? Of course we would! We exhaled, and relaxed. To tide us over during our food intermission, three beautiful bonbons of warm pasta filled with cheese were placed in front of us. This was the best course by far, and the only one not on the menu! Alas, the risotto, when it actually arrived, was oversalted and undercooked to the point of crunchy. We didn't eat it, and no one asked why. More bonbons, please! Â The remaining courses (a meat, dessert) were good, but not astounding. The wines were exceptional, but were whisked away too quickly, the last sips untaken.The wait staff eased off a bit as the meal came to a close, but who's meal was it anyway? As a result of the staff's behavior, I felt rushed and self conscious nearly the whole time. The gorgeousness of Del Posto's surroundings and the size of the tab imply a high standard of cuisine and service, and Del Posto didn't measure up. Cinderella, though beautiful, was in tatters on the inside and not ready for the glamorous life. Thank goodness the cab didn't turn into a pumpkin on the way home.

I expected to taste fresh italian, and maybe some memorable strong flavors. Â I didn't get that. Â Portions were not generous. Â No big complaints, but only 1 dish was A++ in my opinion.1- Del Posto Antipasto del Carello: sampling of 5 different antipastos.. hit or miss.

Â pasta pillows were delicate yet al dente. The sauce had wonderful flavor, very balanced.4- 100 Layer Lasagne: I was very excited for this one. Â Turned out to be a total let down.

942,S7zqpZY2akKdZyiVQAJWxw,Adam D.,2.0 star rating,"Let me make something clear right up front--I don't like Mario Batali. I've never left a restaurant of his with a positive impression, and on his show, ""Spain: On the Road Again"" with Gwyneth Paltrow--or Gee Pee as he likes to call her--he's a total sausage-fingered douchebag who says ""baby"" all the time when talking to people and jiggles around the country with a cavalier entitlement that seems to disrespect the very culture he's documenting. Â (Really, that show should just be the two women eating and talking in Spanish.) But, I digress. Fortunately, my ignorance preceded me when I made a reservation at Del Posto, since I had no awareness that it was a Batali-connected establishment, and as such I had an open, unadulterated view of what was to come. And then it came, leaving me feeling dirty and unfulfilled. I'll start with the positive--the service. Everyone there is extremely accommodating, professional, and attentive--and without pretension. The bartender was talkative without being chatty and his mixes were quality--though I do with, a with all bartenders, that he would measure out his ingredients to ensure consistency. The prices at Del Posto are ridiculous when compared to the quality of food. (I'll address quantity later.). I don't mind exorbitant meals--in fact, I love them--but a price tag establishes a certain expectation. Without a single entree under $30 and the only salad being $21, you think to yourself, ""I'm in for a seriously delicious meal."" Or, I better be.Well, be it was not. We split the Yellow Fin & Tail carpachio, which tasted pretty good but was nothing extraordinary. Â We paired it with two glasses of rose champagne. She had the Arctic char and I had the Berkshire pork chop. I rarely order pork chops in restaurants but there are moments where I'm intrigued and eager to have someone else prepare me some juicy, bone-in, meaty goodness. They have a ""special"" way of preparing the pork chop: cook it bone-in, take it off the bone, wrap the bone in prosciutto, and then cook the bone some more. We paired our entrees with a half-bottle of an Italian grape who's name is escaping me. (Italy has the highest concentration of grape varietals in the world--over 2000 compared to France's 600--and when you get an Italian wine list as deep as Del Posto's, choosing is something I let the sommelier take care of.)The pork chop was tough, and tiny, and without much in the way of accompaniments. But the bone was yummy, as I expected, because how can you not succeed when pairing prosciutto with fatty-bone goodness. Her Arctic char was cooked nicely but, like mine, was lonely on its plate. (Read: We're still hungry.)Bring on dessert. Every dessert on the Del Posto menu is $15. Damn, bro. I feel used. Not even a single profiterole, or some ice cream, or a tiny little bite-sized tart to finish my meal without thrusting it further inside me until I choke? $15 desserts are ""going out on a limb"" prices. At that point you've really made a statement about the quality and ingenuity of every single dessert on the menu; that is, if the prices are logical, which they are not. She got this apple-crepe thingy catastrophe; I got a chocolate-pistachio tart paired with olive oil ice cream. Mine was good--not $15 good--but good, and really small. Â The olive oil ice cream was actually great. Her's was just terrible, a leaning tower of tastes collapsing more with every bite. When she doesn't eat well, I don't eat well, and it was a bad note to leave on. Oh, and the $320 bill--split appetizer, two entrees, two desserts, and a half bottle of wine--sure cemented the decision that there was no need to venture this far to be handled this rough. Given the service and the quality selection of drinks and liquor, I would give this place a 2.5 star review. The food is not terrible, and I'm sure some of the dishes that we didn't try are great, but it pales in comparison to places like Eleven Madison and Le Bouchon, and neither of which have the same level of exceptionally high pricing on every single menu item.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Â He was very knowledgeable and personable. Â Such a refreshing change from how Batali's other restaurants have given me the impression that he only hires staff that are rude and obnoxious.The food was very very flavorful. Â If there was anything to complain about the food, it would be that they were all a bit on the oily side. Â But otherwise, we tried appetizers of fried calamari, grilled octopus and sliced sunchokes. Â They were all really delicious and prepared as they should be. Â The calamari was battered and fried, resulting in pieces that were tender on the inside but very crispy on the outside. Â The octopus was also very tender and well-seasoned. Â We tried the orrechiette with lamb and the spinach garganelli with classic bolognese. Â The orrechiette had a lovely spongey texture and was very fatty and tasty. Â The bolognese had an unctuousness that could only have come with hours of braising.For dessert, we tried a few items - the chocolate cake, apple fritters, lemon cream-filled bomboloni, roasted dates with mascarpone sorbet and the cherry and almond cake.

Â The restaurant is a well-oiled machine that works perfectly. Â How a restaurant can get you to spend a minimum of $400 over a 3.5 hour dinner and then make you think it was the most incredible experience...well, that's a mystery. I am gluten-free and was shocked that basically everything on the menu could be made gluten-free without sacrificing on flavor at all. Â To feel like a normal human being in a restaurant - an experience to savor. I was pleased to see that there were several relatively inexpensive bottles of wine on the menu (I saw at least a few in the low $40 range). Â We went with a classic Rose, which was $60 - clean, crisp, light and perfect for the dishes we chose. Â The amuse bouche trio was mind-blowing itself. Â A savory soup that encapsulated the taste of umami; a reconstruction of black truffle pasta, and a mini crab slider. Â Then came what is usually my least favorite part of the meal - the bread basket. I normally stare at it with envy/distaste/regret/shame and try to distract myself with more wine (basically, a bad date). Â But the staff brought me gluten free focaccia! Â I haven't had bread that good in years - soft and light, and not dense or chewy like most gf breads. For my appetizer, I chose the pumpkin salad, which was an amazing choice. Â The chefs produced another miracle - they managed to transform roasted vegetables into jam-coated candy, and it was as good as it sounds. Â The bf ordered the truffled beef and enjoyed it as well. Â For our two tastes of pasta, we ordered the pumpkin cappellaci and the spicy crab spaghetti. Some reviewers note that these are mere tastes or bites, but the portions are really quite substantial when you realize you still have an entrÃ©e and dessert coming. Â I was already full after the pastas. Â Oh, and they were really good. Â Again, the gluten free pasta tasted exactly like pasta! My bf compared my pasta to his pasta and confirmed. Â That's another great thing - if you have a food allergy/intolerance but your partner wants to eat as much gluten/dairy/nuts as possible and doesn't care about eating with you in solidarity, it's totally possible! Â The pumpkin pasta was out of this world - creamy from the cheese/pumpkin and bit of crunch from the crumble topping. Â I also liked the crab pasta - the amount of crab was on the light side, but I generally don't eat very much crab so I was fine with that. For my entrÃ©e, I ordered the special, which was a neatly compartmentalized chicken in the most flavorful savory mushroom broth with wild mushrooms so meaty they tasted like, well, meat. Â I could've eaten that all night, but second stomach was urging me to save room for dessert. Â Dessert arrived and second stomach was not disappointed.

962,D--62HpENGxn-b0ppMHdyw,Nicole T.,5.0 star rating,"Your wallet will be lighter at the end of your meal at Del Posto, but it's one of the few dining experiences that is totally worth it. Â The restaurant is a well-oiled machine that works perfectly. Â How a restaurant can get you to spend a minimum of $400 over a 3.5 hour dinner and then make you think it was the most incredible experience...well, that's a mystery. I am gluten-free and was shocked that basically everything on the menu could be made gluten-free without sacrificing on flavor at all. Â To feel like a normal human being in a restaurant - an experience to savor. I was pleased to see that there were several relatively inexpensive bottles of wine on the menu (I saw at least a few in the low $40 range). Â We went with a classic Rose, which was $60 - clean, crisp, light and perfect for the dishes we chose. Â The amuse bouche trio was mind-blowing itself. Â A savory soup that encapsulated the taste of umami; a reconstruction of black truffle pasta, and a mini crab slider. Â Then came what is usually my least favorite part of the meal - the bread basket. I normally stare at it with envy/distaste/regret/shame and try to distract myself with more wine (basically, a bad date). Â But the staff brought me gluten free focaccia! Â I haven't had bread that good in years - soft and light, and not dense or chewy like most gf breads. For my appetizer, I chose the pumpkin salad, which was an amazing choice. Â The chefs produced another miracle - they managed to transform roasted vegetables into jam-coated candy, and it was as good as it sounds. Â The bf ordered the truffled beef and enjoyed it as well. Â For our two tastes of pasta, we ordered the pumpkin cappellaci and the spicy crab spaghetti. Some reviewers note that these are mere tastes or bites, but the portions are really quite substantial when you realize you still have an entrÃ©e and dessert coming. Â I was already full after the pastas. Â Oh, and they were really good. Â Again, the gluten free pasta tasted exactly like pasta! My bf compared my pasta to his pasta and confirmed. Â That's another great thing - if you have a food allergy/intolerance but your partner wants to eat as much gluten/dairy/nuts as possible and doesn't care about eating with you in solidarity, it's totally possible! Â The pumpkin pasta was out of this world - creamy from the cheese/pumpkin and bit of crunch from the crumble topping. Â I also liked the crab pasta - the amount of crab was on the light side, but I generally don't eat very much crab so I was fine with that. For my entrÃ©e, I ordered the special, which was a neatly compartmentalized chicken in the most flavorful savory mushroom broth with wild mushrooms so meaty they tasted like, well, meat. Â I could've eaten that all night, but second stomach was urging me to save room for dessert. Â Dessert arrived and second stomach was not disappointed. I ordered the Butterscotch semifreddo, which many have mentioned, is wonderful. Â It is not overly sweet and it is completely perfect. Â Except maybe I wanted more of it. Â Finally, the dessert box to seal the deal. Â I think our server said something ludicrous about eating only one part of the box if you had already eaten dessert (instead of a cheese plate) but I obviously ate all of the mini desserts in the box. Â They even make gluten-free versions of desserts the size of my pinky finger. So thoughtful! I was really sad to leave.

For starters, I didn't know how ""reserved"" the restaurant was (maybe I didn't do my research prior to attending the restaurant) so I stuck out like a sore thumb when I walked into the restaurant wearing a BRIGHT, ORANGE dress while everyone else was wearing black and white, suit/jacket attire. The food was of good quality but made up of pretentious portions and I left hungry. Our waiter almost had a heart attack when my boyfriend told him the bomboloni were the best part of the entire meal (he has a big sweet tooth), as if it was some insult to the chef and his food. After a nearly $400 bill, they ""gave"" us a box of 3 mini biscotti as a gift. After that bill, I would hope we weren't leaving there empty handed because the meal was not worth the money we paid.

968,ZGbauWtUZA55s95rs0ySgA,Nat W.,1.0 star rating,"How To Waste 4 Hours of Your Saturday Night:Do you want to spend $800 Â for a disappointing dinner for four and have this unenjoyable experience drag on for four hours? If so, you should check out Del Posto. If you like pounded, dehydrated and salted meat, make a reservation at Del Posto. If you want to sit at a fancy restaurant listening to the booming bass from the bar next door while thinking about how the food you made for dinner last night tasted better, then this is the place for you. In all: Worst $800 meal for a group of 4, EVER! ... Â SAVE YOURSELF (and your wallet) and find another restaurant. I believe this is the first single star rating I have awarded - and I am honestly not even sure if Del Posto deserved one star. My complaints are as follows:1. We waited 45 minutes from the time we sat down for our first round of drinks. Enough said. 2. Being a sentient being, I prefer to make my own decisions. All four of us ordered the 5 course tasting menu for something like $115 per person. However, we were informed that all four of us had to come to a consensus about which two pastas we would like to have for our 2nd and 3rd courses. Why on earth should I have to decide on and split two pastas with the other 3 people at my table? Why can't I choose my own 2nd and 3rd course?!? Don't I have my own preferences, taste and decision making abilities? Last time I checked, nobody should have to pay 115 to coordinate their 2nd and 3rd courses with the rest of the table. 3. A general inability to appropriately name dishes. I ordered the insulate VERDURE. Now, being that the name of the salad says ""Greenery"", I was expecting my plate to have a lot of green on it. When it arrived, I noticed that a mere 10-15 % of the items on my plate were green. The rest? Brown. Not only was I looking forward to some foliage, but the brown bits were just not delicious - soggy lumps of poorly prepared brown stuff. This became a theme throughout each of our courses at Del Posto: Worst attempt at naming dishes. It was as if they were trying to be funny? I'm not sure, but they should know not to come in-between me and my verdure. 4. Back to the pasta. Our group of 4 decided on the frutti di mare and the lasagna. I will start with the former. The seafood was mushy. I took a bite of the calamari and the shrimp and wondered what had happened. Why were they limp, mushy bits of seafood? Were these previously frozen and then tortured into submission? I don't know. Not only was the result not pleasing, but I couldn't help but feel bad for the little creatures. The lasagna was a surprising disappointment. I thought lasagna was safe. It was dry, salty, otherwise flavorless and completely unappetizing. It amounted to an extremely thin sliver of charred, dry layers of pasta laid out flat on my plate. ... It was at about this time during the dinner that I found myself looking longingly towards the window and in the direction of Morimoto! Good food was just across the street! Why did I come here? Was this dinner ever going to end? 5. This experience was analogous to a game of ""Oregon Trail"" ... long periods of time with no food. Then, when you get hungry, someone gives you a piece of dry, salted meat. YUM! My 4th course was the pork three ways, however, I only detected one method of preparation: pounded thin, dehydrated and heavily salted. ... For the record: I think the food on Oregon Train would have tasted better. Â 6. Why did I have to spend the last 2 hours Â (of a FOUR HOUR DINNER) listening to both jazz and pounding bass from the club / bar next door? Why are we forking over so much cash to be trapped at a table for four hours while listening to the loud and pervasive ""boom ... boom boom boom"" while attempting to have a conversation? Why did Del Posto still have their jazz / classical sirius station on? Why were my ears being assaulted with so many different types of sounds? I thought I was supposed to be at a nice restaurant! Why was I worried our waitress would bring out a round of jello shots with our dehydrated, salted meat?6. This is what you call panna cotta? Being a bit of a panna cotta connoisseur, I was pleased to find it as an option on the dessert menu. It was not good ... at all. I can't even describe to you why and how it disappointed me, as I was so exhausted by this restaurant by the time the dessert arrived. 7. Why was the check presented as if it were a hotel bill? Was that done to be pretentious or to let us know that people often get so bored during their long dinner that they go upstairs and take a nap in-between courses? If it was the latter --- why didn't anyone tell me???",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Â But last year NYT gave it a glowing review, making it the only 4-star Italian restaurant in New York now. Â Bread service was interesting as it came with butter and lard. Â Lard with bread was new to me - it was good, but it gets to be a little too much more quickly than butter. Â Amuse bouche was a punch of flavors - nice way to start the meal. Â Calamari was the best I've ever tasted - great execution with a great sauce. Â Zampone had excellent texture and flavors (because of the pig leg casing, this one is for the more adventurous eaters) - the best appetizer I've had in a long time. Â Cappelacci was creamy and perfectly cooked, but the interior was scolding hot - I burned my mouth eating it. Â The kitchen should have let it rest a bit longer. Â Garganelli was al dente, but the ragu was a touch too salty. Â Cacciucco was disappointing, as the prawn and lobster were both slightly overcooked and tasted as if they have been frozen and defrosted (the slight fishy taste). Â Lamb was tender and juicy. Â But the lamb jus was too salty. Â Desserts were quite strong. Â Tortino was good, but the real star was the EVOO gelato - surprisingly refreshing and balanced - amazing. Â Tartufo was textbook - great texture and flavors. Â The cheese-filled donuts were good, but nothing special. Â Cappuccino was sublime. Â  Service was superb, if a bit stern. Â The dining room was grand in a old-world masculine way - great for a special occasion. Â There were some real flashes of genius here. Â I will remember that zampone for a long time! Â Unfortunately, several misses (especially the heavy-handed salting) force me to give a 4. Â So coming from Chicago, it is inevitable to compare this with Spiaggia, which is the only 4-star Italian according to the Chicago Tribune. Â Well, I think it's a tie for now. Â Del Posto wins on appetizers, desserts, and overall dining experience, but Spiaggia is still better in pasta and secondi. Â Both are great, but not perfect.

976,_tpq0nA53NgmonUIOQvXlQ,Mike E.,5.0 star rating,"Just completed the epic 7-course ""menu tradizionale"" tasting here. Firstly, you need to acknowledge the name of the tasting, because overall this is about brilliantly executed, fine Italian food anchored firmly in the tradition. This is a careful culinary exploration of Italy, rather than an attempt to creatively reinterpret or over think the cuisine. Each dish felt excellently composed and technically exquisite, and yet you know there is always an underlying deep respect for the traditional. Highlights - 1. Exquisite antipasto platter - Dressed hearts of escarole with anchovy dressing, balsamic baby artichoke hearts, chicken dill salad in a radicchio cup, turnip and shellfish salad. In the middle, a delicious nugget; fried gnocchi wrapped in 30 month prosciutto from the Cotto factory in Parma. Served with an aromatic, Vermentino. 1. Caprese salad with ""raisenetted"" cherry tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella and poached loin of tuna. 2. Pairing of 100 layer lasagne with 2009 Cantina Produttori Bolzano - Huck Am Bach. The richness and acidity of the pomodoro, veal and pork ragout perfectly matched with this bright fruit forward red. 3. Fonduta Annelini with White Truffles & Parmigiano - no cutlery served with this. Dredge soft wide tubes of fresh pasta through an unctuous white truffle and parmesan sauce. 4. Veal tenderloin rolled in ash, serviced with polenta and osso bucco vinogrette; beautifully tender medallions of veal (maybe sous vide or poached?) with rich sauce flavoured with the osso bucco marrow. Robust barolo with age (1998) to accompany. 5. The incredible red italian dessert wine paired with Melanzane e Cioccolato alla Napoletana. 6. The little things: Italian breads served with a choice of butter or indulgent garlic lardo, the unveiling of the dessert tray, the presentation of the ash rolled veal tenderloin before it is cooked and plated for your table, the deftly balanced Michter's rye Manhattan from the bar before the meal.

Thankfully, I chose to ignore the many 3 star and lower reviews.Clearly, people define great restaurants differently. Perhaps all the negative reviews were written by Williamsburg hipsters who wouldn't recognize stellar food and service if it crashed through the front door of their loft. Or maybe they were written by competitors.First, why is it that most restaurants (including Eataly, Lupa, and Otto) get a pass on marking up red wine 100% or more and yet serving it at 75 degrees? Del Posto, like Ai Fiori, Ciano, Lincoln, Marea, and Scarpetta, scores major points for serving its red wine at the proper 60 degrees. I wish Bastianich and Batali would explain why all their restaurants don't treat wine equally seriously. Bastianich even makes his own wine yet he doesn't seem to care that most of his restaurants don't serve it properly.Second, the level of service at Del Posto simply doesn't exist in many places -- not even at similarly priced restaurants.Third, is the $115 five-course menu expensive? No. It's actually a great value because you don't just get the 5 courses, which are created with great skill, but also 7 amuse bouche, lasagna, and 6 petit fours. Compare that to Ciano's five-course tasting menu at $96, which is excellent but includes no ""freebies,"" resulting in a more rushed experience.Finally, the homemade bread at Del Posto is impressive.

983,GwWXOYteiCEHmtANqoWEyg,Mike K.,4.0 star rating,"I am awarding Del Posto a strong four stars but not the oh-so-coveted-but-ever-so-elusive Mike K. five stars. I came here for lunch the other week and had a meal that, while not perfect, was very impressive.From the outside Del Posto indistinguishable from its neighbors; from the inside it looks like a palazzo, constructed with sleek marble surfaces, rich wood furniture and elegant dining accomodations. The multiple levels impart to Del Posto's patrons an impression of something more than a restaurant - dining there feels like you have been invited to a very wealthy person's townhouse mansion to fete him or her on a special occasion. The live piano is a nice, but mixed, touch (""Honeysuckle Rose"" was sweet; Billy Joel I could have done without).I cannot say enough good things about the service. In addition to the regular supply of waiters who served us, we were also attended upon by multiple hosts, who were very knowledgeable about the food. The act of serving our food was surprising at first, yet very well-orchestrated: the waiters encircled our table and placed the dishes in front of us simultaneously, like a choreographed Busby Berkeley number. Later one of my colleagues commented that this was so that everyone would receive his food and begin eating at the same time, which I think is really nice. Good service is always appreciated, and service can bump a restaurant up or down a star, but never into the five-star category, which ultimately comes down to the food.Del Posto has a great value $30 three-course prix fixe lunch menu that I strongly recommend. Del Posto is not cheap, but those dollars go far for the meal you receive. Regardless of your order, you will begin your meal with three starters. The stracciatella soup was alright; instead of the traditional egg threads, it was formed with a very light powder, which did not impress me because it lacked the texture of the threads and instead tasted like a shot of plain beef broth. The puffed rice balls had a little bit of cheese and were lightly dusted with edible gold, which made them seem decadent, and while that adjective is usually used in a positive light to describe food, I am not entirely sure about this case. The puffed rice was nice and by observing the table it occurred to me that not many people have tried it, but it was not special. If you would to try a good puffed rice dish I would find a Chinese restaurant that serves sizzling rice soup, which is amazing. The last starter was a sesame puff pastry filled with mortadella mousse. The texture of the pureed and whipped salume did not agree with everyone, but I appreciated this because I saw it as a reinvented salami on a semolina hero.For appetizers most of my colleagues ordered the cotechino, sausage served over lentils with fruit compote, but I opted for the winter salad and definitely made the right choice. The cotechino was okay. My issue with it was that the sausage did not have too much flavor and counted on the other parts of the dish to make it through, which kind of works, but it was a large piece of meat relative to the lentils and fruit. Maybe if the proportions had been different I would have liked it more. On the other hand, the winter salad, while not as eye-catching on a menu, was great. The salad consisted of many different kinds of root vegetables, including celery root, carrot, beet and brussel sprout, along with some apple and pear, light greens and a simple cream-based dressing. This dish started off understated, but by the time I finished it I was completely enamored with it. The combination of soft and crisp textures along with the delicate play of slightly sweet and bitter flavors make this salad a winner. It left an earthy taste in my mouth that I wanted to savor longer when the main course was served.I ordered the seared duck breast based on the reviews, but sampled a lot of the other dishes my colleagues had (I got some strange looks, but it was for the sake of the review!). The duck was out of this world fantastic, five stars, never want to let you go, food hall of fame quality. It was cooked so perfectly that you could bite right through the crispy skin, thin layer of fat and tender meat and not even know how you got through it. We have all had, at one point or another, melt-in-your-mouth beef, but this is the closest I have ever had to melt-in-your-mouth poultry. It was served with pureed celery root, and a pumpkin puree mixed with pumpkin seeds and diced apples and pears, which was sweet and a great match for the meat. It was heavenly and I cannot recommend it highly enough. (continued below)",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

The Prix Fixe includes: (a) an app, (b) a primi OR secondi and (c) desert. So glad I didn't listen to my nay-saying husband who had been here for dinner and thought it was overrated (especially for what he was paying). Here is what we had: bread - yummy and warm with butter and lard (interesting) Appetizer: we each had the Lobster SALAD Fra Diavola, it's heavenly and only a $10 supplement which is worth every penny - so don't miss out. Entree: between the three of us we had: 1. Garganelli Ragu Bolognese (very satisfying - but I would recommend choosing one of the secondi unless you are dead set on having pasta), 2. Seared Duck breast (perfectly cooked medium and delicious, I would order this again and again - and for people who don't like duck, it was not gamy or fatty the way duck can sometimes be), and 3. Wild Striped Bass (very tasty, but not that memorable). Desert: we had sorbet, gelato and tartufo, all were great and the chocolate covering the tartufo was nice and crunchy. But the best part of desert were the little extra deserts they brought (presentation was amazing too - they had an old fashioned rasper that was set on a wooden box and the box was filled with little nuggets of sweets). The best ones were hands down the dark chocolate truffles and the chocolate-covered ice-cream pops (yes I am partial to all things involving dark chocolate!). To make the perfect meal even more memorable we each received a gift box with chocolates to take home! Yum, can't wait to go back. The service is also flawless and, even at lunch, they had somebody play the piano. It's a bit formal and I was glad I wasn't wearing jeans and a t-shirt.

Sam Sifton's review left me delirious but this place was a very pale amateur. Summary: go to Babbo, there is nothing special about this place.Pros: beautiful space, as well as very nice, well dressed hosts, hostesses, and bartender. Â Friendly, knowledgable. Â Bar area is super comfy. Â The wine was excellent. Â Bread service was wonderful: the first real baguette outside of Paris and wonderful lard spread. Â Lovely view upstairs from our table.Cons:It was hot as hell upstairs. Â I was so uncomfortable and I had no sleeves on. My poor companions in their blazers. Â When people are eating they get hotter, so naturally a restaurant should be on the cool side. Â I wanted to strip all my clothes off. Â And the balcony shook as people walked. At points I waited and waited for them to notice my water glass was empty (a real nono at a 4 star place is all I'm saying, but I was also roasting so water was needed).Nothing jumped out at me on the menu, a bad sign. I love Babbo, Otto, Lupa, so I've had training. The server was a bit domineering and steered us in the wrong direction. Â We each wanted plenty of pasta, but he said that we should get the $95 tasting menu. Â So we got 2 pastas to share. Â This meant that I only got 2 tablespoons of the culinary highlight of the evening, the incredible gnocchi al pomodoro. I could have just eaten that all night, but no, not allowed. Â He talked us out of what we wanted rather than supporting it!? I wanted the duck, and he convinced me to go med-rare rather than rare, and so it came out a hard brick rather than tender, melty flesh. The duck had great seasoning though, what I could grasp of it. Too tame. The food should have had me gasping at the first bite of the amuse bouche, like at the other restaurants, but it was bland. Â All this presentation, what a waste.

994,l3lpkn8g76tjXKSv_t5IEg,Suma K.,5.0 star rating,"Let me preface this review by saying that I didn't pay for this meal (it was a business dinner), and I hadn't heard of this place until about an hour before I went. I knew who Mario Batali was, so I went into the place thinking ""how bad could it be?""We were a party of 4 and walked in around 6:30ish on a random Wednesday evening. I felt like I had walked into a Las Vegas restaurant; it was huuuuuuuuuuuuuge! I've never seen a 2-story, lavishly decorated restaurant that big anywhere outside of Vegas, let alone Manhattan. Once we got over the shock of the size, we were seated and immediately approached by a sommelier who began giving us advice on which wine to pick. None of us were really experts, but we knew we wanted something white. He could have easily recommended the most expensive bottle on the menu (which itself was over 50 pages long), but helped us narrow down our selection to three wines. We picked the middle-range one (can't remember the name...it was one I've never tried before).As we sipped our amazing wine, we were next approached by our host for the evening, Richard. He looked like a slightly more elegant Mr. Rogers, if you can imagine. We discussed the menu in great detail and the others at my table decided to go for the 5 course option. Since I was the only vegetarian at my table, I was skeptical, but Richard assured me that they could make pretty much anything on the prix fixe menu meatless just for me. After hearing him describe the menu options, the four of us were completely head-over-heels in love with the man! This man could describe a bowl of cereal and make it sound like the most lavish dish ever.The food came us course by course, and as Richard had promised, there was always a veggie option for me. Over the period of the meal, we ordered 2 more bottles of wine and were completely blown away by the food. I've seen my share of half-assed vegetarian meals at these high end restaurants and needless to say, this was not one of them. They seriously didn't mess around.Overall, this was hands-down the best experience I've ever had at a restaurant (emphasis on EXPERIENCE). The food was pretty damn good, the wine was terrific, the ambiance very relaxing, but the thing that really hit a chord with me was the service. From start to finish, it was impeccable. Richard was an unbelievably knowledgeable and amazing host (he mentioned that he had tasted every variation of every item on the menu and could recite it by heart), and the entire team of sommeliers (all of whom we met) were impeccable. Everything was executed so smoothly and not once did we feel like we were in a high-end eatery. Everyone was friendly and it didn't feel pretentious at all. In fact, they didn't have a strict dress code; I think the only thing they don't allow is sandals(?).The cherry on top of all this? We all got individual boxes of truffles on our way out (so unneccessary, but so lovely!). Two HUGE thumbs up from me!!",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

From the decor to the food (and handbag foot stools), this dining experience goes above and beyond what I ever expected. Â The way the resturant is set up, it is so spacious and roomy -- plus you won't ever hear the conversations of your neighbors, so you'll sometimes feel like it's your private dining affair. For the food we ordered a rabbit truffles and lobster risotto. Truffles were phenomenal. Â The Risotto was made different than it usually is, so if you're expecting a creamy portion, you'll be slightly disappointed. It was still more than enough food. We barely even put a dent in it. The apps are very huge, so be well aware when ordering. For the main course, we got Roasted LAMB with Salted Belly, Carciofi alla Romana & Cynar Glassato and the Sliced DUCK with Sour Cherries, Shaved Asparagus, Fava Beans & Foie Gras Guis. Both were great dishes. Next time, I really want to try the dover sole. But it's only available for two, so i had to pass this time around.

After trying Babbo on Friday and loving it (see last review), I assumed Del Posto would be the inferior of the two. But after trying the tasting menu I must admit they are both equally as good! Del Posto is certainly the fancier and showier of the two restaurants. If I had a choice, I'd rather go to Babbo - the atmosphere is more fun and neighboorhoody (is that a word?). But as far as the food and service goes, Del Posto was just as good...if not better.One of my friends was 45 minutes late to dinner, so we ended up getting a bottle of wine at the bar waiting for her. We got a great bottle of white for only $37 bucks. Nice to know that you can still get decently priced wine at a fancy restaurant like that. And then our second bottle of wine was comped! Yay! We all got the tasting menu ($85 bucks) which I highly recommend. Unlike most tasting menus where the menu is set, this one allowed us to choose our own appetizer, main course and desserts. We only had to agree on 2 pastas to share as a group. BREAD: We got an assortment of fresh bread at the table. It was accompanied with sweet butter and lard. I would vote to skip the lard spread. FOOD: Portions are much more manageable than at Babbo and the pastas were just as good. I got a sweet bread and foie gras appetizer, and duck as the main course. I definitely felt spoiled. The pumpkin ravioli and garganelli al rag bolognese were also great. The garganelli was black - which I've never seen before. The desserts all seemed to have a caramel theme to them - caramel tart, assortment of gelatos (caramel being one of them), and a caramel infused cake. PERKS: The waiters pulled up a short stool next to our seats and placed our purses on them. It's the first time my purse has ever had a seat of it's own!

The snow was 20 inches on the ground and I plowed through it towards the frozen Hudson, determined not to miss the reservation. Finally I arrived, 15 minutes late. I expected a dressing down from the maitre'd, but the place was empty. NO ONE made it to their reservations! The vast space was echoingly empty. And the snow was falling outside. Eventually a few bedraggled diners made it in.They brought unbelievably good agnolotti (Mario Batalli knows his pasta. trust me on this one) and a killer, aged Bovio barbera. Then awesome dessert.

1018,MinMyZiMLi6h0JezESyAyg,Chad M.,2.0 star rating,"I went here last night with a group of 8 friends. Â We decided to all get the 5 course tasting menu for $95.I have to agree with everyone here that the space is very unique and quite nice. Â There is actually some separation between tables. Â But all of this has been written before, so on to the dishes:Antipasti: Yellow Fin & Tail CARPACCIO with Sunflower & Anchovy Dressing. Â I was quite pleased with this dish. Â Unbeknownst to me at the time, this would end up being the best dish I had...by far. Â The sea grapes gave a really interesting texture to the dish, and all of the flavors combined wonderfully without interfering with the taste of the yellow fin.First Taste of Pasta: Â CARAMELLE di Robiola with Black Truffle Butter. Â The pasta looked like little wrapped candies. Â Unfortunately, there were only 3 for this course. Â The waiter told us that 2 tastes is a little less than the amount in a regular pasta order, and 3 tastes is pretty much the same as a regular order. Â So that means you'd get 9 in a full order. Â A bit too sparse for my liking. Â The pasta its self was quite nice. Â The cheese filling was smooth, and not too strong in flavor. Â However, the black truffle butter didn't taste nearly as strongly of black truffle as I expected. Â You kinda had to concentrate to pick the flavor out.Second Taste of Pasta: Â Potato GNOCCHI with Pork Shoulder, Spiced Prunes & Pine Croccante. Â This was my 2nd favorite part of the meal. Â The pork shoulder was VERY flavorful. Â I got lucky and had an average amount of meat, but 1 of the member of our group got a portion with 1 tiny flake of meat. Â The gnocchi was definitely homemade and had a great consistency. Â The spiced prunes really worked well in small amounts in each bite to accompany the rich, savory meat and sauce.Secondi: Â Grilled PORK Chop Ode to Emilia-Romagna with Persimmon & Winter Savory. Â AVOID!!!Here's where the meal reached rock bottom. Â The pork chop was nicely sized, but that's about the only good part. Â The outside of the chop was bland, but properly cooked. Â Once you got to the inside of the chop it was like mush. Â The best way to describe it is the texture of a burger, or like the inside had been pounded until it was effectively pre-chewed. Â I tried to force my way through it, but had to give up. Â Jeff C also got the chop and it was the same. Â In the end we sent it back. Â As much as I hate making a fuss, there was no alternative.Secondi (take 2): Â Artic CHAR with Calamaretti, Romanesco Cauliflower & Truffle Passato. Â World of difference. Â The skin was nice and crispy, and the black truffle/squid ink paste it was served on was a great accompaniment. Â It added a nice salty, earthy flavor that rounded out the fish. Â There was definitely more solid black truffle flavor in this than was in the pasta.Dolci: Â Crema AGRUMATA Huckleberry-Buckwheat Panzanella & Anson Mills Buckwheat Gelato. Â The crema agrumata its self had a great citrus flavor, but it was a bit too much like a cheese for me. Â The huckleberry and fresh mint mix was very good. Â My favorite part of the dessert. Â The buckwheat gelato was a bit too sweet, which ended up masking the subtle buckwheat flavor. Â Unfortunately, I lost about 1/5 of it as it was served to me with a long trail of melted gelato already on the plate.I will say however, that the service was STELLAR. Â All questions were answered with a smile...the main server was understanding when we had to send the pork back...any time someone left the table, their napkin was refolded before the came back...etc. Â Overall, there were just too many mistakes in the meal to justify anything but a 2 star. Â I'd probably go 2.5 if I could, but I can't do a 3 for this.Water Refill Meter: 5/5My glass was NEVER empty.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
1019,cvFqqd1kn4H7ImCmOSv5EA,Andrew W.,5.0 star rating,"Del Posto is a place I like to take family for a fancy, big city dining experience. The food is actually good and the place itself is experiential, almost to the point of being thematic. For example, there's a piano man somewhere in the back. I've had the tasting menu a few times. Solid. Doesn't change that often. I prefer the smaller menu. Last time I was there, I had a veal chop. I was offered table side shaved truffles for an additional price. It was magic, the best veal chop I've ever had. Simple, perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, with shaved truffles! There are a few flaws here. I once ordered ice cream for desert and it was hard as a rock. pre scooped balls, put into a bowl, then kept in the freezer? Â A menu shouldn't offer a dish they could care less about.

Â Great wine recommendations, excellent pastas and entrees. Â The appetizers were forgettable though - we tried the beef tartare and the octopus. Â The octopus was overcooked and bland, while the tartare was a bit overworked. Â Dessert, however, was amazing.

1021,6tfHbeWoiNQ2aaTjtRz78Q,Lindsay P.,4.0 star rating,"Emerging from our cab and seeing the unassuming entrance on 10th Avenue, I wasn't sure what to expect. Walking in, the restaurant was far more grand than I anticipated and because we did not have reservations, we asked to sit in the Enoteca. Immediately, I was glad for this decision. The main dining room of Del Posto was beautifully appointed but the high ceilings distracted from a warm, intimate feel and seemed more ""corporate dinner-ish"". However, the Enoteca side was the opposite. With lower ceilings, heavy drapery and warm colors, I felt like I was visiting a dear friend's villa in Tuscany (if I had any dear friends in Tuscany!).Scanning the menu, we decided on the Calamari Fritti with cherry peppers and capers. This was, hands down, the best calamari I've had. It melted in my mouth, wasn't over fried or heavy and the addition of the cherry peppers to the butter reduction sauce made for a nice mixture of sweet and salty. Perfectly balanced.For our second plate, we chose the Garganelli with Lamp Sausage. The homemade spinach pasta was not overworked or tough. It had the right amount of give and melted in my mouth. The lamb was fresh without a hint of gaminess. To finish our dinner, we had the Black Sea Bass. The fish was thick and I was worried that parts might be overcooked and the middle under but it was cooked to perfection. It flaked onto the fork nicely and the texture felt just right.We finished the evening off with an espresso that took me back to the cafes of Italy.It was an enjoyable experience, the wines by the glass were reasonable and the service attentive.My only complaint would be that when we first arrived, we wanted to order our calamari first with our martinis and then scan the menu slowly but were informed that we had to order everything at once because that's how the kitchen wanted it. We felt a bit rushed but the food and the service made up for our initial upset.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
1022,zlKOt4h0gnPNZojOzPdePw,K P.,4.0 star rating,"I agree with what a lot of others had posted, this is more of a special event meal. Â The dining room is formal, maybe even a little stiff? - mahogany / marble...two floors...Service was excellent, so I gave it 4 stars...The food - hmmm, I don't know. Â Glad I went - not sure I need to go back. Â Although, I would be interested to see how the Enoteca part is run...Bread basket was really good - tried both the lard & the sweet butter spreads on the olive and rosemary bread. Â Our amuse bouche was a vegetable broth, fried cheese, and a what looked like a little meatball made from mortadella rolled in pistachios (I think it was pistachios) -- all were fine.My friend and I did the smaller tasting ($95) where appetizer and entree are a la carte (some entrees are for an add'l fee but the menu clearly tells you how much) but you choose 2 pastas to split which will be served family style to the table (well, they are brought to the table already divvied up, don't mean to confuse anyone.) Â I did the wine pairing with my dinner ($75.) Â My friend ordered the Insalata d'ESTIVA, Summer Squashes, Warm Almonds & Ruchetta and her entree was the tuna. Â Her appetizer was a salad...fresh, light, nothing to write home to mom about. Â Her tuna was good, and I was expecting a lot but maybe I was so excited about chipotle and avocado...I thought it was alright, tuna was fresh...I think I wanted a little more spice - maybe a spattering of jalepenos? Â but I'm not a chef...and that's just a preference - and I guess it is an Italian restaurant...Pastas we shared: Rabbit PANZOTTI with Pencil Asparagus & Black Truffle Butter, POTATO GNOCCHI with Red Wattle Ragu, Shaved Fennel & Burnt Pollen - the rabbit panzotti had good flavor, but the consistency of the filling kinda weirded me out - it was gooey, runny, which I didn't expect, but at these prices, I was gonna try it. Â (haha! sounded like my dad just then) The gnocchi was delicious, but I'm so partial to anything that has pork - but the gnocchi was light, the pork ragu flavorful...I'm kinda bummed I didn't try the gnudi - but my friend chose the rabbit & of course, I have to have one item w/pork in it...My appetizer was the Horseradish PANNA COTTA with Insalata d'Astice & Sclopit - (I had to ask what sclopit was -it's an herb, I mean, I didn't know) the lobster was lightly poached and delicate and came in a spring pea type sauce which was good (but I had the spring pea soup once at 11 Mad Park & that flavor was way more intense, fresh, I'm sorry to say, this didn't compare...) the panna cotta was supposed to be infused with bacon (which made me excited) but I didn't notice much of a bacon flavor...which was a little, ok, A LOT disappointing (b/c isn't everything better w/bacon?) Â My entree was the duck and that was pretty amazing, there was a small dollop of foie gras on the side and the combination of the duck, the corn, foie gras, etc was delicious!Dessert was the following: My friend had the SOUFFLE di Cioccolato with Hazelnut GelatoMine was the Butterscotch SEMIFREDDO, Tri-Star Strawberries, Crumbled Sbrisalona & Milk Jam Â  Â The chocolate souffle - was like you know that warm, chocolately melty cake, good, but I've had it everywhere and have eaten it so much, that it all seems the same to me. Â Now my butterscotch - I never realized butterscotch and strawberries would taste so lovely together (which might lead you to believe maybe you should not trust my food opinion) but honestly, I would never think to mix the two - and it was soooo yummy! Â Very happy with the dessert.The wine pairings recommended (which I only know wines that I like) so based on the sommelier's descriptions - I honestly never would have chosen them - I stay away from dry wines, etc (or for ex, I wouldn't have chosen a white w/the pork gnocchi, but then again, I'm not a sommelier at a top restaurant) but I did do the bite of food / sip of wine thing and the wines selected were all very good matches -- so that was a plus (but beware, I ended up getting way more tipsy than I had expected, and I didn't finish all the wine.)My friend had one gripe. Â At the end with our dessert, they served us a moscato - which came w/mine & when we rec' d the bill - there was a $10 charge for giving her the dessert wine- which in all honesty, she didn't ask for and felt that that was wrong. Â (I kinda agreed, but at the same time, it was the guy who served us bread and not our waiter and he was so nice I told her I would buy the drink if she promised not to say anything...) Plus, service was really excellent - I didn't want it to end on potentially a sour note. Â AND I do think it was just an honest mistake...it's not like they're plumping up the bill with one $10 drink.The little add'l desserts they give you at the end?

1023,0IKCQDtV6vta91WS3fcOzQ,Sarah H.,4.0 star rating,"I took my boyfriend to Del Posto for his birthday dinner this week and was not disappointed. I have to say, the place was a lot fancier than we'd expected, and had a very Client Dinner sort of atmosphere - lots of men in suits were dining there. At least my boyfriend and I clean up pretty well...we weren't given funny looks for our relatively casual appearance.This place is like a well-oiled machine. They seem to have a different staff member for every step of the dining process, from seating to pouring water to the sommelier, wait staff, dessert cart guy, etc etc. Having so many people being so attentive actually makes me slightly uncomfortable in an ""I don't really need this"" sort of way but at least everyone was polite and quick. I guess I'm just not that used to Fine Dining.Anyway, my boyfriend (who is super picky) and I both enjoyed our experience here. I was a little disappointed that there were no vegetarian entrees, so I just ordered a first course of crepes as my entree. It was a small dish, but we had enough other food to fill me up, starting with the amuse bouches (not one, but four!), the big bread basket, and of course dessert. My crepes were delicious. My boyfriend ordered the lamb and he said it was really good, but overpriced for what it was. Not surprising, being that this is Batali and Bastianich. Never had I spent $15 on a dessert before this place, but I was there for the experience so I sucked it up. And it was worth it. I ordered the cheesecake/kaffir lime coconut sorbetto/roasted pineapple dessert trio, and it was just wonderful. My boyfriend was not so impressed with his tiramisu, which had semisweet chocolate flakes on top instead of bittersweet dark chocolate. Boyfriend is not a sweets guy. He also said his espresso was not impressive, but he's a coffee snob. Oh, and I forgot to talk about the wine. The wine list is MASSIVE. Like Â overwhelmingly gargantuan. No wonder places like this have sommeliers. We were actually able to sift through and find a good, reasonably priced rosso di montalcino on our own but had we needed assistance I'm sure the sommelier would have been valuable. This is one of those restaurants that has items like a 3 liter bottle of wine for $3,250. Yeah. We managed to pick out a tasty $42 bottle. And I loved the big red wine goblets - I'm a sucker for drinking out of those. It makes me feel so fancy.Would I go back? Only if I'm not paying for it. Like my boyfriend said, it's overpriced for what it is, but it was a nice splurge. And they send you away with a ""gift from the kitchen"" - a small box containing two chocolate truffles.

Â I decided to give Del Posto a try based on Batali and good reviews. Â I'm happy I made the trek over to basically New Jersey.We had the lobster salad to start and it was very nice. Â Good hunks of lobster in a slightly spicy red sauce. Â I enjoyed the dish but could have used some more spice or citrus. Â For the main we shared 2 pasta dishes and the halibut. Â The garganelle with bolognese was absolutely delicious. Â I didn't know the garganelle would be made with spinach but didn't mind at all once we started eating. Â The sauce meshed well with the pasta. Â A lovely bolognese that wasn't too rich or greasy. Â The spaghetti with crab meat and jalapenos was a revelation. Â I usually almost always prefer pasta dishes with red sauce but this was a winner. Â The hint of spice with the succulent crab meat and al dente spaghetti was a hit. Â There was also some crunch in the pasta, maybe breadcrumbs, that made for great textural balance. Â A first class pasta dish. Â The halibut was one of the best pieces of fish I've had at any restaurant. Â It was just a well prepared, well seasoned and delicious piece of fish. Â Firm, flaky, moist and great. Â If I could cook fish like this at home I'd probably eat more fish. The service here was spotless. Â Not too overbearing and stuffy. Â Very good wine recommendation from the sommelier and unobtrusive waiters picking up dishes and refilling water.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

While the service and amuse bouche were fantastic, the rest of the regular (5 course prix fixe) was well, not forgettable, but not for the right reasons. I had the nut and root salad which was under seasoned. Of the two pasta courses, the risotto was a little too soupy and the pasta was slightly undercooked (maybe al dente means something else in NYC) - the tallegio inside the pasta was great. The biggest disappointment was the chicken sparpariello. Â I don't mind bone-in chicken but I was finding bite size grist and bone in the chicken and it just destroyed the entire dish for me. My wife had the lobster and the cheesiness in the sauce turned her off as well.For such an expensive meal, it didn't deliver. In contrast, Mozza Osteria in LA blew past any expectations.I wish they had a different option than the prix-fixe as there were simply too many courses for us to properly enjoy it.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
1039,_KRphzrvgZ8C6-gJI0iMBQ,Bora K.,4.0 star rating,"We'd actually had reservations at Craft this night but while on the Chelsae Market Food Tour, our guide detoured us into Del Posto and started raving about the $45 Pre-Fixe menu in the Enoteca. A $45 dollar pre-fixe menu is a good deal anywhere in the city but the fact that it was Del-Posto made the deal even sweeter so I stopped by the front on our way out and made dinner reservations for that evening.We were seated promptly when we arrived.. none of the waiting like Babbo and the space of the restaurant gave it a very relaxing atmosphere. The live band that was playing definitely added unto the already great ambience.We chose the $45 pre-fixe menu that allows us to choose Â any antipasti, primi, secondi and dolci. Â There's an accompanying wine pairing for an additional $19 per person which we also chose. (The pre-fixe menu must be for the entire party at your table). There was a wide variety of breads from the bread basket and they give you butter and lard. The lard on your bread can be fun but if you don't like pork, you won't like it. It definitely tastes like what it is- pork fat.  The antipasti was beef carpaccio and the calamari. The beef carpaccio was velvety with crunchy salt crystals, olives, and fresh mozzarella. The calamari was crunchy and spicy. Both excellent. Â For our primi, I had the Bucatini all' Amatriciana and while I do usually like this dish, the guanciale was very overpowering, giving the pasta a very ""porky"" flavor that was somewhat disconcerting. I definitely liked the Orecchiette with spicy pancetta and greens much better. Secondi was Roast cod and Pork loin. Cod was a definite winner, the pork not so much. It was very dry,The desserts were solid but nothing mind blowing. We had the flourless chocolate cake and the sorbets. All wines that were paired with our meal were great accompaniments. I especially liked the spicy red that went with our primi. The prosecco at the end wasn't half bad either.A really great deal for the kind of restaurant that it is.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Â As you enter Del Posto, Enoteca is the area immediately to the right, just before the main bar. Â And the great thing about Enoteca is that there's a 4 course prix fixe menu for $45 with an accompanying $19 wine pairing that I personally think is the best value at Del Posto. Â The food is cooked by the same chefs in the same kitchen as the rest of Del Posto and the price is a lot more reasonable. Â And for $19, a glass of wine to accompany each course is fantastic value. Â When you call to make a reservation, make sure to ask for a reservation at Enoteca and you'll be set. Â As has been said before, the ambiance/set up of Del Posto is reminiscent of a big Chicago steakhouse with all the yellow and wood accents. Â Clientele is heavy on suits and far from the younger/more hip and more aesthetically pleasing crowd that hangs out in the rest of the Meatpacking district. Â But service is attentive.

Â I took the boyfriend there for his birthday, so I had researched somewhere special. Â Having recently come back from a 10 day trip to Italy, I was curious to see what this famed eclectic Italian restaurant had in store. There was no disappointment here!After reviewing the menu, we decided to do the $95 per person tasting menu. Â But before even ordering, a small plate of a few nameless appetizer sized portions came to the table- the waiter explained that prior to ordering it was customary for patrons to taste the difference in how the food was made in preparation for our meal. Â We tasted the small items and couldn't wait to start our meal.In the tasting, we both ordered our own appetizer, one pasta to share , entree and dessert. Â As we were deciding, the wine connoisseur came over to the table and we had a great discussion with him about wine. Â For appetizers I got the Abalone Carpaccio, and he ordered the panna cotta. Â Pastas- the crespelle and our entrees he got the lobster and I the Tuna. Â (Oh the Tuna.....oh man it was phenomenal). Â We both ordered desserts, espressos, and grappa, and I was lucky to make it out of there without forgetting where I parked.Seriously, if you want to taste food that will blow away your senses, this is the place to go. Â Using traditional and non-traditional combinations, the dishes here are incredibly wonderful and different.Yes, it is expensive. And Yes, it is worth it.

1044,EiZBE3C_MSZr0wX_1Vodhw,Arlene M.,4.0 star rating,"This was our actual anniversary dinner, though I guess we actually spread it out over 3 meals. Â Unfortunately, our anniversary fell on a Sunday, so my first choices (Le Bernardin and Jean-Georges) were both closed. Â We wound up going to those two places at other days at least. Â By the time I realized we should probably do Italian (since we were already going to 2 other french restaurants), Babbo was already fully booked, so we wound up here. Â I gotta say, my expectations weren't as high, since the yelp reviews were lower than Babbo, and it was ""only"" 2 michelin stars (while the other ones we went to had 3), but I was definitely pleasantly surprised. Â We started with champagne, which was so good that I had to ask the sommelier for the name of it (It's Guy Larmandier). Â It's pretty ironic that we went to some of the best French restaurants in NYC (if not the country) and we got our best champagne at an Italian restaurant!We started off with a trio of amuse bouche, a soup and 2 other items (similar to Jean-Georges). Â We were considering the Grand Tasting Menu, but decided for the regular 5-course menu instead, since the grand tasting menu was mostly protein and didn't have any pasta! Â It was also a much better value at $95 vs $175 for the grand menu. Â For antipasti, I got the mozzarella, which was just ok. Â The highlight of the dinner were the 2 tastings of pasta. Â Our first pasta was the rabbit panzotti with truffle butter, which was kinda like ravioli. Â It was pretty damn good. Â Our next pasta, the potato gnocchi, was even better! Â The consistency of the pasta was just pretty damn perfect, and the sauce was amazing. Â Only gripe here were that the pasta portions were pretty small.For my main course, I got the veal chop, while hubby got the lamb. Â Had to pay extra for the veal, but I can see where the extra money went....the chop was HUGE. Â It took up pretty much the whole plate, and I could barely finish it, even after giving a huge portion to the hubby. Â Plus they give you a salad on the side with very generous shavings of white truffle. Â  Â  Â  I thought it all tasted good (can't go wrong w/ what is pretty much a breaded & pan-fried piece of veal), the white truffle was not as strong as I thought it should be...it just didn't blow me away the way the pastas did. Â I wish they had larger portions of the pasta and less of the meat. I ordered an extra cheese course before dessert since I was craving some cheese...I Dessert was pretty good too ...I had chocolate souffle/cake (as I always do) while hubby had the panna cotta. Â It was great, though nowhere near as good as Jean-Georges.Overall, it was a great meal, but I did get the impression that it seemed like an italian restaurant trying to be a french restaurant, especially since the grand tasting menu had no pasta, and used a lot of french ingredients. Â I think this place has promise if it stayed more true to its italian roots and had more emphasis on the pastas, which were the best dishes by far (is that what Babbo does?). Â I gotta give some kudos to the sommelier though for expertly matched wines to the dishes we selected, and in general the service is very good in a formal sort of way.A pretty good meal, but there are so many good Italian restaurants in NY that I would rather try some other ones if I go back.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
1045,HWsW1r8V-IaUEOcQ24fAKg,Dahan C.,5.0 star rating,"Foodgasm.I went for their regular prix fixe lunch. It was pretty pricey for lunch, $35, but for the quality of food and the service, I'd say it's worth it. I like Mario Batali. He seems like a really laid back, humble guy, unlike some other Food Network chefs. I also like how out there he can get with his food.Anyway, onto what I ate. I ordered roasted autumn vegetables with obiola Sformato & Truffled Hazelnuts for my appetizer, seared duck breast for my entree, and gelato for dessert. Right after we ordered, the waiter brings us these little shot glass sized cups of a lemony-chicken soup and tiny creampuff shells filled with mortadella. This was to help our appetite or something like that. I don't remember - I was too busy staring at this miniature plate! I ate the mortadella first and it was salty but no complaints there since that's how is usually is. I think. I then finished off with the soup which was oddly refreshing maybe because of the citrus notes in there.The appetizer came out and it was good and light.The entree. Duck breast. Cooked medium rare with LOVE. The breast was cut into two pieces and each piece sat on top of celery root puree and it was served with an apple chutney. The waiter then proceeded to spoon the duck juices on top. Wow. The duck cut like butter and melted in your mouth. It was so tender and delicious. The celery root didn't add much flavor but instead lent a creamy texture. The chutney was where a lot of the flavor was. It wasn't heavily seasoned with one particular spice. It was more fruity and fresh than anything else. This duck/celery root/chutney combo was magical. For dessert, I had a bowl of gelato. There were four mini scoops of it - vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, and coconut I believe. It was the perfect portion size and I enjoyed the different flavors. I wish the flavors were more adventurous though. Everyone knows what chocolate and vanilla tastes like...After dessert, the waiter brings a palette cleanser in a tiny cabinet. (Again, this is free. AWESOME) There were two tiers of goodies. Top tier had chocolate coated hazelnut ice cream on a lollipop stick. The next one was ITALIAN DONUTS. I forgot what the filling was. Sorry.Bottom level had candied grapefruit rind which was amazing. It wasn't bitter at all. The last one was a mini lemon tart. I ate these randomly and realized after that there was a reason as to how these were laid out inthe way they were.I was supposed to end with the lemon tarts, not start with them, because they had a bright citrus flavor which really Â would have cleansed my palette. Fail..I highly recommend Del Posto for more special occasions since it is pricey and the atmosphere is extremely fancy.

1046,eQJ6tPVZR3yzOfesToXqyg,Mariangela S.,3.0 star rating,"I certainly felt like a hardcore foodie the evening I went to Del Posto. Having just arrived at JFK from San Francisco, I dropped off my bags and headed directly to the restaurant at 11pm - right when they stop taking dinner orders. My dining companions had dropped off like flies, it was already too late for them to venture out on a Tuesday night.I was seated in the main dining room, and attended to with the utmost attention from all staff. I quickly ordered my food - an antipasto composed of wild mushrooms, roasted almonds, and some greens, a ""BIS"" - two different pastas in a split order: spaghetti with crab, chilis, and fresh breadcrumbs, and asparagus raviolini made in-house.The antipasto was ok, somewhat underwhelming. The mushrooms were very smoky - and nothing in the description on the menu and by the manager gave that indication. Overpoweringly smoky. Â The first pasta, the spaghetti, was perfectly cooked, but I had the same complaint about this dish as I did recently at Babbo - it was way too spicy! I like hot, but the chilis were so overpowering that they took away from the crab and killed my wine palette too. Believe me, I like spicy but this dish lacked balance. The asparagus raviolini were also cooked to perfection, very mild in flavors - there was robiola in the stuffing, and quite nice, but this should have come before the chili spaghetti since my mouth was still on fire!The dessert was delicious - a fig pudding (couldn't finish) with a pomegranate sorbet (from Laboratorio del Gelato was my guess), a zabaglione with salty caramel. Didn't find the caramel, but this was a delicious dessert, only to be accompanied by a comp'ed glass of vin santo that complemented it perfectly. The little after-dinner sweets are incredible - so many and all very flavorful and delicate.Overall, I wasn't blown away like I expected to be at Del Posto. The interior reminds me of Postrio in San Francisco, and felt a little dated. The dining experience is very formal - lots of changing of utensils, plates, lots of attentive servers which is nice - but doesn't quite fit with the food.

Nice long bar and we dined upstairs. Great for larger groups.The service was great until the end...we had a larger group so we split the bill up on a few cards (I know this is a pain and I feel bad every time I have to do this but sometimes you don't have a choice). Anyhow, we tipped around 22% on the bill but a couple of people paid for all the tip while others (who ate or drank less) didn't put anything for tip. Â  Our waitress just looks at the first few receipts and comes storming over saying tip is not included! We look back at here, like, ummm, did you look at all the receipts. In my book, over 20% tip is pretty decent. She obviously hadn't and I think that is sooo rude to come back over and say that when she hasnt bothered to count or review the receipts. Not to mention, tip or tip % should not be expected. Granted, i generally don't tip below 20% unless you do a crappy job, I think its unacceptable to come over to a table and ask about your tip especially when you can't do math. Long story short, she went back, counted... and came back and apologies but damage done. Tacky, classless and no desire to come back.Not to mention the food was ok but nothing spectacular.

I can speak well of the steak, which was a no-holds-barred, flavorful, salty, tender work of art Â - as perfectly cooked and succulent as any piece of cow i've met. Â The cacciucco reminded me of great cajun cooking - fresh seafood and some spicy heat does all the work, so the chef doesn't have to.

Â My fiance and I were celebrating our recent engagement and his 30th birthday with our parents on a busy Saturday night and it was white glove, first class service right from the start. Â I mean I had never been asked before if I wanted a foot stool for my purse. Â The service was endless but not annoying and the food did not disappoint in the least. Our waiter was superb when my wine did not arrive in time with the lamb, the waiter rushed it over and was sure to comp the glass on the house. Â The Amouche bouche was a delightful little trio of soup, salad and sandwich to peak our appetites. Â  Â We opted for the 5 course menu sharing 2 pasta courses for the table and each having our own choice of antipasto, main course and dessert. Â We opted for the 100 layer lasagna and porcini mushroom ravioli and they both were amazing. Â The actual pasta sheets were so thin that it melted in your mouth like butter. Â I also had the lobster fra diablo and lamb chops. Â The lamb was cooked perfectly and had amazing flavor without too much jazz allowing me to fully enjoy the taste of beautifully cooked lamb. Â For dessert, I choose the chocolate ricotta cake with olive oil gelato. Â Each bite was sinfully good. Â They also brought out a box of little treats for the table, donuts, gelato pops, mini torts. Â Each bite of these delicious treats was an explosion of sweet sensations in my mouth and it was a perfect end to the meal. Â My palate was pleasantly satisfied and I was very full by the time we left the restaurant. Â The waiter placed a small box next to each lady at the table. Â Inside was a biscotti from Italy that I enjoyed with coffee the next morning.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

I love a cozy little restaurant as much as the next, but it is nice to be a in a large, open beautifully decorated space with high ceilings yet still have a cozy and intimate feel with the dim lighting and piano playing in the background. While impressed with the restaurant itself, I was equally impressed with the fare. We started with a great lobster salad in a (somewhat) spicy red sauce which was interesting. Moved on to a mixed green salad with a poached egg which was also delicious and my date's favorite. They then brought out small tasting plates that had, well I'm not sure what in all it included (mini soups, crusty bread with a spread, other small gourmet tastings) but they were all delicious! For my entree I had the seared duck breast and was positively wowwed. It was perfectly prepared and when served with a flavorful reduction sauce and foie gras. Hands down the best duck I've ever had. My date on the other hand ordered the slow baked lamb. He did not love his dish, but I think he was anticipating more of a traditional lamb chop...however this is more of a fall of the bone, slow cooked style lamb. I still found the dish rich and flavorful. While we were far too stuffed for dessert they brought out a small dessert tasting plate with our espressos. A couple of other comments, the service is top notch. While it could be argued that some may find it bordering pretentious, I think it was just great and attentive service. Further, they have a great wine sommelier who will wheel over his cart over and perform the whole decanting and removal of impurities from the wine glass process which adds to the whole experience.

1076,CUxy1qdQJNpXzf20b6MIcw,Vania M.,2.0 star rating,"It pains me to give Del Posto such a low rating, but it really didn't live up to our expectations. I took my husband to dinner here last night to celebrate his birthday. Being food lovers and really loving the experience we've had at Lupa, I thought a meal at its sister restaurant would be a good choice. The space is absolutely gorgeous. It had a warmth to it that I associate with Italian cuisine - cozy, comfy and inviting. We opted for the tasting menu, which really is a good deal at $95 per person. Our antipasti were delicious - I chose the special foie gras with figs and my husband had the abalone. I much preferred my foie gras, with its silky texture and mild flavor. The abalone was spicy and and beautifully plated.The primi piatti we chose were the ricotta pansoti and spaghetti with dungeness crab. The pansoti were my favorite - delicate and light, served with asparagus. It was the quintessential springtime dish. The spaghetti was the worst disappointment. It was incredibly salty. We took two maybe three bites each and could not eat any more. The only thing I kept thinking was this is a prime Italian place - how could they have sent out a bad pasta dish? We essentially sent the dishes back and were offered a replacement to make up for the inedible plate, but with two more courses, we opted to move on.My secondi was the special olive oil-poached salmon with ramps. It was melt-in-your mouth goodness. If you've never had oil-poached fish before, I would recommend trying it at least once. The texture was so silky but by then, the salt from the last dish pretty much killed my taste buds for the night. As far as I could tell, the fish was not as salty as the spaghetti but I couldn't taste the subtleties in flavor, which is a shame. Our server saw I had only eaten about a third of it and promptly came by to see if there was another problem with our meal. I quickly replied that no, the fish is delicious but I wasn't sure if I could eat any more of it and still save room for dessert, which was true. I asked to pack it up and she did, handing me a ticket to pick up the package at coat check. My husband seemed to thoroughly enjoy his rack of lamb. I took a bite of the sauteed basil it came with, and really liked it. Unfortunately, the ragu alla puttanesca was again way too salty. We know capers and olives tend to be saltier ingredients but someone in the back was seasoning with way too heavy a hand that night.Dessert, thankfully, was amazing! I had the tartuffo caffe and hubby had the pineapple crostata with the recommended dessert wine. He normally doesn't drink dessert wine but he said it worked brilliantly with the pineapple crostata. My tartuffo was so good - not so much coffee flavored, but more espresso. Not too sugary sweet at all. Both were really good ways to end our meal.So given the not-so-horrible experience, why is my rating somewhat disproportionately low? Because it's inexcusable to get an awful pasta dish at an Italian restaurant, especially at a Batali/Bastianich venture. We're glad to have had an opportunity to go to Del Posto, but probably won't be back.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Â Since this menu is only available Wed-Fri, it was a bit difficult to make a reservation, but after reserving a time twice (and had to cancel due to conflict), I finally made it with my mom. Â Lots of selections are available in the menu. Â Even though not all are vegetarian, the kitchen can accomodate to your dietary needs, which is a plus. Â First, I must compliment on the service. It was pretty much top notch. Â I was treated like a lady when the chair was pulled for me to sit (even though I had my green recycling bag with me due to some morning grocery shopping). Â Then my napkin got refolded everytime I visited the ladies' room. Â I believe 50% of my bill is justified by the service. Â As a vegetarian, I didn't have much option, that is, exciting options. Â You won't find any tofu, beans, or seitan dishes, but rather carb-loaded ones instead. Â Luckily, I'm not gluten-free, so I basically devoured all the freshly baked French rolls. Â They were THAT good! Crusty. Fresh. Chewy innard. My gosh. I would revisit this restaurant just for the bread basket. Â I almost wanted more French rolls. Almost. Â My vegetarian dishes were really simple. A mixed green, which I was surprised it was 'seasoned' with coarse salt and pepper. I was a bit 'annoyed' by that actually. If I wanted dressing on the side, I would prefer S&P on the side as well. Then as a 'special' order, I received a plate of steamed broccoli rabes, but really stir-fried with S&P and red pepper flakes. Â Not very exciting, but then again, I didn't order a pasta dish. Â For my mom's secondi, she chose the lobster. Â The seafood was fine, but the tomato sauce was too salty, especially since the among of pasta didn't need that much sauce. Â After the bread, the best part would be the dessert and I highly recommend the tartufo. It was like a charcoal volcanic rock that you crack open to discover some creamy coffee ice-cream. Â The chocolate was rich and not too sweet as well. Â We also were presented with a box of bite-size sweets in the end.

First the special service details, the waiter put my napkin on my lap, eaten with incredible piano music, had the waiter replace my lunch meal napkin with another dessert napkin using silver tongs, the waiter was great at explaining the mostly Italian menu, nothing was rushed. Even the coffee service with silver pitcher was amazing. We felt like royalty, like when the sommelier helped us choose wine with our meal and made perfect choices (although we ordered by the glass) and all through the meal. So that is the setting, the food was incredible, particularly the lobster fra diablo, the hazelnut cake, the amuse bouche of crab sandwich and the cauliflower soup with truffle oil. Dessert came with extra treats, a donut, a lollipop, fruity treats and more. This was the most special delicious meal with many new ingredients and styles of preparation (serious foodies would be in heaven). I can't wait to go back. This is a place to get engaged, with the gorgeous setting, sensous attention to detail, luxurious food and wonderful service. I am hugely smitten. This is how the 1% lives (no wonder they like it!) yet it was affordable at lunch. I am smitten. Maybe the one thing I didn't love was the sweet sauce on my fluke fish and raddichio, but the bacon made it taste fabulous. Husband's lamb was an delicious, cooked two ways.

Â Del Posto's grand size and close proximity to Meatpacking was an immediate turn-off. Â However, I was told by many friends that despite all that, Del Posto was worth the trip - that the food and service were exceptional...I should have gone with my gut. Â Let's start with the service: I had an 8:30pm reservation and was not seated until 9pm. Â Only after I complained 5 times and asked to speak to the manager did I get an apology. Â The maitre'd fed me one excuse after another and the manager did nothing to help the situation.

Â I've never seen a ducks testicles and didn't think the dinner plate was the place for my first sighting. Â We had the three pasta tasting for the table which is a must! Â The three pasta's we had were spaghetti with spicy crab, a pasta with wild boar and a spinach penne. Â All three were incredible and worth the price. Â The wine list was overwhelming with all Italian wines, but the sommelier was extremely helpful and didn't steer us wrong.

1108,Q_hcov_beJpPru4lrz3FYg,Tim H.,4.0 star rating,"My wife and I have been wanting to try Del Posto for years. Â When the NY Times review came out last September awarding it 4 stars, we wanted to go even more. Â So finally we did this past Friday. We had an 8:30 reservation but got there early so we could have a drink at the bar. Â The space is simply gorgeous. Â When we entered we immediately felt that we were in a special place. Â The ceiling soars high with seating all around on a second floor mezzanine. Â There is lots of marble and dark wood and the place evokes a very high end private club.At the bar we sat with only a few other patrons and ordered martinis on the rocks. Â The glasses were large but filled to the brim with ice and only a very small pour.We were given a very nice banquette in the rear of the main area and decided to order the 5-course $95 dinner. Â My wife chose the Herb Salad to start which was ordinary and I chose the Warm Cotechino, which was excellent. Â I love great bread and we often get it in NY, even at very modest establishments. Â The bread here was pretty ordinary, 2 small baguettes, 2 rolls with olives and 2 other rolls. Â We did not care for the greasy lardo and quickly switched to the delicious Italian butter. Â It took longer than we thought it should for the two pasta courses to arrive. The first was the Spaghetti with Dungeness crab. Â The pasta was cooked perfectly and the crab itself was delicious, but there was a bit of a fishy taste that just did not seem quite right. Â We had begged to have the 100 layer lasagna that has been talked about and though our waitress would not commit (""they only really make enough for the 7-course meal""), she came through and it was wonderful.For the main course, I chose the Grilled Pork and my wife, the Wood-grilled Lobster. Â The lobster was delicious, succulent and cooked just right. Â The pork was also excellent but not ethereal. Â We had each started with a glass of wine, generous pours Â - Â the Roero Arneis white for my wife which was delicious but a little pricey at $18. Â For me, it was the St. Magdalender red which was also delicious and a relative bargain at $12. Â We opted for the $75 wine pairings for the meal and this was a bit disappointing. Â They were all fine, a couple were excellent, but the pours were a bit small for the average $15 per.The deserts were very good - the Butterscotch Semifreddo for me, which was smooth and creamy, but basically ice cream, and the Chocolate Ricotta Tortino for my wife. Â She loves chocolate with a passion, but was not enthusiastic about it, feeling it was a bit dry and lacking the explosive taste that she expected. Â I thought it was excellent.The service, notwithstanding the two long waits, was very professional and courteous, though lacking a real friendly quality that we love when dining out. Â The tab was pretty steep, $440 plus tip.Obviously this is a special occasion restaurant and very good, but disappointing in ways that Jean-George, Le Bernadin and The French Laundry (our all-time favorite) is not.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

1114,DNIx-R00lmtAyML5NXRbuQ,William B.,5.0 star rating,"Better in all ways than Babbo, except for price.First, you can get a reservation without knowing any secret numbers of having a secretary who does nothing but secure reservations. And when you get there, they seem honored to have a customer rather than expecting you to be happy you were allowed to eat there at all.Second, the ambiance is far better. The room is spacious rather than bland. The tables are large and spaced far enough apart that you don't even hear your neighbors, let alone bump into them (which you can easily do at Babbo). And the music is actually suitable to fine dining. It's soft Sinatra or orchestral music rather than loud rock. It assumes you came to eat and talk rather than listen to music.Third, the service is far better. Babbo has too few waiters for the number of diners, and it's so crowded that adding more people would hurt rather than help. Del Posto has enough people and enough space for them all. If you look up in search of a waiter, you'll have one at the table in about a second.Fourth, and most importantly, the food is better. Yes, the pastas are great at Babbo, but the entrees are hit-or-miss. They feel like an afterthought. At Del Posto, the pastas are just as good, and the main courses are even better. Besides, they even change the menu at Del Posto every now and then, unlike Babbo, which has been serving up the same stuff for like 15 years now. It's good, but how many times can you have the same dish? Is anyone in there actually from NYC?There's just one problem with Del Posto -- the price. It's quite expensive. The best strategy is to skip the appetizer and have one pasta course and then a main. Then skip the dessert because no dessert is worth $15.

1123,XhHgLHMjpSGe8e42omFydQ,Jeff C.,2.0 star rating,"LESS THAN AMUSED. It is with good reason that this place gets mixed reviews. 2 Michelin stars for the past two years, eh? Well guess what? At these silly price points, your food better be near flawless in execution. It wasn't. I've been to 1 star restaurants with much better food. Note to self: stick to pasta at Italian joints. Put it this way: if it wasn't for the fact that my Pork Chop was replaced with the Arctic Char, I would've given this place 1 star. Regarding the 5 course $95 menu, note that you are saving maybe a dollar at best (literally). For lunch, you save maybe $3-4 per entree, woopy doo. They also offer a 20 course tasting here for $175. I can only surmise how paltry the portion sizes of those courses would be. Like Babbo, I left unimpressed. Mario, you have yet to be taken seriously in my eyes. I'd opt for Scalini, Alto, Scarpetta over this place anyday. I disagree with Adam D.'s GENEROUS 2.5 stars so I'll give it 2 to bring down the 4 star average. I doubt I'll be back. P.S. No, I'm not bitter at the fact that only the women get chocolate truffles on the way out.

(MINUS ONE STAR)-Artic CHAR ($35 on menu) [with Calamaretti, Romanesco Cauliflower & Truffle Passato] - 15min later, passato means puree, this was excellent, squid ink/truffle passato was delicious, char was melt in your mouth good, crispy skin on top, you get a 6"" square piece, the highlight of my meal!DOLCI-TARTUFO ($15 on menu) [al Caffe with Dark Chocolate, Sant Eustachio Coffee & Candied Lemon] - crusty chocolate on the outside, candied lemon chiffonade on top, choco covered coffee mean split in half for decoration, coffee ice cream inside, i wouldn't pay $15 for this, $5 maybeAlso tried:-HALIBUT (~$35 on the menu) - this tasted like steamed tilapia, super bland, super wack (MINUS HALF STAR)Petit fours (free) - myriad of sweet delights, but only the hazelnut tart was good, the rest didn't even LOOK goodTotal came out to $123 after everythingPics to follow...(((((DON'T DO IT)))))",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
1124,kupjtYcHgF-gy-kPWqb0-A,Nick C.,4.0 star rating,"Del Posto is going to get a 4.5 star rating from me and I am leaning towards 5, but after just dining at, Daniel and giving it 5 stars, I can't bring myself to say rank this as high... even though the comparison doesn't seem fair.The atmosphere here is great, the dining room is a big open room and a little noisy for such a high end restaurant... which I like. The service here is as good as it gets. I don't care if you are spending $5,000 for a meal somewhere else; the service at Del Posto is top notch. An example, after the waiter explained the pasta special (it had rabbit) thoroughly, my mom ordered it. When it arrived and the waiter described the dish once again, my mom herd the rabbit this time and immediately was turned off. She tried eating around it, our waiter noticed, and essentially forced her (in a very polite manner) to order a different dish. She finally conceded and ordered the Pumpkin CAPPELLACCI with Almond Milk, Black Truffles & Dried Sag. I did try this and this may have been one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. This cost less than her original dish, and not only did they only charge us for one of the pasta's, they charged us for the cheaper one, this is beyond accommodating, especially since the mistake was clearly ours. One more example, I loved the wine our sommelier helped us select and I asked our head waiter to write it down for me. Instead, he carefully removed the label, had it laminated, and returned it to me on Del Posto Paper at the end of the meal!!!Onto my food: I had the CARNE CRUDA with Truffled Salsa, Parmigiano-Reggiano & Shaved Porcini as an appetizer, and this was the only dish I didn't love. The texture was a bit mushy, but the flavor was great. It was 7 or 8 grade Wagyu I believe, and you could tell.... It was very flavorful and tender. Something crispy needed to be added though, between the very tender beef and creamy sauce, the texture was just a bit off. Next I had the GARGANELLI Verdi al RagÃ¹ Bolognese. This was a spinach noodle with one of the best Bolognese sauces I have ever had, and I try Bolognese whenever I can, so that says a lot. The pasta was obviously cooked perfectly, but you could tell the spinach noodle was as fresh as could be. I loved this dish, and cleaned my plate wanting more. Finally, I had the Seared DUCK Breast, Apician Spices, Savor alla Francescana & Lovage. Just like my love for Bolognese sauce, whenever duck is on the menu at a restaurant of this caliber I order it, everytime. This was hands down the best duck I have ever had... so flavorful I cannot explain. They give a nice sized portion of Foie Gras with it, which is nice, but unnecessary, the duck breast does more than enough. I skipped dessert, but opted for the cheese plate, which was also very good...the Coach Farms was a particular standout. I would gladly go back to Del Posto and would recommend it to anyone, for any type of occasion. Also, the price is more than fair. With a $100 botte of wine, the food listed above (large portions), and an additional appetizer, and desert for my mom (she was too full for an entrÃ©e). The bill came out to $350 with tip... which is good for NYC.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

1126,PtWr14hqG1Eeqbl_yGuS2Q,Kevin L.,5.0 star rating,"I had dinner at Del Posto last night with my wife and sister. This was our second time dining at Del Posto, and the experience this time was as good or better than the first. A couple of notes before I tackle the meal: first, Del Posto is easily equal to a Michelin 2-3 star restaurant despite their recent demotion to one star. Also, the price point at Del Posto is considerably more reasonable then it's NYC high-end peers. ($95 five course, compared to $135 at Le Bernardin or $185 at daniel) Some may argue that the food at Del Posto is not as good as these places, but after dining last year at Daniel, I can assure you the food at Del Posto equals or exceeds it. Now on to the dinner... We did the five course ""Menu Del Posto."" I will be commenting only on my dishes with a few notes on exceptional dishes my companions enjoyed. VONGOLE Marinate with Fried Roman Artichokes & Minted Farro Dressing - a very interesting starter. This dish is basically 3 fried artichokes on a farro/veg mixture topped with sliced Geoduck clams. The artichokes were crispy, delicious, and not at all greasy. My only complaint is that the clams were basically extraneous and got lost in the heavier flavor of the artichoke. Otherwise delicious. CARAMELLE di Gorgonzola Dolce with Black Truffle Butter - The first of the two pasta dishes shared by the table on this menu. This was possibly the best dish of the night. Served piping hot, these little pasta ""candies"" are filled with a very mild and creamy gorgonzola and the truffle butter sauce is actually packed with fresh black truffles. Amazing flavor and perfect with the BELLAVISTA Brut Special Cuvee NV ($70 bottle, great) which has a great caramel undertone that pairs wonderfully with the earthy truffle. Del Posto AGNOLOTTI dal Plin with Lambrusco Glassato - These are tiny pasta pouches, almost like a miniature ravioli, filled with hen, pork, and lamb and stained deep purple by the lambrusco. The wine coating gives the pasta a nice tartness. The acidity of the sauce cuts perfectly through the rich meat filling. Grilled PORK ode to Emilia-Romagna with Sunchoke Crema & Aceto Conserva - I have not seen many reviews of this dish which leads me to believe it is not ordered that often. What a shame. I am an admitted pork freak, so any pork will do, but this is a great entree. The balsamic reduction, sweetened with raisins complements the chop perfectly. Crispy pancetta and de-hydrated Parmesan provided saltiness and the loin chop is served with an amazingly tender slow cooked pork rib on the side. (On a side note, my sister had the duck breast which was as good as any duck I have ever tasted. Skin crispy, meat juicy, and expertly seasoned) Deserts were all around good. I was so full at this point that nothing blew my mind (We had the butterscotch semifreddo, the chocolate ricotta tortino, and a selection of gellato) but the cashew gelatto was amazing. We did receive a complimentary dessert from the pastry chef which was amazing. Little fried donuts filled with a lime cream that came out hot from the fryer in a little basket. These were insane (like a world class funnel cake filled with key lime pie) and should find their way onto the menu in my opinion. All in all, I can't recommend Del Posto more highly. The service was polished and professional without being stuffy and snobby (ahem, Daniel, talking to you) especially considering were were all 20/30 somethings usually relegated to the service gutter and fine dining establishments. No pressure, no up-selling, just great recommendations from our waiter and friendly bus staff. If you are looking for a great high-end dining experience, and can't swing the 300+ for Per Se, this is the spot. Superior in almost every way.

1131,P_RhfuEbkb4QNieu-srz7w,Shamus K.,2.0 star rating,"This place is for the bridge and tunnel crowd. When people from New Jersey dream of an amazing restaurant in NYC, they dream of Del Posto. Which is fine. But the food is just okay (for the prices, that is), the space feels like you could be in a ""fancy"" hotel in Atlantic City (complete with somewhat surreal and tacky lounge music played live on the piano), and the service is serviceable, but hardly expert. I've been here four times. The kitchen is a little touch and go. Things can be mediocre one night, and amazing the next. There are 3 to 4 sommeliers working on the floor every night. Some are spot on. Others will lead you astray. I've had servers who noticed when food was relatively untouched on my plate (like when a ravioli with brown butter was so hot it scalded my tongue), and others who seemed rather ambivalent (like when the burnt beef didn't come out rare, it came out medium well, and all I got was a ""sorry about that""). I don't mind a dish that's off from time to time when the kitchen is adventurous -- it might be that it's not ""off"" so much as they're pushing things in directions I don't appreciate as much as others might. But when you're paying $300-500 per person -- and that's with ""budget"" wines, as the sommelier reminded me when I asked for a $150 bottle -- you shouldn't overcook a rib eye to the point where it's grey with a little pink (unless that's how you want it). And on a busy night, I understand that the place wants to turn over tables, but your service person shouldn't stand over you, bill in hand, and ask, ""can I get you anything more?"" as they place the bill on the table so as to really convey, ""please leave now."" If I've only been there less than two hours and just spent $800 for two people, I think a little more grace is required. Some recent great dishes are their olive oil ice cream, the Veal agnolotti with Parsnip, Espresso & Grana Padano, the Lobster Fra Diavolo with Garlic Bread Panna Cotta & Seaweeds, and the stunning Sphere di Caprino, Celery & Fig Agrodolce & Celery Sorbetto (a desert island dish). Others could use some work. And if they were more interesting you might cut the kitchen some slack. But in the end, it's just a little dull. It tastes like what almost great Italian food might taste like. But just almost. It's conservative enough to keep those on expense accounts coming in, and looks just hip enough to make the Jersey crowd feel like they've come to the big city for the night. But in the end, at these prices, you can do way better in town.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
1132,PUen4wWpHL_6yVoXiNJJwA,Joseph N.,4.0 star rating,"I came to Del Posto, based on the numerous delicious creations by Mario Batali. This restaurant is huge, with high ceilings and a posh atmosphere. The waiters and maitre'd size you up as a customer when they give you the menu and take your order. Likewise, at any high-end restaurant the people that work there have an attitude the size of the diner's bill. But strangely enough, they start to get nicer once you start ordering tasting menus and wines to go along with it. Â The service is great, everything gets changed after each course.I had the Fruili tasting menu, I think it may have gotten changed recently. The food was great, but certain items were so so. I guess my tastebuds didn't get stimulated enough. Some of the wines from the wine pairing were pretty good, except the fact that they aren't available in the US.

We never had bad lobster before! They smoked it or put some type of seasoning that made it inedible. The stuffed veal chop was cold and fatty.

When I got off of the subway near the Meatpacking District, I remembered that the Chelsea Market was only one avenue away from the restaurant. Having not been in years, I had forgotten just how incredible the Market was: A vast space filled with a variety of specialty food and culinary shops that were housed under one roof. There aren't many other places in the world that bring me as much happiness as being in the Chelsea Market.After a thirty-minute rendezvous at the Chelsea Market, I walked over to Del Posto and decided to grab a drink at the bar. It was only 6:00, and Linda (my dining partner) and my reservation wasn't until 6:15. After sipping nearly half a glass of moscato d' asti (yes, I take my sweet wine with or without dessert, thank you very much), Linda arrived and we were promptly seated in the restaurant's enoteca (the space in the restaurant serving less expensive prix-fixe meal options). *For those of you who have not been to Del Posto, here's a tidbit of information that you may want to take note of: The enoteca is currently running a ""recession special prix-fixe menu,"" that includes four courses for $35/person (a great deal compared with the nightly $52/person 5-course menu). Unfortunately, this special is not published on the restaurant's website or menus, so make sure to inquire with your waiter.Within minutes of being seated, a bountiful basket of house-made bread arrived with a side of butter and lardo (lard). Having heard so much about this spreadable animal fat, I knew that I had to at least try it. What I imagined tasting like solidified bacon grease turned out to be much smoother and more delicate, with a subtle note of rosemary. After my first bite, I actually preferred the lardo to butter.After placing our 4-course orders, the antipasti promptly arrived. Spread like a slim deck of cards were thinly sliced sunchokes topped with walnut crumbles and truffled fonduta cheese. Mr. Batali does wonders with vegetables and salads (Winter Vegetables Salad at Babbo; vegetable sides at Otto), and this dish was no exception.The only difference between Del Posto's 5-course prix-fixe menu (for $52/person) and the 4-course ""recession menu"" is: The participating table must choose one primi (pasta course) served ""family style"" (as opposed to each guest choosing their own). Linda and I unanimously decided on the Garganelli al ragu Bolognese. While the ragu was among the best I've had (robust, savory and meaty), I found the homemade spinach noodles to have a ""fishy"" aftertaste. I pushed the pasta aside with my fork, and used the homemade bread to sop up all of the ethereal Bolognese sauce.Though I felt like a bad Jew for having ordered the ""Pork Arista"" as my entrÃ©e, our waiter said that it was one of his two favorite dishes. He irresistibly described how the meat sat atop a pumpkin puree and was finished with garlic and mushrooms. Upon cutting in to my first bite of pork, I knew that the pig had been overcooked. Though having a perfectly seasoned and caramelized crust, the meat was simply too tough. Needless to say, I was disappointed.All of the desserts on the menu looked fantastic, though I was craving a simple bowl of gelato. I received two-scoops each of vanilla and chocolate, beautifully topped with a slice of homemade biscotti. Linda, who had previously dined in Del Posto's main room, asked our adorable waiter-in-training if guests in the enoteca received complimentary petit fours (as those in the main dining room do). He smiled and said, ""Let me see what I can do."" Moments later, a plate filled with an assortment of house made treats, including shortbread, lemon squares and pate de fruit, arrived before our eyes (thanks again, Daniel M.!). Upon receiving our bill, I wasn't sure which was more enticing: The price of our meal or the decadent plate of sweets.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

The meal here lacked what I consider cheap ways to satisfy customers, namely over-salting, over-buttering, or over-frying things (""over"" is the key word). At first, I was wary because our amuse bouche was mini panini and another bread-like carb that I hardly ate. But it just got better and better afterwards. The fresh warm bread basket of 4 types of bread along with 2 different butters was delish. Great date place because of the space, lighting, and lofty-feeling. Dessert just felt like it was never-ending...instead of a petite 4, it was more like 6. aw yea, the italians do it right! The only thing I didn't love was that it leans towards being fancy...you can't just walk in, grab a seat, and chow down. Hipsters would feel out of place.

Â Everything worked like clockwork in terms of service. Â There was not a moment that was not on point, not a fork astray. Â The sommelier was very nice and recommended a great bottle of Chianti. Â I also give props that it was one of the cheaper wines on the list (in general it is a very expensive wine list).As for food, the lobster antipasti had alot of lobster. Â That was impressive. The pastas however weren't quite up to my expectations.The agnolotti was a little bland and I'm not quite sure what meat was in it. The spaghetti with crab, jalapeno, and scallion was cooked al dente just the way I like it, really nicely balanced with the spices and crab, and a bit unique.Now put away that abundant bread basket. The winner of the meal was the wild salmon. Â It was fantastic and possibly changed my view of what salmon can do. It was the surprise of the evening and the favorite dish of the night. It was rich, balanced, with an excellent texture almost like butter, and the mustard seeds and grains gave it a nice flavor.For dessert, the peach nectarine tart was really fresh and the ice cream alongside it was rich and creamy and tasted yes very homemade.

What was disappointing is that we (4 asians) were sitting all the way in the corner. Shortly there after, the table next to us all the way in the back were also asians. Then the table next to us was an asian couple... We noticed a trend here and made the experience less than what it could have been. The pumpkin ravioli was great, everything I'd hoped. The spaghetti was something that reminded me of something i whipped up in college on the run. Italian pastas places have always been sort of a bias for me as pasta was always the easiest and cheapest thing to survive on in college so why I paid triple the price for spaghetti is beyond me, perhaps my palette is not sophisticated enough but knowing that, as long as i enjoyed the meal, so be it. The main entrees were so-so. Tried the lobster, pork, and lamb. Nothing special. The dessert though was quite creative and unique. The olive oil gelato with pistachio, coffee ice cream dish, and panna cotta were all very good.

Perfect al dente. The sauce is not complicated, but still hold up elegantly with the green pasta. The dessert was a ricotta on top of vanilla cake with a blueberry compote thing. Compote was really thick and sour, the compote was probably reduced many times. Ricotta was a bit dry and separated easily from the cake, but the cake achieved the quality of being moist and dense to the perfection.

The food was four star pretty much throughout but the service was abysmal to the point that I wouldn't go back or even recommend it. Â We arrived on time for our 8:45 reservation and were directed to wait at the bar as though that were standard operating procedure. Â When we inquired how long it might be, the maÃ®tre'd told us a couple of minutes. Â  Given that we didn't order any drinks and patiently waited for about 10 minutes before approaching the podium. Â  The response was ""they're just setting the table."" Â After another 10 minutes, I went back to the podium and, after asking my name for the third time, he said ""Yes, it's ready."" Â No apology or explanation. Â I just couldn't help thinking how different the experience would have been had we been greeted with an ""I'm sorry but it's going to be 20 minutes before your table is ready; please be our guests for a drink at the bar while you wait.""Once our party of four was finally seated at the table, things went from bad to worse. Â The waiter was way too important for that job and was sure to let us know. Â He said nothing to describe the dishes on the menu and when we inquired about a couple of the main courses (I recall there were a total of seven or eight) he asked, exasperated, ""Do you want me to describe ALL of them?""By then even the excellent food couldn't salvage the evening. Â After we finished our first bottle of wine, no one told us it was empty so we had one course with no wine while the sommelier was located to order the second bottle. Â Oh, and the second bottle? That they did tell us that one was empty and insisted that was the case even though we questioned it.

The ambiance is Great, there are so many truly Italian notes and hints throughout the restaurant and the menu. The service is VERY good but a bit cold and pretentious, and the food was really good...but not AMAZING. We were there for my birthday yesterday and had the lesser-expensive tasting menu of $115/person. After everything was said and done with tax and tip the dinner was over $400. I think this is the most we've spent on a single dinner for 2, and it was good, but not $400+ good. We have had better overall dinners (scene/service/food) for half of what we paid last night; Â On a separate note, they dont allow corking, so if you brought a special bottle of wine that you want for your birthday they make you check it in the coat check - annoying - So if youve got money to burn then this is your place....but if you want a special place with amazing food that wont break the bank, go elsewhere....Sorry Mario.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

I felt so well taken care of. The building is beautiful, live piano music playing, phenomenal ambiance. Although the restaurant was crowded, it wasn't noisy at all. I came here for lunch. They first bring you an amuse bouche, which I have no recollection of what is was, only that it was amazing. Later they'll bring a bread basket with lardo and butter. We finished up the bread selection and they replenished our basket. Something I've never seen before in other restaurants. I got the lobster salad, with a supplement of $10, then caciucco (a seafood stew finished on the table), luna piena pasta ($10 supplement) and pecorino cake (to die for). The taste of pasta (luna piena) could only be brought to the table if all the party agreed to have it. So it was $20 for the pasta +$20 supplement (why supplement for the pasta?). $40 for the tiniest amount of pasta (seriously, 2 strings of a thick papardelli) I have ever seen, but the best pasta I have ever put in my mouth. A glass of pinot grigio set me back $20...for a glass! The waiter asked if I was celebrating anything special and I said it was my birthday, so they decorated my desert plate and put a candle with it...nice touch. They also brought the box of little candies and italian doughnut. So good! All in all, the great $39 lunch deal ended up being $100 per person, but I walked out happy with the experience and mostly with the food.

1172,bJY15-TC09uyvpDvZH2RnA,Jenny J.,5.0 star rating,"i don't think i've ever had such a pleasant lunch in my life. Â del posto is now one of my favorite restaurants along with aldea. Â i knew that i was going to have a wonderful meal here, but i was not expecting to be blown away by it. Â I WAS.i went with a couple of friends and we opted for the $29 lunch prix fixe, with the addition of a pasta course for $10. Â great deal. Â the night before, we went to the fatty crab just to see what all the hype was about, and their pf dinner had been $32 (a complete waste of my money imo-- i'm not even trying to compare it to fine dining or anything, but the food was truly terrible, and service was minimal at best). Â my lunch at del posto more than made up for a shitty dinner last night.first off, the dining room is beautiful. Â tables were large but not too large, and very nicely spaced so that, in conjunction with the high ceilings, you would never ever feel cramped. Â they have a pianist playing live music, which you would think might be cheesy, but he really fit in perfectly with the space. Â my friends and i were under-dressed for the restaurant, but i felt no pretension coming from any of the staff. Â i don't know if it's because this was lunch or something, but i think this was the most comfortable fine dining experience i've ever had. Â the server/runners (with the exception of one) spoke loudly and clearly and i did not miss any of the descriptions of the components of the dishes, something that usually happens more than a couple of times at fine dining restaurants. Â for my purse, a little foot stool (or..purse stool) was brought, so i wouldn't have to place my belongings on the ground, or have it against my back.i thought the three amuses were very clever. Â they truly presented a variety of textures, giving your mouth a sort of foreplay to the meal. Â since there are three people working the amuse station, you know how seriously they treat diners' first impression of the restaurant's food.all the breads are made in-house, which i appreciate. Â i was surprised that there was no olive breads, and i had only the focaccia. Â i liked how the focaccia wasn't insanely oily, though i was surprised at how un-focaccia-like it was... more bready if you know what i mean-- but was delicious with the lardo.for my first course, i had the roasted winter vegetables with robiola sformato & truffled hazelnuts. Â absolutely delicious, and i would usually never order a vegetable plate. Â it was a tasting of many different winter veggies with a couple of smears of robiola. Â so fresh and simple.i went for the orechiette with lamb neck ragu, lentils, and green mustard for my primi. Â i was glad that they did not offer any pasta with seafood in it (something i generally don't care about, except at marea). Â it was a very straightforward and light pasta dish, with the orechiette not too al dente (which i prefer). Â the dollops of mustard greens puree added a necessary kick to the ragu. Â however, they say you first eat with your eyes. Â the color of the sauce was a little off-putting, having been gray-ish, and the green mustard gradually lost the intensity in color and browned a little as i worked my way through the course. Â nonetheless, it was delicious, and i would order it again the next time i went, if only i didn't want to also try the other pastas offered.for secondi, i ordered the arctic char with watercress, black truffles, and trumpet mushrooms. Â the trumpet mushrooms were a little too hard for me, but it definitely did add to the texture of the dish. Â the fish itself was cooked perfectly. Â it could have been seasoned a little bit more. Â i really don't mind food that's a little bland since i think it makes the dish a little lighter, but i really think that the flavor of the fish would have come through better had it been seasoned more. Â either way i thought this dish was great and enjoyed it thoroughly. Â there were some chestnuts as garnish that went extremely well with the char.i picked the spezzata di castagne for dessert. Â i honestly have not had such a sophisticated dessert in a long time. Â the chestnut cake was soft and moist with a distinct crunch on the outside. Â in addition to the warm/cold contrast, the yogurt gelato added creaminess and tartness to the mildness of the cake and sweetness of the plums. Â this dessert probably made my year of desserts.the petite fours were as thoughtful as the amuses. Â there were many different textures presented, as well as various flavors and techniques. Â i thought that the chocolate truffles were especially clever-- chocolate truffles shaped as fungi.because a friend of ours works in the kitchen, we asked to tour it and to see her. Â the manager who showed us around was extremely helpful in explaining the setup of the kitchen as well as the wine cellar and restaurant itself. Â in general the service was just impeccable.

We didn't mean to patronize Iron Chef locations specifically, it just kind of ended up that way. Next time, it will be the anti-Iron Chef tour... But I digress. Del Posto: The three stars I give Del Posto are almost exclusively for service and atmosphere. The place is dazzlingly beautiful and elegant. In all of my dining experience, it is among the top three most visually luscious restaurants I have ever had the pleasure to sit in. (Number one, however, is far and away the Las Vegas Aureole. Helllooo, suede walls? Three-story wine tower? Yes.) The earthy, cool touches of $2 million worth of marble were used judiciously, accented with warm golden lamplight, soft earth-toned leather, and down cushions. It was a truly luxurious physical and visual experience to sit in that room. The service was stupendous, if a touch formal for my taste. From the sommelier and the waiter, right down to the food runners and the bus boys, everyone was friendly, knowledgeable, professional and perfect in every aspect of their job. Our $95 five-course prix fixe was paced perfectly with the descent of wine in the bottle. Silverware traded out and plates removed without ruckus--we hardly noticed the necessary machinations of the staff as they prepared our table for the next course. The food, however, was disappointing at large with a couple of standouts. The amuse busch of fried brandino and potato dumplings with spicy tomato paste was delicious, but the little shot of ""soup"" that came with them tasted exactly what it was: pasta water with herbs. The artichoke heart chips were almost wonderful, except they disappeared on the tongue they were so delicate. The Archdiocese of New York should bless these things as the Host. My salumi insalata appetizer was full of fatty, grisly textures and flavors. I've had good salumi, and this was not it. My friend's sausage appetizer was much better, to my taste. But she didn't particularly like it. With the pasta dishes, Molto Mario lived up to his reputation. The spaghetti with dungeness and the gnocchi with pork ragu were both bordering on phenomenal. However, one couldn't help but remember, in a place such as New York, you could find comparably fabulous and interesting pasta dishes at inspired and interesting Italian restaurants across the five burroughs--provided you knew where to look. And cheaper, too. The entrees were next. The smoked lobster for my friend and the duck for me. I had no complaints about the roasted duck breast on a little mound of delicious celery root, except for the little egg cup of solidified duck fat that came on the side, like some sort of delicacy. Maybe for Mario, but I like my lard still attached to the meat. My friend's lobster dish was... dull. Not in that needs-salt way, but that, wow, how-do-you-make-lobster-so-boring way. It had an almost interesting smoky flavor that didn't do much for the lobster meat, and the accompanying pasta had little more going on than a bit of spicyness. It was a wonderful evening out--excellent wine, beautiful, warm, comfortable place, Â perfect service, and most important, great company... but for all of that, we left feeling a little not so molto fantastico about Mario.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

1189,LrbXm5IfTZYThUlK52B7Zw,b w.,2.0 star rating,"I just read a number of the reviews posted here and perhaps I'm picky but I was not very impressed with Del Posto. Â The decor is over-the-top, Vegas style (Hell's Kitchen, anyone?), from the marble stairs to the leather menus that reek of..well...leather, it's just a bit too ostentatious for the purported rustic Italian fare. Â The food was, unfortunately, less impressive than the surroundings.As we waited for our fourth, we had a drink in the bar, accompanied by a few snacks - the potato chips were merely fine; the mixed nuts and Japanese style crunchy rice things were just ok but the cold dried fried pasta coated with cheese was off-putting. It looked like pork rinds but tasted like a packet of dried cheese you would add to some macaroni. Â On to dinner...We opted for the 5 course menu, two courses are pasta, the choice of which the entire table must agree upon. The house provided 3 amuse bouche for each of us, none of which were particularly amusing to my mouth: 1) beignet stuffed with salami should have been light and crispy and slightly salty - instead it was mushy and chewy and so salty I wast tempted to spit it out; 2) some sort of soup with a goat cheese foam on top - the ""foam"" was too thick, like shaving cream and because it was also cold, it felt filmy in the mouth against the warm, not hot, soup - not an appetizing juxtapostion. The third mini portion was minted fresh peas with bits of fried parmesan - this was the best tasting of the three but was also the smallest and most confusing to eat - fork, fingers? We were given an ample bread basket with butter and Mario B's signature ""lardo,"" which is rendered pork fat - sort of the goy version of schmaltz but not nearly as tasty. The bread basket offered a very nice variety, fresh from the oven. I especially like the very buttery bread stick.For the antipasti, I ordered the mousse of foie gras with balsamic strawberries and almond flavored lady fingers. The mousse itself was light and fluffy and very tasty, as were the strawberries but the pairing with the slightly sweet ladyfingers (looked more like men's toes) was a bit odd. I also tasted one of my companion's antipasti - a terrina of various meats in gelee. One of the meat bits tasted like Chinese roast pork and the other was not identifiable. Â It was served with homemade mustard. Â For the first pasta course we were served rabbit ravioli in butter with slivers of asparagus. It was delicious - perfectly cooked pasta, slightly salty rabbit meat and crispy bits of asparagus. The next pasta was also quite good - small pieces of spaghetti like pasta, though thicker and chewier, with fresh lump crab meat, scallions and bits of jalapeno to add some heat. Â We should have ordered a la carte and gone for pasta because the next course, the secondi, was not good. I chose the halibut which was plain, not well seasoned and, in my opinion, slightly undercooked. Another dinner companion had pork loin which appeared as an underdone hunk of meat in the middle of her plate. Â Sure, we know you don't have to cook pork until it's dried up but this was still a little too pink. The outside edges were tasty, once you cut through the fat but much of the meat was left on the plate. Our other companions thought their main courses were just ok as well. Â For dessert, I chose a chocolate ricotta cake. It was served too chilled and, consequently, had very little flavor -- or maybe my taste buds had had too much by that point and refused to work. The selection of cookies they provided was nice and, the wine (one bottle of Italian chardonnay and one Barbera) was excellent.If I were to go there again, I would order a la carte and stick to the pasta. The portions of the 5 course menu were understandably quite small, except for the secondi which was inexplicably large. Â I imagine a full portion of either pasta would have satisfied much more than the disappointing fancy little bits we did get.Besides the bread, pasta and wine, the other saving grace of the meal was the service. Our waiter, Piero, was chatty and funny and the other wait staff were very attentive as well. Overall, we spent more than $600 for 4.

Â I mean how often do I treat myself to a meal that's costs a little under $200 (for just myself), especially when I can use that for shoes!Originally we came in wanting to have order a few apps and have a few drinks, I know...we made a reservation one month ahead of time for apps! Â But then we walked in...and it was beautiful. Â I felt like Zelda Fitzgerald or something, it really was so Fitgeraldesque! Â There should have been a jazz band playing off in the corner somewhere. Â Call me crazy, but I wanted to live there!So anyway, we sat down took one look at the menu and OUT went the plan of a few drinks and apps, and in came the idea to just go for the tasting menu. Â A lot more food that I had previously expected to have, but it was all amazing and one of the better decisions I've made! Â I remember how good the bread they offered us was. Â They also left a little dish of this butter looking stuff next to it. Â I mentioned to my friend that it looked sort of like lard (and I love lard) and she asked me to try it first, so I obliged and went for it. Â Oh my God, what I tasted was AMAZING, it was the best pork tasting lard ever. Â Someone walked by and I asked him what it was and he replied ""you don't want to know"" as he laughed, and I said ""is it lard"" and he said ""well it's lardO""! Â Which brings me to this question, why isn't lardo served with bread in more places. Â I'm not a big fan of butter anyway. Â (On a sidenote, it is on the menu at SPQR in San Francisco). Â As for the rest of the food, gnocchi with pork was my favorite, and was when I fell in love with gnocchi, really and truly (see my profile under current crush). Â I also loved the salmon and insalata caprese which was so different than any other I had ever tasted, and also included cucumber pieces. Â I can't remember what else I ate, the desserts were delicious, but I loved when they wheeled the cart with all the goodies in big glass jars to our table. Â They gave us a plate full of small sweets, and even a small homemade Oreo cookie!The restaurant itself was beautiful and so elegant and grand, the food was outstanding and mouth-wateringly delicious, and the service was nearly flawless. Â I honestly felt like royalty. Â And now you know why the one word I used to describe this place, is PHENOMENAL!P.S. Â My life will not be complete if I never am able to enjoy another meal here.

The first course (spaghetti) was grossly undercooked to the point where you couldn't even chew the pasta. Â I will admit that we did like the sauce on this. Â When we mentioned the poorly cooked meal to the waiter, he said he would try to do something about it, but never came back with another entree or a redo on the same entree.The second pasta dish was pretty salty, although definitely cooked better. Â The main course, of the 3 we ordered, the chicken was great. The beef was ordinary and the trout dish was basically boiled fish with ragu on top. Â It was disgusting.

Â now let me just say, the bread basket is pretty darn good. Â if youre a fan of carbs, eat the bread basket. they come in pairs of breadsticks, baguettes, olive breads, and rolls with a lard spread and butter. Â man its nice.

Â i just spent a paragraph on bread.for our first courses we got the autumn vegetables and the seared lamb tenderloin. Â now...im a fan of meat over veg and day and when she decided to order the vegetables im thinking in my head...what are you thinking!? Â really? Â but as our plates came out, i looked at both and both were plated real nicely. Â i dug into my lamb app and it was cooked perfectly. Â the taste was a bit tangy for me but overall it was a good dish. Â the veg plate i was pretty skeptical. Â who just wants vegetables? Â but after trying it, i had to give it some respect. Â it was well cooked with simple flavors. Â the truffled hazelnuts was a great touch to it as well.for our second course she got the orecchiette with lamb neck sausage and i got the wood grilled lobster. Â i have mixed reviews on the lobster. Â the pasta came out nice. it was cooked to a perfect al dente, lamb neck sausage well seasoned. Â it was definitely good but would want to try other items on the menu. Â as for my lobster. Â man...such a high and low point for me with that dish. Â the lobster was cooked to perfection. Â nice and juicy, the sauce was real nice with it. Â oh yes. Â it was good. Â but then there was that pasta that was served with it. Â man. Â that ish tasted like spaghetti-o's. Â what the fox?

Â for our final course my friend decided to be a bit adventurous and chose the sfera di caprino with celery and fig and the celery sorbet. i went with the chocolate tortino with extra virgin olive oil gelato. the sfera was okay. it was a different taste, something that a lot of us arent accustomed to. i feel that it'd be more of an acquired taste. if you're looking for a palette cleanser, thats it right there. now for the chocolate tortino. man that stuff was good. the plating was great. a small chocolate cake with a little wedge cut out, leaning on the cake. crusted with crushed pistachios and a scoop of gelato on the side.

1209,5Cf48Tcf65JlftzQG0Va7Q,Ryan C.,4.0 star rating,"I ate here with a party of four on July 4th, and after reading some negative reviews (not here), we were all pleasantly surprised by the flawless meal. The meal started with four amuse bouches, including a very refreshing cucumber and something soup. Next up was an excellent bread basket, which was accompanied by butter and (in case butter's too healthy for you) lardo. They offer an option to order three pastas for the table, which are then presented as separate courses. Obviously, you could just order your own pastas and share them, but this option allows you to avoid appearing undignified by reaching over and stealing food from your companions' plates. Plus, it allows you to sort of create your own tasting menu and it's fun to have course after course of pasta arrive at your table. Everyone agreed that each of the three pastas we had was, at worst, very good. Both the orecchiette with lamb neck sausage and the spaghetti with crab and habanero oil were particularly good. I shared a Duck for 2 as my main course, which was very good, but I'd had so many tasty things by this point that my brain must have been struggling to make new taste memories. I do remember that it was cooked perfectly. Unfortunately, we were running short on time, so we decided to skip dessert. It was particularly disappointing because some of the desserts sounded amazing, including the tasting of three chocolates accompanied by three rums. But Macy's wasn't going to postpone the fireworks show for us, so we had to skedaddle. As we were discussing the possibility of stopping at a bakery on the way to the fireworks, we were pleasantly surprised by a large plate of cookies/small dessert bites. It was a perfect end to the meal: my craving for something sweet was satisfied and I was still able to walk out without assistance. I still regret giving the second and final bite of my chocolate ganache to my girlfriend.All in all, it was a great experience. The service was nearly flawless (although the sommelier seemed to still be learning the ropes) and the tables have a lot of space between them, so it feels like you're having a very private dining experience in the beautiful expansive room. And as I think I've made clear, the food was all very good. There was nothing resembling a dud. On the other hand, nothing was truly transcendent. For a restaurant this expensive to get the final star from me, it needed to provide at least one taste that totally blew me away.Added note - the Enoteca is essentially a separate restaurant under the same roof. It has a more basic menu and the tables are more crammed together, but if you want a more affordable meal in a more relaxed atmosphere (one of the tables near us shared their dessert with strangers at an adjoining table), it's an excellent choice. There's a four course prix fixe for $45 that allows you to order any antipasto, primi, secondi, and dessert off the Enoteca menu. Everything I had at the Enoteca on a separate occasion was very good.

I've been waiting to eat at this place after hearing loads of good buzz, and finally got my chance last Friday. What an absolutely delightful dining experience.A friendly doorman greeted us upon entry, and they checked our coats for free. The room is quite large; I believe it was formerly a bank or something, and either way it's a big enough space for a nightclub. The doorway leads to a small corridor which bisects the restaurant from left to right or north & south, though the area on your left is a much smaller bar area. On the right side, there's a large dining area with perhaps 50 nicely spaced tables, and additional tables sit on a second level overlooking the dining area. We were seated promptly by a very attentive staff.The meal was gorgeous. We had the five course tasting menu ($85) - starter, two pastas, a main, and a desert. I began with the Yellow Fin & Yellow tail crudo - some unctuous cubes of raw tuna and some sashimi cut yellowtail dressed with a bit of salt, oil & micro greens. Refreshing Â & yummy! The pasta courses come for the table to split, socializing the dining experience because the group must pick two and share them. We opted for Pumpkin Black Truffle ravioli and gnocchi with lamb ragu. the ravioli was probably my favorite course - sweet, smooth pumpkin wrapped in a delicate but firm pasta nicely pricked up with just the right amount of truffle. They inadvertently brought us a garganelli verde with a meat sauce next, and comped us that and then brought the gnocchi, which was delightful as well. A small portion of perfectly cooked potato dumplings in a light, flavorful lamb ragu. Perfect. They also had a crab & jalapeo spaghetti which looked pretty wicked. Next time.The mains were great as well. They have a selection of fish and meat, and then some larger options to share (lamb chop for two, etc). I had a pork loin which was great - perfectly cooked with a nice peppery crust. My buddy has the venison which was OK - perhaps a tad undercooked but still good. I had sheep's milk cheesecake for dessert, which was delish!The wine list is vast and has many high priced options - they have like 3 pages of Brunello and 6 of Barollo. It's all Italian and I know a bit about Italian, but it was still daunting. The sommeliers weer very helpful. We had a Kraufass Pinot Nero 2003 first which was light and lovely ($60) and a Vino Nobile di Montepulciano 2001 second, which was earthier, heartier and wonderfully paired with our meat dishes. I ventured to order a half bottle, they opened a full, and just gave it to us for half price. Nice tough.On my way out the door, I bumped into Lydia and spoke to her for a moment. She was lovely and thankful we had come and enjoyed our food. Her passion for food exudes throughout this outstanding place. Go there tonight.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

We were enjoying our last night in NYC, we'd just had a late dinner nearby and I suggested we go take a look at Del Posto but my husband thought having a nice drink would be even better. We were dressed well but I didn't know if our nice jeans were dressy enough, it was also just about midnight and we didn't know when they were closing, I decided to ask at the door if it was too late for a drink at the bar. They welcomed us in so nicely! We had two drinks each, both of mine were limoncello (they make it in-house)and vodka martinis and they were seriously divine. It was fun to see the waitstaff gather around at the bar and enjoy some scotch together at the end of a long day. We lingered in their lovely little bar area booth and realized it really was the perfect ending to our trip.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
1219,9tgeaozbeebvFNcG03t7PA,Susan L.,3.0 star rating,"First, a quick caveat: I give Del Posto three stars because it fulfills the ""A-OK"" description set out by Yelp, not because it's bad. I've noticed a lot of ratings inflation on Yelp and elsewhere, so I just want to make things clear: this is not a negative review.That being said, I think that the managers at Del Posto would surely be chagrined for just being deemed ""A-OK."" And of course, they'd be right--a place as grand and with as much potential as Del Posto should command a much more enthusiastic rating.I eat out a lot and at a wide range of restaurants. The defining element between places like Del Posto and smaller neighborhood joints isn't necessarily the pleasure derived from a meal but the pleasure of the experience--so, basically, service. We go to Del Posto not only for the incredible food, but for the feeling of being part of a carefully-choreographed symphony where our needs are being met (and, even better, anticipated). Unfortunately, the symphony at Del Posto was out of tune--a head waiter that was either new, nervous, or just not a natural fit--we had a much more natural rapport with the sommelier (Lacey - truly wonderful, knowledgeable, attentive, warm). This was generally true of the rest of the staff--everything fairly efficient, but cold. Not what I expected, especially in an Italian restaurant where the flavors are so warm and inviting. I really did feel that Del Posto's size left it at a disadvantage--the floor was bustling with waiters, sub-waiters, busboys, managers, etc., and yet our dinner was an incredibly depersonalized experience. I think they really missed out here; they seem to have strayed from some of the cardinal characteristics of fine dining. The night felt like a copy of a copy--all the forms looked right, but something had gotten lost in translation.If this sounds too picky, then fine; I'm just trying to relate my experience. The one case where they did clearly make a mistake was when they failed to bring out our (raw) appetizers in a reasonable amount of time - we sat at 8 and didn't get our appetizers until some point between 9 and 9:15, after we asked about the wait and it became clear that our waiter had forgotten about them. Then again, that seems to hinge on our waiter (see above), but an attentive floor manager should have realized something was wrong.Finally, the food itself - all delicious (remember, this isn't a negative review!). All interesting. I found some dishes a little TOO flavorful--as I've seen in other reviews, certain elements punched through, rather than blending, but that is a stylistic choice and I respect the chef for his bold taste. We had the tasting menu (five courses) - the portions were too large for me, so I had to eat only about half of what I was served, but my husband ate his meal with gusto and enjoyed it. The wine list is extremely reasonable; we appreciated being given a wide range of options vis-a-vis price - we certainly weren't pigeonholed into buying expensive wine, although we ended up getting one because it was a special occasion. The list is, unsurprisingly, mainly Italian - we don't know a whole lot about Italian wine, but we were able to explain what characteristics we usually enjoy in wine and were matched up with a truly wonderful bottle. So thank you to Del Posto for a pleasant evening; I hope that the dining experience warms up to match the quality of the food, but even if they make no changes I would recommend it to any foodie or person celebrating a special occasion. That being said, I won't put this on my ""must-return"" list--I clearly prefer a more attentive style!",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

The environment is very spacious, cool and somewhat cavernous. The staff was semi-attentive which was alright with me. Sometimes I'd rather have an evening when the help is a little lax like they were that evening. With regard to the food, without dissecting the entire meal we opted for the tasting menu, which was good-not great by any stretch of the imagination. However Â I am very compelled to say that it was by far the smallest portions of a tasting menu I have ever seen in my life. (the size of the pasta serving in the tasting menu was a little more than a teaspoon serving.) For the love of God if you are remotely hungry DO NOT order the tasting menu. Maybe you might be better off choosing another restaurant. Â One thing I can assure you is that Mario Battali did not get to be the size he is eating at Del Posto, that's for damn sure, especially the tasting menus. Don't get me wrong, I fully understand what a tasting menu is and what the portion size would be and what I am to expect, but this was ridiculous.I'll return to the restaurant one more time to give it another chance and to post my in-depth review.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

My party of 6 ordered the prix fixe 5 course menu ($95) and chose two pastas (two - three bites per plate per person) and our own appetizer and main dish. I had the beef tartare and the lobster tail, respectively. The lobster was a bit tough, to my surprise. But the service was amazing, one server per person I believe, and the main guy, kindly and unassumingly went through the entire Italian menu with us monoglots. The desserts were wonderful and the second, birthday, dessert was great too - and I can't remember but they brought a bottle of sparkling wine. I'm sure we had to pay for that but honestly it was all so good I don't remember. I recommend this for a special, very adult dinner, when you're prepared to pay $160 per person for a meal. Worth it!

This dish should zing!Main of a veal chop for two was a great piece of meat, but so salty...and the veggies of cavolo nero and er mushrooms? Same as the clams. Zero flavor. How do you kill kale and mushrooms.Desert was tartuffo. Nice. That's it. Wine pairing was very good.Dinner took forever, 3.5 hours for five courses. Half an hour wait between main course and desert.

In fact for such a large place, it was quite intimate and the conversation was always kept at a pleasant buzz. 3rd star for the exceptional staff. Really. Probably some of the best service I've ever gotten, I am very surprised since we were in the Meatpacking but since this isn't in the direct vicinity of Gansevoort or Little W12th street I suppose thats why the doucebaggetry hasn't permeated the place. OK back to my main point, the staff is amazing. Everybody from the doorman, coatcheck girl, reservation girl, maitre d', waitstaff, busboy, etc were prim, proper, polite, and very accomodating. Now onto the food which gets maybe half a star at best. I wanted to like this place. No..I wanted to LOVE this place..but I didn't. The food was flavorful but not in the way that makes my mouth water. It was full of odd flavors. For example, seems like everyone gets that little shot of soup as an opener with two little plates of puffed savory pastry things. I eat weird food, people so nothing really phases me or grosses me out. But this shot of soup and pastry thing just did not taste right. It didn't taste BAD..but it just did not taste right. I just can't describe it. This goes for the rest of the dishes I had for dinner as well. I have a very developed palette and am not a snooty or picky eater but the dishes did not wow me. Not to mention, they were tiny. Now I don't mind paying $25+ for a dish of tiny food as long as it's a dish of amazingly delicious tiny food but the pasta was tiny. It was not cooked al dente, in fact it was kind of too firm. Porkchop was not bad though, I have to say. The bread and butter and lard thing they give is also delicious, like everyone said. I'm just disappointed by my primi's and secondi's. Maybeee just maybeee I did not order the right things? The table next to ours was raving, practically hootin and hollerin about how good every morsel of their food was so that could be a possibility. I would recommend Del Posto for anyone who wants to impress a date (because who eats that much on a first date anyway?) but would probably not come back any time soon.

1252,AWb7EecRc7wjeHy1OWx9-A,Donna F.,1.0 star rating,"Expensive, scene-y and totally crappy. Having eaten at all of Batali's restaurants, I gotta say, dude is as over as a Pashmina shawl. Del Posto belongs in a strip mall. It's big, loud, totally impersonal and completely forgettable, except for the egregiously expensive menu. We were a party of eight and were forced to do the $95 prix fixe menu per person. And of course, for that price, no substitutions are allowed. The food sucked -- beef consome with zero zest or flavor, mediocre Olive Garden-esque pasta, and for my entree, a tasteless, limp halibut. That's what $95 gets you there. Oh, and did I mention major helpings of attitude and a waitress that disappeared for 25 minutes at a time, without explanation. If you're stuck in that neck of the woods, go across the street to Morimoto, which is heavenly.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Â We had to wait a little while before we were seated (our res was for 9 on a Tuesday, we got seated around 9:25) and when I expressed a little displeasure, they promptly brought passion fruit us mimosas which helped pass the time. Â The food was incredible (veal chop, wild mushroom appetizer and an amazing caramel cake for dessert) and felt really different than the other fancy places in town that seem to blend together sometimes. Â I off-handedly mentioned it was my husband's birthday to the host and when dessert arrived, the plate was decorated with Happy Birthday. Â Now that's service!",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
1254,3oJEv6uGn84nLoSh5LfBrQ,Luba R.,2.0 star rating,"The experience was less than great. I found the food to be not exceptional but overly salty, with some flavors overwhelming the dishes rather than complimenting. Nevertheless, I am often willing to overlook these, perhaps, subjective culinary flaws if the overall experience can make up for them. Unfortunately, the service ruined my opinion of this establishment. Server biases against dining pairs of women notwithstanding, Â I suppose I could understand if we were ordering frugally and ""overstaying our welcome"", Â or somehow behaving ""inappropriately"" - however, my (very pregnant) friend and I were quite generous in our appetites, ordering 3 glasses of wine, 2 appetizers and 2 pasta dishes, plus dessert (who can comfortably eat more than that???) and were there simply to catch up and have a good meal. We, however, did not order coffee and were apparently enjoying our conversation too much (we sat for an hour and a half - was this not supposed to be a ""relaxed"" Italian dining experience?), because the head waiter felt compelled to come over and say to us, superciliously, ""What? No coffee?? I thought you were reading War and Peace back here!"" Needless to say, the comment was not appreciated and I will not be returning. There are too many great restaurants in this city that serve amazing food and are not stiff and self-important, as Del Posto is, for me to waste my time and money.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
1255,znGEu0FONw5vxeGncZ0MDg,seth n.,5.0 star rating,"as others have said, this place enormous! Â i was seated in the 'bar' room and could not believe that was only the beginning of what seems like a restaurant that never ends. Â I am actually not a big fan of 'fine' dining. Â the whole 20 different waiters, pretentious clients, intimidating hostesses.... etc... - i prefer more casual, down-home joints, but i digress. i went for the restaurant week promotion (lunch, how decadent!) well, del posto amazed and inspired. Â usually these places skimp on the rest week menus, but i had a delicious heirloom tomato salad, spinach pasta bolognese and budin chocolate desert. Â everything was flawlessly presented with many different delicious touches - my mom (awww) had the same salad, the salmon entree and fruit salad. Â the bread basket was delicious along with a complimentary strawberry belini.

Â from the phenomenal homemade bread basket to the lobster salad fra diavola to the agnolotti dal plin to the orecchiette with lamb neck sausage, the flavors were insane and each dish was beautifully executed. Â the agnolotti was fun to eat, as chef's instructions are to roll each piece of filled pasta in a dish of parmigiano reggiano and eat it with your fingers. that's my type of eatin. for dessert, i ordered the butterscotch semifreddo and bro ordered the chocolate ricotta tortino with olive oil gelato. Â loved both desserts, but the tortino was outrageously good. Â and they serve you a complimentary extra dessert course on a cheese grater consisting of numerous delicious little bites.

1257,HMLxj57Sf6BawOBrS51Z2g,Alexis M.,4.0 star rating,"It's everything about French formal dining in an Italian restaurant. Del Posto is grand and elegant, reminiscent of a bygone era. The appetizers were good, but it is the pasta that really shines here. The entrees were disappointing especially after the exuberant performance in the pasta. The rum and chocolate paring, although gimmicky, is worth the fun and don't forget to leave room for the after dessert cart of goodies. Next time, I would skip the tasting menu and enjoy the pasta with a glass of wine, but the somewhat rigid atmosphere would make me uncomfortable to do so unless I was at the bar.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian

Â my salad was delicious and presented like an abstract piece of art, the pastas (especially the gnocchi with pesto) were delectable and i can't even talk about the lobster primo. Â it was incredible. Â this lobster is going to haunt me because it was too good to be true and the night's special - so who knows if it will return to the menu! Â and, the chocolate ricotta tortino with extra version olive oil gelato was the perfect end to a perfect meal.also, the atmosphere is something out of a swanky movie - think woody allen in his hey-day. Â the lighting is dim, the piano music is live and there are people wearing their sunday finest.

1259,TZnM0nfcrNo9HHSFpMswZg,Mind E.,3.0 star rating,"Sadly, despite excellent food and a staff that appeared very well-meaning, our Fathers' Day dinner was a bit of a mess. Â We were seated 45 minutes late for a 9pm reservation, despite having been assured at 9 and 9:15pm that our table would be available shortly. Â A long wait is made infinitely worse by poor time estimation or, even worse, straight dishonesty with the customer about the expected time to be seated. Â Once we'd been seated, the meal and service were excellent, and it was clear that management was doing its best to make up for our long wait - including providing two free appetizers on top of what we'd ordered. Â Personally, I would've much preferred to be comped for food we DID order, but the gesture was appreciated. Â HOWEVER, at the end of the meal, I found that the complimentary appetizers had been INCLUDED ON OUR CHECK, to the tune of $60 extra. Â I'm sure it was an honest mistake (our server was extremely apologetic, claiming - honestly, in my view - that Â a shift change had occurred and he hadn't been informed of that free appetizers had been provided), but this truly added insult to injury. Â The overall experience was far from horrible, but also far from good, so I'd be surprised if my wife and I returned, and we certainly would NOT trust Del Posto with a special occasion meal again.",Del Posto,4.0 star rating,$$$$,Italian
