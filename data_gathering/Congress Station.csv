There were only a few occasions when they had the rolls. So it would be nice if they could provide more bread options and not focus too much on the bagels.I also wish they stayed open a bit longer, but hey, maybe that's in the works.

It's a great alternative to the super-hip Mod Cup (which has amazing specialty coffee, but doesn't have food and sometimes feels too trendy) and chain coffee shops in the area. The coffee is not the best (I find it too strong), but is high-quality (Intelligentsia). Food is always fresh and prepared as you order. Everything tastes great and is priced reasonably. Above all, the service is amazing. They're always super nice and accommodating, and make you feel welcome.",Congress Station,4.5 star rating,$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Bagels"

They definitely come from one of the local bakeries and reminds me of Dunkin Donuts bagels.  Get a deal going with a local bagel shop for good bagels and this place would be 5 stars easy!",Congress Station,4.5 star rating,$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Bagels"

We ordered 3 breakfast sandwiches: one a delicious egg and cheese on croissant and two were lox on everything bagels and unfortunately when we got home with them we found blue mold on the bagels and the lox/tomatoes were slimy, so those were a waste.

71,5XVqguHdzoln7aWCI7xPsQ,Nick D.,4.0 star rating,"Great little stop right on Palisade, very happy to have them around! I've been on a real chai latte kick and they have the best I've tried in town so far. My gal is crazy about the regular lattes as well, and I agree that they're great - Intelligentsia coffee and Kilogram tea seems to be the magic combo at the better coffee stops I've been at lately. Their breakfast sandwiches are very good as well, stock seems to be pretty limited as they run out of bagels in a real hurry on the weekends, but I think that's just growing pains as it's still such a new place. The owners and general staff are all very nice and it's a cozy spot to sit in and take your time enjoying your coffee and food. Seems to be getting loads of business as more new people move to the neighborhood, wishing this joint continued success so I can keep enjoying them!",Congress Station,4.5 star rating,$,"Coffee, &, Tea,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Bagels"

The interior is really homey with art and a original detailed ceiling. The staff are super friendly and make quality food at a pretty good price.

First things first, the coffee is GREAT!! They're no master roasters, but it sure tastes like it. Also they offer bottled drinks and juices, only coffee shop in the area that does. Good selection of pastries and their grill can make just about anything. I asked once for a whole wheat everything bagel which they didn't have at the time, but when I stopped by a day or so later, they added them to the menu! Their bagels are better than any place in downtown JC, which smiles and friendliness to boot.
