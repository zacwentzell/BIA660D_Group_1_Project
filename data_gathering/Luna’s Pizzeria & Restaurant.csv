This mom & pop shop is located in an over populated area, with the rare opportunity for parking that once found, is here to reward you with a South American tour of gastronomy. Normally I steer away from places that do pizzas and pupusas but the Luna family can do no wrong with either!Here are my top 5 items:1. Empanadas - Fried in corn meal goodness, these little half moon delights come filled with cheese or chicken or beef. My favorite are the heart stopping cheese ones as an appetizer to more gluttony.2. Pupusas - also corn meal and fried, but round and stuffed with your choice of meat or cheese and comes with this really special pickled cabbage salad to add spice. These come as a combo set to really make it a full meal. If you like spice, don't forget to add some aji....but beware, it's homemade with jalapenos!3. Steak Sandwiches - For a long, long time....ok until today...I can't go to Luna's and NOT get a steak sandwich. They make them with real steak on the grill (no frozen steak ums), lots of fresh veggies, cheese and french fries inside....yes, inside! They are large enough to share...but really, you won't want to.4. Lechon - For pork loving folks like my family, they can't leave Luna's without a tray of Lechon (roast pork) to go. Unlike in some places where it's all dry and dull, Luna's makes it fresh everyday and keeps it moist, where the meat is tender to the bite.5. Pizza - This is kind of obvious, but with all the options you will be least likely to order a slice....and quite possibly miss out on some of the best pizza in the area. And for a $1 a slice, you may just want to take some as a late night snack.They have a daily combination platter special that includes your choice a meat (variety of chicken, pork or meat) and 2 sides of rice, beans, plantains, etc for very super cheap.And don't forget to get a slice of their double chocolate chip cheesecake for dessert! All in all, I've been coming here for yearsss and well I guess it's time I share my spot with Yelp.P.S. Cash only",Luna’s Pizzeria & Restaurant,4.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"

Fresh ingredients, tasty sauce, and the right kind of crust. The best pizza I've ever had delivered! Plus I love supporting local!",Luna’s Pizzeria & Restaurant,4.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"
2,25SM7d_VzcLPa3c3lUNqDg,Jay R.,2.0 star rating,Ordered a pizza and it tasted like a frozen pizza. It was not that great at all. I thought by reading all the reviews that I was going to find a replacement for my favorite pizzeria that closed but this was not good at all. I will never buy from here again. The service was great and quick but the pizza was so blah. I love pizza and didn't want to eat this.,Luna’s Pizzeria & Restaurant,4.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"

My #1 pizza spot, which is always hot and super cheesy; the way I like it.I don't usually have their Spanish food that they offer, but the times that I have, it was delicious.",Luna’s Pizzeria & Restaurant,4.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"

Every time I order,I get amazing food.The lady that works there is always nice..in person and on the phone. The delivery man (And his young sons who also delivery with him ocassionally) are super nice also. It's a small and cozy family establishment that I will continue to give my business to.",Luna’s Pizzeria & Restaurant,4.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"
5,7E6AHeS_YMgPMhQvieY1jQ,Janella R.,5.0 star rating,"I've been coming here for 10 years now and the food has only gotten better and better. Even the pizza, which use to be kind of crappy, has gotten really good over the last few years! The beef stew and pernil with sides of rice, beans and sweet plantains are my absolute favorite dishes here and for $7 and huge portions, it can't be beat! Not much to look at on the inside/outside and it's small but the food is all that matters to me. Highly, highly recommend Luna's.",Luna’s Pizzeria & Restaurant,4.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"
