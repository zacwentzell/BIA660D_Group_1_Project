Enjoyed the menu and locale sophistication that came with the no frills atmosphere. I enjoyed the talented eats offered during brunch/lunch time. It is refreshing to find a place in the MPD area of NYC that doesn't make you ""over-wait"" like the rest of the hood and overcharge you. It wasn't filled with the usual snobs or bottomless brunch/Kardashian wanna be look a-likes or any of the peeps from across the river looking to have a party instead of breakfast types of places around the neighborhood.It was packed, yet only waited 15 minutes.

There is a small area outside to wait. Inside is not that big (cozy but a little cramped) with few tables and a bar area. The turnover for the table is not as fast as the bar area.We sat at the bar. As for food, we ordered-Good morning sunshine-Pernil RomeroFor drinks, we ordered-dark lemonade with gin added (adding alcohol to soda is  $5 extra)-new orange soda with mezcal addedDrinks were good, and if you like sweeter ones, dark lemonade was the way to go. New orange soda has ginger in it; so I think it might only please some group. Bartender was super nice to let us try different ones before deciding what we want.Food was good with good presentation.Glad they offered me hot sauce for the pernil Romero-- there was so much pulled pork and nothing else really inside the sandwich (as you can see from the photos) so it would've been hard to eat without the sauce and the drink.

The Wild Son is like a cozy little nook in the midst of an overly crowded and trendy area. They have a well curated menu. The cocktails are beautiful and unique and the bartenders are very creative. One of my friend has a lot of food allergies so he made her something special and it turned out great. They've also got a few wines and beers available. They will give a great pour too on a glass of wine :)  I will definitely be coming back here sometime for food as well, brunch menu looks great as does their evening menu.

There is a bar in the restaurant in case you just want drinks.The food and service was pretty quick for lunch time despite the restaurant being a little crowded. My coworkers had buttermilk pancakes and a corn waffle. Although I didn't taste their meals, it looks very appetizing. I had the cauliflower sandwich (vegan). I wanted to try something different with unique ingredients and this was the perfect choice for me. It was delicious!The portion sizes are average for this area of the city. The prices are a little high but once again, this is Manhattan! For drinks, one of my coworkers had the mango turmeric drink and the other had the green juice.

Situated on a faraway edge of Meatpacking, an area I frequented on only one other occasion, The Wild Son is a 15-20 minute walk from PATH/MTA. My +1 and I came on a 12:30-ish Sunday afternoon and waited 30 minutes tops to be seated. We ordered the 'Buckwheat Pancakes' with fresh berries (+$3) and it was spectacular. Sure, an overall $17 is a bit steep (and one would expect some sort of protein to accompany said pancakes for that kind of price tag) but they're executed fluffy, pleasantly sweet, and I'll gladly order them time and time again一this coming from someone who NEVER orders pancakes for breakfast. The butter didn't taste of turmeric but I thoroughly enjoyed the syrupy wildflower honey they used in place of maple. Best pancakes I've had in New York thus far.Every table and counter had at least one sandwich order and all I have to say is...""GET THE BRIOCHE"" because the buns are damn good. We shared 'Good Morning Sunshine' and I liked that the bacon was a braised & pull version instead of the traditional fried & crispy. The sweetness from the bun made the breakfast sandwich so much better than if it was served on non-brioche.The 'Organic Matcha Coconut Lattes' were a nice side piece. Nothing to complain about; comes unsweetened. Who doesn't enjoy a good coconut & matcha mixology?",The Wild Son,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Food and the friendly waitress definitely made up for what happened.So my friend and I went on Saturday morning around 10am and the restaurant was packed already. We opted to sitting at the bar facing outside because that was the only seat left. The waitress came by quick, gave us water, allowed us to settle in to our seats and decide on the menu. After ordering, my friend and I were talking and lost track of time. We looked at the time and saw that an hour had passed since we ordered our food. The waitress then magically appeared before we even got to say something and gave us potatoes (on the house) for the food being late. Another 15-20 mins later, our food comes out. If you have seen pictures from this restaurant, the food presentation especially for the pancakes are pretty nice. Ours looked like someone was in a rush to make them and threw them on a plate. So that was kind of disappointing. At this point, we weren't even hungry from eating most of the potatoes that we took a few bites of the food  we actually ordered and took the rest to-go.

Entrees are all mostly under $15, and it seems like they specialize in different variations of breakfast sandwiches. For the actual food, we ordered the buckwheat pancakes, three sandwiches, a salad, fingerling potatoes, two donuts and cold brew. Buckwheat pancakes was definitely a favorite; the orange turmeric butter was such a nice touch and didn't feel heavy. Loved the fingerling potatoes, they were really crispy and delicious! The cauliflower sandwiches both had great texture and flavor. Definitely try their vegan donuts (apple cardamom and chocolate coconut) if you have a sweet tooth.

Best pancakes I've had in New York thus far.Every table and counter had at least one sandwich order and all I have to say is...""GET THE BRIOCHE"" because the buns are damn good. We shared 'Good Morning Sunshine' and I liked that the bacon was a braised & pull version instead of the traditional fried & crispy. The sweetness from the bun made the breakfast sandwich so much better than if it was served on non-brioche.The 'Organic Matcha Coconut Lattes' were a nice side piece. Nothing to complain about; comes unsweetened. Who doesn't enjoy a good coconut & matcha mixology?",The Wild Son,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Food and the friendly waitress definitely made up for what happened.So my friend and I went on Saturday morning around 10am and the restaurant was packed already. We opted to sitting at the bar facing outside because that was the only seat left. The waitress came by quick, gave us water, allowed us to settle in to our seats and decide on the menu. After ordering, my friend and I were talking and lost track of time. We looked at the time and saw that an hour had passed since we ordered our food. The waitress then magically appeared before we even got to say something and gave us potatoes (on the house) for the food being late. Another 15-20 mins later, our food comes out. If you have seen pictures from this restaurant, the food presentation especially for the pancakes are pretty nice. Ours looked like someone was in a rush to make them and threw them on a plate. So that was kind of disappointing. At this point, we weren't even hungry from eating most of the potatoes that we took a few bites of the food  we actually ordered and took the rest to-go.

I came on a Sunday at around 2:30 PM and waited ~10 mins before being seated. The prices here are super reasonable if you're just ordering an entree + a drink. Entrees are all mostly under $15, and it seems like they specialize in different variations of breakfast sandwiches. For the actual food, we ordered the buckwheat pancakes, three sandwiches, a salad, fingerling potatoes, two donuts and cold brew. Buckwheat pancakes was definitely a favorite; the orange turmeric butter was such a nice touch and didn't feel heavy. Loved the fingerling potatoes, they were really crispy and delicious! The cauliflower sandwiches both had great texture and flavor. Definitely try their vegan donuts (apple cardamom and chocolate coconut) if you have a sweet tooth. They're not to sweet but full of flavor and have the perfect density. Cold brew is not worth getting here.

The pancakes were very soft and fluffy and to my surprise I really enjoyed the unique turmeric/orange butter. The grandma Anna sandwich comes with scrambled eggs, guanciale, chimichurri, and some hot pepper aioli. And if you're someone like me who orders dishes without knowing what certain components are then it'll be useful to know that guanciale is an Italian cured pork cheek. I didn't get to try this component but my friend said it tastes like bacon except saltier. I did get to try some of the eggs and the sauce and it all worked really well with each other.  The fingerling potatoes were crispy on the outside and soft on the side. It was quite a delicious side. For me the buckwheat pancakes takes the win. It was super unique tasting and very delicious!

I knew what to expect: avocado toast, kale, and all those trendy foods, but actually good.I mostly got what I expected, but this branch in the Meatpacking doesn't charm me like their East Village one. It's in the shadow of the Highline, a block away from the Whitney, so it's a popular pick for brunch. We showed up at 12:20 on Saturday to put our names down and were told 20 minutes for a party of 3. Ended up being 30.The place is teeny-tiny, with tables packed together. Acoustics are terrible; it's hard to hear yourself think. It was also uncomfortably warm. It's a cute place, but it's hard to enjoy the vibe when it's so packed.Despite this, the food was very good. My green tartine, with added sunny-side-up egg, was fresh and big, and the spicy green sauce tied everything together. My friend loved her blueberry corn waffle and my boyfriend liked his smoked trout sandwich as well. The quality is high, but it took a while to receive our food as the service is a bit overwhelmed.Overall, I can't say that I would recommend coming here for brunch, as even if you snag a table you'll be among the crowds. I could imagine this being an intimate dinner spot.

Had lunch with my boyfriend here and their menu wasn't too big (which is always great. too many options usually overwhelm me...).I ordered the grain & eggs while my boyfriend had the buttermilk pancakes with bananas & granola and bacon. Our food arrived relatively quickly but before we had our dish, the aroma of the place made my mouth water. When our food finally arrived, I had to say, my boyfriend had a nice heap of pancakes. I was uncertain about how my dish would get me full and thought maybe I should've ordered a side order of potatoes (Spoiler alert: I didn't need anything extra!).My boyfriend's pancakes looked so fluffy and when he gave me a piece, it was one of the fluffiest pancakes I've ever had. It was good and airy. My grains and egg was equally as good but on the opposite spectrum. While his was sweet, mine was savory. I especially loved the popped sunny side egg onto my grains. Delicious!

It is a small little joint tucked away in an alleyway street of meatpacking. Has a whimsical and rustic decor (great place for brunch pics on instagram if you're into that. #Did you really brunch if you didn't gram it??) and yes, you're partly paying for this ambiance. Food: Surprisingly good. We only tried the New Morning sandwich and the blueberry corn waffles. The sandwich was fantastic and I will likely come back to try other combinations. Bread was perfectly crisp and crunchy enough to sop up the sauce from the sandwich. Waffles on the other hand were decent. They came with syrup and a strange yogurt based cream. I could do without the yogurt next time. We also ordered a matcha coconut latte which came in a generous mug, piping hot, and was a perfectly balanced matcha (not too bitter, not too light). Our meal came out to be around $40 for only two entrees and two beverages so while you can certainly find cheaper brunch in NYC, the price is expected for the Chelsea/meatpacking neighborhood.

Drinks came out first: cold brew is strong, wish there was more as it's mostly ice in the glass. Mango Turmeric is heavy on the turmeric side, but somehow tastes better with each following sip. Food comes out a little later; pancakes looking amazing - three fluffy choco chip flapjacks coated in powdered sugar and topped with fresh bananas. Perfectly made and easy to eat. Sandwich includes a thick cauliflower steak, other veggies, and ""hot flower sauce"" . Didn't particularly enjoy the flavor of the sauce/mint/cilantro combo.

I love that the healthy choices are still so flavorful and don't make you feel like you're purposefully making the healthy decision. My friends and I shared the buttermilk pancakes with fresh berries, which were super delicious but obviously not life-changing. I like that they had the syrup on the side, so that it doesn't come soggy and drenched when served. We also shared the all-day everyday salad, which was really good. Light and crisp, but I don't think I would have loved the meal had I just gotten the salad. I got the cauliflower sandwich, which was ridiculously delicious. The baguette that it's served on is so crispy, and the spices used were flavorful (vegan friendly too!). My two other friends each got a sandwich as well.

This sandwich is worth traveling out of my way and I would gladly do it if I had the time. The brioche bun was buttery and held up so well against the fried egg, avocado, and braised bacon. That bacon had to be the star of the sandwich. That bacon was tender, flavorful, and piled high.What brought The Wild Son down from 5 to 4-stars was their service. After putting our name down, we waited a full hour. When we went to check with the hostess about our position in line, she assured us that we would be seated within 30 min. It actually seemed that the hostess had forgotten about us, and 30 min. had come and gone. Once a table opened up, the hostess almost sat the party who came after us before we got up and made eye contact with her.As amazing as that breakfast sandwich is, it's not really worth a 2+ hour wait.

Even though we were one of only a few tables, the food was very slow to come out. Once we saw our food in the window, our server first prepared a take out meal while our sandwich and pancakes sat in the window for several minutes.

I didn't know my life would change from that point forward - every single day since then I've thought about the burrata tartine with guava jam. It was THAT good. Sweet, creamy, a little salty.

72,GOB0-D73iA_CdXskMYHY6w,Monique S.,3.0 star rating,"The area has limited vegan options, so I was glad to check out this place. We were promptly seated when we arrived. For lunch, they offer two vegan options, a cauliflower salad or a shaved kale and farro salad with roasted squash. The salad looked like the healthier option, so I went for it.  It took a while for us to get our main course, but the appetizer my colleagues had (burrata on toast and jam - looked like they enjoyed it) came out promptly.  For the entree, people were seated after us and got their food before we did, even though we ordered similar items. They did come to check on one order and ask what was ordered.The kale salad (All Day, Every Day) was the saltiest salad I ever had. It came with salted granola, but I wasn't expecting it to be that salty. Looking back, I should have had it re-made. Instead, I thought they could fix it, so I asked if they could add more kale instead. I'm not sure if they did. It seems like they tossed the salad and put it in another plate. I asked for lemon to cut the taste, and that was fine. The roasted squash went well with the kale, and it was actually decent enough to finish, not wasting anything but my hydration. It took a while to get the check after we were done, but that was pleasant because we didn't feel rushed.",The Wild Son,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

We all wondered how they were so fluffy yet gluten-free and I may or may not have gotten the secret :) I had the grain bowl with avocado (add on). Basically it's grains with greens and sliced steamed veggies along with avocado and a sunny side up egg on top. Absolutely delicious! There was a short wait but well worth it.

We had the apple cinnamon one. This was good. DISLIKED- Grandma Anna. Unfortunately, I did not like this very much.

I got one of the kale bowls (think it was called the all day everyday) plus egg and it was lovely - just the right amount of vinaigrette and so refreshing. The iced coffee was also great (got it with almond milk), which, after a couple bad recent experiences with pretty watered down ice coffee in New York, was a pleasant surprise. The four vs five stars is for mixed service and bee! On the one hand they didn't pressure us to leave even though we had finished and there was a line (I was surprised when I saw wait outside), but they also did nothing to help us when a bee was totally in our food and wouldn't get away from us! Another patron actually helped us remove the bee (without harm to bee) and freed it outside of the restaurant. So not sure if the former (lack of pushing us to get out when done) was just lack of attentiveness on their part. This place is also a bit far out west, though we visited on a nice weather day so it wasn't an issue. It's also close enough to core areas of meatpacking so doesn't take long to find coffee shops, drinks, shopping (for follow-up post brunch). It's a relatively small restaurant and they don't take resis for brunch on weekends, but the wait this weekend was not bad - like less than 20min for 2 people around noon on a Sunday.",The Wild Son,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

85,pz3Ulbuk7ZiUUbT7oFzmpA,Lori L.,4.0 star rating,"If I had to hazard a guess as to why The Wild Son hasn't attracted that many diners yet, it would be its unexpected location on the West border of Manhattan, a few steps away from The High Line and a number of Meatpacking heavy-hitters. Started by the team behind The Wayland, The Wild Son is situated in the small venue that used to be El Colmado Butchery. It's been transformed into an airy, brightly-lit lunch spot, complete with food-centric books lining the shelves and various framed drawings and paintings interspersed across the walls. It's not a venue meant for large groups or gatherings, so come with one or a few friends for a simple, low-key meal.At first glance, the menu isn't particularly attractive, especially given the fact that an entire section of the menu is devoted to juices and shakes - perhaps not the most attractive option for most diners. Don't be misled, however; the food menu is far more robust than what initially meets the eye, and is rounded out by a number of tempting sandwiches, breakfast plates, and sweets. I opted for a sandwich, while my friend split her meal across two of their dishes - a decision I later wish I had followed suit on.While some dishes follow the trends of late, they're executed well and meticulously presented. The Burrata Tartine, for example, features a gorgeously oozy portion of burrata cheese plated on top of a crisp, thick piece of toast. It's accented by a complementary jam and olive oil, and makes for a satisfying first bite. For those that veer towards a sweeter start to the day, the impressively sized Blueberry Corn Waffle will be a crowd-pleaser, especially when topped with the rich honey butter and a spoonful of their housemade clabber cream.The Pulled Chicken Sandwich skews more towards the ""lunch"" instead of ""brunch"" side of the menu, and features lean chicken braised in a lightly spiced tomato and garlic sauce and garnished with sliced apples, pickles, cucumbers, and cilantro. It's sandwiched between two generous halves of sourdough which provide necessary support and crispness and makes for a flavorful and surprisingly light dish, perfect for a mid-day meal.For everything that The Wild Son offers - a casual environment, solid and well-priced plates, and friendly service - it's certainly worth a visit, especially on a warm summer afternoon when a trip along the High Line afterwards is ideal.",The Wild Son,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

Very filling, healthy and tasty. Easily an amazing sandwich experience that would bring us back. Sitting at the bar we also had a couple of low alcohol cocktails - they do fresh juices to make semi-healthy drinks. Unique and fresh, we loved them.

Menu was creative and fresh. Place is very trendy and eclectic. He cocktails were very creative sound on some traditional mixes.  I had a pork sandwich which is demeaning to refer to it as just a ""pork sandwich"". It was juicy and lean and combined with some veg which I have since forgotten.

I stopped in on a super hot and humid afternoon for lunch. First thing I saw were the sodas, which I had to order on that hot deathly day. I asked for the new orange soda.

Came in for a quick bite and drink before a concert. Sat at the bar which has hidden usb outlets underneath for charging! Brilliant since I had just flown in and my phone battery was low. Bar staff was super friendly. Since I like tequila / mezcal, I got La Rojita cocktail which is mezcal, red bell pepper juice, apple malic, agave and smoked salt. It was so good! My favorite drink I had the week I was there. I am still thinking about it which prompted me to write this review. For food, I shared a salad, milk & honey dish and pulled bacon BLT with a friend. The milk & honey consisted of burrata cheese over grilled seven grain with local honey, smoked salt & xvirgin. It was perfect! The pulled bacon BLT was also amazing; I just wish there was more of it. It seemed a little small in portion size but I also shared it so maybe that's why.

136,p4HDDeXiOI_f0JOHAupCnA,Judy K.,4.0 star rating,"Cute brunch spot right that doesn't get enough attention!I don't really understand this place because they have breakfast foods and simple sandwiches and salads, but they also have a beer, wine and cocktail menu. I would say it's perfect for those people who are always caught drinking, even at 10am. It's a small and cozy spot. It reminds me of some old grandfather's hidden room with big windows overlooking the sun rising over the meadow who also happened to hire an interior designer. If that didn't make any sense, perhaps the word ""brooklyn"" and ""hipster"" might do a better job of describing the atmosphere. The donuts of the day are baked in-house and though I'm not a big fan of cake donuts or baked donuts, it's still good. I liked the strawberry donut with the white chocolate glaze and blueberry drizzle more than the vegan chocolate with salted coconut. I don't know if i would order it again because it's really dense and I'm more of an airy and fluffy donut girl, but it's worth a try!My new morning sandwich was more like a lunch sandwich rather than breakfast, but it was still good nonetheless. The cauliflower needed some salt or maybe the sauce needed more tang, because it tasted a bit bland but all the flavors were good! My friends who had the grandma anna and the first sandwich said it was great! It's so strange to see sandwiches come in bowls.

It's just one of those places you could spend the afternoon in. As for the food, I ordered the Good Morning Sunshine and a glass of juice (""To My Health""), my friend ordered the Pulled Chicken (we forgot to take the photos, I think were too hungry). I loved my food, the brioche was on point. My friend said his pulled chicken was just OK. But this is my review, so 5 starts from me :) After we ate our foods, we decided to order something sweet. I tried the buckwheat pancakes, my friend had the burrata tartine. They were both delicious. The pancakes had this amazing orange turmeric butter, it was just amazing. Just the right amount of sweet and tart. The burrata tartine was also great, I love the combination of any white soft cheese and jam, so I loved it. The only thing I can criticize would be the plating of the burrata tartine.

It came with a side of beet yogurt which I immediately doubted but fought myself to not lick the bowl clean in public towards the end. The lobster there was on POINT. Their mussels also gave me a new found appreciation for them and I could have simply had the broth they were served in and live on it for the rest of my life because, yum. We tried a bunch as I went on a double date and I think that's the way to do it, go with a few folks and share the hell out of the menu. I didn't want to leave and I will for sure be back.

This was our first stop of the day while visiting NYC and I was so happy I got to try the foods I see on IG. My hubby got the Good Morning Sunshine with their Tecate with the ""works""  and I got their Green Tartine plate with the Golden Shrub cocktail. We both tried each other's dishes and we were happy! The GMS sandwich's pulled braised bacon was so moist and flavorful that you can eat it without the rest of the items in the sandwich - it was THAT good! My Green Tartine plate did not disappoint either. I ordered it with the sunny egg on the side but I ended up adding the egg on the top and it was a great decision. The freshness of this plate was beyond - the herb yogurt, the market sprouts salad on the side and of course, the avocado! The tartine was a healthy option for me so I decided to pair it with their Golden Shrub cocktail. And of course, it was a refreshing brunch beverage. I usually don't like the aperol but when I saw the fresh mango juice with it, I had to try and yes, it was perfect! It's expected with the Wayland group's cocktails. The bartender asked if we wanted anything for dessert and I saw that they had the carrot cake ice cream so I decided to try it. They have homemade ice creams with different flavors each day. I had to choose between sweet corn, blueberry swirl and carrot cake ice creams that day - tough choice, I tell you. Needless to say, I finished my 2 scoops (1 scoop per order) of the carrot cake ice cream. It was creamy with little bites of carrot cake in every bite yet it's not too sweet which I love. I'm disappointed at myself for not trying the donuts but there's always a next time and I'll definitely will be back. I highly recommend this new addition from the Wayland group - definitely a refreshing addition to the Highline!Update: I went back for dinner and I loved it!

The interior decor & ambiance is great though, though air-con or fans are needed to beat the summer heat. My face was melting through most of my brunch. The food - bad. We ordered the smoked trout sandwich and pulled pork sandwich. The baguette was overcooked to the point that it was too crispy and not enjoyable to eat. The pulled pork had unbelievable chunks of fat in it and nothing inside to create flavor. It just tasted like  pork oil crispy sandwich. The smoked trout also lacked flavor. The aioli lacks any flavor and the garnishing really don't contribute much. Very disappointing!

They've been open about a year and hopefully will stay for awhile. Breakfast and lunch is where they started and just started dinner. I came in before visiting the High Line for the first time. I had a latte and the good morning sunshine sandwich. Solid on both fronts. Milk wasn't burnt. Solid foam to milk consistency. Good espresso. The sandwich was perfectly toasted and soaked up the poached egg that was fresh and runny the way I like. Thick cut pieces of bacon with avocado rounded out the flavors. Not too filling and savory without being too salty.

It was empty when we arrived at 7:30 which made us think twice about the place but decided to give it a try anyway. Well, it was downhill from there. We started with the Point Lookout Oysters, which has a super fishy smell to them. We ate 3 of them and passed on the other 3. Then we had the crab cake and the smoked trout, both of which smelled off. Each of us took a few bites of each plate and immediately felt sick. We told the server that there was a problem with the freshness of their food, paid the bill, and ran out of there. When we got back to out apartment, we both spent the night in the bathroom. I also files a complaint with the NYC health Dept who said that they would visit the restaurant to check on whether the food they were serving was fresh.AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!",The Wild Son,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

The interior and location couldn't be any better.Their coffee situation needs some heavy lifting. They have a carbonated coffee that is around $7 and is all but a few sips of coffee with no free refills, so it may take you $21 to get a caffeine buzz. They also don't serve regular coffee.. Let me repeat THIS IS A BRUNCH PLACE WITH NO COFFEE. They only has espresso... They do offer Americanos but it was barely larger than an espresso and had no refills. Not a cheap-ness issue, more of an I need caffeine issue.The pancakes were okay, we tried to be healthy and get the wheat pancakes but they did not seem much different than what you could accomplish at home. I'm sure the buttermilk pancakes are much better. The sandwiches were not something that I'd crave all week, but they were not bad by any means. They were solid, but I think where they lost most of us was in the bread and the sauce department. Overall I'd probably come back if I needed a restaurant in that area for brunch, but the location, service, pricepoint outside of the coffee, and interior itself is 5, the flare of the menu needs to catch up, which I'm sure it will.",The Wild Son,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

As I often do, even when home, I opened the Yelp app to see what was nearby. Ironically, at the moment I may have been directly above The Wild SOn. We exited the the High Line at its southern terminus and proceeded to loop back around. At first I thought I was going to have to buy a pig and make my own breakfast sausage, but then realized that the restaurant was across the street from the (literal) meat packing house.The vibe is ""Yeah, we put little effort into decor, but we really care about the food"". Personally I could use more smiles from staff, but I live in FLA and this is NYC, so WTF.

What can I say about the bacon. It was not bacon in the sense you think of it. More like a mix between the textures of pork belly and the flavor of bacon. Amazing. For desert I had an apple doughnut which looked kinda plain but was full of flavor. Though to be honest it was more cake then doughnut. The coffee was also really good. I really like the atmosphere. It seems they have a nice little cocktail list and beer on tap as well. I didn't try those, however. Finally the pricing, especially for the area, was really good.

The dressing on the bib lettuce salad, however, was too tart without more. Tartness I like, but that was really the dressing's only note. It was boring.

The salad was totally inadequate for a lunch entree salad - it was not huge (portion would have been a large side salad).

They don't have a full liquor license, and only a few wines on the list but the Cab I got was pretty good. The food was awesome. We got the walnut pate which is pretty yummy for being so healthy. I got the lamb appetizer (comes in five lettuce cups with a Cole slaw on top) which I highly recommend, the lamb was very flavorful and tender. My friend got the steak and said it was great.

229,ysfL-EWqoeM16xNS8J2nww,Abby L.,3.0 star rating,"I'm giving this three stars because the service was good and the food was okay, despite the crowd.  My friend had a great sandwich, with roasted cauliflower and no meat, and I had a ""Grain and Greens"" which sounded good but was unfortunately spoiled by a lack of balance.  The menu promised Faro, which I was looking forward to tasting as it is a trendy food and I was wondering what it tastes like. There was none that I could identify.  There was about 1/4 teaspoon of something which resembled sunflower seeds which may or may not have been faro.  So we have Vegan, Faro, Kale, Roasted Cauliflower.  All of the ""new"" trends.My dish was mainly kale with a bit of whitish dressing and a smattering of delicious ingredients which were driven to the bottom of the bowl by the overpowering quantity of kale.  I don't particularly enjoy kale but I assumed the other ingredients would compensate for its tough texture and bitterness.  They would have had they been in proportion to the kale.  It seems like The Wild Son has good intentions and decent servers, but the recipes need to be tweaked a bit.It is a perfectly acceptable lunch spot for visitors of the Whitney and reasonably priced.",The Wild Son,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Cocktail, Bars,, Breakfast, &, Brunch"

And I don't know what particular food it was, but I stepping in to the warm smell of incredible deliciousness- I knew we were in for a treat. The 3 staff members we interacted with were incredible, attentive, kind, and made you feel like you were one of their good friends who stopped in for dinner. Okay, the food:if you are looking for healthier good food, this is the place.1) get the rice, you say why? How can rice be so good? I don't know, but when they have the egg yolk on top and you break it and mix...it just is awesome. The table next to us got it because we did and they completely agreed. Don't miss the rice.2) the warm kale side- yum yum yum yum. But, it is spicy, so tell them if you need it kicked down a notch. It was too spicy for my friend and 2 folks next to us, but don't skip it, just tweak it if you need to.3) we did the chicken sandwich and the roast chicken, so cheating in that we only did chicken, but both were great.We were so smitten by the food and entire experience that we made reservations for bunch.
