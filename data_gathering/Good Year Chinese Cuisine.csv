Avoid.Good Year has a database that keeps customer information- addresses, previous orders, etc. With this database they can clearly see I am a regular customer. And on a friday night it's not unusual for me to order $60-$70 worth of food. For a chinese food spot that is a HUGE order. I do that once a week with these people.So it was a major shock and a bigger disappointment when I called them today to place an order for delivery. Their menu says ""$10 minimum for delivery"". I ordered $10. The lady on the phone told me I'd have to spend another $2 in order to have my food delivered. I told her the minimum was $10 and that I didn't want to order anything else. I told her I'd give the extra $2 to the driver. She replied that the tip did not go to the business.  I told her to cancel my order and she said ""OK and hung up the phone"". I have since filed a complaint with NJ Consumer Affairs Department against them for false advertising.Since she likes math so much lets do some... I spend $60 EVERY friday at Good Year. $60 x 52 weeks = $3,120. Even if you divide that in half it equals $1500. Today the lady lost my business FOREVER over $2. That is great business!

I had a Chinese friend describe it to me once, as ""How would you feel if all that people ever tried of American food was McDonalds or Denny's?""I've ordered from this place a few times and each time the food arrived promptly, with impressive quality. The menu is bigger than normal, and the healthy options have low sodium, and come with the option of brown rice instead of white. Last night, I tried the Long Life Vegetarian ($7.95). It was steamed green beans, broccoli, water chestnuts, carrots, rice noodles, and tofu, served with your choice of 5 different sauces. I went with the Hunan and it was delicious! It was a great way to eat healthy without feeling like I was compromising. I also had the steamed veggie dumplings, which were good. They did need some sauce, or seasoning, or something. Thankfully, a little Hunan spruced those right up.Other people ordered shrimp lo mein, sweet and sour soup, and the cashew chicken. All were pleased. Even our fortunes inside of the cookie were good, not that that would have changed the rating at that point. Solid, fresh food at reasonable prices, with prompt and accurate delivery.

I am so glad that I found Good Year and that they deliver! For the price, you really can't beat it in the Hoboken area. The food has been consistently good and delivery is reliable. I order from Good Year about once a week and have only had one issue - when they delivered the wrong chicken dish. When I called back, they immediately refunded me and apologized. Some of my faves: pork fried dumplings, sweet and sour chicken (though a bit bready), and sesame noodles. My boyfriend loves the pork fried rice and scallion pancakes.

I normally order dumplings, combo platter, and/or beef/chicken meal. What I used to like from here was the dim sum which I'm sure is fine. The service is nice and quick, always say 20-30mins and come within 10-15min - which might be one of the reasons its not the best anymore. My main issue with this place is the taste of what I've been ordering for years has declined. I've tried some other Chinese places like King Sezchuan and Lee's (northern Heights) and seem to find they serve better quality. It also depends on the night but I don't know its changed. There are other options in the area that I would advise you try. Who knows, Great Wall might be a better option afterall.",Good Year Chinese Cuisine,3.5 star rating,$,Chinese

Even staying on the ""safe"" side, the meal was gorgeous. Light, neat flavors, a conservative amount of oil and no MSG - at my request - made for a wonderful dining experience. I would have preferred the lighter noodles rather than the lo mein-style noodles with the sesame dressing, but that doesn't mean the noodles weren't tasty.

They got my order slightly wrong by sending me white rice instead of brown and didn't send any utensils or napkins, but that was forgivable. Since then I have ordered from them 3 more times. Two of the 3 times they sent me white rice again and I had to call and complain. The finally got it correct the last time, but I have yet to receive chopsticks even when I request them specifically.  Every time I ordered the delivery times got longer and longer. Just last night, I ordered one last time, even though my wife thought it would be a bad idea, since it was already almost 7:00. I should have listened to her. This time, I called them after an hour, and they told me that the delivery guy was stuck in traffic and was on the way. 15 minutes later I called again very upset and she told me that the delivery guy was 5 minutes away. I told her that if I didn't receive the food in 5 minutes that I wanted to cancel the order. She was then extremely rude and upset with me. She treated me as if I was in the wrong for being impatient. When the food didn't arrive, I called them back and cancelled the order. She just hung on me in mid sentence. 10 minutes later (1.5 hours after the order was made) the food arrived. Since my wife was already preparing something else, I turned down the delivery. The delivery guy calls me from his car and tries to explain that he was stuck in traffic. When I tried to explain why I didn't want the food anymore, he hung up on me in mid sentence as well.  Finally, I checked my bank account this morning, and they had charged me for the food! I called them this morning and they said they credited the amount back to me, but I still have not yet seen the credit. Funny that I see the debit but not the credit.
