0,aySv8YT9uV7onFt0r8tmPg,Frank A.,5.0 star rating,I just left this very cozy cafe with more food than I planned on having. I went for the cafe de leche and possibly 1 or 2 pastries but everything looked so good and being freshly made had me upon entry. The staff were friendly with welcoming smiles and helped me select several items that all tasted delicious. I plan to brush up on my Spanish food language so next time I will walk right in and have them think that I just arrived from Columbia.,Angel Azul Bakery Cafe,4.5 star rating,$,"Bakeries,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Cafes"
1,akVMudPg7ckK32RSulGiig,Kenna M.,4.0 star rating,"In search of Colombian raspado (IMO, very different from Mexican raspado), I arrived here. Raspados are shaved or crushed ice dessert drinks with fruit syrups or purees and also drizzled with condensed milk. Here, they had both passion fruit and black berry syrups. I opted for both and didn't regret it. And to think, they were only ~$3.50! I ordered two, one for me and one for the bf, which ended up to be too much for the both of us. One is enough to share if you're into that kind of thing. :P And yes, this place sold cholados, something akin to a raspado, ecxept I believe it is usually topped with fresh fruit. I also grabbed some pandebono. YES. By no means am I an expert on Colombian food, but I've had really good pandebono in the past. The ones here were soft and the cheese perfectly mixed and baked into the bread. I ended up ordering too much so I saved one for the next day and what a good decision that was. (sidenote: I live a driveable distance from JC heights, so saving this last morsel was indeed a good choice) I heated up my last pandebono for 20 seconds in the microwave and it was basically fresh again. I wish I lived closer so I can come here in the early hours of the morning to grab a cafe con leche. This place doesn't disappoint. Oh yes! One last thing. There was a little bit of a language barrier here (must be my North Jersey accent trying to pronounce 'raspado.' Guilty.) But that said, the ladies are nice and try really hard to accommodate you. When one couldn't understand me, she called on another and that was helpful. Don't let language keep you from good food!

My dad used to love coming by here for their coffee!My favorite is a bun called pan de bono (a cheese bread), which I reheat by throwing in my toaster oven for a minute or two. My dad used to love buying their bags of day old buns, usually in clear bags right by the register. They're reduced price and still delicious.They serve slices of cake and other desserts (flan, etc), fruit smoothies, and fresh juices. During the summer, they serve granizados (shaved fruit flavored ice drinks). The place is super casual and has a few tables to eat at. Although, I always take my bread to go. Most of the employees have limited English but Google is my sidekick and ordering is simply pointing and sticking up my fingers to let them know how many I want. The prices are very reasonable and if I eat anything I don't like, it's simply part of the experience. The employees are nice and willing to give recommendations to help prevent that.

They look at you a little strange when you don't speak Spanish3. The cafe con leche is extremely thick (yikes!) and the sweet bread is the most basic, best thing. I am not Ecuadorian/Colombian baked goods expert but I do appreciate their sweet bread the most. They sell a variety of things (sweet smoothies, sandwiches, South American goodies, etc.) but I tend to stick to less exciting things like basic sweet bread. I tried the coffee once and felt like I was eating coffee rather than drinking it-- it was way too thick although I'm not sure why (maybe they use cream instead of milk).
