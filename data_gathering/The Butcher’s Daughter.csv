We were really happy when we realized they serve dairy-free waffles (my girlfriend is allergic to dairy). If you have a dairy-allergy, you know how incredibly hard it is to find dairy-free waffles that aren't from the freezer aisle of the grocery store and that actually taste good. In all the years i have known my girlfriend, we have been unable to find good dairy-free waffles at a restaurant. While my girlfriend got the weekend waffles, I got the french toast that was also really good. Both come with a dairy free strawberry butter and fruit on top. While both are really good, they aren't super filling. This place has an extensive list of smoothies. While we didn't get one, many other people seemed to be enjoying theirs. The smoothies were all pretty much $10+ but were a good size. I am definitely going to try one the next time I visit.We visited late on a Sunday afternoon and didn't have to wait for a table. I would be prepared to wait for a while at prime brunch times as the restaurant is small and intimate. If you are looking for a great brunch place in West Village, I would highly recommend The Butchers Daughter.",The Butcher’s Daughter,3.5 star rating,$$,"Juice, Bars, &, Smoothies,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Salad"

It was certainly good, and I loved the strawberry butter that came on the side, but I also felt like I could have saved $13 and gotten French toast with fruit at my college's dining hall. What you're really paying for is a pretty food presentation and a chic atmosphere. As soon as I walked in, I LOVED the appearance of the place. It's a tad crowded, but after a while you don't notice. The tables have the cutest little water glasses with mint leaves in it, the whole restaurant, from food to ceiling, makes for an excellent instagram brunch post. Glad I came here. Wouldn't come here for particularly great tasting food just because it was so average, but I would definitely come here again if my friend's are looking for a ""pretty"" dining experience.",The Butcher’s Daughter,3.5 star rating,$$,"Juice, Bars, &, Smoothies,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Salad"

When we sat down to eat after waiting an hour (were told it would be 30 mins) there was an awful trash smell coming from the kitchen.

I could see it being more crowded on a weekend...My food was delicious and while it might be a bit pricey, it's a vegetarian/vegan place in NYC so it wasn't too surprising.

I only got two small sides but still. Im glad i didnt get more. I got a side of potatos and a side of asparagus. Nothing exciting, but how how could you mess up two simple things? The potato was undercooked and the asaparagus was well overcooked. I literally had the ""struggle plate"" . I wanted to hashtag it so badly, but my level of pettiness wasn't high at the moment. My cocktail had too much going on. too much. My bill also came out to over $30. i only had a 2 sides and a cocktail.

48,EZPMFPBJezphS7G7zGvAzA,Christina Z.,2.0 star rating,"Let's just start this review off with the fact that this place is a vegetarian/vegan spot. Carnivores beware!Decor & Service: would give this 5-stars on both. The decor is very inviting and provides a nice Sunday-brunch feeling. The service was great, very nice and helpful with explanations of the menu.Food (2.5): since I'm a huge carnivore, I tried to find whatever option could provide me with my protein fix for the day. Went for the Avocado Toast with a sunny side up egg. The egg (5) for sure was cooked to perfection, but the rest of the toast fell short. You'd hope the toast would be a major part of this dish but it was very dry and hard to chew at the edges, rather than a nice crispy balance for what you'd expect from a toast. They ARE generous with the avocado, at least.Smoothie (1): if you're looking for something with a funky texture as well as super healthy and light flavor, you've found the place. However, given how important taste and texture is to a foodie, the congealed and gelatinous texture of my ""mango lassi"" was quite offputting, on top of the fact that there was almost none of the expected tanginess you'd expect from a mango, let alone a mango lassi. After drowning the smoothie in a ton of agave nectar, it got slightly better.Go for the vibes, not so much the foods. Maybe the coffees and juices are better? But I for one will be staying far away.

Sometimes I forget this is a restaurant.The decor is an invitation to a zen retreat. The kind that comes with a bar that serves private wine labels: Sexy Rose, Sassy White Sauvignon Blanc and Slutty Red Pinot Noir! Ha! My favorite thing to order here is the pancake with whipped vanilla cream, almond butter and mixed berries fruits sauce. The portion is on the smaller side. They could add a little more to that stack. But I guess I'd prefer servings that I can finish as opposed to huge stacks that end up unfinished.I hope I'm not doing this place a disservice by demoting to 4 stars because this is one of my favorite places in the West Village. The servers are pleasant but some staff could learn a thing or two about customer service. For example, if you're the host/manager, a smile in acknowledgement would do nicely if you don't feel like greeting customers good morning the moment they walk in.

I don't understand why they couldn't just seat me first. It's not like there was any lines behind me, and more than 2 seats were available. I could've ordered an appetizer and waited for my friend. If they saw me waiting in front of the entrance, couldn't they at least offer me to sit down so that I can wait for my friend to arrive? My friend was almost here and I told her to meet me at the other vegan restaurant down the road and walked out from the restaurant.

I've been to numerous vegan restaurants throughout the city, but this didn't live up to the hype my friends had said. First of all, we had been waiting for a long time for a table. We were stuck in traffic but in the end it didn't even matter because we still ended up waiting over an hour. Although the decor is cute, the place feels super tiny and felt like there wasn't much room to get around. Still, I decided to save my judgement for the food. I ordered the smashed avocado toast with poached eggs (comes with potatoes on the side) and some of their regular coffee, honestly was not a huge fan. For the price you pay, I felt by Chloe's toast was better (minus the poached eggs part). Now it was good- just not great. Perhaps I should've gone with something else? Also, my server indicated that cream wasn't served-only milk and when I did order the almond milk on the side it wasn't enough for my dark coffee. So while the servers were definitely friendly, they were inattentive and screwed up our order twice. Overall, wasn't a fan of the overpriced entrees and surprisingly still had room for more food.

We got the avocado toast, gluten free, no eggs and no sauce (both not vegan). This comes with a side of potato hash. And we also got the spicy kale Caesar salad and added tempeh to it. So. The gluten free avocado toast was the absolute worst idea ever. Not only was this $19.00, but it literally looked like two circular crackers with a little bit of guacamole on it. It didn't taste bad... but definitely wasn't anything to talk about besides being soooo sad hahaThe potato hash was SOOO GOOD. Make sure to get a side of the vegan chipotle aioli, it was so yummy with it. And now... the salad. Pure. Heaven!!!!We honestly almost ordered another one hahaAnd that's not a joke.

Overall assessment: definitely worth going at least once, very cute spot, good but overpriced vegetarian food, not for large parties.AMBIANCE:First off, the decor is devine - lots of tasteful fake plants that look real and white painted brick. Leather couch seats along the wall and a picnic table in the middle for bigger parties. Even the bathroom is stunning and clean. It's a great spot to go with a friend or two, but the place is pretty small overall, so a big party might be a little tricky. Even though it was busy it didn't get too loud.FOOD:They give you a large water bottle for the table and it has some kind of herb or mint in it, it looks very pretty but I didn't get much of that taste in the water.I got the ""Orange"" juice - orange, tangerine and carrot. It was REALLY good, but at $10 I definitely think over priced.My friend and I both got the Cauliflower Grits ($15) with mushroom, adzuki bacon and poached eggs. Full disclosure, there are 3 mushrooms and 2 small pieces of the bacon, which was a little disappointing, but overall the food tasted great.I also got a fruit salad side ($6) which was HUGE - definitely enough to split for 2 people - and it was no joke, none of that filler fruit...it was raspberries, black berries, blueberries, kiwi, apple. Delicious.SERVICE:I was nervous given the reviews from other patrons about the wait staff, however our waiter was very sweet and attentive.

The food might be a bit tasteless (ricotta is very nutral and would require some extra spices). Service was alright.

But I ordered it and they made it correctly so that was my bad.   My partner had ordered a berry smoothie that did not taste like berries and contained a banana.  There was no banana in the ingredient list so we called the server over (it was hard to do because he was ignoring us) and asked about it.  He said, ""yeah, the menu is wrong.  we started putting banana in it"".   Uh, you can't just change the way you make them and not update the menu.  What if there was an allergy?  Also, bananas are filler .... we were paying for berries and we wanted berries.  I made him take that smoothie off of the bill since it was not what we had ordered and we weren't going to drink it.Iffy food aside, the service here sucks.  There is a premium on looking cute or cool or whatever and less of an attempt at providing good service.Leave this place to those only concerned about Instagram likes and go literally anywhere else.",The Butcher’s Daughter,3.5 star rating,$$,"Juice, Bars, &, Smoothies,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Salad"

We had the full English breakfast and the poached eggs/avocado toast.  The former was a disappointment.  Tomatoes from a can?!?  (A full English in the UK has an actual grilled tomato.  Go there sometime and see for yourselves!)  As for the adzuki-bean ""bacon"", the nicest thing that we vegetarians could come up with is that it was microwaved.  The portion of beans, though delicious, was tiny: we counted six beans.  (Note to mgmt: a can of organic cannellini beans costs 99¢ at Whole Foods.  At six beans to a plate, that'll stretch to about 30 full Englishes.)  Nevertheless, props are due to the server who brought a spoonful more in a bowl without extra charge or complaint.  The avocado toast was much better than the full English.  Portion sizes suggest that not a lot of food gets wasted.The overriding impression is that everything was very fast -- one more piece of evidence that brunch is easily the most overrated thing about living in New York.

After being seated & now greeted by second staff member, our waiter Felipe, our good lunch experience continued. We got again a second professional welcome, smiles, and asked if we had any questions about the food choices. Felipe answered our questions with obvious strong knowledge about the menu and shortly thereafter our delicious food was delivered. I'd highly recommend to Healthy Eaters & Juice lovers. The food & juices were tasty and fresh. The staff were all professional but I'd have to say that our waiter Felipe made this trip an extra special experience with his professional demeanor and charm.

Then when she came back she informed us that she couldn't guarantee the appetizers would be out before the entrees as ""the kitchen just makes everything at once"". What? I responded that I'd been there before and that hadn't been the case, and she just told me maybe my last waiter had been misinformed and there was ""nothing she could do"". (The food did end up coming out in the right order, so not sure what the problem was.) She then completely ignored us the rest of the night.

I saw a lot of women dragging guys into this place while we were there. From what I could tell there was nothing exceptional about this place except for maybe the prices which were quite high. I had a kale salad and a glass of Malbec and she had a gin drink and a cheese board. They served my wine in a plastic tumbler that was close to being a sippy cup.  She spent the rest of the dinner trying to figure out if there was any gin in her drink. My salad was good but she probably wouldn't have gotten the cheese board again as it was vegan (and apparently not well labeled on the menu).  All in all it was probably not worth the $70,The Butcher’s Daughter,3.5 star rating,$$,"Juice, Bars, &, Smoothies,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Salad"

Unfortunately after my first visit I left hopeful they can get their act together.  I ordered the smashed avocado eggs benedict. The egg whites were runny/clear and the ""smashed avocado"" looked and tasted like it had just been squeezed out of a trader joes pre-made guac tube. Definitely not worth the $15 price tag. Friendly staff and beautiful ambiance, but above all the food should be good!

I had the hangover shot and ate the avocado toasts! The shot was very good and refreshing! The toasts were very very good and healthy! The bread was also very good (like a multi grain bread). The only thing is that they don't have that much variety of food choices (only about 8 breakfast choices).",The Butcher’s Daughter,3.5 star rating,$$,"Juice, Bars, &, Smoothies,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Salad"
128,w2sDZ7E-p9YI-Vmri23l_Q,Sarah K.,4.0 star rating,"I came here for brunch. The hostess was very friendly and able to seat my friend and me right away. The decor is absolutely beautiful and crafted with a nod toward a generation of Instagrammers. We both had the same dish, cauliflower grits. The portion was quite small, but it was flavorful and the vegan bacon (something I usually cannot stand) was flavorful without being overpowering. We also had one of the smoothies, and it was the perfect amount of sweetness. It's likely you will be seated community-style and share a table with others. It doesn't bother me, but some people don't like it. The waiter was a bit dispassionate. A unique spot with some interesting dishes.",The Butcher’s Daughter,3.5 star rating,$$,"Juice, Bars, &, Smoothies,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Salad"

Four of us shared four dishes on the dinner menu and we loved them all....from the nachos, to the gluten free pasta with ""sausage"", to the spaghetti squash and zucchini ""pasta"" dishes...every single one was delicious and well thought out.

Sat down immediately at a communal table and food came out in a timely yet fast manner. We ordered the egg salad toast $12 which was really good (note: drizzle some of the house hot sauce hit the bottom !) we also got the bahn mi $13 but didn't enjoy it as much and wasn't a fan of the mushroom pate. It's honestly just a baguette pate, shredded carrots, cauliflower n cilantro. but I saw a lot of customers get the avocado toast which has heading amount of avocado love.!

Why would anyone assume that a place called the BUTCHER'S Daughter, is a vegetarian restaurant.  I could even live with that had they clarified on the menus that the bacon, pork, chicken, etc. was actually some sort of disgusting tofu blend.  Sure I guess the juice was ok, but considering how bad the food was, you'd be better off buying some boxes of juicy juice and eating a raw carrot.",The Butcher’s Daughter,3.5 star rating,$$,"Juice, Bars, &, Smoothies,, Breakfast, &, Brunch,, Salad"
