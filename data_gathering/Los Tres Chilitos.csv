We ordered for delivery and the woman on the phone was friendly and attentive.And, the delivery came pretty quickly. Maybe 25 mins or so?  We are a little further out and the food was made to order so that was just fine for us.Now for the not-so-good. I ordered the chicken tacos and while they looked delicious, they tasted bland. No real flavor. The order came with 4 tacos and a bit of guacamole with one tortilla chip. My favorite part of the whole dish was the guacamole just because I knew it was homemade with larger pieces of avocado but still, it needed salt.My husband got the steak burrito and it just tasted like a lot of soy sauce was used to marinate the meat. I had trouble tasting any other ingredient.We also ordered the cactus salad and there was just a bunch of cheese and again, no flavor on the cactus.

51,URDkmpcTTcWmXg65owRBUQ,Kristine D.,4.0 star rating,"This restaurant offers solid authentic Mexican food in a really nice atmosphere. To be perfectly honest, I find most Mexican food too salty, too cheesy, too oily or over sauced. This was not the case here!During my most recent visit, I ordered the potato and chorizo flautas ($9) which was really, really good! The flautas were crisp and topped with plenty of fresh lettuce, pico de gallo, and grated Mexican cheese. I asked for black beans instead of refried beans. The black beans were not too salty, and appeared to be partially puréed. My husband ordered chicken enchiladas ($10) with green chile sauce and extra rice which he devoured! I also ordered their mango batido made with water (instead of milk). It was served in a wine glass with a straw. It tasted fresh but was not as sweet as I would have liked. They also gave us free chips with salsa, My husband has ordered their takeout tacos and flautas in the past. He's always been seriously happy with their food, which is very reasonably priced, especially for the quality.The restaurant has a nice, casual family-friendly atmosphere. The staff is warm and courteous and happy to answer any questions. The tv in the restaurant is usually switched onto a Spanish channel, which I didn't find distracting during my meal. (Although, the family with 3 screaming kids who couldn't stop running around did! But I don't blame the restaurant for that.) If you don't typically like most Mexican fare, try this place out.

This is casual, authentic joint serving up some delicious and cheap Mexican food. If you know Spanish, the better.Order the guacamole, so fresh and for the price, not a bad portion. I prefer mine with a bit of kick, but this was oh so creamy and good.The complimentary chips and salsa area always welcome, although I wish the bowl of salsa was a bit bigger. The guy ordered up a platter chock full of spicy pork, chorizo, steamed cactus, scallions and of course rice, beans, tortillas. This was all for about $10-$12. He loved every bite. I snagged a bite of the spicy pork and cactus and 'twas delicious; definitely a great option for all you paleo peoples out there.I went with the green chicken enchiladas that came with rice and beans. The green sauce had a nice kick to it and I'm glad I went with it over the red or mole options. The interesting aspect of the enchilada's were that the inner corn tortilla was steamed, but looks like the outer tortilla was baked making it crispy. I actually prefer soft tortillas throughout, but this was an interesting take and definitely added a bit of crunch, but also making it a bit difficult to eat with a knife and fork.When asking for water they bring over the bottle (it's only about $1), but just a heads up.Overall, dinner with a nice 20% tip was about $40 for more than enough food for two people.

I'm glad that Tres Chilitos offers solid authentic Mexican food without the pretentious nature that Taqueria provides.Tres Chilitos has a pretty solid all around menu. The tacos are delicious as is the pozole. My only gripe with this place is the salsa picante they provide with the chips is resembles a watery ketchup. I much prefer the offerings at other restaurants, where it more closely resembles pico de gallo but with an added spicy kick.Tres Chilitos is my new go to spot for Mexican in the area, and I'm glad to have some good food without having to trek to Union City or Bayonne.

The waitress brought a menu with a friendly greeting. I always try a combination chicken enchilada and beef taco from a new place, that's my gringo standard. I was told they don't serve combinations (which I found rather unusual) but Okay ... no problem. So I ordered the chicken enchiladas (3) with refried beans and rice and a Mexican coffee. The chips and salsa were fine. However, the enchiladas' were crunchy and swimming in the mole' sauce. The flavor was Okay but after eating one I decided to unroll the third. Well, I don't know if you folks remember Ronald Reagan saying ""Where's the Beef"" but I was asking myself ""Where's the Chicken"".  I think a 3 enchilada dish should have at least the equivalent of 1 chicken cutlet but it didn't come close literally small crumbles  of chicken in each.

83,xdl-cvOWgWSGPfFNz6Q7DA,Victoria P.,2.0 star rating,"So this review is going to include Taqueria Downtown, Taqueria Mi Mariachi, and Los Tres Chilitos. Before I break everything down I will rank them in order of preference (I still have a few more taquerias to try in the downtown area).1.) Taqueria Downtown - still holds supreme with their Pork Taco. They must put cocaine in it.2.) Taqueria Mi Mariachi - Their Carne Asada Taco can give Taqueria Downtown's Pork Taco a run for their money. However, it is two different type of meat. Their Carne Asada taco surpasses Taqueria Downtown's Steak Taco. Yes, it is true.3.) Los Tres Chilitos was the weakest link of the three. #3 I'll explain why Los Tres Chilitos was the weakest link. Flavor. There was such a lack of flavor in the food. One way I rate a Mexican restaurant is not by their tacos, but by their rice and beans. If you mess up the rice and beans then I can't even have high hopes for the rest of the meal. Well, the rice and beans were definitely lacking. I ordered Chorizo, Bistec, and Carnitas tacos. Nothing stood out. Everything was of course edible and good, but just good. I ordered an horchata and I have no idea what they gave me, but it was not horchata. I mean, it was technically horchata, but the flavor was completely off! Price was pretty good for the bountifulness of the meal, but Mexican food should be inexpensive - Rice, beans, meat, and tortilla - very basic cuisine. The service was great, very friendly staff. The best part of Los Tres Chilitos was the ambience. I liked the decor and open space. Parking was a bit of a pain, but seating was spaced out and comfortable. I wasn't a fan of the menu. Too much going on. Just keep it simple. #2I went into Taqueria Mi Mariachi with an appetite. I ordered tamales, a torta, tacos, and of course horchata. Let's start with the horchata. It was okay. It was missing something, but still just okay. Tacos - That Carne Asada was absolutely delicious! I could easily eat three - no problem. The torta packed a lot of flavor depending on the type of meat you select, and the tamale unfortunately was extremely dry. The tortilla de maiz they use for the tacos was really really delicious. The restaurant itself is TINY. I suggest taking it to go as opposed to dining in. They take a little while to prepare the food since the kitchen is right behind the counter, so maybe calling in the order ahead of time would be best. You can see the workers make everything in front of you. Very nice family who runs this restaurant. Abuelita was in there heating up some tortillas. Made me feel like I was at a relatives house waiting for dinner. Prices were extremely fair. They offered more of a selection of meats than Taqueria Downtown does. Oh, the rice and beans? Great. Rice could have been a bit better, but the beans had the right amount of flavor. Good job!#1 Taqueria Downtown still reigns supreme in my book as far as Authentic Mexican. What makes this place Authentic? When I sip their horchata I'm back in my Grandmother's kitchen. When I bite into their tacos and tamales I see my Tios and Tias sitting at the table laughing and passing food around. Taqueria Downtown's horchata comes very close to mi Abuelita's and the rest of their food takes me back to some good old family cooking. So let's start with the rice and beans. Their rice and beans are good on their own. I used to have a problem with the consistency of the beans, but I solved that by just mixing the beans with the rice. Jam packed with flavor. I could eat their rice and beans straight out of a cup. The ambiance and decor of the restaurant is very retro which is cool. Love the classic rock that is played along with some mariachi tracks - makes this place stand out. This place gets PACKED. Super packed. They have a lot more help now than they did back before Hurricane Sandy which only adds to the congestion of the place. I still prefer to take it to go. Now for their Tacos. Their Pork Taco must have some type of drug inside because that thing is addicting. I can eat 5 easily. My favorite Torta is their bistec and their tamales have been hit or miss, but most of the the time they are hits. Oh! Don't forget their flan. Oh lord heaven do not forget the flan. Regardless of the rules, attitude, price, pretension - whatever - the food is muy sabroso plain and simple. Get a pork, steak, or fish taco with a side of rice and beans, flan for dessert, and you're good to go. OH! Tortilla Soup Thursdays and Chili Rellenos Fridays - DO NOT MISS OUT! That tortilla soup is a killer - soooo delicious. Annnnd BRUNCH! Their Brunch is absolutely excellent. Their brunch comes pretty close to what mom makes at home. Huevos Con Chorizo - oh good lord that's my absolute fave breakfast of all time and Taqueria does it justice (we use different chorizo). Taqueria Downtown has so much to offer. If you've had a bad experience dining in next time take it to go, but don't let your bad experience deter you from some pretty delicious food =)",Los Tres Chilitos,4.0 star rating,$,Mexican

If you ask for NO onion they'll add extra Onion. . Go figure. 3rd) chicken soup.. gosh .. disgusting! It's a soupy water with a drumstick..

It's the food that I grew up with in Southern California. The restaurant is located in Jersey Heights, a Hispanic neighborhood. The restaurant is simple and roomy. We go to this restaurant about once a week. We're now such regulars that if our usual waitress is there, she doesn't bother coming over to us to take our order. Instead she hollers, ""The usual?"" We nod and our order is placed.If we go for dinner, we get steak enchiladas. These are the best enchiladas that I've had since leaving CA. If we go for brunch, we get huevos rancheros. The fresh salsas (not the one they give you with the chips, but the REAL salsas) are very tasty. We liberally drown our food with the red and green salsa. We love the  huevos ranchers because of the great homemade thick corn tortilla that they make. It make the dish!The only thing I don't like about Los Tres Chilitos is the annoying squeak that comes out of nowhere from time to time.

My boyfriend ended up getting the steak enchiladas with verde sauce and I opted for  carnitas, steak and cecina tacos.The menu is extensive and they offer specials everyday.

Los Tres Chilitos (LTC, hence forth) was still good, just not TMM level. I ordered the Huarache (flat thick tortilla with the works) and the gorditas - though I am sometimes a fatty-mcfat pants this was still a lot of food and I had plenty of left overs (I wanted to try as much as possible in one trip), GF ordered the fajitas. I thought the huarache was just ok (not as good as TMM) but enjoyed the gorditas. I liked that you get multiple smaller gorditas vs TMM's one large gordita. I did not like the fajitas - thought the beef was tough and the flavor was just OK but I also would never order that so take it with a grain of salt.LTC atmosphere is fantastic. Its definitely not a small bodega that also doubles as a grocery store which was a very nice change. The place is relatively HUGE with a lot of open space, privacy and TV if you so need.I also liked the free chips and salsa as well as the guac. Everything tasted extremely fresh.Service was great, staff was so nice and accommodating. I'll definitely be going back to see if we should add or remove some stars, enjoyed the experience.",Los Tres Chilitos,4.0 star rating,$,Mexican

The guacamole is good, especially when compared to other Jersey City restaurants. The chilaquiles and tostadas are some of our favorites. The only reason I am not giving them a five star rating is because their delivery took over an hour when we ordered from there even though they told us it would only be 30 minutes and the food was a little cold.

120,VRZG3voUAGd0N_yZjmi6yA,Seema U.,4.0 star rating,"I was really craving mole enchiladas. A quick Yelp search alerted me to Los Tres Chilitos and since I had been hoping to try the place for a while, I quickly placed an order for shrimp enchiladas with mole sauce as well as some guacamole. I probably ordered my food after 9pm and I think they are open till maybe 10 on weekdays. The mole sauce wasn't the best I have had, but it was pretty good. They put a generous amount of shrimp in the enchiladas which I appreciated and the enchiladas also came with a side of rice and beans that was fairly large. Mole can be made in so many different ways, so while this wasn't my favorite mole sauce, maybe others will disagree. I thought it was odd that the guacamole did not come with chips- I assume this is a take out thing but still kind of annoying (they may have also just forgotten to include them; who knows). Guac was also solid and I would probably order it again but just make sure there were chips to eat it with. Overall, this place offers fairly authentic Mexican food and a huge menu. I definitely would eat in the restaurant in the future or get more take out to try more of their menu.",Los Tres Chilitos,4.0 star rating,$,Mexican

Total crowd pleaser.We each got something different for our entrees. i tried my friends mole sauce: it was so flavorful and had a nice little kick to it at the end.

Dammit.Taqueria finally re-opened after being devastated by Hurricane Sandy, but everyone and their momma clearly knew about it so we decided to postpone it for a non-busy night. My friend who lives in The Heights, and is a foodie, suggested we go here instead, and since I was starving, we did. The menu is pretty extensive. Aside from the usual Mexican fare, they have sopes (which I've never heard of before I came here), flautas, tamales (I'm coming back for this!) and some other dishes I can't remember. Assuming the portions weren't going to satisfy my hunger, I ordered two dishes. Boy, did I feel like a heffer when we got our food---the sopes were like 3 bagel bites, but a lot bigger and meatier. And the 3 crispy flautas were like large cannolis. All delicious! I especially love the shredded cheese that were sprinkled on top.Bonus: No 25-30 minute wait for a table. We didn't have to scream at each other to converse. And the service is great. Oh, and it doesn't cost too much.So there. If you don't believe me, I'm fine with that.
