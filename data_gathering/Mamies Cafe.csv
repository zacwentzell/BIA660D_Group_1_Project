0,ij1t38V1jcXRbLF0XQpsHA,Dewan A.,5.0 star rating,"OMG! Best Ecuadorian restaurant in the area. 1) I got the seco de chivo. What a fantastic dish. Kinda like Indian goat curry. 2) Also got passion fruit drink. Very good. 3) The entire meal was so affordable. 4) Oh, the hot sauce, which is home made, is a must get. Ask them for it.",Mamies Cafe,4.0 star rating,,"Latin, American"
1,gBww_DBYxFpUb-M6DgS92Q,Joseph P.,4.0 star rating,"This is my second review of Mamies Cafe and the second time I have had breakfast here. This time we sat indoors. I had eggs, bacon, avocados and multigrain toast. My friends had fresh fruit, corned beef hash (outrageously good!) All delicious.   It's a very nice atmosphere with excellent service. Upscale country, and arguably the best breakfast in Litchfield County, CT",Mamies Cafe,4.0 star rating,,"Latin, American"
2,2F62VWkEiRuuAKGUSiYYSQ,Dagmi R.,1.0 star rating,"Food is great but the service is terrible. I waited 20 minutes in a table and no one came to attend me so I went to the counter, placed my order (which you're only supposed to do when you order to go) and the these girls that just walked in and get their order taken and their food in less than 20 minutes. They Could have good food but I'll find another place w good service and food.",Mamies Cafe,4.0 star rating,,"Latin, American"
3,z_YRTMl4vnhvXJ4TbUfq6g,Stan S.,1.0 star rating,"No idea how the food is,  but they will not serve you we'll if you are not a Spanish speaker. Called to ask if they're doing delivery to my area at the moment.   The girl who answered did not speak a lick of English , rudely demanded that I order in Spanish,  and hung uo the phone after I answered in English.   Appauling behaviour for a local business in an upcoming area.",Mamies Cafe,4.0 star rating,,"Latin, American"
4,ww2J1TJl6NyQ1jxKZsA9Bw,Jennifer A.,5.0 star rating,"Encebollado de Pescado! This place has the best encebollado in town. If you don't know what a encebollado is let me break it down for you: Tuna, Cassava in a warm silky soup topped with fresh onions that have been marinated in a lemon cilantro dressing. It goes well with plantain chips! In Ecuador we call it the hangover soup because it truly is the best after a night of partying! You need to try it :) they also have great corviche (green banana stuffed with tuna and fried to perfection) you will thank me later !",Mamies Cafe,4.0 star rating,,"Latin, American"

Overall food is what makes this restaurant shine. Try the caldo de bola, or the colada. Delicious!the bolons could use a bit more meat in them {chicharron}. Will def come back for food",Mamies Cafe,4.0 star rating,,"Latin, American"

It's is an Ecuadorian soup beef,  vegetables and a plantain ball kinda like a veggie ball. Almost $10 and there was No ball!  Extreme disappointment! But I call them about the soup and their going to rectify this mishap.",Mamies Cafe,4.0 star rating,,"Latin, American"
8,CLby1rP4dKTsPX0h32FMCA,Mia M.,5.0 star rating,Soup & Entree & Juice Lunch Special $7. I love the lentil and seafood soups.  If I go and they only have chicken or meat I just dump the hot sauce stuff they have on the table and everything tastes delicious.,Mamies Cafe,4.0 star rating,,"Latin, American"
