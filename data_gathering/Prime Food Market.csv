It would be cooked in the morning and be served till late in the night. Fortunately, the guys who owned this place had a change of mind-set [for the better] and bought in a new cook who now prepares everything after it's ordered. Amongst the things that I've loved the most [to the freakish extent that I've ended up ordering multiple times a week] are the Bombay Sandwich, Paneer Mutter, Paneer Tikka Masala, Vada Paav. [Frankly, the list is much bigger than that]The grocery prices are slightly more than what you'd get at your normal retail store such as ""Shoprite"" / ""Target"" but given the location of this place, you wouldn't mind shelling a few extra bucks vs having to walk a mile or so.",Prime Food Market,4.0 star rating,$$,"Grocery,, Convenience, Stores,, Indian"

The place looked a little dingy as we entered and I had very low expectations. We got paneer masala, dal fry and rotis. The food was the bomb!!

Also their customer service leaves a lot to be desired, I've just been in and the guy behind the counter left me standing there for a while whilst he finished whatever he was doing on his phone, never looked up at me, never spoke....not even when I gave him the money.

I live next door and love its location because I can satisfy my craving for chaat paapdi, samosa, paneera tikka and what not at a stone throw away distance. The food has improved over time and I like all the items in the menu. The chicken tikka is great as well, my new favorite is gobhi naan.

15,9eyN1N6cXO7FKaZAzQCDKA,Craige M.,4.0 star rating,"This unassuming little store has been around for a while but it's off the beaten path so I forget about it. It's open late and is good for your basic convenience store items such as ice cream, snacks, and so forth. But what really sets them apart is the impressive array of frozen Indian entrees. Some are as cheap as $3 and the two I tried tasted better than plenty of freshly made Indian food. Paired with a package of frozen naan, that's a great cheap meal right there. Then, if you're feeling adventurous, come back for the variety of dried beans and spices and cook up your own Indian dishes. And pick up some ice cream flavors you definitely won't find at A&P. There is a food counter as well, but I never see anything being cooked when I go in so I'm not sure what the deal is with that. $10 minimum on credit. There's also a cash machine.",Prime Food Market,4.0 star rating,$$,"Grocery,, Convenience, Stores,, Indian"
