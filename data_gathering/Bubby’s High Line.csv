I got the fried chicken with your pick-3 meal sides (I got seasoned greens, which was just basically garlicky salty kale, bacon Mac and cheese, which was pretty good and coleslaw, which was just meh) and ice tea. I told them I wanted my ice tea sweetened, and when my order came they complete forgot. I asked again for my sweetened ice tea and what they brought me was this liquid sweetener. It did a difference but still, I was a bit annoyed about it. I went on to my food, which was overall-  good bordering on lackluster. The fried chicken was good but the sides didn't have me completely loving my whole meal.Edit: Forgot to add! The biscuits is what made me give it four stars! Absolutely delicious with the butter and jam. Please try it. I might come here next time just for that, and maybe to try their pancakes.

I ordered the banana pancakes which come with caramelized bananas and walnuts on top. First, let me just explain that they are plain pancakes with topping, no bananas in the batter. So if you're going to have a topping, it should be generous, and if it is not generous then you should at least layer the topping in between the pancakes. There were about four slices of bananas on top and lots of walnuts. How interesting, the cheaper ingredient was scarce and the more expensive ingredient was plentiful.

Ordered the soup salad combo and my dining partner ordered soup sandwich There were no specifications as to which salad or sandwich applied to this combo deal and my partner requested crab sandwich. Server told him she didn't think it was included in the deal but was going to inquire. Meanwhile, we waited nearly 45 mins and when I saw that the table next to us received their meal despite being seated way after placing our order I knew what had happened! Our server probably forgot to inquire about the crab sandwich and never put the order in!!!When she finally arrived she informed us it would not be part of the combo deal and she would head to the kitchen to find our where our meals were... She disappeared. Finally found a manager and was told they ran out of the market soup and had to make a new batch... Come on... Just be honest!As for the bubby's matzah ball soup... It def makes my hall of fame... Coming from a long line of matzah ball soup makers (yes, from scratch!) this is the most authentic I have ever tasted outside of my kitchen! Hence the 3 stars ... 2 taken off for my poor service and my citrus arugula and fennel salad didn't have a speck of fennel in it! Oh that lemon meringue pie was perfection, so light and not sweet, wish my grandmother was here to have tasted!Management did the right think and gave me a step discount and comped dessert!

Yet I wouldn't crave it again because the star of the dish was definitely the buttery biscuits! Unfortunately, we had a little mishap with one of the pieces being bloody but the server brought out another piece. Second, the huevos rancheros was very blah, nothing too special about it.

On the plus side, this place has nice decor, looks inviting, and I'm betting the food is good, especially judging by other reviews. As for the bar and the service provided there, it was poor by any standard. The bartender didn't seem to notice or really care that people on our end of the bar needed service. She seemed to be too busy chatting with her friends at the other end of the bar.  Examples: (1) one patron took 10 mins to get his check; (2) we couldn't get eye contact, let alone menus for over 5 minutes, even though it was not that busy; (3) we couldn't even pay easily when we realized this was a bust. It felt like we were being deliberately ignored. As for the drinks, she didn't even ask how we wanted them, and they showed up disappointingly small.

Unfortunately, it was fried, so while it tasted good, you didn't feel nearly as healthy as you should eating a veggie burger.    The entire meal for the table was very pricey, so that is a bit of a downside.

66,npSffQWdq1LypPBBBkInVQ,Danielle C.,1.0 star rating,"Wow, I've dined at Bubby's for brunch for years and have always left feeling very content and happy but boy, Thanksgiving Dinner was an entirely different experience.  What a HUGE disappointment!  I should have known after I'd informed a friend that I'd be dining at Bubbys for Thanksgiving and he quickly told me that he'd done the same the year prior but that there simply wasn't enough food.  Why didn't I listen?! I decided to make a reservation at  Bubby's after seeing the variety of Thanksgiving Day food items being served. The price was a bit steep at $75pp BUT they had something for everyone on the menu and it's Thanksgiving, so I get it.Once we arrived, we waited approximately 15 minutes to be seated.  Once seated, the appetizers were quickly served.  So far so good and there was just enough food for both my mother and I.  Shortly afterwards, the main dinner arrived.  This was where the problem began.   The turkey, ham and stuffing was all served on ONE individual sized plate (NOT a platter) and this was supposed to be shared.  I asked the waitress if she could send over at least one slice of ham, rather than the few pieces of diced up ham that was on the plate. Fortunately the waitress agreed that there was very little ham and quickly came out with 3 slices.  I was appreciative however the problem didn't end here. The portion sizing was just completely off with the entire main meal.   There was only enough stuffing for one person.  The green beans and potatoes were each served in individual, ""side style"" small bowls, again NOT meant for sharing but we were expected to share.  There was also mashed potatoes + sweet potatoes that were placed on the same dish but fortunately the dish was a reasonable size and there was enough for both of us.  Cranberry sauce was also served but again, in a tiny side dish bowl and was 1/4 full. Basically my mother and I were only able to share the potatoes.  Everything else, there simply wasn't enough to share and if there was, there was a few bites for each of us.  Again, I was able to get a serving of ham but when I'd asked for an additional ""scoop"" of stuffing, the answer was no.  Dessert was plentiful.  Several slices of pie for each of us...too much but I wasn't complaining considering we'd been ripped off from our main entree.Let me just say that my mother and I are not enormous cows.  I am 5'7 and weigh 145 lbs.  My mother is 5""6 and weighs 165.  When I think of Thanksgiving dinner, I think of leaving FULL or at least content and happy.  Well not at Bubby's!   We left feeling SO disappointed and price raped.  I'd even spoken to the very kind manager, Jason.  I'd explained to him I'd dined at Bubby's for years for brunch and always loved it but not this time around.  He told us they've been serving brunch for 26 years and got that down to a science but that serving Thanksgiving dinner was still somewhat new.  He said he welcomed the feedback and would get the information back to the people who needed to hear it, yet he let us walk out of the restaurant feeling disappointed and did nothing.  I just don't get it!?!? By no means was I expecting a free or discounted dinner but SOMETHING would have been better than doing nothing at all.  How about a 10% coupon for the next visit??  How about a glass of wine on the house? Dinner was supposed to be my mothers treat but I felt so bad and so guilty after the experience that I told her I'd take care of it....",Bubby’s High Line,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Comfort, Food"

There is no waiting area, so if it's winter I also assume you'd be waiting outside. This made traffic at the door particularly bad and I think stressed out the hostesses a lot because people were constantly in and out checking on their tables and then obviously people walking in and out to leave or to be seated. They took our number to text us when our table was ready, but when we came to check because it had been a while, they were extremely rude asking why we hadn't shown up yet. It turns out they had taken our number down wrong, thus texting not my number, so I had no way of knowing the table was ready. Either way, no reason for attitude. Trust me, I did not want to wait outside smelling food for no reason....Was not a fan of the set up at all - with such a long wait, I couldn't understand why there was a giant spot in the middle with no tables or anything. Also, we were seated next to the bar and it felt like that was the path all of the wait staff took to bring customers their food, place orders at the kitchen and all of the customers walked that way to go to the bathroom. It felt like we were constantly being brushed by, which made it really unpleasant to eat and felt like we could get spilled on at any second. The food itself (and menu in general) had a lot of potential. However, my eggs Benedict were served cold (like so cold I thought maybe it was on purpose - did not feel like it was possible to get that cold just from sitting out). The flavor was good though, but just generally unpleasant to eat cold eggs. It was also just generally loud, but since I personally don't prefer that, but some people might not mind, I won't hold that against the restaurant itself. Overall, felt like a lot of hype for not that great of a spot!

84,f8MkhChEJzKwpDpV0hsLRw,Michael D.,1.0 star rating,"I came here with my boss for a late dinner, after being recommended to go eat here. I was very disappointed at my experience here. When we walked in we were instructed that the kitchen was closing in 20 minutes; I figured no problem will order and have our drinks. The server seemed bothered to attend us and RARELY came to us. We had to ask for water, along with utensils. Yes, after we ordered and the appetizers came out I had to walk up and ask the nice busboy for forks and knives. Now the only reason why I'm giving it a two star was due to the food being pretty good. I know NYC can never make ribs like Texas but I enjoyed it along with the biscuits which were delicious. The server who was a young lady just was not at all interested in our company. Probably due to us being really dressed down not realizing that we make more than her. The icing on the cake was that a small group of three came in after the kitchen was ""closed"" and I saw them receive stellar service.

I ordered the ribs which were bone try and not tasty at all. Creamy mashed potatoes were NOT creamy and dry as well. Sautéed Brusselsprouts were not cooked enough. The sauce i chose with my ribs was called a Texas BBQ sauce for my ribs and it was more like a sweet mustard taste in a tiny cup and they charge you extra $3 for another tiny cup.

Bubby's is known for their pretty standard American brunch fare - apparently they've been serving brunch every single day since 1990.  That's cool.  Brunch menu is mostly composed of eggs, sausage, bacon, home fries, grits, pancakes, burgers, and salads.  I usually go with one of the combination plates (bubby's breakfast, griddle special, grits breakfast) so you get a bite of several different things.  I've never been for dinner so can't speak to that! Unlimited coffee, just-interesting-enough cocktails, and of course, a few pies (apple, sour cherry, chocolate peanut butter, banoffee).  Everything is just standard - not bad, but also nothing to write home about.The most interesting thing about this location is the Ample Hills outpost if you're craving some delicious ice cream.  The special flavor here is called ""floating over the high line.""  It's like a root beer float - root beer flavored ice cream with chocolate and marshmallows.  Good if you like those flavors!",Bubby’s High Line,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Comfort, Food"

I order the same meal eggs Benedict and it felt as if they used cheaper ingredients. I use to love there home fries, which by the way cost $7 as a side, ridiculously over priced. They now are not seasoned as well and are either too soggy or burnt. The bread or biscuit they use to use was soft and buttery I'm not sure where it was fun I think an outside bakery but it was part of what made the dish so good. Now they use a small, bland, tough texture bread with the eggs Benedict that is underwhelming. My boyfriend got the huevos rancheros and said they were good, but I was the one that was craving this place. We both agreed that the bloody Mary's were also not good. They were boring and missing something that made them worth it. Overall I was very sad about this meal considering it cost $91. I don't plan on coming back unless they amp up this food again considering how expensive it is. The restaurant is also incredibly loud and crowded.

There is also something really depressing about a totally empty place that has music blasting...it just seems a bit desperate (We are having fun, right?!?!  RIGHT!?!?!) - Food was decent quality, but the prices are really high for the caliber of ambiance and service that you get here.

We were informed there was a wait and got slightly disheartened to the point where we were going to just try a cheap diner down the street. But as luck would have it, we got the call for our table while debating on the sidewalk if we wanted every day cheap...or a real NY experience. I am SO SO glad we did not go the cheap route!!The restaurant was PACKED (it was a Saturday morning). I mean i had a huge camera bag as well as purse for my daily adventure and i felt like i was in everybodys way trying to get to our table. It's a very intimate space full of morning chatter - so if you're looking for a serene dining experience choose wisely!Our waiter was prompt and brought us water in the cutest jars - nice little kitschy touch. The menu had amazing brunch options but this breakfast lover here went directly for the Eggs Benedict. I'm not going to lie...the price almost hurt my feelings. But the plate that was presented to me (picture attached, it was THAT beautiful) made it SO worth it. I switched the house salad option for their home fries (thank you for letting me substitute without a grimace or face of doubt). I had no clue what i was getting myself into!! Had i known, i wouldn't have had our late dinner and made sure my stomach was ready for this heaven-sent meal LOL!! The biscuits are TO DIE FOR. Like...i want to go back just to have more of those fluffy little pillows of southern perfection *dreaming*. Paired with thick-cut bacon, perfect eggs, and the home fries i was in fat kid heaven. I tried sooo hard to finish the plate because i did not want to waste such perfect food! I honestly don't remeber what my husband got, but i know it was good because he cleaned the plate in silence.

Not necessary a bad thing but does push the prices up.We came here for breakfast and had the pancakes which were ok, but nothing to write home about. I also had an egg cream soda, which some people seemed to love although it was way too sweet and artificial tasting for me.

Artichoke dish was stringy and presented in a very unappetizing manner; steak overcooked and tough, baked potato lukewarm and tasteless, etc. Despite apologies from hostess (who deducted the cost of drinks from our tab), the entire experience from start to finish was amateurish.

Conveniently located right under the high line it can get pretty touristy, and it can also explain their expensive prices. However, this place is absolutely worth it! You walk in and you automatically feel like you're not in New York City anymore, maybe a small little town in Vermont or somewhere up north. Every condiment on the table is homemade, and they claim to have the best coffee in New York. I can't answer if it was the best or not, but my iced coffee in a cute little mason jar was pretty solid. For the food - the pancakes are probably the best I've ever had. Like wow. Doused in a blueberry sauce and finding more blueberries as I cut through the pancakes, I was in blueberry heaven. Obviously the enormous portion preventing me from finishing them, but I did enough damage.

We didnt send them back-they were fine in the middle so we ate them. Then...our main course comes. We all ordered the fried chicken platters. Ours with a side of fries and our guests ordered a side of waffles. The fried chicken platters comes with a Breast, a leg, and a thigh. ALL THE PIECES WERE ALMOST BURNT.

I got the meat and three combo for dinner on a Friday night. we were seated right away as there were many empty tables, which was probably the first flag. All the meat options were above $20, which is a little nuts because Peruvian chicken does not cost that much at even the classiest of Peruvian restaurants. I wasn't going to get Peruvian chicken at a place for gringos, no thank you. So I ended up with meatloaf, which at $23 should have been the best meatloaf in this whole gd world, but instead i ended up with the saddest, thinnest, singular slice of meat with some ketchupy glaze on top that I doubt anyone has ever asked for or enjoyed, a little tiny cup of mashed potatoes, and the tiniest cup of gravy. I'm not even sure how they found a gravy cup that small but oh, they did. I felt like i was eating at a place that served miniature food in tiny cute cups and was paying for the novelty of it all. also I ordered broccoli as another side which was probably my mistake by trying to be healthy or whatever but what I got were two sprigs that were impossibly hard to cut into with the knives available to me. They were also tasteless which is odd since they're supposed to have been spicy.  I'm not sure *how* that broccoli was prepared but almost would have rather preferred it to have been frozen and boiled because at least I would've been able to eat it.

We tried three different sweet treats: homemade mint ice cream, black cow (ice cream soda) and a hot cherry pie & chocolate sundae. Their homemade ice cream is reminiscent of the stuff you can get at the Meatball shop. It's pretty damn delicious. I really enjoyed the ice cream soda - the black cow has some of their homemade soda which tastes like a cross between root beer and coke. The sundae was the crown jewel of our dessert feast.

After being ignored for upwards of an hour, we declined to order a final course. The only thing that could save our evening was dessert-- served somewhere else. Bubby's was an oasis of hospitality. Our waiter was cheerful and attentive. Even after it was obvious we weren't going to eat a full meal and our bill probably wouldn't amount to much, he remained graciously helpful, making suggestions but not pushing anyone to order more food, keeping our waters topped up, joking with us while we decompressed. Dessert itself was fine, if not extraordinary. Slices were cut large. The crusts held together without being too thick or detracting from the fillings, which were nicely blended but a bit bland in their sweetness. This was not exactly a stand out experience... more like decent in every way. But the next time I visit the Whitney I will gladly stop in for a snack, because I appreciate the unpretentious vibe.

For $24 they should really try to do a better job with this entree. Overall a disappointing experience. Typical of the neighborhood: overhyped and overpriced for blah food.

The spicyness of the vinegar cherry peppers offset the fish and potatoes. That was $26 and well worth it. House-made,Rocky road Ice-cream for dessert, one of the reasons I came back so soon.

181,uvI5nOW0fTcV4AV02Q8-wQ,Eric J.,4.0 star rating,"Pretty typical yuppie brunch in Chelsea. We arrived at 12:30pm on a Saturday, and only had to wait about 20 minutes for a table of two. There were lots of couples and kids, so while it might be good for groups, you might want to hold your large scale booze brunches elsewhere. We ordered the burger and the eggs florentine. Our water refills and drinks weren't coming too fast, but it was pretty busy, so we were more forgiving. Our food also took about 40 minutes, but again, feeling forgiving. We then found a hair in the eggs florentine, but the waiter was very apologetic and got us a new dish. We were growing a little impatient, but the food more than made up for it. The burger was delicious, cooked just right, and the fries were crispy and salted just right. Eggs were cooked right (minus the hair), and came with a large side salad and 4 pieces of toast. Even though it's a bit pricier, the portion sizes are definitely a bit larger. After we were done, the waiter apologized for everything going slowly and the hair in the food, so he comped us a free slice of peanut butter chocolate pie. Boy, was that pie rich and delicious. The peanut butter is definitely a bit more amped up than the chocolate, but overall, the ratio felt just right. After that, the waiter then comped us another slice of apple pie for the road. What a way to work for that tip. Can't blame him though, he did what he could to remedy the situation, and in the end, we were satisfied. Dunno if I'd pay the $8 per slice normally, but it is very good.Overall, the food is delicious, well-portioned, albeit a bit on the pricier side. I will definitely add this to the list of better brunch places in the city.

I have to say that we were most certainly not disappointed. It was really busy but in an exciting and fun way. It's quirky American diner, which was just what we were looking for. The menu was fantastic, although it meant making a decision about what to eat very difficult!I went for a BBQ pulled pork burger with Mac 'n' Cheese and my boyfriend had the pastrami burger from the specials with fries. He had beer and I went for a cream soda as I've not tried one before.The burgers were the best we've ever had. Really tasty, succulent meat, delicious marinades and good buns! I've never had proper Mac 'n' Cheese before so can't compare it but it was so much nicer than I imagined and much nicer than ones I've had in the UK. It was creamy, cheesy deliciousness! I wasn't a fan of the cream soda but that's probably more my taste. If you like cream soda, I imagine it's a good one!We were so full after our meal but couldn't resist dessert. I ordered two scoops of ice cream with hit fudge and whipped cream thinking it would be quite small and light. It was huge! More like 4 scoops going on UK sizes I'm used to! Very creamy and tasty though. My boyfriend ordered the peanut butter and chocolate pie. Wow! If you like peanut butter and haven't eaten anything for a week then go for it! Otherwise, maybe get it to share! It was delicious but so rich and huge. The staff were really friendly and helpful and the whole place was just brilliant. I highly recommend it.

Now 33, I was amped up to try the High Line iteration during my tri annual NYC pilgrimage. I wanted to love it - I was ready to love it - but I just didn't. Now it's time for the breakdown:Pros:1) Though the place was packed on Labor Day, the hostess promised to seat us indoors in under 15 minutes, and followed through.2) The decor was on point - such a lovely, beachy vibe in keeping with the nearby park3) Mimosa was delicious, no funky cheap champagne taste and fresh squeeze orange juice, I had two!4) Extensive, yummy sounding brunch menu. I saw some Eggs Benedict coming out of the kitchen that looked spectacular.5) My mom liked the coffee. And she is particular about her coffee, so this is HUGE.Cons:1) LOUD AS HELL. Not like, busy restaurant chatter, but normal conversation was out of the question. Too many people, too many tables, and too much terrible Top 40 music at club levels. At 11 in the morning? Come on, people. I could barely hear the waiter.2) Absolutely no real options for gluten free brunching (salad is not a real option). I settled for taking the bun off my burger, but at an average price of 20 bucks a plate, I shouldn't have to deconstruct my own food. 3) Bagel platter came with 2.5 pieces of salmon and a parmesan bagel. Noticed later that the menu offered a choice of bagel flavors, but our waiter did not. Again, for 20 bucks, my mom shouldn't have to hunt among lettuce leaves for one caper at a time.4) Burned fries5) No peanut butter pie6) Hostess staff rude to my mom when she asked to see a menu again.7) A 91.00 price tag for a burger, a bagel plate, 2 mimosas, a cup of coffee, and a tip.

The 1+2 is a bit overpriced, so she orders a chicken burger with veggies ground right in that gets its own star.

The fries were fries and I assume the cole slaw was from D'Agostinos.   I never understood why people feel uncomfortable eating alone but the staff at Bubby's really goes out of their way to make a guy feel awkward. After my meal I stepped into the takeout section of the restaurant to get a Latte for my sunset stroll along the High Line.  There was one person working and only one customer ahead of me.  I don't know what the person ordered but the employee disappeared, I waited 5 minutes and went on my way.It's a nice space and it's a restaurant that gives off a comfortable, fun atmosphere.  I guess if you can overlook shabby service & subpar food, you're gonna love this place.",Bubby’s High Line,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Comfort, Food"

We were told by the hostess the wait was 15-20 minutes -- my friends and I timed them to make sure that we didn't wait longer than was told and we were definitely seated within the time frame. We were seated outside which was nice but if only the sidewalk wasn't slanted because then the tables wouldn't have rocked back and forth. Our waitress was sweet, once seated we got our glasses filled with water -- she was very nice.My friends ordered The Double Bubby with a side of Spicy Pork Sausage (i think) and Eggs Benedict (with fries instead of homefries, the waitress said they're usually not allowed to change but she did it anyways) and I ordered the Griddle Special ( with bacon and eggs scambled ). Okay, so my friends and I were starving from the incredibly slow subway ride in from Queens and the fact that none of us ate anything since we've been awake. When we got our food and started eating, we all realized that their portions are bigger and more filling than they appear to be. My friend that ordered The Double Bubby almost couldn't finish half but considering he ate almost all of his fries, I understand. My other friend that ordered the Eggs Benedict, ate all her fries as well but also couldn't finish. I was able to eat my scambled eggs, bacon and one pancake -- my order came with two, even after only eating one I was filled with a giant food baby. But all in all the food was pretty good, some things could've been better, my friend said there was too much hollandaise sauce in her eggs benedict and it pretty much resembled mayonnaise. My friend who ordered the burger said that, the burger was ""too big"" but considering its $20-something it better be big. I on the other hand thought the bacon was a little over cooked, it was kind of tough to eat. And even after being stuffed my friend got a scoop of chocolate ice cream with sprinkles (lol what a big child he is). Minor things that bothered me, when I got my food I hadn't gotten syrup or butter for my pancakes. When I looked for my waitress, she was no where to be found. I sat there eating the rest of my food and saying to myself ""wheres the syrup and butter for my pancakes?"" -- especially when she was able to bring those two things to another table.

The pancakes are light and fluffy and the bacon was great (a smoked flavor to then) but you really can find a much better breakfast in the city, especially given the price. $52 for 2 meals and a kids meal. The coffee was also terrible - very sour. When I asked about it the waitress said that it was just a ""bold"" flavor. Definitely not bold, just sour. I'll happily take a diner cup of drip coffee but this was in drinkable. But I think they do switch out roasters off and on, so maybe it'll be better again. They were very kind to remove it from the bill.A few notes: someone mentioned the sourdough pancaked were not very sour/flavorful - my husband's was very strong.

When a seven year old hears he has a restaurant in the city named the same as his silly nickname- he makes you go, and we gladly did. We ended up going for dessert because I read ""Famous for their Pie"" We ended up getting to the place kind of late after getting a cab from Broadway just to make my son happy and not break a promise. We were determined to try this place for him. We get there and say we need a table for 4- for dessert. The hostess who was more busy playing a game on her phone told me we can only eat dessert at the bar. When I explain that would be impossible because I have a 5 and 7 year old. I plead with her that I am here just to make my son happy- and he just wants pie and off to cab and fall asleep and go back to the hotel. She shrugged. My husband irked we came all this way for her to tell us to get it to go- I asked if I get a meal or appetizer we can sit. Sighs- and says yes. So we do-- We get Mac and Cheese and Artichoke Dip and 4 pieces of pie and 3 Root Beers... $80 bucks. When we told them the Dip tasted a little funny- and they clearly say ""Oh yeah you didn't eat any of it"" it stayed on our bill for $13. The only pie that was decent was the Peanut Butter one that was super rich. The apple pie my son loved- but he was so excited to be there. The three stars come from someone coming to our table saying they heard my son say his name was ""Bubby"" and his birthday and gave him a ""Bubby"" cup. That was super sweet of them and he has shown everyone the mug that he could.

Considering the fact that I am a big breakfast person I was excited to try this restaurant out. The homely American Resturant was appealing and relaxing to the eyes. I was immediatly greeted the moment I walked through the door. Accidently walking in the wrong door in the carry out area my eyes were glazed on the pasteries and apple pie. A friend and I dined at a table top where we were again greeted by a server who welcome us. The menu was limited but had the perfect options for all types of diners. The prices were high but the type off food they sell is what your paying for. This spot cooks organic and fresh meals.I ordered a Hot Cider and Apple Pie since my taste buds craved the beautiful pie that was in the case when I walked in the door. My friend ordered a full breakfast with Blue Berry Pancakes, Chicken Sausage and Eggs. My Cider was good but it was not worth $5.00. My Pie was rather cold so I asked to have it warmed up. I did mention when ordering that I wanted nothing on the pie though it was served with powdered sugar and whip cream. Not a big deal as the pie was very tasty. I sampled on of my friends blue berry pancakes and they were delicious. She was very happy with all her food.

I must say, Bubby's was VERY smart when buying this location-it is the first restaurant that you see when getting off of the Highline, a good thing because most people will be hungry after their long Highline walk and be ready to sit down and eat without having to search around for a place.The restaurant is very neat-it almost reminds me of an old barn-and I loved the old fashioned soda fountain in the back. Our waitress was very kind and patient with me as I ordered-I am very indecisive and always feel bad about it.Bubby's menu isn't huge: there are about 10 different appetizers/salads, 3 burger options, 4 entrees, and a bbq platter option, but the food is very high quality, so places like this usually do tend to have a smaller menu. The food is simply good old comfort food, but your typical heavy and greasy comfort food-the meals are very fresh, you can tell. If there are just a few of you, I recommend ordering an assortment of appetizers as the meal so you can try a variety of things, which is what mother and I did.We ordered 4 appetizers for the 2 of us: the kale salad, Mac & cheese, nachos, and General tso's chicken meatballs-these starters are a good size and 4 of them were the perfect amount for us.The Mac & Cheese was good and the perfect comfort food. The order of General tso's meatballs had 3 meatballs and the sauce was a lighter version of your typical general tso's sauce-not as thick and sugary, more tangy. We feared the nachos would be a huge serving like most places that offer nachos as an appetizer, but these were not-they were the perfect size for 2 of us, in fact, and wasn't just a huge pile of chips with toppings. But be warned, they aren't your typical nacho-the chips are topped with salsa, black beans, cheddar, crumbled queso, salsa, light sour cream, guacamole, and radishes-yes, radishes. These nachos are way better than the standard Mexican style ones and much fresher.On to the kale salad-we decided we had to have SOME vegetables, and the kale salad seemed reasonable.

You can really taste the quality ingredients that they use. As far as burgers go, I'd rather get shake shack for cheaper and better, but as far as everything else in the menu, ITS SO GOOD. The shrimp tacos are superb. The mac n cheese has to be one of the best I've had in the city, and I've tried a lot of different places. The burrata with toast is phenomenal. The nachos are ehhh ok.

We got a small table outside and my first impressions were excited as the smells of everyone else's food were making my mouth water. Even though we were there around 6 pm we were saddened to find out they had no happy hour deals even though our server repeatedly reminded us about the bar specials. I ordered the Bubbys double burger which was obviously the go-to. Service was fast enough and when the burger came out I couldn't have been more satisfied. This double stacked burger was love at first bite. To eat it alone was a challenge, I had to keep the small wooden steak in the middle the whole time just to keep it from crumbling. Every aspect of it was perfected, the bun was crispy and buttery with a third middle bun to support the two substantial burger patties. The Bubbys ""special"" sauce was a familiar but still tasty addition and the toppings were all fresh. It came with a sizeable side of fries that were also delicious. Overall the atmosphere and food at Bubbys was a great dinner experience and while the food and drinks were a little pricey it seemed to be aimed for nearby hotel guests/tourists so the cost made sense.",Bubby’s High Line,3.5 star rating,$$,"American, (Traditional),, Comfort, Food"

I selected the fried chicken and biscuit sandwich and the sautéed spinach as my side. The biscuit was pretty legit but the chicken lacked flavor and there was way too much honey mustard smothered everywhere. We split a slice of pb chocolate pie.

We hadn't been there for much time and had only been seated for less than 5 mins. He had suggestively sold us on a signature drink and I just stuck to what I love. None the less we got the drinks, I went to the wash room, which there was no toilet paper, but I helped myself to put in a new roll that was under the sink, no biggy, I sat down and noticed we had water in our cups, awesome, and the waiter came back almost instantly and asked if we were ready to order, I had just sat and told him sorry I didn't bother looking at the menu I just got back from the bathroom, he said no worries and had came back a few mins later and took our appetizer order, and then our entrees after. Our wings came, and no site of Thomas to check in on us, but I spotted him at the server station on his phone and chatting it up with co workers, I noticed when he had greeted and took care of other guest, he has poured their waters and refills for them, but for us that was NEVER the case. It started to make me think not such good thoughts about him, it almost felt that we were singles out, and I felt it was almost a race thing, he probably thought he sees a Hispanic couple and we probably weren't going to tip because every other table he had was shall we say, NOT Hispanic. Our food came and it was amazing ""well mine was"" but seeing that again Thomas had never came back to our table to check on any of our meals, he wouldn't have known that my friend wasn't really enjoying his chicken burger ""which he never told us that it was an up charge for the cheese, I got the avocado, but cheese, really?"" See I base my tips off of service. And there was lack of, there was maybe 5% attentiveness, I work in the restaurant industry and I've been in the industry for a while now, and I know great customer service is key to getting a great tip. It bothered me to my core because if he had even came by twice to make sure our wings were good, drinks as well, then I wouldn't be writing such a long horrible review.

The one who brought our food automatically gave the Double Bubby to my bf and the chicken burger to me. I guess its because it was double beef so the portion was bigger than the chicken burger so he assumed my boyfriend ordered it and I ordered the chicken because I'm small! Lol... Just thought I'd sharw that. It was a breezy Sunday night it was chilly but tolerable and so we ate outside. Its a pretty cool restaurant. Our usher was this lovely, friendly gal. I liked her.

Choice of eggs (fried), meat (bacon), breakfast potatoes and choice of bread (wheat). Boy, was I full. Granted, you could get this meal at a zillion diners around the country for half the price, but you're in Meatpacking in New York. Expect to pay double what you think the stuff is actually worth.

It wasn't. First, I asked for the soup without cream on top. It came out with cream so they brought me a new one. Unfortunately this one didn't have any olive oil, which would have helped cut the overly acidic soup. It was overpowering broth that tastes like raw garlic and white vinegar. The chopped bits of raw red onion and green bell pepper didn't help things. I should have ordered a side of avocado to cut things, but after paying 10 bucks for this mouth assault, I decided against it. My dining partner had a fried chicken sandwich, which was underwhelming, according to him. I think it's the fact he paid 17 bucks for it that made him less enthusiastic about it. The fries were well cooked and tasty. I wish we had just ordered a bowl of those. We would have left happier!The servers were very nice and kind.

Bubby's is great if you are in the mood for fried chicken or pie, which they have been serving for year's at their other locations. The new Ice Cream Shop that was added to the High Line needs to change drastically if they want it to survive.  Bubby's charges $12 for a sundae, which is ridiculous even in the sea of $10,000 handbags that is the meatpacking district. What do you get for your $12? A pasty ice cream substance that tastes like air in a tiny container with watery syrup and tasteless whipped cream. The ice cream was completely flavorless. The only decent thing on the sundae was the nuts, which Bubby's can't claim responsibility for. The service was equally terrible. This is ""Bubby's to-go"". They serve ice cream and coffee. It took us nearly 20 minutes after we ordered to get our sundaes and we had to remind the counter people to make them. The woman in front of us had ordered an ice coffee and it took her equally as long to get her item. You can't run a to-go service that way. Do not go here. Seriously, just don't.

We split the kale salad and burger and washed them down with a Cote du Rhone.  The kale salad was good - the grapefruit was a nice touch.  The fries were good too - skinny and perfectly cooked. But the burger - oh my God - so chewy, juicy and filled with char-grilled goodness!  The beef was obviously very high quality and perfectly cooked - medium rare on the inside and nicely charred on the outside.  Summary:  This is a friendly fun place with fresh and tasty food and a lively atmosphere.

The Double Bubby can only be ordered medium or so the waitress said. That's not happening for me since I like it rare. But the deal on that burger is sweet. For 2 bucks more than the standard burger it comes with cheese and bacon! And two patties, even though the meat oz. serving is the same amount.The $$ are fairly high for burgers, 19 to 21 bucks. Fries mounded high and a pickle accompany that. I opted for a salad instead, and it was a nice large excellent salad!Beer selection quite good, nice wine list also, beer reasonable- wine typical NYC at plus 10 bucks and up a glass..The side of spicy broccoli at $6 was done to a T. But at maybe 6 floweret sized pieces, the serving size was in the ""stingy"" category. Take note of that Bubby peeps.Desserts are killer, the pies and cinabon look alike selections looked great, we had the brownie cheesecake sans the extras worthy of $11 and all alone was $6.Dynamite tasting but smallish piece of cheesecake.   A $75 meal, was it worth it? It's New York right? 2 burgers, 2 beers, a tine veggie side and dessert should cost that much right?You decide.Plenty of 20 somethings all the way up to boomers seen enjoying a Monday night out.The place is all windows so on this 10 degree day, the middle of the place was the only comfortable place to sit.

This was the very first restaurant I came to when moving to NY from SF in January. I met a friend for dinner on a Thursday night and we luckily had no wait-- what immediately sold me on Bubby's were the mac n cheese and veggie chili. Talk about two incredible dishes that are super affordable and pretty generously portioned! (Out of the two, I'd go for the veggie chili. The sour scream and tortilla chips that come with it just make the dish sooo yummy.) I have to admit, when my friend suggested a restaurant in the meatpacking district, I thought it was going to be overpriced and full of pretentious people, but I was wrong. Bubby's has been a go-to place for me to grab drinks, and the food makes it only that much better. I went back this past weekend with a friend who was in town from CA, and we went to town on the menu: started out with the brussel sprouts and peppers, and then for entrees: steak, veggie chili, and taco of the day. All of it was so.freaking.good. The brussel sprouts had sriracha sauce infused in them-- wtf? How does that even exist?! Freaking amazing. It's a must-try. and that veggie chili... soo good. And even the taco of the day was pretty decent for Mexican food in NY. Not the best I've ever had, but pretty damn good. Comes with beans, rice, the whole deal! My friend really enjoyed his steak (medium rare) and it's a big portion.The other icing on the cake was that now, Bubby's serves San Francisco beer from a bar there, 21st Amendment. So awesome. :)Tommy and Ricky are so much fun here too- they work the bar and are both super down to earth, personable, and nice.

The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating and is very cute. They make practically everything on the menu including they're own sodas in many different flavors. I had salmon as an entree which was pretty good. The hush puppy sides were absolutely awesome; I definitely recommend that. The peanut butter pie is great, but I recommend splitting as it's hard to finish! I heard that Bubby's was known for their dessert shaved ice which I got. I much preferred the pie over the ice, but it was worth a shot! Also another dessert that's worth considering to split. The service was great when it wasn't crowded. However, when the restaurant began filling up, it got a little slower including waiting a while for the check.

I will never come to this location again. It was Sunday evening around 7 and not very crowded. I ordered the barbecue with choice of two meats and 2 sides. After placing thw order the waiter returned about 3 minutes later saying they only had chicken. I agreed to only chicken, then but since they had green beans as a special I requested that as a side. He said it wasn't an option. Several minutes later he returned to explain they were out of broccoli so I would need to order another side. I requested the green beans to which he said it was a $2 upcharge since it wasn't one of the sides. I agreed to pay the extra. A few minutes later he returned to say they were out of the other side i had ordered. At this point my friend said let's go somewhere else. The waiter said ""I dont blame you, I would too"".

I wish I would have gotten the nachos for my meal alone so I didn't have to share. For lunch I had a cheeseburger and fries and it was delicious. I did ask for no bun because I have a gluten allergy but it came out on a bun so they don't cater to allergies very well but nonetheless it was great. I had the lemonade as well and it was very sweet and very good. It came out pink which I wasn't expecting, and it was served in an adorable mason jar it almost was too pretty to drink. My coworkers raved about the biscuits (which I couldn't have but I'll take their word they were amazing) and everyone was extremely happy with the place.

It took another 20 minutes to have a server even speak to us. I ordered a medium rare burger -- it came bloody and cold. Completely undercooked. By the time I sent it back and they returned a new, ""medium-rare"" burger, my dining companions meal was completely cold and inedible. After complaining first about the wait to the manager, we were given a glass of wine each, and after the burger incident we were given an unwanted piece of cake from the server. The server was actually nice and felt badly about our experience but nothing could have made up for the generally awful experience. The hostess and manager were rude and not sincerely apologetic or understanding about the irrational wait times and overall experience. Sure, throw in a free drink and free cake -- which we didn't really want either of, but be sincere.  Literally will never go back or recommend this to anyone.
