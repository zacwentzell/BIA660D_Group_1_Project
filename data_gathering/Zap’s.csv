1,ZjOA_ECGUXr7w2NzGXlwSA,Jen C.,3.0 star rating,"Zaps is one of those places that everyone knows your name. I don't think I would of ever gone there except for the fact that my exbf liked his drinks way to much and could find a bar in any neighborhood, like a needle in a haystack. I don't think you would necessarily make zaps as your destination but if you lived in the hood and needed a clean place to grab a drink and some food, well this is your spot. They are pretty chill here and even let me bring in my pup. I don't know if I would call it a hidden gem, but it's definitely someplace to hit if you need to hide out from your annoying roommates or ponder the reason why you are living in the heights of Jersey City. The drinks are strong and reasonable and they will make you food, that's all you need. The decor is a bit dated but hey you don't go here for the ambiance.",Zap’s,3.5 star rating,$,"Bars,, American, (New)"
2,dl4ENy4Bk6-lCu59A8vxbg,Bloss C.,3.0 star rating,"Oh Zaps, I've lived a few blocks away from you for years, but have only been inside your marvelously clean doors 3 times.  Why am I such an infrequent visitor?  Do I not like bar food or drinks?  Are your prices unreasonable?  Do you not accept credit cards?  Nay to all the above.  Zaps is meticulously clean, has a fairly wide bar food menu, accepts cards (an oasis of modern finance practice in this area), and charges good prices for beer and mixed drinks.  Its the hours; Zaps is open Monday thru Friday until 9 PM each night.  That's it.  Closes at 9PM each night and not open at all over the weekends.  So I will resign myself to infrequent visits until I reach retirement...... in about 40 years.  That said, if you can fit some day drinking into your schedule I recommend stopping in and chatting Walter up about the neighborhood, he's got all of the good stories.",Zap’s,3.5 star rating,$,"Bars,, American, (New)"
3,K1iAEqECj053LtZszEg0Rw,Shaun M.,5.0 star rating,"I had the cheeseburger and it was excellent!!  The draft beer was unbelievably fresh, so you can tell they clean their lines properly.  I also met and spoke with to the owner Walter who is a really nice guy.  I would recommend this place to anyone look for a laid back place to hangout, have a cold beer and good conversation.",Zap’s,3.5 star rating,$,"Bars,, American, (New)"
4,4C4xXHjI2Ay2ajSpKrLkcQ,Betzy G.,4.0 star rating,"I gave this place a try last night. My gf had the Philly cheesesteak and I had the grilled chicken sandwich. All I have to say is, that's the best grilled chicken sandwich I had tried so far. The Chicken was cooked perfectly, the fries were good as well, try the sweet potato fries, nice and crunchy. My gf liked her Philly cheesesteak, too. Will def. return to try their pizza. They have beer, wine and spirits. Not much of a bar ambience nor a restaurant.",Zap’s,3.5 star rating,$,"Bars,, American, (New)"
5,ohaKZ_3CH30qbvkBahrfGw,Rene R.,4.0 star rating,"It's dark from the outside but you'll be surprised by the warm and inviting, clean interior. Had a burger with fries and a beer for 12 dollars and the portions were large, fresh and delicious. Chad, the bartender and cook when flying solo was absolutely nice and a pleasure to talk to.",Zap’s,3.5 star rating,$,"Bars,, American, (New)"
6,HU35mncnfUXcc1d_QEgdiA,illy D.,5.0 star rating,"I really love this place. If you want to eat classic bar food and watch a game, this is the place. I had the corn nuggets, fried mac & cheese, and buffalo wings. Can't complain about really anything. The owner is awesome and funny. Good time all in all. My new go to spot.",Zap’s,3.5 star rating,$,"Bars,, American, (New)"
7,JU8ON5ZESlljxVJu9zTCiQ,Pat S.,1.0 star rating,"Pizza was good and expensive. Very much a right wing, heterosexual joint. Would make the hairs of any non-white, non-heterosexual, non-male curl up in fear.",Zap’s,3.5 star rating,$,"Bars,, American, (New)"
8,wGK8XFcVrkAzwvEkRtJANw,Joey K.,5.0 star rating,"First off I have to say my taste buds and stomach probably have not ever felt this satisfied after eating at a heights establishment until I had the pleasure from eating at Zap's. I have a buddy that knew I was into having a good burger and recommended Zap's to me. I waited to long and passed to many opportunities until I entered this gem. I had a medium rare cheeseburger with mutz and some veggies to top. WHAT!!! What the he*l was I waiting for, that burger was delicious. Grilled to perfection and juicy. I had such a great experience I will definitely be returning to try some other food choices and probably have some drinks. Bravo Zap's",Zap’s,3.5 star rating,$,"Bars,, American, (New)"
9,V16qSj5kkd6_MCWX47400Q,A G.,1.0 star rating,"Was really looking forward to this place--interesting bar food selection--but don't bother going here if you want food. Owner will just rant politics at you, call you stupid to your face several times, and when you try to shift the conversation back to ordering, he'll go off on wanting to commit genocide. Kind of ruins the appetite. Apparently cares more about pontificating than actually running his business. In the end, after 10-15 minutes of this, we just left.",Zap’s,3.5 star rating,$,"Bars,, American, (New)"
10,CJ6wugoaQ8Kyv0FuRUv-lg,Min A.,4.0 star rating,"Been wanting to check this place out for a long time in our quest to find a friendly neighborhood tavern with some decent eats.  ZAP was recommended by a neighbor.  Extensive menu, and what we ordered was good.  Friendly bartender.  Lots of flat screens and plenty of tables for those who don't want to sit at the bar.  My one suggestion is an option to hear music.  While there, satellite reception was lost due to a rain storm, so music would have been nice.  They are currently only open M-F from 11am to 9 pm.  Definitely going back.  Try the fried macaroni and cheese!",Zap’s,3.5 star rating,$,"Bars,, American, (New)"
