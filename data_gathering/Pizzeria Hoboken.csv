0,Eh0VD1lDIb8aIBk_VobkNA,Lory M.,3.0 star rating,I paid over $15.00 for Shrimp Alfredo and only got 4 little shrimps! (See picture). That is ridiculous! How stingy! The Alfredo sauce was bland too. I've had their pizza before and it was also bland. The only reason I'm giving them 3 stars is because the chicken roll and hot sandwiches (Hroboken & Orale) is good. Delivery time is usually decent (30mins or so).,Pizzeria Hoboken,2.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Salad,, Sandwiches"
1,1JDxaio4xWG1sa71GJKHsw,Evan M.,3.0 star rating,"I'm thinking 3-3 1/2 stars for Pizzeria Hoboken. I'm glad they opened in my neighborhood; they chose a spot that's had spotty success and they're making it work. The pizza is good, not my fav in town but respectable slices. Actually I've found their other food to be more satisfying.  Try the cheeseburger deluxe or one of their sandwich specials and you may be more satisfied than with the pizza. I feel that they're high in their pricing, asking Washington Street $$ for their soda and slices.  The eating space is clean and new, which is nice; you order at the counter and they'll bring it out if they're not overly busy. Overall, a welcome addition to the neighborhood.",Pizzeria Hoboken,2.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Salad,, Sandwiches"
2,fbhRFckDkMOCZFSxpOM4xA,Kimberly M.,1.0 star rating,"Not sure what happened: this place has gone completely downhill since its opening.  My main issue is the service behind the counter.  The female server had a long ponytail worn to the front, and her hair was nearly hanging in the food she was handling.  No gloves are worn while preparing food.  It's visibly disgusting - if I didn't already pay for my food, I would have been out of there.  Also took them about 20 minutes to fulfill my order for a basic sandwich special.",Pizzeria Hoboken,2.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Salad,, Sandwiches"
3,-gkcx2A7T1xw8V9ST5T4gg,Louisa M.,1.0 star rating,Do not believe the 4-5 star rating on Seamless and Delivery.  This place deserves zero stars.  The delivery itself was early (imagine that!). The pizza was so bad it had to be thrown away.  This is hands down the worst pizza I've had IN. MY.  LIFE. Crust is awful-tough and flavorless.  Sauce?  Just a whisper-and also flavorless.  Cheese tasted like nothing.  Never had such an outrageously bad pizza in a while.  Thanks for reminding me that no-bad pizza is not better than no pizza,Pizzeria Hoboken,2.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Salad,, Sandwiches"
4,8IJAx6NegpSnaF45dF2oAQ,Amanda O.,1.0 star rating,Food was delivered almost half an hour late and freezing cold. So thanks for nothing! Horrid resteraunt,Pizzeria Hoboken,2.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Salad,, Sandwiches"
5,dm1eCxss86LudwacBDuYDA,Johnny M.,1.0 star rating,"I would look to avoid this place if you are ordering takeout. My order (one pepperoni pie, one cheese pie) took THREE HOURS to get delivered. Not thirty minutes late. Not an hour late. Three whole hours. After about an hour of waiting I tried calling the restaurant but what do you know - their phone was not working. They finally delivered the pizzas three hours later and by then nobody wanted them. And to top it all off - they refused to give me a refund. Steer clear of here if you're looking to grab a quick slice or pie.",Pizzeria Hoboken,2.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Salad,, Sandwiches"
6,gWVnlOBy2qedUctiYtlvLw,Jamie G.,1.0 star rating,"Wow.  I'm not sure how they managed to remove all the taste from their pizza but it must be very labor intensive cause they charge $3.25 (+tax) for a plain slice. Last night, I bought 2 slices. After I choked the 1st slice down, I threw the other away. The dough is not only tasteless but somehow both too weak to support the cheese and too hard at the crust. Sorry, I call it cheese, but I mean that very loosely cause it may have actually been plastic. I'm not sure. You've been warned.",Pizzeria Hoboken,2.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Salad,, Sandwiches"
7,FeMsLF-pwWS5HaDukprpIQ,Graciela O.,1.0 star rating,Never again will I order from here. I waited 1 hour and 10 minutes for a small pie and it was as cold and hard as a hockey puck! They didn't even attempt to bring a fresh pie. They picked it up and gave me my money back. Terrible business manners!,Pizzeria Hoboken,2.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Salad,, Sandwiches"
8,tt1vLgAP5UpRXAKJLT2KWg,Alec K.,3.0 star rating,"One of the closest places to get pizza in West Hoboken. Prices are very expensive ($3.25 a slice - whaaa!?) and the service is very slow, despite the place usually being empty.

9,cgGIQznWzVjaZWDcMOgHKA,Vanessa G.,1.0 star rating,"First impressions are the most important to me, even when it comes to trying food spots for the first time. I ordered here because I work about 4 blocks away and everybody in my job orders from there. I was excited about my meal. I ordered a bacon, egg & cheese burger, I even emphasized on my order that I want the burger cooked medium & it was over cooked. Even the over easy egg was almost burned.

11,tHmEDIWg9oFojy8eXkzeGw,Michael G.,5.0 star rating,"Ordered the baked ziti, greek salad and garlic knots,  The food was awesome and the servings were pretty big.  Delivery came in under 30 minutes.  I haven't tried the pizza yet but I highy recommend the pasta dishes.  Thumbs up!",Pizzeria Hoboken,2.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Salad,, Sandwiches"
12,aK0qo1Sf_hHWl8th6ksxmQ,Nicole C.,3.0 star rating,"We ordered a garden salad ($8), an eggplant parm wrap ($9) and a fire of turkey wrap ($10.50). The salad wasn't really all that great considering it's $8 and I could go to Panera for about the same price and get an incredible salad with toppings galore. The eggplant parm wrap was good but I was not a fan of the fire of turkey wrap and I have no idea why it costs $2.50 more. It's a shame that this place isn't better because it is only two blocks from our apartment.",Pizzeria Hoboken,2.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Salad,, Sandwiches"
13,ocCjEInafkH78vMsrS3Tpw,Dan O.,1.0 star rating,"Ordered food through Grubhub. Was told it would be here 1:40-1:50. It is now 2:15 and I have made multiple calls to office. I was told to relax and that it was busy. If you cannot keep up with grubhub/seamless delivery time and are rude to your customers,you should not be allowed on the app. I wish there was a way to cancel now that my delivery is 50+ minutes late.

14,J60FxFZpeVFIJtNn7fLmqA,James N.,3.0 star rating,"Pizza is good, the selection is limited. Not a very big menu, almost nothing other than pizza or stromboli. The price is higher than normal.

16,N7qpf51gx8c4UoKhcIk43A,Tricia P.,5.0 star rating,"Live in the 8th Jefferson neighborhood, and glad the Pizzeria came to us. Burrata salad and Spinach Goat Cheese salad were fresh and made with quality ingredients, nice EVOO. The garlic knots were soft and tasty, I've had these many times in the NYC metro area, and these at Pizzeria H are among the top of the heap. Most times they are either dry or hard from oversitting all day long. As for entrees, the Chicken Parmesan, Chicken Francaise, Cheese Ravioli, Stuffed Shells and Spaghetti were all delicious and the sauces were very nice. Fresh san marzanos in sauces and ingredients. Prices are not the lowest, but food overall quality is much better than most of the others hundreds of fast italian options in New York and Hudson Counties.",Pizzeria Hoboken,2.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Salad,, Sandwiches"

Totally screwed up the sauces. Instead of balsamic vinaigrette for salad, they sent marinara sauce. Completely forgot to send the blue cheese for the wings, which had nothing buffalo about them. The calamari and wings were sub par. To top it all off they sent spoiled burrata with the salad making it inedible.

And it's not like they're busy, the employees are just standing around. They're way overpriced for the mediocre quality.
