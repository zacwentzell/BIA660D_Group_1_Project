42,QmXD8PoMBe5WHX0diF2g0g,Shonnie H.,3.0 star rating,"A Korean Chipotle? Korilla was first in line to tap that potential, and I did make that somewhat of a point of comparison. I never thought Korilla's bowls were all that great either, because you're really just making a mumbo hocus pocus bibimbob. Now I know why Koreans have banchan (side dishes) and don't put 'em all in one dish - each side has a distinct taste of its own, which, when combined, is somewhat overwhelming. I can't quite put a finger to which add-on was more overpowering than the others, but I wasn't too thrilled after eating half the dish. The protein (I asked for spicy chicken, can't remember what SO ordered but he asked for Katsu sauce) wasn't well marinated - more like they were swimming in the sauce for a while after being fully cooked? Not certain, but given their namesake, the meats should be far better marinated than that.  I should add that I didn't come with wildly high expectations - I knew it was a more modernized spin on Korean food, and if I wanted a straight up Korean meal, I'd go to Pal Park. Having a Korean father means Korean food shows up on every meal back home, but I hadn't had any Korean food in a couple weeks since my mother went out of town, and I was eager to get my hands on some gochujang (and THAT part was absolutely fulfilled - that's the sauce I asked for!)Let me start off by saying that the concept's potential remains - I also love how they give you an option to get fried eggs to top off your bowl at $1. I'd just like to see a way for the protein, sauce, and add-ons to congregate in sweet harmony in my mouth. The staff was also off-putting. We arrived at around 5:30pm on Thursday (yesterday), and it was pretty empty. The staff - no smiles, not loud enough, and just a depressing demeanor in general. For a new establishment, the atmosphere was strangely somber. Also, I would like to add that your card reading machine is pathetic - you do realize that when you ask a patron to put in their PIN CODE, everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, near that person could SEE the code. Put a cover on it or something - never saw that before. Blame it on that merchant's not-so-genius invention, but you still chose it!I do fully expect that the establishment will make improvements as they move along - and I absolutely welcome the addition of Korean spots in Hoboken. I cook on most week nights, but that might also be because Hoboken doesn't have a great deal of good restaurants. So Gogi Grill is giving me that simple option to grab a quick bite before jumping on the shuttle, and I'm definitely putting it on my rotation list. I'll revisit this review after several tries.

They are still in soft opening mode, so there were some minor issues with their payment system, but I'm sure they'll figure it out soon. This is a fast casual place - think Asian Chipotle. You pick your base (bowl, salad, or burrito), your meat (short rib +$2 ftw!!!!), 4 base ingredients (sauteed onions duh), and a sauce. I was overwhelmed by the sheer variety of options and the amount of food they give you. SO MUCH GOOD FOOD!! You can sample things too, if you aren't sure what the ingredients are. I would recommend getting the sauce on the side as some flavors might not always go well together. It was fine for me but for my coworkers who have never had Korean food before, I wish they had sample combos (e.g a numbered menu of options) so that it makes it somewhat easier to order. (Thinking of Honeygrow combos, with option to customize.)If you're ordering for the first time, try to stick to the ingredients you know (like lettuce, corn, onions, etc.) and depending on how brave you feel, try mixing in new(er) ingredients like kimchi, radish, etc. Get the short rib!!! The line can get busy, so I would get here right at 12. Make sure to get the rolled ice cream and coffee after :) Angels is located inside the Gogi Grill restaurant. Brilliant if you ask me.

I ordered a bulgogi bowl and added an egg (perfect over-easy egg!) Also tried gochujang and cilantro-lime sauce and both were delicious. I appreciate that the spice levels were hot, but not so hot that you could only taste the sauce and not the food. Just right. The bulgogi was tasty and I was impressed with how much meat was in my bowl. I seemed to get a little bit in every bite once I mixed it all up. My partner tried a chicken bowl with teriyaki sauce and all I can say is that he's usually a slow eater but he really woofed it down so it must have been good! :D We also tried an order of the kimchi tots for fun, which I thought would be super weird but were actually pretty delightful. I was not expecting the cheese to be... cheese whiz? But eating it made me happy, like eating moms mac&cheese. The tots could have been a crispier but that's just my preference.The delivery guy was really friendly and arrived earlier than the estimated time. Everything about the order was perfect.

The overall menu set up was confusing, typically whenever I go you start off telling them the base and then the protein, their menu was set up with protein first even though the crew will ask you what base you want. After the slight confusion, highly recommend their management change this, we were back in business. I had the potato vermicelli and bacon with a few veggie toppings. My favorite were the watercress and radish, I love an added crunch factor. There's a variety of sauces to choose from so if you have a chance try a few and see which ones you like.

It is worth it. For 3 extra dollars you get much more chicken.Update: Food is good, my boyfriend and I are addicted, but when ordering from the store, be sure to check your bag before leaving. I was so dissapointed when I got home and realized that I was missing my two teriyaki sauces. The sauces really do make a difference in the food. Otherwise, it's a bit dry/bland sometimes depending on the toppings you get. I would have gone back to Gogi Grill if I had not just spent 15 minutes finding parking.  My boyfriend has now ordered an additional bowl via delivery so that we can get what should have come with our two bowls to begin with.

Similar to Chipotle, they build bowls and burritos in an assembly type system so servive goes by pretty quickly. 1) Your order either a bowl, burrito or salad2) You pick your starch, your protein, and your toppings (up to 4)There are at least four options for each category so the combinations are endless. They have scallion pancakes for order as well. I ordered the bowl, with sweet potato vermicelli, shortrib, kimchi, cucumber, sprouts, and spicy slaw, with the spicy Korean red pepper sauce on the side. And it was everything I expected it to be. The key for Korean food is freshness, and, as someone who is Korean, I felt that the food was not only fresh, but also authentic. The combinations can also range vastly on what you're feeling that day because they have so many options - although my choices veered towards more pickled vegetables and fresh flavors, my boyfriend ordered a heavier meal with korean fried rice, spicy korean bacon as his starch and protein. The food here exceeded my expectations and I am always recommending it to my friends in the area.

And don't forget to save room for dessert since they have rolled ice-cream in the same spot. Perfect place to grab a quick lunch and dessert (though it's just as great for dinner).

Entree: shrimp Kimchi Bowl #2 with purple rice and lime jalapeño sauce (only sub - opted for the un-buttered kimichi side options instead of the buttered that it came with). Pros (mostly): Everything was moist and flavorful to compliment each other. The shrimp was seasoned well. Cons:  Kimchi cucumbers were bland and the sauce was flat (added the side of the ""hot"" sauce). Overall, good meal that's a nice change to what's standardly available.

I was ecstatic when I heard a Korean-food restaurant opening up as the nearest one is miles away. Ordered a bowl with Korean fried rice, short ribs, and some greens. Service could definitely be better. I came in when there were no one there and everyone seemed busy prepping the food or something. After waiting a little while, I had to initiate for them to take my order. Once I made the bowl, they left it in the counter for quite a while. Although, they give a pretty good quality take-out bag. Price wise, I spent 12 on the bowl alone, decent.I asked them for green sauce and they either forgot or put a minuscule amount. Yet, the food still tasted great. Rice was cooked thoroughly and had good texture. The kimchi was slightly too much. Butter is fine usually, but I felt it overbearing as well. The ribs were slightly chewy. Definitely can't compare to a legit Korean barbecue. But at this speed and convenience, can't really complain.",Gogi Grill - Hoboken,4.0 star rating,$$,"Korean, Asian Fusion, Fast Food"

The staff were friendly and I thought all of the food was delicious and good value for the money spent.That said, despite being the only customer placing an order at the time, it still took over 15 minutes to actually get it. I think part of that is likely because this restaurant is very new and the staff haven't really ironed out their workflow yet.

It was a large portion, so my hopes for a decent meal was excited to have comfort food for the blizzard slash snowpocalypse of 2017. It arrived on time with a kind delivery person, and all the components from the purple rice to the cucumber kimchi had great texture and flavor. I mean, who doesn't like purple freakin' rice?!? However, the main protein, the star, the core of my craving, the kalbi short rib itself? It was too well done, some parts actually burnt. Womp womp, indeed.  How underwhelming! In fact, instead of being tender, fatty, and flavorful with marinade it was too chewy and dry. There want enough protein also, but I'm more disappointed by texture & lost opportunity. This restaurant is in the sweep of popularized manhattan's Korilla and jersey city's Kraverie plus Beechwood's Korean fare tickled in their menu. Sadly, at a $20+ tag with delivery fee, you can't mess up the meat quality. At that price point, it doesn't compare to the aforementioned spots in technique and attention to the proteins. Korean food and this bowl are meant to channel the tart, spicy, and savory concept of a bibimbop and it's obnoxious that the meat doesn't deliver. Why not cook the steak correctly? Perhaps, this is the downfall of the fast food bowl, but it's been executed by others. Was it my bad luck and their off day? Summary: Flavors are strong but texture of proteins need improvement to come correct. I'm surprised with all the positive reviews clad the stars. Maybe Hoboken has Korean food scarcity? Either way, treat the meat right, Gogi. It would make the difference of average to outstanding. You, me, and the meat, we all deserve more.

We found it! ...and so happy we did. This is the better and more authentic of the two restos, sorry to be so bluntly honest. We love korean food and kimchi and BBQ (my husband makes a mean korean BBQ). We followed on the footsteps of a kind korean gentleman who told us this was korean food was delicious and authentic. We ordered what he was getting: the beef taco with spicy kimchi and watercress topped with korean Spicy hot sauce. We also got 2 sides, the pickled radish which was delicious and the slaw which was also tasty but a little overly rich for me (FYI you get 4 free sides so if you want two, for ex, on top of your taco but don't want to overload your taco with toppings, they will give you the other two on the side). The servers were knowledgable and very kind and helpful. We got all 4 types of taco mains: beef, tofu, shrimp, and spicy chicken. For me the beef and tofu were equally outstanding. The spicy chicken was good but since marinated created less satisfying smokiness and less contrast with moist toppings if that makes sense. I didn't try the shrimp but my husband enjoyed it. Tacos were a good size with authentic korean spice, great kimchi!!! So excited to have authentic korean food in Hoboken!!  Afterward we had the rolled ice cream by Angel. First, I'm an ice cream fiend, searching for the best anywhere. We ordered the Moonlight Sonata (earl grey) condensed milk, and Toasted marshmallow. It was incredible.   It had great earl grey flavor, wonderful and satisfying creaminess like gelato with the freshness of the rolled ice cream. It was some of the best ice cream I've had in the nyc area. Angel is a superlative chef and ice cream artisan and he's truly mastered his craft. His ice cream was way better than the one in the West village that had a line out the door. Also, smart to marry ice cream with BBQ. Great combo, the ice cream lightening the spiciness of the authentic korean food we ate prior and the hot (bbq) and cold (ice cream) a great marriage for winter months. I will be back here a lot. Next time shall try the rice bowl and more ice cream flavors. Also the place (in true korean fashion) is spotlessly clean and very welcoming.
