0,DKL8THTMRcTcMfVuNmaF4g,Hank C.,2.0 star rating,"Walk-up* window. No indoor space. Bathroom needed? Make sure you get buzzed in.Not exactly the epitome of speed and efficiency, but at least they're up to almost 24-7 operations (drive thru only).Speed of food is worse than other McD's in the area.Also, noticed the walk up menu was smaller than normal. Only goes over the top meal packages.",McDonald’s,1.5 star rating,$,"Fast, Food,, Burgers,, Coffee, &, Tea"

2,Bnicf-eFeronuSkMoR7cdw,Ryan A.,1.0 star rating,"0 stars DO NOT GO HERERude Employees (been here during multiple times of the day)The order accuracy is a joke, it's as if they throw random food in your bag and hand it out.Just went, I ordered a simple sausage, egg and cheese bagel. Being that it's 7:30 in the morning I gave them the benefit of the doubt and told myself that they couldn't possibly mess it up, right? lol WRONG *Donald Trump voice*I get home to a bagel harder than a hockey puck, with bacon egg and cheese, and some weird white sauce that I think was ranch? So I called to let them know because I was a little disappointed. Some woman picks up and gives me an attitude after I explained my situation as if this was all and inconvenience for her. After playing hot potato with the phone I got in touch with a woman names Cindy, who was very accommodating letting me know I can get a new meal on her. But sorry to say after this I will never return to this location ever again. I am willing to drive 10 minutes out of the way to go to a decently run McDonalds. Again, please do not go here. There is a Burger King down the block with AMAZING service that I highly recommend.",McDonald’s,1.5 star rating,$,"Fast, Food,, Burgers,, Coffee, &, Tea"
3,kxF2x7q4jp1tpJTw54IPCA,Jeffrey B.,1.0 star rating,"0 stars. This McDonald's needs to be closed down. Can't get a order right. It's like whatever they get their hands on they throw in a bag. How do you mess up 2x Big Mac and a larger fríe after making me wait 15 mins ??? Or 2x McDonald's doubles with mac sauce the ticket says mac sauce and u charge me, to my surprise no mac sauce. This place is a joke. AVOID GOING HERE !!!!!",McDonald’s,1.5 star rating,$,"Fast, Food,, Burgers,, Coffee, &, Tea"

5,sWAZF3f5RBSLl2wOC7okFw,Monica R.,1.0 star rating,This location should be closed and boarded up immediately. I've given it 3 chances and each time is worse than the prior visit. My most recent and LAST trip lasted 45 MINUTES in the drive-thru. I had already paid so I was stuck. After 30 minutes They hand me bags with food spilling out of it and ask me to pull around to the third window to wait for cookies. Ten minutes later I'm handed a bag of burnt cookies that have melted into a solid lump in the corner of the bag. 3 cookies melted into mush and she literally ran away before I could say anything. There's nothing FAST about this fast food location.,McDonald’s,1.5 star rating,$,"Fast, Food,, Burgers,, Coffee, &, Tea"

7,Gd0mijdURZL2tzth-d50lQ,Dean T.,1.0 star rating,A few months ago I posted how bad this place is but kept going for Breakfast because it's most convenient. Tonight quarter to midnight. For probably the tenth time of maybe 15-20 orders. They gave me all wrong food again. The girl supposed to be taking orders was to busy talking with her friend who was video taping her acting like an idiot inside. This isn't for the manager. But the owner. Send in people to order food and see yourself. It's a investment. Why pay people to operate your business that are not working or contributing to better the business?? I'm officially done,McDonald’s,1.5 star rating,$,"Fast, Food,, Burgers,, Coffee, &, Tea"

We said okay and proceeded to order, got interrupted ""did you hear what I said? Cash only!"" We said yes... that's fine. Ordered two items and she gave us the total... we weren't even finished yet nor did she ask if that was all. Come on, this job can't be that hard.

11,1ZCDWajHzRNWQru-iCNgMw,Rosa P.,1.0 star rating,Terrible. On many occasions i get to the drive thru window and no one responds. After 2 minutes or so i just leave.  Other times the line is barely moving. Slowest drive thru ever.  I drive thru during my drive to work at night and it's always a long wait.  If you need a coffee just go to dunkin it's literally next door and actually operate like a drive thru.,McDonald’s,1.5 star rating,$,"Fast, Food,, Burgers,, Coffee, &, Tea"

This one is ridiculous!You ask for milk in your coffee,  you get cream.You pull up to the pick up window and watch 4 people hanging out while you wait for your food as they put on lip balm.I'm in the drive through again as I type this. Over ten minutes.  No food.McDonald's needs some more training for this drive thru concept in Jersey City.I did not hit submit so now it's 15 minutes since I pulled into this mcdonalds and there was just one car in front of me already ordering at the time.

13,f4qS3lLJqftnt_mEYJ2_mA,Roy A.,2.0 star rating,"Just get used to it, when you choose to order food here you are working for the dude who takes your order and flips your burger, he is not working for you.  You have to choose asap while getting drilled with would that be all and then wait so he can take your money when he feels like it but only after he gets up from his roost to choose to do so.  The only reason for getting two stars is at least the person handing us the food answered a question about the order properly while giving us the food.  Is this mc Donald or somehow it is hijacked by unfriendly space aliens   who have abducted the employees and operating this joint as a cover!",McDonald’s,1.5 star rating,$,"Fast, Food,, Burgers,, Coffee, &, Tea"

15,8Cp80RjWhbm9m9ybwK34ZA,Kathryn B.,1.0 star rating,I wish I could give this place a negative 5 stars.  The WORST customer service ever.  You stand at the window and the ring the bell for about 5 minutes before 1 of the employees comes to take your order.  Absolutely unacceptable.  People go to McDonald's for quick and convenience.  This  place is the exact opposite of it.  Truly an embarrassment to the McDonald's brand.,McDonald’s,1.5 star rating,$,"Fast, Food,, Burgers,, Coffee, &, Tea"

Then I proceed through the drive thru and see two teenage employees sitting outside, laughing about the situation. It was open, they just didn't feel like working...",McDonald’s,1.5 star rating,$,"Fast, Food,, Burgers,, Coffee, &, Tea"
