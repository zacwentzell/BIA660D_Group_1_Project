The cheese that was supposed to go on it tasted horrible, we couldn't even tell that it was cheese!

First off, Tyrone answered my emails quickly and completely. He even helped me brainstorm ideas for serving different containers of craft beer (and that wasn't even part his job!). At the party, he came early and offered to serve early, and was very accommodating when I asked for one last burger before he left! Him and his employee were both absolutely pleasant the from start to finish. Second, the food was, as one party attendee said ""HEAVENLY"". People came up to me raving about EVERY SINGLE ITEM on the menu! The bison burger, the truffle fries, the bacon burger, the mac and cheese, I mean EVERYTHING people raved about. I was especially happy to have the veggie bean burger since I am vegan (which was also amazing). I cannot wait to tell my company to use his food truck this year for our annual BBQ.

Him and his employee were both absolutely pleasant the from start to finish. Second, the food was, as one party attendee said ""HEAVENLY"". People came up to me raving about EVERY SINGLE ITEM on the menu! The bison burger, the truffle fries, the bacon burger, the mac and cheese, I mean EVERYTHING people raved about. I was especially happy to have the veggie bean burger since I am vegan (which was also amazing). I cannot wait to tell my company to use his food truck this year for our annual BBQ.

Had the regular (beef) and exotic burgers such as kangaroo, ostrich, elk, bison, and camel. Everything was good. Then we decided to try them again at their cafe location at jersey city. Parking sucks though. We had to walk a few blocks since there's no parking slot close by. Anyways, my bf and I ordered the kangaroo burger (double patty), truffle fries, wild boar empanada, and baonana pudding and it tasted phenomenal. Definitely worth the drive and hassle with parking.

I've been a fan of the food truck for years, but I usually have terrible luck in running into it in Hoboken or at events. I know it's been in the works for a long time, and I'm glad it's finally here!I've already been there several times since they opened a few months ago, and the food is always great. If you're feeling adventurous, I would recommend something from the exotic menu options because I love trying new foods and everything is so expertly prepared. But even if you're not into that, their beef burgers are on point. My personal favorite is the Lamburghini burger. They also have a veryyyyy delicious gumbo that's perfect on a cold day.It's a small place with only 2 tables and some counter seating, but the decor is pretty cool, especially the cow print booths. Lol. And on a nice day, I like to take the food to go anyway and eat in the park a couple blocks away.If I could tho, I would give them 4.5 stars because the service is a tiny bit lacking. Everyone is very friendly and the food comes out pretty quickly, but not all the employees seem to know what's going on. For example, inability to answer simple questions about the food, not knowing how to pronounce the menu items, easily overwhelmed by multiple customers or orders.

The beef used for the chipotle burger was on point and they cooked it medium as it should for most people. The Bun was soft and held the burger very well. Mac & cheese and fries were pretty good but I still prefer the french fries at corkscrew or Fox & Crow. The bad.. chipotle sauce was excessive on my burger. It was dripping off the bun onto the plate. Now The Ugly.. why did I and my wife have to wait for 2 burgers, fries and mac & cheese for 50 minutes? To me that is unacceptable. Nobody from the staff warned us before ordering that it will take this long. Seriously I heard this was a food truck before which entails you gotta be fast on the grill. I also felt bad for the guys that got their orders before us as they waited as long as we did. So please accept this criticism and teach the staff about telling customers they will have to wait  about 50 minutes for their food, in that way one can choose what to do. I have seen the mixed reviews for this spot so I guess I should give it another try in the future.Tyrone, for the record I do have the time I ordered the food and the time I actually got it in my hands. I'll leave it at that. Thank youOk Tyrone first thank you for your lengthy explanation of how this delay in my order did not happen and second no I don't criticize establishments for no apparent reason. I don't appreciate the way you picture things but anyways I'm really glad you are banning me from your great exotic meats joint. I will be honored not be served there ever again. I wish you great success with your business.By the way it was my wife who ordered the food around 7:46pm and not 18:53 and 56 seconds as you stated and she never changed the order as you recalled. Then I went in twice to check the status of the order and finally got my food Lastly please don't make up false accusations about people you don't know. Drunk or high?

Five star for their lamburghini! Please! please! call ahead to check what exotic Meats they have available before going... Yes! I was highly disappointed that they did not have the Camel, or other exotic Meats that they usually have, but because of that, I had the chance to try their lamburghini... So what intrigued me in the lamburghini is the ""tzatziki sauce"" on the Ground lamb as a burger, and they delivered holy quaqomoly big effing time!  Maybe I'm late to the party! or maybe I'm just getting excited about this combination for no good reason! Maybe!!!   The only thing that I can tell you is that I personally have never seen (yet) ""tzatziki sauce"" on a burger menu....    So the first bite in that concoction was like biting in to a whole new world of opportunity and adventure...

The camel, kangaroo, and yak burgers are solid options for a clean, filling meal. Thankfully, there's an option to turn your burger into a double for a $3 upcharge and it is worth it. Otherwise, the meal would be a bit paltry. Fries are extra ($3 for a small, $6 for a large). Opt for a large! Cajun fries are tastier than truffle fries, but that's probably a matter of opinion.Downsides: the place is small, seating meager, and, if you dine in, your clothes will smell like freshly cooked exotic meat.Upsides: Very friendly, funny, and ultimately CHILL staff. Will always accommodate requests/throw in some extra sauces if you want. That said, try the Moo sauce. Decor is lit and specials are inventive and on par. Ozztrich burger was great.

I opted for a camel burger and a kangaroo sausage. I wish the meats came in forms other than a burger or sausage, like a steak or something. I would like to taste pure exotic animal. Anyway, the camel burger was delicious, juicy, and very lean. I preferred the kangaroo sausage, which was spicy and full of flavor.I was slightly disappointed though, because I expected an extremely exotic flavor. The camel didn't taste any different than beef. I would've guessed it was a beef burger. The kangaroo had a notably different taste than common meats, which is why I preferred it. For those of you worried about the taste of strange animals, don't be.  I expected, and wanted any sort of gamey flavor.Can't discredit Tyrone though.

I know it was super busy, so its understandable they ran out of product, but they should have posted a sign and let the customers know.

This was some regular smchegular burgers.  $30 for 2 burgers and a so called ""large"" fries . So I just have a few questions:1. Why is my food delivered cold when you're only 5 blocks away?    1.a. What is the delivery fee for if you're not going to ensure the customers get a decent meal? At least warm??2. Why do you have standard size burgers but the bread is twice the size?    I took the top half of the bun and folded it in half so that it would be proportional to size of the burger .   The bread is just awful, establishments need to realize the bread is just as important as the burger and its accompaniments. Limp lettuce and soggy tomatoes is a huge no no.  I paid for a brioche bun to avoid this situation and instead i got a substandard Kaiser roll.  3. Why are the burgers delivered smashed, mushed, flattened?  None of this makes any sense to me and all of these issues are completely avoidable so:Just WHY?!*Updated response to business:*I'm not sure if this is how to respond to your comment but nonetheless I'll give it a try ; I ordered the bbq bacon cheeseburger with grass fed beef on a brioche bun via seamless at 8:17pm. I didn't know it came with lettuce and tomato, I guess that's what deluxe cheeseburger means in the description, but it was limp iceberg lettuce and soggy tomato and a whole lot of sauce.  I'm sure your burgers are made to order but their not delivered with the priority of getting them to the customer while hot... I'm literally 3 blocks away. I guess your delivery guy takes a lot of orders and stacks them on top of one another because they were smushed. The Kaiser roll was way too large for the size of the burger and with the excess sauce and not so fresh veggies it was a mess.

129,9bSaxQTQyP8XkAWVflR_UA,Steve V.,1.0 star rating,"Based on the reviews I was hoping for a great burger. There used to be an exotic meat burger joint in NYC that I frequently partroned when it was open so I was excited to have a place like Dark Side a mere 3 blocks from my home. I admit I was a bit wary of going at 8pm, an hour before closing, because you usually don't get a teams best when their mind is on leaving for the night. But, I gave it a shot...there were 2 other patrons and space at the counter so my wife and I had seat and checked out the menu. I went with a bison burger and asked what was on the burger n was told, ""Whatever you like. Lettuce, tomato. The usual stuff."" I asked for tomato, onion and cheese what I got was a burger that was soaked in an orange sauce of some sort a wedge of iceburg lettuce some grilled onions, 3 unmelted slices of cheese and pickles. Now, I don't mind a good sauce but if you are selling an Exotic Meat wouldn't that be what you would want your customers to taste? Most people I know don't order a regular burger to taste the ketchup so overloading bison or any meat for that matter with a sauce is a always a red flag for me. What are you hiding? The sauce was a deal breaker for me so I reminded my server of what I actually ordered, a bison burger with tomato, onion and cheese, and she quickly had it redone for me. The cook even asked me directly what wanted i on the burger so I figured all would be well.  He even repeated it back. When I received a burger with a tomato, NO onions, and EXTRA pickles I was bit annoyed but was so hungry at this point that I just couldn't bare to deal with ordering my burger a 3rd time so I scarfed it down quickly. The bun was soaked in a sweet and tangy sauce I believe might have been HP sauce but again it was a mystery and I couldn't actually taste anything else. So maybe I ate a bison burger...maybe I didn't. Closed out my tab n headed home thoroughly disappointed. I will try Dark Side of the Moon again just because I love small business success stories. Especially if relates to my stomach. When a food truck is so popular they make it to brick and mortar they obviously did something right that warranted that support. I want that experience on my next visit.",Dark Side of the Moo Cafe,4.5 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, Cafes,, American, (Traditional)"

The restaurant is small and has limited seating but it's worth it. The owner is tossing around the idea to have outdoor seating in the warmer months. So, if that happen it should be a go to spot for brunch and eats! The tacos and burgers are really really good! I appreciate the whole concept!

I didnt know what to expect, but it was flavorful and not at all gamey or strong in taste. The burger was covered in american yellow cheese, with caramelized onions, lettuce, thinly sliced tomato, pickle and the most delicious secret sauce out there. I could have done with crunchy onions, not the ones given and would have enjoyed it more if the insides didnt flop out on the first bite. Well, since it's a small interior we ate it at home and used our fingers so no one judged.

They're very friendly as well and the prices are also great.Please note that they just opened and are getting into a rhythm.

I'd go two stars....but again I don't know where you can get better locally. I ordered the Elk and Kangaroo Sliders.My girlfriend ordered the wild boar and bison sliders. While game is their (ahem) game let me start with the fry's. We ordered a side of fries since it was ""Fry day"" (on Fridays you get a side of fry's for $1 with your order). They were soaked in the oil they were cooked in. This made the fries kinda gross and repeat on you several hours later...however, they were seasoned and the DSOTM ""special sauce"" (which was described as ""it's pretty much Big Mac Sauce"" to the people in front of us) actually made them tolerable. Aside from the bison and boar none of the meats were very distinguishable. The Bison tasted like ground beef. The kangaroo and elk tasted like gamey ground beef. While the the boar was just gamey. None of them were bad as they were all seemingly cooked properly....just none of them were great. None of the patties (at least I'd be surprised if) are over 2 oz of meat. As such, at $9 for two slider this is a rip. Yes, it's ""game."" I get it.....but I don't. Not sure what else to write. Despite the rave reviews this cart is nothing special....unless you want to pay premium dollar for exotic ""albeit indistinguishable"" meat.",Dark Side of the Moo Cafe,4.5 star rating,$$,"Burgers,, Cafes,, American, (Traditional)"

Like the Knight Rider ""one man can make a difference."" Dark Side of the Moo is that difference. The eccentric owner and Hoboken resident even has a ""sexy sausage night.""I know the Taco Truck ran into problems with their truck in Hoboken. So much politics involved.  I always wondered is that why they opened up an actual store? Dark side of the Moo has a trailer with no motor, but since it needs a license plate, it cannot be on the sidewalk. That being said, it has to be parked and parking in Hoboken is defiantly a scene from parking wars.  So, they're always on the move. However, you can find them via most social media.  I encountered the truck in front of Cork city, across from Sri Thai. Love the fact it's in my 'hood I had the cheeseburger. The meat was cooked perfectly very juicy and organic. It tasted like a piece of heaven. Very plentiful and for a mere $4.00 there are other options. There is rabbit, boar also the Lamb Merguez sausage... I have not tried these but my next venture I defiantly will. If this uber burger is indication of what is to come.
