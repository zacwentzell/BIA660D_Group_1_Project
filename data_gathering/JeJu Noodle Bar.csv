Wagyu galbi bossamThe beef wraps - I'm speechless. It's so good that I couldn't find a right word to describe the sensation. The beef was cooked to med-rare. Its fresh and tasty. the lettuce, radish, white kimchi, perilla leaves and seeded jalapeño had created the crispy texture and lightness. The wrap is very good by it self but if you added this dipping sauce that comes with it, it will bring the experience to a higher level. I didn't dip it, it's a bean paste like kind of sauce so I spread it on the beef instead. Seriously it's so good. It's a daily special so it's not on the menu but I suggest they make it a regular item. Gochu ramyun The spicy pork noodle soup was good. A lot of noodle and the soup is very rich/creamy and flavorful. The white kimchi topping helps to cut down the richness of the soup. The porks are tender. The spicy level was perfect for me, I feel the heat and also taste the food!I definitely will go back to try other noodle soup, especially the So-ramyun.

3,CymzzNZC1qq5Mw2c0J6Xrg,Caroline L.,5.0 star rating,"T.H. and I stopped in expecting a lunch of ramen and left with a belly full of well done Korean brunch. We had rescheduled a reservation from dinner to lunch thanks to some food poisoning a few days before and didn't regret it. The nine course brunch is 45 dollars a person but well worth it if you enjoy solidly good Korean food. We started off with a winter salad which was salty and a little sweet as you would expect with some hints of miso dressing. Then, the dishes started to flow... perhaps they realized that we were big eaters? Perhaps the dishes all finished at once and they wanted to serve them ASAP? Either way, we went from one dish to many on our table. Steamed egg with roe and oysters were a delicious twist. Warning to those who haven't had Korean oysters, they tend to be more pungent but still have that nice brine. Next up? Tuna tartare and pork bossam. The pork was super delicious and warm, like most pork bossam it was soft and delicious with a faint whiff of bacon. So. Good. The tuna tartar was also done quite well with some avocado and some roe to add in an extra texture and a little bit of brine. After this, we had a little palate cleanser with the broccoli salad. It was a perfect little bit before the ginormous chunks of fried chicken. The tuna (lean split with toro) kimbbap was an amazing with the bite of radish wrapped around the tunas to keep them intact. The fried chicken was delicious, fresh, and hot, but not super notable as far as fried chicken goes. The finishing dish was the bibim ramen with a perfectly poached egg, lettuce, radish, green onions and some other toppings i cant quite remember which was delicious but spicy. Full five stars for a great meal that was extra delicious and a surprise for brunch.",JeJu Noodle Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Korean,, Noodles"

5,MChIIjb0nzgF1WRgmTWStQ,Manna C.,4.0 star rating,"I really wanted to try this place. I tried to walk in on a Tuesday night at 9PM before but it was a 45 minute wait. This time I made a reservation on Resy because I didn't want to wait. And it was the perfect night for a bowl of noodles since it was so cold outside. Unfortunately though, I still ended up waiting for my friend but they have a small waiting area near the door. It still took a while to get seated even when my friend arrived. Still confused why it took so long since there was no one sitting there and there's no need to prepare utensils since they're already at the table.It is a relatively small menu with ten appetizers, four ramyuns and a selection of wines and beers. I ended up ordering the Gochu Ramyun, which is a spicy pork broth with pork belly, white kimchi and wood ears. I also added the bansuk egg (+$2). The ramyun had levels of complexity, with the broth having an intense, deep spicy and sweet flavor, combined with the fattiness of the seared pork belly, but balanced by the sourness and crunchiness of the kimchi that cut through the oil. The bansuk egg (soft boiled egg) was extremely flavorful and not overcooked. I'm not sure if I would add the egg again but I am glad I tried it. In addition, I ordered the Kolsch beer (both draft beers are German). It came in a very interesting cup - it felt as if I should be drinking a latte from the cup. There was a good amount of foam but it was a very light and refreshing beer. TLDR gochu ramyun is amazing, would definitely return.",JeJu Noodle Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Korean,, Noodles"

8,8cMEep52e4PNqUkaDfx7tQ,Jessica D.,3.0 star rating,"I came here with my fiance for a friend's birthday dinner last November. First, not too amused when I saw that they had a very limited menu. I thought the decor and atmosphere was nice, mellow, and dimly lighted. The type of music that was played didn't really fit in with the atmosphere. I personally would have preferred like jazz music.  Due to the size of this restaurant, I wouldn't really recommend having a large group dinner here since it seemed like they didn't have any tables that would fit more than 6-8 people. We had quite a few appetizers. The first one was B&B Edamame which is steamed black Edamame with black chili garlic sauce. These were actually pretty good and tasty, had a little spice to it. We also tried their SSAM Buns - braised pork belly, white kimchi, corn, jalapeno, and SSAM sauce. I thought these buns were just okay, nothing too special.  Our friend also ordered the Soondubu which was very tiny compared to the ones I usually get at BCD Tofu (so so so much better by the way). The last appetizer we had was the Jeju Chicken Wings. I normally don't eat chicken wings, but made an exception this time and it actually wasn't so bad.Most of their entrees on their menu are ramen and there were ONLY four. I got the Fish Coop - bonito chicken broth, confit chicken, cucumber, pork belly, jalapeno and jeju herb oil with a boiled egg. I wasn't too impressed by this because it didn't feel like a harmonious bowl of ramen. The bonito bowl was quite salty and I didn't want a cooked cucumber in my dish. My fiance had the SO-Ramyun which was veal broth, brisket, scallion, pickled garlic and garlic oil.  My fiance's ramen was a lot smaller than mine. Anyway, I'm not a big fan of veal broth or veal in general, but I thought his ramen was much tastier and delicious than mine. It had good flavor.Overall, my fiance and i thought the food here was mediocre. It's definitely a little pricey in my opinion.

The broth in their Ramyun competes with the best of all the ramens, curries, and noodle soups for the soul. I favor the So-Ramyun because of its creamy veal broth, garlic fixins, and thin cut slices of brisket. Not to be outdone, the Gochu Ramyun's spicy pork broth & thicc pork belly slices are also blessings from the divine. Adding a perfect soy marinated soft boiled egg to your wavy noodles is a must.I advise trying to snag a reservation or you may be waiting for 1.5+ hours on busy nights.

I highly highly highly highly HIGHLY recommend going to this spot next time you have a hankering for ramen!Basically, they take high quality ingredients with traditional Korean flavors and combine them with high quality ramen noodles to basically create an elevated ramyeon that's way better than anything you'll find in a pojang macha or boonsik jip.The chef hails from a fine dining background (Per Se) and everything we tried so far has been fantastic. Highly recommend the soon tofu (soft tofu soup), the beef ramyeon, and the gochujang ramyeon, but I'm sure everything else is equally delicious.The beef ramen was my personal favorite, as it had the richness of the best tonkotsu but with a deeply beefy and garlic-y flavor and came topped with some super tender beef. Simultaneously one of the best ramen and seollongtang I've ever had. The gochujang ramen was amazing as well, not too spicy, not too sweet, not too salty.

We were just finishing our dinner when it finally started to somewhat clear out. It's a decent sized space but they were genius with the idea of having every table expand. They all had drop leaf extenders.More importantly ... the food.Cucumber kimchi: tasty, love the shiso in it. But a little expensive for $7, small portion.Ssam bun: eh they were okay. I've had better. Not a fan of the corn in it. They do accommodate the party so we were able to get 3 pieces for the 3 of us. $10/per order, comes with 2 .... decent price, each bun is pretty big.Jeju chicken wings: sooooooooooooooo goooooooodddddd!!! Loved it! One order came with 6 wings for $12 def worth it. So ramyun: ughhh winter cravings so satisfied. Tasted like a mix of sullung tang and ramyun. Noodles were so good and perfectly al dente and the heavy broth coated the noodles giving you a burst of flavor goodness. Yea it's a bit pricey for noodle BUT the portion is huge! Doesn't seem like it because of appearance of the bowl it comes in but I couldn't finish it. Although we had quite a bit of starters.Ambience is great, drink selection is limited, noodles are delish, service is impeccable (comped first round of drinks bc we had to wait a bit even w a reso).

My friends and I came for dinner and were not wowed by our ramyun. I'm a noodle-crazed gal, but I was so underwhelmed by my $20+ bowl of ramyun (including tip, tax). I ordered the Fish Coop broth which had a light, healthy aura to it with its chicken broth. But it was pretty boring and I was not at all a fan of the pickles in my soup. I get that it's supposed to be fusion, but the pickles gave the soup an understandably sour hint that just clashed with what you would expect from a hearty bowl of ramyun. Portion sizes were decent/on the small side, and the only slightly winning grace was the soft-boiled egg ($2) that wasn't even that amazing.

My favorite is the So-Ramyun, but the Miyuk is also excellently flavorful and refreshing.The apps are very good, especially the Soon DuBu, which is probably the most umami-rich version i've ever had.

The broth in their Ramyun competes with the best of all the ramens, curries, and noodle soups for the soul. I favor the So-Ramyun because of its creamy veal broth, garlic fixins, and thin cut slices of brisket. Not to be outdone, the Gochu Ramyun's spicy pork broth & thicc pork belly slices are also blessings from the divine.

I highly highly highly highly HIGHLY recommend going to this spot next time you have a hankering for ramen!Basically, they take high quality ingredients with traditional Korean flavors and combine them with high quality ramen noodles to basically create an elevated ramyeon that's way better than anything you'll find in a pojang macha or boonsik jip.The chef hails from a fine dining background (Per Se) and everything we tried so far has been fantastic. Highly recommend the soon tofu (soft tofu soup), the beef ramyeon, and the gochujang ramyeon, but I'm sure everything else is equally delicious.The beef ramen was my personal favorite, as it had the richness of the best tonkotsu but with a deeply beefy and garlic-y flavor and came topped with some super tender beef. Simultaneously one of the best ramen and seollongtang I've ever had. The gochujang ramen was amazing as well, not too spicy, not too sweet, not too salty.

Not a fan of the corn in it. They do accommodate the party so we were able to get 3 pieces for the 3 of us. $10/per order, comes with 2 .... decent price, each bun is pretty big.Jeju chicken wings: sooooooooooooooo goooooooodddddd!!! Loved it! One order came with 6 wings for $12 def worth it. So ramyun: ughhh winter cravings so satisfied. Tasted like a mix of sullung tang and ramyun. Noodles were so good and perfectly al dente and the heavy broth coated the noodles giving you a burst of flavor goodness. Yea it's a bit pricey for noodle BUT the portion is huge! Doesn't seem like it because of appearance of the bowl it comes in but I couldn't finish it.

I ordered the Fish Coop broth which had a light, healthy aura to it with its chicken broth. But it was pretty boring and I was not at all a fan of the pickles in my soup. I get that it's supposed to be fusion, but the pickles gave the soup an understandably sour hint that just clashed with what you would expect from a hearty bowl of ramyun.

Also, the chef at Jeju, Douglas Kim, is renown. He's worked at Chef's Table, Nobu, Morimoto, Zuma, Gordan Ramsay, and Per Se. You'll know the food will be consistently precise and of quality. You'll notice immediately that the decor is simple and classy. It fits right in with the west village neighborhood. The restaurant is different than your typical place. You don't have one specific server per table - there are a slew of friendly servers that quickly tend to you and the service is fast. It's more fun this way.We started off with the tuna yuk-hwae and the ssam buns. Everything on this menu is definitely Korean-inspired. It's not your traditional ramen and it's interesting. The yuk-hwae was very fresh and had Korean spices in it, which I'm always a fan of. The ssam buns weren't anything like the ones from Baohaus - it has corn on it and it's creamy. The sauce is perfect. We ordered two gochu ramens. There are only 3 choices of ramen, and truthfully, the rest of the menu is simple which is incredibly nice. You know the restaurant specializes in the items they offer especially if it's a small ramen. The ramen was creamy, and had a great flavor especially with the soft boiled egg added on it. The gochujang flavor was strong, and the kimchi was almost smokey.

The seaweed broth is definitely reminiscent of what my mother used to make whenever I was ill--in a sense, making dashima broth is art in itself, and I don't think many people realize this.

Jeju ramyun is a firm category B: the broths were hearty, thick and rich. The chef has quite the resume, and I think it really shows. The food quality of excellent, the flavors are really well-developed, there's a lot going on in just one bowl of noodles. Start with Ssam buns, which are memorably good. The pork belly has a crisp sear that's delightful to crunch through to get to the tender meat, the generous slathering of sauce is slightly sweet and spicy, and pops of sweet corn and jalapeno are the perfect touches to cut through the richness. If you're trying to stave off a cold, the So Ramyun is the way to go. The broth is milky like a seolleongtang, and probably packed with immune-boosting nutrients from the bone. The beef is amazing, so tender! And you get 2 types. If you like a little spice, go for the GoChu ramyun. This bowl has a lot of stuff going on, from the spicy broth to the different pickled vegetables, to the pork belly. The more you dig, the more treasure you find. The noodles were also perfect, on the thin side, and maintained their bounciness even after 30 min of slurping. And don't forget to add an egg! A softboiled egg always makes things better.

Menu is quite simple with hot/cold apps and three types of ramyun. Interesting fact: no servers, but the food is brought to the table by the cook! *Chicken Wing: Comes with six pieces, crispy skin and well cooked. Seasoning was your typical chicken wing plus more korean spice. It's not the soy-garlic or honey mustard sauce, just for reference.*So Ramyun: comes in a cute stone pot, veal broth with combination of rare and medium rare thin beef slices and bean sprouts. Noodles were cooked through, kinda wish they were al dente so they can cook with the residual heat from the broth. Broth was memorable. Kind of reminds of me Korean soulungtang because it is very hearty and flavorful. This was my fav of the night.*Gochu Ramyun: don't be alarmed, its not pepper broth and it's not super spicy either. Broth was okay on this one, based on the broth, I recommend the so ramyun over the gochu ramyun. The torched pork belly was very good. Outside was crispy and inside was soft and tender. Recommend if you are in the mood for good classic ramyun with delicious pork belly. Interior is truly beautiful. I love the open layout and the kitchen merges with the bar.

There were a few things I noticed that were different from previous reviews, so maybe they do adjust based on the feedback.-they do take reservations, and when we got there around 5:20 there were a few other groups there already-service was friendly and seemed genuine though nothing exceptional. Two different staff members checked on us during our meal (once immediately after we got our food to make sure the heat level was ok), and our water pitcher was quickly refilled when it was empty-there wasn't any tip weirdness - the slip I received to sign just had the cost plus tax, and there weren't any percentages to circleThey don't take cash - card only.My friend and I came for an early dinner and sat at the bar, where there were outlets (!) and hooks for hanging bags/coats. I ordered the gochu ramyun and my friend got the fish coop, $16 each which I feel is very standard. The ramyun didn't take long to come out but while we were waiting I noticed that there was a wifi network called something like ""Jeju noodle bar guest"" which I thought was surprising - I didn't ask for the password though.I really liked the first few bites of my gochu ramyun - it wasn't too spicy but instead more sweet. I liked the slightly crunchy pickled cabbage and the bean sprouts, and I was also pleasantly surprised to find wood ear! The two pieces of pork belly were extremely fatty but the edges of the meat were charred and slightly crunchy, which I liked. The noodles could have been firmer, but they were fine. The broth was quite heavy and oily, and I couldn't drink more than a sip of it; after a while the dish felt sort of too heavy and monotonous. It was still good, just not so easy to eat a lot of.My friend really didn't like his fish coop; he said the broth was way too salty and that he wouldn't have been able to tell that there was fish in it if this weren't stated on the menu. I tried a bit and I agreed - I recently went to a Japanese ramen place and had a clear bonito and chicken based broth that I felt was way too fishy, but with this dish I couldn't detect fish at all, just salt. He also had one piece of pork belly and several pieces of really tough chicken. The pickled cucumbers slices were nice and slightly crunchy, but the jalapeño wasn't spicy at all; I had to double check the menu before writing this to make sure it was jalapeño... The main issue was just the salt - he felt dizzy and uncomfortable for a while after eating.The restaurant interior is really beautiful and modern looking; I really like the lamp/chandelier construction, and the space just looks clean and open. The kitchen across from the bar seats has some really nice looking knives and a nice rice cooker, and the sinks even look beautiful. There's one bathroom that had some nice drum music playing (though no music in the restaurant itself).Overall my experience was positive neutral, but my friend's seemed very uncomfortable.

Perfect cold weather food, JeJu Noodle Bar should be on your radar. Particularly their JeJu Ramyun. Thin, slightly al dente noodles swimming in a thick, spicy, creamy pork broth alongside pork belly, kimchi, and an added bansuk egg for good measure. It's a hearty meal, so take my advice and skip the apps unless you're very hungry. I was encouraged to try their pork belly ssam buns to start, and while they were fine (I could live without the corn kernels), it was way too much food for a solo diner. A unique element to dining at JeJu is that the cooks are the ones taking your order, then sauntering to the kitchen to prepare your feast. Aside from the host guiding you to your table, you're in the hands of the same person throughout the various stages of your meal. I'm not sure this is something New York ever wanted or needed, but an interesting concept nonetheless.If you're a ramen fan - specifically a tonkotsu ramen fan - and have yet to try Korean ramyun before, I'd be willing to bet you'll like what they're doing here on the west side.",JeJu Noodle Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Korean,, Noodles"

55,1sxXLUKn6qCCVRJPhRNVYQ,Ken S.,4.0 star rating,"KenScale: 8.0/10New York City is already saturated with ramen shops and how can you not like a bowl with deep-flavored broth and noodles, especially in the cold winter? As a person with Korean background, I have always envied the masterful craftsmanship and dedication that Japanese people put into ramen-making. Yes, there is a variety of ramen called ""ramyun"" in Korea too but they are more popular as instant noodle types where you put boiled water onto a brick of fried noodle that has already been processed. I used to love those when I was in school, after having way too many after my guard duty during my time at the Korean military, I decided to shy away from them entirely. When I recently heard of a ramyun shop that was opened by a Korean chef who spent his time at some of the best fine-dining restaurants in NYC, I was therefore quite curious as to what JeJu can bring to the table. Can chef Douglas Kim present a compelling alternative to the ramen stronghold based on the flavor of Korea? After our meal, my wife Jun and I concluded that JeJu has potentials.Before you go for the ramen, there is a concise menu of appetizers that you can choose from. The amberjack salad with spicy ""yang yum jang"" sauce was good but the sauce was a little bit more citrusy than spicy for us. On the other hand, we liked the idea of having corn in the pork belly buns and finished them in a couple of bites. Now on to the main part. I ordered gochu (""pepper"" in Korean) ramyun based on spicy pork broth with pork belly and white kimchi, while Jun ordered so (""cow"" in Korean) ramyun based on veal broth with ""soo yuk"" brisket and scallion. The gochu ramyun was delicious, with its firm noodle and spicy broth that I can tell was prepared for a long time to add depth. I didn't, however, understand what the rather citrusy white kimchi was supposed to do; instead of enhancing the broth, it was a distraction. Jun's so ramyun was more memorable for both of us, other than the fact that there wasn't really any brisket instead (Jun totally felt cheated while she was picking through the noodles to look for those meats). The veal broth was clean and soothing just like the way we would normally expect from a very well-made Korean gomtang (a popular beef bone soup). After finishing my gochu ramyun, I went on to finish the rest of the broth that Jun hadn't finished! Getting a reservation wasn't too difficult but the space (with typical trendy décor you see at a casual café) fills up pretty quickly with curious diners (a good mix of Asian and non-Asian) so try to avoid prime times if you don't have a reservation in advance. I was somewhat miffed that the beverage selection was rather weak. Interestingly, the cooks are also providing services as waiters (so they get to collect tips); despite concerns about hiccups in services initially, our cook / waiter was adequate. JeJu is not perfect, but I appreciate the novel experiment that chef Kim has put out to the world. I would love to see how his re-interpretation of this favorite Korean instant food (according to NYTimes restaurant critic Pete Wells, the domestic demand for ramyun in Korea reached over 1.1 billion pounds!) evolves over time.",JeJu Noodle Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Korean,, Noodles"

It satisfies a craving, but I frankly prefer other ramen shops in town. It's savory and hits all the right notes, but is way overly salty. The broth was creamy, the noodles were meh and didn't have enough bite to it. I also found that it was very warm but not piping hot, which annoyed me a little. Beautiful restaurant space. I appreciate that you're not crammed in, elbow to elbow, like you are in most ramen spots. PS - if you're vegetarian or pescetarian, this will be a difficult restaurant for you. Check the menu before you! My friend was pescetarian and could only order a limited number of appetizers.",JeJu Noodle Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Korean,, Noodles"

We started off with the chicken wings, and it was super crispy; delicious with the drizzle of the lime over it. Apparently there is a difference between Japanese ""ramen"" and Korean ""ramyun"". They claim to have removed most of the fat from the broth so to maintain the flavor but minus the heaviness. I really like the broth of the SoRamyun - veal broth, it really did feel light but you can distinctly taste the meat. I got the GoChu Ramyun which was spicy pork broth, did not taste very spicy at all...but the two slices of pork were nice and fatty and the noodles cooked very nicely and generous portion. Overall excellent service; the waiters are the chefs so they are very knowledgable about the difference among the choices and what to recommended in terms of the type of egg to add to it. The marinated egg was VERY VERY GOOD. it is $2.00 extra and I was a little disappointed they forgot mine (I ate half my boyfriend's) although they still charged me for it...but they were too busy so we just ended up paying for it. Good to try; not sure if its worthy of a second visit - maybe if they expand their menu a little or changed it out, I am interested in the concept of ramyun and the combination of flavors slightly different from that of the Japanese ramen.",JeJu Noodle Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Korean,, Noodles"

Atmosphere is more on the modern side but will give a warm welcome feeling as you walk in.  Having been there so many time I'm finally writing this review! All the ramyuns are very original inspired by Korean stews. Just taste absolutely lovely. My favorite is the So-ramyun. Kind of reminds me of warm ox tail soup. Once you eat it, it takes a form of a fluffy futon and wraps around you to keep you warm from the cold. Fish Co-op would be my runner up with clear broth lots of herbs and having also a delicious piece of pork belly right in the middle. I always add the bansuk egg. Makes everything even better. Their new addition Minyuk? The vegetarian option was absolutely amazing. Refreshing ramyun would probably best description I can give. You can add Uni and up the flavor because ...uni is delicious and I'd put that in everything if I can.The Elderflower Lemonade is amazing. I personally don't like drinks with too much fizz, this has just enough to excite you and its not a overly sugared drink. Goes well with the soups if you don't want to pair with wine. Very refreshing!Oh! The Toro Ssam Bap. I think they recently made it on available on the menu. But before it was a hidden thing they only had a few time a week. So many layers of flavor,use the nori as a ssam. And nomnomnom away. Definitely need to trySERVICE. May I just say. Super attentive. All the servers are cooks as well. They do really well compared to come servers that don't even do their jobs well. My water was never under a quarter full. If I needed anything, anyone of the cute guys in blue aprons would help me.  Their manager is also very hands on with helping with is amazing.

The tuna was a huge letdown, as we expected more for the price, but the wings held their own in terms of quality. By no means were they the best I've ever had, but the skin was crispy and had a slight kick to it, while the meat inside was still extremely juicy.For the main course, we ordered two bowls of the Gochu Ramyun and one bowl of the Fish Coop.  All of us opted for the egg as well.The Gochu Ramyun wasn't as spicy as expected, but I suppose it caters to a wider audience than if it were sweat-inducing. The broth was decent - not thick or too salty to the point where you couldn't drink it all after finishing the noodles, but at the same time, not something you particularly would want to do. The broth for the Fish Coop was far more complex with a wide array of tastes, though from other reviews, it seems like this may be a hit or miss, depending on how much salt the chef feels like putting in that day.While the appetizers came out fairly quickly, we had to wait quite a bit (close to an hour) for our main entrees to come out, which was ultimately disappointing, given how long we were sitting in the restaurant. Regardless, I can't fault the service, as they were all extremely kind, and I would definitely go again in the future - just skipping the appetizers.Definitely get reservations before you go as it does get busy into the night.",JeJu Noodle Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Korean,, Noodles"

Two rows of 2-seater tables line a narrow space to one side of the restaurant. Besides our chairs being back-to-back with the diners behind us, servers and diners needed to accommodate each other walking through the one-person-wide walkway between the tables. Our server had to apologize three times as he moved to accommodate walkers while trying to take our order. Yet, this placement of the tables were not due to lack of space; there is plenty of room on the other side of the restaurant, including a large round high table whose purpose I could not determine. I guess it allows people to wait around it, but they don't offer drinks before you're seated so not sure why people would need to stand around the table, awkwardly watching people eat. There was no wait, the restaurant was half empty most of the time we were there. The hip-hop/pop music in the dining area was too loud. The bathroom was very warm (okay, I'm nit-picking), but also had odd music different from that playing in the dining area. The vibe in the dining area is modern with wood and metal accents, but it seems like they skipped over the bathroom in the renovations. The heavy sliding latch for the bathroom door was rickety and could benefit from better engineering. While the servers were courteous, our noodles were rushed to our table while we were only half-way through our appetizers. The apps demonstrated more Korean-influence than the noodles, which seem more westernized/Americanized. The Gochu Ramyun lacked spice while the So-Ramyun lacked variety in flavor and textures. Cucumber kimchi paired really well with the heavy, heavy So-Ramyun, and I'd recommend that some comes as a side to the dish.

Their chicken wings are fantastic too (shichimi & umami batter with cool and spicy dipping sauce). Korean ramyun made by a skilled chef. This place was amazing!Went in at 5 this past Sunday. We had their wings, so ramyun (sul lung tang based) and spicy pork ramyun. Both fantastic!! Beef for something creamy but somewhat light that came with high quality raw tender beef that cooks in the broth (think shabu shabu for the beef). Spicy pork if you want to indulge in tonkotsu Korean miso with kimchi and a giant piece of perfectly seared pork belly. With any of their ramyun make sure to get the half boiled egg! Both ramyun soups are complex and interesting. More so the spicy pork. I drank both soups till the last drop and we crave it still.I'd say it's on par with ramen in Wakayama which is my current favorite in all of Japan after having traveled around for food there on three different trips. Similar to ideas I've been having a few years ago when I've wondered what my restaurant would be like if I'd ever open one (I'm a big fan of keeping the soul and integrity when mixing cultures and ideas, otherwise you get soulless fusion food). Noticed a small few didn't like it. To each their own I suppose but from the looks of it I don't think they understand ramen that well (or perhaps Korean food).

77,x9e5VGYK9oZ-FtQDLAkXpQ,Lu H.,3.0 star rating,"I was excited to try this place given the Eater article. Now I'm wondering if they paid big bucks to have the article published. We came here on the opening night. No reservations (at least per their website). We arrived about 15min after 5pm and were seated right away. We ordered the chicken wings, pork belly bun, and go-chu ramyun and so-ramyun. Chicken wings were very juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. It was lightly seasoned but accompanied with some sauce that tasted like a mix of siracha and mayo, in a good way. I also like they give you some pickled radish on the side, which usually accompanies Korean traditional fried chicken. Pork belly bun is unique, it's not as sweet as other pork belly buns I've had, and they put pickled cabbage that added acidity and jalapeno that added a nice crunch. The ramen took forever to arrive (20+ minutes). I expected a  ""your noodles would be out shortly"" but none of that either. When the dishes did arrive, my go-chu ramyun was reasonably spicy but also on the sweeter side. Noodles were cooked well, but could be a little more al dante - personal preference. Think sweet kimchi/crunch and pork, good but not great. My husband's So-ramyun tasted like half traditional sullangtang (A korean soup) and half ramen. Broth was too salty and lacking depth, it got really one-noted after several sips. The meat in his ramen came out raw but cooked too fast that after 4 or 5min in the broth, it became way too tough. Then came another service hiccup- we ordered gochujang bokum to go with ramen, and it never came till we asked about it in the end. When we did, our server brought it out in under 1min, claiming it just got ready. Shouldn't the dish that's supposed to ""go with"" ramen (their catchy menu states so) come out at the same time as the ramen? I think they just forgot... In summary, the positives: crisp, juicy, well made chicken wings and pork belly bun that offered something new. The ehhh: mediocre, small portioned ramen. The bad: service that you wouldn't expect from an acclaimed chef where you pay a premium. Would have been helpful if service was more attentive - ie. genuinely ask how things taste, ask if you need anything else, ask if you'd like another drink... that sort of thing. I think I'm just going to stop going to places on opening days... but shouldn't opening day be the ONE day you over-compensate and over-prepare to wow people? A side note: the restaurant is cash-less, so credit or debit card only. Another nice little trick (in addition to being overpriced in the first place) they do with the bill is have you circle a tip amount: 15%, 18%, 20% at the bottom of check. But when they run your card and give you your copy to sign, the total already included a built-in tip/service charge. Just a heads up to avoid doubling down on your tip. If you'd like to go above and beyond, circle the %s, but in our case, I wish I could deduct something from the built-in service charge.

Pork Belly Buns: Needs no review - it's def a safe choice and will be enjoyed by anyone. Hwe Dup Bap: Was spot-on fresh and refreshing to the palate and appetite, AND pleasing to the eye (instagrammable colors please see photo). I was quite impressed by the flavor and texture combinations - will totally do it again. I think I miss it already.Soon Doo Bu: Silky smooth soft tofu. Traditionally, with the exception of non-spicy, ""white"" soondooboo jigae, the stew can easily get overly spicy and become sort of a ""melting pot,"" but Jeju prepared it with a perfect balance of integration and division of the ingredients. If you're a fan of tofu, you'll appreciate it very much.The main dish. So Ramyun: I think this dish sets an excellent example of a clear distinction between the K-ramyun and the J-ramen. It's a clever twist of the Korean Sullungtang, the ultimate Korean comfort food, and the very casual and approachable ramyun. The broth introduces a very subtle, yet pleasant flavor, and does not overwhelm your mouth with a lingering feeling of sodium and fat residue (if that makes any sense). The soy sauce egg was perfectly cooked and a very good complement to the dish. The noodles, needless to say, were cooked rightly al dente.

Ditzy girl at the desk spent the next hour stepping on my coat and bumping my chair. Aside from that annoyance, it would be impossible to neglect to mention that this is the loudest restaurant we have ever been to. I mean EVER. So loud, we were screaming into each other's ear to hear each other. The IKEA interior design has backfired and created a huge reflective megaphone sound in there. The layout, with comical standing table in the middle of the room, which encourages waiting guests to peer angrily & enviously at those already dining, sits in front of a long bar that they should get rid of to accommodate proper seating. And the crowd came directly from NJ via the path train, so consider this a 'bridge & tunnel' experience, not suitable for locals. Finally, the food was ok. Just ok. Ramen Thukpa is far better, sorry. The place was so annoying, the food came last in this review, which is a shame, and revealing.",JeJu Noodle Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Korean,, Noodles"

We ordered the fried chicken and the HDB, both of which were quite nice--the chicken was lightly breaded and juicy and flavorful (and balanced by the pickles and vegetables), while the HDB was more chirashi than anything else but was light and refreshing. The ramens were both tasty--I preferred the pork belly ramen, which was not too spicy but had nice flavorful and change of texture, while the beef brisket was in a delicate soup that my friend enjoyed.It's a pretty pricey meal without a full alcohol menu, but it's still a nice vibe with tasty food.",JeJu Noodle Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Korean,, Noodles"
88,9FhAEdFQCUsv80Tfylh-1g,Connie C.,3.0 star rating,"Been wanting to try this place since it opened. Read a lot of reviews and heard various things about the establishment. The restaurant itself is a decent size (compared to most Japanese noodle spots) and the interior is warm. I like the atmosphere of the place but it can get pretty crowded. I was initially considering giving this place only 2 stars but I gave it an extra star because of the interior AND because they actually take reservations (unlike most ramen spots). Service was good - our server may have been new (or not good at his job). He forgot what we ordered and came back to our table to ask for our order again. He also forgot to bring an egg for our ramen so we had to ask the manager (who was super attentive). My friend and I ordered the following: Ssam Buns (3 stars): different take on ssam buns; it was creamier and it had CORN (I love corn). The skin of the meat wasn't crispy at all but the bun was fluffy. I think the cream sauce lacked flavor. The corn, however, was a great addition - helped to add texture. Kochujang Bokkeum Bap (3.5 stars): tasted like Korean spicy bulgogi on top of rice with a hint of sesame oil. one of the better dishes on the menuTuna YukHwae (2 stars): being Korean-American, when I see yukhwae on the menu, I'm going to imagine that it's the tuna version of the beef tartare that you'd find in any outdoor market in Seoul but really, this dish is  more like tuna sashimi decorated with dried seaweed and pickled radish. Nice try there. So Ramyun (1 star): if you're main attraction is ramen then it should be the most delicious dish on the menu but here at Jeju, it's not. The broth has a beef bone base so for many Koreans it'll remind them of what we call Sulluntang (which is ox bone soup). Sullungtang is one of my favorites but this place Americanized it and the broth was too salty. We had to pour half a glass of water in the bowl to dilute it. The noodles were your normal Japanese noodles and there wasn't much meat either. I had maybe 5 bites before my taste buds were over it. Very disappointing.Overall, I wouldn't come back for the ramen. I would perhaps come back for some of the apps but what's the point in trekking to west village just for apps? I'm glad I got to try it though - if you're still curious to check it out, definitely check it out.",JeJu Noodle Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Korean,, Noodles"

Speaking of which, I forgot to order their cucumber kimchi, ugh.  Between the So and Gochu Ramen, I'd probably choose the former, though both are good. Gochu definitely was more complex. First slurp made me go, ""wow, that's good"" whereas the So you say something like, ""that's really elegant"". Halfway, you tend to stop and take a break. It was really filling. Somewhere on the salty side, but in the good way.  The poached egg was exquisite! Ah, I think that was the best ingredient. While the Soon Du Bu beats the ramyuns.

When I saw this place noted on Gothamist, I was intrigued and decided to check this place out. How often do you see korean ramyun in New York? Um... Never...We started with the tuna- it was nice big chunks of tuna, not the minced up stuff we usually have. Well seasoned and nice size to start with.Pork buns- NOMMY!!! It has a nice corn claw on it that is really refreshing to cut the heaviness of the pork. *** husband loved the bun- not soggy at all, which happens sometimes with other places.On to the main course- the So-Ramyun: GET THIS. I was torn between this one and the Fish-Chicken one. But so happy I picked this one. It's rich and creamy and perfect with the perfectly cooked ramyun- chewy, not soggy, and not too thin or thick (just right).Husband got the spicy raymun. I tasted it, and boy did it have a kick. Same raymun, so obviously I liked that. He said that he would get it again. **** eggs- the poached egg was so cool. Never seen a poached egg in an egg shell (soft boil?) but it was so cool. Cracked it over a dish and let it drain for a sec before sliding it into the raymun. Bansuk Egg- wanted to take some home with me to snack on... SO GOOD. Really great with raymun (and by itself...)I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner date at this new spot. I liked that the service was attentive, but not intrusive. I'm a huge stickler on that because if the server comes all the time to check in, it's annoying, but if I feel ignored I tend to rage... In addition to our server, Gabriel (I think that was his name), the chef and manager came to check on us. Even though I live on the Upper West Side, I can definitely see myself bringing friends and having more deelishous raymun at this spot, especially since the weather has been starting to dip down a little.*** next to try is the Fish-Chicken Raymun...

The pork belly cuts were more meaty rather than fatty, meaning they were unexpectedly light and tasty.For mains, we ordered the So ramyun and the gochu ramyun. Both were pretty hearty bowls of noodle soup, cooked in a rich bone broth.  Gochu tasted more classically Korean with a red pepper paste spicy kick, and was the clear winner.For faster seating, would recommend making a reservation ahead of time--we didn't have trouble getting same day reservations on the weekend.",JeJu Noodle Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Korean,, Noodles"

With that fact in mind once I heard of this place my Korean buddy made an appointment with me to come out here and try it as soon as possible. Let's start with the decor, it's nice and the bathroom plays traditional Korean music different from the rest of the establishment, overall nice vibes and it's classier than what most ramen joints offer. The food, let's talk food, and when I say food, I say the ramen, I got the spicy one, the one most similar to the iconic Korean Shin ramen. It's disappointing to say but it's not even as spicy as shin, but the quality of the broth is much higher, thick rich and creamy. The noodles have an instant feel to them and that's done on purpose, personally I'm not the biggest fan of that but that's alright, it may be for you. The pork is slice thick, almost like a block and seared on one side, a nice change. Everything else in the bowl however, and lemme preface this by saying I understand that this is more of an experimental food, but I can't say that the flavors and textures pork quite as well as something that would be more on the traditional ramen side.Look, the food is alright, maybe even good, but this 3 star rating comes from the fact that there are just so many in my opinion more enjoyable ramen places in New York so by comparison it's only alright. Personally I'd come back only to show off something new and fresh, but otherwise I'll leave it be as it is quite expensive for what it is. Not to mention the service, some of you may enjoy the overbearing type of service where you are asked constantly how you think of the food. Me personally not so much.

The ramen was very good and creamy. I got the gochu which was well balanced between spicy and creamy, my friend got the fish coop which was light and nicely balanced from the chicken and fish stock. The only thing I wished they had was another bathroom because there is only one.

Expectations were high. Arrived at jeju around 6:45 place was not jam packed about 7 tables with guest and 3 people at the kitchen / bar counter. Two employees saw me and a gentleman in a suit(manager? Owner? Investor?) No one did a thing. No hospitality. I sat myself at the bar and was then approached by a young woman asking me if I wanted to dine there...  Water service is smart. You get a carafe of water.Beverage options were pretty good. Cool wine choices Austrian, California, and some old world wines. Curated for the cuisine. I asked the server/cook for a glass of their chenin blanc figured it would pair well. Good nose (green apple, lilacs, honey suckle, light to medium body, good acidity) Wine service - the glass looked a bit smudged (maybe they don't polish their glasses?) didn't say anything since it's their first day and they probably haven't figured out their systems yet.  Also pouring wine from where the server/cook stands to the bar guest is a bit difficult. The wine pour was a bit short I feel. About 4oz for a 13.00 glass of wine which is probably about 15-17 a bottle. 5-6oz tends to be the norm around the area. Didn't say anything since it's their first day and also it seemed petty. Ramyun - I got the veal broth ramyun. Never seen it on a menu at ramen places, w/ the chefs pedigree I was excited to see and taste this dish. Only for it fall flat, it needed something. I felt that the broth was a bit over salted. ( I know ramen is high in sodium) but this brother tasted like boiled veal bones with no other flavor profiles it felt like an unfinished ramen. I tried to appreciate the broth for it's self maybe the chef was taking a minimalist approach but salt is was stood out the most. Plus you only get like 2-3 pieces of sliced flavorless brisket which was disappointing. The soy cooked egg and noodles were the best components of the dish. Also during my meal no one ever asked how my ramyun was or if I was enjoying my experience. Maybe they weren't happy that I was a solo diner ordering a bowl of ramyun? The guest's next to me got more attention than I did. They got explanations about the dishes they had ordered and instructions on how to tackle the dish. All I got was ""sorry for the wait.."" I finished the ramyun and glass of wine never got offered another glass. I asked for the check, when the server / cook brought it over he mumbled something about the gratuity and circling it. I didn't understand it but circled %15 I wasn't pleased w/ my experience. I am very disappointed and I am hoping to go back to give them another shot once they get their systems in check.

In terms of appetizers, nothing really stands out. I wouldn't order the buns, chicken wings, or even the kimchi again. I'm used to sour and/or spicy kimchi and this was neither-- it had too many ingredients in it that aren't normally in kimchi. I usually don't comment on service but I feel like I have to because it definitely needs improvement. It seems as if you don't have a designated waiter and the staff just helps out where it's needed, but this obviously can lead to issues when it's busy.

Is this place some kind of a perfect date you didn't expect to find???Walking into a historic West Village landmark, the scene you are first welcomed with is not the ordinary Korean restaurant you will find on 32nd street.  Nor is it anything like other celebrity chefs' fame-guaranteed spots like Hanjan, Danji, or Momofuku families? Nope! This place certainly carries the most unique characters that anybody could have thought of when thinking of Korean restaurants. The perfect balance of preserved history (tiles, ceiling, and the exterior shading that still shows ""Nighthawks"") and modern essence of interior design elements (I mean check out the lightings, ceramics the foods are served in, and the spoons!) - Enough about the ambience.Now the foods:If you are expecting the more common ""Ramen"" in Japanese style cooking with thicker and much more saturated flavored broth, you should stick to your regular Ramen places. This place serves Korean style ""Ramyun"" noodle soup dishes with gentle but classic depth of the flavors in different types of broth. I have tried 2 of them. SO Ramyun - served with veal based broth, hearty flavor is perfected with garlic chips prepared in 3 (or more) different ways, then garnished with sliced steamed beef slices and wood-ear mushrooms.  The harmony of all the ingredients only seems to exist to satisfy your taste buds. When done eating the whole serving, you only feel satisfaction but not overly stuffed with too much flavor, it already makes you want to plan your next visit before they take away your empty plates. (You know this only happens when the restaurant did not stuff their dishes with MSG flavors!)Fish COOP - served in a clear broth, the clean cut of its flavor magically makes you gulp down the ""Ramyun"" noodle along with broth to ensure the continuous flow of the ""just right"" flavors pouring into your mouth.Pyunche Salad - I'm not a big fan of sauces and dressings even at fine dining restaurants, however, when the chef himself brought out the dish with his own sauce in a pan, I knew that it was going to hit a home run to my taste buds.  For a restaurant that is not specialized in raw fish, this place must know where to get their supply of Yellowtails. And the chef made and served sauce! I would have no clues what the secret is of making it, but I only know how great it tastes and since I'm no connoisseur when in comes to sauces, I am running out of words to describe how delicious it is! It is a must order appetizer item every time I go to this place.HDB - did I mention that I don't eat rice? Well, I did at this place. And it was amazing and I didn't feel like I was eating rice.  This dish has just opened up new potentials in the world of any restaurant's menu item labeled as ""xxx over rice""  And I might sound really dumb with plain choices of vocabulary, because it simply is so delicious with all (I feel like there are about 10+ items I see on top of rice) the fresh ingredients I can see, making it an absolutely perfect harmony of taste! I didn't need the chef's special hot sauce to add flavor to the dish.SSAM BUN - I'm only going to say one thing here. SSAM BUN at JeJu Noodle Bar? or Pork Bun from Ippudo? I'd take SSAM BUN over Pork Bun on any given day!Gochujang Bokum - Koreans often say you have to eat your rice to complete each meal. Topped with the ""Gochujang"" sauce (Korean chilly paste) prepared in the cooking style of Ragu completes an essential taste bud in Korean food! Again, non rice eater I am, I truly enjoyed this dish!Cucumber Kimchi - It's cucumber and it's kimchi, but how does it taste so good? You just have to try it!As I was walking out of the restaurant, or more like before I got up from my table, I was thinking of my next visit and it made me feel even more satisfied.  Pleasantly full with delicious food but not attacked by overly stuffing after taste of artificial flavorings (MSG) or sodium, this restaurant definitely earned its keep!

We ordered the fried chicken wings and bao buns to start. Wings were nice n crispy on the outside however a bit tough underneath. Came with some mix assortment of veg and a dipping sauce which was nothing that stood out. The buns were constructed nicely with some heat and corn inside however the pork belly was extremely chewy tough. The ramyan was also a mixed bag for me. Nice few pieces of pickled cabbage with serious vinegar bite. Broth had a perfect spice overall and noodles cooked pretty well however the pork pieces were tough as cardboard. Big pieces so its pretty tough to eat without a cutting utensil handy. Just dissapointed if i was not meant to be able to easily bite into without grabbing with my fingers to tear away for a manageable bite. Maybe tough and large is what they were going for? Service was attentive through our service and the hostess crew were plenty apologetic for the wait we had. We got unlucky and just missed getting in the 2nd turnover for the night by my estimate but found a place next door to have a few drinks. No big deal in the end. Decor was nice enough and great music on in the background. They do have what looks to be a table right next to the hostess stand and front door so just pray you dont ever get that. I was debating with my dinner date if that was really worth having in the place. Overall I dont see myself making any extra effort to go here again when plenty reliable high end places near where i am in the EV. (Eg momofuku noodle bar, ippudo) i do understand the being pretty new aspect and the hiccups associated being worked out probably in the coming weeks. However the food itself was the letdown for me and not the operational aspects. Maybe being towards the end of the night we ended up with pork that hadnt been given the time to really tenderize down? Disappointing then given the pedigree this place is leveraging on.",JeJu Noodle Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Korean,, Noodles"

There was nothing on the door to indicate the reason for the closure and when I called, their answering machine message didn't even indicate that they WERE closed. When I emailed them the next day there was still no explanation, but she would be happy to make a reservation for me! Like I can't do that myself! The only other time this has ever happened to me in NYC the restaurant apologized and offered me a gift certificate for inconveniencing me.

Sparking rose wine was perfect to start.I ordered tuna yookhwe. It was DELICIOUS!! Life changing. Hwe Dup Bap was fresh and lovely. The rice was perfect. The flavor was great. And then, fish coop ramyun. I was very rich and flavorful. The broth were just right and different. I mean Different!  Personaly this ramyun is top notch. After ra myun, I ordered gochujang bokum.

But the food didn't knock us out. The fried chicken wings were okay, not up to what we'd hoped. Other reviews were so enthusiastic, we expected more flavor. They came with a garlicky sauce, but...Then we had the sbuns (maybe a few more letters in them), which looked promising and were sandwiched in the kind of roll Peking Duck often comes in. They were okay, again, not to die for.We shared the veal ramen and had an egg in it, which was also fine, but my husband and I preferred the broth we'd had elsewhere.The place is attractive, but it's not cheap and I don't plan on returning.",JeJu Noodle Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Korean,, Noodles"

My favorite ramyun was the Fish Coop. The broth was refreshing, unlike most Japanese style ramyun, which  tend to be greasy and thick in texture. The chicken was juicy and tender.

This is completely Americanized, not even CLOSE to Korean food. In fact, the ramen they serve is Japanese inspired ramen. The soup is EXTREMELY creamy and rich (not a good thing), creamier than most ramen soup should be. Honestly shouldn't really be called a ramen. Not to mention 2 ramens with egg and an appetizer came out to $60. Not worth it. Don't come here.",JeJu Noodle Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Korean,, Noodles"

The gochu was delicious, rich, full of flavor. The fish coop was pretty tasty also. Lighter, and a bit of an herb undertone to the taste.  The so was decent, but we found it to be very salty. It is likely just our preference and how the dish is intended, however the manager or owner was very accommodating when we mentioned that. This restaurant is definitely worth a visit.

125,puaJ9NRlkdaynWp7MJaZLA,Minzi K.,5.0 star rating,"Jeju Noodle Bar was so delicious! I went with my family, and ordered an array of dishes, including the Tuna Yuk Hwe, the Pyunche salad, and the Hwe Dup Bap, as well as all three of the ramyun dishes. All the appetizers and the ramyun dishes were very well presented (very Instagram friendly!) as well as extremely delicious. Whatever fish they've been using in their dishes taste extremely fresh, and at the same level as other really delicious sushi places around the city. My favorite ramyun dish was probably the Fish Coop, as it had a really fresh flavor, but all of the ramyun dishes were a good size to eat, and my family was able to finish everything and still be plenty full.The interior and service of the staff was also amazing. I love the look of their spoons, the feel of their chopsticks, and the variety and color of the plates. The interior was very cozy, but with enough room to move around, and it was also really aesthetically pleasing, particularly the more industrial looking chandelier at the center. The staff was super friendly, and often came to check up on us as we ate. Overall, it was a 10/10 experience, and I would love to go again!",JeJu Noodle Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Korean,, Noodles"

However, while the service means well, it is very inconsistent and there's often an inexplicable delay between starters and the mains. Similarly, some servers seem to know what they're doing and others don't - example they'll check to see how your meal and sometimes they only ask when they're picking up the empty place setting. Similarly sometimes they and your drink and sometimes they leave the beverage in the bottle for you to pour it. Too bad; has a lot of potential.",JeJu Noodle Bar,4.0 star rating,$$,"Korean,, Noodles"

We ordered a pork bun as well as chicken wings and hwe dub bap for starters. Super tender Pork and right amount seasoning with kimchi and some special sauce worked perfectly well. Fried chicken wings were so crispy outside and juicy inside. Also loved vegetables coming along with the wings. Hwe dub bap was outstanding dish as a big fan of raw fish. Sashimi cubes wee so fresh, and never smells fishy at all which were hidden behind the seasoning and dressing. And at last got ramyuns!! So-Ramyun and Fish Coop! Both broths were very rich and tasty. So Ramyun was very similar like korean beef soup, came with beef in the bowl. So delicious. Fish coop, for my wife, was also great and perfectly balanced between chicken broth and fish-ness. Noodles were not over / under cooked, and even my young little daughter enjoyed both noodles. It was a great experience and tasty family dinner.

There's definitely more privacy than a lot of ramen restaurants, which I appreciated. We both had the non-fish ramen and the soon du bu. I really enjoyed all of our food and the experience as whole.
