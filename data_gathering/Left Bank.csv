2,Cy7J-d9d1fT7AqMrVcps8Q,Dave R.,4.0 star rating,We read about the Left Bank's happy hour special so we decided to give it a try.  The happy hour includes an appetizer and pasta entree for $25.  Of course it doesn't include the entire menu and upon seeing the rest of the menu we got excited and decided to order off the full menu.  We started with steak tartar and grilled calamari.  The steak tar tar was kind of a deconstructed version as it was more untreated with all the accoutrements on the side.  It was a fun treatment of this appetizer but not the best version we've had.  The calamari was in a stewed red sauce with green and black olives and was really delicious. The calamari even had a nice charred hue to it.  For our entrees we got the potato gnocchi with butternut squash in an incredible butter sauce.  It was decadent and scrumptious.  A perfect fall dish.  We also got the grilled brook trout with salsa verde and roasted potatoes.  First of all the potatoes were crispy yet tender inside.  Perfectly prepared!  The fish was also perfectly prepared and the salsa verde was an ideal accompaniment although we would have preferred a little more of that.  We finished our meal with the dark chocolate mousse.  I have to say that I LOVE chocolate mousse and it has been awhile since I have had a version that I thought was worth writing about.  This was one of them.  Delicious finish to a wonderful night.  And not to be forgotten was the great wait staff that was spot on.,Left Bank,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New)"

The restaurant is a nice, quiet corner spot, but the food is pricey and mostly underwhelming. They do serve grumpy's coffee though which is a nice touch, but it's $4 and the cups are super small but come with refills. Given the plethora of quality restaurants in NYC, I would search elsewhere for your brunch fare. For $16, the cheese omelet is served with a homemade cheese mixture, which wasn't my favorite especially after a couple of bites when it became slightly offputting. And it only comes with a side salad. A crazy price for some eggs and greens. The dish was fine but nothing memorable. The best dish was the french toast, which wasn't too sweet or heavy, but had a nice richness to it. The Dutch pancakes were also enjoyable with the addition of some syrup. The most underwhelming dish was the potato latkes. They were lukewarm and mushy as though they weren't cooked all the way through.

Nothing unbearable, just the same ""humidity"" you notice when you go into an old building and then goes away. If anything, I felt it more homey (nice change from the fake smell in other places).

Finally my boyfriend got the roasted onion and pesto soup ($13) which was out of this world. I had the shaved brussels sprouts salad w/ pecorino, hazelnuts, olive oil/lemon($16) which was nice and refreshing. We shared the chicken liver and mushroom pate with the appetizers and it was very good on the toasted bread. Then we shared the iron roast split chicken ($27) as a main. Someone else compared it to Pio Pio's and it nothing like it. Pio Pio's ket in their chicken is the green sauce (magic!) and this one didn't have such. It was great though and I loved the braised greens that came with it. I didn't leave anything in my plate (or my bf's either :P). Also they are ""committed to sourcing only humanely raised meat"". So it was a happy chicken and lived a nice (maybe short) life.We had a bottle of Dido Tinto 2015 ($68, grenach from Catalonia, Spain).

They also have $6 glasses of red, rose, and white wines which is a great deal! We chose the cab franc from the finger lakes and it was delish!For food, we chose the bolognese pasta with pork and beef. This was amazing , the pasta was buttery and melted in your mouth. Contrary to what you'd think it's not a red sauce it's like a very light wine sauce it was so delish! For apps we had the grilled octopus and beef tartare which were both also very delicious!

First off, happy hour deals here are amazing and if it fits your schedule I highly suggest! They do $25 pasta + appetizer with many options to choose for both! They also have $6 glasses of red, rose, and white wines which is a great deal! We chose the cab franc from the finger lakes and it was delish!For food, we chose the bolognese pasta with pork and beef. This was amazing , the pasta was buttery and melted in your mouth. Contrary to what you'd think it's not a red sauce it's like a very light wine sauce it was so delish! For apps we had the grilled octopus and beef tartare which were both also very delicious!

(We got one at 11 Madison Park just moments back - but we had no reservation and you can't be impromptu with Divinity...)We headed on downtown and as we drove down I mindlessly (won't happen again) booked it on Open Table ... mainly because it was pouring and we would be able to run in off the street (after visiting the beautiful Trace Foundation a half block away) Note it was really pouring rain. I mean pouring.So essentially we ran in from the storm at 4:30 -they open at 5pm. We came in like two stray cats seeking dry shelter (I had a box with a painting inside so I was very insistent on staying)  and were almost turned away had I not insisted. Finally after telling us ""No"" and then me insisting on him asking permission, we  were told we were allowed to stay... So we sit at the high stools at the entrance. Ask if maybe we could get a drink?No drinks available until 5pm... So here we are waiting 30 minutes with money to burn and thirsty and totally ignored by the staff.... Go figure.There are two rooms and we were finally (after asking at 5:05 if maybe we could be seated) led into the second room where a loud old table fan placed on the floor was barely making a cool breeze in a hot sticky room without air conditioning. Why they sat us here and not in the cooler room? Go figure.Bare stark tables - no bread offered. Ok the Nosh was good -because we were both starving (having not had time to eat all day) but two huge pieces of bread and one little nick of cheese do not balance out. Tasty as it was it was greasy with butter melted in the bread for who knows why.There was a sense that this place really doesn't give a hoot if you eat there or not. Or maybe they were annoyed because we asked to come in from the rain?? Did I mention the flood alert?My kale salad was too salty- way too salty and had mostly kale and pecorino y basta. So it was meh. Mio ñoqui anche, swimming in oil and soggy onions. I relied on the sweet peas to save me. If we were not starving I don't think I would have eaten my dish. My partners steak was ok he said and the fries were I think from frozen not fa to table for sure.The staff was not unpleasant but really -to be honest - seemed blasé about us being there.  It is a neighborhood corner restaurant with an attitude....  Go figure....Sorry not my taste.

51,n1J4tWCmu7nKA_irQl8ORg,Josh K.,2.0 star rating,"*** Disclaimer: I came with a Good Whiskey Passport promotion ***Had a really odd experience coming in here for the first time with a Good Whiskey Passport. Initially, we sat at the bar because we didn't want to take up dinner table space just taking advantage of the promotion. We thought this was a good citizen thing to do. The bartender brusquely says no, if you're here with the passport, you have to go talk to the host and have him seat you. Okay fine, so one of us goes to talk to him. Apparently the host is really confused and comes back and says ""they have these promotions... isn't the bar ok?"" And finally he relented. It made us feel really singled out and awkward.Plus, while I was waiting for the host to come back, the bartender came to me and just said these words: ""Let me know whatever you want, I can get it for you."" Given that we were coming for this promotion, this made no sense to me, because the drink selection is fixed -- though it would sound normal in other situations. In the context, it almost seemed like he was trying to hook me up with drugs or something while my companion was gone. I just kind of shrugged, confusedly, and he proceeded to turn around and do something else.Anyway we end up sitting at the bar and get our comped drink. Great. We also decide to order the 'oyster upgrade' which gives allows you to add some fresh oysters to the promotion for an extra $5. At most places this amounts to a dollar oyster deal and you get 4 or 5. Here we got 2, perhaps the smallest oysters I have ever seen, with little strips of bacon on top. The bacon was so strong I could barely taste the oyster, I felt like they were just pawning off the bad stuff on the annoying people with the promotion.The clientele seemed like a lot of super rich, out of touch, gringo West Village types.

We just had a big snowstorm the night before, so it was pretty bitter outside and probably deterred some from dining out. The place barely had a quarter of their tables taken.I really liked the interior, it was rustic and spacious with dim lighting and large windows to the street. I was not a big fan of the bizarre fiddle music they had playing though...It's too bad their cocktails were mostly gin/ bourbon. There weren't really any lighter options on the cocktail menu. I ended up getting one of their reds- I stayed away from their house wines because it was all from the same winery. It was decent. My boyfriend got a tomato soup to start, and the tagliatelle- very creamy and satisfying. I decided to go out on a limb and try their black squid ink fusilli. I've had squid ink pasta before, but this dish was simply not memorable. It's the main reason I took off a star. The dish had potential to be unique- it had chickpeas, garlic, squid (mostly rings, grilled), and the fusilli. It was extremely dry because it didn't come in a sauce. It definitely lacked in flavor as a result. At one point I asked the waitress if she could bring over cheese for the pasta, she brought out a small cup of grated Romano. That helped on the flavor front- but arguably made the dish more dry.The dessert was honestly the highlight. We got the maple syrup pie which was to DIE FOR !! (It's a small slice) I'd go back just to get one of those....it kind of reminds me of a better, more homemade-tasting version of a crack pie from momofuku. We also asked them for a scoop of vanilla ice cream because we wanted something to cut the sweetness: you don't need it. We were very confused because along with our syrup pie came a little bottle of root beer and 2 scoops of ice cream in a tall glass. My boyfriend and I exchanged confused looks and addressed the issue with the waitress. She apologized and said she accidentally put into the computer root beer float instead of ice cream. She let us keep it though and they brought out more ice cream which was nice, but very unnecessary. Safe to say we overate on the dessert front. The service itself was average at best. Our waitress, though very kind, wasn't too helpful when I asked her questions about the wines and the food. She used extremely general terms to describe the dishes that you could really say about any plate of food. The busser was extremely attentive though with water / clearing plates.Overall I'm not sure that I'd go back- at least not for dinner. I think the menu could use some diversifying-both on the food and drinks. other than the pastas they really only offer a burger and a few large plates (steak/ fish). The apps section probably could use work. The brunch menu looks tasty though, and I'd definitely order the syrup pie again.",Left Bank,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New)"

And suddenly it is all smiles at the Left Bank. The menu looks so well, the service is good. What else can you ask for?The wine list looks great, so we go for a good wine. However here is where things got wrong. We waited for one hour for our food (this is not an exageration). When you get to a restaurant and you will have to wait for an hour for food, the restaurant should warn you. And if they are going to order expensive wine to go with the food, even more reason.While we were waiting for the food, we had to ask for some bread, as I believe they consider it normal to wait for 1 hour for the dishes. Everytime we interacted with the service it was all smiles, but something was going terribly wrong.On a more subjective point, I think that the past carbonara wasn't cooked enough and the veggies that came with the hake didn't go well with the fish.Worst of all, when we got the check, we had to pay 20% mandatory gratuity for tables of 6 or more people.",Left Bank,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New)"

Walking in we were greeted by the head chef and the host and seated immediately. Being a holiday weekend, it was slower then normal, getting a table was much easier than expected. The interior is simplistic yet inviting with the windows adding a vision of the NYC street. The dining room is laid out in a way that utilizes the space fully without feeling cramped. The food...OH THE FOOD! I'll speak about our appetizer later.We decided to do a chefs tasting and shared different courses as chosen by the chef and also added in the Wine Pairing as well.Our first course was Fresh Squid Calamari with Chickpeas done Two-Ways. I've not had a fresh squid before and I'll never go back to any other way. Tender, flavorful and perfectly seasoned, this was a great way to start along with our other appetizer(which I will cover) With a chili seasoning and the chickpeas made deftly by our chef, this readied our palettes for a rich journey. Our second dish was Handmade Pasta with Pork Bolognese(this may have also had beef in the sauce, but I cannot seem to recollect that) A great dish, buttery and rich, full of flavor and creamy mouth. Honestly, we could have stopped here and felt satiated, but the Chef apparently took a liking to us and decided our next course was even bolder. A Braised Chicken with what might be the best corn I've ever had and a Whole Fish(trout) I enjoyed the chicken immensely. Perfectly cooked and tender. My date enjoyed the corn so much she ate all of that herself. I personally devoured the fish, eating the whole thing. The crispy skin was seasoned so well I could have eaten that every day. What was even more impressive  was, after such a rich pasta and appetizer, the fish brightened up our palettes perfectly. Finally we reached our dessert; a fresh market Blueberry Cobbler with Gelato. Tart, not too sweet, flavorful and a great finish to such an incredible meal and experience. There are two critiques I specifically have. One, the wine pairing was expensive(which is fine) but not really well thought out and felt a bit uninspired. The first wine was a chilled red, which wasn't chilled but very very cold, which destroyed any real flavor. Also, the pairings were minuscule in their glass so one sip was all you actually received and not even a full sip. The white pairings were good but again nothing of note. Secondly, as a coffee professional, I'm always interested in the restaurants ability to make a decent cappuccino. Unfortunately, that was not good. I'm sure it can be fixed and I do hope that it is. Finally, as promised, if you've read this far, I want to talk about the Chicken Liver Patté!One, I've never had chicken liver, nor have I eaten patté either, so I was a bit nervous in this. But being the brave eater I am, I spread this on a slice of bread and was rewarded ten-fold for it. This is literally, and I do mean literally, the best thing I've ever eaten. It's creamy, rich texture is mouthwateringly good. It's buttery flavor mixes so well with the iron and the proteins from the liver you would swear it's like heaven on your palette. I'm not exaggerating here, go by and try it, and you will see. Overall our experience was perfect.

Service was great and friendly.Because we were in a group, we ordered a few dishes and got to try everything as we shared our plates.

I wish there was more in the plate!Seared potato gnocchi - By far one of my favorites we tried. I was craving this and thinking of it the next day. The gnocchi was cooked to perfection, not to heavy, light, and fluffy as I like it. The flavors in the sauce were a great compliment to the cauliflower and pistachio. Fresh tagliatelle - This was a pork and beef bolognese, which was pretty good. I think the other ladies in our group did like it better. I would have loved for it to be a bit saucy. It was mainly the meat and the pasta. Good flavorsBrook Trout - Definitely a must get. The flavors of this fish and the softness was delicious. The salsa verde on top added a fresh flavor to the fish and the lentils served with the trout was not the typical lentil you would expect. it was citrusy, not soupy, and a perfect compliment to the fish.Parmesan fries - you can't go wrong with fries!For dessert we had the ricotta cheesecake which was pretty good. The dessert you must get at this place is the maple syrup pie. Its kind of similar to the crack pie at momofuko but 100 times better. Devoured fast!",Left Bank,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New)"
74,eTzkUFKGbpZFLRlgG2CpEA,Javier F.,3.0 star rating,"I visited last friday night, reserved a table 40 minutes earlier and I got there around 8:30. Everything went smoothly, we were greeted by this super nice hostess and we were seated immediately, actually they had no issues switching our table to a different one after we requested it. Service is good.I tried the ruby soho, fresh and well balanced, a bit crisp for a summer drink but still sweet and refreshing. I was a bit concerned about the wine list though, it did not quite match my selection of food, so I decided to start with a glass of Riesling... I have to point this out: the waiter came to the table, poured the wine from a small glass into a cup and left, no questions asked.To start I tried the shaved brussel sprouts salad with radiccio, nothing fantastic. Just precisely chilled and fresh, but in terms of flavor... I felt disappointed. The Pate was good, but I liked more the toasts...and the pickles that came on the side.For main course I had the codfish, simple... maybe too simple. It was crispy and tender, but I missed some more excitement regarding flavor. Also, I believe that using smashed potatoes as a Side is always a wild card, so I'd expect that a Restaurant that charges 28 dollars for a fish filet the same size as an old NOKIA cell phone, it's a bit tricky.Also, I ordered the chicken, and let me say it was dry and (again) simple. I decided to give them one last chance and I ordered the chocolate mouse, it was actually nice, despite the absurdly gigantic splash of whipped cream on top (what's up with spoiling dessert with whipped cream?).The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, the service is truly fine, but the food is not only disappointing but also overpriced. I do understand the fact that it sits in the middle of the west village, but that excuse got old a long time ago.Cool soundtrack btw.",Left Bank,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New)"

For appetizers my party had:-steak tartare (cornichons, mustard, toast supp $5) not my favorite but it was good -Mongolian dumplings (soy, lime & scallion) these were interesting and had a strong flavor to them For my main I had:-strozzapreti (kid goat sugo, caramelized onions & pine nut) this is not a tomato sauce by the way... It's a very rich, meaty sauce made with the jus of the goat meat and it was delicious! For desserts my table shared the lemon tart with fresh whipped cream and the hot chocolate brownie a la mode. Both were scrumptious!Overall it was a great Restaurant Week meal especially for the price! The flavors were so rich and I was absolutely stuffed by the end.

We were seated near the bar so the noise level was loud.Food: Appetizer: Started with the Chicken Pate. The portion is huge, and the pate is delicious and smooth, especially paired with the pickled shallot and mustard seed. I also tried my friend's mongolian dumplings - very meaty and flavorful.Entree: iron roasted chicken. Again, portion is huge, the skin is crispy and sweet, and the meat is juicy. They give a lot of brussel sprouts, but they became tiresome and bitter after a while (they are on the hard side of being cooked). Dessert: Maple Syrup Pie. OH MY, Super sweet. Literally tastes like maple syrup (with a texture similar to a pumpkin pie). It was too sweet for my taste, but putting whipped cream over it helped a lot.Service: Our waiter kind of passed us numerous times without checkin in on us.

We were so excited to finally try this place as it's very close to our apartment and we were hoping it could become a regular neighborhood spot in our weeknight dinner rotation. The ambience is cozy and we were 2 people that got seated within 10 minutes of arriving around 8:30 on a Friday night, so that was great!Unfortunately, the food did not impress. We started with the shaved brussel sprout salad, which was dressed in such an acidic vinaigrette that it tasted almost sour. We assumed this was just a misstep and moved on. Then we had the special of the night, a pork dumpling dish. It was so far from a good dumpling, just  not flavorful and paled in comparison to so many cheap dumplings available throughout the city at authentic Chinese places. For an entree, we shared the carbonara, which was cooked so al dente that it seemed like someone took the pasta out of the boiling water too early, by mistake. The sauce on the carbonara, however, was excellent.  In addition to these issues with food, the restaurant is located across from a parking garage, so the fluorescent light from the garage was shining in our eyes the entire dinner. Not really their fault, but some window dressings could alleviate this issue. As much as I love food and love eating out and wanted to love this place, it was just not happening for us with this experience.",Left Bank,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New)"

We were pleasantly greeted upon arrival with and sat few minutes after. It was in the middle of the rush. Our sever was prompt in greeting us once sat and explained the menu since it was our first time :) Always happy to start the evening with a knowledgeable server. I got the Hurricane and she got the Sangria. Both beverages were delicious as the hurricane was fruity and refreshing making dinning in tropical climate more tolerable. First course, the kale salad was very straight forward, and it was well seasoned. It is tomato season and left banks heirloom tomatoes were ripe, sweet, delicious and the sea salt and basil really brought out the flavor of the tomato and added the great herbal note to it.The gnocchi... House made which always makes me happy to know the chef is very skilled. With a beautiful summer vegetable medley of summer squash and snap peas, I never knew gnocchi could be so light. The trout. The trout. THE TROUT! Lol it was hands down some of the best trout I've had. The chef's craft really shines here. Trout is so well represented at left bank since they expertly cooked something so simple so well! Through out our dinner experience Christine our server checked in on us and always made sure we were enjoying ourselves. Thank you so much! We loved it!! My entire dining experience was a pleasurable one during restaurant week and i will definitely come back. The reason for the three stars instead of 5 is because the only uncomfortable part of the entire dinning experience was that it was so too hot.

Our waitress was very polite, and prompt.  Service is a wee bit on the slow side but we didn't mind. My friend started off with 4 East Coast oysters (they're $1 each on Sunday afternoons).  She said they were average.  The she got the recommended scrambled egg fetunta-which was farm fresh scrambled eggs, kale, on top a thick cut of whole wheat bread.  A sprinkling of scallion and parmesan.  She also got a side of scones, with raspberry jam. She said these were pretty mediocre- somewhere in between a scone and shortbread and hard (not soft).  I went with the recommended poached eggs. Apparently the salmon is really special- smoked in house and a bit ""different."" I didn't particularly notice their uniqueness but I did notice how fresh the smoked salmon was, because it was not super salty.  It also had an herb-y edge to it, it was interesting.  The rosemary home fries were delish- and the right quantity.  And the eggs were perfectly poached- a bit on the harder side (thankfully no vinegar taste!)   But, all in all the dish was not as awesome as the waitress described. Then again though, I held the hollandaise to save me some fat consumption- maybe that was a deal breaker. I also had an iced coffee, and small freshly squeezed OJ.  Both were really good- esp. the coffee. My friend ordered a latte and thought it looked a little small, she was it ok.

My group ordered the headcheese and swiss chard pie to start. I didn't try the headcheese since it weirds me out but the pie was tasty and was very similar to a spinach pie but less flakey and with different cheese. Also, fried egg on top of anything is always a plus! For an entree, I had the iron roasted split chicken. It wasn't bad but it wasn't out of this world. The chicken was a bit dry but the skin was done nice and crispy. The risotta cake was interesting.. definitely on the drier side in order to form it in the shape of a cake, but not bad. My friend had the paccheri but wasn't impressed. We thought the tuna was overcooked but maybe it was our fault for assuming it was going to be a few slices of nice seared tuna instead? My other friend had the grass fed bavette steak and thought it was only average. Although our meal was underwhelming we thought dessert might save the meal but alas, the one dessert we did want to try, saturn peach pie, was sold out. They only baked one pie for the day according to the waiter.. We left disappointed and craving some sweets to cap off the night.",Left Bank,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New)"

Food was delicious, drinks were fantastic and the staff was great. Our main waiter, Micheal was superb! He was invisible but so very helpful and attentive at the same time.

I started off with the burrata and eggplant and the pompano on toast. I was not a fan of the burrata texture, but the pompano was good. Dining partner had the scallops and really liked the accompanying risotto, but I found the scallops way oversalted.Next course, I had the mussels and the stuffed pepper. The mussels were nicely cooked, but the meat was kind of small. I liked the stuffed red bell pepper.

The decor is within that sort of weird rustic industrial aesthetic, but it works. The noise level wasn't too overwhelming, despite the close tables, so bravo to the designer.My dinner date was late, so I treated myself to a pre-dinner taste of roasted beets with cheese and balsamic - it was delicious and a nice size for an appetizer for one. Once he finally arrived, we ordered shaved brussel sprouts, the dumplings, strozzapreti with lamb sugo, and a dish on the RW menu that doesn't appear on the website - short ribs with hominy. Of all the dishes, I was most impressed with the lamb sugo. I am not a lamb person, but the dish was not gamey and a lot lighter than I expected. Great, well-developed flavor, with a sauce that stuck well to the pasta, letting you swipe up every last drop.The two desserts split our vote - the maple sugar pie was fantastic, but the lemon square was very straightforward and a little ho-hum compared to the rest of the meal.",Left Bank,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New)"

Unfortunately, I have to give that yet another totally-average ""C"" grade.  It was a basic brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top - honestly indistinguishable from what you could pick up at any run-of-the-mill restaurant or grocery store.My final verdict: Meh.  Very mehhhh.",Left Bank,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New)"

For my main dish I had the curly pasta with burrata and anchovy- it was delicious but I was so full that I had to bring it home (which is just fine by me- more to enjoy the next day). I actually chose to order from the regular menu vs the restaurant menu, it was a few dollars cheaper and I'm not a dessert person so I was fine without it. My friend got the calamari and hummus appetizer- I had a few bites and loved it- again the combination of chickpeas and seafood sounds unusual but it worked perfectly. She had the potato gnocchi as her main coarse and I have to admit I was jealous I didn't order this- I typically do not like gnocchi but this was out of this world.

Once you're two sheets [gone] with the wind, you can snuggle up at a wooden candle lit table and order some nosh! And the menu (including the inspired specialty cocktails) reveal their creator's Jewish heritage; including the uniquely dazzling Meshugatini, which is like a pickle party, a classic egg creme, and other affectionally labeled 'nosh' options. One of my favorite things they offer aside from everything, is the Apple Crumb baked dessert with an amazing scoop of vanilla ice creme ready to melt and meld with the hot apple. GAH SO GOOD. The pork belly is divine, the pasta happy hour awesome, and the wine list trend en pointe but not pretentious and totally approachable, much like the fleet, friendly waiters. Other favorite include the steak tartare, and pan roasted chicken. Go and make a new favorite spot for yourself!",Left Bank,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New)"

My wife had the squash ravioli which tasted even better - the place is serious about food.In the end we checked the desert menu which was brief and seemed dull, but we were happy to discover the brownie was delicious, a simple recipe masterfully prepared.The place only doesn't get 5 stars because we had an awkward located table (even though I reserved four days in advance).Love this place.",Left Bank,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New)"

The food was good, but hit or miss. The olive oil cake was bland and the lobster puffs were more puff than lobster. The steak was very tasty and the maple syrup pie was delicious but very sweet.The servers were polite, but took way too long to deliver the food. The dinner started at 7:30pm and we didn't have dinner until 9:15pm. Everyone at the table ate all of the bread because we were HUNGRY. Then, the food came out very quickly and I felt rushed. Rather frustrating.The private room itself is very pretty, though in a basement so no windows.

But, yeah, Yay, I'm a fan.I can say without reservation that it's a new favorite of mine. One of the few places in a lovely area that isn't overwhelmed by the you-know-who's... A neighborhood gem that attracts cool locals and has a warm, welcoming, down-to-earth staff. The oysters on Sunday are very good: local, fresh and a great bargain (and are high in vitamin B12, which, I recently learned, you can mostly only get in beef/liver/supplements, etc.).The bartender this afternoon (Lindsay) is a doll. She really knows her wines and bevvies  -- and can be counted upon to recommend a good accompaniment to any dish. The ambience is cool and comfortable, with a fair amount of windows through which to view the parade of characters and fashion -- faux and fab -- discreetly, through window blinds in three directions on this quaint, historical far West Village block.

FFF is bi-coastal these days, so we have to keep reminding her that NYC food is better than SF! The place is cute but also has a fun, energetic vibe. I can definitely see having dinner here before a big night out or having it be the center of your evening plans as a great date spot. The service was outstanding. All of the servers and the bartender were in plaid. Gotta love that right? The price is definitely quite reasonable, which is nice for the WV. FFF and I started with a bottle of bubbles (because that's just how we do things) - Prosecco to be exact. I had the grilled octopus to start and FFF had the french onion, two of their signature dishes. FFF doesn't even like octopus and she too agreed that it was excellent. Her soup was good as well. I had the pork chop as my entree and it was so tasty and juicy. It was done with sauerkraut and garbanzo beans, which worked really nicely together with the pork. FFF had the crabs - and NO FFF does not have crabs (gross) she only eats them for dinner. After that I know there was something chocolate which was very good, but I was also pretty full. I'd recommend Left Bank. I like that the food is quite tasty but it's not over-hyped or overpriced. The people that work here look like they actually really enjoy their jobs.

But even if it weren't, it's where I LIVE!2) I am Hispanic and found his comment to be racist and extremely offensive.When I told him that he was being rude and shouldn't hold his breath waiting for a good tip, he actually took back the cheese plate I was eating from and asked me to leave.

Initial impression was fantastic -  Wine: excellent sommelier who brought over & taught our table about the cool gadget pouring the wine (Coravin device), and really wonderful wine (albeit $28 was the most affordable option for a 6 oz glass), but fine - I was ready to enjoy a nice glass of wine & meal.Appetizers: The steak tartare was phenomenalEntrees: My friend's chicken was nothing to write home about, and the farfalle pasta was good. The real problem here is the service. I understand it is restaurant week (which I didn't realize going into the night, as I'm still new to the city) but regardless it is no excuse for poor service that leaves the diners utterly baffled. I kid you not, we had 5 separate people waiting on us.. someone different for each stage of the meal - one face to take drink orders, another face to pour wine, another to take our food order, a new face to bring the food, a new face to take the food... I had no clue who our server was, or who to ask what to.This would be fine, except for the fact that this allows room for error & consequently bad service. We were overcharged by 2 glasses of wine when we received our bill. Then, when we initially inquired for someone to explain the charge, server #4 said that is what we ordered... and so we gave our credit cards... kept thinking about it.. and then called server #3/4/5 over again, to say ""Look, not to be rude, but can you just explain to us the wine pricing/sizing options, because we think we were overcharged?"" At which point he responded, ""I better go get the manager if we have a problem here"" Well now, there is no reason to be terse. And there would be no reason to get the manager if we just had a consistent server who knew our bill. After another 5 minutes, the original sommelier/manager came over to apologize and in fact, admit we were overcharged. But then it took another 15 minutes for the team to cancel and re-do the bill. Of course mistakes can be made when calculating a bill, and I can see how it happened, but how they handled the situation (that their service technique more or less created) was appalling. Considering the hassle, the back & the forth, and the lack of sincerity for the inconvenience, I will not be going back.

After we finished our first round drinks they stayed empty for the remainder of the meal. As for the drinks themselves; EH. We had the watermelon margaritas and they were pretty bland. The food was also just OK. The fried calamari was good but it's hard to screw that up. I did not really enjoy my goat ragu over pasta, though in fairness perhaps i just don't love goat.

Plus, the fish came with no vegetables or side at all.  Nothing but the trout for $25. So I had to order the side of green beans.  The beans were good, but they doused it with Dijon mustard sauce that pretty much tasted like they squirted Dijon mustard out of the bottle.  The service was excellent though, from everyone.   Super friendly, knowledgable, helpful, and on top of everything.  And it's a cute atmosphere and bar area with a great wine list.  I think I'd go back for drinks at the bar area but skip the main meal.",Left Bank,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New)"

Ok folks, I thought the whole point in RW was to try a slew of awesome restaurants and at the same time get a decent deal with the pre-fix menus. Usually the price comes out to a free dessert or something. Nothing too crazy. And don't get me wrong, everything tasted fabulous, especially their bread, pate and steak tartare apps.

He listened to our wine taste preferences and recommended a couple of great wines. He was also patient as we oohed and aahed over the menu, giving us tips on what were restaurant favorites and what he liked about each dish.We started with the sauteed kale & broccoli rabe with garlic and chili. Overall, the flavors were pretty good. I liked the slight bitterness paired with garlic and chili, but felt like it could have had a bit more garlic and heat. Additionally, I found the dish to be too oily. But with a little less olive oil, I think I would have been happy.My friend ordered the swordfish risotto and I had the chicken with brussel sprouts and cipolini onions. She really enjoyed risotto. I had a  bite, and while I wasn't totally blown away, the flavors were pretty good and the risotto was perfectly cooked (seriously, it is really hard to find a perfectly cooked risotto!!). I really really enjoyed my chicken dish. The brussel sprouts were perfect. The jus for the chicken was divine.

I ended up nibbling on some of the brussels sprouts and took one bite of spaghetti squash, but essentially I ended up drinking way too much and eating way too little.

Great decor -- white walls with dark brown floors and tables.I had the grilled squid with beans and greens. Delicious. The crispy squid with the not-so-chewy body was great. The inside of the squid was the best part, reminded me of a pate texture. The beans were light and flavorful. The broth turned an ink color from the squid.My lady friend ordered the striped sea bass which was a late addition to the menu. ""Summer in your mouth"" as she described. Grilled on the top, crispy and moist on the inside. Her broth was delicious with mint leaves and some beans. The combo was refreshing, light and indeed summery.We ordered an extra side to share -- fresh carrots, radishes with a green garlic and anchovy dip. Not garlicly at all. It was nice to have the crunchy side dish. I asked for more bread to spread the garlic-anchovy.  Drinks were good - strawberry mojito had the right amount of sweetness. The Portugal white wine had added carbonation and a dry taste. It went well with the two seafood dishes.We skipped dessert, though the lemon sorbet and ice cream sounded good.Service was excellent and we met Micheline Gaulin, the owner, and she was happy to see a busy opening night.

The bar seats were full with neighbors enjoying the $1 Sunday oysters (our table went through 24 oysters VERY quickly -- they were good!!). In the main dining room, there were only a few tables filled.Restaurant changes daily. Post-oysters we split two appetizers -- kale salad and the grilled treviso with figs, melted gorgonzola and walnuts. Both were great. The treviso was especially excellent.For mains, two people ordered the spagetti with clams -- both plates were licked clean. I ordere the fluke which was cooked perfectly (generous portion of fish) over a corn chowder with veggies and bacon. DELISH! Our fourth friend ordered the roasted chicken which looked juicy.For dessert we split a piece of the maple syrup pie. Yes, it was as good as that sounds.

A fledgling on New York City's dining scene,the cozy, dim-lit restaurant was buzzing by 8 p.m. but not as bustling as its West Village neighbors. We were apprehensively seated right away and by the end of the meal, as pleasantly surprised as we were satisfied.Owned by restaurateur-duo Chef Laurence Edelman and Michelin Gaulin (the pair behind Chelsea's The Red Cat), Left Bank serves up European-inspired dishes in a tavern-like atmosphere using the freshest Farmer's Market picks.Unassuming from the outside, the dark wood, dim lighting and eclectic decor make this place quirky yet inviting to those who venture inside.

Luckily, the grilled octopus (savory with an excellent char, tender, served with a well balanced spinach salad) appetizer and the pork sausage over lentils were both excellent, and I gobbled it all pretty happily.The service was pretty friendly -- our waiter didn't bat an eyelash at using an OpenTable check to cover part of the meal, and he checked in with a smile several times, without once being obtrusive.

Salted cod looked beautiful, any my friend finished it up so I can't comment for myself.I then had the gnocchi with mushrooms, which was delish. I tried tastes of the cod, which was very good, and the papardelle with goat cheese -- also good. None of the food was stand-out, but everything was very good.

The menu is printed fresh each day, so some of my comments might not be overly helpful, but here goes... The squid, though everyone loves it (according to yelp...) I was not a fan - it managed to be spicy, tough and sour all at once. The gnocchi with pumpkin was fantastic - very lightly covered in sauce and very flavorful - not too rich like some NYC restaurants. The pork loin was very good - well prepared and lightly done. the borscht was fresh, but not fantastic. The side of kale was very good, but overly salty.

Walking on Hudson, I was immediately drawn to the lights by Spasso on Perry St. - which led me to Left Bank.I walked in on a Friday night thinking it would be packed, but found myself pleasantly surprised that it wasn't. At first, I was about to turn around and walk out because I was wondering why a West Village restaurant would be empty on a Friday night but I decided to give it a chance.Boy am I glad I did. I thought the food was AMAZING. Started with the octopus, which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I followed with the steak, which was a surprisingly large portion, considering the octopus (appetizer) was so small. I was almost unable to finish the main meal. There was an extensive wine list and the waiter was very attentive but slightly curt. She spoke quickly as if she was SO busy that she would have no time to attend to us.Half way through our meal, she decided to leave us with no notice, which was weird.

It took nearly a half an hour for our cocktails to arrive. Good drinks, sloooow bar. Fine, ok, but then we received our apps AN HOUR after we ordered, and my grilled squid was burned to a crisp and cold. They brought another one right away, but the dish was oily, limp, and unmemorable. The seafood stew ""cioppino"" was bland and under seasoned (and not very much to eat anyway, except for the delish chunks of cheese bread soaking in the broth). My dinner companion's chicken entree was crispy and solid (probably my recommendation), but nothing special. I tasted the cod app, interesting in theory, and that wasn't anything remarkable either. The maple pie dessert is a must, but the shortcake concoction I tried was a crumbly, bready mess. Not worth the calories. Drinks kept coming out at the wrong time.With 6,000 other restaurants to choose from, I can't imagine heading back to the Left Bank. I had a wonderful meal here a number of months back, but I have no idea what happened to this place--new chef? manager? who knows.

I think the restaurant is missing a little bit of buzz.  It can be a little staid.  Median age seems around 50.  But I would seriously recommend skipping the 2-hour wait at Spotted Pig and the scene at Aria and checking this out.  It's a wonderful neighborhood spot.",Left Bank,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New)"

It's red, but not heavy.    My dinner was boneless braised beef short ribs, which came with polenta.

Our disappointment was really that they didn't think to send over a comped dessert or appetizer or even a glass of wine after we had an event there. We were treating it like our special place, but there was no special treatment. It's a shame, but we are going to have our special occasion dinners somewhere else.",Left Bank,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New)"

Heck, he turned the vague descriptions of our preferences into delicious drinks that were surprising and approachable. Our delightful waiter, Courtney, followed the chef from his previous place, and I can see why. From the grilled octopus starter to the seasonal ramps, we were thrilled from the onset. The four of us enjoyed the strip steak (clean plate club!),  2 iron roasted split chickens (chickeniest chicken ever) and the paccheri (silky and rich). DELICIOUS!",Left Bank,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New)"
238,wiZA6S-pUL3Mx__ydF4jEA,Dave N.,4.0 star rating,"Wonderful dining experience at LB! Will absolutely go back. Will surely be interesting to see how the powers that be manage the menu - right now it's simple with a handful of each - apps/cheeses/pastas/protiens. Wouldn't have minded a few more choices, but LESS IS MORE. Right? Our server was both knowledgeable and helpful in our decision process in relation to both wine and food.  We had an excellent Jersey Tomato app where the tomatoes were perfectly ripe and dressed appropriately. Lamb Tartare was fantastic, with a welcomed hint of briny anchovy. The kind of hint, where if that ingredient had been omitted from the menu, I would have gone nuts trying to figure out what it was. Our main courses were great too, a wonderful Wild Striped Bass with fava beans and a nice appointment of mint, and a yummy Pan Roasted Pork Chop with ""young"" sour kraut. Initially both entrees gave me a knee-jerk reaction that they appeared small, portion wise, but I was wrong. Not only was everything we sampled tasty and excellent, the protions were spot-on, as I left satisfied and happily satiated! There was a slight ""lull"" between courses, which I fully expect and understand from a new place (working out the kinks), but both our server and hostess/manager were (pleasantly) all over it. Did I mention (in this diner's opinion) that LB's prices are more than fair? Bottom line; it's refreshing to find an eatery that stands by and showcases honest food. If this chef uses chic-n-trendy techniques to produce his/her food like; sous vide, liquid nitrogen, and pressure cookers, he/she certainly does not flex their culinary muscles bragging about it on the menu. Again, good-honest-food.Go there!",Left Bank,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New)"

Shared the pasta with mussels and shrimp and the grilled squid. First, the pasta was amazing. The tomato sauce was so fresh and light-- perfect for summer. The mussels and shrimp were cooked perfectly and went well with the round noodles. The grilled squid was also delicious-- it was perfectly cooked and not too chewy. The beans and sauce with the squid were great compliments and also really good. For desert, the maple syrup pie was a hit-- not too sweet but a great way to end the meal. We all loved this place-- great space and wonderful staff. Will definitley be back here soon!",Left Bank,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New)"

Finally decided to try it and took along 3 friends. The ambiance is lovely. Very well done. The seating arrangements have been well thought of - tables are not too close together - good use of space. Minimal decor. The waiter was really nice. The food was okay though. Small portions for sure. The trout was very sad looking and so was the pie. I expected a thick piece of pie with a good portion of ice cream on top. Glad I tried the place.

They also offer an amazing happy hour deal for frugal diners but the food is so good that full price would be worth it! As other reviewers have mentioned, the menu changes often.

We came into the city from Brooklyn last night, after Hurricane Sandy, and were driving through a darkened lower Manhattan -- there were few candles in the windows, and even fewer people in the streets -- positively post-apocalyptic! Then we stumbled upon Left Bank -- lit with candles, a lovely oasis. The host was dressed as Elvis (it was Halloween) and couldn't have been nicer. The place was so atmospheric with the candlelight. We had fantastic wine (a Spanish white for me that was very much like a Sauvignon Blanc) , and the kitchen was improvising meals with what I imagine was the food they had on hand, and the meals were wonderful.

254,KRHeAcg9YiYB0lOZAKmmXg,Leslie S.,4.0 star rating,"I wanted to try this place because it looked so adorable in pictures and I love the neighborhood. I made a reservation on a Monday night at 8 and when we walked in the place was pretty empty. This space is one of those doomed restaurant spaces and I feel bad for this place because it's absolutely lovely. We were greeted at the door and our waiter gave us a cozy booth in the back. They print the menu daily based on what's fresh at the market so it's small, but everything we had was excellent. The bread they serve with very good olive oil to start is fresh and perfectly crusty. We decided to start with cocktails, me a Manhattan, my date, a gin Martini and both were very well made. So many of the starters sounded good that we ordered a bunch of them and never really got around to ordering any entrees. We started with an heirloom tomato & watermelon salad, basil, Moroccan olives. This salad was really interesting. The olives balanced the sweetness of the watermelon and I thought it was fantastic. We also ordered the baby beet salad, pine nuts, fresh herbs, vinaigrette. Now I don't even like beets, an unfortunate childhood incident involving a boat and the flu, but these beets were so tasty. The salad was slightly overdressed but great none the less. The only thing that we ordered that I was not a fan of was the sauteed calamari salad, broccoli, cucumbers & chili. I love grilled calamari but the broccoli was not really working, it was overcooked and actually the calamari did taste a bit off to me.  The burrata, sweet & sour eggplant was incredible, what little I actually tasted before my date scarfed it all down. We couldn't resist ordering the homemade sausage. We chose the kielbasa at our waiters recommendation and it was served with sweet cabbage and was perfect. The drinks are large so we didn't feel like we could handle an entire bottle of wine. They only have 2 reds by the glass. We initially tried the Barbera and were not fans so we went with the monastrell which was perfectly lovely. All in all this was a very nice dinner. The atmosphere is cute, the service was impeccable, the portions are large and the ingredients are fresh and interesting. I hope this place makes it because it really is a neighborhood gem.",Left Bank,4.0 star rating,$$$,"American, (New)"
