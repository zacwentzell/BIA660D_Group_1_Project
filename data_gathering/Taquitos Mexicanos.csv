To me, it's like the cherry on top of these tacos. Most taco carts I've been to use packaged, store bought tortillas they warm up. It's a small process but makes a huge difference in taste and texture of the tacos. The meats are seasoned very well while not being too salty or spicy. They also have homemade hot sauces available. Watch out, the red one is hot!  Service is quick, and cooks are very polite and welcoming. Also available to drink that makes this a very authentic experience are Mexican imported sodas in glass bottles such as Coca Cola and Jarritos. Overall I say definitely give this place a try.  It's tasty, authentic, and one of the best food cart experiences you'll ever have.
