Freshest Italian food you'll find. My mother always said, the better the food, the less you should mess with it. And this place rights that belief. Simple simple foods done beautifully.

The bread/olives at the table were a nice touch.  Charging for each iced tea refill is a bit on the cheap/tacky side.  I hate when places do this for soda and iced teas.

Again, so many hearty veggies; mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus, zucchini and yellow squash.Penne Chicken Alfredo - my boyfriend's must when we go to any Italian restaurant. He can't compare anything to this. I also love it to dip my bread in (that's my small tolerance to alfredo sauce in general).They also provide a basket with italian and foccaccia breads. It's so fresh and served with olive oil. We've never been here for lunch, but I have a feeling it gets quite a crowd with all of the agencies in the area. They have a nice bar with TV's too.

I'm not surprised that it does not have a ton of reviews, given the location... probably not the funnest spot to head to at night when there's more robust areas!I work right nearby to the location so I find myself coming for lunch here during the work day. It's fairly quiet in the afternoon hours and this makes it a good location to sit down and make conversation with your party. The service has been great in my few times coming here so far- they greet well and are very accommodating. Absolutely no complaints. I tend to stick to the pasta dishes when I come here... so far, so good! You will find the types of dishes that are typically served in Italian restaurants. I tend to stick to the chicken parm or the chicken alfredo - both are pretty tasty and are done just right.Decor is nice and they have plenty of seating available.

7,WIYRnrwFiE4C8ubiXGt6LQ,Ben W.,2.0 star rating,"I went to PJ's for a work lunch function. We had a large party, so it was understandable that service would be a little slower than normal. However, not only was it hard to get our server's attention to place orders and get more water, they had to double and triple check some people's orders because they had forgotten to write it down. After placing our orders, we also has a long wait for our appetizers, then another long wait for our entrees. It ended up being a 2 hour lunch, which is kinda ridiculous, especially since we all had to go back to work right away.I ordered the Mozzarella in Carrozza appetizer and Sea Scallop Scampi. It was my first time having carrozza, so I didn't have any expectations. The presentation was a little weird. It literally looked like a toaster strudel, but instead of icing, they melted a cup of butter and poured it on top. It tasted okay, although the breading was a little heavy on the cheese and the lemon sauce was pretty sour. I love mozzarella, but not a fan of this dish.The entrees were also mediocre. My dish only had 5 scallops, which was disappointing. Also, the sauce, like the appetizer, was extremely sour. I have a high tolerance for sour, but I was puckering multiple times as I struggled to get through the pasta. The scallops were big but nothing to rave about. Overall, not a great dish. And for the price, the portion was pretty small.Not impressed with the food, flavors, or service. Definitely won't be back, despite the proximity to my office.Pros: adds variety to the areaCons: slow service, bad flavor combinationsDishes to try: Not sureDishes to skip: Sea Scallop Scampi, Mozzarella in Carrozza",PJ Charlton,3.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Wine, Bars"

I was in and out in way under and hour which was great, but it also seems like you can linger as long as you want to. I had the butternut squash soup and chicken parm.

And when I say hidden, I'm referring to the fact that it's literally situated across the street from UPS loading docks and outdoor parking garages. Ah, that lovely no-man's-land known as the South Village.However, I stand by my appointed gem status for this old-school Italian joint. Sure, PJ Charlton, by name, may sound like your friendly, neighborhood Irish pub, but in actuality, this Greenwich St. establishment happens to serve up some of the best Eggplant Parmigiana this town has got to offer. And I understand - this is not exactly a statement to be taken lightly in New York City. Layer upon layer of delicious eggplant form a giant block of an entree covered in marinara sauce and then blanketed with home-made mozzarella. It's as simple as it sounds, but the taste is second to none. And truth be told, I'm not even that crazy about our purple-skinned, ovoid fruit friend, but here it's prepared fork-able, fleshy, and in perfect harmony with its fellow ingredients. Listed as ""truly a house specialty"" on their menu, well - PJ ain't messin' around.Their Mozzarella in Carrozza is a great appetizer, as well, accented nicely by a white wine caper sauce. I can also attest to their fish specials, hand-selected fillets that arrive from market-to-kitchen-to-table daily. One black cod entree in particular had me wishing my dish would never end. Yes, I get food anxiety like that. A lot.While the decor at PJ Charlton is as simple as their offerings (however, without such satisfying result), it has an almost shore-side atmosphere that is somehow still endearing in its own right. Meanwhile, the service can be a little hit or miss. I've seen members in my party essentially be berated for requesting milk in their coffee, because that's ""not how it's served in Venice"".

I didn't receive more than the answer ""because you corrupted them"".  I don't understand how anyone could blame their customers for accepting a drink ""on us""  when they are consistent customers who have done nothing but support the establishment.  I've never been so disappointed and disrespected in my life.   Any ""buybacks"" I received I paid for above and beyond in tips (which I'm sure he reaped the benefits of).  On top of all of this, he had the nerve to ""threaten"" my job.  In my state of confusion, I mentioned that I will be talking with my coworkers about this and that it may influence whether or not they choose to eat there.  He retaliated with ""if you still have your job....I know people over there"".  Bottom line, the food here is incredible and the bartenders (if they still work there) are great, but the management is apparently not what it seems.

I didn't receive more than the answer ""because you corrupted them"".  I don't understand how anyone could blame their customers for accepting a drink ""on us""  when they are consistent customers who have done nothing but support the establishment.  I've never been so disappointed and disrespected in my life.   Any ""buybacks"" I received I paid for above and beyond in tips (which I'm sure he reaped the benefits of).  On top of all of this, he had the nerve to ""threaten"" my job.  In my state of confusion, I mentioned that I will be talking with my coworkers about this and that it may influence whether or not they choose to eat there.  He retaliated with ""if you still have your job....I know people over there"".  Bottom line, the food here is incredible and the bartenders (if they still work there) are great, but the management is apparently not what it seems. Watch out getting too friendly with the staff, the management might get jealous.",PJ Charlton,3.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Wine, Bars"
34,9RWWpr71LJN46ZWp1AHcYA,susie a.,2.0 star rating,"The chicken parmesan was very good but they gave me fettucine instead of spaghetti.  You may think pasta is pasta but I don't like the feel of fettucine anymore than I would want shells or bow tie pasta. I asked if they have spaghetti and they said no but they could go to the store and get it. Huh?? I had no time to wait for this. Who ever heard of an Italian restaurant that doesn't stock spaghetti? I seriously would go back because I loved the chicken, cheese, sauce but they have to have spaghetti so maybe I'll call and ask first.",PJ Charlton,3.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Wine, Bars"
35,5Nq3YGFlqRp1AqN1B7WpWg,Charles P.,1.0 star rating,Had lunch there with nine other business associates because it was conveniently located to our office. Very disappointed. Only good part of lunch was the bread basket. Had the shrimp soup to start and it was bland and the shrimp were like rubber. Ordered a chicken and sausage special and the chicken was dry and overlooked. Biggest problem with the place is their tomato sauce.,PJ Charlton,3.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Wine, Bars"
36,fZoMQq9sBTM2IKN6qk-jgg,Joanne L.,3.0 star rating,"Everytime my co-workers and I head to PJ Charlton's, we make bets on how empty the place is going to be. On a Friday night, this place is lucky to have 5 patrons and it is due to the god-awful location of this place.  It is practically hidden on Greenwich street, right across a vast UPS facility.  It is a shame really, because the food isn't that bad. Forgettable yes, but good enough.  I sometimes head here if it's a fri night and I need a quiet, last minute place to have dinner without having to deal with waiting or the hassle of parking.",PJ Charlton,3.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Wine, Bars"

38,fPXic9h3JHy8Ec7zn6OOnQ,Richard A.,1.0 star rating,"We went to this restaurant with a $25 gift certificate that was offered the restaurant from restuarant.com.  It clearly stated we had to purchase a minimum of $45 of food.  We planned what we'd order to come up to that minumum.  The waitress took our order and then, surprisingly asked us if we'd be paying by a certificate.  (That's surprising because usually wait staff is given these certificates when paying the check.)  We showed her the certificate.  She informed us that the minimum food order for this was $50.  We showed her where it stated $45.  She informed us that restaurant.com has their policy and her manager has his and we'd have to spend $50 to use the certificate.  We showed it to her again that it said $45.  Now, it's not the $5 that matters, it's the principle.  We bought her restaurant's coupon and they weren't honoring it.  We left after ordering soft drinks only.  We didn't touch them and she wanted us to pay for them.  The whole experience was laughable except for the fact that we were literally the only patrons in the whole place which says it all!  The next day restaurant.com appologized and made good on it but we won't be back to this place ever again.",PJ Charlton,3.0 star rating,$$,"Italian,, Wine, Bars"
