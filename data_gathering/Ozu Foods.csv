The service is perfect we had green tea that was piping hot and were offered more hot water as needed.The food is excellent my wife had a bento box with sashimi, I had a sashimi plate with an eel roll, the sashimi was perfectly cut and nice and chunky and at the right temperature most places serve it cold, the eel roll was equally good. My wife was very happy with her bento lots of different vegetables and the same sashimi, there was a slightly pickled fish I think it was Spanish mackerel that was awesome.Conclusion I walked up from Hoboken and will do so again, well worth the trip, go if you like very authentic Japanese food but if in doubt ask about strong tasting fish as I know it's not everyone's taste.",Ozu Foods,4.0 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

So my hubby's been sick and stuck at home most of the week, so I decided to take him out to a nice dinner in The Heights. I chose Ozu because what he needed was a restorative, healthy meal to lift the spirit and engage the senses. And that's what we both got at this local Japanese spot on Hutton and Central.Our food was so good! It was fresh and flavorful. Here, the food is about quality of ingredients versus quantity. Nutritious and delicious, you feel physically better after eating the food here. We left happy and feeling good. We ordered a pot of green tea to begin. Then I got the Big Eye Tuna Poke Bowl and my dude got the Vegan Bento. My poke bowl tasted amazing; it's the best poke I've had. My guy loved the vegan bento and said he would order it again. He loved best the eggplant and tofu item on the menu that was included in the bento. We were lucky that no one else was dining in. There is only one two-person table and a ledge that fits about four people, I think? It appears to me that Ozu makes most of its sales from take-out/pick-up. A few regulars dropped by to place take out orders or called their orders in for pick-up. We could tell the customers were local regulars because of the conversations they had with the owners. The owners were very friendly. The female owners was super friendly to us. She was so nice and made the dining experience even better. We hope to come back again to try out the other menu items. I recommend you try Ozu, too!",Ozu Foods,4.0 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Since it was really late and the chef kinda seemed annoyed I didn't want to order something that would take too long to make. I went with two sushi rolls just to kinda try something and not be annoying. Which to be honest was disappointing on my end because it really took away from my experience, but I get it when its late you just wanna head home. I ordered their spicy tuna roll and the beef curry roll. Both were really good, sizes of the pieces were a little off I'm assuming more because the chef seemed like kind of done for the day. I couldn't wait to go home and try them. This place is definitely small one table for 2 and long table by the window that has 4 stools. They delivery on seamless but was told that its usually about 45 minute wait. Its probably best to order and pick up. The menu definitely seems to a great variation on their dishes I cant wait to try other meals. The lady who takes the orders and manages the front was really sweet and delightful.

40,PjzYJ7VUyT_X0YSzX_lSSA,S M.,1.0 star rating,"The quality of Ozu's food is fine, but their cook / owner is dreadful. We've been loyal customers for the past year and didn't have any issues until last night. They made a mistake with our delivery order -- giving us a sushi platter instead of a sashimi platter. It was no big deal at first, so we called Ozu directly to let them know but no one answered. We had to work through Fastboy Delivery, which was great about trying to fix the issue and make sure we were happy.After Fastboy contacted Ozu, the Ozu cook / owner demanded we return the sushi they mistakenly sent us to get the correct sashimi platter. Our group was already sitting down to eat, and the mistaken portion of the order was packaged with other items, so what were we to do? What kind of restaurant would ask a customer who received a mistaken delivery to return raw fish, delaying, short-changing and basically ruining our $100+ dinner?We, along with the people at Fastboy, were appalled at how childish and petty the cook / owner was behaving. They could have simply said ""keep what you have, and we'll discount the bill accordingly, or enjoy what's already on your plate, and we will bring along the sashimi asap. Which would you prefer?"" While we ultimately got what we ordered an hour or so later with a gift certificate which we guess was some kind of apology, we received a call directly from the cook / owner at about the same time. He was quite combative from the start, making it seem like we did something wrong. When we shared our frustration with his actions, he berated us and said we could never order food from Ozu again. He literally banned us from the restaurant. It was like a scene out of a Seinfeld Soup Nazi episode -- ""NO SUSHI FOR YOU!!""  Several hours later, he kept the fight going with a late-night text trying to harass us. Seriously. Anyway, we hope they get their act together so others don't have similar experiences. Their hostile actions and attitude ruined our meal and put a damper on our evening.

We also got a spicy tuna roll and a tuna sandwich roll thingy. SO EXCITED were we (hint #2 - do not get to excited) once we placed the order online (which was very user friendly) Before I continue - someone posted a picture of salmon on rice that they ordered for their 5 year old, and they LOVED it!When I opened my bento box...that piece of salmon.. fit for a tiny 5 year old tummy? Yeah that sized salmon was staring right back at my face from my sad bento box.  It mocked me and my excitement. It was tasty, do not get me wrong.. but I WAS HONGRAY and crushed that thing in 5 bites. I had to take my time chewing because I wanted the moment to last!There was a cucumber salad in my box. I had about 6 thin slices of cucumber. Come ON GUYS! how much is cucumber?!?!? Are we on a cucumber shortage that I do not know about? If you are going to put in a tiny piece of protein, make it up with the fluff! MAKE ME FULL! My guy literally LAUGHED at my box (heyoh) and loved on his very tasty rib. (I only eat seafood, and I could still tell it was a better choice)The Spicy tuna roll (Hint #3 - this is not a sushi place) was not spicy nor smelled like tuna I should be eating raw. YES I ATE IT BECAUSE I WAS HONGRAY! DO NOT JUDGE!!! But I could only get 3 pieced down. The bf finished it and shrugged at the empty plate. It honestly tasted like rice. We were pretty much yawning at that roll... yes.. I am saying it was so bland it made us tired. The tuna sandwich? Neither of us could finish it. It was like a huge sushi roll, I see what they were trying to do there.. But it was like a tuna salad shoved in rice. I put sriracha on it and the guy said *Dawn - this is a sriracha tuna sandwich*. I was puzzled, looked back down at the receipt and yep.. I think they forgot the sriracha and the *sandwich* part because the tuna glob was on top of the rice more than inside.Did I hate the place? NoWill I go back? NoIt was just... *eh*If I want what they are trying to accomplish, I would just go to the places who have better established what they are doing, if that makes sense. I think this place is still finding itself and I am too hungry and picky to go back and hope they figured themselves out.",Ozu Foods,4.0 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
43,e5BWzwTC9GfelpcIrzIpRQ,Yan M.,3.0 star rating,"Glad to see more small businesses open up in the Heights. Saw all the great reviews and decided to go check it out. Conveniently located right off of Central Ave. No table seating, a few seats along the window. Open kitchen so you can see them make all your food. Heard great things about the ribs and was hesitant to get them since they were $4 per rib. Looks like they make one batch for the day and keep it in the fridge along with the salads. Asked chef how I should heat up the ribs before consumption and was told to microwave them. For $4 per rib, I expected it be amazing and unfortunately it was a let down. It was just okay, nothing special. Won't be getting them again.Also got two different salads, the Hijiki quinoa salad ($5 for small) & the sauteed kale 7 grains salad ($4 for small). They had good flavor. I personally think many of the items on the menu are overpriced for the area, the food was good but nothing amazing. Won't be getting the ribs again.",Ozu Foods,4.0 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

Could have used a little more beef cubes but I thought it still contained an adequate amount for the portion. The place itself is very tiny and not really a dine in place because only a few people can sit and eat so I'd recommend takeout or delivery. Might go back again and try different items off the menu.

The noddles in this dish were very delicate, despite being the typical thick udon style.

58,0WzT84TJm-3uPMO3OKYS8g,Sasha G.,2.0 star rating,"I don't think I can justify paying about $26 for a sashimi/sushi combination. Why? Well first, I'm in the Heights. Second: the place is super small and you can't really eat in comfortably so it feels much more like a take-out spot than anything else. The customer service also wasn't that great, strange energy in the place. The chef seemed to be in a bad mood, frowning mostly. I mean I'm ok with people not being happy go lucky but when you're cutting my fish... well, smile bro. And lastly (and most importantly) the sushi and sashimi were subpar. Though I am no sashimi expert, I know enough to know that the fish was slightly butchered. Despite the salmon being fresh the other fish (tuna, and two others I really couldn't identify) was less than fresh and one was quite fishy. I relied on the sushi to be my saving grace but again it fell short. The seaweed was extremely chewy and the tuna portion was too small for each piece. For a roll that cost $9 each it certainly is NOT worth it. It's never a good feeling to pay so much for something so dissatisfying but in the future if I am  ever in the mood for sushi I will steer clear of Ozu.",Ozu Foods,4.0 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

The second time, both the tuna poke and the potato croquette were not as good as the first time.Last night, I ordered again hoping the 2nd time was a fluke, but last nights order was even worse than the previous.The tuna poke was without the kale salad topping and had far less of the cucumber topping..and FAR less tuna...which was fine because the tuna was NOT good. it was cut into huge chewy (eeew) chunks, and wasnt that fresh. It was topped with mostly a bland green, not sure what it was. Even the rice wasn't great.The second dish was the steak bento box. The steak was tasty but really chewy and rather tough and unpleasant. the veggies etc. were bland.I'm not sure what happened here, but with the high prices, I don't think I will be ordering from here for awhile.I hope they step it up, because I want places like this to succeed in my hood, but in the heights, it is going have to be consistently good for people to be willing to pay the big bucks.",Ozu Foods,4.0 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

74,dhKGMu318fc0v5pbeAGv5g,John S.,5.0 star rating,"A gastronomical sensation tucked away in JC Heights. Ozu Foods is the rarest of finds--expertly prepared Japanese comfort food, imaginative, delicate and above all, intensively flavorful. The proprietor-chef is classically trained and previously owned a highly-regarded bistro on the Lower East Side. The care and thought he puts into each dish is evident with the first bite. The space is quite small and take-out seems to be dining choice for most. Still, if you want a truly delightful gourmet experience, grab a bottle of pinot, or a six-pack of craft beer and seat yourself at one of the four bar stools lining the front window or the table for two by the counter. The simple, one-page menu is deceptively varied with a thoughtful mixture of sushi, vegetable dishes, proteins and starches. Our favorites: Spicy tuna roll. My Japanese wife marvels at Ozu's version of this sushi mainstay for not only the freshness of the ingredients but also the quality of the rice, and the fact that it's served at the perfect temperature--a telltale sign of a good Japanese restaurant. Unagi cucumber roll is equally delicious.Any vegetable dish on the menu or in the display case. Creative, fresh, clean and flavorful. Try the baby bok choy with garlic, ginger and a bit of chili, or the two-cabbage salad with miso and peanuts. The potato croquette is light and fluffy inside but with a marvelous crust on the outside. Chicken yuan-yaki is a treat, especially if you eat in and get to watch and hear it being prepared. Beautifully trimmed and marinated, it goes into a hot skillet for flame-assisted searing before being finished in the oven with garlic and scallions. Really hungry? Try the Japanese style ribs. Large, juicy and bursting with flavor. Well done, Ozu Foods, and see you again soon.",Ozu Foods,4.0 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

94,mC-lCee8STVyjO8EE8N-0A,Drew C.,4.0 star rating,This is the first Japanese resturant I have seen in the heights so I was happy they opened up. I tired the ramen with a potatoe croquet on the side an it was great. The next day I went back for a beef bento was not really impressed. I will jisy stick to the ramen. I find the prices to be slightly high for the neighborhood this is defintely a place for the yuppies. But like I mentioned I am glad we have something besides plain chinese joints on the Ave now (I guess the yuppie invasion has at least one benifit.),Ozu Foods,4.0 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
95,T69btMBaaD76jlpK0Pznmg,Gerard J.,1.0 star rating,"I was really excited when this place opened up, but really disappointed with the sushi. The rolls were mostly rice, and they were falling apart. On one side of the roll it was seaweed paper and the other a ball of rice. There was hardly any fish in the rolls. It was almost as if the person making the rolls had never done it before. I really wanted to see this place succeed, and I hope you take my criticism with stride. I would love to turn this review into 5 stars. I would recommend hiring a good sushi chef.",Ozu Foods,4.0 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"

97,xOn4qGYnFukiYvpUFUTHdw,M L.,1.0 star rating,"I usually don't write reviews on Yelp but I am hoping that the owners of Ozu may see this. We ordered takeout/delivery last night for the first time. We had been meaning to check out Ozu since they opened and were excited to finally order, especially since we had heard such great things. We were incredibly disappointed in our food. I'm not sure if this was a fluke, because as I read reviews everything I see is very positive. However our experience was not. First of all, everything was ice cold. (Perhaps that was the delivery services fault.)We ordered the ramen which was bland, the broth had no flavor at all and the noodles were a clumpy overcooked blob.  My 16 year old son (who eats anything) ordered the beef curry udon and ate a third of it, as it had barely any beef and no flavor. We also ordered the Japanese ribs (it was one) which although was very large, it was ice cold. The soft shell crab may have been the only partially edible thing we got, although it too was cold, had no flavor and was over cooked. Needless to say, I don't think we will be ordering from Ozu again. Sorry to say that as we want to support new restaurants in the Heights.",Ozu Foods,4.0 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
98,Es3M9YgP50xlCSq16gvGow,J H.,5.0 star rating,Incredible ribs. Delicious soup. Fish is FRESH. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. The chef is cooking right before your eyes! Counter help is very hospitable. Wide range of food and moderate prices. High Quality vegetarian options. The review slamming the sushi is puzzling. I have had lots of the rolls here. No complaints. Quite the contrary.,Ozu Foods,4.0 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
99,pjFy1sboaw4l_MMhZGzr7w,Chris A.,5.0 star rating,"Awesome new take out addition for the Heights. Food is all tasty and fresh, and nothing is over salted/seasoned. Ramen is best option out of anywhere in JC area (we've tried them all) and full of fresh ingredients. Beef curry is absolutely delicious. Hijiki and quinoa salad was a novel blend of textures and flavor. Sushi is ok, as were the ribs, but not sure the timing was perfect for take out (a little dry and cold), which is to be expected. Try then, and support local business heights residents!",Ozu Foods,4.0 star rating,$$,"Japanese,, Sushi, Bars"
