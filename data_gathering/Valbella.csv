3,lD-X5jP0vDUYrEKRLbRSHw,Caroline H.,1.0 star rating,"This used to be my favorite restaurant but after my experience last night I'm not sure if I'll ever go back .This restaurant was always delicious ! I loved coming here with my husband for let's say the last 4-5 years . My favorite dish was the filetto Manzo Ripieno. Filet mignon pounded flat and baked into a puff pastry . Absolutely delicious ! Last night we decided to go out for my first nice dinner since having a 6 pound tumor cut out of my uterus . We were thinking about going to Del Friscos but chose to come to Valbella instead since it was always one of our favorites . We sat at the table where our unpleasant experience began with our rude , condescending waiter who was just pure misery . So maybe I wasn't dressed to the nines like I normally am but pardon me I just had major abdominal surgery and I'm still pretty uncomfortable . I was wearing dark pants and a nice sweater with boots , classy and comfortable but not over the top . My husband and I had to ask what the specials were since our waiter didn't tell us about them . He also didn't offer us the wine list which when we asked for he gave us a confused look with raised eyebrows. I mentioned my favorite dish the filetto Manzo Ripieno and the waiter laughed at me . Yup . Laughed at me . He said "" ha ha ha ha that's funny we haven't had that and years and we don't make it anymore so you'll have to get something else."" WOW ! Ironically the last time we dined at Valbella and had a normal pleasant waiter who was kind , he said "" let me check with the chef to see if we can make the dish for you Bella."" The waiter came out and apologized and said because they were so busy they could not. That was totally amazing because I wasn't expecting them to make it I was just saying that it's my favorite dish there . The waiter brought the manager over who told me to call the restaurant next time before were coming in and he could have the chef prepare it for me. I thought that this was such a kind gesture and that both the waiter in the manager went above and beyond. I would never call the restaurant to request this but I just found it to be baffling how I was treated last night by this rude waiter. He was so condescending when he was speaking to us it was almost as if he was speaking to us in a way that we didn't belong there. When I go out to dinner and I spend $400-$500 on a meal I expect to be treated kind and with respect not being spoken to in a condescending manner. We ate our entrées and I didn't even want to finish our bottle of wine because I was so angry with the entire experience. I don't know if we'll ever be coming back to this restaurant which is a shame because it used to be one of our absolute favorites. People who work in the restaurant and hospitality business should have a little bit more common sense and common courtesy because they never know who they're dealing with , or what they may be dealing with. Really made us leave with a bad taste in our mouth .",Valbella,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Italian,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Steakhouses"

I guess that's  the kind of people that  go to this place. I would never go back here again. For the money you can go anywhere in NYC, where the food, service and ambiance is top notch. This place is neither of the 3.   I read nothing but positive reviews of this place but unfortunately the people that wrote positive reviews on this place are not Italian or of Italian decent because any true Italian would not even consider this quality food and for the price you are being robbed.

Expected the bread to be better, to be honest, for an Italian restaurant.We thought it was too dark in the restaurant.  We had to get our phones out like senior citizens in order to see the menu.  And there were several large parties there so it didn't seem to fit the ambiance. If you're going for a special occasion, but aren't looking to make it a $300 visit, then I'd suggest   getting a cocktail somewhere before you go and get dessert elsewhere.  We had 2 mixed drinks each and that set us back $76. Desserts not worth $20 each.  My husband ordered vanilla ice cream and he received 4 ping pong-ball-sized scoops.  The Napoleon was good, but the pastry was burned so it wasn't great.  We would definitely return, but we'd spend our money on the entrees and salad.  I had the Endive salad and he had the Valbella salad.  Entrees were Pappardelle w/Bolognese and Farfalle with artichoke hearts and a few other things that were delish.

We started with some pinot noir wine and later added a bottle of Malbec.  We split a bunch of appetizers at the table, including Carpaccio Di Manzo: Thin sliced filet mignon  over arugla.with cheese. It was a pretty large serving, and good for an appetizer.  We also got a big seafood sampler that included oysters and some lobster pieces. It was well enjoyed by the table. For my entree I went with the  Black Angus Filet Mignon, The menu called it a generous filet, but honestly I found it quite small in size, and for $50 dollars a bit of a dissapiontment. While it tasted fine, I wasn't impressed with it and didnt feel it was cooked too evenly. The roasted potatoes and julienne vegetables were nice additions. Still, overall I rate this place highly because of the fast/efficient service and the atmosphere here. The round circular tables were nice to have conversations with everyone.

The combination was pretty good but there was perhaps too much vegetables and the appetiser does fill you up pretty fast.Fried Calamari - Yummy!! Loved it.Chilean Sea Bass - cant remember the exact ingredients in this one since it was a daily special. (i think there was some chick pea, some puree, and some vegetables with a roasted tomato)  the fish was nicely cooked and i definitely did enjoy this dish. However, the portion was too large. I'm not sure if this was because the appetiser really filled me up or the fish slice was too large. Napoleon  dessert - Highly recommended. Loved the crispness of the crust and the almond silvers. We hard to order this before the main course was served since they take 45min to make this. It was very light, and large enough to serve 5 people. Chocolate souffle - It was decent but not very special. Also a little too sweet imo. Would probably not come back again since there are so many restaurants in the neighborhood to check out.

The staff was extremely patient even as I changed the number of guests the day of the event and requested that they seat the party (and serve them appetizers/ alcohol/ bread) 30 minutes before the birthday boy came.The customer service and the food (almost all of the food) here was delicious!! There were ten of us so I can only speak on the heavenly white truffle linguini, flavorful fried calamari, and fresh sea bass. The calamari and linguini were definitely big hits - one of the best I've had for each.After dinner, the received an assortment of desserts and gosh was I in heaven. We had creme brûlée, chocolate lava cake, tiramisu, and a few other dishes that I can't even remember. And the staff helped our table sing happy birthday. Everything was delicious! The restaurant itself is beautiful and  elegant. I would have given 5 stars but they forgot our oysters and one person at our table ordered the fish special and said it was tough and flavorless.I will definitely return and I highly recommend it to anyone!",Valbella,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Italian,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Steakhouses"

Well dressed pretty hostesses, polished waiting stuff.I couldn't make up my mind on what chair to seat when we were offered a table for two in a corner, so a manager gave us a big round table (tailored for 6) because it had just became free. Nice gesture indeed. I have momentarily noticed how quick the service was. Every order happened to be performed in a perfect operational manner! Drinks were on the table within a minute. Food has arrived promptly too. I had a Seafood Risotto, which was a big and delicious potion! Took half of it home. Tables are elaborately set with cutlery and different types of wine glasses. The place is big and spacious. Absolutely enjoyable experience! 2. Went here for the second time last week on Friday night. Surprisingly there were so little people. I just wanted to point out that it would be nice to serve tea in a teapot and preferably without a tea bag, but real tea leaves, because this restaurant comes across as very trendy. This would be more suitable.And twice during the dinner I felt as a/c was set on a low temperature so I got cold.

90,-yI9oYagi8uXpwfzitp6hA,Rowena Y.,3.0 star rating,"Decent quality comes at a price but it can easily be downgraded by the money making machines (aka corporate dinners). The ""$$$$"" doesn't mean the food is heaven. In fact, I don't think the food here really deserve to cost that much. So I came here tonight  for a team dinner. There was a 3 course meal, which consisted of a pasta, salad and main entree course. The pasta course was a mix between penne alla vodka and meat rigatoni. Salad was a combination of Caesars salad and some awfully tasting endives, caramelized pears with blue cheese (and I HATE blue cheese). For the main entree, I ordered  the Chilean sea bass with mashed potatoes. Out of all the courses, I enjoyed the Chilean sea bass the most, although I wish it was a little crispier and flakier. It was a bit dry for my taste. I don't know what was going on with the endives salad but everyone on my table agreed that it did not taste good. By the end of the courses, we had our order of Souffles. The best part of the Souffle was the crust. It was light and not too sweet as it should be.  Service is just ok. The waiters are old school and they just want to get you out of there asap. On the other hand, drinks are great. They have an impressive wine selection. They are also deceptively good at putting these lights on the wall in the seating area that makes you feel like it's still bright and early outside but in reality, it's already 11pm and you still going at it for another round of drinks. Overall, the food and service is mediocre. I was expecting something more unique but I  was disappointed to see it has fallen into the trap of being monetarily fed by corporate patrons.My fellow yelper, RIcky M. can give you his other perspective.",Valbella,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Italian,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Steakhouses"

Elva was a pleasure to deal with in coordinating this dinner. She made it so easy and  the dinner was a hit b/c of her expertise! The waiters were such a pleasure to interact with and truly know what their doing. Sonny and Onder are rare finds with their old school hospitality! I was so impressed by them and by the reviews from my boss and the people who attended the dinner that I made a reservation to celebrate my birthday there a few weeks later. My birthday dinner was amazing!!! Onder was my waiter and remembered me. He's such a gem! We had a few appetizers; one which was a special that night - mixed greens with burrata, tomato and artichoke on top of thinly sliced, melt in your mouth prosciutto. The artichoke was the best I've ever had. I don't know how they cooked it but it was delicious! We also enjoyed the diver sea scallops with asparagus (perfectly tender) and fried calamari and zucchini. We followed this with branzino and my personal favorite the filet mignon topped with a cajun lobster tail in a lobster bisque reduction with grilled asparagus. This was truly delectable. Sadly, I didn't order this plate but did get to sample it. The meal was delicious from start to finish. The service is impeccable! I can't say how much I love this place. They truly know what they are doing and know how to cook and serve food. I will absolutely being going back (and enjoying that filet mignon/cajun lobster tail all for myself) and will host another dinner party there!

All of the dishes were mediocre (short rib pasta was especially lackluster, tomato within the salad was tasteless. The lamb was the only solid dish). The only redeeming feature was the extensive wine list and the map of wine regions around the globe within the wine encyclopedia that Valbella offers.

I've eaten here twice, equally impressed both times.  Food choices: a large variety of Italian options, most everything tastes extremely fresh; pasta seems to be made in-house, or at least fresh-made daily outside; excellent bread, gratis; large portions of all entrees; and grandiose presentation of just about everything makes dinner a special occasion whether it was intended to be or not.This can be a romantic spot, but you must have the right table as it can and does get loud.  The second time here was with a group of 8-10 colleagues and the staff was as accommodating as could be, even arranging a special seating area upstairs at the last moment in order to have us drink and dine with them.  We were treated like royalty and again, food, drink, service all 4-5 stars.Very expensive dinner, easy to spend 75-100. per person, if not more, but worth every dollar if you can spare it.  I'd eat here again just to relive a great dining experience.",Valbella,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Italian,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Steakhouses"

It has a great ambiance. The restaurant was very upbeat and its patrons were a mix of professionals and other types of ""well-dressed"" affluent people. The mood was very festive which made this ""hot-spot"" a great place to be on a Tuesday night. Food:I expected the food to be as ""upbeat"" and classy as the restaurant's ambiance. It wasn't terrible, it was just ok. The food preparation was average as compared to the prices charged for the meal. In terms of price to quality it didn't make any sense.Wine List:I am a person who appreciates and knows wine. It was disappointing to see most of the wines were over $100 per bottle. One is almost ""forced"" to spend $100 or more for a bottle based on the variety and selections on the list. There should be a certain percentage of good wines available that are under $100.Service:The service was ""ok"". My criteria ""ok"" means it was average, the basic job was done. The waiter was absolutely clueless about the wine list. I found this a little odd based on the wines and prices charged for the wines. .I ordered a californian oaky Chardonnay to have with my dinner. The waiter returned with a Chablis stating that it was ""on special"" and was ""just as good"". For the record it wasn't ""just as good"" it's two absolutely different styles of wine even they made from the same grape. That fact, like the Chablis, left a bad taste in my mouth.Conclusion:I might come back to the restaurant for its ambiance and special atmosphere but not anytime soon.",Valbella,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Italian,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Steakhouses"

103,P2877CiCwF4SWeKgciLpeQ,Patrizia C.,5.0 star rating,"LUNCH REVIEWIncredible northern Italian cuisine finalized to perfection!The best restaurant in Meatpacking, a dapper high point. The ambience resonates the industrial, edgy environment at Meatpacking, without the current slickness. This place has class, when you enter, you can tell that the cuisine is supposed to stand out, nothing else and noting less. The service is very friendly, multi-lingual, committed and in it's manners, everything you wish for in such an upscale restaurant. They serve fresh Tuscan bread with very good olive oil. It's real Tuscan bread and a good first impression on what to follow: I ordered truffled pasta in creamy sauce as an appetizer, all pasta dishes are offered in antipasti sizes, like it is common in Europe. The pasta was fresh, cooked al dente and full of mouth melting truffle flavor. My entree was a sea bass on vegetables and green pesto. I'm not even exaggerating,it was the best fish I had in years! Very crispy on the outside, umami-ish juicy goodness packed inside. I finished the whole thing and every bite tasted like heaven. It was a special, but I would urge everyone to try it. Sensational...I couldn't leave without a desert and followed the recommendation of my lovely waiter (even though he was more then just that to me, we shared an very nice chat): creamy white chocolate, nut cake with vanilla ice cream. It was just enough to not overwhelm your tummy, just a few flavorful bites to round up the experience. Accompanied with a perfect espresso. I think, this is a perfect date spot at night, the lighting is very special and the experience very sensual overall.

This was followed by the veal chop, again done to perfection.  Grilled perfectly and slightly charred and smoky on the outside, so so juicy on the inside, accompanied by a medley of beautiful vegetables.

For $120 a plate, either there should have been more white truffle shavings or a dancing truffle-hunting pig. Neither materialized. The pasta was heavy with too much cream. It overwhelmed the food. It tasted like a jar of Classico Alfredo sauce was poured on my plate. The desserts are the real reason to come here. And only for the Napoleon. Service is very good but not excellent.

Indulged in the tuna tartare for an app which was scrumptious. The chicken and shrimp dish was tasty, but for $30+ I expected more. The ambiance was a little daunting - we were the only ones in there for lunch. Maybe because it was a summer Friday or because there was no outdoor seating, or diners are just more inclined to have dinner there. Service was on point, but maybe that was because we were the only table!!Valbella is a solid pick for good food in the MP district, with a convenient location, but not worthy of the price.",Valbella,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Italian,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Steakhouses"

The decor is grand and elegant, without being too flashy. The service is excellent and attentive. While this most recent meal had a few mistakes from the kitchen, they were quickly fixed and overall the food was superb. A dish as simple as a Caesar salad is elevated by beautiful presentation and a proper lettuce to dressing ratio. The veal capricciosa was perfect; perhaps the best I've ever had.

We took the help of the sommelier to help us choose a red and white for the table. We ended up with a sauvignon blanc and a pinor noir, which were very tasty. The waiter then supplied us with a long list of specials. Now onto the food:Apps:-Antipasto Freddo: a LARGE dish of deliciousness. Hands down, the buffalo mozzarella was the BEST I've ever had.-Oysters: standard and fresh-Carpaccio di Manzo:  I usually prefer a fish carpaccio over beef but no complaints here, it was very good.Entrees:-Medaglioni di Vitello Ai Funghi Ostriche: The veal was very tender. If you don't enjoy a lot of pepper, this dish isn't for you. It did well with my palate and the mushrooms were superb!-Linguine con Frutti di Mare: Also got to taste this and it was phenomenal! The pasta was freshly made and they were heavy handed with the seafood serving. A nice variety of seafood.Desserts:-Napoleon: This cake was HUGE! and it came out looking like two bricks stacked side by side. We asked ourselves and the waiter, how are we going to eat that? The waiter assured that the cake would shrink. Although, it never ""shrunk"", we knew what he meant when we tasted it. It was light, flaky and delicious!-We also had a coconut mousse type of dessert (not noted on their online menu) that reminded me of being on a beach with it's aroma.Overall, the food was very enjoyable.

My family threw their NYE party in 2000 there. My cousin held his engagement party at the Meat Packing location shortly after they opened. So when my boyfriend surprised me with a trip to NYC, I couldn't think of a more fabulous place to have dinner. I remembered how amazing their truffle cream sauce over penne was from the numerous events they catered to our family. When the waiter announced it was available as a special and we could have it as an appetizer, of course I did not hesitate to order. The waiter assured us that this was one of his favorites and mentioned ""he would add something special to it."" When it was delivered to the table he arrived with a truffle which he shaved over each of our dishes. Although it tasted like heaven on earth, I was perplexed when the bill arrived. The waiter charged us $60 for a $25 half order of pasta with truffle cream sauce because he added the truffle shavings. He took advantage of what he clearly thought to be tourists. His ability to be so unethical and slimy does not reflect on the entire Valbella Restaurant Group well. Tony the old maitre d would have never allowed this!

I wasn't prepared for how pricey it was but I had such a good time and the food was pretty damn good, so no complaints!  We shared a seafood special appetizer (combination platter of lobster, shrimp, crab) that was so amazing, I will never forget it. The lobster and shrimp were so fresh! I wound up getting the penne and vodka. Although it was excellent, I regretted not getting what my friend ordered-the special truffle pasta. I had a small taste and it was out of this world! Oh well the grass is always greener (; My friend then asked about the winding staircase and the upstairs area, as we figured it was an open bar. The waiter kindly asked if we wanted a tour. Without hesitation, we left the table and went up the winding staircase where a host gave us a tour of all the wine rooms that are rented out for parties. And of course we asked him to photograph us. He graciously did so. The atmosphere at Valbella was one of a kind! I had to laugh when I looked up this place and it said ""adult dining."" If you're still a little kid trapped in a big kid's body like me, you will most definitely feel more ""adultyyy"" at Valbella.

The architecture is fabulous, the wine selection unparalleled, the staff superb, and the food exquisite. We arrived early for a glass of wine at the bar and a walk around to enjoy the decor. After chatting with the owner, we made our way to a wonderful table near the light rushing in from the street. Fresh cheese and meats for an appetizer, followed by a burrata cheese special with peppers, arugula, and artichokes...simply delicious. Dinner specials for us included giant rigatoni in a wonderful sauce, and a huge branzino filet over a ridiculously generous amount of crab meat. Both were fantastic, and left me nearly speechless. Little did I know that speechlessness would be accomplished by the dessert. Neapolitan for two arrived and changed my life. The light pastry dough with layers of a vanilla mousse, covered in thinly sliced toasted almonds. We enjoyed a wonderful bottle of wine over the course of the evening, a delightful selection from the Barolo region. The wine selection is unbelievable and a treat in and of itself.Trust me when I tell you my descriptions do not do any of this justice...as such, you must try this for yourself.

I don't even know where to begin...1. Our reservation was for 8:30pm. We were told ""10 minutes, wait at the bar"" and were seated at 9:40! And only after I informed them we were leaving. Truth be told there was no recovery for this... but then it got worse:2. The bar was disappointing. There was no drink menu, and no specialty drinks whatsoever. They were out of basic ingredients on the first two standard drinks we ordered.3. When eventually they sat us, we had no menus. I pointed it out to the waiter almost immediately, and it was still almost 10 minutes before they gave us any. After our 70 minute wait, another 10 gobbling bread without ordering was salt on a wound.4. The place is loud. REALLY, REALLY LOUD. It isn't even the music so much as terrible acoustics. We had to scream our way through the bar and dinner because there was no other way to communicate. The waiters basically yelled at you, and I swear I only could actually here about 5 words of the entire specials monologue.5. After finally getting the menu and making a selection (venison), the waiter informed me that they were out. He couldn't have told me that upfront? We're now about an hour and a half in and I still haven't ordered. And let me tell you, this isn't the kind of restaurant you want to hang out in for an hour and a half just for kicks.6. I ordered medallions of fillet over polenta. After a very long wait, the food came out. I had ordered the fillet ""medium"". The first medallion was medium-rare, but I let it go since I was starving and since medium-rare is still okay with me. But when I finally carved into the second, it was rare. Not medium, not medium-rare, straight out rare. It went well with the hard, tasteless polenta they served it over.I considered complaining but by that point we were so unhappy and so tired we just asked for the bill and got out of that mayhem as fast as we could. Almost $200 for three drinks and two entrees, no apps or dessert and not even sides with the entrees. At that price-point, it should have been exceptional.

The foie gras came with scallops. Also we had the Napoleon for dessert which was Gooood but really big. At that point I was overstuffed and full but u forced myself to finish it because it was so good. Our waiter sonny gave us excellent service, very friendly.

At first, he seemed a little terrified. (He must know...I bite)I got the menu in my hot little hands and was elated!!  Everything sounded delicious and had me salivating like one of Pavlov's trusty pack members.  We settled on a fresh mozzarella appetizer and ordered our Lava Cake at this time because it takes 45 minutes to prepare. Our entrees were Valbella's BLT (delicious veal medallions on puff pastry topped with Mozz and fresh tomato...yum!) and the chicken stuffed with cheese in a cream/champagne sauce.  Now I love the bubbly so if you're going to include it in my entree well...SOLD!  Both dishes were delicious, well made and the right portion.

At the level they are pitching the restaurant, they should do better.  Also, to charge $25 for a glass of non vintage pink champagne is ridiculous.The only plus I can think of is that when both our wine choices were unavailable, the waiter gave us a better bottle for the price we would have paid.  Oh, and the atmosphere is nice.",Valbella,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Italian,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Steakhouses"

The service left much to be desired (from the restaurant itself to the actual wait staff).Had a reservation for 9:15pm, and didn't get seated until almost 9:45pm. After ordering, it took over an hour for the first plate of food to arrive. The whole time we were waiting, the waiter never came over to see if we wanted drinks (we had to try and flag him down, which was difficult with the restaurant being so loud). When my boyfriend ordered a beer, the waiter gave him a very snobby look and asked why he wasn't ordering wine instead. My boyfriend wanted to leave right then, as he was annoyed that the guy was actually questioning his order. After about 45 minutes, we asked our waiter how much longer until the food would be ready. His reply was a very rude ""It takes time to cook the food!!!"". When the food finally arrived, they only brought out a few plates at a time. I was with a group, and we didn't want to start eating until everyone had their plates. It was another 10 minutes before everyone was served, and the earlier ariving plates were already starting to get cold. Once we did start eating, they started rushing us out of there (the restaurant was apparently closing in a half hour). I got up to use the bathroom during dinner, and when I came back, my plate was gone (I was not done eating) and they had already taken dessert orders. When they brought the dessert plates to the table, they didn't even ask if anyone else wanted anything (a few of us had left the table when they took the initial dessert orders).

The bread served was accompanied with a long blonde hair of which my beautiful date and I have the opposite in color.  We were asked 3 times if we wanted to preorder dessert since it would take time but being that we haven't even perused the menu, it was difficult to assertain .The food mediocre but the bill was astronomical.  $240 w/o dessert . Oh ya when we ordered a bottle of wine it was MIA . As of decor if you like cold, concrete,from the cave man era stone feel, then you might just like it. The only good thing is I didn't get sick but then again  had a lot of Grey Goose after so it probably killed anything i had digested.",Valbella,4.0 star rating,$$$$,"Italian,, Venues, &, Event, Spaces,, Steakhouses"
