0,JqjtdewQEbvVUsB-6hSVQw,Tyler R.,5.0 star rating,"The Cuban is easily my favorite restaurant in Hoboken.There are a number of similar places between Jersey City, Hoboken, and Weehawken, but The Cuban tops them all.Happy Hour. To start your night the proper way, the happy hour menu has a laundry list of things that are $5. No, not just a few beers and some well drinks; legitimately their entire (or close to it) drink menu has everything priced at $5. Tonight I had the cuban version of a long island iced tea, which is just as strong as you'd think. Served with a thimble-sized about of coke in it, i'm pretty sure it was 98% alcohol. I also had a $5 mojito at 6:59pm (happy hour ends at 7, but on Mondays, classic mojitos are $5 all night) and a red sangria towards the end of dinner.On a mojito scale of 1-10, these come in at a solid 8. Not too sweet, nice and minty, and plenty strong. Any of the flavored ones will add some extra sugar, so if you want to go that route, the mango mojito is a great choice.Now that you're basically almost drunk, grab your table and put in a few apps. The guac is really good - not as good as the classic version you'd get in a Mexican restaurant, but the crabmeat on top is excellent and the plantain chips add just a little bit of extra salt, which works well. I would also recommend the tamal en hoja, camarones al ajillo, and empanaditas. Order another mojito, and thank your waiter or waitress feverishly for bringing over the rolls and butter to help soak up some of your happy hour. The rolls are tiny, but don't let that fool you, they are so dense and chewy (and delicious) that you need to be careful not to fill up on them before your main dish comes......Because now it's time for...EL CLASSICO. Every time I come here, I get it. Every time I come here, I say, ehhh, i'll get something different, broaden my horizons. Every time I come here, I pick something else. Every time I come here, I can't help but order El Classico. The pork falls off the bone, the yucca is swimming in garlic, the moro rice is one of my favorites, and the plantains are the sweetness that helps create that perfect bite. I love anything pickled, and while they are a very small part of the dish, the pickled red onions add the perfect amount of acidity to balance the whole dish out. Even thought I always get that, I have tasted other things -- the churrasco, the oxtail, bronzino, and ropa vieja. Everything is always excellent, so get whatever sounds good to you. But given I wrote a giant paragraph about it, consider El Classico if it at all appeals. Dessert? Bread pudding and churros. The BP is just the right amount of chocolatey without being overbearing, and the churros...stuffed with chocolate...yeah I don't have to say much more than that. The only slightly not five star thing is the reservation system - they aren't on OpenTable and you need to request a reservation online (or...gasp...call them), but those requests are generally confirmed the same day, so it's not a big deal.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

Although we were upset with the timing (next available 9PM) we were blow away with the service, food, and ambiance. Upon walking in we were greeted by a VERY busy hostess who sat us right away. The entire restaurant is large and in charge. The bar in the front of the house was a little rowdy, but we had a table in the back room that was very quaint. Service: A-. Attention to detail on all levels. However, I felt it odd when I asked one of the bussers what the white sauce was for our paella she said ""I know nothing about the food."" Kind of odd response. Food: A+. Flavor was out of bounds and it started with the crab/avocado dip with plantain chips! Wow. These were the definition of LIT. The other couple ordered the skirt steak that was big enough for two! We ordered the seafood paella. This was easily shared by two, and I wouldn't recommend ordered anything else. The seafood was fresh and the rice was cooked to perfection. I highly recommend the paella for 1st times to The Cuban. Bathroom: Up 3+ flights of stairs?! I may be a young stud, but how is this even a thing? Overall, we will be back!

Upon walking in, we were greeted by the host, who walked us to the second floor to our table. When you first look in, you wouldn't expect that there are more tables around the back and on the second floor!The food was amazing. The table bread comes with a garlic herb butter, which was delicious. We ordered a half pitcher of the Brazilian sangria, which had guava, lemon, strawberry and a few other fruits in it. The half pitcher was perfect for each of us to have a glass and a half each. We started our evening with their calamari, which was their special for the night. The spicy aioli that it came with was great and paired well with the saltiness of the calamari breading.For our entrees, I ordered the ropa vieja and my boyfriend ordered their pollo criollo. They were both so flavorful. My boyfriend surprised me with dessert and a birthday candle on the plate, which he told me he mentioned when he made the reservation.

But for the prices and environment they really should have a great waiting staff because that's as much a part of the restaurant as the food... Food : We ordered the Guacamole with crab which was okay but I wouldn't order again . They put very little crab meat and it really doesn't change the flavor  and for $17 for it to just taste like regular guacamole in my opinion is a waste unless you are having a serious craving for guacamole .Another surprise was that the Pollo Criollo ($22) dish was so much better than the Mar y Tierra ($29) dish and I really don't like chicken . Maybe it was the rice ?

There's an additional first floor dining area and a split floor with more. There's also a second floor. The bathrooms are on the third floor. The paella I order was decent, not a lot of saffron was used. There was a good amount of rice and some seafood. The other dish was the marinated churrasco, flavorful and cooked to the liking.The highlight of my weekend were the yuca rolls, freaking legit. They come out hot and fresh, slightly harden on the outside and moist and chewy inside.  It's served with garlic butter. Whaaaaaaat!

The Berejena which is the eggplant fries were delicious! Entree - I had the chef special - fish of the day which consisted of Red Snapper filet, asparagus, some type of potatoe like salad with a sweet purée - Mind blowing delicious!  And the Mar y Tierra which from my understanding was also amazing.Drinks - I had the mojito which was a little too strong for me and was missing the sugar cane stick.

18,mbxdo8Z59tcQc_FJMxHNeA,Trent T.,4.0 star rating,"Came in pretty early on a Saturday night. We made a reservation but there seemed to be plenty of seating both on the way in and on the way out. The front of the restaurant is a small bar and then unexpectedly opens up to a three tiered establishment in the back, I found it pretty interesting. The first impression of this place unfortunately for me was the volume inside. It was so loud to the point it was difficult to hear each other at the table. I could see this being desirable in some instances but it was a little troubling that night. On the contrary, our server was nice and very attentive and water and sangria were filled at all times. Which speaking of the sangria, they sure do pack quite a punch in it. I enjoyed it as I felt I get my money's worth, some may be turned off by it.For starters, we had the antojitos which was like an appetizer platter. I really enjoyed the fried plantains with their garlic dipping sauce as well the chorizo. The pork belly was somewhat bland in flavor but had a nice break apart consistency. In addition, we had the octopus which was extremely tender with excellent flavor as well as a fried crab/lobster croquette special which came with a nice light salsa and had some great flavor and texture. The star of the show for me was the Churrasco, what a piece of meat. The skirt steak seemed to go on forever as I began to work away on it. The chimichurri sauce had a strong overwhelming garlic flavor, but I found it extremely satisfying. The yuca fries were unexpectedly heavy and packed a nice crunch I enjoyed them. Overall, I would recommend this place as a nicer date night for couples. Not so much an atmosphere to bring the family, at least not with the level of volume we endured that night. Quality food nonetheless. We were a little surprised by the bill (on the expensive side), but given the area this could be expected.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

They closed by 10:30 and since we were still ordering eating and drinking they did not rush us out or put any pressure on us. We were having a celebratory dinner just a group of 4.

The Berejena which is the eggplant fries were delicious! Entree - I had the chef special - fish of the day which consisted of Red Snapper filet, asparagus, some type of potatoe like salad with a sweet purée - Mind blowing delicious!  And the Mar y Tierra which from my understanding was also amazing.Drinks - I had the mojito which was a little too strong for me and was missing the sugar cane stick.

38,mbxdo8Z59tcQc_FJMxHNeA,Trent T.,4.0 star rating,"Came in pretty early on a Saturday night. We made a reservation but there seemed to be plenty of seating both on the way in and on the way out. The front of the restaurant is a small bar and then unexpectedly opens up to a three tiered establishment in the back, I found it pretty interesting. The first impression of this place unfortunately for me was the volume inside. It was so loud to the point it was difficult to hear each other at the table. I could see this being desirable in some instances but it was a little troubling that night. On the contrary, our server was nice and very attentive and water and sangria were filled at all times. Which speaking of the sangria, they sure do pack quite a punch in it. I enjoyed it as I felt I get my money's worth, some may be turned off by it.For starters, we had the antojitos which was like an appetizer platter. I really enjoyed the fried plantains with their garlic dipping sauce as well the chorizo. The pork belly was somewhat bland in flavor but had a nice break apart consistency. In addition, we had the octopus which was extremely tender with excellent flavor as well as a fried crab/lobster croquette special which came with a nice light salsa and had some great flavor and texture. The star of the show for me was the Churrasco, what a piece of meat. The skirt steak seemed to go on forever as I began to work away on it. The chimichurri sauce had a strong overwhelming garlic flavor, but I found it extremely satisfying. The yuca fries were unexpectedly heavy and packed a nice crunch I enjoyed them. Overall, I would recommend this place as a nicer date night for couples. Not so much an atmosphere to bring the family, at least not with the level of volume we endured that night. Quality food nonetheless. We were a little surprised by the bill (on the expensive side), but given the area this could be expected.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

41,HhXn0ehQGoVP3I-WE2x61Q,Courtney J.,4.0 star rating,"The weekday (not including Fridays) early-bird prefix here is a great deal! We just walked in off the street without a reservation at around 5:50 PM on a Monday and had no trouble getting a table. With this deal you get three courses for around $30. Most of the entrees cost between $22-30 themselves, so it is well worth it. The server told us they were slightly smaller portions, but I walked out with left-overs so I think they are more than ample for the average diner. I love mojitos! These are correctly muddled, well-balanced, and come in a variety of flavors. I tried the passion fruit and the coconut. The passion fruit is nice and tart, so I preferred it over the coconut.  I would go back here just for the drinks. Food was good, but some dishes clearly won out over others. The little starchy rolls you get to begin your meal have a pleasant chewy texture. My chicken empanadas were very flavorful. My paella, while not Cuban as far as I know, had lots of flavor and a nice variety of seafood in it. They were flexible and happy to leave out the sausage for me since I don't eat pork. The only part I didn't enjoy was the clams as the were a bit gritty and over-cooked. Mussels were good though. The rice was cooked a little more than I'd like, but it wasn't bad. The tres leches was good, but typical. The flan my husband had was super creamy, rich, and delicious. Service was excellent and our water glasses were never empty and courses were perfectly spaced out. The server was happy to accommodate dietary requests and answer questions. Overall, I had a very pleasant experience at The Cuban Restaurant and Bar. I'm not sure how authentic the food is as it is only the second time I have been to a Cuban restaurant, but the drinks, food, and service were great! A note about parking: There is plenty on the street nearby, but make sure you are very careful when typing in your license plate number. We were one letter off apparently and got a ticket.

He loved it and said it was cooked perfectly. The steak was supposed to come with shrimp, but the restaurant ran out so they gave him a cold crab salad as a substitute which he wasn't a fan of (the cold crab salad didn't compliment the steak). I had the oxtail as my entree. The oxtail was super tough and chewy.  I eat oxtail all the time and it's always tender and falling off the bone--the one here wasn't.

Hidden amongst many of the bars on Washington St. you will find a classy, spot where the Cuban culture comes alive that leaves you wanting more of everything including the Salsa music they play. How could I not begin with a sangria!  One cup of sangria costs $9. The white sangria had the right amount of alcohol. I found the red to be hard to drink because of all of the pulp but both were very good.We arrived at 5pm and were offered the pre-fix dinner menu for $32 pp. It included an appetizer, dinner, and dessert. For an appetizer I ordered the ropa vieja empanada which was divine! It's good for 1-2 people considering it's one empanada cut in half. The empanada crust was cooked to perfection. The choices of dinner were tough but I stuck to my favorite and went for the vaca frita. I was sold on the dish because it came with avocado. The white rice and black beans are a traditional Cuban side dish and are always satisfying. This side was no different. Super good. The vaca frita was very good as well. It was extra crispy throughout probably a little more then I have had on previous orders. This could've been because they left it in the broiler a little too long? Even with the extra crunch it was delicious and a huge portion. By the time dessert came I was stuffed and took my flan to go.  The service was superb from the minute we were greeted to the end as we exited.

Crispy and a little bit of heat, these babies are awesome. Maduros are also excellent.

The overall vibe, environment and service is absolutely top notch at this place. David served us at a hightop next to the bar. He was really attentive, knowledgable and nice. The runners, bussers and host were all fantastic. Drinks-Brazilian Sangria- Fine. White Sangria- Hit the table completely clear. I am pretty sure the bartender forgot to add a crucial ingredient here. It didn't contain any fruit juice whatsoever. Was straight booze and water. Appetizers-  Croquetas de Hongo- Without the truffle aioli this dish would have been awful. The croquetes tasted as if though they were frozen. The filling was very much lacking in overall flavor. Tomato and Avocado Salad- The tomatoes and avocado were completely ''pasados'' (old - sitting in the walk in a day too long). The dressing definitely lacked flavor. This dish could have popped with ripe ingredients and proper seasoning. Something usually very hard to mess up. Entrees-Paella- Was super excited about this, but again it was totally lack luster. The rice was completely undercooked and the dish lacked any real flavor. Totally under seasoned. Quinoa Entree- Also utterly under seasoned. Owners- Your sous chef/ expeditors running the show in the kitchen this evening really dropped the ball. Based on your reviews- I'm sure this was just an off night for the kitchen and bar.

We ordered drinks and then asked to order appetizers, but our server told us that she would need our full order (meaning our dinner off the menu) since they were getting busy. We were thrown off and told her we needed more time. We just decided that we only wanted the drinks and appetizers after this as we felt rushed and did not like this service. So when our server returned, we let her know we were only having appetizers and drinks. She proceeds to tell us that drinks and appetizers would not meet the minimum to sit at a table...which wasn't mentioned at all prior to us sitting down.

The servers were very quick and always near in case anyone need something extra. All the waiters were knowledgable of their foods and very nice and outgoing. The Cuban restaurant have a great staff, no doubts about it. Now let talk about the food. NO LIE, I live in Brooklyn.... I will take a train and four buses to eat here if i have too... the food here is so delicious. Everything here reminds you of being back home on the island with the family and having great Lunch, Dinner, or dessert... One bite of everything is just a satisfaction moment, No regrets what so ever. I took my mom here for a test drive before the corporate dinner and she is a picky eater. She loved everything she ate. A big acknowledgement to Lauren, she coordinated the corporate dinner and did an amazing job. She will go far and i wish her nothing but the best in her future.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

71,ptfigdh9vXo4dmPz2p3mSg,Melanie M.,4.0 star rating,"The first time I ever had dinner in Hoboken, I thought we were doomed to finding really good food. Having just moved to Newport, my boyfriend and I never really went to Hoboken for dinner, in fear that the food would be subpar. I was pleasantly surprised when he had made reservations here last month when we had a craving for some Spanish food. Being Latina myself, I'm very picky when it comes to my rice, beans and especially tostones. And let me tell you - the Cuban Restaurant does. not. disappoint.Granted, there aren't many vegetarian options, so when I come here I have to get some sort of fish dish (even though I'm truly satisfied just getting rice and beans, but their black means are just meh). The necessary staples: Salmon Ceviche (with avocado, mango and jalapeño), Brazilian Sangria, and the tostones with mojo sauce. Yes, they come with chimichurri, but just tell them you don't want it and get the mojo on the side. It is to DIE FOR. I always ask for extra when I pack up my leftovers cause, well, I'm sure my fellow latinos will understand. Everyone I've visited with so far has thoroughly enjoyed their meals, so I'd say it's a must for Cuban in Hoboken. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because last night we made a reservation for 9 pm (which means..we're hungry) and we weren't seated until 9:30 pm. We didn't get much sympathy from the host who behaved in a slightly condescending manner and just told us they were running late. Well, I guess they know their mojo sauce will just keep people coming back for more.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

Throughout the night, the servers made sure our glasses were never empty.Our waiter made sure to mention their special of the day, which sounded tasty, as he described every detail of their red snapper dish. However, we both went for regular items on the menu. We ordered the empanadas for an appetizer. Four halves placed over what looked like a black bean sauce and chimichurri. There was so much flavor, the chicken was nicely cooked and the shell of the empanada was crispy - just perfect. As for entrees, he had the Ropa Vieja and I went with the Mar y Tierra. I was a HUGE fan of the Mar y Tierra. Steak at medium rare, topped with chimichurri sauce, four pieces of shrimp, a side of fried potatoes and and asparagus. There was nothing on my plate that I didn't enjoy. I almost always have trouble finishing my food, but ate all my steak and shrimp, with very few potatoes to spare. As for my boyfriend's Ropa Vieja, it came in a dish with a large helping of rice and a side of black beans. He completely devoured his food. I also forgot to mention that he ordered a side of maduros, which were so perfectly sweet and soft. We left The Cuban extremely full but completely satisfied. We will be back!

82,KOygMqXCqAmCmktxYXyL1g,Scott H.,4.0 star rating,"Four stars, mainly for great apps, drinks, and a lively atmosphere.For apps, the guacamole with crabmeat and the garlic shrimp are both great.  The guacamole has great flavor, and has a light, airy quality, almost like it's been whipped.  It's served with super-crispy plantain chips, and always seems to be a crowd favorite.  Ditto the garlic shrimp, which are cooked perfectly, with great garlicky flavor.For mains, my experience has been hit or miss.  I've enjoyed the El Classico, a hearty dish of fall-off-the-bone tender pork shoulder, rice and beans.  The paella, on the other hand, has been disappointing:  a large portion, but a bit bland, with some of the seafood ingredients overcooked / dry.  It comes with a dipping sauce, and seems to need it.  As for atmosphere, this is a fun, lively place.  It's a narrow space with stone walls, so once it fills up (which it's bound to do), it gets pretty noisy.

The service was ok but nothing off the charts, and to our waiters advice we ordered the $35.00 menu which included a appetizer, main dish and a dessert. He informed us that the size portions are the same as if we ordered each plate separately, the appetizers came first and they were bite sizes, the main course came in and it was bite size as well. I prefer to be told the honest truth so I can make the correct decision. That day they had a special appetizer that was a fish ceviche with mango, jalapeño, orange and lime juice. That plate was delicious but that was an extra appetizer and I thought he had cancelled since he suggested the $35.00 deal.

When we sat down, we asked about Happy Hour and were told ""that's only at the bar, you shouldn't have sat down if you wanted those prices.""  Okay, the menu looked awesome, so we just ignored that and ordered a pitcher of sangria and 6 appetizers and 2 sides for 4 people.  The waiter said, ""What else are you going to order?"" We said we weren't sure yet, and we're told we had to make a complete order or he would not put in the apps. We said we were not sure what we wanted and were still deciding. He told us we had not yet reached ""the minimum order"" and needed to order more. This led to a minor breakdown where the manager came by to tell us that ordering separately was ""too stressful"" for the kitchen (in a nearly empty restaurant).  Anyway, the fact that I was entertaining kept me from just leaving. So, summary: food was okay, but not worth the price. Service destroyed the experience. Overall, run.

I had the churascco and it was delicious. My husband had the special which was some kind of fish over rice with cod fish in it. He loved it. For dessert we had chocolate filled churros and they were so good. If you're going to get a coffee make sure you ask for a Cuban coffee. There are party rooms in the back. You can also order roast pig (4 days in advance and I think a minimum of 10 people).

Last night I got the churrasco, and it was great per usual. My friend got the mar y tierra for the first time, and she really liked it.Other notes about the restaurant, we have not received bad service there.

We attended for brunch on a Saturday, and they were very flexible when we had to change our reservation around and our table was prepared when we arrived. FOOD:As a vegetarian, I've resigned myself to ordering random sides when I visit Cuban restaurants. This place, however, had SO many options for vegetarians that I actually had a tough time deciding what to eat! I had to the corn polenta with wild mushrooms and a poached egg, and I added an avocado which enhanced the taste as well. My friends also ordered the ropa vieja and the cuban sandwich which they enjoyed as well. Our one mistake was almost not ordering dessert, but we ended up trying the tres leches, chocolate bread pudding, and churros, and they were some of the best desserts we'd ever had. SERVICE:Our waiter was very sweet and reminded us of their specials before we ordered. We had no trouble with a long wait time for food, and he was always pleasantly available for any questions we had. ATMOSPHERE:The music was really great, and contributed to a general vibe of being on vacation! Recommend this place to anyone and everyone looking for an excuse to head out to Hoboken!

We often order a few small plates before deciding on our entree, but I'm sure there's some rhyme or reason to this policy (most likely to help them space the meal) and it wasn't a huge inconvenience. They get extra points for the cool atmosphere and the food was also pretty dang good. The highlight of our meal was the deditos de bacalao and the aguacate con cangrejo - highly recommend both!For entrees we had the Churrasco and the boliche.  The churrasco was fantastic and I loved the chimichurri.  For me the boliche was just too heavy of a dish for me to truly enjoy more than a couple bites.Overall definitely recommend and will be back!",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

If you want to keep it at $5, don't get creative and order any flavored mojitos.The gluten-free bread (an oxymoron and a ridiculous concept if you ask me) was as tasteless as I expected, but at least it was complimentary.The chimichurri on the Mar y Tierra (Grilled hanger steak, garlic shrimp, truffle potatoes, grilled asparagus) made the dish. The truffle potatoes were interesting, but not so truffled. Or would you say truffly?The fact that the pork on El Clasico was a roasted pork shank made my night. It was perfectly tender and fell right off the bone as it should. The rice and bean and sweet plantain traditional accompaniments were both as good as the pork, in their own individual ways.Perhaps even better than the food was the service.

The food was delicious granted it was take out and reheated at home. However, when I came here for happy hour and a sit down dinner, the food was inconsistent and the service was horrendous. The paella was way over-salted, the sangria my friend ordered tasted like sugary cough syrup, and the mussels we ordered was topped with a ton of fries (not mentioned in the menu or in person to us) because they ran out of crustinis. The bartender was nice, so we got over it. But when we sat down for dinner, we ordered only 1 paella to share, but the server delivered 2 -- another error, okay -- but then she began to argue with us saying that we clearly ordered 2 and left us saying ""whatever."" No wonder the place was bare after happy hour.

The drink specials and Happy Hour appetizers are delicious and there is a nice variety which pretty much guarantees something to everyone's liking if you come with a group. This week, The Cuban extended hours to include Lunch on Thursdays and Fridays beginning at 11:30am.  I was so excited to have a new lunch option in Hoboken. I went with a group of 12 for lunch. We were easily accomodated and service was prompt and courteous.  Among the dishes ordered were the Havana Club, Ropa Vieja, Bacalao, and a classic Cubano. Everyone enjoyed their food. We also ordered a few drinks including the Hemingway, Sangria de Invierno, and Mojitos. Hemingway was a favorite.  Really great experience every time.

Now on to why the 2 star rating. We made reservations and we got seated right away, as soon as we walked in. However ""right away"" isn't always a good thing, since they gave us the table right by the front door. This meant:1. We were right under the speaker, so we couldn't hear each other.2. It was cold since there's no vestibule and every time the door opened we got a blast of cold air.3. Because of number 2 we had to keep our jackets on while we ate, which is uncomfortable in multiple ways.4. There's no waiting area so people were standing all around us while we ate, which again is very uncomfortable. 5. FYI: We did ask for a different table but were told it would be a 1.5 hour wait and they were expecting groups of 4. Which sounded plausible until towards the end of our meal a couple seated next to us asked the same thing. Guess what? They were given the exact same response.

The staff was friendly and incredibly accommodating. José was eager to serve and was very helpful. I ending up starting my meal with the Aguacate y Tomate (Avocado & Tomato) which was very fresh and tangy. For my main course I had the Pollo Criollo (Creole Chicken) and it did not disappoint. The half chicken was deboned and cooked to perfection and  served over creole fried rice with maduros. I finished this stellar evening with my favorite dessert of all time: Tres Leches(three milk cake;) it was heaven!

Rice was tasty, maybe sugar or butter in it, not sure but good.Cons:1. Overpriced, not any added value versus the other 3 Cuban restaurants in Hoboken.2. Appetizers were tiny, empanadas were good but what deep fried food isn't good? 3. Churrasco is what everyone talked about but it was super fatty, ridiculous salty, and lacking in chimichurri (had to ask for extra). The beans were almost inedible they were so salty.4.

The passion fruit sangria that was recommended by our waitress, Samantha was on point. The dessert was the best way to end the night. Chocolate filled churros! Aside from leaving the restaurant at 1am because the date, along with the food and drinks were too good to pass up, I'll Def be sure to stop by again!

Forget about fried red snapper. ""We ran out""2. Bread basket came with 4 small pieces of bread. Literally one per person.

160,pz3Ulbuk7ZiUUbT7oFzmpA,Lori L.,4.0 star rating,"Hoboken is still an unexplored area for me, but when a few friends of mine needed a brunch spot within walking distance of their apartment, The Cuban was one of the first places to make the list. Although they don't accept reservations, the venue is surprisingly spacious, complete with a hidden dining room located past the first room that greets guests. There's a long bar area, perfect for settling into for drinks and small plates, making it an ideal location for brunch or dinner.I was the first of my party to arrive that afternoon, and even though four others had yet to show, the server had no issues with seating me first while setting up our table for the rest of my friends [1]. When we were all present, our questions were adeptly addressed, especially as one of my friends was vegetarian, and requested that the protein in her omelette be replaced with avocado; it was a swap that was easily adjusted for without an additional surcharge. While we waited, we were given a warm bowl of cheese-filled bread buns, better known as Pão de queijo, which helped to whet our appetites.I, predictably, went with the Cuban Benedict, which put a unique spin on the traditional plate. Instead of an English muffin, a croissant-like biscuit was utilized instead, which gave an uniquely layered base to the plate. It's topped with a few slices of smoked ham and a generous amount of ropa vieja, as well as the requisite poached eggs and a mustard béarnaise.The ropa vieja was braised to an ideal tenderness, the eggs perfectly poached, and I appreciated the use of the béarnaise, versus the traditional hollandaise, as the addition of terragon and vinegar cut through the richness of the proteins. A few of us also shared an order of the French Fries, which were crispy and well-seasoned, although they disappeared quickly from the table; either the portion was a tad small for sharing, or they were just that tasty.I can't speak for the authenticity of the plates served at The Cuban, but I can verify that the food is done well and service is nothing short of welcoming. Given the amount of space the restaurant has, it's ideal for larger groups as well, and well-worth a trip, especially for those who live in the area.--[1] Many restaurants I've visited adhere to the ""full party must be present to be seated"" policy, regardless of the existence of a reservation, the number of people already present, or the emptiness of the dining room. A personal gripe of mine, but it's always appreciated when a restaurant puts common sense before widely-instituted procedures.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

There is no way to go wrong with pleasantly strong drinks at moderate prices and a wide array of delectable bites at the bar. A pina colada and some bacon wrapped plantains, and you're good to go.Brunch, however, is a different story. The food was not bad-- not at all. Every item (of the many, too many) looked appetizing and definitely made my mouth water, but in the end, the dishes were not memorable. They were pretty well-crafted, just enough food and just enough flavor to satiate. The passionfruit mojito, dangerous red sangria, and pretty pina colada were far more memorable and noteworthy. I was the only one of our party of six to order dessert (of course, I had space to indulge), but that was a bad decision. The bread pudding was not so great, with bitter chocolate accents that muddied the whole dessert.I know I will be back for happy hour and snackies, and I even would try brunch out another time.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

We started with mojitos and they were strong, not overly sweet, and tasty. I preferred the regular, with Don Q rum, over the Hotel Nacional de Cuba style, which used aged Brugal rum. Dinner portions were large, the El Classico was delicious, with braised pork served with rice and plantains. We barely ate half and took the rest home. Ropa vieja, shredded beef stew, is a favorite and this was melt in your mouth excellent. Black beans were among the best I've had in a long time and the yuca frita was also good, but we wouldn't have ordered it if we knew how large the entrees were.Service was decent, generally fast and efficient. The waitress wasn't the most polished, but she got the job done. Nice dining rooms are in back and the only drawback may be where the bathroom is located, two flights of stairs up.

Then we sat down and were told no happy hour. Two of the girls I was with were going to share an entree so I ordered the mussels appetizer and we were then told we had to order more food because we were sitting at a table. The mussels weren't even good they were sitting with a pile of soggy fries on top covered in a greasy mayo sauce. We also ordered the guacamole which was not the freshest seafood for the price.

As soon as we walked in. greeted and treated like family. The waiter brought us water and even went above and beyond by creating a sippy cup for my little girl. We had the chicken empanada which was packed with flavor and fried to perfection. As our main I had the Pernil and my boyfriend had the surf and turf.  The Pernil was good, but just that. Nothing to crazy. I feel it lacked citrus. No lime. No salt. It was a bit bland. I asked for lime and a mojo sauce and wow what a difference! It wasn't a bad Pernil cause the flavor was there as far as for season (garlic, pepper, etc) it was lacking in a little more salt. It wasn't dry. Nice and juicy. Just needed lime to cut thru the fat and little more salt. Had I not had Pernil before it would have been disappointing to a first timer not knowing how to adjust the flavor. Once The waiter brought the lime and dressing it was amazing though! Moving on, the steak and shrimp was PERFECT . Cooked perfectly medium rare, flavored,sides also amazing, which I believe was spinach in a cream sauce. Also portions are huge, personally for me. I could have spilt that meal with my friend. Also maybe cause I eat like a bird. You be the judge:My man was able to eat all though. To add, between my boyfriend and I we had two drinks each. I tried a glass of sangria. (They have different versions, I can't recall the one I ordered) It was delicious though. My boyfriend had a "".pina colada"" drink and I only was able to taste it once he offered me some when he was almost finished, and for what I did taste was DELISH. He drank it fast so im assuming that was a good sign. He also had a mojito but I didn't get to try it and I ended with a white wine. we also ordered flan and churros. I personally enjoyed the flan more than churros. I'm so use to the original churros that there version was too much for me. But that's just me. I wouldn't say not to try cause they come fresh and the dough is so yummy and crispy and soft in the inside. Nom. I wish it had no filling.but if u love chocolate I can see u loving this.

I have spent many thousands of dollars here over the past 6 years.  The manager sees me in there and MUST recognize me.  He has never once bought me a drink.  I think that is just poor business.  Albert, Steve and Rudy are great bartenders, but it would be nice if someone hooked me up here and there considering the huge tips I leave for them and the money I spend.  Just my two cents on how things work since I was a bartender, server and a bar manager in my younger days.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

You can go to bed now!We came as a large party with no reservation just before peak hours and were accommodated immediately. The layout is pretty unique -- narrow and multi-tiered. I think they did a fantastic job with the space, given they have little control over how the building was constructed. It's a very vibrant atmosphere with great music (if not a tad loud for my reserved gringo ears -- but no points off for that). Our waiter was so patient, organized and lovely. Service was amazing overall, from the timing of the dishes to the taking of payment, they maneuver so deftly around that space that I was pretty impressed. The food, of course, is the star. It's the reason my mom was pushing for this review. She, like all of us, completely savored the variety of dishes we ordered with great relish and there wasn't a single complaint from the entire party. We're not food snobs or difficult-to-please people, but we do have taste buds and a lifetime of eating experience and it is rare for every individual in a group that size to keep exclaiming ""Mmmmh! Oooooh! Deliccccccciouuuus! Oh, honey, you need to try this! Oooh, gimme some of yours, baby. Oooh, that's yummy. Omnomnom!"" It was borderline pornographic. I guess maybe that's why the music is turned up a notch. LOLAside from the amazeballs complementary cheese bread, I decided to have two apps instead of an entree because I couldn't resist the octopus. So incredibly fresh and tender and flavored magnificently. It's appetizer sized, so I was a bit stingy about sharing with others. I also had the croquetas, which were yummy as well. Among us, there was a pretty representative assortment of the menu and, again, I cannot express enough  how delicious everyone found their dish.

I really liked the atmosphere because it was very lively---indoors and outdoors. I loved having live music by the door since our table was by the bar. For drinks, I got a mojito and half a pitcher of sparkling white sangria. I forgot the flavor of the mojito, but it was the fruit mojito of the season or something. It was yummy and this is coming from someone who loves her mojitos. The sangria was good for sharing with my friends. For my entree, I had El Classico, a pork shank dish. It was delicious and the portion size was pretty big (at least for me). Since it was my birthday, for dessert, we shared the tres leche. It was sweet and very good. The second time that I came here was in December. Obviously, since it's a lot colder now, there are no outdoor seatings. I had another seasonal mojito that I forgot the flavor to once again. A girl never gets sick of mojitos though. I shared the Churrasco with my boyfriend. It was delicious. I definitely recommend along with many other yelpers. I thought the watercress salad was light and very complimentary to the grilled skirt steak. Also, the yuca fries were amazing; super yummy.

First of all , I do have to say that the restaurant itself has an elegant appeal to it which I liked the customer service is PHENOMENAL and that's the reason why I'm giving it a 2 instead of a 1 our waiter went above and beyond to explain the menu gave us a few suggestion was very attentive and service was rather fast .Now the food , As an appetizer, we ordered the BBQ chicken empanadas (2) empanadas split in two gorgeous presentation but why I care for presentation if the food is not great... The chicken tasted old but it was still juicy but it was sweet I guess the BBQ made it sweet I literally had only half didn't like it..As an entree I got the ropa vieja which comes with the shredded beef rice and beans (no sweet plantains,) like every Cuban restaurant...Amyway, there was more stew sauce then meat in it ... For $20 a plate I expect at least half a lb of meat so I could have leftovers for the next 3 meals...Either way I guess it was a good thing ,it wasn't a lot because I would felt bad throwing away all that tasteless food... The ropa vieja needed more adobo garlic and sofrito had no flavor once or ever.My husband ordered the vacca frita again no flavor not even Jesus could help that food with some flavor.. Now desert was  delicious but for $10 they could of gave me a bigger slice ..  I literally ate it in 3 bites and I'm not a big girl....Needless to say, in my opinion, this place is still open because of its magnificent service and not so much for the food all those great reviews were done by people without taste buds ... $135 later for dinner for 2 people I was angry at my husband for wanting to try something different because at Cuban Pete's in Montclair we usually get 2 appetizers a jar of mojito 2 entrees ,and 2 desserts and the bill never comes up to even $80....I don't care if I have to pay $135 for a meal for 2 if the food is exquisite but this place didn't WOW me.

My wife and I have been here twice and each time were blown away by the amount of flavor packed into each bite. We started with a speciality sangria this time. Made fresh and a 1/2 pitcher is perfect for two. For the appetizer we had the muscles and I literally spooned the sauce as if it were a soup in the end. It was that good. For our entrees I had the Paella and my wife had the Skirt Steak. Both were amazing. My Paella was warm, full of flavor and plenty of food for my large appetite. My wife's steak was so tender she was able to cut it with a fork. Our only complaint is that we were too full for dessert.

The interior is fairly modern and trendy. This is definitely the nicest place along those few blocks of Washington Ave which features quite a few restaurants. They have a small but nice patio, and a great room in the back, and then a bar like area in the front (where we ate). We are sorry we weren't informed of the nicer back area at all. I guess I would sum it up by saying that every thing is ""almost really good"". The food is good but not really great. It just seems slightly over priced for being Hoboken, and the quality of food. bread : somewhat disappointing - three hard pretty small little rolls, with garlic butter if you want garlic or not.no soups on the menuSalad - creative and different, and a decent but not huge portionchicken and rice : @$22 over priced. ""stir fried rice"" was good but salty. The chicken with skin and all was ok/good, and portion size was quite good. We ended up not eating most of it though.salmon and chickpeas : The chickpeas with spinach were quite good. The salmon was good, but my partner felt it was under cooked.

We had reservations for four and were seated in the back room promptly. I must say I wish we would have been seated closer to the live music that was playing.All of our waiters were extremely friendly and attentive. Our glasses of water were always filled. And anything we needed we got right away. Had a $5 mimosa, which the price is expected when you are in Hoboken, but they should really consider a deal when it comes to brunch. Of course I ordered the skirt steak, with the fried Cuban rice (uh-mazing), and egg over easy. The steak was so tender and juicy. I've never had fried Cuban rice before but it is similar to hibachi rice. And the egg well you can't really mess that one up LOL.My mom ordered the Ropa Vieja and although she said it was good it was lacking meat. They had given her a serving with more peppers & onions than meat.  We informed our waiter about this and we told him it was not a  big deal because my mom is a light eater but we just to warn them in case they serve this plate to someone else who is expecting more.

The crab was light and refreshing and soft. It melted in your mouth. The ham and cheese croquettes were too mushy for my liking. The bacon wrapped around this Cuban yellow fruit was delicious.

223,QmXD8PoMBe5WHX0diF2g0g,Shonnie H.,2.0 star rating,"MEEHHHHH. This is my second time at The Cuban - the first time was a couple years ago, shortly after it first opened its doors. I think I went on a week night and we were one of only 2 or 3 other patrons. This time was completely different - there were SOO many people, which is usually a great sign of the quality of food and drinks. We made a 7pm reservation (Saturday evening) and I called at 6:30pm to let them know that we might be about 10 minutes late due to traffic. The woman who picked up the phone was rude - she said ""well, you might have to wait anyway""- really? I was making a courtesy call, no need to make such a rude response. I was also only late by 3 minutes - I ran inside while my date went to park the car. There were about 3 tabletop seats available (across from the bar) and the girl (likely the same rude girl who picked up the phone), tells me that she won't seat me until my date arrived. What's the point of doing that when you have free tables? Since I obviously made a reservation, you would have to give me one of those tables anyway, as there was no one else waiting. My date finally arrived a couple minutes later, and to my surprise, the other host took us ALL the way to the back and up the steps to where a party was taking place - there were about 10-15 people sitting in a area and were loud as heck. I told her that I wanted the tabletop seat at the front. She, at first, refused, saying that those are for ""reservations only,"" to which I, at this point was frustrated enough, shot back and said ""I had a reservation and I am NOT sitting up here."" She went to check if there were still seats available (there were still a couple tables available just when we walked up the steps so I don't see why there wouldn't be), and she finally gave in and escorted us back. Totally unnecessary drama - management needs to step up their game and replace these rude hosts or train them to stop being snobs - the African American girl was particularly rude. She's problematic and for a restaurant where you're serving people, put a smile on your face sometimes - wouldn't hurt not to be be such a RBF all the time. Putting that all behind us and motivated to enjoy the rest of the evening, we ordered 2 appetizers - grilled calamari and guac with crab meat. They were both excellent - the fried plantain was a perfect match with the guac and I was so delighted by the surprisingly spectacular match of guac with crab meat. As for the drinks, I ordered a lemongrass mojito after reading some Yelp reviews and it was, indeed, very good. We were both feeling seafood that night, and I ended up ordering the paella. It sucked. I was really disappointed with how grossly soggy the rice was, and how there was barely any sauce. The rice was swollen and the whole dish was nauseating. I picked out just the seafood and left all my rice. I had the Washington Avenue cocktail which was a spicy tequila drink - very interesting but would likely not order it again. The service was good - our waiter was sweet and attentive. I didn't like how they kept asking if we were ""done"" with our food - my date had gone to the car to get something and was literally gone for less than 5 minutes, and they were asking if we had finished our food. We finally gave in when we were asked a third time, since the main dish wasn't that good anyway. It was a perfect time to leave - we left at 8:30pm, and the bar area was getting crowded with drunks. I have no idea what the hype is about but I clearly forgot about this place after the first time I went because it was unimpressive then - had I remembered there was really nothing special to it, I wouldn't have come back.Anyway, Hoboken seems to still be needing some more upscale/fun/hipster restaurants that actually delivers good food - look at the low expectations, given the stars for this restaurant.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

You walk in to the bar and there are some tables and you think that's it. Then you head on over to the back room and it's like a whole other world opens up. Tons of seating on two levels and beautifully decorated. Outside of its looks, my favorite thing here was the lemongrass mojitos. Perfectly prepared, I could have drank them all night if I didn't have to drive. They weren't too sweet or sugary. They were a special, so the next time I went back and they didn't have them, I was a bit disappointed but the honeydew mojito special proved just as delicious.Their regular mojitos are good, but their speciality ones are the ones to order.  The food here is great and the portions are surprisingly big. The bread is something out of this world. Seriously. If I could steal some home with me, I would. It's soft with a small piece of manchego cheese kind of melted inside; add the infused butter and you're in heaven. Suggested apps include guacamole with fresh crabmeat (definitely a generous portion of crab); empanadas, and the mussels. I loved the beet salad; which I ordered with a side of grilled shrimp. Both together and separately, they were dynamite. Also highly recommend the paella. Tons of fresh shellfish mixed into flavor yellow rice. You will not be disappointed.

The chorizo sweet plantain fried rice I would eat every day of my life. Every day !!  It had such a unique flavor to it. I know for sure to get that every time I go.

Our server took forever to come and take our order... Then he takes orders from only half of our party (there were 6 of us) and walks away. I had to call him back over, at which point he also needed the people who already ordered to tell him their order again. Other than that, it just was slow.The food. My major disappointment. I had the vegetarian dish (plantain and ricotta casserole), it was terrible. The plantains weren't cooked right (or maybe weren't ripe enough) and the cheese was also not warmed all the way through. Just the favors together were also very strange. I'll definitely make the drive back to New Brunswick next time I'm looking to satisfy my craving for Cuban!",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

We told the waiter we were not ready for the main course; we wanted to order another drink first.  He said okay, no worries, the main course won't be ready for another 15-20 minutes... that was a lie; it arrive 2 minutes later, it was not good, not fresh and it was cold.

Appetizers included the meatballs, shrimp ceviche (outstanding), salad and empanadas.  Entrees included vaca frita (twice grilled skirt steak which was hands down my fave), a grilled chicken dish and salmon.   Dessert was tres leches and flan.  Coffee was included and many at the table opted for cappucinos and expressos.Service was amazing and as more latecomers joined, more food was brought to the table with pain de bono (we didn't ask, they just did it!  How awesome!).   We got the sparkling sangria and some ordered wine.  The sangria was delicious!  The Cuban even brought out a candle for the bday girl to blow out.  We were never rushed and enjoyed our party table in the Love enclave upstairs.Thank you to everyone at The Cuban for making this a fantastic and celebratory night!",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

I'm not really used to eating any raw fish that isn't sushi, so this really turned me on to it. It had a light salsa on top, along with what tasted like a pesto aoili (DELISH, top notch). It was a special, so I don't think it's on the normal menu - you'll have to be lucky enough to come at the right time! I then had the vaca frita, which is ""twice cooked crispy skirt steak, tomato escabeche, avocado, white rice, black beans, garlic mojo,"" and my friend had the ropa vieja, ""braised skirt steak, tomato pepper sauce, white rice, black beans."" Both were amazing. The vaca frita was a shredded steak that was seasoned very nicely, paired with half an avocado and rice that was cooked very well (I'm picky about my rice). The ropa vieja was more of a stew, tomato-ey with shredded steak inside, very good as well.Service: BThe service was actually great, but I have to knock the score down a bit. When I sat down, I noticed that my fork wasn't cleaned properly. There was still someone's old food crusted on it a bit, and I asked someone for another fork. It was replaced by another fork that was...still not clean. The servers, however, were very attentive and friendly and checked up on us regularly to make sure our experience was a good one.Ambiance: A-The feel of this place was a great blend of classy and casual. The place was small, as are most places in the heart of downtown Hoboken, but I liked that the tables were spaced enough so my friend and I didn't feel like we were crashing the date of the table next to ours (which happens frequently in small places).

Maybe I'm old, but I want to be able to hear my friends and have conversation without straining my voice all night. The cocktail menu was great! I had the ""Washington Avenue"" which contained spicy tequila which I am all about lately. Overall, impressive mixology. The sangria was STRONG which I shouldn't complain about. Ok, well, a little toxic tasting, but after a few who cares. The appetizers were just ok I have to say! We had the meatballs, crispy chicken (just ok after recommendation from the waiter), and the octopus which was over-salted and very fishy tasting. Oh and the guacamole which actually was very flavorful. For the entree I had the Skirt steak that came with avocado and rice. Forget the name. Started with a V. The presentation looked interesting because as you can see from my picture the steak was shredded like pulled pork would be. The flavor was great, but it was way over cooked and chewy! It hurt my jaw to bite through the burned strips. When I did get to the moister pieces it was delicious. I get what they were going for, but any brisket or pulled pork I've had is never crunchy if cooked well.  Avocado was ripe enough! Didn't try the rice to be honest. I think I was too into the sangria. Last, for the ridiculous prices, I should have been wowed and I wasn't. $300 later for 6 people and I was feeling buyers remorse.

Their mussels appetizer is huge and has the best sauce EVER for bread, and I recently just had the oxtail appetizer which I think is going to be a regular in my rotation. Their sangria is solid and is always yummy but actually gets you drunk. Prices are a little on the higher end, but absolutely worth it.

When we first walked in (we had a reservation), it seemed really cramped. The bar is on your left, and there are some tables on your right. When the hostess came to seat us, we were taken ALL the way back, through some partitions, and then the Cuban opened up to a bigger area (and two levels) of seating.Much better.The music was a bit loud - when you're at dinner with a party of four or more, you want to enjoy some conversation and hear everyone. I found myself yelling a bit and repeating myself often, which stinks. No one wants to leave with a hoarse voice. No one...The wait time was also a bit excessive. I get it: it's The Cuban, it's in Hoboken, it's mobbed. But you'd think they'd have a better-fitted staff to accommodate the amount of patrons. We'd waited a bit of time before all of our courses came out, including cocktails. The time between Sangria #1 and #2 was quite a while.Cocktails: pretty good. I got the Mezcal-based cocktail, and they did it very well. The Sangria wasn't bad - a bit strong though (I think it was the Gin).The quality of food is what gives the Cuban a solid score for me: We split a few appetizers family-style to starts, including the octopus and chicken, which were good. The main course I got (the Flank Steak) was delicious, and done very well.  Seasoned right and cooked perfectly (medium-rare), and served well. The fries on the side were just OKAY - not seasoned.The other killer here is the price - BEYOND what you would expect to pay at a spot like this.

What more can you ask for?Oh, maybe happy hour Tues-Fri 4-7pm, and Sat-Sun 3-6pm! $5 drinks and tapas!Live Cuban music Thursdays 6:30 - 9:30pm!DJ's Friday and Saturday nights!Strong mojitos and ridiculously authentic Cuban specialties. Drinks made with top shelf as the norm too! The staff and service was very attentive, warm and friendly. I felt like I was at a family's place hooking me up with a good time. Loved sitting outside under the stars listening to great music while kicking back with a few mojitos. Our waiter helped us navigate the menu and we were quite satisfied with our choices.Empanadas ( Chicken Fricase, Ropa Vieja, Escalivada ), Potato croquettes with wild mushroom, grilled mushroom escabeche, truffle jalapeno aioli, and a Tamale ( Traditional Cuban corn tamal, pork, Creole onions ). All very good. Basically, we just ordered a bunch of appetizers ""tapas style"" so we could try a few things out. Really, the food here is delish!Had to try out a few desserts. The Flancito ( Caramel flan w/ Malibu coconut pineapple salsita ) rocked it!  We also had an ice cream that is hard to describe but oddly addicting - Mamey. I don't know what it was but could not stop eating it. If I lived in Hoboken this would be one of my go-to happy hour spots as you can't beat it! Fun atmosphere, great food, cheap strong drinks.

The staff, food, service and atmosphere are just some of the best you'll find in Hoboken. The salmon dish is my absolute favorite. It is always so perfectly cooked -tender on the inside and delicately crispy on the outside, and that glaze! I have no idea what they use to make the glaze, but it puts the whole dish over the top.

Our server came and let us know about the Happy hour prices  how they are lowered then what is shown on them menu so it would be around $5 or do and said we had until 7pm. So we place our drink orders and ordered 2 appetizers. After a while I noticed that the tables next to us received their food and we did not. We call our server ( who did not properly introduce himself, he was short, with a fohawk) over and ask him what it going on and he THEN decides to tell us happy hour is at the bar only and that he spoke to his manager and that we cannot receive our food until we go sit elsewhere. At that time the bar was packed and we were upset he did not tell us this prior to ordering. Then we order a pitcher of sangria since I enjoyed my glass of sangria de invierno and I asked another server if he can bring the pitcher of sangria de invierno and they ended up bringing us house sangria. We asked our main server if they can possibly sweetened it and when it came back it tasted too much like brandy that we decided not to drink it at all.We ask for our bill and they charged us regular price for the drinks that we were previously told were part of happy hour. This is when we ask the manager about fixing our check and the server LIED in front of his manager and told him he told us when we were seated that happy hour is at the bar only.I have never been so offended by a server, especially for lying to the manager and the manager didn't do much either. But there was a very nice server who was apologizing for the inconvenience and let us know if we wanted to order 3-4 apps we can stay at the table but we were not even informed of that either.Needless to say we got the check fixed and the pitcher removed and went straight to 1 Republik where we got to enjoy happy hour outside as well as inside and had a completely better experience.That will be the first and last time i ever go to The Cuban.

Outdoor is nothing too special but indoor is great. The look and feel of the place is very trendy and cool, one of the more fun places in Hoboken. They have a ton of tables and there really is not a bad seat in the house (either in the bar or in the back). It's a somewhat upscale place but you really don't need to dress up to go for a meal.Bathroom: Very clean and very inviting. They keep the A/C pumping downstairs and this is a nice warm up spot as well haha.Staff: Our waiter was wonderful. He was quick to greet us and take our drink orders, returning soon after to take our meal order as well. He was pretty helpful with the couple questions he had and overall just a friendly guy.Food/Drink: The food is absolutely amazing. We started with some drinks (mojitos and a Washington Ave - which is AWESOME) and also some apps: Croquetas de Jamon (good, but not my favorite) and Aguacate con Cangrejo (so good!). For dinner we had: Paella Valenciana (very tasty!), Ropa Vieja (deliciously tasty), and Churrasco (absolute PERFECTION). Everything here is good though, as we've been several times.Value: It is a little bit more expensive but you certainly get what you pay for (both food and experience wise).This is probably the best restaurant in Hoboken.

We ordered two of the special cocktails to start: a delicious caipirinha infused with lemon and grilled pineapple (yum!!). This was the winner! The sangria was also delicious and full bodied as well as very smooth. We shared a special appetizer: salmon ceviche with pickled pineapple and onion with a kick of chili spice in there: this was one of the most delicious ceviche either I or my husband had ever eaten and we were 'wowed' at the fireworks of flavors and smooth textures in our mouths. The presentation was also very beautiful. We could see this was a very serious, experienced, passionate, and creative culinary master.  We ordered one of the appetizers on recommendation of the server who was warm and very helpful with suggestions. She recommended the fried mashed yuca which was so delicately fried and filled with a delectable and perfectly seasoned ground beef filling which contained sweet fried plaintain, white raisin, and served with a special relish and cream....this was one of the most delicious and complex and subtle yet satisfying things I have ever eaten in my life.  I was overjoyed to have discovered and experienced this traditional Cuban delight which was so meticulously prepared.  We then shared a salad of watercress, mint, cucumber, slivered carrot, avocado, tiny delicate anchovies served with a mustard-based dressing....also another explosion of perfectly paired flavors and textures in our mouths!  We left very happy and grateful indeed and will certainly be back.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

The hostess was more than happy and willing to move us when my husband explained and the manager (or owner - not really sure) even helped.

I really liked the salmon, and guacamole lovers can't miss The Cuban's version, which is served with crabmeat and plantain chips. The mojitos are also very good, with a few different variations on the classic available to try. It's also a fun spot for brunch, as long as you're cool with foregoing many of the traditional breakfast options you'll find at most other restaurants. The one caution I'd give as far as the food goes is that there aren't a lot of vegetarian options, so if you don't eat meat or fish, check out the menu before going. The place has a nightclub-like feel and can get very, very loud inside. Therefore, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for a romantic dinner.

Select beers are $3 a bottle. So you get a cocktail that is regularly $8-$11 for half that. Super good deal!Drinks are strong and delicious. Like mixing it up and trying a few at that price.*My favorite is the Pacha Agave - Milagros Tequila, Citronge, passion fruit, lime juice, agave nectar. Refreshing without to much sweetness. Balanced like a nice glass of limeade. Also during happy hour the bar menu is $5. Tapas style plates of empanadas, cuban sandwiches, and mini cuban burgers to name a few. All are really good deals. *El Cubano is my favorite and is probably the best bang for your buck too.Always a good idea to munch on something while sipping on a strong drink or five.-  DINNER - For my birthday I ordered a full 30lb suckling pig for the dinner party. (Note: You need to have a minimum of 10 people, and order 48 hours ahead so they can buy, prepare, and roast the hog.)OMG was it amazing! Everyone was so happy with the food.They presented the pig to us, apple in mouth, a true Kodak moment. Then back to the kitchen it went to be sliced and served. Heaping platters of mouthwatering pig came out for each section of the table, accompanied with moro rice, boiled yuca, and sweet plantains. This was all served family style. There is nothing like consuming a 30lb beast that brings people closer together.Only thing I wish they did was server the different cuts from the pig to us. As a foodie I get off on stuff like that. Ohh pig ear you say, don't mind if I do...a cut from the cheek - i heard that's the best part. LOL An awesome experience at a great restaurant. If you wanna know any more details shoot me a message.

I also think of city ""grit"" from the rough and tough characters that bring real life nightmares to innocent families. Fortunately, a very good-hearted girl told me that Hoboken has changed. Another friend told me that I had to check it out, saying that it has become a fun place. When I arrived, the city was somewhat nicer than I thought.Anyway, I went into this place, and I got a seat at the bar. It definitely has a sophisticated look, so you may have to look nice at this place. The Mojito Cubano drink was excellent. It was refreshing, the mint was not too strong, and it was not too sweet, and it was great complement to the food.As for the food, their Cuban Fried Rice is a good choice for a light meal, it can ordered as a side dish, and the price is reasonable. The flavor was good. I also had some Croquetas de Jamon, and they have a nice crispiness on the outside, and a decent savory flavor on the inside. My friends enjoyed the Cuban sandwiches offered on the bar menu. Interior is very comfortable, surprisingly spacious, and sometimes they provide some decently good live music. Service was fairly friendly. Overall, if you are looking to ""kick-start"" your evening in a place like Hoboken, this is a great start, especially if you want a good drink.

The final kicker was the ridiculous sideshow of a front  of the house service. We had a reservation which they mysteriously cancelled. No explanation or apology and then proceed to make us jump through hoops to get a table. They told us to we had to walk in and wait an hr, then 10 min into out wait, they said a table opened up but everyone had to be there ASAP before we could be seated or else we'd lose the table. This is all 45 min before our original reservation time, so it was a mad scramble for everybody just to get there. Very frustrating ordeal. But you want to know about the food. Like I said, the starters didn't disappoint. The crab guac with plantain chips was awesome and a dash of cutting edge that we yelpers crave! The truffle infused croquettes with braised oxtail meat was glorious. The dish usually comes with just 3 pieces, but the server was able to add an additional piece for us, for $2. You definitely want a whole croquette, trust me. Underwhelming entrees include ropa vieja, a classic dish which they didn't want to mess around with too much.

Drinks were decently priced. I ordered the mushroom tamale with cheese and it was just good. Not ravingly madly delicious, just good. The blend of ingredients almost made sense, but didn't agree as well as i thought they would. I was severly overwhelmed by my main entree that was seafood with green rice. (Forgot the name). I was itching to add lime and a bit of seasalt to enhance the flavors waiting to be bought out. I'm just disenchanted. Service was quick and polite but i had the nagging feeling of ""i could make this at home or find this food of same quality somewhere cheaper"".  Sorry guys. Para los hispanos, que comen en la casa.

We were asked whether we wanted to sit inside or outside. Tables were open in both areas. It was 45 minutes until close and it's a Tuesday night, so not very busy. We sat down and ordered wine and got two appetizers and a side since we didn't think we could finish a full meal. After we ordered, the waiter came over to us and told us that the outside seating area was normally reserved for people who ordered full meal but that they would make an exception since it's late and the tables weren't all filled. We felt totally caught off guard and ended up talking about this the entire time. Why wouldn't you tell us before hand? We could have sat inside and avoided feeling reprimanded for no reason. If you were going to let us sit here anyway, what was the point of telling us? Do you want us to feel uncomfortable? Really disappointed in the approach and experience.

The quality of the food, service, and drinks cannot be beat!It is a bit of a walk from the PATH, but I would happily make that walk in rain, sleet, snow, wind, and ice to dine here. When you enter, the restaurant is dark and intimate. There us a small dining area and bar. In the back is a much larger dining area with tall ceilings. The ladies bathroom is up the stairs on the right (sneaky!). I think the mens is up there too. Favorite Dish: Vaca Frita. Twice cooked crispy skirt steak, tomato escabeche, avocado, white rice, black beans, garlic mojo. The meat is crispy and awesome. The flavor combo of the components of this dish is right on point. I am salivating as I type just thinking about it. The dish is pretty darn huge... great as leftovers the next day too!Favorite App: Guacamole with plantain chips. It is also a large serving. The guac is fresh with lumps of avocado. I wasn't sure about the plantain chips at first, but they are a perfect pairing and are just the right amount of crispy. Favorite Drink: Mojito. Fresh mint and limes, complete with a sugar cane stick for garnish. Can't go wrong. Their bartenders always seem to have a heavy rum hand, which I definitely cannot complain about! Honorable mentions: Sangria (red is better), and Churrasco. Both delicious. Be warned: this place does get crowded during prime dining hours, so be sure to make a reservation.

This was definitely a cute treat but also very flavorful and tasty.Fried rice - I ordered this on the side and it came with eggs and bacon bits. Wow. Sweet. I mean sweet for real. hahaha. I added some salt and pepper to even it out but overall satisfying.Sandwich De Picadillo - Cuban version of hamburger helper. It's sweet so you might want some hot sauce on the side.

(Granted I've only been to about 15-20 of them)I'll start with the bread. Comes in a box, served with butter that must have some seasoning in it. Delicious. Butter spreads and melts perfectly to the bread.Appetizer- decided to go with the chicken empanadas as that's what most reviews say to get. Good, solid, hot (80% of food in hoboken comes out luke-warm not hot) and tasty. You can tell this is freshly made in house the chicken inside is moist and glazed with a form of verde sauce. Good but I will def try a different one next time.My gf got the veal chop with their version of fried rice. I tried some. Very good. Not personally a veal chop guy but the pieces cut very easily, was juicy and nicely cooked. Fried rice tasted like a homemade fried rice (I'm Chinese) with a Spanish spin. I got the short rib meal. WOW. The pieces of meat came apart so well, easy to eat, topped with deliciously seasoned homemade onion rings that were topped w cheese. All spread on some delicious creamy starch product (mash potato? Mash yuca? Idk it was a nice filler). What else was nice had to be the small slices of chorizo stuffed between meats and starch while everything was drizzled with their sauce marinade from the short ribs. Only complaint was that it wasn't hot enough but that's me knit picking bc it was good.I will disclose that although I wanted to I will definitely next time grab a mojito which not only I've heard is good but looked fantastic when I saw it walk by me.

This dish was AMAZING! The octopus was grilled to perfection, moist & delicate - I would go back for this appetizer alone, even consider ordering this as a meal. I was pleasantly surprised by the tenderness of this dish, my experience with octopus comes solely either as fried calamari or raw at sushi bars where the texture can often be rubbery when raw - this dish was no where near that texture. Wow!We also ordered the AGUACATE CON CANGREJO, their Cuban guacamole, lump crabmeat, plantain chips. Nice variation on typical guacamole, the plantain chips were perfectly fried, crisp, slightly salty, yet sweet. Would definitely order this again.For dinner, I ordered the PAELLA VALENCIANA, saffron rice, shrimp, bay scallops, mussels, clams, chorizo, chicken, garlic aioli. Great flavor! Not a morsel left on my plate after dinner.

The service was excellent and the restaurant is fit for small and large groups. However, due to the fact that we were a party of six and around other large tables the only negative remark I would make is there was to much noise from another table. Unfortunately we had to sit next to an entire bachelorette like party that were overly loud, and considering there's no carpet or curtains it makes for a noisy atmosphere, but I can't blame The Cuban for that. The drinks and food they were all really good. Our table had guac, empanadas, and rock shrimp for appetizers. The shrimp had a slight fishy taste and was probably the least liked appetizer. However the guacamole and empanadas were all well received. For entrees I tried the Pork Shank which was tender but wasn't served hot enough, the flank steak was delicious with that cilantro and oil chimichurri sauce. The Ropa Vieja was tasty as well, so all and all it was an enjoyable dining experience. For the price and the portions I think its everything you'd want and I'd say it met our expectations.

The service is prompt, the servers are friendly and courteous, and I also like the atmosphere of the place. It has a kind of subdued sophistication; there are no garish pictures on the walls or loud colors. Everything is coordinated and blends together well.On Saturday (08/30), my boyfriend and I decided to check out The Cuban for an early dinner. Although we didn't have a reservation, the place wasn't full, and we were seated within seconds. Servers immediately came to our table to take our drink orders and place full water glasses in front of us. I ordered a seasonal drink, the Sandia Mojito, which was mixed with mint, lime, and watermelon (there were actual pieces of watermelon in the glass too). Normally, I despise watermelon, but the mint and lime masked it so well that I wasn't bothered by it. My boyfriend ordered a Peach Caripirinha (which I still can't pronounce, however hard I try) which I thought was a bit bitter, but he enjoyed it.We split the Pulpeta for our appetizer, which was a cluster of meatballs served in truffle oil with mushroom fricassee and roasted shallots. It's a shame this isn't a full entree. I loved how the meatballs were cooked; juicy, tender, and with a hint of spice.For our main courses, I ordered the Ropa Vieja and my boyfriend ordered the Pork Porterhouse. My meal was huge and I couldn't finish all the meat, but I loved how it was prepared. The meat was shredded thinly but was not stringy at all, and it was cooked well. My entree also came with a side of white rice and black beans, and both were equally delicious. My boyfriend liked his Pork Porterhouse, although he did encounter some pieces of meat that were a little on the dry side. I cannot confirm this, as I only sampled a non-dry piece of pork. :-)For dessert, we split the Torta de Chocolate while my boyfriend had an espresso. The menu said the cake was ""chocolate sponge cake"", but it tasted more like devil's food cake to me. Regardless, it was incredibly light and came topped with fresh strawberry slices, chocolate caramel mousse, buttercream in the middle, and caramel sauce drizzled on the sides. I am proud to say I was able to finish the dessert when my boyfriend was too full, so this little gem did not go to waste.Throughout the entire meal, our service was excellent. At no point did we feel rushed, and we didn't have to search for servers when we finished our meal so they could pick up the check.

An absolute must dish.  Second entree was an interesting one- Grilled salmon over pumpkin mash.  Shaved apple, pumpkin seed oil and garlic make this dish really delicious.Sides - The steamed yucca with garlic and oil was probably the most tender yucca I have ever eaten.  The generous portion of sweet plantains was served slightly charred and sweet and moist inside.Dessert - Out came a very simple wooden serving tray, a blue paper bag and a small dish of chocolate.  This was a sinful combination of a bag filled with the most wonderful churros this side of the border.  I'm talking about light, crisp sweet flaky rods of fried dough here!  The chocolate sauce for dipping was a dark chocolate with a hint of orange liqueur to it.  This is a serious dessert!  Oh and along side this was a great custardy (no such word but hard to describe otherwise) Flan.  Sweet, thick and not drenched in syrup - just right!A coffee con leche to finish it all off.  This is a wonderful Cuban restaurant and one worth traveling to from Long Island just for dinner.  Next time though, I'm getting a designated driver because their SANGRIA and CAIPIRINHA  drinks looked so good.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

My boyfriend and I decided to stop by for brunch, and were initially taken aback by how empty it was.  Not sure if they tend to get busier for dinner, or if it was just a slow day.  Either way, we were more than happy to have the outside area to ourselves.  We decided to share some empanadas as an appetizer, and I ordered the ropa vieja for my entree.  Although we tend to avoid bread when it's handed out at restaurants, we inhaled the bread and butter that our server brought out for us.  Never would've thought that I would care that much for butter, but seriously, you'll regret not trying it.  It's also brought out warm, which made it all the better.The empanada appetizer was great, but really paled in comparison to our meals.  There's something to be said about the presentation, too -- my steak was prepared separately from the rice and beans, in a delicious pepper sauce that made it melt in my mouth.  My boyfriend chose a more traditional brunch entree (bistec a caballo) and his skirt steak was truly cooked to perfection. We actually had a chance to return for a second time -- I ordered ""el barrio"" and my boyfriend got the steak for a second time (why mess with a good thing?).  This time we also ordered drinks (a half pitcher of sangria) and dessert (tres leches for me, ice cream sandwiches for him).  Probably not the highlight of the meal, but still pretty good.  My advice is to skip dessert, maybe even appetizers, and just enjoy a ridiculously delicious and very filling meal.  Top notch service as well!",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

Upon his high praise I decided to take my wife there on a dinner date.I made a reservation days in advance and for good reason, when we arrived the restaurant was crowded. We were seated immediately, the place is bigger than what we originally anticipated. We looked over our menus and we went with the Aguacate con Cangrejo (Cuban guacamole with Crab meat) to start. It was light and very flavorful it was accompanied by thin sliced plantain chips the layers of flavor within the app were good and provided a nice depth to the simple yet tasty dish. We also ordered a pitcher of white sangria that was very good. We selected the Main Course which was the Classico, a dish composed of roast pork (which looked like a mini pernil) morro style rice, 3 pieces of fried sweet plantains and yuca with onion and garlic sauce. This dish was very, very good. It's portion size was great just enough to satisfy but may be a bit overwhelming for a light eater. The service was outstanding.

You can go to Union City, West New York and/or North Bergen for some slammin' Cuban eats at almost half the price. Nevertheless, The Cuban colored me impressed. We had the churrasco (skirt steak) which was fantastically juicy with so much flavor and the rabo encendido (ox tail stew) which was a tad bit bland but overall not bad. So at $28 for the steak and $24 for the ox tail I feel this can be a bit steep however let us remember...this is Hoboken. Higher rents, more people willing to pay up for tasty food without realizing they can go less than 2 miles for authentic Cuban food. Yeah, I guess the prices are fitting. I'm giving it 4 stars (technically 4.5 stars) because their Pisco Sour was mainly sour than pisco. The waiter was more than delighted to change for a mojito instead.

They played Spanish music the whole time but it wasn't loud to the point you couldn't have a conversation.Food:  The bread the put on the table, is soo delicious, it has cheese baked into it, but you can't really tell until you bite it (And I had given up cheese for lent, so this was a minor fail lol). The butter has garlic and (if you love garlic as much as I do) it is to die for.I had the paella, which was delicious, and made the traditional way.  Most paella is usually big portion, enough to share.  The size of this paella was not enough to share with another person, but it was also a bit too much for one person.  If you decide to share it, make sure you order another dish as well.My date had the churrasco, which came with yucca fries and salad. The steak was very good and the yucca fries delicious.Drinks: I forgot the actual name of the drink, but it has the word agave in it, and it pretty much had tequila, agave and passion fruit.  It was strong and sweet; simply delicious!  My date had the mojito which he liked.Service:  Waiter was friendly, attentive but not overbearing.Prices: Not on the cheap side; each dish was about $20-26.Overall, I would love to go back !",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

Walking from my table to the bathroom was scenic; the design and architecture of the building was very pleasing to the eye with different flights of stairs and seating on different elevations.Once the food arrived I could see it was arranged by a culinary artist, it captured the very premise of art and transfered it into a dish.

This is a 1 star treatment and would have been my conclusion at most other restaurants, their superior food/drinks are saving it here. My question to them: why be so cheap!? We're talking $5 variances here, and yet they just say its my problem and refuse to deduct it.

It's super weird and I feel like I'm waning with the couple across from me :/ It's our first time here and actually our first time in NJ period so we didn't have any expectations other than the ones here on Yelp. I made a reservation earlier which was fairly easy but ran late and showed up 30min later. When we arrived we waiting a few seconds before the hostess walked up to the door and the most awkward thing happened- she came up to us and literally just stared until I asked her for a table. No hello, how are you or welcome just a stare down. WTF? Then she asked if we were having dinner or drinks, I said dinner and she guided us into the back. Apparently the table she wanted to seat us at wasn't ready so we waited a few.The main thing I was looking forward to here was the classic mojito which I read came with a piece of caña/ sugar cane. I know it's silly but I love Cuban everything and a sugarcane in mojitos is hard to come by. So I ordered my drink and as it arrived I was really sad- NO SUGARCANE :( the Waiter said they were all out and that was that. Food was actually amazing. My sister had the vaca frita and I had the shrimp and green rice- both superb, hence the 4 stars. If they could improve on anything it would have to be the customer service. They're definitely quick and efficient but would smiling kill them? Also super weird but I got the feeling that they didn't want to speak Spanish. I feel awkward talking to my peeps in English but they actually refused so whateves.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

Pisco Sours, mojitos, sangria and a few others with some top shelf alcohol at $5 doesn't make me feel cheap but frugal for finding a place that isnt scamming me but providing me with a bargain, a true happy hour. I wound up having a half pitcher of sangria after a Pisco Sour, because I can drink like that and it was even more economical. It was very tasty, nice kick, yummy fruits.  I wound up not even finishing the whole thing because crawling out of the restaurant was not on my agenda.The bar menu includes empanadas,I had the veggie, which were tasty and mussels that were rich and a decent size, especially great at $5. The staff is fantastic.Warm, attentive and very friendly. I stayed for dinner and had the paella. This was not my favorite dish as I found it to be very watery, more like an asopado and had an unusual flavor that I couldn't pinpoint. Not bad just not what I am used to or like. I'm used to arroz bomba that makes a socarrat and a heaping portion.It  really was very very small for the price point. But you know, I like what I like.The manager heard me yapping up the bartender as one is want to do when alone at a bar and sent over a desert and after dinner digestive on the house because it was my BDAY, which was a really nice touch. Gracias.Clearly this place is on my go to Happy Hour list, nay, dare I say vying for the top of my list?Yes, yes I dare say it.I will definitely return, time and again to try different things on the dinner menu as well and I have a feeling once I do I'm going to be bumping them up to five stars, for sure or should I say ""Claro que si!""",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

The rope viewable is just like you remember your mothers -- if you're Cuban -- zesty and tender.  The classic roast pork is elevated with the use of the shank, crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside.  Some black beans and rice and Maduros and you are golden.  Of course, save room for some guava fritters for desert.  Then work it all off on the dance floor on the weekend.The location is great, right on Washington Street in Hoboken.  Easy access from all parts, including a short PATH ride from Manhattan and there is no excuse not to try this gem.  You won't regret it, and you'll be back often!",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

The bartender must have been distracted by Snooki because my second Mojito had no garnish.  Dos XX and Presidente light on draft were enjoyed by my husband.We ordered three appetizers. * Garlic shrimp with Yuca mofongo......brilliant, delicious.* Empanaditas.  not impressed..the meat seemed underseasoned but the black bean/goat cheese puree that they were placed on top of was delicious*Bacalao.  Baked cod with onion/tomato stew/corn cake topped with a sunny side up egg.  Visually beautiful, unfortunately, very bland and underseasoned to eat.  Perhaps they ran out, but there was no corn cake in our appetizer which I am sure would have been a lovely, contrasting taste and texture to the cod.  Instead, there were two slices of toasted bread served.  (see pic)Entrees:Sea bass with pineapple/lemon butter salsa.  Fish was prepared excellent, nicely salted crispy skin, perfectly cooked. Potatoes/spinach were bland accompaniment.Churrasco:  Skirt steak, very generous portion, perfectly cooked medium rare.  Side salad of baby greens delicious.  My husband opted for cuban black beans and rice instead of yuca fries.  Fantastic/authentic black beans....Sadly, we skipped dessert.  The Cuban Restaurant has some very nice innovative twists on traditional Cuban.  In my opinion, it is not a 5 star restaurant.  The ambiance is narrow and cramped.  Sitting dining patrons in a loud bar with tiny tables (even the waiter apologized for our small table that could barely fit the bread basket and two appetizer plates)  When our waiter read us the specials,he was completely inaudible due to the noise. So if you do decide to check out The Cuban, request to be seated in the Zebra room in back, because our bar seating felt like the jungle.Also,  parking absolutely sucks.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

Our group of girls decided to check out The Cuban for Happy Hour on a Friday and the prices are so reasonable you question whether or not you're still in the tri-state area. Two of us started out going for the cocktails and they weren't the run-of-the-mill house drinks on special, it was the fru-fru-fannnncy cocktails on special for a mere $5 each! I went for the Antiqua Havana (rum, pomegranate, sugar, orange, maraschino cherry & bitters), the bar tender likened it to a Cuban Manhattan but I felt like it was milder while still packing a punch. Next, the Siesta which was a margarita-ish martini - yum! Other HH specials included $5 sangria, $3 beers, and appetizers starting at $5. So, for HH alone, this place was totally worth it! But, we stayed for dinner.....Holy heck, dinner fantastic, too! We started by splitting the special appetizer, which they might as well put on the standard menu because it was super scrumptious! It was a ""pizza"" with braised short ribs and other yummy herbs and spices - plenty for our group to share. For our main meal my friends went for the salmon and steak entrees, but I was full so our waiter recommended the ""Bacalao a la Vizcaina"" appetizer and I was so overwhelmed by the menu that I agreed, even though I wasn't sure what I was getting into. The dish was plenty for dinner - it was a beautifully layered dish containing baked cod, onion tomato stew, corn cake, and an egg sunny side up. It was flavorful and a dish I will gladly order again! Also, let's talk about the service! When we were at the bar both bartenders were very nice, informative, and attentive. They even helped us find an extra stool so that the three of us could sit together. Then, one of the bartenders morphed into our waiter when we sat down and he was great! He answered all of our questions, was beyond well educated about the menu and offered fantastic suggestions. I never made it inside when it was ""Nine"" but I can tell that even from the outside peering in before, this place has undergone some serious changes.

Had a delicious grilled pineapple and sage caipirinha. And waited. And waited. Finally about 25 minutes after our reservation time we were seated. Whatever doubts we had were erased by the killer food. The soft shell crab special appy was a perfect combo of warm, oily, and acidic with the accompanying relish. Our entrees of skirt steak and paella were enough to feed a small village but each bite was a wonderful explosion of flavor. The manager Luis kindly came to our table and apologized for the wait, and offered to comp us drinks and dessert. Now at that point, we were stuffed but figured hey, why not?

The atmosphere was very dark and so noisy to the point where my boyfriend and I had to shout to have a conversation, even though we were sitting right next to each other. The noise alone was off-putting enough to make us consider leaving before we even sat down. The portions were huge, but both of us felt that everything was WAY too overpriced for the quality of it (I had twice-cooked beef, he had a chicken dish). My dish tasted like something I could have made in a crockpot (I'm by no means a very good home cook) and was a heap of shredded beef supplemented with basic white rice, black beans, and a sliced avocado.

Other than the plantains and rice I'm not sure what the other side was but I enjoyed it.Background volume level was perfect, as was the lighting and general atmosphere.

Like normal people order, we placed an order for appetizers while we were still deciding on what to settle for the main entree. The waitress told us that she can't take our order for appetizers and in order to start with appetizers we've to place the order for main course as well. Only when we placed the entire order, we were served the bread basket and butter which I found very cheap for the price they charge for their food.

In that review, I lamented the loss of a reliable, if unspectacular, nightlife option on Washington.Imagine my amazement, then, when I walked down that block Saturday night, only to see its new incarnation, ""The Cuban"", open for business. My friend and I walked in, hoping to see what new and exciting changes were brought about.Now, this wasn't exactly a late weeknight in a sleepy suburban town. This was Saturday night - a week after the place's grand opening - in a town buzzing with 20 somethings (on a night where the line for Black Bear was almost to the corner). The bouncer (a pleasant guy) also doubled as the coat check manager. He did inform me that the coat check - while mandatory - was free. I guess I had the look of a pauper on my face. The coat check was conveniently a small broom closet by the entrance. Not very classy, but I digress.The main bar...looked exactly like the old Nine bar. Down to the dark, ominous light settings and everything. Actually, they did make some changes. For one, they got rid of the TVs behind the bar. I guess that's considered a downgrade, not an upgrade? Not sureAnyway, the front bar was empty except for the bartenders. Weird, but everyone must be in the back I thought. We walk to the back room...again, identical to the old Nine layout. Well, except for the miniature fake palm trees at the bar. Also the lights seemed more ""orange"" than I remember.The back room had 4 people in it. By the time we got situated and ready to order, that party had left. So, there we were: my friend and I, the only 2 patrons, in a brand new, recently reopened nightlife spot. WTF Nine, get it together! Engage in some marketing. Flood Facebook / Twitter. Take out ads on MTV. Anything!So why does this place get a 3 instead of a 0? Well, for starters, they did have a few interesting Latin American beers in the back (which were curiously not even on the menu...comeon Nine!).  The bartenders were very friendly, and the music was actually pretty good (some salsa/merengue, to go with the Latin/Cuban theme). I suspect that this place will have some early hiccups, but in time I can see it become an interesting variation of a tried and true Hoboken restaurant/lounge theme.I just realized I called this place ""Nine"" instead of ""The Cuban"" several times in my review. Just goes to show how similar this place is to the old spot. If you liked it then, swing by and check out the new one.

Great date spot/place for get togethers/place to impress visiting family...so, clearly, awesome all around.The clincher for me? The yuca 'bread'.It's gluten-free, and is so soft and doughy that I'd take it over real bread any day. I'd suggest getting an appetizer (the plantains, especially), as the service is what I'd describe as leisurely-attentive. In terms of main dishes, the churrasco, for me, is the churrasco to which I compare all other churrascos (La Isla and Zafra don't even compare). It's a huge portion, with great chimichurri sauce, yuca fries (amazing), and watercress salad. Suffice it to say, there's never anything left to take home with me. If I go for brunch, my go-to is the Ensalada de la Finca, a nice light alternative.I'd go all the time if I could - but the prices (which I think are appropriate) are a bit prohibitive.

The atmosphere is less Caribbean and more local pub, though the dark red walls do give it a touch of a French bordello feel.The cocktails are well made, balanced and consistent.  The bar staff is a bit of a mixed bag.  On my visit, one bartender was very attentive and efficient, while the other seemed more concerned with chatting up the kitchen staff, being on the phone, or watching the television over the bar.The bar menu is quite nice; a good mix of lighter and heartier fair.  The pulpetas (Cuban meatloaf served here as meatballs) is rich and earthy with wild mushrooms piled on top.  The mix of mushrooms, pickled shallot and truffle oil combined with The Cuban's particular blend of cumin, smoked paprika and oregano seasoning in the meatballs themselves is definitely a curious combination.  My date was less kind in her assessment, likening the flavour to that of a certain part of the male anatomy. Oh well.The chorizo is nicely spiced, not overly laden with oil, and paired well with onions and peppers.  The shrimp ceviche, served in a tall glass, is well prepared, though definitely a bit fussy.  The flavours quickly became muddled and not even the unseasoned plantain chips that accompanied it could help settle the palate.Perhaps the star of the menu is the watercress salad.  It is a delightful mix of (obviously) watercress with other fresh veggies, avocado, some fresh mint and cilantro and dices of mango.  The presentation is attractive, with the entire salad constrained in a sash of thinly sliced cucumber, and lightly topped with a vinaigrette that is not at all overpowering.While perhaps not the golden fleece of Latin cuisine in Hoboken, The Cuban is an excellent choice for a relaxed, cozy - even intimate - experience.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

We had a reservation for 830 but due to ridiculous traffic on the Cross Bronx we called to let them know it would be more like 9 and the gentleman who answered the phone was very polite about it. We arrived at 8:45 and were seated immediately. It was VERY crowded so it was a bit noisy but the music was so loud I could not hear my date or the waiter. I think there was a drink special with some lemon and sangria? He came back to tell us the dinner specials and the entire time I was just watching his lips move and wondered if it would be rude of me to request the music be turned down a little. I think I heard something about fish with the skin on. Guess what, I said nothing and moments later the music was turned down. Yay! I was finally able to stop yelling WHAT across the table every time my date spoke. We ordered cocktails and looked at the menu some more and came to a decision at about 9:15 and continued our conversation.

I'm told back in the day Nine was an awesome place to go after dinner for drinks on a weekend. But at least since I've lived in Hoboken I've seen it draw in worse and worse crowds. Finally, Nine changed to The Cuban. Excellent food and an equally great atmosphere. I particularly remember the churrasco steak being mouth-watering. The service is as good as it can be. What constricts The Cuban from being a great place unfortunately is its layout and management. The layout is so narrow and confined in space that it often becomes hard to move around or fill enough people to limited seating. The hosts and manager, like most in Hoboken, are snobby about the wait time, as if this was true fine dining in Hoboken.

I'm pescetarian so I ordered the salmon and seriously it was HANDS DOWN the best salmon I've ever had. It was so full of flavor and done perfectly. I was ranting and raving about it all night. The dishes might be on the little pricey side but it is WORTH it. With the low lightning, The Cuban is the perfect date night spot.

Caipirinha was refreshing and had just enough kick to make us order a second round.  For dinner I had the Pollo Criollo which is Chicken with sweet plantain rice.  The sweet plantain rice was a nice surprise- I have never had the 2 mixed together in such a manner.  I would try it again.  My friend had the Paelle Valenciana.  She seemed to enjoy it and the little bit she shared tasted great! To end the evening we shared the Bread pudding - it was by far one of the best bread puddings I have had in a long time.  The evening was highlighted by the excellent service we received, not just from our waitress but from every server, bus boy, etc in the establishment.  Everyone checks on you, everyone serves you making for quick, yet seamless service!  I would return for the food and service.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

The atmosphere isn't really me, and the service could use a little work, but man, was the food good.We started with the oxtail croquettes and the octopus. The croquettes were light and crispy and the oxtail was tender and delicious. The octopus was cooked perfectly... super, super tender.For the mains we had the Bacalao (black cod) and the Enchilado (shrimp and scallops). The Enchilado had the shrimp and scallops in a very mild tomato / pepper sauce, and was served with a green rice that seemed cooked in cilantro with a hint of spice... just enough spice to say ""hello, just so you know, I'm here."" Only had a few bites of the Bacalao, but it was superb. Fish was moist and tender and flake, and the pureed yuca was smooth and delicious. Total for 3 drinks, 2 apps, and 2 mains came to $107 before tip.The place is dark and loud... and when I say loud, I mean, you struggle to hear the person across the table from you. The service, while super friendly, was less than attentive. Here is my example... drink #2 was finished along with the appetizers. I wanted to order drink #3, but the waitress did not return to ask until we were nearly done with the mains. That being said... the food overwhelms any critisims I had for the atmosphere or the service.If you go on a Friday / Saturday, you should probably make reservations... we left around 9:00 on a Friday, and there was literally not an open table (or spot at the bar) in the entire place.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

It s free dammit! Drink it and shut the hell up! Anywho, I ordered the guacamole with lump crab meat to start. I would have never thought of guacamole with crab meat, and I'm sorry no one did sooner. Hot damn, it was delicious. Better than guacamole at Mexican restaurants. For an entrée , I got the churrasco steak and I was not disappointed. It was juicy and flavorful! I got wood eating this steak!! Seasoned just right! For dessert I had the flan. Now at first , I looked at this tiny dessert and was kinda pissed. (What a shocker! Fat boy is bitching about portions again. How new!) Then, I tasted it. Now as a Latino which automatically makes you a flan connoisseur, I have to say I was impressed. It was firm but not hard. It was creamy and not too eggy. The burnt sugar had a slight char taste without tasting too burnt. Since it was rich, the small portion was just right.

My roommate and I travelled to Jersey to scope out some wedding venues for work. I happened to be on a search for some good Cuban food at the same time and this one popped up with some great reviews. It was also convenient because it was on the same street as Amandas, which was just a few blocks away. One gripe I had was the parking. We literally drove around each block for about an hour looking for a parking space on Washington or even on a side street. Finally we parked about five long blocks away. Walking into a packed Cuban bar/restaurant also didn't help because we were so hungry we assumed it would be a long wait. I was wrong because we were seated in the back room which was more like an event space. SO much space it was great. We ordered and the server brought out the most delicious Cuban rolls ever. I asked for a second basket which was a mistake because I started filling up on them before my food. I'm practicing vegetarian now so dining out is a little bit of a challenge. I ordered a few side dishes since I wanted to try the quality of the food. I had white rice and stewed black beans, side of sweet plaintains, and steamed yuca with pickled onions. All of my sides were so delicious and the rice was really soft. I was so full after that bread that the other half of my sides had to be taken home.

It has a good ambience and great background Salsa music.  I highly recommend the passion fruit mojitos. Their appetizers are quite small but yet so tasty.

531,GJ-maqorjFWq-gKrQpLi_w,Thomas W.,5.0 star rating,"This is a prime spot.  I've lived nearby for about two years and never tried it.  One time I tried to eat here, and it was too crowded which is never a bad sign.  We decided to give it another shot on a Thursday night because the menu looked appealing.We checked out the specials for the night outside, and they had a mojito deal.  I was already sold, but an appealing drink special never hurts.  Also, they have live Cuban music on Thursdays which really adds to the ambiance...which was perfect to begin with.  They played at the right volume to where you could still have a comfortable conversation.We decided to set up shop at the bar as we were not in the mood for a sit down dinner, but they have ample seating and everyone with tables looked very comfortable and content.  This is a plus in Hoboken as many of the tables are often too close and lack the privacy to have free flowing conversation.  This was not the case here.  When you walk in it seems rather small, but when you head to the back, it opens up to two levels of spacious seating.  This impressed me for what looks to be a small establishment from outside, it's actually quite roomy.  The decor is perfect and the place is very clean.  They definitely use the space they have to its maximum potential.Now for the food and beverage  The mojito was good, but next I opted for a pitcher of the red sangria with Grand Mariner.  It was a little pricey at $30 but was excellent and highly recommended if you like sangria.  I was intrigued by the octopus dish on the appetizer menu as I had tried it at another restaurant for the first time a week ago, and now I'm hooked.  I did not order it, however, but I plan to give it a go next time.  You can tell a restaurant is on point when you are planning your next visit while still enjoying your first experience.Again, we just ordered appetizers, but I predict dinner will be in my future.  We ordered mejillones con chorizo (mussels with sausage in a tomato based sauce covered in french fries with garlic lemon aioli).  This was phenomenal and all of the flavors were perfectly paired....bravo on this!  I'm still thinking about it now.  We also ordered the empanaditas con pollo.  These were small as the name implies but tasty and priced accordingly.  Last but not least, we had the yucca fritas which were drizzled with a garlic mojo and a chimichurri dipping sauce.  After sampling all of the dishes, it's hard to believe that anyone wouldn't be satisfied if not highly impressed with anything that they ordered on this menu.Hoboken has some great restaurants, but they also have a lot of mediocre restaurants.  The rents are high and any business that wants to survive and/or thrive here needs to bring something new to the table.  The Cuban does just that.  It provides wonderfully authentic Cuban cuisine with bold complimentary flavors that melt in your mouth.  They have a comforting ambiance combined with great service and a professional staff.  This place is a winner and I'm a huge fan.  I do not give FIVE STARS often.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"
532,NWLqOKl0Vxi7qK-6EoBLbg,Brandon E.,4.0 star rating,"This place is a great higher end Cuban option in town. Not hole-in-the-wall atmosphere that La Isla or Zafra give you. It's a smaller place inside but outside seating during the warmer months.The Cuban is a bit pricey for dinner and that deters me from going on a regular basis for a proper meal. BUT, the happy hour here is probably the best in town. There is a select list of $5 drinks. Now this isn't coors light and well vodka, these are driiiinks. They don't mess around, I don't know what I ordered I told the bartenders to surprise me and did they ever. The drinks are strong but flavorful and for $5 you can't beat this. They also have an awesome selection of $5 ""tapas"" and I use that term lightly because you could eat some as a meal. I had the chorizo/beef sliders and I can honestly say they were the greatest sliders I have ever had in my life. It was a party in my mouth and these sliders were the host. The fries cooked in duck fat, great googlie mooglie! For what you are paying no doubt the best deal between 4-7 Monday- Friday out there. The bar is small though so get there and get a spot before this best kept Happy Hour secret gets out.Brunch, awesome. I got the sliders again, well just cause I mean they are that good. My wife got the ""eggs Benedict"" with ham and braised beef and corn biscuits...yup grand-frickin slam. You'd be a traitor not to order these (see what I did there, fellow history geeks will get it).  It was huge and for $12 a meal for 2.As for dinner, it's been awhile since I ate here at dinner because it is a little too pricey I feel, that's why no 5 stars.

Sometimes I worry that positive reviews in Hoboken are compared to other restaurants in Hoboken, which, unfortunately, doesn't set the highest bar. But no, The Cuban is good compared to anywhere, including New York. What I loved about it was that every dish was rich and strong, the way you typically think about Cuban food, but it was also so subtle. This is what made it, I think, better than Cucharamama (the other contender for best restaurant in Hoboken). In every dish there were flavors that stuck out, but there were also hidden lingering flavors that were hard to place and made it each dish complex and interesting. Before I get to the food, the ambience is nothing spectacular, but it is intimate and inviting. It's a small restaurant with one row of tables and a bar. The lighting is low and intimate and the colors are dark and rich. Decoration is minimal, just some old photographs of Cuba. It feels comfortable. I care a lot about ambiance, because the aesthetics really affects my whole perception of a place right down to the taste of the food. The Cuban doesn't look spectacular but it certainly doesn't detract from the food.Also the service is great. They are very attentive, frequently asking if you need anything and clearing silverware, plates and then cleaning the table after each course. Our waiter was quite friendly and down to earth.The drinks were great. I had El Macho, which was sweet, tangy from orange and lime, and spicy from jalapeño. We had goat cheese croquettes, which were so soft and flavorful, then a playful salad with clover and other greens, mango, cherry tomatoes, other delicious things and can't remember, and it was all artfully bundled up in strips of cucumber. Food presentation won't blow you away, but it is definitely thoughtful and creative.For our main we had Salmon and vegetable paella.

Noise level was at a regular level for a Hoboken restaurant, very easy to hold a conversation.   OK for the most important part I had the skirt steak meal which was about $27 and well worth it. A generous portion which I had cooked medium rare, which just melted in my mouth, it had a chimichurri sauce on top which was also delish. The meal came with fried okra and small spring salad which the bitterness worked well with the dish, and I had to go with a Dos Equis XX draft. I highly recommend and would definitely go again.

565,tj5EhTv4Q2WoQCL6ZMYItA,Margo G.,3.0 star rating,"After reading a review in the NY Times, we decided this would be a good place to try. My husband and I went with two other couples. We're all good friends and don't get to go out together too often so were looking forward to a night of good food and conversation. The drinks were wonderful, the food fine but, forget conversation. The multi-level open space with high ceilings made the noise level too high for 6-person conversation. I was able to speak with the two people on either side of me but felt like I needed to shout to the others. Perhaps that wouldn't have been the case had there been only four of us or if we had been seated downstairs but, as it was, we got the noise from our floor as well as from the one below. I realize that many people wouldn't be bothered by a high level of noise but, if that's something that would impact your enjoyment, this might not be the place for you.About food, drinks, and service: Three of us ordered specialty drinks and loved them. The other three went with Sangria and enjoyed it very much. Appetizers were delicious. Entrees had mixed reviews as did desserts. I'm not inclined to race back here for dinner but I wouldn't say no to it either. However, if I was going with a group again, I might plan for a night other than Saturday.A word of warning: As tough as it is to find on-street parking in Hoboken, keep trying!

566,Q_M8IMnNNF9bnPOqlxmBIA,V K.,1.0 star rating,"Tried to eat at the restaurant last night with a Group. We ended up losing our reservation as everyone got stuck in traffic. The table is only held for 15 min and the entire party must be present prior to being seated. I understand this and this is a common policy at multiple restaurants. And I had no problem with this fact. However, the hostess at the restaurant was very rude when she informed me of this fact. And I wish that was the only bad part of trying to eat at this establishment. As people from our party arrived we waited at the bar and got drinks. We finally got a table when a majority of our party arrived. As some people cancelled as they were going to be severely delayed. One extra person showed up after we got seated and that was when the true problem started. The manager came over to the table to explain that this was not appropriate and that we couldn't add a chair. I do have to say she conducted herself professionally. Then the ""hostess with the mostest"" came to the table irate informing us that we couldn't just keep adding people to the table. We apologized. She continued to be rather inappropriate. I finally asked if she would like is to get up from the table we were seated at. She said yes. So my entire party got up paid for the drinks we had ordered from the waiter who had already taken our drink order and left. We ate at another establishment a short distance from The Cuban.

I have lived in Hoboken for nearly five years and never even noticed it existed. Glad we found it. The place is crazy deceiving in size. You walk in to a somewhat busy bar area with a few booths, and walk towards the back to three separate areas - all of which are nicely decorated (although I am not a zebra decor fan). Our server was awesomely attentive and made great suggestions on what to get. We ordered the Empanada sampler (three different versions). All of them were delicious. Not the best I've ever had, but very good and creative. We also got the guacamole with crab. Holy shit it revolutionized guacamole for me. Crab meet, people! And served with banana chips....? C'mon! For an entree I ordered the pollo a la parrilla. Delicious. I think I could have slept on/with the roasted Kobocha. My fiance ordered the pollo criollo. The meal was really amazing and had so many great flavors in every bite. The thing to know is that you cannot compare this to other Cuban joints in Hoboken like La Isla. That is more greasy spoon Cuban comfort food. This is more upscale, creative with South American influences. I highly recommend coming here. It is a great addition to Hoboken and should be rewarded not only for the great quality, made from scratch menu, but for how it runs like a well oiled machine. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is the empanada sampler. This is 5 star dinning for Hoboken, no doubt, but I want to try to be fair and not just drop five stars anywhere.

Knowing that it had recently opened, I was surprised by the glowing reviews it was getting. It certainly lived up to the hype, and then some.We ordered the veggie empanadas, the beef empanadas, and the ham croquettes to start. We only ordered that much because we thought there would only be one empanada per order; instead, you get three beautiful empanadas for just $6. Just after splitting open the veggie empanada, I was immediately drawn in by its incredible fragrance. It tasted just as good. The beef and the croquettes were fantastic, too, but the veggie empanadas were truly out of this world.The main course was outstanding. The boneless half chicken ... right from the start, you're hit over the head with great flavor. Not sure if I've had more flavorful chicken than the one here. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't finish my sides, perfectly prepared plantains and a huge portion of delectable tomato manchego rice, because of the blissful food coma I was slipping into.I just thought that seating was restricted to the front of the restaurant, but hiding behind the corner is an enormous, multi-level back room, complete with a second bar that opens on the weekends.At the end of the night, I was so wonderfully full and my parents were extremely impressed with the choice.

595,5797M9iaO4tlczdKT-nyTA,May L.,5.0 star rating,"ADHD Summary: Classy! Cuban food in a gorgeous atmosphere with a lot of attention to small detail. Great drinks. Group friendly. Perfect for a date or the start of a fun night.Clearly I am a Manhattanite and we rarely venture off the island. It's really only the special people that can drag me away from my land of dirty trains that never run correctly and the constant sound of engine outside my door.  But among other reasons, the girl leaving my office was having a shindig; and I wanted to be a part of wishing her well. So off I went with 15 other people to explore the Ken of the Hobo.I struggled between 4 and 5 stars; settling on 5. Whether it keeps those stars depends on its ability to continue to operate at such high levels. Currently, this newly opened place is not as crowd that I would expect it to eventually be. So you get there now before it gets too jammed.The Atmosphere:  This really is a 5.  It's worthwhile to pay attention to the small details. I spoke with the owner (see service down below).  Apparently all of the pictures are from Cuba done by a friend of the family. This includes a gigantic wall mural ad with all of the beautiful photography strewn tastefully throughout the restaurant. As you enter, you'll see the adorable rock walls and the colorful tiles that are so popular in Latin America. The multi-colored glass lighting and primitive-style Latin art make a difference to what is otherwise a very modern restaurant. Of course the random zebra couch suggests a certain ability to turn this place into a salsa dinner club at some point. There are three floors; the second of which is a bar that could probably hold 20 comfortably (more if you're all Asians). The bathrooms are up a long steep walk to the third floor. I'm not going to lie; being sober makes that climb up and down easier. The bathrooms are nice; done in flat metallic finished tiles, with crisp white framing around the windows. The trick as they get larger is to make sure they stay nice and full of T.P. despite the trek up and down.  Overall, the lighting is perfect for the evening. If it were for me, I might play with better lighting around the artwork and dimming the recessed lighting around the back seating area.The food:  Muy deliciouso. This is upscale Cuban; so it's not just cheap salsa and nachos splashed about everywhere. I was with a large party for which they had a great menu - $20/person for tapas appetizers and $28/person for entrées and dessert. Tax and tips came to around $60 after our drinks. We ate a lot. Here are the highlights:- Drinks in a pitcher. I'm such a fan! You can get sangria, mojitos (not on the menu) and this elderberry and cava; sangria-cousin type drink, which I loved. These are $24.- The bread. These are the shape of donut holes.  It is so fresh! Even the German guy in the group was willing to renounce his heritage if only he could get this bread daily. He was also a bit of a bread hog. So I think I only got to scarf down a fraction of that which came down to the table. Seriously, yum.- The cereviche mixto and the Chicken empanaditas were my favorite apps. So cute to see a mini empanada.  - For main dishes, get the Churassco (skirt steak) with extra chimchurri sauce, make your friends get the Paella, and if you have another friend suggest the Bacalao (white fish). I'd also order rice and beans, because...come on...what is cuban food without rice and beans!- For dessert, I had Tres Leches, and others had Flan. Cuban flan is a bit thicker than Spanish Flan, which I prefer, hailing from Florida. The Tres Leches has a lovely flavor if you love the texture of soaked cake (it's soaked in goodness!).Service:  The owner appears to recognize the importance of being attentive to customers and is clearly there making sure things are running properly. They had a lot of bus boys, but fewer wait staff. Everything was delivered quickly despite the bottomless pit of bread consumption at our table.  The bus boys may have some English difficulty; but they do appear to try to be as helpful as possible.Final Notes: The backroom is really well set up for large parties.

Recommendations: Truffle fries cooked in duck fat; Rabo Encendido (yes, I know oxtail sounds strange but it really is the most tender meat you'll ever try); Pollo Imperial (cheesy chicken casserole); and the Bread Pudding dessert (anything with candied bacon gets 5 stars in my book).",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

They will be doing Brunch on the weekends starting sometime in the spring and also have outdoor tables. Inside they have 2 bar areas upstairs and down. They also have the Zebra Room which is an intimate dining room -let me be straightforward- the room is DownRight Sexy! This place should be on everyones list!!!  Again I have to say the food is to die for AND the service rivaled that of the Jules Verne in the Eiffel Tower.(Yes!

The portion sizes are large (I ended up having enough leftover to eat for lunch the following day). The churrasco was topped with a chimichurri sauce and was absolutely delicious. The yuca fries were slightly sweet but crispy. My only complaint was the arugula salad, it tasted as if only olive oil was drizzled over it.

We were seated in the front of the restaurant, and I really liked the decor / bar set-up. Didn't get a chance to peek into the back but I here there's a lot more seating. Also outdoor seating.The food - very tasty. It's not a huge dining menu but they seem to have the Cuban staples covered. Also just saw that they have a bar menu which is sweet. Went with the meat / cheese plate app (too much blue cheese, but the manchego and other meats were on point) to share and the pollo a la parrilla for dinner. My booshakes had the bistec empazinado and couldn't finish it but asked to wrap that shiz up without batting an eye.Drinks - tried the special gin mojitos. They were dankity dank but loaded with ice, and should have been bigger for a $9 bev. But alas, they were so delicious that I still crushed 3 and had no regrets.Yes the food/bar is on the pricey side, but this place stands out among the cookie cutter spots on Washington.

The Cuban is probably my favorite restaurant in Hoboken, so it was an obvious choice to bring my friends from out of town here for dinner. I made a reservation 1-week prior to coming, 8 PM on a Saturday night. Saturday came and I arrive at the restaurant prior to my friends, say my name, reservation for four at 8 PM to the hostess. She checks her book and tells me she has no one by that name then asks for my phone number, again nothing. I informed her that I called a week ago, spoke with a man and that he took my phone number and said I was good to go. I showed her the record of the call in my phone. She informed me I called the wrong number and that it would be an hour wait for a table. Thanks for accommodating me.I walked outside and compared the phone number I called to the number on their delivery van. It was the same number. I looked up the phone number via google (same thing I did when booking my reservation) and again, it was the same number I called to book my reservation and the same number printed on the van, so I hit call to ensure I wasn't crazy and that it was the correct The Cuban. It was. The person I spoke to on the phone was about as accommodating as the hostess. I stormed inside to inform them they clearly have two lines and they proceeded to insist I was still wrong. So I called the ""wrong"" number and guess what? The phone rang!Alas, still no table and no one even tried to accommodate this very pissed off patron. A friend who was meeting me for dinner proceeded to call the restaurant, lashed into them and somehow got them to agree to give us a table at 8:15 -- thankfully a reservation didn't show.Fast forward to 8:45. Were still not seated. They kept telling us we would be next and yet other people were seated around us. The entire time we were waiting the hostess kept pushing us out of the way and was downright rude and dismissive. A couple was waiting next to us, they had an 8:30 reservation and didn't sit until 9. Something is very wrong with their reservation process. I understand being busy, but before you take a reservation you need to ensure you'll be able to seat the party. Table turnover is a good thing.We finally sat around 8:45 and asked to speak with the manager. Again, not accommodating and didn't seem phased by the series of events that unfolded earlier in the evening but promised our food would be out promptly since we had to be somewhere at 9:30.Thank god the food and drinks were and are good or else the night would had been an even bigger disaster than it was. The manger comped our one round of drinks - gee, thanks.Needless to say, I won't be back for a while and next time I do go, I'll needlessly triple confirm my reservation and will make it for a half an hour before I actually want to eat since that's how long it seems to take to be seated.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

713,DuDZP1-aXupLlPLS5FyBRw,Elizabeth S.,5.0 star rating,"I have been to many cuban restaurants in NYC and none of them compare to The Cuban Restaurant and Bar.I made same day reservations, the earliest was 6pm for 7 people on Saturday. I arrived there a few minutes before 6:30pm due to traffic. I came from the Bronx and as you can imagine the GWB and Lincoln tunnel on weekends is a nightmare. Either way I let them know I would be there by 6:30pm and they were nice enough to hold our table until then. 1. Service -  Excellent service from the moment you walk in. They offered us coat-check and proceeded to take us to the back room. A cozy area perfect for dinner and a semi-private conversation. The staff were very thoughtful and attentive, we enjoyed our dinner so much more because of that. A few things that stood out were when my sisters got up from the table to use the restroom, the gentleman came over, folded their napkins and placed them on the table. Also he made sure the three tables put together for our party were always aligned properly. 2. Food - We ordered a few appetizers and entrees but the most memorable were: App: Ceviche de camaronApp: Camarone con tamal en cazuelaEntree: ChurrascoEntree: Paella ValencianaDessert: Pastelito de chocolate One more glass of sangria and the staff would have received hugs from me, it was very tempting :)",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

We made reservations earlier that day and were able to get in during the time we wanted. The restaurant has a great vibe and is much, much bigger than you would expect from the street.Pros: The food was excellent and the drinks were pretty good too. I had the half chicken breast with plantain fried rice and my boyfriend had the Ropa Vieja and we were both really happy with the food. It came out quick and was very hot and very tasty. I cant speak much to the authenticity of the food, but we will definitely go back for more. Prices were very reasonable too. Both of our entrees were around $18-19 and we got a ton of food.Cons: Service was so-so. The waiter had us move our table after we had already ordered and received our drinks and bread because they needed to make room for a party of 10. We didn't really mind until he asked us to do so and then ignored us - he didn't help us move over our drinks or bread plates or anything. After that we were obviously 2nd priority to the large party of birthday girls. We had to wait a while to order more drinks and had to ask for the check multiple times.Overall, The Cuban is a really nice place for a date or a group of friends to grab a nice dinner.

I made a reservation a month ago for a table for two on a Saturday night. I started to worry after reading some of the reviews on here, but ultimately put it out of my mind because I had a confirmation email. Of course, when we got there, they had no record of the reservation. Really?? Online reservation systems are pretty standard, and I've never had a problem before. That being said, they were still able to quickly sit us at a table in the bar area, so I was happy. However, we were seated next to an extremely loud, absolutely wasted couple (mind you, this was at 7pm - unless the Cuban was their last stop on an epic day of drinking, I have no idea how they were that drunk so early). This couple had just finished off a pitcher of sangria as we sat down, and spent the next 15 minutes singing, yelling at each other, and making out. It was so disruptive that whenever they got loud, the entire bar area turned around to look at them. After a while, I got up and complained to the host about them, who reassured me that they were about to leave. He must have said something to them, because they got up and left right after that. That being said, someone should have intervened far earlier than that.

748,DBFHODbHk0-EIZQqaPen7A,Jonah P.,5.0 star rating,"Best restaurant in Hoboken, without a doubt.  I hate rating anything ""5 stars"" on yelp, but when you're three hours out from your meal, and your conversation is still lingering on dinner, it seems appropriate.There's a great energy to the place, which hits you the second you walk through the door with the bright red motif and smells of citrus, garlic and grilled meat.  The drink menu is focused on rum and tequila-based cocktails, but injects creativity with original recipes.  The food is the true star, though.  Prices may seem at the higher end for Hoboken, but considering the appetizers are the sizes of typical entrees, and entrees are more than enough for 2, the prices turn out to be very reasonable.  No dish at our meal was short of spectacular.  All beautifully balanced richness with acid, and introduced me to new and exciting flavor profiles.  I'd hate to recommend one or two if that means someone might pass over another dish they might otherwise order, but safe to say, you can't miss.  My only regret was not saving room for dessert.  One tip: make a reservation.  The front space is tight, and seats are hard to come by on Friday or Saturday nights.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

With no dinner plans on a Friday night, we decided to check this place out because we love Cuban food and it's also super close to our apartment. I always liked the layout and space of Nine, so I was curious as to how this would work with a new restaurant and I was very impressed! It was crowded for a Friday night, and the owner brought us to the upstairs bar while we waited about 10 minutes for a table. We were then seated in the front area, and I was so happy to see that the tables weren't as cramped together as some other Hoboken spots (one of my biggest pet peeves about dining out). The service was phenomenal, and the waiter was so good about being thorough and answering our questions. The drinks were great, too. I opted to get a half pitcher of white sangria for myself, since that was $14 and a glass was $7. Well, I definitely left with a nice buzz. It was a classy and economical way to get a little wasted. And the food! Oh, the food. Loved the small rolls and butter, and we got two apps - the fish taco special and masitas con tamal en cazuela, and both were amazing. My boyfriend got the paella for his dish and was so happy with it, that he said this would be his go-to dish anytime we come back. I was back and forth on what to get, but I finally settled on the el classico (braised pork shank) and as soon as it came out, I literally said ""Yup, I totally made the right decision"". It was a tasty and generous portion, and I also got the yuca fries on the side and LOVED them! Some of the best I've had. They weren't as dry as they are at some other places I've tried them at. We'll definitely be back. In fact, we made a reservation on the way out to come back for my boyfriend's birthday to do the suckling pig special. With 4 days notice and at least 10 people, you get a whole pig at market price! Can't wait.So I'm thinking the breakdown of Cuban food in Hoboken goes something like this: this place blows Havana Cafe out of the water with food, and if you're looking for a down and dirty, quick good Cuban dinner, go to La Isla. This place is the real deal for a fun night and upscale ambiance with amazing food. Can't wait to come back!",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

We all shared appetizers and I'm so glad we did because I was able to try quite a few...Rock shrimp is spicy and flavorful with perfectly cooked shrimp in a tangy sauce...Empanaditas, you have a choice of 3 different ingredients, I chose the ropa vieja which was succulent and delicious, not at all greasy...camarones ajillo were so delicious...another girl enjoyed the seafood paella...you really can't go wrong.

We decided on doing a tasting of appetizers which worked out well. For drinks, my husband wound up having 3 mojitos, obviously they were authentic and excellent.Appetizers: Calabaza -Roasted kabocha, crispy goat cheese, toasted almond,arugula, pumpkin sherry vinaigrette - unique combination and very good.Empaniditas -Chicken fricasse, chard tomatillo, onion vinaigrette. Great stuffing, not greasy.Masitas con tamal en cazuela- this was definitely taken up a notch with a very crispy, thin onion topping and  ""short rib like"" pork chunks.Bacalao a La Vizcaina -Salted cod fish, onion tomato stew, sweet corn cake, sunny egg. This dish was absolutely delicious and well presented.Of course, as a true Cuban, I had to try the black beans / white rice and maduros. All good.  After being so stuffed, my husband deicides to try the Frituras-Lightly fried dough filled with guava and cheese, salted caramel, citrus chocolate sauces. They were excellent. At that point, I was overstuffed and beyond.Read about the suckling pig from other Yelp contributors, that sounds interesting and worth a try (minimum of 10 people).The Cuban offers ambiance and upscale Cuban Cuisine.

First of all, I'm not Cuban and know nothing of the food so this is a restaurant review not a Cuban restaurant review.       That being said, I really loved almost all the food. There was a braised pork shank on the menu and I love lamb and veal shank so I gave it a try. I thought it was amazing. Full of flavor and richness and absolutely tender and moist. I'm a salt lover and there was no salt on the table which I thought  was weird but though the dish was in no way salty, it had such a richness of flavoring that even for me, no added salt was needed. My co-diner had a skirt steak that was also fantastic. It was called twice cooked, and we were a little leery since we both like our steak barely cooked and were expecting, well we didn't know what to expect but lets give it a try. This dish too was excellent. It came out rare as requested, tender and again, seasoned so well. It was great! Again, not salty but richly seasoned. We also tried a ceviche special and that was just okay, The sauce it was in over-powered the delicate flavor of the shrimp and scallops. This was the only hiccup of the night.     Service was nice and attentive, great young lady at the bar and a very nice manager  who we spent a little time talking to. This place is not cheap but not expensive either. Well worth the price and portioning was not glutenous but more than adequate. We sat in the back so it was quiet and fairly empty but upon leaving we saw that the front was full and had a nice vibe. Outdoor dining was also full though it was a little nippy outside.      As to the happy hour, if that's your thing then give this place a try. Five dollar drink menu and five dollar apps and tapas type things. We tried the empanadas, very good. and the Cuban sandwich which was delicious and a steal at five dollars. The two combined would have been a great meal for ten bucks.

The appetizers took seconds to come out, which only means they were not freshly prepared.

(when the craving hits again, oh, within a few weeks)....   (OH - I took a trip to the ladies room - which was very clean and well-stocked) - the place is way bigger than you think!  There are 3 levels!!!  There's the bar area, with tables along the wall on the other side, then there's a smaller room toward the back of the building, then go up a flight of stairs, and there's another room - which seems like a good place for a private party, or a bigger group.  Bathrooms are on the 3rd floor (which now that I think about it - may not be handicapped accessible...just FYI)....",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

819,eovbRAe5rekamkAQt5ofaQ,J C.,4.0 star rating,"One of my two favorite restaurants in Hoboken (the other is Anthony David's). This is a newcomer and I'm so glad they opened up! First, the drinks are amazing. I had a blueberry mojito special that was so good I always hope they'll have it again when I go. My boyfriend loves El Macho (not just because of the name haha)...it has a really nice spicy flavor. If you're looking for something light and refreshing, the sangria is solid and the rosada is AMAZING- a sparkling bev with strawberries and guava, umm yes please!Next, I HAVE to comment on the bread. Soooo good. I think it's called yuca bread and it has cheese baked into the dough. I saw a couple reviews that commented the bread was ""weird"" or not baked through- well that's because it's not typical bread! It's so much better than typical bread...I've been for dinner a bunch of times. The empanadas appetizer is very good (3 different kinds) and the pulpo is amazing. For entrees, the pollo criollo is a MUST and a highlight of the menu. The rope vieja and vaca frita are both amazing as well. I've tried a couple of the fish entrees as well and they were all good. (Yes, I've been here quite a few times).Went for brunch once recently with the fam and the overall consensus was that mostly everything was great as usual...but I actually ordered the only dish I've ever been disappointed in at the Cuban. I ordered El Barrio and I don't know if this is how it's supposed to be made but it was basically like black bean soup with a sunny egg and the other ingredients floating in it. A huge bowl of beans and not much else to go along with it? Not my thing. Although their beans are quite good.I like the ambiance and how there is a bar room in the front and more of a dining room in the back. A man who I assume to be the owner is omnipresent--you can tell he runs a tight ship but hey, can't argue with the delicious results.I will definitely be back again and again, but most likely for dinner rather than brunch.

Table on the front of the house are a little too small - tight, in front of the bar almost for squeeze in diners. Back rooms, divided on two mezzanine makes it great for private parties and larger parties. Service generally speaking is in need to be reviewed. The wait stuff is pleasant and cordial but in need for some serious menu training. No need to know if the special cocktail is $5 if I am told the specials after I place my order. Beets salad was good. However too much dressing with a tangy taste of citrus overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the oranges and goat cheese spread which taste like Greek yogurt. Pork was dry and almost taste it that came out of fryer after being precook. Wine menu a little limited but will explore cocktails and potential drinks next time. Could definitively use some room for improvement. It's not a bad restaurant, perhaps it shine through the Hoboken - flat - insipid - expensive - and pretentious places with low quality food and no sense of style charging NYC prices at a WHOPPING $28 main course.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"

The waiter was absolutely the best and very attentive. Also, i believe it was the owner, had come around to check on us, which was very nice. They were having some specials on some drinks so we ordered the mojitos, which were perfect. The drinks were on special for $5 which was great. We then ordered the gaucamole with crab meat and plantain chips as an appetizer. This was absolutely delicious and enjoyed every bite. For the entree my boyfriend and I each ordered the skirt steak and substitued the yuca fries for rice and beans. The steak was so juicy and cooked to perfection. And the portions are huge. Had enough leftovers for lunch the next day. Although it even with the $50 voucher, we still ended up paying $60 extra(with tip) it was well worth every penny. All in all, it was not a bad price for an appetizer, two entrees, with a side of beans and 4 drinks.  There are many cuban locations in the area, but this is by far my new favorite.

We're food enthusiasts, appreciating quality service and well executed dishes. Coming to an ethnic place like this can always be hit or miss, and this is definitely a hit! The atmosphere was really neat, upfront was the bar area with high top tables for a more casual dinner or happy hour, we were led to the back of the restaurant, stepping down into a room lined with mirrors, and zebra print seating along the wall, super chic and funky. Our server was very personable and ready do take our drink orders after we were seated. She made some recommendations, along with her personal favorites, and seemed to be very knowledgable about the ingredients in all of the cocktails, this helped, considering there were SO many choices. Warm bread was promptly delivered to the table, along with soft garlic butter.   The bread was not stellar, definitely under baked and doughy, but they had the right idea. On to the main course, I got the braised pork shank, served over black beans and rice, with a citrus slaw on top, DELICIOUS. Cooked to perfection it fell off the bone. My boyfriend ordered a twice cooked skirt steak with avocado, and rice and beans, it was also very good. The steak came pulled/shredded, which was not expected but pleasant. His mom got the paella valencia which looked alright, a good amount of seafood. I am biased with paella, after living in Spain, she enjoyed it though! Bussers came by frequently to refill waters and clear any empty dishes. Even though we were stuffed, dessert was definitely a must. Being in the baking industry whenever going to a cuban place I always have to try the tres leches cake. It was everything I hoped and more, AWESOME! Traditional house baked vanilla cake, fluffy and yet dense, thoroughly soaked with the 3 milks, topped with a gooey toasted meringue. Pretty close to the best tres leches cake I've ever had. Overall it was an awesome meal and I would love to come back and try out some different items on the menu. Very reasonably priced considering the portions are generous.

837,C75jHIcrMfmcOG3oh9uDdg,Iris X.,5.0 star rating,"Went to this place with my colleagues. This place is so great, both for groups or dating. The food was delicious and fresh. First we were served with drinks ans appetizers in a private bar, the drink looks so great and taste so fresh even I who don't drink had a glass and got a little dizzy :). I don't remember the names of the appetizers, for there're too many, I almost thought we won't have dinners. But I remember the one likes a fried ball with beef  and cheese, the beef can melt into your mouth. For the dinner, most of my colleagues chose Churassco (skirt steak), but I chose BACALAO (black cod) though I was told Churassco was the best. However, I love my choice. I love fish, and especially fish with tender meat texture. Black cod was slightly fried, but the fish didn't lose its tender texture. I also tasted my colleagues' Churassco, it was cooked perfectly. Oh, I nearly forgot one important thing in this restaurant. It has the best bread ever! Round like a small egg, the inside is chewy, like the gummy bear, but it's bread! Overall I gave it 5 stars for the food and the experience.",The Cuban Restaurant and Bar,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Cuban,, Latin, American"
