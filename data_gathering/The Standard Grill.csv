Mark started as our server, he's super friendly and has a great head of thick curly hair (I'm a curly girl so I appreciate a good head of curls! Lol) mid way through he had to take his break so Katie took over, she is super warm and friendly. They both were quick to observe if something was missing and get whatever we needed.Now for the food...I started with the Pecan Sticky Bun...great flavor but should have been served warm. Katie told me I could request it that way next time. For my meal I got the eggs benny, perfect amount of hollandaise with a little Dijon mustard, American has over Canadian the bread used instead of the typical English muffin was delicious. I opted for a mix green salad instead of the potatoes to be some what ""healthy"" but then my husband ordered a side of potatoes so I had some anyway. Sooo glad I did because they were amaaazzzing!!

1,Cy7J-d9d1fT7AqMrVcps8Q,Dave R.,1.0 star rating,"Ah NYC brunch how I have missed you.  Until today.  My work schedule hasn't allowed for weekend brunches for a few years until now but unfortunately The Standard Grill fell very short today.  To be completely honest I am not a tough sell when it comes to a brunch menu but it should've been more expertly prepared especially considering the prices.  We started with steak tartare for an appetizer with charred scallion, jalapeño, pine nuts, quail egg ($17).  The steak almost seemed like deviled ham more than prime tar tar beef.  And the quail egg was so well cooked that the yolk was cooked through and we couldn't mix it through the tartare.That was followed by huevos rancheros with chorizo, black beans, crema, salsa guajillo ($17).  I suppose some would say that you have no business ordering this in a more upscale locale but I figured you can't screw that up.  Well...it was full of chips which is odd to begin with and conversely had very little chorizo.  The salsa guajillo was more like gravy than salsa.My wife had the grilled tuna with fennel, olives, soft herbs, shishito vinaigrette ($24).  The tuna was ok.  Not bad but a little gray.  It was probably about 4 ounces and the rest of the plate was primarily a pile of frisee.  We finished our meal under the advice of our friend that accompanied us with the brioche donuts with vanilla-rum custard ($8).  Let's just put it this way.  My wife cut her donut into about 12 small pieces and found one pencil eraser sized spot of custard.  REALLY?  Fade to black.  End of scene.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"
2,Q8NKc3gnRRnRPqPOHC2Vug,Barry B.,5.0 star rating,"Food:  Even though I am a long-time resident of NYC, this was my first-time dining at the Standard.  I have heard both good and bad about the establishment, was in the area with some free time one afternoon this past weekend, so I decided to put things to rest in my own mind and try it for myself. I started with a shrimp cocktail (a make or break dish for any restaurant) and a turkey sandwich on 7 grain wheat.  The shrimp cocktail appetizer was delicious! Quite often, establishments will over chill the shrimp and cause me to feel like I am eating an orange ice cube - not here.  The chilled shrimp was just that: chilled, not over chilled and the display and preparation were top notch.  How can one talk about a sandwich more than to say that it was filling, appetizing and not sloppy?  But here the flavor of an avocado, cucumber, and sweet aioli combined to make my mouth fall in love - something I hadn't expected or experienced in a very long time with such a simple dish that was elegant in every way.Service:  This is where it gets interesting. I dine out often. I do not sit down to write detailed reviews as often.  Nonetheless, when something is so striking as to cause me to take good hard notice (either in a good way or a bad way), I will sit down and write a review.  The sandwich, the shrimp were wonderful - but the service was outstanding in every way.  From the time that I was greeted by the hostess until I paid my check, I felt as if I were the only customer that occupied the establishment.  This says quite a bit in this city that is dominated by so many decent restaurants that strive to be great!!   My waitress Stephanie was fabulous, and I hope the managers and owners of the Standard see this review and pass to her a job well done and noticed!  She was NOT merely an order taker: she was there to ensure, in a way that was not overbearing or awkward, that my experience was exceptional in every way possible.  She seemed concerned that my experience was nothing less than exceptional.  She is a star and no doubt the Standard is aware of the value that she brings to it because of the clear commitment to its customers and their (OUR) experience. When I return, and I will be certain to do so, I will make sure that Stephanie will be my server again.  She was so welcoming and made me feel as if I was the only customer in this busy restaurant. Overall: HIGHLY SATISFYING experience and my only regret is that the Standard is not closer to my daily haunts.  Food is worth the trip and I only really had a sandwich, but the service makes this restaurant that has been on my radar for quite some time a destination establishment!",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

I think the food was decent maybe 3.5 stars but what bumped it up to 4 stars was the fact this is one of the few nice places that didn't use easter as an excuse to ditch their normal menu prices & offer only a really overpriced expensive prix fixe easter brunch menu.  It's well known that restaurants in nyc and I suppose everywhere do this for valentines day/xmas/thanksgiving but when I was investigating easter brunch options---many many nyc restaurants had like $65-125 special easter menus So bonus points for regular brunch menu--and it was actually tasty!  We were a party of 4--we got eggs Benedict which came with their tasty potatoes, egg frittata, brisket & egg sandwich and the lamb baked eggs plus a side of vanilla rum donuts & cheesy grits.  The drinks we got were bloody mary & berry freah juice--which was delicious & thick more like a smoothie.  The standout dishes were the lamb baked eggs & donuts.  As a side note--this is a fairly kid friendly restaurant--many high chairs available.  I didn't see a change table though in the bathroom The easter petting zoo was very nice for being free--some mini goats, pot bellied pigs, angora rabbits, lambs to pet with some adorable easter cutouts for photo op--at zoo the standard was selling snacks--$4 popcorn, cookies & cotton candy & offering face painting.  Overall a very nice weekend outing especially if you walk the highline afterwards.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

I really liked the flavors but didn't find it that strong. If you're sharing it among 4-5 people I don't think it'll really do much but for three girls just splitting some appetizers / sides it definitely had us feeling good. On to the food...we shared the Boston Bibb salad, steak tartare, Spanish octopus, fries and Brussel sprouts. Everything was exceptional! I especially enjoyed the steak tartare and salad. My friends were super into the Brussel sprout side. Being it was a few days before my birthday my friends surprised me with the ""birthday cake slice"" aka a slice of strawberry shortcake. AMAZING.

A couple of unisex bathrooms along the corridor labeled water closets (WC).Server Michael was awesome - look for the guy in dredds with a very cool Joker tie-pin.Big family-style dinner.Appetizers:- oysters (3 kinds), with a spicy vinegar which was good- cured meats/cheese - not bad, though wish the tray turned since the table was small- steak tartare - charred scallion, jalapeno, pine nuts, quail egg, and overall not bad (a touch salty)- boston bibb lettuce - more lettuce (a little bitter) with great candied walnuts + dressing- hamachi crudo which was good, but tiny slicesMains:- roasted chicken which had bones, and was otherwise ok (not too dry, the thigh piece I had) and people liked the bread + sauce (a bit too oily/salty for me)- hand rolled garganelli - short rib ragu with calabraise pepper, pecorino romano, and was good, but bland compared with other dishes- bone-in swordfish chop was ok, sauce a touch spicy- standard burger - big servings, half a burger per person; bacon slab was thick but hard, and undercooked; pickles were half-dill, so not too bad at allSides:- brussel sprouts - lots of people liked this, but too sweet for me (honey + grape + aleppo + promegranate yogurt)- roasted mushrooms in garlic butter - perfect- french fries, string cutDessert- wake and bake, a warm chocolate chip cookie with chilled valley cream-top milk- sour cream cheesecake - I'm not a cheesecake person, but was reasonably fluffy- celebration cake slice, pink strawberry and was ok, but too heavy for me to eat much after the rest of the mealDrinks:- penny cup- their version of a Moscow mule, which was goodService - top notch. The food, mixed good and bad, but overall had dishes I'd come back to try again.

I think the food was decent maybe 3.5 stars but what bumped it up to 4 stars was the fact this is one of the few nice places that didn't use easter as an excuse to ditch their normal menu prices & offer only a really overpriced expensive prix fixe easter brunch menu.  It's well known that restaurants in nyc and I suppose everywhere do this for valentines day/xmas/thanksgiving but when I was investigating easter brunch options---many many nyc restaurants had like $65-125 special easter menus So bonus points for regular brunch menu--and it was actually tasty!  We were a party of 4--we got eggs Benedict which came with their tasty potatoes, egg frittata, brisket & egg sandwich and the lamb baked eggs plus a side of vanilla rum donuts & cheesy grits.  The drinks we got were bloody mary & berry freah juice--which was delicious & thick more like a smoothie.  The standout dishes were the lamb baked eggs & donuts.  As a side note--this is a fairly kid friendly restaurant--many high chairs available.  I didn't see a change table though in the bathroom The easter petting zoo was very nice for being free--some mini goats, pot bellied pigs, angora rabbits, lambs to pet with some adorable easter cutouts for photo op--at zoo the standard was selling snacks--$4 popcorn, cookies & cotton candy & offering face painting.  Overall a very nice weekend outing especially if you walk the highline afterwards.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

I really liked the flavors but didn't find it that strong. If you're sharing it among 4-5 people I don't think it'll really do much but for three girls just splitting some appetizers / sides it definitely had us feeling good. On to the food...we shared the Boston Bibb salad, steak tartare, Spanish octopus, fries and Brussel sprouts. Everything was exceptional! I especially enjoyed the steak tartare and salad. My friends were super into the Brussel sprout side. Being it was a few days before my birthday my friends surprised me with the ""birthday cake slice"" aka a slice of strawberry shortcake. AMAZING.

So many folks say, ""Yeah, yeah, roasted brussels sprouts, shove a little bacon in there, oo, look at me, I'm a gourmet!"" (Honestly, I'm not sure anyone really says that, but someone must have at some point. Don't question me.)What they do here is roast the sprouts with grapes -- dude, GRAPES -- and serve them over a  pomegranate yogurt... WHAT??? Exquisite. I offered to share them with my friend before I tasted them, and immediately regretted my offer.  Fortunately, my friend was easily distracted, and after a few ""Wait, is that [insert celebrity name]?!"" she was on to me and just left me to it.My friend had what probably WASN'T called ""Big Fat Turkey Sammidge"" on the menu, but should have been. She said it was excellent -- it came with greens, which she shared with me, and they were really fresh and, to quote Lucy, ""so tasty, too!""The folks who work there are all super nice, and cooler than I ever was -- or thought I was -- when I was in my 20s. As we New Yorkers know, with cool can come attitude -- here, the only attitudes we got were ""nice"" and ""helpful.""

Let me start off by saying my experience here was not pleasant nor memorable. The food was expensive and not impressive. We did get quite lucky with our walk-in bc we didn't have to wait and got seated right away. My friends really enjoyed the outdoor seating and view but I thought differently, it was loud and dirty... We skipped the appetizers (salad, pea soup, beets, kale, liver mousse and octopus) bc it didn't sound appealing to us. My one friend is allergic to seafood so we couldn't get anything from the raw bar. They both ordered the standard burger (well done and medium well) and I had the Maine lobster roll. All were served with fries. Waited about 15 minutes to order, then 30 minutes passed and we were still waiting on our food. The waiter approached us and apologized about how the kitchen overcooked the burgers and had to remake them. Seriously? We waited probably another 30 minutes before our food finally came out. The server who was holding our 3 entrees all at once...gave me my dish first, then while putting down my friend's dish, the fries accidentally tipped over and poured all over my friend's lap+between us including the pickles for the burger. He apologized, left and our waiter bought over another fries and pickles for my friend. My Maine lobster roll was a very small portion that tasted ok, not great. The bread was soft and had a good amount of lobster meat in it but I didn't really like it. I'm glad my friends enjoyed their burger and fries bc I wasn't impressed with my meal. Not to mention, our waiter was always nowhere to be found, he never checked back with us after the food arrived and no one refilled our water either. The service was just terrible like many other Yelpers had stated as well. If I had other options in the beginning, I wouldn't have came here.

That being said, this place is a bit pricey and I wouldn't necessarily say it was worth that extra dollar sign. Yes, everything was good, however, some of the prices just seem to be high for the sake of being high.I specifically wanted to write about their special menus/holiday events, which based on the experience and service, I would not do again. I came here for Thanksgiving of 2016. I was going to be spending the holiday by myself in the city so decided to splurge on a nice dinner solo. I made a reservation for their dinner service with a pre-fixe menu. My reservation was for 5 pm and I arrive a little before, probably around 5:50. When I walked in, I was not greeted and there were a bunch of kids screaming and running around. I eventually made my way past their families to the front desk and checked in with the hostess. I was pretty much told they were running behind but it would only be a few minutes and to try the bar. After 15 minutes, I checked back in and they didn't even seem to know my face. They gave me the same BS answer of "" a few more minutes"". I could tell they had no idea what they were talking about because I have worked in numerous resatuarants but i went back to the bar anyway. I ended up only getting seated until 5:30, a half hour after I was supposed to. I probably would have been kind of okay with this as it was a holiday and I figured they were running behind, however then my waiter pretty much sucked. He didn't introduce himself, didn't bring me bread or water until I placed my order and didn't do any of that until 5:45/5:50. He actually came by and I was just sitting there with nothign and he said ""do you need anything?"" I just blankly stared at him and said ""Yeah, everything. I haven't been given a menu, put in my order or even been given water.""

Very delicious and gives quite the buzz!- Eggs Benedict - really good!! Comes with a delicious hollandaise and a type of horseradish sauce, and the potatoes (OMG)!- Brisket & Fried Egg Sandwich - delicious! The brisket had a great flavor and was very tender.

Yours truly had the bellini (as I always will if it is brunch and on a menu-yum!) and thoroughly enjoyed it. The juices were fresh and wine options were plenty. After enjoying some beverages to jump start our brunch we moved on to the food.  I absolutely love and respect any place that has organic items on their menu--I believe this is a huge deal today, not only for health but also for environment. I had the avocado toast that is topped with poached eggs and has an herb salad on the side. I am just going to say this is one of my favorite avocado toast dishes I have had. Everyone else enjoyed their dishes as well (I almost stole the almond crusted french toast from my boyfriends dish... that cherry compote is the best addition to a french toast dish ever. Great flavor!) There are so many menu items I still need to try so I will definitely be returning.We really all enjoyed ourselves and have nothing negative to say about our experience.

They have a block worth of businesses from the Grill to the Beer Garden to an icing rink in the winter to the hotel! The burger is their staple item and it's one thing they are known for. You'll get a Standard burger for  $18 with fries, a ""good pickle"" and it comes with really great bacon! It's big enough to share if you're not super hungry. Drinks are also very good and range from imported beer to their own signature drinks. Prices are $8 and up to $65 for the huge bowl drink for 4 people.The staff have always been great at the Grill. Outside the Grill not so much. The waiters are friendly, accommodating, and provide great customer service. Especially a new waiter from CA that we had! Also the host and manager easily accommodated my party of 8 when the staff outside said they wouldn't. If you go outside to the host by the garden seating area, they make you wait even with open seats and no wait...it's NY.If you're looking for simple, chill, great food, awesome service, the Standard Grill is your place!

There are TONS of people working here and milling around, but very few ever actually came up to our table. We were waiting on the fourth persons meal to arrive at our table, and when finally someone came up to us they asked us if everything was ok?

Absolutely gorgeous interior and exterior with a nice little garden seating area. Great vibes!The cocktail menu looked like a great way to get the party started, so we got a round of ""Strawberry Fields"": rye, strawberry-thyme cordial, lemon prosecco. Fruity, refreshing and the perfect aperitif. It was an oddly warm, beautiful November morning so we then decided to split a bottle of Liquid Farm rosé. Here's where things went awry.. He brought us champagne flutes.... for a still rosé. I politely asked for normal wine glasses, given the wine we ordered wasn't bubbly. He then came back with potentially the worst, most stubby looking wine glasses I wouldn't even expect a place like that to have. Every other table inside had nice Riedels. I politely asked for some, and was given a scoff, an eye roll, and some attitude. Sorry bud, but if I'm spending $75 on a bottle of Rosé, I deserve to drink it in a proper vessel, and whatever glass I fucking want -- thats service. Eventually we got the glassware we expected and everything was fine. (P.S. Liquid Farm rosé - or anything Liquid Farm for that matter - rules. Order it, you won't regret it)The rest of our meal was great - I opted for the simple, but delicious, avocado toast with poached eggs and an herbed salad. My friends got equally delicious dishes including the berry blast fresh made fruit juice and the classic breakfast sandwich. All in all, we left happy and full, but I was really turned off by the waiter's attitude. I work in service also, and if you're that frustrated with someone you run into the bathroom and scream or you vent to someone - you don't roll your eyes and sigh when someone asks for something reasonable.

They offer bread which is quite good with olives which are great too. Ordered the Standard Burger, which is the juiciest burger that my friends ever had. I admit also to the quality of the burger and the fries that come with it. I would rate them higher but they seemed to have some confusion. Actually I would give them another half star for the Burger and Yelena alone.  I probably would return just for the Burger. The check took forever to come which kind of added to my confusion theory.

The first night that we stayed over we figured we'd do a nice dinner at The Standard Grill so we can lounge around the hotel. We called down to make reservations and they were more than happy to accommodate us on pretty short notice. We entered the restaurant -- I absolutely loved the vibe and dress code the waiters have. It was very European and appealing. We were quickly seated and a lovely and friendly waiter was more than happy to recommend the best dishes to order. I know I'm jumping straight to dessert but my absolute favourite dish was the chocolate hazelnut mousse. That pie took me straight to heaven. I saw paradise and I didn't want it to end. Alright, alright, back to the real food. The salmon was phenomenal, grilled to perfection with an amazing sauce. I've definitely had better crostinis but it wasn't bad. All other dishes were OK. The next morning we decided to come back for breakfast. As it was morning, we had a different waiter, who wasn't so attentive and it was difficult to enjoy what should have been a really pleasant morning. We ordered coffees, french toast, bagels etc. I ordered my coffee with sugar --- in that case I'd need a spoon to mix the coffee. It was not provided when he initially brought the coffee to the table. So I waited, and waited, and waited. Literally 10 minutes and he failed to come back to my table, so I got up and walked to the kitchen and asked them for a spoon. They were of course happy to help. The manager, standing nearby, overheard my request and was absolutely mortified. Moments later he came to my table and offered unlimited coffee on the house for my inconvenience. But the setback had already set the mood for breakfast although I definitely tried to enjoy as best as I could. The breakfast dishes were pretty ordinary and decent.I love The Standard and will be back with out a doubt.

It was served with a sprinkling of crispy onions and a sunny side up duck egg. We also ordered rigatoni with lamb ragu, it was very good, not too rich with a hint of middle eastern flavors, kale salad with walnuts, apple, Parmesan was adequate, but the Brussels sprouts were really a hit.

It took another 15 minutes for our server to show up and another 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive. We were left there on Valentines Day just looking around and watching how not to conduct hospitality business. Basically, there was no supervision and service. We spent rest of our time watching our server lean over and talk to these girls at the next table for 10 minutes while our drinks were dying at the bar for him to pick up and serve. We wanted to order more food and drinks but no one was around to take an order or assist or ask or anything.  What I don't understand as an industry professional is that how do you get away with such abysmal standards of conduct?

Anyhow, I adjusted that immediately by opting to sit outdoors instead of inside. We had a pleasant server(again I don't recall the name ). He was very helpful and even persuasive enough to get me to try raw beef. Yes, I still can't believe it myself !   In any case we had the steak tartare to start. It and a very good taste to it and I wasn't crazy about it, but I didn't complain. I ate it and enjoyed it. My Lady however couldn't look at it, let alone stomach it after a bite or two haha. She ordered a burger and I went with the rigatoni for our entrees. Both dishes were delicious as I expected nothing less. We also had a glass of wine to pair with our delectable meals. The vino certainly did not disappoint. I had a glass of white(Txkaoli de Alava) and she had red.   The service could've been better in terms of efficiency this go round, however I'll give the benefit of knowing it was a primetime hours.

Beautiful restaurant, great seating, and very nice staff. Everyone was really nice, I wish I remembered the first person who greeted me but they were very kind and accommodating! The food was delicious and the experience was one to remember. Many restaurants forget that eating with the people you love is a daily treasure, and I am happy to say the Standard Grill knows that family time in a house or a restaurant is just as important!! I was sat down and my husband and I met Stephanie. She was very genuine, kind, super helpful, smart, and most importantly she cared about our experience as guests. She is very attentive to details and has great people skills. I saw her help some of the staff even though she had tables herself. Sometimes I feel like the waiter and waitresses are very annoyed with me as I personally am very difficult and picky to eat. I was so memorized how Stephanie knew the menu inside and out. She made me feel at ease about my pickiness and was happy to come back to the table multiple times to check on us. A lot of waiters and waitresses always believe I am difficult and so they are scared to come back to the table and ask me if there is anything else they could do for me- but not Stephanie! She is a go-getter and any restaurant would be lucky to have someone who cares about a customers experience and visit to a restaurant. When I come back to NYC, I would love to visit again and request Stephanie as my waitress. The standard grill is lucky I do not have a restaurant of my own, because I would come back and try to poach her for myself!! And before I forget... I ate the standard burger and the fries were AMAZING. I also had a penny drop cocktail. :) Very good!",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

In fact, we once had to send back our eggs benedict because the eggs were almost hard boiled (our server was nice about it though and didn't try to justify the bad preparation in any way). When the dishes came out the second time, the eggs were perfectly poached. The fries were crisp and sufficiently salty, and the drinks were fine too.

The place is HUGE with two sections of outdoor seating and multiple rooms inside. We sat outside. The atmosphere and decor is beautiful, trendy, and very NYC-esque.The food and drinks were excellent. We started with a platter of cured meats and cheeses. I got the ""Sunday Girl"" with tequila. The cocktail was nothing crazy, but nevertheless fruity and refreshing for a warm summer night.For dinner, I had the pork chops - juiciest chop I've ever tasted. It's soo easy to mess up pork chops. They've nailed it at the Standard Grill. My aunt and cousin got the lamb chops and the rigatoni. Those dishes were fantastic as well. Even so, prices are unreasonably high.This spot easily would have received 4 stars from me if it wasn't for our server. He was snobby, awkward, and uncomfortable. Furthermore, he was not knowledgeable about ANYTHING on the menu. Or maybe he was, but was just too impatient and arrogant to help me. I'm allergic to seafood and most of the menu is seafood so I asked him if he had any recommendations. He was very short with me, spoke too quickly, and was not friendly or helpful AT ALL. Obviously, I need to make sure there was no trace of seafood in anything that I was ordering... I believe his name is Todd. Furthermore, he was not attentive whatsoever. He made me feel like he was just too busy to deal with us. UghEven though Todd wasn't the best, I'm a huge fan of the food, outdoor seating, and atmosphere in general.

This is how last Saturday night started and it ended with a pretty damn good meal at The Standard Grill. This is a beautiful venue with comfortable seating, a curved subway tile ceiling and a floor that's made up of close to 350,000 pennies. It's a busy place with lots of staff running around, taking orders and shuttling food & drink. Food was quite good, not excellent, mind you but I had no complaints. What really stood out here besides the beautiful decor was the awesome, friendly service. Waitstaff wear plaid pants with matching vests and, if they're not spectacularly happy with their jobs, they could have fooled me. They were super helpful and quite funny, acting more like casual friends than waiters. Mind you, this was the ENTIRE staff from host to servers to bus staff. All exceptional. Of course, many waiters are also actors so it could have all been a facade but, I have to tell you, the end result was awesome. I felt totally comfortable and at home. The suggestions they made for appetizers, entrees and drinks couldn't have been better or more well received. Honestly, whomever does the hiring is quite good at what they do.

144,HZX9_eLbhTGWa0swvSiOSQ,Michelle L.,3.0 star rating,"It is such a lovely atmosphere, and everyone is beautiful. But they need to work on serving oysters and basic restaurant protocols when something goes wrong. Three of us started with oysters and cocktails, and ended up sharing a bunch of plates, including the amazing chilled pea soup, well-reputed fries and beet salad. We had a fish special, can't recall what it was but it was good. All prepared well, and brought out chilled or warm as they should have been. Our food and cocktails were delicious. But we never had silverware when our food came, and finally stole a place-setting from a nearby table and one are with a fork the other with a spoon. Service was abysmal.They also need to either train their staff or stop serving oysters. First we receive only 11 oysters in a mixed dozen. After we pointed it out and waited for the waiter's response, we had to ASK to have our twelfth delivered. The person serving had no idea which were which and named them completely incorrectly. We're oyster eaters, so we gently indicated that the east and west oysters were not correct (it's pretty obvious). Third person came to try to correctly name our oysters. Then I got the surprise of my life when there was a blood red multi-legged thing in my oyster!! (see photo - imagine blood redder and way more moving legs) Thank goodness my friend is prim and proper and insists we use forks (which we had to request) and I check if they are fully detached or I would have had this live creature in my mouth! Our waiter took it away. AGAIN we had to ask for a replacement oyster. Come bill time, you'd think they'd comp those oysters, and maybe a round of cocktails. Apologize, even just a little. NOPE. Our waiter wasn't on it, and we really struggled with how much to tip. We ended our evening in the gorgeous art deco gold bar upstairs. Truly a treat for the eyes, from the decor to the incredible view. Unfortunately the pounding and very loud club music made it near impossible to talk. No one was successfully navigating some pre-bedroom talk there. There's no dance floor, and the music just doesn't fit the lounge atmosphere. Bar fail.

Me and my mom got the huge HL fling, we were only half way through and already drunk. But it's a fantastic one to share! The only thing that I don't like there are the hosts. I made a reservation and came early. They sit me inside saying that I had to wait till 5:30 to be outside (when there're plenty of ppl outside already). The hosts said all different thing about the seating and I had to wait line for line to finally be outside ( they are very irresponsible of what they say and not helpful at all!)

Humph.The porterhouse for two for $70 was seriously surrounded by the thickest layer of fat I ever have seen and was throughout the meat as well. I know it is a fatty piece of meat, but I felt badly for my date, as after all the fat was cut away, there was barely enough meat for 1.  For two, the serving size was not large enough considering all the fat you had to cut away especially for the price.We then finished off with this double mouse dessert that was huge gorgeous and delicious, but I would have rather a great meal than a great dessert.

We were seated promptly in one of the cute circular booths.I started with a 'Roman Holiday' which was like an alcoholic version of Fanta while my dinner companions each got their own cocktails. For an app, we asked to share a serving of fries. They were crisp and good but nothing to write home about.For my main, I had the lamb t-bones. They were marinated well and served over cannellini beans, which I loved. One friend got the strip steak with chimichurri. It was delicious, though I like my chimichurri a little more cilantro-packed. Another friend ordered the scallops. They were cooked perfectly, though the serving size was a little small, I thought. My third friend ordered the pork chop with cheesy grits. The pork chop was perfectly tender and not at all dry and the grits were the perfect accompaniment.For dessert, we got the banoffee pie and the milk and cookies. All of us are lactose intolerant so we skipped the milk, but the cookies were delicious and gooey. The banoffee pie was delicious; I particularly enjoyed the crust and the toffee drizzle.Our waitress was nice enough, but not as friendly as I'd expect a server to be (especially since you'd think she'd want bigger tips). Service was quick though, and everyone else was super accommodating.The one bad experience, which was not the restaurant's fault, was that during our meal, the chubby gentleman sitting at a table nearby (with his back to us) let out a horrendous fart. Seriously, we were all freaking out because it was so horrible. I'm only sharing this as a public service announcement to all diners out there. Please, do not do this while other people are eating.

Great food; I had the fruit cup, which could have been more generous. The eggs Benedict, turkey sandwich, and croissant were delicious. Best croissant this side of the Atlantic. The cocktails were varied and strong. The service could have been more attentive, though our personal waiter was very pleasant. The seats are terrible, get a booth or come back another time. The setting for brunch was very loud, we found ourselves shouting over the other patrons, which can be a drawback to a relaxing brunch. But it is extremely popular and packed. Hint--the bathrooms are divided by an iron curtain and no signs were visible to me indicating a men's or women's side-until someone pointed out the floor medallions with a woman's head to the left and a man's head on the right.

The Standard Grill came up with average reviews so we walked there and saw the beautiful surroundings with the outside garden, large inside dining room, and adorable bar area. It was busy so we were sat at a two top in the bar across from the raw bar. We had a lovely waitress named Stephanie who could not have been more patient, efficient, pleasant, and accommodating, We were very surprised when we found out at the end of our dining experience that she was a new waitress. You could have fooled us :) We started with a beautiful platter of an assorted dozen or east and west oysters, and a half dozen of little neck clams. It was all delicious and extremely fresh. It came with a delicious red wine/shallot vinaigrette. For our main course, my husband ordered a vegetarian roasted eggplant dish that came with roasted carrots in a small cast iron skillet. I ordered the Bangkok steak salad which was perfectly prepared, beautiful, and tasty. We were watching Daniel, the head bartender, as he meticulously made his drinks so we asked Stephanie to ask him which were his specialty drinks and he responded by his old fashioned so my husband ordered that and I ordered a virgin bloody mary which was homemade and delicious.

201,XvsCMw07_AVXXhoX-ndyhw,Chip R.,3.0 star rating,"Bottom line: I want to really like The Standard Grill but from this brunch experience I can give them an A-OK 3 stars for now. I think there are great things here and things that have so much potential. Our service was so-so, not superlative unfortunately. I hope to come back in the future and hit on a better combination than this past time.The Deets:Always looking around for a decent brunch in different places, we came upon The Standard Grill after trying to see about getting some brunch grub around the Chelsea Market/High Line area of Chelsea. We decided to give them a go and see what they are about.First of all, I like the look of Standard. There are many facets, in that they have a nice outside patio then coming into a very light bright diner area that catches the eye once inside the door. Going back even further (where we were led for our table) there is a more dark toned large dining area. I would have enjoyed the diner front area I think but all of them are nice, clean, and open. We ordered our brunch cocktails in a mimosa and bellini, and I have to say their mimosa is not the usual kind in that they use champagne, orange liqueur, orange juice, and a splash of blood orange. I think I like the original much more (simple is better), although this one is adequate. Before getting a main entree, we decided on getting some of the brioche doughnuts with the vanilla rum custard filling. These were very good, but I think they would be perfect if they were not coated all over with crystalized sugar...it's a bit too much sweet and sugar. The custard filling was awesome, I liked that a lot. For my main plate I ordered the whole wheat pancakes with blueberry compote and yogurt on top, syrup on the side. The pancakes were not that flavorful actually, even with the additions, maybe due to the whole wheat base. I also asked for 3 scrambled eggs on the side...well...apparently they only came as two eggs on a plate but I was not told that by my server. I got a plate of eggs which I enjoyed, and then someone (not our server) brought another so I responded ""no, I've already got my eggs, thanks"" but they brought them back saying I had gotten both. I'd say that was some miscommunication I wish I had known so I would have adjusted my order accordingly. Our server, while on the subject, was not overly attentive or informative...our service was somewhat adequate but not over the top actually. At one point we had to tell someone else that we wanted more coffee as we could not find her to tell her and she did not note it to refill us earlier.  In all, we got our brunch and it did the job but there were a few hiccups along the way.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"
202,r0DyqUGQf9ptwFv-TbwRsA,June K.,4.0 star rating,"I really like this place, sitting underneath the High Line. You can have a variety of experiences here from the loud crowded beer garden replete with ping pong tables on one side, the quieter canopied alfresco dining on the other, the happening bar area with its ice seafood and pretty bartenders, the fancier restaurant inside, the little pizza bar in the back. Fun, beautifully designed, decent food. A bit pricey. Lovely wait staff. The giant salt chocolate mousse dessert ($15) is so decadent and to die for and can be shared by 5 people. Great cocktails, some by the pitcher. The hamburger and oysters are my other favorites. Even a nice place for delicious afternoon teapots. I bring lots of friends visiting from out of town/out of the country and it doesn't disappoint. I always walk out of there with a smile.

From what I've heard the fishbowl drinks are amazing, but I can't speak from experience. It was so entertaining and fun. The staff were so friendly and really just wanted you to have a good time. Someone dancing accidentally spilled my drink, so my waitor gave me another one free of charge! I highly recommend the mac and cheese. The chicken and waffles were amazing, just on the smaller side.

Didn't have dinner but did experience their bingo night **Now with that out the way, to most the idea of a bingo night might sound uneventful, some might even categorize it as antique.  Let me just say you have it all wrong.     The Standard Grill took the idea of bingo  and reinvented  it.  I suggest getting there  on time or even early, we went a day after Blizzard Jonas and it got packed really quick.   To start you need reservations, and you have to order  the High Line Fling, a extra large alcoholic bowl. Definitely  enough to share amongst friends.  There was only two of us and we're able to finish  it, though we paid the price the next morning lol.    We ate dinner earlier in the night but opted to order some appetizers, the truffle mac and cheese and the potato pom poms.  Definitely  great choices both were tasty and well prepared.    With a live dj and a charismatic host dishing out punch lines, I'd  say might be hard to find a better way to spend a sunday night.   They give you two bingo sheets and the night begins.   In btwn  calling out bingo numbers they have music /dance breaks, trivia and ""balls"" karoke.    Win some free shots by answering the random trivia and win your whole table free shots  by winning the creative and funny ""balls"" karaoke.   Overall  this was  a great way to spend a sunday  night  and suggested  it to anyone looking  for something fun and unusual  to do in the city.    Definitely  plan on coming back.P.S.  They have a photo booth  down stairs.  What else can you possibly need!!!",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

Otherwise there are much better burger joints out there for a much better price.The saving grace though was the fries --- No kidding! Thank God for the side of fries. It feels like that's where I got my money's worth. I don't know how they did it but it's like they perfected a magical recipe to making delicious, tasty, addicting, perfectly cooked fries!The three of us split the chocolate mouse for dessert. That was also very good. Otherwise, it's a pretty upscale place in terms of price for ""standard"" food. The restaurant itself was too crowded and noisy/loud for me -- seemed hectic.

Our dinner at the Standard Grill met their high standards as he is a gourmet cook. We each ordered a different appetizer, main and dessert. Appetizers were grilled octopus, raw clams, thick asparagus. Mains were fresh trout, braised short ribs, hamburger. Desserts were flan, meringue with rhubarb, a dessert wine. Plus a rose type wine. Each dish had the highest quality ingredients - meat, fish, fruit, vegetables. I ordered trout as I have such fond childhood memories of fishing and having fresh trout on family vacations. This was not the typical very thin white Sierras trout but a wonderfully thick pink trout that exceeded my expectations. Now I have to research which trout this was and find how to buy it. Note: there are two different type dining rooms at the Standard Grill; one bright, sunny, lots of windows with an outdoor patio; the other dark, leather with booths and tables.

One hour and half later the (4) Creekstone Ny strip steak we ordered came out. They were the size of your palm and tough as leather. They offer 4 horrible sauces to try to soften that leather for an additional fee. The asparagus side was literally one piece of asparagus cut up in 4 pieces with some non descript wilted leaves that you could not even cut with a steak knife. The hard McDonald like fries were cold and the crispy potato side was quarter potatoes fried then baked to a crisp, inedible. Clearly our plates were full when the waitress came to clear the table, she didn't even ask why. It was my birthday so we said how could they go wrong with dessert and ordered the mousse and cookies with milk.

(now talking about reception ladies, not about the cute hardworking waiters and cleaners).The first impression is everything: the woman at the entrance didn't greet me in any words at all, didn't smile at me or look me in the eyes. She just stared at me. Up and down. Well I was a young woman coming in for dinner alone, that's maybe unusual, but please have discretion and hospitability. I was properly dressed (nothing to stare at!) and greeted her politely. I said I would've liked to sit outside but it seemed it was about to rain, and her answer was: ""So what do you want?"" I said well I would like to have dinner, table for one....  Then when she gave me no reaction or answer or eyecontact or notice at all, I finally asked if I can just go and sit anywhere. She rolled her eyes and said ""I'll take you to a table, wait!"". She took me to a table, slammed the menu at me while not even looking towards me. Totally unprofessional!I was first seated outside, then inside and then outside again. Waiters sending me away from the terrace because it was closing and then managers sending me back. The staff and managers need better communication between terrace and indoors, and not make guests feel responsbile or embarrased about their mistakes.Also I'd like to see waiters know the wines better. The waitress didn't even know which wines are local (USA). She did not know what is Sauterne, even after I pointed it out in the menu.

We shared several things to start: oysters, octopus, steak tartare, and chicken liver royale. Everything was awesome but the octopus was my favorite. It was tender, seasoned with chili and came on a bed of sweet potatoes. For my entree I had the loup de mer and it was perfect. Tender, mild and with a wonderful sauce. I also snagged a bite of the swordfish, the fettuccini, and the scallops. Everything was good but the scallops were my least favorite. Dessert is why this place really got 5 stars! Wowzer. Make sure that you save room for dessert. We pretty much had one of everything. My favorites were the warm cookies with the milk because they were gooey and made me feel like a kid again.

The decor and atmosphere are very nice and the staff is decently attentive, but at the price point of The Standard Grill, I expect more. I do not recommend it for groups. To summarize the food was over cooked and nothing special for the price paid. We tried the following:Appetizers:- assorted cheese and charcuterie - decent selection and nice accompaniments including the honey comb- little gem salad - also decent, but nothing specialMains:- while roasted chicken - very moist and nicely seasoned. I would have this again, it tasted like my moms cooking.- New York strip - this is just ok. The chimichurri sauce is good, but the cut of beef was subpar. - Scallops - these were over cooked as was the cauliflower pairing, scallops were gummy Sides:- crispy potatoes - very nice, would eat these again- farm greens - too much sauce, but otherwise alright- Brussels sprouts - nice but I could do without the bacon vinaigrette Dessert- bread pudding - I could not taste the bacon in the icecream and that is probably a good thing- Pumpkin cheesecake - I could do without this, another 'pumpkin' gimick- Cookies and milk - some of the cookies were burnt on the edges. Also they gave 1 glass of milk with a straw for every 3 cookies... how do you share the milk?!Overall, the food is decent but not worth the price. Our dinner was served family style, which would be fine except there were no serving spoons. This was not conducive to sharing. I think this place is fine for an intimate dinner.

Like you have an open kitchen, do you have any standards!? Your called the standard for gods sake!!!!!This place was talked up to me like it was going to be incredible. I love food and really appreciate great service and awesome well thought out dishes. Being in the service industry might make me a bit tough, but my complains I have seem fair. It was pretty badThe hosts were lovely and sat us right away at a nice table by the kitchen. We waited, and waited, and waited and no server came over to us. We saw plenty chit chatting away with each other thru out the dining room. We see people who say after us get greeted and already have drinks. Now I am a waitress so I understand if a server can't get to a table right away, but we weren't even acknowledged. Finally I ask someone walking by if we could please get a server. Another few minutes go by then finally she comes over. Jessica was her name. Took a while to get out drinks but we all ordered cocktails so I was ok with that. We got 3 courses; cheese plate and oysters which came out quick and was ok. Cheese wasn't anything to write home about. 2nd course we got the octopus, pork belly, and steak tartar. Octopus was dry and over charred, tartar was good, but had an odd wassabi taste to it, and the pork belly was very good. Meanwhile, our server was barely available and it didn't seem that she has any tables other than ours. As for entrees, again disappointing. Jessica (our server) said the burgers were famous there, so I got the burger special that evening. A short rib and hanger steak burger. Patty tasted like any old meat patty, unseasoned, nothing special.The bun was super stale and soggy with the 2 sauces they put on; black garlic aioli and siracha ketchup.   There was a chunk of sautéed pickled onions that weren't even pulled apart, and the pancetta just got lost. And to top it all off, it was $28!!! We wanted dessert but our server stood over in the service station chatting for 15 minutes in which time we yelped somewhere else for dessert. AWFUL. Will never go back. Oh and a side note, when we finally got her to give us the check, she watched us like a hawk until we paid, literally stood next to the table which was the closest and most available she has been the entire time. We paid mostly in cash and some on a card. Cash tip, we told her that and thanked her, and she gave us all the cash back, like we didn't leave her a big enough tip, even though we tipped more than the 20% she really didn't deserve.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

We grabbed dinner here before we hit up Ceilo for an evening of dancing around the corner. The weather was amazing for my weekend trip to NYC and when I say gorgeous Friday evening, I mean light jacket and sitting outside type of evening. As soon as we turned the corner, the outside hanging lights were immediately attractive. We approached and were seated right behind the hostess stand in a walk way. As soon as we sat down and I picked up the menu, I knew if I was going to enjoy this meal that I needed a new table. We requested another table outside and only ended up waiting about 20 minutes. Our server was very understanding, as it was clearly obvious this was not the most comfortable table for either the people sitting there or the employees that have to dodge them with each pass. We ended up getting a much more comfortable table and actually had the same server. I forgot to grab his name but he was top notch for sure. He took care of us, was witty and charming, perfect for the evening. I do have to say, the size of the place and the different vibe in each area will definitely give you a different experience depending on where you sit. The bar area was packed and you had to fight your way through to head to the restroom which is downstairs and very trendy. Yes, a trendy bathroom, communal sinks and a photo-booth to boot. Yes, of course I took advantage of the photo-booth, duh. So, keep that in mind that each area is a different setting overall. The cocktails, oh the cocktails. Everything we ordered was delicious. They had various concoctions and I had myself a few =) Penny Drop Vodka, House Made Ginger Cordial, Lime Juice, Ginger Beer, Fresh GingerThe Lift TicketVodka, Cucumber lime juice, elderflower liquor, and kaffir lime powder.  The Standard 69Gin, lemon, raspberry puree, topped with champagne.Yes to all of these delicious beverages but I believe the lift ticket was my fav out of all three. Delicious and refreshing. We started with the Bibb Royale - Bibb Lettuce, White Wine-Dijon Vinaigrette & Chives - perfect palet prep right here ladies and gents. I went with the Sunburst Farm Rainbow Trout, Israeli Couscous-Heirloom Cherry Tomato Salad - now the head on the trout while served, I could have done without it but overall the plate was delicious.

I was unable to finish the large basket of thinly-cut fries, but the ones I did eat hit the spot.eventually, we ordered dessert - a big tray of chocolate chip cookies with milk for dipping into. soft, chewy, and delicious.service was attentive.pricing? a little up there but worth it. the food and portions were surprisingly hearty.they take reservations and I was able to get one via OpenTable just a few days before we went. easy as that - who's got it better than us?",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

Came here for lunch with a friend on a weekday and it was super busy. Service was fine. We started out with the iceberg wedge salad with bacon and an herb-buttermilk dressing and the little gem lettuce with (lots of!) avocado, thin slivers of radish, shavings of ricotta-salata with a lime creme fraiche dressing. I preferred the gem salad, but the bacon was tasty on the wedge. If it was all mixed together, it would have a been a great salad.For entrees, we had the Hudson Valley duck confit with sauteed vegetables and lentils in a sherry-walnut vinaigrette and the grilled Atlantic swordfish on top of black and red rice, topped with a lemon-green olive salsa. Both entrees were really good, the meat from the duck fell off the leg and the vegetables were nice, though it might have been better if they were on the harder side for texture. The swordfish was very meaty and the salsa on top took it to a higher level. Very good combination. The surprise for me was the rice. I didn't expect it to taste the way it did, but the grains were fluffy and had a wonderful flavor to them as well.Then it came time for dessert! We ordered the summer cheesecake with a blueberry compote and graham cracker crumbs and the ""Ayabel"", which is a chocolate brownie served in a mini skillet, with hot fudge drizzle and almond brittle ice cream on top. The cheesecake was AMAZING. I would totally get this again - super light and airy and not too sweet. Of course the Ayabel was as expected, nothing new here except for the brittle part. It just left me wanting something else. In hindsight I should have went with my first choice which was the rhubarb crostata since I actually wanted something fruity instead of chocolatey. Oh well, that's my fault for changing my mind.Overall Standard Grill is a great option for lunch and I suspect dinner would be just as good. It does get busy, so I would definitely make a reservation or head over on off times such as 2pm or 3pm.

I got the squid ink linguine ($17 - cheapest entree) with some bits of seafood in it and it was a bit bland and dry. I could totally do better in my own kitchen. I had a few bites from my friends dishes (strip steak, porterhouse, some fish dish) and they were just as...average as the seafood linguine. The porterhouse was particularly disappointing as it was $90 and really wasn't that large. We shared a few desserts and the one that stuck out to me was the chocolate mousse. It came in its own huge mixing bowl and two giants spoons. There was some cake on the bottom, but that was completely covered by all the mousse and whipped cream. If you like chocolate, this would have your name all over it. Now on to the service, our waitress was superrrrrrr nice! She was really patient with an indecisive group, and even swung a favor for my friend: he waved her over and whispered a request for a milk with his dessert. She told him, ""we usually only for that for kids, but I'll make an exception"". Needless to say, he was a but embarrassed and we got a laugh. What really stood out to me was the fact that when someone left their seat and placed their napkin on the table/chair, the waitress would come over and fold it back up nicely for them. Wow!

We could see how people cook inside clearly, which was very fun! It might be weird to just order one dessert in a restaurant like that. But the waiter was really friendly and he let us do that. The name of the chocolate mousse is The Deal Closer, which is $14. It's a good deal cause the mousse was really big!

Here are my thoughts:Ambiance: Nice, lively atmosphere. Very clean and bright decor. No complaints. Bathrooms are a trip - definitely check them out.Service: Our server was definitely overseeing more than her fair share of tables, and thus it took a while to get her attention when we needed something. Not a big deal though, she was nice. Food: Average to slightly better than average. My Artic Char was nothing special, especially for the price. My husband's Chicken Paillard was also nothing special - he didn't even finish it. My BIL had the lobster sandwich, which he said was good, but he literally ate the entire thing in 2 bites - it was tiny. My SIL had the fish sandwich and really liked it. The Bread Crumb Pudding was absolutely disgusting - we all agreed on that.Prices: Pretty expensive, especially for the quality and quantity.Bottom Line: This place can get away with serving ""just okay"" food for high prices because it's attached to The Standard.

I usually get irate where seafood is concerned.  At most restaurants (anywhere) seafood is served in ultra small portions........whether it's shrimp, scallops, crab or lobster.  Really never understand why, I just know it to be that way.  I usually average 4-5 scallops per order,  I'm thinking I want more like 6-8 scallops, which always annoys me since I NEVER get that, and I have to make it work, last, satisfy me, and yet, here, I only got THREE in number.  Granted, they were large and meaty, but it was still only three, and I wanted way more.  That's it.  I can't wreckon my way out of it......and then, to add insult to injury, they sliced the asparagus and potatoes into tiny, and I do mean TINY slices.......with not much of either on the  plate, so I was just pissed off.  There was no way on earth I could possibly leave stuffed, but I really had to work out making my meal last, so I wasn't done 20 minutes before everyone else.  That bothered me....... but yes, it tasted good.  While the temperature and texture of the scallops were done quite nicely, it could have used just a smidge more on the flavoring.  That's just my preference. I ordered dessert.......and with my small sized meal, there was never a question.  I sure wasn't stuffed.  I ordered the Banoffee Pie, which was banana pudding with a cookie crust and toffee bits.  It was a disappointment.  I had far better at the Sweet Sunshine Bakery (not sure that's its proper name, the one down on the Lower East Side), but this was just a letdown to me.  Sounded great on paper, but it lost something in translation.  I didn't even finish it !!  I was simply bored by it.  My daughter's warm brownie sundae looked good, but I forgot to taste it.  I loved the ambience.....that was great.........and most of the food tasted really good too, but not all of it did, and if it did, well the portion size left much to be desired.  As for the bathroom, well, I cherish my story, but I think they could maybe put some signs up for idiots like me.  LOL  Maybe they really look forward to the dummies like me........giving them stories to tell of their own.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

296,8bZPNXY7vG7rTLCputIqYQ,Susan R.,1.0 star rating,"First time visitors for dinner 8/23/16.  Had heard wonderful reviews, but was hugely disappointed.  Had reservations for 5 people for 8:30.  Got there and the host was unhappy with us for wanting to sit inside versus outside (too warm).  Mind you, there were plenty of indoor tables available.  I'd say the restaurant was maybe half-full.  After waiting 15 minutes to be seated, we waited another several minutes before any servers arrived with water.  Our waitress was minimally attentive; finally took our orders but definitely did not want to be there. No checking in with us, no menu suggestions.  Made us feel like we were imposing on her.  And, I've learned that  it's never good for a restaurant when customers start looking around to see if there is anyone working in the kitchen or aware that people are seated at the tables expecting food and drinks and are happy to pay for them!.  We sat - without food - for more than an hour.  We could see into the kitchen - there were LOTS of people in there talking, but it didn't seem like any food was being prepared.  Finally a man - we think he was the night manager or something - started to hover at our table. So we asked him what had happened to our server and food. Our waitress came over to ask if we wanted more drinks and when we asked her the whereabouts of our meals, she said, ""well, you ordered a well-done hamburger.  That takes time, you know!"" More waiting and then one by one the plates were delivered.  More disappointment.  The well-done burger was served medium rare.  One of our friends order grilled salmon.  His plate contained one 4""x4"" square of grilled salmon unappetizingly plopped in the middle of a huge plate.  No garnish, no smattering of veggies in an attempt to make it appealing.  He said,""Oh, that was worth the wait!"".   The rest of our meals were mundane at best.  We didn't see the waitress again.  The manager came back at some point to answer one of our questions and told us that he had been away and came in today to reports of problems in the kitchen the night before that he expected had been addressed (apparently two new sous chefs who couldn't get things right, or something).  Instead of an apology, he said, ""Well, you won't have to worry about dessert"" as he walked away, implying, I suppose, that he'd provide that gratis.  However, by then it was rather late and none of us wanted dessert.  We told that to the guy who dropped off our bill (like I said, the waitress was gone!).  We had quite a rousing table discussion about whether or not to leave a tip (are you kidding me??), but since our friend kindly covered the bill, I don't know whether or not he did.  As we were getting up to leave, another server/busboy started to put dessert plates down before us.  We told him not to bother, but he very loudly told us that he was told to do it and therefore he was going to put down plates and bring dessert out.  That was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. We left before they managed to get around to delivering the dessert and neither the manager, the host nor any other staff member came by to apologize or smooth things over.  Our friends, who actually live nearby have sworn off the place.  No surprise there!",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

The back is a little darker and would be better in the evening, but I like my coffee with a little sunlight! I had the most delicious poached eggs of my life here. Poached eggs are one of those seemingly simple dishes that when done right taste like heaven but are so so easy to screw up. Don't get me started on the anger I feel when my eggs benedict have hard yolks. The poached eggs here were perfectly runny in the center, drizzled with olive oil and s&p, and served with grilled bread. I could eat that every morning and never get bored! The french toast is also tasty, it is a good dish to share with a friend since I am not one for total sweets in the morning.

The octopus and pork belly apps were good enough, small and nothing you haven't seen before. The wines on tap are a good idea because it was very warm inside with all the doors open and the wine would have warmed up too had it not been on tap. The service at the bar was real good; informative without being pushy, timely and pleasant. My water glass was refilled five times...

Food is amazing: the lobster roll I had here was the closest to the real thing that I've had - especially in NYC. Most recently, the scallops were nothing short of perfection. Seared perfectly! Aside from the great food, their unique cocktails are definitely worth a try! I'm not a fan of gin at all, but tried my boyfriend's drink ""Spring Bramble"" and it was divine.

No Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon blanc-- I mean we weren't asking for white Zinfandel-- but how do u not carry popular wines?! And the staff was kind of rude when they found out 1 of guests couldn't make it-- a party of 4 instead of 5 and they made us cram into the booth and took 2 table chairs away so weird.

We started with some of the specialty cocktails including the sunrise and the bloody mary and enjoyed both. I opted for steak and eggs, our friend for the strip steak, and the girls for the turkey club. Unfortunately, when the food arrived, after a long wait, it was a disaster. The fries were all ice cold and both steaks were incredibly dried out and overcooked. When we informed the waitress, she was very apologetic and immediately sent it back and we got new steaks and fries. This time they were excellent. Nice and moist and cooked correctly. The service in general was good, if not over attentive. Bonus points for taking care of the mistakes so quickly but I don't know why it took so long in the first place.

They can accommodate large parties and the proximity to the roof top and beer garden is ideal - we should have just gone there instead! What I didn't like:1. The Service- this was some of the worst service I've ever had.  Our waiter started taking our drink order and walked away mid-sentence.  When he returned, he told us that we were taking too long.  We addressed the topic with the manager who defended the waiter! 2. The food- While some of it was fine, not particularly creative or inventive compared to what I've had in other NYC bistros- my ""special"" short rib was very fatty and devoid of a lot of flavor.  Also our food took over an hour to come to the table- they blamed this on the shared roast chicken order.3. The prices- I would consider this expensive for what you get and they also tried to charge us $7/person for bringing our own bday cake!  The Verdict: This will not make my standard dining rotation while in NYC.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

366,5aZX8bTiD0k9vR60SG588Q,Alison C.,4.0 star rating,"Though it has been open for months, it is still impossible to snag a dinner reservation at the chic Standard Grill.  Luckily for me, my colleague was able to procure their private wine cellar for a corporate function.  When I arrived at the goregous hotel, it took me a second to actually locate the correct entrance for the restaurant.  Once inside, I was escorted through a completely packed dining room into the quiet oasis of our secluded dining area.  The room was surrounded by walls of glass that encompassed huge arrays of wine bottles.  A large, rectangular table ran diagonally across the room, but still left plenty of open space for mingling, switching seats, and snapping photographs.  The dim lighting and dark, woodsy feel made it the perfect environment for an intimate occasion.  We got the party started with some bottles of Pinot Blanc [(Weissburgunder) Falkenstein, Sudtirol, Italy 08] and Crianza Señorio de P. Peciña, Rioja [Spain 03].  Though the white was sealed with a screw cap, which I usually detest in theory, it was crisp, light, and sweet.  It acted as a perfect compliment to the upcoming fish courses.  The red wine was also fantastic with its bold flavor and low acidity level; it was perfectly balanced.  Though the wine was bountiful, few of us could forgo the quirky cocktail list.  I enjoyed two glasses of the H.M.S. PIMM'S, which included Pimm's Cup No. 1, Cointreau, Lime Juice, Prosecco, Winter Berries, Cucumber, and Mint.  It was very strong, but provided an interesting blend of sweet alcohol, fruit, and refreshing mint.In order to balance the beverage consumption, the restaurant thoughtfully scattered several snacks around the table.  Delicious mini-baguettes possessed crisp crusts and were topped with large crystals of sea salt.  Chunks of hard, dry Parmesan were great on their own or as garnishes for the bread.  Fresh radishes were also offered as a healthier option.  The meal soon progressed into appetizers, where many of us shared our plates around the table.   I, personally, did not enjoy the texture of the Haricots Verts Salad, which was doused in gooey yogurt.  However, the cinnamon and crispy shallot topping helped improve the flavor of the dish.   The Charred Spanish Octopus was heavily grilled, but this did not deter from its perfect texture.  The seafood was paired with Sweet Potato and Chilies, which was a unique mixture that actually worked well together.  The Seared South Carolina Quail was a delicate, petite bird that provided shockingly tasty, moist meat.  It was accompanied by a flavorful pumpkin seed salsa verde.For my main course, I opted for the Sunburst Farm Rainbow Trout.  The humongous whole fish was moist and perfectly grilled.  It was topped with an earthy, Mediterranean relish concocted from currants and pine nuts.I also sampled the Flash Seared Lamb Chops, which were smoky and robust, but no where near as cleanly and simply flavored as my trout.  The meat was seasoned with basil and served with crisp polenta.  The Housemade Saffron Pappardelle pasta ribbons were tossed with a hearty, sweet ragu of braised rabbit and shiitake mushrooms.The table also jazzed up our individual meals by sharing several side dishes.  The thickly-cut, Crispy Potato logs were sprinkled with smoked paprika and drizzled with a spicy aioli.  The traditional French Fries were less festive, but well-salted and just as crunchy.  The roasted Brussels Sprouts were another plateful of crispy goodness with their toppings of shallots and bacon.Lastly, a meal at The Standard Grill would not be complete without an order of the decadent Deal-Closer.  This dessert was a massive bowl of bittersweet chocolate mousse that was topped with whipped cream and Oreo cookie bits.  The treat was so dense that it needed to be served with a giant rubber spatula.  Each bite provided a sweet, chocolaty satisfaction that was scarily addicting.  An additional side platter of chocolate chip cookies softly and effortlessly broke apart to reveal gooey centers dotted with sweet chips.Our meal at The Standard Grill impressed not only our own staff, but our clients as well.  The service and food were exemplary, and I would definitely consider holding another function there in the future.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

Given the location is great for window shopping, spotting the odd celebrity, old men with 20 year old girlfriends and picking out the sons/daughters of sheiks and chinese businessman. Nevertheless, we dined here with a party of 3 and a 6 month old. Our reservation was for 8pm but we didn't get seated until 9.15pm (quote: Seinfeld ""you know how to 'take' the reservation, you just don't know how to 'hold' the reservation. And that's really the most important part of the reservation: the holding. Anybody can just take them""). From then on, I knew this evening was a downhill slope.Anyways, after the titanic wait we got seated outside which was great. Given we waited for so long and consumed about 4 drinks at the bar, we skipped appetizers and went straight to the mains. I got the salmon, my 2 visitors got the New York strip steak and we got the fries and summer greens as sides. My salmon was good but awfully small, while the NY Strip was decent but not the quality expected from this place. It was overly chewy and the sauce was a little weird. For $8, the fries were awfully small but I would have to say the greens were quite good considering they were glistening in butter (like Jermaine Jackson). We shared the dessert which was the brownie with a scoop of ice cream on top. I have to say that was pretty good but again, the portion size was for a supermodel.In summary, the service was impeccable though as the waiters were attentive with filling our glasses with water and bringing out our beverages.

But as with all great establishments, sometimes how you handle mishaps can really define you, and I can assure you, Standard Grill was absolutely flawless in handling a situation with impeccable, professional, 5 star protocol. Me and a friend went biking down from Hell's Kitchen into Meatpacking, so naturally we were in running attire, perhaps a little underdressed for the venue, but hey it's NYC, not LA. It's obviously an uber trendy spot and we arrived with no reservation despite it being a busy Sunday afternoon, however, they treated us no less they would anyone else.Our server, Nicki (sp?), was very enthusiastic and had great suggestions. I ordered the burger, my friend the steak and we waited for our food. Finally it came, but there was a hair in my burger - though honestly, I wasn't even that upset about it, and I was almost inclined to just pick it off and keep it pushing, but didn't at the insistence of my friend. Nicki came over and was genuinely concerned. I wasn't at all bothered by the incident, sure I was hungry and maybe a little disappointed, but it was a good day and mistakes happen.The manager comes over, on his own accord, and assures us that a beautiful new burger was en route. Additionally, he informed us that he would be taking it off the bill entirely, which was an exceptional response considering the additional wait time and caliber of the venue, but I was still greatly impressed that the restaurant took initiative to do this, unprompted, without me complaining or even being at all upset - I was perfectly fine with just waiting another 20 minutes.Needless to say, the burger came out quickly and it was delicious! I really enjoyed myself here, the food is incredible and the service is top of the line. I wish I was able to grab the manager's name, but everyone's diligence, genuine concern and rapid response really made me feel like a valued guest despite my young and ragged appearance.It can be a little pricey, even with the burger off, the bill was around $70 for the steak and about 2 drinks, but I happen to love spending money and this place is worth every penny.

384,SJmZ1bH6y5t5bNo-DLhecw,Carlen M.,5.0 star rating,"Finally, a work dinner made my dream of eating here a reality! We arrived here after work as a group, and the restaurant was still pretty empty. They tried seating us at this tiny tiny table where we were going to be overlapping our butt cheeks to squeeze in. We requested to be moved to another table, which was actually still on the tight side, but doable for the meal. From this experience alone, I realized, you cannot go to the Standard with more than 6 people in your party. They don't really accommodate large groups, or at least that night their tables weren't set up for it.The restaurant provided complimentary dry aged cheese on the table. It was a very small portion for the whole group, but it was very rich and sharp in flavor that maybe that's why the portion was bite sized. Meanwhile, I felt as though I was the only one eating the cheese. Perhaps everyone was afraid to dig in because of the portion, or maybe I was the only pig at the table :( Either way, it was good, so I couldn't resist. The bread basket was super cute! It was served in a paper bag, like the type you take to school for lunch when you are a kid. It was lightly salted also, which added a great flavor to the bread. I am one to dive into a bread basket because I only really eat bread when I am out for a meal. I don't actually keep bread in the house, so I always appreciate good bread and butter :) To start, my coworker and I shared a 1/2 dozen oysters and a 1/2 dozen little neck clams. They were extremely fresh and a good size. I also liked the extra sauce that they added to the plate that wasn't just a typical cocktail sauce. This sauce was fancier in looks and lighter in taste so you could actually taste the fish that you were eating. Definitely a perfect light start to a heavy meal. My boss ordered a few sides for the table to share. My favorite of all was the brussels sprouts. Luckily, none of my coworkers were so into brussels sprouts, so the side basically became mine. I kind of have an obsession for this vegetable. As a child I hated them, but now I could eat them every night. They had a very light garlic and oil flavor to them with onions and peppers mixed in. They were absolutely scrumptious. Another favorite way of eating them for me is when they are crispy. Lightly burnt by a frying pan is how I make them. For my meal, I ordered the Spiced Red Wine Braised Beef Short Ribs with Pearl Onions, Creminis, and Polenta. I definitely ordered the best dish at the table. It was served in a piping hot skillet in an amazing broth. The ribs fell easily off the bones, while the mushrooms were so juicy and plump that each one was not going to go to waste. The polenta was a perfect pairing to the meal because it was drowning in the succulent sauce. I ended up only eating half of my meal and taking the rest home for lunch the next day. Interestingly enough, the meal tasted even better at lunch reheated than it did the night before, which I didn't know was possible! Great job Standard, you made a meal that is actually good as a leftover too.  I am a huge fan of leftovers!  For dessert, my boss ordered a million desserts for the table.  The first dessert was called the ""Deal Closer,"" and it was a colossal mountain of mousse. It was very rich. Mousse is one of those things you can only have a few tastes of, and then it becomes too much. But the few tastes I had were very good. The way it was served was also very ingenious. They provided a spreading spatula to serve it with that one would use for frosting a cake or baking.Next up, was the Ayabel, which was a warm chocolate brownie served with salted almonds and vanilla bean ice cream. This was the dessert that won the medal for me. It was so rich and soft, and definitely came straight from the oven to our table. The inside of the brownie was oozing with fudge. It was just so good, that I could have had the dessert as my meal and been happy. The almonds and ice cream also added a nice contrast in flavors, temperatures, and textures to cleanse the palette with each bite. The Wake & Bake, which is warm chocolate chip cookies served with milk, had a cute presentation. It was served as though you were having a snack of cookies and milk.  Thick, very soft, warm cookies paired with a cup of milk. This dessert was a little harder to share as a group because of the size of it, and the dipping aspect of the milk. But no one had cooties at our table, so we all dipped our cookies into the milk. I will be honest, this wasn't the best cookie I have ever had, but it was pretty good. It could have had more chocolate chips added into it  to give it more of that melted fresh out of the oven chocolate chip cookie effect.I highly suggest trying this place out. It is in a great part of the city with the High Line above it, and right near all the meatpacking shops. Also, if you are feeling active after dinner, you can go ice skating on the mini ice skating rink they have set up outside the restaurant!",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

402,38lLLHyGDIb87hzi2mXwsA,Olaf K.,2.0 star rating,"It is with disappointment to say that we will no longer frequent this restaurant.  Our latest visit there really turned us off.  We've never been made to feel like second class citizens in any restaurant in NYC until our recent visit to the Standard Grill this past Wednesday. Basically, they would cram groups of six people into small booths in the middle of the room while leaving nice roomy round booths standing empty, waiting for ""VIPs"" whenever they deign to show up.  The maitre d' admitted as much to me when I asked him straight up.  We would've up and left, but since we're a group of six, it would've been challenging to find another place right away.  Things didn't get better from there.  We waited forever for our main dishes to arrive.  I didn't keep track of how long it was exactly, but the waiter had to come to us to promise that our food would be ready in ""two minutes,"" and if not, dessert would be on the house. Did the food come within 2 minutes? No. Was dessert on the house? No. While the other folks in our party enjoyed their pork chops and lamp chops, my seared scallops were pretty bad.  The scallops were half-cooked, which would've been fine if they were actually warm, but they were lukewarm.  They also weren't seasoned very well. I tried to finish it, considering it is $34 for 4 or 5 scallops.  However, I couldn't force myself to eat it all, so had to leave some on plate.  To be fair, everything else on the plate was delicious - lack of food temperature there did not bother me.  I must also say that the kale appetizer was very good; and we appreciate their splitting the dish into two individual bowls when we told them they were to be shared by two people. It's really too bad that our experience was way below par.  And to be treated like an inferior class doesn't sit well.  In a city with so much great dining to offer, we owe it to ourselves to go elsewhere.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

It's not the kind of place I would normally visit so that also makes it difficult. We came for dinner (early like 6:30) on a Saturday with a reservation. We were seated promptly at a decent table. The clientele was much different than we're used to...definitely everyone dressed to impress and snobby (for lack of better word). Everyone at the table started with a cocktail. Their list had very creative selections and everyone enjoyed their drinks.We started with some chicken liver royale which was quite tasty if you like liver pate. It was thick and fatty and yum. They were happy to replenish our supply of crostini after we ran out. I chose the rainbow trout for my entree. It was presented nicely with the whole fish on the plate (but not distastefully). The fish was cooked well but it had very little flavor. It was quite bland. It came with an Israeli cous cous salad which I enjoyed except for the cucumbers in it (I just don't like cucumber). My husband had the scallops which were very large and well cooked. He enjoyed the dish. We shared a side of duck fat smashed potatoes. Although the flavor of the potatoes was good, I was disappointed because I thought smashed meant more mashed. But it was literally just like some potatoes that someone put a fork through once and then called it smashed. Interesting...My friend had a pork chop which was simply awful. It was dry and flavorless. It was so dry it was really inedible because of the toughness. I would have expected a nice place like this to not make such a rookie mistake with something so simple as a pork chop!Dessert was the favorite course! We had banofee pie (shortbread crust with toffee and banana pudding). It was simply amazing. Very rich flavors but very, very good. We also had the ayabel (warm chocolate brownie with almond ice cream) which was really rich and delicious. I will probably never come back here. It's not my kind of place, it's not my style. Although I enjoyed some things, there were things that were simply unforgivable (like the pork chop) and the atmosphere of the place is way too snobby for me.

Came here because we saw a segment on Barefoot Contessa about it and I forced my significant other to come with me here and try it. It was great! Chicken was very tasty and filling, and definitely built for 2.My only ""complaint"" is that even though the bread underneath the chicken sounds good in theory (i.e. it cooks under the chicken, essentially caramelizing and soaking up all the chicken juices) it was SO greasy! Every bite of the bread was tasty, but I felt like I was dribbling grease too, and the grease wasn't even adding that much flavor. I wouldn't eat the bread if I came back here again. Meal starts off with bread (very good, like mini baguettes), and radishes with butter, as well as chunks of parmesan cheese. I know the radishes with butter is supposed to be very French, but we just don't like raw radishes, so we ate the baguettes with the parmesan (delish!). We also got the seared octopus. It was only our 2nd time trying octopus, and we had serious reservations about it, but our server encouraged us to try it because it was very popular and one of his personal favorites. I'm glad he recommended it because it was not tough at all!! We were cutting it with a butter knife.

This vantage point made for excellent people watching.I started off with the Rockefeller (Aged Rum, Applejack, Becherovka, Prosecco). It was good, a little better than normal. The orange pill inside also added a nice hint if citrus.Dinner Choice Tips:  If torn between the duck and soft-shelled crab, go with the duck. Both are extremely delicious. Both are paired very well with the other items included with them. However, the duck offers a much more filling meal. The crab seemed to have very little food included.Nevertheless, my experience at the Standard Grill was enjoyable.Next time I will have to try out the gigantic bar.

Though, I feel like the chefs in the restaurant can do better job, and food quality can be easily improved. The main problem is not with that.... I was shocked with the service. I remember that our waiter was very rude, and especially to me. My friends were all from South America, and spoke Spanish as a waiter did too. I was absolutely fine with that. Though, the waiter ignored my food order, and acted rude with me, compared to other girls in our group. The same way he acted with my other Russian friend, who joined us. Even my Latin friends noticed that, and were surprised by that, for both of us, my Russian friend and Me, were very polite with the waiter. There seemed to be no reason to act like that with us.     AND, Tadadadammm....I decided to come back a year later. Honestly, I though that the waiter was just busy and stressed out, for there were many people that night. I went to the standard grill a week ago for late Thursday dinner at like around 11:30 pm. This time the waiter was a tall, young man with with light-brown hair. I liked him, and he did his job very well, though my mood was destroyed right before that..     I am just wondering where the restaurant found these hosts and hostess?? Tell me the secret, where such rude creatures live? You are treated by them as you are a garbage. The second you step in to the restaurant, you feel unwelcome. I am talking about the girl with light brown hair, which was tied back, and a tall black man with long grey dreads. No smile, no hello/buy, the faces like you are bothering them form doing nothing!!!!!!! Horrible. Me and my friend were dressed nice and very appropriate, as we thought for such place. We were sit in the table for two. I went to the bathroom, and when I came back, they placed us on the table near the exit, which was not nice, and people were always passing by, had a feeling that they wanted to get rid of us as soon as possible. Plus, did not feel comfortable eating near rude hostess..     Conclusion:- food is just okay, really, better places to eat in the same area for the same price. - really need to change their interior inside, seems to be old, and messed up a little.- bar is good, and the drinks are very nice.+- waiters, good luck with it, such a lottery.- HORRIBLE HOST AND HOSTESS. STAY AWAY. the dinner was just basically ruined by the way we were treated when we entered the restaurant. My friend did not like it either, and won't come back for sure.  Maybe, come here again with my older friends, waaaayy older, and see how the stuff will treat us,...maybe, it just was because of my friend's and my young age.

446,PqPstIEEf8-rTDJiTUNn_A,Maria C.,4.0 star rating,"There was a forty-five minute wait for brunch around noon on a Sunday, so we popped over to the beer garden next door and had a couple beers and pretzels while we waited for the text that our table was ready. Awesome to have that option so nearby.Once at The Standard, we were seated in a great corner table underneath the arbor. We had out-of-town guests and they really enjoyed the vibe and all the people watching and the ""quintessential New York-ness."" Our server was nice, if a little too soft-spoken to be heard well over the cacophony of a Sunday afternoon outside in the meatpacking district. Nevertheless, very nice until she disappeared entirely around the middle of our meal, never to return. We literally saw neither hide nor hair of her ever again. Oh, low-talking server, we hardly knew ye! We were, however, able to flag down another person to present us with a bill, although it required a little more effort than most diners feel they should have to exert after stuffing themselves. But to that end, the food was very good.Our brunch entrees, coffee and mimosas were all delicious. I really loved my coffee, and I like how they bring it to you in your own little carafe. Eggs Benedict was just as it should be, except that I always feel slightly disappointed if I cut into a poached egg and the yolk doesn't sort of explode onto the plate. These were not to the point of being egregiously overcooked, so I didn't bother to send them back, but they could have been a little runnier. No matter, it was a great dish anyway, with awesome fried potatoes on the side and a server who was more than happy to bring me extra hollandaise when I asked for it (not, incidentally, our wayward lady of the whispered word - she had already disappeared into the ether at that point).The cobb salad was awesome. Just really, really tasty and fresh and perfectly dressed. One of my companions received the wrong omelet, but he said it was so good that he ate it anyway (hopefully whoever received his omelet enjoyed it just as much as he enjoyed theirs!) Also, his toast was advertised on the menu as ""buttered toast,"" but it did not come buttered (pet-peeve alert!) and when he received his butter on the side it was cold and rock-solid. We all know that toast cools faster than any other known matter in the universe and that applying cold butter to cold toast is no treat for anyone. So that was a no-go, but an all-too-common infraction among restaurants in general. The pancakes were really, truly perfect. I would recommend them to anyone in the mood for pancakes.The kitchen servers who brought us our dishes were super accommodating and didn't hesitate to make the trip back and forth for any extras after the food was served. That was really nice. The difficulty at the end in obtaining our check was the only real complaint, but I wouldn't hesitate to return on another beautiful sunny weekend day to enjoy a delicious meal before walking it off on the Highline.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

It was a really cute place and got a table right away in the front bar in the corner.  We didn't feel like sitting down for dinner in the main area.  Plus you don't need a reservation to take one of the few tables they have in front.  I ordered the Standard 69 cocktail, which was delicious and topped off with 3 perfectly ripe raspberries.  My friend loved the Penny Drop, which came in a cute bronze mug with candied ginger.  Strong drinks with great presentation.  My fiance got the South Hampton Double White, which was a good wheat beer selection.  We ended up ordering some food and loved it.  We got: Chicken Liver Royale - a really nice, rich pate with small crispy bread.  This is a huge portion, more than enough for people to share.Charred Spanish Octopus, Sweet Potato & Chilies - this was absolutely delicious.  Perfectly tender octopus with a nice charred flavor.  Steak Tartare à Go-Go - considered the best tartare I've ever had, it packed so much flavor!!!  Then we decided to get dessert, since the food was so good.  We ordered the Banoffee Pie, which had Toffee, Banana Pudding, Shortbread Cookie Crust - very yummy and light.  This is a great dessert if you're really full and just want something smooth and creamy.  We couldn't help ordering The Deal-Closer, which was a giant bowl of bittersweet  chocolate mousse topped with whipped cream and shaved chocolate.  Holy crap this was good.  We literally licked the bowl clean!!  This is an absolute MUST if you like chocolate.  I was actually surprised with how good everything was from the food to the service.  We had an awesome time here and would definitely come back.  Plus they have ice skating!!!",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

Standard Grill was perfect. They have excellent ambience, large portions, and very attentive wait staff. I ordered the pork loin and it was delicious. I literally had so many leftovers I had three meals out of the order! Prior to the entree they bring bread and a sort of strange combo of radishes and parmesan. I'm not sure what was to be done with the radishes so I pushed them to the side so as to not look stupid. I love the punch bowls and how festive/rowdy it gets with large groups sucking down alcohol drinks in a swanky environment. I can envision an epic birthday party here. We even spotted a celebrity dining in the corner. A cast member from Lost...we were stoked. It was great though because no one paid any attention. I love that after our meal the hostess helped us store our leftovers and coats so we could continue the party outside at the Beer Garden. I especially appreciate that because I've waited in the Beer Garden line to get in and never made it before! For a place that I was initially intimidated to go, I felt comfortable and really happy with the choice!

I love that they give you complimentary chunks of parmigiano with the bread. Nice touch. Also props for supplying a high quality butter and offering seconds.I ordered:Foie gras with balsamic roasted figs- I mean cmon. I haven't met a seared foie I didn't like and this one was terrific. Reasonably priced at $19 and a very generous portion. You get all the usual flavors in a foie dish- salty, sweet, buttery just awesome. The figs really added that sweetness to the dish that elevates the savory foie even more to the next level.Lobster thermidor with mushrooms, peas, and salsify- This was the dish I was so excited about. Its a classic dish not seen on menus these days. I was so happy I ordered it. A large 2 pounder arrives split in half and stuffed with a cheesy, creamy mixture containing peas, mushrooms, and chunks of luscious lobster and topped with wonderfully toasted breadcrumbs. Others have complained about not getting enough meat, but mine was pretty chock full. I was very happy with the amount of lobster in there. The stuffing was superb and that crunchy top was just awesome The only critique I have is more mushrooms, less peas. The pea to mushroom ratio was way off.Duck fat smashed potatoes were the perfect accompaniment. A great side that featured lots of roasted garlic and some olives to add saltiness. Dip in ketchup and enjoy.The brownie dessert called the Ayabel was good but nothing you havent seen before. But again, how can you go wrong with a piping hot brownie topped with almonds and vanilla ice cream? You can't.Head over to the Standard Grill for the food and the great scene.

They didn't seem thrilled with seating us without the rest of our party, but they didn't put up too much of a fuss. We waited only a few minutes and were seated right away.After ordering our first round of cocktails, one of our party noticed that one of the drink specials (The High Line Fling) was $55 and asked the waiter why it was so expensive. He said because it came in a giant punch bowl. That was no lie!! They brought over a gigantic punch bowl with this gorgeous pink liquid and 6 giant straws! Champagne, Orange Liqueur, grapefruit and lavender seeds floating on top, it was amazing and lasted us all night long. The straws became the subject of many a joke throughout the evening!As for food, I had the baby romaine with anchovy salad and the diver scallops.

When you walk deeper inside it seem like they had a valet area and then to your left was the beer garden which you can enter from outside the restaurant. Downstairs was the bathroom. It was a unisex bathroom you can go to either side to do your business and you share the sink. I mean there was no sign that tells you which side was for women and which side was men.  I'm not to sure what the divider was for that was centered in the middle, I'm guessing it was there to confuse you?

502,v7p1G7hYVMLcyPOO2QTZpA,Jake K.,3.0 star rating,"I've had a lot of internal conflict in coming up with the star rating for this review, as there was a great degree of variance between the quality of service, food, and managerial acumen we experienced.For starters, there was an abundance of confusion upon our arrival, as the maitre'd had given away our reservation to a similarly sized party that eagerly confirmed the reservation was in a name it certainly was not.  To make that even more awkward, they sat us directly adjacent to said party which did not get the ""ambiance"" aspect of this rating off to the best of starts.The confusion did not abate when our meat and cheese platter was delivered to our friends at the next table who stole our reservation.  They also did nothing to indicate that they had not ordered this particular charcuterie arrangement, and simply dug in.  Confusion continued when our overworked waiter attempted to take our food orders.  While our group was admittedly not the easiest to deal with when it comes to order modifications, food allergy specializations and the like, that had absolutely no bearing on how this turned out, as the waiter did something I've literally never seen before.  After taking the first three orders of mildly modified salads, he simply left the table and went to go refill the wine glasses of A DIFFERENT TABLE without explanation.  When he returned, he proceeded to number off our table (I know this is done so he knows who ordered what, but I've never heard it vocalized) and take the rest of our orders.  This ended up not mattering a whole lot because he came back roughly 30 minutes after taking the second half of our tables' orders to let us know that he didn't actually get the orders of the first half of the table put in.  Also, we finally got our charcuterie board.  But not the fries we asked for about seven times to tide us over, and the drink refilling was mostly done by those of us who ordered water as we were left to our devices with water jugs on the table.  Eventually, we did receive all of the food we ordered, although there were (predictably) several things wrong with the salads that had modifications, and our obvious displeasure was met with a very weak attempt by the overworked waiter to smooth things over with complimentary ice tea and soft drinks.  All of that said, the food was actually pretty decent.  So why would I be so conflicted as to how to rate this restaurant?  Well, when we finally were able to speak with the actual manager, he calmly apologized for the poor service and offered a reasonable explanation without excusing it.  He also comped our entire check, which was an incredible gesture and not one we were anticipating.  So what is the overall takeaway?  Perhaps this was a bad day for them.  Perhaps all of their servers got the flu at the same time.  Perhaps we got the worst combination of matire'd and waiter we possibly could have and it just wasn't meant to be.  But did the manager make things right and take the wind out of my sails and writing a wildly negative review?  He sure did.  And the food was actually pretty good.  I might actually come back.  Just not on the Monday after Easter.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

Ooo, a glass of prosecco or bottle of vueve.... BEST PART IS: The manager didn't keep his promise and by the end of the dinner no free ANYTHING was given.We got the bill finally after it took an insanely long time to get a couple small apps, our meals and finally the ""birthday cake"" which they suggested which was more of a slice of cake 3 days fresh from the bodega down the street.

SO DELICIOUS!! you can see the whole leg when u walk in held up on clamps and wow...amazingly good.  Chorizo was second best and saucisson sec came in last, just too fatty.*fois gras torchon w. huckleberries: served with toast. Melts in your mouth like butter and the huckleberries really bring out the flavor.*heirloom tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, basil w black olive-balsamic dressing: very refreshing but we were so full of jamon and fois gras goodness we slowed down on this dish*atlantic halibut w. green/white asparagus, pistachio black truffle sauce & poached quail egg: three of us ordered this dish also recommended by our waitress and wow...we were NOT disappointed.  Halibut was perfectly cooked and so moist with a nice golden color on the outside.  The sauce went perfectly and have the poached quail egg on the halibut just added more creaminess. so good.  And also so much that i shared half of my dish! haha*organic berkshire pork chop w. spiced salt: also accompanied by a mango chutney.  This looked smaller than expected and was well cooked but still moist.  Served on a round chopping board (cute!) Def not enough for my hungry fiance but he was happy and was even nice enough to share some with the rest of us.*the deal closer: bowl of bittersweet chocolate mousse topped w. whipped cream.  An amazing dessert, best chocolate mousse i've had in nyc!! and it's HUGE, we got one for the table since most of us were stuffed but were sweet talked into dessert by a truly bad influence!  Mind you this comes in a bowl with 2 full sized spatulas for serving.Great dinner, friendly atmosphere, great service and food was all delicious.  We are returning, and next time I'm definitely saving room for more of the deal closer :)",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

Literally sweating like crazy during the whole meal. There was A/C inside but definitely not in the white room. I was pretty embarrassed during the whole meal so thanks for that.  Service was spotty at best, our server just didn't seem to know what to do with our table of four, who ordered a few appetizers and brunch meals. Took at least 20 minutes to get our order taken, and two out of four of us had elements of our orders wrong. Sure it looks cool to not have to write the order down ,but I'd rather have someone write it down and get the order correct than just stand there and try to recite it back, get corrected twice, and still get it wrong.Award for the most bizarre upsell attempt - a sad,wilted girl dressed like Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz came to the table with a big farm basket. We're thinking YAY BREAD! but no, she was awkwardly telling us about their farm upstate and telling us we could buy a dozen or half dozen eggs right then, and they'd be ready to go home with us by the end of the meal.

With the exception of one not-so-great brunch visit, The Standard never fails to impress me. Grilled Octopus was plump and perfectly seasoned. Peekytoe crab soup was creamy without any cream added. Lamb T-Bones were better than I would make. My daughter still speaks about their crispy potatoes today. Our waiter was very knowledgeable when it came to wine and helped us both (my wife and I) with perfect pairings. Canary Island wine was a perfect starter. I always admired the team behind the Standard Hotels, their willingness to try new things and to experiment with different ideas.  The one and only problem we always have with them (and I don't want to take the star for it) are their snotty, model-wannabe, arrogant hostesses.

The bread was thick enough and strong enough to hold up to the burger but did not overpower it. The bacon and cheese added fat and salt to the burger and helped to complete the ensemble. For the four of us we ordered a bowl of the High Line Fling for $45, which was champagne, orange liqueur, grapefruit, and lavender in a huge punch bowl.

By the time we ordered our food it was probably time for the dinner menu but why on earth would anyone tell us that?

It was a chilled petit Syrah which wasn't specified on the menu and I really should have been told about since it was 5pm on a Tuesday in November. We ordered meat and cheeses and two turkey sandwiches to share. One of the cheeses looked and tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge for 6 months. The meats (including the $16 portion of Iberico) were completely dried out and terrible. The turkey sandwiches were pedestrian at best.

Instead he stood 5 feet from us and was having a FULL BLOWN Conversation with another couple that was already seated! We then told the female host to please put us on the list which she did after taking forever to figure out how to input our information into the computer. We decided to wait by the bar inside and have a drink. The drinks wer amazing! And the bartenders wer very nice and helpful. AlsoAll the food that Came out of the kitchen looked scrumptious! By the time we finished our drinks we received a text saying that our table was going to be ready Momentarily... That would have meant still continuing to stand where the outside hosts were...

This waiter also didn't have the time to waste to help us pick out a bottle of Champagne to accompany our meals prejudging us by recommending the cheapest bottle on the wine list. Finally we asked for a different waiter and complained to the manager who, even though, he made the pasta as we had it served the other day, insisted it is never offered that way. Basically calling me a liar! Another server served us and explained how busy brunch is and the kitchen is difficult in accommodating customers requests. We spent $400- at our meal and another $350- out at the ice rink with our kids and friends. 2 bottles of 175- Champagne and not so much as an apology from the management, who were too busy fawning over a table of French tourists next to us.

The Penny Drop came with sugared ginger and was particularly good. We also ordered Dante Cheese - it was delicious and came with a few small slices of wonderful thin bread, that had walnuts, raisins and cranberries in it. One of us ordered fries as well - they were served in a neet copper vessel. I did not try them - but the person who ordered them said they were good - but not the absolute best.

It almost felt like we are asking for a favor. As a customer, I did not feel welcomed there at all. She would not check back on us, we waited and waited. Bar was not that busy as it was already about 1 am. She kept looking at me and I asked if she could serve us one more round and she just turned away, pretending she did not see us asking for help. I finally asked a bus boy to get us someone. He walked up to the same bartender and they were talking for about a minute, looking at us and laughing. Now, that was uncalled for. She finally walked up with an attitude and said,"" what do you need?"" ........ Wow, what do I need ? I told her,"" another round of drinks."" She then pretended that she did not even know what we were drinking and again with attitude said, ""what around? What do you need?"" She had a such a bitchy and unpleasant attitude that I should of spoken to a manager right away. I did not want to ruin my night even more so I just a decided to write a review.

Bingo is free, although a table of 8 or more requires a $25/pp min. That's pretty easy to meet considering you'll be punching cards and singing the night away.Our table ordered the John Daly, a punchbowl vodka spiked remake of the Arnold Palmer. It arrived with a dozen long straws and we all got on it. Several rounds of cocktails and a bottle of Moet later we lost track of our bingo cards but not of the fun.The promoter floated around the floor in an adorable costume checking on tables and dispensing party favors. The host engaged the crowd with fun chants, karaoke and dance offs as a tie breaker. Prizes included bottles of Veuve, sports tickets and things I heard were great but drank a little too much to remember.Service was fun and really engaged us in the event. My only complaint is when it came time to pay she was scarce, and that took us a little bit longer before we could get up to Le Bain for more Standard fun.Recommend for: Birthdays, Bachelorette parties for women who think penis necklaces are lame, a fun date, out of towners, people who like drinking and fun.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

I've been to the Standard grill many, many times and last night was not up the usual standards by any means. They had about 6 or 7 different young and inexperienced bartenders packed behind a small bar. I was charged the wrong amount for my drinks a few times. Waited an hour for my steak an hour while 3 or 4 different items we didn't order kept arriving at our table. Finally my steak arrived thanks to a lovely male bartender who took charge and fixed our mess of an experiance. I then asked a lady behind the bar for steak sause who told me they don't carry it, however the lovely male bartender once again helped and brought us over steak sause. It seemed she just didnt want to help us because he brought it over in less than a mintue.Overall a weird and kinda funny experience but I wasn't impressed to be honest. This is supposed to be a high end restuarant in a fancy hotel? It was like ametuer night.My advice have 3 skilled bartenders behind the bar. Get rid of the army of pretty boys. The bar was extremely unorganized. Our table alone had about $100 worth of mistake orders sent to it. The women who seemed like the bar manager was a but all over the place. Didn't even know that they carried steak sause or didn't care to look for us . However the floor manager was great. Very nice and apologetic. The waiter/bartender who helped us out in the end was fantasic. So all in all I will be back, and hope the staff are back up to the high standard I've been used to for years. You don't train staff on a Saturday night and that's what  it seems the first bartender I got was doing. Nice guy but totally overwhelmed.

Red Meat, Protein, with a trendy twist, just what the neighborhood offered, and just what I wanted. The Standard Grill essentially smacked me in the face and said ""If you're hungry, we've got what you need.""Slightly underdressed, I decided to eat outside. It was a pleasant afternoon, with the Meatpacking district bustling with the trendy commonality that it incurs; Five: O Clock and Kiss and Fly was packed, the streets were filled, and everyone dressed like they were out for the night. While pleasant, there was a chill in the air and aside from the overhead heater, our server offered us blankets to keep us cozy while eating; this reminded me of a cool or rainy night at 230 Fifth. Three of four ordered the burger, I had mine with Gruyere. Very tasty, nicely presented, thick and juicy burger, home packed, not a patty, just the way I like it; how it should be, especially in the Meatpacking region of our great city. I suggest a weekend reservation, this restaurant under the High Line and connected to the Standard Beer Garden packs it in (sorry for the ongoing meat references).

Pass on the oysters, though - better ones are to had elsewhere. Great grilled steak, and the smashed potatoes are cooked in duck fat - Heaven! My husband had the duck meatballs w/bacon and foie gras served over polenta, and loved it beyond words. Very generous cocktails. The Eggs Benedict the following morning had the best Hollandaise I've had in quite a while, delicious.

Ordered the waffle which was like two flatter waffles stacked on top of each other with a side of whipped cream and scrambled eggs. Everything was cooked to perfection. My cappuccino was a little colder than I would have liked but probably due to the miscommunication of me ordering it from my initial server. It was still yummy so not a big deal.

We ended up racking up a $600 bill with the food and drinks. with all that waiting and the rude maitre'd i will gladly take my friends and money elsewhere. its not worth it - its mostly hyped up and overprice. the best part about the place is the decor.

Well this is not a review of the museum, I am reviewing The Standard Grill at the Standard Hotel. This is one of my favourite places in the city. We arrived at 2:15PM. The place was full. They have an outdoor and patio seating but we requested for a table inside. We were warmly received by the staff. It is always a pleasure to be received with such warmth in a busy New York restaurant.The luncheon menu offered limited choices, including a 3 course Prix Fixe choice. I like limited choices because there is less pressure on the kitchen and one is served with the freshest ingredients. Of course the restaurant offers a great selection of raw bar. Both my wife and I had made up our mind to opt for the Prix Fixe selection until my neighbour got served with mussels in a huge pot. That's only American. I quickly changed my mind and followed my neighbour's selection.  My wife stayed with her selection. When the pot of mussels arrived, I was astounded with the quantity. The first bite,however, finally took me to the bottom of the pot. It took a long time but I was in no rush. These were the best natural mussels I have had in a long time, I.e no steroids. The broth was hugely flavourful but I could only get access to it after devouring all the mussels and removing the shells. I like to enjoy the broth and mussels the same time. My wife was visibly not approving of my total attention to the pot of mussels and French fries served with the mussels. I can see why and realized that the company must get attention. It is the chef's fault. My wife is understanding and was glad that I enjoyed my main course and the museum. A piece of advice to the younger generation. "" IF YOU ARE ON A DATE, DO NOT ORDER THE POT OF MUSSELS AS COMPETITION FOR ATTENTION ON SUCH AN OCCASION SHOULD BE AVOIDED AT ALL COST"" I will return to Standard Grill anytime for food, service and ambience.

However, based solely on my last (both in recency and finality), one star is all it gets.My two friends and I put our name down and were told it would just be a fifteen minute wait. Not at all an issue since it was the afternoon and it was a little busy. We stopped by the Standard Biergarden next door and came back. The hostess then told us we could sit right away if as long as we left within an hour, or we could wait another ten minutes. It was an odd condition, but we opted to sit right away. The waiter dropped by immediately and asked if we were ready to order. My friend jokingly said, ""oh right, we only have an hour right?"", to which he quipped, ""yes, roughly"". We took that to mean the clock was ticking and they really were going to kick us out in an hour. We ordered a BLT and some oysters, and also asked for The Slow Pace, which is a big punch bowl of booze. The waiter said he'd have to check to see if there were any punch bowls available. Again, kind of weird but since it was a little busy we let it slide. Our food came and went (it was okay, nothing special. Hand-cut fries of noteworthy but who cares at this point?) and our waiter didn't mention anything about the $45 bowl of punch we ordered. Finally when he was clearly our plates, my friend asked, ""did you forget about our punch?"" and all he could say was ""oh I'm still waiting on that"". We just finished our lunch and are minutes away from the B.S. time limit they gave us and he still thinks we want a big bowl of punch? More likely he either forgot or didn't want to give it to us in the first place, because the polite thing to do would have been to tell us there were no bowls left and ask if we were interested in different cocktail, or just keep us updated at the very least.We told him we didn't want it anymore and to give us the check.

As a lifelong New Yorker I've always equated this restaurant with a lot of tourists, no natives, overpriced food that is probably good but not worth the price, and a bustling scene that is probably something that people not from here think what living here is like. Anyway...it was a lot better than I expected. Spanish octopus appetizer - pretty tasty, full of zest, and good portion for an appetizer of its ilkSteak Tartare - not a fan of this, done well compared to other incarnations but felt it was overly seasoned with lemon juiceStrip Steak - one of the better steaks I've had in NYC. Actually a very good steak, cooked medium rare with a flavor that for some reason reminds me of popcorn. I highly recommend this.Swordfish - cooked to perfection, soft, and the bites flake away from the main piece. Strongly recommend this as well.Bread crumb brioche - terrible, not flavorful, and way too fruity.Ayabel (some brownie dessert) - Holy Moly, this was awesome. Just chocolatey enough, making me sleepy and ordering the perfunctory coffee to awaken from its slumber.Service was on point. The cocktails were quite fine as well - I forget the names but had 3 of them from the list. Made well, but a bit on the weak side for the more citrus-fruit-ish ones.Overall I spent a little bit more than I liked, the ambience was that bustling NYC energy that everyone comes here to experience. Nary an American accent was heard. The bathroom is pretty cool, but again definitely made to woo the foreign tourist with its gimmick. For the price of my meal I could have taken a date with drinks in the East Village for comparable quality. But that doesn't mean this place isn't quality, I just wont be coming back because there is similar/better to be had for the same price.

If you want to be treated like a worthless piece of garbage...make your reservations here!I was hosting a bachelorette party of about 12 women. I called to make a reservation and spoke to a man named Daniel, who was INCREDIBLY rude. Aside from the dinner, I had asked if we could make reservations at Le Bain as well. He kept telling me that I could not make a reservation and I had to just go to the door and POSSIBLY get in. Which OBVIOUSLY wasn't substantial enough for me considering this was such an important event. I even told him money wasn't an object, I'd get a table and buy as many bottles as I had to for him to get me a reservation (who wouldn't want a group of 12 beautiful girls in your club, are you serious?). No success. Then, he kept trying to push the Gold bar on me instead and was so condescending. He kept telling me it was nicer and classier and maybe the bride would really want to go there instead and kept asking me if I was sure she wanted to go to Le bain. Are you kidding me? I kept telling him over and over again that all I wanted to do was give him my business and my money and I don't know why he was making it so difficult.Anyway, on to the dinner reservation. He finally told me I had to reserve the wine room because we had so many people which I told him was fine. He told me he would email me all the details as there was a spending minimum which he must have repeated to me a million times as if I didn't speak English. I kept telling him, I do not care how many thousands of dollars I have to pay, I just wanted to make a reservation for dinner for my specific date at 8:30pm. Friday went by, Saturday...Sunday, still no email. I finally called him back and he told me they already had a reservation for that time. So of course, like any other normal human..I was like ""Yes, it must be mine. i called on Friday but never received and email"". NOPE, it wasn't, he also tried to play it off like I didn't speak to him before. I KNEW I spoke to him before and was floored that he would give away my reservation and had to push back dinner plans to 930. And he was rude to me on top of it telling me, ""You didn't speak to me, relax"". That was when I lost it. I wasn't yelling or anything and was just trying to explain it to him. Then he tells me that this other reservation before me at 830 has already been set in stone for the last 3 weeks. EARTH TO DANIEL...why didn't you tell me this when I spoke to you and you were supposed to email me a contract and details? I don't understand how people can be so rude in the hospitality business. You are treating me like crap and are acting all high and mighty when you take reservations over the phone, RELAX YOURSELF.Anyway, it got to the point where I couldn't even deal with his pretentious a**. The lovely woman at our hotel called and made the reservations for us since we were a preferred customer and even she told us how unpleasant he was to deal with. We finally got there, had dinner which was pretty okay. I have had better, I mean...for how we were treated I would expect to eat off gold plates and maybe get a rub and tug after my meal or something, I mean, c'mon! I much rather prefer Santina down the block that actually has STELLAR food and an amazing staff! BUT our waiter, I wish I could remember his name. It was his first day, and he was AMAZING. So wonderful! He even walked us upstairs to Le Bain afterwards to make sure we got in and got a table, which was pretty empty...go figure!I hope this place goes out of business. They are all a-holes.

The manger was kind enough to remove the coffees and pastries that we ordered from our bill.

While this is something we very often do, especially in the village for brunch, the bartender acted as if no one had ever ordered anything but a Bloody Mary from him.  Good thing my friend ordered a Bloody Mary, right?! Hahaha... WRONG. It was a V8 disaster garnished with 4 different varieties of last-season's vegetables. I'm not good with math... a can of V8, one ounce of well vodka, and 4 stale veggies comes out to $12, right? I hope so, because that's what they charged.I ordered the french toast and she ordered poached eggs.I received pancakes and she received runny sunny-side-up eggs mushed into a ball. Yes, they flubbed my order and failed to poach hers.Exhausted by the unprofessional and slow service, I simply ate the pancakes instead of sending them back for what I had actually ordered. Too bad they were dry and tasteless. The brown and mushy bananas on top were a nice touch, but there was neither butter nor real maple syrup. Really. $14 for non-french-toast dry pancakes, fake syrup, and no butter. What the fuck did I pay you guys for?At least I got to have some coffee.. after it took them 10 minutes to realize I needed coffee, then another 10 to get it to me.Some restaurant experiences are fair, some bad.

If I may indulge my narcissism for a moment I should apologize to my fans.That said, I really do like this place a lot-despite the fact that it is in the Meatpacking.  Ironically, it is not the steak that I love here the most.  It is the cocktail menu (although I drink Martinis, I adore the menu, super cute), the parmesan cheese (chunks of the real deal at the table), and the amazing fois gras.  The red onion citrus mostarda is to die for, and we had to fight off Dana's fork as she tried to eat it off the plate, although she does not eat fois. Abominable;)The steak tartare tastes like kafta nayye which is a Lebanese favorite of ours, so it brought back a flood of memories to the table of Lebanese girls.  The lamb chops Nelly and I shared were also incredibly good, perfectly cooked, not too fatty and succulent.  Maha's dish I cannot remember, but I do know that she loved it.What bothers me immensely about The Standard is the fact that they do not have a filet on the menu.  There is a porterhouse, which includes a filet, but it is enormous, and must be shared, so that presents a challenge.  There is a ribeye which is a cut I do not eat.  There is skirt steak, which is ""meh"" meat.  There is NO FILET.  But why?For dessert we ordered the Wake and Bake and the meringue with berries.  Dana was going to devour the cookies but we honored her diet on her behalf and Nelly wrapped the last cookie to go and put it in her purse.  The gooey chocolate and buttery crisp would make anyone swoon but Dana would spend the rest of that night chasing Nelly around Le Bain yelling Coookiiieee. The meringue was insanely light and cloudy with cream and berries--mmm.Overall I continue to love this place and will forever.  If they get filet onto that menu I will give them a 5.  I really will.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

It was delicious as always. I was tempted to pair it with some oysters, which were surprisingly cheap at $2 each (I'm used to paying $3+ these days, unfortunately...) but I held back and stuck with traditional app and entree...Started with the Beet & Arugula salad. I've been on a beet kick lately (random) and this salad did not disappoint. It was loaded with yellow and red beets, served over the perfect amount of arugula, and dressed in a light vinaigrette. Fantastic.Then I ordered the Vegetable & Feta Salad from the entrees. I was trying to keep things light and this was the perfect selection. The veggies were cubed, as was the feta, and tossed in another light vinaigrette. I felt satisfied and not overstuffed... And this leads me to my only complaint: to call this salad an ""entree"" was a bit of an overstatement. Same goes for the Scallops (as ordered by my coworker). I am of the mind that an entree should be able to stand alone as your meal, and these would not have cut it. I have, however, had their panini, and my other coworkers ordered the Trout and some specials, and these were ample-sized portions...So overall, 4 stars.

A chance to converse about fine food, wine, travel, and European culture with......two super-hot European models! So I ordered something and a Brunello (glass). My wife ordered something too. She said Mrs. Bourdain was a class act and really nice. Mrs. Bourdain also apparently liked the food at the Standard Grill.So I give it 3 stars. The Brunello was excellent.

I thought they would have put some style into their restaurant, but after all it is a grill. There is a beer ping pong garden on the other side of the restaurant with heat lamps that reminds me of a pub crawl when the weather is warmer.  Not my cup of tea, but the sheer numbers that swarm here make it a crowd favorite.  I would come back for the Charcuterie, warm olives, and some red wine....",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

And he introduced me to The El Gringo, which may be my new all time favorite drink! Not fruity, but definitely not bland either.

That being said, I found myself wobbling around last night to the Standard Grill, and it was very worth it. It is the perfect spot for a girls night out dinner. The bar is exxxxxtremely packed-would never recommend getting drinks there, at least not on a Sat. The resto itself however-lovely. Great lighting, banquets, etc. Everyone is good looking, which is always a great thing. From the hostess to the dude that opens the door for you-all fab. Ladies: if you are looking for a resto that isn't stuffy where its appropriate to wear that dressy dress and mile high heels, this is the spot.So food. We were planning on more of a liquid meal, so I will start with the drinks. They have these huge fish bowls, yeah, like Sen Frogs style, that are either champ or bourbon based with big straws to share. We almost went for it, but neither of the drinks sounded that great. I instead opted for a (well, numerous) Highline, which is a cucumber/basil vodka thing. Any cocktail that is cucumbery is my go to, and this one was amazing. The other 2 girls switched their drinks over to mine after they tried it.We all ordered the branzino, which is also my go to. It was a delish filet (not a single remaining bone), in a light flavorful broth with apples, marcona (I think) roasted almonds, and a few other delish things. I was fantastic, but light and small. That being said, it still seemed worth it for $26.00.I would like to come back here when I am actually consuming more food than drink and try more dishes. A few more things to note: cute dish of radishes and parm cheese at the table to start, lovely bathrooms, yummy basket of warm bagettes topped with sea salt to start.

Grrrrrr!!!  Oh, I was so mad.Now, about this ""Million Dollar Chicken.""  I feel like if you're going to be that hyperbolic about how good your chicken is, you should at least be sure that it's oh, say, Thousand Dollar Chicken.  Or even $200 Chicken.  As it is, I'd say the MDC maaaaaaybee qualifies for its $34 price tag.  Maybe.  It's a chicken.  In a pan.  We found the white meat to be on the dry side, and the whole thing in general somewhat bland in flavor.  The big highlight of the evening was the brussel sprouts with bacon--absolutely spot on.  Perfectly caramelized, soaking in butter or bacon fat or something akin...I could have eaten 3 orders on my own.  We also took home an order of the bourbon bread pudding, a menu inclusion that makes me quite confident the pastry chef can see into my soul.

Its the kind of place people go to see and be seen. Perhaps a celeb sighting. The kind of place where you call for a reservation and the earliest available time is 9:30pm. Which for many NYers, that is an appropriate time to eat dinner. For the rest of us....well, when in Rome....So 9:15 it is. We arrive early to catch a drink or two. As expected, the bar area is jammed, and the patrons are spilling on to the bistro tables. We manage to order one round and then spy a bistro table open up. Making a bee line for the table, we are immediately told these are for waiter service only. Considering we just ordered fresh drinks, we give the table up to the very happy group of four that were two steps behind us in a quest for seats as well. Back to standing near the bar, side stepping to either side to let people pass through every few minutes. Finally our table is ready at 9:25. And where do you think they sat us? Not the cozy booths in the dining area, or the tables up front that are fantastic for people watching. Our reserved seat was one of the very same bistro tables that anyone at the bar area could have easily taken over. When we requested a seat in the dining room (considering we've had reservations for almost a week!), we were told the wait was another 45 minutes.I like high end places. Despite the patrons who behave as though they are entitled to be taken care of immediately, despite the ridiculous prices for a glass of average champagne, despite the tiny spaces crowded by too many pretentious looking people, I enjoy being a part of the atmosphere from time to time. What I do not enjoy is the staff who puts on airs as if they are **really** sorry you now have to wait til after 10pm just to be seated for dinner, when they are actually not sorry at all. So we waited.The oysters were delicious, the rack of lamb prepared very nicely. Two thumbs up for the octopus appetizer as well. All in all, the food was tasty, nothing spectacular, but nothing disappointing either. Lovely decor, interesting bathroom design, but if I never had another reason to come back, I probably wouldn't. Our waiter seemed very preoccupied, and the experience was only fantastic because I shared the evening with two of my best girlfriends. Sadly, the restaurant did not contribute much to our night out.

Their plates, napkins, and wine glasses were all nicely arranged to give the wonderful fine-dining feel. I even liked how clean their menus are- simple, printed on quality paper, with items that describes itself. There's no need for a long paragraph of description below the name of the dish, and I definitely appreciated that.BUT the food was NOT good! I went there for lunch, and I was sorely disappointed!! I had their turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce and salad on the side. For a $16 dish, it was quite disappointing. Thankfully the turkey wasn't dry, but it was still tasteless and bland. I appreciated how the cranberry sauce was not overtly processed. I could tell it was made fresh, because I even got a piece of cranberry in my sandwich, but when I bit into it, it was SO sour I spat it back out. BLEH! OH, and the SALAD tasted TERRIBLE! Absolutely GROSS. I felt like I was ingesting hydrochloric acid, because it was all just dunked in white vinegar. It almost gave me a heartburn going down. Lastly, they had poor service. I'm not quite sure if it's because I went there on Thanksgiving Day and they were poorly staffed or what, BUT we waited forever to get our checks! Our server was polite and the food came out timely, but he was nowhere to be found after we told him we wanted our checks. The restaurant started getting VERY crowded, and I swear the hostess was giving us a death stare as if we're the annoying customers who didn't want to leave. Then we asked for the checks again, and someone else (besides our original server) brought it out for us. Seriously, WTF did our server go? At least if you had a breaker, let us KNOW! I've worked in the service industry before, and I've never just bounced on my customers. Anyways, it was also crowded that I felt like I was always trying to dodge people on my way to the restroom.

We got there early, excited about the Standard's reputation, fought our way through the nightclub-like crowd, and found a hostess only to be told to wait 40 minutes. (My mom, being a fancy foodie made said reservation a month in advance). And had the place not to been so packed, maybe the waiting wouldn't have been quite so painful.Anyway, a drink or two from the bar later, we were seated. Our waiter seemed slightly like he had forgotten his Prozac but warmed up eventually. The bread and butter combo was joined by little chunks of Parmesan cheese and fresh radishes...sadly, that may have been the best part of the meal.The french fries were decent, the veges were fresh, the free potato dish was fine, but my New York strip wasn't something New York would be proud of. The lamb chops seemed to be a hit, but after it was all said and done, my table of six just wasn't all that impressed. I think that also may have had something to do with the taste of frozen, partially thawed strawberry shortcake that lingered in our mouths as we were rushed out the door.Wholly unimpressive compared to their reputation.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

Our waiter was superb and kept us entertained and pleased through out. The highlight of our experience was your general manager, Soy Chiever (Soy you ROCK!!). She came over and recommended the best hangover cures, gave us the bourbon donuts on the house(unreal), checked all of our baggage in their back room for the entire day because we checked out of our hotel, and left us her card to make sure we mention her at any other Standard dining experiences to get the best treatment.

For the steak, I'm not traditionally a filet fan but the waiter recommended it and it was perhaps the best filet I can remember having.  Maybe that doesn't say too much since I don't often order them, but we'll return.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

We weren't in a rush so we waited at the outdoor bar area and ordered fries and a cocktail to start. We were seated in 20 minutes and immediately looked for the chalice on the menu. Alas it has a real name and it is called the John Daly with a pricetag of $55. We each ordered entrees too which I think were a bit expensive and good but not worth the price. It was the holiday weekend though so we decided to go all out, and who doesn't deserve some good food and ample drinks after a long work week?

However, the lack of good service overwhelmingly takes away from what would have been an otherwise delicious AND delightful experience. The purpose of brunch was for a friend's birthday. I had confirmed with the hostess that a dessert with a candle would be brought out at the end of the meal. Unfortunately I got the check first and had to awkwardly disclose in front of my friend that they forgot the cake. Even more frustrating was that the waitress said she had no idea and that it had not been communicated to her previously. I mentioned the lack of service to the manager and she excused my feedback with the fact that they were busy. I always find this response from restaurants to be unacceptable.

So let's get down to it - the service is HORRIBLE and the menu is overpriced and although this is to be expected, it's hard to justify paying a lot of money for bad service and mediocre food.As background, i grew up in the restaurant and food-service industry, so i understand that servers and the kitchen can get overwhelmed - however there is absolutely no excuse when you ask a server for a glass of water 4 times - and never receive it, when you order a sandwich at the same time as the entire table and everyone at the table gets their food but you - and 35 minutes later your sandwich comes out, there's a serious problem.

It looked like a cool place to maybe sit outside and people watch, with a nice meal in front of you. I'll rate service and then quality of food. Service from the get-go was not good. We waited outside with some other people and the two women out front taking names completely ignored the line forming. The hostesses seemed to be having a hard time controlling the groups of people that wanted to get a seat. When some tourists came to the front to ask for a menu, they looked at the menu and then said yes we would like to sit and the hostess went to seat them while there was a line of people, including my friend and I, waiting to even put our name down. Many people behind us were annoyed. We sat down and looked over our menu and while the waiter was bringing out our drinks, we thought that we would get some bread-and-butter as we were able to see at other tables nearby. That was not the case. The bread and butter came along with our appetizers at the same time. Food wise it also wasn't that great. For an appetizer we had shrimp cocktail and the shrimp were small to medium-size and very overpriced for what we received. We decided to order a couple of things and share so we ordered the lobster roll and also the brisket sandwich. The brisket sandwich was quite good. It came with french fries and the french fries were probably the best thing we had for lunch that day. The lobster roll was not good. It was tasted unbearably like too much dill and my friend agreed as well. Also, the lobster even though it should be cold tasted as if it was frozen and thawed an hour before. We also ate french fries that came in paper cones and one good pickle that was on the menu. We paid about $120 for essentially pretty good french fries. I would not eat here again. It seems like it is a hyped up place -very good for tourists and close to Chelsea market but there are other areas where you can eat that are much better, much cheaper and offer very good service.

797,h8Etj197fQxY7e6YLIYzjg,Michael F.,2.0 star rating,"I've been to the Standard Grill a couple of times now, including this recent trip yesterday, and the food is pretty good and nicely presented. I'd been there about a year ago after a walk on The High Line with my family, and we had a reasonably serene meal. This time, however, two fairly egregious service mishaps (waiter's fault, without question), made the experience less than stellar.Upon arrival around 3:30pm, my brunchmate was waiting at a table. A spicy bloody mary was also waiting for me, which was pretty nice and tasty, and served in an attractive glass. Given that the ambiance is pretty open, airy and full of light (if a tad boisterous), we were off to a good start.We ordered a dozen oysters as an appetizer, specifically Blue Points, Hama Hamas and Barron Points. My dining companion ordered Brioche French Toast with buttered rum, walnuts and bananas, and I ordered the Two Poached Eggs with olive oil, cracked pepper, maldon sea salt & grilled sourdough. Simple enough, right?Call me spoiled, but I like to have my meal in sequence. If I order oysters as an appetizer, I get a tad edgy when they show up before the main course, especially when I haven't been forewarned. Within five minutes, the main courses showed up... before the oysters. We debated this with the busboy who was delivering them, and the waitress showed up a minute later to explain that the kitchen was in the middle of the afternoon menu shift; since we'd been given brunch menus, it was fine for us to order, but they were switching the kitchen over and needed to get our mains out quickly. Um, I need to be aware of this why, exactly? There's no way to accommodate this sort of shift? Have they never done this before?  Or, if I do absolutely need to be aware of this, wouldn't it be a good idea to set my expectations ahead of time, rather than be excited for and expecting a dozen oysters, only to be given eggs and french toast instead? This could easily have been mitigated, and the ""sorry"" we got from the waitress just doesn't cut it. You just ruined my meal and you're sorry? Great, thanks for playing! We dealt with it, but oysters do not make a good follow-on for French Toast.That might have been the end of it, and I would have been only somewhat annoyed; however, moments later, she showed up with our dozen oysters, only without the Barron Points (which they apparently were out of), with a substitution of more Hama Hamas instead, which they took upon themselves to choose for us. When she put them down, I indicated that I probably wouldn't have chosen that way if given the option, and she said, ""Well, that was what he (the shucker) picked, but I'll be happy to take them back and get you others instead if you want."" Um, that probably should have been offered before the oysters arrived, sister. Waitress 101? Fail. Faced with the prospect of having to waste food, we took them anyway, but it was adding insult to injury at this point, especially when BOTH issues could have been avoided to begin with.Food, four stars.  Service, one star.  Split the difference and make it two. This sort of service is inexcusable in just about any case, but especially so when the brunch costs excess of $100. I'm sure I'll be back because, as I said, the ambiance and food are good, and I am imagining the likelihood is that I won't have the same inept service next time, but three strikes and you're out. This is strike one bitchez; hope this doesn't happen again.Oh, and do you think the management of this restaurant reads reviews here and gives a shit? Seriously doubt it, but I can be proven wrong.

798,kyIff9CZ7NVyoz-rz4EOWQ,Kevin G.,4.0 star rating,"Really pleasantly suprised by my first proper meal at The Standard Grill. Showed up without a reservation after a long walk from Brooklyn with a friend visiting from San Francisco. Along the way we met up with a few other friends, so there were five of us total when we arrived at the Standard Grill. After poking our heads into the Biergarten, which seemed bustling (but with a sort of expense-y crowd...lots of baggy suits and blue shirts per capita), we decided to try the Grill instead.After a quick brush with the icy, imperious maitre d', we were seated outside. The air was brisk, but just on the right side of too chilly for al fresco dining. Service was very good -- our waiter was just the right combination of warm, casual and thorough. Drinks were all very good. Three of us shared a bottle of wine, the other two had cocktails. I was a little disappointed to see that the Penny Drop is no longer served in a little copper vessel, which I had thought was a nice touch on a previous visit.All the food was excellent, although we kept our order light. An assortment of oysters were perfect; the burger and fries were both great, although the general consensus seemd to be that the artichoke soup with shad roe and a poached egg was the real highlight. I was also impressed by the assortment of freebies for the table, which included very good bread and fresh butter, plus radishes and coarse sea salt. The waiter was nice enough to bring a dish of complimentary roasted potatoes with aioli, too.Considering its newness and the fact that it's still sort of a hot spot, I was expecting the Standard Grill to be a hassle, but it was just the opposite. I have high hopes for future visits, which given how good everything was, will likely be soon!",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

I've been here once for dinner (2 weeks after opening), and once for breakfast (2 weeks after they started serving breakfast).  So the food I had for dinner was...ok.  They give you rolls and butter and kosher salt/rock salt when you first sit down as well as a little bit of parmesan and olives.  They have lots of cheeses, pates and meats on the menu like any french bistro.  Therefore, you'd think they would have great bread...but it's not good!  It's hard and all around chewy.  Why not crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside? They serve it in a little paper bag with the sides rolled down which is cute, but is it too much to ask for good bread?I' sampled the wild mushroom ravioli (was ok, not a cream sauce, was just in broth) as well as the oysters (which were nice).  I've had the Lobster Louis which was a little mayonaisey, but delightful.  It had some chopped stuffed olives in it to give it a little saltiness which was nice.  But it was lacking a certain freshness - like some dill or parsley or celery that would have just given it the little lift it needed.  My friend got the chilean sea bass which was supposed to be in a ginger soy type sauce but when it came out, it was in a curry spice type sauce and it was like ""huh?  is this what i ordered?"".  I really disliked it because I am not a fan of cilantro and it had a strong cilantro taste.But the great part of the meal was the dessert.  We ordered the Strawberry Fool and the Blueberry Sourcream Cheesecake.  Both were absolutely delicious.  The strawberry fool were layers of strawberry granita, vanilla cake, fresh berries and I think ice cream too.  It was so refreshing, light and just full of fresh berry taste.  The Blueberry cheesecake was also very fresh and it was very light. Not too sweet.  It was fantastic!For breakfast, I got the standard egg white omelet w peppers and mushrooms which came with a piece of toast (it came buttered and I had to send it back b/c I asked for no butter) and crispy home fried potatoes.  The homemade jam was delicious!  My friend got the Bagel platter with sturgeon and lox with capers, red onion and tomato and cream cheese which looked fantastic served on a little wood chopper board.  If you order coffee, they bring you your own individual pot and it's only $2!  All of the breakfast items sounded fantastic and I'm sure they are fabulous and carefully made.They also seem to have a huge outdoor area great for happy hour.   Can't wait to go back!",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

The adjacent room, however, where my girlfriend and I were seated, has a completely different feel: it looks more like an old-school dining area, where oil tycoons might have smoked cigars over large steak dinners back in the day. (Must have been the effect of the 'power' reds.) Other interesting detail: There are pennies stuffed into the swiss cheese-esque rubber mat on the floor. (Cute.)We ordered the broccoli rabe as an appetizer, though it's actually a side, which our waiter took cares to point out. (Apparently, any change, however slight, to the status quo in MePa creates mass panic.) Not a fan of the dish: too bitter. No worries, though, because my lamb entrée was super-b: perfect comination of spices and very filling. Washed the meal down with their Pimms cocktail. Mmm, mmm, good.(Aside) Question mark moment: I'm not the most attentive person, so when I descended the stairs to use the powder room, imagine my surprise when I found the area split down the middle by a curious chain curtain.

While the crowd borders on a mob near the bar - a nice drink selection, quick service once you part the human sea, and reasonable prices. Not alot in the way of beer, so you may be better off going to a nearby spot if you're looking for brews (perhaps the ""Biergarten"" that will soon be opening close by).Bad starts seem to be a general theme of the other reviews I've read - my dinner followed suit: our meal unapologetically started 30 minutes late (we were asked to wait ""a few"" while out table was set up) in the front atrium area (as opposed to the main dining area where we had reservations). The waitstaff seemed completely and entirely overwhelmed; the entire bar area had no more than 2 waiters, each of whom found their senses continually barraged by waves, gestures, calls (""garcon!""), and the defeaning din of the restaurant.Despite the circus environment, however - and the unavoidably inattentive staff - the food here is actually not half bad.The bread course was delicious. Some of the best restaurant rolls I've had in NYC. Crusty and salty on the outside, soft on the inside. Amazing. Appetizers and Mains didn't quite live up (the 40 minute break between the two courses was also less than stellar), but were still decent. A well-prepared charred Octopus was presented on an addictively spicy mash of sweet potatoes - both texture and taste were dynamite, and formed a tasty mix of salt, spice, and sweet. A large portion of succulent but firm Grilled Swordfish was a hit. As was a massive serving of Rainbow Trout with current and pine nut relish (the garnish itself resembling a crunchy cranberry sauce that was a nice post-Christmas treat). Sides - though they arrived some 15 minutes after our food - were very good. Crispy Potatoes with Aioli rank as among the more delicious reimaginations of patatas bravas that I've eaten. Duck Smashed Potatoes (though curiously not ""smashed"" at all), were tasty but uninteresting - literally, just fingerlings rubbed in duck fat...Final thoughts? Despite a variety of service miscues and waits, still an enjoyable meal, though I wouldn't be racing to come back.

The best and only ""WOW!"" dish was the side of potatoes...which I admit, were A-MAZ-ING.  Everything else was disappointing.  Even the ricotta cheesecake that the bartenders ravedddddd about was nothing special....I like the decor--it feels kind of retro, a bit old school, and since it was a Sunday, it wasn't crowded and the atmosphere was quite pleasant.  If it weren't my Aunt, who I hadn't seen in months, I would have been even more disappointed.  I won't be back for food, but probably for a drink.(P.S.

I always order foie gras whenever I can at any restaurant and it's especially different at The Standard. Imagine poking into the yolk of a sunny-side-up egg and there you go... The Standard foie gras.Basque Lobster Stew peppers, fingerling potatoes, white wine      26.00-- I thought this was amazing, and the portion they give you is HUGE! There is so much stew and big, honkin' chunks of fresh lobster in here. It was a bit overdone and too chewy, and by the end, I was tired of using dainty little picks to claw at the stubborn meat which mocked me from inside its fortress of lobster claw, and ended up using my fork and holding the claw down. Nothing separates a girl from her lobster meat!!!Dessert was an amazing maple (with apricot?) cheesecake that was simply to die for. It had a sour cream topping on the top of the cake that was really good, but the funny thing was that the texture at the back of the cheesecake was dramatically different than the front, which was all mushy and not as packed with sweet flavor as the back, which had the texture of tofu and was pretty flavorful. My friend and I both noticed that as we worked our way through the entire cheesecake. Weird. I also had a double espresso, which was slightly bitter by the time it reached our table. It was also teensy tiny... are you sure this isn't a single?I knocked off a star because while we were enjoying our appetizers, the waiter refilled our bottle of water and set it down, and a friend promptly noticed that the bottle of water had BROWN GUNK IN IT. Yes, that's right-- BROWN GUNK IN THE WATER! We all stared at it, unsure because it was so blatantly obvious that the water was tainted and the brown gunk was swirling happily around and around. We hailed a waiter, who immediately looked horrified, asked us if anyone drank from it, and snatched it away immediately. EW ew ew.Other than that, we also had slices of parmesan, bread, and radishes to munch on while we decided what we wanted. I can't speak for the bread but the radishes were pretty unique as a snack and were really, really good. Also, the penny floor is fun! I didn't notice it until I dropped my clutch and camera on the ground because it slipped out from the back of my chair.

I pretty much judge every breakfast place by their eggs benedict, and this one was one of the best I've had. The hollandaise sauce was supremely silky, creamy, and tasty. The Canadian bacon was meaty; it didn't just taste like a slab of Oscar Meyer ham that was cut into a circle shape. The muffins were fluffy and tasted fresh-baked. My Momma got the olive-oil poached eggs, which were also really good. She got it with a Murray's bagel, which is always delicious, but it was weird because they toasted it...that's just taboo.The decor was clean, white, and French. The waitstaff and hostesses were all well-dressed and slightly trendy, giving the place a really put-together look. The bathrooms were a little bit confusing, since it's a little hard to tell which side is for men and which side is for women (tip: look at the coins on the floor at the entrance).Prices were pretty average for a nice breakfast place, though I do wish there had been more variety. Most of their dishes were pretty classic (or rather, standard...ah hah hah hah......ok sorry), and I wish they had been a little more creative with the menu.Later, I went back for drinks at the bar outside. Lots of tall metal tables,  kind of like trendy patio furniture. The bar was lit with purplish lights, and there were candles on all the tables. It was neat to sit beneath the Highline Park. There were also some loungey-type chairs and a few ping pong tables, which was a cute touch, although the people who were playing got a little annoying and loud.The scene was mostly trendy, working, white 20-somethings. Most of the guys wore slacks and button downs, and the ladies were either in dressy work-type clothes or heels, skinny pants, and a nice top. I guess I liked the vibe, but I really hope I'm not part of that scene. It's just a little weird. There were a lot of good-looking people though, which is always nice. I had the Penny Drop, which was really tasty--a ginger limeade and vodka drink that came with a big chunk of candied ginger. Very, very good! Didn't taste too strong, but it was so tasty, I didn't care. It was $10, which is steep, but I guess you pay for the ambiance or whatever.

One of our friends asked if he could get a beer on tap and she suggested that he could go over to the beer garden and order one himself and bring it back. Otherwise, he could just get bottled beer.

It's not so bad considering they have a bar and a menu full of great cocktails- The Penny Drop is truly something great, comes in a cool copper cup, worth saving your pennies for, its for that drink alone and the overpriced, very tiny yet tasty oysters ($41 for a dozen) that they get 2 stars. One star for each. However, the cheese plate was a joke. It basically consisted of some nice Kraft American singles cut into triangles and a small clump of blue cheese; served with sliced sandwich bread and a couple various salamis. They don't even want to put enough effort into ""trying"" for a cheese plate so they should just take it off the menu. The rest of our entrees were agreeable, pretty ""standard"" but don't even get me going on the service. Meager and amiss. Ridiculous.

They were on the check.."" and he walked away.  We never got our second coffee either, just one metal carafe that filled up one coffee cup 3/4 of the way, and the other about 1/3 of the way.  The waiter acknowledged that we hadn't gotten the other coffee a couple times but didn't bother to do anything about it.  When we charged for two $3 coffees, we asked that one be removed since we never got it, and the waiter actually argued that we had both drunk out of our cups  so what was the problem?  I'm aware of the mark-up on something like coffee, but I'm not paying $1 a sip for it.  Our waiter clearly didn't agree and made sure we were aware of that fact by giving us his best nasty face before revising our check.Like a cherry on top, 2 different runners tried to serve us a second lunch as we were settling the bill, which was strange given there were no other tables in our waiter's section that were waiting for food.  The staff at this place have no clue what they're doing.  Don't waste your time or your money here.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

I am updating my original review of The Standard Grill dated 7/14. I have never retracted a review before, but today's experience calls for it. I arrived early and settled in at the bar as I waited for a friend. I also waited to be acknowledged by the bartender as I was completely ignored (Cellophane, Mr. Cellophane you can see right through me, walk right by me....)  As I booted up my laptop to check for some email, I figured that if I wanted a beverage I was going to have to ask for it.  A simple hello would have been nice, but being ""too cool for school"" I was simple returned a blank stare when I asked for a club soda and the password for the internet. It was the interaction that followed that sparked this update.  The bartender said he didn't know the password for the internet and said he would ask someone to go and get it.  A server returned and said he asked the manager for the Internet password, but that there was none and that you had to be a guest of the hotel to use it.When I told him that he was incorrect and that the WiFi was available to the public (as the landing page instructed) he said ""Well that's what my manager told me"" and then he just shrugged his shoulders and started to walk away.  I said excuse me, and asked him again to help me but he just shrugged his shoulders (again) and told me that I should ask the hotel.  When I asked him if he worked at the hotel, he said ""I work at the bar.""  And then said that I could go ask the front desk for the password.  It was an easy decision at this point to leave The Standard Grill. It was clear that it has gone the way of every other MPD establishment in the nabe.  I am now writing this review from The Maritime Hotel's restaurant ""La Bottega"" (just a few blocks away in Chelsea) where I was not only greeted with a warm welcome and hospitable service, but enjoying a delicious lunch with my friend!  I should have come here to start.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

Apparently, it takes 30 minutes to tie balloons to a chair. They assured me that we'd be seated well before 11:30. Well, I show up at 10:55 and end up standing around for over 30 minutes. I had to have the birthday girl's boyfriend stall so that they wouldn't show up before we got to our table. The staff was totally incompetent and repeated, ""We're still setting your table"" about 5 times to me. The most infuriating part was that they weren't even busy. The back dining room was maybe half full, and there wasn't a group at our table--they just didn't have their act together. I honestly just think that they were completely incompetent. Moreover, I'm left standing in the entryway with a huge bunch of pink balloons, wondering why they told me to get there half an hour in the first place.

We started with the oysters, which were a great snack with a cocktail. We followed up with the shared spanish octopus, steak tar tar and the grilled asparagus. All were divine. The octopus melts in your mouth and comes with cut up sweet potato that makes a great cambo. The tar tar was really great and unlike the typical thin slides in a beef carpaccio, the tar-tar is cubed next to grilled toast and a touch of olive oil. For main, I tried the Sunburnt Farm Rainbow Trout. One word..amazing! Thin, crispy skin and soft, white center straight from the grill. Add a touch of olive oil and its pure perfection. The one issue would be the waiter who constantly, the entire evening, kept coming over and interrupting us with this that or another.

Finally after getting a drink at the bar we were seated. I was looking forward to sitting on the other side where I saw heat lamp but we were put on the other side with none. The chairs were uncomfortable and asked to be put at the table next to it with better seats. They moved us no problem. We ordered a bottle of wine octopus with potatoes and chilies appetizer.  The rib-eye steak for 2 and the broccoli rabe side. The waiter who could have been a little nicer or just simply looked like he actually cared told us the steak would take a while and then came back after to tell us that they were sold out of the side. We then got the creamy green side instead. We got the octopus app which was delicious but small. The steak honestly took forever but that was fine. It got colder so we asked to be put inside, which was fine they did it with no problem. Finally the steak came out with the side. The steak was so good! no complaints about that AT ALL. The green creamy side on the other hand tasted good but was cold, I was sad cause if it was hot it probably would taste even better. During this time no one had come up to ask how anything was or anything like that so we were disappointed  that they didn't seem interested in customer satisfaction.

The bar is old school styled, with white washed wood everywhere, Hamptons style, and great perfectly set light fixtures throughout.  It gets busy so you may need some patience. For dinner we started with a meat selection which was superb.  The jamon Iberica was terrific as were the many other varieties of salumis, none of which I can name now. Salumi. Now that's a word that appeals to me. Salami is so pedestrian. SalUmi. Now we're talking. I digress. For dinner we settled on the Rib Eye, which is $70, but feeds two.

Once I cut into my poached egg, looking forward to the yolk oozing out, i found it to have been cooked through and through...not how I pictured an eggs benedict.The reason why I'm STILL giving it 3 stars is because my friend suggested I come back for dinner. Service at dinner was equally slow, but perhaps being with my friends rather than my parents made the experience seem to go faster. The waiter was extraordinarily nice nonetheless. This time, I ordered the Standard Burger, which was quite good. I ordered it medium rare, and it came out medium well but that wasn't that big of a deal. The dessert: the deal closer. OMG, probably the best dessert I've ever eaten. I normally hate sweets, but this was amazing.The drinks were amazing as well.

We sat in the well done main dining room and were greeted with two small bowls; one with four mini-radishes and the other with a generous amount of chunks of parmesan cheese. Shortly after taking our orders for drinks, a brown bag of bread was put on the table. Excited to bite into a warm, soft, filling piece of bread, I was instead surprised by the fact that I could not even bite into this hard and cold mini-baguette. Not too big of a disappointment, but not happy at this point.Then, started with a dozen oysters, six Malpeque, six Wellfleet. The Malpeque, hailing from Prince Edward Island, was the better of the two, with the perfect blend of sweetness and saltiness.Had the Atlantic Swordfish with soy, lime + ginger for my main course. Good size, not too big nor too small. However, I wasn't impressed, rather disappointed with this dish. The brown curry-like sauce was too overpowering for the fish up to the extent where I could barely taste the fish. Also, the sauce had a cumin taste to it, which isn't pleasing to me. Crispy potatoes with paprika aioli, compliments of the kitchen, were brought out alongside the main course. I thought these were great. Fries weren't bad, but weren't great, either. I did try some of the Trout, which I thought was actually pretty good. Simple, light + perfectly grilled.The service was actually very good, however I came at 6 o clock when the place wasn't too busy. The place is also done up very nicely, with four different rooms, each under control of a different manager. Oh and I must add, that tall, long-legged, skinny blonde with bangs hostess @ the front, daaaaaamn.Would I come back? Yes, probably.

The prices are a little much, but comparable to other ""Haute"" Brunch spots. As for the restaurant itself, The LOCATION is LOVELY. Having said that though, there were two parts of my brunch experience here which were rather annoying.  This gorgeous deceptively large Grill is located right below the magnificent High Line park, and can boast it resides in a true corner of old New York.  I was greeted by very pleasant hostesses, and shown to a table outside as I requested.  However, I was not told before I was seated, that the sun in that particular area would be quite intense, so much so the servers have to wear sunglasses.  Although, an awning to shade this area would have been nice, in fact seems quite necessary, the most annoying part of my experience was the service.  Though my waiter was friendly, the service was abysmally slow.  My coffee came after my meal was served.  And when I ordered the second coffee and asked for the check I ended up waiting another 1/2 hour for both.  I then had to wait inside to hand my check to the waiter and hand him the receipt because after waiting 15 more minutes for him to pick it up, I really didn't want my credit card receipt hanging outside on a table unattended to and I needed to leave. Considering that they had quite a few people waiting for a table, and they were quite well staffed, about 1 waiter for every 4-5 tables + busboys and servers, this long wait was really not called for at all.  I WILL GO BACK  to Standard Grill for the food.  But next time I'll sit inside and give myself 2 hours to eat.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

Between us we ordered the cod, swordfish, NY strip steak, burgers and scallop - all of which was excellent and happily topped off by the chocolate brownie, sour cream cheesecake and sorbet for desert.  Despite having so wait 1/2 hour to be seated, the dinner ended on a very high note - thanks to the amazing service, fun Sat eve vibe, and all around excellent meal.  Our friend is leaving NYC but the rest of us will surely be back.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

We were greeted by 3 hostess, whom for such a well known place, were dressed rather revealing even for the Meatpacking District (i work in the area and still say this) 1 of the hostess skirt was actually short enough that went she bent over...I'll elaborate later door other reasons. We had to wait 10 minutes which is fine and we did not mind at all, we got to check out the restaurant which was nice and the layout itself is very appealing as well as the atmosphere. First problem comes. Mind you I did inform the hostess that we were on a date. She sat us roughly 7 feet away from the main entrance the first table directly behind the host stand. The table was in the middle of booths on both sides of us. 1 I believe had 1 person eating by themselves. This is were the extremely short skirt on the hostess comes in. She consistently bent over revealing more than my date and I cared to see, MULTIPLE times. Both of us at, the time we were being seated, informed the hostess that we were not happy with the seat. She acted like she did not hear us and walked away.The waitress, was great. Very knowledgable about the menu. Answered all of our questions. The only thing I did not like is when she asked for drinks she spoke only to my who did not order anything. She walked away. I did infect want a beer, which I had to ask for roughly 15 minutes later when she came back. But please do not get me wrong she looked very busy. She was absolutely great. Kept up on everything, very informative, polite, and despite the first impression was very friendly and over just great. Possibly the best I've ever had. First course we shared the Pork Belly accompanied by a frisee salad with chive and lemon vinaigrette as well as a beautifully poached egg. For Dinner she had the duck and pork chop. The duck was a perfect medium rare served with blood orange. Very good. I had the pork chop served with a spiced rub and an orange, peach, cinnamon chutney. When It arrived I was curious to see why it was plated backwards (bone on the right hand side opposed to left side so it can be cut) I turned it over to see how they burnt the other side (at least 1/4 of it was black which was the side they attempted to make grill marks and forgot about) I was hungry so I just told the waitress everything was fine. We  shared the spiced twice baked potatoes topped with a bell pepper sauce which were good.  The prices were a bit high for the portion size. What appeared to me 5 oz portion of duck breast cost 28 as well as the 1 5 oz (thats including the bone which weighs at least 1 oz) 21.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

Really tasty, nice presentation, good portion size, interesting dishes.The service on the other hand is a mess all the way up to the management.Four of us went on a Saturday night. We had a reservation for 7. We had the nerve to want to sit and catch up before ordering and paid for it with our waiter up our rear ends. We ordered our food and got a few extra apps for the table. The waiter couldn't wait to take away our plates and I had to hold my knife and fork as a sign to back off. So anxious were they to get out our entrees, they forgot mine!!! We had to sit for over 5 minutes while they made my food and our guests food went cold. Classy guys, classy. The waiter blamed the kitchen but I suspect a runner took my food to another table. Maybe they were busy running another table out too.The minute we took our last bites of our entrees, the waiters cleared and had dessert menus in hand.Again, we ordered our choices and then cookies for the table. Well... The waitstaff couldn't handle that either. They brought the check while we still had food on the table.  Then the manager came over to ask us to move to the bar area. Holy cow! Are you kidding me? Have we been here for three hours?? Is this McDonald's? (wait, McDonald's lets you sit and eat your food in peace)This is not a nice dining experience and you truly know, not feel, but know, that they just want your money and want you to get the F out.

First with the seating, we waited 30 minutes and the booth was laid out for us and then the hostess said wait these people (who were at the next table) have been waiting for the booth. They were already seated at the table - it was clear they asked for the booth and looked like bigger tippers. So be it I made a fuss and we sat at the booth. Also, the bar was overpacked during the wait. So we wait a long time for the server and order food and wine. Fine. The menu looks inventive an interesting and the wine was good. Service is verrrrry slow from here and we have a hard time getting the waiters attention. Speaking of, none of them smiled or responded when you said thank you. Just rude. Then finally halfway through the meal not seeing the waiter he comes and asks how is everything? to which one of my friends answers honestly ""I haven't seen you in an hour."" and the waiter snaps back ""You haven't even been here for an hour."" You asked, we answered. On top, why ask if you don't care? Just purely terrible service for a nice place. He walks off huffily and waiters change. I think as a whole group we left perhaps a 10% tip and I'm wondering if that was too generous. Kind of a self fulfilling prophecy - treat us like bad tippers and we will be. Also, they never brought bread. So enough on shit service. There were other little details which were insulting but its irrelevant. Just know it was bad. Moving onAmbiance: Trendy crowd some old some young lots of int'l. The bar was overpacked we couldn't reach it when we were waiting. Decor is traditional nothing special. The acoustics were awful - I understand noisy places but there are structural changes an architect can make to make it that you can hear someone one foot away.Food: Burger - average. Cod, really quite good. 4 stars. Potato duck fat whatever. Gross. My fava bean falafel - interesting concept but fell short of good. Really nothing special. Long story short, AVOID.

Mediocre at best--  dry (even though I asked for it medium rare) and flavorless. Even more upsetting were the overly salty fries.

The back room is a lot warmer in tone and the light level mimics magic hour at all times.

From Miami to LA to New York I have found that the menus are appetizing and I leave satisfied everytime. They may not push very many culinary boundaries but you have to realize, this is a restaurant attached to a hotel, I mean what do you want to eat when you've been traveling? something fresh, and tasty without surprises. I know I can always come here to get a great burger, piece of fish, oysters, salad, veggie sides and desserts.

Whenever I talk to anyone about the Grill somehow this drink gets mentioned. Also, if you're not in a boozy mood (or pregnant) they have very thoughtful unspiked drinks so just 'cuz you don't knock-em-back doesn't mean you shouldn't peruse the drink list. and yes, sometimes the service is off and yes, sometimes people are hired because they're more beautiful than their skills but in the end when you're full up on great cocktails, good food and conversation with a friend or stranger who cares?

942,pKA94qM-DNtXTM-uRHC5zw,Lindsay F.,3.0 star rating,"What's the space like? Traditional Parisian brasserie meets trendy Manhattan Meatpacking District meets old-fashioned dining car (train); think: Subway-tiled ceilings, picture-windows framed in iron, a uniquely stunning penny-tiled dining room floor, cherry-red booth seating, and a separate bar area and outdoor-dining space.How was the service? Horrifying.  Simply horrendous.  Had I been paying for dinner (a friend treated me for my birthday), I would have thrown a fit.  Biting my tongue on Phil's behalf was hard enough, and I didn't want to further embarrass/cause a scene.  Before I give you a service snapshot, please note that I have worked in every aspect of a restaurant and consider myself to be a fair guest.  However, I have zero-tolerance for being ignored or treated like crap.  I know what you're thinking: ""Could the service have stunk because The Standard Grill recently opened?  Perhaps they're still working out the kinks.""  Nope, bullshit. Restaurant employees who aren't personable or nurturing should not be in the hospitality industry; rather, they should find work at a telemarketing call center or the DMV.  Want a couple of examples?  Here goes:* We did not receive water for 10-minutes after being seated. (Note that Sunday's temperature was in the 90-degree range.)  The only reason our glasses were finally filled was because I was able to flag down another waiter...Who glared at us before approaching the manager (like a tattle-tailing school boy) and whined, ""Who has that table over there?  I don't have time to take another one.  Ugh!!""  Seriously, guy?  Why don't you bitch a little louder?  * The Standard Grill has a great concept: Divide the restaurant in to sections with a manager overseeing each one.  Well, this is a prime example where actions speak louder than words.  All three of the managers I saw were too busy sucking in their cheeks, checking themselves out, and playing ""who has the best tunnel vision?""  Never did I see one of them approach a table, or lift a finger to help fill water glasses, refresh bread baskets, etc.* Thank God for the bus boys!  They were more nurturing and responsive than management and wait staff combined!* While our waiter wasn't a mean fellow, he was aloof and simply not suited to work front-of-house.  The bloke was drenched in perspiration and I was fearful that one of his sweat beads would find its way in to my food/water.      Did you drink? Not alcohol!  I was nursing a gnarly hangover from the night before.  I did, however, have two Shirley Temple's. How was the food?Actually, my meal was delicious!  The menu at The Standard Grill could best be described as ""American Brasserie"" fare.  From charcuterie and a raw bar, to fresh fish, pasta and meat, there is truly something on this menu for everyone.  Upon being seated, two small dishes arrive: One containing magenta-colored mini radishes, and the other filled with ample hunks of parmesan cheese.  How delightful, unique and sophisticated!  A lovely bread basket follows shortly thereafter.* Saucisson Sec Basquaise: Having fallen in love with this dry Lyonnaise sausage in France, I was thrilled to see it offered on the restaurant's charcuterie menu.  I ate three of the five generous slices, leaving my date with two (sorry Phil!).  The pork sausage was perfectly rich, dense, and subtly spicy.  Tres delicieux!* Iceberg Wedge: I'm not exactly sure when I began to like blue cheese, but I can tell you that it was fairly recently.  Perhaps it was the menu's description that included ""Kentucky bacon,"" that prompted me to order the iceberg wedge as a starter.  Floating atop a shallow pool of blue cheese dressing was  1/2 of a head of iceberg lettuce cut in to four equal parts.  Sliced bacon strips and a thin drizzle of dressing crowned the greens.      * Standard Ranch Burger: By the time we received our entrees, I was legitimately full...But that never seems to stop me.  A plump, juicy, medium-rare beef patty came topped with gooey melted white cheddar and strips of salty bacon.  A fluffy brioche bun sandwiched the trinity of savory ingredients.  Accompaniments included a whole pickle, sliced onion/tomato/lettuce, and a 16-ounce (approximately) cup filled with the crispiest, saltiest, most delicious homemade frites in town.  * Chocolate Mousse: In honor of celebrating my (belated) birthday, Phil and I had the perfect excuse to order dessert!  Having been to the restaurant once before, he insisted that we order the chocolate mousse.  We were presented with a large glass bowl nearly filled to the brim with chocolate mousse, a dollop of homemade whipped cream, and crunchy chocolate shavings...In addition to two wooden ""Le Creuset"" rubber spatulas!  Will you return to The Standard Grill? Ugh, this is a very tough call, but I do think I will return.  Should my second service experience be as miserable as the first, then I will feel confident about never returning.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

944,ER6UWIV7QajkjZuwgJQeew,Rick S.,4.0 star rating,"I dined at the Standard Grill on the 4th of July weekend. It was a pleasant experience. We sat outdoors in the early evening, the weather was pleasant. Prior to this we were indoor at the bar area, having mojitos. I found the mojito to be a little sweet, but I informed them and they added soda (and more liquor ;)).The place had a very comfortable feel to it, not overwhelming. The bar area emphasizes ""white"", but the interior dining is more ""restaurant - like"" brownish - both were quite nice in their own way. For starters, we had the chicken liver pate, the sopressata and the haricot verts salad. The chicken liver pate was ok, not great. I was expecting something along the lines of what BLT Prime serves, and it was nowhere close, but it nevertheless was quite rich. The sopressata was pretty decent. The haricot verts salad was outstanding, as if the ingredients were freshly plucked from an outdoor garden off the highline. For entrees, we had the rib eye steak for 2, and the sweet pea ravioli. I didn't try the ravioli myself, the portion was not huge, but I was informed it was quite tasty and sufficient for 1 person. The rib eye was perfect for 2 people, not oversized like some steakhouses offer. It was succulent, with a nice char on the outside and a bit of sea salt. We got A1 on the side (nice - some places get offended these days if you ask for A1). Overall it was outstanding. It came with some frites, which we didn't realize and we had also ordered the duck fat smashed potatoes. On top of that, on the house they gave us potatoes with an aioli dressing. Too many potatoes. We also ordered the asparagus on the side.

I tried to make a reservation for the first night a normal time was available but was told they only take reservations exactly 2 weeks in advance. OK-I called on a Friday to make a res for 2 weeks from now on Saturday. I was told they only take reservations starting exactly 2 weeks in advance and would be starting at 9am on Saturday morning. OK-got up early on Saturday morning and called. I got the repeating message that someone would be with me soon and stayed on the line for a half-hour then assumed that there was no one there yet. I called back at 10am and now was told they could only make a reservation for 5:30 or 10:30.It shouldn't be a full time job to make a restaurant reservation.There is no meal on the plant worth this kind of aggravation.

We started with the charred octopus and sweet potato appetizer, which was outstanding--such great charred flavor, and another half-dozen Blue Point oysters.I had the New York Strip steak served with a few duck fat smashed potatoes--this is one of the best entrees I've had in a long while.  The steak had amazing flavor, was cooked a perfect medium-rare, and the duck fat gave the potatoes great flavor as well.  We ordered the crispy paprika potatoes as a shared side, but I much preferred the duck fat potatoes as a starch.       I had the cheesecake for dessert, which was really great--the crust was super-crunchy and the cake was executed very well: firm but moist.All in all, amazing food, great service, and nice atmosphere.  My expectations were certainly met and exceeded.  And they should have been--our bill was $300.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

So we put out names down and headed for the bar. The bloody Marys were delish as were the oysters. As soon as the oysters came out, our table was ready (was right about the wait, only 20 min). The staff was great and the food was good too. I had the eggs Florentine; forget what my friend had but my dish was better. Overall a great brunch spot and not pricey at all.

Went in for a nice lazy lunch (I just want to be a lady who lunches...).  Shared everything with my friend and, boy, did we eat. I had the cauliflower soup (with poached egg, slivered almonds and caviar) and thought they actually got some great flavor out of what can be an otherwise boring soup.  My friend had the haricot vert salad, and it was wodnerful and light.  We then shared the BLT Club (great tomato salsa / tapenade instead of tomatoes) and the Brisket Sandwich (so tender, great flavor, loved the spicy cole slaw).  Finished with the mousse for two, at which we couldn't stop laughing due to it being served with two spatulas...just call us fat, we get it.  Service: I suppose there's many workers with many roles.  I think I counted four different people during the meal.  Even the manager came over to check on us and refill water at one point.  I'd heard bad things about the wait staff, but was pleasantly surprised by our waitress.  She was friendly, offered food advice, and was there when we needed her.  The host staff however, seemed that we were just unwanted passerbys; don't get worked up if someone simply asks if two rooms that are decorated in different manners are different restaurants...Extra points: I love cool decor.  The floor is made of inlaid pennies (at least we know how much they paid per square foot), the space looks like it's been there for decades and is wonderfully cozy, and the bathroom (easy to navigate when you finally notice the male/female roman medallions in the floor) is quite nice and spartan with the coolest hand dryer ever.",The Standard Grill,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (Traditional),, Lounges,, Diners"

We were also given potatoes with paprika aioli sauce; delish!One of my friends had the Lobster Luis, which she said was good.  My other friend had the burger and said it was excellent.  The presentation of the burger was also very cool.  We ordered the duck fat smashed potatoes and those were good as well, we were just overloaded with food.For dessert we had ""the deal breaker,"" which was one of the most delicious desserts ever (if you like chocolate).  It's chocolate mousse with some kind of brownie-ish batter at the bottom.  It's served in a glass mixing bowl and you eat it with spatulas.  Very cool!I highly recommend a dinner here.  We got there around 6 and it got very busy around 7pm.  Great atmosphere with a wonderful staff.  Oh - and the bathrooms downstairs are interesting!!

We did a combination of cheese and meat first, all very good.  Next, we shared the dried aged rib eye...amazing!  Cook to the perfect and seasoned just right.

Given that I've worked in the NYC restaurant industry for 13 years now and understand the nature of the beast and am usually very forgiving when it comes to rating the service of an establishment, I really couldn't overlook this one. We never got bread, the server never checked on us once we got our meals, we sat with empty plates for a good 10 minutes, with our cutlery parallel indicating we were finished, before anyone cleared our plates. We had to flag our server down to order dessert, coffee, ect. Our dessert initially went to the wrong table next to us, even though they were eating their entrees and we were clearly set up for dessert with dessert cutlery. Then there was a miscommunication between servers and a second of the same dessert was brought us because the server we had initially ordered dessert from didn't tell our designated server that she had ordered the first dessert for us, and/or our designated server didn't understand when I told her we had already ordered from the other server.

My friend ordered eggs benedict and when they served it, the hollandaise sauce had already solidified. She should have sent them back but didn't want to keep waiting. I ordered the baked eggs with tomatoes, sausage and chickpeas. Not tasty AT ALL. Especially when I saw the dish and recognized it as Shakshuka, something I've had at Israeli restaurants in the city, where it was a very flavorful dish. Not so at the Standard. The tomato sauce just did not taste fresh, more like Ragu. The sausage, no flavor. Same for the chickpeas. It makes me angry because if you have a restaurant, especially a high end one, how hard is it really to know that hollandaise sauce should not be allowed to dry? That tomatoes, sausage and chickpeas are supposed to succulent flavors. Seriously, there was no unami in the stupid tomato sauce they gave me, how does one take the unami out of tomatoes??????????? Anyway, the GREAT part about the restaurant was the HighLine punch.
