The pizza is great (especially with the fresh ingredients, homemade peppers, and burrata), but the real highlight is their Sunday Dinner Seatings. They do a few times each Sunday, the multi-course menu changes each week, and ranges across all your Italian-grandmother-favorites (manicotti, Sunday gravy, etc.) Everything we were served was fantastic, and Chris and Mario make the whole experience top notch. :)Favorite new place in Hoboken!",Tenth Street Pasta & Pizza,3.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"

I was excited to see what the fuss was all about as I've been a loyalist to Johnny Pepperoni. But this was a delight... on this wintry mix of a night I decided to bite the bullet and cheat on JP. Boy was this affair worth it (no one should cheat but when you do it with a better pizza, it's ok).  I was pleasantly surprised in the price and size of the small... It was the best 12 inches that have ever entered my mouth. The sauce, great... the cheese, great...the crunch of the crust, crunchy delight. I totally recommend this place when jonesing for that triangular hot treat. I did a simple pick up and stuff my shameless face at home but I think I would like to go back and try something table-side next. Welcome to the neighborhood.I will say Chris Manzo seemed a little short and just ready to have me be out of his sight... all I asked was if the place was BYOB and he answered with a simple short yes.

We were a large party but the owner Mario was kind enough to accommodate. The menu is very limited- salads, antipasto plate, burrata, ricotta toast and pizza.

It was cooked properly the crust had a good texture.The problem laid in the taste. The tomato sauce is extremely bland and flavorless.

They served sandwiches and slices and wouldn't say they set themselves apart from the many Hoboken pizza places. But the place is up and running now and the pizza is delicious. The square buffala pie is a signature dish. Get whatever topping you like. Went with mushrooms and their homemade peppers. The key is to get the homemade spicy olive oil on the side.

12,cMYGdUk5F72l43Jm88boeg,Tony L.,5.0 star rating,"My wife and I were headed over to Hoboken for the afternoon.  We were craving a good pie so I searched/reviewed on Yelp and Tenth Street Pizza, although there were only 11, had the best reviews of the bunch.  It's not located on the main drag (Washington St.), but a few blocks away, which is nice.  We arrived just after 4 pm and were the first customers of the day.  We were promptly greeted by Chris(one of three owners) and we selected our table next to the window.  Chris went over the menu items and he asked if he could put our beer in the fridge for the time being, as we hadbrought our own.  I had read it was byob so we made a stop at the local craft beer shop nearby.  Tenth Street serves two types of pizza, a New York style round with thin crust or a square pizza that has a bit of a thicker crust. We opted for the square with half pepperoni and the other half with peppers, pepperoni and sausage.  It took about 20 mins for our pizza to be ready as everything is made from scratch.  It was well worth it!!  During our wait we talked with owners Chris, Mario and Urbano about their new restaurant.  It's only been there less than 3 mos.  Our pizza arrived and it looked great and tasted even better.  They also serve a side of their signature oil to drizzle over your pizza if you so desire.  It is good so I'd recommend trying a bit on your pizza.  My wife and I must have stayed there 2 hours during which time local first timers came in and raved about how good the pizza tasted.  Thx to Chris, Mario and Urbano for the great hospitality and for serving up some amazing pizza.  We didn't want to leave, but we will definitely stop in on our next trip to Hoboken.  Tips: **They do accept credit cards unlike some spots that are cash only. **BYOB - which we kinda like as we are really into craft beer. **Come hungry.  Even the small pizza is fairly large.",Tenth Street Pasta & Pizza,3.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"

The crust is thin, crispy and divine (I usually leave the edges uneaten -- not these). They get the Margherita right: cheese is excellent and in the right quantity. No extra grease anywhere. All of the toppings (we chose Margherita base plus pepperoni, mushrooms, hot peppers) were of the highest quality. (Mushrooms, however, can be of a more interesting variety).

I am very much looking forward to making this my new pizza staple---it is a must try!",Tenth Street Pasta & Pizza,3.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"

The owner Mario was our server and he is not only friendly and knowledgeable but took amazing care of us and all other tables that came in. We got the square pie with half pepperoni and arugula and half plain. The tomato sauce was incredibly fresh tasting, parm shaved on top table side and garlic chili oil to put on top. Seriously amazing pizza unlike any other in Hoboken. Byob and cash only.",Tenth Street Pasta & Pizza,3.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"

My kids even said ""yum, this is awesome"" after the 1st bite and they've had my mother's homemade pizza many times. You can taste all the high quality ingredients and homemade recipe. We had the plain pizza and will be sure to go back for the square pie (their speciality). Our pizza had a wonderful crisp, thin crust, fresh parmesan and basil. Also loved the garlic/oil/pepper dressing that came with it!!!

52,AWYi5haDX1Gb0osz9Wtsjg,Emily K.,1.0 star rating,"There are too many places in Hoboken to order pizza to accept bad service and pizza. The first time we ordered take out and picked it up ourselves it was fantastic. The second time we ordered delivery. Not only was the pizza burnt to a crisp the driver dropped the pizza and flipped the box. Absolutely no apology or refund was offered. Tonight I called and was going to pick it up myself. The rude girl asked me to repeat every single thing I said and then when she finally had my order refused to tell me how long until I could come pick up my order. I was told very rudely  ""we'll call you when it is ready."" The best she could do was ""at least 30 minutes."" I am done. I'll stick with Rosarios down the street where they know my voice, order and phone number as soon as they answer.

54,t21CSUeA0tDJvKX2CllvYg,Emily B.,3.0 star rating,"The pizza was a bit overpriced for what I've seen in Hoboken ($30 for their square pie and no toppings). Also, we had only 3 choices for an appetizer and only two choices for pizza. This would be fine for a casual bite but there are better pizza places around (ex. Johnny pepperoni and Grimaldi's). Would eat again as takeout but would not sit down as service took a very long time.",Tenth Street Pasta & Pizza,3.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"
55,4K7HarkhtyE07M6CKuwKmw,Ashley G.,2.0 star rating,"We had a terrible experience here. After waiting over an hour for a table (which we were totally understanding about as it is a very small restaurant) the three of us were seated at a table that was clearly only meant for two. We ordered appetizers which were good but not amazing. We then had to wait for one of the owners to come over so we could let him know we hadn't ordered pizza yet (to which he replied, ""really?""). After ordering we waited another good hour or so as everyone around us had gotten their food and tables were turning over. After complaining to one of the waiters that they had clearly forgotten our food he didn't apologize and kept insisting it was coming (which was exactly what he had said twenty minutes prior). The pizza came and was cold and just ok. They never offered an apology or took anything off the bill. We were completely shocked as this place had gotten great reviews. We won't be returning.",Tenth Street Pasta & Pizza,3.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"
56,dZ77Vlt2uY5ApHUeRqwfTw,Hugh W.,5.0 star rating,"Finally, the perfect pie in Hoboken! And we are lucky enough to live a block away. The boys from 10th and Willow have opened a little pizza joint across the street and it is amaze-balls. They are using their grandmothers recipes (they say they ate this pizza all the time growing up) and the history shows. It has only been open a short time, a sort of soft open, so the menu is limited, they will be adding more later, but what they have is incredible. We had the square pie and loved it. The dough and sauce compliment each other perfectly. The toppings were fresh, generous, and authentic. A nice greek salad was the perfect addition. The service is prompt and friendly. It is BYOB, which is another strong plus. I can't recommend it enough and will regret it when it becomes so popular I can't push my way through the door.",Tenth Street Pasta & Pizza,3.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"

59,mzGgk_y_3juq-aY08vmp6w,Bjorn P.,4.0 star rating,Ordered on New Year's Eve and was very happy. The pizza was delivered on time. The person I spoke to on the phone was very friendly and helpful in describing their square and circle pizzas. We ended up ordering hot pepper and sausage on a large round pizza. It was great and we'll be ordering again. I'm not yet sure it's the best in Hoboken yet - I still love me some Dozzinos and certain pies from Tony Baloneys but this is better than Napoli's and Grimaldi's in my view. One thing I would like to see is some creativity in pizza delivery packaging. The standard box and warmer are fine but they don't keep the pizza hot enough. Dominos has a pretty good system and I believe their boxes are somehow insulated but would be nice to figure out a way to keep delivery food hotter given how popular delivery is these days. Anyway - I'm on a soap box and it's not just for this place to resolve. End conclusion - this is very good pizza.,Tenth Street Pasta & Pizza,3.5 star rating,$,"Pizza,, Italian"
