We ordered 3 gyro sandwiches which were delicious, even my husband liked them and he is hard to please when to comes to Greek food!The spinach pies were still warm and crispy not soggy at all, my mother and I thought it was fantastic! My mom got the Lemmon soup which she said was delicious and the FF were really good too!!Also would like to mention delivery was sent in a reasonable time (about an hour) for a Sunday night in Hoboken which is not bad but the impressive part was that everything was still hot and NOT soggy!! Well, FF were soggy but it's almost impossible to keep them crunchy when your getting delivery, I expected that and was totally fine with it! This is the first time I'm ordering from them which is why I only gave 4 starts but if we keep getting service like this we I will def increase to 5 stars!!",Greektown,4.0 star rating,$$,"Greek,, Salad"

Ordered gyro sandwich and sautéed broccoli side and wife ordered Greek salad. My sandwich was very blah and the broccoli was so under cooked, couldn't eat it. They also didn't provide any tzatziki sauce side. Only giving it 2 stars because wife said her salad was decent.It's Greek to Me is def better and they give you extra tzatziki sauce for free and their sauce/meat tastes way better.Will not be ordering from here again.",Greektown,4.0 star rating,$$,"Greek,, Salad"

It looks like they have cut it from the circular mound of meat and let it sit out. The tzatziki is ok but nothing special. It has a lot of garlic in it.  The chicken gyro was better but still not up to par with some of the better greek food i have had.We also ordered the greek salad which was not bad.  I tried this place on 2 occasions and both were below par.

They usually do takeout, but we decided to sit to get out of the office for a bit. The space is really open, bright & clean-- with huge windows. There's some outdoor seating, but we took advantage of the A/C. The lunch special is awesome. I got a Greek salad with grilled chicken for $8.95, my friend ordered the salmon (and absolutely loved it), and my other friend ordered the chicken pita. My salad was a really good size for a lunch portion, but didn't have olives and had very limited chicken & feta. I really liked the dressing. It was a very light greek dressing. The salad also came with a side of pita and I asked for a small side of tzaziki, which the waitress gladly brought over for me. I would definitely come back for lunch, but I would probably order something else next time (unless I was trying to be healthy, like today). The service was pretty slow.

It came it hummus, spicy feta dip, tzatziki sauce, eggplant dip, grape leaves and beets, and it was served with so much warm pita. I loved our waiter, too. He was so attentive and sweet. It's BYOB and prices are fair. I will definitely be back!",Greektown,4.0 star rating,$$,"Greek,, Salad"
43,_3KlXVIhrKd-LNFZ1dnc7g,Shane B.,2.0 star rating,Let's me just say this would easily be a 4 or 5 star review except for 2 things. The first being I believe a lot of the menu is over priced. I got a yeero pita and fries and it was nearly $10 after tax when in my opinion based the amount of food and what it is should be closer to $7. I also ordered online and there should have been no confusion but they forgot the fries so all I got was the yeero which was delicious and had plenty of meat which is a plus. But a yeero and fries isn't worth $10. Not to mention they forgot the fries.,Greektown,4.0 star rating,$$,"Greek,, Salad"
44,8UwZi3BwC74MJrUS24iP0w,Adam D.,2.0 star rating,"My buddy said he was having dinner here. I was feeling Greek too, but after seeing this place listed as a ""hot new business"" on Yelp having only been open for three months, that solidified my plans to join.My first impression is that the place is very casual and affordable. The most expensive thing on the menu is $24 (lamb chops). BYOB is also a plus. I can only speak for the lamb pita platter, which was quite filling for $17. They give you a choice of gyro or kebab. I opted for the gyro, but was pretty disappointed when the meat was served to me chopped rather than shaved. I've never had a gyro with such thick chunks of meat. If I had wanted thick chunks of meat, I would have ordered the kebab. To add insult to injury, the meat was cold. As for the side option (fries or rice), I saw the fries were in all likelihood frozen so I opted for the rice, which turned out to be perfectly cooked and delicious.The tzatziki sauce, which I also can't speak for, is probably a bit too garlicky. My buddy kept popping gum all night. The night we went here, it was 100 degrees outside. Inside the restaurant, it might have been 99. This was evident by the fact that our ice bucket for our wine caused flooding reminiscent of that from Hurricane Sandy, which brings me to the service ...Either our waitress was having a really bad day or else she needs a new profession. I have never encountered a more unenthusiastic person whose income is dependent on tips. I'm still scratching my head over how it took so long for my table of 3 people to get served when there were only a handful of other people in the restaurant besides us. We must have waited 30 minutes for our food, so I'm guessing she either forgot to place the order or else the kitchen was having an equally bad day as our server. When my cold lamb finally was ready, there was absolutely no sense of urgency in delivering it to the table, nor was she the least bit apologetic.For the amount of Greek options in the area, I can't imagine Greek Town will be in town for too long if they don't get it together.",Greektown,4.0 star rating,$$,"Greek,, Salad"

Michael, the owner, was extremely helpful and accommodating. He helped me put together a menu of family style appetizers and sides and gave each of my guests the option of choosing their own entree from a small selection. For apps they prepared a variety of dips for us, as well as Haloumi and Greek salad (one of the reasons why my Boyfriend and I regulars). For entrees my guests chose from either a Yeero, Greek burger or grilled chicken pita (almost everyone went for the Yeero). And for sides we had fries, rice (so good!) and vegetables. All of my guests loved the food and couldn't stop raving about how delicious it was! Our server, Aveda (hopefully I am spelling that correctly) was super attentive (as always) and made sure everything was going great the whole time.

But pretty much everything about our experience a couple of months ago was terrible and I don't want others to waste their money. We tried this place because of the overwhelmingly positive Yelp reviews. But of the 3 things we ordered, only one (the octopus app) could even be called mediocre (and that would be generous). I got the Shrimp Santorini and it was just awful, especially because instead of shrimp, they gave me chicken; note that there is no version of the dish with chicken on the menu. The accompanying orzo was super mushy and the whole dish was totally bland -- worse than cafeteria food. I don't think I've ever sent food back, but the chicken error was egregious enough that I did this time. The waiter eventually came back with a plate that had shrimp on it, but also still had quite a few pieces of chicken. When he finally came back near the end of the meal, I complained about the dish again, noting all the chicken that had been left behind. He did not offer to take the $21 item off the bill and I didn't want to be a jerk so I didn't demand it. But we certainly put them on notice that we were not happy customers.

However, at $8-9 a gyro (no fries, rice etc.) , it's on the expensive side for fast casual. I would totally pay that price if there was fries, rice, or a small salad on the side (or a combination of those) to make for a more filling meal.

Also, let me preface that I would return to eat here.  We sat outside & were immediately greeted by our waiter. He quickly asked if we wanted anything to drink & if we were ready to order (literally sat down for maybe 45 seconds). He came back a minute later (I'm not exaggerating) & then again a minute later. We still weren't ready to order. Then it took 10 mins for him to come back. Food took about 40 mins to come out, and our waiter was very apologetic about that. I think this is a great takeout place, but not a date spot or the best Greek food in Hoboken. IT DEFINITELY HAS POTENTIAL!",Greektown,4.0 star rating,$$,"Greek,, Salad"
91,oRaAsZbiMxDTGdax23qF5g,Ken C.,5.0 star rating,"Fantastic! Stopped by with the fiance for dinner and it was delicious. Started with the cold sampler which I highly recommend, the tzatiki, hummus and eggplant in particular stood out. Seemed small but by the end we were nearly stuffed, could comfortably be an appetizer for four. As our entree I had the yeero patter and she had the chicken platter. Yeero was perfectly seasoned and the accompanying rice was perfect. Her chicken was perfectly cooked, juicy and tender with a nice touch of lemon.Will definitely be a regular!",Greektown,4.0 star rating,$$,"Greek,, Salad"

I typically get the Greek salad with grilled chicken or salmon and it's delicious. I've had the shrimp before but I wouldn't recommend the shrimp- they tasted a bit rubbery.

After seeing so many business in & out of this location, Greektown finally arrives and it's clear it will stay here. Every dish on this menu is satisfying, and most tend to be pretty healthy as well. My husband is from the Mediterranean & now refuses to eat regional cuisine unless it's from here. The crispy stuffed chicken is a must have.

The food and service are both very good- the crispy stuffed chicken is especially good  (and has dill which I LOVE). There is outdoor seating for the nice weather days. The bonus is that they play good greek music inside (please never change this). They don't have Greek coffee at the moment but I was told that in the future they will  (and I can't wait!) .

While the restaurant still has some work to do, I will attribute the hiccups to being only a week old. For takeout, we ordered the lentil soup (excellent), Greek salad with shrimp, and the grilled chicken platter. The grilled chicken platter came with a decent sized Greek salad, tzatziki  and fries (although I had ordered the rice). The grilled chicken was flavorful and juicy, and the Greek salad was balanced and tasty.  Compared to similar Greek restaurants, the prices are a bit steep. I was also surprised that they don't offer any dessert (who doesn't love baklava with their meal?). But I give this restaurant 4 stars because I can't argue with *very* good food!  I think with some price adjustments, Greek Town has the potential to do really well! Or at least, I am hopeful...",Greektown,4.0 star rating,$$,"Greek,, Salad"

111,tHOFvwAqHHhCedtkunj4HQ,Richard F.,4.0 star rating,"Very happy to have a nice Greek spot in our neighborhood! We sat outside on a Sunday night, and our serve Mike was very attentive and friendly. We had the cold appetizer platter that can be seen in the photos, then split the seafood platter and yeero platter. The food came out REALLY fast, while still having a nice presentation.  Some standouts: In the appetizer platter, the spicy feta was really great, as were the stuffed leaves and dense tzatziki. The octopus was very tender and juicy, with a wonderful smokiness. Mike pointed out that the lamb is fresh and not frozen, and it was definitely delicious. Portions were VERY ample, so feel free to share. Our bill came to $55 for the cold appetizer combo, seafood platter, and gyro platter. They were out of the cheese appetizer we wanted, as well as the lamb skewer, so that was a bit of a disappointment. That said, it was a Sunday evening (Fathers day), and if that's all they're out of, they're doing pretty well. We'll be back for the stuff we missed, and we'll try delivery once it's available (it will be a few weeks as of this review).This is a delicious, friendly and welcome addition to the neighborhood!",Greektown,4.0 star rating,$$,"Greek,, Salad"
112,TLsZyUebTOVE9D4bPB9Ifg,Michael V.,2.0 star rating,"I'm giving this review two stars instead of one only because the waitress was kind after I called attention to the fact that the chicken in the gyro was raw and undercooked.  She apologetically explained that it had never happened before and offered me anything else free of charge; however, after having partially eaten chicken that wasn't cooked properly, I just couldn't think about eating.  Chicken, unlike other meats or fish, should never be served undercooked to a customer.  We came here excited to try something different in downtown Hoboken and left wondering whether I'd get sick.  If you eat here, check your food carefully.",Greektown,4.0 star rating,$$,"Greek,, Salad"

118,LpRPlSZ-lUKKuT5b2I_sQg,Catherine F.,1.0 star rating,"On Friday night, three of us decided to try this place, as we were all Ina mood for Greek food. It was boiling hot inside, this is an open kitchen/restaurant concept, which made the place look really tacky and cheap. It's seemed that their AC was not working at all! We felt we might have as well been outside! Nonetheless, we still decided to stay and try the food. The prices are very affordable(on a cheap side), which makes me alway doubt the quality. If the owner buys good quality food how can he sell it with such a low prices, unless they frozen Junk, and add MSG to enhance the flavor! I've decided to try their shrimp Santorini, which was a fake version of the real shrimp Santorini. The original dish is baked in the oven with feta, and without spinach. Yeero platter was awful, the taste didn't resemble the meat. Maybe the meat was left years and years in the freezer, before being bought and cooked. On top of that it was brought to us cold! Their  so called ""Greek Fries"" tasted worse than Mac Donald's. None of the servers were pleasant nor smiling. No greeting at the table and no apology for keeping us wait from drinks, food, to paying our check. She was unable to answer any of our questions. Even though the restaurant was not busy, none of the servers offers us anything to drink besides asking us if we want tap water. We had to ask if they have soft drinks/juices(this is BYO). The waitress was holding our glasses by the rim, which were all dirty of fingertips, and it made us feel disgusted to drink anything here! She was not the only one doing that, the others were doing exactly the same. It's was obvious to us that none of these girls have ever worked in the restaurant industry, before getting a job here. With so many great choices of Greek food in the area, we will definitely not be coming back here. In reply to the owner:If you wanted to make the same restaurant concept as in Greece, it is a great tale for someone who has never been to Greece.  However, I've been, and none of it resembles Greece. Not the open kitchen/restaurant concept nor the food. Your yeero has nothing to do with the taste of yeero I've had in Greece! It tastes like it's been frozen for many years(ready made cones of meat).  I don't know about not using MSG as you say, as one of you waiters said that you do use it on everything, because it tastes better. Who is interested to look at the cleanliness of your kitchen, when your staff is walking around with dirty shirts and aprons, sweaty, with bad odor?! Please don't tell me that the same waiters also work in Greece. Don't attack customers, but rather work on the issues brought to your attention, and  find the ways to improve your restaurant and food/staff quality.",Greektown,4.0 star rating,$$,"Greek,, Salad"
