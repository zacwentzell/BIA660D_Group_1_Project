The inside is bright, spacious and modern which provides a nice break from all those dimly-lit-for-no-reason restaurants. The staff are down to earth, extremely friendly, very knowledgable about the food and wine list and actually go out of their way to converse with their tables. I have actually left everything from my phone, my wallet, my AirPods to my umbrella at my table all on separate occasions and each time its been waiting for me at the hostess desk when I realize sometimes hours or days later.Although I eat here at least twice a month, this review is based off my most recent visit. I was here on a Saturday with my boyfriend after we both realized we should just cut our losses for the day and go somewhere to get drunk. Del Friscos was happy to help us with that. We sat at the bar and ordered the Philly Cheesesteak Egg Rolls along with two bottles of wine.We ended up sitting for hours watching the cruise ships go by and talking to the bartender the whole time. The place was never empty while we were there and we ended up having a great time. When we realized the dinner rush was starting and our speech was slurring we decided it was probably best to head home. On all the occasions I have been here I have never had a bad experience.

There are a variety of choices (salads, burgers, grilled fish options, etc) and everything I've tried is good. It's a pretty busy spot, so I wouldn't risk going without a reservation. One thing I will say is that the appetizers (like the Ahi Tacos, deviled eggs... yum) are more memorable than the entrees. I prefer to come here for drinks and a few appetizers rather than a full meal. Try to get seated near a window -- Del Frisco's is on the water so you'll have a great view of NYC while you eat!UPDATE: Feel like I need to bump up my rating from four stars to five after the exceptional service I had at Del Frisco's last night. Our waiter (Andrew) was awesome! He gave us a great wine recommendation, let us move to a booth, and even brought out a complimentary side after we mentioned that we had never tried the Truffled Mac and Cheese before!

Our table was ready immediately and although on Open Table I requested a window seat, we didn't get that. After arriving at our table, it took no more than 5 minutes for our waiter to come over, greet us and ask what we would like to drink. TALK ABOUT GOOD SERVICE. I ordered the sangria with a popsicle and the hubs a beer. All was fine with drinks that we decided to order another after we were finished. For our entrees, we both got burgers. I know, who comes to a prominent steakhouse and orders a burger, but let me tell ya, those burgers were on the money. I opted for the classic burger with potato fries while my fiance went with the filet mignon burger. Both burgers were equally delicious. Juicy, tender and cooked to perfection.

13,Vr94oCgVobXtkrRkg1i3PQ,Jane Y.,3.0 star rating,"There are just some ""chain"" restaurants that know how to provide a good overall experience for their diners - Del Frisco's Grille is one of them.  My sister and I went for an unplanned girls night out and we were told that a table for two on a Friday night would be a 30 minute wait.  Not bad, so we gave our number to the hostess and walked across the street to wait by the water.  Unfortunately, after 40 minutes we weren't given a call, so we walked back to the restaurant to inquire about the status of our table.  The hostess who had taken our name down didn't know what to do, so the hostess to her right searched for our name in the system and that's when we were told that a table was just getting cleaned and that they would seat us at that table once ready.  So about 5 minutes later we were seated.  Total wait time - 45 minutes.We were seated in one of the booths by the kitchen, and to start our evening, my sister had a glass of rose and I had the sangria.  The sangria came with an ice pop, and the ice pop had fruit frozen into it that were released as the ice pop melted into the drink.  Unfortunately, I had ordered the sangria thinking that it would be more like the drinks available at the Loopy Doopy Rooftop bar in the city, and this was nothing like it.  It tasted fine, but the drink was weak, and would have fared better had it been a regular sangria with the right amounts of fruit and alcohol already in the glass.For started we shared the Cheesesteak Eggrolls and the Truffled Mac & Cheese. The Cheesesteak Eggrolls tasted great, but I would have preferred if they hadn't already been drizzled with sauce upon plating.  The sauce was a sweet and sour sauce which I could have done without, and having the sauce on the side so the diner can dip to taste would have been nicer.  The Truffled Mac & Cheese was delicious - the cheese was gooey, and the scent of truffles matched the taste of truffles that was infused into the dish.  I personally love a good mac and cheese, and this was delicious!For our entrees my sister and I respectively got the Shaved Prime Steak Sandwich and the Ahi Tacos.  The roll on the Shaved Prime Steak Sandwich looked doughy to me, and there was only a bit of au jus in the cup, but my sister enjoyed her dish.  Unfortunately, we had so much to eat as appetizers that she wasn't able to finish and packed the rest to go.  Our server was a doll however giving extra au jus dipping sauce and packing up the left over Truffled Mac & Cheese as well.  The Ahi Tacos were small, but just the right amount given all the starters that we had munched on.  There was no skimping on the tuna tartare, it was a very generous portion in fact, and just the right amount of avocado.  I was very pleased with the tacos, and happy that I had chosen to eat them as my entree instead of as an appetizer.  Finally, the service.  Our waitress reminded me of your stereotypical ""surfer girl.""  A bit space cadet like in her demeanor, but very friendly and attentive to everything that we needed.  Unfortunately, we needed to ask for everything we need from place settings, glasses of water, and extra napkins.   Wish I could give Del Frisco's Grille a 4/5 stars, but while the food was good, unfortunately the service as a whole from start to finish was a tad subpar.  I would definitely go back though as overall, my experience was good.",Del Frisco’s Grille,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"
14,Meqh_NjLKxN2cJv7cpqEBA,Hilary R.,4.0 star rating,"My sangria had an icepop in it. I REPEAT: my sangria had an icepop in it.Great experience for one of my best friends birthdays. We arrived early, so we grabbed some drinks at the bar before the rest of the party showed up. My white sangria had this strawberry fruit infused icepop sitting in it and when it melted wwoooooaaah. So great. Love the atmosphere, love the location. So conveniently located close to the train and the views of the city and the water are spectacular.We were immediately greeted by Raven once we sat down to get refreshed on drinks and answer any questions we had about the menu. Decided on a few appetizers to start us off: philly cheesesteak egg rolls, pepperoni flatbread, truffle mac and cheese, and the burrata to share. All super fantastic, especially the eggrolls. They had this insane caramelization on the outside, crunchy and delicious. Also the mac and cheese might be in my top 3 mac and cheeses of all time. MUST TRY!For dinner, I ordered the steak salad cooked medium. Only negative thing I will say was that the steak was crazily seasoned. I appreciate a good pepper/salt rub combo, but this was on the border of too salty. The bacon and blue cheese only added to saltiness. Still ate it all though.For desert, you NEED to get the adult milkshake. So yum. We moved back over to the bar once we were done with dinner and it was nice to be comfortable in a Hoboken bar and not trampled on to get a drink. Would absolutely come back to Del Frisco.

16,lRwjIk6o0_OM_JqgtyeHAQ,Kwame S.,2.0 star rating,"Just OKI do not know (and it probably was just me), but I just got a weird vibe from this restaurant. First, upon arriving the hostess mentioned that the restaurant was really busy and that it would be a wait for a table. Ok, no problem that was to be expected on a nice Friday night during the summer. But . . . many of the tables were empty. Ok not a huge deal, because the tables probably were reserved. Throughout the night many of those tables filled up; perhaps, many of the RSVPs were no shows. Perhaps, the waitstaff was a short for the evening, but the food and drinks seemed to take SOOOO long to arrive to the table. Our waitress was really nice but it seemed like something was off, because she was somewhat forgetful. Again, she could have been stretched thin. I had the fish n chips, and the dish was really basic, because the dish kind of tasted like fried air.The food was edible and the place is very good for accommodating large parties (especially parties with children), but it was nothing out of this world amazing.",Del Frisco’s Grille,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

33,Vr94oCgVobXtkrRkg1i3PQ,Jane Y.,3.0 star rating,"There are just some ""chain"" restaurants that know how to provide a good overall experience for their diners - Del Frisco's Grille is one of them.  My sister and I went for an unplanned girls night out and we were told that a table for two on a Friday night would be a 30 minute wait.  Not bad, so we gave our number to the hostess and walked across the street to wait by the water.  Unfortunately, after 40 minutes we weren't given a call, so we walked back to the restaurant to inquire about the status of our table.  The hostess who had taken our name down didn't know what to do, so the hostess to her right searched for our name in the system and that's when we were told that a table was just getting cleaned and that they would seat us at that table once ready.  So about 5 minutes later we were seated.  Total wait time - 45 minutes.We were seated in one of the booths by the kitchen, and to start our evening, my sister had a glass of rose and I had the sangria.  The sangria came with an ice pop, and the ice pop had fruit frozen into it that were released as the ice pop melted into the drink.  Unfortunately, I had ordered the sangria thinking that it would be more like the drinks available at the Loopy Doopy Rooftop bar in the city, and this was nothing like it.  It tasted fine, but the drink was weak, and would have fared better had it been a regular sangria with the right amounts of fruit and alcohol already in the glass.For started we shared the Cheesesteak Eggrolls and the Truffled Mac & Cheese. The Cheesesteak Eggrolls tasted great, but I would have preferred if they hadn't already been drizzled with sauce upon plating.  The sauce was a sweet and sour sauce which I could have done without, and having the sauce on the side so the diner can dip to taste would have been nicer.  The Truffled Mac & Cheese was delicious - the cheese was gooey, and the scent of truffles matched the taste of truffles that was infused into the dish.  I personally love a good mac and cheese, and this was delicious!For our entrees my sister and I respectively got the Shaved Prime Steak Sandwich and the Ahi Tacos.  The roll on the Shaved Prime Steak Sandwich looked doughy to me, and there was only a bit of au jus in the cup, but my sister enjoyed her dish.  Unfortunately, we had so much to eat as appetizers that she wasn't able to finish and packed the rest to go.  Our server was a doll however giving extra au jus dipping sauce and packing up the left over Truffled Mac & Cheese as well.  The Ahi Tacos were small, but just the right amount given all the starters that we had munched on.  There was no skimping on the tuna tartare, it was a very generous portion in fact, and just the right amount of avocado.  I was very pleased with the tacos, and happy that I had chosen to eat them as my entree instead of as an appetizer.  Finally, the service.  Our waitress reminded me of your stereotypical ""surfer girl.""  A bit space cadet like in her demeanor, but very friendly and attentive to everything that we needed.  Unfortunately, we needed to ask for everything we need from place settings, glasses of water, and extra napkins.   Wish I could give Del Frisco's Grille a 4/5 stars, but while the food was good, unfortunately the service as a whole from start to finish was a tad subpar.  I would definitely go back though as overall, my experience was good.",Del Frisco’s Grille,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

We arrived early, so we grabbed some drinks at the bar before the rest of the party showed up. My white sangria had this strawberry fruit infused icepop sitting in it and when it melted wwoooooaaah. So great. Love the atmosphere, love the location. So conveniently located close to the train and the views of the city and the water are spectacular.We were immediately greeted by Raven once we sat down to get refreshed on drinks and answer any questions we had about the menu. Decided on a few appetizers to start us off: philly cheesesteak egg rolls, pepperoni flatbread, truffle mac and cheese, and the burrata to share. All super fantastic, especially the eggrolls. They had this insane caramelization on the outside, crunchy and delicious. Also the mac and cheese might be in my top 3 mac and cheeses of all time. MUST TRY!For dinner, I ordered the steak salad cooked medium. Only negative thing I will say was that the steak was crazily seasoned. I appreciate a good pepper/salt rub combo, but this was on the border of too salty. The bacon and blue cheese only added to saltiness. Still ate it all though.For desert, you NEED to get the adult milkshake. So yum. We moved back over to the bar once we were done with dinner and it was nice to be comfortable in a Hoboken bar and not trampled on to get a drink. Would absolutely come back to Del Frisco.

First, upon arriving the hostess mentioned that the restaurant was really busy and that it would be a wait for a table. Ok, no problem that was to be expected on a nice Friday night during the summer. But . . . many of the tables were empty. Ok not a huge deal, because the tables probably were reserved. Throughout the night many of those tables filled up; perhaps, many of the RSVPs were no shows. Perhaps, the waitstaff was a short for the evening, but the food and drinks seemed to take SOOOO long to arrive to the table. Our waitress was really nice but it seemed like something was off, because she was somewhat forgetful. Again, she could have been stretched thin. I had the fish n chips, and the dish was really basic, because the dish kind of tasted like fried air.The food was edible and the place is very good for accommodating large parties (especially parties with children), but it was nothing out of this world amazing.",Del Frisco’s Grille,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

I had the ahi tuna salad for my main which was quite large and filling, and the ginger sesame dressing was really yummy. My boyfriend had a burger, don't recall the name, but I obviously stole a bite and it was So. Good. Something about the meat was really flavorful and it was just overall a solid burger. Only thing is they didn't ask what temperature he wanted it cooked, but it ended up coming out to his liking anyway. We got the molten chocolate cake for dessert and it was melty oozy and deeelish.

We sat outside and I was very satisfied with my view and people watching. Service was attentive though it was hard to find our waitress after we paid. I got the lamb burger on a lettuce wrap with a side salad for $15.50. The burger could also come with a variety of fries but I opted for the salad. Lamb burger was good, not great. It seemed overlooked and the seasoning could have been stronger.  Lettuce wrap was overpowering as the burger came with lettuce already so I felt like I was eating lettuce with a side of lamb burger - wish they had just cut down the amount of lettuce. Side salad was fine albeit tiny. My friend got a veggie burger and had the same comments as me.

It is at the corner of Frank Sinatra. It's a cool, swanky place from the outside but when you walk past the hostess stand, you get a mixed feeling of the restaurant's vibe. It's a little higher end but there are a mixture of booths and tables. The booths were small for a group of 4 people. It felt like a regular chain restaurant incorporating booths into the dinning room. I dont know,  just a weird layout to the place in my opinion. (Mind you, the booths are located in front of the open kitchen. It was hot in there! ).. Food: it was good...The cheesteak eggrolls- a must!

56,GRY2acZtI5q4P1KdCWhcUQ,Dave F.,3.0 star rating,"Dear Del Frisco's Grille,Does anyone there know what's going on? Does anyone care? It just seems like no one had any clue or cared. It started when we called 15 minutes before coming in. We asked if a nearby garage would validate parking, and if we could walk in for 2 with a baby. We were told the garage directly across would do free parking with a receipt, and there were plenty of tables, no problem. Parking in the garage, we were told they did not validate for any of the local restaurants. Ok, annoying, but fine, we'll deal. We walk into the restaurant and see easily half a dozen open tables, and the hostesses said all of the tables were for reservations. Then they more less stared at each other saying they didn't know what to do. A manager eventually showed up and found a table for us within about 10 seconds. He was apologetic for the confusion. On to the food. I ordered the crab cake eggs Benedict. When the food finally comes, it's the regular eggs Benedict. I immediately the server (who was not our waiter) and he says he is going to check and be right back. 15 minutes go by, and no one has come to the table to say a word. No ""sorry for the mix up,"" no ""your correct order will be right out."" Nothing. Eventually the food did come back out and the crab cake Benedict does not actually have crab cakes. It's eggs on focaccia bread with crab meat. While this was not what I was expecting, I will say it was actually really good. The good points? The restaurant itself is really nice; one of the classiest in Hoboken. It feels spacious and elegant, and not just another cramped bar. The food, when they eventually got it right, was really good. Prices were actually pretty reasonable and in line with what you would expect for Hoboken. The manager did strike me as someone who knew what he was doing, cared, and wanted to take care of his customers. Will I be back? Yes, I will because the food was good, prices were in line, and the restaurant itself is really nice. That being said, this place needs to start trying and not rest on its laurels. The fact that the restaurant is named Del Frisco's does not mean you do not need to try to do the basics (i.e. Seat people at tables or send correct food orders out).",Del Frisco’s Grille,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

Inside the cooking area is exposed which is nice because you can actually SEE what the chefs are doing in the back as opposed to being left in the dark. Let's talk about my favorite part of this place. The appetizers! If you go here (dinner or after work drinks) you have to get the Cheese Steak Egg Rolls. This app is the first one on the menu and for good reason. It is their best selling appetizer for its uniqueness and tastiness. The egg roll itself is sweet on the outside. Inside the egg roll wrapped up along with the cheese and steak is a honey mustard sauce. Trust me this is the best item to order on the menu. Another great side that we ordered as an app was the Truffle Mac and Cheese. I liked this order a lot because it wasn't overly cheesy and had a nice seasoning to it. Very light which would make it a good choice for ordering as an app or a side. Del Frisco's loses 1 1/2 stars from me for two important reasons: 1. Long wait time for our food (35 minutes after we finished our appetizers) and 2. The Filet MignonI have never ordered a Filet Mignon in my life and had an excessive amount of fat to go along with it. Isn't that the point of ordering this steak? Also, the Filet Mignon was drowned in Pepper Corn. Every bite was a gooey piece of steak with a pepper corn taste. The side of Mashed Potatoes it comes with is ok. It's not your traditional creamy mash that some might be used to. This was very rough with still big pieces of potato in it. Their main seasoning for this side is green pepper so for my Garlic Mashed Potato people this isn't what you will get. For the price of everything and quality we received I wasn't overly satisfied with this place. I would come back to sit by the bar for a drink and order some apps but I don't think I would come back for a steak. There are other better steak restaurants in Hoboken and the surrounding area if that's what you're in the mood for. Hopefully the other entrees on the menu are better than the Filet Mignon!",Del Frisco’s Grille,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

Note to self, order an entire flatbread for just me next time, it's THAT good. I went sweet the last time I brunched here, so i (hesitantly) opted for savory this time around and had the scrambled egg tacos for my main. They did not disappoint.

The location is convenient for me, there's a nice view, it's never too packed, the bar is a nice spacious area to hang out in, and the food is a near disaster. To be fair, some of the food is quite good, but bearing the Del Frisco name mean's people should expect quality steaks. Unfortunately, these are some of the most expensive mediocre steaks I've ever had. Tonight I had some dry aged bone in strip that was a special. I ordered medium rare per usual which tonight meant perfectly crisp on the outside, a bit overdone on the outer layer, and raw in the middle. Last time I was there my steak was overdone and sent back...then raw...then on the third try cooked OK but still flavorless.I've heard the tacos and flatbreads are good but never had them myself. The burger, which I've never order but tried my friend's is pretty damn good. So overall nice space, nice view, some food is quite good but I can't get over the lousy steaks.

Wagyu patty melt with sauteed onions on rye toast was excellent. They forgot the thousand island dressing it was supposed to come with, but I didn't even mind bc it probably tasted better without it. Could've used some more fries though, they beefed up the fry side by stuffing it with tissue paper.Truffle mac and cheese was great too!

I've found they're cooked well, seasoned appropriately, and pretty dang tasty. The seafood items on the other hand, meh. I would personally avoid those when dining here. Can't speak for the salads myself, but I appreciate the options provided and they do *sound* tasty. Wait staff is hit-or-miss. For every knowledgeable and attentive waiter/waitress, there's another that chats idly by the register while I watch my food get cold from afar.

The bar is moderate-sized, but once it gets busy there's not a lot of elbow room there.Our server was so polite, efficient and well-trained I wish I asked his name to compliment him.  Considering the busy dinner crowd, our meal was properly paced and enjoyable all the way through.  We ordered the crab cake appetizer (one very good crab cake/satisfying but overpriced), and the iceberg lettuce wedge which was brilliant in its blue cheese and bacon simplicity. One thing clearly missing is a raw bar; a shrimp cocktail or oysters would have fit in well tonight.My friend ordered the NY strip which he enjoyed but didn't find it as memorable as other prime steakhouses he frequents. I ordered the prime ribeye which was delicious. A woman came out to watch us cut the steaks to make sure they were perfectly cooked. My medium-well was not 'perfect' per se, but close and not worth making a fuss. The steaks came with tasty garlic mashed potatoes.For dessert, the Lemon Doberge cake is indulgent, maybe a little too rich for my blood. The Nutella bread pudding was likewise a hearty and tasty dessert yet the presentation could be a bit better.   I think both of us would try a different dessert on a return visit.The verdict? I would definitely go back. It's a fun, lively restaurant (perhaps a bit noisy for a date night) and I enjoyed the food. There are only a few places in Hoboken you can get a similar steak dinner experience. There are some moderate-priced entrees (meatloaf, roast chicken, burger, etc) If you want the experience but a less expensive tab.  Give Del Frisco's Grille a try and enjoy!",Del Frisco’s Grille,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

Meat was very salty, but was soft and fell apart without the knife. - Others at the table had the Mignon and they enjoyed it (I did not try)Sides like the shaved brussel sprouts w/ bacon was a little dry, and the fries were fries, but helped balance out the meat.Dessert: - Nutella Bread Pudding was fantastic. Highly recommend - we were the envy of the tables in the area. - Lemon Doberge Cake - only get this if you like lemon/lime meringue pie.

We waited no less than 10 minutes before we were greeted, we were literally about to get up and go to the bar (or just leave) and a server came up because I think the bartender could see no one was coming.

Um, ok?  We placed our food orders as well, I got the regular cheeseburger and the wife the green chilies burger. After another 10-12 minutes of no communication another server comes over and says he will be taking care of us, his colleague was just helping out. Trust me I get being in the weeds, I get being new but this was really disjointed. The burgers were ok. I mean, I expect a place like this to have something other than a glorified Shake Shack burger for 13 bucks. Actually, shake shack burgers may be better. While it had a decent flavor it was just a basic fast food burger to me. I feel they should have a real patty you can get cooked to temperature at a place like a Del Frisco's, Grille or not. I would much rather go to Oniels down the street for a burger. The fries were just sysco type fries, I also expected a bit better on that front.

I am qualifying friendly as our waitress apologizing after spilling a drink on a chair. Unfortunately from start to finish there were reasons why I'll never come back here. First, we walked in with reservations. Our party had already arrived and was sitting at the bar. I said this to the hostess (dressed in a lace back black dress and looking more like she belonged at a go-go bar) and was immediately questioned. We should have gotten patted down and put through a metal detector the way these girls were looking at us. I just wanted to see my family at the bar and they felt the need to take our names and check that our party had actually made a reservation. We get to our table and orders were taken. Out of 6 people in our party, 2 orders were correct. My burger was majorly overcooked, and they brought out the wrong sides. One of the shared sides never even arrived. My husband's steak was undercooked and rare when he ordered medium. My food was so-so. I ordered a roasted artichoke as an appetizer. The leaves were so tough. The taste was decent. Now, the most disgusting part of my evening. If I can figure out attach a picture to my review I will, but the ""warm hand cloths"" that were given to us had muddy water running from them. I kid you not. The plate had brown water on it. Why would I wash my hands with dirt?Totally unimpressed.

107,-eQIn-rYsqG9zLTNA0xvAg,Shannon W.,5.0 star rating,"I think Hoboken really needed a place like this. It's perfect for the 25-40 year old 'yuppie' crowd, great for a drink after work, a work dinner or a date. Both times I have been here, everything was absolutely perfect. I'll start with the decor, I love the wall to ceiling windows and the open layout, I also love the rectangular bar, the flat screen tvs by the bar, the comfortable bar seats, and the win bottles tastefully placed on racks throughout the entire restaurant. Now both times I have been here, they told me they didn't have a table, but I never waited more than 15-20 minutes before they found me at the bar and told me my table was ready. This time around we ordered two cocktails to start, which were both amazing. I had the Apt5D, which was amazing, I loved the delicious fresh strawberry flavor and my buddy had the VIP, which was crisp and refreshing.We split the tuna tacos, which come 4 to an app, they're small but very tasty. Then both times I have been here I had the Parmesan encrusted sole, which is delicious. It's lightly battered with Parmesan and some butter and lemon and has arugula salad on top. For desert we split the molten chocolate cake with raspberry and some vanilla ice cream, yummm. I don't know if it's because the restaurant is so new, but everyone here is super nice. I'm waiting for the novelty to wear off and everyone goes back to being an un-super friendly waitress/manager, but for the time being, it's really nice, so much so that it made me go back twice in one week.Overall, very happy this place opened in Hoboken. I'm always looking for a cute date spot with good wines, tasty food, and chill atmosphere and this place has it all. Oh yeah, the wine menu is spectacular, even by the glass...they have 10+ wines by the glass, which is awesome.

109,eN63tX83Dm-PT5CB36M5cA,Sunny G.,4.0 star rating,I was impressed how good the service was considering the restaurant only opened a few weeks ago. The food is on the pricy end for hoboken but its cheaper than the NYC location. Its a good place for hanging out at the bar after work or going out for a date. I started off with the House-made Sausage and Pepperoni flatbread. The portion is huge so I recommend sharing. It was essentially a well made flat bread pizza. For my main course I went with the 12oz Filet Mignon (disappointed that they didn't have the bone in filet but I was told they would start offering that soon). The steak was cooked exactly to how I asked for it to be. It was charred properly and seasoned well. The steak with a side of mashed potatoes. For additional sides I got the Truffled Mac & Cheese (getting this is a must!). Unfortunately I was too stuffed from my meal to order any desserts.

I ordered the 2 fish tacos with a side soup (explained to be tomato bisque but ended up being a corn chowder bisque).  And received a side of cold fries. I still ate them but I was slightly disgruntled while doing so. But he did recommend the VIP cocktail that features pineapple infused vodka (AMAZING) and we became friendly again.

This is the hipper version of a steakhouse - it's not ""old"" and stuffy and it's not divey either.  [I think the Del Frisco's Grille in Rock Center is nicer tho]. I sat at a booth by the kitchen.  Honestly, I think the restaurant can't make up it's mind.  The lighting isn't dim enough for it to feel super swanky.  But I love the way the circle lights overhead look.  I also liked that the booth had hooks for coats.  They also have a coat check at the hostess stand if you are put at a table. There is a bar with a pretty large bar space tucked in the front corner behind the host area.  Might be a good place to catch a game or grab pre-dinner drinks also. I wasn't super hungry this time around so only ordered a spicy pork flatbread and the signature ahi tuna entrée. Both were really delicious and the portions were surprisingly larger than I would expect them to be at a place like this.  Hanger steak is $25 / A 16 oz. rib eye will set you back $41. The clientele was mostly post-business happy hour hang-arounders and younger people ready to go out on the town.  So when you visit here, don't dress like a bum.  While you will be allowed in, you'll generally stick out because everyone else is put together nicely. Obviously many people come for the steak and other hearty entrees.  But it's also nice that they serve lower priced items as well such as sandwiches, burgers & salads all the time.  Some of the appetizers looked large enough to fill someone up also.  Everyone can come here and have a great meal regardless of their budgetary restrictions.",Del Frisco’s Grille,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

Steak salad was too salty, greens were soggy, medium steak came out rare. Chopped chicken salad came out flavorless, chicken pieces were too big, hard and overcooked. My daughter's chicken tenders were greasy and soggy, not crisp, French fries were cold, she didn't eat them. Server was bogged down, too many tables, only saw her 3 times the whole meal. She seemed nice enough to me, but hubby felt her tone was condescending and phony.  Whatever... Good, memorable service is almost impossible to come by lately.

No. & so I ask ""Well, if you had to choose one thing.."" & she recommends something that they didn't have any more of for the evening. Geez.. So I order a porterhouse steak, Mac and cheese , and sweet potato fries. Everything came out at different times. The food was ok- but nothing to write home about. The server was no where to be found and 20 minutes later when I finally spotted her to ask her about our food .. She acts clueless and blames the food runner for not attending to HER tables..! Our server was careless - leaving a bad taste in my mouth .Maybe it was an off night. Maybe it was just my off server. I would give them another try.. But I would come earlier.. And definitely request a different server if I had her again.",Del Frisco’s Grille,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

152,SgsvTJYy6-HkS5tx13ZBZQ,Cayley A.,2.0 star rating,"I went to Del Frisco's Grille last night for dinner for my birthday. I made a reservation and updated it when I knew my party size grew. Due to the hail and having a 7 month old we were 15 minutes late for the reservation, but part of the party had arrived at 7 and we met at the table. Before I could even take my coat off and sit down the server tried to take my drink order as well as the others at the table. We said we need a bit of time to get settled, and she came back 2-3 minutes later and took our order. 5 minutes after that she came back to take our appetizer and dinner order, and within 15-20 minutes we had our main courses in front of us. This may appear as efficient and great service, but this was a birthday dinner and we felt rushed out the entire time. I understand the majority of the party was 15 minutes late for a reservation, but it was a Monday night and there was no wait when we left around 8:20PM. The food itself was okay. I had the Deviled Eggs which were good, and the Parmesan - Lemon Sole which didn't have a ton of flavor, but wasn't bad. My mom got the steak and it came with chips and fries. Our table was cleared when the majority of us were finished, and my mom's plate disappeared before she could say if she was done or not (she wasn't). Before we saw the dessert menu (I had been thinking about the lemon cake since I read the menu online) we were brought a chocolate cake with a candle in it for my birthday. I don't eat a ton of chocolate so I passed it around the table. I only had room for one dessert and appreciated them putting a candle in it, but I didn't order the chocolate cake and it was brought out almost immediately after our entree plates were cleared. We were soon brought the check and we headed out. I really wanted to enjoy my birthday dinner, and while the company was great, and the food was decent I couldn't help but feel rushed, and a bit of a nuisance. I truly hope this review does not come across as spoiled as this is not my intention; my husband and I don't get out a ton right now since we have the baby so any time we do go out we like to savor the moment.",Del Frisco’s Grille,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

155,IlbKxrvsSifMeZGx6B3RTg,Diane C.,2.0 star rating,"Super disappointed.  The nutella bread pudding was the only thing I would call ""good"".  I came here on a Saturday for lunch.  First of all, we brought our 9 week old daughter and the hostess was very accommodating in allowing us to bring our stroller to the table.  It looked like they made all other families with babies leave their strollers at the door so I was relieved they let us take ours!  That great service experience is why I'm giving 2 stars.  Ok, so the food. My fault in not checking the menu online but I assumed they would have big, juicy steaks for lunch... maybe like a ribeye.... but NOPE!  I psyched myself up all week for nothing.  The only entree steaks on the menus were a hanger steak and a 6 oz filet mignon.  Seeing as I do not like filet mignon, I ordered the hanger RARE.  The waitress asked me twice if I was sure I wanted rare because it was red in the middle...I responded the redder the better!  (I like my steak to moo.)  However, when I received the steak, you'd think I ordered it well done!  I couldn't even find pink in the center - it was fully cooked through and grisly.  Super duper disappointed.  The appetizers were good but nothing to write home about.  We ordered the:*Cheesesteak eggrolls: Decently good but the American cheese had coagulated and tasted so artificial.  This would have been much better if they had used cheddar or another cheese that was melty and oozy.  *Ahi Tuna Tacos:  Good but lacking in tuna quantity.  I thought it was loaded but when I bit into the taco, it was filled with lettuce instead of tuna.  Disappointed considering what they charged for it at all.*Meatball Flatbread:  Took 1 look at the meatball and said - that was DEFINITELY frozen at some point!  It was crusty like the ones you get from bulk bags at costco.  I was appalled since this is how I make pizza at home.  I didn't expect this at a Del Frisco!*Deviled Eggs:  Taste was OK but the looks was completely off putting.  A perfectly round spherical ball of yolk in an egg white.  The perfect roundness of the yolk just made me think that they had some guy spooning out the yolk mixture with a melon baller and stuck it into a ready prepared egg white in an assembly line.  Didn't look like it was done with any love at all - can't really describe why this put me off but it did.  For entrees, our table ordered the burger, banh mi, meatloaf, and my steak.  Burger was the clear winner here and we all looked at the burger with green eyed envy.  The Banh Mi was just dying for some sriracha sauce.  I'd like to come back for dinner but I'm hesitating now since my hanger steak was SO overcooked.  Still, might come back after they are open for a while and their kitchen/menu normalizes a bit.",Del Frisco’s Grille,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

157,oMFWQKBM6PiJfhelHej__g,Kyle O.,1.0 star rating,"First off, this is not a ""Del Frisco's,"" it is a ""Del Frisco's Grille,"" so don't get your hopes up for the high class experience they usually have.  This is like the Old Navy (or maybe Gap) of restaurants compared to Banana Republic or Nordstroms.  Be ready for plastic menu cards as an example. That said, the food was OK, not great, but not horrible.  Prices are high, a bit overpriced for what you get.  The big reason for 1 star was the Service, which was pretty awful.  We were never ""rushed"" as much in our lives, it was insane.  Here comes the rant...The hostesses completely ignored me, and I even dressed up for this place since it is brand new (1 month anniversary tonight).  No hello, how are you, or offer to seat me.  Maybe because I showed up alone and not with a big party, but I basically had to call my friends and find out where they were seated and go join them on my own.  Not a good start.Then I sit down and the waitress immediately shows up and asks me what I would like to order - I literally hadn't taken my jacket off or ordered a drink or got a water glass filled up.  No hello, how are you, let me tell you about the menu or the specials, simply ""Are you ready to order?"" to which my answer was ""No, I just sat down"" with the subtext of (you watched me sit down 10 second ago and interrupted me saying hello to my friends at the table).  She then follows this up with ""Well do you know what you want to drink then?"" - serious attitude, like I was wasting her time by taking my jacket off.  I quickly just said whatever he is having pointing to one of my friends, and she didn't say ""OK"" or any acknowledgement, she simply walked away - I didn't even know if she heard me.  Luckily a drink came eventually.  But not before she showed up yet again like 2 minutes later asking for our order yet again.  We had no idea, so we asked some questions and pulled some details and recommendations out of her.  Throughout the entire time, she kept trying to take our glasses (with expensive Scotch still sitting in them) and trying to take our plates away from us (with forks in hand) and trying to ask us for our dessert orders without even giving us a dessert menu. When we asked directly for a dessert menu, she brought one for 3 guys to share, it was hysterical in a really bad way.  What set me off was after we paid our check, and were chatting while finishing our Ports and dessert, she swooped in without me seeing and took my empty water glass after I just put it down.  I was obviously thinking she was going to fill it up, but she never came back.  She got our money and our tip and completely disappeared.  I was appalled, she took my water.  Then some other waiter came up and took the dessert plate (with dessert still on it) and my friend's wine glass with wine still in it.  It was crazy, I have never seen that before in my life.So in short, I won't be returning, they need some serious waiter training at this place.Food Review:For appetizers, we got the Cheesesteak eggrolls, apparently a house special - the eggroll wrapper was super chewy, it detracted from the good sauce and good meat and cheese completely, as you couldn't even chew it.  We also got the Tuna tacos as our second appetizer - they were good.  For entrees, we got the salmon (it was good), and two rib eyes (they were cooked decently, but mine was overcooked - I ordered Medium and got pretty much well done with the slightest amount of pink only in the center).  We got the kale and brussel sprout salad, which was good, and asparagus (super small amount for $8.50, not worth it) and green beans (way too much butter, not healthy at all).  The ""fully loaded potato cakes"" were awful, burnt on top and tasteless mush.  The shredded brussel sprouts were a way better side for the steaks.  For dessert we got the Nutella bread pudding, which was decent, and 2 ports, which were just OK.Del Frisco prices with Del Frisco ""Grille"" quality food and NYC Bodega service, get you in and get you out.  Really embarrassing to be honest.",Del Frisco’s Grille,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

If you don't know about VIPs and Cheesesteak Eggrolls, you're missing out on life.First of all the location -- right on the water! -- is just breathtaking. We enjoyed a couple of drinks at the bar, where we admired the view, on a Friday night and were promptly seated. They were incredibly accommodating given that we didn't even have reservations, but luckily we had plenty of time to spare as my girlfriends and I had a lot of catching up to do, and as I mentioned, we LOVE their VIPs. The bartenders, by the way, were attentive, funny and friendly over all. Once we sat down for dinner, we were greeted by the sweetest young man. He was charismatic and engaging and we actually really loved his banter throughout our meal. We started with guacamole and a flatbread to share, and then I ordered the Porkchop since they don't have that at their sister spot in the city, and I was NOT disappointed. It was phenomenal, probably the best entree (aside from their famous steaks) I've tried at Del Frisco's. LOVED every last bite...it was juicy, cooked to perfection, and even though I'm not usually a fan of BBQ sauce, this was glazed to perfection. Did I mention it comes with potatoes? My girls basically had to roll me out of the restaurant. However: worth it. We also shared a bottle of perfectly suggested red wine. My girls both had steak and they were more than well-pleased with their option. We shared a side of shallot buttered green beans that were perfectly crisp and seasoned very well.Because we're fat asses, we couldn't leave without having a dessert and we went with the butterscotch pudding jar. Oh. My. God. We shamelessly scraped the bottom of the jar. Start to finish, this was a fantastic dinner with my girlfriends, and it was in no small part due to the friendly staff and delicious food and Del Frisco's Grille. The manager even stopped by to see how our meal was going half way through -- for no reason at all -- which really made us feel special. I swear we're going to make it a point to go back any time we visit my friend's place in Jersey.

If you don't drool over the two juicy patties set atop the perfect combination of lettuce and pickle, jammed between a soft on the inside, toasted on the outside bun, then you're not human. Though I return frequently for this perfect meal (always with a side of sweet potato fries), my favorite experience at Del Frisco's yet has been for brunch. It was love at first sight for me and the Bananas Foster French Toast. I fell further though once I took a bite into the buttery, flavor filled concoction and ""mmm""-ed with every consecutive forkful. It was a hard decision that day for my date and I, however, as our palates also yearned for the Cheesesteak Egg Rolls. The menu warns you that its ""food to fight over"", but even that doesn't do the appetizer justice. Sure, cheesesteak in a fried wrapper bathed in a sour and sweet glaze may not sound like a good complement to breakfast food, but that couldn't stop me.

But, having gone over the weekend, I can honestly say that this is exactly what the Hoboken riverfront needed!  From beginning to end, my party of 4 (including myself) were very happy and not a little impressed.  Having made a reservation and showed up a little early, we were offered seats at the bar which had a very lively energy to it so we gladly accepted the offer.  After ordering a round of drinks (it was pretty apparent their bartenders were very good at what they did), the hostess returned to us personally and escorted us to our table.  First impression of the dining room was, wow!  A totally open concept, including the kitchen (which is a nice touch that I enjoy at restaurants sometimes as it makes you feel like you're able to get an inside peek at their operations), almost every table in the dining room has an unobstructed view of the river and skyline through their massive floor to ceiling glass windows.  The restaurant itself was very clean and I would describe as trendy, but not stuffy. The food speaks for itself.  Coming from Del Frisco's in NY, there are certain expectations and they absolutely delivered.  They server was friendly and knowledgeable, offering nice suggestions off the menu.  The appetizers were AWESOME (Tuna tacos, lollipop wings, and tomato flatbread pizza). Very creative presentation.  All four of us had steaks and they were cooked per-fect-ly.  Nicely seasoned, suffice it to say, they didn't last long on our plates.  Awesome quality, great flavor and texture.  The sides they offer are really great compliments for a place that isn't considered a ""TRUE"" steakhouse -- could have fooled us!  The manager stopped over and chatted with us, making sure we were truly happy with our experience, which we all found to be a very nice touch.  My biggest pet peeve in restaurants is cleanliness, ESPECIALLY in the bathrooms -- nothing throws me more than a seemingly spotless dining room only to be ruined when I take a break to head to the bathroom and find it utterly neglected.  From the time we walked in, to the time we left, we could tell this place was truly taken care of.Final thought?  We cannot WAIT to go back to try something different, this time.  From the drinks, to the wine, to the steaks, to the service, we had a VERY memorable experience.

I ordered the Chipotle Eggs Benedict- they came out as soft boiled eggs instead of runny poached, and were served on fresh ham and scallion biscuits, which I thought was a great play on the original dish. Very pleased. BF got the Chicken & Waffles, and for his first introduction to this dish, he said he hoped it always tasted this way! There is a spicy maple syrup that you have to ask for while ordering, so make sure you do.- The mimosas were great, very strong and the right proportion for a boozy brunch- get the carafe for the best deal.- This place sits right on the river, so you get great light and views during the day.Would I come back here? Definitely. My only gripes:- When I originally made my reservation on the site, the menu was much more extensive. Maybe it was because it was V-Day, but they only were offering 6 menu choices. I wish I knew that going in as there was no specific V-Day menu on the site.- If you look at the site alone, it seems to be more of an upscale place, but I was kinda confused when I walked in and it had a very casual feel. I'm not sure if this place knows exactly the type of brand they want to portray, because there were some managers in suits while the waiters/waitresses looked very casual.

Place was kinda busy for a Sunday evening/night, though I believe she made a reservation ahead of time so once we go there we only had to wait maybe a minute or two to get seated. It was kinda dark were we were sitting, but that really only bothered my dad who wanted to take photos, it was fine for eating and talking and such. I felt the menu was sort of limited and pricey but to be fair I don't usually go to restaurants like this very often. I didn't like how the Menu was labeled though, for example appetizers where ""Food to Fight Over"", I don't usually fight over appetizers at a restaurant. Anyway, got the Green Chili Cheeseburger, and it was pretty good. It wasn't the most amazing burger experience I've had in my life but it was tasty burger. The French fries (not sure still if the regular fries came with the burger or if you had to pay extra as the sweet potato fries on the bottom seemed to be extra) were actually really good, probably the best regular fries I've had in a while and the little Ketchup bottle that came with the fries was completely adorable to the point where I had to point it out to the waitress who told me many people love those little bottles. Wait staff was very nice, when they thought they lost my sister's birthday cake(which was my mom's fault for not explaining she had the cake the whole time) they were completely awesome about, doing their best to get it all resolved as best they could. Very nice. However it felt like we were waiting longer than we needed to after dinner, which made me a little antsy as the only place I found to park was a parking garage and I didn't want a huge parking bill to pay. Overall, I'd say it's a nice place to eat, food is good, a little expensive though and wasn't amazing enough for me to go back ""just for the food"" so I probably wouldn't eat here unless for a special occasion.

We stopped in there for lunch around 3pm on Sunday and it was surprisingly busy. First strike when we walked in was the lady at the front was clearly hating life and didn't want to be at work that day. That's cool, I can deal with that. Our waiter came around and eventually took our order. We ordered 2 of the chicken wraps and a side of broccolini. Our wraps came and we had no cutlery - luckily being wraps we could eat with our hands. Our waiter literally disappeared for 20 mins and we couldn't find anyone to give us some cutlery to eat our salad with. Finally our waiter showed up and we asked him, and he acted like it was more of an inconvenience rather than a mistake on his part. By this time we'd almost finished our meal and asked about our side of broccolini since it still hadn't come out yet. Eventually we'd finished our meal and it still hadn't come, so we flagged down the waiter and he said ""Oh, the kitchen hasn't brought it out yet?"" .... yes, i'm sure it was the kitchens fault. He said he'd go check but when he came back we told him not to worry about it because at this point who wants a side when the meal's done? We just wanted to leave.

175,Hr01GhSPumkMNgjSPKZhkg,Tess D.,5.0 star rating,"Perfect for a special group dinner!  Hands down one of the most elegant and delicious dinners I have ever hosted - in and out of NYC.  Far exceeded my expectations for our company holiday party. Del Frisco's sets a new standard in graciousness for group dining.  It is ironic how a big-city restaurant like Del Frisco's gave me one of the most charming dining experiences I have had in a small town like Hoboken.  I was nervous hosting a dinner in Hoboken because many places disappoint when it comes to service.  Most times they make you feel like they are doing you a favor during your meal. Del Frisco's is the exact opposite.  Worked with event coordinator Melissa to put together a special holiday menu. Told her I wanted something unique and asked if they could do a prime rib roast large-format style. Previous company large-format dinners at DBGB, Resto and Peking Duck House in NYC worked out well for our group of 10-12. Wanted to recreate that feeling in Hoboken.FOOD1) APPS: Family style truffled deviled eggs, cheesesteak eggrolls and mini crab cakes.  Tastes as delicious as they sound.  No idea how they fit the flavor of a cheesesteak into an eggroll. Really strong truffle flavor in the double-stuffed deviled eggs.  Crab cakes were super fresh.2) SALAD: Shaved brussels, kale with manchego, almond and cranberries was a hit.  No boring salads here.3) ENTREE: Prime rib was SO IMPRESSIVE!  We all clapped when the chef herself came out with the whole roast on display before serving. Such ceremony!  How does it get better?  - The taste. Crust on outside of the beef was like bark on a barbecue - glassy, thin, crispy, dark and full of flavor. Perfectly seasoned.  Easily the best prime rib I have ever had in my life!  - Each steak was 2 INCHES THICK, perfect medium rare and looked straight out of Fezziwig's Ball in Charles Dickens' Christmas Carol. - Served it with 2 sauces: creamy apple horseradish sauce to cool the palette and a warm au jus served that was silky and beefy without being greasy.  - Served with truffled mac and cheese and crisp buttery haricot verts. Be very jealous. It was magnificent.4) DESSERT: Warm nutella bread pudding, coffee and caramel ice creams and butterscotch pudding in mason jars.  Ample servings served family style.  Usually not a fan of bread pudding but this one was luscious, sticky, half croissant-half muffin filled with chunks of chocolate and Nutella. Ice cream put over the top. Butterscotch pudding was perfectly sweet and salty. Who makes real pudding anymore? Del Friscos. Great way to end the meal.SERVICE- Chef Anne Moriarta was amazing! Nothing feels better than when the person making your food is as excited to prepare it as you are to eat it. She really took pride in her execution of the meal and it showed. Greeted me to go through the menu and how she would serve before dinner and later reappeared to personally present the enormous hunk of prime rib. Found out later that night from one of the servers that she came in ON HER DAY OFF OF WORK to make sure everything went smoothly. Phenomenally professional and passionate about her food.- Event coordinator: Before dinner I was greeted by the hostess who assigned me a special helper to help set up our table. Such a luxury to be able to have an extra set of hands to help with the setup of decorations on our table!  Plus they already had printed menus at each place setting.  I forgot to ask about this detail and was pleasantly surprised to see that they did this without me having to ask. I have planned at least 20 dinners in restaurants both small and large and never got help.   - Pace: Food came out at a nice slow pace as per my request. I specifically asked if we could linger instead of being rushed out to turn the table. I hate when restaurants book a large group and then rush so they can turn the table again. Del Frisco's let us stay as long as we wanted despite the 45-minute wait at the door. Again, made the group feel absolutely special. - Head server Kyle was fantastic: Made smart wine pairing recommendations and kept our table stocked in wine, cocktails, filled water glasses, utensils and attention all night. - Goodie bag: Chef put aside one of the prime rib end cuts especially for me knowing it is the best part of the roast. Kyle brought it over at the end of the night and it was personally signed with a thank you from the chef. Again, these small touches made the night one to remember.- Thank you card: At the end of the night hostess gave me with a card PERSONALLY SIGNED BY ALL THE STAFF thanking us for coming in. WOW! Ever get one of those after a big expensive meal? Highly recommend this place for a special group feast. First class experience from the beginning to end of the night.",Del Frisco’s Grille,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

Everyone enjoyed the food, which included the deviled eggs, tuna tartare taco, philly cheesesteak egg roll, shaved steak sandwich au jus, roast chicken, lamb burger, salmon and steak. Honestly, my only complaint was that the place was very cold. I had to roll down the sleeves on my flannel shirt (work shirt, wasn't expecting to be at a nice place for lunch) and was pondering putting on my hoodie. One of my coworkers pulled the trigger on that and was sitting in a nice, dimly lit, semi-formal eating establishment in a patterned hoodie because it was hovering around 60 if that.

Also, the Del Frisco's Grille team provided my cousin with a dessert and hand-written Happy Birthday card, which made the night even more special for her. The drinks and food were all delicious, especially the cheesesteak eggrolls which were phenomenal - I highly recommend ordering them. The only reason I didn't provide a 5-star rating was because there was a slight lag-time on delivery of drinks from the bar when ordering. However, I am going to chalk that up to still settling in after newly opening, and I'm sure that won't be an issue for very long.

I must have mentioned it was a celebration when I made the reservation because the hostess knew we were celebrating. Our server also confirmed we were celebrating. Overall, the food was delicious. We ordered the Wedge Salad (my favorite) and I had the 8oz filet while my boyfriend had the prime rib. The steaks came with a side so i got the mashed potatoes which were delicious and he got a side of green beans, which i didn't try but he liked. We also ordered a side of the asparagus and mac&cheese. The asparagus was good but nothing special, however the truffle mac&cheese was to die for. We weren't planning to order dessert but the server gave us a menu and told us to order something on the house. We split the adult milkshake which i recommend getting! The dessert came with a small ice cream with a candle and the server even gave us a ""Happy Anniversary"" card signed by the staff.

So if you like fruity definitely give it a try. We got the Cheesesteak Eggrolls and the Lollipop Chicken Wings which were both good.  For entrees the Filet Mignon which was way over seasoned and salty. They made it clear though that if you are ever unhappy they will make you a new steak.  The loaded potato cake that is an option as a side with the steak was the best thing I had all night.  Other sides we got were the mac and cheese which was delicious and the sea salt & parmesan frites which were nothing special.  Overall its a good addition to Hoboken since its different than anywhere else in town.",Del Frisco’s Grille,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

When someone recommended this restaurant to me I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews about service. Well unfortunately my concerns were confirmed. We had a 2:15 reservation and we were seated promptly after arriving. Our waiter came by shortly after to take our drink orders and put in our appetizer request. The cheesesteak eggrolls are very good and so is the spiced guacamole. After we finished our appetizers they cleared the table and came by a couple of times to take additional drink orders. Not sure what happened to the drinks but they never showed up. After about a 15 minute wait our server came by and said he was sorry for the delay but our food would be right up. About 15 minutes later an ass't manager came by and apologized again for the delay but said our food would be coming soon. About 10 minutes later the manager came over to apologize for the wait and said the food would be coming soon. The food did eventually arrive and was very good (not great) but very good. I would have expected the manager to somehow compensate for the long wait for our food but no such offer was extended. While Del Frisco's is a nice place, there are way too many other great dining options in Hoboken to go back and deal with the slow service again.

210,UBBLZwacVing0XaMaicNIQ,Sallie P.,3.0 star rating,"My boyfriend and I came here on Valentine's Day for dinner because I've been eager to come since it opened.We were seated quickly, and the hostess was friendly. Our server arrived really quickly after we were seated but immediately asked for our appetizer order. We were seated maybe a minute before and he hadn't brought waters or asked for a drink order. After finishing our apps, which came relatively quickly and were pretty good, we ordered 2 glasses of wine. Our dinner came out about 10 minutes later (still no wine) and my steak was undercooked so we had to send it back. We asked for waters in the meantime as they still were not brought out.After I received my steak, we reached a point that we stopped eating our meals because we would have finished them before the wine came.We wanted to drink our wine with dinner and as a result we waited about 20-25 minutes after ordering it, all the while our entrees were getting cold.Originally, when ordering my meal, I asked if I could sub green beans for the mashed potatoes. Our server responded that he needed to check with his manager but he never got back to me. My entree then came with no green beans or the standard mashed potatoes. When the waiter came over 10 minutes later to check on us, I mentioned this to him. He responded with another line about asking his manager and then ducked out, seemingly to get me a side of some kind. A side never came. The waiter showed up after we finished to offer dessert menus and casually said ""the mashed potatoes came, right?"". When we told them they hadn't, he offered to go get them so I asked for them to go. He left to get the mashed potatoes and give us time to review dessert options.We planned on getting dessert here as they looked good, but after waiting 15 more minutes with no sign of our waiter we decided to pay and leave. He showed up, dropped the check and the mashed potatoes, and we left.We really wanted to like Del Frisco's but because the service was so slow, we felt like the experience was overpriced for what we were getting. The mac and cheese side was delicious, as was the smoked pork chop but sadly we will not be returning.",Del Frisco’s Grille,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

They told us to go sit at the bar, and we would be seated closer to our reservation time. After a half hour, my boyfriend went to go check when we would be seated. The hostess said they were just waiting for people to get up and we would be seated right away. 20 minutes after that my boyfriend went to go check again. This time we were seated. When we got seated, I saw there were empty tables all around us. When the manager came over, I asked why it took us 50 minutes to be seated when there were so many empty tables. The manager said ""we made a mistake, but we will be sure to take care of you"". In my mind that means at least our drinks would be comped for their ""mistake"". Nope. The bill came with everything on it. I would have preferred that the manager didn't come over at all. After the meal I messaged the restaurant on Facebook about what happened. They read my message and did not respond. I then sent an additional message saying ""Thanks for the response. I see your social media is much like your management"" Overall, this place is a lot of hype with an inexperienced staff.

214,-A-J3qd_3-_bc0LUhzSMHg,TheHungryDad Jeff C.,1.0 star rating,"Very poor first impression considering the high cost and level this restaurant should be operating.  FIRST (and worst) is that one of the large group with us opened her rolled silverware to find a knife, fork and AN UNROLLED CONDOM inside the napkin!!! Yes. A real condom. They were quick to take it away and get new utensils... And apologized but wow. That was awful. We would have left but we were on a really tight timetable for an event that night. We had also contacted them in advance and ordered salads and appetizers to be ready as we arrived. Of course they were not. They took forever too. So COMDOM and order not ready... So what do they do? They give is MORE ""complementary"" appetizers (beyond what we had already ordered and were still waiting on) that we did not ask for... Ok so the salads finally come out... Nothing special at all. Mixed greens, 2 cherry tomatoes & HALF a price of bacon... $6.50. Then the food comes out. Mostly steaks. All but one was considerably Under-cooked. Tasted good but not cooked correctly. Huge fail for 8 to 10 steaks that cost $41-$48 each.  And it was EARLY in the evening. No one hardly in the place. No excuse for it... ESPECIALLY since they knew about the CONDOM in one our napkin/silverware rolls!  I am baffled how that alone didn't get us SUPER SERVED, but all it got us was 1 managerial apology and several unrequested/unneeded extra ""free"" appetizers. They offered no free meal, or discount or apology for not having our salads/apps ready. Not even a discount or comp meal to the one who got the CONDOM in their napkin!  Bearing in mind that our bill was right at $1000 with Tip. They could have done something. (Or at least cooked our food correctly!) I realize the mgmnt can't control all their employees and the Condom was bizarre, unexpected and unfortunate for them, but they handled the rest of the meal pretty poorly afterward. I find it hard to belie the average customer gets any better service.  Go at your own risk.

I think Del Frisco's is a great addition to Hoboken and I'm sure once they work out a few staffing kinks they will be incredible. Unfortunately, the hostess was visibly flustered and overwhelmed. There was a big crowd of people that had formed all waiting to either check in for reservations or see if there was any availability. I had a 7pm reservation on a Wednesday night so I was pretty surprised there was this much of a wait. To her credit she was very nice and the staff was apologetic but I'd hate to see what a Saturday night looks like here. Once we were sat everything went a lot more smoothly. We decided to sit outside to take advantage of the nice weather but the inside seating area & bar were both packed anyway. Our server Shane was helpful when we asked for app recommendations and attentive throughout the meal. We ordered the ahi tuna tacos and the lump crab cake both were delicious. For dinner, I went with the NY strip with loaded potato cakes and my friend ordered the Rib eye with mash. Both meals were awesome. Our only issue was when my friend ordered another dirty martini she instead got watermelon vodka and olive juice. Our server got her a new one and the manager checked on our table which was appreciated. Overall these were small issues.

The biggest downfall is that the waitstaff aren't locked down in their roles yet and we had to wait 20+ minutes just for someone to get us water to drink. I do understand they've only just opened but the service was a little disorganized and our server had to change 3 times during the course of our meal.

I don't think I've ever seen him return food to the kitchen, ever. No paper towels in the ladies room. My rare tuna came out medium. That's a lotta strikes.Service needs polishing. Atmosphere needs work (dim those overheads and provide candles on the table, maybe?) And food runners need to read the tickets before bringing incorrect orders to the table.

We convinced him to take our order then didn't see him again until our cold flatbread pizza app came out.   When our entree came out the steaks were undercooked and had to be sent back.

With that being said, we had to wait 20 minutes for our table which was odd because although it ""looked"" busy, you can tell they accommodated one too many walk-ins. But it;s fine, Eric over at the bar is always a great guy to hang out with. When we got seated, we were greeted by a server (sorry forgot his name). He made a few recommendations, We started with the Guacamole. Probably one of the worst I have ever had to be honest. I am from California so I was spoiled at a young age with good Guac so this wasn't authentic by any means. You can tell it was made fresh but it lacked 2 essential ingredients; onion and cilantro. It also needed salt and pepper as it was so bland and only tasted like avocado. We then had the truffle flat-bread which was pretty awesome. The arugula was a nice touch. Nothing that hasn't been done before but still very delicious. My friend got the pork chop which was really tasty. Nice rub on it, very sweet. I got the veggie burger. Very good veggie burger, sweet potato fries were also really good. We also shared a truffle mac n cheese which was delicious. We ended the meal with the adult milkshake which was amazing and a good size as we were so full. Overall, it's nice they put a Del Frisco's Grille and not their high end steak house as it's nice to have a good eatery that is affordable but provides a nicer atmosphere than a dive bar like Hoboken is full of.",Del Frisco’s Grille,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"
255,6-oaDoTIoRi3qrrLxun0HQ,Kristine W.,2.0 star rating,"I am giving two stars because the service was really good. The wine our server recommended was also good. The food is another story. My friend and I both ordered the 16 oz Ribeye prepared medium. They both arrived medium well. The manager who dropped them off, apologized and offered to replace cooked as we ordered. However, I have an issue wasting a good cut of beef even though the chef cooked them too long. So we opted to eat them. They were ok but definitely left me with my craving for a good steak unfulfilled. Then we were given a dessert menu and told our waitress we didn't want anything, as my friend and I are not dessert people. I specifically told her I was not a dessert person and don't like sweet things. The manager proceeded to bring over two complementary desserts to make up for the steaks. While the gesture was appreciated, they were barely eaten for reasons mentioned above and wasted. Everything else was left on our bill, even the post dinner coffee my friend ordered. So in conclusion the dining experience was ok, even though they sat us right by the kitchen, but the food was below average especially for the price. And I find it slightly irritating that you bring someone two desserts who tells you they don't like sweets and ate an over cooked steak because they also have an issue wasting food. I would maybe go back here for lunch for to try another dish but I will definitely get my steak fix somewhere else.",Del Frisco’s Grille,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

Service was so slow, food came out late, our waiter had way too many tables to tend to...as a well respected business I expect more. Our waiter Anthony was great but was completely overwhelmed with tables to be able to attend to our table the way it should have been. Hopefully if we go back next time things will be better.",Del Frisco’s Grille,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"

Their cheesesteak eggrolls, lollipop chicken wings, and gluten-free flatbreads were welcome surprises. The sangria was tasty and strong (generous serving, too). The atmosphere is nice with a good view on the water--it seems like more of a place to go with some friends than a date night place.",Del Frisco’s Grille,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"
258,ZfD6ECK3VfHNgl1M9wpaPg,Nick P.,3.0 star rating,Not that impressive.  This isn't a steakhouse as they only have 3 steak choices.  Not very unique menu. I will most likely not come back.  If you want a steakhouse stick with Dino and Harry's.,Del Frisco’s Grille,3.5 star rating,$$$,"American, (New),, Steakhouses,, Cocktail, Bars"
