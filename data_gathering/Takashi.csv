What about some uni with raw beef? Each bite is a SURPRISE. The place to BE for quality meats, stellar appetizers and bomb dessert. WHAT TO ORDER:Appetizers1) raw beef with uni - super creamy and indulgent. Haven't seen this dish being offered anywhere else!2) foiegras meatball with chocolate sauce - it comes in a hot skillet, wafting aromas of chocolate with fatty foie gras. Omg. Meats1) harami skirt steak - salt n pepper2) kalbi - marinated3) in between rib meat - charrs nicely with a little bit a chewYou must try cooking the meat in butter and garlic.....!!Dessert-1) soft serve vanilla - the mochi (rice dumpling) is SO good.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

We had Takashi's Original Ramen ($16) and Grandma's Spicy Ramen ($17) and the beef broth was really unique - extraordinarily rich, and you could really taste the beefiness. Usually I prefer my ramen spicy, but I found the spicy paste a bit overwhelming in flavor and saltiness and you lost some of the nuances of the original broth, which was disappointing - I'd recommend maybe only using half (when they serve the bowl, they put the paste on top and you mix it in yourself). After finishing my bowl of spicy ramen, I became extremely thirsty and drank like a gallon of water at home. For Kobe beef, I didn't think the meat was as tender as it could have been. The noodles were decent, but the best thing was actually the crispy intestine cracklings. Overall, it's a fun experience and the food is good, but definitely not the best ramen I've had.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

The beef was first grade and the uni was very fresh. The seaweed and leaf were not just for decoration but contributed to the nice flavor instead.Yooke: personally, I think it is the best dish we had in the entire meal. The seasoning is right, the beef is fresh, and the egg made the meat tender and whole the flavor together. Even our son ate a lot of it.Steamed beef shank bun: we didn't like it. The shank was too dry and tasted kind of bland. We understand that they would need to have at least one dish for kids but it was just not working for us.US Kobe Kalbi: it is our favorite meat for the grill. It was tender, juicy and just melt in your mouth. We ended up getting a second order.Filet mignon with garlic butter dip: we are normally not a filet mignon fan as we prefer fatty/juicy/more flavor cuts, but this dish did not disappoint. By following their instruction, the filet mignon was actually quite juicy! I also love their garlic butter dip. We kept it for the whole meal.Thick tongue: my husband has been looking for thick cut beef tongue in NYC for a long time and was glad to find it here. It is always our preference to have thick cut beef tongue over the thin ones as you can enjoy the texture and flavor.Harami: this was our less favorite dish for the grill. The meat was too chewy for our taste and the marinate was not helping - the garlic sauce didn't go well with the meat for some reason.We gave the restaurant a 4 Star because of the Shank Bun and Harami, but I can see we go back to try other more adventurous dishes!!",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

6,ymmhlMF1Y1V6Y6QV28kbcQ,Mai Y.,5.0 star rating,The quality of the meat is top notch here. Takashi is one of the best yakiniku restaurants I've been to outside of Japan. They don't accept reservations for small parties less than 4 people so we went at 5:30 p.m. to line up before they opened. There was probably 4 parties ahead of us. The restaurant is pretty small so it's best to go early. We came once on a Saturday night around 7:30 p.m. and they told us the wait was 2-3 hours. We ordered 2 appetizers and 3 meat dishes to share between the 2 of us and we were pretty full after that. We could have eaten more but didn't want to push our limits. Yooke- a dish that's often offered in Japanese yakiniku restaurants. It's beef tartare with a raw egg on top. Loved it!Niku Uni- this was by far my fav dish of the night. It's beef sashimi topped with uni on shiso and seaweed. Best combination ever! But then again uni is one of my fav things in the world.

Finally me and my bf had a chance to go and we waited about 5 minutes to get a table. The place is not that big and it looks simple and cute inside. I got raspberry soju martini to try their drinks and honestly I didn't really like it. Its too sweet with alcohol. I expect some more flavor in it. For appetizer we got the niku-uni- chuck flap with leaves of seaweed, uni and wasabi. It was good and different. You taste the strong leaves and uni. 4 pieces for 2 people is good. For bbq we got 3 types, kalbi, harami and misuji. Everything was really good and perfect and the serving is small and I eat a lot, so for me and my bf we eat it so fast. Good thing I eat a lot of rice too or else I'll still be hungry and need to order more meat. Its really the best quality of meat so no regret. Its very different from any usual kbbq places.

WAIT,After not being able to get in our first time in NYC (they only allow reservations for parties 4 or more), my friend and I made a point to get here hella early to grab a seat.  We got there at 5pm on Thursday and were the first people in line, so needless to say, we were stoked! We ordered three kinds of meat: the Kobe Kalbi, Beef Belly, and the Super-tender Filet Mignon Steak with Garlic Butter Dip. We got both the Kalbi and the Belly marinated in Takashi sauce and it was amazing! I prefer my meat medium-rare to raw plus, so 30 seconds on each side made each piece perfect.  Such tender meat!  We ate several plates worth each!  The star of the meal was the Filet Mignon steak though. We ordered it based on the waiter's recommendation and it was one of the most delicious steaks I have eaten. It comes with a metal pan full of butter and crushed garlic cloves, which you heat on the grill with the meat.  First, you sear the steak bits on the grill, then you finish by cooking them in the butter sauce. It is heavenly! As a lover of garlic, this was everything I could have wanted from steak in garlic butter sauce. Plus, once you finish cooking the steak, you can enjoy the caramelized garlic bits.Overall, I spent $100 on dinner and loved every bit of it!

When you go to a restaurant that only serves cow, it's like angel voices ringing in my head. Because who really wants to order a veggie dish? (Vegetarians and vegans excluded). Oh, but the starters were veggies, and they were fine.Everything at Takashi was prepared beautifully, and all the dishes were so good! I wanted to order more, but everyone was full.K-F-C (Kobe beef tartar, foie gras and caviar on toast) - this was good and actually a decent amount of foie and caviar; probably would not order again due to there being other quality menu itemsStewed beef tendon casserole - hands down the best thing we ate; hearty and flavorful, so much flavor! Sooo good. Everyone at the table wanted more.Steamed beef shank buns with spicy mayo - pass; the flavor was underwhelming compared to the beef tendon casserole, but the meat was tenderFoie gras stuffed meatball with chocolate bbq sauce - the sauce was the star, it was weird and satisfying at the same timeSquid ink rice with miso-marinated sweetbreads - I liked this; it had a slight briny taste and the sweetbreads gave a complementary texture to the riceYooke (chuck eye tartare with raw quail egg) - I think I prefer the Korean way with the Asian pears and more, but you could definitely taste the high quality of the meat here; not bad, not greatNiku-uni (chuck flap topped with uni on top of shiso) - we all agreed that this one might have been a bit overhyped for us; it was good, but not ""omg I have to get a billion of these"" good. Uni and the meat was top notch though for sure, but we thought the shiso overpowered everything a bitOn top of the above, we ordered some ribeye, beef belly, and short rib. I liked them all, but my favorite was the short rib.I highly recommend Takashi.

16,XNph_HuwSl7N7SyscG-dGw,Jennifer C.,4.0 star rating,"If you're an adventurous eater, or an offal fan, this definitely deserves a visit.  I've been here twice, and I think that my experience was dampened by a recent visit to Japan.  Before I went to Japan, this place blew my mind - after, I still enjoy the food here, but I'm much more cynical about a couple of the dishes.  With that said, the service was loads of fun and we still had a great meal. We didn't stay for the not so secret ""secret"" ramen this time around, but if you have a chance to - do it!  Last time we ate from the standard menu, and then ended up staying for secret ramen, I definitely walked out of Takashi with a second trimester food baby. This time around, we had a reservation for 7 PM, yet we all coincidentally ended up in the area 30 minutes early, walked by the restaurant, and since there were open tables, we were seated immediately.Niku-Uni: chuck flap topped with sea urchin and fresh wasabi. This is just me being picky, I just had uni from Hokkaido the previous week, so I was definitely not impressed with this dish.  Also, as much as I try, I still just don't love shiso leaves.  Worth a try if you haven't had it, but I doubt I'd personally order it again.Takashi K-F-C: Kobe beef tartar, whipped Foie gras marinated in white miso and Caviar from Hackleback, served with sake-pickled Japanese cantaloupe and toast.  If only I could keep this ""Miraclewhip"" in a giant tub in my fridge. I worried needlessly that the white miso would overwhelm the flavor of foie gras, and be overpowered by the saltiness of the caviar.  I was wrong, this is decadence in every mouthful.  Thinly sliced A5 Miyazaki Kalbi with Hokkaido Scallop Sashimi and Spring Garlic chives: the scallop just melted onto the kalbi in our mouths, and this was one of the highlights of the night, though we all agreed that there were too many chives. Do not skip this. We ended up saving the chives on the side of our plates for nibbling throughout the rest of the meal.Super-tender Filet Mignon Steak with Garlic Butter Dip: I'm usually not a filet mignon girl, but anything in garlic and butter will always get me.  This is worth ordering - unless you're on a first kiss kinda date - we're talking whole cloves of garlic.Bone Marrow and Crawfish Dumplings with Hong Kong-Style Hot Peanut Oil Sauce: I wanted to love this, the dumpling blend was extremely tender, but even with a copious dip into the peanut oil sauce, it leaned towards blandness, which is a shock since I can't rock spicy.Grandmom's Steamed Beef Shank Buns with Spicy Mayo: This was the other dish I was underwhelmed by, and I think that it's just the Asian in me, this was no more remarkable than a typical bun from a dim sum place, and the meat was a tad dry. If I'm being honest, I'd rather have a $2.50 pork bun from a standard dim sum place.Calf's Brain Cream (in tube) with Blinis & Caviar: If you've never had this, this is lovely.  It's lighter than foie gras, and once you get over the mental block of eating ""brains"", it's a surprisingly delicate dish. Remember to eat this with your pinky out.Rosu (Ribeye): when in doubt, you can't go wrong with ribeye.Tsurami (Cheeks): anytime you have a chance to enjoy cow cheeks - do not resist.Tan-saki, Tan-suji & Tan-moto (the tongue experience): and what an experience it is, you have to try this at least once. It's interesting to compare texture and flavors of the various parts of the tongue.We ended up sharing a Madagascar Vanilla soft-serve ice cream made in house, the texture was unimpressive, but the flavor kept us reaching for our spoons.Two bottles of yuzu sake on the rocks kept us company throughout the meal.  Shout out to Adam for being such a darling during the night!",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

I love the vibe there and I became friends with them.Takashi is a hidden gem. The reason I say it is because there are no big sign on the street and he to road construction you won't be able to see it out from the road.

Not too oily and it's just get to the point. Limited supplies every single day sometimes they will be out on sunday nights. So good luck kn that. THICK beef tongue: this is another MUST ORDER.

The uni is so fresh and they give you a good amount one each of the 4 pieces. The raw beef is delicious and lightly chewy and goes well with the shiso. I also tried their beef belly and kalbi bbq. They give you a very small amount (compared to regular Korean BBQ), so don't go starving! I also tried the beef schmaltz crostini with truffle oil, which was tasty but nothing spectacular. I did want to point out the great service we had because I read a few reviews about how the servers aren't the friendliest. When I called the restaurant prior to dining there, they said it would be about an hour wait which is expected. I got there and the guy at the door said that they had a no-show and would be able to seat us! The server we had was also so friendly and very attentive.

26,ymmhlMF1Y1V6Y6QV28kbcQ,Mai Y.,5.0 star rating,The quality of the meat is top notch here. Takashi is one of the best yakiniku restaurants I've been to outside of Japan. They don't accept reservations for small parties less than 4 people so we went at 5:30 p.m. to line up before they opened. There was probably 4 parties ahead of us. The restaurant is pretty small so it's best to go early. We came once on a Saturday night around 7:30 p.m. and they told us the wait was 2-3 hours. We ordered 2 appetizers and 3 meat dishes to share between the 2 of us and we were pretty full after that. We could have eaten more but didn't want to push our limits. Yooke- a dish that's often offered in Japanese yakiniku restaurants. It's beef tartare with a raw egg on top. Loved it!Niku Uni- this was by far my fav dish of the night. It's beef sashimi topped with uni on shiso and seaweed. Best combination ever! But then again uni is one of my fav things in the world.

I got raspberry soju martini to try their drinks and honestly I didn't really like it. Its too sweet with alcohol. I expect some more flavor in it. For appetizer we got the niku-uni- chuck flap with leaves of seaweed, uni and wasabi. It was good and different. You taste the strong leaves and uni. 4 pieces for 2 people is good. For bbq we got 3 types, kalbi, harami and misuji. Everything was really good and perfect and the serving is small and I eat a lot, so for me and my bf we eat it so fast. Good thing I eat a lot of rice too or else I'll still be hungry and need to order more meat. Its really the best quality of meat so no regret. Its very different from any usual kbbq places.

WAIT,After not being able to get in our first time in NYC (they only allow reservations for parties 4 or more), my friend and I made a point to get here hella early to grab a seat.  We got there at 5pm on Thursday and were the first people in line, so needless to say, we were stoked! We ordered three kinds of meat: the Kobe Kalbi, Beef Belly, and the Super-tender Filet Mignon Steak with Garlic Butter Dip. We got both the Kalbi and the Belly marinated in Takashi sauce and it was amazing! I prefer my meat medium-rare to raw plus, so 30 seconds on each side made each piece perfect.  Such tender meat!  We ate several plates worth each!  The star of the meal was the Filet Mignon steak though. We ordered it based on the waiter's recommendation and it was one of the most delicious steaks I have eaten. It comes with a metal pan full of butter and crushed garlic cloves, which you heat on the grill with the meat.  First, you sear the steak bits on the grill, then you finish by cooking them in the butter sauce. It is heavenly! As a lover of garlic, this was everything I could have wanted from steak in garlic butter sauce. Plus, once you finish cooking the steak, you can enjoy the caramelized garlic bits.Overall, I spent $100 on dinner and loved every bit of it!

When you go to a restaurant that only serves cow, it's like angel voices ringing in my head. Because who really wants to order a veggie dish? (Vegetarians and vegans excluded). Oh, but the starters were veggies, and they were fine.Everything at Takashi was prepared beautifully, and all the dishes were so good! I wanted to order more, but everyone was full.K-F-C (Kobe beef tartar, foie gras and caviar on toast) - this was good and actually a decent amount of foie and caviar; probably would not order again due to there being other quality menu itemsStewed beef tendon casserole - hands down the best thing we ate; hearty and flavorful, so much flavor! Sooo good. Everyone at the table wanted more.Steamed beef shank buns with spicy mayo - pass; the flavor was underwhelming compared to the beef tendon casserole, but the meat was tenderFoie gras stuffed meatball with chocolate bbq sauce - the sauce was the star, it was weird and satisfying at the same timeSquid ink rice with miso-marinated sweetbreads - I liked this; it had a slight briny taste and the sweetbreads gave a complementary texture to the riceYooke (chuck eye tartare with raw quail egg) - I think I prefer the Korean way with the Asian pears and more, but you could definitely taste the high quality of the meat here; not bad, not greatNiku-uni (chuck flap topped with uni on top of shiso) - we all agreed that this one might have been a bit overhyped for us; it was good, but not ""omg I have to get a billion of these"" good. Uni and the meat was top notch though for sure, but we thought the shiso overpowered everything a bitOn top of the above, we ordered some ribeye, beef belly, and short rib. I liked them all, but my favorite was the short rib.I highly recommend Takashi.

36,XNph_HuwSl7N7SyscG-dGw,Jennifer C.,4.0 star rating,"If you're an adventurous eater, or an offal fan, this definitely deserves a visit.  I've been here twice, and I think that my experience was dampened by a recent visit to Japan.  Before I went to Japan, this place blew my mind - after, I still enjoy the food here, but I'm much more cynical about a couple of the dishes.  With that said, the service was loads of fun and we still had a great meal. We didn't stay for the not so secret ""secret"" ramen this time around, but if you have a chance to - do it!  Last time we ate from the standard menu, and then ended up staying for secret ramen, I definitely walked out of Takashi with a second trimester food baby. This time around, we had a reservation for 7 PM, yet we all coincidentally ended up in the area 30 minutes early, walked by the restaurant, and since there were open tables, we were seated immediately.Niku-Uni: chuck flap topped with sea urchin and fresh wasabi. This is just me being picky, I just had uni from Hokkaido the previous week, so I was definitely not impressed with this dish.  Also, as much as I try, I still just don't love shiso leaves.  Worth a try if you haven't had it, but I doubt I'd personally order it again.Takashi K-F-C: Kobe beef tartar, whipped Foie gras marinated in white miso and Caviar from Hackleback, served with sake-pickled Japanese cantaloupe and toast.  If only I could keep this ""Miraclewhip"" in a giant tub in my fridge. I worried needlessly that the white miso would overwhelm the flavor of foie gras, and be overpowered by the saltiness of the caviar.  I was wrong, this is decadence in every mouthful.  Thinly sliced A5 Miyazaki Kalbi with Hokkaido Scallop Sashimi and Spring Garlic chives: the scallop just melted onto the kalbi in our mouths, and this was one of the highlights of the night, though we all agreed that there were too many chives. Do not skip this. We ended up saving the chives on the side of our plates for nibbling throughout the rest of the meal.Super-tender Filet Mignon Steak with Garlic Butter Dip: I'm usually not a filet mignon girl, but anything in garlic and butter will always get me.  This is worth ordering - unless you're on a first kiss kinda date - we're talking whole cloves of garlic.Bone Marrow and Crawfish Dumplings with Hong Kong-Style Hot Peanut Oil Sauce: I wanted to love this, the dumpling blend was extremely tender, but even with a copious dip into the peanut oil sauce, it leaned towards blandness, which is a shock since I can't rock spicy.Grandmom's Steamed Beef Shank Buns with Spicy Mayo: This was the other dish I was underwhelmed by, and I think that it's just the Asian in me, this was no more remarkable than a typical bun from a dim sum place, and the meat was a tad dry. If I'm being honest, I'd rather have a $2.50 pork bun from a standard dim sum place.Calf's Brain Cream (in tube) with Blinis & Caviar: If you've never had this, this is lovely.  It's lighter than foie gras, and once you get over the mental block of eating ""brains"", it's a surprisingly delicate dish. Remember to eat this with your pinky out.Rosu (Ribeye): when in doubt, you can't go wrong with ribeye.Tsurami (Cheeks): anytime you have a chance to enjoy cow cheeks - do not resist.Tan-saki, Tan-suji & Tan-moto (the tongue experience): and what an experience it is, you have to try this at least once. It's interesting to compare texture and flavors of the various parts of the tongue.We ended up sharing a Madagascar Vanilla soft-serve ice cream made in house, the texture was unimpressive, but the flavor kept us reaching for our spoons.Two bottles of yuzu sake on the rocks kept us company throughout the meal.  Shout out to Adam for being such a darling during the night!",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

I love the vibe there and I became friends with them.Takashi is a hidden gem. The reason I say it is because there are no big sign on the street and he to road construction you won't be able to see it out from the road. The restaurant itself is kinda tiny and they only take reservation for 4-6 people. During the weekends, no parties bigger than 6. This is the rule. So make your reservation ahead. Or you should be prepared to wait for at least an hour. Appetizer: wagyu beef topped with uni and raw beef tartare with quail eggThose two are my MUST ORDER.

Not too oily and it's just get to the point. Limited supplies every single day sometimes they will be out on sunday nights. So good luck kn that. THICK beef tongue: this is another MUST ORDER. Words can't explain how good it is just try it and you will never regret.  The food quality that takashi is providing never disappointed me. Not even once.

The uni is so fresh and they give you a good amount one each of the 4 pieces. The raw beef is delicious and lightly chewy and goes well with the shiso. I also tried their beef belly and kalbi bbq. They give you a very small amount (compared to regular Korean BBQ), so don't go starving! I also tried the beef schmaltz crostini with truffle oil, which was tasty but nothing spectacular. I did want to point out the great service we had because I read a few reviews about how the servers aren't the friendliest. When I called the restaurant prior to dining there, they said it would be about an hour wait which is expected. I got there and the guy at the door said that they had a no-show and would be able to seat us! The server we had was also so friendly and very attentive.

While the spice paste isn't really spicy, it does add a huge punch of umami flavor. The broth is AMAZING. Ramen broth is usually pork or chicken based, but after trying this beef broth, normal tonkotsu broth just doesn't compare. It has such a deep, rich flavor without all the heaviness that the pork broth has. Plus, I've never actually had beef belly before, and it's SO MUCH better than pork belly.

We ordered the 'Cow Experience' (which had to be ordered in advance, but the waiter and chef were kind enough to accommodate us (thank you again)). It's about 5 slices of 16 different edible portions of the cow. Heart, liver, 4th stomach. FOURTH! If I had that many stomachs, I'd be as fat as a cow too! And yes, each piece was rich in flavor. You start to wonder if they have a designated cow in the back on life support for this very purpose. I thank you, coma cow.The service is what you'd expect. Well... it's what I expect you'd to expect: prompt and slightly personal (good personal). So, as you already figured out, the caveat is: it's d**k expensive. Between 5 people, the 'Cow Experience' is $55 each. That's $275, and with 5 slivers per organ, that comes to roughly $3.50 per slice. I told my hair dresser and she really likes the place. The only difference between us is that I'm 100 lbs heavier than her (she'd take that as a compliment if she heard), so the lesson of the day is: maybe I'm broke because I'm a fatass.I HAVE TO mention they do carry the best IPA I've ever had.

Both the marination options are flavorful. The beef belly being the softest. The kalbi and the Harami (skirt steak) were very good.  - scallion salad - perfect dressing, refreshing, filling- ice cream - get the vanilla with no toppings.

Gripes:- you may think it's overpriced, and the quality of MEat may be just average for you, but I think it was worth it - you definitely come out of here smelling like a barbecue and meats so plan on doing this and bring some body spray along, or shower before you go out after.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

You cook your own food (Korean BBQ style) on an open grill on your table.For our party of five, we ordered a variety of dishes to share. What we had: * Sea Urchin atop Kobe beef tartar served on seaweed - practically melts in your mouth* Testicargot - cow balls escargot style with garlic butter* Bone marrow beef balls/dumpling - dish came out sizzling! * Kalbi (short rib)* Rosu (ribeye)* Beef Belly* Wagyu beefEverything was delicious and drool worthy. The grilled meats were so tendered and perfectly seasoned - the meat just melts in your mouth. Our table was feeling a little adventurous and ordered the cow balls escargot. It was interesting to say the least. The dish was a strong garlic butter flavor which helps to not remind you that you are eating cow balls. The homemade ice cream is great too.It's a little pricy but worth it!! Great place to eat some Yakiniku Japanese style.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

Being a bit of adventurous foodie (but not as adventurous as Andrew Zimmerman) I want to try a place know for their offal. That is parts of the animal that are not commonly used in dishes.The restaurant is pretty small but has a cozy feel. It has bar seating as well as about roughly about 10 tables for seating. We were sitting near the back area. The walls are decorated with drawings and descriptions of the food they offer.There was a good amount of drinks offered as a selection. I ordered the white peach soju sparkler to drink along with the meal. It had a light clean flavor and was refreshing. Before ordering, we were given three complimentary appetizers of raw cabbage with a sesame dressing drizzled, kimchee and bean sprouts lightly tossed in a soy sauce. For the dinner we ordered the Niku-Uni, testicargot,  the tongue experience, the marinated is Kobe kalbi short rib and the marinated shibire (sweetbreads). The Niku-Uni was a great start to the meal. It was fresh sea urchin topped on a chuck flap of beef, sesame leaf, nori and a little wasabi. It was served with a side of soy sauce that you folded the Niku-Uni and dipped into it.As each of the meats to be grilled were presented, the waitress was helpful by instructing us how long each item was to be grilled. The tongue experience was an interesting. The tongue was presented in three different cuts (front, middle and back of the tongue). Each cut had a different tenderness to it. I liked the middle cut the best out of the three. On the side we were given two sauces for dipping the meats into. One was a soy sauce and sesame seed mix and the second sauce was a yuzu sauce.The Kobe short rib and sweetbreads were very tender and so flavorful. The waiter told us that the meats can be either seasoned or marinated. He highly recommended to have them marinated for the full flavor and he was right. The short ribs and sweetbreads did not even need the extra sauces. I always heard that sweetbreads taste great if prepared correctly and boy were these great. The testicargot was a bit on the chewy side. It was flavored well, but it wasn't my favorite thing that we tried that night. It was a texture thing that turned me off from it.Service was really good as the waiters were willing to explain anything in the menu and make sure you were enjoying your meal. The check came out with gum to freshen up your breath from the meal.

In my opinion though was really overpriced, and the portions were pretty small.The best thing we had was definitely the beef belly, would really recommend that. Their tartare with quail egg was pretty good too, but it gets a little gross after too much so make sure you have a few people to share this with. The thick slices of beef tongue I did not enjoy, and I usually love tongue! I think the slices were just too thick so you'd get it crisp and starting to burn on the outside, but the middle would still be cold and raw. I personally prefer a thinner cut where the entire slice is nice crisp on the outside with a bit of chewiness. Also had the testicargot...huge regret! My boyfriend and I wouldn't have even finished it if it didn't cost so much! It had a sort of sauce over it but tasted unseasoned otherwise, so the middle was just a bland tasting testicle...not good.Price was also really high for what we ordered and the amount of food. We didn't order any of the crazy slices of beef like the wagyu or Kobe, we got about 5 different dishes in total and it came to $120 for 2 people! We definitely weren't full, we just kind of got sick of eating meat and we had agreed to finish within an hour, that was the only way we could be seated without a long wait.

You can't go wrong with Kobe beef topped with uni with a shiso leaf. One thing I knocked off a star for was the beef was a bit to frozen therefore, there was not much flavor.Takashi's K-F-C: Steak tartar was amazing!

It was VERY good, just like escargot Pork Belly: Very fatty and marinated well for BBQChef Special: They had a few livers, hearts and other goodies, portions are pretty small and more on the pricey side, but was marinated well and was delicious still!Overall, great experience and definitely lives up to its hype!

When it came time to pick a restaurant for my birthday dinner, I knew exactly where I was going to go! We had reservations for 4 people (they actually only allow reservations for 4+ people) and was seated right away. At 6:30pm, all the tables were full and most of the counter spots were taken as well. They take your jackets and store them in closets so they don't smell like barbequed meat, which I thought was very nice. We opted to start with a few shared appetizers and then move onto the yakiniku. We got the Instagram-famous Niku-Uni. I really enjoyed each bite (spoiler, I had 2). The uni was really fresh and creamy, and all the flavors meshed really well together. We also decided to be adventurous and try the Testicargot, or cow balls cooked escargot-style with garlic shiso butter. I've had bull penis as well as turkey balls before and neither of them was a good experience, so I wasn't expecting to enjoy this one either. It was actually quite pleasant! To be fair, the cow balls were smothered in the garlic shiso butter sauce so you couldn't really tell what you were eating. But, I did enjoy the texture and taste a lot more. We also had the Stewed Beef Tendon Casserole. The beef tendon was very tender and the stew was extremely flavorful and fragrant. I kind of wish the dish was a little bit bigger because I wanted more beef tendon! We sampled a variety of meats during the yakiniku phase of our dinner. We ended up trying:-          Kobe Kalbi, or short rib ($26)-          Kobe Ribeye ($26)-          Beef Belly ($20)-          The Tongue Experience ($25) with Tan-saki, Tan-suji, and Tan-moto-          Sirloin All of the meats we ordered were really good, but I think our favorite of the night was the Kobe Ribeye, which we ended up placing a second order. Everything tasted really fresh and a lot of the meats practically melted in our mouths (except for the tongue, of course). They only have one kind of dessert here - Homemade Madagascar Vanilla Soft Serve, which you can add a variety of toppings. I went with the, ""I'll have it with the works"", which has every single topping and your choice of a syrup. I opted for the green tea syrup, which helped to cut the sweetness of the ice cream. It was really, really good and made me think of my time in Japan last year where the soft serve is definitely better than it is here. Service was attentive and they changed our grill a few times during dinner, which helped prevent the meat from sticking.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

I do not rate price level or ambiente, but strictly the quality & flavor of the food as well as the quality of the service.Overall I love Takashi for its uniqueness in their offer. Takashi is no ordinary Japanese/Korean table BBQ, but the upscale version of it with a very interesting twist on the menu.Food - 8/10Service - 8/10Below some details on the above.The seating at Takashi creates comfort & informality while not being too informal. At the same time, the tables are rather small and the seating is rather squeezed. At times the smoke of the table grills gets intense. Overall, Takashi probably has less than 8 tables (x4 people) and a bar counter to dine on.It has to be mentioned that Takashi is basically three restaurant models in one. The upscale dining option is the full menu of Japanese/Korean table BBQ. On certain days they offer Ramen, which they have been praised for as well. Lastly, they also offer a traditional Japanese/Korean table BBQ menu.What's special about Takashi? The types of meat they offer: From A5 Kobe with 18K gold leaves, over foie-gras infused bonemarrow-meatballs, to tubed calf-brain with caviar. And those are only some of the interesting options on the menu. There's much more to discover here, Takashi doesn't let any type of meat go to waste and instead creates an incredible experience of unique flavors with a luxurious twist.The food I ate here was in all cases amazingly flavorful. Although the traditional options like rib-eye, galbi and pork are great too, I strongly recommend to step out of your comfort zone here and try the unusual.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

Sweet but slightly salty was a good balance. Testicargot was very differrent in a good way. Flavoring from the usual preparation of escargot went well together with the balls.

We also ordered the tartar appetizer along with the US Kobe short ribs and beef belly for the grill. Both were succulent and delicious as the marinade was sweet.

Our server was really great at helping us navigate the menu, helped us figure out portions, and recommended things to order. The interior has whimsical drawings and scribblings along the wall around the cuisine served there--with a special attention to hormone yaki.

If you are down to eat, you will ooh and aah.Service: really prompt and efficientPresentation is good, even for the cook at the table foodsAn array of meat cuts with explanations. We had a three versions of tongue. SO fun to pay attention to the textures. Also a bit visceral. CONS:I imagine some of these creations require some labor but be prepared to spend some to leave full. (Also depends on your budget, I speak from the perspective of having a middle class salary ;) ) No shade to the restaurant as I'm sure rents are cray in this hood and the food is definitely good quality. Bar seating, when you include the inset grill, is a little cramped. But, hey, it's NY.Overall, if you're gonna go, be prepared to spend a bit to leave full, but rest assured, the food will be good.

Originally my party wanted to do the Holy Cow experience but they no longer offer it :(Between the 4 of us, for appetizers we got the Niku-Uni, Yooke (Beef tartare), and Testicargot ( cow balls escargot style). Niku-uni and Yooke were AMAZING. never did i think i was gonna eat raw meat but they were so delicious! Definitely a must try if you come here. The Testicargot was okay. Wasn't blown away. For meats we got the Rosu rib eye ($26), Kobe beef belly ($20), Kalbi Kobe short rib ($26), Filet mignon with garlic butter ($30) and the chef's selection ($36). All of them were soooo good!! The garlic butter was great to dip any of the meats in. Though you don't get much meat, eac meat were marinated very well and you could tell they were quality cuts.

My boyfriend chose this spot because of Anthony Bourdain's NYC Layover episode. We were told the wait would be around 45 minutes, but we were seated within 15-20 minutes. We did notice that it started getting more packed around 9-9:30 though. Note: They only take reservation for parties of 4+ so that's why we had to wait.Takashi was one of the food experiences I have ever had. Although it is pricey, it is definitely worth the price tag. This place is not afraid to experiment and use different cuts of meat that only adventurous foodies will thoroughly enjoy.Real quick, the dressing in the starter salad is AMAZING. The salad may not look like much, but the dressing is A+++.Sake: Our server recommended the Soto one. It was very crisp, refreshing, and smooth. The perfect pairing to our food.Niku-Uni $26 (chuck flap topped with sea urchin and fresh wasabi): I usually do not like uni, but the combination of seaweed, shisho leaf, raw beef, and uni compliment each other so well. The uni is not too overwhelming, and the chewiness of the beef meshes really well with the uni texture. I think this is a must-try because you don't see this pairing anywhere else.Squid Ink Rice & Miso-Marinted Sweetbreads $20 (with Spicy Yuzu Aioli, served on a magnolia leaf): O M G. This dish was the #2 highlight of the evening. The waiter preps this for you by placing it on the grill for a few minutes to let it sizzle and warm up. The rice is sticky and fluffy. The sweetbreads is really tender and creamy. The spicy yuzu aioli sauce adds the perfect finishing touch to the dish. It was so good I wanted another order of it. This is a dish that everyone needs to order.The grilled meats has two simple marinate options: 1. seasoned with salt, garlic and sesame oil; 2. marinated in Takashi's sauce. Our waiter helped us with the marinate options based on the meats that we ordered. He will also let you know how many minutes to grill each type of meat (on each side). We followed his exact instructions and pulled out our phones to time everything.Kalbi (Kobe cut): MELT IN YOUR MOUTH. This was our favorite of the evening! This was seasoned with salt, garlic, and sesame oil with no dipping sauce needed. Honestly, you can never go wrong with kalbi at any BBQ place. The only difference is how fresh the meat is, and Takashi did not skimp on this part.Tan-saki, Tan-suji & Tan-moto (the tongue experience): This was very enjoyable. You get three different cuts of the tonuge (saki, suji, and moto). I only know the cuts based on time since we forgot to ask him. My favorite is the 30 second one, followed by 45, then 1 minute. The 1 minute per side one was a little too chewy for my liking. Horumon-Moriawase (chef's selection): This includes heart, live, 1st stomach, 4th stomach, and sweetbreads. The heart and the sweetbreads were our favorite cuts.Overall, it was an amazing experience, and we will definitely be visiting again because there are so many other things to try. We kept looking around at other tables, which was a bad idea because we were so tempted to order everything we saw.

It was a great joy to taste the collision of different flavors in your mouth. The beef was melted with just a few bites, and the sea urchin was so fresh that a little bit of sweetness perfectly balanced the rawness of beef with the unique scent of seaweed and herbal leaf. We also had the beef brain (in a home-made tube). With the rich and slightly sweet taste of Caviar ozzed out in the mouth, the creamy brain sauce made the blinis taste like a cake. They also have the A5 grand wagyu beef, which might be a seasonal. And the kalbi, rosu, shio-tan (beef tongue) are my reasons to be back. The meat they served are just so fresh to cook, without a single taste and scent of rawness. And they even have the beef's first stomach, second stomach, fourth stomach, beef heart and beef liver to barbeque.

They must be crazy.Since it just so happened to be a friday night, I called up an old friend and decided to try our luck and get two seats as a walk in. Luckily they had two seats for us at the 1 am slot. We kill sometime at a local bar till they called us and off we went. We both got the traditional beef ramen w/ some spicy sauce on the side. Being most accustomed to the traditional shoyu and miso broths, I didn't know what to expect with the beef one. Boy, was it delicious! The broth was super flavorful and the beef belly, super tender.

100,so9DbXE8FQNoPHkne-BWSg,Vania K.,4.0 star rating,"Dining at Takashi is a lesson in patience, discipline, and moderation. First, you must make a reservation (only parties of 4 or more can make reservations), unless you're cool with waiting a couple hours. The first time we tried to come here, one of our friends flaked at the last minute and they had to cancel our reservation (even though all three of us were there already!). Then, once you're seated, you have to get over your fear of the unknown and let go of, ""I don't eat tongue or innards."" Well, guess what? They have a tube of brain mousse and it's delicious, so get on that. The portion is small but everything is delicious... you'll easily spend $40/person if you eat like a bird, but more realistically, you'll spend about $70-80/person (including a drink). They also serve midnight ramen on Fridays and Saturdays, but don't think about sliding from dinner into ramen, because ramen requires a separate reservation. Then, you have to grill the meat yourself, and there are all sorts of rules (""Don't flip the meat too much, you'll waste the juice"" plus all these different grill time requirements for the different cuts). Also note that your clothes and hair will smell like grilled meat after a meal here: a full shower + shampoo + laundry will be required. But, the meat is totally worth all these idiosyncrasies if you're a carnivore like me. The filet mignon in garlic butter sauce is melt-in-your-mouth tender. The thinly sliced beef shoulder is delicious, tender, and flavorful. Each cut of meat has a different character to it. The only thing I probably wouldn't order again was the uni with raw steak, because the uni overpowered all the other things. It's a treat and I wish I could try the ramen along with dinner!",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"
101,D8VhFaC1TP--RsFjVkpmjA,Jando S.,5.0 star rating,"Grilled meat in any capacity can be a wonderful thing and when done right, it is one of life's great pleasures (#1). In the case of Takashi, Yakinuku guru Takashi Inoue has made his mark in the West Village by showcasing a style of Japanese cuisine that often gets overlooked; becoming one of the most notable and progressive (not to mention delicious) Asian businesses in all of Manhattan and perhaps the most sought after Japanese BBQ spot in NYC.The price point is high, as this is no ordinary WV dining spot. Some would come here for special occasions, many for tourism fan foodie'ism, and many more just because they can afford it. While the portions are expectedly teeny tiny, I can vouch for their quality: Everything will be tasty. Everything will be executed well. Above all, everything is extremely fresh.A love of red meat is a virtual prerequisite, though texture is key for palatial reasons. Amongst the grilled meats, the Kalbi ($26) is almost always a sure thing as well as the Rosu ($26), a delectable ribeye cut. Anyone who is a fan of tongue will surely enjoy the Tan-saki, Tan-suji & Tan-Moto ($25) which has been dubbed ""The tongue experience."" While I haven't experienced much of the intestine or stomach bits, I can vouch for the ultimate option: the Horumon-Moriawase ($30) which is the Chef's Selection. No one can go wrong with this.To the more adventurous side, the raw meats are limited in selection but rich in flavor. The Namagimo ($16) is a delightful surprise, liver was never my strong suit but that's all negated apparently when its marinated in sesame oil and given a dash of rock salt. The Gyutoro-Tamaki ($18) is a raw beef handroll; a chuck flap with some nori and a light garnish of wasabi that screams wonderful with every bite. The most popular dish, the Niku-Uni ($26) might just be the highlight of anyone's meal here. A piece of delicious wagyu chuck on a shisho leaf, nori seaweed bed and topped with ultra fresh uni makes for one mouth-watering bite. It is a foodgasm not to be ignored and as Bourdain once said after an eyes rolled back experience: ""If you don't like this, we can never be friends."" Well said.Other non-traditional items but equally palate potent is a list of seasonal specials that Takashi rotates year round. The infamous KFC ($38), consists of Kobe beef tartare, Foie Gras marinated in white miso, and Caviar from Hackleback is served with a sake-pickled Japanese cantaloupe and toast. It is one of the most expensive dishes in the house for a reason: it's mind blowingly delicious. Honorable mentions include the Squid Ink Rice & Miso Marinated Sweetbreads ($20), Bone Marrow and Crawfish Dumplings ($16), and the Bilini + Caviar combo of a Calf's Brain Cream ($28) served in a tube like some edible science experiment.And yet, there is still a wait with reservations on any given night, tight yet limited seating, and small grill table setup just enough for a small group to enjoy a hodgepodge of fine meat inspired plates. There are only so many places like this in NYC, but Takashi earns its stripes through a myriad of meat dishes that boggle the mind and tantalize our taste buds.________(#1) Sorry vegan friends.

After hearing about Takashi from Anthony Bourdain's NYC Layover episode, I had to have it. My cousin and I finally made a trip to this restaurant for his birthday. It was a Sunday night. We had planned to have an early dinner at 5pm but since they don't take reservations for two we waited as walk-ins for two hours and was eventually seated at the bar. I know some people will balk at the time, but everything about this restaurant was definitely worth it. Since it was a special occasion, we decided to order everything that we wanted without a care for price:Niku Uni - After seeing this dish on Layover, this was one of the things that we had to have. One of the most unique experiences I've ever had in my life. The Shiso leaf and the seaweed gently wrapped the chuck flap and briny uni. It seemed as the chuck was not a primary flavor component but was included for heightening the texture of the Uni. A MUST ORDERTesticargo - The next dish was a riff on a classic escargot dish but instead used beef testicles. One of the more adventurous menu items, the dish was delicious. The shiso garlic butter was fondly reminiscent of an Italian pesto and definitely made the dish.Takashi's KFC - Easily the most decadent dish that I have ever ordered in my life. Layered in a caviar tin was a Kobe tartar, whipped Foie gras, and Caviar. Although it was lavish in every sense of the word, it was not too overwhelming. I could use without the pickled cantaloupe. I would have liked the toast with the KFC alone. Tongue Experience - With the grilled items we started with the Tongue Experience. The order included different sections of the tongue as a sampler. There was the top tongue, middle and bottom tongue. Each had a different texture and cooking time. The unique dipping sauce was great and make sure you get some lemon juice on it too. Horumon-Moriawase - Next we ordered the chefs choice which included heart, first stomach, liver, tripe and sweetbreads. The heart and liver were lightly coating your mouth with succulent umami flavor. The tripe and second stomach was a nice textural balance, not too chewy but had a great snap. The sweetbreads was something on another level. It had all the flavor of beef but had a softer puddling like texture. A MUST ORDERBeef Belly - Seeing this order so many times on Yelp and rated so highly, we ordered this cut of beef. Incredible marbling on this unique cut. I had to look it up so I can attempt to secure it for my own summer bbqs. The beef belly at Takashi's is the perfect example of a perfect cut of steak. Squid Ink Rice & Miso-Marinated Sweetbreads - We finished our meal with a something a bit carby. I haven't had squid ink rice before and it was perfect introduction for me. The rice was slightly sticky and still pretty fluffy. What made the dish was the Spicy Yuzu Aioli. It definitely tied everything together. Starter Salad?: I have to give a particular mention to the lettuce salad that they give when you sit down. Although it looks like a standard cheap dish, nothing about it is normal. Their homemade miso dressing is exemplary and I would love to have it at home.The overall experience here was amazing. I loved the service here, the waitress explained each appetizer that we ordered and individual cooking times for each cut of beef. Being seated at a bar seat, we got to converse with the chefs and watched as they assemble each unique dish. We ordered most of what we saw. Although it was rather expensive, we loved our food and would have no problem shelling out the money for this kind of experience.

We were running a little bit late and they held the reservation for us. Our waitress Yula was an absolute DARLING. After we settled in and perused the menu we ordered 3 appetizers. 1. Niku-Uni: Uni topped raw beef: AMAZING. The perfect bite to start of a perfect meal. Uni was fresh and was the beef and the wasabi just sealed the deal flavor wise. Highly recommend!2. Gyutoro-temaki Sushi: the chuck rolled sushi. Surprisingly really tasty. 3. Beef Schmaltz w/ truffle oil crostini: A nice little bite, not to salty and not overwhelmed with truffle oil.They quickly put out kimchi (perfectly pickled!) and the bean sprouts. Both are refillable btw. The 18 cuts of beef came out quickly and our waitress came by and told us what each cut was each time we made it down a row as well as how long to cook. We went with the salted meat instead of the soy marinade which she graciously brought out to us on the side to dip with. Least favorite part was the liver. Meh. I don't like liver to begin with so that's just me. Oxtail was a bit tough for me to eat due to toughness. The other cuts were all more or less fantastic. You can't really go wrong with beef. Unfortunately, Yula informed us that we had ordered the last ""experience"" as they're no longer offering this :( Wish they did so I could keep recommending it to friends who are heading to NY. All in the bill was less than $300 for 4 people with 2 bottles of soju.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

The balls were chewy and don't really taste like much, but the garlic shiso butter is what hit the spot. It did remind me a lot of escargot, but the texture was just oddly interesting.YookeThe tartare was visually appealing and surprisingly yummy. The chuck tartare was seasoned well and chopped perfectly. The egg mush and seaweed mix was an interesting touch.The BBQ items - Nakaochi Kalbi (between the rib) was marinated in the house sauce and was nicely marbleized. The beef belly was a surprise - simple, good fattiness and full of garlic flavor Although it was good, I didn't feel like it was worth the expensive price. I would also recommend grilling about 15 seconds less than the recommended to get that medium rare tenderness.We also got the last 15oz MEGA Spare ribs - slow cooked for five hours then flambeed In bourbon and barbecue sauce. It was pricey but it was so worth it. The whole preparation was also a show - flambeeing, chopping and serving - all so delicious.The Ramen quesadillas okonomiyaki was probably a big highlight of the night. It was ramen pancake filled with beef tendons and aged cheese and shiso leaf. Everything just worked so well together and after you grilled them slightly, the crunchiness was amazing. I really enjoyed this dish.The homemade vanilla ice cream was rich and yummy.

Could it be the beef broth, which is much rarer than its pork and chicken cousins in this ramen-saturated city? Maybe it's the extreme garlic flavor (I'm a huge garlic head). Or the fried intestines, which added extra texture and umami to the bowl. Or maybe it's because this place only serves ramen at midnight and 1AM, so I'm starving by the time I get there, having had a light dinner in anticipation.Whatever it is, I love it and can't wait to go back.

Considering the cost, cut, and appearance, I expected meat that will melt in my mouth and flavors that will blow me away. Instead we had chewy beef tongue (one of us just gave up chewing) and rib eye that was tough & chewy. The meat was well marbled, but chewy! Flavors were mediocre at best. Considering each item was at least $20-25 for 5-6 small slices, I expected more. Sadly this is restaurant is crossed off my top favorites. Uni with Kobe appetizer is still delicious though.

They sat me next to a patron who was literally a few inches away from me. Aside from the standard greeting, the patron was not very talkative. The grill, which was located above me, was very hot and it was uncomfortable seating there. The only other option was to walk out. Most of the items on the menu were not ready to eat and you had to cook them yourself. To me that defeats the whole purpose of going out to eat. Mind as well just stay at home and cook food yourself. Save a lot of $$$. I ended up ordering all the items that you did not have to cook yourself.Calf's Brain Cream (in tube) with Blinis & Caviar: That was a blast! I enjoy brain as food and this was really nicely prepared. Tasted very rich and satisfying. If you never tried calf's brain before, definitely try it. Yolo. 5/5 Testicargot (Cow Balls Escargot Style): Another winner. Interesting taste. You really have to try it to experience it. 5/5Squid Ink Rice & Miso-Marinated Sweetbreads: They had to cook it right in front me on the grill. Come on. The grill was already freaking hot! My legs felt like I was tanning on a beach. This was rather on the salty side and not enjoyable. Sweetbreads were not that great. They were actually overly done, which is never a good thing. 2/5Bone Marrow and Crawfish Dumplings: It was good but rather expensive for the small portion. 3/5Beef Shank: It was alright. 2.5/5The food was not that bad, but the experience, as a whole, was a fail.

I thought it was worth a try but probably wouldn't pay the steep price for it again. The Kobe Kalbi was amazing. We ended up ordering a second plate for the 4 people. Very tender and great flavor. The beef belly was good and very fatty. We also got the regular beef tongue and beef cheek. The marinate for the cheek was good but the meat itself can be kind of a let down having eaten the Kalbi in the same meal.

118,gNY5zjVXSE0oVSnZ-TFLzw,Jenny Z.,5.0 star rating,"TAKASHI is---- amazing. There's nothing one can write or say that fully encapsulate the awesomeness of Takashi, except that everyone who has been will tell you: You must visit Takashi when you're in New York. Yes, the prices are higher than most Japanese/Korean yakiniku restaurants. However, the quality and vast range of beef cuts and offal speak for themselves. I have had a great many, excellent Korean and Japanese BBQ in LA, but, Takashi is a whole another world. It's not just grilled meat. It's an appreciation for the cow in its purest, most authentic, unadulterated form. Imagine a butcher who loves his craft and displays passion for all things cow, from meat to 4 types of stomach, and other delicious offals. Even if you are not a offal connoisseur, I dare you to step out of your comfort zone and prepare to be amazed.  As you open the doors to the restaurant, your senses will be heightened by Takashi's signature aroma of high quality beef and offal, sizzling at the highest temperature, to utter perfection. You'll leave the restaurant wanting to keep the aromas with you, for as long as you can, I promise. For the grilled meat selection, I have never felt wronged by going with my servers suggestions. They really have a passion for food and know what is good. My favorites so far have been: rosu (ribeye), nakaochi kalbi (between-the-rib), shoulder, BEEF BELLY, second stomach and tsurami (cheeks). Hatus (heart) was extremely interesting. It tasted as it is, a extremely lean muscle, but still very tender to the bite. Although the heart and soul of Takashi is their grill. You cannot skip their amazing appetizers. I highly suggest ordering: niku-uni (shiso leaf enveloping a slice of raw beef and sea urchin), yooke (beef tartar with quail egg and their special sauce), calf's brain cream in tube (just do it), bone marrow and crawfish dumplings. I've had the testicargot and foie gras stuffed mini kobe burger, both were interesting but I wouldn't get it again because they tasted alright. I had big hopes for the testicles, but was left disappointed because it kind of tastes like large fish eyes. Last thing I have to say is that if you haven't already, definitely make a reservation for their late night ramen- served 12am and 1am (by reservation only) on Fridays and Saturdays. My first time having their ramen was when they had just introduced it in early 2014. It was amazing...rich beef broth with beef belly. Absolutely divine. If you're into ramen, I highly recommend calling them to make a reservation (no seating wo a reserv.!) There are 2 options: Grandma spicy and original. I like both, and would recommend trying both, for sure. I've kept this secret to myself for nearly 2 years, and now sharing it with the yelp community. Hopefully that gives you a sense of how much their ramen means to me! Last thing is: make a reservation online. it's fast and easy, will definitely save you a lot of waiting time on a weekday night. Forget about walking in for a seating during the weekend. Takashi is always bustling!

I was a bit skeptical at first but ended up having a great experience both because of the quality of the food and the service. The place is not huge but was able to accommodate a group of 9 people, reservations are a must, otherwise you're looking at a 45min+ wait time. Appetizer: *Niku Uni-Chuck flap topped with sea urchin and fresh wasabi We decided to pick this as our ""raw"" appetizer, and immediately wanted to order anotha one. The taste is amazing, as someone else had mentioned, it literally melts in your mouth. The seasoning and sauce all blend well together, add a touch of wasabi and dip it in soy sauce- eat it using your hand. This is a must, you won't regret it. *Grandma's steamed beef shan This was our 'cooked' appetizer. Beef that is well seasoned, with a touch of spicy mayo on top in a white bun-another great tasting dish. This was recommended by the waitress, and I'm very happy we ended up ordering it Entree/Grill-Kalbi-short rib  -Rosu rib eye  -Beef belly The above three are another definite must. Just a minute for each side on the grill- it'll come out similar to medium to medium well. Kalbi just add lemon, that and the spices are enough to make this a delicious combination. Rosu, 45 seconds on each side, dip in sesame sauce and you'll be really happy. Beef belly too tasted amazing with the sesame sauce. Finally we ordered mignon steak, dip it in butter, then 45sec-1 min on each side then dip in butter for 30 seconds. The meat was tender, almost tasted like a marshmallow; amongst the best steaks I've had.

We were still waiting on one more friend, but they sat us anyway which was great. He took a little while to arrive, but they never pushed or hurried us, which I really appreciated. We all decided to get the original ramen. Below is a breakdown of what I thought of it: -Beef broth: Very flavorful and rich but the garlic was a bit overpowering. I would have liked to taste more beef flavor.-Noodles: I don't typically like straight noodles, but I thought that they worked really well with the broth and had a good texture. -Braised beef belly: They were pretty generous with the amount of beef. I got some pieces that melted in my mouth and some that didn't, but overall it was very tender. -Crispy small intestines: I've had intestines that have tasted stinky before, but they do them well here. It helps a lot that they are fresh and thoroughly fried. I liked them more as a side to the ramen than actually in the ramen itself. (If you ask for them on the side, you seem to get more)-Soft-boiled egg: Nicely done. I wish we had a whole egg instead of half, but at least we got some egg.  I don't know if I'll come back again just because it's a bit out of the way for me and the timing is a little inconvenient, but it was a good experience.

We made a reservation for 5:30 and surprisingly, there was already people waiting for the place to be open beforehand. (I don't know if they take walk-ins though.) We reserved for a party of 6 but one person couldn't make it which they were fine about. Maybe it was better off that way because the tables were pretty tight on space. The seats by the wall were just one bench line, but even if there is a bit of space to sit, the table space isn't that wide. My sister sat between me and her boyfriend and I felt like we were rubbing elbows throughout the dinner. My parents sat across from us on a bench meant for 3, but thankfully we only had 2 people sitting there because it would have felt  quite tight. For starters we ordered the Niku uni ($26) which was chuck flap topped with sea urchin on top of a piece of seaweed. There was also wasabi and soy sauce for extra flavor. I felt like I had high hopes for this dish, but it wasn't as great as I hoped. Maybe because the uni didn't quite taste very fresh to me, so it was a bit of a let down. The other appetizer we got to try was the bone marrow and crawfish dumpling ($16) which was served with a Hong Kong style hot peanut oil sauce. This was actually quite good. I don't think I necessarily tasted the crawfish, but I did taste the bone marrow in it. I wish there was more flavor in the sauce though because looking at it, I thought it would have a little kick, but there wasn't much. (I liked that our waitress asked if we wanted to order enough for everyone to have a piece because the dish only came with 2.)As for the grilled meats, we order the Kobe Kalbi ($26), Harami ($22), beef belly ($22) and shio-tan/tongue ($17). We also ordered 4 bowls of rice with it. The quality of meat is definitely good. They also tell you how long to cook each meat for that's recommended by them, but if you prefer yours more cooked, then you can adjust the time. You don't get a lot of meat in each dish sadly, but each one tasted delicious. My sister was skeptical about the tongue, but she actually enjoyed it after trying it. I think the Harami or beef belly might be my favorite only because I really enjoy fatty meats and the melt in your mouth texture. I would definitely recommend trying this place out, but I don't think it's best to bring people who eat a lot or are super hunger unless you plan to empty your wallet. Our meal came out to about $215 and having 2 large men in our table, I was pretty sure they were not full from the meal. As for the service, it was ok, but nothing too great. When we got to the grilling part, not even half way into it, they had to stop it and add water to the grill. It took some time for it to warm back up and we weren't sure when it was ready. We just felt around and when it seemed pretty warm, we started grilling again. Then someone that worked there walked by said it was good to go. (Would have been nice if they were a little more attentive.) Other than that it was, everything was good. I wish I did read the fine print though because when I paid 20% gratuity was added for party of 5 or more. Sadly I was careless and didn't read the receipt either and tipped again.

Marinated very well we enjoyed most of the meats. Only one we shouldn't have ordered was the oxtail. Grilling oxtail is just not a good idea. Oxtail needs to be braised and not grilled. When grilled it's tends to be tough and because oxtail contains some tendon the tendon is hard to get thru as well. Dessert soft serve was great! Service was great.

Now if you're just like me coming into Takashi to order the Cow Experience, the assortment of different beef cuts, make sure you call ahead for a reservation and have at least a party of four. Sadly, we didn't know and were a party of two. So instead of the cow experience, we ordered the Kobe Beef Kalbi, Beef Belly, and Nakaochi (between the rib meat) which were all fantastic.

The noodles were al dente and straight.  It was pretty good even though I don't like straight noodles.  It had a nice bite to it.  The broth was delicious and had a garlicky beef salty taste.  It had a lot of ingredients in the broth so that gave it a lot flavor which was awesome.  The beef was a thick cut.  It was very fatty and flavorful.  It was also tender like steak so if you like your steak like that, you will like this.  My favorite part was the crispy intestines.  It tasted like pork rinds and was absolutely delicious.  The egg was good and was cooked well, but the egg was not runny and too well done.I would definitely give this place a try if you're a ramen lover.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

We ordered the saki and they have a large selection of different saki glasses to choose from to your liking. We started with the tartare that comes with an egg on top which they mix right at your table. The tartare was delicious and I recommended to get as your starter. The other starter was the famous niki-Uni. It's over beef but the uni is somewhat overpowering in a good way of you like uni. We ordered three different types of beef for our entrees. The ribeye, the filet and one other I can't remember. Each meat has different instructions on how to cook, and what to dip it in. It was all very tasty.For dessert we ordered the one with green tea sauce and a caramel. I prefer the caramel even though the green tea is definitely the more popular.

So we got there at 6 on a Sunday and had a 90 minute wait. The service is great, everyone was very friendly. The food is pricey for small portions- and much of that consists of a few ounces of a variety of cow parts that you have to cook yourself. So they have a good thing going for themselves here- laughing all the way to the bank, I bet. Some of the appetizers are out there- and that is a compliment- I had a problem narrowing it down to the four that me and the wife shared- bone marrow and crawfish dumplings, foie gras- stuffed mini burger with chocolate sauce, cow balls served escargot-style, and raw beef with sea urchin and shisho leaf. All quite good. For the 'grill your own cow parts"" section of our meal, I ordered the chef's selection of liver, heart, sweetbreads and first and third stomach -yes you have a choice of three of the four stomachs of a bovine creature- they don't have the fourth for some reason.

Takashi is a Korean - Japanese bbq joint, serving raw and grilled meat - rib eye to the various different stomachs of cow.If you are an adventurous eater, Takashi will definitely be a treat! They had calf's brain cream and testicles on the menu!!!! For those a bit more conservative, the menu may be a bit limited but delicious nonetheless.   We tried the yooke (beef tartare), niku-uni (chuck flap with sea urchin), and several grilled options (shoulder, beef belly, one of the stomachs, and ox tail).  Everything was fantastic and marinated well. The marinade flavors complemented the variety of meats served. Our party was mixed with both the adventurous and the conservative; so, it was a bit difficult for us to choose what to eat. It might be helpful to go with a group or with someone who eats similarly as yourself.  The service was great! The waitress was very nice and helpful in making suggestions.  The only reason why I couldn't give a full five stars was portion size vs price point.  The portions are on the smaller side and the food is definitely not cheap. I'm wasn't sure I wanted to drop over 20 dollars per plate when trying new things.  Overall, I would most definitely recommend Takashi to my daring friends who want to try something new in the city.  Note: Takashi also serves ramen, which My husband and I heard was delicious.  Unfortunately, ramen is a late night menu item and only available after midnight on Fridays and Saturdays.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

We ordered the testicargot and the uni-kuni (I don't remember the name) to start off with. The testicargot is exactly what it sounds like, testicles escargot style.

Each piece has a unique texture. All pieces are covered with garlic and oil. Nothing marinated. Dessert: they only have one dessert, that is the vanilla ice cream. Very rich and cream. Green Tea sauce was great! Full of match flavor. We also ordered the Uni and meatball in chocolate BBQ sauce as appetizers. The uni was fresh and sweet. The meat ball has very interesting mixed salty and sweet taste. In general, definitely an unique and fun experience. A good option if you have friends visiting NYC.

Indeed- it took a full 90 mins so we left and came back and fortunately they did text us with an update leading up to the time so that was helpful.Everything was nicely presented, original, and straight-up delicious. Yes, it's pricey- but the quality of the meat and cuts as well as the taste is of utmost excellence. I loved the Kobe + Uni, Tartare with Quail Egg, and tongue the best!4 Stars because service was friendly but somewhat fickle, and the whole ordeal in the long-wait makes it a really big time commitment out of someones night as it requires several hours.

If you order meat- get everything in the Takashi marinade- it is so tasty.Lastly the homemade madagascar vanilla soft serve with the ""works"" It comes with different sauces that you can choose from, and we chose the green tea.

This bowl of ramen was one of the best ramen bowls I have had in the NYC area.  The noodles tasted awesome, the broth was very flavorful and not overwhelming, and the beef belly was tender and delicious!  For me, the crispy small intestines only add the idea of eating something crispy in the ramen, as they did not contribute to any type of flavor for me.  I could live without the cripsy small intestines in here and have the same verdict on taste.   Even though this ramen is only offered at two nights a week at midnight, I would recommend any ramen-lover to venture out and try this bowl of ramen at least once.  I know it is an inconvenient time to eat (unless you love to party late) but I personally would definitely come back here for their ramen.  Do not forget what I mentioned about reserving though! This is a must to get in and try the ramen!  Maybe next time I come here I will add the Foie Gras... Decisions... Decisions..",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

It also comes with a bit of edible gold on top. I loved the green tea sauce (if you taste it by itself you can taste the grounded matcha tea leaves). amazingly well done.

Not sure if this was an unusually quick seating, a tourist-repellant tactic, or some combination of the two, but we were sitting in front of our personal Takashi Japanese grill station with sake and soju in surprisingly short order.The ambience is casual with lots of smoke and a Japanese grill at each table. Our waiter was informative & speedy and he had an Australian accent.To start we had the grandmom's steamed beef shank buns (4 stars) and the bone marrow + crawfish dumplings (3.5 stars). Both excellent. For our mains we ordered the filet mignon special (5 stars) and the chef's special (5 stars - a bit adventurous and includes beef heart, liver, 1st and 4th stomachs, and sweetbreads) which was delicious and made us feel like we got the full experience. The filet comes with a mini skillet with butter and garlic cloves to simmer the filet mignon cubes in after searing them on the grill, but we basically dipped everything in it and ate the caramelized garlic cloves like candy. We ended with the sole dessert option of soft serve ice cream + toppings (3 stars), which was a tasty finish.

I loved everything, especially the meats there were marinated.  The server will tell you the optimal cooking time for each meat and you should trust him/her on that.  The meat comes out perfectly tender and safe (I'm assuming) for your stomach.Before you order, you get complimentary kimchi, salad with miso dressing, and bean sprouts.  However, if you want an additional dish of kimchi, it's $2.  A bit much in my opinion.  The service is great and they changed our metal tray like 5x?  It was barely building up and it would be swapped out without question.It's intimate here and I wouldn't come with more than 4 people.  If you're really into AYCE places, this isn't for you because you're eating here to converse with friends and drink.  The meat may not necessarily fill you up unless you're willing to fork out the cash.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

173,HQYdosFMRTQkKmX5Utnqjw,Shani T.,4.0 star rating,"Came here for the midnight ramen, left completely satisfied.Apparently this place is normally a yakiniku (Japanese BBQ) place in the day. On Friday and Saturday nights from 12AM to 2AM, it turns to a cute little ramen joint. the reservation process is pretty simple: the Monday ahead of when you want to visit, you email them at 5PM to get a reservation (full details here: takashinyc.com/reservati…)My friend and I snagged a reservation for 12AM a couple Fridays ago. The restaurant is very small and intimate and I can see how it would be hard to get in here during regular hours without a reservation. We got seated quickly, but we also happened to be one of only maybe two other parties there at the time.The menu is extremely simple, which I actually really appreciated. There are only two options: original, or spicy. I opted for the original since, well, I can't eat anything beyond mildly spicy for the life of me, while my friend ordered the spicy (since she's a champ and eats hot peppers in her sleep, pretty much). The prices are steep, $16 and $17 for the original and spicy, respectively, but the portion sizes are large, the food is good, and you're really paying more for the experience than anything.Service was fast and our bowls of ramen came out quickly. I didn't expect the ramen to be as good as it is, to be honest. The broth is a beef broth, and normally the bowl comes with one large piece of kobe braised beef belly, intestines (I kindly asked for no intestines), and an egg. Extra toppings are pretty much all of those, foie gras ($14 for this extra topping!!!), and you have the option to kae dama for an additional $4.The beef broth was fantastic. It was very light and flavorful, not thick and buttery like it is at Ippudo and sometimes, even Totto. The noodles were cooked to perection with just the right amount of chewiness.What really won my heart though, was the piece of braised beef. This place sure does know how to cook a good piece of beef, which is expected given it's a yakiniku joint during the day. The braised beef belly was so tender and juicy, and marinated / seasoned to perfection. Literally when I bit into it, I could taste the burst of flavor in my mouth.I wouldn't come here too frequently just because 1) I don't think I could afford dishing out $16 for a bowl of ramen too often and 2) my waistline can't afford to keep having a huge bowl of ramen at midnight. I food coma-ed pretty hard after the ramen.A good experience though for those in the area, as the food is extremely high quality.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"
174,rN8ad0KqM_NIN3NuwKr_1w,Kevin T.,5.0 star rating,"While waiting in line at the other really famous ramen restaurant in East Village my friend talked about this yakiniku place that serves ramen late at night for only 2 hours a night twice a week. 10/10 the most hipster bougie thing I've ever heard but I had to have it. Reservations were made for the next night at 1AM. All I could think about was how is it even feasible to operate for 4 hours a week, regardless I HAD to have it. Arriving it seemingly looked like a low key restaurant, really dimmed, and unsuspecting of the glory that was set to unfold. Grandma's spicy ramen ($17) ordered and contemplation of whether or not I'm an idiot for eating a $17 bowl of ramen. Oh man, it was definitely justified, especially after the other place in East Village. Best ramen I've had ever? No. Best in America? Call Good Morning America because I've found a gem in this saturated pool of ramen restaurants. The broth is made of beef bones from their day job restaurant, garlic (lots), ginger, and some other spices. Hold your chapstick because the soup will moisturize your lips with its glistening fatty horumon broth but keep your mouthwash close by, you'll need a lot of it to get the garlic out. It's like eating a extra marbleized piece of beef lightly seared melting away in your mouth with a moderately spicy nutty finish. The perfect al dente bite of their noodles will make any noodle fan come to tears. Take a bite of beef belly that'll just continue the buttery experience or have some of the bacon like crispy fried intestines giving you the texture crunch.

My boyfriend and I traveled around the city trying to get into another restaurant and we could not so we ended up here for a two-hour wait (well worth it though for reasons above). It is also a pretty small place and kind of weird seating/cramped. Side-note: Their bathroom is also pretty weird (one bathroom, one toilet) and small, tucked away at the side and the door is huge.

The feel that the NIKU-UNI is overhyped.  It is visually appealing, and how does the description not sound appetizing?  The Kobe beef used was pretty chewy-- I expected this to be more tender.  The uni was okay-- it didn't taste fresh (you can see the purple vein).  Overpriced for the quality, nothing spectacular. The SPICY PICKLED CUCUMBERS was a nice side to go along with the meats.  I'm usually fan of pickled veggies to be more fermented.  This one tasted fresher, so it didn't taste as pickled. The BONE MARROW and CRAWFISH DUMPLINGS were good too, but not something I would order again.  This tasted like a Canto-style dumpling, except made with bone marrow.  This was served on top of a hollowed out bone, so this looked pretty cool.  I'm not sure if I could really taste the bone marrow-- this was pretty oily.

I came with my boyfriend and had to wait 1 and half hour when we were told it was only an hour wait. What else was two girls that came into the resturant after we left our name on the list said they had a reservation. They got seated for a party of 3 before we did.... How is it possible that they got a reservation?Another thing was we placed orders for ramen quesadilla as part of the appetizers. After our 3rd appetizer was presented, the server came to let us know that the last order of the ramen quesadilla was given to another table..... We turned around 10 minutes later and saw that the order went to the table that came after us.... I really understand how they pace orders... Like this whole experience just didn't seem fair....As for the food, sure the quality of the beef was really good but is it really worth $40 for two slices of beef that's just grilled? Not really... I guess ur just paying for the service n quality. All the appetizers were pretty mediocre. Their crawlfish dumplings tasted like ur avg pork ball in a dimsum restaurant. The niku uni was good but tbh nothing special... Just uni on beef. At the end we ordered the dessert with all the toppings.... The rice dumplings were probably frozen because when I bit into it, it was like solid hard core...

To start, we got the beef tartare and the the pork buns. The beef tartare was delicious- it comes with a quail egg, which the waiter mixes in for you. The pork buns were different than I've had, but were also great. They bring out the bun and meat separately and let you construct it on your own- spicy mayo included. For our entree, we got a special- beef and foie gras. It was absolutely delicious. We also got the Kobe short rib-- which is served with a raw egg yolk to dip in. Yum. The great thing about this restaurant is that you can tell the beef is of great quality. I will definitely be back again. If you have room- get the ice cream.

We had niku uni, beef tartare, beef tongue sampler, matcha maekolli, nakokochi kalbi and fish bone dumpling with bone marrow. The uni and beef was fighting with eachother because both are great things on its own, it was overwhelming in flavor. The beef tartar I liked surprisingly even though it was raw beef. They mix it with a quail egg. Matcha maekolli was a rip off for a cup it was 12 bucks and there was no matcha flavor.. Neither was there much alcohol. The kalbi and tongue sampler was okay, small portions though... The fish bone dumpling was almost a hazard, I nearly choked on a bone... I wanted to keep the bone marrow and doggy bag it but the server said they need it?!?! And he refused to give it to me... I didn't know they reused bones for future dishes.. And I thought I paid for the bone since its in my dish ???

Who thought pour chocolate over a meat ball? I never had something like this, and it was actually good. I came here because my boyfriend came to this place before for his business dinner and he was so excited to tell about Foie Gras Stuffed Mini Kobe Burger with Chocolate BBQ Sauce and their meat. Yes, their meat was excellent. Even intestine was great. However, I felt the portion of menu was small. I will be back if it is business dinner but I will hesitate to go back there if I have to pay by myself. They seems to be Japanese owned restaurant, but I thought how they serve rice was not right.

So this joint only serves ramen after midnight, when the dinner service ends. The ramen comes out looking really intimidating but eats really smooth. I want to start off by saying this bowl isn't so much ""spicy"" in the sweat your ass off sense; it's more ""spicy"" as in - BAM! - flavor explosion. This is a rare (for the ramen world) beef broth that is seasoned, well-balanced, and easy to slurp. It reminds me of a super intense bowl of pho with wheat noodles instead of rice noodles.  Speaking of noodles: they do a thinner version than most other ramen-yas, and they do it really damn well with a great bite. The beef belly was delicious and leaner than the usual pork char siu I'm used to. Intestine is not something I would normally jump at the chance of eating, but the fried intestines they add are super crispy and add some crunch to the ramen experience. By the end of the bowl, I was trying to fish out every last bit! The soft-boiled egg has a much firmer yolk than I prefer. The foie gras - while being an interesting (and expensive, at $14) add on - didn't really add much to the bowl. I love foie but I'd pass the next time.

Cozy, romantic ambiance and $8 wine specials during happy hours - highly recommended to anybody who ends up having to wait for a long time like we did), so it wasn't too bad after all. When we finally got seated by the counter, we started with the famous niku-uni for appetizer - it was delicious, but the shiso flavor was too strong and overpowering that I couldn't get as much of the uni/raw meat taste as I wanted. For the grill, we got the beef belly, kalbi, tongue, cheek and sweetbread. They were all excellent, although the cheek was too rough and chewy for my taste. So overall, it was a delicious and filling meal. But I still have reservations about whether this place warrants such ridiculous wait time and hefty price tag. While they offer a great selection of different kinds of meat and it's fun to grill your own meat with friends, I don't think cheaper, more accessible yakiniku venues in the city like Gyu-kaku are much inferior considering the value (both time and money!). If you insist on checking this place out, however, make sure to come early (maybe 10-15 minutes before they open) or place a reservation for groups bigger than 4!",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

I thought the apps were just OK, I was kinda expecting the apps to be mind blowing but they weren't. If I am not mistaken, I think you have to pre-order The Cow Experience in advance. The restaurant itself is on the small side and the seating is kinda cramped, I do, however, love the open kitchen in the middle of the dining room. Also, there are no signs out front, I think it's the second restaurant from the corner. The staff was Japanese and I appreciate how they were able to guide us throughout the dinning experience. For the Cow Experience, you have the option to go with a salt or a soy garlic marinade for the beef cuts and we chose the soy garlic. I thought the soy garlic was great, it really added a ton of flavor. And overall, I think the thinner cuts came out better than the thicker pieces and the meal is a nice way to try different cuts of the cow but in terms of being full, it was almost to the point of being full with the bowl of rice.The food:Niku-Uni- U.S. Kobe chuck flap served on seaweed and Shiso topped with raw sea urchin and fresh wasabi. This was the first dish that made me want to visit the restaurant and the dish seems rather drool-worthy but it wasn't very flavorful. I thought the Uni with shiso would be one of those dishes you expect to be amazing but all I tasted was the shiso, the Uni was kinda lost and the beef wasn't really pronounced. It's worth a try for yourself, but I wouldn't get this again. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Testicargot- cow balls escargot style with garlic shiso butter. I think this is kinda something you order for the shock factor. And when it comes to testicles, you kinda have to dress it up in a way so it is familiar for people to try. For me, the testicles kinda had a firm squid or firm scallop feel and kinda had a less intense organ-y taste, but the garlic shiso butter was a bit too aggressive, it felt like I was eating an intense pesto. This dish was OK. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Grandmom's steamed beef shank buns with spicy mayo- I thought this was a little underwhelming, it is basically jumping on the steamed bun bandwagon but instead of pork belly, they use beef shank. The meat was OK, but I felt like it was too sweet and should have been more unctuous, I also felt the order was overpriced. It was two buns for $16.The Cow Experience- 16 of their finest cuts from top to tail. It's 4-6 ppl and it's $35 per. The picture was an order for 5 people. It's a grill your own food thing, so there is this raging hot grill in front of you and the waitress tells you how long to cook each item. The staff also does a great job swapping out the grills for new ones to make sure the burned stuff doesn't affect the flavor of the food. Also, the food will make you stink, so beware. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Shio-Tan- This was the tongue and it was perfection, it was so thin, juicy and perfect. You cook it for a minute on each side.Shibire- This was the sweetbreads and you cook this one the longest at 5 minutes a side but it was great. It had a nice outer char and a nice creamy interior. So good. Hatsu- This was the heart and it was super lean, thin and had such a clean beefy flavor. You cook this one a minute on each side and it was perfect.  Kalbi- This was the Kobe short rib and it was as excellent as it looked. The beef was so well marbled and had so much flavor from the beef to the marinade. This you cook 2 mins a side. Angus short rib- This and the Kalbi were similar but the Kalbi was more red in color and the Angus was a tad darker but both were excellent. Cook 2 mins a side.Tripe- There were a total of four stomach pieces and honestly, I really don't remember which was which but the tripe was the obvious one. It cooks pretty long at 2-3 minutes a side and it had good flavor but was a tad chewy. This was pretty good.Kimo- This was the liver and it is not you, it's me. I am not a fan of liver of any kind, except pate but that doesn't count, the beef liver is off putting and is really strong. Kinda had to pinch my nose and chew.Oxtail- I love oxtail since it is so tender and fatty, but only when it is cooked a long time in some type of stew. Oxtail is not ideal for a grill since the meat is really chewy. The flavor was good but the chewiness killed it for me.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

Arrived at 6 pm on a Friday night and the wait was already 45 minutes. So worth it. Try to sit at the bar if you can! Great views of the masterful chefs at work.You can make this meal into what you want. You can play it safe and have some of the best kalbi or pork belly you've ever tasted. Or you can live on the wild side and go for the stomach, intestines, tongue, heart, throat, liver, aorta, or pancreas. We hovered somewhere in the middle.....To begin, we had some fabulous appetizers.1. Bone marrow and crawfish dumplings - rich, hearty, superb2. Uni and beef on shiso leaf and seaweed - best uni I've had, incredibly fresh and creamy 3. Squid ink risotto with sweetbreads - my favorite dish of the entire night. Like nothing I've tried before, the sweetbreads were perfectly cooked and melted in your mouthNext, the meats which we grilled ourselves right on the table:1. Heart - this was our wild card dish of the night. We pushed ourselves to try something  out of our comfort zone. It was surprisingly good. Wouldn't have guessed it was heart at all2. Belly - fatty and awesome, obviously, like all good pork belly3. Cheek - oh, sweet, sweet cheek, so tender and leanWe also couldn't resist getting the homemade soft serve vanilla ice cream with the works - Mochi balls, red beans, powder, gold leaf bits and salted caramel. This salted caramel was on its own level. It had a smokey, bitter taste that made this dessert extremely unique and complex.Service was fantastic  although our dishes were cleared away too quickly at times.

215,fuGAIU8wgV3tXgFdawAUSw,Erika K.,5.0 star rating,"Takashi gets 5 stars because you MUST try this place at least once. I would eat here every week if my wallet and waistline allowed it. All of the meats that we ordered tasted incredibly fresh. My favorite was the filet mignon special, which you would sear on the grill and then poach in garlic butter (really, melted butter in a sardine can with 20 cloves of garlic in it) for 30 seconds. Other favorites were the kalbi and the beef belly (the latter my least favorite, because of the chewy texture. But the others I was with said it was their favorite, because it was so juicy).The prepared appetizers were completely surprising and unique. Loved the Yooke (beef tartare with quail egg), and the squid ink rice with sweetbreads was completely delicious and totally unexpected! The Grandmom's Steamed Beef Buns were so good that they have ruined all future steamed buns for me. (Sorry, Ippudo chicken bun, but you have been dethroned.)The alcohol list is also impressive - pricey, but a nice mix of hard-to-find Japanese beer, sake, whiskey and plum wine. We ordered a pot of makkeoli (Korean rice wine), which was one of the better ones I have tasted in NYC.Attentive service rounds out the 5-stars, although they had some trouble finding our coats on the way out. Agree with previous reviewers that space is tight, so stick with groups of 4 or fewer.We might be more adventurous re: trying new cow parts on our next visit, but you really don't have to do that for a delicious meal.

221,G92QwJztr2rsfOKBiWLGpA,Nikki L.,3.0 star rating,"You have to really watch your wallet when you eat here! The prices add up very quickly and it gets to be as expensive as a fancy sushi place. That said, this place is really for people who are really really into meat, everything is so so meaty. There isn't enough veggies, sides or other types of items to cut the grease, oil, and heaviness of so much meat. Might I add, most of the meat is either raw or only supposed to be slightly cooked (the heat of the grill while hot does not cook quickly).One of the dishes I liked best was the little amount of kimchi they brought out as a complimentary side. The complimentary soybean sprouts and plate of cabagge with slightly sweet mild orange colored dressing was so-so. I liked the niku-uni because the uni taste dominated the dish. It was topped on a slice of raw beef, which was easily chewed in the mouth, reminded me of fresh sashimi, and didn't have much flavor. The shiso leaf and nori also went well with this combo.Of the meats, I liked the pork belly the best, it was the flavor I enjoyed the most. I also enjoyed grilling the filet minon and letting it sit in the small garlic, butter bath before eating it. I liked eating the soft sweet garlic along with the meat.The other meats like the beef shoulder, beef tongue were all good quality but after awhile, the same seasonings of either sesame oil, sesame seeds, and salt or the takashi marinate, it all started to be about the same flavor, just different textures depending on the cut of the meat.I really enjoyed the dessert of homemade vanilla ice cream, the flavor of the real madagascar vanilla beans really came through, it was delightful. The shiratama balls were soft and had a wonderful chewy texture. I think I would come back just for the dessert. The meat is too overpriced and best suited for those who like it on the raw to mildly cooked side. For this type of yakiniku, I would rather stick with the gyukaku chain (it's less meat-a-whelming and less sticker shock.)",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

The meat was all tender and flavorful. The server was really nice and offered to cook most of the meat for us. He also recommended us to try the heart and the liver. The heart was pretty good but the liver was disgusting. It was mushy even after it was grilled. Before you leave, you must try the ice cream with The green tea matcha sauce!

224,o8VqJdeJK6X-RU22hFcWfw,Ed U.,5.0 star rating,"On an episode of his former Travel Channel series, ""The Layover"", Anthony Bourdain was having such a culinary orgasm grilling his meat here that I'm pretty certain I bookmarked it then and there for a future trip east. That was nearly three years ago, and it was kind of a pain to get in here. On my first attempt, I was looking for a late meal around 11PM, but they were technically closed even though the Yelp listing says they are open until 2AM on the weekends. That's because they have a midnight ramen sitting, and you need to make a reservation in advance for that. Say what? I tried coming a couple of evenings later, this time close to when they opened for dinner. Success. I thought I'd be shunted to the counter, but no, I got my own table for four and more importantly, my own grill. Score.It's only one of seven tables in the place and quite a set-up with a huge grated grill with a big heating element and a huge light and vent right at forehead level. The menu was comprehensively appetizing meld of Korean barbecue with Japanese sensibilities. The style is called yakiniku, and Chef Takashi Inouye is very, very thorough in his coverage of the cow. Cow balls anyone? There are parts that would require some experience with a cadaver to know what you're ordering, for example, what's the difference between the first and fourth stomachs? The cheery waitress allowed me time to consider my options by placing a bowl of their Cabbage Salad with miso dressing and a side of seasoned bean sprouts (photo: bit.ly/1pNHtRl) along with their Red Red Kimchi (photo: bit.ly/1qB9nBH). I did know I needed to try one certain indulgence, the $24 Niku-Uni.It was a quartet of raw chuck flaps, beautifully marbled, with fresh sea urchin scooped on top sitting on shiso leaves and seaweed squares (photo: bit.ly/1rXS5mK). Yes, I said it was $24 but absolutely perfect mouthfuls of joy, an unexpected twist on surf-n-turf. The other tantalizing treat was the $16 Bone Marrow and Crawfish Dumplings (photo: bit.ly/1rXS5mK). They sit in the actual bones which the waitress is quick to point out is not edible. She then put on quite a production pouring the Hot Peanut Oil over them and setting them a-sizzle in a furious frenzy. Quite delicious although more meatball than dumpling. No complaints. So I was already down forty bucks, and the meat had not arrived yet. The dishes were cleared and the grill fired up. Time for the carnivery. First up was the $20 US Kobe Beef Belly.Bathing in Takashi's special marinade topped with sesame seeds and scallions, the fresh beef belly was sliced into strips ready for the grill (photo: bit.ly/1nV54Tv). It takes very little time to cook the meat, which I did dexterously with a set of tongs (photo: bit.ly/1m7HpKU). When the beef was ready, I dipped the pieces into a sesame oil dipping sauce that enhanced the flavor. Delicious as I was pounding the rice. Me want mo' meat. So I timidly ordered the $16 Cheek (Tsurami) this time with a marinade of salt, garlic and sesame oil (photo: bit.ly/WSkHAZ). A bit chewier in texture but still quite tasty and I'm finally feeling the capacity point but not before the waitress dropped off the dessert card for my perusal. There was just one dessert, a $6 Homemade Madagascar Vanilla Soft Serve Ice Cream with all sorts of topping and syrup options. Instead of pretending I was going to save calories by going with it plain, I went with the flat $10 ""I'll have it with the works"" option which allowed me to try all three toppings available - rice-flour dumplings, black sesame and soybean flour, and sweet beans - plus a syrup. I went with the salted caramel even though the green tea or the raw wild strawberry sauce would have worked in a pinch as well (photo: bit.ly/UGGKsT). It was fine but probably the east impressive part of the meal since it was just a sundae with a touch of Japanese exotica to make it compatible with the yakiniku. Quite a meal thanks to Chef Takashi focus on offal, not awful, not by a long shot. How can I come back and not try the Tongue Experience?FOOD - 5 stars...the fresh meats and innards and distinctive flavors make the Korean-style Japanese barbecue soar above other yakiniku housesAMBIANCE - 4 stars...not that spacious but I can't complain about a table to myself with my very own grillSERVICE - 4 stars...excellent waitress never rushed me despite a growing queue of hungry hipsters, the host was kinda tense thoughTOTAL - 5 stars...superb execution and fresh meats and offal make this an understandable Bourdain favorite",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

I guess I should've done more research because they only do ramen from midnight to 2am Friday and Saturday. Oh well.We put in our names at around 7pm and were quoted an hour and a half wait. There were literally people lining out the door, even so early. It actually ended up being an hour wait instead, which wasn't so bad. Tons of bars around to wait.So, to our surprise (and due to my lack of preparation), we had a yakiniku meal instead of ramen. You know the deal - you order cuts of meat and they bring it out raw, and you cook it on the grill.We ordered the chef's selection - two types of cow stomach, sweetbreads, and heart. We also ordered the Kobe outside skirt.As a starter, we had the beef schmaltz crostini and the bone marrow/crawfish dumplings.  The crostini was okay, but I could've done without it. The dumplings, however, were super interesting. They bring them out on a plate, and then pour boiling oil over it to finish cooking it at your table. They were more like Asian-style meatballs than dumplings though. And at $16 for three, they were some pretty pricey meatballs. Really good though.As for the yaki, the portions weren't huge, but it filled the three of us up thanks to the appetizers. The skirt steak was probably the best. If you haven't had cow stomach before, it's chewy. Really chewy. Wasn't the biggest fan of that. The sweetbreads were delicious (it's an acquired taste).Overall, the yaki is a bit pricey (the chef's selection was $30 and the Kobe skirt was $18).

If my girlfriends didn't call for a second spot, I would have ordered more BBQ meat. The staff was very nice, we sat at an individual BBQ table, the tables are constructed around a central kitchen where they create appetizers and cold plates. Very interesting set up.

Sex in my mouth. I also tried the bone marrow crawfish dumplings which were delish and washed everything down with plum wine on the rocks. The meat dishes were fairly small in portion but oh so fresh and tasty. The beef tongue was very well marinated which was a plus.

So as promised I came back for the BBQ. when you first walk in to the restaurant, it's a meat attack of your senses. the smell of meat grilling greets you, the tables overcrowded with delicious meats waiting for their turn on the grill and the sound of the meat sizzling excites you. We did two appetizers, the niku uni and the yooke. Amazeballs. The uni comes on top of a raw slice of beef, shiso leaf, and then a piece of seaweed. Roll it up and savor cause it's good. The creaminess of the uni and the soft texture of the beef would be enough for me, but then add the shiso leaf for another layer of flavor.. Well worth the high price tag. The yooke was a beef chuck tartare mixed with a raw quail egg and shiso leaf. Again just absolutely divine. It's just an elegant way to showcase the freshness and add flavor elements that really complement the meat.On the grill we had the tongue experience, the shoulder loin, cheeks, and beef belly. By far the beef belly was the best. You can't beat the fattiness of it. Next favorite would be the shoulder loin for the marinade which was more like a traditional Korean kalbi. Cheeks and tongue would tie and both had great texture. We also tried the rice balls which weren't as amazing as the meat but I think you need something plain to go with all the meats so no complaints here.

I would have preferred each on their own more.  The tartar was also just okay, nothing special.  The kobe beef kalbi was very good but the portions were small.

My brother and I even tried to emulate the Niku-Uni dish with ingredients brought from our local Korean market. This restaurant is smaller in size with 10 table grills available, so it will require some planning to make sure you'll get your opportunity to enjoy the great food here. Fortunately I was able to get my reservation online and was seated promptly and without any difficulty. There is a little bit for everyone at this restaurant, whether you are a meat lover, enjoy seafood, or a curious adventurer. My friends and I decided to share the Yooke, Niku-Uni, Beef Belly, and the Kalbi. I thoroughly enjoyed every dish. Yooke - Chuck Eye Beef Tartare in Special SauceFollowed by your server bringing the plate, they will crack the quails egg over the raw marinated beef and begin to mix it all together. The result is a delicious, savory, and sweet combination. I really, really enjoyed this one and may have been my MVP in tonights lineup. Niku-Uni - Raw Chuck slices topped with Sea Urchin and Wasabi, wrapped in seaweed and perilla A must try dish. I do not believe you will see this dish anywhere else. Absolutely delicious and an interesting combination.  Beef BellyThese are some of the thicker cuts of beef belly that I have tried. Sauced and seasoned with garlic, salt and garlic oil. You can not go wrong with this if you are on the fence between any choices in the grilled categoryKalbi - Short RibSauced and seasoned with garlic, salt and garlic oil as well. You can never go wrong with kalbi!On top of all of the delicious food we were able to enjoy, our server was attentive and courteous enough to answer all of our questions with genuine concern and interest in our dining experience.

A group of four of us came here, and supposedly, were the first people to book the cow experience. For those of you who haven't heard of this, the cow experience is 16 different parts of the cow, at $30 per person, with only three of them available each night. We started off with the following:Calf brain cream - this was a first for me, and I'm glad I gave it a shot. The brain is actually served in a squeeze tube, and smeared on bilinis with caviar. The brains were creamy, and wits flavor similar to liver. With the caviar, it was a harmonious and decedent bite. Get over the fear of brains and order this. Niku-uni - this one didn't quite hit the mark for me. I love uni, and e uni was a top quality part, but the chuck flap itself was not tender, and I found myself chewing it for a while after the rest of the components were gone. Skip this guy. Squid ink rice and sweet breads - this is kinda like a Japanese risotto I guess. I'm a sucker for risotto, a sucker for squid ink, and a sucker for sweetbreads, so needless to say, I loved this. My only comment here is that serving it on a leaf isn't really the best vehicle for delivery, but I'll give it a pass because it was such a good dish. The cow experience. Book this right now because it's just awesome. I can't recall all 16 pieces, but some of them included tongue, cheek, meat between the ribs, tail, heart, liver, sweetbreads, first, second, and fourth stomach, belly, short ribs, and intestines. My favorites by far were the second stomach and intestines. The second stomach is so tender and flavorful, and the intestines charred and fatty. I think we ended up ordering extras of both after. Also, all pieces were in the takashi marinate, and it's perfect. You need no other sauces or flavors. The service here deserves its own commentary. Our glasses were never empty for long, our reminders about cooking time were readily given, and here's when they went above and beyond: one of us had the unfortunate piece of sweetbread (which is pretty slimy and blobby when raw) fall through the cracks of the grill. When we told our waiter, he immediately got us another, no questions asked, no extra charge. Between the uniqueness of the cow experience, the deliciousness of the meats, and the outstanding service, this place is a must and absolutely deserving of five stars.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

The style is Yakiniku: a Korean-influenced, non-traditional method of Japanese grilling that (according to the fun chalk art on the restaurant walls) grew in popularity due to a scarcity of beef after World War II.While we opted for some choice appetizers and specials, Takashi's heart is truly in their Yaki menu (literally). Each table comes with its own small grill, and diners can order à la carte from a premium selection of cuts and organs, all beef. Each dish and meat is prepared carefully with ample attention paid to presentation. The food is as gorgeous as it is delicious - various Instagram shots of the Yooke (a sweet, fresh beef tartare served with a quail egg) was what brought us to this spot in the first place.And how difficult it was to get in! Make sure to come early, because wait times of up to two hours are not uncommon (however, our table opened up after only one). Despite the seating delays and hefty prices, the food and service justify your sacrifices. You may never eat fresher ingredients, and the staff is friendly and helpful along your journey through some of beef's more obscure parts.For those with palates meek and timid, the kitchen also offers some more typical beef dishes such as the Kobe Filet Mignon, grilled at your table and dunked in a boiling garlic butter bath.

Ready for my midnight snack, we came ready to indulge in the bowl of goodness. We had the spicy ramen and woah. Blown away! They serve it to you with everything in its place -scallions on one side, intestines on the other, egg here, spicy paste there. Once they present it to you, you mix it all up and prepare for an adventure your mouth will be dying to go on again. The broth was amazing. It wasn't too spicy, but just the right amount of spice. The beef was to die for. It was so tender and so flavorful and it just melted in my mouth. Takashi clearly knows what they are doing with this. The ramen is a little pricey at $17 a bowl, but definitely worth trying. I will say though, the broth seemed to be very greasy. It was good, but I wasn't ready to drink the whole bowl, seeing the amount of grease that was there.

279,Ty9TOwbKFfXAKxqUUU-qGA,Jimmy H.,3.0 star rating,"I think the main word that comes up at Takashi is underwhelming. A few friends recommended Takashi and of course Bourdain raved about the place. Let me explain why it's underwhelming especially if you come before 7 you have an hour wait otherwise it's 2 hours or more. The grilled meats are of higher quality so you're paying about $25+ for 7 pieces of meat slices that are marinated for a few minutes. I think when you start off the meal with the side dishes of kim chi you'd expect the rest of the meal to go up with flavor. The kim chi basically overpowered everything else.The KFC (Kobe beef, foie gras, caviar) app is questionable as the caviar and foie gras really over power the flakes of Kobe beef. The kobe beef wasn't necessary... perhaps it's there for texture but it didn't add anything to the over powering taste of the foie gras and caviar.The ramen quesadilla is interesting in theory but I didn't taste anything.And the testicle/ escargot sauce was also bland.Perhaps everything is suppose to be bland but comparative to Korean food (it'd Korean inspired Japanese food) it's underwhelming. Again, the kim chi overpowered everything else which was way too subtle. Perhaps a palette cleanser would have been nice for inbetween dishes? Maybe having rice on the side with all meat dishes isn't too much to ask. Also our bill for 2 came out to $170 and we still needed to grab a slice of pizza after.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

Anyways, my tip for the midnight ramen is to get it spicey!!! I did not like the aftertaste of the regular Takashi original, because there was a strange aftertaste. I'm not sure if this is related to the bowls or utensils. My favorite part about the ramen is the crunchy beef intestine, which adds a deep meaty flavor to the broth. The braised beef is also quite delicious. Noodles are pretty standard fare. Overall, this is a decent ramen, but I needed the spice to mask the strange aftertaste flavor. It tasted sort of artificial, so I think this could be easily remedied by changing the bowls/utensils.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

Ever since this place showed on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations, i knew i had to try it. This place is small but they take reservations which is a good thing, just not for people who want to do a walk-in. All three time I've went was a walk-in, quoted about 2 and half hr wait. Due to the natural of people canceling and just not showing up when they were called., our wait time was usually less than an hour. Takashi doesn't have a bar but while you're waiting for your seats, you can actually order a bottle of sake or drink to ease the wait time. Menu has a lot of the lesser eaten parts of the cow which is awesomeee!The MUST get - Niku-Uni ( chuck flap topped with sea urchin and fresh wasabi)- Yooke ( (thinly-sliced chuck eye tartare in special sauce )Both items are raw but the quality is second to none matched by absolute freshness. That's pretty much Takashi's theme in a nutshell.For the grilling session, I'd recommend the Kalbi or the Rosu ( ribeye ). The flavor of the beef when cooked perfectly needs no sauce and the marbling on it is like a meat lover's wet dream . Downside is that you get 4 or 6 pieces ( can't remember) which leaves you begging for more. At about 20ish an order, it can add up. If you're adventurous, give the Testicargot (cow balls made escargot style) a shot. With an updated menu since my last visit, i'll be returning sooner than later.

289,YiujCdygpA4qlH8i9Rx4CQ,CHRISTINE Z.,4.0 star rating,"I came here for the ramen on Friday night--we had 12am reservations, and were running late, but the place was very accommodating. Good start. When we got to the restaurant, we were checked in via an iPad. Since I'd called ahead of time to tell them we were going to be late, they'd already marked us and set up our table. Each table is outfitted with a grill, against a backsplash of cute little cartoons.  The grill is low, so it's easy to hit our knees accidentally. Luckily, our waiter warned us before seating us. The ramen menu boasts two types of ramen, both featuring the beef broth that has been lovingly cooked for 13 hours to maximize the flavor and richness of the beef, the staple of the restaurant outside of their Friday/Saturday late-night ramen hours. The two choices were original ($16), and spicy ($17). The spicy feature's grandma's spicy sauce, a classic Asian spicy sauce that has a distinct taste--it's a tangy chili-heavy flavor, with chili seeds for good measure. They were also offering their menu of sake, of which there is only one hot option, but they did have unfiltered sake. We got a carafe of unfiltered, mild sake ($24) to split between two people. The other two people in our party opted for coke, and a light spritzer drink. Out of the four of us, we got three bowls of ramen. My roommate and her boyfriend were splitting a bowl, since we'd gorged ourselves on apps beforehand at home. But my boyfriend and I each got our own--he got the spicy, and I got the original. Both come with beef, beef belly, crispy intestines, and a soft-boiled egg. The ramen was served in a roomy bowls, the ingredients floating in the rich broth, swirling with grease from the beef and the spicy sauce, when applicable. The crispy intestines had a bacon-y flavor, and I barely registered or considered the fact that I was eating a pretty strange part of the animal. The beef was tender and perfect, melting into the broth and offering it even more flavor. The noodles were fantastic--the perfect ""al dente"" (ramen edition) texture, thin, and springy. They were fantastic for the broth, which was not too heavy. To help you with the amazing broth, you get your own ladle--Takashi's had a square, flat head that was strange at first, but proved to be as efficient as a rounded ladle. I think that the ramen was definitely some of the best I've ever head. Definitely top 2. The only downside is that it was pretty pricey for a bowl of ramen...

We first came on a Friday night but the wait was 3 hours so we passed, came back again on Monday when they opened at 6pm and got seated right away. The restaurant is very small and only take reservations for groups of 4 or larger so be prepared to wait if you are a party of 2! They do provide a free side of kimchi, soybean sprout and salad when you sit down so you have something to munch on right away. The menu is large so look at the pictures of the foods on YELP first or ask questions!! Our server was amazing, knowledgeable and took the time to recommend menu items. We ended up with:1. TAKASHI'S KFC ($38)- this was AMAZING. Salty and savory. TRY THIS!2. BONE MARROW AND CRAWFISH DUMPLINGS ($16)- good but nothing special. Just tastes like the inside of a dumpling to me. I would skip and save the $16.3. NIKU-UNI ($26)- a lot of people raved about this but I wasn't a big fan. Maybe it's the texture thing with the raw beef or the sea urchin which was very strong. It also comes with a side of wasabi and a dipping sauce so there are a Iot of complex flavors. It's very expensive if you don't like the fishy taste.4. GRILLED BEEF BELLY ($20)- flavorful and so tasty. Thin strips that grill in just a minute.5. GRILLED FILEY ($30)- cubed and came with a side of melted butter and garlic in a tin placed in the middle of the grill. They recommend you grill then place the meat in the tin to ""braise"" and then grill again. OMG it was so good.

I watched a couple next to me wolf it down and I wondered if they even chewed before swallowing.I also watched the same couple load their grill with stacks of meat. One of them said, ""Hey this beef is still raw"" (after grilling for 10 s). This is what NOT to do. The Kalbi was buttery rich, well marbled beef with Takashi sauce.

Additionally, and I'm not sure if this is fixable or not, but since you're cooking on your table the heat emanating from the center of the table is overpowering. I attended the restaurant on a double date, and we had trouble hearing the other couple because we had to lean so far back from the table to avoid the heat.

Here, you can get something called The Cow Experience. Imagine that. Not only does Takashi provide succulent portions of kalbi and beef belly for the meat lover in most of us, but it goes a step (or 10) further: you can indulge in myriad other parts of the cow such as the heart, the tongue, the second stomach, the intestines. If that doesn't satisfy your meat lust, not sure what would! In all seriousness though, if you're a little squeamish hearing this (which I don't blame ya), you may be pleasantly surprised. When each type of meat is cooked the right way, the result is something delicious, familiar and far different from the beastly gore that you might imagine. First time I came here, I was blown away. It was years later that I recently returned, and although it wasn't as mind-blowing as I had remembered (typical), the meal was still delicious. I should clarify that if you're looking to gorge on meat, this might not be the place for you. Each serving is quite small, and for the price point, you might as well get yourself to an all-you-can-eat Korean bbq place to satisfy your (bottomless) meat lust. If, however, you want to shock your palate and try something new, go to Takashi! Some of the highlights of my recent meal included the beef belly, which I found juicier than the kobe beef, and the squid ink sticky rice, which was pungent and definitely a specialty you should try.Service was excellent. They are very attentive, I think partly because of how crowded this place gets later in the evening, so they want to make sure you get your fill and leave without delay. Note: they only take reservations for parties of 4+. When we arrived as a party of 3, they tried seating us at the bar instead, which would've been a tad less comfortable than the tables. Then, for some reason, they changed their mind and allowed us a table. This seemed a little stingy. I also noticed there was already a couple sitting at a table that could seat 4 people.

313,pz3Ulbuk7ZiUUbT7oFzmpA,Lori L.,4.0 star rating,"While Takashi has long operated as a yakiniku joint, it was only recently that this restaurant joined in the latest ramen craze to hit New York. Appropriately, Takashi now serves the only all beef-based ramen in the city, and given the outstanding feedback received from multiple sources, I'd only grown more and more anxious as the weeks went by. Getting a bowl of Takashi's ramen isn't as easy as one might assume; it's served only on Friday and Saturday evenings at midnight, and reservations need to be made on the Monday of that same week.Once the reservation gets confirmed, it's easy enough to show up to Takashi the night of. The restaurant is conveniently located in West Village, and although the storefront is small, it's hard not to pass by the growing crowd of waiting guests on an otherwise empty street. We arrived a few minutes prior to opening, and after seeing off the lingering guests from the last yakiniku meal, the staff was quick to make the change over for the Midnight Ramen. We gave our names to the host and were promptly shown to one of the grill tables, which had chopsticks and a large spoon already set for us.There is a menu for the Midnight Ramen that lists the two options (Takashi Original and Grandma's Spicy), although the only difference between the two is that the latter has a generous serving of the special ""spicy paste"". There's also a number of additional toppings and add-ins, such as the Kobe beef belly, kaedama (noodles), and the Foie Gras Sensation, which will add a succulent piece of foie gras to the bowl, although it comes at a rather steep price ($14). I was wary of how overpowering the foie gras addition would be, however, and decided to stick to the Grandma's Spicy Ramen for my order.As for the ramen: The broth was a dark brown and opaque, and flecked with several droplets of oil. The promised nori (seaweed), kasu (crispy intestines), half of a soft-boiled egg, and the spoonful of spicy paste were all spread across the top. At first sip, the broth has an unmistakable meaty, and deeply savory flavor to it, highlighted by the aromatic additions of garlic and ginger. There's a thickness in consistency to the broth which only adds to the richness, yet, each spoonful achieves that difficult balance in pungency and unctuousness. The noodles, custom-made by Sun Noodles, are thinner and slightly wavy, and cooked to a slight al dente so that they complement the rest of the bowl. The kasu, a creation originally from Osaka, are chewy and retain their exterior crispness despite being submerged in the broth and call attention to the many possibilities of offal. The soft-boiled egg is done to a tee, and the luscious beef belly somehow manages to retain both a sinewy yet melt-in-your-mouth consistency, all the while imparting that delightful beef flavor that doesn't get lost in the hours of braising. I've heard mixed responses to the addition of the spicy paste, and I believe it boils down mostly to personal preference. Unlike most rayu, the paste isn't oil-based as it traditionally should be. Instead, it bears more resemblance to the Korean gochujang, which I find is a better addition to an already rich bowl of ramen.In retrospect, it's almost mind-blowing how well Takashi has executed their ramen. Just as the founder, Takashi Inoue, wanted to highlight the influences of his Korean background and Japanese upbringing in his yakiniku restaurant, there's a seamless melding of Japanese and Korean cuisine in each bowl. The focus on the cow, especially the use of the under-utilized offal, is similarly present, and elevated to a commendable point. For ramen lovers and aficionados alike, Takashi's Midnight Ramen is well worth the trip; just make sure to bring your appetite along.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

The only thing is that unlike other Japanese / Korean BBQ in the city, if you are pascaterian or vegetarian, then Taksahi is not a great place to be, the selection of seafood or vegetable is limited.

I emailed them for reservations on a Friday for Saturday midnight and they got back to me really quickly. I had a party of 5 which was a little tight at a table clearly meant for 4 - but no troubles since we fit and there was absolutely no wait, even though our party came split up. I was the only one that ordered the grandma. It was really spicy - I think if I ever came here again, I'd ask for the spicy on the side. I personally loved this ramen. It reminded me of a shin ramen brought to real life (as in non-instant). I absolutely love shin ramen, so I had no qualms. Although I think there might have been too much seasoning - one of my friends likened the broth to not putting enough water in instant ramen. Crispy beef intestines were surprisingly good - wish they were a little crispier if anything. Wish I could afford to spring for the foie gras addition, but as it was, the ramen had enough meat. I would appreciate more noodles, but I'm not sure if it was because of the soju that I just wolfed them down too quickly.Would love to come back for their unique BBQ fare - especially after feeling adventurous with the crunchy beef intestines.They take credit cards, but not Discover fyi.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

336,tTneuRhmRJ6mzERgAIZo6A,Amanda S.,1.0 star rating,"This review is specifically about our latest experience at midnight ramen, and not about food.We've been here before, so we were excited about our reservation tonight. We decided to leave home to arrive right on time for our midnight reservation, and walked in at 11:51. Someone walked in right in front of us and asked the bleach blonde hostess if she could change her reservation for that night to include a bigger group. The hostess was super accommodating and said that there would be no problem. Then she turned to us and we gave our name to check in. We sat down in the waiting bench, expecting to be seated shortly, but the hostess came up to us and told us they weren't ready and that we could either 1) wait outside the restaurant or 2) get called when they were ready to seat us. We asked how long that would be, and she said midnight. Keep in mind that the restaurant was empty at this point, and midnight is a couple of minutes away. Surprised that we were virtually being asked to leave, we said we'd take a walk around the block and come back in a couple of minutes. We did, and were at the door again at 12 sharp. Plenty of people had been seated in the five or so minutes it took us to return, including the table that had more people suddenly added to the reservation. Feeling more than a little annoyed, we were ushered in and led to a table with two other people sitting. For some reason, instead of spreading out the people who arrived, we were all clustered together and the middle tables left empty. When everyone is wearing thick layers, you can imagine how awkward it is to be seated so close to a stranger when the place is filled with other empty tables. The couple beside us didn't seem happy, and we soon discovered ourselves why. The table that had new additions was being incredibly noisy, shouting out at random intervals and loudly singing along to the music being played. This is not particularly enjoyable when you're in such a small place and people (like the couple beside us) were clearly trying to have an intimate dinner date. I honestly felt bad for the couple, since they were dressed so nicely and had clearly been very on time to the reservation. At one point, the noisy table got so noisy that the couple sitting beside them asked to be moved and sat down elsewhere. I saw the waitress apologize to them for the noise, but maybe asking the noisy table to quiet down would've been more effective. We also noticed that the service was less than steller. Maybe it's because we are close to the holidays, but some of the waiters were not acting very appropriately. I saw a waiter slap the butt of a waitress right in front of me (!!!) and it seemed like this same waiter/manager was giving somewhat of a special treatment to a table at the corner that had his friends. They were the only ones with a table to themselves, and when they left they all took their coats from a cabinet on the side. Everyone else in the restaurant had their winter jackets resting uncomfortably on their laps or wrapped around their backs on the booths. If coat check was available that night, no one else was told about it.Every other experience I've had at Takashi has been very positive and with great service, but tonight was very disappointing. I don't know if everyone was already in a Christmas mood, but if they weren't ready to give as good a service as every other night, maybe they should not have been open today.

First tip: Get there early, even if you're not hungry because the wait list will already be around 1-2 hours even 30 minutes after they've opened. The place is not big, and you don't have to wait there. There are plenty of things you can do around the West Village while you wait. Once you finally get in, you're in for a tour of japanese delectable bites (grilled and not grilled). You're served some kimchi, bean sprouts, and cabbage while you mull over the menu. For appetizers, we ordered the Niku-Uni (one of the most popular items on the menu), and the Gyutoro-Temaki Sushi. My boyfriend advertises himself as not one for raw stuff but he bravely gulped down two of the uni's. The meat sushi was more up his alley though. He enjoyed that thoroughly. For grilled meats we ordered a total of four plates: Kalbi short ribs, Ribeye, Shio-Tan (tongue), and Harami (outside skirt). You get to choose how the meats are marinated, we chose the Takashi sauce. We also had a side of the Bakudan, which goes well with the grilled meats, as everyone has mentioned previously :)Everything was amazing, from the food to the service :)  To top it all off, the dessert, as simple as it sounds, is madagascar vanilla ice cream. Get it with the works and choose a sauce. I got the salted caramel, while my wonderful boyfriend got the green tea. I love green tea, and his ice cream was great but omg, i think the salted caramel was even better :) Btw, they also have a bathroom with a heated toilet seat lol.

We had Momofuku for lunch and Soto sushi for dinner on Friday....but Takashi was BY FAR the best food we had all weekend. And it's definitely one of the top dining experiences we've both had. (We're both big foodies and are very open to trying all types of food)Reservations:We called at 5:30pm-ish Saturday and they said they had no openings but offer walk-ins for 2 or less. She said she recommended we come in sooner rather than later. Well, I'm a girl and there is no way I'm not getting dolled up for a night on the town in NYC. By the time we got there at 8pm, there was a 2 hour wait. We just went to a local bar and had a few drinks until 10pm. Make reservations!!The Restaurant:You walk in there and the smell of korean barbecue captivates you. Not your typical K-BBQ smell that makes you worry that you're going to leave with stinky hair. I was drooling before I was even sat. It's very small and intimate. Great for dates!The drinks:We started with a bottle of soju. It warns you on the menu that it's ""not for the faint of heart"". We said meh and ordered it anyway. It tasted harmless but definitely caught up to us later on that night. I'm pretty sure the soju is the reason why we ended up at an afterhour karaoke bar that night!The food:I loved everything we ordered.Beef sashimi and uni with shiso leaf- the beef was so fresh and the marble was beautiful. I have had a lot of uni in my life and this uni was definitely up there in quality.Sweetbreads-It was so creamy and tasted so fatty, you want to feel guilty eating it. But don't feel guilty. Eat it!Liver- I love liver so it's very hard to unimpress me with any type of liver. This was wonderful and it had that tad of bitterness that I love in a liver.Kolbi- you just have to order this here. It's a staple BBQ and it was also great.The service:She was the sweetest server I've ever met. She was extremely down-to-earth and helpful in suggesting items on the menu. She even asked us about our plans for the night and gave us suggestions for local bars. We were more than glad to give her a fat tip.When we left, we ran into Takashi himself chatting with a friend outside the front of his restaurant.

And I didn't even know they only served ramen after midnight on Friday and Saturday. Although, I was really hoping for bbq and ramen.. but I guess I'll have to come back for the bbq. The ramen itself is an all beef broth with beef belly and beef intestines. I got the spicy ramen with the foie gras sensation for a total of $31. The most expensive bowl of ramen I've ever had but sadly, not the best. It was still good... The foie gras was very fatty and was marinaded too much. The broth was flavorful but too oily. I was hoping I wouldn't get a stomach ache as I was eating it. The intestines were yummy but didn't come with much. The egg was spot on. The beef belly was yummy. It's a big slab of tenderness.

It's completely overpowered by the uni.The chefs selection was a scam. None of the cuts (all offal) are enjoyable when grilled. Liver is easily overcooked especially when in tiny slivers like everything else at Takashi. Stomachs end up being way too chewy unless you undercook them. Tongue experience was unimpressive and skimpy. Your average yakitori spot can do it just as well.Kalbi tasted fine but you're better off at Kbbq since you'll get thrice the quantity plus banchan for the same price. Service was good despite the hourlong wait. My waiter was super friendly and knew his shit.

Reservation is a must and goes pretty quickly. Email your reservation on the Monday of that weekend after 5pm. Replies are very prompt. I've been trying to get reservations to their ramen eats for a month til I finally got one. Sending reservation email after Monday will definitely be futile as I learned after a couple of attempts lol.It's a basic menu. Original ($16) and Spicy Miso. You can add extras in it such as foie gras or beef intestines. No sides. Just ramen. Unlike most ramen in town, Takashi's is beef based. I love pork belly but the beef belly that came with my ramen was too die for. So tender and tasty. And the $14 add on foie gras was aptly called foie gras sensation cause it was sensational. Worth every penny. Super yummy! No other side dish is needed. Pork bun? What is that? My ramen satisfies me enough.

Knowing that would be tricky, I called the day before and asked if there would be much of a wait if I showed up when they opened at 5:30.The person on the phone said showing up at 5:30 should be fine, so off I went the next day.At opening I was given a wait time of 90-120 minutes.Turns out the person on the phone was just wrong - not only was there a line of people outside at 5:30, but only a small handful (maybe 6 total) were seated before the rest of us were turned away. We couldn't wait inside either.I overheard someone asking why this was, and being told ""The chef has special guests"", and thus letting in quite possibly only 6 people with nowhere to wait inside.I don't mind making a reservation or waiting a bit for a restaurant, but the way this place handles reservations/wait times is not worth the hassle to me. I tried calling in advance the day before, etc etcI also get why they can get away with this, but in my opinion there are plenty of high quality restaurants in New York that don't require going through that process.If I had simply even been told on the phone there would be such a wait at opening due to 'special guests' I would have been happy with that as well.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

Please. Don't.It is for people who are like adventure in their food! Try Cow brains! Cow Testicles! Cow Stomachs 1-4! Cow Cheeks (which we found to love and order often!). I sampled everything. They have meatball foie gras with chocolate (which is pretty good!). From the cow brains to the different types of stomach I can say so much about it.  The only dessert they have is their soft serve vanilla ice cream which you can top with a few things.

I thought the skirt steak was okay... Prefer the kalbi. The spicy cucumber was also a nice vegetable to have along with the meats so you can cleanse your pallet a bit. The ambiance of this place is really nice for small groups. Don't recommend for dates since some of the best meats come with garlic sauces. Also you'll smell like bbq meat after dining here (it's inevitable with yakiniku). This place is definitely better than the chain most people go to - gyu-kaku.

For the harder to cook things like the skewer sausage which was my fav, they cook it for you as it takes about 10 mins and different positioning. The rice they give you is also out of this world, its fluffy soft and not the dry crap you might be making at home... or is that just me?We got one app, Uni Beef Sashimi on seaweed was insanely good and the raw beef really complemented the taste and texture of the uni (and they give you a TON of uni). Each order is 24$ and comes with 4 pieces. We had 5 people but they generously gave us another.Dessert is a must have, their ice cream with red bean and your choice of caramel or green tea drizzle is amazing...Somehow they make their ice cream taste amazing and actually sweeter than what it should taste like.

We tried them all (party of four) and they did not disappoint. Only item I personally found that really didn't kill me was the raw Kobe with sea urchin. Mildly disappointing in that it seemed overwhelmed by the seaweed it sat on but it wasn't bad. Just didn't rock my boat. The service is impeccable, the atmosphere comfortable and casual--and lively!

Therefore, it's no surprise that Chef Takashi is an ethnic Korean from Osaka, and he has graced New York with this special delicacy from his hometown.The menu has a lot of options and can be a little intimidating, especially if you don't know what to get because too many things sound good (as was my table's case).  To make it easy, we simply let the staff handle the ordering decisions for us, and we were not disappointed.  The selections were brought to the table one at a time, with each new offering seemingly better than the last.  And thanks to the amount of Soju I drank, it's too difficult for me to recall all of the dishes that were consumed over two hours, however, some honorable mentions include the Calf's Brain Cream (with blinis & caviar), the Yooke (chuck eye tartare in special sauce), the Niku-Uni (chuck flap topped with sea urchin and fresh wasabi), the Tsurami (cheek), the Tongue Experience, the Tetchan (large intestines), and lastly, the three stomach choices listed on the menu.  As for some other details about the restaurant...  It's not too big nor too small, but is warm & inviting and has a very Japanese feel thanks to the extensive use of wood throughout the interior.  The service is first class.  Again, we had the staff make our ordering decisions for us, and they were extremely attentive and friendly.  They also went into great detail explaining each dish along with recommended grilling times, etc.If you're adventurous and looking to try something new that will be memorable and delicious, definitely consider Takashi.  I'm already planning my next visit!",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"
370,VTAvigWsnigry307jj91mA,Denise W.,2.0 star rating,"This review is for the midnight ramen only. There's only two options for the ramen, a spicy $17 and not spicy $16 version. Since I was doing the $14 Fois Gras Sensation add on, I didn't want to risk too much the chili paste overpowering it so I asked for it on the side. Surprisingly on the side meant $16 regular + $3 Grandma's chili paste add on meaning it cost me $19. That plus the Fois Gras Sensation + $14 is $33. The chili paste on the side was very peppery and overpowering so I only ended up using 1/2 the amount in the soup. It was very thick and difficult to mix as the broth wasn't that hot. The Fois Gras Sensation is a grey gelatinous blob. I'm not sure if it was cooked enough or just a bad cut. It doesn't taste like any fois gras I've ever had and wasn't pleasant. It was also cold in the middle. I pick up flavors as if it was marinated in some sweet wine and soy as well. That texture of grey gelatin with the sweet alcoholic undertone is gross. The thin noodles were cooked well and the beef broth was very flavorful. I wish the temperature had been hotter. The braised beef belly was very delicious, tender and falling apart with the cut having the perfect balance of lean and fat. The crispy small intestines added a nice texture to the dish and the pieces that weren't completely folded into the soup had a nice crispy crunch. The first server was nice and asked if I was there for the first time and explained the menu to me. A different server took my order so I'm not sure if the first would've just charged me for the spicy and noted chili on the side instead of the +3 up charge for the add-on but be careful about that. You also need to ask for your water to be refilled every time as you will not get any no matter how empty your glass is and how many times they pass by your empty glass. The broth really shines and I just wish everything else could be better.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

When people know you are a foodie and your cousin and one of your best friends want to take you to the same restaurant on different days without talking to each other, you know the place has to be good. Takashi didn't disappoint! It's a small place, reservation only for parites of 4 or more and they are booked weeks in advance. We waited for over an hour and a half but it was so worth it. You essantially grill your food. Their food was super fresh and their service was great. They source their beef from the northwest and it's worth it. Takashi uses every part of the cow and they do it marvelously. Every dish I had had great flavor. I grilled my meat and only put a little bit of salt and pepper only, it's all it really needed.

All the Kobe beef dishes were excellent as was the chef's choice organ meat platter. Highlights included the foie gras stuffed kobe beef meatballs with quail egg and spicy chocolate sauce. It was the perfect 2nd-last course (kind of pre-dessert). Also, the Niki-Uni was delicious (a sort of kobe carpaccio with uni and seaweed), and of the chef's choice organ meats, the beef heart was perfect and the 1st stomach was far more tender than the 4th.

379,TWa_2qt7bZkye59fmvIcGg,Valery C.,4.0 star rating,"Yaki = barbecueNiku = meatTakashi is the best yakiniku restaurant I've been to in NYC; it just does so many things right.  First off, its small, a proper size for a place specializing in one style and focusing on making it well.  The attractive dining space has a central prep area with bar seats to look in on the action, and one row of tables along the perimeter.  Sleek and simple, utilitarian yet handsome.  Gleaming electric grills set into the tabletops and a thin, black vent that you can pull up or down over the grill (complete with an adjustable spotlight).  Along the biggest wall is a blackboard just as large, the de facto guide to the meat options, as friendly to the offal-shy lay public as it is to the diehard, food adventurer.  The descriptions and sketches are cheery and whimsical, not encyclopedic, and do more to convey the idea rather than the details.  Makes for fun reading.The short menu celebrates all parts cow, and if you're open-minded, it is in so many ways awesome.  Want to try the first stomach?  What about the second?  The third?  The fourth??  Creamed brain in a blini?  Raw liver?  Cow balls?  Achilles tendon? Aorta?  I was so taken with the menu that it was almost impossible to decide what to order.  And although the portions are small, all that meat and meat parts fills you up quicker than you think.  It seems I am destined to go back again, at least until I've tried most of the offerings.DIY beef shank was juicy and intensely flavored, tucked inside pillowy buns.  Stewed beef tendon casserole was rich and satisfying.  The mini kobe burger looked more like a giant meatball; the fun starts when you take a bite of it, stuffed with foie gras  and doused in a chocolately sauce.  Niku-uni was a particular highlight: nutty uni sitting on top of a slip of raw beef, topped with grated wasabi.  Uni is a chameleon food that I've had wonderfully paired with so many different flavors and textures, and here it impresses no less paired with the bracingly fresh beef.  And later added to our order as we spotted it on its way to another table, is the gorgeous yooke, a tartare of thinly sliced, raw chuck seasoned with sesame oil, garlic, soy, sugar, egg yolk, lemon, and possibly more; I am still dreaming of the luxurious mouthfeel of this one.It is worth pointing out again that the beef here is astoundingly fresh, beautiful to behold; it justifies the effort made to source such high-quality meat and the price charged for it.  In its raw form, it is sublime.  Grilled, it can be had simply seasoned with salt, garlic, and sesame oil, or marinated in their sauce; we went with the former to better appreciate the meat's intrinsic flavors.  Mind you, this is DIY cooking; you'll get the tongs and the meat, some pointers on how long more exotic stuff should be left on, then you're on your own (although I'm sure their staff will hand-hold if you needed it).After some debate over the blackboard descriptions of the four stomachs, we tried mino (1st) and akasen (4th), don't ask me why because it was confusing enough to get four people to decide based on their loopy descriptions.  Suffice to say both these were very, very chewy, giving ample time to savor their respective flavors.  I personally liked the fourth better, but liked the flavors for both, but the chewiness is putting an end to a repeat in the near future.  The tongue experience (three types) was also interesting, but in the end, the textures were not appealing enough to me.  The marbled, tender cheek was universally loved.  Decadent fatty belly to finish, like butter.Highly recommend that the sides don't get overlooked.  Their refreshing scallion vinaigrette salad, generous topped with shredded seaweed and sesame, was a perfect foil for the meats, as was their fun ""Bakudan"" dish of Japanese rice rolled up in Korean seaweed or pickled sesame leaf (the latter could pass for a tubby stuffed grape leaf).As we wound down our meat orgy, the efficient staff cleared out all the plates, shut the grill, and pulled up the vent.  It seemed criminal not to have their single dessert to end, a vanilla soft-serve with your choice of interesting toppings (rice-flour dumplings, black sesame and soybean flour, azuki beans, hoji syrup, green tea syrup, salted caramel syrup, and goji berry syrup).  Or just have them all, topped with gold flakes.  Its enormous, and we shared it just fine with four.Reservations advised, and a max group of 4 would be most comfortable.  Don't wear nice clothes, you will smell like BBQ when you leave.  Grilled meats portions are perfect for a group of 4 to try a bit each, but at $12 - $24 per item, it will add up.  Not too extensive of an alcohol list, but a good selection of sake, shochu, and beers to go with the BBQ. Looking forward to my next round of raw and grilled meats.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

383,aZ0cYfZfOmdvXga3qRhDzQ,Donald K.,5.0 star rating,"I finally got the chance to try one of the fabled late night ramen spots of NYC. Takashi Ramen is a weekend night only ramen spot. BBQ spot by day. Ramen by night. The menu is only available Friday and Saturday nights from 12am to 2am. Reservations are to be done the prior Monday via email starting at 5pm. Reservations were easily made, and they were very accommodating when at the last minute we added another person. In a world of 2 hour ramen waits, this was a welcome change.Takashi's decor is sleek, but with a bit a whimsy added with the multitude of chalk drawings adorning the walls educating you on the ins and outs of Japanese bbq. The space is small, and tables obviously more suited for their day job, but suitable enough for ramen service. Only complaint was that our table was definitely not big enough for our party of 6, or even our original party of 5 for that matter.Takashi's ramen is full beef broth ramen. Something I have grown a huge liking to lately. It really helps you stand out from the crowd of tonkotsu and shoyu. Add to that a piece of delicious beef belly, intestines, and Grandma's spicy paste and you now have one of my favorite bowls in the city. The only complaint I would have is that Grandma's spicy paste isn't spicy at all, but it was damn flavorful. The girlfriend also took them up on their option for some foie gras in her ramen. At an additional $14 dollars, it made for the most expensive bowl of ramen I've ever encountered. Yet she will be the first to tell you that it was worth the $30.Takashi Ramen is a place I would definitely love to frequent. The bowl definitely delivers on all counts.

384,_FA9pDMS6sy0y4kzW5vVUw,YuQuan T.,5.0 star rating,"The atmoshere:The place is dim lit with a tiny light overhead on each table which makes it great for intimate or small group occasions. Each table also has a cool industrial looking exhaust fan to reduce the food grease smell that gets on clothes.The service:The hostess does a really good job at responding to reservations and accommodations. Even with changes in party numbers they were quick to change but it also helps to plan things early like with most places. The waiter/waitressed are attentive to all our needs without being bothersome. The small square walking path in the restaurant makes it very easy for them to check to see if we're doing okay. They've also been very helpful in explaining the dishes and offered possible recommendations based on size of portions. The food:Their Ramen is one of the best I've had in New York. It's different from all the other ones because they use a beef based broth instead of the usual pork or chicken. To go with the beef broth, instead of the usual pork cha shu, they use their wagyu beef. It was so tender and soft with an amazing smokey fatty flavor. The noodles were a nice Al Dente chew. If you have the money for it, try the Foie Gras topping as well. There's only 2 options to go with - the regular or the grandma spicy. if you want to try the best of both, just ask them to get the hot sauce on the side and you can add it in as you eat.Their grilled food on the other had was a bit expensive. Most plates end up costing about $3-$4 for a sashimi sized slice of meat with about 4 pieces per plate. If you have the money it's great for a splurge but otherwise I think most korean / chinese bbq places does a better job in terms of quantity over quality. Overall, it's a place i find myself coming back to again and again for the Ramen.

(we came in at around 9pm)WHY is it stated that they are open until 2am when they close the kitchen early and then reopen hours later for a ""soup only"" menu and WHY do they tell people they are welcome to come in at anytime when they turn you away? I fully understand that this restaurant got popular after being on the show and that for this reason reservation maybe necessary but please don't tell people they can come in and then TURN THEM AWAY AT THE DOOR acting like we are crazy for not making reservations.  Truly disappointing.Because of this rude and indifferent lack of-service am not longer interested in trying this restaurant.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

Alas, we were seated 120 minutes later. A 2 hour wait sucks because you really aren't sure how long you'd actually wait. What if someone is a fast diner and our wait is shortened? We decided to go to a nearby bar and just wait it out. By 9:30 we were starving. If you're going to have wait times for a party of 2 upwards of 2 hours--you might as well offer reservations FOR EVERYONE. But on to the good stuff. Food was truly delicious. We ordered the very popular Niku-Uni: very flavorful and fantastic. Bone Marrow and Crawfish Dumpling: tasted like other dumplings I've had, meh. Kalbi (short rib): loved it, must try!

At no point did we feel rushed and we were able to enjoy each part of the meal at our pace.I sat looking at the large warning sign with a silhouette of a cow on it, I didn't really get it until I saw the sign, from my experience Japanese do not eat a whole lot of beef so when they do they explore the small cuts of every part of the cow and discover the flavor of each part.  That's what Takashi is to me, beef by nature is a luxury in japan, and Takashi takes the time and energy to translate the experience of japanese beef eating in america where beef is plenty, I learned to slowed down and enjoy the flavors and textures of each parts of the meat, it's an interesting and delicious experiment.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

C.,4.0 star rating,"To celebrate some good news, we decided to grab some meat at Takashi, a place which so craftily served us some delicious beef ramen just a week or two prior. For the run down on that, scroll down to the bottom of this review, or check out The Great Noodle Chase post on my website.This time around we wanted grilled beef the whole way. No broth. No noodles. Just the protein. And that's kinda what Takashi is all the fuck about! They ONLY serve beef. No pork. No fucking chicken. BEEF. And not only that, but it's all top notch kobe quality, and they ain't afraid to serve up the nasty bits - the offal. Fuck... This place even has testicles on the menu, and they have no shame in putting the words BEEF BALLS on the fucking menu! Needless to say, this fucking place is made for guys like me.First came some small dishes of Kim chi, bean sprouts and cabbage with soy ginger dressing. Yeah, I ate it...Next was the raw sea urchin on top of a nice slice of kobe chuck flap with wasabi, shiso leaf and seaweed paper. This dish is called niku-uni. It was really clean and delicious. I could easily eat a dozen of these shits, no problem.Then came the soft beef shank steamed buns with spicy mayo and scallions. These were tender and juicy, and fucking packed with bold flavor.Then there was this awesomeness. Aged kobe prosciutto (whaaaaaat!?!!) with thinly sliced blue cheese and micro scallions, topped with a soy hazelnut honey mustard seed jam. It was earthy and robust. The characteristic aged flavors were highlighted with a nutty, funky-ass barnyard kick from the cheese. Yet it didn't destroy the pallette. Props to the chef.Then the grill heated up and the meats came out. Essentially the grill is just a heater coil element like what you have inside an electric oven. I think NYC has some shitty law that bans open flames in dining areas. So this is not technically the traditional open flame yakatori style you find in Japan, but it did fill the craving for grilled meat.All of the meats were marinated in the house special Takashi sauce, and served with a small dish of sesame oil for dipping. They could have maybe brought out some lettuce leaves to wrap the meat, or a crunch element like fried crispy onion or shallot to sprinkle on top. The meat by itself was good, but I can see how maybe some people would want to mix up the textures a little bit.Beef belly was the first plate of yum to come. Delicious. Not too chewy, not too fatty. It was cut about a quarter inch thick.We ordered the chef's selection of meats as well.Here's what came in that plate:The front left is 1st stomach (cows have 4 stomachs, morons). It was chewy, and we were warned that this would be a lot of mouth work to get through. Why even serve it this way, I wonder? Better to braise it slow and low I would think.On the front right we have beef heart. It cooked up like a very lean meat: good for a nice quick even sear.The back right is 4th stomach. This was way more tender, thicker, juicier and flavorful than 1st stomach.That's liver on the back left. This was my least favorite. It was gamey, mealy, and very irony. I guess for my taste, liver is best served in pate form.In the center are the sweetbreads. These glands were creamy and smooth. Very nice, with a great crisp.The last meat we tried were the cheeks. This was the best of them all. It was sliced thin like bacon, and they crisped up nicely on the grill. Perfect.Then we saw the table next to get the nose to tail beef platter.Fucking bastards. We asked for it when we sat but they said we needed 4 people to order. Bullshit. We definitely could have finished it all, and I wouldn't have minded paying 60pp for two instead of 30pp for four. Oh well. Maybe if there's 4 of us next time...Dessert was Madagascar vanilla soft serve ice cream, topped with soft chewy mochi balls, soy powder, sweet red beans, gold leaf and salted caramel sauce. Thankfully the sauce was served on the side. It was too bitter for our liking. The ice cream itself was great, and good with the sweet beans.Pretty solid meal. It was a little pricey, but definitely enjoyable. I'd definitely go back to try out some more shit.MIDNIGHT RAMENReal deal beef ramen DOES exist. I heard about some late night ramen joint in the west village called Takashi that serves up an all-beef broth ramen on Friday and Saturday nights only, from 12:00am to 2:00am. It was tough, but I ended up getting a seat for my wife and I to slurp up some of this delicious shit. We started with some beer and took in the surroundings:As I mentioned, it's a beef broth, but it contains crispy beef intestines, FUCKING BRAISED KOBE BEEF BELLY!!!, a soft boiled egg, and alkaline ramen noodles. The little blob of red you see in the middle is the spicy paste that my wife got with her bow",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

Sure, the three of us (with alcohol) dropped over $200, but you know what?  It was totally worth it.I'll definitely be back!",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

We were given no option only to sit and wait another 30 min for the next table. A simple ""so sorry about that, how about a drink on us while you wait"" Would have sufficed. My boyfriend and I have been here 3 times before and spent upwards of $300 and they can afford to lose customers like us because  of their numbers- regardless of treatment.This is a perfect example of a Resturant that is doing very well because they serve a great product but their ego ultimately  destroys the joy of eating there.Go here is you want good food and to be treated poorly.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"
410,1I_jNVfhBDyARQCc5XkWEQ,Susan Z.,5.0 star rating,"Takashi is my new favorite restaurant in NY. It's absolutely amazing for those of you who are looking for something adventurous and off the beaten path. It's also a super fun date spot if you're looking to impress a foodie who has tried it all. Who would have though that raw meat would be so decadent and addicting...?Here's what I usually get:RAW: Niku-Uni - uni (sea urchin) on top of raw chuck, shiso leaf, and seaweed. This is probably one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten. I actually insisted on ordering two orders last time I was here. I think it would be on the short list of things that I'd want to eat if I only had one more meal on earth. Yooke - thinly-sliced chuck eye tartare with raw quail egg yoke. The waiter pours out the egg yoke from the tiny little speckled shell and mixes it into the tartare, The first time I tried this, I was a bit skeptical. Despite the beautiful presentation, it looked a bit like little mound of ground beef with a tiny egg on top. My skepticism was disarmed at first bite and now I order it every time I'm back. Delicious! GRILLED:Horumon-Moriawase (chef's selection) - if you want to try unusual cuts, go with this. It typically comes with sweetbread, liver, heart, and two types of stomach. My favorite was the heart because it was super tender with the sweetbread in a close second. The only thing that I wasn't crazy about was one of the stomachs because it was too rubbery. Definitely ask the server how long each cut should be cooked because that will have a large impact on how it tastes. They're happy to cook it for you as well. SAKE:Hakkaisan from Niigota - dry, crisp, and delicious. When you order sake, they bring out a tray of all different cute little cups for you to choose from.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

Super overpriced. Super rushed. As soon as u empty a dish they're on you. They keep pushing u to order and eat your food as soon as possible.

I have been here twice (wish I lived closer so that I can go more often).  It is not for the faint of heart though.  However there are things on the menu that everyone can try.  It's a fun atmosphere where you get to cook your own food.  Could be a perfect spot for a first date or just some friends catching up.  The ability to order as much as you want and try a few different things is so perfect.  You can always add more once you are done with your first order if you are still hungry which I like.Some of my favorite dishes: 1. Testicargot (cow balls escargot style with garlic shiso butter)2. Kalbi (short rib)3. Mino (first stomach)4. Home-made Madagascar Vanilla  - it comes with a gold leaf! What girl wouldn't want that. One item I was not a fan of is Calf's Brain Cream (in tube) with Blinis & Caviar.  The presentation was perfect and Caviar was delicious.  The only thing that bothered me is the brain in a tube that I had to squeeze out.  I would have preferred it be chucky and in it's simple form.

I came to Takashi for the ramen before during the Christmas period of 2014 and it was damn good so I thought i'd bring my brother for a memorable unique ramen experience. I made a reservation and even received email confirmation. When I got there, I wasn't on the list. But no matter, the really sweet guy at the door asked me to show him the email. He immediately apologised for his colleague's oversight and promised us seats. So without a hitch, we got seated - no fuss at all. Everything is still all smiles and rainbows. Within 3 minutes of being seated, we ordered. So we weren't being long-winded whiny people who can't decide - anyway there's only like what, normal and spicy and then extra toppings.This is where I can't give the 5-star raiting. We waited 30 minutes for our food. The table next to us got their food WAY BEFORE us. They ordered later than us. The cherry on the cake was that the table next to us finished their meal before we got ours.My experience the first time in the winter left such an impression that I had to bring my brother. But 8 months later, I get treated badly. TLDR: Table next to us orders after us and finishes their meal before we get ours. Ramen was damn good. Noodles were well-cooked and the broth is to die for. The pork cut was tender and fatty - super awesome to have that fat melt in your mouth. My brother loved the ramen so much he couldnt stop telling the parents about it.

The other table grills requierd a minimum of 4 and were atleast 1.5 to 2 hr waits because those are the time limits imposed on the spots. I ate so much raw meat it was amazing. For appetizers we ordered the crawfish and marrow dumplings. These were delicious and meaty, but not dumplings at all. I would have to say that they were more like delicious meatballs. But... I didn't taste any crawfish. It was marrow, meat, and love magic in my mouth. I mean that in the best way possible.We also had the beef tartare, this was less mashed meat and more strips of raw meat with some seaweed and a quail egg mixed in. Who know raw meat could be this delicious? I didn't, but now I do.Also, the Uni on squares of raw beef. Delicious. That's all I can say about it. Fresh Uni and awesome meat on a square sheet of seaweed.The beef cheek was good. Nothing special, but delicous.The 6 oz. Kobe beef for $30 bucks. It was cooked amazingly by the server.

I noticed the following morning and immediately called the restaurant.  They said they would reverse the charge.  They never did and when I followed up again they said I signed the bill and they would not refund me.

Come early during the week & you will have a shorter wait if you don't have a reservation. Ambiance is intimate & trendy. It's a sexy little spot for a date or to go with a group of friends. The service was awesome - our server was a total doll. She was very attentive & made excellent suggestions. Standouts: to start the soft-boiled egg cocotte as well as the bone marrow & crawfish dumplings are both SO SO GOOD. For the BBQ, the beef belly & short ribs were our personal faves. The sauce was super tasty. We also really enjoyed the homemade ice cream to finish. If you aren't a seasoned pro, definitely ask your server for sake recommendations with your meal - we tried different pairings that were indeed very complimentary to the food.Also, sidebar: they have a suped up toto toilet in the bathroom...  If you don't know what that is, it's basically the rolls royce of toilets, which may seem insignificant until you use the restroom & realize even THAT was extra pleasant.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"
433,vPyIX5As6g4H9EnBDQCHeQ,Steph C.,5.0 star rating,"Once upon a time, I saw Anthony Bourdain on TV, eating uni-covered meat at Takashi. I don't always insist on doing whatever's done on TV, but I knew that one day, that niku uni would be mine. I finally met this destiny on a recent trip to New York, when I went for a Friday night dinner with my mom and two friends.We made a reservation for four people, the smallest table you're allowed to reserve. The walk-in line was pretty deep the entire time we were eating. Takashi is a cute place, small and casual with a festive izakaya air. We were helped by a friendly waiter who was really enthusiastic about intestines. The menu had a lot of unfamiliar items, and he was a great guide.Chef Takashi is ethnically Korean, born and raised in Japan (and, incidentally, looks like this: metro.us/wp-content/uplo…). His food reflects that heritage--it's Korean barbecue with a Japanese presentation, with a gutsy focus on innards. The more prepared dishes show a flair you'll never see in a traditional Korean barbecue joint. You can get things like brain cream and testicargot, which is exactly what it sounds like.A couple of our party were not feeling super adventurous, and I was happy sticking to the safe stuff. I've had some organs in my life and I can take or leave most of them. We shared some appetizers and a whole lot of meat, and all left full and happy.The niku-uni was an appetizer, and it came with four portions of uni over raw beef over shiso over nori. I'm not sure why I don't see uni with beef all over the place. The creamy brine of the sea urchin went beautifully with the beef, and the fragrant shiso and salty seaweed were pleasant as well. I wanted another order, but we did have more things to eat. The other standout appetizer was the yooke, Takashi's version of Korean steak tartare, made with thinly sliced chuck eye. It was cool and zesty, the beef silky and bound with quail egg. We also shared the gyutoro-temaki sushi, which was chuck flap ""sushi,"" essentially slices of beef over large mounds of rice. This wasn't bad, but the beef got lost in all that rice. The soft-boiled egg en cocotte was sort of the odd man out in our meal--it could have walked in from an entirely different restaurant. It was pretty good, if small and hard to share, a loose boiled egg topped with tiny bits of beef pancetta, caviar, blue crab, pear, smoked dried tomato, pickled new ginger, cucumber, and yuzu zest.The bulk of our meal came from the grill, just plenty of beef, beef, and beef. We ordered kalbi, ribeye, and beef belly, along with some large intestines. We had a choice of preparations for each order: either seasoned with salt, garlic, and sesame oil, or marinated in Takashi's sauce, which was sweet and soy saucey like you'd expect from a yakiniku marinade. We mixed and matched, and everything was delicious. We were on our own for a lot of the grilling, but our waiter gave us detailed instructions and we were able to cook everything up without mistakes. It helped to have a mom at the table. All the cuts were excellent, but I have to say, the large intestines, or tetchan, were the winner for me. Our waiter recommended the tetchan as a universally beloved innard, different from the rest of what we were eating without being off-putting. He was right. The tetchan was chewy in the best way possible, elastic and yielding, with a mild, wonderful flavor, with the marinade caramelized by the grill. If I make it back to Takashi, I'd love to explore some of the other organ meats. The intestines made me feel like I was ready.We ate our meat with some rice, mostly an order of bakudan, which was basically onigiri studded with Korean seaweed and pickled sesame leaf. Kind of horrendous that it cost $8. White rice should do the trick fine.For dessert, Takashi serves homemade Madagascar vanilla soft serve ice cream with several choices of toppings. We ordered two of these with the works--shiratama (white mochi balls), kurogoma kinako (black sesame and soybean flower), azuki (red beans), and syrup (syrup). We got one with green tea and one with strawberry syrup. The soft serve was fantastic--I would go to a dessert shop that only served this ice cream. It was the perfect consistency, with the right amount of sweetness, and the toppings were delightful.I understand that Takashi does a late night ramen, which is just coolness overkill. I don't spend too much time envying New York, but I'd probably trade something big to get Takashi to move to L.A.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

We got to the restaurant early because they don't take reservations with parties with less than 4 people. When the doors opened promptly at 5:30, we were greeted with friendly smiles and we were seated quickly. The restaurant is quite small that seats approximately 35 people so you need to get there early. The decor was unique and very interesting. The menu board on the wall goes around 3/4 of the restaurant and the tables were similar to picnic tables with a small grill in the middle of it. Hanging from the ceiling was a black vent to catch the smoke from grilling. The noise level was very minimal and I never even noticed it on. Our waitress came to our table quickly and introduced herself. She explained the menu to us and made suggestions on some dishes since it was our first time there. She was very knowledgable and described all the dishes when they were brought out to the table.  We ordered many of the specials to share: Soft-boiled eggs en Cocotte, Bone marrow & crawfish dumplings, Calf's Brain Cream - one of our favorite dishes, Testicargot (cow balls escargot style w/garlic shiso butter). It was slightly chewy but an interesting dish. Raw:Namagimo (liver w/sesame oil & roasted rock salt)Niku-Uni (chuck flap w/sea urchin and fresh wasabi)Grilled: You cook! Kalbi (Short Rib) Beef Belly - our favorite, it was so tender and so delicious! Make sure to squeeze a little lemon juice on top to give it some added flavor! Chef's choice - 1st & 2nd stomach, Kimo (liver), Hatsu (heart) and Shibire (Sweetbreads) I tried their Japanese plum wine, which was a bit sweet so I had it with some ice to dilute it. We also tried a craft brew beer to compliment our meal. Dessert to top off our dinner: Home-made Madagascar Vanilla soft serve ice cream with a piece of honey comb laid on top. We had a choice of various toppings and syrups.  Most restaurants have after dinner mints, well this restaurant offers you Wrigley's chewing gum to refreshen your breath! I thought it was great and it went with the uniqueness of the restaurant. We would definitely like to go back for another fun and exciting dining experience, but the restaurant is a little pricey and not for you if you're on a budget.

I had the regular broth that had the perfect pairing of ingredients resulting in a combination of flavors that every ramen lover will appreciate. There are a ton of bars in the area around Takashi and I found it to be a perfect break in my night out with friends.

436,xLZzFO2_T-LQIMuZhFBlTg,Masayo K.,3.0 star rating,"Personally, I really give 3.5 stars if I could. I went to Takashi for my birthday night out last week.  Since they don't take reservation for group smaller than 4, I invited other couple, so I could make reservation.  It was good idea. I get there 6:15 and I over heard waiting was 3 hours.... I had high expectation  I guess because I read Takashi's blog and expected to be top notch because of this high pricing. We had hard time deciding... But I ordered, Namagimo (ultra-fresh liver with sesame oil and roasted rock salt) to start. No one except me in my party were  interested in NAMA (Raw meat) so I went for basic. I kind of missed to have this dish. It's so simple but it must be fresh. I wish I could have ordered NIku-Uni,but I am not a big fan of Uni. So I did this instead. It was good, but it was buried with scallion and soaked in sesame oil...It is nothing wrong with Raw liver. It should taste sweet and shouldn't be iron taste like cooked liver.  It didn't impressed me. But they were fine slice of liver.Then, my friend was interested in ""Soft-Boiled Egg en Cocotte"" So we ordered.This tiny dish was $16I was not sure why dish was frozen. Menu didn't say anything about it. Just said ""Soft-Boiled Free-range Egg en Cocotte Topped with House-Made Beef Pancetta, Caviar, Blue Crab Meat, Pear, Smoked Dried Tomato, Pickled New Ginger, Cucumber, and Yuzu Zest"" It was disappointing. because it was frozen. Soft-boiled was VERY HARD FROZEN Egg. It must have been a joke??? I didn't get that. Sorbet style???  It was tasty but kind of yucky. Grandmom's Steamed Beef Shank Buns with Spicy Mayo (2 pieces) $16.You know, they charged us $16 for this appetizer. I don't mind price being $16, but I was a bit disappointed that they made it self-serve. They brought out hot buns in the steamer and meat in small bowl. When I picked up buns, it was quite HOT. I mean,.. burning HOT. This restaurant doesn't give us wet towel like normal Japanese restaurant and all of the sudden, we have to use own hands to create buns?  WITH THIS PRICING? I wish restaurant should prepare them and bring out to the table or waiter/waitress should prepare buns at the table. You know, just a little bit of consideration, maybe??? Well,  buns were really yummy, though! Foie Gras Stuffed Mini Kobe Burger with Chocolate BBQ Sauce　$24It is tiny. Yes, it is very tasty. But I don't know if it is worth $24. Bone Marrow and Crawfish Dumplings with Hong Kong-Style Hot Peanut Oil Sauce　$16  (2 piece per order, so we ordered 2)This was pretty good dumplings. Again, portion is very small. They are yummy. Presentation was amazing. Bring out boiling peanut oil and pour over at the table. We ordered Kobe Beef Kalbi $26 It came with 7 slices on one plate, so I ordered another one. They are really good. Melt in the mouth... Shio-Tan (tongue) I had better tongue and it was not the best, but I say it was pretty good. I think Cuts are a little too thick for me. I want to have simple salt and sesame oil ROSE (RIB EYE) was a little tough. My boyfriend ordered Shibire (sweetbreads) I enjoyed, I was totally distracted by Kobe Beef Kalbi on the menu, I forgot to order Harami.Overall, quality of meats are outstanding. But portion are VERY small! After that, we had Home-made Madagascar Vanilla  softserve ice cream This was really good ice cream :) Service is very attentive and I do not have any complain with our sweet waitress. Our dinner took about 2 hours. We ordered a bottle of red wine, three glasses of white wine, two beer and above all.... about $400 + Tip. Overall, appetizers were very creative. But I think they are not worth to be that high price. If I ever go back, I will only stick to NAMAMONO and BBQ. Atmosphere is totally Japanese Style Yakiniku, it was NOT Korean BBQ - I love that. But I have to ask myself one more time, ""does it worth it?"" Well, I may give another try (for Namamono & BBQ) ... but I don't know If my boyfriend want to spend money on ridiculously over priced meat again. Don't get me wrong, food is excellent here (except Egg) But I don't think it's worth it.  .  Well, yeah, this place was Anthony Bourdain's must go place in NYC... but I don't think you will be missing out so much....  Well, if money is no issue.

The broth is salty, greasy, flavorful, garlicky and full of scallions and crispy beef intestines. I love it!If you're getting the spicy version, be sure to mix it thoroughly. I ate half a bowl before realizing it had to be mixed. The Grandma's spicy ramen was the original with additional chili flakes or togarashi spices.

446,Be7atHOmiWG6fJa2PjwKRA,Brad P.,1.0 star rating,"Out of 200 reviews, this is my 3rd 1 star review. I've previously loved this place for their food, and the service during my last visit was absolutely spot on. but the staff I met today ruined everything.I reserved for 4 people at 8pm. 2 of us were on time, the other 2 were late. The maître d or whoever you want to call her, told us it's policy to wait for the full party to arrive. Fair enough, so we waited. Our 3rd guest arrived and the final guest was going to be late, so we just told them to seat us for 3. The response was definitely unexpected. She told us, ""it's not our policy to sit 3 people for a reservation, and you would probably have to wait 2.5 hours for a table, but we will let you guys sit anyways...we don't take reservations for 3 people. Please wait."" That was fair enough, so we waited.5 minutes later, 2 people arrived and she leads them to the only open table available, which I thought would be ours because we came first. I thought there must be a reason for that, and didn't say anything. 5 minutes later, a 3rd person arrives and joins their table. Confused, I asked her why did she seat them when their full party didn't arrive? She answered ""because your party isn't here. we are letting you guys use the reservation even though you have 3 people. Your wait would have been 2.5 hours otherwise."" that made no sense to me because I asked her why the guests that came later then us got to sit before us when their full party wasn't present. so I asked her again, and her reply was ""oh, they know the manager, and they come here twice a week.""her response ticked me off, but we waited. that party knew the managers - who am I to take their table. 8:25PM and we were still waiting for our table that was supposed to be available at 8PM. So i asked the maître d, when is our table going to be ready?She replied, since you're party isn't here yet, you have to wait longer. I admittedly got a little angry, and I asked her, ""okay, so hypothetically, if all 4 of us were here, at 8PM, would you have sat us down?""She replied ""oh...no because the table we had reserved for you - they're still paying the bill.""See what's going on here? The whole time she was just trying to justify us waiting by making us look bad because 1 of our guests came late...but the whole time, they had no table available at 8PM, but made us believe we were waiting 30 minutes because one of our guests was late.I know it's not her fault that the earlier guests finished their meal later, but at least explain the situation instead of trying to make it seem like she was doing us a favor.We finally got seated, and we wanted to order right away. We tried to grab the attention of the waiters/servers (couldn't tell who was who), but they told us to wait.During the meal, we also didn't have a waitress or waiter. Each time the food came out, someone different brought it. And none of them interacted with us.all in all, I was so dissatisfied with the service, we gave them a low tip. that may be cheap of me, but I don't understand this concept of tipping in the US. The amount of tip should correlate to the service you receive. We came out of the restaurant, and shortly after, the manager stormed out and demanded an answer to why we gave them a low tip. I told them, your maître d gave us attitude and made us wait 30 minutes for a table we reserved for 8PM. we waited 15 minutes until someone took our order. no waiter asked us how the food was or bothered to check in with us. we didn't even know who to tip because we interacted with so many servers. that's why.the manager snapped back, alright if that's what you want to give, go ahead. and walked back into the restaurant. why even ask me why I tipped you in the first place if you're just going to head back inside. Did he want more tip from me? Usually at a restaurant, if the service was bad, the manager at least tries to understand what happened. by all means, the customer isn't always right. but when a customer is clearly upset, there's usually a good reason behind it. /rant",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"
447,7n3KrdZtgy5oSYgVh8Y69w,Erica L.,2.0 star rating,"Honestly, I would give this place 1 star, but the Niku-Uni alone is worth a star. This is definitely not your average dining experience.I came here with a friend on a Friday night around 8pm, and since Takashi doesn't take reservations for parties less than 4, it ended up being a 2 hour wait. The hostess recommended 2 wine bars closeby for my friend and I to grab drinks at while we waited. The space is very small, with an area in the middle where two chefs prepare the cuts of offal taking most of the space. The majority of the seats are for two people sitting around the preparation area, with a few tables for larger parties to the side. We were seated at one of the tables surrounding the prep area, and my friend and I both sat on this hard wooden bench. It was a bit too close for comfort. In front of us was a grill that would later get extremely hot that I began to feel uncomfortable. My friend was recommended this place when he went to Japan and was told that he MUST try the Niku-Uni. In addition, we ordered the beef schmaltz crostini with truffle oil, and the chef's selection. They brought out a few small dishes of cabbage, kimchi, and bean sprouts, which is very common in Korean restaurants but these were nothing special. The Niku-Uni was amazing: the uni was extremely fresh and was a perfect combination with the chuck flap, wasabi, seaweed, and shiso leaf. It was a bite of pure bliss. My friend and I both did not know what beef schmaltz was, so we decided to give it a shot. It was not actually a crostini but rather on pieces of wheat bread, which seemed like a very plain and basic dish. Next was the chef's selection comprised of first stomach, 4th stomach, liver, heart, & sweetbreads. The waiter gave the recommendations on how long to cook each cut, but I couldn't hear/understand him, but luckily my friend did. I was never a fan of liver and heart when I was younger, but I actually really liked everything in the chef's selection. Everything was very tender.We were still hungry after this, so we decided to get an order of beef belly and premium super thick tongue since they were all out of the tongue experience. I'm a huge fan of pork belly, so I opted for the beef belly, and it was my favorite cut out of everything. The super thick tongue was my least favorite. I've had tongue before, but this was so thick, tough, and chewy despite cooking it per the recommendations that I was afraid that I was going to choke on it. I grew tired of chewing on it, and I would not recommend the super thick tongue at all.Even after ordering all of this, I was still not full but was in no mood to keep ordering since everything is so expensive. The bill came out to be about $150 -- totally not worth the price tag if we left still hungry and also had to cook our own food. I'm glad I tried it at least once but won't be returning anytime soon.If you are not an open-minded eater, do NOT come here. You will not find chicken wings or ribs here.

Last Friday was fully booked when I inquired, but there were reservations for Saturday night. The ramen was pretty good. Menu had two choices: regular or spicy (they were identified with more elaborate names on the menu). I went with the spicy. Beef was really good (only one piece though, but additional can be added). It's not the usual rolled up and sliced chashu like most other ramen places, but more like Chinese braised beef belly. I also liked the noodles (thin, round), which the waitress said was specifically made for Takashi's beef broth. Beef broth was rich as described. Dense in texture more than flavor, and not quite drinkable like tonkotsu broth that I prefer. There was also crispy intestine, which the waitress said had all the fat extracted to make it extra crispy; I wasn't a big fan. Parties of two shared tables with another party of two.

457,Qrrv0F_iT636eb7FOHloIA,Duke C.,5.0 star rating,"Favorite restaurant in NYC at the moment!Takashi is this yakiniku restaurant in West Village, focusing on raw and grilled beef.  The chef is actually Korean and grew up in Japan, combining best of both.  If you like Gyu-Kaku, then this place will blow your mind.  Of course, my friends and I all saw Bourdain's Layover episode when he munched on uni and beef so we had to get that and whatever he ordered plus more!Takashi starts out with complimentary dishes: miso cabbage, kimchi, and beansprouts.  The miso dressing over the cabbage is very vinegar-y.  Kimchi wasn't too crazy, but the beansprouts can rival any Korean restaurants.  Too bad no continuous servings like Korean banchan.As for the infamous Niku Uni, which is Kobe chuck flap topped with sea urchin and fresh wasabi, wrapped by seaweed & shiso leaf, it lived up to the hype.  Jeebus it was good!  Fatty marbled chuck with the creamy smooth uni is straight up addicting.  The shiso leaf is pretty damn strong, but I love that herbaceous flavor.  One bite and you're done, but what a heavenly bite.Also got Yooke, our tartare dish of the night.  Thinly-sliced chuck eye tartare in their special sauce.  They actually mix a quail egg to the tartare on the table, which was pretty cool.  It  definitely has a bit of the Korean influence with the sauce, and it is one of the best Asian tartare I've had anywhere.  Love that red hue from the beef too.  Sometimes when you eat tartare, you get a few pieces that's already browning, and it just throws your appetite off, but none of that here.For the grilling portion, we started with US Kobe marbled chuck flat steak.  Our server grilled the steak for us until rare and rested the steak before slicing it.  They encourage us to grill it some more if we like it more well-done, but as is, it is fatty, juicy, smooth... just insert all good adjectives you can think about meat here.Also ordered Shio Tan, which is tongue, simply seasoned.  Thick slices of tongue, grilled few minutes on each side.  Generally I'm not a fan of tongue, but I gotta admit, it was pretty good :PFor the marinated cuts, we got the Tsurami and Beef Belly.  Tsurami, which is beef cheek, has a very interesting texture since the cheek is a workhorse muscle.  It has a chewy texture but tender at the same time.  Beef Belly looks like pork belly, except with a red hue, and as melt-in-your-mouth as it could possibly be.For our last order, we went with the special, Asian-Cajun Andoillete.  It caught our attention because it is 100% Kobe sausage with Cajun spices, stuffed in beef large intestine.  Way too interesting not to try!  Crispy intestine on the outside and super juicy Kobe on the inside.  All the juices from the fat is trapped in so it was like a beef-flavor overload with a bit of Cajun.  A bit heavy, but very good.We also a bottle of the Hakkaisan Tokubetsu Junmai.  ""Premium Japanese Sake"" indeed, cause it was a pricey bottle, but damn, it was perfect with our meal. Really one of the best meals I've had.  It's fun, adventurous, and tasty.  Service was great too and they really take the time to make sure the meats are not overcooked.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

For the person looking for the best and creative yakiniku dishes in the city, come to Takashi. Be prepared to shell out a decent load if you'd like to truly enjoy your experience though: Takashi is more of a $$$$ place. Some may find it disconcerting but Takashi is not really meant for big parties. This ""intimate"" point really separates Takashi from other Yakiniku places like Gyu-Kaku or Yakiniku West, which I think allows Takashi to experiment with more ""creative"" dishes that you wouldn't find at the other traditional yakiniku places. I'm talking about the uni beef sashimi wrapped in shiso (niku-uni) that everyone considers a must-have. I mean the soft-boiled egg en cocotte, topped with pancetta, crab, caviar, pear, etc. What about that squid-ink rice with marinated sweetbreads? We haven't even gotten to the actual ""yakiniku"" part of the meal yet!We are talking serious business at Takashi. Takashi is really best-suited for the open-minded. If you know people who are like, ""blehh, beef tongue or liver"" then don't bother to take them here. They wouldn't appreciate Takashi for all its worth because there are far more ""unique"" things than tongue on the menu. Of course, you could just order all the normal meat cuts because they are high-quality too, but by not experimenting with new things at Takashi, it kind of misses the point why you would come.

I can't remember the exact cuts we ordered, but we basically ordered what the waitress recommended including the beef belly.  All the cuts were incredibly tender and succulent.  We also ordered scallions and rice to go with the meal which were delicious. Usually I don't like meat bellies (i.e. pork, beef bellies) but the beef belly at Takashi should be a part of every meal.  INCREDIBLE!This place is pricey and the portions are not particularly large but the food is top notch.

Seems wrong. The BBQ is good but nothing special. Actually I think you get better value for BBQ at Gyu Kaku. That said, I loved the thick tongue and sweet bread.   I would come back here for the oxtail pie alone. Our table of 5 ordered two and then ordered two more.

Their opinion, uncommon combination with a surprisingly good taste. But too much chocolate dressing.  I ordered kobe beef with a house marinating sauce. Tender and delicious but very tiny and thin selection. No rice no sides. You can order but right now each person was paying $60+ and we were still hungry.  I decided to order uni with raw Kobe. Delicious but again such a small a mount of food. After our meal we were ""satisfied"" but slightly with a craving for another side dish.  We walked over to a local cafe to get dessert.

There were two choices (not including add ons) oringnal ramen or spicy ramen. The rest went for oringnal while I went for the spicy!! It was while looking about this funky little restaurant that I got reading the walls.... and realised this isn't the standard ramen im used to but made with beef instead (some korean influence),  having lost some love with ramen in London I was starting to regain some interest in this twist that I was unaware of before. The food was served in a timely manner and the waiter regaled us with all the tasty ingredients. I was immediately smashed in the face with a strong garlic smell and was thankful that all the normal condiments that are on the table (including garlic) were not provided. You eat it as it comes out the kitchen!! The taste was just what I needed to regain my ramen love. Rich and salty with that garlic overpowering the rest just enough.  The custom made noodles were cooked well (albeit a little thin) but I don't think I partook in the table small talk until id finished the bowl.

When we were still eating, one of the employees came to us if we were done. You don't see that the meat is still on the grill? After that, the moment the last piece of the meat was gone, he came back and asked if we were going to order more food and we said no. (Up to that point, we'd spent $150 in 35 minutes) and he emptied the table right away except our drinks which was almost full. Then the hostess came to us saying she told a group of people waiting that their table will be ready in 5 minutes.

Maybe this is by design so they can create excess demand, but it also results in a situation where people who actually live in the neighborhood (or New York for that matter) will probably come here once and then never come back given the hoops you need to jump through.  Beyond stupid, in my opinion.The food is great here, and there are some amazing unique appetizers, but not worth waiting hours for.

One of my first tastes of pure raw beef and the taste was just out of the world tender with no toughness in eating. Melt in your mouth, one of the things you look for in good beef. Next was a medley of different cow parts, tongue, sirloin, and other cuts all differently marinated and recommended to be cooked to medium rare. The server was helpful and informative on best ways to cook and description of the meat. Same with these dishes, tender and tasteful to the point of no words.I was seriously impressed with the quality of the meat and it changed the way I look at korean/japanese style bbq. Obviously this place is not for vegetarians and if you are not a fan of beef then this place might not be for you but other then that, you will be impressed. It's been over a year since I've come hear and I still dream of coming back.

Takashi will blow your mind (if you have an open one).  While it's known for serving all the cow parts, the ones you commonly eat are just as good.  Having to cook your own beef is not only fun, but absolutely worth it in their special house sauce.  No reservations, unfortunately, but worth the wait - and if you head over right after work, it's usually easy to get right on a table!The staff is great.  The place is cozy AND great for people watching.

We were visiting NYC for our anniversary and we wanted to go there because we saw it on an Anthony Bourdain episode of Layovers. And now I know why it was featured. Last night we walked into a wall of glorious smells that made our mouth water. We were greeted very kindly by the hostess (I am sorry I didn't ask her name), and she seated us as soon as she could. Our server Lisa was so welcoming that she made us feel like old friends that she was entertaining in her home. The food was amazing! We started with bean sprouts, cabbage in a house ginger dressing, and the kimchee, which was all very good and flavorful. I used them a lot to cleanse my palate so I could fully enjoy the next taste.  Then came the niku-uni. Wow. It was an amazing myriad of flavors! The testicargot was admittedly, a novelty selection, but we really enjoyed it. Because we came to NYC to ""eat our way through the city,"" we chose the Horumon-Moriawase (chef's selection), and Lisa was there to guide us on how to prepare it. Her cooking time suggestions were spot on because everything turned out perfectly! After eating that, we were still hungry so we asked Lisa for her suggestions, and knew she wouldn't steer us wrong.  She suggested the Asian-Cajun Andouillette (which Lisa cooked just right) and the Beef Belly. It was fabulous! Pairing the Sake that was also suggested by Lisa (we asked because we don't normally drink it and needed help) brought out more of the flavors.  I can't say enough except that I am getting hungry while typing this :) We finished off with dessert (I suggest ""The Works"" because you get a combination of lots of flavors).  Hats off to the chefs behind the counter who took so much care in preparing our plates. Cooking most of the food ourselves was really fun. Lisa's service and the amazing food will bring us back the next time we are in NYC!

Great quality, delicious, innovative, and unique. Service was helpful, prompt and professional. The only reason I thought of taking a star off was the prices. For the little amount of food you get, it's quite expensive. That and the fact that the heat from the grills were baking my face and made me quite uncomfortably hot. While the beautiful restaurant is quite small, good news is that they take reservations AND they'll seat you even though your full party has not arrived yet. In NYC, you should be grateful for that bit of grace. Every item we ordered was deliciously perfect. The downside is that since you are grilling the meats, you are liable for overcooking. Good thing our waiter always instructed us on how long to properly cook each meat. Without these tips, we probably would have ruined everything!Tips: Get the cow tongue.

The wonderful tongue at Takashi is a much classier experience without the shame and awkward text message the next morning.It's got this texture I've never quite tasted before (chewy but not tough) even after having tongue tacos from my favorite taquieras and it's served in a way where you don't even know it's tongue. It looks like slices of loin or sausage so if you have a squeamish dinner partner you can lie and tell them it's ""steak"" or ""not tongue.""Never has a hot pot given me more delight and cherubic smiles than the sake lees (leftover sediment from the sake fermenting process) mini hot pot with ramps and skirt steak. It's a highly savory and milky broth made from pure epic that you're not gonna wanna share it with your friends after the first taste. You shouldn't either because ramps season is limited and oh look it's already over see ya next year!They have some other standard cuts and kalbi but you can get that anywhere so take advantage of their other offalings (can't help it) and put some of their stomachs in yours. Seriously all three stomachs are on the menu.It's not your typical hokey and homely looking grill-stuff-at-your-table experience. The place is very small but quite modern and their setup minimizes your clothes smelling like you've been manning a jumbo Weber at a family reunion.As cheap as the cuts normally are they come from top shelf cattle and it's pretty expensive even for the west village so get ready to drop a buck and a half for two after a couple drinks each and tip.

I have had much better at Gari.  The combo tasted  fine but did not blow my mind.   The meat platters --SMALL. About  1/2 to 2/3 the size of a platter you would get in a typical Korean bbq restaurant (Gaonnuri is a nice one).  Some of the meat was fine quality but did not translate to being 2 times more delicious imo. The rice -- $3 a bowl  Now that is just plain greedy.  I mean some ppl can justify the higher prices for premium beef but don't tell me this rice cost them more than $.30 to steam up.  If you are going to charge top dollar for meat, the rice should be free.   Grandma's buns -- 2 to the platter -- or $8 each for basically two steamed bread rounds and one small bowl with meat.  There was definitely NOT enough meat to overstuff each bun.  This was true of each of the two platters we ordered. Service was attentive --the place was cute.

508,nolP0lldaWLmIJU_feSBzg,Viv M.,4.0 star rating,"3.5 star review for PROCESS and QUALITY of the midnight ramen - reservation process, wait time, and food (including the foie gras add-on) addressed1. Reservations or no? The short story is yes, you should make reservations. The long story is that the website technically states that they're not required, and you definitely DO NOT need to book them the Monday before. Let me explain - - Takashi's website (currently) states that they are now taking walk-ins for their midnight ramen. There seems to be some confusion with the restaurant as to how true that is, so I would still advise in favor of making reservations.- HOWEVER, if you miss the Monday 5pm cut-off, don't worry (too much). It is possible to call in and score a reservation anyway. I don't know how it works, but it does. We called in at 9:15pm the night that we wanted to go (yes, that is three hours before we were eventually seated). The first time we called, we were told that they were all booked up. The second time we called a mere twenty minutes later, using a more assertive (and coincidentally male) voice, they put us down for a 12:30AM reservation the night of. When we got there, we met another group which told us they also had called in a few hours before and got a reservation, which they had apparently done THREE TIMES BEFORE. This group of non-famous, normal people was not even aware of the fact that reservations were difficult to get. - I'm calling this out here because it's ridiculous how arduous, inconsistent, and unclear the current reservations process is (or claims to be), and it's building undeserved hype (some hype is deserved, but shouldn't be fanned by the reservation process), so in the interest of full transparency, let it be known that LAST MINUTE RESERVATIONS ARE OBTAINED, and REGULARLY, by normal people!!2. Wait time - pretty decent! We arrived at 12:15AM for a 12:30AM reservation (as advised), and waited until about 12:40AM to be seated. Food is served pretty quick - not Totto quick though - and we were outta there by 1:10AM. 3. Food - Generally, quite good.- The broth is the saltier/heavier Ippudo variety (as opposed to lighter/shoyu-type Totto). The distinguishing characteristic about this broth is, of course, that it's beef-based. It is pretty tasty, and might remind you more of Chinese beef noodle soups than pure Japanese ramen in that sense. I thought it was a cool spin though. - Tasty chewy noodles- Super heavy (in a good way). You'll be full. - IS THE FOIE GRAS ADD-ON WORTH IT? No. The foie gras itself is not that great quality, and they seared the outside, which gave it a thick skin that goes against the reason why you eat foie gras - to have it be super soft and melty. It didn't add much to the dish. For cheaper, why not, but for a premium price, this just isn't a premium add-on.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

They only take reservations of 4 or more, so if you're going with less people, make sure you get there early and get your name down on the list. We ordered sake for the meal. And with that, they let you choose an assortment of sake cups, all made with different materials, had different designs, and sizes. I found this to be a lot of fun. For appetizers, the Testicargot- cow testicles cooked escargot style with garlic shiso butter were pretty good. It deftinitely had a mineral taste to them, but the garlic butter covered balanced it out. The Niku-Uni- chuck flap topped with sea urchin and fresh wasabi was definitely a favorite. Fresh sea urchin is always good. And Yooke- thinly-sliced chuck eye tartare in special sauce. It so good, each person could probably eat one by themselves.For mains,we tried and assortment of grilled meat. It doesn't matter if you choose seasoned with salt, garlic and sesame oil or the marinated in Takashi's sauce, all of it was fantastic. The stomachs were a bit chewy for me, but otherwise, I enjoyed everything we tried. My recommendations would be the Tsurami (cheek), Rosu (ribeye), and the Shio-Tan (tongue) For dessert, we had the home-made Madagascar vanilla softserve ice cream with your choice of toppings.

I saw the uni sitting on top of that beautifully marbled beef and knew I had to have it.I rolled in for a solo dinner at the bar around 6:30pm on a Tuesday and had no issues getting a seat. I tried the niku-uni, of course. Clean, quality, delicious. I also tried the foie gras stuffed kobe burger with chocolate sauce. How can you go wrong, right? You can't, obviously. But, they add a fried egg just to be sure. The chocolate sauce is actually quite nice with the meat. Is it worth $20? Debatable, but yummy nonetheless. Finally, some BBQ. This is really the star of the show. I tried the marinated short rib and I'm not exaggerating when I say that it was some of the tastiest beef I'd ever eaten. You'll agree. Trust me.The icing on the cake? Tucked into my receipt was a stick of wrigley's gum.

Admittedly, I found the notion of dining at such a late hour kind of off-putting, but the prospect of tasting beef broth ramen could not be ignored. I was compelled to satiate my curiosity. Good thing I did, as my verdict was that this was one of the top three bowls of ramen I've ever enjoyed. Although the broth is ""waterier"" than those served at Minca or Ippudo, it still had a lot of great flavor. The surprise was how much I enjoyed the use of crispy intestines in the broth. Now I don't normally eat that kind of stuff, but they were very good and addictive, with the texture and flavor really adding a unique and welcome component to the dish. I also recommend ordering the spicy miso paste on the side, not in the bowl; this way, you can experience the flavor of the broth in its purest form, then control the level of spiciness to your individual taste. Putting it over the top was the addition of nicely seared foie gras. It's so decadent that you feel guilty for getting it, but it's absolutely worth it. Overall, Takashi produces a very rich, multi-layered, texturally and flavorfully pleasant bowl.

A piece of nori, shiso leaf, raw chuck flap, topped with uni, and dipped in wasabi soy sauce. Simple, with not much preparation involved really, but it goes to show that quality ingredients can go a long way. Briny, savory, sweet, minty, citrusy; the dish is just paired perfectly.The oxtail and potato curry pie was on the daily special menu and it is ""baked"" on the grill for about two minutes. Nothing to gripe about, nor anything spectacular. It isn't something I would order again.The quality of the raw meats for the grill really is as good as it gets, and the marinades delicious. The server advises you on how long to cook each item. Listen carefully and pay attention, as timing is pertinent. Bust out your iPhone and start the stopwatch! Overcooked the first few slices of beef tongue tip by mere seconds, and it got too tough and chewy. 45 seconds flat on each side, and it was cooked to perfection!The only downside is that the space is tiny with grills within close proximity so the ventilation isn't great.

It had great taste to it, but it's just liver.Mino - A little chewy, but tasted great..

We were each given a pair of metal tongs to grill with, so we didn't have to set our wooden chopsticks on fire. The oxtail was a bit disappointing as the meat was too chewy, but the other meats were well-seasoned. The highlight of the night was the chef's special -- I thoroughly enjoyed the second stomach, the liver, and the heart. Sweetbreads were a bit off-putting, but that's more of a personal thing rather than a criticism of the chef's preparation.As someone else has mentioned, the price to food ratio is rather disproportionate and so we ended up leaving hungry, which is a shame since the food was so damn good.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

I also really enjoyed the 1st stomach (chewy but nutty) , 4th stomach (taste like chicken skin) and the large intestines. They recommended the beef belly, and I agree it was delicious, but for me it was nothing exceptional.. Also, portions are small  especially for intestines and innards which shrink around 40% while being grilled- you are literally left with 6 bite size pieces.

They serve at least 10 more complementary side plates than Takashi. (Takashi is Korean and Japanese fushion BBQ, but it is more Japanese influenced.) Also, complementary fresh vegetables and soup are served at Korean venues at about half the price. However, there is something unique to Japanese style Yakiniku that makes it a worthy trip once in awhile. The meat is tender, and the ambience and its cultural style of being served in small, delicate portions is oddly pleasing. They must be doing something right to charge twice as much as Korean BBQ with half the food and still produce happy, satisfied customers. The most important dishes unique to Takashi that makes this place so addicting is their RAW portion of their menu. We got: Namagimo (ultra-fresh liver with sesame oil and roasted rock salt), and Niku-Uni (chuck flap topped with sea urchin and fresh wasabi) and it was DELICIOUS! Maybe I have a thing for steak tartares and raw meat in general, but the special sauce with tender raw meat/liver did it for me. Truthfully, the meat quality and the types served were like any other Korean restaurants. But the Raw menu itself is worth returning for.

This is great for some, but I just found myself eating kind of weird foods that didn't really hit the spot or fill me up.The non-grilled/appetizer dishes we got:-Niki-uni, basically a slice of raw meat with sea urchin, wrapped in a leaf and seaweed: this is very highly touted by other Yelpers, but when I ate it I basically tasted lots of pure uni flavor, then raw meat...the combo was nice texturally, but didn't really mix flavor-wise for me-Bone marrow and crawfish dumplings: ok, these were actually meatballs that tasted like they had some shrimp in them...these were alright-Granny's buns: definitely tasty, but very close to other pork belly buns that you can find at almost any new-age/""cool"" modern Asian restaurant in the city right now-House bresaola, which was basically a beef tartare with blue cheese: perhaps the most interesting in terms of combining flavorsOn the grill, we got the kobe (great, as you would expect), the beef belly (not bad, but expected it to be better based on the effusive praise from our waitress) and the cheek (not tasty). Perhaps it's that we didn't go adventurous enough and choose the stomachs or tongues or whatnot.Also, overall, this food isn't cheap and doesn't come in large quantities. Our waitress actually told us we ordered too much at first and advised that we take off an extra appetizer; we ended up ordering another grill item after we finished everything else and were still hungry, but that still wasn't really enough to feel full.

I thoroughly enjoyed the soup, the noodles were amazing, my favorite part. I kept spooning for more. If your looking for spicy you might want to ask for extra paste because it is not spicy whatsoever. The soup comes with these little intestines which had a weird texture and I wasn't really sure if I was supposed to eat them, but I did anyway. I tried not to think about what I was putting into my body too much. The beef is real fatty, but tasty. The egg is...an organic egg, not sure how you can screw that up.

After the long plane ride, my family stopped at a McDonald's to pick up something simple for dinner. I asked for a plain cheeseburger, and it came out with two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun. I physically cried when I saw all the toppings, my father yelled at me and told me to eat the damn thing, and I reluctantly gagged it down between sobs. And then Saturday I ate beef testicles at Takashi. My, how things change. It was in this spirit that my husband, friend, and I attacked the nose-to-tail offerings at Takashi. We said we wanted to try everything. And so we did. We skipped the popular galbi that we've grilled so many times in K-Town, and went straight for Achilles tendon, 1st, 2nd, and 4th stomachs, Testicargot (beef testicles in a garlic-shiso sauce), cheek, heart, liver, and belly. We also ordered a few beef buns, which were composed of gravy-soaked beef, spooned on top of fluffy Asian bao buns and accented with spicy mayo (and for the record: way better than anything McDonald's could have ever served my 6-year-old self). I'll get these beef buns every time. So, we tried it all, and kept an open mind. All the meat was of superb quality, marinated to remove any chewiness that comes with offal, and it was fun grilling it ourselves at the table. However, I had some favorites and least favorites.- Beef Belly - fantastic ""beefy"" taste and sublime texture. A must-order.- 1st, 2nd, and 4th Stomachs - 2nd Stomach was the best, as it was the most airy and spongelike, in a good way.- Heart - Nicely marinated and therefore not as chewy as chicken heart I've had in the past. Try it.- Testicargot - The garlic-shiso sauce was complex and very similar to the sauce served with escargot, but for the testicles had a little bit of a gamey taste, so I was not a fan. Try it just to say you did, and then spoon up the remaining garlic-shiso sauce on its own.- Achilles tendon - Unsurprisingly too chewy.- Liver - Very gamey. I don't like liver, so I'm not sure why I thought I would like this.I also have to comment on the freebie cabbage appetizer; the white miso dressing is so tasty and Takashi actually bottles and sells this dressing. I liked the atmosphere, and was happy that we got to sit at the counter instead of a table. It reminded me of being at a yakitori place in Japan, except that we were eating beef instead of chicken.Reservations/Tables:They take rezzies for parties of 4-6, otherwise it's first come first served.

Each table had a grill and the seatings were lunchroom tables. You can also check in your coats here. Bathrooms- very clean and the toilets are just like the ones from Japan- very high tech. We did not have to wait- major plus.There were only 3 tables occupied when we came here on Sunday around 6pm.We had a few orders of niku-uni, Foie Gras, Kalbi, and Shio-tan with white rice. We all felt ripped off after coming here because we spent almost $200 and we walked out still feeling hungry. The quality of the meat for the price you pay is not worth it. Also the pieces of meat were very small and very thin. Hence the low rating for these two factors that I mentioned. Here's a break down on my thoughts of the dishes I ordered. niku-uni- each order came with 4 pieces. It just did not taste good to me and I usually like eating Uni and raw beef. I just do not like the combination they have here. Foie Gras- It came with one tiny patty and an egg- quail egg. I finished the patty in two bite - it was that small!! This dish was actually really good and I love the chocolate bbq sauce however it is not worth $20 because the quality is just not there. Kalbi- It was thinly sliced, came with about 8 pieces. The meat was tender and not chewy. It was nothing to rave about. It only taste slightly better than the ones from Korea town.Shio-tan- They gave us 8 small pieces, about the size of a quarter. I like this. It was a bit crunchy and very flavorful. White rice- The rice was ok. It was too mushy.  I had better. So overall, the food was ok, some were good, some were ok. Nothing outstanding. I would not come back because for the quality was just not there and for the price there are so much better places out there. But this was a unique experience.

The place is small, could hold about 35 people on a busy night. The menu was straightforward  with a small handful of dishes. Majority of the dishes here comes raw, so if you don't like looking at raw meat... you should turn around and exit. The best appetizer we got was the Yooke. Chuck meat tartare with quail egg was absolutely astounding! The meat literally melts in your mouth and it had such a balanced citrus sauce in it. We ordered intestines, 1st & 4th stomach, liver, sweetbread, heart, and tongue to grill. The texture of each were very unique and it's surprising to know that people would throw these parts out when preparing meals. If you love grilling, this place is definitely for you. It's a place where you have to splurge and enjoy/appreciate the food. Before you leave the restaurant, make sure you take a trip to the bathroom. The toilet will amaze you.

607,Y5F1-eVk-q7jZKlKB3Vakw,Chris H.,4.0 star rating,"""This is the best tongue action I've gotten in months"", said my dining companion, as we gleefully chowed down the glorious array of offal at Takashi.  Takashi is a mecca for beef lovers, or more specifically, adventurous carnivores in search of the 'nasty bits' - dainty veal cheeks, fluffy sweet breads, meaty skirt steaks and my favorite cut of the night, a gloriously tender cut of beef tongue.  The proteins at Takashi are simply top notch in quality - cooking prep requiring only a brush of sesame oil, a pinch of salt, and a speckling of garlic.  The actual cooking process is thrust into the hands of the diners, per Yakiniku tradition.  Here, we regress to our caveman roots, applying direct heat to chunks of raw meat.  Or one can take a trip further back to the pre-fire days of man, by sampling the expertly seasoned yookse, Takashi's take on the steak tartare.   There's even more goodness to be had with the platter of pickled, seasonal namul vegetables ($10).  And it would be a crime to leave the restaurant without sampling the homemade vanilla ice cream ($5), adorned with black sesame and soy flour (+$2). Décor is minimal, redolent of the 'less is more' chic of the Momofuku's.  The space is cramped, yet brightened by the same frenetic lighting and energy that fuel the best Japanese eateries.  In the back of the restaurant, a colorful cartoon mural extols the virtues of organ meats, and in the front, diners seated at the bar can watch the garde manger prep the cold dishes in the open air kitchen.  Each table or bar counter is equipped with a blazing hot electric grill and furnished by an overhead vent, which provides enough suction to prevent excessive smoke - though not quite enough to keep your clothes and hair from smelling like meat for the rest of the evening.  Despite the quality ingredients and superb service, you're still paying West Village prices for elegantly dressed raw meat.  $18 for a bit of raw tongue is a tough proposition to chew, or $14 for a cut of fresh stomach may be hard for budget diners to... stomach.  But I suppose the experience dictates these prices.  This place is definitely meant for friends and foodies, ergo I would shy away from taking a date here.  However, in the event that your date is turned on by the raw beef, DIY cooking, and the lingering smell of charred meats, well... there may be more tongue action in store after Takashi.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

613,x64csKtOW91YVuWjn1-cIQ,Caroline T.,5.0 star rating,"I first experienced a Korean grill-it-yourself BBQ restaurant at around age 8 when we broke the family ""Benihana"" birthday dinner trend and opted for the more ""hands on"" celebratory meal for my Mom's special day. A little over a decade later I experienced the real deal on my month-long stay in South Korea, grilling slivers of fatty beef and pork on an outdoor covered deck in the pouring rain... But as favorable as those memories may be, the meal Alex and I shared with his sister Kristin and her boyfriend Mike in NYC's West Village Japanese/Korean spot ""Takashi"" was surely the best. Chef Takashi, a third-generation Korean immigrant born in Japan, represents his dual heritage in his Korean-influenced Japanese-style BBQ (called ""yakiniku"") - a combination destined to be delicious. We heard about Takashi from Anthony Bourdain's ""The Layover"" and made a reservation online before Anthony had even gotten halfway through the segment. With only 34 seats and 7 tables and an all-beef menu, this restaurant is the perfect nook for the true carnivore. Each perfect cut of Premium Japanese and American Angus featured on the menu comes from sustainably raised cattle and is antibiotic and hormone free, and not to mention, expertly prepared and absolutely delicious.As our high-tech infrared grill ""fired"" up, the four of us kicked off the meal with Grandmom's Steamed Beef Shank Buns with Spicy Mayo and the House Bresaola (Kobe Beef Prosciutto) with Blue Cheese and Hazelnut Apply Honey Soy Mustard. While we thoroughly enjoyed both dishes, in retrospect I would have opted for some of the more adventurous options (i.e. the Calf Brain in a Tube...). The Kobe Prosciutto, while sliced razor-thin and ultra-tender, felt too ""safe"" and expected. The true fun began with the grilling; Alex and I shared the chef's selection which included raw, marinated first stomach (Mino), fourth stomach (Akasen), heart, (Hatsu), liver (Kimo) and shortbreads (Shibire), and a plate of raw beef cheek (Tsurami). We cooked each cut according to the server's simple instructions and savored each and every piece. My favorites were the charred sweetbreads (pancreas glands never tasted so good!) and the creamy, tender heart. So if you favor yourself a carnivore, ditch your vegetarian friends and treat yourself to an gluttonous evening of offal.FOR COMPLETE BLOG POST ON TAKASHI VISIT: goodbaduglyeats.com/taka…",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

The main thing about this place is that you have to be willing to try unconventional ""cuts"" of meat. If I remember correctly we ordered the Niku-Uni (chuck flap topped with sea urchin and fresh wasabi) to start, which was veryyy delicately made and absolutely scrumptious. We also ordered a bunch of Yakitori (stomach, belly, short rib, etc.) and had a scallion vinaigrette salad on the side. As it goes with most yakitori places, don't expect to come out of here stuffed, but I thought it was the perfect amount since there was so much flavor in everything. We also got the ice cream at the end with ""the works"" which was very reminiscent of desserts from Asia. Overall, a must try if you're a Japanese BBQ fan and/or Foodie.

I booked mine two weeks ahead of time, since I was visiting from out-of-town. The service was very friendly and so helpful in getting a grasp of the menu. They started us off with a simple salad with the most delicious miso(?) ginger dressing, fresh kimchee (not overly fermented so that you can taste the greens...I highly recommend it and ordering an extra one because it helps cut through the fat of the meat. Our starters included beef shank buns (think melt in your mouth morsels that you sandwich between a white fluffy bao), stewed tendons, and an exquisite House Bresaola (Kobe Beef Prosciutto) with Blue Cheese, Hazelnut Apple Honey Soy Mustard....it was so amazing that I would love to eat this everyday. The bresaola was on the bottom covered with thin slivers of blue cheese, these micro greens, and mustard that just created a mouthful of happiness. The textures worked so beautifully together. Then we ordered beef cheek, kalbi, beef belly and bakudan (rice rolls with either dried nori on the outside or shiso or perilla leaf marinated in soy sauce). Each part of the beef tasted so unique and different. For adventurous eaters, they offer each part of the cow on the menu, and I would come back to work my way through the animal (maybe minus the testicargot). The walls were decorated with drawings that explained the benefits to eating different parts of the cow and overall it was a great experience. Somehow, we all managed to end the meal with a sundae (you can mix and match the ingredients) but it was impossible to resist when we saw our neighboring diners enjoying it while we were making our way through the main course.

I couldn't really enjoy each flavor.Niku-Uni ($24) - marbled chuck flap topped with sea urchin was very good. The tender meat was rested on korean seaweed (Gim - roasted with sesame oil and lightly salted). One piece of brightly yellow Uni was on the top of each raw meat. 4 of this beautifully presented pieces were eaten as Sashimi style. Adding a touch of Wasabi Japanese horseradish with soysauce to the meat and Uni were so fresh that I liked it very much. I tried with more soysauce and a bit of Wasabi  for second piece.I found that I liked it better this way. The meat needed more soy for my liking.Then continued to grilled dishes. We started from Kalbi - short rib and chose No.2 sauce, Takashi's sauce. Marbled meat was marinated with this sweet soy with sesame oil and sprinkled with chopped scallions. There were about 6 beautiful Sushi size slices. After grilled well on on side, flipped over and grilled few minutes, the juicy meat with a great flavor worked beautifully. I was happy. Then our waiter with sexy accent and dark hair from Russia suggested to try Rosu - ribeye. We also had it with Takashi sauce and it was even better than Kalbi. It was more juicier.  First bite gave me a big smile on my face. Then, I was looking at the wall of writing and cute cartoons and found grilled meat is also good wrapping with veggie leaves but it was after we finished all the meat and we were already full. I would definitely want to try that next time.To end the meal, we had jane d. ordered again. We had all the interesting toppings (rice flour dumplings, Black sesame soybean flour, Asuki sweet beans and Green tea syrup) with Home-Made Madagascar Vanilla ice cream.

In this instance the garlic overrode all flavors leaving only itself as a bold flavor.

652,6kqfRFrGhODUpaw2vefOag,Lindsay H.,4.0 star rating,"Let me just start by saying this place is terrific. I came here this past weekend with my boyfriend after seeing that Anthony Bourdain came here on the television. We came with no reservation and hungry bellies. Though the hostess said the wait might be up to an hour/hour and a half, we put our name down and gave her our phone number in case that hour was really shorter. Lo and behold, we were called about 30 minutes after we put our name in and, when we arrived, we were promptly sat. We were then served small portions of kimchi, a simple salad and a bean sprouts/nuts salad to share (t'was delicious... I would have ordered more kimchi... Ah well, next time). Since this was our first time at Takashi, we were a little stumped on what to order, but our waiter was extremely helpful, friendly and attentive. After mulling over the menu, we decided on the bone marrow and crawfish dumplings, the Horumon-Moriawase (which was the chef's selection of sweetbreads, heart, stomach and liver), the Harami and the beef belly. I had never had that many parts of a cow in one night and, let me tell you, I don't regret this experience being my first time ;). Although I don't remember which was which, I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor and different textures of each cow part (although some pieces were a little chewy). I think as long as you can turn off your brain and not think about exactly what part of the cow you're cooking and eating, you'll have a good time. I recommend getting the Takashi sauce... It comes in a little dish and you can choose to dip or not dip! For dessert I got the vanilla icecream with the green tea syrup. It tasted like a green tea latte but better cause the vanilla was made with real vanilla bean. Oh yum. What really sent me over the edge was that on Fridays and Saturdays, they close the cooking stations at 11pm and reopen at midnight for ramen. JUST RAMEN. Since my boyf is a massive fan of ramen (and because we were eating at the restaurant until about 11:30ish), we decided to take a walk around the block and build up an appetite for part 2 of our Takashi experience. Conveniently, they had an opening for a midnight reservation for ramen, so we took that and came back. The ramen did not disappoint... I can honestly say it was the best ramen I've had in the city. It's a shame it's only served on Fridays and Saturdays between midnight and 1am... I understand why there is always a line here. Such a cool idea. When I'm back in the area on a weekend, I'm bringin' friends... Mainly so I can try more food and not be too full to finish the ramen. Oh!

Everything was excellent. Although when ordering that much meat, things start to taste the same with differences only within texture.Given the opportunity to do it all over again I would be none the happier to lean towards their specials, while sticking to just a few of my favorite parts of the cow for grilling.By the way it was an hour wait to get in without a reservation and we were given slightly more than 2 hours to finish our meal because it was extremely busy.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

655,J91Z-EF0G8n8rSj4EJKqqw,Asuka N.,4.0 star rating,"I had read about Takashi some time ago as the place to go for all sorts of tasty cuts of meat, as well as some more exotic dishes if you're feeling adventurous. After a couple years, I finally managed to venture out here with my fiancee this past weekend. It's not a huge space, and it definitely has a lot more seating options for parties larger than 2 - so I'd suggest you actually come here in a group. Otherwise, you'll probably have to get lucky like we did and get a seat at the bar (kind of like sitting at a sushi bar), which seems almost specifically designed for 2 people. The service is pretty solid - the waiters here have a very good grasp of the menu and, more importantly, how long you need to cook everything - this is pretty important on these various cuts of meat, as overcooking (in particular) can easily ruin the experience. And although the hostess can take your coat for you, it's up to you to fetch it from the closet behind the bar - so if you'd rather not sort through and figure out which coat is yours (you don't get a ticket either), you're probably better off keeping it with you.As for the food, it's pretty straightforward - you can order cooked appetizers or raw meat dishes (like tartare), along with different cuts of meat to grill in front of you - very much like Korean BBQ. We didn't want to go too adventurous our first time here, so we started out with the niku-uni (sea urchin on top of a cut of raw chuck) and the foie gras burger in chocolate BBQ sauce. While the niku-uni looks amazing, and the sea urchin does taste pretty good, I wasn't blown away - mainly because the chuck doesn't really have a distinguishing taste. By the time you get down to the meat, it's overpowered by the flavor of the shiso leaf as well. The burger is really more like a meatball (it comes in a mini cast-iron pot with no bun), but it's delicious. The beef is really good quality, and the foie gras isn't overpowering - just enough to up the fatty level. Combined with a slightly spiced BBQ sauce that has an overpowering chocolate flavor, and you get a dish that is either an appetizer or dessert but is absolutely delicious as either. For the main course, we ended up choosing 3 cuts of meat - the beef belly, the cheek, and the 'tongue experience', which is comprised of 3 different parts of beef tongue. For the uninitiated, the cheek was closest to a regular cut of meat, and it's really good with the salt rub. You only sear it for half a minute on each side, but it's basically like a more succulent, richly-flavored version of bacon. The belly was amazing...it's different from pork belly in that it's definitely fattier, but it just melts in your mouth with each bite. As for the tongue...it's quite an experience indeed. My favorite cut is the second one (it's the one that looks most like a regular piece of meat on the plate) - it doesn't fall apart in your mouth, but it's not overly chewy. The main part of the tongue has a tough texture, particularly if you cook it too long (which I did). The tongue tip is definitely the most 'meaty' part of the tongue and has an interesting texture, to say the least. I will say that the sauces really do work well to add flavor to all of the meats - they do a very good job in adding a dash of flavor to the different cuts. I'd also recommend the red wine that's oak aged and has a smokey aroma (I forget what it's called) - it really, really works well with all the beef that you eat at the meal.In all, Takashi is a place where you can eat all sorts of interesting and different kinds of meats. Most of the dishes were delicious, but there are others that I wasn't as big a fan of, mainly in the context of price. If anything, my main complaint would be that the appetizers feel very overpriced next to the main courses. The niku uni is $24 - very reasonable for 4 pieces, but given the flavor of the chuck gets lost amongst everything else, I definitely didn't feel like I ate $24 worth of 'sushi'. The beef burger was delicious, but at $20 - it was quite expensive given the size. If you're looking to keep expenses at a reasonable level, just stick with the main meat dishes. You won't necessarily get the huge portions you might at some joint in K-Town, but you're also getting a lot of different meats that you very well won't find anywhere else.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"
656,AC6aUmsBpFDquStla05cdA,Nick B.,5.0 star rating,"After reading and hearing so many good things about Takashi, I had to find out for myself. I was not disappointed. Arrived with 4 of my friends for our 9 o'clock reservation and were seated promptly for the experience we were about to be served. Takashi does not take reservations for parties less than 4.Since we were a decent sized group of 5 adventurous, and hungry, diners, we decided it would be smart to basically order a variety of things off the menu and try each others dishes. First courses: I knew coming in of two dishes I needed to have. The first was Niku-Uni.  A raw sashimi like cut of flank steak served over a piece of nori and a shisu leaf, topped with a large pile of sea urchin. The dish was served with soy sauce which was necessary to complete the flavor of the dish. In what was to become an apparent trend, Takashi does not serve a dish with a sauce, or accompaniment as something optional. Each sauce or seasoning is designed to complete the flavor of what's in front of you. If there's a soy sauce, dip in it, if there's a lemon, squeeze it. The difference and enhancement of with vs. without is noticeable. Capish? Following the Niku-Uni we ordered what was to be one of the greatest things I have ever tasted. The foie gras stuffed Kobe burger served with a quail egg and chocolate BBQ sauce was unbelievable. Sound over the top? It is. But who cares, I could have ended the meal with that and left happy it was that good. We also had to order the Testi-cargo which lived up to its name, cow balls prepared escargot style, and tasted, well, like escargot. Delicious. An order of Achilles tendon, beef shank with steamed buns and spicy mayo finished our selection of appetizers. Main Courses:Never before have I seen a restaurant that uses one animal so efficiently. Each piece of cow is skillfully cut, prepared, and served so that while you're eating the same animal, every bite is different. For the table we selected a couple orders of skirt steak, beef cheek, tongue, sweetbreads, aorta, and belly. All were fresh and amazing in their own way, but the two that stick out in my mind are undoubtedly the skirt steak and sweetbreads. We all know how delicious skirt steak is to begin with, and while Takashi is full of much more adventurous cuts of beef, their cut of skirt takes the meat to a different level. It was melt in your mouth, the fat marbleized to perfection. The sweetbreads developed a beautiful char on the outside from the grill and barely had to be chewed they were so tender. The flavor was mild and fresh, complemented perfectly with the sauce it was served with.Needless to say, I will be going back soon.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"
657,Y0MHyyVyJL8NB-41lMaEUQ,Jess K.,5.0 star rating,"Takashi was one of my most memorable meals in NYC. This restaurant was recommended to my boyfriend and I, so we ventured out one sunny Friday evening and fortunately were able to score two seats at the counter. This prime seating gave us the perfect vantage point to watch the chefs in action, masterfully preparing the meats, artfully arranging the plates in mouth-watering and visually aesthetic ways that created lots of excitement and curiosity for us.Our waitress was kind and bubbly and guided us through the menu, explaining how the plates are served, her recommendations, and the specials of the day.Where to begin... the menu was extensive and had a nice array of meat varieties from sweet breads to tongue to stomach. I'm not the most adventurous eater per se, but deferred to our waitress and my boyfriend to select what ended up being one of my most favorite food journeys.We started with beef tartar with a quail egg on top, it was delightful and tantalizing, the raw meat was marinated in a delicious sauce and was hands down the best tartar I've ever had. Next up was the shabu shabu. Our waitress sparked up the grill in front of us and directed us to place the bowl of shabu shabu directly on the grill and dip the meat into the broth for a few seconds -- the dense miso flavor was amazing and once delightedly finished our meat, our waitress poured the broth into two glasses for us to drink, it was amazing. The marriage of flavors was amazing.We also ended up ordering a selection of meats to grill, each was perfectly marinated. Each was unique and very fresh.Our meal continued on and we noticed a camera crew filming in the restaurant. Rusty on my Japanese skills, but in a state of food utopia I engaged the camera crew in Japanese asking what they were taping... it ended up being Tokyo's version of the Today show... impressed by the novelty of a petite white girl speaking Japanese they interviewed my boyfriend and me on what we ate. The unique experience only added to the specialness of the evening. We did end up on TV and do look forward to our return to Takashi.

You have ENTIRE 40 minutes so it's more than enough.""The hostess looked 10 years old, and maybe with her hostess salary she never afforded to eat at Takashi. You can't eat appetizers, grill up raw beef, eat desert with a bottle of sake (maybe more) in 40 minutes.My boyfriend said to her right away, ""This is very rude.

He very respectfully asked us if we would be kind enough to move to the table and he would really take care of us.And oh my, did he take care of us.The waitress was also amazing.

It just worked perfectly together.  If they wanted to make them the size of a regular burger and charge me $40 for it, I'd pay it. Oxtail Pie---so good it's stupid.  They ARE very small, and usually with apps you tend to share....but with these I don't think it's crazy getting one per person.  I promise you if you split it in half you'll wish you had another half.  Heck, I wish I had a bag of them with a half pint of that dipping sauce, I'd put them away like I was eating milk and cookies.Yooke---I ordered this on the suggestion of the other Yelpers and I'm glad I did.  My first tartare and I must say I'm absolutely smitten.  This dish is a must have to start off, no if's and's or buts.  Yooke.  Now.  Do it.Kalbi---short rib that you grill.  I mean, c'mon it's short rib.  Everybody loves short rib.Beef Belly---yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes.  YEEEEEES!!!!!!Mino---1st stomach and my first time eating 1st stomach.  Chewy as I'm sure you can imagine, but when the flavor is that nice chewy is a good thing.Shibire---also my first time eating sweet breads and I am very upset I've been alive for 34 years and have never had this.   Shame on me!Tsurami---beef cheek.  Let's get one thing straight.  The cheeks of anything are one of the most delicious parts of whatever it is.  I will fight you on this.Shio-Tan---beef tongue.  My second time eating tongue and I'm very quickly becoming a fan.Bukadan---rice bomb with Korean seaweed and pickled sesame leaf.  The waitress asked if we wanted to add this on and I said no at first but the two girls in our party wanted some rice, so I said ""Sure.""  I couldn't believe how good these were.  It was sticky rice that tasted as though it were wrapped in the salty ocean, but in a such a magnificently perfect way.....*sigh*   swooooooooon!All these dishes weren't just great because of the specific cuts or quality but also the seasonings and marinades Takishi uses.   The flavors are big and bright but subtle at the same time...if that makes any sense.  I applaud you,Takashi.  If I were rich I'd eat here multiple a week on a consistent basis, but I'm not, so I'll settle for once every few months.  One thing is for sure, I will be counting the days down to my next visit each time.Price range-----a drinker with an appetite, you're looking at no less than $100 per head easy.   The four of us spent $105 each last night, including tip, but if we didn't have to meet friends somewhere else we VERY easily could have spent more.  But again, more than well worth it.Fyi, I have no clue how I managed to type this review considering how grotesquely hung over I am right now, to the point I have no will to re-read this.   So if it sounds like poop......eh, what can I say?  You take the good you take the bad you take 'em both and there you have.............",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

Located on Hudson Street in the West Village Takashi Inoue opened his small restaurant in the spring of 2010. Hailing from Osaka, Inoue spent a year sourcing out the cuts he now serves at the 34-seat restaurant. He specializes in beef and here you can try anything from beef tongue to heart and every intestine in between. Yes, Takashi is not for everyone. It's a place that needs an introduction and one that you'll either fall in love with or avoid at all costs. For those who dare the yakiniku experience here is authentic and an elegant affair. The meats from Dickson's and Pat LaFrieda are marinated in a sweet-salty mixture and grilled on high tech infrared grills built into the tables. If you're squeamish about trying organs start with the muscle-based cuts first like tongue, cheek, and even heart. Then you can work your way towards sweetbreads and the various intestines. Aside from the grilled meats a must-try item in Takashi's menu is the niku-uni, a piece of sea urchin on top of a thin slice of raw, marbled steak placed on top of a shiso leaf and nori. You eat it like a piece of sushi, wrap it slightly, dip in soy sauce and consume. It is sublime. The complex flavor of sea urchin contrasts with the oils of the steak and balanced by the herbaceous shiso. Now after you've been thoroughly educated on the various cuts of beef and you wish for something sweet, the single dessert item on the menu, the soft-serve ice cream is one of the best you'll find in this city.

A few weeks ago Anthony Bourdain premiered a new show called The Layover.  It just so happened that Bourdain stops in Takashi, one of his favorite new restaurants. While its awesome that he went there, it is slightly less awesome in that the lines are now going to be crazy.My friend and I showed up to Takashi at about 5:20, ten minutes before they opened and a line was already forming. You can make reservations if you are 4 or more people, but being two, we had to just hope we'd get there in time for a seat. It turned out we could sit, but only for an hour. The tables are small, seating about 4-6 people and have a grill in the center. The dishes at Takashi are either raw meats or meats that come raw that you cook on your personal grill. I can't stress enough the freshness of the meat, maybe some of the freshest, tastiest meat I've had at any restaurant in Manhattan, or anywhere.The food here isn't cheap either, as you can imagine. When you get meat this fresh, I suppose you have to expect that to be the case. After ordering, I noticed the tables next to ours with the same dishes, so I knew we did something right. We started with to raw dishes: Yooke, which was thinly sliced chuck tartare with a raw quail egg and seaweed as well as the Niku-Uni which was raw chuck flap with sea urchin and fresh wasabi. The latter of the raw dishes was something Bourdain ate on the show and with my love of Uni, I knew I had to order it. The tartare is a nice size appetizer portion, as are most of the raw dishes. The chuck/uni dish was served four to an order. At $6 a piece, its not cheap, but its also one of the most delicious bites of food I've had in a while -- well worth it.As for the grilling part of the meal, we only ended up getting sweetbreads and beef belly. There were plenty of other more adventerous dishes that I would love to come back and try, but the belly and sweetbreads were out of this world. I've had sweetbreads that are usually pan fried, so this lightly grilled version was new to me. I could have sat there and eaten 20 of those little pieces. Each serving of the cook-to-order meats are small, about 6-8 pieces. You can easily rack up a big bill eating these little bites, but again, fresh meat, tender, cooked to perfection.There are plenty of other options here, though they all revolve around meat. I'd love to get the tongue experience, which sounds like a tongue tasting menu. Also, trying the ""chefs"" selection would be a nice meal as well.If you love beef, you will love Takashi. Make sure you come early or get a group and make a reservation. I'd imagine the wait at a regular eating time would be over an hour or more.

Tried the sweetbreads (glands this time) as well and they were OK - have had better.  $105/each for food, two bottles of wine (rioja), two bottles of sake (the one unfiltered option, which is not as sweet as they say in the best sense btw), and at least twelve rounds of meat for six plus apps, including tip!  Imagine you could easily tone it down if you leave the party people with good taste at home/come with a smaller group and stick to the basics.

Fioe Gras Stuffed Mini Kobe Burger with Chocolate BBQ Sauce.  Comes with a sunny-side up quail egg and dowsed with the BBQ sauce.  It was like a delicious savory burger for dessert but as an appetizer.  The grilled meats came next, which had a choice of two sauces:  Seasoned with salt, garlic and sesame oil;   Marinated in Takashi's sauce       We had a portion of the Seasoned Rosu (ribeye) that we grilled to a perfect medium rare and a spritz of lemon.  Not sure it needed the lemon, but the meat was tender and tasted great.  Then we had the Horumon-Moriawase (chef's selection) marinated in Takashi's sauce ...which consisted of the following below:Mino (first stomach) Akasen (fourth stomach) Hatsu (heart)Shibire (sweetbreads)Kimo (liver) We both liked them all accept the 4th stomach.  It was really chewy and neither of us loved the consistency.  The flavor wasn't all that special either.  But the sweetbreads were amazing.  The liver was flavorful and tasty as was the heart.  Portions were a wee bit small, but still ultimately enough to split between two people.And we also had a bowl of rice. We wound up waiting a long time from when we put our name in, so the host was super kind and wound up comping the first round of drinks.  Patience, people!  The service otherwise was very helpful in our decision making for our dinner as well as sauce choices.  Will definitely try to come back and try some more adventurous parts of the cow!",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

Our server was more than willing to walk us through the menu and make menu recommendations. She was great. Takashi is perfect for a late dinner with friends or a hot date. As for the food, there is one downside. The various specials, bites and raw courses are so incredibly tasty that the main attraction (grilled meats) ended up being a let down. Grandmom's steamed beef shank buns are absolutely essential and the Yooke (beef tartare) ridiculous and unfortunately, nearly spoiled the rest of our meal. I'm sure the beef belly was great, but a few small pieces of grilled marinated meat couldn't hold up to the heavenly first course. I did enjoy the sweatbreads however, and for New York, the final tab was VERY reasonable.Don't take my lack of excitement for the main course as a reason not to go.

And since we were a party of 2, we thought ordering both would be too many raw beef appetizers. Since we couldn't decide, we ordered both - and both were kind of disappointing.NIKU-UNI: This would have been better with just the Uni, Shiso leaf, and Nori. The large raw beef slice just made it chewy, where we wanted it to be crisp (from the Nori) and creamy (from the Uni). If you're an Uni-lover, this dish will probably piss you off.YOOKE: Needs apple or pear! Takashi just includes the beef and a quail egg yolk, whereas most places will also serve it with thin slices of apple, pear, and/or cucumber. I'd rather have this dish at Woo Lae Oak, anywhere in K-Town, or even Shabu Tatsu. On the plus side, the beef itself was definitely high-quality. No arguments there!TONGUE EXPERIENCE: I've had premium tongue at Gyu-Kaku, and I preferred that tongue much better - less chewy. I'll keep this one short and let you use your imagination here...--Overall, I thought this place was solid - just not amazing. Their meat is top-quality, and that's what you get.

I've eaten there twice now and have left hungry both times despite doing my best to avoid looking at the prices. It's probably the best yakiniku in NYC but I guess it's not good enough to make me go back. In fact, having just eaten at Yakiniku West a week earlier, I'd rather go back there since the price difference is so significant.I have to add before I go on that I have had Yakiniku in Tokyo - mindblowing - and at the infamous Totoraku in LA, which can rightfully be designated as a meat heaven. Takashi does their best imitation but it's really not in the same tier.We started with the kobe beef sashimi and the kobe beef burger appetizers and both were mediocre. In fact, the sashimi was kind of cold - seems like it may have been frozen? Or just overly chilled? The sashimi has uni sitting on top and I really only tasted the uni. The burgers are good but aren't all burgers good? For the price, give me Shake Shack. Oh the burger meat comes in a chocolatey sauce that some people might love. I enjoyed it but wouldn't mind never tasting it again. We then proceeded to all sorts of meats. I left with the same impression as the first time. All I really wanted to eat was the belly and the galbi, which were both extremely marbled and yummy. We even ordered extra portions of this. Here's where I get picky. I loved it and it's the best I've had in NYC but it doesn't stack up to other yakiniku places that I have tried so for the price I still dont' like it. One great thing is their $20 corkage for sake, meaning you can bring your own giant bottle and enjoy plenty of sake with your meal. All in all, it's a good meal but it's not really ""meat heaven.""

After 1 1/2 hours, he called and hung up immediately. We called back. The phone rang a long time. When he answered he said we could be seated if we were there very quickly.

The meat and offal products here are top notch.  Their meat is supplied by Japanese Premium Beef, or Bohemian fame. Some cuts were so so, but other were beyond amazing.  The kalbi was perfectly marbled and was the best kalbi I have tasted in NYC, even tastier than from any Korean BBQ restaurant.  The portions are not big here, and the kalbi is boneless, but trust me, it is Japanese quality good.The secret kimchi, that is brought out upon request, trumps the default kimchi. I also enjoyed the Sweetbreads and Heart.  The Liver was okay.  I wasn't too keen on the different intestinal parts or the tongue.  I usually am a huge fan of tongue, but the tongue here was on the rubbery side rather than the juicy fatty side. I did not have to pay for my meal, so don't have a good gauge on how much it would have cost, although I do know that dining here is pricey.  Therefore, Takashi is great, but not the type of place you can dine at frequently.

If I had an ounce more pluck, I would congratulate them on guessing my second favorite food. I love sweetbreads first, and then I love tongue. I am writing this with a straight face.Returning to New York City for only a day and a half visit, a year after I'd moved to Los Angeles, I spent hours researching just the right restaurants to invest my time and money in. Takashi was the easiest choice. New York Magazine's 2010 Best Of issue awarded it best offal, mentioning a dish called the ""tongue experience."" Their website confirmed they had sweetbreads, as well as the first and fourth stomach, large intestines, heart, and various other beef cuts. If an appetite for sidemeat is your Achilles' heel, try the Achilles tendon!Imagine my surprise, though, when I was sat at the bar around the chefs' prep area with a personal grill in front of me, and realized I would be barbecuing these meats myself. It's hard not to think about the animal when I'm handling raw meat, but enter the menu: the first page specifies exactly where the meat is sourced from (farms in upstate New York and Oregon), how it's raised (grass fed, hormone and antibiotic free, and pasture raised), and who distributes it (Dickson's Farmstand in Chelsea Market and Pat LaFrieda).As the grill heated up and began to warm my face, I was served bowls of very bright, pungent, spicy kimchee; bean sprouts with a fantastic umami quality; and cabbage salad with a sweet ginger miso dressing that was so delicious I would later use it as a dipping sauce--probably much to the staff's dismay, but they'd never show it. My spunky server never left me waiting, wondering what would happen next, and she didn't hover either.The ""tongue experience"" included four to six pieces each from the front of the tongue, back of the tongue, and bottom of the tongue, seasoned with salt, garlic, and sesame oil. I've always had tongue sliced all the way through, so this proved to be an experience for my tongue too. The front pieces were cut in a special way to tenderize it, but it was still chewy. I recommend ordering the bottom only, if you can do it.The sweetbreads will last in my memory for years to come. Ten slices (or what I think amounted to five sweetbreads as ordered from most restaurants) laid in a platter of Takashi's sauce, a savory and sweet barbecue marinade, with green onion and sesame seeds. I was encouraged to cook them two minutes per side, but rather than use my cell phone timer, I gauged doneness with my body clock, and the look and texture of each piece. I learned a lot of the sweetbreads I've eaten are overcooked, and I found an entirely new appreciation for this playful food.I had brought a New Yorker to read during my meal, but in more than an hour I only read a couple of pages. This food was seriously fun. And for the tongue experience, sweetbreads, a large Sapporo, and a grateful tip, I still only spent about $50.One of the best meals I ever had in New York City.

Yakiniku is supposed to be prepared through fresh livestock, and be never frozen. Their offal (including stomach, intestine, liver, tongue) is most likely fresh, but where is it coming from? Anyways, they seem to clean it up and marinate the goodies well.5/5 for great and friendly service/staff, but FAIL with the price.  If you would like to leave the restaurant feeling like you've just had dinner, please expect to spend at least *** $90 or so per person *** on food only, excluding adult beverages and gratuity.For those reading, if you are heading over there: Here's an idea of what you are getting into. Trust me it's good, but simply expensive.- For the appetizer, The following shall be considered and highly recommended. Go for the sea urchin ($24) as well as the their special appetizer ($22?), which is literally a sushi made with beef. Unfortunately, you only get three pieces of beef sushi. (1) raw beef, (2) semi cooked/torched and (3) thinly sliced and marinated.- Get the short rib ($22) and rib eye ($26). Be ready to order at least 3 or more orders per person otherwise, you will be extremely hungry or possibly furious and angry.  Please note, each order comes with approximately 5 or 6 pieces of finger sized raw meat and they are thin.- Give ""tongue"" ($18) a try. Your perspective on relating tongue as part of the red meat diet will definitely change. This is a must have and go on a expedition by placing at least one order and if you like it, order more for the table.- For 99% percent of the population, none of the names for their offal will make any sense, unless you are a medical student or a doctor. If you and your group is ready for the challenge, instead of gambling with the individual orders, please just an order ""Horumon"" ($30) a Chef's mixed selection of stomach, intestine, sweetbread and etc.- Fresh vegitables; it's called ""Ssam"" ($15?). You will enjoy the mix of fresh vegetables along with the miso/mayo combo as a dressing/dip. A perfect partner for your medium rare rib-eye.There is a great chance that you will be hungry after your main entree (Yakiniku - cooking your own goodies).

When you arrive, the server brings over cabbage and kimchi. Tells you its complimentary. Really? Complimentary cabbage.. thanks. At Mandangsui you get so much more. Maybe about 8 different small plates of veggies. Hmph. We asked for some tea to help with digestion. Guess what? THEY DO NOT HAVE TEA!!!!! Really? What kind of Asian place does not serve tea?!We ordered Kalbi, Harami and a chefs selection which included the heart. It was okay, but the individual orders were super small. Probably about 2-3 oz worth of meat, and super overpriced. On the menu, it says they order their beef from Chelsea Market. If its that accessible, would you think they would be cutting costs a bit by purchasing locally?I'm glad I took my mom here, and not one of my friends. We would of been upset at the bill, and the service was mediocre. The restaurant is super small and the counter bench seating is super uncomfortable.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

I've always come with Japanese folk (and tokyo peeps says this is just like yakiniku at home) and the clientele tends to be skewed but it's very friendly to all.  Service was amazing first time (a gaijin who spoke perfect japanese too!), and it was decent the second time.  Bit of a hipster vibe, but the prices are kinda baller.  Love the cartoon mural on the wall explaining all the different cuts and how to grill.

772,O_onR3HUrk1OR7YPLp3jmQ,Jane D.,4.0 star rating,"Where's the beef? If you ever find yourself pondering this profound philosophical question, the chances are good that you haven't yet been to Takashi, a one-month-old, self-designated ""all beef"" restaurant. This label isn't entirely accurate, since Takashi does offer a number of vegetable sides, and delicious ones at that. We started with the seasonal namul, which included fiddlehead ferns, sugar snap peas, okra, beets, tomato, zucchini and a green that I think was edible chrysanthemum. The okra was particularly noteworthy, slightly spicy and unabashedly ""slimy"" (or ""slippery"" depending on whom you ask). It's a texture that many Asians prize, i.e. in the form of natto or grated mountain yam. The preparation, here, is delicious. Beef is the Big Man on Campus, though, and it is unimpeachably fresh. You can eat almost any part of the cow from the tip of the tongue to the first or fourth stomach to the Achilles tendon -- and you can have it as sashimi, grilled, in hot pot, or as part of a noodle soup. Call ahead for sashimi preparations as some cuts are only served on certain days of the week. Beef liver is only available on Wednesdays, for instance. We ordered for grilling: - Hatsu (heart)- Shibire (sweetbreads)- Nakaochi Kalbi (the cut of meat between ribs)- tongue sampler with three different cuts of tongueThe meats were all very lightly marinated in your choice of either (1) sesame oil, salt and garlic; or (2) in the miso-based house sauce. The light marination was a fitting, respectful treatment for such fresh, high quality meat, as it kept the focus on the meat's natural flavors. Sweetbreads marinated in the so-called ""Takashi's sauce"" are among the best I've ever had. Purists should take note that the grills are electric, not charcoal-fired.  And traditionalists should note that you will need to order your rice and vegetable plates, with lettuce for wrapping around the meat, separately. (Our meal did come with three complimentary banchan: a Japanese-style, mild gimuchi; soybean sprouts with sesame oil; and raw cabbage salad with miso-ginger dressing.) To be fair, both the rice and vegetable plates were unusually high quality. The vegetable plate included sesame leaves, red romaine, boiled cabbage, fantastically sweet baby carrots just out of the ground, chives, red onion slivers, tomato, cucumber, daikon and watercress. No garlic to my surprise. The only dessert currently on the menu is housemade Madagascar vanilla soft serve ice cream. We ordered the one with all the toppings: rice-flour dumplings, black sesame and soybean flour, sweet red adzuki beans and green tea syrup. In part because I wasn't really in the mood for dessert and don't love soft serve no matter how well made it is, the sundae didn't really move me. But I appreciated the unusual toppings. The sake and beer lists are relatively short, but include a few interesting options like a light, Kenyan beer. Prices are higher than you'll pay for barbecue in Koreatown and portions are smaller -- but the quality of the meat is so high that it's worth the occasional splurge, IMO.

That said, the taste comes from impeccable beef found and selected by Takashi, as well as masterful marinades and cures.Takashi is not for everyone, however - most offal cuts may be downright scary for some ( try liver sashimi, or dishes made with every part of beef stomach). Also, the dining room is quite small, and table space gets pretty hot from the heat-blasting grills.I can't tell you how interesting, intriguing and adventurous the meal at Takashi really was, it was also exceptionally tasteful and satisfying.

Takashi offers first stomach, fourth stomach, heart, liver, cheek, sweetbread, and multiple cuts of tongue, all deliberately sourced and each uniquely delicious.  I found the tongue in particular to be absurdly good: tender, beefy, and robust enough to stand up to the sea salt and sesame oil, three plates of the stuff was not enough.Embracing the tradition of Korean barbecue to which yakiniku owes its roots, Takashi elevates the artform with beef that tastes like beef (a disturbing rarity among restaurants of this nature.)The ice cream is delicious and by all means try the Niku-uni (worthy of the buzz it's getting, but I found the roasted seaweed a distraction from the otherwise perfect trifecta of marbled beef, creamy uni and refreshing shiso.)  But don't let those things distract you from the star of the show and enjoying every part of it.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

824,qM8Lw34fL9BjjJ9w9dFsnQ,The World Digested A.,3.0 star rating,"What is the purpose of eating in a restaurant? It is to eat good food cooked by someone else: meaning, the food had better be superior to one's own cooking, and the dishes should arrive at the table ready to be savored. For this very reason, I have been perplexed by the raison d'être of yakiniku restaurants (Japanese Korean Barbecue), where the diners are expected to cook - grill - their own food - meat - (leaving aside, obviously, those side dishes) and serve themselves- wrap the meats in raw vegetables. Thus, as it appears, each diner is ultimately responsible for the outcome of their grilling skill. Where is the real chef?  However, what does cooking really entail? Of all of these myriad tasks and sub-tasks, however, a diner in a yakiniku restaurant is charged with only one job: Grilling. And yet, the meat at Takashi is already an almost complete and final product even before you grill them: Many cuts of the meat can be eaten raw. Most critically, however, grilling at Takashi is a fail-proof procedure, thanks to the special grill at Takashi. No, the grill at is not the traditional shichirin, which uses coal; instead, the grill at Takashi, uses far-infrared rays to cook the meat. Therefore, the ingredient can seal in its moisture better - less shrinkage - due to the fact that the far-infrared rays reach inside the food to cook them inside out. Hence, there is much less risk of burning; and as a result, no hardened surface on the meat. Furthermore, there is 50% less smoke compared to using shichirin or gas grills. Grilling meat at Takashi, then, is no more and no less than dipping your already perfect sushi into soy sauce. The Raw Hatsu - heart (yes, you have guessed correctly) - sashimi was the special of the day. The light crunch of raw heart tasted nutty, which responded well to the sweet tare (sauce) and the citrusy, gentle kick from the lemon. Namagimo, purple slivers of raw liver - drizzled with sesame oil and covered in scallions and sesame seeds - were dense and viscous; and yet as soon as it seemed to cling to your tongue, it broke apart and melted away, leaving a faint lemony tang to clean up the heaviness. Yooke - the hand-cut long and square strands of beef tartare - were a novelty in terms of raw meat texture: the ropes of chuck-eye provided a sufficient chew, as opposed to the accustomed soft grounded meats as used in a French tartare - a bovine interpretation of ""al dente"" - due to the excellent quality of the beef. The sweet soy-based sauce bound all the toppings - the nutty Korean seaweed, egg yolk, shiso leaf (even dressed prettily with yellow flowers) - together into a miniature raw food heaven (I can stay on this diet for a while). The Grilled MeatsKalbi - the short rib cut without the bones - was tender without being overly fatty. The special of the day, the beef belly, was well-marbled without any clogging heaviness, and sweeter than kalbi. The Tasting of Tongue - composed of tan-saki (tip), tan-suji (tendon) and tan-moto (rear) - were unexpectedly chewy for the human tongue used to the unrealistically rich and decadently marbled wagyu tongue. Each part of the tongue was cut differently for maximum enjoyment: The tip was cross-cut like a rose-colored chrysanthemum for being the chewiest; the tougher moto was sliced thin like a ravioli sheet, and the suji, laced with white tendon, was thickly cut for the ultimate mouthful blow of bovine chew. The simple salted and peppered sesame oil smoothed out the leaner American beef tongues. The first of the Tasting of Horumon - akasen (fourth stomach) - proved to be the most resilient and elastic with a serious fight against your teeth. The earthy kimo (liver) became the consistency of a melted Mars bar on the hot grill with similar aftertaste of sweet muddiness. Conversely, hatsu (heart) was crunchier upon hitting the grill, compared to its raw, natural state. Mino, the mild, ivory-colored first stomach, was chubbily cut for the full mouthful sensation, to which a dollop of the yuzu-chili paste provided a lasting stimulant. Lastly but not the least, shibire (sweetbreads) transformed into deathly molten bombs of delectable creaminess. Tetchan - the large intestines - must have been cleaned and washed and trimmed incessantly and insanely to attain such purity. Being extremely fatty and therefore flammable (warned by our waiter, although we did not witness such a spectacle to our disappointment), the outer layer was grilled over their special grill to a nicely browned and chewy crisp; while the inside remained liquid, yes, liquid. But my favorite was harami, the outside skirt. The lean meat was nevertheless tender and bursting with full flavor. Perhaps, the particular cow laughed a lot - or hiccupped a lot - so its diaphragm was particularly well-exercised and flexible. The complimentary cabbage, by the way, proved to be creepingly addictive.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

Next up - the Horumon-Moriawase - which consisted of the Mino, first stomach, Tetchan, the large intestine, Hatsu, the heart, Shibire, sweetbreads, and Kimo, the liver.  The texture and the tastes are exquisite and intense.  Remember, this meat is cut thin and marinated, so all it needs is a light sear to bring out the flavor of the meats.  It is necessary to open up your horizons to the organs, arguably more of a delicacy and way more delicious than just flesh.Finally, the Tsurami, the cheek, which for the most part is the most tender piece of most animals.  This is cooked for 30 seconds on each side and absolutely melts in your mouth.The sake and beer selection is nominal, so if you're expecting to go for a great sake selection, look elsewhere.All in all, phenomenal and very authentic experience.  The Korean inspired flavors sure added a lot to this meal as all BBQ is not created equal!",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

The first dish to arrive was Niku-Uni (chuck flap topped with sea urchin and fresh wasabi), followed by Stewed Beef Tendon Casserole, and Bake-It-Yourself Oxtail and Potato Curry Pie. The first dish was featured on The Layover, and was just as spectacular as it Bourdain claimed it was. Tender, delicate, rich - the meat falls apart on your tongue and you think it's all over, but then shiso, seaweed, and wasabi all gang up on and remind you that its only a beginning. It's all quite sexy. But THEN came the Big Kahuna, a potent combination of Fioe Gras, Kobe Beef, and Chocolate BBQ Sauce - that can only be described as NC-17 flavors for your taste buds! I kid you not. This is better than falling in love for the first time.The beef cheek and sweetbreads were perfectly marinated and cooked by our waiter.

Ordered the raw beef with uni wrapped in shiso leaf and seaweed to start since everyone raved about it. I gotta say, my first bite was disappointing. The shiso leaf completely overwhelmed the other flavors, including the sea urchin. For my second bite, I tore off more than half of the shiso leaf and was then able to experience the unctuous, super fresh uni. So glad I did. I don't think the beef really added anything to the dish. It was all about the uni for me.From the grilled section we got the tongue experience, the cheek, and the chef's selection of the day which included stomach, liver, sweetbreads, and heart. Everything was pretty good, especially when dipped in the sauces they provide. The standout for both me and my companion were the sweetbreads. Those were so flavorful and the texture was almost like butter. I also enjoyed the cheek and was pleasantly surprised by how good the stomach was. They have a nice beer selection (I love Yebisu) and it goes perfectly with all the salty, fatty meat. We had lots of fun grilling everything ourselves and watched my cell phone stopwatch carefully so nothing was over or under cooked. We ended with the soft serve vanilla ice cream with salted caramel sauce. So glad they have that option because it was the perfect ending to a special meal.

We were seated at the far end of the bar, facing the immaculate open kitchen staffed by a couple young looking Japanese guys. Takashi himself was presiding over the whole operation and came by our table several times to comment on when the meats were perfectly done and which way to try certain dishes. When the owner pays this much attention, you can almost guarantee an impeccable dining experience. We started with 3 appetizers, each served beautifully with much attention to artful presentation. The Uni was the best that I've had on the east coast and was placed on a slab of what appeared to be Wagyu beef or just a very marbled sliver of beef, either way the combination, placed atop a shiso leaf with nori was memorable. We followed with the cow testicles app, which was served escargot style in a shiso garlic butter. As we gobbled up these little wonders, we commented on how great it would have been if we had some bread to soak up the sauce. Takashi, seemingly telepathic, brought over some delicious slivers of rye bread to finish the job. Bravo again. The 3rd app was the Yooke, a raw beef with sesame oil and quail egg combo which I've had at Korean places before. Although lacking the usual fresh vegetable underlay, the quality and taste of this dish was unlike anything I've had before. A simple presentation which highlighted the quality of the ingredients. This was our favorite dish here. Sublime is an understatement. For the main course, we had the beef belly which you grill yourself on the 800 degree electric grill set into your table. The slivers of beef cooked very quick and gave the impression that you were eating beef sushi, of the highest quality. These were so good that the side dish of lettuce wraps and other veggies took a backseat. The beef flavor was THAT good. We also ordered the chef's meat tasting which included beef heart, liver, sweat breads, 1st stomach and 3rd stomach. Again, each piece was grilled to our liking and highlighted the varying flavors and textures of our friend, the cow. The meal was complimented by a smooth unfiltered sake as well as the dipping sauces, one of which is a peppery, fishy, fermented sauce which makes everything it touches better. Also, try the Coopers Ale, an Australian beer brewed in the bottle and comes with some sediment on the bottom. Refreshing. For dessert, a simple vanilla ice cream full of vanilla bean flecks, done better than most vanilla I've had in the past, complimented with a salty caramel sauce. Bravo again. A bit pricey, bill being almost $200 before tip, but well worth it. Service was top notch and friendly. We left full, satisfied and giddy. A gastro adventure we will surely revisit.

I had the following dishes:1) Peppery Edamame - tasty, but quite oily.2) Steamed Beef Shank Buns - delicious - but this is something that you can get at Chinese restaurants for far cheaper.3) Niku-Uni -  flavor of the dish was essentially derived from the uni.   Nothing special really.4)  Rosu (Kobe beef rib eye) - believe this was Kobe beef.   It came with chunks of fat and wasn't marbled very well.   The meet was tender, but somewhat bland and nothing special.5) Tsurami (cheek) - I thought this would be better, but was quite ordinary really.6) Ox Tail - came in a small portion.  Meat was a bit rough - Ox Tail is something that is better left for stews7) Shibire - this was good (but not spectacular).  It's difficult to cook sweetbreads at the table yourself, as it takes some practice to judge whether the sweetbreads are done.8) Beef Belly - this was quite good.

And boy was I right and in all my glory.I was alone and definitely ordered way too much food for a normal person. But when it comes to wonderful fod and incredible meat, I tend to throw caution out the door.Going in I knew that I had to try the special MEGA SPARE RIB. The preparation changes I am told but on the menu last night was flambeed in bourbon and served with a caramel apple sauce. Yes, you heard that right. It's a HUGE beef rib that is slowly braised in some delicious marinade for hours until it is fall off the bone tender. The server drops these monstrosity on the grill at the table to crispy it up and get a super aweosme char. Right at the end they pour bourbon on the rib and flambee it on the grill! OMG, as if the rib itself didn't draw enough oohs and ahhs from nearby diners, the flambeed tableside presentation did. The meal slide right off the bone, is placed on a wodden blank and shredded by the server. Dipped in the caramel apple sauce or their homemade special sauce (like a sweet soy with sesame seeds) and this was darn near one of the best things I've ever eaten. Only caveat is the price varies. They start at 40 but last night they only had very big ones, so it cost $77. But its the best money you will ever spend. And I am not really ashamed to say I managed to devour the entire beef rib, much to the delight of my sever as my jealous neighbors watched me savor every bite.To get the full experience I had to try a few more dishes. I went with the beef belly and the cheek. To be completely honest, the beef belly was good but not spectacular. I think it is because I like my beef usually to be rare, and when you are grilling little pieces on such a hot open flame that impossible. Still, the flavor was wonderful but a bit chewy. Same can be said for the cheek. Its sliced paper thin, and all you need to do is grill is literally 10 seconds per side.A side of white rice was thrown in for good measure not not sure why but the rice was even spectacular.I love Takashi and can't wait to go back and feast on the rest of their incredible offerings.

But I only eat meat if is enough interesting or raw...... and Jamon"" The menu at Takashi looks to be set up to tempt people like me ... if there anyone else out there same kind* ..? . But any case, for the regular ones you will find the menu interesting as well. Either the raw lovers, the grilled lovers, the weirdo-hunters and the ones who follow my words as if I was God*. And of course, regular meat lovers. To satisfied my veggie and raw preference we order Seasonal Namul (regular pickled vegetables) and the meat version for sushi, consisting in grounded beef over sushi rice. The vegetables was fresh and refreshing and I loved the bitter touch that you could taste in the back. The meat sushi made me question my ""principles"" about eating meat as it was insanely good. The meat was like tartar. Served at room temperature, you barely appreciate the meat flavor but just deliciously fat without any trace of it and amazingly tender. Reminds me the same texture to Guacamole when is prepare fresh and right** You can dip it in the soy sauce with the excellent wasabi and wrap it in a nori sheet. All this unnecessary to me. I'm this purist about meat issues.I can picture how grilled can be more attractive for you than raw 3rd stomach, for instance. I don't understand why, but who say I belongs to regulars. Our grilled part of the menu was Horumon-Moriawase (chef's selection) consisting in Cheek, Heart, Large intestines, Fourth stomach and Sweetbreads and among Seasoned with salt, garlic and sesame oil or Marinated in Takashi's sauce, we choose the last one as its obviously unique. Actually, when I asked the waitress about it, she said secret sauce. Secret is always a magic word; somehow. This was enough to share with another person but if you are a big eater you will want it for yourself almost completely. 1 order would be fine for 1.5 people. Ok, just find another friend, be a party of 3 and ask 2 orders. The acclaimed secret sauce, secret or not, was delicious. I loved it, as is a bit sweet without being overwhelming. Next is my rank based in my preference after tasting texture and flavor of each partSweetbreadHeartLarge intestineCheek 4th stomachand this was a virgin test as it was my first time I tried those parts.  I just loved the most the texture of the sweetbreads. Its as tender as brain, but with more flavor. The heart was sweet as love. Large intestine was similar to sweetbread but more like meat, not as tender. And the 4th stomach is a whole experience. Chewy. I don't have the adequate tools in me to break this apart (maybe need to eat more meat.. ?. Who knows). Cheeks was just regular pieces of meat. Very good. Preferences apart is a very exciting experience to discern the flavor and texture among the different parts. Don't forget this is intrinsic to the piece itself as it has not suffer additional processing other than marination and in the same sauce. Its true that if you compare the value with Korean BBQ joints Takashi is expensive as the banchan and other sides coming along for the Korean can't be bet at Takashi in terms of food coma. But this is Yakiniku (Japanese term for grilled meat dishes) and apparently there is differences in the kind of meat, about how is cut and the Japanese is ate directly from the grill. Alone. Also they use Premium Japanese and American Angus. Its what is said. I don't really know obviously considering my large experience as a meat eater* but I do know the meat was excellent*** . I didn't have enough raw meat. And I didn't have enough weirdo (interesting) meat. I want Niku-Uni (chuck flap topped with sea urchin and fresh wasabi) and I want Nama-Senmai (third stomach with spicy miso sauce) and I want Achilles tendon.

853,X8tB-jInVGNCUTp7oi5QWA,Sarah W.,5.0 star rating,"4.5 stars.For respectful meat eaters with class, this place was suggested like a must try. Even with the new and soft opening a week ago, the place was totally packed and lively at 9:30PM on Saturday night. The space isn't that big and there are small bar area and only about 6 tables in total. All tables are equipped with an electric wire grill in the middle and the smoke exhaustion hood. If you read what's written on all around the chalk board walls, you will be quite educated on meaning of each beef parts, how is called in Japanese and how should be tatsted or good for your health. The owner is a Osaka Japan born Korean who loves the childhood Japanese cooking, opened Takashi combining with Korean cuisine. And yes, there are more life for beef after steaks and he wants to let the world know. Beef is major meat in Japan and Korea rather than pork or chicken. Farm bred domestic Beefs are praised the most and expensive. We give beefs as gifts in holidays. (FYI, I am a Korea born Korean).The menu mainly suggests Raw and BBQ for beef parts that are uncommon. The appetizers are very simple that are mostly like side dishes in korean cuisine.  We had Mixed Namul, which is korean hand marinated or fresh sauted variety of wild weeds. These are commonly seen if you know Bi-Bim-Bap (literally means Mixing with Rice as Bi-Bim-Meon means Mixing with Noodle, but not with namuls in that case). You mix all the Namul ingredients with rice and sauce. OK, OK, I know it will be a never ending story if I go on like this.The main entre, we wanted something raw. We've ordered Yooke(steak tartare with quail eggy york) but, they apparently ran out as well as the one with Uni. I had Yooke a lot of times so... we've ordered sushi version called Temaki. Really really OMG good. The Yooke is thin slices of beef, served mostly slightly frozen for the texture and super fresh. But this sushi was grounded and pounded pate which was so soft and crazy good. It seems they mixed with the eggy york/white so well that it tasted like buttered. It came with several sheets of roasted Nori (Dried Seaweed) to wrap and dip in wasabi & soy sauce. This one was the winner of the night.Next, grilling & BBQ, we've ordered Chef's selection since we wanted to try different parts. It came with 5 beef parts - Hatsu(heart), Akasen (4th stomach), Tetchan (Large Intestine), Shibire (sweetbreads) and Tsurami (cheek). You choose from two marinations, simple salt garlic seasame oil or Takashi's house marination. Either one, if you have been to Korean BBQ, you are familar with. The salt, garlic sesame oil is more used for pork belly (sam-geop-sal but mostly as dipping), or raw liver or heart which is usually marinated in this and sometimes mixed with crushed ginger to offset that gameness. We had the second marination which is more like Galbi marination but a bit more stronger for the parts' sake. I loved the intestine parts the most. It was perfectly burnt with patches and the chewiness was just enough. Yum. My friend loved the heart for some reason. The 4th stomach was sweet but even after 10 min of chewing, wasn't ready for swallowing. Make perfect sense why it is 4th stomach, huh? The sweetbreads were quite interesting. It was balloon soft if you get that. Actually the chalk board behind me said that it was supposed to have a taste of milk and it was indeed. Cheeks were a OK. Mostly though, I was very impressed with how the parts being prepared since none of them really had unpleasant or offending part odors which all depends how they wash prepare them. Actually depending on the preparations, the dish becomes either delicacy or street food. Well fed and jaw exercised, Takashi well deserves some 'don't waste that parts' praise, but also for how it pulled it off. And the crowds seem to approve that as well when majority were the natives of the cuisines and the rest well mixed. The servers were mixed in cultures as well in that manner and very attentive. The host actually ran after us when we were leaving, just to say good night. $45 per person spent including beer and tip. Well spent. A lot of dishes were sold out for the day but I completely understand that they won't keep more than enough stock for the freshness and safety. The waitress made sure that we grill some parts thoroughly. Though, two things that were wished. 1. Either because BBQ pieces are too tiny or the grill mesh size was too big, the pieces fell out of the mesh and we lost our food! LOL 2. There aren't much vegetable dishes for wraps (only one thing in the menu ran out), or something to pair with the meats since it could be too salty or saucy for some. Therefore, a half star is outed from being five stars. Highly Recommended. Will come back for more parts. Beef, I love you through and through. LOLP.S. One warning, be prepared to smell like BBQ all night after Takashi. Everyone knows where you have been.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"

I went on Yelp and read all the amazing reviews and was very excited to meet up with my friends.My friend made the reservations for 4 at 7:30pm on a Friday night. I arrived first at 7:30 and my other friend arrived at 7:45. One friend canceled and the other was running late. We were now down to 3.The Hostess was gracious enough to seat us and we order. My friend arrived 1 hour later, but me and my friend that were seated earlier had ordered enough food and drinks for 4 people and had no problem drinking and eating it. Now I must say that this review is not about the food or the service. It's about what happened next.At 9:25pm the hosted came over to our table to tell us that we had a 1/2 hour left because there was a reservation for 6 people and they would need our table. Mind you that there were other tables that were seated before us that were still eating and drinking, but she didn't approach them.I'm a huge foodie and a world traveler.

Came late on a Monday and seated immediately, though the waitress (Mimi was AMAZING) said there'd been a two hour wait the day before. The menu is impressive, with creative and playful appetizers and a startling array of beef and beef offal options. Is it cheap? Not how we did it, but the service was impeccable, enthusiastic, and helpful. The food was fresh, delicious, and we kept it coming. When we asked what was sweet in the neighborhood for a dessert (as we hadn't seen a dessert menu and had already paid), we had ice creams with salted caramel topping brought to us for free. This isn't the place to be thrifty, and no, the portions aren't huge. But you're paying for novelty and freshness here. Where else are you going to get testicle escargot (delicious and surprisingly not chewy) and calf brains in tubes (I broke a nail trying to get the rest out of the tube)?

These delicacies are not for the faint of heart. We nutted up and ordered the beef tongue, cheek, sweetbread (thymus gland of a baby calf) and heart. The perfectly marinated paper thin strips of cheek resembled bacon was our favorite cut of the night. I've always been obsessed with the soft creaminess of sweetbread so that was a win in my book as well- especially for how much we got for $12 (a tiny sweetbread tapa at Jack Lamb's Degustation would run for at least $18). The surprise of the night was plum sake that our waitress suggested with our meal. Hannya is a sake-based sweet plum liqueur, infused with red chili pepper and the bold flavor starts off sweet and then kicks you in the tastebuds.

869,O1LYBNqKnf1ZHVT7qRsSYg,Jiho S.,5.0 star rating,"This is as unique of a dining experience as it gets for a NY'er. Yakiniku or Japanese table top BBQ (which came to Japan by way of Korea of course, so it has its similarities). We booked a table for 5 (they only take reservations for groups of 4-6 on their website) on a Monday fairly easily. Restaurant is fairly small with about 6 tables on one side (seats groups of 4 to 6) and individual bar seating around the open kitchen. Menu itself has so many selections we found it difficult to choose. Basically imagine any part of a cow imaginable that can be BBQ'd table top...tendon, liver, heart, stomach (4 types??), intestine. Of course we didn't have the bravery to try something new this time around so we stuck with regular cuts of beef we're accustomed to. Order of ribeye, kalbi (short rib) and their chuck flat steak. Our servings of beef ranged from $22 to $30 per serving. Serving size is generally small (much smaller than what you get at a 32nd St. Korean BBQ) but the quality is far superior (US Wagyu/Kobe). The chuck flat steak was probably the best value in terms of portion size (essentially a full steak grilled on your table, later sliced up into several pieces) We also tried the buns, pickles, and beef tartare and tendons for appetizers. I'd recommend all except the tendons of which the sauce it was doused in I wasn't a particular fan of. Don't be shy and ask the server for recommendations. The menu is intimidating and there are just too many items and can be overwhelming. Also, don't bring anyone that doesn't eat red meat. A member of our party did not eat red meat and we had assumed they would have at least some chicken/fish/seafood or some vegeterian options but they literally had none at all. Our friend sadly had to eat essentially rice and pickles and the complimentary cabbage salad that came with each table. This restaurant is all about BEEF.

The food was fantastic, probably the BEST Korean BBQ ever! We ordered the rib eye marinated with olive oil, salt and pepper. The short ribs and the veggie platter. We also ordered the rice bomb topped with seaweed and sesame leaf and as a starter the flash boiled first stomach. Yes it sounds disgusting, but the stomach was tender and fatty seasoned in salty sour sauce. It was an enlightening experience really. The rib eye was tender, juicy, perfectly seasoned. As were the short ribs. The rice bomb (budakan) was basically logs of perfectly cooked rice some topped with nori and some with sesame leaf. These were also delicious and a perfect starchy side. The meal starts with a small dish of cabbage leaves in a garlic ginger sesame dressing, three words TO DIE FOR. The slightly crunchy and rubbery texture of the cabbage paired well with the light dressing. There was also bean sprouts and of course kimchi. Our server was really friendly and helpful and clearly had a passion for the food. Now onto dessert. They have one option only, house made vanilla soft serve ice cream. You can choose many different toppings including: rice flour dumplings, black sesame and soybean flour, sweet beans, and hoji or green tea syrup. I chose rice flour dumplings and the black sesame and soy bean flour. First off the ice cream was perfectly sweet, smooth, and had a real vanilla punch. It was honestly the best soft serve vanilla I have ever had. It was not just ordinary vanilla, but Madagascar vanilla so of course it had to be good. The rice flour dumplings were wonderfully chewy, soft, and moist. A definite must for those who love fresh mochi. The black sesame and soybean flour added a nice texture, though not much flavor. the best part was that it was on the house, there had been some mix up supposedly. We left and I almost left my bag, which would've been disastrous. Our server was so kind that he ran down the street to give me my bag. I was truly touched. An unforgettable night and experience.

I could eat the cucumbers every day.  Fantastic.  For starters we had then ""yooke"" which was a savory beef tartare with quail egg and lemon as well as raw mino (first stomach) in a daikon and citrusy sauce (like a ponzu). Both great.  For the grill we ordered short rib, between the bone rib, heart, 1st and 3rd stomach as well as beef belly.  Hard to say which I loved more.  All so amazing.  The scallion salad with shiso was well dressed and a lovely foil for the rich and flavorful meats.  The Budakan rice ball was very good, but unnecessary among all the glorious meat.  Can't wait to go back!!!!  Good beer and sake too.",Takashi,4.0 star rating,$$$,"Japanese,, Korean,, Barbeque"
