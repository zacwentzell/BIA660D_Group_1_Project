This place is always on my short list of places to go...brunch, lunch, or dinner, I'm always impressed with the quality and flavor of their food.This corner bar has a great setup and a nice ambiance. The bar itself is quite large with plenty of seating. Their are high top tables for two and then actual dining tables towards the back. In the warmer months, they have an outdoor patio- which is a really great addition. As for the booze- they have just about everything you could ask for: a generous beer menu, a decent wine list, and all the hard liquor you'd expect. I came one night and they had a Guinness special: $5 pint with a free laser etched Guinness glass...super cool. If you're into Bloody Mary's please be sure to specify if you like them spicy or not, because their standard bloody has a lot of kick!Onto the food- everything is really, really delicious. Here are some of my favorites- Mussels (great sized portion, seasoned well), Everything Pita and Buratta (honestly, just get it), the Wings (we order 12 and get 6 of each flavor), the Burger (huge, amazing), Chopped Brisket and Gnocchi (amazing), Grilled Cheese (they change this weekly, try it!).

5,sGn0GZWZ1GFiWu3kLniLHg,Sasha K.,4.0 star rating,"Came with a friend last weekend for brunch and was immediately impressed. I live downtown and rarely come to the Heights, but had been wanting to try the Hutton, so I finally came to my friend's neck of the woods. It was so nice out, so we sat at the spacious outdoor patio, which is unexpectedly big for a city restaurant. The service was truly excellent. We had a main waitress, but several different people attended on us throughout our meal. We both started with iced coffee - a fair price, and really tasty. We both ended up ordering the Hangover Sandwich, but I asked for no sausage. My friend was thoroughly pleased with his meal and said the meat was delicious. Mine was ONE egg, a little avocado, and some chipotle mayo on a pretty big bun, so essentially it was mostly bread-heavy bites. I only ate half the bread, so I could get the flavors inside. The fries, though, are INCREDIBLE. Forget hangover sandwich, these are now my drunk fries. They were so perfectly crispy and salty and hot and everything I could ever want in a fry. When we got the check, I was still charged the same $16 for my sandwich with no meat. As a vegetarian, I hate when restaurants charge the same price even though you've removed the most expensive part of your dish. An egg, a quarter of an avocado, some mayo, and bread should NEVER cost a customer $16 - and I'm sure the vegetarian waitress we had there would agree with me.",The Hutton,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Gastropubs,, Irish, Pub"

The bartender promptly got our Allagash beers which were at the perfect temperature. Then we decided to explore the outdoor seating. It's so nice. Couches, TVs, booths and a fairly calm atmosphere despite JFK boulevard being so close. Outstanding  job by the waiters. All 3 of them were checking on us periodically.The early dinner: The food center in my brain was getting bombarded with all these amazing flavors. Please get the Hutton Burger. The bacon jam is delicious and they selected the right bun. Brussels sprouts my least favorite but still good. The grilled octopus raised the bar again though. It was served with white beans counterintuitively they were tasty.I will return for more..",The Hutton,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Gastropubs,, Irish, Pub"

All the food looks great, but just don't order the cauliflower wings because you just pay $12 for cauliflower with sauce on it. Big waste of money.

The space is bright and light and there's a good sized yard out back that would be perfect to while away an evening in when it gets warm again. The service was A1, friendly, professional and helpful. The Hutton has a good selection of beers on tap with some unusual craft type ales and some creative cocktails. The burger was fantastic, very tasty, cooked to perfection and the onion confit it had on it complemented the meat and cheese perfectly. All the food looked good and it came out quickly from the kitchen, my husband enjoyed his breakfast sandwich and I can't wait to come back and try out more of their menu.

We were greeted quickly and since there were open tables, spots at the bar, and high tables available we were told to sit anywhere we wanted. The inside is really nice. Cozy meets trendy kinda place. We sat toward the back and ordered cocktails first. My bf got a Fresh to Death and I got a Grapefruit Ciaprihna. Both were so delicious! We ordered the lemon fries, Brussel sprouts, kale Cesar and the burrata. The lemon fries were ok. It needed more lemon and maybe a garlic aioli on the side to dip. Just my personal preference. The Brussel sprouts were good, just wish they were a little crispier. The Kale salad was not worth it. It was dry and we had to ask for extra dressing. The burrata was very flavorful. It was a small portion but it was pretty good. Does this mean I've given up on this place? Not at all. They have a beautiful outdoor area and I would definitely come here in the summer for cocktails. I also want to give their brunch a try and hopefully that will increase my rating. Overall I really enjoyed the drinks and the atmosphere but the food just needs to be tweaked a little more.

It's in kind of an unexpected location but good to have good quality options in a walkable distance. Decor: Cute, cozyFood: Underwhelming.  Specifically, the flavors were fine but not executed well. My friend ordered a burger, medium rare. First time it came out well done, second try it came out legit raw in the middle. My omelet and home fries were fine, nothing special, weird that the toast wasn't buttered but I'm not supposed to be eating bread anyway so I left it alone. I was able to make a small substitutions with little fuss. A nice dessert menu but chocolate pot de creme is a smooth custard that melts across the tongue. This one was hard and slightly chewy. Not pleasant. Service: Polite, we appreciated that the manager stepped in to make things right when he saw things weren't going well. Two stars for food, Bonus star for service.

The burrata with radicchio leaves was tasteful.We've also had brunch here. I would recommend the Hutton Burger as it's served simply just with Irish cheddar and fries. There's no frills to it. Just simply delicious. The Irish bangers were on the drier side but the eggs were cooked well.The bartenders, the wait staff and the owners are very attentive to the patrons' needs.

But, at the same time, I could go to The Corkscrew maybe five or six blocks away and pay $2-4 dollars less per drink. I don't know if I'd notice a difference. This establishment is often dead after 7pm, so, really, am I paying more for ambiance? There's a reason no one is around. The Hutton is too busy trying to be a restaurant I think they've forgotten that, at their core, it's still a bar. If this place wants to thrive past the foodie crowd they're going to need to offer drink specials. And, actually, I've been here twice during brunch and there weren't any deals even then. That's the time to do it. $5 mimosas should be a staple at ANY location that offers brunch. Silly. I was also shocked The Hutton didn't partake in things like Happy Hour, $2 beers, Women's Night, etc. Their ratatouille isn't half bad. I'd even say that I like it. They veganized it at my request which was nice. Though, in all honesty, the dish itself usually is vegan so it made me wonder what they were adding to it normally that guaranteed it wasn't. I, however, did not like the guacamole. Apples and avocado just don't go. Don't skip the cauliflower wings if you're into that type of thing.

Our server was very friendly and knew the drink menu well so it was easy choosing a drink based on her recommendation. (Fresh To Death WAS refreshing, thank you!) For dinner, we ordered from the Rest. Week menu: I started with the Apple Guacamole---loved the BBQ plantain that came with it! For the entree, I had the Smoked Brisket and Gnocchi. Lots of brisket, not enough gnocchi but rich and delicious overall. And for dessert, the Italian Donuts which barely saw the light of day. My friend had the Shrimp Skewer and the Crisp Cod with Chips which I managed to taste-test, and if it wasn't for the fact that it was her birthday, I would've had more than a bite of each. I did leave her alone with her Banana Bread Ice Cream Sandwich but only because I didn't have enough room in my belly after my Italian Donuts.

I hope I'm not biased because I'm so excited to have this place in our neighborhood, but the food and drinks are on point and the owners are lovely. The beet salad is great. The vegan squash ravioli is delicious, and the small portion is more than enough for one person to have as a meal. The Irish grilled cheese will become a constant strain on my waistline. The cauliflower steak could use a little bit of refining, but it's also a pretty solid choice. I'm excited for them to start doing brunch mid November. The Hutton Mary was a lifesaver the day after a night of too much drinking. I also want to point out that the outdoor space is a rare gem in The Heights. It's huge, and, unlike downtown, not overcrowded with tons of people all looking to dine and drink outdoors. Really, really happy this place is in our neighborhood.

We waited days, counting down to when we'd be able to see this place for ourselves, the heights community could not have been more excited. We were not disappointed. From the well thought-out wine/beer menu to the creative cocktail recipes and the amazing food selection; this place has already set the bar for all restaurants in JC Heights! The environment was warm and welcoming. The interior of the place is beautiful. It looks like a lot of the original design was kept intact, which I appreciated. Their outdoor patio is absolutely gorgeous. You must see it for yourself! The proprietors walked around the restaurant, bought everyone their first drink on the house. They were friendly and obviously excited to have their new restaurant open. My boyfriend and I tried the Hutton's take on a Grilled Cheese and we loved it. The flavor of the sandwich could have been a little more even throughout but beside that it was great. The service from the staff was alright. Some servers didn't seem to have much experience or might have been a bit nervous. I hope they follow the model their bosses are setting by being friendly, open and making eye contact with customers. We enjoyed a few drinks throughout the afternoon and I believe their Smash 225 is my new favorite cocktail. The ginger beer and Jack Daniels combination is so smooth and full of flavor.

78,5T0ZlFzC3fkmi_VKSISHLw,Scott W.,3.0 star rating,"Would slot my rating at more near 2.5, which isn't to say that this place does anything poorly--it's just that they don't do anything that you wouldn't find already existent in Hoboken. That said, one could argue that the restaurants in JC Heights are more or less just replicating the Hoboken experience, so is this place to blame for jumping on the ""artisinal"" bandwagon?I've been here three times and each time have been impressed by the quality of the food. The ricotta from the cheese plate is exceptional; the smoked salmon BLT is tasty; the sliders showcase high quality, full-flavor beef. That said, menu items are not unique/innovative enough to warrant that they are all priced about $2--$3 too high. And while I recognize that rent in the Heights is on the rise, it would have been cool if this place could have been a monetary and cultural respite from the inundation of yuppie-centric restaurants popping up around town. Then again, why be different and risk profit when you can be safe and profit?Portions are also on the smaller side; you're paying for taste and presentation more than anything. Like I said, the food is good but the selection leaves a bit to be desired--menu descriptions fall into that Brooklyn bar-scene jargon; for example, the ""Burrata"" item features ""pistachio pesto,"" ""grilled radicchio,"" and the nebulous yet seductive inclusion of ""dry fruits.""  As for drinks, cocktails are elaborate and diffuse. The Kennedy (pickleback with a PBR) is solid. Draft beers on the regular, not happy hour menu, are between $5--$7. Cheapest is Lagunitas at $5--fine; moderate price point--but Miller Lites for $6? Disappointing. A mile away in uptown Hoboken, 10th and Willow and Turtle Club offer Coors Lite on draft for $2 and $3 respectively. That this restaurant doesn't offer a wallet-pleasing light beer option confirms all suspicions that yes, this place has decided to cater to the mindless yuppie influx; and no, this place is not gunning for the type of clientele (punks, artists, general riff raff) which could actually pack this place with the cooler people who live out here--not just Hoboken finance-types who Uber up here for brunch.Decor is rustic and charming--that affected Swiss-chalet-meets-wine-cellar feel. Service is pleasant and professional: servers wear denim shirts, management is polite and friendly. The back patio is beautiful, spacious, and even includes a smoking section. I'd love to hang here this summer and REALLY HOPE (yet doubt) they will consider including a cheap draft option so my friends and I can sip on a couple reasonably priced cold ones until we're buzzed enough to shell out $17 for grilled octopus. TL;DR? This place is fine if you're easily duped or okay with being easily duped by frilly (but tasty) menu options.",The Hutton,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Gastropubs,, Irish, Pub"
79,AJvpUuUTEwxp5cQef708zg,J Z.,5.0 star rating,"This place is plain ol' nice. It reminds me a little bit of Park & Sixth (in a good way). It definitely feels like a neighborhood bar. The staff was attentive and chill. The decor is standard upscale bar decor, dark wood and a metal ceiling and exposed brick and such. The menu is a little small, but there were four off-menu specials supplementing it. The menu isn't too fancy nor is it boringly simple. The bartender tells me that they do live music Friday through Sunday (maybe Thursday too, I didn't quite hear). The music is chill: think Q104.3, lots of Billy Joel and blues. Honestly I meant it when I said ""plain ol' nice."" Like this is nice but I've seen this type of place before, so the concept is a little forgettable, ""plain."" However, the patio absolutely stands out. The patio is a legit attraction. It's huge and comfortable. They have big outdoor TVs and there are workers here right now (8:30 pm Wednesday) installing more fixtures. It looks like they're adding a small backyard bar. The patio looks like an awesome place to get brunch on a beautiful day. I got the burger which was $16 for some reason. It came out nice and fast. It was very slightly over cooked and very slightly under salted, but I'm being nitpicky by saying that. I prefer my medium rare to be closer to red inside instead of pink, but it was pink all the way through. That's what I mean by nitpicky. The burger itself had a nice little crust on it, and the bun held up ok despite it being a juicy burger. I have no clue what they put on top of it, but there was a slightly sweet ""spackle"" made of grilled onions, mushroom, and who knows what else. The crowd was nice and low-key. This is a nice bar. If it weren't a little out of the way, I could see myself stopping in for a pint every now and then. This is probably a 4 or even 3 star review, depending on how cranky I'm feeling, since my socks weren't quite knocked off. But I'm giving five stars because this place seems well-run, the people that work here are nice, and I feel good about this place and I'd like it to succeed.",The Hutton,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Gastropubs,, Irish, Pub"

It's really really good and definitely my ""worth-it"" winner from the menu.

The location is perfect and close by to me, the beer selection is phenomenal (Kane Head High and Founder Breakfast Stout stand out to me), and the atmosphere is everything you want in a local bar.  The bartenders and servers are all very nice and attentive.Now for the food.  The food I found to be a bit overpriced.  To this point I have had a few things off of the snack menu, and a couple of the ""Classics.""  On the snacks menu, I've had the chips, which were very tasty, however $5 for something that many places would keep on the bar for all to enjoy?  The popcorn tasted stale and sort of smushed when you bit into it, but the little pieces of candied bacon were very good in it.  I don't think i would spend the $8 on this again.  The Cheese puffs were so good.  I liked those a lot.  As far as meals are concerned I had the fish and chips - which may have been a bit too fishy but wasn't bad as well as the burger.  The burger was VERY good, though I wouldn't mind a couple cheese options and topping choices (red onion, bacon).  Get the burger if you go.  The french fries, similar to the popcorn tasted stale and overcooked.  They had more of a crunch than a crisp, if that makes sense.Overall, I will go back, because the beer is so good and it's very close.  But if I can avoid eating there I might.",The Hutton,4.5 star rating,$$,"American, (New),, Gastropubs,, Irish, Pub"

Too bad I ve been so disappointed.. and I gave it several tries.Thinking they had to work out any new business kinks. The menu is atrocious .. Odd things , and by reading reviews.. i guess if your hungry  stick to the burger.But I m not a foodie ..or a vergetarian .. just like to eat. Good food. And the menu  is too complicated with no substance.The staff is just polite enough not to be rude, but the bar has no feeling of welcome. The Mgr Rob is pleasant , bright , funny. He and a waiter named Sam are the only 2 people that have any idea of how to create a nice atmosphere for customers. Not pushy or overwhleming.. just nice and friendly. Everyone else is Ice Cold.

A fun, warm, local bar/restaurantVery fair alcohol pricesGreat serviceConsThe food is overpriced. We got smokey potato chips, which was about 20 chips with spices. It was somehow worse than actual potato chips. I got the burger, which for $16 was not worth the price. It's a good burger but not great, and to go to bar in the dead middle of nowhere in JC, this just made no sense. There are so many burgers all over JC that are better and cheaper. My lady got the fish and chips which was fine. Nothing to write home about. We also tried the Italian donuts for desserts. They were good. Again, nothing awesome. I'm not sure why the price point on the food is so high here. It's an awesome space, and I'm not sure why they are peddling $20-$30 entrees bc there's nothing close to that value here.

First, the price point was so high for the neighborhood. Yes, there's a monopoly on trendy, sit down places, but $28 for chicken and some undercooked risotto is not going to work out in this neighborhood. Also, the menu has changed several times in the weeks since it had opened and I guess I was handed an old menu when I was seated. I asked for a glass of Riesling (on the menu as glass/bottle) only to be told that they served it by the bottle exclusively. I had to point out where it was listed on the menu three times to different wait staff and then wait 20 minutes to finally get some.
