0,-skiZtMwQ1ibUoY7RSHvyQ,Barry S.,4.0 star rating,"This quaint, modest, very colorful local eatery arrived only months ago, and its owners are the real deal, bringing recipes from their Mexican homeland. The food is authentic and passed the strict test of a visiting Texan who knows his Mexican food, and gobbled up his meal of fried chorizo tostadas. However, this vegetarian New Yorker simply loves the flavoring used, and thoroughly enjoyed his veggie burrito (w mozzarella, if desired!) and the very savory tortilla soup. You can also catch up on latin cable telenovellas, music videos & news on the vivid widescreen over the bar/counter. Delicious coffee, too.",Viva Mexico,4.0 star rating,$$,Mexican
1,uf6Ojif7NTuyJXqX7Zbsfg,Melissa S.,3.0 star rating,This restaurant needs to invest in better sound/music speakers. All of a sudden the music blasts and then lowers. Can't relax or talk to your waiter. At times it's so loud. Manager said they can't control it's because of Pandora. You can absolutely determine the volume. Even for Friday happy hour it's obnoxious.,Viva Mexico,4.0 star rating,$$,Mexican

They prepared our food right away and it was delicious, very authentic Mexican. We ordered steak tacos and a tinga (seasoned chicken) quesadilla. The horchata was also delicious. It's awesome to have this little hole-in-the-wall in our neighborhood. This is sure to be on our list of local favorites.",Viva Mexico,4.0 star rating,$$,Mexican
